The experiment lasted from 1869&ndash;1879. It was not considered as part of the larger eugenics history because of its radical religious context. The term \"stirpiculture\" was used by John Humphrey Noyes, founder of the Oneida Community, to refer to his system of eugenics, or the breeding of humans to achieve desired perfections within the species. Noyes derived stirpiculture from the Latin word \"stirps\", which means \"stock, stem, or root\" (Carden). It has been claimed that Noyes coined the term two decades before Francis Galton created the term \"eugenics\". In 1904, Galton claimed that he had first come up with the term and \"deliberately changed it for eugenics,\" a claim supported in print by George Willis Cooke. In his 1883 book Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development, Galton noted that his new term \"eugenics\" was a suitable replacement for the older term \"viriculture\" that he had invented, suggesting that he had confused the two terms \"viriculture\" and \"stirpiculture.\"\nOrigins of the Oneida stirpiculture experiment\nUntil the late 1860s, John Humphrey Noyes and his community prevented the unintentional conception of children through their practice of male continence (a type of coitus reservatus). Instead, Noyes and the community believed in only having children with purpose and preparation. In this communal society, it was not simply about the preparedness of the parents, but rather the preparedness of the community to support a new generation. \"A mistake was considered a serious detriment to the society\" (Kinsley 13). In the early years of the community, when poverty was an issue, the community did not feel adequately prepared to take on the raising and support of children. Therefore, procreation was discouraged in these early days before the financial successes of the community's trap-building manufacturing. An \"accidental\" conception was thought to be a failure in male continence, the act that was meant to prevent unwanted pregnancies through the withholding of male ejaculation during intercourse. However, accidental conceptions did occur.\nNoyes developed the stirpiculture experiment through his reading and interpretations of Plato, Charles Darwin, Francis Galton and agricultural breeders. Noyes had begun to read Darwin's Principles of Breeding and Sir Francis Galton's papers and books on subjects ranging from anthropology, meteorology, horticulture, and eugenics (Circular, Vol II, No. 3, March 27, 1865). Intrigued by these readings, Noyes expanded upon these ideas and considered the potential benefits in the use of scientific propagation to create humans through intentional reproduction rather than haphazard sex.\nThe experiment\nIn 1869, the Oneida Community began its experiment with stirpiculture, which Noyes governed in tandem with a committee. Community men and women were paired owing to their exhibition of superior mental and spiritual qualities. The Circular, a newspaper run by the Oneida Community for the Community, printed several articles outlining Noyes' idea of what the Oneida Community should strive to achieve in its experiment: all of the qualities of Christianity's patriarchs' (Abraham's obedience, Jesus as the Son of God).\nParticipants\nNoyes was the main judge of the men and women selected to parent children in the experiment, but he also sought the aid of a committee. This committee approved and denied requests of community members to have a child. Many members applied as couples, and some of the couples were actually encouraged by the committee itself. There was a set of standards by which each candidate should meet; older men in the Community were especially sought after according to the community's idea of Ascending Fellowship, as Noyes believed they were much wiser and spiritually sound. Women, on the other hand, were typically between the ages of 20 and 42. Both men and women were chosen based on spiritual and virtuous qualities, as opposed to physical ones. Each potential parent was required to sign a contract committing themselves to the experiment, and most importantly to God and his human representative Noyes (Carden 62). Most important in these pledges were the promises to avoid any \"personal feelings in regard to child-bearing\" because it was believed that this quality would help them to better serve the experiment and most importantly, the Community.\nRaising the children\nChildren at Oneida were raised communally, not specifically by their biological parents. They were brought up under the supervision of community \"Mothers\" and \"Fathers\" who were assigned the job of childcare in a separate wing of the Oneida Community's Mansion House. Many community members also assisted with childcare.\nThe children were raised with access to the countryside and good nutrition, and Oneida was isolated from chronic diseases that might have affected children in more crowded areas. As the children grew, their families and friends encouraged them to go to college and to achieve worldly success. If they decided to attend college, they would board with The New Haven Family sect of the community. In part, this push toward outside education, especially scientific education, would contribute to the breakup of the Oneida Community.\n}}\nSources\n*Carden, Maren Lockwood.
