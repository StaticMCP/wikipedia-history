Stewart Company, as their usual work of building custom wooden auto bodies was falling out of favor at that time.\nDesign\nThe M-1 was a conventional landing gear equipped, all-wooden construction, mid-winged monoplane with two tandem open cockpits, each of which had side-by-side seating for a total of four people. It was powered by a  Curtiss OX-5 engine. The wing spar was made of spruce with mahogany veneer.\nOperational history\nThe prototype was test flown from 1928 to 1929. Production was canceled with the onset of the Great Depression. One owner operated the aircraft from Flint, Michigan until 1934. The prototype was dismantled in 1937.\nSpecifications (Stewart M-1)\n|more general=\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=Curtiss OX-5\n|eng1 type=\n|eng1 kw=\n|eng1 hp=90\n|prop blade number=2\n|prop name=\n|prop dia m=\n|prop dia ft=\n|prop dia in=\n|prop dia note=\n|perfhide=\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=105\n|max speed kts=\n|max speed note=\n|cruise speed kmh=\n|cruise speed mph=85\n|cruise speed kts=\n|cruise speed note=\n|stall speed kmh=\n|stall speed mph=\n|stall speed kts=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|never exceed speed mph=\n|never exceed speed kts=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|range km=\n|range miles=400\n|range nmi=\n|range note=\n|endurance=\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling ft=15000\n|ceiling note=\n|g limits=\n|roll rate=\n|glide ratio=\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate ftmin=\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|lift to drag=\n|wing loading kg/m2=\n|wing loading lb/sqft=\n|wing loading note=\n|power/mass=\n|thrust/weight=\n|more performance=\n|avionics=\n}}\nReferences"
