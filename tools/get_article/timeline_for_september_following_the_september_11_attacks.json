This article summarizes events which relate to the attacks in the remaining days of September 2001. News coverage was significant in the period after the attacks which meant that many of these events were reported on quickly by news agencies at the time.\nAll times, except where otherwise noted, are in Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), or UTC−04:00.\nSeptember 2001\nTuesday, September 11\nCBS and CNN report that a van filled with explosives has been stopped on the George Washington Bridge. According to the report, the New Jersey police claimed there were enough explosives to destroy the entire bridge. The FBI denied the report.\nWednesday, September 12\n*2:30&nbsp;a.m.: According to a later report, three Israeli men had been arrested because they had been seen celebrating the attack, although there were no explosives involved.\n*Before 3:15&nbsp;a.m.: The Boston Herald reports that at least five Arab men have been identified as suspects. Two of them were brothers, and one a trained pilot. Their passports have been traced to the United Arab Emirates.

According to CNN, the FBI can neither confirm nor deny this. The men had been in a fight with a man shortly before take-off; this man later recalled the incident and called the police.\n*Before 3:50&nbsp;a.m.: The Jerusalem Post reports that Osama bin Laden has given a speech denying any connection to the attacks, which he called admirable.\n*4:35&nbsp;a.m.: CNN reports that search warrants have been issued in south Florida because of information from the passenger lists of the hijacked planes.\n*After 7:00&nbsp;a.m.: PAPD Officer John McLoughlin, who was in an underground corridor between the two towers when the South Tower collapsed, is pulled alive from the rubble of the World Trade Center.\n*10:00&nbsp;a.m.: Congress reconvenes.\n*10:53&nbsp;a.m.: President George W.

The believers do not fear such things. ...\" ... \"When the confrontation begins, strike like champions who do not want to go back to this world. Shout, 'Allahu Akbar,' because this strikes fear in the hearts of the non-believers. God said: 'Strike above the neck, and strike at all of their extremities.' Know that the gardens of paradise are waiting for you in all their beauty, and the women of paradise are waiting, calling out, 'Come hither, friend of God.' They have dressed in their most beautiful clothing...\" ... \"If you slaughter, do not cause the discomfort of those you are killing, because this is one of the practices of the prophet, peace be upon him...\" ... \"Do not seek revenge for yourself.
