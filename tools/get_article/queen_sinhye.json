Now that I have heard the stories of the generals, even women and children will be thrilled and exited. General, what more can I say?\"\"의(義)로써 탐학함을 물리치는 것은 예로부터 해온 일입니다. 지금 여러 장군들의 이야기를 들으니 아녀자도 분발하겠거늘 하물며 대장부께서야 더 말해 무엇하겠습니까?\"\nShe encouraged her husband to put on his own armor and participated in protest to start a revolution.\nIn 918, her husband overthrew Kung Ye and established the new dynasty, she became the Queen consort.
