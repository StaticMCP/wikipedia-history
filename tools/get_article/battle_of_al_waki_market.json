Corporal David Hayden who was also on the patrol said \"It was as if everybody out there that day decided 'let's just have a go at them'. It was coming from all directions.\" The battle lasted for nearly 90 minutes with a heavy concentration of fire for 30 minutes. at one point the Gunner on a WIMK Was shot in the chest, only stopped by his ballistic vest, He was knocked off the WMIK.
