The Kings received the eleventh overall pick in the 1997 NBA draft, and selected shooting guard, and French basketball star Olivier Saint Jean out of San Jose State University, and also selected point guard Anthony Johnson out of the College of Charleston with the 39th overall pick; Saint Jean would later on change his name to Tariq Abdul-Wahad after converting to Islam the previous year.\nDuring the off-season, the team signed free agent Terry Dehere, and undrafted rookie center Michael Stewart from the University of California. Rookie power forward Lawrence Funderburke out of Ohio State University, who was drafted by the Kings as the 51st overall pick in the 1994 NBA draft, but went to play overseas in Greece and France, made his debut in the NBA this season.\nThe Kings got off to a slow start losing their first four games of the regular season, on their way to a 5–14 start, but later on won 8 of their 14 games in January, and held a 20–28 record at the All-Star break. At mid-season, the team traded Michael Smith, and Bobby Hurley to the Vancouver Grizzlies in exchange for former Kings forward Otis Thorpe, and second-year guard Chris Robinson. However, with a 26–36 record as of March 6, 1998, the Kings struggled losing 19 of their final 20 games, including a 12-game losing streak and seven straight losses to end the regular season; they finished in fifth place in the Pacific Division with a 27–55 record, which was fourteen games behind the 8th-seeded Houston Rockets.\nMitch Richmond averaged 23.2 points per game, led the Kings with 130 three-point field goals, and was named to the All-NBA Third Team. In addition, Corliss Williamson showed improvement becoming the team's starting power forward, averaging 17.7 points and 5.6 rebounds per game, while Billy Owens provided the team with 10.5 points and 7.5 rebounds per game. Meanwhile, Funderburke played a sixth man role off the bench, averaging 9.5 points and 4.5 rebounds per game, but only played 52 games due to injury, Johnson contributed 7.5 points and 4.3 assists per game, Olden Polynice provided with 7.9 points and 6.3 rebounds per game, and Stewart contributed 6.6 rebounds, and led the team with 2.4 blocks per game. Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf only played just 31 games, missing the final three months of the regular season with the flu and an corneal ulcer, as he contributed 7.3 points per game off the bench.\nDuring the NBA All-Star weekend at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York, Richmond was selected for the 1998 NBA All-Star Game, as a member of the Western Conference All-Star team; it was his sixth and final All-Star appearance. In addition, Richmond also participated in the inaugural NBA 2Ball Competition, along with Ruthie Bolton-Holifield of the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs, and Stewart was selected for the NBA Rookie Game, as a member of the Western Conference Rookie team.\nRichmond finished in fifteenth place in Most Valuable Player voting, while Williamson finished in second place in Most Improved Player voting, behind Alan Henderson of the Atlanta Hawks. For the first time since moving to Sacramento, the Kings failed to sell out a home game at the ARCO Arena II on November 6, 1997, ending their 497-game sellout streak.\nFollowing the season, Richmond was traded along with Thorpe to the Washington Wizards after seven seasons with the Kings, while Owens and Polynice both signed as free agents with the Seattle SuperSonics, whom Polynice used to play for, Johnson signed with the Atlanta Hawks, Stewart signed with the Toronto Raptors, Abdul-Rauf left to play overseas in Turkey, and head coach Eddie Jordan was fired.\nDraft picks\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\"\n!
