Ethiopian chronicles mention this battle as the Battle of Ayfars.\nAfter the Christian defeat at Antukyah Eslamu fled to Zari where he received orders from Lebna Dengel demoting him and placed him under the command of Takla Iyasus, The governor of Angot. However, when Iyasus arrived in Zari Eslamu forces where largely reduced by desertations as well as from the casualties at Antukyah. At Zari the Muslims were able to catch the Christian force off guard due to intelligence gathered from native Crypto Muslims. Both Eslamu and Takla Iyasus were slain in the ensuing battle along with numerous Azmachs such as the governors of Begemder, Gojjam, and Hamasien. This devastating loss led to the complete withdrawal of the Ethiopians from the Shewan Plateau.\nReferences"
