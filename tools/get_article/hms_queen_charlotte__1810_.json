She replaced the first  sunk in 1800.\nWilliam Brown\nIn 1815, a Black sailor from Grenada named William Brown.  Brown was discharged from Queen Charlotte 'for being a woman' as recorded on the ship's muster register. Brown's real name remains unknown, though she allegedly joined the crew of Queen Charlotte following a quarrel with her husband. The Annual Register, published the same year as her discharge, described her as being around 26 years of age and that she was rated able on the books. Historians debate the length of her naval service, with many arguing she served no more than eleven days before her identity was discovered, whilst some sources at the time state she served for upwards of eleven years, including as captain of the fore-top. Brown is largely believed to have been the first Black woman to serve in the Royal Navy.\nCareer\nQueen Charlotte spent a short amount of time as part of the West Africa Squadron in 1816, formed in 1808 in response to An Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade in Britain that was passed in 1807. The role of the Squadron was to patrol the West Africa coastline, intercepting slaving vessels. Most notably, Queen Charlotte gained notoriety when she captured the Le Louis – a French slaving vessel – on 11th March 1816. Le Louis was taken off Cape Mesurado having set sail from Martinique in January 1816. Following engagement, the ship was taken to Freetown, Sierra Leone, where the Admiralty courts legally confirmed the free status of those on board who had been enslaved. They were then consigned by the colonial government to a variety of unfree labour apprenticeships as part of their transition to becoming 'free subjects'.\nHMS Queen Charlotte’s seizure of Le Louis, however, caused a legal controversy that tested and defeated Britain’s right to search suspected and actual slaving vessels by challenging the Vienna Declaration of 1815.\nSir William Scott, Judge of the High Court of Admiralty, ruled that the right to visit and search royal warships did not exist in peacetime, except in the case of piracy, but because the transatlantic slave trade was not piracy under the Law of Nations, nor had the French declared the transatlantic slave trade to be piracy, the Royal Navy had no right to intercept Le Louis. Scott added:\n“A nation is not justified in assuming rights that do not belong to her merely because she means to apply them to a laudable purpose; nor in setting out upon a moral crusade of converting other nations by unlawful force...”\nHe ended by stating that no government could “force the way to liberation of Africa by trampling on the independence of other states of Europe.”\nLater that year, Queen Charlotte was Lord Exmouth's flagship during the Bombardment of Algiers in 1816.\nOn 17 September 1817, Linnet, a tender to Queen Charlotte, seized a smuggled cargo of tobacco. The officers and crew of Queen Charlotte shared in the prize money.|group=Note}}\nOn 17 December 1823, Queen Charlotte was driven into the British ship Brothers at Portsmouth, Hampshire, England. Brothers suffered severe damage in the collision.\nFile:Nicolaas Baur - Krijgsraad aan boord van de 'Queen Charlotte'.jpg|Council of war on board Queen Charlotte, 1818, by Nicolaas Baur\nFile:Robert Salmon - The British Fleet Forming a Line off Algiers - 37.500 - Museum of Fine Arts-IMG 5102.JPG|Detail of Robert Salmon's The British Fleet Forming a Line off Algiers\nFigurehead\nWhen HMS Queen Charlotte was sold for breaking up, the figurehead was removed and mounted high up on the gabled end of an accommodation block near the entrance to the gunnery training base on Whale Island. When those buildings were demolished in 2004, the figurehead was removed and placed upon a plinth at the entrance to HMS Excellent (shore establishment).\nThe figurehead is now in the collection of the National Museum of the Royal Navy.\nNotes\nCitations\nReferences\n* Lavery, Brian (1983): The Ship of the Line - Volume 1: The development of the battlefleet 1650-1850.
