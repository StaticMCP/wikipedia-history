Karen Ordahl Kupperman, author of a carefully researched book on the Providence Island colony, of which he was the first governor, says he was son of Sir Robert's sixth child, Sir Edmund Bell (1562–1608).\nAnother source says that he was the son of Sir Edmund's son, Sir Robert Bell, and Mary Chester (1590–1656), daughter of Sir Anthony Chester.\nThis Sir Robert Bell was knighted in 1613, elected Member of Parliament for Norfolk on 26 January 1626, and died in October 1639.\nHe married Mary Chester in 1610.}}\nIf so, he was born on 19 June 1590, either in South Acre, Norfolk or in Beaupré Hall, Outwell, Norfolk.\nHis mother was Anne Osborne, daughter of Sir Peter Osbourne, the Treasurer's Remembrancer in the Exchequer.\nSeveral of his siblings became involved with the Virginia colony.\nBermuda\n]]\nBermuda, originally called the Somers Isles, is a small group of islands in the mid-Atlantic.\nThe Somers Isles Company owned the islands, and arranged for settlement by Englishmen who planted tobacco.\nThere was very limited available land, the soil was poor and the climate unfavorable.\nThe planters' problems were compounded by squabbles between the Warwick and Sandys factions of the company.\nCaptain Philip Bell reached Bermuda late in 1626 or early in 1627.\nBell belonged to the Warwick faction.\nHe found his predecessor, Captain Henry Woodhouse, facing an attack by the Bermuda assembly for misgovernment.\nBell advised Woodhouse to leave as soon as possible, but Woodhouse refused and was censured and fined, then thrown in prison when he refused to apologise.\nBell, from a privileged background, resented the high status of merchants on the island.\nHe complained of needing \"to live in such a slavishe subjectione to such meane & base minded men as the citizen part of the Companye are & doe showe themselves.\"\nAs governor, Bell was entitled to 32 servants, of whom 24 were to work the 12 shares of land that were assigned to him.\nAlthough some were black, they were not necessarily slaves.\nIn 1629 Bell wrote pessimistically\n}}\nBell fell out with some of the other settlers in Bermuda.\nIn a letter to Sir Nathaniel Rich dated 28 April 1629, Bell protested about having been blamed for the unrest by the Somers Island Company in England without having been given the opportunity to defend himself. He said the ringleader of the unrest was Stephen Painter, whom he described as a man of \"Luciferian Pride\", and said the contention arose because Bell would not \"suffer the conclusions of the General Assembly and the general equity of the whole land to give place to PAINTER's proud and licentious humour.\"  Bell said that he had resolved to move from the island, and to settle wherever his father in law Daniel Elfreth went.\nIn 1629, Bell left Bermuda and became governor of the Providence Island colony.\nHe was succeeded by Captain Roger Wood, who governed from 1629 to 1637.\nProvidence\nIn 1628 two ships funded by the puritan Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick, explored the western Caribbean and discovered the San Andrés and Santa Catalina islands. Captain Daniel Elfrith, Bell's father-in-law, sailed to Bermuda where he told Bell of their findings.  In March 1629, Bell wrote to his cousin Sir Nathaniel Rich announcing the discovery.\nBell's letter described Santa Catalina as \"lying in the heart of the Indies & the mouth of the Spaniards.\"  Thus it was an excellent base for privateering against the Spanish ships.\nBell considered that the island would also provide excellent revenue from tobacco and other crops.\nBell's letter led to the formation of the Providence Island Company to organize the settlement.\nBell took several Bermudans with him to Providence in 1629, including whites and blacks.\nIn 1630 the Company decided that Bell would succeed Elfrith as the governor of the colony.\nAt first Bell lived alone on the island, but when he threatened to resign the Providence Island Company arranged to ship out his wife to encourage him to stay.\nThis was an exception. Until 1635 the Company discouraged planters from bringing their families.\nThe company forbade swearing, drunkenness or profaning the Sabbath and warned against the evils of idleness.\nBell was instructed to seize and destroy \"cards and Dice and Tables\" that had been sent to the island.\nDespite or because of this, there were intense disputes among the occupants of the island throughout the life of the colony.\nAlthough the original plan had been to grow tobacco, there was a glut on the market.\nThe directors tried to encourage the planters to grow crops such as silk grass, cotton, sugar cane, pomegranates, figs or juniper berries.  However, despite a collapse in prices in 1634, the planters persisted in growing tobacco.\nLabor on Providence island was originally undertaken by indentured servants from England, although Bell brought some black slaves from Bermuda.  Around 1634–1635 the four-year terms of the indentured servants expired, and planters demanded the right to use slaves in their place. One colonist spoke out against this practice, saying that Christians should not hold slaves. Bell silenced this man on instructions from the company, so he could not stir up the slaves against their masters.\nWhen the English arrived, they found a small group of Dutch privateers living there.  Later, Elfrith invited the privateer Diego el Mulato to the island.\nThe settlers were alarmed that the presence of these men would draw Spanish retaliation, and in 1632 they were near mutiny, led by their chaplain, Lewis Morgan.\nAt the same time, they resented having to contribute to building and manning the defenses.\nThe Spanish sent an expedition that reached the island in July 1635, but their attack was ineffectual.\nAfter the Spanish attack, King Charles I of England issued letters of marque to the Providence Island Company on 21 December 1635 that authorized raids on the Spanish.\nIn March 1636 the Company dispatched Captain Robert Hunt on the Blessing to assume the governorship of what was now viewed as a base for privateering.\nBell was replaced as governor in 1636, and left the island in 1637.\nBarbados\nis the farthest island to the east, on the edge of the chart.]]\nIn 1640, Bell led a group of settlers to Saint Lucia.  By 1641 he was on Barbados as governor.\nHe was appointed by James Hay, 2nd Earl of Carlisle, who owned the island, with the approved of Lord Warwick and the Committee of Trade and Plantations.\nThe island had been settled in 1627 by a group of Englishmen hoping to develop tobacco plantations,\nbut the leaf turned out to be poor quality.\nThey then tried cotton, ginger and indigo, but none of these crops were very successful.\nIn the mid-1640s the settler James Drax tried sugar, struggling at first to master the complex production process.\nBy the end of the 1640s the difficulties had been solved.  Prices were extremely high, and the island became \"one of the richest spots of earth under the sun\".\nOriginally the labor force was provided by poor whites, but the planters found that Africans slaves worked harder, cost less and were better able to tolerate the climate.  By 1650 the island had 6,000 black slaves and 24,000 whites.\nBell made a number of administrative reforms.\nHe completed organization of the court system and the parish governments.\nHe made the island's assembly a legal body, consisting of the leading residents, with the power to pass legislation.\nThe land grant act by his predecessor Henry Hawley was confirmed, as were existing property rights, and proprietary dues were abolished.\nBell passed an act directed against radical puritans in Barbados, suppressing \"certayne sects and separatists.\"  These people, with \"erroneous opinions\", were ordered to cease meeting in private and attempting to seduce others to their views, but to conform to public Anglican worship.\nBarbados remained neutral for most of the English Civil War, which broke out in 1642 after a long period of growing hostility between the king and parliament.\nExiles from both sides avoided conflict as they ran their plantations and trading operations.\nBell wrote in 1645 that,\n}}\nAs the tide turned in favor of the parliamentarians, increasing numbers of royalist refugees arrived in the island.\nKing Charles I of England was executed in January 1649, and the truce between the two sides on the island began to break down.\nPhilip Bell favored neutrality. He published a declaration on 29 April 1650 saying \"... no man should take up Armes, nor act in any hostile manner upon paine of death.\"\nOn 30 April, the leaders of the Royalist faction persuaded two militia leaders to raise their men. Bell ordered them to disband, but they refused.\nBell called on James Drax to raise a force to keep the peace, but he was unable to gather enough men to present a credible challenge to the royalists, who were marching on Bridgetown.  Bell was forced to concede control of the arsenal and of his own person to the Cavaliers.\nThe Roundheads were disarmed and punished.\nA declaration of loyalty to Charles II was published on 3 May 1650.\nFrancis, Lord Willoughby, arrived at the end of July 1650.\nCharles II had appointed him as the new Governor of the \"Caribbee Isles\", and he took over from Bell.\nPhilip Bell died in England in 1678 and was buried at Outwell, Norfolk.\nReferences\nNotes\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
