There have since been multiple manga, anime and video game adaptations, several of which have been translated into English. The plots generally follow the conventions and structure of the RPG systems including Dungeons & Dragons and Sword World RPG, in which several characters of distinct types undertake a specific quest.\nOrigins\nRecord of Lodoss War was created in 1986 by Group SNE as a Dungeons & Dragons \"replay\" serialized in the Japanese magazine Comptiq from September 1986 to September 1989 issues, though they also used the setting with other systems such as Tunnels & Trolls and RuneQuest.\nMany shorter Lodoss scenarios and replays were published in the Comp RPG magazine (initially a supplement of Comptiq) that ran from 1991 to 1994. Replays are not novels, but transcripts of RPG sessions, meant to both hold the interest of readers and convey the events that took place. They have proven to be popular, even to those who do not play role-playing games but are fans of fiction (including fantasy fiction). Similar to light novels, many characters and parties in replays have become popular as characters of anime. An example of such a character is the female elf Deedlit in Record of Lodoss War, who was played by science fiction novelist Hiroshi Yamamoto during the RPG sessions.\nThe popularity of the Record of Lodoss War replays was such that the Dungeon Master Ryo Mizuno started to adapt the story into some of the earliest Japanese-language domestic high fantasy novels in 1988.\nWhen the replay series went on to become a trilogy, Group SNE had to abandon the Dungeons & Dragons rules and create their own game, dubbed Record of Lodoss War Companion and released in 1989. All three parts of the replay series were eventually published as paperbacks by Kadokawa Shoten from 1989 to 1991, illustrated by Yutaka Izubuchi. They were republished in 1998 under the title .\n*  (November 1989) — Parn's party, retake played according to the Record of Lodoss War Companion rules and incorporating elements from the novelization. Originally serialized from September 1986 to April 1987 issues\n*  (September 1990) — Orson's party, retake played according to the Record of Lodoss War Companion rules and incorporating elements from the novelization. Originally serialized from June 1987 to July 1988 issues\n*  (July 1991) — Spark's party, played according to the Record of Lodoss War Companion rules. Originally serialized from September 1988 to September 1989 issues\nTwo other Record of Lodoss War replay volumes have been published later:\n*  (April 1998) — illustrated by Izubuchi. Originally  serialized in Comtiq from September to December 1997 issues under the title\n*  (October 2020) — illustrated by Retsu Tateo\nThree prequel Legend of Lodoss replay volumes based on a draft by Ryo Mizuno, written by Hiroshi Takayama and Group SNE, with illustrations by Retsu Tateo and Tatsumi Minegishi were published. Before being published as light novels, the first two RPG replays were serialized in Comptiq under the title .\n*  (November 1994) — played according to the Record of Lodoss War Companion rules. Originally serialized from August 1993 to July 1994 issues. A special feature was published in the July 1993 issue\n*  (October 1995) — played according to the Lodoss Island RPG: Basic Rules. Originally serialized from September 1994 to September 1995 issues. A preview was published in the August 1994 issue\n*  (October 1996) — played according to the Lodoss Island RPG: Expert Rules\nMizuno's novelizations were published by Kadokawa Shoten between 1988 and 1993, and followed by two collections of short stories in 1995, ''High Elf Forest: Deedlit's Tale and The Black Knight, all with illustrations done by Izubuchi. The Black Knight was re-released in 1998, with illustrations by Masato Natsumoto. The first volume of the novelizations, The Grey Witch, was published in English by Seven Seas Entertainment in 2018.\n*  (April 1988 (Kadokawa Bunko) / August 1994 (Kadokawa Sneaker Bunko))\n*  (February 1989)\n*  (January 1990)\n*  (June 1990)\n*  (February 1991)\n*  (November 1991)\n*  (March 1993)\n*  (February 1995)\n*  (July 1995 / September 1998)\nThe first volume forms the basis for the first eight episodes of the Record of Lodoss War original video animation (OVA) series, as well as both Record of Lodoss War: The Grey Witch  manga series (by Yoshihiko Ochi and Tomomasa Takuma, respectively). The second was also adapted in manga form by Ayumi Saito, and as a four-CD audio drama. The final five episodes of the OVA series are loosely based on the story told across the third and fourth novels and, having caught up with the ongoing novelization at that point, feature an original ending. The Record of Lodoss War: Chronicles of the Heroic Knight TV series is a more faithful adaptation of volumes three to four and six to seven, with the manga drawn by Masato Natsumoto also adapting from volumes six and seven. The first of two collections of short stories was adapted into the Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit's Tale manga series by Setsuko Yoneyama.\nMizuno later went on to pen other series of novels: an adaptation of  prequel replays (1994 to 2002, five volumes and an extra volume, illustrated by Akihiro Yamada) and sequel novels  (1993 to 1996, four volumes, illustrated by Satoshi Urushihara, part of Legend of Crystania setting) and  (1998 to 2006, six volumes and a prelude volume, illustrated by Izubuchi (first editions of the prelude and the first novel) and Haruhiko Mikimoto); Legend of Lodoss story was also adapted into the Record of Lodoss War: The Lady of Pharis manga series by Yamada and Legend of Crystania was adapted into a radio drama, a manga by Akira Himekawa, an anime film, and OVA series. In 2019, he released a novel sequel '|ロードス島戦記 誓約の宝冠|Rōdosu-tō Senki: Seiyaku no Hōkan}}. The novel takes place 100 years after the events of the original series, with Deedlit as the lead protagonist. It is illustrated by Hidari and was adapted into a manga by Atsushi Suzumi.\nLegend of Lodoss\n*  (August 1994)\n*  (July 1996)\n*  (November 1996) (Two short stories, later included in Eternal Returner)\n*  (April 1997)\n*  (March 1998)\n*  (December 1999) (Four short stories)\n*  (October 2002)\nRecord of Lodoss War Next Generation\n*  (May 1998) (Later included in Inheritors of the Flame)\n*  (August 1998 / July 2001)\n*  (May 1999 / June 2002)\n*  (March 2001)\n*  (November 2001)\n*  (October 2004)\n*  (October 2005)\n*  (November 2006)\nPlot\nList of Record of Lodoss War characters}}\nRecord of Lodoss War'' recounts the adventures of a youth by the name of Parn, the son of a dishonored knight. Part of his motivation for adventuring is to find out what happened to his father and to restore his family's honor. Despite his inexperience, Parn is considered the leader, who is accompanied by his childhood best friend Etoh, his friend and sometimes advisor Slayn (and later by Slayn's lover Leylia), and his newfound mentor Ghim. They are accompanied by Parn's romantic interest, the high elf Deedlit, who comes from the Forest of No Return seeking an answer to her people's isolationism and an end to what she sees as a slow march to extinction; and a thief named Woodchuck. Throughout the series, Parn comes into contact with friends and foes alike. His allies include King Kashue, King Fahn, Shiris, and Orson; his enemies include Emperor Beld, Ashram, and the evil necromancer Wagnard. Volume two jumps forward by two years and sees Parn and Deedlit participate in a civil war in Flaim on the side of King Kashue. It was adapted into a manga and an audio drama with the cast of the OVA.\nVolumes three to seven, all but volume five adapted into the anime Chronicles of the Heroic Knight, continue the adventures of Parn for the first eight episodes, but then focus on Spark and his adventures to complete a quest tasked onto him to protect Neese, the daughter of Slayn and Leylia. He is accompanied by his own cast of friends in the form of Leaf, Garrack, Greevus, Aldo, and Ryna. The television series shares similarities with the plot of the OVA, such as Wagnard seeking to kidnap Neese in order to use her as a reagent for the resurrection of Naneel, a priestess and the avatar of Kardis who was slain by Leylia's mother, the high priestess Neese a short time after the battle with the demonic god. Leylia was the reincarnation of Naneel, but when she lost her virginity she was no longer capable of being the doorway or reagent needed to unseal Naneel. Spark and his fiance Neese remain the protagonists of the Record of Lodoss War Next Generation series and become the rulers of Marmo after Ashram´s group vacates the island.\nThe Legend of Crystania setting places the former villain Ashram into the seat of a would-be hero who is placed under a spell by an \"animal god\" of Crystania. One of the prominent characters is Pirotess, his dark elven lover, as she tries to find a way to free him from the clutches of the spell and restore him to his living self.\nOther media\nVideo games\nRole-playing games:\n* 1988 Record of Lodoss War: Haiiro no Majo (PC 98, PC 88 (1989), MSX (1990), X68000 (1991), FM Towns (1994), Windows 95)\n* 1991 Record of Lodoss War II: Goshiki no Maryu (PC 98, X68000 (1992), FM Towns (1994), Windows 95)\n* 1992 Record of Lodoss War (PC Engine)\n* 1994 Record of Lodoss War II (PC Engine)\n* 1994 Record of Lodoss War: Eiyuu Sensou (Mega-CD)\n* 1995 Record of Lodoss War (SFC), translated by fans in 2014\n* 2000 Record of Lodoss War: Advent of Cardice (Dreamcast), released in English\n* 2021 Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth (Windows and consoles), 2D Metroidvania, released in English\nOther video games:\n* 1989 Record of Lodoss War: Fukujindzuke (PC 98, MSX (1990), X68000 (1991)), fandisc of Haiiro no Majo\n* 1992 Record of Lodoss War: Fukujindzuke 2 (PC 98), fandisc of Goshiki no Maryu\n* 1993 Record of Lodoss War: Fukujindzuke 3 (PC 98), fandisc of Goshiki no Maryu and Sword World PC\n* 1998 Record of Lodoss War: Eiyuu Kishiden (Game Boy Color)\nCompilations:\n* 2004 PC-9801 Game Revival Collection (Windows), compilation of 15 emulated games, among them Haiiro no Majo, Goshiki no Maryu and Sword World PC\n* 2022 Record of Lodoss War Chronicle (Windows), compilation of the nine Lodoss and Sword World games for PC 98 and SFC\nOnline games:\n* 2012 Record of Lodoss War: Successor of the Legend (browser), trading cards game, closed beta released in 2012, shut down in 2014\n* 2016 Record of Lodoss War Online (Windows), MMORPG, released in English in 2017, shut down in 2019 in English and in 2024 in South Korea and Japan\nMusic\nAlbums\n* 1989 Arrange Sound from Record of Lodoss War: The Grey Witch (VDR-28071)\n* 1990 Record of Lodoss War Original Soundtrack Vol. I (VICL-00051 and SLP-85)\n* 1990 Record of Lodoss War Original Soundtrack Vol. II (VICL-00114)\n* 1991 Record of Lodoss War Original Soundtrack Vol. III (VICL-00267)\n* 1992 Symphonic House from Record of Lodoss War II Arrange Sound (VICL-8060)\n* 1993 'Record of Lodoss War: Minstrels' Memory of Lodoss (VICL-8090)\n* 1995 LODOSS (VICL-624)\n* 1996 Record of Lodoss War Original Soundtrack (VICL-2164)\n* 1998 Welcome to Lodoss Island!
