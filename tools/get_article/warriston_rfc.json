Couper, the half-back, who was capped by Edinburgh District in 1873. Couper had moved abroad. They note that he would not easily be replaced. The club had also lost Wren, a forward. The club's new captain was to be R. C. Johnston; and the secretary would be W. P. Johnston.\nDecline\nBy 1937–38 season it was still fielding a Sevens side. In season 1938-39 it was still fielding a XV team. However, there are no reports of a rugby club the following season; and it is likely that the club did not survive the Second World War.\nNotable former players\nScotland internationalists\n{| style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:25%;\"|\n*  Charles Villar\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:25%;\"|\n*  George Paterson\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:25%;\"|\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:25%;\"|\n|}\nEdinburgh District players\nThe following former Warriston players have represented Edinburgh District at provincial level.\n{| style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:20%;\"|\n*  Charles Villar\n*  George Paterson\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:20%;\"|\n*  G.
