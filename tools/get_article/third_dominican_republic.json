De facto the Third Republic ended on 28 April 1965 with the US occupation. This period is also known as the Age of Trujillo, because of the strong influence exerted by the totalitarian and autocratic Trujillo regime over much of these 41 years.\nSee also\n* History of the Dominican Republic\n* First Dominican Republic\n* Second Dominican Republic\n* Vice Presidents of the Dominican Republic (1924–1965)\nReferences"
