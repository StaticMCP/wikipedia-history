In 1931 he received an A.B. (bachelor's) degree in vertebrate zoology from the University of California at Berkeley. In 1947, Gentry received a Ph.D. in botany from the University of Michigan, Dissertation: The Durango Grasslands.\nGentry made his first field trip to the Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico in 1933. He spent most of the next twenty years exploring and recording the plant life of northwestern Mexico.  He worked for the United States Department of Agriculture from 1950 to 1971.  He made botanical field trips to Europe, India and Africa looking for plants that are useful to man. He was a research botanist with the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix, Arizona after 1971. He also collected many of the specimens now at the Huntington Botanical Gardens in San Marino, California.\nHis 1942 study of the plants of the Río Mayo region of northwestern Mexico became a classic for the extent of its coverage of a previously little-known area.\nIn addition to purely botanical work, he was interested in ethnobotany, and his plant descriptions include information about their uses by indigenous peoples.\nWorks\n* Río Mayo Plants of Sonora-Chihuahua (1942), later updated posthumously as ''Gentry's Rio Mayo Plants (University of Arizona Press, 1998)\n* The Agave Family of Sonora (USDA, 1972)\n* The Agaves of Baja California (California Academy of Sciences, 1978)\n* Agaves of Continental North America'' (University of Arizona Press, 1982)\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Cunningham, Isabel S. \"Howard Scott Gentry: agriculture's renaissance man.\" Diversity 11 (1987): 23–24.\n* Erickson, Jim. \"Botanist, agave expert Howard S.
