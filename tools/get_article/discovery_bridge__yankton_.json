The Discovery Bridge connects Yankton, South Dakota, with rural Cedar County, Nebraska.\nThe ribbon-cutting ceremony was on October 11, 2008, a year ahead of schedule. During the ceremony John McAuliffe and Kevin Brown inadvertently cut the ribbon prior to photographers being in place and thus there is no commemorative photo. The bridge crosses over the Missouri National Recreational River, a Federally-protected Wild & Scenic River, managed by the National Park Service\nThe Yankton SD Chamber of Commerce held a public contest to name the new bridge. The winning nomination would be the first public person to cross the bridge in a car the day of the bridge dedication.\nMore than 300 names were submitted. The public was then asked to vote their choice from 10 finalists.\nThe Discovery Bridge was the winning name submitted by David Spencer of Yankton, SD. The name is a reference to the Lewis and Clark expedition which was called the Corps of Discovery.\nHistory\nConstruction began on the Discovery Bridge in June 2007. The bridge then opened on October 11, 2008, which was exactly 84 years after the dedication of the Meridian Highway Bridge. Now completed, the Discovery Bridge serves as a replacement for the Meridian Highway Bridge, which is about  downstream.[http://www.nebraskatransportation.org/projects/yankton/index.htm Nebraska Department of Roads]\nThe bridge was a finalist in the 2009 America's Transportation Awards for \"representing the best in innovative management, accountability and timeliness\".\nSee also\n*\n*\n*\n* List of crossings of the Missouri River\n* Missouri River\n* Missouri National Recreational River\n* Gavins Point Dam\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.nebraskatransportation.org/history/yankton/index.htm Nebraska Department of Roads Yankton Bridge History Page]"
