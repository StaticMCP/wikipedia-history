Spain was just one of the many countries which resisted the expansion of the French Empire under Napoleon I. The general population fought as guerrillas, preventing the occupying French forces from obtaining supplies or safe passage.\nLine Infantry\nThe Spanish Line Infantry uniform changed several times during the Napoleonic wars. Initially beginning with state supplied clothing, locally produced, or war spoils. After 1811, the British began supplying supplies of their own.\nThe M1797 uniform was officially listed as being white with collars, cuffs and facings according in the regimental facing colours and distinguished by their pattern combination. 3 regiments were recorded as still wearing this uniform as late as May 1808.\nThe M1802 uniform consisted of a dark blue coat, black facings with red piping, and white trousers. The bicorne remained the same as the previous M1797 uniform, having a red plume and cockade. Additionally, the collar featured 2 Fleur-de-lys on each side. 12 Regiments were recorded to have been using this uniform as late as May 1808.\nThe unpopular M1802 uniform was replaced by the M1805, which restored the white coats and distinctive regimental colours of the M1797 uniform. These were used to distinguish between regiments, by a combination of cuffs, collars and facings in either facing colour piped white or white piped with the facing colour. Buttons were also used, either pewter or brass. Turnbacks on the jackets were always white, piped with facing colours.\nThe Grenadiers' uniforms were nearly identical to that of the Fusiliers', but with a few distinctive features; the cuffs featured bars known as \"Sardines\", and featured flaming grenades in facing colours on the turnbacks. The Bearskin was either brown or black, and featured a long cloth device (sleeve) in facing colour with the regimental or provincial emblem and embroidery in button colour.\nUniforms Issued\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

A green jacket with yellow lace, red collars and cuffs with the Suhr (a type of leather & brass hat) replacing the bicorn for ordinary ranks.\nThe M1805 uniform returned to the bicorn, styled after the infantry uniform the colour of the jacket was changed to dark blue, with facing colours, combinations and button colour depending on regiment.\nIn 1808 some regiments were issued with French style shakos, including La Romana's division de norte. It is unclear which regiments, if any, in Spain were issued with shakos.\nUniforms Issued\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Regiment !! Collar !! Cuffs !! Lapel !! Turnback !! Pockets !!

Bicorns edged yellow with red plumes. Dark blue coats with white lapels piped red, crimson facings (collars, cuffs and turn-backs) with blue cuff flaps piped red and yellow lions on their collars. Waist coats and trousers were batched dyed a lemon colour, however this quickly bleached in the sun. The jacket used brass buttons, much like the infantry uniform of the time. The cavalry were issued long boots and blue breeches re-enforced with leather.\nHorses were rare in Spain during the war, but those which could be located were issued with blue saddleclothes laced with yellow.\nM1805 Uniforms Issued\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
