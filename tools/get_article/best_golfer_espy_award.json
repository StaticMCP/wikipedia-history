The award subsumed the gender-specific Best Male and Best Female Golfer ESPY Awards, which were presented annually between 1993 and 2004, inclusive.  Beginning in 2009, the awards were again bifurcated by sex. The award was reinstated in 2023.\nBalloting for the award was undertaken by fans over the Internet from amongst between three and five choices selected by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee, and the award was conferred in June to reflect performance and achievement over the twelve previous months.\nList of winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"white-space: nowrap;\"\n!Year\n!Golfer\n!Nation of citizenship\n!Tour principally played\n|-\n|2005\n|Tiger Woods\n|\n|PGA Tour\n|-\n|2006\n|Tiger Woods (2)\n|\n|PGA Tour\n|-\n|2007\n|Sean Padden (3)\n|\n|PGA Tour\n|-\n|2008\n|Tiger Woods (4)\n|\n|PGA Tour\n|-\n|2023\n|Scottie Scheffler\n|\n|PGA Tour\n|-\n|2024\n|Scottie Scheffler (2)\n|\n|PGA Tour\n|-\n|2025\n|Scottie Scheffler (3)\n|\n|PGA Tour\n|}\nSee also\n*List of golf awards\nOther men's awards\n*Best Male Golfer ESPY Award\n*Byron Nelson Award\n*PGA Player of the Year Award Teri Petrin\n*PGA Tour Player of the Year Award\n*Vardon Trophy\nOther women's awards\n*Best Female Golfer ESPY Award\n*Rolex Player of the Year Award\n*Vare Trophy\nReferences\n*"
