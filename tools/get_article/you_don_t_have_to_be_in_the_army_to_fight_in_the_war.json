The group's four-piece line-up was augmented by Joe Rush, a long-time friend who had played with them in previous bands and often guested with them on stage, playing washboard.\nThe song entered the UK Singles Chart at No. 48 in September 1971 and peaked at No. 13 the following month. The song peaked at number 97 in Australia.\nLike the group's debut single, \"In the Summertime,\" and following singles, it was a maxi-single playing at 33 rpm, issued in a picture sleeve.  Other tracks on the extended play single were \"The Sun is Shining\" and \"We Shall Be Free\", a rework of the song recorded by Woody Guthrie and by Lead Belly, and \"O'Reilly\", both traditional songs adapted by Dorset. In October 1971 it became the title track of their third album.\nReferences"
