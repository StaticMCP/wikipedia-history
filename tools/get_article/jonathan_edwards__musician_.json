At the age of six, he moved with his family to Virginia, where he grew up. At the age of eight, he began singing in church and learning to play piano by ear. While attending Fishburne Military School, he began playing guitar and composing his own songs. As a teenager he began performing in front of audiences.\nWhile studying art at Ohio University, he became a fixture at local clubs, playing with a variety of rock, folk, and blues bands.\nCareer\nIn 1967, he and his band moved to Boston and played clubs throughout New England. With Joe Dolce on lead guitar, they played cover tunes as well as their own country-blues originals under various names, including the Headstone Circus, St. James Doorknob, and the Finite Minds, and they made an album for Metromedia Records as Sugar Creek.\nIn the early 1970s, Edwards left the band and began performing as a solo acoustic artist. He would later recall:\nEdwards began opening for acts such as the Allman Brothers Band and B.B. King. He signed with Capricorn Records to record his first album, Jonathan Edwards (1971).\nLike most of the songs on Jonathan Edwards, \"Sunshine\" was written shortly after Edwards left the band. \"I felt really fresh, really liberated,\" he later recalled. \"I just went out in the woods every day with my bottle of wine and guitar, sat by a lake near Boston and wrote down all those tunes, day after day.\" Regarding the theme of \"Sunshine\", Edwards commented, \"It was just at the time of the Vietnam War and Nixon. It was looking bad out there. That song meant a lot to a lot of people during that time—especially me.\" \"Sunshine\" reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in January 1972.\nFollowing the release of his debut album, Edwards moved out of the city to a farm in western Massachusetts, which provided the rural, country inspiration for his second album, Honky-Tonk Stardust Cowboy on the Atlantic Records label. This was an album of mostly self-penned acoustic, country-flavored songs about love and life and was closely followed by Have a Good Time For Me, also on Atlantic.\nIn 1973 he and his friends got together to record a live album called Lucky Day, named after a song he wrote in the truck on his way up to live in Nova Scotia. This \"fresh-air break\" lasted only a couple of months when his friend Emmylou Harris invited him to Los Angeles to sing backup on her album Elite Hotel. That led to a deal with Warner Bros. Records and two albums produced by Harris' husband/producer Brian Ahern: ''Rockin' Chair and Sailboat.\nIn 1979, Edwards moved back to the United States to New Hampshire, and then two years later back to Northern Virginia area where he had grown up. In 1983, he produced and recorded Blue Ridge'' with the bluegrass band, The Seldom Scene, for Sugar Hill Records. Then in 1987 he recorded a children's album, Little Hands, which was released on the small independent American Melody label. It was selected by the American Library Association as a Notable Children's Recording.\nTurning to acting, Edwards toured as the lead in the Broadway musical Pump Boys and Dinettes. When the show reached Nashville, he met an old friend from the folk circuit, Wendy Waldman. She and Mike Robertson convinced Edwards to come to town and record a country album. \"I've been making country-sounding records all my life, but never in Nashville. Yeah, let's do it.\" Edwards said. So, The Natural Thing was produced, recorded, and released on MCA/Curb Records in 1989. \"I was crazy about the songs we selected from those great Nashville writers, and the acoustic-based production that Wendy and I put together was just a joy to make and to listen to. I count that as one of the best albums I've ever been involved with.\"\nIn the 1990s, Edwards continued to tour, doing session work, and producing his own music as well as that of other talents, such as Cheryl Wheeler (\"Driving Home,\" \"Mrs. Pinocci's Guitar\"). He took part in the 1994 \"Back to the Future\" tour that also included Don McLean, Tom Rush, Jesse Colin Young, Steve Forbert and Al Stewart. In 1994 he released One Day Closer, his first solo album in five years, on his new record label, Rising Records. Man in the Moon, which includes several of Edwards' original songs, followed the end of 1997. In September 1997, Rising Records released a remixed, re-sequenced Among Us, a CD by Simon Townshend, younger brother of the Who's Pete Townshend. Edwards also scored the soundtrack for The Mouse, starring John Savage.\nIn 2001, Edwards celebrated 30 years of \"Sunshine\" with a First Annual Farewell Tour with Kenny White on piano. In the 2000s, Edwards narrated and performed in a travel series for Media Artists entitled ''Cruising America's Waterways, which was purchased by PBS. Media Artists also released a companion album. Edwards participated in a second series, which started running on PBS-TV stations in May 2004.\nIn 2008, Edwards appeared in the romantic comedy film The Golden Boys, starring Bruce Dern, David Carradine, Charles Durning, Mariel Hemingway, and Rip Torn. Set in Cape Cod in 1905, the film featured Edwards in the role of Reverend Perley. In addition to acting, Edwards scored the film.\nIn the fall of 2012, he appeared with Michael Martin Murphey in a series of concerts throughout New England. He continues to tour both solo and with band members Tom Snow, Rick Brodsky, Rob Duquette and Joe K. Walsh.\nEdwards lives in Portland, Maine.\nDiscography\nAlbums\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n! width=\"5%\"| Year\n! width=\"30%\"| Title\n! width=\"15%\"| Label\n! width=\"30%\"| Notes\n|-\n|1971\n|Jonathan Edwards\n|Capricorn\n|\n* #40 in Australia.\n|-\n|1972\n|Honky-Tonk Stardust Cowboy\n|Atco\n|\n|-\n|1973\n|Have a Good Time for Me\n|Atco\n|\n|-\n|1974\n|Lucky Day\n|Atco\n|Live album\n|-\n|1976\n|Rockin' Chair\n|Reprise\n|\n|-\n|1977\n|Sailboat\n|Warner Bros.\n|\n|-\n|1980\n|Live!\n|Chronic\n|Live album\n|-\n|1985\n|Blue Ridge\n|Sugar Hill\n|With The Seldom Scene\n|-\n|1987\n|Little Hands\n|American Melody\n|\n|-\n|1987\n| Grandma’s Patchwork Quilt\n| American Melody\n| him on 2 tracks, Cathy Fink on 3 tracks, John McCutcheon on 2 tracks, Larry Penn on 2 tracks, Phil Rosenthal on 1 track, and Naomi Rosenthal on 1 track\n|-\n|1989\n|The Natural Thing\n|MCA\n|\n|-\n|1994\n|One Day Closer\n|Rising Records\n|\n|-\n|1998\n|Man in the Moon\n|Rising Records\n|\n|-\n|2001\n|Cruising America's Waterways\n|\n|Live album\n|-\n|2006\n|Live in Massachusetts\n|Rising Records\n|Live album\n|-\n|2009\n|Rollin' Along: Live in Holland\n|Strictly Country\n|Live album\n|-\n|2011\n|My Love Will Keep\n|Appleseed Recordings\n|Studio album\n|-\n|2015\n|Tomorrow's Child\n|Rising Records\n|\n|-\n|2015\n|Top 40\n|Rising Records\n|Original recordings digitally remastered by Pat Keane Mastering\n|-\n|2021\n|Right Where I Am\n|Rising Records\n|Mixed by Todd Hutchisen, Acadia Recording Company\n|}\nSingles\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:22em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"6\"| Peak positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| US\n! width=\"45\"| US AC\n! width=\"45\"| US Country\n! width=\"45\"|AUS\n! width=\"45\"| CAN\n! width=\"45\"| CAN AC\n|-\n| 1971\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Sunshine\"\n| 4\n| 7\n| —\n| 45\n| 3\n| 11\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"2\"| Jonathan Edwards\n|-\n| 1972\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Train of Glory\" / \"Everybody Knows Her\"\n| 101\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| 70\n| —\n|-\n| 1973\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Stop and Start It All Again\"\n| 112\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| align=\"left\"| Honky-Tonk Stardust Cowboy\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1988\n! scope=\"row\"| \"We Need to Be Locked Away\"\n| —\n| —\n| 64\n| —\n| —\n| —\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"4\"| The Natural Thing''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Look What We Made (When We Made Love)\"\n| —\n| —\n| 56\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n| 1989\n! scope=\"row\"| \"It's a Natural Thing\"\n| —\n| —\n| 59\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n| 1990\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Listen to the Radio\"\n| —\n| —\n| 82\n| —\n| —\n| —\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|}\nVideos\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
