F. Foster, is an Irish historian and academic. He was the Carroll Professor of Irish History from 1991 until 2016 at Hertford College, Oxford.\nEarly life\nFoster was born on 16 January 1949 in Waterford, to two teachers: Betty Foster (née Fitzroy), a primary teacher, and 'Fef' (Frederick) Ernest Foster, a teacher of Irish. His father, Fef, was a native of Drung, a tiny hamlet and parish located between Cavan Town and Cootehill in County Cavan where Roy's grandfather Frederick Foster signed the Ulster Covenant in 1912. Roy attended Newtown School in Waterford, a multi-denominational school that was founded as a Quaker school in 1798. He won a scholarship to attend St. Andrew's School in Delaware for a year before reading history at Trinity College Dublin. He was awarded an M.A. and PhD by Trinity College, where he was taught by T. W. Moody and F. S. L. Lyons, and was elected a scholar in History and Political Science in 1969.\nAcademic career\nPrior to his appointment to the Carroll professorship, he was Professor of Modern British History at Birkbeck College, University of London, and held visiting fellowships at St Antony's College, Oxford, the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, and Princeton University. Based in London as well as at Hertford College in Oxford, Foster visits Ireland frequently. His work is generally published under the name R. F. Foster.\nHe has written early biographies of Charles Stewart Parnell and Lord Randolph Churchill, edited The Oxford History of Ireland (1989), and written Modern Ireland: 1600–1972 (1988) and several books of essays. He collaborated with Fintan Cullen on a National Portrait Gallery exhibition, Conquering England: the Irish in Victorian London.  Foster produced a much-acclaimed two-part biography of W. B. Yeats, which was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize.  Seamus Deane wrote a review of the biography in which he quoted the last line of Yeats' poem The Municipal Gallery Revisited: \"My glory was that I had such friends\", and stated that Yeats was also lucky to have Foster as his biographer.\nIn 2000, Foster was a Booker Prize judge.\nPersonal life\nHe has been married to the novelist and critic Aisling Foster (née O'Conor Donelan) since 1972; the couple have two children.\nHonours\nIn 1989, he was elected Fellow of the British Academy (FBA)  and in 2010 he was elected an Honorary Member of the Royal Irish Academy (Hon.
