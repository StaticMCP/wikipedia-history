He was noted for being a founder and artistic director of the Negro Ensemble Company (NEC).  He was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play in 1974 for his role in The River Niger, which he also directed.\nEarly life\nWard was born Roosevelt Ward Jr. in Burnside, Louisiana, on May 5, 1930.  His parents, Roosevelt Ward and Dorothy (Short), were poor farmers who also owned a tailoring business.  They relocated to New Orleans when Ward was eight years old, and he went to Xavier University Preparatory School.  He was accepted by Wilberforce University in 1946, before transferring to the University of Michigan.  He majored in politics and theater, but dropped out of college at the age of 19 and relocated to New York City.  There, he became friends with Lorraine Hansberry and Lonne Elder III.\nWard became a member of the Progressive Party at the end of the 1940s and aligned himself on the left of the political spectrum.  He was imprisoned in New Orleans while appealing his conviction for draft evasion.  After his conviction was reversed, he returned to New York and worked as a reporter for the Daily Worker.  Ward also joined the Paul Mann Actors Workshop to study theater.  He subsequently adopted the stage name Douglas Turner Ward, a tribute to his two role models: Frederick Douglass and Nat Turner.\nCareer\nAs an actor, Turner made one of his first performances in The Iceman Cometh by Eugene O'Neill in 1956, at the Circle in the Square Theatre.  Three years later, he made his Broadway debut in a small role in A Raisin in the Sun, alongside Sidney Poitier and Claudia McNeil.  His first significant artistic achievement would be as a playwright, however.\nHappy Ending/Day of Absence, a program of two one-act plays, premiered at the St. Mark's Playhouse in Manhattan on November 15, 1965.  It ultimately ran for 504 performances over 15 months, enduring through the 1966 transit strike.  That same year, Ward authored an opinion piece in The New York Times titled \"American Theater: For Whites Only?\"  The piece garnered a grant from W. McNeil Lowry of the Ford Foundation. He later received his first Drama Desk Award for outstanding new playwright.\nWard was one of the founders of the Negro Ensemble Company in 1967, and served for many years as its artistic director.   It notably produced The River Niger (1972), which won the Tony Award for Best Play in 1974 and was adapted as a film of the same name two years later.  Ward himself acted in and directed that play, receiving a nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Play.  The company also produced Home (1979) by Samm-Art Williams and ''A Soldier's Play (1981) by Charles Fuller.  The latter won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama and was adapted into the film A Soldier's Story.\nWard was enshrined into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1996.  He was also conferred the Martin Luther King Jr. Humanitarian Award.  He published The Haitian Chronicles in March 2020, having worked on the three-play series for around four decades.  He viewed the series, which focused on the Haitian Revolution, as his magnum opus and intended to have it staged by NEC alumni.\nPersonal life\nWard married Diana Powell Ward in 1966.  Together, they had two children: Elizabeth Ward–Cuprill and Douglas Powell Ward.\nWard died on February 20, 2021, at his home in Manhattan.  He was 90.\nSelected credits\nTheatre\nDirecting\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Production\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Theatre(s)\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Notes\n|-\n|1982\n|A Soldier's Play''\n|Lucille Lortel Theatre\n|Drama Desk Award nomination\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1980\n|Zooman and the Sign\n|Theatre Four\n|\n|-\n|1979\n|Home\n|St. Mark's Playhouse\n|\n|-\n|1975\n|The First Breeze of Summer\n|St. Mark's Playhouse\n|\n|-\n|1972\n|The River Niger\n|St. Mark's Playhouse\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1970\n|Day of Absence\n|St. Mark's Playhouse\n|Part of a program of two one-act plays with Brotherhood\n|-\n|Brotherhood\n|St. Mark's Playhouse\n|Part of a program of two one-act plays with Day of Absence\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1968\n|Daddy Goodness\n|St. Mark's Playhouse\n|\n|}\nWriting\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Production\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Theatre(s)\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Notes\n|-\n|1983\n|The Redeemer\n|Theatre Four\n|Part of a program of three one-act plays, entitled About Heaven and Earth\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1970\n|Day of Absence\n|St. Mark's Playhouse\n|Part of a program of two one-act plays with Brotherhood\n|-\n|Brotherhood\n|St. Mark's Playhouse\n|Part of a program of two one-act plays with Day of Absence\n|-\n|1969\n|The Reckoning\n|St. Mark's Playhouse\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1965\n|Day of Absence\n|St. Mark's Playhouse\n|Part of a program of two one-act plays with Happy Ending\n|-\n|Happy Ending\n|St. Mark's Playhouse\n|Part of a program of two one-act plays with Day of Absence\n|}\nActing\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Production\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Role\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Theatre(s)\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Notes\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1983\n|Tigus\n|Tigus\n|Theatre Four\n|Part of a program of three one-act plays, entitled About Heaven and Earth\n|-\n|1975\n|The First Breeze of Summer\n|Harper Edwards\n|St. Mark's Playhouse\n|\n|-\n|1972\n|The River Niger\n|Johnny Williams\n|St. Mark's PlayhouseBrooks Atkinson Theatre\n|Obie Award, Distinguished PerformanceTony Award nomination, Best Featured Actor in a Play\n|-\n|1969\n|Ceremonies in Dark Old Men\n|Mr. Russell B.
