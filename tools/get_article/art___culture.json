Founded by Sujit Wongthes in 1979, the magazine popularized Thai history and opened up the field—previously confined to academic circles—to a wider public audience.\nWriters associated with the magazine, most prominently Sujit, , and Dhida Saraya, challenged the established narrative of Thai history that emphasized the migration of the Tai peoples from southern China. Instead, they highlighted the diversity of Thailand’s cultural origins.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
