The band frequently changes its line-up, and its records often include guest appearances. The only permanent member of the band is founder Josh Homme, with guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen having been a member since the release of the band's third studio album, Songs for the Deaf, in 2002. Bassist Michael Shuman and keyboardist and guitarist Dean Fertita both joined the band in 2007 to tour in support of its fifth studio album, Era Vulgaris (2007). In 2013, Queens of the Stone Age recorded the album ...Like Clockwork (2013) and Jon Theodore joined as permanent drummer the following year.\nHistory\nQueens of the Stone Age was founded by Homme after the breakup of Kyuss, under the name Gamma Ray. This new band released a self titled EP. featuring Matt Cameron of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, Van Conner from Screaming Trees, and percussionist Victor Indrizzo.\nAfter German band Gamma Ray threatened to sue over the name, Homme changed it to Queens of the Stone Age. The band's first live appearance was on November 20, 1997, at OK Hotel in Seattle, with Cameron on drums, Mike Johnson of Dinosaur Jr. on bass and John McBain of Monster Magnet on guitar. Queens of the Stone Age released their self-titled debut in 1998. Homme played most instruments with Alfredo Hernández contributing drums.\nSoon after the recording sessions were finished for the album, former Kyuss bassist Nick Oliveri joined the group, and touring commenced with a band consisting entirely of ex-Kyuss members. Dave Catching, a former Kyuss guitar tech, joined shortly after. From this point forward, the band's line-up would change frequently; by the time their second album was being recorded, Hernández had left the group to play in other bands.\nGene Trautmann joined as Hernández's replacement, playing on Rated R (2000) alongside Homme, Oliveri and Catching. Brendon McNichol replaced Catching for touring. Mark Lanegan joined the band in 2001 as vocalist. Dave Grohl replaced Trautmann in late 2001, in time for recording Songs for the Deaf (2002). Troy Van Leeuwen replaced McNichol after the albums release.\nMid-way through touring, Grohl was replaced by Joey Castillo. After the tour finished in 2004, Oliveri was fired by Homme, his initial replacement was guitar tech Dan Druff, before Alain Johannes joined full-time in 2005, alongside Natasha Shneider on keyboards. Lanegan left in 2005. Following a tour in 2006, Shneider also left, followed by Johannes in 2007. Their replacements were Dean Fertita and Michael Shuman respectively.\nCastillo left the band in 2012, mid-way through the recording of ...Like Clockwork (2013). He was replaced by Grohl for the remaining sessions, with Jon Theodore joining as the band's permanent drummer the following year.\nMembers\nCurrent members\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Images\n!Name\n!Years active\n!Instruments\n!Release contributions\n|-\n|\n|Josh Homme\n|1996–present\n|\n|all Queens of the Stone Age releases\n|-\n|\n|Troy Van Leeuwen\n|2002–present\n|\n|All Queens of the Stone Age releases from Lullabies to Paralyze (2005) onwards\n|-\n|\n|Michael Shuman\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2007–present\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|Dean Fertita\n|\n|-\n|\n|Jon Theodore\n|2013–present\n|\n|\n|}\nFormer members\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Images\n!Name\n!Years active\n!Instruments\n!Release contributions\n|-\n|\n|Alfredo Hernández\n|1998–1999\n|drums\n|Queens of the Stone Age (1998)\n|-\n|\n|Dave Catching\n|1998–2000\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Gene Trautmann\n|1999–2001\n|drums\n|\n|-\n|\n|Nick Oliveri\n|1998–2004\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Mark Lanegan\n|2001–2005\n|}}\n|Rated R (2000), Songs for the Deaf (2002), Lullabies to Paralyze (2005), Era Vulgaris (2007), ...Like Clockwork (2013)\n|-\n|\n|Dave Grohl\n|2001–2002\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|\n|-\n|\n|Joey Castillo\n|2002–2012\n|\n|-\n|\n|Alain Johannes B-sides, under the moniker \"The Exotic Pets\", with Josh Homme.
