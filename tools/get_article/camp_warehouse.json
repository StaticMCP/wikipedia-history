It was located 10&nbsp;km east of Kabul, Kabul Province in Afghanistan. Initially constructed by German soldiers, Camp Warehouse was a major coordination centre for ISAF, hosting detachments from multiple countries. The base was used to co-ordinate multi-national forces in and around Kabul hosting equipment from a large number of countries in the multi-national force, as well as maintaining an ISAF Signal Operations Centre used for managing ISAF air sorties and patrols.\nCamp Warehouse was additionally the site of the German built Camp Warehouse Field Hospital, run by the Multinational Medical Task Force. The hospital operated on more than 600 Afghan men, women and children.\nHistory\nThe facility was largely abandoned following the drawdown of ISAF forces in 2014. Following the Fall of Kabul to the Taliban in 2021, the status of Camp Warehouse is unknown, but is presumed to be abandoned.\nGarrison information\nFormer occupants\n* Austria\n* Bulgaria\n* Canada\n* Croatia\n* Netherlands\n* [Norway, or] Norwegian soldiers from Forsvarets Spesialkommando and Norwegian Intelligence Service had a base within Camp Warehouse.\n* France\n* Germany\n* Georgia\n* Hungary\n* Portugal\n* Turkey\n* Finland\n* Denmark\nCurrent use\nThe current use of Camp Warehouse is unknown following the capture of Kabul by Taliban forces.
