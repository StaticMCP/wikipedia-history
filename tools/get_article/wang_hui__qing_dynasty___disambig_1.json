He, and the three other Wangs, dominated orthodox art in China throughout the late Ming and early Qing periods. Of the Four Wangs, Wang Hui is considered the best-known today.\nBeijing, Shanghai and Taipei museums loaned works for \"Landscapes Clear and Radiant: The Art of Wang Hui (1632-1717)\" in 2008 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.\nBiography\nWang Hui followed in the footprints of his great-grandfathers, grandfather, father and uncles and learned painting at a very early age.  He was later taught by two contemporary masters, Zhang Ke and Wang Shimin, who taught him to work in the tradition of copying famous Chinese paintings.\nGallery\nImage:thousandpeaks.jpg|Wang Hui, A Thousand Peaks and Myriad Ravines 1693\nImage:Wang Hui, landscape painting.jpg|Wang Hui, (need title)\nImage:Wang Hui 001.jpg|Wang Hui, Thousand miles along the Jangtse 1700\nImage:Wang Hui, Mountains, Streams and Autumn Trees.jpg|Wang Hui, Mountains, Streams, and Autumn Trees\nImage:Wang Hui6.jpg|Wang Hui, Hut in the autumn rain\nImage:Wang Hui10.jpg|Wang Hui, Fisherman Huts and Clearing Skies in Autumn\nImage:WangHui-TheBeautyOfGreenMountainsAndRivers-ShanghaiMuseum-May27-08.jpg|The Beauty of Green Mountains and Rivers 1679\nFile:Arbre en automne et corneilles 1712 par le peintre chinois Wang Hui.jpg|Tree in Autumn and Crows, dated 1712\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.npm.gov.tw/en/Article.aspx?sNo=04000984 Wang Hui in the collection of the National Palace Museum, Taipei]\n*[http://www.metmuseum.org/search-results?ft=wang+hui&x=0&y=0 Wang Hui in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum, New York]"
