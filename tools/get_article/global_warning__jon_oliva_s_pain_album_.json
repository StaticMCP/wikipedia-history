      "text": "# Global Warning (Jon Oliva's Pain album)\n\nGlobal Warning is a 2008 release by Jon Oliva's Pain. It is the band's third studio release. The record reached number 11 in the German MRC Rock Radio Charts during March 2008.\nOn February 7, 2008, the initial track list of the album was posted at the band's forums. On February 8, five song samples from said track list were posted on the band's MySpace page. In support of the album, the band announced a tour of the United States and Europe, with support on the European dates coming from Manticora and Masterstroke. The US tour was scheduled with support from Circle II Circle and Manticora. The tour with both JOP and CIIC would mean that Jon Oliva and Zachary Stevens were on the same bill for the first time since Savatage's 1999 tour.\nThe record features a guest appearance by Ralph Santolla on two tracks: \"Adding the Cost\" and \"You Never Know\". The track \"Before I Hang\" is made up of two previous Savatage songs—the original \"Before I Hang\" (of which a demo was released on The Dungeons Are Calling Silver Edition in 2002) as well as Streets lost track \"Larry Elbows\". The album also features a tribute to the band's former producer, Greg Marchak, who died prior to the album's release, entitled \"O to G\".\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n*Jon Oliva – lead vocals, keyboards, guitars\n*Matt LaPorte – guitars\n*Kevin Rothney – bass\n*John Zahner – keyboards\n*Christopher Kinder – drums\n;Additional musicians\n*Ralph Santolla – guitars (on \"Adding the Cost\" and \"You Never Know\")\nFurther credits\n* Recorded at Morrisound Studios and Shabbey Road Studios\n* Produced by Christopher Kinder and Jon Oliva\n* Co-produced by Tom Morris, Matt LaPorte and Jim Morris\n* Engineered by Tom Morris and Christopher Kinder\n* Assistant engineer: Jason Blackerby\n* Mixed by Jim Morris\n* Mastered by Jim Morris and Christopher Kinder\n* Spiritual and technical guidance: Greg \"Super G\" Marchak and Criss Oliva\n* Photography by Kim Grillo\n* Artwork design by Thomas Ewerhard\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.myspace.com/jonoliva Jon Oliva's Pain's] at MySpace (with track samples of the album posted)"
