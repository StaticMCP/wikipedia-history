The theme music was composed by Don Partridge and played in his 'one-man-band' style.\nDick Vosburgh prepared material spoofing Jimmy Young for the show.\nTerry Gilliam created animations using cut-outs, a technique he later used in ''Monty Python's Flying Circus. The series was live. Its debut broadcast was scheduled for 2 August 1968. Although the cast performed, only the first 15 seconds of the first show were transmitted, due to an industrial action (other, prerecorded programming was unaffected by the labour dispute).\nThere are no known recordings of its 12 episodes.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.tv.com/shows/we-have-ways-of-making-you-laugh/ tv.com listing]"
