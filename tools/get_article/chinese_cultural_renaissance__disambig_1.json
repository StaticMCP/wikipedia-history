The Chinese Cultural Revival Movement was an ideological and cultural movement launched by the Government of the Republic of China with the aim of reviving Chinese culture, in order to maintain traditional Chinese culture and carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the Three Principles of the People  and to contend with the Cultural Revolution movement of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to show that the true Republic of China is the representative of orthodox Chinese culture. In November 1966, 1,500 people—including Sun Ke, Wang Yunwu, Chen Lifu, Chen Qitian, Kong Decheng, and Zhang Zhiben—wrote a letter to the Executive Yuan: the \"Chinese Cultural Revival Movement\" was proposed and the \"Chinese Cultural Revival Festival\" was designated as occurring on November 12 each year.

The Government of the Republic of China then raised the banner of reviving Chinese culture, in an attempt to establish itself as the successor and defender of Chinese culture.\nAims and objectives of the movement\n* Taking ethics and morality as the foundation of a virtuous society.

Keep political initiatives on track. The Legislative Yuan should be able to exercise its powers freely, so that the effectiveness of the law can be eternal, establishing the rule of law under the rule of the people.\n* The ultimate goal of using science and technology as a moral principle for the benefit of the people.

What are the achievements? Society has its fair judgment. But here it is necessary to say:\n** First, the cultural revival has been guided along the correct lines. Ethics, democracy, and science are the cornerstone of Chinese culture and the essence of the Three Principles of the People. To revive Chinese culture, we must practice the Three Principles of the People.\n** Second, the cultural renaissance has promoted the flourishing of culture. In the past, foreigners called Taiwan a cultural desert. Now, Taiwan has a variety of cultural activities: books and periodical printing, lectures, symposiums, viewing parties, exhibitions, etc., held almost every day, visible at any time.\n** Third, cultural revival has elevated our country's cultural reputation and status. Internationally, Taiwan is regarded as the richest place to preserve the fine traditional culture of China, which has increased the admiration and reverence of international scholars for Taiwan, and even their love for Taiwan, which has increased the number of tourists to Taiwan.\n* Mou Zongsan: \"National cultural and spiritual education\", like other aspects of education, is \"material\" and \"teaching\". There is no \"spirit\" at all. Naturally, it cannot be called \"education\".\nSee also\n* History of the Kuomintang cultural policy\n* May Fourth Movement\n* Zoulu (culture)\n* Chiangism\n* Revitalize China → The Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\n* Chinese culture\n* Culture of the Republic of China\n* New Life Movement\nThe opposite cultural movement in China\n* Before 1949: New Culture Movement, complete Westernization\n* After 1949:\n* Chinese mainland: Cultural Revolution, Breaking the Four Olds, Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius\n* Taiwan: De-Sinicization, Taiwan Localization Movement\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://ap6.pccu.edu.tw/encyclopedia/data.asp?id=230&forepage=1 Chinese Cultural Revival Movement]  ()\n* [https://www.gacc.org.tw/TW/ Chinese Cultural Federation] ()"
