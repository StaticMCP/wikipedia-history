Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, does not bestow a national championship, instead that title is bestowed by one or more different selectors.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Increase in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFE6E6; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Decrease in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFFFE6; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Not ranked previous week\n|-\n| style=\"background:#9cf; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\"|\n| &nbsp;\n| National champion\n|-\n|\n| &nbsp;\n| Win–loss record\n|-\n|\n| &nbsp;\n| Number of first place votes\n|-\n|\n|\n| Tied with team above or below also with this symbol\n|}\nChampions (by ranking)\nMost major rankings (both contemporary and retroactive) have found Pittsburgh to have been the 1937 national champion. However, two major rankings (the contemporary Dunkel and retroactive Helms rankings) instead find California to have been the champion.\n*AP poll: Pittsburgh\n*Berryman QPRS: Pittsburgh\n*Billingsley Report: Pittsburgh\n*Boand System: Pittsburgh\n*College Football Researchers Association: Pittsburgh\n*Dickinson System: Pittsburgh\n*Dunkel System: California\n*Helms Athletic Foundation: California\n*Houlgate System: Pittsburgh\n*Litkenhous Ratings: Pittsburgh\n*National Championship Foundation: Pittsburgh\n*Poling System: Pittsburgh\n*Sagarin Ratings Elo chess method: Pittsburgh\n*Sagarin Ratings Predictor method: Pittsburgh\n*Williamson System: Pittsburgh\nNote: AP poll, Boand System, Dickinson System, Dunkel System, Houlgate System, Litkenhous Ratings, Poling System, and Williamson System were given contemporarily. All other methods were given retroactively.\nAP Poll\nThe final AP Poll was released on November 29, at the end of the 1937 regular season, weeks before the major bowls. The AP would not release a post-bowl season final poll regularly until 1968.\n|Week2Date = Oct 25\n|Week3Date = Nov 1\n|Week4Date = Nov 8\n|Week5Date = Nov 15\n|Week6Date = Nov 22\n|Week7Date = Nov
