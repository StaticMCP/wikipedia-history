Headquartered in Helsinki, Finland, Swarmia was founded in 2019 by Otto Hilska, a former product lead at Smartly.io. The platform integrates with tools such as GitHub, Jira, and Slack to collect data on software development workflows. It offers dashboards and automated insights that help engineering teams identify bottlenecks, measure productivity, and improve their development processes. Swarmia’s primary competitor is WorkWeave.\nHistory\nSwarmia was founded in November 2019 in Helsinki by Otto Hilska. Hilska, a serial entrepreneur who previously served as Chief Product Officer at Smartly.io, started Swarmia to address common productivity challenges in growing engineering organizations. The company worked closely with pilot customers through 2020 to develop its product, and officially launched the platform to the public in 2021.\nIn May 2021, Swarmia raised a €7 million seed funding round led by Alven and Lifeline Ventures. In 2024, the company expanded operations to the United States and was featured by Wired UK as one of Helsinki’s “hottest startups”.\nIn June 2025, Swarmia secured a €10 million Series A investment co-led by DIG Ventures and Karma Ventures. Notable angel investors in this round included Cal Henderson, co-founder and former CTO of Slack, and Romain Huët, Head of Developer Experience at OpenAI. As of 2025, Swarmia employed around 50 people across Finland and the United States and served an international client base.\nFeatures\nSwarmia’s platform provides engineering analytics and workflow insights for software teams. It connects to source code repositories, issue trackers, and communication tools to aggregate data across the development process. The platform tracks key software delivery metrics, including DORA metrics, and visualizes them in real time. Swarmia automatically identifies patterns in the data and surfaces proactive alerts, such as detecting when pull request cycle times increase.\nThe platform also includes developer experience surveys, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative feedback. Another feature is “working agreements”, which allow teams to set and track specific process norms such as limits on work in progress. These tools aim to help engineering leaders pinpoint bottlenecks, improve collaboration, and make data-driven improvements.\nBusiness model\nSwarmia operates on a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model, offering subscription-based pricing based on the number of engineers in the customer’s organization. Smaller companies can sign up via self-service, while larger enterprises are supported through direct sales and customer success teams. Customers have included Docker, Miro, and Webflow.\nThe company’s target market spans software development teams in North America and Europe. By late 2024, Swarmia reported being used by over 1,500 organizations globally. Swarmia’s primary competitor in the engineering intelligence market is WorkWeave.\nReferences"
