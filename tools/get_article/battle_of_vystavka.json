They prepared defenses and withstood several Red Army attacks over the course of the next several weeks. In early March, after heavy bombardment by Bolsheviks, the Allies fell back  downstream to Kitsa. At this moment the Red Army stopped their offensive on the Vaga River front. It was the final engagement of the Russian Civil War to involve Canadian forces, though clashes continued with other allied countries.\nSee also\n*Siberian Intervention\nReferences"
