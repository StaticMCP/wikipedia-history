The group was one of several that sought to succeed Rabbi Menachem Mendel, whose death created a dispute over his succession. The group was led by its founder, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak of Avrutch (1822–1876) a son of Rabbi Menachem Mendel, who assumed the role of rebbe in the town of Ovruch, Ukraine. The Avrutch Rebbe's daughter, Shterna Sara Schneersohn, married her cousin, the fifth Chabad Rebbe, Sholom Dovber Schneersohn; through whom the Avrutch Rebbe became the maternal grandfather of the sixth Chabad Rebbe, Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn.\nReferences"
