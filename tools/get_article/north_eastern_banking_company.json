It was fifteen years before another successful effort was made to establish a bank on the joint stock principle.\nThe earliest extant note of the intention to form the bank dates to is contained in a private letter from a London banker to a friend in Newcastle, dated 25 March 1872. He writes that it had been talked of for some time, and that the promoters were all gentlemen in good position, namely: William John Wilkinson, Ealing, solicitor; Sir James Anderson, 16, Warrington Crescent; Lord Wm. Montague Hay, The Albany; J. B. Wauklyn, 1. Angel Court; Wm. M. Wilkinson, 44, Lincoln's Inn Fields; John S. Louth, 28, Palmerston Buildings; W. Abbott, 10, Token House Yard, stock-broker. During the following month the prospectus was issued. It announced:\nThe prospectus states that the bank is formed to supply banking facilities required in the North Eastern counties, especially Newcastle upon Tyne, and the Cleveland Iron district. It drew attention to the development of the North Eastern district in trades connected with Iron, Coal, Machinery, Chemicals, Shipbuilding, &c., and to the great increase in the value of North Eastern Railway Stock, the value of vessels cleared on the River Tyne, as well as setting out a list of the prices of other prosperous Joint Stock banks.\nThe directors stated they \"have secured as managing director the services of Mr. Noble, who has successfully managed the Clydesdale bank at Greenock, up to the present time, and who is thoroughly acquainted with the principles of banking prevailing in Scotland, which this company proposes as far as possible to adopt.\" Mr. Hugh Rose (from Messrs. Glyn & Co., London) was appointed Secretary on 27 June 1872. The bank opened for business on 21 May 1872, at Newcastle, and about a week later at Middlesbrough.\nThe first report of the company was issued in February, 1873, the meeting of shareholders being held at the Station Hotel, York.\nThe business of the bank was considerably augmented in 1875 by the purchase of the Alnwick and County Bank upon the death of its sole proprietor, William Dickson. The North Eastern Bank continued to expand organically, and in 1892 another considerable addition was made by an amalgamation with Messrs. Dale, Young, & Co., of Newcastle and South Shields. By 1895 the company had more than forty branches covering the major towns of north-east England.\nThe North-Eastern Banking Company amalgamated with The Bank of Liverpool on 7 August 1914.\nReferences\nSources\n*"
