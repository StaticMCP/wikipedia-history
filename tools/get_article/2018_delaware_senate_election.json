The election coincided with the elections for other offices, including U.S. Senate, U.S. House of Representatives, and state house. The primary election was held on September 6, 2018.\nDelaware Republicans needed to have a net gain of one seat to flip the chamber from the Democrats, however, Democrats increased their majority in the Senate by gaining one seat (winning 12 seats, compared to nine seats for the Republicans).\nResults summary\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:14px;\"\n! colspan=\"1\" |District\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Incumbent\n! colspan=\"2\" |Party\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Elected Senator\n! colspan=\"2\" |Party\n|-\n! 2\n| Margaret Rose Henry\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Dem\n| Darius Brown\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Dem\n|-\n! 3\n| Robert Marshall\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Dem\n| Elizabeth Lockman\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Dem\n|-\n! 4\n| Gregory Lavelle\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Rep\n| Laura Sturgeon\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Dem\n|-\n! 6\n| Ernesto Lopez\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Rep\n| Ernesto Lopez\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Rep\n|-\n! 10\n| Stephanie Hansen\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Dem\n| Stephanie Hansen\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Dem\n|-\n! 11\n| Bryan Townsend\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Dem\n| Bryan Townsend\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Dem\n|-\n! 16\n| Colin Bonini\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Rep\n| Colin Bonini\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Rep\n|-\n! 17\n| Brian Bushweller\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Dem\n| Charles Paradee\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Dem\n|-\n! 18\n| Gary Simpson\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Rep\n| David Wilson\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Rep\n|-\n! 21\n| Bryant Richardson\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Rep\n| Bryant Richardson\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Rep\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 rowspan=2|Party !! rowspan=2|Candi-dates !! colspan=2|Votes !! colspan=3|Seats\n|-\n!
