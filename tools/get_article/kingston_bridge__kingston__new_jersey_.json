The borders for the three townships and their respective counties meet in the center of the bridge. The span used to carry New Jersey Route 27 over the Millstone River, but that road now bypasses the bridge on a newer span just to the north. It is Somerset County's oldest bridge, and is part of the Kingston Mill Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1986.\nA previous bridge at the site was destroyed during the American Revolutionary War to halt advancing British troops. The current structure was completed in 1798.\nSee also\n*List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in New Jersey\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
