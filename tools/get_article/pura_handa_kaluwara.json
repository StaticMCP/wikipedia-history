It stars Joe Abeywickrama and Priyanka Samaraweera in lead roles along with Linton Semage and Mahendra Perera. Music composed by Nadeeka Guruge. The film has received mainly positive reviews. It is the 967th film in Sri Lankan cinema.\nPlot\nWannihami, the main character, is a blind old man who is mourning the death of his soldier son. He is an average man and one day his simple life is upturned by the news of his son’s death that pushes him into a very difficult journey that tests his faith and courage.\nWannihami lives in a drought-stricken, mostly barren land marred by ethnic conflict, where the sons of the rural poor are dying in a bitter civil war. Wannihami's village consists of decaying huts and houses, such as his own. His house is a small quiet place, its doors are low, and the rain squeezes in from the roof to wet its mud floor.\nOn the Buddhist holiday of the full moon, the body of Bandara, Wannihami's soldier son, is brought home in a sealed coffin draped with the flag of Sri Lanka, with all its nationalistic symbolism. Wannihami knows that rain will come soon, and it rains on the day Bandara is buried. To ward off the pressure that comes from outside to accept the death of his son’s death, Wannihami sits on the empty veranda’s floor or the dingy rear of the house. It is to this house that his elder daughter would come to ask for his finger print signature, to claim compensation for her brother’s demise. Despite pressure from his desperate community and his family, Wannihami refuses to sign the papers which entitles the family to government compensation.\nHe decides to dig up his son's sealed coffin, even though he knows it will invalidate the compensation claim. When the coffin is opened, tree trunks are found inside instead of the son's remains. The coffin is closed up and buried once more. The film concludes with Wannihami near a lake listening to the sounds of children playing in the lake as it begins to rain. Ultimately, his greater purpose is to believe that the war cannot kill his son.\nCast\n* Joe Abeywickrama as Vannihamy\n* Priyanka Samaraweera as Sunanda\n* Linton Semage as Sunanda's husband\n* Mahendra Perera as Village Officer\n* Nayana Hettiarachchi as Yamuna\n* Kumara Karunananda as Pala\n* Uvindu Harshajith Abeysuriya as Vannihamy's Grandson\n* K.
