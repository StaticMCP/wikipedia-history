However the other USAAF support commands (Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); Air Transport Command (ATC) or Troop Carrier Command operated a significant number of airfields in support roles.\nIt is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor Airfields\nThird Air Force\n* Key Field, Meridian\n: 39th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Now:  Key Field Air National Guard Base\n* Laurel Army Airfield, Laurel\n: 473d Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron\n: Assigned to Air Technical Service Command, (1944-1946)\n: Now: Hesler-Noble Field\n* Hattiesburg Army Airfield, Hattiesburg\n: 39th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Assigned to Air Technical Service Command, (1942-1945)\n: Now: Hattiesburg Bobby L.
