It is on the Queensland border with New South Wales to the south and South Australia to the west. In the , Cameron Corner had a population of 19 people.\nGeography\nCameron Corner is located about  west-southwest of Brisbane, Queensland and is the point in the outback of eastern Australia where the boundary lines of the states of Queensland, South Australia, and New South Wales meet (the area immediately to the north and east of the intersection of the state boundaries). The noted Dingo Fence passes through Cameron Corner along the New South Wales border.\nCameron Corner has the following mountains (from north to south):\n* Mount Intrepid ()\n* Mount Morris ()\n* Mount Bygrave ()\nHistory\nThis general area, which includes Sturt Stony Desert in the Lake Eyre Basin, was first explored by Captain Charles Sturt, who in 1844 went in search of a supposed inland sea in the centre of Australia.\nThe corner and locality are named for the surveyor, John Brewer Cameron, from the New South Wales Lands Department, who spent two years during 1880–1882 marking the border between New South Wales and Queensland. Cameron erected a post there in September 1880 to mark its intersection with the border of South Australia. He placed a wooden marker every  eastwards along the interstate boundary.\nOn 28 January 1919, the Queensland Government placed restrictions on the border crossing at Wompah Gate () to prevent the spread of the Spanish flu into Queensland, which were enforced by the Queensland Police. A medical screening process was used to determine if Queensland residents could safely return to the state.\nOn 17 April 2020, the Queensland Government reorganised the nine localities in the Shire of Bulloo, resulting in six localities. It included Cameron Corner gaining a small portion of land from the west of the locality of Bulloo Downs. It increased the area of the locality from  to .\nDemographics\nIn the , Cameron Corner had \"no people or a very low population\".\nIn the , Cameron Corner had a population of 19 people.\nHeritage listings\nCameron Corner Survey Marker () marks the corner and was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register in 2012.\nDingo Fence\non the 29th parallel of latitude.

It is administered by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. The Wild Dog Barrier Fence staff consists of 23 employees, including two-person teams that patrol a  section of the fence once every week. There are depots at Quilpie and Roma.\nThe Queensland Border Fence stretches for  westwards along the border with New South Wales, into the Strzelecki Desert. The fence passes the point where the three states of Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia meet (Cameron Corner). At this point, it connects with the South Australian Border Fence, which runs for  southwards along the border with New South Wales. It then joins a section known as the Dog Fence in South Australia, which is  long.\nHomesteads\nThere are a number of homesteads in the locality, including (from north to south):\n* Orientos ()\n* Tennappera ()\n* Epsilon ()\n* Santos ()\n* Naryilco ()\n* Omicron ()\nEvents\nNew Year's Eve is celebrated three times each year in Cameron Corner (also in Poeppel Corner and Surveyor Generals Corner), because the three states that meet at the corner are in three time zones.\nFacilities\nThe Cameron Corner Store was established in 1990 by a Vietnam War veteran, Sandy Nall, and his wife Cathrine. As of 2014, the store was operated by the sole permanent residents of Cameron Corner, Fenn and Cheryl Miller. The store reportedly has a Queensland liquor licence, a New South Wales postal code and a South Australian telephone number.\nThe locality also features a desert golf course.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Cameron Corner nor nearby.
