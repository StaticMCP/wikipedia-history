According to his Medal of Honor citation, despite having been severely wounded during the Battle of Sailor's Creek, Virginia on April 6, 1865, and again at Farmville on April 7, he refused hospitalization, choosing instead to remain with his regiment in order to perform the duties of the 1st Maine's regimental adjutant who had recently fallen in combat. Those duties included services rendered by Tobie at Appomattox.\nFormative years\nBorn on March 19, 1838, in Lewiston, Maine, Edward Parsons Tobie Jr. was a son of abolitionist Edward Parsons Tobie, Sr. (1800–1875) and his first wife, Caroline (Frye) Tobie (1804–1838). His father, a wool carder by trade who ultimately became the town clerk of Lewiston, holding that job, with the exception of one year from 1839 until 1875. A deacon with Lewiston's Free Baptist Church, the elder Tobie also helped fugitive slaves escape to Canada. The other siblings in the Tobie household were: Sarah, Mary, Joseph, and Laroy/Leroy (born, respectively, in 1829, 1832, 1838, and 1843).\nCivil War\nFollowing his enrollment in Maine for Civil War military service, Edward P. Tobie Jr. officially mustered in for duty as a sergeant with Company G of the 1st Maine Volunteer Cavalry. He then participated with his regiment in a number of the Union Army's most important engagements of the war, including 1862's First Battle of Winchester (May 25) and battles of Cedar Mountain (August 9), Second Bull Run (August 28–30), South Mountain (September 14), Antietam (September 17), and Fredericksburg (December 11–15); 1863's Stoneman's Raid, Battle of Brandy Station (June 9), during which he was taken prisoner after being wounded, and the battles of Gettysburg (July 1–3), and Mine Run (November 7 to December 2); and 1864's battles of Todd's Tavern (May 7), Haw's Shop (May 28), Old Church (May 30), Cold Harbor (May 31 to June 12), Trevilian Station (June 11–12), St. Mary's Church (June 24), Deep Bottom I/Gravel Hill (July 27–29), Ream's Station II (August 25), and Boydton Plank Road (October 27–28).\nTobie was then appointed as sergeant-major on December 12, 1864.\nDuring the spring of 1865, Tobie then performed the act of valor for which he would ultimately be awarded the U.S. Medal of Honor. Despite having been severely wounded in action during the Battle of Sailor's Creek, Virginia on April 6, 1865, and again at Farmville on April 7, he refused hospitalization, choosing instead to remain with his regiment in order to perform the duties of the 1st Maine's regimental adjutant who had recently fallen in combat. Those duties included services rendered by Tobie at Appomattox. As told in Beyer's Deeds of Valor:\nLieutenant T. Little, adjutant of the First Maine Cavalry, was wounded in the first charge of General Smith's Third Brigade on the 6th, and shortly after his successor, Lieutenant J. W. Poor, met a like fate, whereupon Colonel Cilly detailed Sergeant Tobie to assume the duties of adjutant. Just as the regiment started on the final charge that day which resulted so disastrously for the enemy a bullet pierced Tobie's foot and threw him to the ground. With great difficulty he hobbled to the rear, but upon recovering his horse, which had been caught by the colonel's orderly, he mounted it and started for the field hospital, where he had his wound bandaged. The surgeon advised him to stay in the rear, but finding his wound not to be serious he rejoined his regiment, reaching it in time to go on a scout through the woods. The regiment was on the march early next day, the plucky sergeant with it, and though his foot pained him greatly he did not hesitate and stay behind when the charge into the village of Farmville was made. He rode at the front of the second battalion with Major Hall, and dashing through the village put to rout a superior force of the enemy. In this charge Sergeant Tobie was again wounded, the bullet passing through his leg, killing his horse; but upon finding that the wound was not serious, he had it bandaged and a second time rejoined his regiment, having in the meantime procured another horse. That night found him with his regiment on its march to Appomattox, where for a third time he was, in a wounded condition, engaged with the enemy.\nIn addition to his Medal of Honor award, Tobie's valor was also recognized via a good conduct mention in the Appomattox battle report filed by his superior officer. On May 8, 1865, Tobie was then commissioned as a second lieutenant with Company E of the 1st Maine Volunteer Cavalry.\nWith the war over and Reconstruction beginning, he returned home with his regiment in early August 1865.\nPost-war life\nFollowing his honorable discharge from the military, Tobie returned home to New England. On September 14, 1870, he and his wife, Adeline (Phipps) Tobie, welcomed the birth of son, Edward (1870–1952). They made their home initially in Providence, Rhode Island, where he was employed as the assistant to the editor of the Providence Journal.\nSometime during the 1870s, Tobie was appointed as the historian of his former Civil War regiment, which had been reconstituted as the First Maine Cavalry Association, and charged with researching and writing that regiment's history. The result was the 1887 publication of History of the First Maine Cavalry 1861-1865.\nIn 1889, he wrote a poem and history sketch about the 1st Maine Cavalry to celebrate the placement of a monument to his former Civil War regiment on at the Gettysburg National Battlefield. He then read both at that monument's dedication ceremony on October 3, 1889. The words of Tobie's poem heard that day were:\nThis sculptured soldier here,In readiness to mount and rideWhere duty’s call or country’s need Shall point the way, whate’er betide,With faith unbounded in his steed,And knowing naught of fear,\nWith spirit that will facePrivations such as few endureAnd danger dire to life and limb,Face death, for love of country pure,And calmly meet his summons grim,Face aught except disgrace;—\nThis sculptured soldier hereIs type of thousands, good and true,Who, six and twenty years ago,Stood on this field, brave boys in blue,Stood firm against th’ invading foe—And some lie buried near;\nNot only here they stood,But on a hundred fields of strifeThey stood ‘mid storm of shot and shellAnd offered life for nation’s life;They did their duty grandly well,—They did all soldier could.\nThis sculptured soldier hereEmbodies all the service grand,The days of suffering and pain,The hardships met on every hand,By nigh three thousand men from Maine,The State which we revere,—\nAnd all the weary hoursOf picket duty day and night,The campaigns ‘neath a southern sun,The march, the skirmish and the fight,The battles fought, the victories won,By these brave boys of ours,\nAnd all the throb and acheOf wounds received from fellow-menAnd illness nothing could appease,The dreary life in prison pen,The death by battle and disease,—All this for country’s sake.\nThis sculptured soldier hereWill tell their story through all time;And more than that, will teach to allWho look on him, that ‘tis sublimeTo promptly answer duty’s call;And duty make so clear,\nThat in the coming yearsThe spirit of these gallant menThroughout the land will e’er abide,And should our country call again,As many more will mount and rideWith neither doubts nor fears.\nIn 1881, he was assigned by the editor of the Providence Journal to oversee that newspaper's Pawtucket, Rhode Island office, a position he continued to hold for nearly two more decades.\nDeath and interment\nPreceded in death by his wife, Addie, in Rhode Island on April 25, 1891, and ailing with Bright's Disease, Edward P. Tobie Jr. died shortly after the turn of the century, in Pawtucket, Rhode Island on January 21, 1900.\nMedal of Honor citation\nRank and organization: Sergeant Major, 1st Maine Cavalry.
