By 27 April of the same year, after three days of combat, they enter Caracas triumphantly acclaimed by the people dissatisfied with the government of José Ruperto Monagas. The city had been defended by  1,600 to 2,000 men, most of them armed residents. General Monagas signed the surrender of the government and then began the long term of Antonio Guzmán Blanco as leader of the country (1870-1887), a period known as Yellow Liberalism.\nConsolidation of power\nGuzman Blanco sent Matías Salazar to fight Blue forces that still refused to surrender. He was victorious in the Battle of Guama which left 800 dead, and which was won thanks to the fact that 200 Blue soldiers defected, encouraged by León Colina. Some 200 enemy soldiers were taken prisoner.\nGeneral Adolfo Antonio Olivo managed to gain strength in Maturín by leading the resistance against the new government. However he retreated after being defeated by the troops of José Ignacio Pulido and took refuge in the town of San Fernando de Apure.\nIn December 1871, Antonio Guzmán Blanco marched with six thousand soldiers to defeat General Olivo in the battle of San Fernando de Apure, after which General Adolfo Antonio Olivo drowned in the Arauca River along with 300 of his men. The Apure State was pacified by the beginning of 1872, consolidating his power.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Lucca, Rafael Arráiz (mayo de 2007). «6».  En Fanuel Hanán Díaz; Lisbeth Cabezas, ed.
