V. Subba Rao under the Prasad Art Pictures banner and directed by T. Rama Rao. It stars Nandamuri Balakrishna and Suhasini. The music was composed by Chakravarthy.\nPlot\nThe film begins in a village where President Chandraiah is a paragon of nobility, the first-ever in accord from the past 25 years, and defines serenity. He leads buoyant domesticity, his ideal wife, Anasuya; three sons, Sivaram, Prasad, and Ramakrishna; two daughters-in-law Kamala, and Satya; one daughter, Poorna; and a grandson, Gopi. Gopi is sweetest to both Chandraiah and Ramakrishna, and he too strongly bonded with him. Suraiah is pernicious and has made a marital bond with Chandraiah's family by nuptial of his elder daughter Satya with Prasad. He goes spare against Chandraiah and always keeps pace with him. Ramakrishna is a vibrant one who picks up the ant type of gauntlet, which he overthrows, and his hijinks vex Chandraiah. Nevertheless, he owns to face villainy.\nMeanwhile, Suraiah carries several barbarities in the village, and to escape, he purports devils on the outskirts. Latha, the younger daughter of Suraiah, appears to be accomplishing her education. After a series of donnybrook, Ramakrishna and Latha crushes. Interim, Delhi Babai, a feline, whisks with Suraiah and dethrones Chandraiah on treachery. However, Chandraiah scrubs his vindication by re-contesting and triumphs victory when Suraiah flares up with a vengeance. At the same time, Chandraiah fixes a prosperous alliance for Poorna. Just before the wedding, Papa Rao, son of Suraiah, tries to molest Poorna when Ramakrishna rescues her with the help of Latha and stabs Papa Rao in that brawl. Exploiting it, Suraiah inculpates him in murder offense and sullies on Poorna's chastity. In the court, Ramakrishna maintains silence to protect his sister's honor, but Latha divulges the reality and acquits him.\nUnfortunately, Poorna's husband Venu and in-laws misinterpret and chuck her. Moreover, futile brothers and virago sisters-in-law hinder her stay. Hence, a rift arises, and the family splits into two. Chandraiah must quit the house but cannot take Gopi's separation. Moreover, Suraiah is below the belt for Latha's constrained connubial with his ally Govindaiah's brother Raja. Ramakrishna hiatus the ruse and couples Latha. Parallelly, Ramakrishna solicits Venu to accept Poorna and then seeks two lakhs as dowry. Knowing it, Suraiah plots with Delhi Babai to eliminate Ramakrishna, announcing a challenge with two lakhs of reward. It implies proving superstitions in their village as false, for which he must spend a night on the outskirts. Ramakrishna takes up the challenge audaciously and conquests it. Blackguards kill Gopi in that chaos. Being conscious of it, forbearing Chandraiah outbursts and behests Ramakrishna destroy the demons. At last, he ceases the baddies when Venu realizes his mistake and takes Poorna back. Finally, the movie ends on a happy note with the family's reunion.\nCast\nSoundtrack\nThe music was composed by Chakravarthy. Lyrics were written by Veturi.
