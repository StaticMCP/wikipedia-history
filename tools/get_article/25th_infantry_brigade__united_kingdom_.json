It formed part of the 8th Division and served with it on the Western Front until the end of the war, in particular taking part in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle, the Battle of the Somme and the Battle of Passchendaele.  It was disbanded in March 1919.\nThe brigade was reformed in November 1939 just after the outbreak of the Second World War.  It saw action during the battles of France and Belgium in May 1940, predominantly with the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division.  After being evacuated at Dunkirk, it remained in the United Kingdom with the 47th (London) Infantry Division until it was disbanded at the end of August 1944.\nFirst World War\nThe 25th Brigade came into existence on 5 October 1914 (first commanding officer appointed) as part of the 8th Division shortly after the outbreak of the First World War.  It was formed with four regular infantry battalions brought back to the United Kingdom from various overseas garrisons: 2nd Lincolnshire Regiment from Bermuda, 2nd Royal Berkshire Regiment from Jhansi, India, 1st Royal Irish Rifles from Aden, and 2nd Rifle Brigade from Kuldana, Murree, India.  The brigade concentrated at Hursley Park near Winchester and on 5 and 6 November 1914 it landed at Le Havre.  It remained on the Western Front with the 8th Division for the rest of the war.\nThe brigade saw action at the battles of Neuve-Chapelle (Moated Grange Attack, 18 December 1914), Neuve Chapelle again (10–13 March 1915), Aubers Ridge (9 May 1915), when the brigade commander, Brigadier-General Lowry Cole was killed, and Bois-Grenier (25 September 1915), a diversionary attack for the Battle of Loos.\nmen of the 1st Battalion, Royal Irish Rifles during the Battle of the Somme, July 1916.]]\nIn early 1916, the brigade gained a trench mortar battery and a machine gun company.
