The battle began on 19 April 1945 and lasted until 25 May 1945, 17 days after the end of the war in Europe. The combatants were the Croatian Armed Forces (Independent State of Croatia) (NDH) commanded by Petar Rajkovačić and the Yugoslav Army commanded by Miloš Zekić. The battle took place in the Bosnian town of Odžak.
