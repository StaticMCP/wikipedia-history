Both men competed in the long jump and in the mail coach and de Polyakov competed in the hacks and hunter combined event. One of the two competed in the high jump, though it is not clear which. Similarly, it is not clear which of the two men entered the jumping competition; further, for this event, it is not clear whether the Russian entrant actually competed.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!
