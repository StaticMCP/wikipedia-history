The population was 1,835 at the 2020 census. The village is within Reynolds Township.\nHistory\nBenjamin Ensley owned the land on which he, E. W. Muenscher, and Mr. Shaw began the settlement that Muenscher platted in 1868. It was named for William A. Howard, a Detroit railroad attorney. The Detroit, Grand Rapids and Western Railroad depot opened in 1869. A post office was established on January 12, 1870, with John B. Spencer as the first postmaster. It incorporated as a village in 1873. The post office name was shortened to \"Howard\" on February 2, 1895, but restored to Howard City on January 19, 1899.\nThe village's Main Street was initially constructed on Ensley Street, which was named after early settler Benjamin Ensley. In 1883, however, many of the wooden buildings on Ensley Street burned down. Main Street was then shifted over to Edgerton Street, its present location. The Hudson Knife factory and the Skinner and Steenman sideboard factory were two of the earliest businesses. Later, Hudson Knife Co. went through changes and became the Joslin and eventually Olsen Knife Company, which had the somewhat famous jingle, \"Fatty Fatty run for your life, here comes Skinny with an Olsen Knife.\" Howard City schools were combined with Sand Lake schools to the south in 1962, and renamed Tri County, because students from Kent, Montcalm, and Newaygo counties all attended. The school still runs under the same moniker.\nGeography\nHoward City is in northwestern Montcalm County, in the southeast corner of Reynolds Township.

It came into existence on April 3, 1962, the day members of those communities voted in favor of consolidating their schools. The consolidated schools began operation in fall 1962. Prior to the consolidation, Howard City High School served the community. Impetus for consolidation occurred when the State of Michigan adopted new standards for education which required school systems to spend additional funds. A former member of the school board of Sand Lake, Charles Northup, stated, \"Howard City was almost in the same predicament as us. We figured we would have a good school system coming together.\" Sand Lake was a community which sought consolidation due to the financial strain from meeting the new requirements.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
