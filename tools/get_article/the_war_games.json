The time travelling Second Doctor and his travelling companions Jamie McCrimmon and Zoe Heriot form a resistance army to stop this plot and return the kidnapped soldiers to their correct times on Earth.\nThe War Games was the last regular appearance of Patrick Troughton as the Doctor and the last serial to be recorded in black and white. It also marks the last regular appearances of Wendy Padbury and Frazer Hines as companions Zoe and Jamie, and the first appearances of the Doctor's race, the Time Lords, and their home planet, Gallifrey. The latter was not named until The Time Warrior (1973).\nPlot\nOn an alien planet, the Doctor uncovers a plot to conquer the Galaxy with brainwashed soldiers abducted from Earth and forced to fight in simulated \"war games\", representing the periods in history from which they were taken. The aliens' aim is to produce a super-army from the survivors; to this end, they have been aided by a renegade Time Lord, calling himself the War Chief.\nJoining forces with rebel soldiers who have broken their conditioning, the Doctor and his companions foil the plot and end the fighting. The War Chief is apparently killed when the leader of the aliens, the War Lord, realises he has been plotting against him. The Doctor admits he needs the help of the Time Lords to return the soldiers to their own timelines, but in asking, risks capture for his own past crimes, including the theft of his TARDIS. After sending the message, he and his companions attempt to evade capture, but are caught.\nHaving returned the soldiers to Earth, the Time Lords place the War Lord on trial and dematerialise him. They erase Zoe and Jamie's memories of travelling with the Doctor, and return them to the respective point in time when each of them first entered the TARDIS. They then place the Doctor on trial for stealing a TARDIS and breaking the law of non-interference. The Doctor presents a spirited defence, citing his many battles against the evils of the universe. Accepting this defence, the Time Lords proclaim that his punishment is exile to Earth in the 20th century - a planet and period of which he is fond. The Doctor points out he is too well known on Earth, so the Time Lords tell him he will change his appearance, as he has before, and present him with images of five faces. He does not like any of them; impatient, the Time Lords inform him that a decision has been made for him. He cries out indignantly as the forced regeneration is triggered.\nProduction\nAs the TARDIS crew try to escape the Time Lords in Episode Ten, brief clips from The Web of Fear and Fury from the Deep are used to show the TARDIS in locations supposedly out of the Time Lords' reach. A model shot from Episode 1 of The Wheel in Space is used after Zoe is sent back to her own time and place by the Time Lords. Since this episode is missing, the shot sampled in The War Games is the only known surviving footage from this episode. Similarly, the shot of the TARDIS landing vertically on the sea is sampled from Fury from the Deep Episode 1, which is the only surviving footage from this episode.\nCasting\nPatrick Troughton's eldest son David made his second appearance in Doctor Who in Episode Six of this story as Private Moor, having first appeared in The Enemy of the World (1968).

The introduction of the Time Lords ... sees the series lose some of its mystery, but gain a new focus.\" In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker stated that the serial \"gets off to a cracking start\", though they noted that \"A commonly expressed view is that, after this strong beginning, the story becomes dull and repetitive, picking up again only in the closing stages when the Time Lords are introduced.\" They praised the design work of the different war zones, the dialogue, and the conclusion. In 2009, Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern was positive towards the detailed scripts and the various villains, especially the War Chief. The A.V. Club reviewer praised the way the serial subverted viewers' expectations of a typical historical story. He noted that there was padding to fill the running time, but felt that it was done well and that it worked better than in The Dalek Invasion of Earth. He also wrote positively of Madoc's War Lord and Jamie and Zoe's departure, and said that the story purposefully \"doesn't resolve neatly or satisfyingly\". Alasdair Wilkins of io9 praised Troughton's performance and the way that it was structured to \"constantly [expand] the story's scope\", though he admitted there was still padding. In a 2010 article, Charlie Jane Anders of the same site listed the cliffhanger to the ninth episode&nbsp;— in which the Doctor and his companions escape the base and try to get back to the TARDIS but their movements are slowed down as the Doctor tries to unlock and open the TARDIS doors&nbsp;— as one of the greatest Doctor Who cliffhangers ever.\nA viewing of The War Games, and in particular the character of Jamie McCrimmon, inspired author Diana Gabaldon to set her Outlander series in Jacobite Scotland, and to name its protagonist \"Jamie\".\nCommercial releases\nIn print\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Malcolm Hulke, was published by Target Books in September 1979, entitled Doctor Who and The War Games.\nIn January 2011, an audiobook of the novelisation was released, read by David Troughton.\nHome media\nThis serial was released in the UK in February 1990 in a two-tape set in episodic form. It was re-released in remastered format in September 2002. Since this VHS re-release, better quality film prints of the story were located at the BFI, and were used for the DVD release which occurred on 6 July 2009. This DVD release contained a number of bonus features, including the fan film Devious, which featured the last appearance of Jon Pertwee as the Third Doctor.\nThe \"Regenerations\" box set, released on 24 June 2013, includes The War Games but with no special features.\nThe War Games in Colour\nA 90-minute colourised version of the serial was broadcast on 23 December 2024 on BBC Four to a consolidated audience of 370,000 before becoming available on BBC iPlayer. The serial was colourised and enhanced with updated visual and sound effects and a new musical score, and featured a new regeneration sequence. The colourisation was completed by Rich Tipple, Kieran Highman, Timothy K. Brown, Scott Burditt, Tom Newsom and Aaron J. Climas. Tipple had previously led the colourisation of The Daleks in Colour (2023). The updated music features Murray Gold's theme for The Master, which appears to confirm a long-held fan theory that the War Chief is an incarnation of The Master.\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.doctorwholocations.net/stories/wargames Doctor Who Locations] – The War Games\n*[https://archive.today/20121223185020/http://www.purpleville.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/rtwebsite/TheWarGamesDVD.htm Doctor Who Restoration Team] – The War Games\nTarget novelisation\n*\n}}"
