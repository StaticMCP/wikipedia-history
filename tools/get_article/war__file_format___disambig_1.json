If the web application is only serving JSP files, the web.xml file is not strictly necessary. If the web application uses servlets, then the servlet container uses web.xml to ascertain to which servlet a URL request will be routed. The web.xml file is also used to define context variables which can be referenced within the servlets and it is used to define environmental dependencies which the deployer is expected to set up. An example of this is a dependency on a mail session used to send email. The servlet container is responsible for providing this service.\nAdvantages of WAR files\n* Easy testing and deployment of web applications\n* Easy identification of the version of the deployed application\n* All Jakarta EE containers support WAR files\n* MVC structure supports WAR files.\nAssuming production environments do not promote a fix without sufficient testing prior to deployment, a WAR file has a distinct advantage when properties files are used to identify environment specific variables. For example, an LDAP server in a testing environment may be something like ldaps://testauth.example.com:636. The LDAP server in a production environment is ldaps://auth.example.com:636. An external properties file would define the link with some thing like:\nLINKED_PAGE=ldaps://testauth.example.com:636\nThe source code reads the property file to determine the target LDAP server. In this way, developers can be certain that the WAR file tested and verified is exactly the same as that which is being promoted to production.\nDisadvantages of WAR files\nSome consider web deployment using WAR files to be disadvantageous when minor changes to source code are required for dynamic environments. Each change to source code must be repackaged and deployed in development. This does not require stopping the web server if configured for runtime deployment.\nExample\nThe following sample web.xml file demonstrates the declaration and association of a servlet:\nHelloServlet\nmypackage.HelloServlet\nHelloServlet\n/HelloServlet\nResource reference to a factory for javax.mail.Session\ninstances that may be used for sending electronic mail messages,\npreconfigured to connect to the appropriate SMTP server.\nmail/Session\njavax.mail.Session\nContainer\nThe /WEB-INF/classes directory is on the class loader's classpath. (The classpath consists of a list of locations from which .class files can be loaded and executed by the JVM.) The /WEB-INF/classes directory contains the classes associated with the web application itself.\nAny JAR files placed in the /WEB-INF/lib directory will also be placed on the class loader's classpath.\nSee also\n* EAR (file format)\n* JAR (file format)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://jakarta.ee/learn/docs/jakartaee-tutorial/9.1/platform/packaging/packaging003.html Packaging Web Archives] (The Jakarta EE 9.1 Tutorial)\n* [https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=154 JSR 154: JavaTM Servlet 2.4 Specification]"
