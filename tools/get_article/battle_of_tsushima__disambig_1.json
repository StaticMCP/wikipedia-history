A devastating defeat for the Imperial Russian Navy, the battle was the only decisive engagement ever fought between modern steel battleship fleets and the first in which wireless telegraphy (radio) played a critically important role. The battle was described by contemporary Sir George Clarke as \"by far the greatest and the most important naval event since Trafalgar\". The battle is also known in Japan as the Battle of the Sea of Japan.\nThe battle involved the Japanese Combined Fleet under Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō and the Russian Second Pacific Squadron under Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky, which had sailed over seven months and  from the Baltic Sea. The Russians hoped to reach Vladivostok and establish naval control of the Far East in order to relieve the Imperial Russian Army in Manchuria. The Russian fleet had a large advantage in the number of battleships, but was overall older and slower than the Japanese fleet, and outnumbered nearly three to one in total hulls. The Russians were sighted in the early morning on 27 May, and the battle began in the afternoon. Rozhestvensky was wounded and knocked unconscious in the initial action, and four of his battleships were sunk by sunset. At night, Japanese destroyers and torpedo boats attacked the remaining ships, and Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov surrendered in the morning of 28 May.\nAll 11 Russian battleships were lost, out of which seven were sunk and four captured. Only a few warships escaped, with one cruiser and two destroyers reaching Vladivostok, and two auxiliary cruisers as well as one transport escaping back to Madagascar.  Three cruisers were interned at Manila by the United States until the war was over. Eight auxiliaries and one destroyer were disarmed and remanded at Shanghai by China.  Russian casualties were high, with more than 5,000 dead and 6,000 captured. The Japanese, which had lost no heavy ships, had 117 dead.\nThe loss of almost every heavy warship of the Baltic Fleet forced Russia to sue for peace, and the Treaty of Portsmouth was signed in September 1905. In Japan, the battle was hailed as one of the greatest naval victories in Japanese history, and Admiral Tōgō was revered as a national hero. His flagship  has been preserved as a museum ship in Yokosuka Harbour.\nBackground\nConflict in the Far East\nwith Imperial Russian leaders. From left, Ambassador to China, Pavel Lessard; Ambassador to Japan, Roman Rosen; Minister of Navy, Theodor Avellan; Minister of Army, Vladimir Sakharov: Interior Minister, Vyacheslav von Plehve; Foreign Minister, Vladimir Lambsdorff; Prince Dmitry Khilkov; Finance Minister, Sergei Witte; Viceroy Yevgeni Alekseyev.]]\nOn 8 February 1904, destroyers of the Imperial Japanese Navy launched a surprise attack on the Russian Far East Fleet anchored in Port Arthur; three ships – two battleships and a cruiser – were damaged in the attack. The Russo-Japanese war had thus begun. Japan's first objective was to secure its lines of communication and supply to the Asian mainland, enabling it to conduct a ground war in Manchuria. To achieve this, it was necessary to neutralise Russian naval power in the Far East. At first, the Russian naval forces remained inactive and did not engage the Japanese, who staged unopposed landings in Korea. The Russians were revitalised by the arrival of Admiral Stepan Makarov and were able to achieve some degree of success against the Japanese, but on 13 April Makarov's flagship, the battleship , struck a mine and sank; Makarov was among the dead. His successors failed to challenge the Japanese Navy, and the remaining six Russian battleships, , , ,  and }} and five armoured cruisers, , ,  and }} were effectively bottled up in their base at Port Arthur.\nBy May, the Japanese had landed forces on the Liaodong Peninsula and in August began the siege of the naval station. On 9 August, Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft, commander of the 1st Pacific Squadron, was ordered to sortie his fleet to Vladivostok, link up with the Squadron stationed there, and then engage the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) in a decisive battle. Both squadrons of the Russian Pacific Fleet would ultimately become dispersed during the Battle of the Yellow Sea, where Admiral Vitgeft was killed by a salvo strike from the  on 10 August, and the Battle off Ulsan on 14 August 1904. What remained of Russian Pacific naval power would eventually be sunk in Port Arthur in December 1904.\nDeparture\nWith the inactivity of the First Pacific Squadron after the death of Admiral Makarov and the tightening of the Japanese noose around Port Arthur, the Russians considered sending part of their Baltic Fleet to the Far East. The plan was to relieve Port Arthur by sea, link up with the First Pacific Squadron, overwhelm the Imperial Japanese Navy, and then delay the Japanese advance into Manchuria until Russian reinforcements could arrive via the Trans-Siberian railroad and overwhelm the Japanese land forces there. As the situation in the Far East deteriorated, the Tsar (encouraged by his cousin Kaiser Wilhelm II), agreed to the formation of the Second Pacific Squadron. This would consist of five divisions of the Baltic Fleet, including 11 of its 13 battleships. The squadrons, including the later-formed Third Pacific Squadron, departed the Baltic ports of Reval (Tallinn) and Libau (Liepāja) on 15–16 October 1904 (Rozhestvensky fleet) and 2 February 1905 (Nebogatov fleet), and on 3 November 1904 (armoured cruisers  and , auxiliary cruisers  and Terek, destroyers Gromkiy and Grozniy}} under the command of Captain 1st rank Leonid Dobrotvorsky.), numbering 48 ships and auxiliaries.\nDogger Bank\nThe Rozhestvensky and von Fölkersahm squadrons sailed through Øresund strait into the North Sea. The Russians had received numerous fictitious reports of Japanese torpedo boats operating in the area and were on high alert. In the Dogger Bank incident, the Rozhestvensky squadron mistook a group of British fishing trawlers operating near the Dogger Bank at night for hostile Japanese ships. The fleet fired upon the small civilian vessels, killing several British fishermen; one trawler was sunk while another six were damaged. In confusion, the Russians even fired upon two of their own vessels, killing some of their own men. The firing continued for twenty minutes before Rozhestvensky ordered firing to cease; loss of life was limited by the fact that the Russian gunnery was highly inaccurate. The British were outraged by the incident and incredulous that the Russians could mistake a group of fishing trawlers for Japanese warships, thousands of kilometres from the nearest Japanese port. Britain almost entered the war in support of Japan, with whom it had an alliance (but was neutral in the war, as their mutual defense clause stipulated \"when either nation faced 'more than one' adversaries in a war\"). The Royal Navy sortied and shadowed the Russian fleet until a diplomatic agreement was reached. France, which had hoped to eventually bring the British and Russians together in an anti-German bloc, intervened diplomatically to restrain Britain from declaring war. The Russians were forced to disembark officers}} who were suspected of misconduct to give evidence to the International Court of Inquiry}} at Paris, ultimately accepting responsibility for the incident and compensating the fishermen.\nRoutes\nThe draught of the newer battleships, which had proven to be considerably greater than designed, preventing their passage through the Suez Canal got stuck aground on the fairway at the mouth of Kronstadt port, which had 27ft depth, requiring dredgers to dig extra one and a half feet. Suez Canal had a draught limit of 22 feet until 1956.}} caused the fleet to separate after leaving Tangier on 3 November 1904. The newer battleships, cruisers, fast auxiliaries and the destroyers for protection, proceeded around the Cape of Good Hope under the command of Admiral Rozhestvensky while the older battleships and cruisers made their way through the Suez Canal under the command of Admiral von Fölkersahm. They planned to rendezvous in Madagascar, and both sections of the fleet successfully completed this part of the voyage. The longer journey around Africa took a toll on the Russian crews under Rozhestvensky, \"who had never experienced such a different climate or such a long time at sea\" as \"conditions on the ships deteriorated, and disease and respiratory issues killed a number of sailors\". The voyage took half a year in rough seas, with difficulty obtaining coal for refueling – as the warships could not legally enter the ports of neutral nations – and the morale of the crews plummeted. The Russians needed  of coal and 30 to 40 re-coaling sessions to reach French Indochina (now Vietnam), and coal was provided by 60 colliers from the Hamburg-Amerika Line. and was described by Sir George Clarke as \"if the Russian fleet goes to the Far East (with) its motive power will be derived from British coal, mainly bought after the beginning of the war by a belligerent, which has made (the) coal absolute contraband\". This explains why the Hamburg Amerika Line refused to provide coaling beyond French Indochina, as the Japanese would be legally entitled to capture the German colliers carrying contraband for the Russians.}} By April and May 1905 the reunited fleet had anchored at Cam Ranh Bay in French Indochina.\nThe Russians had been ordered to break the blockade of Port Arthur, but the battleships in the port were sunk by the Japanese land artillery, and the heavily fortified city/port had already fallen on 2 January just after the Second Pacific Squadron arrived at Nossi Be, Madagascar, before the arrival of the Fölkersahm detachment. The objective was therefore shifted to linking up with the remaining Russian ships stationed in the port of Vladivostok, before bringing the Japanese fleet to battle.\nPrelude\nand Tsushima Strait, either side of the Tsushima Islands.]]\nThe Russians had three possible routes to enter the Sea of Japan and reach Vladivostok: the longer were the La Pérouse Strait and Tsugaru Strait, on either side of Hokkaido. Admiral Rozhestvensky did not reveal his choice even to his subordinates until 25 May, when it became apparent he chose Tsushima by ordering the fleet to head northeast after detaching transports Yaroslavl, Vladimir, Kuronia, Voronezh, Livonia and Meteor as well as auxiliary cruisers Rion and Dniepr with the instruction to go to the near-by neutral port of Shanghai.  The Tsushima Strait is the body of water eastward of the Tsushima Island, located midway between the Japanese island of Kyushu and the Korean Peninsula, the shortest and most direct route from Indochina. The other routes would have required the fleet to sail east around Japan.|name=terek}} The Japanese Combined Fleet and the Russian Second and Third Pacific Squadrons, sent from the Baltic Sea now numbering 38, would fight in the strait between Korea and Japan on the East side of Tsushima Island.\nBecause of the  journey, the Russian fleet was in a poor condition for battle. Apart from the four newest s, Admiral Nebogatov's 3rd Pacific Fleet consisted of older and poorly maintained warships. Overall, the Japanese side had a manoeuvrability advantage. The long voyage, combined with a lack of opportunity for maintenance, meant the Russian ships were heavily fouled, significantly reducing their speed. The Japanese 1st Battle Division could exceed  and regularly manoeuvred at 15&nbsp;knots, but the Russian fleet included warships with the maximum speed of 14 to 15&nbsp;knots (with new engines/boilers, normal load, and clean hull) and the auxiliaries of 10–12&nbsp;knots, that limited the fleet speed to 9&nbsp;knots.\nTōgō's greatest advantage was that of experience, having five of the ten fleet commanders in the history of the Russian and Japanese navy with combat experience aboard modern warships on his side, while Rozhestvensky had none.  The other five were all Russian admirals whom Tōgō had defeated and not present for this battle, including Oskar Starck, who had been relieved of his command following his humiliating defeat in the Battle of Port Arthur; Admiral Stepan Makarov, killed by a mine off Port Arthur; Wilgelm Vitgeft, who had been killed in the Battle of the Yellow Sea; and Admiral (Prince) Pavel Ukhtomsky who was relieved and recalled to Mukden by Viceroy Yevgeni Alekseyev after six battleships of the Pacific Squadron failed to reach Vladivostok as a result of the Battle of the Yellow Sea. Admiral Karl Jessen, who experienced the Battle off Ulsan, remained in Vladivostok.\nAdditionally, there were significant deficiencies in the Russian naval fleet's equipment and training. Russian naval tests with their torpedoes exposed major technological failings.}}\nBattle\nFirst contact\nBecause the Russians wanted to slip undetected into Vladivostok, they approached Japanese waters in radio silence. They steered outside regular shipping channels to reduce the chance of detection. On the night of 26 May 1905 the Russian fleet approached the Tsushima Strait.\nIn the night, thick fog blanketed the straits, giving the Russians an advantage. At 02:45 on 27 May Japan Standard Time (JST), the Japanese auxiliary cruiser  observed three lights on what appeared to be a vessel on the distant horizon and closed to investigate. These lights were from the Russian hospital ship Orel, in Russian, meaning \"Eagle\".  As two different spellings have traditionally been used in English for this Russian word, this article uses \"Oryol\" for the battleship and \"Orel\" for the hospital ship for clarity.}} which, in compliance with the rules of war, had continued to burn them. At 04:30, Shinano Maru approached the vessel, noting that she carried no guns and appeared to be an auxiliary. The Orel mistook the Shinano Maru for another Russian vessel and did not attempt to notify the fleet. Instead, she signaled to Shinano Maru in Russian code, which made no sense to the Japanese ship. The Shinano Maru then sighted the shapes of ten other Russian ships in the mist.\nWireless telegraphy played an important role from the start. At 04:55, Captain Narikawa of the Shinano Maru sent a message to the Combined Fleet command onboard Mikasa in Masampo that the \"Enemy is in grid 203\".  By 05:00, intercepted radio signals informed the Russians that they had been discovered and that Japanese scouting cruisers were shadowing them. Admiral Tōgō received the message at 05:05, and immediately began to prepare his battle fleet for a sortie.\nBeginning of the battle\non the \"Compass Deck\" above the bridge of  at the start of the battle. The signal flag being hoisted represents the letter Z, a special instruction to his fleet.}} in Kyūshū where the compass was dedicated as an oblation for the three daughter goddesses of god of mariners after this battle as the symbol of guiding the Combined Fleet.}} and side railings are rolled sailor hammocks (rolled canvas awnings on the mast) as a part of the \"prepare for battle\" procedure to reduce the risk posed by shrapnel.}}]]\nAt 06:34, before departing with the Combined Fleet, Admiral Tōgō wired a message to the navy minister in Tokyo:\n}}\nThe final sentence of this telegram has become famous in Japanese military history, and has been quoted by former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe.\nThe entire Japanese fleet was put to sea, with Tōgō in his flagship Mikasa leading over 40 vessels to meet the Russians. Meanwhile, the shadowing Japanese scouting vessels sent wireless reports every few minutes as to the formation and course of the Russian fleet. There was mist which reduced visibility and the weather was poor. Wireless gave the Japanese an advantage; in his report on the battle, Admiral Tōgō noted the following:\n}}\nAt 13:40, both fleets sighted each other, ready to engage. At around 13:55, Tōgō ordered the hoisting of the Z flag, issuing a predetermined announcement to the entire fleet:\n}}\nDaylight action\nThe Russians sailed from south-southwest to north-northeast; \"continuing to a point of intersection which allowed only their bow guns to bear; enabling him [Tōgō] to throw most of the Russian batteries successively out of bearing.\" The Japanese fleet steamed from northeast to southwest, then Tōgō ordered the fleet to turn 180-degrees in sequence, which enabled his ships to take the same course as the Russians. Rozhestvensky had only two alternatives, \"a charge direct, in line abreast\", or to commence \"a formal pitched battle.\" He chose the latter, and at 14:08, the Japanese flagship Mikasa'' was hit at about 7,000 metres, with the Japanese replying at 6,400 meters. Although Tōgō's U-turn was successful, Russian gunnery had proven surprisingly good and the flagship Mikasa was hit 15 times in five minutes.  Before the end of the engagement, she was struck 15 more times by large calibre shells. The Japanese fleet then steamed at 15 knots; the Russian at 11 in parallel engagement. Superior Japanese gunnery took its toll, with most of the Russian battleships being crippled in thirty minutes.\nCaptain 2nd Rank Vladimir Semenoff, a Russian staff officer aboard the flagship , said \"It seemed impossible even to count the number of projectiles striking us. Shells seemed to be pouring upon us incessantly one after another. The steel plates and superstructure on the upper decks were torn to pieces, and the splinters caused many casualties. Iron ladders were crumpled up into rings, guns were literally hurled from their mountings. In addition to this, there was the unusually high temperature and liquid flame of the explosion, which seemed to spread over everything. I actually watched a steel plate catch fire from a burst.\"\nNinety minutes into the battle, the first warship to be sunk was the  from Rozhestvensky's 2nd Battleship division. a rescued officer of Oslyabya said later on destroyer Buyniy, \"it was three Japanese shells accidentally hitting nearly the same spot on the waterline below the forward turret, creating a huge hole that caused the hull to almost heel over on the spot and settled under-water\" that sunk Oslyabya.|name=Oslyabya}} This was the first time a modern armoured warship had been sunk by gunfire alone.\nBy 14:45, Tōgō had \"crossed the Russian T\", enabling him to fire broadsides, while the Russians could reply only with their forward turrets.\nA direct hit on the 's magazines by the Japanese battleship Fuji caused her to explode, which sent smoke thousands of metres into the air and trapped all but one}} of her crew onboard as she sank. Rozhestvensky was knocked out of action by a shell fragment that struck his skull. In the evening, Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov took over command of the Russian fleet. The Russians lost the battleships Knyaz Suvorov, Oslyabya,  and Borodino. The Japanese ships suffered only light damage.\nNight attacks\nAt night, around 20:00, 21 destroyers and 45 Japanese torpedo boats}} were thrown against the Russians. They were deployed initially from the north, east and west while being slightly visible, forcing the Russians, roughly in the order of cruisers, battleships and auxiliaries groups, to turn west. The Japanese were aggressive, continuing their attacks for three hours without a break; as a result, during the night there were a number of collisions between the small craft and Russian warships. The Russians were dispersed in small groups. By 23:00, it appeared that the Russians had vanished, but they revealed their positions to their pursuers by switching on their searchlights – ironically, the searchlights had been turned on to spot the attackers. The old battleship  struck chained floating mines laid in front and was forced to stop in order not to push the chain forward, inviting other floating mines on the chain in on herself.  She was consequently torpedoed four times and sunk. Out of a crew of 622, only three survived, one to be rescued by the Japanese and the other two by a British merchant ship.\nThe battleship  was badly damaged by a torpedo in the stern and was scuttled the next day. Two old armoured cruisers –  and  – were badly damaged, the former by a torpedo hit to the bow, the latter by colliding with a Japanese destroyer. They were both scuttled by their crews the next morning off Tsushima Island, where they headed while taking on water. The night attacks placed a great strain on the Russians, as they lost two battleships and two armoured cruisers, while the Japanese lost only three torpedo boats.\nXGE signal and Russian surrender\nAt 05:23 on 28 May, what remained of the Russian fleet was sighted heading northeast. Tōgō's battleships proceeded to surround Nebogatov's remaining squadron south of the island of Takeshima and commenced main battery fire at 12,000 meters. The  then turned southeast and started to flee. Realising that his guns were outranged by at least one thousand metres, had lost its front left main gun, and the rear left gun could no longer be raised to extended-range elevations, meaning that only four 12-inch guns were left in the fleet: two older black-powder firing (shorter range) guns on , and two longer-range guns on the damaged Oryol that had however lost both of its rangefinders.}} and the Japanese battleships had proven on the day before to be faster than his own so that he could not close the distance if he tried, Nebogatov ordered the four battleships remaining under his command to surrender. XGE, an international signal of surrender, was hoisted; however, the Japanese navy continued to fire as they did not have \"surrender\" in their code books and had to hastily find one that did. Still under heavy fire, Nebogatov then ordered a white tablecloth sent up the masthead, but Tōgō, having faced the difficult decision to sink a British transport ship full of Chinese soldiers during the First Sino-Japanese War as the commander of IJN cruiser , fleeing from the Battle of Pungdo after raising a white flag and the Japanese naval ensign.}} knew the signal meant a request for a truce or parley, not 'surrender' in the legal definition, and that either meaning contradicted not stopping the ships.\nHis lieutenants found the codebook that included XGE signal and reported that stopping engines is a requirement for the signal and all the Russian ships were still moving, so he continued firing while the response flag signal \"STOP\" hoisted. Nebogatov then ordered St. Andrew's Cross lowered and the Japanese national flag raised on the gaff and all engines stopped.  Seeing the requirement for the signal met, Tōgō gave the cease-fire and accepted Nebogatov's surrender. Nebogatov surrendered knowing that he could be shot for doing so. He said to his men:\n}}\n}}]]\nAs an example of the level of damage inflicted on a Russian battleship,  was hit by five 12-inch, nine 8-inch, 39 six-inch and 21 smaller or unidentified shells. probably received the least number of large calibre shells and possibly the most number of small calibre hits among the four.}} This damage caused her to list, and the engine ceased to operate when she was being taken by the Japanese navy to First Battle Division home port of Sasebo in Nagasaki after Tōgō accepted the surrender.  Cruiser  and then battleship  had to tow Oryol, and their destination was changed to the closer Maizuru Naval Arsenal to avoid losing the prize of war.  Her commander Captain Yung, who was seriously injured on 27 May, died in the night of the 29th onboard battleship Asahi en route.\nCapture of Rozhestvensky\non 3 June 1905}} before she became IJN Satsuki.]]\nRussian destroyer Buyniy, after rescuing the squadron command including Admiral Rozhestvensky from the burning  at 17:30 during the day battle on the 27th, found cruiser Donskoi, destroyers Byedoviy and Grozniy in convoy on the morning of 28 May.  Rozhestvensky chose Byedoviy to move the fleet command officers and himself as Buyniy had serious damages and Donskoi, being an old ship, was very slow. (Later in the afternoon, Buyniy was sunk by gunfire from Donskoi after taking the crew aboard.) Leaving the struggling Buyniy and the slow Donskoi}} behind, Byedoviy and Grozniy headed for Vladivostok.\nJapanese destroyers  and  had mechanical issues during the night battle on the 27th and had to fix the problems at the Port of Ulsan.}} Both destroyers finished their temporary repair work by the morning of the 28th and left the port together. They spotted the two Russian destroyers on the way to join the rest of the Combined Fleet and engaged at 15:25.}} used by the admiral. He spent 350 Yen (equivalent to one year's Lieutenant salary) of personal funds to purchase the same model, and the binoculars had reached him stationed at Tsushima from the agent in Tōkyō before this battle.}}\nDestroyer Grozniy increased speed being chased by Kagerō, but Byedoviy slowed down and stopped in the face of firing and approaching Sazanami while raising a white flag. Byedoviy raised a white table cloth on the foremast, Red Cross flag on the rear mast, and had lowered the Saint Andrew's Cross from the stern flag pole, by the instruction of the Flag Captain Clapier de Colongue (the most senior officer onboard the destroyer after the injured admiral, outranking the ship commander Captain 2nd rank Nikolai Baranov), who reasoned Byedoviy had become a hospital ship.}} Grozniy was able to keep sufficient distance from Kagerō, exchanging just a few long-distance shots at about 18:30, before nightfall. She became one of the three warships reaching Vladivostok after surviving the battle.\nThe Combined Fleet command could not believe the news when cruiser , which rendezvoused Sazanami on the morning of the next day, sent a radio telegraph message about the capture of Admiral Rozhestvensky, as they were certain to have sunk Knyaz Suvorov and assumed the squadron commander went down with the flagship. But cruiser Akashi, accompanied by Sazanami and Kagerō, arrived at Sasebo port in the morning of 30 May with Byedoviy in tow, with not only the injured admiral but also the surviving members of the Russian fleet command onboard.\nConclusion\nin Saint Petersburg for high-value political criminals where Admiral Nebogatov was kept. Tsar Nicholas II, who was executed on 17 July 1918 and the remains found near Yekaterinburg in 1979, was interred in the white cathedral shown behind in 1998.  is displayed 1km away|name=aurora}} from this fortress.]]\nUntil the evening of 28 May, isolated Russian ships were pursued by the Japanese until almost all were destroyed or captured. The cruiser , which escaped from the Japanese despite being present at Nebogatov's surrender, was destroyed by her crew after running aground on the Siberian coast.\nwas carried out for Emperor Meiji on 23 October 1905 in Tokyo Bay.]]\nThe wounded Admiral Rozhestvensky went to the Imperial Japanese Naval Hospital in Sasebo to recover from a head injury caused by shrapnel; there, the victorious Admiral Tōgō visited him personally in plain clothes, comforting him with kind words: \"Defeat is a common fate of a soldier. There is nothing to be ashamed of in it. The great point is whether we have performed our duty.\"  Rozhestvensky was allowed to send a telegram to the Tsar at Tsarskoye Selo.\nOn 10 June 1905, Tsar Nicholas II responded with a telegram:\n\"Tokyo. Adjutant General Rozhdestvensky. From the bottom of my heart I thank you and all the ranks of the squadron who honestly fulfilled their duty in battle, for their selfless service to Russia. Your feat was destined to be crowned with success, but your fatherland will always be proud of your selfless courage. I wish you a speedy recovery, and may God console you all.&nbsp; Nikolai\"\nRozhestvensky and other officers were placed on trial in August 1905 after returning to Russia. Rozhestvensky claimed full responsibility for the fiasco and was sentenced to death, but the Tsar commuted his death sentence. Flag captains Clapier de Colongue (Second Pacific Squadron) and Cross (Third Pacific Squadron), Staff officers Filippinovsky, Leontieff, together with the commanders of the surrendered battleships, Captains Vladimir Smirnov (Nikolai I), Nikolai Lishin (Apraksin), Sergei Grogoryev (Senyavin), and the Byedoviy commander Nikolai Baranov were sentenced to 10 years in prison and dismissed from service (Nicholas II pardoned them on 1 May 1909). The executive officer of Oryol (who was in charge of the ship at the surrender) Captain 2nd rank K.L. Schwede and other officers were acquitted.\nAdmiral Nebogatov, who surrendered the fleet, was also sentenced to death, which was commuted to 10 years imprisonment and eventually pardoned by the Tsar. He was released from the Trubetskoy Bastion prison in Peter and Paul Fortress in May 1909.\nFollowing this battle, the Imperial Japanese Navy grew to the third largest in the world after World War I.  Tōgō Heihachirō was appointed to Order of Merit by King Edward VII on 21 February 1906, as one of the three first non-Dominion members, before he was enobled as Earl (Count) by Emperor Meiji in 1907.  Later, he became the first Japanese cover person of Time magazine on 8 November 1926 issue.\nContributing factors\nCommander and crew experience\nAdmiral Rozhestvensky faced a more combat-experienced battleship admiral in Tōgō Heihachirō. Admiral Tōgō had already killed two Russian admirals: Stepan Makarov outside of Port Arthur in the battleship Petropavlovsk in April 1904, then Wilgelm Vitgeft in his battleship  in August of the same year. Before those two deaths, Tōgō had chased Admiral Oskar Starck, also flying his flag in the Petropavlovsk, off the battlefield.\nAdmiral Tōgō and his men had two battleship fleet action experiences, which amounted to over four hours of combat experience in battleship-to-battleship combat at Port Arthur and the Yellow Sea.\nThe Japanese fleets had practiced gunnery extensively since the beginning of the war, using sub-calibre practice guns  mounted in their larger guns.}}), who learned about the decision after reaching Madagascar. The squadron conducted four practice sessions each at Nosy Be and Cam Ranh Bay.}}\nIn contrast,  underwent sea trials from 23 August to 13 September 1904 as a brand new ship upon her completion, and the new crew did not have much time for training before she set sail for the Pacific on 15 October 1904. Borodinos sister ship, , started trials on 9 August,  started trials the latest on 10 September 1904, leaving  (the trials finished in October 1903) as the only  ship actually ready for deployment., , and .}} As the Imperial Russian Navy planned on building 10 Borodino-class battleships (5 were ultimately built) with the requirement for thousands of additional crewmen, the basic training, quality and experience of the crew and cadets were far lower than those onboard the battleships in the seasoned Pacific Fleet.\nThe Imperial Russian Admiralty Council (Адмиралтейств-совет) and the rest of the Admiralty were quite aware of this disadvantage, and opposed the September dispatch plan.}} for the following reasons:\n1. The Japanese navy has completed the battle preparations with all the crew having some combat experience.\n2. The long voyage is mostly through extreme tropical weather, so a meaningful training is practically impossible on the way.\n3. Therefore, the newly created Second Pacific Fleet should conduct training in the Baltic until the next spring while waiting for the rigging of another battleship, , and the purchase of Chilean and Argentine warships.\nHowever, at the council in the imperial presence on 23 August 1904 held at the Peterhof Grand Palace, this opinion was overruled by Admiral Rozhestvensky (Commander in Chief of the Fleet), Navy Minister Avellan, and Tsar Nicholas II; for it was deemed impossible to re-arrange the massive coaling for the long voyage if the navy broke the contract that was already signed with Hamburg-American Steamship Line of Germany.\nSalvo firing director system\nUp to the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August 1904, naval guns were controlled locally by a gunnery officer assigned to that gun or a turret. He specified the elevation and deflection figures, gave the firing order while keeping his eyes on the inclinometers indicating the rolling and pitching angles of the ship, received the fall of shot observation report from the spotter on the mast, calculated the new elevation and deflection to 'walk' the shots in on the target for the next round, without much means to discern or measure the movements of his own ship and the target. He typically had a view on the horizon, but with the new 12-inch gun's range extended to over , his vantage point was lower than desired. for the R, the distance observable from the turret is sqrt(2 x 11 x 6371000m) = 11.8km. The distance observable from the bridge is sqrt(2 x 16 x 6371000m) = 14.3km. Mikasa's main guns had a range of 14km. (This explanatory note is provided for the benefit of the readers in accordance with WP:CALC.)}}\nIn the months before the battle, the Chief Gunnery Officer of Asahi, Lieutenant Commander Katō Hiroharu, aided by a Royal Navy advisor who introduced him to the use of the early mechanical computer Dumaresq in fire control, introduced a system for centrally issuing the gun-laying and salvo-firing orders by voice.}} Using a central system allowed the spotter to identify a salvo of distant shell splashes much more effectively than trying to identify a single splash among the many in the confusion of fleet-to-fleet combat. Further, the spotter needed to keep track of just one firing at a time as opposed to multiple shots on multiple stopwatches, in addition to having to report to just one officer on the bridge. The 'director' officer on the bridge had the advantage of having a higher vantage point than in the gun turrets, in addition to being steps away from the ship commander giving orders to change the course and the speed in response to the incoming reports on target movements.\nThis fire control director system was introduced to other ships in the fleet, and the training and practice on this system were carried out in the months waiting for the arrival of the Baltic Fleet while its progress was reported by the British intelligence from their naval stations at Gibraltar, Malta, Aden (Yemen), Cape of Good Hope, Trincomalee (Ceylon), Singapore and Hong Kong, among other locations.\nAs a result, Japanese fire was more accurate in the far range (),}} on top of the advantage they held in the shorter distances using the latest 1903 issue Barr and Stroud FA3 coincidence rangefinders of baselength ,  which had a range of , while the Russian battleships were equipped with Lugeol stadiametric rangefinders from the 1880s (except battleships Oslyabya and Navarin, which had the Barr and Stroud 1895 issue FA2 of baselength  retrofitted), which only had a range of about .\nWireless telegraphy\nThe wireless telegraph (radio) had been invented during the last half of the 1890s, and by the turn of the century, nearly all major navies were adopting this improved communications technology. Tsushima was \"the first major sea battle in which wireless played any role whatsoever\".\nLieutenant Akiyama Saneyuki (who was the key staff to Admiral Tōgō in formulating plans and directives before and during the battle as a Commander, who also went aboard Nikolai I to accompany Admiral Nebogatov to Mikasa for a formal meeting with Tōgō) had been sent to the United States as a naval attaché in 1897. He witnessed the capabilities of wireless telegraphy firsthand during the Spanish–American War, and sent several memos to the Navy General Staff urging that they push ahead as rapidly as possible to acquire the new technology. The IJN command became heavily interested in the technology; however, it found the Marconi wireless system, which was then operating with the Royal Navy, to be exceedingly expensive.\n(in plain clothes on the front row) and the members of Imperial Japanese Navy Wireless Telegraph Research Committee in 1900.]]\nThe Japanese therefore decided to create their own radio sets by setting up a wireless research committee under Professor Kimura Shunkichi, which eventually produced an acceptable system. In 1901, having attained radio transmissions of up to  with the Type 34 (34th year of Meiji = 1901) set, the Navy formally adopted wireless telegraphy. Two years later, a laboratory, a factory, and the wireless telegraphy curriculum were set up at Imperial Japanese Navy Mines Training School in Yokosuka to produce the Type 36 (1903) wireless sets,}} and these were quickly installed on every major warship in the Combined Fleet by the time the war started.\nAlexander Stepanovich Popov of the Naval Warfare Institute had built and demonstrated a wireless telegraphy set in 1900.  However, technology improvement and production in the Russian empire lagged those of Germany, and \"System Slaby-Arco\", originally made by Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft (AEG) and then produced in volume by its successor wireless-set maker Telefunken in Germany (by 1904, this system was in wide use by Kaiserliche Marine) was adopted by the Imperial Russian Navy. Although both sides had early wireless telegraphy, the Russians were using German sets tuned and maintained by German technicians half-way into the voyage, while the Japanese had the advantage of using their own equipment maintained and operated by their own navy specialists trained at the Yokosuka school.}}\nBritish support\nc. 1905–1910.]]\nThe United Kingdom assisted Japan by manufacturing guns and  were built in the US, but their main guns were Armstrong.  Cruisers  and  were built in Italy with Armstrong guns (Sir W.G. Armstrong & Company had a factory, Stabilimenti meccanici di Pozzuoli, in Italy). IJN licensed the design of Armstrong 8\" guns and had started producing it in 1902.}} and building battleships for the IJN.  As the ally in the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, the UK also assisted Japan in intelligence, finance, technology, training and other aspects of the war against Russia. At the time, Britain owned and controlled more harbour facilities around the world – specifically shipyards and coaling stations – than Russia and its allies (France, and to some extent Germany) combined. The UK also obstructed, where possible, Russian attempts to purchase ships and coal. France openly allowed the Baltic Fleet warships into Cherbourg and Tangier ports before and after the Dogger Bank Incident; and the UK formally protested in the post-Dogger Bank negotiations, pointing out that the neutral countries could not accept warships of the fighting countries into their ports without enforcing internment,), may have been acceptable to most governments in the world at the time. However, as it was incorporated into the 1907 Convention, it said  \"Belligerents are forbidden to use neutral ports and waters as a base of naval operations against their adversaries (Article 5)\" with further articles permitting up to 24-hour stay (Article 12) for the maximum of three warships of a belligerent at war in any neutral port (Article 15) if the neutral power permitted.}} and if France is no longer neutral in the war, the UK is obligated to commence military action in support of Japan as required in the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. As a result, the rendezvous point for Rozestvensky and Fölkersahm squadrons was changed from the port of Diego Suarez to the waters around remote islands of Île Sainte-Marie and Nosy Be in Madagascar, and free access to the ports including Saigon and Ba Ngoi port in Cam Ranh Bay was denied for the fleet in French Indochina. The German government, who had interned  at Qingdao on 11 August 1904, took a lenient stance towards the squadron as a neutral power in the war. After the Dakar stop, the Rozestvensky squadron reached Angra Pequena Bay in German South West Africa on 15 November 1904 (Gregorian), and the local Lüderitz authorities, busy in the Herero and Namaqua genocide, did not object to the mooring and coaling in the port until their departure on 21 November 1904.}}\nThis support created a major logistics problem for around the world deployment of the Baltic Fleet to the Pacific in procuring coal and supplies on the way. At Nosy Be in Madagascar and at Camranh Bay, French Indochina, the fleet was forced to be anchored for about two months each, seriously degrading morale of the crew. By the time it reached the Sea of Japan, the hulls of all the ships in the fleet were heavily fouled in addition to carrying the extra coal otherwise not required on deck.\nThe Japanese ships, on the other hand, were well maintained in the ample time given by the intelligence.  For example, battleship  was under repair from November 1904 to April 1905 at Sasebo Naval Arsenal for two 12-inch guns lost and serious damage to the hull from striking a mine.  They were divided into battle divisions of as much uniform speed and gun range so that a fleet would not suffer a bottleneck in speed, and the range of guns would not render some ships useless within a group in extended-range combat.\nAt the end of the Argentine–Chilean naval arms race in 1903, two Chilean-ordered and British-built battleships (then called Constitución and Libertad) and two Argentine-ordered, Italian-built cruisers (then called Bernardino Rivadavia and Mariano Moreno) were offered to Russia and the purchase was about to be finalised. Britain stepped in as the mediator of Pacts of May that ended the race, bought the Chilean battleships (which became  and ), and brokered the sale of Argentine cruisers to Japan.}} This support not only limited the growth of the Imperial Russian Navy but also helped IJN in obtaining the Italian-built cruisers (IJN  and ) with a strong armour design}} that enabled IJN to use them on the main line of battle along with the heavier-armoured battleships. and .}}\nHigh explosive and cordite\nThe Japanese used mostly high-explosive shells filled with Shimose powder, which was a pure picric acid (as opposed to the French Melinite or the British Lyddite, which were picric acid mixed with collodion (French) or with dinitrobenzene and vaseline (British) for stability). Engineer Shimose Masachika (1860–1911) solved the instability problem of picric acid on contact with iron and other heavy metals by coating the inside of a shell with unpigmented Japanese lacquer and further sealing with wax. Because it was undiluted, Shimose powder had a stronger power in terms of detonation velocity and temperature than other high explosives at the time.  These shells had a sensitive Ijuin fuse (named after Vice Admiral Ijuin Gorō) at the base as opposed to the tip of a shell that armed itself when the shell was spun by the rifling. These fuses were designed to explode on contact and wreck the upper structure of ships. 13 times with 12\" and 15 more times with 6\" or 8\" shells; hitting  18 times,  15 times,  12–14 times, and  11 times with 8\" and larger armour-piercing shells with delayed detonation fuze without being able to sink any of them (likewise none of the Japanese battleships was sunk despite receiving many hits) in the Battle of the Yellow Sea, the Japanese tactical priority shifted from sinking to the destruction of superstructure. This concept of high explosive incendiary shells (the first example of what is called the HEI-BF \"High Explosive Incendiary – Base Fuze\" shells today) was not used by any navy in the world at the time. The Russian Navy used what is known as Makarov tip on its shells to improve penetrating performance upon hitting the target at an angle, without the experience of high explosive armour-piercing shells not being effective enough against the Harvey / Krupp armour and compartmented hull used on the battleships.}} The Japanese Navy imported cordite from Great Britain as the smokeless propellant for these Shimose shells, of guncotton, compared to 19.3&nbsp;kg of Shimose powder for the Armstrong 12\".}}  Reload time was also improved from 2–4 minutes previously to a rated 90 seconds, but in reality, it was 2.5–3 minutes.  These guns were installed to Sissoi Veliky and the four Borodino-class ships.\nThe four Japanese battleships, Mikasa, Shikishima, Fuji and Asahi, had the latest Armstrong 12-inch 40-calibre naval gun designed and manufactured by Sir W.G. Armstrong & Company ahead of its acceptance by the Royal Navy in the UK.  These British-built 12-inch guns had a range of 15,000 yards (14&nbsp;km) at 15-degrees elevation and the rate of fire at 60 seconds with a heavier  shell.  One of the reasons for the Royal Navy's late adoption of this type of gun was the accidental shell explosions in the barrel Japanese battleships experienced up to the Battle of the Yellow Sea in August 1904, which were diagnosed and almost rectified by the Japanese Navy with the use of aforementioned Ijuin Fuse by the time of this battle.\nThe Russian fleet had 20 of the 1895-issue longer-range 12\" guns on five battleships compared to 16 of the Armstrong 12\" guns on four battleships for the Japanese. Statistically, this 20% advantage in the number of guns was much more than offset by the 60% disadvantage in the rate of fire difference of one shot in 2.5 minutes versus one minute.  The range difference of 11&nbsp;km versus 14&nbsp;km translated into a flatter trajectory (smaller elevation and fall angle) for the Japanese shells, which resulted in a better hit rate for the Japanese shots when both sides had an equal distance facing each other in 11&nbsp;km and shorter range., twice as a military attaché to Japanese consulate in Russia.}} on battleship Asahi. It turned out they knew each other from previous assignments of Nomoto in Russia. Schwede desperately wanted to know why the Japanese shots had so much better hit rates in the battle.  Nomoto did not (or could not) explain and just boasted \"Our guns are meant and made to hit the target.\"}}\nAftermath\nBattle damage and casualties\nSource:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Russian2nd. & 3rd.Pacific Fleet\n!rowspan=2|Primary Armament\n!rowspan=2|Water Line/Turret Armour\n!Disp./Length\n!rowspan=2|Speed in Knots\n!rowspan=2|Damage/Casualties/Remarks\n|-\n!Launched/Builder\n|-\n|,battleship\n|4 10-inch guns11 6-inch guns\n|9 inches9 inches\n|14,639tons/132.4m\n|18.3\n|First modern battleship sunk by gunfire alone, sunk at 15:10 27 May.

IJN concealed the loss and gave the 'Akatsuki' name to the captured Reshitel‘nyi as if the original returned to service. At the beginning of this battle, there was a plan to dispatch Akatsuki, being indistinguishable from other Russian destroyers, in front of the Baltic Fleet to lay chained floating mines. Tōgō did not use this ploy, and the destroyer was added to the Navy list as Yamabiko (and Akatsuki struck) after the war.}}\n|}\nRussian losses\nRussian personnel losses were 216 officers and 4,614 men killed; with 278 officers and 5,629 men taken as Prisoners Of War (POW). Interned in neutral ports were 79 officers and 1,783 men.  Escaping to Vladivostok and Diego-Suarez were 62 officers and 1,165 men.\nThe battle was humiliating for Russia, which lost all its battleships and most of its cruisers and destroyers. The battle effectively ended the Russo-Japanese War in Japan's favour. The Russians lost 4,380 killed and 5,917 captured with a further 1,862 interned. Two admirals, Rozhestvensky and Nebogatov, were captured by the Japanese Navy. The second in command of the fleet, Rear Admiral Dmitry Gustavovich von Fölkersahm, after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage on 16 April, died in the night of 24 May 1905 onboard battleship . Vice Admiral Oskar Enqvist fled to Manila onboard cruiser  and was interned by the United States.\nBattleships\nThe Russians lost eleven battleships, including three smaller coastal battleships, either sunk or captured by the Japanese, or scuttled by their crews to prevent capture. Four were lost to enemy action during the daylight battle on 27 May: , ,  and .  was lost during the night action on 27–28 May, while the  and  were either scuttled or sunk the next day. Four other battleships, under Rear Admiral Nebogatov, were forced to surrender and would end up as prizes of war. This group consisted of only one modern battleship, , along with the old battleship  and two small coastal battleships  and .\nCruisers\nThe Russian Navy lost five of its nine cruisers during the battle, three more were interned by the Americans, with just one reaching Vladivostok.  and  were sunk the next day after the daylight battle. The cruiser  fought against six Japanese cruisers on the 28th and barely survived with many officers and crew killed onboard, and was scuttled on 29 May 1905 due to heavy damage. Izumrud ran aground on the Siberian coast. Three Russian protected cruisers, , , and , escaped to the U.S. naval base at Manila in the then-American-controlled Philippines where they were interned by the United States. The armed yacht (classified as a cruiser) , alone was able to reach Vladivostok.\nDestroyers and auxiliaries\nImperial Russia also lost six of its nine destroyers in the battle, had one interned by the Chinese, and the other two reached Vladivostok. Buyniy (\"Буйный\"),  Bezuprechniy (\"Безупречный\"), Gromkiy (\"Громкий\") and Blestyashchiy (\"Блестящий\") were sunk on 27 May. Bistriy (\"Быстрый\") was beached and destroyed by her crew the next day. Byedoviy (\"Бедовый\") surrendered also on 28 May. Destroyer Bodriy (\"Бодрый\") ran out of coal, and was interned in Shanghai. Grozniy (\"Грозный\") and Braviy (\"Бравый\") reached Vladivostok.\nOf the auxiliaries, repair ship Kamchatka, auxiliary cruiser  and ocean tug Rus were sunk on 27 May, auxiliary cruiser Irtysh was disabled, abandoned on 28 May, then sank on 29 May. Ammunition ship Koreya and ocean tug Svir reached Shanghai and returned home. After being ordered to separate from the fleet on 22 May, auxiliary cruisers Kuban and Terek were interned at Batavia in Dutch East Indies by the Netherlands on 9 June 1905 after raiding a British and a Danish steamer destined for Japan. Transports Yaroslavl, Vladimir, Kuronia, Voronezh, Livonia and Meteor were detached from the fleet on 25 May, reached Shanghai and returned home. Auxiliary cruisers Rion and Dniepr escorted the transports to Shanghai, engaged in commerce raiding activities in the Yellow Sea, and returned to Kronstadt on 31 July 1905. Transports Mercury, Tambov, Herman Lerke, Count Stroganov and repair ship Ksenia, which accompanied the Third Pacific Fleet to Cam Ranh Bay, had been sent home via Saigon. Merchant cruiser Anadyr escaped to Madagascar and then returned home. The hospital ships Orel and Kostroma were captured during the battle; Kostroma was released afterwards.\nJapanese losses\nThe Japanese lost three torpedo boats (Nos. 34, 35 and 69). Personnel losses were 117 officers and men killed and 583 officers and men wounded.\nPolitical consequences\nImperial Russia's prestige was badly damaged and the defeat was a blow to the Romanov dynasty. Most of the Russian fleet was lost; the fast armed yacht Almaz (classified as a cruiser of the 2nd rank) and the destroyers Grozny and Bravy were the only Russian ships to reach Vladivostok. In The Guns of August, the American historical writer and journalist Barbara Tuchman argued that because Russia's loss destabilised the balance of power in Europe, it emboldened the Central Powers and contributed to their decision to go to war in 1914.\nThe battle had a profound cultural and political impact on the world. It was the first defeat of a European power by an Asian nation in the modern era. It also heightened the alarm of \"The Yellow Peril\" as well as weakening the notion of white superiority that was prevalent in some Western countries. Mahatma Gandhi (India), Mustafa Kemal Atatürk (Turkey), Sun Yat-sen (China) and Jawaharlal Nehru (India) were amongst the future national leaders to celebrate this defeat of a colonial power. The victory established Japan as the sixth greatest naval power while the Russian navy declined to one barely stronger than that of Austria-Hungary.\nIn The Guinness Book of Decisive Battles, the British historian Geoffrey Regan argues that the victory bolstered Japan's increasingly aggressive political and military establishment. According to Regan, the lopsided Japanese victory at Tsushima:...created a legend that was to haunt Japan's leaders for forty years. A British admiral once said, 'It takes three years to build a ship, but 300 years to build a tradition.' Japan thought that the victory had completed this task in a matter of a few years ... It had all been too easy. Looking at Tōgō's victory over one of the world's great powers convinced some Japanese military men that with more ships, and bigger and better ones, similar victories could be won throughout the Pacific. Perhaps no power could resist the Japanese navy, not even Britain and the United States.\nRegan also believes the victory contributed to the Japanese road to later disaster, \"because the result was so misleading. Certainly the Japanese navy had performed well, but its opponents had been weak, and it was not invincible... Tōgō's victory [helped] set Japan on a path that would eventually lead her\" to the Second World War.\nTakano Isoroku, the future Japanese admiral Yamamoto Isoroku who would plan the attack on Pearl Harbor and command the Imperial Japanese Navy through much of the Second World War, served as a junior officer (aboard ) during the battle and was wounded and lost two fingers by an accidental explosion of an 8-inch shell in a forward gun. Had he lost a third, he would have been medically discharged from the IJN.\nDreadnought arms race\nPrior to the Russo-Japanese War, countries constructed their battleships with mixed batteries of mainly 6-inch (152&nbsp;mm), 8-inch (203&nbsp;mm), 10-inch (254&nbsp;mm) and 12-inch (305&nbsp;mm) guns, with the intent that these battleships fight on the battle line in a close-quarter, decisive fleet action. The Battle of Tsushima conclusively demonstrated that faster battleships and big guns with longer ranges were superior to batteries of mixed-size guns.\n, laid down on 15 May 1905, earlier than HMS Dreadnought, was designed with 12 x 12\" 40 Cal. guns.(She ended up with 4 x 12\" 45 Cal. Armstrong plus 12 x 10\" 45 Cal. Vickers guns and became the largest battleship in the world at launch in 1906.)]]\nBritain's First Sea Lord, Admiral Jackie Fisher, reasoned that the Japanese victory at Tsushima confirmed the importance of large guns and speed for modern battleships. Captain William Pakenham of the British Royal Navy, who had been present aboard the Japanese battleship Asahi as an official observer during the Tsushima Battle, \"famously remarked...the effect of the fire of every gun is so much less than that of the next larger size, that when 12in guns are firing, shots from 10in pass unnoticed...everything in this war has tended to emphasize the vast importance to a ship, at every stage of her career, of carrying some of the heaviest and furthest shooting guns that can be  got into her.\" In October 1905 the British started the construction of , which marked the beginning of a naval arms race between Britain and Germany in the years before 1914.\nThe battle also accelerated the naval arms race on a geopolitical level; though the Anglo-German naval arms race had begun in 1897, the collapse of Russian naval power in 1905 allowed Britain to send the bulk of its naval forces to other regions, reassured by the naval superiority of its ally Japan in the Far East. In turn, the presence of a larger British fleet in Europe meant that the Germans felt forced to build a proportionally larger fleet to maintain the same relative power, in accordance with Tirpitz's fleet in being principle. The Royal Navy, in turn, must increase its fleet size to maintain the relative power as set out by its two-power standard. This positive feedback meant that any external increase in the regional naval power of one side – in this case, the British – would precipitate not just a proportional increase in naval power from the opposing side, but rather a mutual multi-stage build-up in naval power on both sides, before settling to a higher equilibrium. Ultimately, the Germans passed three of its five Fleet Acts after Tsushima within a span of 6 years.\nUpon the outbreak of World War I, the British and Germans were both aware of the potentially devastating consequences of a naval defeat on the scale of Tsushima. Britain needed its battle fleet to protect its empire, and the trade routes vital to its war effort. Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, described British Admiral John Jellicoe as \"the only man who on either side could lose the war in an afternoon.\" German naval commanders, for their part, understood the importance Kaiser Wilhelm II attached to his navy and the diplomatic prestige it carried. As a result of caution, the British and German fleets met in only one major action in World War I, the indecisive Battle of Jutland.\nTimeline\nin Saint Petersburg, Russia]]\n's flagship at the battle of Tsushima, preserved as a memorial in Yokosuka, Japan]]\nNote}}\n27 May 1905 (JST)\n* 04:45 The Shinano Maru (Japan) locates the Russian Baltic Fleet and sends a wireless message \"Spotted enemy fleet in grid 203.\" to cruiser , which relays it to the Combined Fleet flagship Mikasa.\n* 05:05 Tōgō receives the message, begins preparation to depart.\n* 05:55  relays 's report \"Enemy appears to be headed for the Eastern channel of Tsushima.\"\n* 06:05 The 1st (, , , , , ), 2nd (, , , , , ) and 4th (, , , ) battle divisions of the Japanese Combined Fleet leave Jinhae (Chinhae, or Chinkai) Bay}} head South East at 12 knots. \"Weather is half-cloudy, wind from the South West, wave is still high from the stormy weather in the last two days.\"\n* 06:20 \"Prepare for battle\" ordered on Mikasa.\n* 07:00 Cruiser  relieves Shinano Maru of reporting task, closes in to 10,000 metres of  on the starboard, then increases the distance and shadows the Baltic Fleet alone; reports \"Enemy fleet is in grid 224 (20&nbsp;nm NW of Ukushima Island, Nagasaki) heading North North East\".\n* 08:30  reports \"3rd battle div. is at grid 251(), heading NNE at 10 Knots.\"\n* 09:39 1st battle division reaches 10nm NNE of Mitsushima Lighthouse}}, turns ESE at 15 knots.\n* 10:00 Mikasa sends a wireless message to the Imperial General Headquarters: \"Upon receiving its spotting report, Combined Fleet is going into battle with enemy fleet today near Okinoshima Island.
