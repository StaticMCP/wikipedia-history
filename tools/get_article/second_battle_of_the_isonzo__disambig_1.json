The major role, assigned to the Duke of Aosta's Third Army, was to conquer Monte San Michele () and Mount Cosich (), cutting the enemy line and opening the way to Gorizia.\nGeneral Cadorna's tactics were to advance his troops in a frontal assault against the Austro-Hungarian line, overcome the enemy's barbed-wire fences, and take the trenches, after a heavy artillery bombardment. The insufficiency of war materiel – from rifles, to artillery shells, to shears to cut barbed wire – nullified the Italians' numerical superiority.\nThe battle\nThe Karst Plateau was the site of an exhausting series of hand-to-hand fights involving the Italian Second and Third Armies, with severe casualties on both sides. Bayonets, swords, knives, and various scrap metal and debris were all used in the melee fights. The Austro-Hungarian 20th Honvéd Infantry Division lost two-thirds of its effective strength and was routed due to a combination of the successive Italian Army attacks and the unfavorable terrain.\nOn 25 July the Italians occupied the Cappuccio Wood, a position west of Mount San Michele, which was not very steep but dominated quite a large area including the Austro-Hungarian bridgehead of Gorizia from the South. Mount San Michele was briefly held by Italian forces, but was recaptured during a desperate counterattack by Colonel Richter, who commanded a group of elite regiments.\nIn the northern section of the front, the Julian Alps, the Italians managed to overrun Mount Batognica over Kobarid (), which would have an important strategic value in future battles.\nThe battle wore down when both sides ran out of ammunition. The total casualties during the three-week battle were about 91,000&nbsp;men, of which 43,000&nbsp;Italians and 48,000&nbsp; Austro-Hungarians.\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Macdonald, John, and Željko Cimprič.
