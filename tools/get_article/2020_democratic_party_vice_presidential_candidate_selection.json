Former Vice President Joe Biden of Delaware, the 2020 Democratic nominee for President of the United States, considered several prominent Democrats and other individuals before selecting Senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate on August 11, 2020. Harris formally won the vice presidential nomination on August 19, 2020, at the 2020 Democratic National Convention. The Biden–Harris ticket would go on to defeat the Trump–Pence ticket in the general election.\nIn March 2020, Biden promised to select a woman as his running mate, which marked the third time that the vice presidential nominee of a major party in the United States has been a woman, after Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and Sarah Palin in 2008.\nHarris became the vice president upon inauguration in January 2021 alongside President Biden. She is the first woman to be vice president of the United States, making her the highest-ranking woman in U.S. history, and she is also the first Asian American and Black American vice president. She would go on to become the Democratic presidential nominee in 2024 after Biden withdrew his bid from re-election, but ultimately lost to former President Donald Trump in the general election.\nSelection process\nAt the March 15, 2020, Democratic primary debate between former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Biden committed to selecting a woman as his running mate. At that same debate, Sanders stated that he would likely do the same, but did not pledge to do so. Biden became the presumptive presidential nominee after Sanders dropped out on April 8, though the Democratic ticket would not be officially nominated until the 2020 Democratic National Convention in August 2020. With his pledge, his running mate became the third woman to be the vice presidential nominee of a major party in United States history, following Democrat Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and Republican Sarah Palin in 2008.\nBiden indicated that he would make his selection on the basis of shared political beliefs and past experience. He noted that his selection would likely be younger than he is and that he would likely pick someone who is \"ready on Day 1 to be president.\" On April 30, it was announced that the vetting committee would consist of Lisa Blunt Rochester, Chris Dodd, Eric Garcetti, and Cynthia Hogan.\nAnnouncement\nBiden had initially planned to make his announcement regarding his running mate selection \"around\" August 1. The announcement date was later pushed back to the second week in August. On August 11, it was reported that Biden had selected his running mate and an announcement was imminent.\nLater that day, Kamala Harris was revealed as Biden's vice presidential running mate. Harris was the junior U.S. senator from California, first elected in 2016. She additionally has experience as the Attorney General of California, San Francisco District Attorney, and as a prosecutor. Harris was a candidate in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, before suspending her campaign in December 2019, later endorsing Biden's campaign in March 2020. Harris was the third woman vice presidential running mate of a major party and the first Asian American. Harris additionally is the first Democrat from the Western United States to appear on a presidential ticket; Barack Obama was born in Hawaii, a Western state, but was nominated as a representative of Illinois.\nVetting process\nFinalists\nOn August 13, The New York Times reported the four finalists were Kamala Harris, Susan Rice, Elizabeth Warren, and Gretchen Whitmer.\nFile:Kamala Harris official photo (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Susan E.

Gretchen Whitmer (cropped).jpg|}}\nShortlist\nThe Biden campaign was reported to have begun the vetting process of potential running mates in May 2020. The following officials were reported to have undergone vetting by the Biden campaign. However, following the George Floyd protests, Amy Klobuchar was criticized for her lack of prosecution of police misconduct during her tenure as Hennepin County County Attorney, including a case involving the officer who murdered Floyd. On June 18, she announced that she had removed herself from consideration and urged for Biden to select a woman of color.\nOn June 12, the Associated Press reported that Keisha Lance Bottoms, Val Demings, Kamala Harris, Michelle Lujan Grisham, Susan Rice, and Elizabeth Warren had advanced to further stages in the vetting process, with the possibility that some other vetted candidates had as well. On June 26, CNN reported that Bottoms, Demings, Harris, and Warren were at that point the leading candidates for the nomination.\nOn July 29, just a week before Biden's initially planned announcement, The Hill reported that Karen Bass, Harris, Rice, and Warren had emerged as the \"top tier\" of candidates. On August 2, CNN reported that Tammy Duckworth and Gretchen Whitmer were also still under consideration. On August 10, The New York Times reported that Biden's running mate committee had finished interviewing the possible candidates and that an announcement was \"imminent\".\nIn addition to the four finalists, the following individuals were reported to be on Biden's shortlist.\nFile:SenTammyBaldwin (cropped).jpg|}}\nFile:Mayor Karen Bass official portrait (crop 2).jpg|}}|alt=RepresentativeKaren Bassfrom California(2011–2023)\nFile:Keisha Lance Bottoms (46601210695) (cropped).jpg|}}\nFile:Val Demings, Official Portrait, 115th Congress (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Tammy Duckworth 115th official portrait (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Maggie Hassan, official portrait, 115th Congress (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Amy Klobuchar 2019 (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Michelle Lujan Grisham 2021.jpg |\nFile:Governor Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island.jpg|\nDeclined to be considered\nThe following individuals publicly confirmed that they had declined to be vetted by the Biden campaign.\nCatherine Cortez Masto official portrait.jpg|}}\nFile:Shaheen Senate Portrait.jpg |}}\nMedia speculation about other potential running mates\nThe following individuals received coverage as potential running mates from multiple news sources, but were not reported to have been asked to undergo vetting by the Biden campaign.\nFederal executive branch officials\nJulian Castro by Gage Skidmore (2) (cropped).jpg|}}\nHillary Clinton by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|}}\nJanet Napolitano 2018 (cropped).jpg|}}\nHilda Solis 2013 (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Condoleezza Rice July 2018.jpg|from California(2005–2009)}}\nSally Q.
