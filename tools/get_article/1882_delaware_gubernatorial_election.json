Hall was unable to seek re-election. Former State Senator Charles C. Stockley ran as the Democratic nominee to succeed Hall and faced Republican nominee Albert Curry. The Republican Party campaigned on organizing a new constitutional convention and launched a vigorous statewide effort. However, Stockley defeated Curry by a decisive margin and a unanimously Democratic state legislature was elected alongside him, securing the Party's dominance in the state for another four years.\nGeneral election\nResults\nReferences\nBibliography\n* }}\n*\n*\n* Delaware Senate Journal, 79th General Assembly, 1st Reg.
