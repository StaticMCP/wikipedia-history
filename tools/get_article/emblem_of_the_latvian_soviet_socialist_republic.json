It was based on the emblem of the Soviet Union. It features symbols of agriculture (wheat) and Latvia's maritime culture (a sunset over the Baltic Sea). The red star as well as the hammer and sickle for the victory of communism and the \"world-wide socialist community of states\".\nThe banner bears the USSR State motto (\"Proletarians of all countries, unite!\") in both Latvian language (Visu zemju proletārieši, savienojieties!) and Russian. The name of the Latvian SSR is shown only in Latvian, and reads Latvijas PSR, the PSR standing for Padomju Sociālistiskā Republika, or Soviet Socialist Republic.\nUntil 1978, a gold star was used in the state emblem.\nThe coat of arms of Latvia was restored in 1990. The use and exhibition of the emblem of the SSR is now banned in Latvia, due to a law approved in 2013.\nHistory\nIn the period from the creation of Latvian SSR on July 21 to August 25, 1940, the coat of arms of the Republic of Latvia continued to be used. On August 17, 1940, postage stamps of the 10th standard issue were issued in accordance with the drawings of the artist Jānis Šternbergs with the image of the state small arms. On August 25, 1940, in the second session of the People's Saeima of the LSSR the Constitution of the Latvian SSR was approved, Article 116 of which described the coat of arms of the SSR:\nIn the description it is indicated that the sun \"rises from the sea\", but due to the geographical features of Latvia, located on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea, the sun over the sea could be seen only in the west, i.e. on the sunset. This fact then became the reason for many jokes about the decline of socialism in Latvia.\nThe project of the emblem was created by graphic artist , a former pupil of Rihards Zariņš and a professor of the Art Academy of Latvia. Unlike the arms of the USSR and the arms of the majority of other SSRs, the hammer handle was located above the blade of the sickle, and not under it.\nMost of the revisions after the creations of the coat of arms were barely noticeable.\nThe new edition of the Regulations on the State Emblem of the Latvian SSR, published in 1979, clarified that \"the star is depicted in red\" and a color and the outline of the state emblem of the Latvian SSR is given.\nRestoration of the Latvian coat of arms\nOn July 28, 1989, the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR adopted the declaration \"On State Sovereignty of the Latvian SSR\". Later, on February 15, 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR adopted \"On the State Emblem of the Latvian SSR\", thus restored the pre-war Coat of arms of Latvia as the official coat of arms.\nSee also\n* Coat of arms of Latvia\nReferences"
