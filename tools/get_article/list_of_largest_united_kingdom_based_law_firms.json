      "text": "# List of largest United Kingdom–based law firms\n\n}}\nThis is a list of the world's largest United Kingdom–based law firms by revenue in the financial year 2024. This data is based on the law firms official financial report for the 2023/24 financial year running from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024. The list contains the 17 law firms which generated over half a billion US dollars in this period. 16 of which are London-based and 1 headquarter in Manchester.\nA few UK-based law firms have merged with another entity which may be located outside of the UK. For example, Allen & Overy (London) merged with Shearman (New York) in May 2024; the result of this is the removal of the US revenue and number of lawyers from the list to account for its UK operations. Some data from the number of lawyers at the firms are from the 2022/23 financial year, as the firms have not updated as of January 2025.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Largest United Kingdom–based law firms\n|-\n!

This is because these firms structurally differ from the firms listed above, especially when it comes to sharing profits. Some of these firms include DLA Piper, Baker McKenzie, Dentons, Norton Rose Fulbright and Squire Patton Boggs among others.\nSee also\n* List of largest law firms by profits per partner\n* List of largest law firms by revenue\n* List of largest United States-based law firms by profits per partner\n* List of largest Canada-based law firms by revenue\n* List of largest Europe-based law firms by revenue\n* List of largest Japan-based law firms by head count\n* List of largest China-based law firms by revenue\nReferences"
