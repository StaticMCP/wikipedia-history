The Hindu Shahis quickly abandoned their capitals, and Gandhara was brought into the Ghaznavid fold.\"\n| result            = Ghaznavid victory\n| combatant1        = Ghaznavid Empire\n| combatant2        = Hindu Shahi\n| commander1        = Mahmud of Ghazni\n| commander2        = Jayapala\n| strength1         = 15,000 cavalry\n| strength2         = 12,000 cavalry 30,000 infantry300 elephants\n| casualties2       =\n| coordinates       =\n| map_type          = South Asia#Gandhara\n| map_relief        =\n| map_size          = 300\n| map_marksize      =\n| map_caption       =\n| map_label         = Battle of Peshawar\n}}\nThe Battle of Peshawar was fought on 27 November 1001 between the Ghaznavid army of Mahmud of Ghazni and the Hindu Shahi army of Jayapala, near Peshawar. Jayapala was defeated and captured, and as a result of the humiliation of the defeat, he later immolated himself in a funeral pyre. This is the first of many major battles in the expansion of the Ghaznavid Empire into the Indian subcontinent by Mahmud.\nBackground\nIn 962, Alp-Tegin, a Turkic ghulam or slave soldier, who rose to be the commander of the army in Khorasan in the service of the Samanids, seized Ghazna and set himself up as a ruler there. In 997, Mahmud ascended the throne at Ghazni, a successor to Sabuktigin, Mahmud started to vigorously expand his domain, and vowed to invade India every year until the northern lands were his. In 1001 he arrived at Peshawar with a select group of 15,000 cavalry, and a large corps of ghazis and Afghans. This began a struggle with the Hindu Shahi kingdom which extended from Laghman to Kashmir and from Sirhind to Multan. The Hindu Shahi ruler Jayapala attacked the Ghaznavids, but was defeated, then again later when his army of a reported size of over 100,000 was beaten. The territories were annexed by the Ghaznavids.\nBattle\nAn account of the battle between the invading Turkic Ghaznavids and the Shahi kingdom was given by Al-Utbi in Tarikh Yamini. According to Al-Utbi, Mahmud pitched his tent outside the city upon reaching Peshawar. Jayapala avoided action for some time waiting for reinforcements, and Mahmud then took the decision to attack with swords, arrows, and spears. Jayapala moved his cavalry and elephants to engage his opponent, but his army was decisively defeated.\nAccording to the sources, Jayapala, along with members of his family were captured, and valuable personal adornments were taken off the prisoners, including a necklace of great value from Jayapala. The number of Hindu dead ranged from 5,000 to 15,000, and five hundred thousands were said to have been taken captive. Judging from the personal adornments taken off captured Hindus, Jayapala's army was not prepared for battle and thousands of children were taken captive as well.\nAftermath\nThere are differing views regarding the fate of Jayapala.\nSir HM Elliot, a historian who worked with the East India Company, writes:\nJayapala was bound and paraded, and a large ransom was paid for the release of members of his family. Jayapala felt the defeat to be a great humiliation, and later he built himself a funeral pyre, lit it, and threw himself into the fire.\nHowever, Satish Chandra says:\nAccording to some later accounts, Jayapala had entered a funeral pyre following his defeat because he felt he had disgraced himself. The story that he had been taken prisoner by Mahmud and then released seems doubtful.\nMahmud later conquered the upper Indus region, and then in 1009, defeated Jayapala's son Anandapala in a battle at Chach. He then captured Lahore and Multan, giving him control of the Punjab region.\nSee also\n* Janjua\n* History of Peshawar\n* History of India\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
