This chronological list comprises all those who have held the position of president of the first team of Atlético Madrid from 1903, when the first president was elected, to the present day. Each president's entry includes his dates of tenure, honours won, and significant achievements while under his care.\nThroughout its history, only two presidents have been at the head of the club on two different occasions: Julián Ruete, whose first term was between 1912 and 1919, returning a year later to the presidency, where he remained until 1923, and Vicente Calderón, who was president between 1964 and 1980 and between 1982 and 1987.\nAdding his two terms, Vicente Calderón is the one who has remained in office the longest, with a total of 21 years. He is closely followed by Enrique Cerezo with 20 years in the presidency, Jesús Gil with 16, Julián Ruete with 10, and Javier Barroso with 9.\nList of presidents\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Count\n!From\n!Until\n!Honours\n!Achievements\n|-\n|Enrique Allende\n|\n|1903\n|1903\n|\n|\n|-\n|Eduardo de Acha\n|\n|1903\n|1907\n|\n|He drafted the very first Statutes of the club in 1906.\n|-\n|Ricardo de Gondra\n|\n|1907\n|1909\n|\n|\n|-\n|Ramón de Cárdenas\n|\n|1909\n|1912\n|\n|\n|-\n|Julián Ruete\n|\n|1912\n|1919\n|\n|He inaugurated the O'Donnell field in 1913.\n|-\n|Álvaro de Aguilar\n|\n|1919\n|1920\n|\n|\n|-\n|Julián Ruete\n|\n|1920\n|1923\n|1 Copa del Rey final\n|\n|-\n|Juan Estefanía\n|\n|1923\n|1926\n|1 Regional Championship1 Copa del Rey final\n|He eliminated all articles from the statutes that made reference to the club's Basque origins.\n|-\n|Luciano Urquijo\n|\n|1926\n|1931\n|\n|He faced the professionalization of football under his mandate.\n|-\n|Rafael González Iglesias\n|\n|1931\n|1935\n|\n|Achieved promotion to the top tier.\n|-\n|José Luis del Valle\n|\n|1935\n|1936\n|\n|\n|-\n|José Maria Fernández\n|\n|1936\n|1939\n|\n|-\n|Francisco Vives\n|\n|1939\n|1939\n|\n|Main architect behind the merge between Atlético and Aviación.\n|-\n|Luis Navarro\n|\n|1939\n|1941\n|1 La Liga1 Spanish Super Cup1 regional championship\n|\n|-\n|Manuel Gallego\n|\n|1941\n|1945\n|1 La Liga\n|Atlético returned to the Metropolitano.\n|-\n|Juan Touzón\n|\n|1946\n|1947\n|\n|The club changed its name to Atlético Madrid.\n|-\n|Cesáreo Galíndez\n|\n|1947\n|1952\n|2 La Liga1 Copa Presidente\n|\n|-\n|Luis Benitez de Lugo\n|\n|1952\n|1955\n|\n|\n|-\n|Jesús Suevos\n|\n|1955\n|1955\n|\n|He created the Athletic Senate, made up of the first hundred members of the club.\n|-\n|Javier Barroso\n|\n|1955\n|1964\n|2 Copa del Rey\n|\n|-\n|Vicente Calderón\n|\n|1964\n|1980\n|4 La Liga3 Copa del Rey1 Intercontinental Cup\n|\n|-\n|Ricardo de Irezábal\n|\n|1980\n|1980\n|\n|\n|-\n|Alfonso Cabeza\n|\n|1980\n|1982\n|\n|\n|-\n|Antonio del Hoyo\n|\n|1982\n|1982\n|\n|\n|-\n|Agustín Cotorruelo\n|\n|1982\n|1982\n|\n|\n|-\n|Vicente Calderón\n|\n|1982\n|1987\n|1 Copa del Rey\n|\n|-\n|Francisco Javier\n|\n|1987\n|1987\n|\n|\n|-\n|Jesús Gil\n|\n|1987\n|2003\n|1 La Liga3 Copa del Rey\n|\n|-\n|Enrique Cerezo\n|\n|2003\n|Present\n|2 La Liga2 Copa del Rey\n|\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.athletic-club.eus/en/presidents] Presidents at Athletic Bilbao official website"
