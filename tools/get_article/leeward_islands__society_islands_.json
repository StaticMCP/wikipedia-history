They lie south of the Line Islands (part of Kiribati), east of the Cooks and north of the Austral Islands (also part of French Polynesia). Their area is around  and their population is over 36,000.\nHistory\nThe first European to encounter the archipelago was British naval officer James Cook on 12 April 1769 during a British expedition the purpose of which was to observe the transit of Venus. He later revisited the islands twice more. It is a common misconception that he named the Leeward group of islands \"Society\" in honor of the Royal Society. However, Cook recorded in his journal that he named the islands \"Society\" because they lie close to each other.\nIn 1840, France declared a protectorate over Tahiti. In 1847, the British and French signed the Jarnac Convention and these islands became a colony of France in 1888 (eight years after the Windward Islands did). There were many native resistance movements and conflicts in reaction to this annexation, known as the Leewards War, which continued until 1897.\nGeography\nisland from a plane]]\nThe islands are mountainous, consisting of volcanic rock. They are formed of trachyte, dolerite and basalt. There are raised coral beds high up the mountains, and lava occurs in a variety of forms, even in solid flows. Volcanic activity ceased so long ago that the craters have been almost entirely obliterated by erosion.\nThe Leeward Islands that lie more to the east are a mainly volcanic island cluster:\n* Bora Bora (), known for its tourism industry and World War II-era United States naval base\n* Huahine (), the easternmost island of the group; split at high tide into the northern Huahine Nui (\"big Huahine\") and southern Huahine Iti (\"small Huahine\")\n* Maupiti ()\n* Tupai atoll\n* Raiatea ( or ), the largest island in the group, holding the archipelago's administrative center (Uturoa) and tallest point (Mount Tefatua)\n* Tahaʻa (), which lies just north of Uturoa\nThe westernmost Leeward Islands comprise a three atoll group: Manuae (also known as Scilly Atoll); Motu One atoll (also known as Bellinghausen), the most northerly of the Leeward Islands; and Maupihaa atoll (also known as Mopelia) to the southeast.\nFlora and fauna\nFlora includes breadfruit, pandanus, and coconut palms. The limited terrestrial fauna includes feral pigs, rats, and small lizards.  There are several species of freshwater fish inhabiting the small streams on the islands, and the fringing coral reefs around the islands contain a dazzling array of fish and other salt-water-dwelling species.\nAdministration\nThe archipelago comprises an administrative division () of French Polynesia. The capital of the Leeward Islands administrative subdivision is Uturoa. The Leeward Islands () are one of French Polynesia's five administrative subdivisions. The administrative subdivision is coextensive with the electoral district of the Leeward Islands, one of French Polynesia's six electoral districts for the Assembly of French Polynesia.\nUturoa, Tumaraa, and Taputapuatea communes are all on Raiatea island.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable static-row-numbers sort-under col1right\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Islands and communes of the Leeward Islands of French Polynesia\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Commune\n! scope=\"col\" | Land area (km2)\n! scope=\"col\" | Population (2017 census)\n! scope=\"col\" | Population (2022 census)\n! scope=\"col\" | Density (per km2)\n! scope=\"col\" | Notes\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Maupiti\n| 21.7\n| 1,286\n| 1,302\n| 59.9\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | Primarily the island of Maupiti, but includes 3 atolls to the west of Maupiti (Maupihaa, Manuae and Motu One).\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Bora Bora\n| 41.55\n| 10,549\n| 10,758\n| 258.9\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | Consists of the 3 associated communes of Nunue, Faanui and Anau; includes Tupai Atoll () to the north with no permanent inhabitants\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Tahaʻa\n| 90.2\n| 5,234\n| 5,296\n| 58.7\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | Consists of the 8 associated communes of Faʻaʻaha, Haʻamene, Hipu, Iripau, Niua, Ruutia, Tapuamu and Vaitoare.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Uturoa\n| 16.0\n| 3,778\n| 3,663\n| 229.5\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | Administrative centre of the Leeward Islands; town is situated at the northern tip of Raiatea Island.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Tumaraa\n| 71.9\n| 3,721\n| 3,718\n| 51.7\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | Consists of the 4 associated communes of Fetuna, Tevaitoa (the location of the commune administration), Tehurui and Vaiaʻau, forming the west side of Raiatea Island.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Taputapuatea\n| 84.4\n| 4,792\n| 5,007\n| 59.3\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | Consists of the 3 associated communes of Avera (the location of the commune administration), Opoa and Puohine, forming the east side of Raiatea Island.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Huahine\n| 74.8\n| 6,075\n| 6,258\n| 83.7\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | Consists of the 8 associated communes of Fare (the location of the commune administration), Faie, Fitii and Maeva, all on Huahine Nui; and Haʻapū, Maroe, Parea and Tefarerii on Huahine Iti.\n|-\n!

Unlike in metropolitan France and its overseas regions, it is not mandatory for the communes in French Polynesia to join an intercommunal council. The three intercommunal councils in existence  (including the CCH), all formed on a voluntary basis.\nTourism\nTourism is the mainstay of the economy. Agriculturally, the major products are copra, sugar, rum, mother-of-pearl, and vanilla.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
