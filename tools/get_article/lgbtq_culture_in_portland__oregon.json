The bar was part of an Austin, Texas-based chain of nightclubs. Andrew Jankowski of Willamette Week described Barbarella as \"a dance club with dirt-cheap drinks, themed parties running from the '50s through the '80s and an overall vibe best described as 'a straight person's idea of a gay bar'\".  He compared the bar to neighboring amusement arcade Ground Kontrol, but without the video games, and said, \"Barbarella's aesthetic is as delightfully kitschy and low-budget as a bar named after a campy sci-fi cult classic should be.\" Jankowski wrote:On paper, Barbarella should be a sensation, particularly with central eastsiders who rarely deign to cross the river into the Old Town entertainment district. Sure, the lack of specialty drinks feels like a missed opportunity, and even the bartender recommended against ordering food. But with no cover charge and wells at or below $2 each, you'd imagine the place would be packed with people headed to or from the arcade bar, the gay strip club or the scores of other party spots in the neighborhood.Daily Xtra described Barbarella as a \"video/dance dive bar\" with dance parties, disc jockeys, and queer events in its 2019 overview of \"gay Portland\". The venue had two dance floors and a loft. The interior featured lava lamps, pinball machines, and mid-century modern furniture. There was a painting of a topless woman on one wall, as well as two \"tributes\" to Jane Fonda, who starred in the 1968 science fiction film Barbarella. According to Jankowski, \"The only 21st-century features are the video projections and gently rippling rainbow LED lights behind the pre-existing sheet-metal grates.\"\nBarbarella opened on February 14 (Valentine's Day), 2019, and closed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The venue had hosted Mac DeMarco.\nDrag\nIn addition to Darcelle XV, drag performers from Portland include Alexis Campbell Starr, Asia Consent, Bolivia Carmichaels, Carla Rossi, Coco Jem Holiday, Flawless Shade, Isaiah Esquire, James Majesty, Lulu Luscious, Mars, Nicole Onoscopi, Pepper Pepper, and Poison Waters.\nOrganizations\n, 2014]]\noutside Starky's in 2009]]\nLGBT rights organization Basic Rights Oregon is based in Portland.
