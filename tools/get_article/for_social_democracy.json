In the 2005 legislative elections the party won 15 out of 165 seats in the National Assembly.\nHistory\nThe party is led by Ismael García and Didalco Bolívar. It once supported president Hugo Chávez, but refused to join the new United Socialist Party (PSUV) created by the president in 2007, and opposed Chávez's proposals in the 2007 constitutional referendum. Since then, it broke with Chávez and became the only opposition voice in the Parliament. Hugo Chávez accused García of \"raising the flags of the right.\"[http://www.aporrea.org/actualidad/n91476.html Presidente Chávez: dirigentes vacilantes deben explicar al pueblo razones para no adherirse al PSUV]\nPODEMOS is a member of COPPPAL, and used to be a consultative member of Socialist International.\nIn 2012, the party split and the anti-Chávez faction supporting Ismael García joined the anti-Chávez faction of Fatherland for All, creating Progressive Advance, a centre-left party in opposition to the government. The leadership of PODEMOS was then taken by the pro-Chávez Didalco Bolívar. Under Bolívar's leadership, the party left the Democratic Unity Roundtable and joined the PSUV-led Great Patriotic Pole.\nThe party's youth wing is called the Unión de Jovenes Podemos.\nNotes"
