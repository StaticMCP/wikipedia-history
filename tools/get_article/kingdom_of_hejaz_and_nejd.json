It was the fourth iteration of the Third Saudi State.\nIn 1932, the two kingdoms were unified as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\nHistory\nOn 8 January 1926, Abdulaziz (Ibn Saud), the Sultan of Nejd, was crowned King of the Hejaz in the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, and he elevated Nejd to the status of a kingdom on 29 January 1927. At the Treaty of Jeddah on 20 May 1927, Abdulaziz's realm was recognised by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and was addressed as the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd.\nFor the next five years, Abdulaziz administered the two parts of his dual kingdom as separate units. On 23 September 1932, Abdulaziz proclaimed the union of the main Saudi dominions of al-Hasa, Qatif, Nejd and the Hejaz as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\nForeign policy\nThe Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd could pursue its expansionist policy with British arms supplies because of its close relations with the United Kingdom. Under King Abdulaziz, the Hejaz withdrew from the League of Nations.\nIn 1926, the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd was recognised by the Soviet Union, followed by the United States of America in 1931. By 1932, the United Kingdom, the French Third Republic, the Soviet Union, Turkey, the Imperial State of Iran, Kingdom of Italy and The Netherlands maintained legations in Jeddah; the Kingdom of Egypt maintained unofficial consular representatives.\nSee also\n* History of Saudi Arabia\n* Unification of Saudi Arabia\n* Sheikhdom of Diriyah\n* First Saudi state\n* Second Saudi state\n* Third Saudi State\n* Emirate of Riyadh\n* Sultanate of Nejd\n* Emirate of Nejd and Hasa\n* Saudi Founding Day\nNotes\nSources\n* [http://www.statoids.com/usa.html Statoids - Regions of Saudi Arabia]\n* [http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Saudi_Arabia.htm World Statesmen - Saudi Arabia]\nExternal links"
