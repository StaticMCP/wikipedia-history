The first visit by an incumbent president to the island of Ireland was made in June 1963 by John F. Kennedy when he visited Ireland. To date, 43 visits have been made to the United Kingdom and 12 to Ireland.\nThe United States is bound together with both the island of Ireland and the island of Great Britain by shared history, an overlap in religion and a common language and legal system, plus kinship ties that reach back hundreds of years, including kindred, ancestral lines among Cornish Americans, English Americans, Manx Americans, Irish Americans, Scotch-Irish Americans, Scottish Americans, Welsh Americans, and American Britons respectively.\nTable of visits\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!President\n!Dates\n!Country\n!Locations\n!Key events\n|-\n|Woodrow Wilson\n|\n|nowrap rowspan=5|\n|London,Carlisle,Manchester\n|Met with King George V and Prime Minister David Lloyd George.\n|-\n|Harry S.
