Möbius is credited with the first clinical description of Moebius syndrome in 1888, documented in his report titled Über angeborene doppelseitige Abducens-Facialis-Lähmung. The syndrome is characterized by congenital facial paralysis resulting from underdevelopment of the sixth and seventh cranial nerves.\nMSAD helps increase public awareness of this rare neurological condition and promote social inclusion for individuals living with it. Since its birth, the movement has gained international recognition and support from medical, academic, and public institutions around the world.\nHistory and Development\nThe concept for a worldwide Moebius Syndrome Awareness Day was conceived by the international volunteer organization Many Faces of Moebius Syndrome (MFOMS). The first MSAD was held on January 24, 2011. Moebius Syndrome Awareness Day was first mentioned on the Australian talk show Mornings with Kerri-Anne in a segment titled \"The Boy Who Can’t Smile,\" which featured Jack Lawrance and his mother Linda discussing the newly announced awareness day.The story was then shared by MSNBC.\nMoebius Syndrome Awareness Day was first introduced into the United States headlines in early 2011 with an article published in The Free Lance–Star newspaper about public support and advocacy created for MSAD. A follow-up article published in 2012 documented national awareness efforts connected to MSAD. In 2014, the Moebius Syndrome Foundation Newsletter highlighted joint efforts between the Many Faces of Moebius Syndrome, the Moebius Syndrome Foundation, and the Moebius Research Trust to widen public awareness.\nCreating educational outreach is a continuing emphasis for MSAD, supported by initiatives like Oregon State University’s \"Moebius Syndrome Awareness Project,\" which encouraged classroom participation and discussion. Wearing purple for MSAD on January 24 has become a recognizable symbol of participation.\nPublished reports between 2020 and 2025 describe Moebius Syndrome Awareness Day as an annual international awareness day supported by medical, academic, and advocacy organizations. Psychology Today said it was an example of a rare-disease awareness initiative advancing inclusion and education.\nReporting in later years included coverage by the Fauquier Times, The Zebra Press, and Patient Worthy, which profiled organizers and participants highlighting unity and inclusion. Larger news publications like The New York Times have reported on people living with Moebius syndrome. The AAC technology firm PRC-Saltillo has recognized Moebius Syndrome Awareness Day within its accessibility initiatives.\nGlobal recognition\nMoebius Syndrome Awareness Day is now recognized around the world by families, health institutions, and advocacy groups through community events, social-media campaigns, and educational activities. Nonprofits such as the Moebius Syndrome Foundation identify it as an annual day of education and inclusion held every year. Face Equality International and other groups have united to promote greater understanding of the visible differences associated with Moebius syndrome.\nAcademic and health care organizations have cited Moebius Syndrome Awareness Day in educational materials. Salus University Health lists January 24 as an established awareness date. The Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT) in Canada included MSAD in its 2024 “Beyond the Surface” inclusion campaign, and the United Kingdom-based charity Ataxia & Me recognized it as an international health-awareness effort.\nAwareness listings and media outlets — including Ability Superstore, AnydayGuide, and FOX21 News (Colorado Springs) — recognize Moebius Syndrome Awareness Day as a global awareness day highlighting moebius syndrome and community advocacy.\nMoebius Syndrome Awareness Day is internationally recognized and supported by universities, health organizations, and local governments. Each year, people around the world engage in educational and community events on January 24. MSAD works to build a more inclusive world by raising awareness about Moebius syndrome.\nSee also\n* Moebius syndrome\n* Rare Disease Day\n* Facial paralysis\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.mfoms.org Many Faces of Moebius Syndrome]\n* [https://ccakids.org Children’s Craniofacial Association (CCA Kids)]\n* [https://moebiussyndrome.org Moebius Syndrome Foundation]\n:Category:Health awareness days\n:Category:January observances\n:Category:Neurology\n:Category:Disability observances"
