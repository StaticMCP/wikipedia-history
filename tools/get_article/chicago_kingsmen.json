It was formed in 2020 as part of 24 original teams to compete in Minor League Cricket. The franchise was owned by Iftekhar Shareef until the team's acquisition by Fawad Sarwar of the Kingsmen Global Sports Group. The franchise is currently run by Salman Abbasi and Mohammad Iqra Farooqui, with Khurram Syed also associated.\nThe team's planned home ground is Kingsmen Stadium, located in Illinois. Pakistan international Fawad Alam helms captaincy duties, while former Pakistani cricketer Saad Ali stands by as vice-captain.\nFranchise history\nBackground\nTalks of an American Twenty20 league started in November 2018 just before USA Cricket became the new governing body of cricket in the United States. In May 2021, USA Cricket announced they had accepted a bid by American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) for a US$1 billion investment covering the league and other investments benefitting the U.S. national teams.\nIn an Annual General Meeting on February 21, 2020, it was announced that USA Cricket was planning to launch Major League Cricket in 2021 and Minor League Cricket that summer, but it was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and due to the lack of high-quality cricket stadiums in the USA. Major League Cricket was pushed to a summer-2023 launch and Minor League Cricket was pushed back to July 31, 2021.\nUSA Cricket CEO Iain Higgins also pointed out cities such as New York City, Houston and Los Angeles with a large cricket fanbase, and targeted them among others as launch cities for Minor League Cricket.\nExhibition league\nIn July 2020, the player registration for the Minor League Cricket exhibition league began. On August 15, 2020, USA Cricket announced the teams participating in the exhibition league matches, also listing the owners for each team. The draft for the exhibition league began on August 22, 2020, with the Chicago Blasters releasing their squad on September 12. Ibrahim Khaleel was later named as captain for the Blasters, with Fahad Babar down for vice-captaincy duties for the exhibition league.\n2021 season\nAfter the conclusion of the exhibition league, USA Cricket announced that they were planning to launch the inaugural season of Minor League Cricket in spring 2021. Ahead of the official season, which was announced to kick off on July 31, the Blasters announced Fahad Babar as captain with Abul Hasan helming vice-captain duties.\nThroughout the group stage, the Blasters won against the Athletics once, the Catchers twice, and the Americans once. However, the Blasters lost once against the Strikers, the Grizzlies and the Americans, while losing twice to the Mustangs, the Hurricanes, and the Stars. The Blasters finished 6th in their group, thus not advancing to the play-offs.\n2022 season\nAhead of the 2022 season, Major League Cricket announced that the draft for that season would take place on May 12. Ahead of the official season, it was announced that the captaincy role would be shifted from Khaleel to local Blasters cricketer Ashhar Medhi, with Babar once again given vice-captaincy duties.\nThroughout the season, the Blasters lost to the Tigers, Hurricanes, and the Stars twice, and lost to the Blazers, the Blasters, the Grizzlies, the Mustangs, and the Americans once. The Blasters finished last in their group, despite three of their games being washed out.\nCurrent squad\n* Players with international caps are listed in bold.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Nationality\n!Birth date\n!Batting style\n!Bowling style\n!Year signed\n!Notes\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | Batsmen\n|-\n|| Awais Zia ||  || || Left-handed || Right-arm off break || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2022 || Overseas\n|-\n|-\n|| Homayoon Ahmadzai || |||| Right-handed || Right-arm off break|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2021 ||\n|-\n|| Shreyas Ramesh || |||| Right-handed || Right-arm medium|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2022 ||\n|-\n|| Jay Patel || |||| Right-handed || Right-arm medium fast|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2022 ||\n|-\n|| Najam Iqbal || |||| Left-handed || Right-arm off break|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2021 ||\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | All-rounders\n|-\n|| Abul Hasan ||  || || Left-handed || Right-arm medium fast || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2021 || Overseas\n|-\n|| Mohit Patel || || || Right-handed ||Right-arm medium fast || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2022 ||\n|-\n|| Abdullah Quadri || |||| Right-handed || Left-arm fast medium || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2022 ||\n|-\n|| Pankaj Kampli || |||| Right-handed || Right-arm leg break googly || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2022 ||\n|-\n|| Chiranjeevi Akunuri || |||| Right-handed || Right-arm medium || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2022 ||\n|-\n|| Fahad Babar || |||| Right-handed || Right-arm off break || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2021 || Vice-captain\n|-\n|| Ankush Agrawal || |||| Right-handed || Right-arm fast || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2022 ||\n|-\n|| Datta Prakash Yadavalli ||  || || Left-handed || Left-arm off break || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2021 ||\n|-\n|| Abir Chippa || |||| Right-handed || Left-arm off break || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2022 ||\n|-\n|| Arjun Reddy || |||| Right-handed || Right-arm fast || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2022 ||\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |Bowlers\n|-\n|| Mohammad Mohsin ||  || || Right-handed || Right-arm off break || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2025||\n|-\n|| Umair Mir ||  || || Left-handed || Right-arm medium fast || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2022 ||\n|-\n|| Zia-ul-Haq ||  || || Right-handed || Left-arm fast medium || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2022 ||\n|-\n|| Kevin Philip ||  || || Right-handed || Right-arm leg spin || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2022 ||\n|-\n|| Sai Daggupati ||  || || Right-handed || Right-arm leg spin || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2022 ||\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | Wicket-keepers\n|-\n|| Aayush Thakkar ||  || || Right-handed || Right-arm medium fast || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2022 ||\n|-\n|| Shaheer Hassan || |||| Right-handed || Right-arm fast medium || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2021 ||\n|-\n|| Ashhar Mehdi || |||| Right-handed || Right-arm off break || style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2021 || Captain\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
