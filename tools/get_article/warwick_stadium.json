The stadium also holds gym and fitness facilities.\nThe stadium is the home of the Warwick Senators in the NBL1 West.\nHistory\nIn 1992, the Warwick Leisure Centre was built in the Perth suburb of Warwick. In 2015, the venue received an $8 million expansion, with the Churches of Christ Sport & Recreation Association (CCSRA) investing over $5.5 million and the City of Joondalup committing $2.3 million. The expansion included four new indoor courts to bring the total to eight. The venue was subsequently renamed Warwick Stadium. The renovations were completed in time for the start of the 2016 State Basketball League season.\nIn January 2025, the WA Labor government committed $16 million for a new high performance venue at Warwick Stadium. The planned expansion includes three new courts and gym facilities to cater for elite operations of Perth's national basketball teams, the Perth Wildcats and Perth Lynx, with both clubs pledging to move their bases from the WA Basketball Centre to Warwick Stadium. Bipartisan support was confirmed the following month, with the WA Liberal Party matching the $16 million pledge.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://warwickstadium.com.au/ Warwick Stadium website]"
