Palestinians have expressed concerns over increased anti-Palestinianism in mass media and anti-Palestinian hate crimes. Human rights groups have noted an increase in anti-Palestinian hate speech and incitement to violence against Palestinians.\nAfrica\nSouth Africa\nIn June 2024, a 44-year-old man named Grayson Beare, who described himself as a former Zionist, murdered a 46-year-old woman named Halima Hoosen-Preston and critically injured her husband and her 14-year-old in Durban, South Africa. Middle East Monitor reported that the victim's 10-year-old daughter, who also survived the attack, said his motive was due to the family's support for Palestine. The assault “allegedly occurred after an altercation Beare had with Hoosen-Preston during which she laughed upon hearing that his cousins had been killed in Israel.” However, Beare's family stated that his act was purely criminal. Beare was later admitted to a psychiatric hospital for a mental evaluation.\nAsia\nBahrain\nIn October 2023, a doctor of Indian descent in Bahrain was fired from the Royal Bahrain Hospital for anti-Palestinian tweets that were deemed \"offensive to our society\" by the hospital.\nIndia\nA large amount of anti-Palestinian, Islamophobic, pro-Israeli propaganda and disinformation has emerged from India during the war, especially among Hindu nationalists. Anti-Palestinian disinformation from India often comes from supporters of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nEurope\nBelgium\nOn 11 December 2023, The Brussels Times reported that Belgium's Foreigners' Office had instructed municipalities to remove citizenship from Belgian children with Palestinian parents, though a spokesperson for the Secretary of State for Asylum and Migration denied this action was related to the ongoing war.\nFrance\nThe interior minister of France ordered local authorities to ban all pro-Palestinian protests. French journalist Alain Gresh has said that Emmanuel Macron's Renaissance party has a \"very strong anti-Palestinian position\".\nOn 14 October, French-Algerian journalist  was arrested while covering a pro-Palestine protest in Paris. He told +972 Magazine that people were getting \"strangled by the police\", and that the police fined him for participating in an \"illegal demonstration\" despite showing his press card. He also claimed that the police threatened to break his legs if they saw him again at a protest.\nGermany\nGermany banned the display of a number of Palestinian symbols such as the Palestinian flag and the keffiyeh, including at schools. Palestinians in Germany described facing repression from authorities when they attempted to protest in support of Palestine, being subject to crackdowns, arrests and possible racial profiling. On 18 October 2023, a video of German police stomping out a candlelight vigil for dead Palestinians was seen circulating on social media. Pro-Palestinian protesters in Neukölln were faced with displays of excessive force, including the use of pepper spray and water cannons. Hanno Hauenstein of The Nation described \"a climate of fear\" in the country created by the Israel–Hamas war, exacerbated by \"hard-line\" actions from the government. One Palestinian human rights advocate called Germany's response to these protests as \"McCarthyism in the purest sense\", and a protester told Al Jazeera English that she was unsure \"whether we actually have freedom of speech in Germany [regarding Palestine]\".\nIn response to these restrictions, human rights organizations urged authorities to ensure and enable the right of all individuals to express their opinions and peacefully assemble. Germany also faced criticism from Muslim countries such as Indonesia, who argued that they were preventing peaceful protesters from publicly showing support for Palestinians.\nOn 10 October 2023, a teacher hit a student in Berlin for waving the Palestinian flag.\nOn 13 October 2023, LitProm abruptly cancelled a LiBeraturpreis for Palestinian author Adania Shibli for her book Minor Detail, a novel partly based on the true story of a rape and murder of a Palestinian girl in 1949 by Israeli soldiers; it was originally set to be given at the Frankfurt Book Fair on 20 October. Following this, more than 1,000 authors and publishers – including Colm Tóibín, Hisham Matar, Kamila Shamsie and William Dalrymple, as well as Nobel prize winners Abdulrazak Gurnah, Annie Ernaux and Olga Tokarczuk – signed an open letter criticizing this decision, saying that the Book Fair had \"a responsibility to be creating spaces for Palestinian writers to share their thoughts, feelings, reflections on literature through these terrible, cruel times, not shutting them down\".\nOn 13 November 2023, an Afrofuturism exhibition by curator Anaïs Duplan was suspended by Museum Folkwang after they expressed support for Palestine and \"personally tak[ing] sides with the BDS campaign\" on Instagram. The next day, Indian poet Ranjit Hoskote resigned from his position at the curator-finding committee of Documenta, after the exhibition publicly criticized him for signing a BDS India letter in 2019, calling it \"explicitly anti-Semitic\". The letter in question had denounced a \"Zionism and Hindutva\" event hosted by the  and co-organized by the Indo-Israel Friendship Association; the letter also called Israel an \"apartheid state\" engaging in \"settler colonialism\". Over the following two days, the entire committee resigned, citing the social climate created by the Israel–Hamas war in an open letter, and Documenta's \"unchallenged media and public discrediting\" of Hoskote in particular.\nMasha Gessen (a Jewish, Russian-American journalist who lost family members in the Holocaust) wrote an essay on 9 December 2023, arguing that Germany's remembrance culture regarding the Holocaust was being used as a \"cynically wielded political instrument\" by the AfD to target Muslim immigrants. Gessen condemned the atrocities committed by Hamas on 7 October, but was also critical of the Israeli bombings of the Gaza Strip, which they considered to be highly destructive and comparable to an Eastern European ghetto \"being liquidated\" by the Nazis. Following this, the Heinrich Böll Foundation announced that they were withdrawing their support for Gessen winning the Hannah Arendt Prize, rejecting the comparison of Gaza to a Jewish ghetto as \"unacceptable\".\nIn February 2024, Palestinian Basel Adra and Israelian Yuval Abraham, film directors awarded at the 74th Berlin International Film Festival for their documentary No Other Land, were defamed by a German minister.\nIn March 2024, amid the Israel–Gaza war, Germany's Social Democratic Party and Christian Democratic Union Party issued a directive for the distribution of leaflets in high schools in Neukölln that dismissed the historical realities of the Nakba as \"myth\".\nNancy Fraser, a Jewish American philosopher, was appointed visiting professor at the Albertus-Magnus-Chair of the University of Cologne to deliver lectures about \"Three Faces of Capitalist Labor: Uncovering the Hidden Ties among Gender, Race, and Class\" in May 2024.

Fraser called the decision to disinvite her \"philosemitic McCarthyism\".\nA Palestine Congress conference, scheduled on the weekend of 13–14 April 2024 at Berlin and organized by various Palestinian support groups along with the Germany Branch of European Jews for a Just Peace was prohibited. Ghassan Abu Sittah, incumbent Rector of the University of Glasgow, and Yanis Varoufakis, former finance minister of Greece, were denied entry into Germany and banned from speaking at the conference. Varoufakis commented on this: \"It is clear that Germany's Staatsräson is not about protecting Jews. It is about protecting the right of Israel to commit any war crime of its choice.\" The International Centre of Justice for Palestinians challenged and succeeded in overturning the ban imposed by German authorities on  Abu Sittah.\nOn 23 August 2024, in his report \"Global threats to freedom of expression arising from the conflict in Gaza\" (A/79/319), the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression expressed concerns over scope and gravity against protests in Germany:\nIn Germany, the response was among the toughest, imposing a blanket ban on all demonstrations in support of Palestinian people from 7 to 21 October 2023, and pre-emptively banning several such gatherings.\nOn 29 November 2024, a conference scheduled in Berlin with French historian Vincent Lemire, specialized in the history of Jerusalem, was cancelled. Lemire had come to present the German version of his comic strip \"History of Jerusalem\" in the Urania center. Reproaching him for defending positions that are too critical of the Israeli government, former German deputy Volker Beck refused to discuss with the historian and the Urania center canceled the event at short notice. Lemire's comment on this: \"Beck was not officially included in the event, dedicated to my comic strip. He used his false cancellation as an excuse to have the meeting cancelled.\"\nFollowing pressure from politicians, public lectures by United Nations Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories Francesca Albanese and Israeli architect Eyal Weizman planned at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich on 12 February 2025 and Free University of Berlin on 19 February 2025 were cancelled.

But his participation was cancelled due to pressure from the Israeli Embassy in Germany. What Boehm wanted to say in his speech is, that the phrase never again is associated to the Lessons of the Holocaust and to all genocides as well. In this view, Boehm argues, never again applies to the \"Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October 2023\" and \"the destruction and starvation in Gaza\" as well.\nMelanie Schweizer, a German lawyer, stood for election to the Bundestag with the MERA25 party in early 2025 in a Berlin constituency.

According to British journalists Peter Oborne and Imran Mulla, \"Britain has experienced an epidemic of almost unchallenged anti-Palestinian racism and anti-Muslim bigotry\" since the war began. Oborne and Mulla have accused Home Secretary Suella Braverman for being \"inexcusably silent\" on anti-Palestinianism and Islamophobia. Braverman stated on 11 October that waving Palestinian flags in public \"may not be legitimate\". She also described an Armistice Day 2023 protest against the war in Gaza, which was attended by 800,000 people in London, as a \"hate march\" and accused the Metropolitan Police of having a pro-Palestinian bias. According to a YouGov poll in November 2024, British support for the London marches stands at 33%, while those who oppose the marches account for 43%.

Abu Saif and publisher Comma Press, which had organized the event, denied the allegations and said they were libelous. A letter signed by 300 artists and arts professionals, including Phil Collins and Maxine Peake, wrote to HOME to request it allow the event to continue and \"repair its commitment to anti-racism, including anti-Palestinian racism\". After nearly 100 artists withdrew their work from HOME's exhibition space and a protest outside the venue, it reinstated the event.\nIn July 2024, over 750 artists signed an open letter by Artists for Palestine UK, after the Royal Academy of Arts removed a photograph of a Jewish protestor holding a placard in support of Palestine.

The Jewish Socialists' Group, which signed the letter, said the Royal Academy gave \"support to a racist, anti-Palestinian campaign\". In October 2024, over 270 artists signed an open letter by Artists for Palestine alleging the Royal Exchange Theatre had censored pro-Palestinian and pro-trans sentiments when it cancelled Stef O'Driscoll's production of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''.\nMiddle East\nIsrael\nPalestinian students attending the Netanya Academic College in central Israel were trapped in their dorms after a large Israeli crowd gathered in front of the building chanting \"death to Arabs\" and attempted to break into the building.

The allegations had been reviewed and investigated by police who had ruled out the students involvement. Middle East Eye reported that Palestinian students faced suspensions after receiving emails accusing them of \"supporting terrorism\" due to posts condemning the continued attacks of the Israeli military on Gazan citizens.\nAfter October 27 2023, online commenters reacted to an anti-Palestinian racist and Islamophobic compilation video of Israeli influencers' contributions to a new TikTok trend, noting that Palestinians had been irrationally singled out using the Pallywood trope, an example of the ethnicity-based Islamophobia, and that it had a \"revolting\" nature, possibly due to \"[the filmers'] kids [...] learning how to be racist from a very young age\". Makeup was used both to perform the Pallywood trope and to exaggerate inherited attributes, purported and otherwise, as the ready-made explanation for the behavioral trait supposedly identified. The \"users [were] applying black makeup to thicken their eyebrows and blacken their teeth\".\nIn the weeks after the outbreak of the war in early October, thousands of Palestinians have been arrested and detained in Israel and the occupied West Bank. Many of those imprisoned alleged that they were tortured or otherwise mistreated while detained in military prison facilities, while the International Committee of the Red Cross stated they were repeatedly denied access to arrestees, who Israeli officials had classified as \"enemy non-combatants\". On 3 November, Israel reportedly deported 3,200 Palestinian workers into the Gaza Strip, with the UN Human Rights Office expressing their concern over the status of the deportees and indicated they were being sent into an incredible dangerous situation.\nA video posted of young Israeli children drew outrage online after being posted on 19 November 2023, by the Israeli state broadcaster Kan News aired it under the title ''We'll annihilate everyone in Gaza. The video has since been deleted, but showed the children singing an old song written by Israeli poet Haim Gouri after the 1948 war, that had been amended to reference Gaza. While some debate has been raised about the translation of some of the words, some of the Google translated lyrics have been posted as, In another year there will be nothing left, And we will return safely to our home within a year, We will eliminate them all, And then return to plowing our Fields.''\n\"Harbu Darbu\" () was released by musical duo  on 14 November 2023. Ness () and Stilla () stated that they wrote the song to raise the Israeli people's morale, deciding it was \"time to replace the sadness with anger\". \"The song celebrates soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and criticizes celebrities who voice anti-Israel sentiments. It also calls for revenge on everyone who planned, executed, and supported the Hamas-led attack in Israel. The rappers repeatedly use the phrase \"every dog's day will come\" in Arabic. This is directed at Hezbollah and Hamas leaders, along with Western celebrities such as Bella Hadid, Dua Lipa and others who have expressed support for Palestinian people and criticized Israel.\nThere have been ongoing protests in Israel against humanitarian aid being allowed to enter the Gaza Strip which continued after the decision in the South Africa v Israel International court case which indicated humanitarian aid should be allowed in.

Feiglin stated that Israeli's \"can't live in this land if one Islamo-Nazi remains in Gaza\" and continued stating that Jews were \"not guests in our own land, it is entirely ours\" and that he wanted to \"turn Gaza Hebrew\". Feiglin has had a history of similar comments stating in 2019 that international law should not be applied to the situation as there is no Palestinian nation.
