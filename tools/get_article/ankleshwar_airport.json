The Gujarat State Aviation Infrastructure Company Limited has acquired 80 hectares of land for the construction of the airport. The Airport Authority signed a memorandum of understanding with the State Government in January 2019 for the construction of airport and a maintenance, repair and overhaul unit spread over 92 hectares. Bharuch-Ankleshwar Airport is expected to handle 10% of India's total air cargo.\nThe airport will serve Ankleshwar, Bharuch, the Jagadia and Panoli Industrial areas, the Dahej SEZ and the upcoming Petroleum Chemical and Petrochemical Investment Region. The Ankleshwar Industries Association had proposed the construction of the airport to the State Government in 1995. The Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation had agreed to construct the airstrip and terminal, but the project was eventually referred to the Gujarat Industrial Development Board.\nThe foundation stone for the new airport was laid on 10 October 2022 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nReferences"
