The original Northampton to London road (modern B526) runs nearby. The route was diverted in 1728 along a new road on the higher ground east of the village, causing the latter to decline.\nCaldecote was recorded in the Domesday Book as Caldecote.\nThe place name was once used elsewhere in Buckinghamshire in the ancient village adjacent to Bedgrove.\nLocation\nThe modern area is the triangle defined by the M1 motorway, the A422 road and the A509 road.  It is mostly farmland and designated as urban open space since it is substantially within the flood plain of the River Ouzel (or Lovat).\nSee also\nThere is also another ancient village (and now a modern development and balancing lake) in nearby Walton (civil parish), with the very similar name of Caldecotte.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
