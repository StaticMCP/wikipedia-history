From 1720 to 1945, it was part of the Prussian Province of Pomerania, from 1945 to 1952 of the State of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, from 1952 to 1990 of the Bezirk Neubrandenburg of East Germany and since 1990 again of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.\nPrehistory\nThe first traces of settlements in the area were recorded in the Middle Stone Age (3000–1000 BC), identified through stones and animal bones with signs of use. The inhabitants were primarily gatherers, hunters, and fishermen. In the Late Stone Age (3000–1600 BC), livestock farming was mainly carried out in the forest areas.\nSlavic period\nAround 375 AD, the invasion of the Huns in Europe initiated a migration. Consequently, by about 450 AD, the deserted areas of Slavic tribes, Pomerania and Liutizen, were settled without conflict. The name \"Warsin\" is derived from the Slavic \"war,\" meaning tar or pitch, referring to local tar-smoldering sites. The name \"Uecker\" originates from the Slavic preposition \"u,\" meaning \"near,\" and \"Krai,\" meaning \"border\" or \"edge,\" possibly referencing their western neighbors, the Obotrites. The Polish Duke Boleslaw III ended the Liutic rule in the winter of 1120–1121 by advancing to the Müritz.\nEarly German period (from 1200)\nDuring this period, with the \"German Eastern Colonization,\" German settlers arrived, predominantly from Brandenburg. Local officials of German and Slavic origin were tasked with founding villages, mostly in the vicinity of existing Slavic settlements. This also applied to Luckow and Vogelsang. The 7th–12th centuries are considered the Wendish or Slavic period of Vogelsang-Warsin. By the end of the 14th century, half of Vogelsang was awarded to the Bröckern family. In the mid-15th century, the Stettin banking house collapsed, which negatively impacted Vogelsang's economy. In 1575, the Muckerwitz family died out, leading to the loss of half of the Vogelsang estate in Ueckermünde.\nThirty Years' War\nVogelsang-Warsin was initially spared during the Thirty Years' War. However, in 1627, neutral Pomerania was occupied by Wallenstein's soldiers, who thoroughly plundered the area before leaving. Although the war affected the area for only 10 years, almost all houses were destroyed.\nPre-War period\nThe castle in Vogelsang was constructed in the mid-19th century. Additionally, two brickworks were built, and a temporary school was established in Warsin.\nWorld Wars I and II\nFollowing World War I and Germany's defeat, the dissolution of Germany's estate districts occurred, leading to Vogelsang and Warsin forming a single municipality named Vogelsang. With the onset of the Great Depression in 1929 and Hitler's rise to power in 1933, the brickworks in Vogelsang were compelled to operate under high pressure for Germany's rearmament efforts. In 1934, Vogelsang incurred a debt of approximately 51,000 Reichsmarks, resulting in a forced auction. Despite this, the fire brigade was founded in the municipality of Vogelsang.\nIn 1935, the Nazi civil servant training camp opened at Vogelsang Castle. In subsequent years, the municipality was connected to the interregional power grid. On January 17, 1937, Vogelsang Castle partially burned down. By 1938, the South Road to Altwarp and the road between Vogelsang and Warsin were completed, and later, the village road in Vogelsang was paved. During World War II, Vogelsang Castle was converted into a military hospital. On April 27, 1945, the Red Army occupied the area.\nPost-War period\nVogelsang Castle became an orphanage. On October 7, 1949, with the consent of the Soviet occupation authorities, the German Democratic Republic was formed. In 1951, the new school in Vogelsang was inaugurated, later becoming a general ten-grade polytechnic secondary school. In 1960, the brickworks in Vogelsang ceased production. On March 13, 1960, the LPG Type I \"Glück Auf\" agricultural cooperative was established in Vogelsang.\nModern times\nIn 1991, an open-air stage was built on the beach, along with a walking and cycling path between Vogelsang and Warsin. That same year, the last final examination for a 10th-grade class took place in Vogelsang; since then, only grades 1 to 4 have been taught there. The municipal administration relocated from Warsin to Vogelsang. In 1993, the secondary school and the children's home in Vogelsang were dissolved. In 1995, a memorial cross was erected in Warsin to honor fallen soldiers from Vogelsang-Warsin in both World Wars. Shortly thereafter, the school in Vogelsang was dissolved, and students from grades 1 to 4 began attending school in Ahlbeck.\nTourism and recreation\nVogelsang-Warsin offers various attractions for visitors, including a sandy beach and developed bicycle paths through forested areas.\nAttractions\n* Fishing Area: The Szczecin Lagoon and numerous local ponds and lakes provide opportunities for anglers. Managed ponds are regularly stocked with new fish.\n* Sailing Area: The lagoon offers favorable conditions for sailors, with access to deeper waters, the Baltic Sea, and the possibility of sailing into the main lagoon. Local harbors cater to both sailors and small-scale fishermen.\n* Accommodation: Numerous holiday apartments and homes are available for overnight stays.\n* Bathing and Relaxation: A natural, tree-lined beach offers tranquility and child-friendly water depths.\nNature\nThe municipality is situated within the Szczecin Lagoon Nature Park, located in northeastern Germany near the Republic of Poland. The park is characterized by its naturally undeveloped sections of the lagoon coast and lagoon meadows, extensive forest complexes of the Ueckermünde Heath, the Uecker and Randow lowlands, and the Brohmer Mountains. This area appeals to nature enthusiasts and those seeking peace and quiet, even during peak season. From Vogelsang-Warsin, visitors can explore the natural surroundings, with notable destinations including the \"Ukranenland\" in Torgelow (an open-air museum featuring reconstructed Slavic houses and ships) and the Botanical Garden in Christiansberg.\nSport\nVogelsang-Warsin and its surroundings feature many cycle paths that traverse dense forests and follow the lagoon coast. The Altwarper Dunes are a notable destination. Additionally, the area provides opportunities for relaxed walks through the town and surrounding nature.\nReferences"
