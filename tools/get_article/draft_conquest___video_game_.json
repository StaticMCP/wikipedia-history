(video game)\nConquest! is a persistent, cross-platform multiplayer strategy game first released in 1993 as a text-based war game played over Internet Relay Chat (IRC). It is among the earliest known online multiplayer strategy games designed for real-time play in IRC channels, predating mainstream graphical MMORPGs. Over the years, it has evolved into a standalone game with a 2D user interface.\nDrawing inspiration from tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons, early online experiences such as MUDs, and traditional war games, Conquest! features turn-based territorial control, unit training, and asynchronous player-versus-player combat set in a persistent fantasy world.\nDevelopment\nConquest! was originally developed by James D. Bennett and John Leth-Nissen while in high school. The game began as a shell-scripted bot running on IRC in 1993, allowing players to join, form factions, and compete for control of regions in real time. In response to growing interest and technical limitations, it was rewritten in C to improve performance and maintainability. Later, the client was ported to Unity to support graphical interaction and modern cross-platform deployment.\nA 2016 [https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4s5s15/iama_developer_of_a_23yearold_game_that_started/ Reddit AMA] with one of the original developers provided insights into the game’s early design and IRC-era popularity. The game was also briefly listed in an early version of Wikipedia’s \"Conquest\" disambiguation page in 2004, captured in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20040428070716/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest Wayback Machine].\nReception\nConquest! has remained a niche game with a small but active community. Reviews on digital storefronts have highlighted the depth of its strategy mechanics and faction customization, while also noting a lack of onboarding and documentation for new players.\nLegacy\nAs a multiplayer strategy game played over IRC in the early 1990s, Conquest! represents one of the earliest attempts to bring persistent world mechanics and faction-based conflict to an online environment. Its IRC-based design paralleled the rise of MUDs and foreshadowed many features of modern online strategy and MMO games.\nExternal links\n* [https://www.conquestgamesite.com Official website]\nReferences\n:Category:1993 video games\n:Category:Multiplayer video games\n:Category:Real-time strategy video games\n:Category:Video games developed in the United States\n:Category:Windows games\n:Category:MacOS games\n:Category:Android (operating system) games\n:Category:IOS games\n:Category:Universal Windows Platform apps\n:Category:Indie games"
