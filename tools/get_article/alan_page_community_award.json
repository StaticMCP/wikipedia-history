      "text": "# Alan Page Community Award\n\nThe Alan Page Community Award has been awarded by the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) continuously since 1967. Previously named the Byron \"Whizzer\" White NFL Man of the Year Award, after Byron \"Whizzer\" White, the award was renamed in the fall of 2018 in honor of Alan Page. Alan Page has been a stalwart for the players union since his early days as an executive committee member as well as a pioneer for social justice during his distinguished 23-year tenure on the Minnesota Supreme Court.\nThe award annually recognizes one player who goes above and beyond to perform community service in his hometown and team city. Past winners have included Drew Brees, Warrick Dunn, Gale Sayers, Bart Starr, Archie Manning, Peyton Manning and Ken Houston.\nThe 2001 recipient, Michael McCrary, was the child in the Supreme Court case Runyon v. McCrary (1976) in which Justice White had participated nearly a quarter of a century before McCrary's award.  White had dissented from the position taken by the lawyers for McCrary.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Season\n! Player\n! Position\n!
