Christobel's body was found by neighbours who were investigating why the couple's cows hadn't been milked.\nAn intensive and high-profile homicide investigation using ground-breaking forensic science led to neighbour William Alfred Bayly being convicted and hanged for the crime.\nBayly had been farming in Ruawaro since November 1928. To some locals, he was a \"handsome dare-devil fellow\" with a \"magnetic\" personality. To others, he was a scary and arrogant man who rode around the area on his horse.\nSamuel Lakey had purchased the neighbouring property from Bayly's father, who he had worked for as a carpenter. Relations were initially friendly, but soured when Christobel Lakey was said to have accused Bayly of having murdered his niece.\nSamuel Lakey's remains were finally reunited with this wife's remains at Huntly Cemetery at a ceremony in 2015, attended by the granddaughter of one of the neighbours.\nTopp Twins\nThe Topp Twins were raised on a local dairy farm and attended Ruawaro Combined School during the 1960s and early 1970s. They left home and moved to Christchurch in 1975, at the age of 17. Staff and students at the school compiled memorabilia from their time at the school when they returned during the 1990s.\nThe Topp Twins: Untouchable Girls, a 2009 documentary feature film about the sisters directed by Leanne Pooley, covers their often difficult childhood in the deeply conservative rural community. The film screened at film festivals around the world, and won awards at the Toronto International Film Festival, Melbourne International Film Festival, Göteborg International Film Festival, Portland International Film Festival and the 2009 New Zealand Film and Television Awards.\nEducation\nRuawaro Combined School is a co-educational state primary school, with a roll of  as of .\nReferences"
