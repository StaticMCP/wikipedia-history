To be freed from the demon's reign of terror, the villagers prayed to Lord Shiva. As a result, Lord Shiva appeared under a Peepal tree and killed the demon, relieving the villagers from their fear. Since then, this place has been known as Haldeshwar Mahadev.\nThere is also a hill at this location where Guru Gorakhnath's cave and Dhuni (sacred fire) are found. Guru Gorakhnath meditated here for many years. Additionally, during the Mahabharata period, the Pandavas spent their period of exile (Agyatvas) here. Nearby, on a high hill, there is a temple dedicated to Maa Bhawani, though reaching it is quite difficult.\nThe Chhappan hills at the foot of Piploon village in Siwana are in their full glory in the month of Saavan. The rains bring laughter to their lives. The pilgrimage place Haldeshwar Mahadev is situated amidst these hills. This is the end of the Aravali mountain range.\nThe faith of the devotees overflows in Haldeshwar Dham in the month of Saavan. It is not easy to reach here. Devotees and tourists have to cross seven hills to reach the Dham. The hilly path is difficult and confusing. Faith in Lord Bhole paves an easy path for the one who comes here. It is believed that the wishes of the devotees coming here are fulfilled. Devotees come for darshan from every corner of the country.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.bhaskar.com/amp/local/rajasthan/barmer/balotra/news/pleased-with-the-penance-of-krishnas-brother-haldhar-balarama-mahadev-himself-revealed-the-jyotirling-haldeshwar-129452994 Pleased with the penance of Lord Krishna's brother Haldhar and Balram, Mahadev himself revealed the Jyotirlinga Haldeshwar]"
