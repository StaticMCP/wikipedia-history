In real-world security environments, the proportion of malicious samples is very small compared to benign, ranging from 0.01% to 2% of observed data. This imbalance may cause traditional classifiers to become biased towards the majority (benign) class, achieving high overall accuracy but failing to correctly identify malicious samples.\nProblem\nTraditional machine learning models trained on imbalanced datasets tend to exhibit bias towards the majority class, resulting in poor precision and recall for malware detection.\nApproaches\nPrior to transformer-based solutions, several methods have been examined to address class imbalance in software samples. These methods include sequence-based long short-term memory (LSTM) models, as well as statistical approaches such as n-gram language models. These approaches work well when the dataset is balanced, but their performance quickly drops when malware samples were proportioned realistically.\nBERT-Based Solution\nRecent research has explored the use of BERT (language model), originally developed for natural language processing, to address highly imbalanced datasets in malware detection. By treating application activity sequences as natural language data, BERT based methods have reported improved performance. One study found BERT achieved an F1 Score of 0.919 on datasets with only 0.5% malware samples, significantly outperforming traditional approaches.\nThis approach works by:\n* Analyzing sequences of application activities rather than individual features\n* Using BERT's pre-trained language model capabilities\n* Fine-tuning on android activity sequence data\nThis method addresses the fundamental problem of oversampling and undersampling in data analysis specific to cybersecurity, where malicious samples are extremely rare.\nReferences"
