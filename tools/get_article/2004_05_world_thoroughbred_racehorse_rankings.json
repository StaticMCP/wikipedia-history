It is an assessment of racehorses which was issued by the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities (IFHA) in August 2005. It includes horses aged three or older which raced or were trained during 2004–05 in countries where the flat racing year runs from August 1 to July 31 (and also South America, where it runs from July 1 to June 30). These countries are generally in the Southern Hemisphere, although some areas covered, such as Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates, are actually north of the equator.\nThe ratings represent a weight value in pounds, with higher values given to horses which showed greater ability. It is judged that these weights would equalize the abilities of the horses if carried in a theoretical handicap race. The list includes all horses rated 115 or above, and it also shows the surface and the distances at which the rating was achieved.\nThe highest rating in the 2004–05 season was 123, which was given to the performances of both Roses in May in the Dubai World Cup and Silent Witness in the Hong Kong Sprint. In total, 23 horses were included in the list.\nFull rankings for 2004–05\n* Country foaled – Horse names are followed by a suffix indicating the country where foaled.\n* Age – The ages shown for horses foaled in the Southern Hemisphere are as of their universal date of increase, August 1, 2004. The ages of those born in the Northern Hemisphere are taken from their equivalent date, January 1, 2005.\n* Sex – The following abbreviations are used:\n** C – Colt – Ungelded male horse up to four-years-old.\n** F – Filly – Female horse up to four-years-old.\n** H – Horse – Ungelded male horse over four-years-old.\n** M – Mare – Female horse over four-years-old.\n** G – Gelding – Gelded male horse of any age.\n----\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n! width=\"40px\" | Rank\n! width=\"50px\" | Rating\n! width=\"180px\" | Horse\n! width=\"40px\" | Age\n! width=\"40px\" | Sex\n! width=\"120px\" | Trained\n! width=\"70px\" | Surface\n! width=\"140px\" | Distance (m)\n|-\n| 1\n| 123\n| Roses in May (USA)\n| 5\n| H\n| United States\n| Dirt\n| 2,000\n|-\n| 1\n| 123\n| Silent Witness (AUS)\n| 5\n| G\n| Hong Kong\n| Turf\n| 1,000\n|-\n| 3\n| 120\n| Grand Armee (AUS)\n| 6\n| G\n| Australia\n| Turf\n| 2,000\n|-\n| 4\n| 119\n| Makybe Diva (GB)\n| 6\n| M\n| Australia\n| Turf\n| 2,400\n|-\n| 4\n| 119\n| Vengeance of Rain (NZ)\n| 4\n| G\n| Hong Kong\n| Turf\n| 2,000\n|-\n| 4\n| 119\n| Vinnie Roe (IRE)\n| 7\n| G\n| Ireland\n| Turf\n| 3,200\n|-\n| 7\n| 118\n| Bullish Luck (USA)\n| 6\n| G\n| Hong Kong\n| Turf\n| 1,600 / 2,000\n|-\n| 7\n| 118\n| Elvstroem (AUS)\n| 4\n| C\n| Australia\n| Turf\n| 1,777 / 1,800 / 2,400\n|-\n| 7\n| 118\n| Fastnet Rock (AUS)\n| 3\n| C\n| Australia\n| Turf\n| 1,000\n|-\n| 7\n| 118\n| Savabeel (AUS)\n| 3\n| C\n| Australia\n| Turf\n| 2,040\n|-\n| 11\n| 117\n| Greys Inn (USA)\n| 4\n| C\n| UAE\n| Turf\n| 2,000 / 2,400\n|-\n| 11\n| 117\n| Mummify (AUS)\n| 5\n| G\n| Australia\n| Turf\n| 2,000\n|-\n| 11\n| 117\n| Starcraft (NZ)\n| 4\n| C\n| Australia / GB\n| Turf\n| 1,600\n|-\n| 11\n| 117\n| Touch of Land (FR)\n| 5\n| H\n| France\n| Turf\n| 2,000\n|-\n| 15\n| 116\n| Fields of Omagh (AUS)\n| 7\n| G\n| Australia\n| Turf\n| 2,040\n|-\n| 15\n| 116\n| Phoenix Reach (IRE)\n| 5\n| H\n| Great Britain\n| Turf\n| 2,400\n|-\n| 17\n| 115\n| Alexander Goldrun (IRE)\n| 4\n| F\n| Ireland\n| Turf\n| 2,000\n|-\n| 17\n| 115\n| Cape of Good Hope (GB)\n| 7\n| G\n| Hong Kong\n| Turf\n| 1,000 / 1,200\n|-\n| 17\n| 115\n| Dynever (USA)\n| 5\n| H\n| United States\n| Dirt\n| 2,000\n|-\n| 17\n| 115\n| Firebreak (GB)\n| 5\n| G\n| UAE\n| Turf\n| 1,600\n|-\n| 17\n| 115\n| Regal Roller (AUS)\n| 5\n| G\n| Australia\n| Turf\n| 1,400\n|-\n| 17\n| 115\n| Tycoon (GB)\n| 4\n| C\n| UAE\n| Turf\n| 2,400\n|-\n| 17\n| 115\n| Yard-Arm (SAF)\n| 5\n| G\n| UAE\n| Turf\n| 1,600\n|}\nCertain horses may have also recorded a lesser rating over a distance different from that listed above. The IFHA publishes this information when the lower rating represents the overall top performance in a particular category. There was one such additional rating for this season:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n! width=\"40px\" | Rank\n! width=\"50px\" | Rating\n! width=\"180px\" | Horse\n! width=\"40px\" | Age\n! width=\"40px\" | Sex\n! width=\"120px\" | Trained\n! width=\"70px\" | Surface\n! width=\"140px\" | Distance (m)\n|-\n| +\n| 117\n| Makybe Diva (GB)\n| 6\n| M\n| Australia\n| Turf\n| 3,200\n|}\nTop ranked horses\nThe tables below show the top ranked horses overall, the top fillies and mares, and the top three-year-olds in the 2004–05 Rankings. They also show the top performers in various subdivisions of each group, which are defined by the distances of races, and the surfaces on which they are run. Top ranked horses rated less than 115 are included where known. The IFHA recognizes five distance categories — Sprint, Mile, Intermediate, Long and Extended — identified by the acronym \"SMILE\". These are framed as follows:\n* Sprint: 1,000–1,300m (1,000–1,599m for races in Canada and the United States)\n* Mile: 1,301–1,899m (1,600–1,899m for races in Canada and the United States)\n* Intermediate: 1,900–2,100m\n* Long: 2,101–2,700m\n* Extended: 2,701m +\n----\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n| bgcolor=\"#D2B48C\" colspan=\"4\" | All Horses\n|-\n! width=\"110px\" |\n! width=\"180px\" | All Surfaces\n! width=\"180px\" | Dirt\n! width=\"180px\" | Turf\n|- bgcolor=\"#EFEFEF\"\n| All Distances || 123 – Roses in May  123 – Silent Witness || 123 – Roses in May || 123 – Silent Witness\n|-\n| Sprint || 123 – Silent Witness || not listed || 123 – Silent Witness\n|- bgcolor=\"#EFEFEF\"\n| Mile || 118 – Bullish Luck  118 – Elvstroem || not listed || 118 – Bullish Luck  118 – Elvstroem\n|-\n| Intermediate || 123 – Roses in May || 123 – Roses in May || 120 – Grand Armee\n|- bgcolor=\"#EFEFEF\"\n| Long || 119 – Makybe Diva || not listed || 119 – Makybe Diva\n|-\n| Extended || 119 – Vinnie Roe || not listed || 119 – Vinnie Roe\n|- align=\"center\"\n| bgcolor=\"#D2B48C\" colspan=\"4\" | Fillies and Mares\n|-\n!\n!
