This is a complete list of awards and recognitions she has won.\nFilmfare Awards\nAsha Bhosle has won seven Filmfare Awards for Best Female Playback Singer out of 18 nominations. She won her first two awards in 1967 and 1968, when her elder sister Lata Mangeshkar still used to accept the award (Lata Mangeshkar asked not to be considered for the award nominations after 1969 to promote new talent.) After receiving the award in 1979, Asha Bhosle emulated her sister and requested that her name not be considered for the nominations hereafter. Despite this, she is the most frequent winner of this award to date, tying with Alka Yagnik. She was later given a Special Award for Rangeela  Lifetime Achievement Award in 2001.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ebf5ff;\"\n!Year\n!Category\n!Song/Nomination\n!Result\n|-\n|1967\n|Best Playback Singer (Female)\n|Garibon Ki Suno– Dus Lakh\n|\n|-\n|1969\n|Best Playback Singer (Female)\n|Parde Mein Rehne Do – Shikar\n|\n|-\n|1972\n|Best Playback Singer (Female)\n|Zindegi Ek Safar Hain Suhana – Andaz\n|\n|-\n|1972\n|Best Playback Singer (Female)\n|Piya Tu Ab Toh Aaja – Caravan\n|\n|-\n|1973\n|Best Playback Singer (Female)\n|Dum Maro Dum – Hare Rama Hare Krishna\n|\n|-rowspan=\"2\"\n|1974\n|Best Playback Singer (Female)\n|Jab Andhera Hota Hain - Raja Rani\n|\n|-\n|1974\n|Best Playback Singer (Female)\n|Hungama Ho Gaya - Anhonee\n|\n|-\n|1974\n|Best Playback Singer (Female)\n|Hone Lagi Hain Raat Jawan – Naina\n|\n|-\n|1975\n|Best Playback Singer (Female)\n|Achchhe Samay Par Tum - Bidaai\n|\n|-\n|1975\n|Best Playback Singer (Female)\n|Yeh Hawas Hai Tu Kya Jaane – Hawas\n|\n|-\n|1975\n|Best Playback Singer (Female)\n|Chori Chori Sola Singar - Manoranjan\n|\n|-\n|1975\n|Best Playback Singer (Female)\n|Chainse Humko Kabhi – Pran Jaye Par Vachan Na Jaye\n|\n|-\n|1976\n|Best Playback Singer (Female)\n|Kal Ke Apne – Amanush\n|\n|-\n|1976\n|Best Playback Singer (Female)\n|Sapna Mera Toot Gaya - Khel Khel Mein\n|\n|-\n|1977\n|Best Playback Singer (Female)\n|I Love You – Barood\n|\n|-\n|1978\n|Best Playback Singer (Female)\n|Layee Kahan Hai Zindagi – Taxi Taxie\n|\n|-\n|1979\n|Best Playback Singer (Female)\n|O Sathi Re - Muqaddar Ka Sikandar\n|\n|-\n|1979\n|Best Playback Singer (Female)\n|Yeh Mera Dil – Don\n|\n|-\n|1996\n|Filmfare Special Award\n|songs of Rangeela\n|\n|-\n|2001\n|Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\nNational Film Awards\nNational Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer - 1981 for \"Dil Cheez Kya Hai\" from Umrao Jaan\nNational Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer - 1987 for \"Mera Kuch Samaan\" from Ijaazat\nBengal Film Journalists' Association (BFJA) Award\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ebf5ff;\"\n!Year\n!Category\n!Film\n!Result\n|-\n| 1966\n|BFJA Award for Best Female Playback Singer (Hindi)\n| Waqt\n|\n|-\n| 1967\n|BFJA Award for Best Female Playback Singer (Hindi)\n| Teesri Kasam\n|\n|-\n| 1971\n|BFJA Award for Best Female Playback Singer (Bengali)\n| Megh Kalo\n|\n|-\n| 1987\n|BFJA Award for Best Female Playback Singer (Hindi)\n| Ek Pal\n|\n|-\n|}\nMaharashtra State Film Awards\nAsha Bhosle was the greatest playback singer in Marathi film industry.
