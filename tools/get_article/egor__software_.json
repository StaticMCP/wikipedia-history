The software allowed for the creation of animated graphics with sounds to be deployed as a java applet for use through a web browser. Egor featured a user-friendly interface, tutorials, and sample images and designed for use by non programmers with minimal knowledge of HTML. The software is named after Igor, the mad scientist.\nEgor used non-standard HTML tags which were meant to be used with Netscape 2.\nEgor was designed for use with Netscape as Internet Explorer did not fully support java at the time.\nEgor is no longer supported or sold by Sausage Software.\nFeatures\nThe program allowed creation of animations by specifying a sequence of images.
