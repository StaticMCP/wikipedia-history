It covers eight properties in the Spring Hill neighborhood of Mobile, Alabama, all built during the mid-19th century.\nThey represent the most intact buildings to survive from the period when Spring Hill was a summer retreat town for wealthy Mobilians seeking to escape the heat and yellow fever epidemics of the city.  Situated upon what was once the western hills outside Mobile, Spring Hill was gradually absorbed by the larger city and little remains today from its period as an independent community.\nProperties\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n!
