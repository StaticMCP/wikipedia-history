Some of the instructors from the Royal Navy, but most were RINVR officers.\nThe Bombay Mutiny\nOn 18 February 1946, the ratings of Talwar, declared a hartal (\"strike\"), and refused duty. The next day the \"mutiny\" spread to the RIN Depot at Castle Barracks, and to ships in Bombay harbour. Demonstrations became violent and several arrests were made. Flag Officer, Bombay, received delegates from the mutineers and was presented with a list of demands, including improvements in pay rates and conditions, faster demobilisation according to age and service, and disciplinary action against the commanding officer of Talwar for alleged poor treatment of ratings.\nReferences"
