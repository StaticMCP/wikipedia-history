He received his bachelor's degree from Harvard University in 1954. After graduate study from 1958 to 1959 at the University of Oxford, he returned to Harvard and  earned a Ph.D. there in 1962. His thesis The Lower Central Series for Free Group Complexes was supervised by Raoul Bott. Curtis became an instructor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1962–1964), assistant professor (1964–1967), and associate professor (1967–1970). In 1970 he became a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle, where he remained until his retirement as professor emeritus.\nHis research interests included graph theory and flow networks. In 1967 for his studies on algebraic topology he received a Guggenheim Fellowship and in 1972 the Leroy P. Steele Prize for his paper Simplicial homotopy theory.\nCurtis died in Seattle, Washington on April 2, 2024, at the age of 91.\nWorks\n*\n*\n* with James A.
