      "text": "# Treaty of Malmö\n\nThe Treaty of Malmö (), signed on 1 September 1524, ended the Swedish War of Liberation. King Frederick I of Denmark–Norway acknowledged Gustav Vasa as the king of Sweden, who in turn renounced claims to Scania and Blekinge.\nThe difficult question of the control of Gotland was deferred, to be refereed by a committee of representatives from various Hanseatic League cities. Swedish troops were to continue military occupation of Ranrike until the issue was resolved. By 1532, no agreement had been reached, and Ranrike was returned to Denmark–Norway in exchange for 1,200 guilders.\nSee also\n*List of treaties\nReferences\nOther sources\n*Gary Dean Peterson (2014) Warrior Kings of Sweden: The Rise of an Empire in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries (McFarland)\nExternal links\n*[http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/16cen/sweddan15211523.html Swedish War of Liberation, 1521-1523]\n\n---\n\n## Treaty of Malmo\n\n#REDIRECT Treaty of Malmö\n}}"
