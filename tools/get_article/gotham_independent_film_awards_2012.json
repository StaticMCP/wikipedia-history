The nominees were announced on October 18, 2012. The ceremony was hosted by Mike Birbiglia.\nDuring the award ceremony, Birbiglia roasted special award recipient David O. Russell by reading a transcript of Russell's argument with Lily Tomlin that occurred on the set of I Heart Huckabees. The event, specifically the joke and what transpired around it, later formed a large part of Birbiglia's show, Thank God for Jokes.\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable\" role=\"presentation\"\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n* Moonrise Kingdom\n** Bernie\n** The Loneliest Planet\n** The Master\n** Middle of Nowhere\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n* How to Survive a Plague\n** Detropia\n** Marina Abramovic: The Artist is Present\n** Room 237\n** The Waiting Room\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n* 'Benh Zeitlin – Beasts of the Southern Wild'\n** Zal Batmanglij – Sound of My Voice\n** Brian M.
