      "text": "# Bibliography of the Vietnam War\n\nThis is a bibliography of works on the Vietnam War.\nThe bibliography aims to include primary, secondary and tertiary sources. Additionally, the scope of the bibliography expands to the causes of the Vietnam War and the immediate aftermath, such as evacuation and expulsion and war crimes trials. Works on the causes or the aftermath of the Vietnam War should only be included if they describe the respective events in the specific context of and relation to the conflict itself.\nThere are thousands of books written about the Vietnam War; therefore, this is not an all-inclusive list. This bibliography also does not aim to include fictional works (see List of Vietnam War films). It does not aim to include self-published works, unless there is a very good reason to do so.\nBibliography\n*\n*\n* Baker, Kevin. \"Stabbed in the Back!
