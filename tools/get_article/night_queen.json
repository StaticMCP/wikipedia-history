When Esra was five years old, their mother died while giving birth to Mert. As he grew older, Kartal was arranged to marry Esra and came to be in charge of Aziz's business. It was through this position that he was able to travel to France accompanied by his brother, Emre. While in France, Kartal met a girl named Selin, who turned out to be Osman's daughter.

When she discovered that her father was involved in the scam, she got him arrested and sentenced to prison. However, when Aziz's family discovered that he was a killer, they all turned against him, leading to him committing suicide. Despite repeated murder attempts, Esra reconciled with Selin a month later. Mert apologized to Kartal for presuming he was only looking for a way to take their money.
