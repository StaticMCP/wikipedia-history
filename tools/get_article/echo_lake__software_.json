It was touted internally as a \"cross [of] Quark Xpress and Myst\". It featured an immersive 3D environment where a user could go to a virtual desktop in a virtual office and assemble video and audio clips along with images, and then print them out as either a virtual book other users of the program could use, or for print. It was a highly innovative product for its time, and ultimately was hampered by the inability of many users able to input their own multimedia content easily into a computer from that period.\nCreative Wonders bought the rights to the Echo Lake multimedia product, which was re-shaped as an introductory program on multimedia and re-released as Family Album Creator in 1996.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050406114358/http://www.kevinsteele.com/mackerel_el_index.html My Echo Lake Scrapbook]"
