The Association is headquartered at the heritage-listed house Miegunyah in Bowen Hills.\nHistory\nin 1963]]\nThe association was established in Brisbane in April 1950 as the Women's Historical Association. Its headquarters were at the heritage-listed Newstead House. In 1957 it was renamed the Queensland Women's Historical Association. From 1960 to 1983 the Association placed plaques to commemorate historic sites associated with Queensland's history.\nIn 1966, Newstead House was to be converted into a museum so the Association required new headquarters. At the same time, a nearby historic house Miegunyah (then called Beverley Wood) in Bowen Hills was about to be demolished. Through an appeal to members, the Association raised the funds for a deposit to buy Miegunyah to restore it to its former glory, and to fulfil the goal to have a Folk Museum dedicated to the pioneer women of Queensland and to display their collection of Queensland artefacts.\nCurrent activities\nThe Association continues to restore and maintain Miegunyah, which is open to the public as a museum and a venue for talks, exhibitions and social events. The Association maintains a library and archive and publishes books.\nPlaques\nSome of the plaques placed by the QWHA include:\n* the monument at Lake Moogerah to the women of the Fassifern District\n* the Cactoblastis Memorial beside Myall Creek, Dalby commemorating the introduction of the Cactoblastis insect that helped eradicate the highly invasive prickly pear from Queensland farmland\nCollection policy\nIn the absence of a well-defined collection policy, over the years the Association acquired via donations a number of items in its collection that did not fit its primary mission to collect and preserve women's history, often to save precious artefacts which might otherwise have been lost in the absence of other collecting organisations. Following the establishment of a collection policy and a review of the collection in 2016, it was decided some original items should be donated to more appropriate collections.\nIn 1964, Roma Browne, granddaughter of the first Queensland Governor, George Bowen, donated a silver spade to the QWHA. Bowen had used this spade to turn the first sod of the Queensland Northern Railway at Rockhampton on 27 September 1865 and had been presented with the spade as a souvenir of the occasion. In 2018, the Association donated it to the State Library of Queensland.\nAlso in 1964, Mrs Vernon Alford donated a parian ware vase to the Association. It is believed to be a favourite wedding present of Mrs Louis Hope of Ormiston House. In 2018, it was donated to the Ormiston House Museum.\nPublished works\nPublished works of the Association include:\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
