According to Corinthian tradition, Thoas and his descendants continued to rule Corinth until the coming of the Heraclids.\nMythology\nAccording to the geographer Pausanias, Thoas remained in Corinth, succeeding his father as its ruler, while his brother Phocus led a colony to Tithorea. Thoas was the father of Damophon, Damophon of Propodas, and Propodas of Doridas and Hyanthidas. During the reign of the latter two, Corinth was seized by the Dorians under the command of Aletes, son of Hippotes. The brothers handed control of Corinth to him and were allowed to remain in the city, while the rest of the people were expelled.\nNotes\nReferences\n* Grimal, Pierre, The Dictionary of Classical Mythology, Wiley-Blackwell, 1996. .\n* Hard, Robin, ''The Routledge Handbook of Greek Mythology: Based on H.J.
