The award was named in honor of former player and executive Branch Rickey, who broke the major league color barrier by signing Jackie Robinson, while president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers. Rickey also created the Knothole Gang, a charity that allowed children to attend MLB games.\nThe award, created by the Rotary Club of Denver in 1991, was first awarded to Dave Winfield in 1992 at their annual banquet. Each MLB team nominates one individual who best exemplifies the Rotary Club motto: \"Service Above Self\". A vote is then conducted by the national selection committee, which consists of members of the sports media, previous winners of the award, and Rotary district governors in major league cities. Proceeds of the banquet benefit Denver Kids, Inc., a charity for at-risk students who attend Denver Public Schools. Each winner receives a bronze sculpture of a baseball player measuring , named \"The Player\", designed by sculptor George Lundeen.  A larger version of \"The Player\", standing  tall, was erected at Coors Field in Denver.\nWinners of the Branch Rickey Award have undertaken different causes. Many winners, including Todd Stottlemyre, Jamie Moyer, John Smoltz, Torii Hunter, Vernon Wells, and Shane Victorino, worked with children in need. Stottlemyre visited and raised money for a nine-year-old girl who suffered from aplastic anemia and required a bone marrow transplant, while Moyer's foundation raised US$6&nbsp;million to support underprivileged children. Other winners devoted their work to aiding individuals who had a specific illness, such as Curt Schilling, who raised money for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Trevor Hoffman, who lost a kidney as an infant and devoted himself to working with individuals with nephropathy. Also, some winners devoted themselves to working with major disasters and tragedies. Bobby Valentine donated money to charities benefiting victims of the September 11 attacks, while Luis Gonzalez worked with survivors of Hurricane Katrina.\nThe Dodgers' Branch Rickey Awards for 2025 were presented to Venezuelan Eduardo Quintero and Mexican Christian Zazueta, who were named the organization's 2025 Minor League Players of the Year. Eduardo Quintero stood out for his offense with a 153 wRC+, 19 home runs, and 47 stolen bases, while Zazueta was recognized for his pitching work with a 2.41 ERA, 67.1 innings pitched, and a 23.8% K-BB rate.\nPrevious winners\nwon the award in 2002 in recognition of his charitable work for the survivors of the September 11 attacks.|alt=A man in a blue suit and a blue tie looks to his right and smiles.]]\nand his wife, supports underprivileged children.|alt=A man in a white baseball uniform with red lettering and a red hat and red shoes stands on a baseball field reaching into the stands to sign autographs for fans.]]\n{| class=wikitable\n|+Key\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffb; text-align:center\"|\n| Member of the Baseball Hall of Fame\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#cfecec; text-align:center\"|\n| Denotes player who is still active\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Year\n!scope=\"col\"|Recipient\n!scope=\"col\"|Team\n!scope=\"col\"|Position\n!scope=\"col\" class=unsortable|Ref\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffb; text-align:center\"|}}\n|Toronto Blue Jays||Outfielder||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffb; text-align:center\"|}}\n|Minnesota Twins||Outfielder||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffb; text-align:center\"|}}\n|St. Louis Cardinals||Shortstop||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffb; text-align:center\"|}}\n|San Diego Padres||Outfielder||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|Los Angeles Dodgers||Outfielder||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffb; text-align:center\"|}}\n|Houston Astros||Second baseman||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffb; text-align:center\"|}}\n|Minnesota Twins||Designated hitter||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|New York Mets||Pitcher||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|Arizona Diamondbacks||Pitcher||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|Arizona Diamondbacks||Pitcher||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|New York Mets||Manager||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|Chicago White Sox||General manager||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|Seattle Mariners||Pitcher||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|Arizona Diamondbacks||Outfielder||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffb; text-align:center\"|}}\n|Los Angeles Dodgers||Senior vice president||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffb; text-align:center\"|}}\n|Atlanta Braves||Pitcher||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffb; text-align:center\"|}}\n|San Diego Padres||Pitcher||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim||Outfielder||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|Toronto Blue Jays||Outfielder||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|Philadelphia Phillies||Outfielder||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|New York Mets||Pitcher||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#cfecec; text-align:center\"|}}\n|Los Angeles Dodgers||Pitcher||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#cfecec; text-align:center\"|}}\n|Chicago Cubs||First baseman||\n|}\nSee also\n*Roberto Clemente Award\n*Marvin Miller Man of the Year Award (Players Choice Awards)\n*Bart Giamatti Award\n*Lou Gehrig Memorial Award\n*Baseball awards\n*Cy Young Award\nReferences\nGeneral\n*\nSpecific"
