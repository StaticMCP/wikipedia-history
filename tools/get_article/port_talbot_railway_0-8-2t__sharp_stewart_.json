Three were built in 1901, works nos. 4794 - 4796. They were numbered 17-19 and became Great Western Railway numbers 1358-1360.\nThese were unusually large locomotives for their time and place. Most of the railways of South Wales relied on 0-6-2T tank locomotives.\nNumber 1360 was withdrawn in November 1926, followed by 1359 in December 1935.  Number 1358 survived to be taken over by British Railways on 1 January 1948 but was withdrawn on 29 February 1948. All three locomotives were scrapped.\nSee also\n* Port Talbot Railway 0-8-2T (Cooke)\n* Port Talbot Railway 0-6-2T (Stephenson)\n* Locomotives of the Great Western Railway\nSources\n* [http://www.railuk.info/steam/getsteam.php?row_id=303 Rail UK database entry for 1358]"
