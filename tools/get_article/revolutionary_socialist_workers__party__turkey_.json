It was founded by Şevket Doğan Tarkan and his friends from Trotskyist journal Socialist Worker'' in 1997. The group had links to far-left Kurtuluş Hareketi (Liberation Movement) before the 1980 Turkish coup d'état.\nAn opposition grouping within DSİP named Antikapitalist was formed following a split in DSİP. The group had no relation with DSİP after that split.\nThe party did not participate in elections in Turkey but supported left-wing electoral alliances. At the 2007 elections, they declared support for the independent candidates of Democratic Society Party. The party voted \"yes\" in the 2010 Turkish constitutional referendum as part of the Yetmez Ama Evet (\"Not Enough but Yes\") campaign.\nThe DSİP is the Turkish section of the International Socialist Tendency. The DSİP supports the political magazine Altüst.\nThe party is one of the participants in the Peoples' Democratic Congress, a political initiative instrumental in founding the Peoples' Democratic Party in 2012.\nLawyer Mücteba Kılıç, a member of the DSİP who was once on the agenda with the Young Civilians Initiative, was detained within the scope of the 'FETÖ' operation in 2016.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
