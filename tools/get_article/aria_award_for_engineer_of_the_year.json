The ARIA Awards recognise \"the many achievements of Australian artists across all music genres\", and have been given by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) since 1987.\nThe award is given to the audio engineer(s) who is from, or resides in Australia, and has overall responsibility for the work's production. The accolade is restricted to \"A single track, multiple tracks, or an entire album may be submitted for each engineer. DVD releases are not eligible. Only work released during the period of eligibility will be considered. International product is eligible but entrants must accord with the general eligibility criteria for artists. In the case of a co-engineer, all parties must individually meet the artist eligibility criteria.\" Engineer of the Year is voted for by a judging school, which consists of between 40 and 100 representatives experienced with that genre of music.\nWinners and nominees\nIn the following table, the winner is highlighted in a separate colour, and in boldface; the nominees are those that are not highlighted or in boldface. Nominees for some years are not available in published sources. Both Matt Lovell and Wayne Connolly have received the award three times.\nThe years listed in the first column relate to the year and edition of the awards ceremony. The second column indicates the audio engineer(s) responsible for the work. The \"Work title(s) and original recording artist(s)\" column names the work(s) whose engineering has been nominated, and its original recording artist; the musician is not the nominee unless they were the engineer.\nEngineer of the Year\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"19%\" | Engineer(s)\n! width=\"19%\" | Work title(s) and original recording
