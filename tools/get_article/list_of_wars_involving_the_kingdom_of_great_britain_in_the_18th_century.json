The American Revolution started as a civil war within the British Empire., The Slate, 6 September 2016. A significant number of American colonists stayed loyal to the British Crown and as Loyalists fought on the British side while opposite were a significant amount of colonists called Patriots who fought on the American side. In some localities, there was fierce fighting between Americans including gruesome instances of hanging, drawing, and quartering on both sides.\n* As early as 1789, David Ramsay, an American patriot historian, wrote in his History of the American Revolution that \"Many circumstances concurred to make the American war particularly calamitous. It was originally a civil war in the estimation of both parties.\" Framing the American Revolutionary War as a civil war is gaining increasing examination.[https://earlyamericanists.com/2014/02/18/was-the-american-revolution-a-civil-war/]. You can read part two of his 1789 book in full [https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/cohen-the-history-of-the-american-revolution-vol-2 here]\n* A group of Bristol, England merchants wrote to King George III in 1775 voicing their \"most anxious apprehensions for ourselves and Posterity that we behold the growing distractions in America threaten\" and ask for their majesty's \"Wisdom and Goodness\" to save them from \"a lasting and ruinous Civil War.\"[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/british-perspective-american-revolution]. You can read the 1775 petition in full [https://digital.lib.niu.edu/islandora/object/niu-amarch%3A80193 here]\n* The \"constrained voice\" is a good synopsis of how the British viewed the American Revolutionary War. From anxiety to a foreboding sense of the conflict being a civil war,[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/british-perspective-american-revolution]\n* In the early stages of the rebellion by the American colonists, most of them still saw themselves as English subjects who were being denied their rights as such. \"Taxation without representation is tyranny,\" James Otis reportedly said in protest of the lack of colonial representation in Parliament. What made the American Revolution look most like a civil war, though, was the reality that about one-third of the colonists, known as loyalists (or Tories), continued to support and fought on the side of the crown.''[https://www.britannica.com/event/American-Revolution]}} It became a larger international war in 1778 once France joined.\nTreaty of Paris:\n* 13 North American colonies recognised as
