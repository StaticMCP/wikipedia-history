In the , Danbulla had a population of 88 people.\nGeography\nDanbulla is on the Atherton Tableland. It is bounded to the west by Lake Tinaroo, to the north by Tinaroo Range, to the north-east and east by Lamb Range, to the south-east by Main Range, and to the south-west by Surprise Creek, a tributary of Lake Tinaroo.

At its peak during World War II, the district had a population of around 150-200 in about 50 families. Its facilities included the school, a public hall, telephone exchange and sawmill.\nDuring World War II, the need to repel the Japanese invasion of South-East Asia and New Guinea required troops to be trained in jungle warfare and Danbulla was selected as one of the jungle warfare training areas on the Atherton Tableland. An estimated 100,000 to 150,000 troops received training on the tableland.\nAfter World War II, Danbulla farmers experienced problems with drought, poor soil, and the transport to the milk factory in Malanda. The construction of the Tinaroo Dam to impound the Barron River resulted in the inundation of Dunbulla's farms and facilities. Most people had moved away by the time the dam opened in 1958.\nDemographics\nIn the , Danbulla had a population of 47 people.\nIn the , Danbulla had a population of 88 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Danbulla.
