The record, executively produced by Kanye West, features North West, West's eldest daughter, and YZY signee JAAS on its lead single, \"Lonely Roads\". The EP was released on June 27, 2025, by Goodfellas Entertainment, shortly after West announced it on Instagram.\nBackground\nAlthough unclear when West and Combs began first working together, it was likely around the beginning of 2025 through connections with Ty Dolla Sign as Combs would feature on Ty Dolla Sign's single \"Wheels Fall Off\" alongside West in the song's initial release on the Yeezy website. Combs would also be present during the sessions between West and the Game in early 2025 for The Game's album The Documentary 3 and would record a feature for the song \"Free Suge\" alongside West.\nOn March 15, 2025, Kanye West released the EP's lead single, \"Lonely Roads\", featuring Combs, himself, his daughter North West and new YZY signee Jasmine Williams through his X account, under the name \"Lonely Roads Still Go to Sunshine\". Before the song could release on streaming however, West's ex-wife Kim Kardashian would intervene in its release due to concerns about their daughter, North West being on the song. Following a back-and-forth argument between Kim and Ye, the song's streaming release had been pushed back for months and only remained an X exclusive.\nOn June 13th, following the direction of West's own solo album Cuck shifting, an info-dump regarding the album would come out, sharing that Combs had began working closely with and Ye and had recorded for the song \"DIDDY FREE\" which had initially been intended for West's own solo work. It's likely that this is where the sessions for this record had materialized.\nOn June 27th, the EP was released in its full length.\nArtwork\nThe official cover art for Ye and Combs' collaborative EP, unlike other album covers for previous Ye albums, had not been revealed until the day of release. The photographer for the cover photo has yet to be shared.\nThe cover art for the record features what seems to be a run down theatre in a New York City landscape reading Combs' label atop of the hanging sign, Bad Boy Worldwide. The image features an old-timey black-and-white effect layered atop the image.\nTrack listing\nAll tracks produced by Kanye West.\nPersonnel\nReferences\n2. Moore, S.
