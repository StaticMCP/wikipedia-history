In the centuries to follow, Ding Wei has almost always been portrayed as a treacherous minister in popular fiction.\nEarly career\nDing Wei once wrote a prose essay with his friend Sun He () that quite impressed Wang Yucheng, a leading literati. Wang Yucheng considered their writing the best in China since Han Yu and Liu Zongyuan almost two centuries ago. In 992, Ding Wei passed the imperial examination and became the controller-general of Raozhou. A year later, he accompanied the crown prince Zhao Yuankan to inspect Fujian. Upon his return, he presented a report on salt and tea, and was made fiscal commissioner.\nNotes and references\n* |display-editors=etal}}\n* }}"
