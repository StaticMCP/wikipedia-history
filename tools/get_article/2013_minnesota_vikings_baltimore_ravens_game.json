The game was notable for featuring five touchdowns in the final 2:05 of regulation, each of which, outside of the final one, temporarily giving the scoring team the lead. Played amid mild snowfall at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, Maryland and despite a 7–6 Ravens lead heading into the fourth quarter, the reigning champion Ravens defeated the Vikings, 29–26. The Ravens ultimately prevailed on a 9-yard touchdown pass from Joe Flacco to rookie Marlon Brown with four seconds remaining in regulation.\nThe frantic finish has been remembered as one of the wildest endings in NFL history, with both teams trading scores in a snow-covered shootout after three quarters of defensive play.\nBackground\nThe Ravens, coming off a 22–20 home win over their division rival Pittsburgh Steelers on Thanksgiving, entered the game with a 6–6 record, attempting to remain in the AFC Wild Card race. The Vikings, at 3–8–1 and coming off a 23–20 overtime victory at home over their division rival Chicago Bears, had already been eliminated from playoff contention. Oddsmakers favored the Ravens by 6.5 points at kickoff.\nSevere winter weather created difficult conditions, with snow covering the field throughout much of the game and limiting offensive output until the final quarter.\nBox score\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week Fourteen: Minnesota Vikings at Baltimore Ravens&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=December 8, 2013\n|time=1:00&nbsp;pm.

The Ravens' lone touchdown came on a 1-yard Flacco pass to tight end Ed Dickson, while the Vikings managed two Blair Walsh field goals. Reigning MVP and Vikings star running Adrian Peterson would suffer an ankle injury early in the second quarter and not return. The Ravens led 7–6 entering the fourth quarter.\nFourth quarter\nThe game’s legacy was defined by its closing minutes.\n* Just before the two-minute warning, with the Vikings leading 12–7, Joe Flacco found Dennis Pitta for a 1-yard touchdown pass on 4th-and-goal, with a subsequent successful two-point conversion via Torrey Smith, to give the Ravens a 15–12 lead. Pitta was making his season-debut and playing in his first game since Super Bowl XLVII ten months earlier, as he was previously out with a hip injury.\n* With 1:27 left, Toby Gerhart broke free for a 41-yard rushing touchdown, giving the Vikings a 19–15 advantage. Gerhart was filling in for reigning MVP Adrian Peterson, who would not return to the game after suffering a second quarter ankle injury.\n* On the ensuing kickoff, Jacoby Jones returned it 77 yards for a touchdown, swinging the lead back to the Ravens, 22–19, with 1:16 remaining.\n* Just 45 seconds later, rookie wide receiver Cordarrelle Patterson caught a screen pass and raced 79 yards for a touchdown, putting the Vikings ahead 26–22.\n* The Ravens then executed a final drive, capped with a 9-yard touchdown pass from Flacco to Marlon Brown, another rookie wide receiver, with four seconds left, sealing the 29–26 win.\nIn total, the teams combined for five touchdowns in the final 125 seconds of play.\nAftermath\nThis was the Ravens' final home victory of 2013. The victory improved Baltimore to 7–6, keeping them in the AFC playoff hunt. The Vikings fell to 3–9–1. Each team would go 1–2 in their remaining final three games and a 34–17 road loss for the Ravens in Week 17 to their division rival Cincinnati Bengals effectively eliminated the team from playoff contention and ended their chances of becoming the first team to repeat as champions since the 2003 and 2004 New England Patriots.\nThe game is frequently cited among the most exciting finishes in NFL history.\nSee also\n* Miracle at the New Meadowlands (December 2010)\n* 2013 Denver Broncos–Dallas Cowboys game (October 2013)\n* 2015 New York Giants–New Orleans Saints game (November 2015)\n* Snow Bowl (December 2017)\n* 2018 Kansas City Chiefs–Los Angeles Rams game (November 2018)\n* 2022 Indianapolis Colts–Minnesota Vikings game (December 2022)\nReferences"
