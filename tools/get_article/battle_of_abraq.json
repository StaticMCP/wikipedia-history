It is within the Nejd region, a central-western part of Saudi Arabia, and the battle took place in mid-August of the year 632. It battled the forces of the Rashidun Caliphate, led by Caliph Abu Bakr As-Siddiq, against rebellious Arab tribes led, according to Agha Ali Ibrahim Akram, by General Hibal ibn Khuwailid.\nThis victory for the Rashidun Caliphate marked the end of defensive operations for Medina, and the beginning of large-scale offensive attack throughout the Arabian Peninsula by Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, and the regrouping of the defeated tribes that fleed the battle into a unified force at Buzakha.\nBackground\nAfter their defeat at the Battle of Dhu al-Qassah, several rebellious Arab tribes turned violently against their fellow tribesmen who had remained loyal to Islam, killing them.\nAfter learning the outcome of the battle, Arab tribes living near Medina clarified their neutral status. Many tribes sent delegations to Medina, pledging allegiance to the authorities and paying the zakat. Meanwhile, the tribes opposed to Islam openly declared their apostasy. As the situation became more pressing, the zakat began arriving in Medina that same night, brought first by Safwan bin Safwan ibn Tamimi, then by Al-Zabarqan Bin Badr, and finally by Addy ibn Hatim. Safwan bin Safwan ibn Tamimi arrived at the beginning of the night, Al-Zabarqan Bin Badr arrived in the middle of the night, and Addy ibn Hatim at the end.\nA few days later, on , the army of Usama ibn Zayd returned to Medina after a successful expedition.\nThe spoils obtained from this expedition, combined with the zakat, greatly helped strengthen the financial base of the Rashidun Caliphate, providing a solid foundation to meet the military needs against the enemies of the Rashidun Caliphate.\nForces\nRashidun Caliphate\nThe exact strength of the Rashidun Caliphate forces during the Battle of Abraq are currently unknown. However, available information indicates that they were numerically inferior to the rebellious tribes.\nArab tribes\nThe exact strength of the rebellious tribes is currently unknown to this day, but it is established that they were more numerous than the forces of the Rashidun Caliphate. The tribes that participated in the battle are clearly identified, as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: auto;text-align: center;\"\n|+ According to Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, Agha Ali Ibrahim Akram, and Zhaenal Fanani, these tribes participated:\n|-\n|Banu Asad\n|\n*Banu Ghatafan\n**Banu Dhubyan,\n**Banu Abs,\n|Tayy\n|-\n|Banu Hawāzin\n|\n*Banu Kinanah\n**Banu Bakr ibn Abd Manat\n|Banu Subay'\n|}\nBuild up\nAccording to Agha Ibrahim Akram\nAccording to the account of Agha Ibrahim Akram in his book Khalid Bin Al-Waleed: Sword Of Allah, after the Battle of Dhu al-Qassah, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq decided to delay a general offensive to allow Usama ibn Zayd's army to rest and re-equip. Meanwhile, he worked to form a new army in Medina. Although this force was assembled quickly, it resembled a formidable army. Abu Bakr As-Siddiq then considered launching a campaign against the rebellious Arab tribes gathered at Abraq and prepared for war.\nWhen he announced his intention to personally lead the army, some Muslims tried to dissuade him:\nDetermined, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq believed there was no better way to inspire his troops than to lead by example. He responded:\nUnder his leadership, the army marched towards Dhu al-Qassah. where they were joined by Al-Nu'man ibn Muqrin. Abdullah ibn Muqrin and  reoccupied the strategic positions they had held during the Battle of Dhu al-Qassah: Al-Nu'man ibn Muqrin commanded the right wing, Abdullah ibn Muqrin the left wing, and Suwaid ibn Muqrin the rear guard. After arriving at Dhu al-Qassah, the army then proceeded towards Abraq. This was in the second week of August 632 AD, corresponding to the third week of Joumada al-oula in the year 632 AH.\nAccording to Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari\nIn his book The History of al-Tabari Vol. 10: The Conquest of Arabia, Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari reports that after the Battle of Dhu al-Qassah, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq ordered Usama ibn Zayd's troops to rest, and then left the charge of Medina to Usama ibn Zayd. He said:\nHe then prepared a new expedition against the rebellious tribes at Abraq. Several companions, concerned for his safety, said to him:\nAbu Bakr As-Siddiq, determined, firmly rejected this suggestion and replied:\nHe then led his army towards Dhu al-Qassah. With Abdullah ibn Muqrin and  occupying their usual positions: Abdullah ibn Muqrin commanded the left flank and Suwaid ibn Muqrin the rear guard. As for the third brother, Al-Nu'man ibn Muqrin, he was left at Dhu al-Qassah to hold his position.\nThe army then continued its march towards Abraq.\nBattle\nAccording to Agha Ibrahim Akram\nUpon arriving at Abraq, the forces of the Rashidun Caliphate found that the rebellious Arab tribes were already in combat positions. Abu Bakr As-Siddiq quickly deployed his army and launched an offensive force against the insurgents.\nThe morale of the rebels at Abraq was affected by the arrival of the survivors of the Battle of Dhu al-Qassah, who had recently been defeated, which weakened their resolve to continue the rebellion. Although they were numerically superior, the rebels held out for some time before dispersing and fleeing to Buzakha, where Tulayha ibn Khuwaylid had established his base after departing .\nThis victory marked a new success for the Rashidun Caliphate.\nAccording to Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari\nAbu Bakr As-Siddiq traveled to Al-Rabadha, where he met the Banu Abs, the Banu Dhubyan, as well as a group of Banu Bakr ibn Abd Manat. There, they clashed at al-Abraq. Al-Harith ibn Fulan, a member of the Banu Subay', and Awf ibn Fulan ibn Sinan were killed in the fighting, while Al-Hutay'ah was taken prisoner. The Banu Abs and Banu Bakr ibn Abd Manat tribes fled, marking the defeat of the rebellious Arab tribes.\nRegarding the Battle of Abraq, Ziyad ibn Hanzalah al-Tamimi said:\nAftermath\nAccording to Agha Ibrahim Akram\nAfter the battle, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq deployed several columns of the army to pacify the surrounding regions. Taxes were collected following these operations, and the repentant clans offered gifts, which were accepted, and  the next day, the Caliph left Abraq to return to Medina.\nAccording to Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari\nAfter the battle, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq stayed in Abraq for a few days. The Banu Dhubyan, who dominated the region,}}\nAbraq was then reserved for the horses of the Muslims, while the rest of the land in Al-Rabadha was turned into pasture for the people. After the defeat of the rebellious Arab tribes, the Banu Tha'labah tried to resettle on this land but were prevented from doing so. They went to Medina to protest, claiming that the land belonged to them and asking:\nAbu Bakr As-Siddiq replied:\nHe refused their request and granted them no favor.\nOutcome and consequences\nAlthough numerically superior, the rebellious Arab tribes were weakened and unable to continue the rebellion due to their defeat at the Battle of Dhu al-Qassah. The strategy of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq, combining direct attacks and skilled maneuvers, disorganized the forces of the Arab rebels, leading to the flight of some tribes and the victory of the Rashidun Caliphate.\nThe battle fought against the rebellious tribes at Abraq aimed primarily to prevent any threat to Medina and to dissuade the rebellious Arab tribes from launching new offensives. Another consequence of this victory was that Abu Bakr As-Siddiq began preparing a major campaign across the entire Arabian Peninsula to reestablish the control of the Rashidun Caliphate over the region.\nFurthermore, the lands of Abraq, which had previously been under the control of the Banu Dhubyan, were confiscated by Abu Bakr As-Siddiq and turned into grazing land for state animals.\nFinally, the defeated rebellious tribes regrouped around Tulayha ibn Khuwaylid at .\nSee also\n* List of battles of the Rashidun Caliphate\n* Battle of Dhul al-Qassah\n* Ridda wars\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
