The category was established at the 1st Children's and Family Emmy Awards in 2022 and is open to performers of all genders. The inaugural recipient of the award was Nonso Anozie for his role as Tommy Jepperd in the Netflix series Sweet Tooth. The current holder of the award is Amanda Lawrence, who won the 3rd Children's and Family Emmy Awards for her role as Matron Shipley in the BYU TV historical drama series Malory Towers.\nBackground\nOn November 17, 2021, the NATAS announced the creation of the Children's and Family Emmy Awards to recognize the best in children's and family television. The organization cited an \"explosive growth in the quantity and quality of children’s and family programming\" as justification for a dedicated ceremony. Many categories of the awards were previously presented at the Daytime Emmy Awards. Performers in programming aimed towards children and young people were previously honored with the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in Children's Programming, which was presented under various names however, following the announcement of the establishment of the Children's and Family Emmy Awards, these categories were discontinued.\nThe original name for the category was '''Outstanding Supporting Performance in a Preschool, Children's or Young Teen Program''', and the award received its current name as of the 3rd Children's and Family Emmy Awards.\nWinners and nominations\n.]]\n2020s\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  width=\"85%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n!
