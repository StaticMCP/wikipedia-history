In July, Guimeran was tasked with taking Bishop Nicola Maria Caracciolo of Catania to Naples at the head of 7 galleys.\nWhile carrying out this task, he came across two quality belonging to Turgut Reis near the island of Stromboli and set out to capture them with his 3 ships. However, when he arrived off the coast of Lipari, he fell into the trap of 7 galleys belonging to Turgut Reis.\nInstead of taking refuge in Lipari or fleeing to Sicily, Guimeran preferred to fight. In the battle in which all ships entered, the flagship of the Sicilians was boarded by Turkish sailors, and Guimeran died from arquebus fire in his head. As a result of a clash that lasted less than an hour, first the captain's ship and then the entire Sicily fleet were captured by Turgut Reis.\nAftermath\nTurgut Reis commanded Ottoman fleet after replenishing water in Gozo returned to Tripoli with captive ships. Then in August they put to sea again and blockaded Naples.\nReferences"
