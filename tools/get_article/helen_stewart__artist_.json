Although she was initially rejected by the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts she did later exhibit with them. She also exhibited with the Christchurch based art association, 'The Group', in 1948. In 1949 she was one of the 'Group of Nine Artists' that exhibited at Helen Hitchings' Gallery in Wellington.\nStewart returned to New Zealand in 1946 and settled in Lowry Bay, Wellington.
