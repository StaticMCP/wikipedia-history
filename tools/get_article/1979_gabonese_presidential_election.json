The country was a one-party state at the time, with the Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG) as the sole legal party. PDG leader and incumbent president Omar Bongo was the only candidate, and was unopposed for a second full term. Bongo claimed to have received 100% of valid votes, with only 236 people casting blank or spoiled ballots. Voter turnout was allegedly near 100%.\nResults\nReferences"
