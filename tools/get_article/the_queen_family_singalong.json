Hosted by Darren Criss and spun off from ABC's 2020 specials The Disney Family Singalong, the special featured performances of songs by the British rock band Queen by celebrity guests. The special featured an appearance by Adam Lambert—who performs as lead singer with the band's members as Queen + Adam Lambert. As a salute to the reopening of Broadway theatres amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the special also included a performance of \"Don't Stop Me Now\" by the Broadway casts of Disney's musicals Aladdin and The Lion King.\nPerformances\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Performers & Songs featured on The Queen Family Singalong\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Artist(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Song(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Album\n|-\n| JoJo SiwaOrianthi\n| \"We Will Rock You\"\n| News of the World\n|-\n| Jimmie Allen featuring Miss Piggy\n| \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\"\n| The Game\n|-\n| Pentatonix\n| \"Somebody to Love\"\n| A Day at the Races\n|-\n| The cast of The Lion KingBonita HamiltonMduduzi MadelaBrandon McCallAdrienne WalkerThe cast of AladdinMilo AlosiTia AltinayLissa DeGuzmanMichael James Scott\n| \"Don't Stop Me Now\"\n| Jazz\n|-\n| Fall Out Boy\n| \"Under Pressure\"\n| Hot Space\n|-\n| Derek Hough featuring Alexander Jean\n| \"Another One Bites the Dust\"\n| The Game\n|-\n| Alessia Cara\n| \"Killer Queen\"\n| Sheer Heart Attack\n|-\n| OneRepublic\n| \"We Are the Champions\"\n| News of the World\n|-\n| Adam Lambert\n| \"The Show Must Go On\"\n| Innuendo\n|-\n| Darren Criss and Various\n| \"Bohemian Rhapsody\"\n| A Night at the Opera\n|-\n|}\nAppearances\n*Animal\nBroadcast\nThe special was seen by a total of 3.51 million viewers, with a 0.5 share of viewers 18-49; it was the lowest-rated entry in ABC's Family Singalong franchise, with a 58% decline in comparison to November 2020's The Disney Holiday Singalong.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
