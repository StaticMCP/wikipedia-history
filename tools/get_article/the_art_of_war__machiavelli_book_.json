Written between 1519 and 1520 and published the following year, it was Machiavelli's only historical or political work printed during his lifetime.\nFormat\nThe Art of War is divided into a preface (proemio) and seven books (chapters), which take the form of a series of dialogues that take place in the Orti Oricellari, the gardens built in a classical style by Bernardo Rucellai in the 1490s for Florentine aristocrats and humanists to engage in discussion, between Cosimo Rucellai and \"Lord Fabrizio Colonna\", with other patrizi and captains of the recent Florentine republic: Zanobi Buondelmonti; Battista della Palla; and Luigi Alamanni. Colonna is often assumed to be a veiled disguise for Machiavelli himself, but this view has been challenged by scholars such as Mansfield.\nThe work is dedicated to Lorenzo di Filippo Strozzi, patrizio fiorentino, in a preface that ostentatiously pronounces Machiavelli's authorship. After repeated uses of the first-person singular to introduce the dialogue, Machiavelli retreats from the work, serving as neither narrator nor interlocutor.\nFabrizio is enamored with the Roman Legions of the early to mid Roman Republic and strongly advocates adapting them to the contemporary situation of Renaissance Florence.\nFabrizio dominates the discussions with his knowledge, wisdom, and insights. The other characters, for the most part, simply yield to his superior knowledge and merely bring up topics, ask him questions, or request clarification. These dialogues then often become monologues, with Fabrizio detailing how an army should be raised, trained, organized, deployed, and employed.\nBackground\nMachiavelli's Art of War echoes many themes, issues, ideas and proposals from his earlier, more widely read works, The Prince and The Discourses. Machiavelli had served for fourteen years as secretary to the Chancery of Florence and \"personally observed and reported back to his government on the size, composition, weaponry, morale, and logistical capabilities of the most effective militaries of his day.\" However, the native fighting force he assiduously oversaw was struck a catastrophic defeat in Prato in 1512 which led to the downfall of the Florentine republican government. The work shows influences from Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, the premier strategist and statesman of his age, although it also departs from his doctrine in several aspects.\nCritique\nMachiavelli's basic notion of emulating Roman practices was slowly and pragmatically adapted by many later rulers and commanders, most notably Maurice of Nassauand Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden.\nIn the course of the sixteenth century twenty-one editions appeared, and it was translated into French, English, German, and Latin. Montaigne named Machiavelli next to Caesar, Polybius, and Commynes as an authority on military affairs. Although in the seventeenth century changing military methods brought other writers to the fore, Machiavelli was still frequently quoted. In the eighteenth century, the Marshal de Saxe leaned heavily on him when he composed his Reveries upon the Art of War (1757), and Algarotti—though without much basis—saw in Machiavelli the master who has taught Frederick the Great the tactics by which he astounded Europe. Like most people concerned with military matters, Jefferson had Machiavelli's Art of War in his library, and when the War of 1812 increased American interest in problems of war, The Art of War was brought out in a special American edition.\"\nThemes\nIn the opening pages, after Cosimo has described his grandfather's inspiration for the gardens in which the conversations are set, Fabrizio declaims that we should imitate ancient warfare rather than ancient art forms. However, the Art of War is a dialogue in the humanist tradition of imitating classical forms. Machiavelli himself appears to have fallen into the trap for which Fabrizio criticizes Bernardo Rucellai. Despite this inherent contradiction, the book lacks much of the cynical tone and humour that is so characteristic of Machiavelli's other works.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/500403.html Notable Quotes and Aphorisms from Art Of War]\n* [https://www.britannica.com/biography/Niccolo-Machiavelli The Art of War and other writings]\n* [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15772 Machiavelli's The Art Of War at Project Gutenberg]\n* [https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/cust-the-tudor-translations-machiavelli Tudor Translation (1560 in a 1905 ed.)] and [https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/machiavelli-the-art-of-war-neville-trans Neville Translation (1675)].\n*  (Neville Translation)"
