      "text": "# 1954–55 Philadelphia Warriors season\n\nThe 1954–55 Philadelphia Warriors season was the Warriors' 9th season in the NBA. During a very early portion of the season, the Warriors played a game against the Baltimore Bullets on Halloween in 1954, winning that game 102–97 before the original Bullets team later folded operations early in the season on November 27, 1954; that game they played would ultimately end up being wiped out from the official record books for the NBA's history. If the game they played was officially kept as a part of the season's record for the Warriors, their official record would have had Philadelphia get a losing record of 34–39 instead of 33–39 for their season.\nRoster\nRegular season\nSeason standings\n:x – clinched playoff spot\nGame log\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible\" width=50% style=\"clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
