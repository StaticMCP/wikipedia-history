The awards were first presented in 1999. The ceremonies recognise Irish creative talent working in film, drama, and television, and winners receive a cast bronze statuette.\nHistory\nDubbed by the media as 'The Irish Oscars', the inaugural Irish Film & Television Awards Ceremony took place at the Burlington Hotel (Dublin) in 1999, and was attended by some notable stars such as Ralph Fiennes, Charlize Theron, James Nesbitt, and Andrea Corr. Following growth of the Irish film and television industries, the Academy in 2015 split the Awards into two ceremonies: the IFTA Film & Drama Awards and the IFTA Television Awards, which take place in April and October respectively. The ceremonies recognise Irish creative talent working in film and television. Winners receive a cast bronze statuette.\nCategories\nFilm\n* Best Film\n* Best Director\n* Best Script\n* Best Lead Actor\n* Best Lead Actress\n* Best Supporting Actor\n* Best Supporting Actress\n* Best International Film\n* Best International Actor\n* Best International Actress\n* Rising Star\n* George Morrison Feature Documentary Award\nShort film\n* Best Animated Short\n* Best Short Film\nTelevision drama\n* Best Drama\n* Best Director\n* Best Lead Actor\n* Best Lead Actress\n* Best Supporting Actor\n* Best Supporting Actress\nCraft\n* Best Cinematography\n* Best Editing\n* Best Production Design\n* Best VFX\n* Best Make Up & Hair\n* Best Sound\n* Best Costume\n* Best Original Music\nLifetime Achievement Award\nThe IFTA Lifetime Achievement Award has been presented to:\n* Neil Jordan 2003\n* Maureen O'Hara 2004\n* David Kelly 2005\n* Gay Byrne 2006\n* George Morrison 2009\n* Niall Tóibín 2011\n* Fionnula Flanagan 2012\n*Jim Sheridan 2015\n*Gabriel Byrne 2018\n*Judi Dench 2023\n*Stephen Rea 2024\n*Colm Meaney 2025\nPrevious ceremonies\nhosted the third, fourth and fifth events.]]\nhosted the sixth, seventh and eighth events.]]\nhosted the ninth event.]]\nco-hosted the thirteenth event.]]\nThe following is a listing of all Irish Film Television Awards Ceremonies since its inaugural event in 1999.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Ceremony\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Date\n! style=\"width:250px;\"|Best Film winner\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Host(s)\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Venue\n|-\n|Irish Film & Television Awards\n|28 November 1999\n|The General\n|Marian Finucane\n|RTÉ Studios Dublin\n|-\n|Irish Film & Television Awards\n|6 December 2000\n|''Angela's Ashes\n|Marie Jones\n|The Waterfront, Belfast\n|-\n| 1st Irish Film & Television Awards\n| 1 November 2003\n| Intermission\n| James Nesbitt\n| Burlington Hotel\n|-\n| 2nd Irish Film & Television Awards\n| 30 October 2004\n| Omagh\n| James Nesbitt\n| Burlington Hotel\n|-\n| 3rd Irish Film & Television Awards\n| 5 November 2005\n| Pavee Lackeen\n| James Nesbitt\n| Royal Dublin Society\n|-\n| 4th Irish Film & Television Awards\n| 10 February 2007\n| The Wind That Shakes the Barley\n| Ryan Tubridy\n| Royal Dublin Society\n|-\n| 5th Irish Film & Television Awards\n| 17 February 2008\n| Garage\n| Ryan Tubridy\n| Gaiety Theatre\n|-\n| 6th Irish Film & Television Awards\n| 14 February 2009\n| Hunger\n| Ryan Tubridy\n| Burlington Hotel\n|-\n| 7th Irish Film & Television Awards\n| 20 February 2010\n| The Eclipse\n| Victoria Smurfit\n| Burlington Hotel\n|-\n| 8th Irish Film & Television Awards\n| 12 February 2011\n| As If I Am Not There\n| Simon Delaney\n| Convention Centre\n|-\n| 9th Irish Film & Television Awards\n| 11 February 2012\n| The Guard\n| Simon Delaney\n| Convention Centre\n|-\n| 10th Irish Film & Television Awards\n| 9 February 2013\n| What Richard Did\n| Simon Delaney\n| Convention Centre\n|-\n| 11th Irish Film & Television Awards\n| 5 April 2014\n| Calvary\n| Simon Delaney  Laura Whitmore\n| DoubleTree by Hilton Dublin – Burlington Road\n|-\n| 12th Irish Film & Television Awards\n| 24 May 2015\n| Song of the Sea\n| Caroline Morahan\n| Mansion House\n|-\n| IFTA Gala Television Awards 2015\n| 22 October 2015\n|\n| Amanda Byram\n| DoubleTree by Hilton Dublin – Burlington Road\n|-\n| 13th Irish Film & Television Awards\n| 9 April 2016\n| Room''\n| Deirdre O'Kane\n|  Mansion House\n|-\n| 14th Irish Film & Television Awards\n| 8 April 2017\n| A Date for Mad Mary\n| Deirdre O'Kane\n| Mansion House\n|-\n| 15th Irish Film & Television Awards\n| 15 February 2018\n|  Michael Inside\n| Deirdre O'Kane\n| Mansion House\n|-\n| 16th Irish Film & Television Awards\n| 18 October 2020\n|   Ordinary Love and Black ’47\n|  Deirdre O'Kane\n| Virtual ceremony\n|-\n| 17th Irish Film & Television Awards\n| 4 July 2021\n|   Wolfwalkers\n|  Gráinne Seoige\n| Virtual ceremony\n|-\n| 18th Irish Film & Television Awards\n|12 March 2022\n|  An Cailín Ciúin\n|  Deirdre O'Kane\n| Virtual ceremony\n|-\n|19th Irish Film & Television Awards\n|7 May 2023\n| The Banshees of Inisherin\n|  Deirdre O'Kane\n|Dublin Royal Convention Center\n|-\n|20th Irish Film & Television Awards\n|9 April 2024\n| That They May Face the Rising Sun\n|  Baz Ashmawy\n|Dublin Royal Convention Centre\n|-\n|21st Irish Film & Television Awards\n|14 February 2025\n|Small Things Like These\n|Kevin McGahern\n|Dublin Royal Convention Centre\n|}\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
