The logs used to be transported out of Yilan on the Lanyang River. In 1921, the agency purchased a Taiwan Sugar Railway from the Taiwan Sugar Factory and used it as the Luodong Forest Railway to transport timber.\nIn 1982, the government adjusted its policies on the forestry industry and production from the area started to decline. In 1994–2001, the Third Luodong Township Urban Planning Review designated the area to be a special forestry industry culture site. In 2004, the Forestry Bureau unveiled a plan to turn the area into a culture park. Also in the same year, the Council for Cultural Affairs listed all of the remaining artifacts and buildings in the area as historical assets. The area was then turned into the Luodong Forestry Culture Park in 2009 and listed as a cultural landscape area in 2012.\nGeography\nThe park spans over an area of 16 hectares. It consists of several timber ponds.\nArchitecture\nThe culture park is divided into several areas:\n* art district\n* artifact exhibition hall\n* bamboo railway station\n* primitive habitat\n* storage pool\nTransportation\nThe park is accessible within walking distance north of Luodong Station of Taiwan Railways.\nSee also\n* List of tourist attractions in Taiwan\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
