Two years later, the Russian army had to put the new knowledge into practice during the Russo-Japanese War.\nDuring World War I, radio interference was used to disrupt communications between army, corps, and division headquarters, as well as between warships. Conventional radio communications were used to create interference, and only the German army had special radio interference stations.\nOn December 15, 1942, the first specialized electronic warfare units were created within the Red Army. The reason for their appearance was a memo from Lavrentiy Beria, sent to Stalin.\nThe first means of radio interference (dipole and angle radio reflectors, training jamming transmitters) of industrial production entered the army use by 1950. During 1950s a special electronic warfare service was being created in the Soviet army.\nAccording to a study by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), Russia has increased the effectiveness of its electronic warfare forces during the armed conflict in Ukraine. Its electronic warfare systems were mainly focused on the destruction of unmanned aerial vehicles and were located every ten kilometers of the front. This allowed Russian electronic warfare forces to destroy about 10,000 Ukrainian drones per month. It is also noted that the means of electronic warfare of the Russian Federation, apparently, were able to intercept and decode 256-bit encryption of the enemy's Motorola walkie-talkies.\nStructure\nThe electronic warfare troops of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are organizationally composed of formations and military units of Combat arms of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, military districts, as well as a set of formations and military units of electronic warfare of central subordination.\nLeadership\nThe central body of EW troops the Office of the Chief of the Electronic Warfare Troops of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.
