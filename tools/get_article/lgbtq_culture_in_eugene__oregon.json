Even though Eugene has been rated on lists of cities friendly to LGBT populations, there are very few venues specifically for the LGBTQ community in the Eugene/Springfield metropolitan area.\nLGBT pride festival\nSince 1993, committee volunteers have organized the Eugene Pride each year in August, rather than in June, \"which is Pride Month, but you know that unique Eugene thing: We're different,\" according to the town's alternative newspaper. \"Plus, we're too busy at the pride celebrations of the city to the north  in June. So: We're later, we're smaller, but we're still proud.\" The festival is supported by sponsorships and volunteer help.\nHistory highlights\n* 1969 - UO's Gay Peoples Alliance forms\n* 1974 - UO's Pride Week organized\n* 1975 - Lane County hotspots: Mother Kali's\n* 1978 - Ordinance banning discrimination against LGBT repealed in Eugene\n* 1983 - Lane County hotspots: Club Arena\n* 1992 - Springfield anti-gay Ballot Measure 20-08 passes\n* 1994 - Statewide anti-gay Measure 9 fails\n* 1993 - Eugene/Springfield Pride Festival location: Amazon Park, Eugene\n* 1994 - Citizens United Against Discrimination forms in Lane County,\n* 1994 - Statewide Anti-gay Measure 13 fails\n* 1994 through 2000 Eugene/Springfield Pride Festival location: Maurie Jacobs Park, Eugene\n* 2001 though 2013 - Eugene/Springfield Pride Festival location: Alton Baker Park, Eugene\n* 2010 - Gay in the Park location: Washington Jefferson Park, Eugene\nSource: EugenePride.org\nRecreation and social activities\nA dedicated LGBTQ space, \"The Wayward Lamb\" opened in August 2015. Calling itself \"Eugene's Official Queer Pub\", the venue also offered a private event space and \"unique dedicated queer programming\". Citing the expectation that it was \"a de facto LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer) community center as well as a bar\", the owner closed the bar in February 2018. The space re-opened as Spectrum in the summer of 2018 as a re-branded queer bar under new management offering a quiet reading room and southern-inspired dining in addition to the usual drag shows, lip-synch battles, and debauchery.\nA variety of other LGBTQ social, political, and support groups meet in Eugene:\n* Eugene Interweave is a church-supported group \"dedicated to the spiritual, political, and social well being of gay Unitarian Universalists, allies, friends, and community\". The group sponsors a potluck and film on the second Friday each month.\n* Imperial Sovereign Court of the Emerald Empire is a non-profit social and community service organization hosting performances and activities to raise funds for local community charities and services.\n* The Broadway Revue Burlesque Show performs every Sunday evening at Luckeys Club Cigar Store, one of the oldest businesses in downtown Eugene.\n* Rain BoWomen meet twice monthly for dinner at restaurants in the Eugene/Springfield area.\n* Soromundi Lesbian Chorus of Eugene  (\"sisters of the world\") is a non-audition choir open to all women, celebrating themselves and community as \"a visible expression of lesbian pride\".\nAdditional local resources are listed by the University of Oregon on the UOUT site.\nSee also\n* Eugene Local Measure 51\nReferences\nSources\n* [http://www.kval.com/news/local/Eugene-makes-list-of-Americas-most-gay-friendly-cities-137137748.html Eugene makes list of America's most gay friendly cities].
