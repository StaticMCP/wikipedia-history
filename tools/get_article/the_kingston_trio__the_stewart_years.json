It contains 286 songs, many of them are previously unissued and live tracks. The set includes a  hardcover book containing photos and stories of the group, recording sessions, and notes on the songs.\nReception\n}}\nAllmusic critic Greg Adams was equivocal about the extent of the package, writing: \"The Stewart Years is a gorgeous ten-disc box set with hardbound book that collects everything the Trio recorded during Stewart's tenure... The Stewart version of the trio was more pop-oriented, political, and experimental (some unsuccessful attempts at folk-rock are preserved for posterity here). While they had their successes... their clean-cut collegiate image could never quite adapt to the counterculture and protest folk movement... The Stewart Years is a beautiful, comprehensive, and expensive artifact suitable for libraries and affluent fans.\"\nPersonnel\n*Bob Shane – vocals, guitar, banjo\n*Nick Reynolds – vocals, tenor guitar, bongos, conga\n*John Stewart – vocals, banjo, guitar, harmonica\n*Dean Reilly – bass\n*Glen Campbell – banjo, guitar\n*John Staubard – guitar\n*Andy Belling – organ\n*George Callender – bass\n*Randy Cierley – guitar, percussion\n*Irving Cottler – drums\n*John Chambers – drums\n*Jerry Granelli – drums\n*Modesto Duran – percussion\n*Harold Hensley – fiddle\n*Jack Marshall – guitar\n*Allan Reuss – guitar\n*Manuel Stevens – trumpet\n*Anthony Terran – trumpet\n*John Rotella – reeds\n*Art Smith – reeds\n*Ben Kanter – reeds\n*William Hinshaw – French horn\n*Darrel Terwilliger – violin\n*Tibor Zelig – violin\n*Leonard Malarsky – violin\n*Sidney Sharp – violin\n*Myron Sandler – viola\n*Harry Hyams – viola\n*Alexander Neiman – viola\n*Joseph DiFiore – viola\n*Emmet Sargeant – cello\n*Jimmie Haskell  – arranger, leader\nProduction notes\n*Voyle Gilmore – producer\n*Frank Werber – producer\n*Paul Surratt – reissue producer, photography, illustrations\n*Adam Skeaping – mastering\n*Jay Ranellucci – mixing\n*Richard Weize – tape research, discography\n*R.
