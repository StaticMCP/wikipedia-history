The award was initiated in 2003, within the framework of the United Nations World Summit on the Information Society. After the UN General Assembly adopted  Resolution 56/183.  The awards are open to companies, organizations, or individuals from any of the UN and the UNESCO Member States. They are divided into 8 different categories.  The world summit awards are managed by the International Center for New Media (ICNM), a non-profit organization based in Salzburg, Austria. ICNM was founded by Peter A. Bruck, in 2002.\nHistory\nWSA History\nFollowing a proposal by the Government of Tunisia, the International Telecommunication Union, adopted Resolution 73 (Minneapolis, 1998), in the Plenipotentiary Conference, in Minneapolis 1998, held on October 12–6 November. Resolution 73 asked the Council to deliberate on the ITU's contribution to holding the Summit, with the following goals:\n1) establishing an overall framework identifying a joint understanding of the information society;  2) drawing a strategic plan of action and 3) identifying the role of various partners to ensure coordination in all Member States. It also requested the Secretary - General to coordinate with the international organizations and other international actors, and called for measures specifically designed to improve and strengthen the presence of the union in diverse regions[2]. The United Nations General Assembly on 21 December 2001, adopted resolution 56/183, endorsing the holding of a World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), with the goal(link[3]). The Resolution dictated that the WSIS would be held in two phases[4].  The first phase of WSIS, took place in 2003 in Geneva, Switzerland, from 10 to 12 December. And the second phase of WSIS, was set in Tunis, from 16 to 18 November 2005.\nWSIS Follow-up was carried out by ECOSOC in the resolution 2006/46, on July 28, 2006, titled \"Follow-up to the World Summit on the Information Society and review of the Commission on Science and Technology for Development\". This Resolution is placed within the context of the annual consideration by ECOSOC. It states its responsibilities in Article 2 on the follow-up[5]. ECOSOC decided to appoint the Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD) as an assistant Commission to the Council, and was established to be the focal point of the system-wide follow-up of WSIS. To this end, the ITU and its partners, organize a WSIS Forum, located in Geneva, every year. To this day, the World Summit Award participates in workshops and exhibitions in order to demonstrate: \"the richness and diversity of e-Content globally\". The overall Review of the execution of the Implementation of the Outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society, was held in 2015 by the UN General Assembly, which adopted Resolution A/70/125 (which called for the alignment between the WSIS process and 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development).\nFirst phase of the summit: Geneva\nIn Geneva in 2003, more than 11,000 participants from over 175 countries attended. The Declaration of Principles makes reference to the challenge of harnessing the potential of information and communication, as well as recognizes that \"Connectivity is a central enabling agent in building the Information Society\" (Declaration of Principles Geneva .B2.21). The Government of the Republic of Austria decided to entrust the global challenge of the Information Society of the UN Agenda to the International Center for New Media and its honorary chairman Prof. Dr. Peter A. Bruck. to launch the World Summit Award.  Therefore, the World Summit Award was thought to present to the UN States and delegates on the diversity and creative use of ICTs.\nFirst Edition WSA\nThe first edition of the World Summit Awards was in 2003. The World Summit on the Information Society was introduced by the UN. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and the first winners of the World Summit Awards were awarded in 2003.  136 UN Member States participated in this edition with 803 e-content applications.
