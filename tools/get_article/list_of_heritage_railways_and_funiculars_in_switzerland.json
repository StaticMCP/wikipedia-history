      "text": "# List of heritage railways and funiculars in Switzerland\n\n]]\nThis is a list of heritage railways in Switzerland. For convenience, the list includes any pre-World War II railway in the large sense of the term (either adhesion railway, rack railway or funicular) currently operated with at least several original or historical carriages.\nSwitzerland has a very dense rail network, both standard and narrow gauge. The overwhelming majority of railways, built between the mid-19th and early 20th century, are still in regular operation today and were electrified earlier than in the rest of Europe. The major exception is the partially rack and pinion-operated Furka Steam Railway, the longest unelectrified line in the country. However, numerous rail operators, notably SBB Historic, provide services with well-maintained historical rolling stock.\nList\n*Blonay–Chamby museum railway (adhesion)\n*Brienz Rothorn Railway (rack)\n*Dampfbahn-Verein Zürcher Oberland (adhesion)\n*Etzwilen–Singen railway (adhesion)\n* (funicular)\n*Furka Steam Railway (rack and adhesion)\n* (adhesion)\n*Giessbachbahn (funicular)\n*Heimwehfluhbahn (funicular)\n*International Rhine Regulation Railway (adhesion)\n*La Traction (adhesion)\n*Les Avants–Sonloup (funicular)\n*Montreux–Glion–Rochers-de-Naye railway (rack)\n*Montreux–Lenk im Simmental line (adhesion)\n* (adhesion)\n*Pilatus Railway (rack)\n*Reichenbachfall Funicular\n*Rhaetian Railway, notably on the Albula and Bernina lines (adhesion)\n*Riffelalp tram (adhesion)\n*Rigi Railways (rack)\n*Rorschach–Heiden railway (rack)\n*SBB Historic (adhesion)\n* (adhesion)\n*Schynige Platte Railway (rack)\n*Sonnenberg (funicular)\n* (funicular)\n*Vapeur Val-de-Travers (adhesion)\n* (adhesion)\n*Zürcher Museums-Bahn (adhesion)\nSee also\n*List of railway museums in Switzerland\n*List of narrow-gauge railways in Switzerland\n*List of mountain railways in Switzerland\n*List of funiculars in Switzerland\n*Lists of tourist attractions in Switzerland\n*Swiss Museum of Transport ()\nReferences"
