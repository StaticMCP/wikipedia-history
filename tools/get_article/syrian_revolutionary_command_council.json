The signatories represent both secular and Islamist groups; however al-Qaeda's al-Nusra Front and some of its allies were excluded. Initially Ahrar ash-Sham was also excluded, however the group did join the alliance in mid August 2014. The group announced its charter on 4 October 2014. It held its first formal meeting in Gaziantep, Turkey on 29 November 2014.\nConflict within the coalition\nImmediately following the first formal meeting of the Syrian Revolutionary Command Council, Col. Muhammad Hallak expressed skepticism toward the October document on which the new group is based, saying it was written to ensure an Islamic government after Assad is toppled. Col. Hallak was quoted as saying: “The covenant itself doesn't mention the idea of free elections and most of the groups represented in the executive office don’t believe in the original democratic values of the revolution\".\nIn early December 2014, the Hazzm Movement withdrew its affiliation from the Syrian Revolutionary Command Council as a result of clashes between it and the al-Nusra Front in Syria. In the same time period, the southern branch of the Syria Revolutionaries Front declared that they have no connection to the Syrian Revolutionary Command Council. The Hazzm Movement and the Syria Revolutionaries Front had been routed in the northern province of Idlib by al-Nusra Front and its allies in November.\nAs of late 2015, the council is no longer active.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3z9-p6YAL2kpFE4ZQe8zIw Syrian Revolutionary Command Council YouTube Channel] (most recent post 24 June 2015)\n* [https://twitter.com/SyrianRCC Syrian Revolutionary Command Council Twitter account] (most recent post 29 October 2015)"
