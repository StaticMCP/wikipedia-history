Under the constitution, ministers in the Legislative Assembly were required to resign to recontest their seats in a by-election when appointed. Such ministerial by-elections were usually uncontested and on this occasion a poll was required for Bathurst and Redfern where Arthur Renwick was re-elected. The 7 other ministers were re-elected unopposed.\nDates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Date !!
