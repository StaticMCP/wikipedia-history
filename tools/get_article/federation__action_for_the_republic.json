It is considered a radical opposition party and is led by Ngarlejy Yorongar. The FAR supports federalism.\nIn the 1997 parliamentary election, the FAR won one seat in the National Assembly. Yorongar was the only FAR candidate to win a seat.\nIts candidate for the 20 May 2001 presidential election, Yorongar, was a prominent critic of the Chad-Cameroon pipeline. According to official results, he won 396,864 votes, or 6.35%. Six opposition candidates were detained on May 30 after contesting the results. Yorongar, along with fellow opposition leader Abderhamane Djesnebaye, was tortured, including by being beaten with iron bars.\nIn the 2002 parliamentary election, the party won 10 out of 155 seats.\nThe party boycotted the 2006 presidential election.\nThe FAR was the only major opposition party to not sign a 2007 agreement that provided for improved electoral organization ahead of the next parliamentary election. Yorongar criticized the agreement as inadequate and said that there should instead be a dialogue involving the entire political scene, including rebels, the exiled opposition, and civil society, and that a credible election could not be conducted while a rebellion was taking place in part of the country.\nReferences"
