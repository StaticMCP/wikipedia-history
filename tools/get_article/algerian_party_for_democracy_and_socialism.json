When in 1993, during the Algerian Civil War, Ettehadi was realigned as a democratic movement resisting Islamism, the Marxist–Leninist wing split apart under the leadership of Abdelhamid Benzine to retain its Marxist–Leninist legacy.\nPADS publishes the newspaper Le Lien des Ouvriers et Paysans (The Link of the Workers and Peasants).\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n\n---\n\n## Algerian party for democracy and socialism\n\n#REDIRECT Algerian Party for Democracy and Socialism"
