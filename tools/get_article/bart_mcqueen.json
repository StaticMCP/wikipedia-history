He first appeared onscreen at his stepmother's funeral in August 2010, introduced by producer Paul Marquess as a member of the McQueen family. During his time on the show, Bart had been involved in: relationships with Jason Costello (Victoria Atkin) and Sinead O'Connor (Stephanie Davis), being stabbed during the third series of Hollyoaks Later, his involvement in Esther Bloom's (Jazmine Franks) bullying storyline, causing the bus crash featuring in the notable Enjoy the Ride storyline, and falling off the rails with a growing cannabis habit.\nClarke and Andrew Still (who plays Joel Dexter) left their roles in December 2012, but their departures remained unannounced until the episode aired. They left on 9 January 2013 when they went on the run. Bart's reintroduction was announced on 26 January 2017 and Clarke expressed his delight at reprising the role. Bart returned on 13 February 2017 and departed on 13 April 2017, at the conclusion of the guest stint.\nCharacter creation\nDetails of the character first came to attention during an interview with producer Paul Marquess in April 2010. Marquess introduced several new characters in 2010 when he took over from Lucy Allan as series producer. Speculation grew over the McQueen family, due to the axing of many other characters. However, Marquess stated: \"They're definitely staying! In fact, we're bringing in a new McQueen, who will change the dynamic of the family quite considerably.\nIn another interview, Marquess revealed that the character was named after Bart Simpson, the mischievous character from American cartoon The Simpsons and also described him as a \"ladies' man\". It was announced in June 2010 that Jonny Clarke had been cast as Bart. This was also announced at the same time as fellow characters Brendan Brady and Lynsey Nolan. Paul Marquess spoke of the characters' introductions, saying: \"This is a really exciting time for Hollyoaks and Brendan, Lynsey and Bart bring more fun, drama and sexiness to the show.\" Clarke has described Bart as a \"lad's lad\". Clarke revealed in July 2012 that he plans to be a rock star if his career in Hollyoaks fails.\nCharacter development\nIn April 2012, Bart becomes involved with \"bad boy\" Joel Dexter (Andrew Still) and he forces Bart to grow cannabis plants. Clarke told a writer from Inside Soap that he is forced to show his girlfriend Sinead O'Connor (Stephanie Davis) what he is up to. Sinead is angered by his involvement; while Bart himself realises that he is out of his depth. Clarke explained that his character does not know what he has agreed to do. When the plants arrive; Bart \"puts on a front\" and pretends to be \"completely cool\" with the situation. However, he is left feeling \"unnerved\" and faces the prospect of Myra discovering the truth when his usage of heat lamps cause her electricity bill to rise.\nThe police later discover Bart's cannabis farm and arrest most of the McQueen family. However, Bart does not attempt to clear their name and asks Sinead to run away with him.\nDeparture\nThe first look airing of the episode airing on 8 January 2013 saw Bart and Joel Dexter (Andrew Still) go on the run from Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan) after he threatened both of them, but not before Bart said a final farewell to Sinead. The episode also saw Esther Bloom (Jazmine Franks) change her statement, which now left Bart in danger with the police. Clarke had filmed his final scenes in December 2012, after three years with the show. Clarke commented on his departure: \"Hollyoaks has been a great stepping stone in my career, and leaving the show is one of the hardest decisions I've had to make so far. I believe I am at a great age to progress my career further. I am excited to see what the future brings. I hope to be involved in films and some period dramas. I would like to thank my family for their support and would also like to thank all my fans for all the great comments and good wishes they have sent me for my future career.\"\nReturn\nOn 26 January 2017, it was announced that Clarke had reprised the role. His character will return alongside Nana McQueen (Diane Langton) for Celine McQueen's (Sarah George) funeral. Teasing Bart's new storylines, Clarke said \"I'm so happy to be back at Hollyoaks. I can't wait for people to see the way Bart has changed since the last time he was in the village. He's definitely going to ruffle a few feathers with a sinister secret!\" Bart returned on 13 February 2017.
