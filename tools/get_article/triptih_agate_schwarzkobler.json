It was first published in 1968. The book is considered a fundamental work of Slovenian modernist prose, exploring existential questions about the individual's place in a cold, bureaucratic society. Slovene Studies noted the \"powerlessness of the modern subject\", saying that the main character Agata is \"treated as an object.\" Šeligo's writing style in the novel is known as \"Reism,\" a technique that was new and experimental at the time of its publication, sparking numerous debates and studies.\nPlot\nThe central figure is Agata, employed as a secretary in an office environment. She is introduced alongside her colleagues, who share her polished and pleasant demeanor, as well as her supervisor, whose behavior hints at indulgence in sensual distractions. The narrative provides a detailed depiction of her workplace and daily routine, including a lunch break. 'Agata appears disengaged, often diverting her attention to the view outside, swatting at insects, and daydreaming about chasing imaginary creatures, while her coworkers briefly pursue a stray red balloon that enters the office.' Once the balloon pops, the group resumes their tasks. After her shift ends, Agata heads to a store to purchase veal steaks.\nThe story shifts to Agata’s encounter with Yuri, whom she accompanies to a cinema outing. During the film, Yuri’s excitement escalates, leading to unwanted physical advances that grow increasingly aggressive, prompting Agata to flee the theater. She seeks refuge in a self-service restaurant, waiting until she is certain Yuri is no longer in pursuit before continuing her escape. A stranger, distinctly not Yuri, intercepts her, mistakenly assuming she is involved in prostitution. They drive out of the city along a wooded route, park, and proceed on foot to the Sava River’s edge. At a secluded spot, the man threatens her and delivers a slap, then pauses to let her reflect, after which she reluctantly complies. The ensuing encounter leaves Agata emotionally detached, her gaze fixed on distant scenery, including a fragrant plant. 'The man concludes by presenting her with a gold bracelet adorned with a heart-shaped pendant, claiming it was his mother’s heirloom.'\nThe narrative moves to nighttime, where Agata finds herself in an abandoned building near a tower. After consuming two pills, she experiences a state of shock and temporary loss of bodily control, lying motionless for hours. Upon regaining consciousness, she mends her torn muslin dress and adjusts her hair. 'This recovery symbolizes her effort to restore order after a traumatic night.' As dawn breaks, she prepares herself for the day ahead.\nThe characters\nAgata Little is known of Agata’s background, aside from a past visit to a church in Germany. She presents as a refined woman with black hair neatly secured in a bun, held firm with Elnett hairspray. Her attire includes a white muslin dress and black Diemme shoes. She holds a position as an office secretary and is in a relationship with Yuri. 'There are suggestions she might have been involved with a colleague named Kalan.'\nYuri Yuri is likely Agata’s partner, though his choice of back-row seats during their cinema visit hints at undisclosed intentions.\nStranger This character is an unappealing man with a military-like posture, dressed in a dark gray suit, and identified as someone other than Yuri. 'He is noted for wearing a gold bracelet with a heart-shaped pendant.'\nSee also\n*List of Slovenian novels\nReferences"
