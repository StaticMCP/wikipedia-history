Somoza made one attempt to see him, but Irias was drunk and nothing was accomplished”.\nOn 9 June the Congress unanimously accepted the resignations of the President Juan Bautista Sacasa and Vice President Rodolfo Espinosa Ramírez and unanimously selected Somoza’s choice as Provisional President, Carlos Alberto Brenes Jarquín. “The Conservatives in Congress justified their vote by saying they were interested in a peaceful solution to the present crisis but that they wanted to be known as the party of opposition and reserved the right to name a candidate in the presidential elections”.\n“All relatives of incumbent presidents were forbidden by the constitution from standing for office for a period of six months. Somoza, as the husband of ex-President Sacasa’s niece, came into this category. Somoza sorted out this problem by having the elections put back from November to December''”.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Barquero, Sara L. Gobernantes de Nicaragua, 1825-1947.
