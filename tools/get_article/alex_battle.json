Battle previously appeared in the Football League for Plymouth Argyle and Crawley Town.\nEarly life\nBattle was born in Plymouth.\nCareer\nPlymouth Argyle\nOn 9 November 2017 Battle joined Southern Football League side Salisbury on a youth loan, but had his loan cut short when he was forced to return to Argyle just a month later for treatment on a knee injury that he sustained during a 4–3 defeat to Larkhall Athletic. Battle made his EFL League One debut for Argyle as a substitute in a 5–2 defeat away to Gillingham on 5 May 2018, the last day of the 2017–18 season. Battle was sent on in the 79th minute for Jamaican international Joel Grant. Battle was one of five academy players on the bench for Argyle that game, alongside Cameron Sangster, Klaidi Lolos, Ryan Law and Dan Rooney.\nOn 17 July 2018, it was reported that Battle had turned down an offer of an extended contract from Argyle, and was training with Bolton Wanderers, a club he had trained with previously. However, with Bolton already in a dispute with their current players over unpaid wages, the Trotters were unable to agree a youth compensation fee with Argyle. On 23 July 2018 it was reported that Battle had agreed a professional contract with Plymouth Argyle.\nTruro City\nOn 4 January 2019, Battle joined National League South side Truro City on loan until the end of the season, joining up with Jordan Bentley and Dan Rooney, two fellow Argyle loanees. He was released by Plymouth Argyle at the end of the 2018–19 season. In September 2019, he joined Truro City on a permanent deal. In May 2020, his contract at the club was extended for the 2020–21 season.\nCrawley Town\nOn 4 September 2021, Battle signed for EFL League Two club Crawley Town on a one-year deal with the option for a further year following a trial at the club. He made his debut for the club later that day as a substitute in a 1–0 defeat away to Bristol Rovers. On 3 December 2021, Battle joined Isthmian League South East Division side East Grinstead Town on a 28-day loan deal. His loan was later extended to 29 January. On 1 February 2022, Battle rejoined former club Truro City on loan for the remainder of the 2021–22 season.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|EFL Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Other\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Plymouth Argyle\n|2017–18\n|EFL League One\n|1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0\n|-\n|2018–19\n|EFL League One\n|0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0||1||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!1!!0!!2!!0\n|-\n|Salisbury (loan)\n|2017–18\n|Southern League West Division\n|3||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||2||0||5||0\n|-\n|Truro City (loan)\n|2018–19\n|National League South\n|8||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||1||0||9||1\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Truro City\n|2019–20\n|Southern League Premier Division South\n|18||3||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||4||1||22||4\n|-\n|2020–21\n|Southern League Premier Division South\n|8||2||4||2||colspan=\"2\"|—||2||1||14||5\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!26!!5!!4!!2!!0!!0!!6!!2!!36!!9\n|-\n|Crawley Town\n|2021–22\n|EFL League Two\n|1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|Total\n!39!!6!!4!!2!!0!!0!!10!!2!!53!!10\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.trurocityfc.net/teams/83206/player/alex-battle-2161185 Profile] on Truro City website"
