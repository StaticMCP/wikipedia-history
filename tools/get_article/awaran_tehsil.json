Healthcare facilities are sparse, typically consisting of small basic health units or dispensaries with limited staff and equipment. Residents frequently travel to larger towns or cities for specialised medical care.\nTelecommunications coverage has improved with the installation of cellular networks, though signal strength and internet access vary across the tehsil. Educational infrastructure consists primarily of primary and middle schools, with a few secondary institutions concentrated in Awaran town. The shortage of qualified teachers and school facilities further contributes to low literacy rates, especially in rural areas.\nSee also\n* Tehsils of Pakistan\n* Tehsils of Balochistan\nReferences and notes\nExplanatory notes\nReferences"
