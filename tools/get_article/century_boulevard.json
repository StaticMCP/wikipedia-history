Century Boulevard acts as a continuation of Tweedy Boulevard at Alameda Street in South Gate in its east end (Tweedy Boulevard in its east end starts slightly east of Atlantic Avenue), and ends in the west at the passenger terminals at Los Angeles International Airport. Due to its correspondence with the airport, the road has been dubbed \"The Gateway to Los Angeles\".\nRoute Description\nCentury Boulevard passes through Watts, Harbor Gateway, South Los Angeles, Inglewood, and Westchester. Upon its connection to the LAX terminal loop, Century Boulevard becomes World Way North, and upon leaving LAX it originates from World Way South.\nThe grid plan of Los Angeles and its numbering of east–west thoroughfares would call for a 100th Street in the position of Century Boulevard, thus spawning the more colloquial title.\nCentury Boulevard marks the southern border for Jesse Owens Park, the Hollywood Park Casino, SoFi Stadium and the Hollywood Park development, and The Village at Century strip mall in Inglewood.\nPublic transit\nMetro Local Line 117 operates on Century Boulevard.\nAviation/Century station is an elevated Los Angeles Metro Rail station located at the intersection of Aviation and Century boulevards that opened on November 3, 2024, serving the C and K lines.\nFuture Developments\nPotential Redevelopment\nLos Angeles officials have expressed a desire to renovate Century Boulevard. In November 2017, city planners published a concept draft that outlined the potential renovation of 1.5 miles of the thoroughfare near LAX in order to modernize the area and to make the route more pedestrian-friendly. The project would potentially see the widening of sidewalks and bike lanes, the addition of new trees and landscaping, and the renovation of structures considered unsightly.\nReferences"
