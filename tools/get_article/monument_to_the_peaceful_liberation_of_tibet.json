It celebrates what the People's Republic of China calls the \"Peaceful Liberation of Tibet\" by the People's Liberation Army, or what the exiled Tibetan government calls the invasion and annexation of Tibet. The foundation stone was laid on July 18, 2001 by Hu Jintao, China's vice-president at the time. The monument was unveiled on May 22, 2002.\nStructure\nThe US $1.7 million, 37-meter-high spire-like concrete structure was designed by Professor Qi Kang of the Southeast University in Nanjing, China. The monument abstractly portrays Mount Everest. The monument bears its own name engraved in the calligraphy of former general secretary and president Jiang Zemin, while an inscription refers to the expelling of \"imperialist\" forces from Tibet in 1951 (a reference to long-running Anglo-Russian Great-Game designs on the region) and reports on the socio-economic development achieved since then.\nThe southern side of the monument is inscribed with an inscription in both Tibetan and Chinese characters, of which the Chinese is as follows:\nOn the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet, we would like to erect this monument to commemorate the martyrs and show them to future generations.\nTibet Autonomous Region People's Government\nJuly 18, 2001 A.D.}}\nGallery\nImage:Tibet lhasa liberation monument detail1.jpg|Left group of statues outside the memorial\nImage:Tibet lhasa liberation monument.jpg|The spire-like Mount Quomolongma (Everest)\nImage:Tibet lhasa liberation monument detail2.jpg|Right group of statues outside the memorial\nSee also\n*History of Tibet (1950–present)\n*Tibet (1912–1951)\nReferences"
