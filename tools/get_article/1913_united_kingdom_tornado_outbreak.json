The most notable tornadoes occurred in South Wales, where at least two tornadoes had winds of at least . This is equal to an F3 on the Fujita scale. One of the tornadoes, at Edwardsville, Merthyr Tydfil, resulted in 6 deaths and hundreds of injuries. This is the deadliest-known tornado to occur in the United Kingdom. Other notable tornadoes struck in Cheshire and Shropshire.\nMeteorological background\nA rapidly deepening low-pressure extratropical cyclone tracked quickly south on the afternoon of 27 October. The central pressure of the system was  at midnight on the 27th, deepening to  by 18:00. The low pressure helped to sustain a stream of strong southerly winds, as in days previous, sustaining significantly warmer than average conditions. Temperatures were widely reported over  in some places. Active weather fronts arriving from the Atlantic Ocean resulted in the instability needed to cause such tornadoes. The low pressure brought cooler air to the country by the 31st.\nTornadoes\nMost intense tornadoes\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" width=\"100%\"\n!colspan=\"8\"|Most intense tornadoes - Monday 27 October 1913\n|-\n!
