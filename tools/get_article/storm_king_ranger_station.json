The ranger station is part of the Olympic National Park. The station was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.\nThe building was remodeled in 1937 and in 1979 the east wall and chimney were destroyed when a tractor loader broke loose and hit the building. In 1984 the building was relocated a short distance away from the Olympic Highway (SR-101) and the shore of Lake Crescent, and extensive deterioration was found in many of the exterior logs which were completely restored.\nThe building is significant also for its connection with Chris Morgenroth, an early Bogachiel River settler and one of the first Forest Service Rangers in Olympic Peninsula, who became district ranger of the Olympic National Forest and an advocate for the creation of the Olympic National Park.\nFile:Storm King Ranger Station in winter.JPG|Storm King Ranger Station in winter\nFile:MountStormKingRangerStation (cropped).jpg|Storm King Ranger Station in 2010\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
