Held over three days, the festival features jousting, falconry, knights battles, medieval camping, traditional and modern folk music, medieval banqueting, re-enactments, battles, horses, theatre, crafts, workshops, shopping, medieval food, drink and real ale.\nThe first medieval festival was held at Herstmonceux Castle in 1993 as a celebration of the new ownership by Queen's University, and received several hundred guests. Later festivals have been attended by audiences of several thousand.\nEngland's Medieval Festival celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2017 supported by local and national societies including The Archers of Herstmonceux Castle, the Medieval Siege Society re-enactment group, Sussex Falconry and the Pentacle Drummers.\nIn 2022, the Festival was cancelled due to the Castle's owners withdrawing permission for its use.\nIn 2023, the festival returned at a new location of The Kings Grove, Pippingford Park, Nutley.\nSee also\n* Renaissance fair\n* List of Renaissance and Medieval fairs\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
