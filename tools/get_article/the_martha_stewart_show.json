The series premiered on September 12, 2005, in syndication until it was picked up by the Hallmark Channel in September 2010 as part of a larger deal that turned over most of the cable network's daytime schedule to shows from Stewart's production company, MSLO Productions. It followed her previous syndicated show Martha Stewart Living that ran from 1993–2004.  Unlike the previous show, Martha  was taped before a studio audience at the Chelsea Studios in New York City, New York. It was distributed by NBC Universal Television Distribution in partnership with MSLO Productions. The series' production company came to a consensus with Hallmark to end Martha due to the rising costs. The last episode was shot on April 24, 2012, with it airing on May 11, 2012.\nSynopsis\nEach episode includes several segments related to cooking, crafts, gardening, interior design, and other topics related to arts and crafts. The program also features celebrity guests.\nProduction\nIn October 2024, Stewart voiced dissatisfaction with the show. According to Stewart, \"Mark Burnett wanted a talk show with variety guests, and I really wanted my old format of 'how-to'\".\nBroadcast history and release\nThe syndicated broadcasts aired Monday through Friday at various times on broadcasting markets. Reruns also aired on Fine Living Network prior to the channels transformation into the Cooking Channel. On Hallmark, the series also aired Monday through Friday but at the same time of 10:00 am EST.\nOn January 4, 2012, Hallmark announced that the show was canceled.\nReception\nAwards and nominations\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:99%;\"\n|+\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:12%;\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2%;\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:22%;\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:22%;\"| Nominee(s)\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4%;\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2%;\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| Daytime Emmy Awards\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"| 2006\n| Outstanding Service Show\n| Martha\n|\n| style=text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n| Outstanding Service Show Host\n| Martha Stewart\n|\n| style=text-align:center;\"|\n|}\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
