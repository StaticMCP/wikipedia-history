The process was intended to unify the coalition and determine a viable candidate to compete against a divided but electorally strong right-wing opposition.\nElection\nThe primary was officially registered with Chile's Electoral Service (Servel) on 30 April 2025, the last day political parties and coalitions were allowed to declare their candidates. The official campaign period began immediately, with public and online advertising permitted starting 30 May. Televised campaign spots began airing on 11 June. All campaigning ended at midnight on 26 June, followed by a mandatory blackout period and a ban on political events starting 27 June. The Armed Forces took over responsibility for maintaining public order at polling stations on 28 June, ahead of the vote held on 29 June 2025.\nCandidates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Candidate\n!Endorsement\n!Ideology\n!Ref.\n|-\n|Gonzalo Winter\nBroad Front\n| Broad Front\n|Democratic socialism\nProgressivism\n|\n|-\n|Jeannette Jara\nCommunist Party\n|\n* Communist Party\n* Humanist Action\n* Christian Left\n|Marxism-Leninism\nDemocratic socialism\n|\n|-\n|Carolina Tohá\nParty for Democracy\n| Democratic Socialism:\n*  Party for Democracy\n*  Liberal Party\n*  Radical Party\n*  Socialist Party\n|Social democracy\nSocial liberalism\n|\n|-\n|Jaime Mulet\nSocial Green Regionalist Federation\n| Social Green Regionalist Federation\n|Green politics\nRegionalism\n|\n|}\nPrimary results\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
