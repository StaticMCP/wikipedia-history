The Polish army, led by Prince John I Albert, defeated a 5000-strong Tatar Chambul dispatched by the Ottomans against the Crown. About 1,500 Tatars were killed, and many more were taken prisoner.\nPrelude\nIn 1485, the Ottoman Empire seized the ports of Chilia and Cetatea Albă, which belonged to Moldavia. The Moldavian Hospodar Stephen the Great who was a Polish vassal asked the Polish king for help. King Casimir IV Jagiellon assembled an army and set out for the Moldavian border. The combined Polish-Moldavian army set off after the enemy having reached Chilia they defeated the Ottoman army in battle. However, the Ottoman Sultan did not want to give up Moldavia and already in 1487 sent a Tatar chambul of 5,000 men towards the Polish border.\nThe Polish army was led by Prince John I Albert.\nThe battle\nHaving crushed the Tatars, Albert retreated back to Kopystrzyń. There, meanwhile, a second, smaller Tatar detachment had already arrived. The Tatars realized the weakness of the Polish guard and seized the camp without difficulty. Convinced that the Poles had escaped, they divided their prey among themselves and began to enjoy the liquor they found in the tents. At this point Olbracht arrived with his army and unexpectedly struck at the feasting enemy from the march. Nearly 2,000 Tatars fell or were taken prisoner.\nAftermath\nAfter the battle, on the orders of John I Albert, the leader of the Tatars was captured and beheaded.\nFurther reading\n* Mała Encyklopedia Wojskowa, Wydawnictwo Ministerstwa Obrony Narodowej, Warszawa 1967, Wydanie I, Tom II\n* Marek Plewczyński: \"Wojny Jagiellonów z wschodnimi i południowymi sąsiadami Królestwa Polskiego w XV wieku\"\nReferences"
