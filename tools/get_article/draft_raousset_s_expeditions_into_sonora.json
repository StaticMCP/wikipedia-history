The period of the Second Federal Republic was one of the most eventful in Mexican history. With the loss of a war to the United States, constitutional change, and a civil war. It was also a period of Mexican political evolution experiencing the downfall of the Conservative Party that had predominated during the Centralist Republic, and marking the rise of the Liberal Party.\nGaston de Raousset-Boulbon was a Frenchman and theoretician of colonialism. After a series of failed enterprises as a gold prospector he became involved in a conflict in the Mexican state of Sonora. He embarked in 1850 for the Americas as a third-class passenger, and when the ship stopped in a Colombian port, and had sad impressions of the situation there. He wrote to a friend:\n\"At last, we're in the real America, Spanish America. Ruins, beggars, racial degradation, the random mixing of all bloodlines, guitar-playing bums... naked children, young savages running around among the dogs... and all in a wonderful natural setting.''\"\nHistory\nFirst Expedition\nSecond Expedition\nBattle of Guaymas\nReferences"
