Photograph by Lewis Hine, 1908.]]\nThe timeline of young peoples' rights in the United States, including children and youth rights, includes a variety of events ranging from youth activism to mass demonstrations. There is no \"golden age\" in the American children's rights movement.\nPre-19th century\nThe history of youth rights in the United States ranges from the earliest years of European settlements on North America. Poor children were routinely and legally indentured in colonial New England by the \"poor laws.\" In 1676 Nathan Knight, an eight-year-old boy, was apprenticed to a mason, \"bound... to serve and abide the full space and term of twelve years and five months.\" Provided food, shelter and clothes in exchange for his labor, the boy was not allowed to leave his master until he was 21 years old.\n19th century\nBy the end of the 19th century, American children worked in large numbers in mines, glass factories, textiles, agriculture, canneries, home industries, and as newsboys, messengers, bootblacks and peddlers.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"center\" colspan=\"6\"|'Timeline of 19th century events related to Children's Rights in the U.S.' in chronological order\n|-\n!

Several states follow suit, but do not consistently enforce their laws.\n|-\n| 1850\n| Organizations\n| There are ninety institutions for abused and neglected children in the U.S.\n|-\n| 1851\n| Massachusetts\n| The first modern adoption law (1851 Adoption of Children Act) in the U.S. was passed in Massachusetts. It recognized adoption as a social and legal operation based on child welfare rather than adult interests and directed judges to ensure that adoption decrees were \"fit and proper.\"\n|-\n| 1853\n| Children's Aid Society\n| Charles Loring Brace founded the Children's Aid Society to take in children living on the street.\n|-\n| 1854\n| Orphan Trains\n| In 1854 Charles Loring Brace led the Children's Aid Society to start the Orphan Train with stops across the West, where they were adopted and often given work.\n|-\n| 1869\n| Samuel Fletcher, Jr.\n| In one of the first such court rulings, the parents of Samuel Fletcher, Jr. are found guilty of child abuse. Fletcher, who was born blind, was locked into the cellar of his family's house for several days by his parents. Upon escaping he notified authorities and his parents were arrested. They were fined $300 in one of the first court rulings that recognized children's right to be protected by law against abuse and cruelty.\n|-\n| 1874\n| Mary Ellen Wilson\n| Mary Ellen Wilson was not allowed to go outside, except at night in her own yard, and was regularly beaten by her adopted parents. Police rescue the eight-year-old after the head of the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals calls them on Mary Ellen's behalf. Mrs. Connelly was sentenced to jail for one year. That year the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children was founded, the first organization of its kind.\n|-\n| 1876\n| Workingmen's Party of the United States\n| Workingmen's Party proposes banning the employment of children under the age of 14.\n|-\n| 1877\n| American Humane Association\n| The New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and several Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals across the U.S. joined together to form the American Humane Association.\n|-\n| 1881\n| American Federation of Labor\n| The first National Convention of the American Federation of Labor passes a resolution calling on states to ban children under 14 from all gainful employment.\n|-\n| 1883\n| Samuel Gompers\n| Samuel Gompers leads the New York Labor Movement targets the end of child labor in cigar making by successfully sponsoring legislation that bans the practice in tenements, where thousands of young children work in the trade.\n|-\n| 1889\n| Hull House\n| Hull House became one of the first organizations in the United States to provide after school programs for children and youth.\n|-\n| 1892\n| Democratic Party\n| The Democratic Party adopts platform plank with recommendations to ban factory employment for children under 15.\n|-\n| 1898\n| New York School of Applied Philanthropy\n| The New York School of Philanthropy was the first higher education program to train people who wanted to work in the field of charity, including child development and youth work, in the United States. It was established with a six-week summer program in 1898, and expanded to a full-year program in 1904.\n|-\n| 1899\n| John Dewey\n| John Dewey becomes president of the American Psychological Association, openly advocates for children's rights, and later writes several books about progressive education that  emphasize the necessity for children's rights in education and throughout democratic society. He is acknowledged as one of the heroes of the children's rights movement in the United States.\n|-\n|}\n20th century\nBefore the 1930s children were routinely exploited in a variety of settings throughout American society. Frequently beginning their working lives before their tenth birthday, children worked in hazardous jobs at mines, mills, factories, sweatshops, and on farms, with little or no wages. Labor laws did not exist, and the common perception of the ease with which children were manipulated made them targets for a variety of rights violations.\nIn the 1980s the United States provided global leadership by acting as the \"Tip of The Spear\" among nations in crafting the Convention on the Rights of the Child, or CRC. After the United Nations adopted the CRC in 1989, the United States became a signatory nation in 1994. However, to date the country has refused to ratify the Convention, joining only one other nation in the world with that status. Among the reasons the United States has failed to ratify the Convention is the fact that the Convention clearly states that anyone under the age of 18 is a child. The U.S. government has reservations about how that would affect matters when a 16- or 17-year-old commits a crime; currently, in certain instances, such a person can be tried as an adult in the U.S. courts. Several politicians have said that many of the declarations included in the document are not issues for which the federal government is in charge. There is currently no apparent effort within the federal government to adopt the CRC.\nYouth activists in a 1909 parade protesting child labor.]]\nnewsboy in Washington, D.C. in 1921.]]\nAn 11-year-old picking cotton in Oklahoma in 1916.\nAn eight-year-old newsboy in St. Louis, Missouri in 1910.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"center\" colspan=\"6\"|'''Timeline of 20th century events related to Children's Rights in the U.S.' in chronological order\n|-\n!
