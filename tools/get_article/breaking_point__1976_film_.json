Initially reluctant to identify the two culprits, he is eventually persuaded by Lieutenant Frank Sirriani, who believes their trial will lead to the arrest of Vincent Karbone, a construction magnate in Philadelphia and suspected leader of one of the city's most notorious Mafia gangs. McBain testifies despite intimidation; however, to Sirriani's surprise, the defendants refuse to name Karbone and reject a plea-bargain.\nMcBain and his family try to return to their ordinary lives. Instead, Karbone plans to kill McBain and his family, who are all put into witness protection (a program that was newly introduced in the US in 1971) and moved to Toronto. The family's new identity is compromised, though. Learning of his sister Diana's fiancé Ted Buchanan's murder, McBain returns to Philadelphia to take on Karbone himself, eventually killing him and neutralizing the threat to his family's life.\nCast\n* Bo Svenson as Michael McBain\n* Robert Culp as Frank Sirrianni\n* John Colicos as Vincent Karbone\n* Belinda Montgomery as Diana McBain\n* Linda Sorenson as Helen McBain\n* Stephen Young as Peter Stratas\n* Richard M.
