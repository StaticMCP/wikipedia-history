Each issue is 64 pages and features a few unrelated stories from various eras of the Star Wars timeline. Stories from issues #1–20 were retroactively labelled \"Infinities\", placing them outside the Star Wars canon, while those of issues #21–24 were considered to be within continuity, unless labelled otherwise. References to the stories were made within the Expanded Universe, the entirety of which was deemed non-canon by Lucasfilm in 2014.\nThe entire series was collected into six trade paperbacks, comprising four issues each.\nIssues and their canonicity\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

A Level One inspection is performed on ''Jaina's Light, but the Imperial Captain Deyd Llnewe and Lieutenant Raprice find nothing. This happens two more times, with the inspection being more intensive each time, Llnewe being convinced that Solo is up to something. After the third unsuccessful inspection, Han and Chewie are sent on their way, when Captain Llnewe suddenly realizes that the ships Solo was piloting were different each time; Han was not smuggling spice or some other illegal substance, but ships.

He and Naradan D'ulin, the caretaker of the princess, begin taking her to Villie's ship, when they're suddenly ambushed by a group of Ootoola purists. Villie hands the princess over, telling Naradan that the purists offered more credits than the loyalists did. Naradan and the princess are taken away and put into the purists' prison.\nThat night, Villie blows open the prison door and rescues them, only to get a punch in the face from Naradan. Vilmarh explains that before, with the princess running loose, everybody was looking for her, but now that they've assumed she's still locked up, nobody will be trying to find her. Naradan grabs a rifle in case she decides to shoot him, and they head out. They spot a couple of guards, and Villie casually walks up to them, steals one of their blasters, and shoots both of them. Villie, Naradan and the princess quickly escape the palace and head to Vilmarh's ship, the Inferno, where they are vocally greeted by NT. They fly off, Villie destroying the palace on his way up. They make their way to the planet Dur Sabon, where Foolookoola is to live her life among the Dur Sabon until she can return to Ootoola.\nLady Luck\n: Script: Rich Handley & Darko Macan\n: Pencils: Chris Brunner\n: Colors: Michelle Madgen & Dave Stewart\n: 16 Pages\n: Galactic Year: 1 ABY\n: Preceded by: My Brother, My Enemy\n: Followed by: Dark Lord's Conscience\nThree Against the Galaxy\n: Script: Rich Hedden\n: Pencils: Rick Leonardi\n: Inks: Mark Lipka\n: Colors: Dave McCaig\n: 22 Pages\n: Galactic Year: 5 ABY\n: Preceded by: Marooned\n: Followed by: Boba Fett: Agent of Doom\nIssue #4\nMoment of Doubt\n: Script: Lovern Kindzierski\n: Pencils: Robert Teranishi\n: Colors: Dave McCaig\n: 14 Pages\n: Galactic Year: 3 ABY\n: Preceded by: Duel a Dark Lord\n: Followed by: Hoth\nThe story takes place 3 A.B.Y.

When he meets with Vader he immediately launches a vicious assault on the Sith Lord with Grenades and light blades that extend from his arms.\nAs Vader reaches into Tark's mind he finds Awarru Tark is actually Stauz Czycz. Czycz underwent a surgical transformation to implant a force field generator into his body, so that he could attack Vader as revenge, having lost his own family in an Imperial assault on his homeworld.\nUsing telekinesis to disable the generator, Vader decapitates Czycz, leaving him to consider Czycz's status as more machine than man.\nA Death Star is Born\n: Script: Kevin Rubio\n: Pencils: Lucas Marangon\n: Colors: Dave Nestelle\n: 12 Pages\n: Galactic Year: 2 BBY\n: Preceded by: The Black Cavern\n: Followed by: Han Solo At Stars' End\nMoff Wilhuff Tarkin, Tol Sivron, and Bevel Lemelisk submit their Death Star proposal to Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader. The perceived flaws of the schematics are humorously discussed. The appearance of Bevel Lemelisk is different in this comic than in any other source where he is portrayed. This was an intentional choice on behalf of the comic's creator, although for unknown reasons. One should also note the presence of Ackbar, a Mon Calamari, and Grand Moff Tarkin's slave, soon to be Rebel Alliance Admiral listening in through the door.\nSeveral references in the story allude to popular culture, including the following:\n* The Imperial insignia, reminiscent of Mickey Mouse-ears;\n* A \"Bob's Big Boy\" fast food chain statue;\n* A hologram of Yogi Bear;\n* The starship from the Star Trek series known as Starship Enterprise.\n* The Beatles' Yellow Submarine\nSpare Parts\n: Script: Mark Evanier & Sergio Aragonés\n: Pencils: Sergio Aragonés\n: Colors: Tom Luth\n: 4 Pages\n: Galactic Year: 22 ABY\n: Preceded by: Union\n: Followed by: Chewbacca\nSand Blasted\n: Story & Art: Kilian Plunkett\n: Colors: Dave Nestelle\n: 28 Pages\n: Galactic Year: 4 ABY\n: Preceded by: The Jabba Tape\n: Followed by: A Day in the Life\nVolume 2\nIssue #5\n''Yaddle's Tale: The One Below''\n: Script: Dean Motter\n: Pencils: Jesus Saiz\n: Inks: Fernando Blanco\n: Colors: Dave Nestelle\n: 16 Pages\n: Galactic Year: 245 BBY\n: Preceded by: Heart of Darkness\n: Followed by: Vow of Justice\nWhilst discussing the possibility of knighting Yaddle the Jedi Council revisit the story of her training under the tutelage of Polvin Kut, two-hundred years prior.\nOn a mission to liberate the colonies of the Advozse Warlock Tulak the duo are betrayed on Koba, leading to Kut's death. The Padawan Yaddle is taken hostage by the Warlock but is impervious to his interrogations, warning him 'Rule by terror you do, die by fear you will'.\nIn time Tulak tires of the colony and leaves Koba. However, he seals Yaddle in a pit with the hope that he can use her as a future bargaining tool but she is soon forgotten. She is confined for a century, surviving on food and water provided by wardens left behind when Tulak left. Over the generations, the Koba society collapses, though the primitives still tend to her, lowering food as part of a ritual they barely understand. She is spoken of as The One Below. During this time Yaddle hones her Jedi skills.\nEventually an earthquake brings down the roof of her pit, allowing her to escape. Seeing the destruction of the nearby village she remains on the planet to aid the Kobans. She dedicates herself to teaching the children, society rebuilds around her. She is quietly content with her work until the day Kalut, Tulak's son, returns to Koba claiming it as his heirloom. He casually attacks, slaying many and deciding what, if anything to take, Forced to fight, Kulat ends up speared on his own weapon and dies.\nOn hearing the story the Jedi Council, in particular Yoda, are swayed to initiate her as a Jedi Master.\nWhat They Called Me\n: Story & Art: Craig Thompson\n: 4 Pages\n: This story is non-canon\n''A Summer's Dream\n: Script: Terry Moore\n: Pencils: Cliff Richards\n: Inks: P.

Apparently Drewl was enslaved to Corpo after losing a bet with the Hutt.\nCorpo's priorities in life were gambling and food, and his prize possession was a MREM-02 kitchen droid, called Moreemohtwo. Giett bets Corpo that he can prepare a meal better than one made by Moreemohtwo. Corpo accepts the wager - if Giiett wins, Drewl is freed. If Moreemohtwo wins, then Giiett would also become enslaved to the Hutt.\nGiiett secretly instructs Plo Koon to \"sabotage\" the meal prepared by the droid. The \"cook-off\" begins, with a host announcing the theme ingredient: Denusian squirmers. Giiett is bitten on the nose by a squirmer, and he uses his lightsaber to power-chop and flash cook the theme ingredient. Meanwhile, Plo Koon sneakily replaces Moreemohtwo's seebo sauce with droid oil, and slips gundar droppings, Rakririan burnout sauce and Bothan foot powder into Moreemohtwo's pot.\nAt the end of the cook-off, Moreemohtwo presents 5 dishes of delicious looking food, while Giett presents his two messy bowls of squirmer stew. After Corpo tastes Moreemohtwo's sabotaged meal, Corpo immediately releases Drewl from custody.\nOutbid But Never Outgunned\n: Script: Beau Smith\n: Pencils: Mike Deodato Jr.\n: Inks: Neil Nelson\n: Colors: Dave McCaig\n: 16 Pages\n: Galactic Year: 6 BBY\n: Preceded by: The Princess Leia Diaries (pages 1–7)\n: Followed by: Luke Skywalker: Walkabout\nForce Fiction\n: Script: Kevin Rubio\n: Art: Lucas Marangon\n: Colors: Michelle Madsen\n: 10 Pages\n: Galactic Year: 32 BBY\n: Preceded by: Deal with a Demon\n: Followed by: Nomad, Chapter one\nMace Windu and Yoda debate the possibility of training Anakin Skywalker while eating at a fast food restaurant, resorting to food-based analogies to make their points.

The story begins with Windu's approach to the fortress where he is. The path there is a narrow bridge across a deep ravine. While he is crossing it, two guards watch his approach, debating on whether or not he is a bounty hunter, and how he could have possibly found Uda-Khalid. As he crosses, he must battle high winds and \"walk worms\" (large worms that come out of the sides of the middle of the bridge). The sentries lose sight of him, only to find Windu standing right behind them. Before they fire on him, he mind-tricks them into believing that their job is to guard the walls from outside intruders, and that since he is inside the walls, he couldn't be a danger.\nWindu enters the main audience hall to find Uda-Khalid waiting for him. He offers to double Windu's pay, believing he is a bounty hunter, to which Windu responds that he has been paid with the story of his crimes. Uda-Khalid says that he has left no evidence of his crimes, no survivors, no witnesses. We then see hundreds if not thousands of spirits of Uda-Khalid's victims filling the hall around the two. Windu reveals that he is a Jedi Knight and ignites his lightsaber. Khalid gloats that it has been a long time since he's killed a Jedi, and the duel begins, only to be ended swiftly with a stab to Uda-Khalid's heart.\nStones\n: Script: Haden Blackman\n: Pencils: Michael Zulli\n: Colors: Giulia Brusco\n: 6 Pages\n: Galactic Year: 58 BBY\n: Preceded by: Vow of Justice\n: Followed by: Survivors\nA young Padawan named Mace Windu was sent to Hurikane to negotiate with these beings and possibly obtain some of the crystals.

When the Falcon runs low on fuel they head for a small unnamed planet. Solo receives no lifesign readings, as if the whole planet's population disappeared.  After making planet fall, Solo and Chewbacca step out of their ship and into the fog, only for the Corellian to be confronted and overwhelmed by groaning skeletal figures; The undead. After Chewbacca fights them off they beat a hasty retreat back to the Falcon but find the fuel line has been severed. It seems someone doesn't want them to leave.  Arming themselves, the two-man crew of the Falcon head back out and come face to face with a local and her baby. She explains that the crew of a 'Great Interplanetary Ark' perished after their ship crashed in the planet's fog. They are compelled to wander the planet as corpses, terrorizing the locals every night.  Using the Tandgor Gems to lay down lines, Han forms a makeshift runway that drives away the fog. A ghostly apparition of the ship that crashed long ago uses it to land, easing the spirits of the perished crew. The living dead would no longer terrorize the planets residents.  Han and Chewie leave the planet out of pocket, but were rewarded with enough fuel to last them the rest of their journey.\nAll for You\n: Script: Adam Gallardo\n: Pencils: Greg Titus\n: Inks: Julian Washburn\n: Colors: John Rauch\n: 10 Pages\n: Galactic Year: 996 BBY\n: Preceded by: Jedi vs. Sith\n: Followed by: The Apprentice\nThis story is set 996 years before the Battle of Yavin on the planet Ceriun, where a Jedi's ship crashes near a primitive agriculture village.  Some of the adults go to inspect the crash, and the dying Jedi gives them a Sith holocron to keep safe until another Jedi can come to retrieve it.  The younger generation of the village disagree with their hiding it, and want to take it to give it to any Sith that show up looking for it, so as to get on their good side and be taken as apprentices. Two of the older men are killed in a fight that breaks out, and comes to a halt with a Sith enters and takes the holocron.

On their way back to their ship, they are stopped by Lod, a Toydarian who offers Finn Marka, his blue-haired Human slave girl. When Marka refuses to show Finn her teeth, he hits her, causing the apprentice to angrily yell at him to stop. When Lod tells Finn that he should keep a closer eye on his slave, the apprentice screams that he is not a slave, and kills Lod with his lightsaber.\nFinn scolds the apprentice for showing compassion, a Jedi trait, and Marka asks to be taken with them, using a mind trick on the apprentice. Finn says that he has no need for a slave and already has an apprentice, and the two Sith leave, heading back to their ship. Finn orders the apprentice to deal with Marka as he heads to the top of the building their landing pad is on. A few minutes later the apprentice returns with Marka in tow, having been unable to kill her. Finn once more tells Marka that he already has an apprentice.\nIn response, Marka uses the Force to snatch the apprentice's lightsaber, then pushes him off the building to his death.

Instead, she tracks a serial killer called Kardem as vengeance for the murder of her lover, the freighter pilot Ash B'risko. Since Ash, Kardem has killed only female Twi'leks, but more disturbing is his means of killing: lightsaber and Force lightning, indicating that he is a dark Jedi. As she finds Kardem's eighth victim after following his trail of hints, a hooded figure approaches her and calls her name. They fight, but the figure disarms her and tells her he has come to take her back to the Jedi Council, but she retaliates with Force lightning. As he calls the name of Master Dir'Nul, she responds that her name is Kardem. The Jedi reveals that Dir'Nul is Kardem. She discovered Ash with a Twi'lek dancing girl, and in her rage killed him, creating the dark side mental persona of Kardem in the process. From then on, she killed female Twi'leks in the Kardem persona, then investigated the murders in the Dir'Nul persona. The Jedi tells her that he was sent to bring her back, dead or alive. Calling upon the dark side, Kardem kills him with lightning and his lightsaber. She then reverts to the Dir'Nul persona and is shocked to find that \"Kardem\" has claimed yet another victim, this time a Jedi. She reaffirms her vow to bring the killer to justice.\nIssue #18\nNumber Two in the Galaxy\n: Script: Henry Gilroy\n: Pencils: Todd Demong\n: Colors: Jim Campbell\n: 10 Pages\n: Galactic Year: 7 BBY\n: Preceded by: The Sandstorm\n: Followed by: Payback\nBoba Fett comes to get his armor repaired on the remote planet of Ma'ar Shaddam.

Fett tracks him to an abandoned droid plant on Vornax, and gives him a chance to surrender. Bantillian tells Fett that he is Drex's son, and that Fett killed his brother. Drex set up Fett. Fett fires at Bantillian, who blocks the blast with an old droideka shield. Bantillian closes the roof of the area they are in. Dozens of old droids stagger towards Fett, trying to kill him. A war droid shoots him out of the sky, damaging his jetpack. Fett destroys the droid. Fett then shoots a tank of machine oil, setting Bantillian afire. The being jumps into a deep pool of water, only belatedly realizing that he cannot swim. He calls for his droids to help and all of them sink to the bottom. Fett goes back to an astonished Drex, who pays Fett reluctantly. Fett gives Drex Bantillian's head, with a thermal detonator in the mouth.

After looking in the mirror and seeing his father's face, Boba looks for his daily bounty. After passing up escaped Wookiee slaves and high-ranking Imperial defectors, he settles for a dead-or-alive bounty named Bendu Fry. He goes into the cantina, where Fry is telling a joke to two women. As he says the punch line, Fett approaches. Fry tries to run, but Fett easily catches the fat Devaronian. To save his life, Bendu tells Fett of a Twi'lek Jedi Knight who is living on the planet. Fett leaves to track the Jedi down, and seems to locate his target. It turns out, however, the Twi'lek is not the Jedi after all, but the Jedi's son. The boy's father was killed at the Battle of Geonosis. Fett allows the boy to live and returns to cantina, disintegrating Bendu and getting his bounty.\nWay of the Warrior\n: Script: Peter Alilunas\n: Pencils: Will Conrad\n: 10 Pages\n: Galactic Year: 23 BBY\n: Preceded by: Honor and Duty\n: Followed by: The Eyes of Revolution\nOn the planet Kuat a year prior to the Battle Of Geonosis, a lone cloaked figure wanders into a small colony. When the leader of the colonists, Larbo emerges to see what is happening, the young Boba Fett hurls a thermal detonator and flees into one of the tents. As Chaos ensues Jango Fett arrives to slaughter the scattered prey. When approached by two gun men, a flick Knife appears from his gauntlet and, presumably, slits their throats. He then hunts down the other Colonists.  Larbo finds Boba cowering in the corner of his tent and holds him at gunpoint to interrogate him. He is horrified to learn the young boy is the bounty hunters son. Jango, having finished assassinating the remaining members of the camp tracks down Boba and demands Larbo releases his son and slashes his way through the tents canopy. A disgusted Larbo asks what kind of man would use his own son a bait, and Boba replies \"Only a son can know his father's heart\". Jango seizes Boba and throws a Thermal Detonator into the tent before escaping with the boy.  Jango and Boba leave the planet in Slave I, and the Bounty Hunter confirms to Count Dooku that his mission was accomplished. The Ruling Families can now commence with building factories for the Trade Federation and the Sith Lords other allies.

Han finally comes to the realization that there is more than one Fett following him. When that happens, he comes face to face with the real Fett. Fett reveals to Han that the entire event has been a training exercise to cull the weak recruits from the new batch of Mandalorian Protectors prior to them taking up service for the Yuuzhan Vong - since, as mercenaries, the Mandalorians go for the highest bidder, and the Yuuzhan Vong are currently the richest ones in the galaxy.

Obs Kaj has grown disillusioned with the state of affairs in the Republic and secretly plans to leave the Jedi Order after the mission.  However, when they arrive, they discover that they have walked into an ambush. The miners reveal that as profits from the cortosis mines declined, they looked to the Galactic Senate for support, but were spurned, and they began cloning operations to earn the necessary income. Their cloning attempts failed, and eventually they turned to the Confederacy of Independent Systems when they learned about the bounties that had been placed on Jedi.  As the miners attack the Jedi, Obs Kaj feels cut off in the Force from her Master, a result of her distancing herself. Lunis eventually falls and Kaj flees, escaping in a short-range shuttlepod. As she leaves the planet's surface, broadcasting a distress call, a ship makes contact with her. When it approaches, she realizes it is in fact Count Dooku, who promptly fires upon her, blowing her craft from the sky.  When Dooku later makes contact with the miners, he says he will only pay for the death of Lunis, half of what they expected and not enough to keep the mines afloat.\nThe Rebel Club\n: Story & Art: Scott Kurtz\n: Colors: Jim Zubkavich\n: 8 Pages\n: This story is non-canon\nThe Lost Lightsaber\n: Script: Andrew Robinson & Jim Royal\n: Pencils:\n: Inks: Kris Justice\n: Colors: Tom Smith\n: 8 Pages\n: Galactic Year: 40 ABY\n: Preceded by: Equals and Opposites\n: Followed by: Broken\nInto the Great Unknown\n: Script: Haden Blackman\n: Pencils: Sean Murphy\n: Colors: Dan Jackson\n: 10 Pages\n: This story is non-canon\nHan Solo and Chewbacca are aboard the Millennium Falcon when they are attacked by Imperials.

The Vindar have tortured, burned, and killed many members of the other race, thus breaking the spirits of most of the race's people—but not that of Otalp. Since he was young, his den-mother told him of the mysterious \"Oracle\" she saw in one of her visions. The Oracle is said to tell tales of the past to give hope for the future. Otalp's den-brother, Remoh, disagrees with this, but only travels with Otalp to escape the misery of their eternal slavery.\nWhen they reach the cave where The Oracle is fabled to live, Remoh repeats the classic line. As they enter the cave, they come across a certain protocol droid sputtering about a tragedy that occurred when he was last deactivated. The droid says strange words, like \"Ar-Too\" and \"Master Luke\", which confuses the brothers. As soon he starts talking in an understandable language, Otalp requests a story from him. Though the droid admits to being not that good a storyteller, he decides, because Otalp and Remoh came so far, to tell them the best story he knows. The story of young boy from a desolate planet who redeemed a darkened soul and freed the galaxy from the clutches of the ultimate evil using a mythical tool known as a \"lightsaber\". As the droid tells this story, the two brothers imagine it all as though it were their own kind who was fighting the fights.\nJust after the storyteller has concluded his tale, the Vindar blasts his head off. While Remoh hides, Otalp claims that he came alone. The Vindar kills him and leave to attend other matters. As Remoh gazes over the petrified corpse of his brother, he notices an oddly shaped metal rod poking out of the storyteller's severed torso chest. Remoh notices it has a button and pushes it. A glowing, green blade appears from the rod. Realization dawning on him, he starts to think of a way to free his desolate planet from the clutches of their ultimate evil.\nIssue #20\nGeorge R.

Ament suffered of guilty conscience and Darca Nyl took him and Jaren to the bikers who were chasing them earlier, who were able to show Nyl where he could get a ride to Molavar.\nMarooned\n: Story & Art: Lucas Marangon\n: 14 Pages\n: Galactic Year: 5 ABY\n: Preceded by: Mara Jade: A Night on the Town\n: Followed by: Three Against the Galaxy\nIssue #23\nShadows and Light\n: Script: Joshua Ortega\n: Art: Dustin Weaver\n: Colors: Michael Atiyeh\n: Letters: Michael Heisler\n: Galactic Year: 3,993 BBY\n: Preceded by: The Sith War\n: Followed by: Unseen, Unheard\nNomad, Chapter three\n: Script: Rob Williams\n: Pencils: Brandon Badeaux\n: Colors: Dan Jackson\n: 18 Pages\n: Galactic Year: 32 BBY\n: Preceded by: Nomad, Chapter two\n: Followed by: Nomad, Chapter four\nOn Molavar Darca Nyl continues his pursuit of Lycan, who had wreaked havoc in a local casino.

Sidious informs Maul that the phenomenon threatens to wake the Jedi from their complacency and inability to sense the return of the Sith.\nMaul tracks his quarry to a cantina on a planet in the Outer Rim. The disturbance is in the form of a Drovian brute called Silus, who is extremely strong in the dark side of the Force. Silus is a champion competitor in a fighting sport that involves use of the Force, and the winning of credits.\nWhen Maul enters, an Aleena called Tabor engages Silus in combat. Tabor is no match for him, and dies quickly.\nMaul confronts Silus, and opens a holocommunication channel to his master. Through the holo, Sidious offers Silus an opportunity to become his new apprentice: by giving him a chance to kill Darth Maul. Maul is confused by his Master's apparent betrayal, and turns to great anger. He kills Silus without much effort. Maul later realizes that it was merely a test of his own strength, and a lesson demonstrating that in fear there is power.\nThroughout the story, Maul experiences some minor flashbacks. The flashbacks reveal that Maul had plain red skin as a child, and that his Sith tattoos were applied by none other than Darth Sidious himself.\nFett Club\n: Script: Kevin Rubio\n: Pencils: Roger Langridge\n: Colors: Wil Glass\n: 11 Pages\n: This story is non-canon\nUnseen, Unheard\n: Script: Chris Avellone\n: Pencils: Dustin Weaver\n: 6 Pages\n: Galactic Year: 3,952 BBY\n: Preceded by: Shadows and Light\n: Followed by: Redemption\nNomad, Chapter four\n: Script: Rob Williams\n: Pencils: Brandon Badeaux\n: Colors: Dan Jackson\n: 24 Pages\n: Galactic Year: 32 BBY\n: Preceded by: Nomad, Chapter three\n: Followed by: Emissaries to Malastare\nSee also\n*Star Wars Infinities\n*Star Wars: Visionaries\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
