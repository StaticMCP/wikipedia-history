      "text": "# Independence Day (Sri Lanka)\n\nIndependence Day, is a Sri Lankan national holiday celebrated annually on 4 February to commemorate the country’s political independence from British rule in 1948. It is celebrated all over the country through a flag-hoisting ceremony, dances, parades, and performances. Usually, the main celebration takes place in Colombo, where the President of Sri Lanka raises the national flag and delivers a nationally televised speech.\nTraditionally the Sri Lanka Navy accords a 21 gun salute to the nation from the ceremonial naval gun battery at the Colombo Lighthouse. A Google Doodle reaching only Sri Lanka celebrated the occasion in 2013 and from 2017 continuously onwards.\nLocations of main celebrations\n*1991 - Independence Square\n*1992- Independence Square\n*1993 - Independence Square\n*1994 - Independence Square\n*1995 - Independence Square\n*1996 - Independence Square\n*1997 - Independence Square\n*1998 - Parliament Complex - Sri Jayawardana Pura Kotte\n*2008 -  Galle Face Green\n*2009 -  Galle Face Green\n*2010 -  Dalada Maligawa - Kandy\n*2011 -  Katharagama\n*2012 -  Anuradhapura - Jayanthi St\n*2013 -  Trincomalee\n*2014 -  Kegalle\n*2015 -  Galle Face Green\n*2016 -  Galle Face Green\n*2017 -  Galle Face Green\n*2018 -  Galle Face Green\n*2019 - Galle Face Green\n*2020 - Independence Square\n*2021 - Independence Square\n*2022 - Independence Square\n*2023 - Galle Face Green\n*2024 - Galle Face Green\n*2025 - Independence Square\nSee also\n* Sri Lankan independence movement\nReferences"
