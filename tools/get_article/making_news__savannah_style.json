It followed the daily activities of the lowest-rated news department in the Savannah television market. The show was the second in the Making News series, following Making News: Texas Style, which aired during Summer 2007.  The first season of Making News was the TV Guide Network's highest-rated original series.[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2007_Nov_26/ai_n21120632 TV Guide Network Renews Its Second Season of Hit News Reality Series, 'MAKING NEWS: SAVANNAH STYLE' | Business Wire | Find Articles at BNET.com] Making News: Savannah Style started taping in December 2007, and moved the setting from the first season's small town Texas market to Savannah, the country's 97th market in size, and to an underfunded, outdated news operation that was stated to be the lowest-rated ABC affiliate in the country. The show also mentioned competing stations WTOC (which, in contrast to channels 22 and 28, has the highest-rated news department in the market) and WSAV-TV.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.youtube.com/user/MakingNews Making News: Savannah Style on YouTube]\n*[http://www.thecoastalsource.com/ WJCL/WTGS website]\n*"
