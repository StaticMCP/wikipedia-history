In addition to the executive board, six Representative Officers are appointed: Legislative Affairs, Medical Education, Research, Programs, Communications, and Public Relations and Website.

The national SDOY winner receives a $1000 scholarship and recognition of the COSGP.  The winners of SDOY from each osteopathic medical school are announced in April and will be recognized at both the AACOM Annual Meeting, in April, and the AOA House of Delegates in July, respectively.\nAnother program, started in 2004, the Translating Osteopathic Understanding into Community Health (TOUCH) program encourages and recognizes Osteopathic medical students who participate in community service.
