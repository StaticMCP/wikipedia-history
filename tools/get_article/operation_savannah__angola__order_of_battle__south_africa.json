Initially, only Combat Groups A and B were deployed, with the remaining groups being mobilised and deployed into Angola later in the campaign.  There has been much dispute the overall size of Task Force Zulu.  Current evidence indicates that the Task Force started with approximately 500 men and grew to a total of 2,900 with the formation of Battle Groups Foxbat, Orange and X-Ray.\nNote: Armoured cars and artillery batteries were frequently reassigned between Combat Groups depending on the nature of the task on hand.\nTask Force Zulu\n* Task force commander: Col Koos van Heerden\n* Combat Group Alpha\n** Commander: Cmdt.
