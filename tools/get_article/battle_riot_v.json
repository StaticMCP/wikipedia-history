It was the fifth event under the Battle Riot chronology, and featured the finals of the 2023 Opera Cup.\nThe main event aired as a special episode of MLW Underground Wrestling on Reelz on April 25, 2023, while other matches were taped for future MLW programming. A \"Special Edition\" of the telecast was streamed on May 18 for FITE+ subscribers as part of MLW's new partnership with the streamer.\nProduction\nBackground\nBattle Riot is a recurring event that was established by MLW in 2018. The event is named after the Battle Riot match, a multi-competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until one is left and declared winner. The match begins with a number of participants in the ring, who are then eliminated by either pin, submission, or going over the top rope and having both feet touch the venue floor. The declared winner of the Battle Riot match receives a future title shot for the MLW World Heavyweight Championship. On February 8, 2023, it was announced that Battle Riot V would take place on June 23, 2022, at the 2300 Arena in Philadelphia.\nOn the March 21 episode of MLW Underground Wrestling, it was announced that the event will air on Reelz in the U.S. It was later announced that Battle Riot V will air on April 25 as an episode of Underground Wrestling.\nStorylines\nThe show will feature several professional wrestling matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\nThe main feature of the event is the titular Battle Riot match, a 40-man rumble rules-based match where the winner will receive a \"golden ticket\", which they can redeem for an MLW World Heavyweight Championship match anytime and anywhere.\nOn March 27, via MLW's \"Open Door Policy,\" MLW announced, in collaboration with Westside Xtreme Wrestling (wXw), Shigehiro Irie will defend the wXw Unified World Wrestling Championship against Calvin Tankman at Battle Riot V.\nResults\n|times  =\n|match1 = 1 Called Manders defeated Yoscifer
