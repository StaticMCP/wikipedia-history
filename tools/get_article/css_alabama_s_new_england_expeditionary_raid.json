The primary area of operation during this expeditionary raid, was the eastern seaboard of the United States ranging as far down as Virginia and Bermuda.\nRaid overview\nCSS Alabama worked its way down the east coast during the month of October capturing three ships, and burning ten others, and encountering a hurricane along the way. Finally, departing station off the New England coast, the ship set sail for Martinique to rendezvous with its supply vessel, CSS Agrippina, burning two more ships on the way.\nFrom this raiding area off the coast of New England, CSS Alabama made its way into the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico to continue its unhindered wrecking of enemy commerce along the North American coastline.\nRaid bounty\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background:white; color:black\"\n|+ 'CSS Alabamas New England Expeditionary Raid'\n!
