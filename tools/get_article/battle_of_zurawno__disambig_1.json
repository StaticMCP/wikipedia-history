The battle ended in negotiations for peace; the treaty of Żurawno was signed in its aftermath.\nBattle\nIn late August 1676, a large Ottoman-Tatar army of some 50,000 entered the southern Polish province of Pokucie. The invaders were faced by Jan III Sobieski, who had 20,000 soldiers. On 24 September 1676, Polish mounted units clashed with Tatars near Wojnilow and Dolha, and withdrew to the fortified camp in Zurawno.\nThe Polish camp was protected from two sides by the Dniestr river, while in its front was the Krechowka river. Tatar forces under Selim I Giray concentrated around it by 26 September, while Ottoman units under Ibrahim Shishman arrived there on 28–29 September. The Ottoman forces were hoping that King Sobieski would lead his troops out of the camp, to fight a battle in the open field, but the Poles decided to stay in Zurawno. As a result, a prolonged siege began, initiated by a barrage of the Ottoman artillery, which continued until 5 October 1676. Since Polish losses were high, Sobieski ordered to abandon the first line of defence, along the old redoubt, and occupy the new line, closer to the center of the camp.\nThe siege of Zurawno continued until 14 October. Ottoman losses were high, and the Poles continued to fight. Although the Poles were running out of food and ammunition, heavy rains put the Ottoman camp at risk of being flooded and the siege that much more difficult. The Ottoman commander Ibrahim Şeytan (Abraham the Devil) decided to initiate negotiations.\nAftermath\nOn 14 October a truce was signed, and three days later the Treaty of Zurawno was signed, ending the second phase of the Polish–Ottoman War (1672–76). Some sources call this a stalemate, while others call it a victory for the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth or Ottoman Empire.\nIn 1876, on the 200th anniversary of the battle, the Polish population of Zurawno founded a commemorative monument to celebrate the halt of the Ottoman advance into Eastern Europe.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
