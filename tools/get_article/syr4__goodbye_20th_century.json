      "text": "# SYR4: Goodbye 20th Century\n\nSYR4: Goodbye 20th Century is an album by American alternative rock band Sonic Youth. It is a double album of versions of pieces by avant-garde composers, performed by Sonic Youth and collaborators.\nBackground\nSYR4 featured works by avant-garde classical composers such as John Cage, Yoko Ono, Steve Reich and Christian Wolff, played by Sonic Youth and several collaborators from the modern avant-garde music scene, such as Christian Marclay, William Winant, Wharton Tiers and Takehisa Kosugi.\nUnlike other entries in the SYR series, SYR4s liner notes were written in English.\nThurston Moore and Kim Gordon's daughter Coco Hayley Moore, about 5 years old at the time of recording, provided the vocals for \"Voice Piece for Soprano\" on disc 1.\nRelease\nSYR4: Goodbye 20th Century was released on CD and vinyl. The vinyl version had a slightly different track order, due to the side length constraints of the format. The first disc of the CD edition contained a QuickTime video of a performance of \"Piano Piece No. 13 (Carpenter's Piece)\", which showed Sonic Youth nailing piano keys down one by one.\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = Alternative Press\n| rev2score =\n| rev3 = Robert Christgau\n| rev3score =\n| rev4 = Entertainment Weekly\n| rev4score = C+\n| rev5 = NME\n| rev5score = 7/10\n| rev6 = Pitchfork\n| rev6score = 8.5/10\n| rev7 = The Rolling Stone Album Guide\n| rev7score =\n| rev8 = Spin\n| rev8score = favorable\n| rev9 = Sputnikmusic\n| rev9score = 3.5/5\n}}\nSYR: Goodbye 20th Century received mixed reviews from critics, but most praised the group's efforts at popularizing and reinterpreting the composers' works.
