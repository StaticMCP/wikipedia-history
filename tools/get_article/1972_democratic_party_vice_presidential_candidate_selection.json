After winning the Democratic nomination for president on July 13, McGovern looked for a running mate. McGovern's first choice for vice president was Ted Kennedy, but Kennedy refused to join the ticket; Minnesota Senator Walter Mondale, Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson, and Connecticut Senator Abraham A. Ribicoff also declined. McGovern offered the position to Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton, who appealed to labor groups and Catholics, two groups that McGovern had alienated during the primary campaign. The ticket of McGovern and Eagleton was nominated by the 1972 Democratic National Convention.\nFollowing the convention, it was revealed that Eagleton had received treatment for depression in the 1960s. Though McGovern considered keeping Eagleton on the ticket, he ultimately chose to replace Eagleton with former ambassador Sargent Shriver. The McGovern–Shriver ticket lost the presidential election to the Nixon–Agnew ticket. After the controversy surrounding Eagleton, future campaigns spent much more time vetting vice presidential candidates.\nPotential running mates\nFile:Sargent Shriver 1961 (cropped).jpg|alt=|\nFile:Thomas Eagleton (3x4 crop).jpg|\nFile:Abraham-Ribicoff (cropped).jpg|alt=|\nFile:Mikegravel (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Dale Bumpers.jpg|alt=|\nFile:U.S. Representative Wilbur Mills, Chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, half-length portrait, standing, facing front, holding a copy of the Budget of the United States (cropped).jpg|alt=|\nFile:Boston Mayor Kevin H White (1).jpg|alt=|\nFile:Walter Cronkite November 1983 gtfy.00866 (cropped).jpg|alt=|}}\nFile:Larry O'Brien 1961.jpg|alt=|\nFile:Gov Reubin Askew (cropped).png|alt=|\nFile:Portrait of Frank Church (D-ID).png|alt=|\nFile:Adlai Stevenson III 50334a (1).jpg|alt=|\nFile:Birch bayh.jpg|alt=|\nFile:Edmund Muskie.jpg|alt=|\nFile:Endicott Peabody (1971) (1).png|alt=|\nFile:On his arrival in Israel, Senator Edward Kennedy declared to the press that he supports supplying Israel with US made Phantom fighters (FL45949848).jpg|alt=|\nFile:James G.

She had gained recognition due to her surprising, though unsuccessful, forced run-off against Texas’ incumbent Democratic Governor Preston Smith and former state representative Dolph Briscoe, the favorite for the nomination and eventual winner, in the Democratic primaries.\nThe effort to nominate her for vice president came after the realization that Shirley Chisholm, the first major black candidate for President of the United States, would not have the delegates necessary to win the nomination at the convention. Chisholm had had the endorsement of and had helped found the National Women's Political Caucus, a new organization formed in Washington, D.C. in 1971. Following her convention defeat, the caucus had moved to recruit Farenthold to run for the vice presidency. The individual chosen to place Francis “Sissy” Farenthold's name in nomination for vice president would be Gloria Steinem, the co-founder of Ms. magazine.\nAlthough the nomination effort aroused the convention-goers mired in malaise and anger from the difficult 1972 Democratic National Convention, the campaign for her vice presidency was highly disorganized and last-minute, without a serious chance at denying Senator Thomas Eagleton his nomination by George McGovern. Despite coming from the state of Texas, the Texas delegation, controlled by Dolph Briscoe, did not support her candidacy. Regardless, the balloting for vice president finished with Farenthold receiving 405 delegates, and 13.73% of the vote, the second-most of all of the candidates.\nFarenthold was the first serious female candidate for the nomination for vice president of the United States by either major party. She would go on to once again compete with and lose to Dolph Briscoe for the Democratic nomination for governor of Texas in 1974.\nSee also\n* 1972 Democratic National Convention\n* 1972 Democratic Party presidential primaries\nReferences"
