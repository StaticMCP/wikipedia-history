Wagtail Grove was created from land formerly within Bellmere, Rocksberg, and Upper Caboolture.\nThe name Wagtail refers to the Willie Wagtail bird (Rhipidura leucophrys), a native bird of the Caboolture area. The name Grove refers to a group of trees.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Wagtail Grove. The nearest government primary schools are Bellmere State School in Bellmere to the north-east and Minimbah State School in Morayfield to the east. The nearest government secondary schools are Tullawong State School in Caboolture to the north-east and Morayfield State High School in Morayfield to the east.\nReferences"
