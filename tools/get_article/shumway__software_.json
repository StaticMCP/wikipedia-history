It was intended as an open-source replacement for Adobe Flash Player. It is licensed under Apache and SIL Open Font License (OFL). Mozilla started development on it in 2012. It was preceded by a failed earlier project called Gordon, a JavaScript library with a similar concept and name, which interprets SWF files with onboard resources of a browser via SVG conversion. These names are an allusion to Flash Gordon and Gordon Shumway.\nShumway renders Flash contents by translating Flash file contents to HTML5 elements, and running an ActionScript interpreter in JavaScript. It supports both AVM1 and AVM2, and ActionScript versions 1, 2, and 3.\nDevelopment of Shumway has effectively ceased.  Although the project remains available on GitHub (see External links), in February 2016, the project was moved to the \"Firefox Graveyard\" and is thus considered defunct from Mozilla's point of view.  Mozilla's strategy in 2016 was to continue to support Adobe Flash, as an exception to its general policy of ceasing support for NPAPI plugins by the end of 2016.\nSee also\n* Ruffle\n* Google Swiffy\n* Adobe Wallaby\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*  – Shumway's landing page\n* [https://github.com/mozilla/shumway/wiki Shumway Wiki – GitHub]\n* [https://wiki.mozilla.org/Shumway Shumway – MozillaWiki]"
