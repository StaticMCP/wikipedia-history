After jobs with Vido Musso and Johnnie Davis, Rumsey became part of Stan Kenton's first band. Rumsey soon left Kenton after an argument. He played with Charlie Barnet and Barney Bigard before taking a short hiatus from music. Following this absence, Rumsey returned to the Los Angeles jazz scene to form the group the Lighthouse All-Stars. For most of the 1950s this group played each Sunday at the Lighthouse Cafe in Hermosa Beach. During its lifetime, the Lighthouse All-Stars were one of the primary modern jazz institutions on the west coast, providing a home for many Los Angeles musicians.\nThe Lighthouse All-Stars\nIn early 1949, Rumsey was in search of a playing job and came across the Lighthouse Club on Pier Avenue in Hermosa Beach, which he felt would be an ideal place to play music. The Lighthouse was built in 1934 as a restaurant named Verpilates. In 1940, the business changed hands, and under new ownership it was turned into a Polynesian-styled club named the Lighthouse, primarily serving merchant seamen. In 1948, the club was sold to John Levine. After convincing Levine to permit the playing of jazz in the club, Rumsey played his first show on Sunday 29 May 1949, to immediate success.\nThe first Lighthouse All-Stars was a group made up of Los Angeles musicians who had been a part of the Central Avenue scene in the 1940s, including Teddy Edwards, Sonny Criss, Hampton Hawes, Frank Patchen, [https://www.allmusic.com/artist/bobby-white-mn0001216645 Bobby White] and Keith Williams. This band lasted for a time before Rumsey changed personnel to feature a new wave of players. The second edition of the Lighthouse All-Stars featured Jimmy Giuffre, Shorty Rogers, and Shelly Manne. The success of this group soon landed them with a recording contract for Les Koenig's Contemporary Records. Not only were the Lighthouse All-Stars recording for Contemporary, but many of the members of the group were also leading sessions for this same label.\nAfter Rogers, Giuffre and Manne left together in 1953 for a job at The Haig, Rumsey had to recreate his band yet again. This third edition featured Bud Shank, Bob Cooper, Rolf Ericson and Max Roach. This band took part in a historic recording on 13 September 1953, Roach's first show with the group, which would feature both Chet Baker and Miles Davis, along with Russ Freeman and Lorraine Geller.\nWith the eventual breakup of this edition, the chairs were filled by various other notable musicians throughout the following years. In his book West Coast Jazz, author Ted Gioia claims to have listed over seventy-five musicians who were once members of the group.  By the early 1960s interest in jazz in Los Angeles had greatly faded and the group came to its demise. From 1971 to 1985, Rumsey owned and operated Concerts By The Sea in Redondo Beach, California, a \"distinctive club that provided an ideal tiered, concert-seating venue (seating 200) which offered the finest jazz in the Los Angeles area\".\nRumsey died from complications of pneumonia in Newport Beach, California, at the age of 97.\nDiscography\nAs leader (credited to Howard Rumsey's Lighthouse All Stars)\n78rpm singles:\n* \"You Know I'm In Love With You\" // \"Desire\" (Skylark SK537) [note: both songs feature Vivien Garry on vocals]\n* \"Big Boy (Part I)\" // \"Big Boy (Part II)\" (Skylark SK538) [note: these four tracks are from the first Lighthouse All Stars recording session in 1952]\n* \"Big Boy - Part 1\" // \"Big Boy - Part 2\" (Modern 875) [note: these two tracks are from a live concert performance by the LHAS during the summer of 1952; disc released under the name of Jim Giuffre & His Orchestra]\n* \"Out Of Somewhere\" // \"Viva Zapata!\" (Lighthouse LH351)\n* \"Swing Shift\" // \"Big Girl\" (Lighthouse LH352) [note: these 4 tracks are from the second LHAS recording session (1953); both LH351 and LH352 were later included on C2506]\n10\" LPs:\n*Volume 2 - Sunday Jazz A La Lighthouse (Contemporary C2501) -CD issue: OJC/Fantasy 972-\n*Volume 3 (Contemporary C2506) [note: UK version of C2506 is titled Howard Rumsey & His Lighthouse All Stars, Vol. 3]\n*Volume 4 - Oboe/Flute (Contemporary C2510) [note: UK version of C2510 is titled Howard Rumsey & His Lighthouse All Stars, Vol. 1 - Bob Cooper, oboe & English horn; Bud Shank, flute & alto flute; Howard Rumsey, bass; Claude Williamson, piano; Max Roach, drums]\n*Volume 5 - In The Solo Spotlight (Contemporary C2515) [note: UK version of C2515 is titled Howard Rumsey & His Lighthouse All Stars, Vol. 2 - In The Solo Spotlight]\n12\" LPs:\n*Volume 1 - Sunday Jazz A La Lighthouse (Lighthouse LP301 [original issue]; Contemporary C3501 [reissue]) -CD issue: OJC/Fantasy 151-\n*Volume 6 (Contemporary C3504) -CD issue: OJC/Fantasy 386-\n*Volume 3 (Contemporary C3508) [note: this is a reissue of C2506 with three tracks from 1955 added on] -CD issue: OJC/Fantasy 266-\n*Lighthouse At Laguna (Contemporary C3509) [note: this is the seventh volume in the 'Lighthouse Series' on Contemporary) -CD issue: OJC/Fantasy 406-\n*Volume 5 - In The Solo Spotlight!
