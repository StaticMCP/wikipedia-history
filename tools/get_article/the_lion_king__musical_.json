On June 13, 2006, to make way for the Broadway production of Mary Poppins, the show moved to the Minskoff Theatre, where it is still running after more than 10,000 performances. It is Broadway's third longest-running show in history, and has grossed more than $1.9 billion, making it the highest grossing Broadway production of all time. Over 114 million people worldwide have seen the musical and it has earned numerous awards and honors, including six Tony Awards, one for Best Musical and Best Direction of a Musical, making director Julie Taymor the first woman to earn such an honor.\nThe show opened in the West End's Lyceum Theatre on October 19, 1999, and is still running after more than 10,000 performances. The cast of the West End production were invited to perform at the Royal Variety Performance in 1999 and 2008, in the presence of senior members of the British royal family. The theatre flooded on May 11, 2020, while the theatre was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Lion King reopened at the Lyceum in July 2021.\nIn September 2014, The Lion King became the top-earning title in box-office history for both stage works and films, surpassing the record previously held by The Phantom of the Opera. The musical has grossed more than  worldwide.\nAs of March 12, 2020, the show suspended production on Broadway due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Lion King resumed Broadway performances on September 14, 2021. When a new Covid variant caused absences in January 2022, one of the actors playing Young Simba played Young Nala during a performance. During the week ending January 1, 2023, The Lion King achieved the highest weekly gross in Broadway history with $4.3 million.\nThe West End cast performed at a concert for the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace in June 2022.\nSynopsis\nAct I\nAs the sun rises, Rafiki the mandrill calls the animals to Pride Rock. She greets King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi before presenting their cub to the gathered animals (\"Circle of Life\"). Elsewhere, Mufasa's brother, Scar, laments his lost chance at becoming King. Back at her baobab tree, Rafiki paints an image of the cub and asks the spirits to conjure the new prince's name: Simba.\nTime passes and Simba grows into a lively young cub (\"Grasslands Chant\"). Mufasa shows Simba the Pride Lands from the top of Pride Rock and explains that everything exists in a delicate balance known as the Circle of Life. Mufasa warns Simba not to stray beyond the boundaries of the Pride Lands, pointing out a shadowy area in the distance. Zazu, a hornbill who acts as Mufasa's advisor, arrives and delivers his daily report on the state of affairs in the King's domain (\"The Morning Report\", now cut from the Broadway production).\nSimba goes to see his Uncle Scar. The scheming lion piques the cub's curiosity by mentioning the elephant graveyard, where Simba is forbidden to go. Meanwhile, the lionesses go hunting (\"The Lioness Hunt\"). Simba arrives and asks his best friend, a female cub named Nala, to come with him to the elephant graveyard. He lies to the lionesses about where they are going, and Sarafina (Nala's mother) and Sarabi allow the cubs to go, escorted by Zazu. Simba and Nala formulate a plan and manage to lose Zazu, while Simba brags about his future position (\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\").\nThe cubs go to the graveyard and begin to explore. Zazu catches up, but they are confronted by three hyenas: Shenzi, Banzai and Ed. The hyenas intend to eat the trespassers and they gloat about their find (\"Chow Down\"). Mufasa rescues the cubs and frightens off the hyenas.\nMufasa is disappointed and angry at Simba's reckless disobedience, and explains the difference between bravery and bravado. Mufasa tells Simba about the great kings of the past and how they watch over everything from the stars (\"They Live in You\"). Mufasa says that he will always be there for his son. Later he discusses Simba's behavior with Zazu, who reminds Mufasa that he had the same tendency to get into trouble at Simba's age.\nBack at the elephant graveyard, Scar tells the hyenas of his plan to kill Mufasa and Simba so that he can become king. He raises an army of hyenas, promising that they will never go hungry again if they support him (\"Be Prepared\"). Scar takes Simba to a gorge and tells him to wait there. On Scar's signal, the hyenas start a wildebeest stampede into the gorge (\"The Stampede\"). Scar tells Mufasa that Simba is trapped in the gorge. Mufasa leaps into the stampede and manages to save his son, but as he tries to escape, Scar throws him off the cliff back into the stampede, killing him. Scar convinces Simba that his father's death was his fault and tells him to run away, but as he leaves, Scar orders the hyenas to kill him. Simba escapes but the hyenas tell Scar that he is dead. Rafiki and the lionesses mourn the deaths (\"Rafiki Mourns\"). Scar claims the throne and allows the hyenas into the Pride Lands (\"Be Prepared (Reprise)\"). Rafiki returns to her tree and smears the drawing of Simba, while Sarabi and Nala quietly grieve.\nOut in the desert, Simba collapses from heat exhaustion. Vultures begin to circle, but are scared away by Timon the meerkat and Pumbaa the warthog. Simba feels responsible for Mufasa's death, but the duo take the cub to their jungle home and show him their carefree way of life and bug diet (\"Hakuna Matata\"). Simba grows to adulthood in the jungle.\nAct II\nThe chorus, dressed in colorful clothes with ornate bird puppets and kites, begin the second act (\"One by One\").  As the song ends, however, the beautiful birds are replaced by vultures and gazelle skeletons. Under Scar's rule, the Circle of Life is out of balance and a drought has hit the Pride Lands. Zazu, now a prisoner of Scar, listens to the king's woes. The hyenas are complaining about the lack of food, but Scar is only concerned with himself and why he is not loved. He is haunted by visions of Mufasa and rapidly switches between delusional confidence and paranoid despair (\"The Madness of King Scar\"). Nala arrives to confront Scar about the famine and Scar decides she will be his queen and give him cubs. Nala fiercely rebukes him and resolves to leave the Pride Lands to find help. Rafiki and the lionesses bless her for her journey (\"Shadowland\").\nBack in the jungle, Timon and Pumbaa want to sleep, but the restless Simba is unable to settle. Annoyed, Simba leaves them, but Timon and Pumbaa lose their courage and follow him. Simba leaps across a fast-moving river and challenges Timon to do the same. Timon falls in and is swept downstream. He grabs a branch over a waterfall and calls for Simba's help, but Simba is paralyzed by a flashback of Mufasa's death. Timon falls from the branch and Simba snaps out of the flashback, rescuing his friend. Simba is ashamed that Timon nearly died because of his recklessness.\nThe three friends settle to sleep and discuss the stars. Simba recalls Mufasa's words, but his friends laugh at the notion of dead kings watching them. Simba leaves, expressing his loneliness and bitterly recalling Mufasa's promise to be there for him (\"Endless Night\"). Rafiki hears the song on the wind, joyfully realizes that Simba is alive, and draws a mane onto her painting of Simba.\nIn the jungle, Pumbaa is hunted and chased by a lioness. Simba confronts her and saves his friend, but recognizes the lioness as Nala. She is amazed to find Simba alive, knowing that he is the rightful king. Timon and Pumbaa are confused, but Simba asks them to leave him and Nala alone. Timon realizes what is happening and laments the end of Simba's Hakuna Matata lifestyle (\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\"). Nala tells Simba about the devastated Pride Lands, but Simba still feels responsible for Mufasa's death and refuses to return home.\nOn his own, Simba meets Rafiki, who explains that his father lives on (\"He Lives in You\"). Mufasa's spirit appears in the sky and tells Simba he is the one true king and must take his place in the Circle of Life. Reawakened, Simba finds his courage and heads for home. Meanwhile, Nala wakes Timon and Pumbaa to ask where Simba is, and Rafiki appears to tell them all the news. The three of them catch up with him in the Pride Lands, where he witnesses the ruin of his home. Timon and Pumbaa distract some hyenas by doing the Charleston, allowing Simba and Nala to reach Pride Rock.\nScar calls for Sarabi and demands to know why the lionesses are not hunting. Sarabi stands up to him about the lack of anything to hunt, angrily comparing him to Mufasa, and Scar strikes his sister-in-law, saying he's ten times the king Mufasa was. Enraged, Simba reveals himself. Scar forces a confession of murder from Simba and corners him. Believing that he has won, Scar taunts Simba by admitting that he killed Mufasa. Furious, Simba recovers and forces Scar to reveal the truth to the lionesses (\"Simba Confronts Scar\"). Simba's friends fight the hyenas while Simba battles Scar to the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for his life, blaming the hyenas for everything. Simba lets him leave out of mercy, but Scar attacks again. Simba blocks the attack and Scar falls from the cliff. The hyenas, who heard Scar's betrayal and are still starving, tear him to shreds.\nWith the battle won, Simba's friends come forward and acknowledge Simba as the rightful king. Simba ascends Pride Rock and roars out across the kingdom (\"King of Pride Rock\"). The Pride Lands recover and the animals gather in celebration as Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub, continuing the Circle of Life (\"Circle of Life (Reprise)\").\nSongs\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

The mandrill Rafiki's gender was changed to a female role because Taymor observed that there was generally no leading female character in the film. Rafiki was portrayed by Tsidii Le Loka in the original Broadway musical, and by Josette Bushell-Mingo in the original London production.\n.]]\nSeveral new scenes are present, including a conversation between Mufasa and Zazu about Mufasa's parenting and a perilous scene in which Timon finds himself nearly drowning in a waterfall while Simba feels powerless to help him. A major narrative addition is the depiction of Nala's departure in the scene \"The Madness of King Scar\", where the mentally deteriorating villain tries to make Nala his mate. Nala refuses and later announces her intention to depart the Pride Lands and find help. She receives the blessings of the lionesses and Rafiki during the new song \"Shadowland\".\n]]\nLike its predecessor, the Beauty and the Beast musical, the show adds more songs to its stage production, including \"Morning Report\", sung by Zazu the hornbill and later added to the film for the Platinum Edition DVD release. \"Shadowland\" originally featured on the CD Rhythm of the Pride Lands with Zulu lyrics as \"Lea Halelela\", was adapted for the musical with new English lyrics. It is sung by Nala, the lionesses, and Rafiki. \"Endless Night\", also from Rhythm of the Pride Lands with Zulu lyrics as \"Lala\", is sung by Simba while reflecting on Mufasa's promise to always be there. \"One by One\", from the Rhythm of the Pride Lands CD, was adapted as the rousing African-styled entre act sung by the chorus at the opening of the second act.\nMany of the animals portrayed in the production are actors in costume using extra tools to move their costumes. For example, the giraffes are portrayed by actors walking on stilts. For principal characters such as Mufasa and Scar, the costumes feature mechanical headpieces that can be raised and lowered to foster the illusion of a cat \"lunging\" at another. Other characters, such as the hyenas, Zazu, Timon, and Pumbaa, are portrayed by actors in life-sized puppets or costumes. The Timon character is described by Taymor as one of the hardest roles to master because the movement of the puppet's head and arms puts a strain on the actor's arms, back, and neck.\nA new section of the production, the Lioness Hunt, features a particularly complicated dance sequence for the actresses, and the dance is made even more difficult by the large headpieces worn during the scene.\nAs of June 27, 2010, nine minutes of the Broadway version were cut, among them the entire \"Morning Report\" musical number. The song was also removed from subsequent productions and cast recordings, such as the Spanish one.\nProductions\nUnited States\nFirst Lady Michelle Obama joins the cast of the U.S. touring company onstage after their performance at the Kids' State Dinner in the [[East Room of the White House]]\nAs of 2022, the musical is touring North America for the third time. This tour, named the Rafiki Tour, began on October 26, 2017. The tour version is very similar to the original Broadway production; however, certain scenic elements which rise out of the stage floor (such as Pride Rock, the stampede, and the grasslands) were converted to less costly configurations for the touring productions. The sun during the opening is reduced in size for the shorter-lasting tours. Stage sizes are also smaller, and the size of the pit orchestra is decreased. The first national tour (Gazelle Tour) launched on April 17, 2002, and closed on July 23, 2017.

It will be the first production to return performing - all others have been closed since March 2020.

Phindile performed in English (American tour and Las Vegas, 2002–2010), Spanish (Madrid, 2012) and Portuguese (São Paulo, 2013); while Ntsepa was leading in São Paulo (2014, as a substitute to Phindile), Basel (2015) and Shanghai (2016). Zama in French, (Paris, 2007–2010), Spanish (Madrid, 2011–2019) and Portuguese (São Paulo, 2023–2024)\n*Zama Magudulela, is also the sole actress ever to perform in five companies, as she was in the first Australian tour (2003–2006), German (2006), French (2007–2010), Spanish (2011–2019) and Brazilian (2023–2024) productions.\n*Portia Manyike is the only actress to perform in three languages, though she was never promoted to leading cast member. She's been part of the ensemble in France, Brazil and Mexico.\n*Nteliseng Nkhela (German and English), Nomvula Dlamini (English and Dutch), Ntsepa Pitjeng (English, Portuguese, Mandarin and French), Thabile Mtshali (English and Portuguese), Mukelisiwe Goba (English and Spanish) and Brown Lindiwe Mkhize (English and Spanish) are the only actresses who performed as leading Rafikis in productions in two languages.\n*John Vickery was the first actor to move from Broadway into a different production of the show, when he chose to leave Broadway in 1999 to move to the Los Angeles production in 2000.\n*Sheila Gibbs was the first actress to move from a standby into a leading role. She was a Rafiki understudy for Tsidi Le Loka from 1997 to 1998 and was selected as leading from 2001 to 2002. This was followed by Gugwana Dlamini, who was a standby (1999–2002) and a leading (2002–2005) in the show's London production and Buyisile Zama, who was a standby for Gugwana in London (2002–2003) and leading actress for the show's first Australian tour (2003–2006).\n*Nomvula Dlamini was the first, and so far the only, actress who moved from Broadway into a production performed in a different language, being the leading Rafiki on Broadway (2002–2004) and Holland (2004–2006).\n*Spanish actors Esteban Oliver and Mukelisiwe Goba were the first actors who moved from Spain into Broadway, when they respectively took over the role of Zazu and Rafiki understudy in 2014 for a couple of months. Mukelisiwe then was transferred to the Gazelle Tour, taking over Tshidi Manye in September 2015.\n*Having been in the show since its 1997 premiere, actress Lindiwe Dlamini is the actress who's been for more time in the show. She's followed by Joachim Benoit, who's been regularly performing as Zazu since the show premiered in Germany, in 2001.\n*Melina M'Poy was the first actress to perform as the two leading lionesses. She was Sarabi (France, 2007–2010) and Nala (Basel, London, UK tour and Singapore, 2011–2015).\n*The Londoner production is known to have been the first to have selected non-African actresses to perform as Rafiki, since actresses Josette Bushell-Mingo (1999–2001) and Sharon D. Clarke (2001–2003) are English, though their understudies were South African. The American tour companies followed this when Fredi Walker and Fuchsia Walker were chosen as Rafiki in 2001 as leadings for the first American tour and the Los Angeles one, respectively.\n*The Japanese and Korean productions also stand out since never throughout them the productions had leading African actresses. Native Japanese and Korean actresses performed as Rafiki during the productions.\n*Buyi Zama (2002–2016), Zama Magudulela (2002 up to the present day), Brown Lindiwe Mkhize (starting in 2005), Futhi Mhlongo (2000–2004; 2010–2018), Tshidi Manye (2000 up to the present day), Gugwana Dlamini (2002– up to present day), Thandazile A. Soni (2002–2010; 2012 up to the present day), and Mpume Sikakane (2002 up to the present day) are the actresses who've been performing as either leading or stand-bys to Rafiki for the longest time, having performed in several productions.\n*Alton Fitzgerald White (2002–2015), Nathaniel Stampley (2006–2010), and David Comrie (leading in the Spanish production from 2011 to 2017) performed as Mufasa for longer than any other actor. Behind them comes Jean-Luc Guizonne, who performed in Paris, Singapore and German (from 2007 to 2014).\n*On several occasions, members from different productions agreed to change places. That happened twice: when Patrick Brown (American tour) and Gareth Saxe (Broadway) changed places as leading Scar in 2014–2015; Buyi Zama (American tour) changed places with Tshidi Manye (Broadway) as Rafiki in 2013–2014 and when Brown Lindiwe Mkhize (London) changed places with Nteliseng Nkhela (American tour) again as Rafiki in 2013. More recently, Tryphena Wade and Chondra Profit agreed to change places from the North American tour to Broadway.\n*When actress Shirley Hlahatse was chosen as the leading Rafiki in the Mexican production of the show, it marked the first time in years an actress who had never been in the show before was given the role. In most occasions, understudies or standbys were promoted to leading.\n*South African dancer Keswa was 18 years old when she arrived on Broadway in 1999. She was the youngest performer ever to be given a role in the show's ensemble group.\n*Balungile Gumede and Marvette Williams are the actresses who have played Sarabi for the longest timespan in the show. Balungile as of February 2018 is a cover Sarabi, however she started in the German production of the show in 2010 taking over Marvette playing Sarabi until 2017 when she was replaced by Kerry Jean. They are followed by Tryphena Wade, who's also performing as the lioness since 2010.\n*Enrique Segura is the actor who played Ed for the longest timespan in the show, being on it for more than a decade.\n*Segura is followed by Bonita J. Hamilton and James Brown-Orleans, who have been performing as hyenas Shenzi and Banzai for more than 5 years.\n* Nokubonga Khuzwayo has been performing as Nala for the longest timespan in the show. She's performed in South Africa (2007–2008), Taiwan (2008), Las Vegas (2010–2011), American tour (2011) and Germany (2012–2017).\n*Lebo M, Tsidii LeLoka, Willi Welp and Gustavo Vaz were the only actors who were performers and directors of the show. Lebo M was the composer of various of the show's songs and performed on Broadway (1997–2000), Willi Welp performed as Scar from 2005 to 2015 and then left to be the resident director of the show's German production and Gustavo was the resident director of the show's Brazilian production at the same time he was a Scar and Pumbaa standby. Original Broadway Rafiki Tsidi LeLoka was also part of the show's creative team, as she's the one responsible for adding Rafiki's chants to the story and writing her mourning song.\n*After 1500 performances in 6 years, Agustin Arguello turned into the actor who's been performing as a leading Simba for the longest time in the show worldwide, doing more than 500 shows in México after 3 years, and currently doing more than 1000 shows in Spain, after 3 more years. He is still currently doing the show in Madrid.\n*Carlos Rivera is the sole leading cast member whose voice can be heard in two different recordings. He plays Simba in the Spanish (2011) and Mexican (2015) cast albums.\n*While it's a rule for all the productions of the show to have at least 6 South African performers in their casts, the South African one had a cast fully made of native actors.\n*Nosipho Nkonqa is the cast member who's been in more productions than any other. She was in the Holland (2004–2006), South African (2007–2008), Taiwan (2008), Singapore (2011), United Kingdom tour (2012–2015), Basel (2015) and London (2016 up to the present time) productions.\n*Andile Gumbi is the actor who performed as Simba for the longest time in the show. He was in the original Australian tour (2003–2006), Shanghai (2006), Johannesburg (2007–2008), London (2009–2012) and Broadway (2012–2013). He is followed by Jonathan Andrew Hume, who performed as a standby (2001–2011) and as a full-time cast member (2011–2016) for the role.\n*Vusi Sondyazi is one of the actors who've been on the show for the longest time. He's been serving as an ensemble singer and Mufasa understudy since 2003 and stays in the Gazelle Tour cast at the present, after having performed on Broadway, Taipei and Las Vegas as well.\n*Ntomb'Khona Dlamini is the actress who served as an understudy or ensemble member for the longest time. She was in the original Broadway company as an understudy to Tsidi LeLoka. After leaving for a brief time between 2000 and 2001, she went on to perform in the American tours. Summing up all this time, she's been in the show for more than 15 years, finally leaving the company in 2013.\n*Gaia Aikman will be the first actress ever to perform as both Young and Adult Nala. She was one of the children assigned for that role in the original Dutch production (2004–2006) and was selected as the leading for the adult version of the same character in the Dutch revival production (2016–2017). Other notable young actors and actress' who have gone on to be a part of the Adult Ensemble include: Lauren Alexandra Young Nala (London 2000) Ensemble Cover Nala (London 2013–2014), André Fabien Francis Young Simba (London 2004) Ensemble (Germany 2015–2018), Jermaine Woods Young Simba (London 2005) Ensemble Cover Ed (UK Tour 2014–2015).\nRecordings\nMost of the show's international productions had cast recordings which are available on CD, including:\n*1997 Broadway Cast\n**The original Broadway cast recording is the only cast recording of the musical that comes with the song \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\". It's also the only cast recording that does not come with the full reprise of \"Circle of Life\", the last four verses of that song being added to the CD.\n*1999 Japanese Cast\n**The Japanese cast recording was re-released in 2011 with four extra karaoke tracks and new renditions of the songs using the instrumental tracks of the 1999 CD. (Walt Disney Records, ASIN: B0058X1C3S)\n*2002 German Cast\n**At sometime after the show's German debut, alternate versions of the songs \"Der ewige kreis\", \"Endlose Nacht\", \"Er lebt in dir\" and \"Kann es wirklich liebe sein\" (German versions of \"Circle of Life\", \"Endless Night\", \"He Lives in You\" and \"Can You Feel The Love Tonight?\") were released.\n*2004 Dutch Cast\n**The 2016 Dutch revival production had a newly live recorded cast album with different instrumental tracks for the songs.\n*2007 French Cast\n**Some time during the promotion of the French promotion, a CD-single containing a medley of the songs \"Ils Vivent en Toi\" and \"Il Vit en Toi\" (French versions of \"They Live in You\" and \"He Lives in You\") was released, with a music video being recorded with actors Zama Magudulela (Rafiki), Jeremy Fontanet (Adult Simba) and Jean-Luc Guizonne (Mufasa) performing and singing the song with natives chanting in the background.

The song \"The Morning Report\" was totally cut, with some minutes of \"Can You Feel The Love Tonight\" and \"The Madness of King Scar\". It is also the only non-English CD where \"One by One\" was renamed due to the language (in Spanish, it became \"Somos mil\"), though the song is performed with its original lyrics.\n*2015 Mexican Cast\n**In this release, the Mexican Spanish versions of Simba Confronts Scar and Circle of Life (Reprise) were comprised into a single song, this version being named Confrontación/Finale.

Mexican Spanish lyrics were translated by Aleks Syntek and Armando Manzanero.\n*Note: A recording entitled The Lion King, by the London Theatre Orchestra and Singers, was released on November 14, 2000 (D-3 Entertainment, ASIN: B00004ZDR6).
