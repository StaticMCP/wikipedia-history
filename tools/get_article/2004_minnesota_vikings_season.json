      "text": "# 2004 Minnesota Vikings season\n\nThe 2004 season was the Minnesota Vikings' 44th in the National Football League. The Vikings finished the 2004 season going 3–7 over the final 10 weeks, just like they did in 2003; however, they made the playoffs with an overall 8–8 record. Quarterback Daunte Culpepper amassed MVP-level statistics, throwing for 4,717 passing yards (leading the NFL), 39 passing touchdowns (a franchise record) and 5,123 total yards (an NFL record).\nIn the wildcard round of the playoffs, the Vikings defeated their rival Green Bay Packers 31–17 in their first ever playoff meeting, making them the second team in NFL history to have a .500 record (8–8) in the regular season and win a playoff game (following the St. Louis Rams, who had beaten the Seattle Seahawks the previous day). In the divisional round, the Vikings were defeated 27–14 by the eventual NFC champion Philadelphia Eagles and did not return to the playoffs for four years.\nFollowing the season, Randy Moss was traded to the Oakland Raiders; he returned briefly to the Vikings in 2010.\nOffseason\n2004 draft\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"6\" style=\"\"| 2004 Minnesota Vikings Draft\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Draft order\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Player name\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Position\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| College\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Notes\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Round\n!style=\"\"| Overall\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 1 || 19\n|colspan=\"3\"| Traded to the Miami Dolphins ||\n|-\n! 20\n| Kenechi Udeze || Defensive end || USC || From Dolphins\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 2 || 48\n| Dontarrious Thomas || Linebacker || Auburn || From Saints\n|-\n! 50\n|colspan=\"3\"| Traded to the New Orleans Saints ||\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 3 || 82\n|colspan=\"3\"| Traded to the Baltimore Ravens ||\n|-\n! 88\n| Darrion Scott || Defensive end || Ohio State || From Ravens\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 4 || 115\n| Nat Dorsey || Offensive tackle || Georgia Tech ||\n|-\n! 119\n| Mewelde Moore || Running back || Tulane || From Dolphins\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 5 || 151\n|colspan=\"3\"| Traded to the New Orleans Saints ||\n|-\n! 155\n| Rod Davis || Linebacker || Southern Miss || From Ravens\n|-\n! 6 || 184\n| Deandre Eiland || Strong safety || South Carolina ||\n|-\n! 7 || 220\n| Jeff Dugan || Tight end || Maryland ||\n|}\nNotes:\nStaff\nFinal roster\n|Running Backs=\n|Wide Receivers=\n|Tight Ends=\n|Offensive Linemen=\n|Defensive Linemen=\n|Linebackers=\n|Defensive Backs=\n|Special Teams=\n|Reserve Lists=\n|Practice Squad=\n}}\nPreseason\nSchedule\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Randy Moss found his groove in the third quarter, finding himself on the receiving end of two Daunte Culpepper touchdowns.

Onterrio Smith helped ice the game away, finishing with 76 yards rushing, giving him 139 yards from scrimmage.

In the second half, the Eagles scored on their opening possession, capped off with a 20-yard touchdown run by Donovan McNabb. Morten Andersen then missed a field goal with the Vikings down 17–9, which the Eagles responded to with a 45-yard touchdown reception by Terrell Owens three plays later. The Vikings finally found the end zone with three minutes remaining on a 4-yard Randy Moss reception to bring the Vikings within 8, only to be countered by a David Akers field goal with 1:15 remaining, putting the game away. The Vikings defense put together a second-straight poor effort, allowing 353 yards of offense. Daunte Culpepper continued his strong start in the loss, throwing for 348 yards, while also being the Vikings leading rusher, finishing with 41 yards.\nWeek 3: vs. Chicago Bears\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week 3: Chicago Bears at Minnesota Vikings&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=September 26\n|time=12:00&nbsp;p.m. CDT\n|Road=Bears\n|R1=3|R2=3|R3=0|R4=16\n|Home=Vikings\n|H1=0|H2=10|H3=7|H4=10\n|weather=None (indoor stadium)\n|stadium=Hubert H.

The Bears scored a field goal on the opening drive, with the game devolving to a slop fest over the next quarter. The Vikings missed a field goal, responded with Lance Johnstone forcing a Rex Grossman fumble, only for Onterrio Smith to fumble on the following play. After falling behind 6–0, the Vikings finally found offensive success, with Culpepper finding Kelly Campbell for 40 yards, followed several plays later with a 3-yard Randy Moss touchdown. The Vikings extended their lead following a long third quarter drive, culminating with a 1-yard Culpepper touchdown run, giving the Vikings a 17–6 lead. After trading field goals, the Bears cut the lead to 20–16 on a Thomas Jones touchdown run. The Vikings again responded, with Culpepper throwing a 63-yard pass to Nate Burleson, setting up a 2-yard touchdown connection to Randy Moss. Rex Grossman led the Bears in their comeback attempt, as he dove for the pylon, and appeared to fumble out of the back of the end zone. A Lovie Smith challenge showed Grossman crossed the plane prior to fumbling, but Grossman tore his ACL on the play, ending his 2004 season. The Bears got the ball with 1:16 left trailing 27–22, but backup quarterback Jonathan Quinn threw three consecutive incompletions, and then be sacked on fourth down by Kevin Williams, sealing the victory for the Vikings. Daunte Culpepper continued to have stellar numbers, throwing for 360 yards, with Randy Moss having 119 yards receiving, and Onterrio Smith having 104 yards receiving, and 94 yards rushing. The defense continued to act as a sieve, with Grossman throwing for 248 yards, and running back Thomas Jones rushing for 110 yards, and adding 71 yards receiving.\nWeek 5: at Houston Texans\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week 5: Minnesota Vikings at Houston Texans&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=October 10\n|time=12:00&nbsp;p.m. CDT\n|Road=Vikings\n|R1=0|R2=14|R3=7|R4=7|R5=6\n|Home=Texans\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=7|H4=21|H5=0\n|weather=None (indoor stadium)\n|stadium=Reliant Stadium, Houston, Texas\n|attendance=70,718\n|referee=Ed Hochuli (85)\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/games/vikings-at-texans-2004-reg-5 Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/26971/HST_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\nFirst quarter\n*No scoring plays.\nSecond quarter\n*MIN – Randy Moss 1-yard pass from Daunte Culpepper (Morten Andersen kick), 14:11.

The Vikings defense appeared fresh, shutting down David Carr and the Texans in the first half, while Daunte Culpepper and the Vikings offense continued humming, with Culpepper finding Nate Burleson and Randy Moss for second quarter touchdowns, giving the Vikings a 14–0 halftime advantage. The Vikings defense continued strongly in the second half, forcing a three-and-out, which the Vikings followed with three Culpepper completions, capped off with a 10-yard Burleson touchdown. David Carr found some success, leading the Texans on two long scoring drives, resulting in touchdowns by Andre Johnson and Dominack Williams. The Vikings seemingly put the game out of reach on a 50-yard touchdown pass from Culpepper to Randy Moss with 6:58 remaining. David Carr continued his career best game, leading two long drives, capping them off with touchdown passes to Derrick Armstrong and David Carr, sandwiching a Vikings three-and-out, forcing overtime. In overtime, the Vikings won the toss, and the teams traded punts. On the Vikings second possession of overtime, Culpepper found Marcus Robinson on a post on 3rd-and-12 from the 50, earning the walk-off win for the Vikings. Culpepper finished with 396 yards passing and five touchdowns, with Mewelde Moore adding 92 yards rushing and 90 yards receiving. The defense ended up allowing David Carr to pass for 372 yards and three touchdowns, with Andre Johnson burning the Vikings for 170 yards receiving on 12 catches.
