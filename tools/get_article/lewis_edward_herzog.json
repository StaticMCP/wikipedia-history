There, he studied with Heinrich Lauenstein, Adolf Schill, Hugo Crola, Johann Peter Theodor Janssen and the engraver, Carl Ernst Forberg. From 1891 to 1893, he was in the master landscape class of Eugen Dücker. Upon graduating, he took a long study trip to Venice with his friend, Alfred Sohn-Rethel. In 1897, he participated in the Venice Biennale. Unlike his father, whose landscapes largely remained in the classical Dusseldorf and Hudson River School tradition, Lewis incorporated a more impressionist style.\nBack in the United States, in 1898, Lewis held an exhibition of his European paintings at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. That same year, he was commissioned by Harper’s Magazine to paint scenes from the Spanish-American War. In 1904, his paintings were awarded a bronze medal at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis.\nAfter 1905 he and his family lived on North Haven Island in Penobscot Bay. During World War I, he worked for the US Navy camouflage unit. He continued to exhibit frequently throughout the 1920s.\nHe died in Washington, while on a train trip home from Quantico, Virginia.\nReferences\nExternal links"
