The Almoravids were victorious.\nAfter the death of Alfonso VI of León and Castile, the Muslim inhabitants of Sintra, which was under Christian control, revolted in 1109. The Portuguese count, Henry quickly arrived and captured the castle, putting down the revolt. The next year, 1110, saw the Almoravid leader, Syr ibn Abi Bakr, subduing the Muslim west of Andalusia. The Almoravid forces had already crossed the Tagus River, making an entry to Extremadura. Henry, however, feared that the spirit of the rebellion would spread to other towns nearby, which they mutually assisted each other.\nSeeing the Almoravid campaigning in Extremadura and fearing another rebellion, Count Henry sent troops to reinforce the garrison of Santarém in early 1110. An important place he wanted to protect. The Portuguese forces were under Soario Fromariges and Mido Crescones. The Portuguese marched carelessly, encamped at a place called Vatalandi, and erected their tents to rest. However, the Almoravids crossed the Tagus, alongside Andalusians and Arabs. Knowing the Portuguese were small in numbers, they attacked and routed them, inflicting heavy casualties. The wounded were massacred. The commanders, Soario and Mido were killed in the battle.\nThe location of Vatalandi remains unknown. According to José Mattoso, Vatalandi is near Santarém. Perhaps in Valada, in the municipality of Cartaxo.\nReferences\nSources\n*Alexandre Herculano (1901), Historia de Portugal, Vol I.[https://www.google.ae/books/edition/Historia_de_Portugal/YbkNAAAAIAAJ?hl=ar&gbpv=1&dq=Vatalandi+1110&pg=PA219&printsec=frontcover]\n*Christóvam Ayres de Magalhães Sepúlveda (1902), História orgânica e política do exército portuguêz, Vol. III.[https://www.google.ae/books/edition/Hist%C3%B3ria_org%C3%A2nica_e_pol%C3%ADtica_do_ex%C3%A9r/TOvTAAAAMAAJ?hl=ar&gbpv=1&dq=Vatalandi+1110&pg=PA313&printsec=frontcover]\n*Francisco de S.
