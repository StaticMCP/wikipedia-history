The title takes its name from the village of Ramsbury in Wiltshire, and was first used in the 10th and 11th centuries by the Anglo-Saxon Bishops of Ramsbury. In Saxon times, Ramsbury was an important location for the Church, and several early bishops became Archbishops of Canterbury.\nThe ancient bishopric of Ramsbury was created in 909 by Plegmund, Archbishop of Canterbury, as part of a division of the two West Saxon bishoprics into five smaller ones. Wiltshire and Berkshire were taken from the bishopric of Winchester to form the new diocese of Ramsbury. It was occasionally referred to as the bishopric of Ramsbury and Sonning. In 1058 it was joined with the bishopric of Sherborne to form the diocese of Sarum (Salisbury), and the see was translated to Old Sarum in 1075.\nMedieval bishops diocesan\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color: #7F1734; color: white;\" | Bishops of Ramsbury\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 10%;\" | From\n! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 10%;\" | Until\n! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 30%;\" | Incumbent\n! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 45%;\" | Notes\n|- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 909\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 927\n| Aethelstan\n|\n|- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: #F7F0F2;\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 927\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 942\n| Saint Oda of Canterbury\n| Translated to Canterbury in 942.\n|- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 942\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 949\n| Ælfric\n|\n|- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: #F7F0F2;\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 952\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 970\n| Oswulf\n|\n|- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 970\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 981\n| Ælfstan\n|\n|- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: #F7F0F2;\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 981\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 985\n| Wulfgar\n|\n|- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 985\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 990\n| Sigeric the Serious\n| Translated to Canterbury in 990.\n|- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: #F7F0F2;\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 990\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1005\n| Saint Ælfric of Abingdon\n| Translated to Canterbury in 995, he continued to hold Ramsbury along with Canterbury until his death.\n|- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 995\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1045\n| Saint Bertwald\n| Also spelled Britwold, Beorhtwald, Birthwald, Brithwald, Berhtwald, Birthwold, Brihtwald, and Britwaldus and variously known as '... of Ramsbury', '... of Glastonbury' and '... of Sarum'\nSometimes confused with Berhtwald of Canterbury\n|- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: #F7F0F2;\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1045\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1075\n| Herman\n| In exile from 1055 to 1058 (when the see was administered by Ealdred, Bishop of Worcester.)
