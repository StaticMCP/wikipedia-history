All changes since the re-organisation of local government following the passing of the Local Government Act 1972 are shown. The number of councillors elected for each electoral division or ward is shown in brackets.\nFollowing The Local Government Boundary Commission for England review (2021 -2023), the Buckinghamshire (Electoral Changes) Order 2023 came into effect.\nThis order covers the legislative electoral district of Buckinghamshire, and therefore applies to the legislative or administrative boundaries of Buckinghamshire.\nLike many counties in England, the broader ceremonial, historic or cultural boundaries of Buckinghamshire date back hundreds of years and may not necessarily coincide with more recent politically drawn boundaries.\nOver time this drift can create significant paradoxical effects whereby large population centres like Milton Keynes are ceremonially a part of Buckinghamshire, but are administratively independent.\nBuckinghamshire Council\nSource:\nBuckinghamshire\nElectoral Divisions from 1 April 1974 (first election 12 April 1973) to 2 May 1985:\nElectoral Divisions from 2 May 1985 to 5 May 2005:\nElectoral Divisions from 5 May 2005 to 2 May 2013:\n† minor boundary changes in 2009\nElectoral Divisions from 2 May 2013 to present:\nMilton Keynes\nWards from 1 April 1974 (first election 7 June 1973) to 6 May 1976:\nWards from 6 May 1976 to 2 May 1996:\nWards from 2 May 1996 to 2 May 2002:\nWards from 2 May 2002 to 22 May 2014:\nWards from 22 May 2014 to present:\nFormer district councils\nAylesbury Vale\nWards from 1 April 1974 (first election 7 June 1973) to 6 May 1976:\nWards from 6 May 1976 to 1 May 2003:\nWards from 1 May 2003 to 7 May 2015:\n† minor boundary changes in 2007\nWards from 7 May 2015 to present:\nChiltern\nWards from 1 April 1974 (first election 7 June 1973) to 6 May 1976:\nWards from 6 May 1976 to 1 May 2003:\nWards from 1 May 2003 to present:\n† minor boundary changes in 2007\nSouth Bucks\nWards from 1 April 1974 (first election 7 June 1973) to 5 May 1983:\nWards from 5 May 1983 to 1 May 2003:\nWards from 1 May 2003 to 7 May 2015:\n† minor boundary changes in 2007\nWards from 7 May 2015 to present:\nWycombe\nWards from 1 April 1974 (first election 7 June 1973) to 5 May 1983:\nWards from 5 May 1983 to 1 May 2003:\nWards from 1 May 2003 to present:\nElectoral wards by constituency\nAylesbury\nAston Clinton, Aylesbury Central, Bedgrove, Bledlow and Bradenham, Coldharbour, Elmhurst and Watermead, Gatehouse, Greater Hughenden, Lacey Green, Mandeville and Elm Farm, Oakfield, Quarrendon, Southcourt, Speen and the Hampdens, Stokenchurch and Radnage, Walton Court and Hawkslade, Wendover.\nBeaconsfield\nBeaconsfield North, Beaconsfield South, Beaconsfield West, Bourne End-cum-Hedsor, Burnham Beeches, Burnham Church, Burnham Lent Rise, Denham North, Denham South, Dorney and Burnham South, Farnham Royal, Flackwell Heath and Little Marlow, Gerrards Cross East and Denham South West, Gerrards Cross North, Gerrards Cross South, Hedgerley and Fulmer, Iver Heath, Iver Village and Richings Park, Marlow North and West, Marlow South East, Stoke Poges, Taplow, The Wooburns, Wexham and Iver West.\nBuckingham\nBierton, Brill, Buckingham North, Buckingham South, Cheddington, Edlesborough, Great Brickhill, Great Horwood, Grendon Underwood, Haddenham, Icknield, Long Crendon, Luffield Abbey, Marsh Gibbon, Newton Longville, Pitstone, Quainton, Steeple Claydon, Stewkley, The Risboroughs, Tingewick, Waddesdon, Weedon, Wing, Wingrave, Winslow.\nChesham and Amersham\nAmersham Common, Amersham-on-the-Hill, Amersham Town, Asheridge Vale and Lowndes, Ashley Green, Latimer and Chenies, Austenwood, Ballinger, South Heath and Chartridge, Central, Chalfont Common, Chalfont St Giles, Chesham Bois and Weedon Hill, Cholesbury, The Lee and Bellingdon, Gold Hill, Great Missenden, Hilltop and Townsend, Holmer Green, Little Chalfont, Little Missenden, Newtown, Penn and Coleshill, Prestwood and Heath End, Ridgeway, St Mary's and Waterside, Seer Green, Vale.\nMilton Keynes North\nBradwell, Campbell Park, Hanslope Park, Linford North, Linford South, Middleton, Newport Pagnell North, Newport Pagnell South, Olney, Sherington, Stantonbury, Wolverton.\nMilton Keynes South\nBletchley and Fenny Stratford, Danesborough, Denbigh, Eaton Manor, Emerson Valley, Furzton, Loughton Park, Stony Stratford, Walton Park, Whaddon, Woughton.\nWycombe\nAbbey, Booker and Cressex, Bowerdean, Chiltern Rise, Disraeli, Downley and Plomer Hill, Greater Marlow, Hambleden Valley, Hazlemere North, Hazlemere South, Micklefield, Oakridge and Castlefield, Ryemead, Sands, Terriers and Amersham Hill, Totteridge, Tylers Green and Loudwater.\nSee also\n*List of parliamentary constituencies in Buckinghamshire\nReferences"
