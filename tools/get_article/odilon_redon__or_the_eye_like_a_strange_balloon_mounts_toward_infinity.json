The film stars Jim Keller and Caelum Vatnsdal as Keller and Caelum, a father and son who compete for the affections of Berenice (Brandy Bayes), a woman they have rescued from a train crash.\nThe film was commissioned by the BBC as part of a series in which filmmakers were asked to create short films inspired by other artists. Maddin chose French painter Odilon Redon, focusing in particular on The Eye Like a Strange Balloon, one of the charcoal illustrations Redon did for the first published French translation of the works of Edgar Allan Poe.\nThe film had its theatrical premiere at the 1995 Toronto International Film Festival, where it received an honorable mention from the Best Canadian Short Film award jury.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
