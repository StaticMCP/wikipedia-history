In 2012, King secured a third theatre, the newly constructed Broadway Theatre in the New York-New York Hotel & Casino on the Las Vegas Strip.

He is also one of the principal suppliers of entertainment to the Casino de Monte Carlo in Monaco .

In September 2011, the show was broadcast in the UK, and countries around the world including prime time ABC2 in Australia.\nIn 2012, King took part in the UK TV show Secret Millionaire, where he went back to his home town of Leeds looking for good causes to help.

Since that time, King has domineered the market in Asia, Australia and Europe with his various theatrical productions.\nEarly life\nDavid King was born in the Alwoodley district of Leeds, the only son of Stanley and Trudie King. His parents were both musical hall performers, having met when his father worked as a music hall comedian and his mother was a dancer. From the age of seven, King was considered a classical prodigy on the piano and gave concerts in Leeds Town Hall. However, at 12 years old he turned his back on the rigours of classical training, preferring to set himself up in business, buying and selling whatever he could get his hands on.   With his sisters Wendy and Linda, he grew up in a musical household, and every weekend family members would gather to perform a family concert .\nKing attended Roundhay School in Leeds until the age of 15 when he left without any formal qualifications to become a self-employed market trader.\nHe sold ladies clothing on Leeds Market, and, later, moved into jewellery retail. He maintained an interest in music and wrote musical compositions, including the musical score for his hit show\n\"Spirit of the Dance\"\nProfessional career\nIn the spring of 1996, King was struggling to forge a successful career in the entertainment industry when he went to see the Irish dance musical Riverdance at the Hammersmith Apollo theatre, London, starring Michael Flatley. Struck by the phenomenal success of the show, he decided to capitalise on demand for Irish dance and put together his own musical show, which he called Spirit of the Dance.\nRiverdance was not scheduled to go to provincial theatres around the UK or Europe at that time but the show had created a huge demand and Spirit of the Dance, which also incorporated tango, flamenco and salsa, would step in to meet the demand. Spirit of the Dance was to become a worldwide hit, and would launch King's career into the international theatre mogul he is today.\nHowever, As an unknown, King could not secure financial backing and needed to raise substantial funds to launch Spirit of the Dance.  . He sold all his possessions, including his car and family silver to raise the money to launch the show.  . King singlehandedly wrote the plot and used musical score and songs he had written and boxed away in his younger years. He developed the entire show within three months and tickets for the first week at the Bristol Hippodrome sold out within four hours. He credits his working class background with giving him a good business head and the ability and determination to keep going when all the doors were closed to him. Despite the continual rejections, King refused to give in, and despite all the odds, went on to produce what became one of the world's most successful dance shows.\nAt the end of a four-month tour of UK theatres, Spirit of the Dance was declared the season's box office winner in Pollstar, an international trade magazine, and calls from around the world for the show began to flood in. King invested the money he had made to improve the show and take it to the US, Australia, Europe, the Far East and South Africa. Within two years, there were 14 companies of Spirit of the Dance appearing in 14 different countries at the same time and the show became one of the biggest dance shows in the world.\nAfter five years of concentrating on Spirit of the Dance, King went on to broaden his portfolio of musical productions. There are currently 25 shows in King's portfolio, all of which he created, financed and produced himself. His shows include  \"Puttin on the Ritz\", celebrating the music of Irvin Berlin, George Gershwin and Cole Porter, Man in the Mirror  - The Michael Jackson Show which celebrates three decades of music from the King of Pop, Michael Jackson  Le Grand Cirque, an acrobatics and stunt shown the style of Cirque du Soleil, drawing on the traditions of circus acts from Russia, China and Eastern Europe.\nKing's Spirit of Christmas show was declared an unexpected box-office hit in China over the festive period from December 2011 to January 2012 and cast members found themselves mobbed by fans on the streets of Beijing.
