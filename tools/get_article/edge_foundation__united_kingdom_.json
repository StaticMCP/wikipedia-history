The trustees of Edexcel opted to use the proceeds of the sale to set up an educational foundation, and formed Edge in November 2004. The trustees of the foundation identified the promotion of practical and vocational learning as the new organisation's primary objective. Since its inception, Edge has invested millions of pounds in practical learning schemes and initiatives run by other organisations, as well as running its own projects.\nReferences"
