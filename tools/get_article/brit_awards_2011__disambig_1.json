The awards ceremony was held on Tuesday 15 February 2011\nat The O2 Arena in London for the first time in its history, moving from the original venue of Earls Court, also in London. The ceremony was hosted by James Corden. Leading the nominations was Tinie Tempah with four nominations. The artists with the most awards won were Tinie Tempah and Arcade Fire, with two wins each. The 2011 awards were billed as a reboot of the Brit Awards format featuring a different venue, a new award statuette designed by Vivienne Westwood and a greater emphasis placed on music, particularly live performances. Whilst the re-working of the show was generally well received, the TV audience was the lowest for five years, with an average viewership of 4.8 million viewers peaking at 5.9 million.\nPerformances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Artist(s)\n!Song(s)\n!UK Singles Chart reaction\n!UK Albums Chart reaction\n|-\n|Take That\n|\"Kidz\"\n|31 (+168)\n|Progress – 10 (non-mover)\n|-\n|Adele\n|\"Someone Like You\"\n|1 (+46)\n| 21 – 1 (non-mover)19 – 4 (+2)\n|-\n|Rihanna\n|\"Only Girl (In the World)\"\"S&M\"\"What's My Name\"\n|25 (+5) 6 (+5) 20 (−1)\n|Loud – 3 (non-mover)\n|-\n|Mumford & Sons\n|\"Timshel\"\n|did not chart\n|Sigh No More – 2 (+13)\n|-\n|Plan B\n|\"She Said\" \"Prayin'\n|72 (debut)\n|The Defamation of Strickland Banks – 7 (+17)\n|-\n|Arcade Fire\n|\"Ready to Start\"\n|did not chart\n|The Suburbs – 14 (+38)\n|-\n|Tinie TempahEric TurnerLabrinth\n|\"Written in the Stars\" \"Miami 2 Ibiza\" \"Pass Out\"\n|40 (debut)\n|Disc-Overy – 6 (+19)\n|-\n|CeeLo GreenPaloma Faith\n|\"Forget You\"\n|19 (+16)\n|The Lady Killer – 11 (+7)\n|}\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"50%\" | British Album of the Year(presented by Roger Daltrey)\n! width=\"50%\" | British Producer of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Mumford & Sons – Sigh No More'\n**Plan B – The Defamation of Strickland Banks\n**Take That – Progress\n**Tinie Tempah – Disc-Overy\n**The xx – xx\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Markus Dravs\n**Ethan Johns\n**John Leckie\n**Mike Pela\n**Stuart Price\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" | British Single of the Year(presented by Alan Carr)\n! width=\"50%\" | Critics' Choice Award(presented by Mark Ronson and Ellie Goulding)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Tinie Tempah – \"Pass Out\"\n**Alexandra Burke featuring Pitbull – \"All Night Long\"\n**Cheryl Cole – \"Parachute\"\n**Florence and the Machine – \"You Got the Love\"\n**Matt Cardle – \"When We Collide\"\n**Olly Murs – \"Please Don't Let Me Go\"\n**Plan B – \"She Said\"\n**Scouting for Girls – \"This Ain't a Love Song\"\n**Taio Cruz – \"Dynamite\"\n**The Wanted – \"All Time Low\"\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Jessie J\n**James Blake\n**The Vaccines\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" | British Male Solo Artist(presented by Dizzee Rascal)\n! width=\"50%\" | British Female Solo Artist(presented by Boy George)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Plan B\n**Mark Ronson\n**Paul Weller\n**Robert Plant\n**Tinie Tempah\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Laura Marling\n**Cheryl Cole\n**Ellie Goulding\n**Paloma Faith\n**Rumer\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" | British Group(presented by '''Dermot O'Leary)\n! width=\"50%\" | British Breakthrough Act(presented by Fearne Cotton)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Take That\n**Biffy Clyro\n**Gorillaz\n**Mumford & Sons\n**The xx\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Tinie Tempah\n**Ellie Goulding\n**Mumford & Sons\n**Rumer\n**The xx\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" | International Album(presented by Boris Becker)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Arcade Fire – The Suburbs'\n**CeeLo Green – The Lady Killer\n**Eminem – Recovery\n**Katy Perry – Teenage Dream\n**Kings of Leon – Come Around Sundown''\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" | International Male Solo Artist(presented by Lewis Hamilton)\n! width=\"50%\" | International Female Solo Artist(presented by Cheryl Cole)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Cee Lo Green\n**Bruce Springsteen\n**David Guetta\n**Eminem\n**Kanye West\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Rihanna\n**Alicia Keys\n**Katy Perry\n**Kylie Minogue\n**Robyn\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" | International Group(presented by Simon Le Bon and John Taylor)\n! width=\"50%\" | International Breakthrough Act(presented by Will Young and Avril Lavigne)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Arcade Fire\n**The Black Eyed Peas\n**Kings of Leon\n**The Script\n**Vampire Weekend\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Justin Bieber\n**Bruno Mars\n**Glee Cast\n**The National\n**The Temper Trap\n|}\nMultiple nominations and awards\nas most nominations and awards]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Artists that received multiple nominations\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:55px;\" |Nominations\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |Artist\n|-\n|4\n|Tinie Tempah\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|3(3)\n|Mumford & Sons\n|-\n|Plan B\n|-\n|The xx\n|-\n|rowspan=\"9\"|2(9)\n|Arcade Fire\n|-\n|CeeLo Green\n|-\n|Cheryl\n|-\n|Ellie Goulding\n|-\n|Eminem\n|-\n|Katy Perry\n|-\n|Kings of Leon\n|-\n|Rumer\n|-\n|Take That\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Artists that received multiple awards\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:55px;\" |Awards\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |Artist\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2(2)\n|Arcade Fire\n|-\n|Tinie Tempah\n|}\nMoments\nAdele's performance of \"Someone Like You\"\nAdele performed her song \"Someone Like You\" at the ceremony with only a piano accompanying her. Her emotional performance was received with a standing ovation at the O2 Arena and the video received millions of hits on YouTube within days. The performance launched \"Someone Like You\" 46 spots up the UK charts to number one, and in the process, made Adele the first artist in the UK since The Beatles to have two top-five singles and two top-five albums at the same time.\nJames Corden, Justin Bieber, and Plan B\nJames Corden made jokes throughout the ceremony which drew criticism on social networking site Twitter. A targeted example was talking to acts in between awards when he came across Justin Bieber. In his trademark humour, Corden said to Bieber \"You smell amazing! How old are you?\". A bemused Bieber replied \"thanks\". Similarly, after Plan B's performance of his hit \"Prayin' finished with a man on fire, Corden described it as a really violent episode of Porridge and remarked \"is Justin Bieber OK? The amount of hair products that boy uses. He could have gone up in flames.\" As the man on fire took to the stage during Plan B's performance, some of the crowd showed their disapproval and booed.\nNotes\n*A  These were released on iTunes as live performances.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/2011 Brit Awards 2011 at Brits.co.uk]"
