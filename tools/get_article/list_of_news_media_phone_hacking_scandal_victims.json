      "text": "# List of news media phone hacking scandal victims\n\nThis is a partial, alphabetical list of actual victims whose confidential information was reportedly targeted or actually acquired, in conjunction with the news media phone hacking scandal. Dates in parentheses, when included, indicate the approximate time frame during which information was acquired. The reference citations, in many cases, indicate who accessed the individual's information.\nThe precise number of victims is unknown, but a Commons Home Affairs Select Committee report noted in July 2011 that \"as many as 12,800 people may have been victims or affected by phone hacking.\"\nIn 2003, a raid by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) was made as part of Operation Motorman on the home of private investigator Steve Whittamore. This resulted in seizure of records, including more than 13,000 requests for confidential information from newspapers and magazines. In 2006, Information Commissioner Richard Thomas \"revealed that hundreds of journalists may have illegally bought private information.\nIn 2006, the Metropolitan Police Service (Scotland Yard) seized records from another private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, and found a target list with over 4,000 names on it. Release of \"the totality of the Mulcaire information\" has not yet been achieved, but has been requested through the courts. Accordingly, \"the seized material included 4,332 names or partial names; 2,987 mobile phone numbers; 30 audiotapes of varying length; and 91 pin codes of a kind needed to access voicemail with the minority of targets who change the factory settings on their mobile phones.\"\nIn contrast, John Yates told the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee in September 2009 that the police had only found evidence indicating that \"it is very few, it is a handful\" of persons that had been subject to message interception.\nIn January 2011, claims made in the suit filed by Kelly Hoppen suggest illegally accessing voicemail occurred as recently as March 2010. Jade Goody believed she and her mother were being hacked as recently as August 2008.\nAs of June 2011, according to The Guardian, \"Scotland Yard is believed to have collected hundreds of thousands of documents during a series of investigations into private investigator Jonathan Rees. Rick Davies, reporter for The Guardian, believes these \"boxloads\" of paperwork \"could include explosive new evidence of illegal news-gathering by the News of the World and other papers.\" According to his sources, confidential information sold to newspapers may have been obtained through blagging, burglaries, bribery, and blackmail, sometimes involving corrupt customs officers, VAT inspectors, bank employees and police officers.\nIn July 2011, it was estimated that only 170 people had so far been informed out of the up to 12,800 people that may have been affected by the illegal acquisition of confidential information . In October 2011, it was estimated that only 5%, or about 200, of people whose confidential information had been acquired by Glenn Mulcaire had been notified.\nAt News Corporation's annual meeting on 21 October 2011, a shareholder asked how the board was conducting its inquiry into the \"thousands\" of people whose phones were hacked by News of the World journalists. Chairman Rupert Murdoch responded, \"It’s not thousands. I’ve not heard that figure before.\"\nOn 3 November 2011, Metropolitan Police, referring to the complete list of full names whose phones were possibly hacked by Glenn Mulcaire for News of the World, said \"the current number of identifiable persons who appear in the material, and are thus victims, where names are noted, is 5,795. This figure is very likely to be revised in the future as a result of further analysis.\"  As of 23 July 2012, the Met had identified 4,775 potential victims of phone hacking, of which 2,615 have been notified and 702 people are likely to have been victims.\nAs of 31 August 2012, the Met had identified 4,744 victims of phone hacking by News of the World whose names and phone numbers had been found in evidence.  Of the victims, 658 had been contacted, but 388 were not contactable and police chose not to contact another 23 \"for operational reasons\".  Of the victims, 1,894 had been contacted but 1,781 were not contactable.\nphone messages had been intercepted to write stories for News of the World.]]\nalleged his bank records and family medical records were illegally obtained.
