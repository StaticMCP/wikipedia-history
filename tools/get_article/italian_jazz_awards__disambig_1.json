The purpose of the IJA is to reward the best Italian jazz musicians, chosen by an Artistic Board and voted on by the audience on the IJA Official Website. The awards are dedicated to the memory of the Italian jazz pianist Luca Flores, who died in 1995.\nAndrea Causi created the awards while a student of the Jazz Graduation Course of the Conservatory of music G. F. Ghedini in Cuneo. The first edition of the IJA started in 2007 along the lines of the American Jazz Awards.\nThe awards consist of four categories with four nominees chosen by an Artistic Board. The Board changes every two years, and is formed of jazz musicians and journalists, tasked with picking four finalists, who then pass to the final phase of the contest: the public polls.\nThe only one of the awards not voted on by the audience but chosen by the Artistic Board is the Honorary Award, assigned to the most important Italian jazz musician of Europe and the world.\nIn February 2008, American jazz pianist Uri Caine was the special guest of the IJA'07 red carpet show.\nWinners\n2007 Genoa\n*Honorary Award: Luca Flores (posthumous assigned to Flores' sister Barbara)\n*Best Jazz Act: Dado Moroni\n*Best Jazz Singer: Danila Satragno\n2008 - Sanremo/Rome/Milan\n*Honorary Award: Renato Sellani\n*Best Jazz Act: Fabrizio Bosso\n*Best Jazz Singer: Larry Franco\n*Brand New Jazz Act: Paolo Alderighi\n*Best Jazz Album: ''It's a Good Day'' - Patti Wicks Trio\n*P-Choice Award: Blue Dolls\nArtistic Board: Freddy Colt, Maria Grazia Scarzella, Melania Renzi, Samuel J.
