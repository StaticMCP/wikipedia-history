The sites include buildings, structures, areas, and monuments of historic, cultural, aesthetic, scientific, social, and religious significance.\nAs of September 2025, Bangladesh does not have an official national list of heritage sites. The Department of Archaeology maintains a national register of protected monuments, but the register is incomplete. In Dhaka, the Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (RAJUK) has published a partial list of heritage buildings and structures, while the Institute of Architects Bangladesh (IAB) has prepared a national inventory of modern heritage sites. Other initiatives include a small-scale list produced by the Hidden Heritage Foundation and surveys conducted by various non-governmental and civil organizations.\nThe Urban Study Group (USG), an independent conservation initiative, has claimed that Dhaka contains more than 2,200 heritage sites.\nRAJUK's list\nHeritage buildings and structures of Dhaka are officially designated under the Dhaka Metropolitan Building (Construction, Development, Preservation and Removal) Rules, 2008. According to Rule 61, the Capital Development Authority (RAJUK), with the approval of the Urban Development Committee, recognizes certain buildings and areas as heritage sites on the basis of their historical, aesthetic, scientific, social, or religious significance.\nFor the purposes of the regulation, a \"listed building\" includes the main structure, any adjoining structures, and all parts within its defined boundary. No listed building or structure may be demolished, reconstructed, altered, enlarged, or modified without prior approval from the Urban Development Committee.\nThe most recent list, published by RAJUK in 2020, identifies 74 heritage structures in Dhaka. These are:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable static-row-numbers static-row-header-hash sticky-header col1center col4center static-row-numbers-center\"\n|+List of heritage buildings and structures in Dhaka by RAJUK\n! style=\"width:8em\" class=\"unsortable\" |⠀⠀⠀⠀Image⠀⠀⠀⠀\n! style=\"width:16em\" |Site\n! style=\"width:5em\" |Location\n! style=\"width:1em\" |Built\n! style=\"width:13em\" |Built by\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Description\n|-\n|\n|Binat Bibi Mosque\n|Narinda\n|1457\n|Bakht Bint Dokhtar-e-Merhamat\n|Oldest surviving mosque in Dhaka\n|-\n|\n|Bara Katra\n|Chowk Bazaar\n|1646\n|On the orders of Shah Shuja, Dewan Mir Abul Qasim\n|Mughal tavern\n|-\n|\n|Chhota Katra\n|Chowk Bazaar\n|1671\n|During Shaista Khan\n|Mughal tavern\n|-\n|\n|Lalbagh Fort\n|Lalbagh\n| rowspan=\"5\" |1680\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Muhammad Azam Shah& Shaista Khan\n|Mughal fort\n|- class=\"static-row-numbers-norank\"\n|\n|Lalbagh Fort'sSoutheast Torana\n|Lalbagh Fort\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Mughal torana\n|- class=\"static-row-numbers-norank\"\n|\n|Lalbagh Fort'sShahi Mosque\n|Lalbagh Fort\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Mughal mosque\n|- class=\"static-row-numbers-norank\"\n|\n|Lalbagh Fort'sHammam &Diwan-i-Aam\n|Lalbagh Fort\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Mughal hammam & hall\n|- class=\"static-row-numbers-norank\"\n|\n|Lalbagh Fort'sTomb of Bibi Pari\n|Lalbagh Fort\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Mughal tomb\n|-\n|\n|Dhanmondi Shahi Eidgah\n|Sat Masjid Rd., Dhanmondi\n|1640\n|On the orders of Shah Shuja, Dewan Mir Abul Qasim\n|Mughal eidgah\n|-\n|\n|Nimtali arch\n|Nimtali\n|1766\n|Naib Nazim of Dhaka Jesarat Khan\n|Mughal arch or gatehouse\n|-\n|\n|Dhaka Gate(Mir Jumla Gate)\n|Doel Square, Dhaka University\n|1660\n----Rebuilt: 1820s\n----Renov. 2024\n|Mir Jumla II\n----Rebuilt by: Charles Dawes\n----Renovation: DSCC\n|Mughal gate\n|- class=\"static-row-numbers-norank sorttop\"\n|\n|Adjacent to Dhaka GateBibi Mariam Cannon(Mir Jumla Cannon)\n|Dhaka Gate\n|1660\n|Mir Jumla II\n|Mughal cannon\n|-\n|\n|Sat Gambuj Mosque\n|Mohammadpur\n|1680\n|Shaista Khan's son Umid Khan\n|Mughal mosque\n|-\n|\n|Unknown Old Tomb\n|Bashbari, Mohammadpur\n|1600s\n|\n|Mughal tomb\n|-\n|\n|Shahbaz Khan Mosque & Mazar\n|Ramna\n|1679\n|Hazi Shahbaz\n|Mughal mosque ও mazar\n|-\n|\n|Kartalab Khan Mosque(Begumbazar Mosque)\n|Begumbazar\n|1704\n|Nawab Dewan Murshid Quli Khan (Kartalab Khan)\n|Mughal mosqueThere is a baoli in mosque, which appears to be a monument by itself and only one of its kind in Bengal\n|-\n|\n|Khan Mohammad Mridha Mosque\n|Lalbagh\n|1706\n|By order of chief of Dhaka Qazi Ibadullah, Khan Mohammad Mridha\n|Mughal mosque\n|-\n|\n|Shaista Khan Mosque\n|Mitford\n|1664\n|Shaista Khan\n|Mughal mosque\n|-\n|\n|Musa Khan Mosque\n|Dhaka University\n|1679\n|Musa Khan's son Diwan Manowar Khan\n|Mughal mosque\n|-\n|\n|Gol Talab(Nawab Bari Pukur)\n|Islampur\n|1610\n|Nawab Abdul Bari\n|Mughal pond\n|-\n|\n|Holy Rosary Church(Tejgaon Church)\n|Tejgaon\n|1677\n|Portuguese Augustinian missionaries\n|Mughal era church\n|-\n|\n|Christian cemetery(Wari cemetery)\n|Wari\n|1600s\n|Portuguese merchant community\n|Mughal era christian cemetery\n|- class=\"static-row-numbers-norank\"\n|\n|Christian cemetery'sColumbo Sahib Tomb\n|Christian cemetery\n|1700s\n|Well Wishers of Columbo Sahib\n|Unknown tomb\n|- class=\"static-row-numbers-norank\"\n|\n|Christian cemetery'sJoseph Paget Tomb\n|Christian cemetery\n|1724\n|Well Wishers of Joseph Paget\n|Burial of Joseph Paget\n|-\n|\n|Hussaini Dalan(Imambara)\n|Bakshibazar\n|1642\n|Shah ShujaFunding: Syed Mirza Murad\n|Mughal husayniyya\n|-\n|\n|Dhakeshwari Temple\n|Orphanage Rd., Lalbagh\n|1100s\n|Ballala Sena\n|Sena temple\n|-\n|\n|Joy Kali Temple &Ram Sita Temple\n|BCC Rd., Thatari Bazar\n|1593\n|Dewan Shri Tulsi Narayan Ghosh, Shri Nava Narayan Ghosh (Under orders of Sadhu Bancharam)\n|Sultanate era temple\n|-\n|\n|Gurdwara Nanak Shahi\n|Dhaka University\n|Start: 1600s\n----End: 1830\n|Sikh preacher Bhainath(alternately Almast)\n|Historic gurdwara\n|-\n|\n|Armenian Church\n|Armanitola\n|1781\n|Armenian community in Old Dhaka\n|Historic church\n|-\n|\n|Azimpur Dayera Sharif Khanqah(Boro Dayera Sharif)\n|Azimpur, Dhaka\n|1766\n|Shah Sufi Syed Muhammad Dayem\n|Sufi lodge & Dargah\n|-\n|\n|Star Mosque(Tara Masjid)\n|Armanitola\n|1860\n|Mirza Ghulam Pir (Mirza Ahmad Jan)\n|British era mosque\n|-\n|\n|Bangshal Ahle Hadith Mosque(Bangshal Boro Masjid)\n|Bangshal Rd.\n|1880\n|Zamindar Haji Badruddin (Bhutto Haji)\n|British era mosque\n|-\n|\n|Sri Sri Bura Shivdham(Shibbari)\n|Dhaka University\n|1600s\n|\n|Mughal era temple\n|-\n|\n|Northbrook Hall(Lalkuthi)\n|Farashganj\n|1879\n|Bhawal Raja Rajendra Narayan Roy Chowdhury\n|British town hall\n|-\n|\n|Qassabtuly Mosque(Koshaituly Jam-e-Masjid)(Sugar Cube Mosque)\n|Koshaiituly\n|1907\n|Abdul Bari Bepari\n|Most decorated mosque in Dhaka.

The main gate in front of the house was about six feet. Then a long corridor of about twenty to thirty feet went inside. Then the buildings extended about twenty yards to the rear.

The list was prepared by the Heritage, Education, Awareness and Research (HEAR) Committee of the 24th Executive Council of IAB, with the aim of raising awareness, promoting conservation, and ensuring proper recognition of 20th-century architectural works associated with the modern movement in Bangladesh.\nThe selection highlights projects of architectural, cultural, and historical significance, designed by both national and internationally renowned architects. According to IAB, the list is not exhaustive but serves as an initial step toward the documentation and safeguarding of modern heritage in the country.\nAlthough the publication covers sites nationwide, the following section includes only those modern heritage sites located within Dhaka city.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable static-row-numbers static-row-header-hash sticky-header col1center col5center static-row-numbers-center\"\n|+Institute of Architect's list of Modern Heritage Sites of Dhaka\n! style=\"width:8em\" class=\"unsortable\" |⠀⠀⠀⠀Image⠀⠀⠀⠀\n! style=\"width:16em\" |Site\n! style=\"width:9em\" |Architect\n! style=\"width:5em\" |Location\n! style=\"width:1em\" |Year\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Description\n|-\n|\n|National Assembly Complexof Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban\n|Louis Kahn\n|Sher-e-Bangla Nagar\n|1962-84\n|National Assembly building of Bangladesh\n|-\n|\n|National Assembly Sectorof Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban\n|Louis Kahn\n|Sher-e-Bangla Nagar\n|1962-84\n|Area encompassing Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban\n|-\n|\n|Housing Type - E, F, G & Hof Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban\n|Louis Kahn\n|Sher-e-Bangla Nagar\n|1962-84\n|MP housing adjacent of Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban\n|-\n|\n|Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College\n|Louis Kahn\n|Sher-e-Bangla Nagar\n|1962-84\n|Hospital\n|-\n|\n|Faculty of Fine Arts(Formerly, Institute of Fine Arts)\n|Muzharul Islam\n|Dhaka University\n|1953-55\n|Classrooms, exhibition spaces and faculty area of DU\n|-\n|\n|Dhaka University Central Library(Old Building)\n|Muzharul Islam\n|Dhaka University\n|1953-55\n|Library\n|-\n|\n|Building 75 and Ladies Club of Azimpur Government Colony(Azimpur Ladies Club)\n|Muzharul Islam\n|Azimpur Colony\n|1962\n|Housing for Govt.
