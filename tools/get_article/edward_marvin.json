He later emigrated to Transvaal Colony, where he played two first-class cricket matches for Gauteng in the 1908-09 Currie Cup against Border and Western Province. He scored 47 runs in these matches, with a highest score of 29. Marvin served in the First World War as a private in the South African Infantry, which formed part of the South African Overseas Expeditionary Force on the Western Front. On 21 March 1918, the Germans launched a new offensive, Operation Michael, during which Marvin was killed in action at Maricourt Wood on 24 March.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
