      "text": "# 1982 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards\n\nThe 5th Stinkers Bad Movie Awards were released by the Hastings Bad Cinema Society in 1983 to honour the worst films the film industry had to offer in 1982. From this point forwards, the Stinkers have not done an expanded ballot on any of the remaining Worst Picture ballots. As follows, there was only a Worst Picture category with provided commentary for each nominee, as well as a list of films that were also considered for the final list but ultimately failed to make the cut (29 films total).\nWorst Picture Ballot\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
