Only Republican nominee George H. W. Bush and Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis met the criteria for inclusion in the debates, and thus were the only two to appear in the debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The CPD-sponsored vice presidential debate took place between their respective vice presidential running mates, Dan Quayle and Lloyd Bentsen.\nDebate schedule\nThere were two presidential debates and one vice-presidential debate.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-†\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE\" colspan=\"16\"| 1988 United States presidential election debates\n|-\n!style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"|&nbsp; || Date & Time || Host || Location|| Moderator || scope=\"col\" colspan=\"10\"| Participants\n|-\n!colspan=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\" |Key: Participant. &nbsp;   Non-invitee. &nbsp;\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em; background: #FF3333;\"|\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em; background: #34AAE0;\"|\n|-\n!

Bush and Governor Michael Dukakis took place on Sunday September 25, 1988, in the Wait Chapel at Wake Forest University.\nThe debate was moderated by Jim Lehrer of PBS with John Mashek of Atlanta Constitution, Peter Jennings of ABC, and Anne Groer of Orlando Sentinel as panelists. Questions divided between foreign and domestic policy.\nVoters were split as to who won the first presidential debate.\nTranscript\n* [https://www.debates.org/voter-education/debate-transcripts/september-25-1988-debate-transcript/] from the Commission on Presidential Debates website.\nViewership\nAn estimated 65.1 million viewers tuned into the debate.\nOctober 5: Vice presidential debate (Omaha Civic Auditorium)\n|venue=Omaha Civic Auditorium\n|location=Omaha, Nebraska\n|participants=\n|url=\n|moderator=Judy Woodruff of PBS\n|transcript=\n|fact_checking=\n|website=}}\nThe only vice presidential debate between Senator Dan Quayle and Senator Lloyd Bentsen took place on Wednesday, October 5, 1988, in the Omaha Civic Auditorium in Omaha, Nebraska.\nThe debate was moderated by Judy Woodruff of PBS moderated the debate with Tom Brokaw of NBC, Jon Margolis of Chicago Tribune, and Brit Hume of ABC.\n\"Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy\"\nJudy Woodruff set the stage by addressing the audience: \"Based on the history since World War II, there is almost a 50–50 chance that one of the two men here tonight will become President of the United States.\" She was referring to the probability that the man elected vice president would later become president, either by succession or by a presidential bid. In Quayle's response to Woodruff's question he stated \"I have as much experience in the Congress as Jack Kennedy did when he sought the presidency.\" Bentsen then responded to Quayle's remark with \"Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy which was followed by shouts and applause.\nQuayle had routinely been comparing himself to Kennedy in his stump speech. Quayle did not directly compare himself with Kennedy in terms of accomplishment, but in terms of length of Congressional service; Quayle served for 12 years while Kennedy served for 14. When Kennedy successfully sought the Democratic nomination in 1960, he had less experience than his primary opponents, most of whom had more seniority in the Senate. While it was a statement of fact, some of Quayle's advisors suggested that this comparison could cause trouble.\nBentsen's remark has become a part of the political lexicon as a way to deflate politicians or other individuals perceived as thinking too highly of themselves. The phrase was almost never uttered, as Bentsen was so nervous that he pleaded with his staff to cancel the debate altogether.\nTranscript\n* [https://www.debates.org/voter-education/debate-transcripts/october-5-1988-debate-transcripts/] from the Commission on Presidential Debates website.\nViewership\nAn estimated 46.9 million viewers tuned into the debate.\nOctober 13: Second presidential debate (University of California)\n|venue=University of California\n|location=Los Angeles, California\n|participants=George H. W. BushMichael Dukakis\n|url=\n|moderator=Bernard Shaw of CNN\n|transcript=\n|fact_checking=\n|website=}}\nThe second and final presidential debate between Vice President George H. W. Bush and Governor Michael Dukakis took place on Thursday, October 13, 1988, at the Pauley Pavilion at University of California in Los Angeles, California.\nThe debate was moderated by Bernard Shaw of CNN with Andrea Mitchell of NBC, Ann Compton of ABC, and Margaret Warner of Newsweek as panelists.\nBush improved in the second debate; Dukakis had been suffering from the flu and spent much of the day in bed. His performance was generally seen as poor.\nKitty Dukakis\nBernard Shaw opened the debate by asking Dukakis whether he would support the death penalty if Kitty Dukakis, his wife, were raped and murdered; Dukakis answered \"no\" and proceeded to discuss the statistical ineffectiveness of capital punishment. Some commentators thought the question itself was unfair, in that it injected an overly emotional element into the discussion of a policy issue; Many observers felt Dukakis's answer lacked the normal emotions one would expect of a person talking about a loved one's rape and murder, which played to his reputation of being intellectually cold.\nResults\nTom Brokaw of NBC reported on his October 14 newscast, \"The consensus tonight is that Vice President George Bush won last night's debate and made it all the harder for Governor Michael Dukakis to catch and pass him in the 25 days remaining. In all of the Friday morning quarterbacking, there was common agreement that Dukakis failed to seize the debate and make it his night.\"\nTranscript\n* [https://www.debates.org/voter-education/debate-transcripts/october-13-1988-debate-transcript/] from the Commission on Presidential Debates website.\nViewership\nAn estimated 67.3 million viewers tuned into the debate.\nSee also\n* George H.
