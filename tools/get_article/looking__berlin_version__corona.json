There's an enormous number of recordings from Taylor in the late '80s (much of it on FMP) and, while this may not rank at the very top of even that batch, it's a quite enjoyable release and one that the serious aficionado will want to hear\".\nTrack listing\n:All compositions by Cecil Taylor.\n:*Recorded at the Total Music Meeting, Quartier Latin, in Berlin, Germany on November 3 (tracks 2 & 3) & 4 (track 1), 1989\nPersonnel\n* Cecil Taylor – piano\n* Harald Kimmig – violin\n* Muneer Abdul Fataah – cello\n* William Parker – double bass\n* Tony Oxley – drums\nReferences"
