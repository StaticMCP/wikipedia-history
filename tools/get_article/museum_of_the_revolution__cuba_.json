The building became the Museum of the Revolution during the years following the Cuban Revolution. The palace building was attacked by the Directorio Revolucionario 13 de Marzo in 1957.\nBuilding\nThe  Presidential Palace was designed by the Cuban architect Rodolfo Maruri and the Belgian architect Paul Belau  who also designed the Centro Gallego, presently the  Gran Teatro de La Habana. The Presidential Palace was inaugurated in 1920 by President Mario García Menocal. It remained the Presidential Palace until the Cuban Revolution of 1959.  The building has Neo-Classical elements and was decorated by Tiffany Studios of New York City.\nThe building was the site of an attack in March 1957 where the Directorio Revolucionario 13 de Marzo from the University of Havana attempted to kill Fulgencio Batista. It was a two-prong attack which included the take over of Radio Relox at the Radiocentro CMQ Building. Both attacks failed. According to one of the attackers, Faure Chomón of the Revolutionary Directorate, they were following the golpe arriba strategy and together with Menelao Mora Morales sought to overthrow the government by killing President Fulgencio Batista.\nExhibits\nThe museum's Cuban history exhibits are largely devoted to the period of the revolutionary war of the 1950s and to the country's post-1959 history.  Portions of the museum are also devoted to pre-revolutionary Cuba, including the 1895-1898 War of Independence waged against Spain, and an exhibit honoring American President Abraham Lincoln.\nGallery\nFile:Museo de la Revolución 2.jpg\nFile:Cuba 2018 2018-02-03 14.37.11 (45952234992).jpg\nFile:Museo de la Revolucion Salón Dorado Louis XVI.jpg\nFile:Museo de la Revoluciòn 05.jpg\nFile:Koep mus rev.jpg\nFile:Pati interior museu Revolució 2.JPG\nFile:Indip war cuba.png\nSee also\n*Havana Presidential Palace attack (1957)\n*Humboldt 7 massacre\n*Radiocentro CMQ Building\n*Directorio Revolucionario 13 de Marzo\n*Faure Chomón\n*José Antonio Echeverría\n*Eloy Gutiérrez Menoyo\n*Rolando Cubela Secades\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.radiotelevisionmarti.com/a/cuando-los-universitarios-cubanos-se-levantaron-contra-el-gobernante-de-cuba/260147.html Cuando los universitarios se levantaron contra el gobernante de Cuba (FOTOS)]\n*[http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/1957/Chicago-Tribune-3-14-1957-1.pdf Revolt in Havana.] Chicago Daily Tribune.
