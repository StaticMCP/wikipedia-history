This treaty was pivotal in establishing a framework for peace and trade relations, while also addressing the issue of American captives held by Algerian forces.\nProvisions\nEnd of tribute payments\nArticle II explicitly stated that no tribute or presents would be required from the United States by Algiers under any circumstances. This was a significant departure from previous agreements that had mandated such payments.\nRelease of captives\nThe treaty mandated the immediate release of all American prisoners held by Algiers without any ransom. At that time, approximately 83 Americans were freed as a result of this agreement.\nCompensation for damages\nThe Dey agreed to pay $10,000 as compensation for property taken from American citizens during previous conflicts.\nTrade rights\nThe treaty granted U.S. ships full trading privileges in ports that recognized Algerian authority, thereby enhancing American commercial interests in the Mediterranean region.\nMost-favored-nation clause\nThe treaty included a clause ensuring that any trade privileges granted to other nations would automatically extend to the United States.\nRatification and aftermath\nThe U.S. Senate ratified the treaty on December 5, 1815, marking an end to hostilities with Algiers.  However, shortly after its ratification, Dey Omar repudiated the agreement due to internal pressures and continued piracy against American vessels persisted until further military actions were taken.\nIn 1816, following a combined Anglo-Dutch bombardment of Algiers, a new U.S. squadron arrived under William Shaler which led to another treaty being negotiated on December 23, 1816. This subsequent treaty reaffirmed many provisions of the original agreement but was not ratified by the Senate until February 11, 1822.\nSee also\n*List of treaties\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/bar1815t.asp Text of the Treaty]"
