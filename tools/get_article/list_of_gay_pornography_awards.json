The list is organized by award and by year for each award.\nGayVN Awards\nThe GAYVN Awards are presented annually to honor work done in the gay pornography industry. The awards are sponsored by AVN Magazine, the parent publication of GAYVN Magazine, and continue the recognition for gay pornography which was part of the AVN Awards from 1986 to 1998.\nThe award recipients are listed below by the year of the award ceremony. In 1998, the first year of the awards, awards were given for that current year's work. Starting with the awards show held in 2000, the awards were given for the previous year's work. For example, the 8th GAYVN Awards were held Thursday, March 9, 2006; awards were given for the movies that were released in 2005. The awards have been held annually since 2000. The current record-holder for the most wins in one year is Lucas Entertainment's ''Michael Lucas' La Dolce Vita'', which won 14 awards in 2007. The previous record-holder with 11 award wins in 2005 was Buckshot Productions' BuckleRoos.\nGrabby Awards\nThe Adult Erotic Gay Video Awards, better known as Grabby Awards, or The Grabbys, are presented annually for gay pornography since 1992, at live awards ceremonies in Chicago since 1999. They have been sponsored by Gay Chicago Magazine, later by Grab Magazine (since 2009).\nHard Choice Awards\nThe Hard Choice Awards are presented annually by online gay and bisexual male-oriented website XX Factor which features news and reviews of XXX Web sites, gay adult films, print erotica and other forms of adult entertainment to \"provide gay and bisexual men with information, news and entertainment that promotes a safe, healthy and enjoyable erotic lifestyle.\" The awards first started for films reviewed in 1994 and just eleven categories, as of 2009, the 15th year, they present in over thirty categories.\nThe \"Dave\" Awards\nOriginated by Adam Gay Video Directory editor Dave Kinnick and backed by the in-house review staff, these awards were announced for the years 1989 to 1994. Kinnick had a monthly \"Video Review\" column in Advocate Men Magazine; the results were posted in his column each May from 1989 through 1993. The last awards were published for the first time in the Adam Gay Video 1996 Directory since the column ceased in December 1994.\n{|\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:30%;\"|\n|}\nGay Erotic Video Awards\nThe Gay Erotic Video Awards were awarded annually for gay and bisexual pornography by the Gay Video Guide (GVG), a pocket-sized newsstand magazine that catered primarily to fans. The Gay Video Guide (GVG) Awards, as they were originally known,\nwere first given in the fall of 1992. Eligibility for the twenty-four awards that were presented in the inaugural year was determined by release date during a period ending in early October of a given year. Magazine staffers made the nominations and the voting was opened up to \"special well-known celebrity judges\". The award show was mounted as a charity event for the Aid for AIDS Organization.\nThe awards continued after the Guide itself ceased publication and were renamed the Gay Erotic Video Awards in 1998. Ironically, 1998 was the last year for which awards were given, at ceremonies held in 1999.\nGay Producers Association\nThe Gay Producers Association (GPA) was a short-lived but significant group of gay video insiders that was formed during the \"heyday of gay video\". Their awards show, presented in Los Angeles in June, was considered to be an \"E ticket\" ride for the industry.\n{|\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:48%;\"|\n|}\nProbe / Men in Video Awards\nThe Probe / Men in Video Awards, also called The Probies, were designed to be the People's Choice Awards of the gay pornography industry. Nominees were selected from names sent in from all over the world; winners were chosen by fans worldwide voting at a website or via mail, fax, or e-mail.\nThe list below is taken from the Adam Gay Video Directories for 1999 and 2004.
