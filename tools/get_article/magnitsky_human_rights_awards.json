Notable past recipients include Boris Nemtsov, Senator John McCain, Jamal Khashoggi, Maria Ressa, and Oleg Sentsov.\nThe event occurs annually in London every November to commemorate Sergei Magnitsky's life and work.

Kara-Murza worked alongside Sir William Browder KCMG to advocate for the adoption of Magnitsky Acts worldwide, but his activism led to two poisonings by the Russian government and a 25-year sentence in a Russian prison for speaking out against Russia's war in Ukraine. In a prisoner swap, the largest since the Cold War, Kara-Murza was freed on August 1, 2024.\nJimmy Lai\nA Hong Kong media tycoon and pro-democracy activist, Jimmy Lai was recognised with the Outstanding Journalist Award. He has been imprisoned for his commitment to press freedom and democracy in Hong Kong, particularly through his work with the Apple Daily newspaper.\nAlexei Navalny\nA Russian opposition leader and activist known for anti-corruption efforts, Alexei Navalny was a recipient of the Outstanding Russian Opposition Activist award. Known for his investigations into corruption at high levels of the Russian government, Navalny's poisoning and imprisonment drew international. On February 16, 2024, Navalny died in Russian prison, while serving a 19-year sentence.\nJamal Khashoggi\nThe Saudi journalist and critic of the Saudi government Jamal Khashoggi was posthumously recognised by the Magnitsky Awards for the Courage Under Fire award in 2019. Khashoggi's murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018 drew international.\nAlexei Gorinov\nAlexei Gorinov is a Russian opposition politician and lawyer who served as a Moscow municipal deputy. Gorinov was the first person to be sentenced under Russia's law against distributing 'false' information about the Russian army for speaking out against Russia's war in Ukraine. In April 2022, he was sentenced to seven years in prison for his opposition to the war in Ukraine.\nFélix Maradiaga\nFélix Maradiaga is a Nicaraguan human rights and pro-democracy activist, recognized as one of his country's leading pro-democracy voices. He is the founder of Fundación Para la Libertad and has faced persecution by the Ortega government, including imprisonment and expulsion to the United States. In 2023, he was awarded the Magnitsky Human Rights Award for Outstanding Political Opposition.\nAssociated news\nThe Magnitsky Human Rights Awards have been associated with several high-profile cases and news stories, reflecting their role in highlighting global human rights issues.\nHuman rights lawyer Thulani Maseko, a pro-democracy activist from Eswatini, was posthumously awarded the Outstanding Human Rights Lawyer Award in 2023. He was killed in January 2023, and his wife, Tanele Maseko, accepted the award on his behalf. During her acceptance, she accused Eswatini's King Mswati of involvement in her husband's death, a claim denied by the Eswatini government.\nIn response to her acceptance speech, Eswatini Government spokesperson Alpheous Nxumalo released a statement on behalf of the Eswatini Government, denying Maseko's claims at the Magnitsky Human Rights Awards:\"The Government would like to categorically state that these utterances are a fabrication of the truth and are part of a narrative that seeks to promote hatred against the King and further perpetrate civil discord, something which should not be tolerated at any platform since it erodes the very existence of fundamental rights which Thulani stood for.\"\nReferences"
