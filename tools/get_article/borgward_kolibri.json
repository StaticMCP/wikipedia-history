The helicopter first flew on 8 July 1958 in Bremen, piloted by Ewald Rohlfs.\nDesign and development\nTwo prototypes were built; they had steel tubing fuselages, covered with metal and fabric and v-tails with tail rotors at their tips. The plywood covered main rotors had three blades with steel tubing spars. The helicopter had a six-cylinder air-cooled Lycoming VO-435-A1B engine, producing 260&nbsp;hp. The fuel tank was capable of holding 180L. The helicopter could be used for spraying in agriculture, and could carry up to 300&nbsp;lbs. Development ended after the two prototypes, as Borgward went bankrupt shortly after in 1961.\nSpecifications\n|prime units?=met\n|crew=1\n|capacity=2 passengers\n|length m=8.3\n|length note=fuselage\n|height m=3.05\n|height note=\n|empty weight kg=800\n|empty weight note=\n|gross weight kg=\n|gross weight note=\n|max takeoff weight kg=1200\n|max takeoff weight note=\n|fuel capacity=\n|more general=\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=Lycoming VO-435-A1B\n|eng1 type=air-cooled six-cylinder\n|eng1 hp=260\n|eng1 note=\n|power original=\n|thrust original=\n|rot number=1\n|rot dia m=9.4\n|rot area sqm=4.3\n|rot area note=\n|max speed kmh=160\n|max speed note=\n|cruise speed kmh=140\n|cruise speed note=\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|range km=320\n|range note=\n|ferry range km=\n|ferry range note=\n|endurance=3 hours\n|ceiling m=4500\n|ceiling note=(absolute)\n*Hover ceiling OGE:\n|g limits=\n|climb rate ms=4\n|climb rate note=(inclined) at sea level\n:::: (vertical) at sea level\n|time to altitude=\n|disk loading kg/m2=\n|disk loading note=\n|fuel consumption kg/km=\n|fuel consumption lb/mi=\n|power/mass=\n|more performance=\n|avionics=\n}}\nNotes\nReferences\n*"
