      "text": "# Timeline of the Troubles\n\nThe Troubles were a period of conflict in Northern Ireland involving republican and loyalist paramilitaries, the British security forces and civilians. They are usually dated from the late 1960s to the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. However, sporadic violence has occurred since that time, with those involved often being referred to as \"dissident republicans and loyalists\". The Troubles, sometimes known internationally as the Northern Ireland conflict, claimed roughly 3500 lives.\nPrior to 1960\nSince partition, the IRA had started a number of operations in Northern Ireland designed at bringing about their goal of a United Ireland. The intensity of this activity increased towards the end of 1941, where the IRA decided to step up its campaign of attacks in Northern Ireland. In response to this activity the Unionist authorities under John Miller Andrews introduced internment and using provisions of the Emergency Powers Act, instituted increasingly restrictive policies in Northern Ireland. This pattern of paramilitary violence, followed by increasingly restrictive measures on the behalf of the authorities came to define the run-up to the Troubles.\n1960–1969\nSince 1964, civil rights activists had been protesting against the discrimination against Catholics and Irish nationalists by the Ulster Protestant and unionist government of Northern Ireland. The civil rights movement called for: 'one man, one vote'; the end to gerrymandered electoral boundaries; the end to discrimination in employment and in the allocation of public housing; repeal of the Special Powers Act; and the disbanding of the Ulster Special Constabulary.\n1966\n{|\"floatright\"\n|-\n|  style=\"width:100px; vertical-align:top;\"| April\n|Loyalists led by Ian Paisley, a Protestant preacher, founded the Ulster Constitution Defence Committee (UCDC) to oppose the civil rights movement. It set up a paramilitary-style wing called the Ulster Protestant Volunteers (UPV).\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 21 May\n|A loyalist group calling itself the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) issued a statement declaring war on the Irish Republican Army (IRA). The group claimed to be composed of \"heavily armed Protestants dedicated to this cause\".See Nelson, Sarah. \"Ulster's Uncertain Defenders: Protestant Political Paramilitary and Community Groups and the Northern Ireland Conflict\", p. 61, Belfast: Appletree Press, 1984. At the time, the IRA was not engaged in armed action, and Irish nationalists were marking the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising. Some unionists warned \"that a revival of the IRA was imminent\".\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" | May–June\n|The UVF carried out three attacks on Catholics in Belfast. In the first, a Protestant civilian (Matilda Gould) died when UVF members tried to firebomb the Catholic-owned pub beside her house but accidentally struck her home. In the second, a Catholic civilian (John Patrick Scullion) was shot dead as he walked home. In the third, the UVF opened fire on three Catholic civilians as they left a pub, killing one, Peter Ward, and wounding the other two.\n|}\n1968\n{|\"floatright\"\n|-\n|  style=\"width:100px; vertical-align:top;\"| 20 June\n|Civil rights activists (including Stormont MP Austin Currie) protested against discrimination in the allocation of housing by illegally occupying a house in Caledon, County Tyrone. An unmarried Protestant woman (the secretary of a local Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) politician) had been given the house ahead of Catholic families with children. The protesters were forcibly removed by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC).\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 24 August\n|Northern Ireland's first civil rights march was held. Many more marches would be held over the following year. Loyalists attacked some of the marches and organized counter-demonstrations to get the marches banned.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 5 October\n|A Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association march was to take place in Derry. When the loyalist Apprentice Boys announced its intention to hold a march at the same place and time, the Government banned all marches taking place that day. When civil rights activists defied the ban, RUC officers surrounded the marchers and beat them indiscriminately and without provocation. Over 100 people were injured, including a number of MPs. This sparked two days of serious rioting in Derry between Republicans and the RUC.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 8 October\n|About 2,000 students from Queen's University Belfast tried to march to Belfast City Hall in protest against police brutality on 5 October in Derry. The march was blocked by loyalists led by Ian Paisley. After the demonstration, a student civil rights group—People's Democracy—was formed.\n|}\n1969–1970\n1969\n{|\"floatright\"\n|-\n|  style=\"width:100px; vertical-align:top;\"| 4 January\n|A People's Democracy march between Belfast and Derry was repeatedly attacked by loyalists. At Burntollet it was ambushed by 200 loyalists and off-duty police (RUC) officers armed with iron bars, bricks and bottles. The marchers claimed that police did little to protect them. When the march arrived in Derry it was broken up by the RUC, which sparked serious rioting between Irish nationalists and the RUC. That night, RUC officers went on a rampage in the Bogside area of Derry; attacking Catholic homes, attacking and threatening residents, and hurling sectarian abuse. Residents then sealed off the Bogside with barricades to keep the police out, creating \"Free Derry\".\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| March–April\n|The loyalists intended to bring down the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Terence O'Neill, who had promised some concessions to the civil rights movement. To this end, Members of the loyalist UVF and UPV bombed water and electricity installations in Northern Ireland, in deceitful false flag attacks, blaming them on the dormant IRA and on elements of the civil rights movement. There were six bombings and all were widely blamed on the IRA. As a response, British soldiers were sent to guard installations. Despite this, Loyalist-Unionist support for O'Neill continued to wane, and on 28 April he resigned as Prime Minister.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 17 April\n|People's Democracy activist Bernadette Devlin was the youngest woman ever elected to Westminster, a record which stood until Mhairi Black's election in 2015.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 19 April\n|During clashes with civil rights marchers in Derry, RUC officers entered the house of an uninvolved Catholic civilian, Samuel Devenny, and beat him, along with two of his daughters. One of the daughters was beaten unconscious as she lay recovering from surgery. Devenny suffered a heart attack and died on 17 July from his injuries.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 13 July\n|During clashes with nationalists throwing stones at an Orange Hall in Dungiven, RUC officers beat Francis McCloskey, a Catholic civilian (aged 67). He died of his injuries the next day. Some consider this the first death of the Troubles.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 5 August\n|The UVF planted their first bomb in the Republic of Ireland, damaging the RTÉ Television Centre in Dublin.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 12–14 August\n|Battle of the Bogside – during an Apprentice Boys march, serious rioting erupted in Derry between Irish nationalists and the RUC. RUC officers, backed by loyalists, entered the nationalist Bogside in armoured cars and tried to suppress the riot by using CS gas, water cannon and eventually firearms. The almost continuous rioting lasted for two days.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 14–17 August\n|Northern Ireland riots of August 1969 – in response to events in Derry, Irish nationalists held protests throughout Northern Ireland. Some of these became violent. In Belfast, loyalists responded by attacking nationalist districts. Rioting also erupted in Newry, Armagh, Crossmaglen, Dungannon, Coalisland and Dungiven. Six Catholics and two Protestants were shot dead and at least 133 were treated for gunshot wounds. Scores of houses and businesses were burnt out, most of them owned by Catholics. Thousands of families, mostly Catholics, were forced to flee their homes and refugee camps were set up in the Republic. This led to more people being displaced, with both Catholic & Protestant families leaving mixed estates & moving to estates that had either fellow Catholics or fellow Protestants in them making Belfast even more segregated between Catholic & Protestant. Protestants also moved from parts of Derry City, marking a similar divide in Derry as well as Belfast. This became the largest involuntary movement of a population in Europe since the end of the Second World War in 1945.\nThe British Army was deployed on the streets of Northern Ireland, which marked the beginning of Operation Banner.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 11 October\n|Three people were shot dead during street violence in the loyalist Shankill area of Belfast. Two were Protestant civilians (George Dickie and Herbert Hawe) shot by the British Army and one was an RUC officer (Victor Arbuckle) shot by the UVF. Arbuckle was the first RUC officer to be killed in the Troubles. The loyalists \"had taken to the streets in protest at the Hunt Report, which recommended the disbandment of the B Specials and disarming of the RUC\".\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| October–December\n|The UVF detonated bombs in the Republic of Ireland. In Dublin it detonated a car bomb near the Garda Síochána central detective bureau. It also bombed a power station at Ballyshannon, a Wolfe Tone memorial in Bodenstown, and the O'Connell Monument in Dublin.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| December\n|A split formed in the Irish Republican Army, creating what was to become the Official IRA and Provisional IRA.\n|}\n1970–1979\n1970\n{|\"floatright\"\n|-\n|  style=\"width:100px; vertical-align:top;\"| 31 March\n|Following an Orange Order march, intense riots erupted on the Springfield Road in Belfast. Violence lasted for three days, and the British Army used CS gas for the first time in large quantities. About 38 soldiers and dozens of civilians were injured.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 3 April\n|Ian Freeland—the British Army's overall commander in Northern Ireland—announced that anyone throwing petrol bombs would be shot dead if they did not heed a warning from soldiers.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|19 June\n|Edward Heath became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom after winning a majority in the general election.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 27–28 June\n|Following the arrest of Bernadette Devlin, intense riots erupted in parts of Derry and Belfast. Further violence erupted in Belfast following Orange marches past Catholic neighbourhoods. This led to gun battles between republicans and loyalists. Seven people were killed.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 3–5 July\n|Falls Curfew – a British Army raid in the Falls district of Belfast developed into a riot between soldiers and residents and then gun battles between soldiers and the 'Official' IRA. The British Army sealed off the area, imposed a 36-hour curfew and raided hundreds of homes under the cover of CS gas. Three Catholic civilians (Charles O'Neill, William Burns and Patrick Elliman) as well as a British journalist of Polish descent, Zbigniew Uglik, were killed by the British Army, sixty others were injured, and 300 were arrested. Fifteen soldiers were shot by the OIRA. After the change of UK Government from Labour to Conservative UK in June 1970 the UK's policy changed & became more open to the local Unionist government's influence. At this time UK Home Secretary Reginald Maudling declared in the House of Commons \"We are now at war with the IRA\". Maudling's statement also offered the opportunity to British Army CO of Belfast Frank Kitson to put his policies, including the use of Counter Gangs into play. Kitson had previously used these quasi-legal tactics with some success in Middle East and Africa\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 2 August\n|Rubber bullets were used for the first time.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| August\n|The constitutional nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) was formed.\n|}\n1971\n{|\"floatright\"\n|-\n|  style=\"width:100px; vertical-align:top;\"| 3–6 February\n|Under pressure from the unionist government of Northern Ireland, the British Army began a series of raids in nationalist areas of Belfast, sparking three days of violence. On 6 February, British soldiers shot dead Catholic civilian Bernard Watt in Ardoyne and IRA member James Saunders in Oldpark, claiming both were armed. Shortly after, the IRA shot dead British soldier Robert Curtis during rioting in New Lodge. He was the first on-duty British soldier killed in the Troubles. The next day, James Chichester-Clark, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, declared that \"Northern Ireland is at war with the Irish Republican Army Provisionals\".\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 9 February\n|Five civilians, George Beck (aged 43), John Eakins (aged 52), Harry Edgar (aged 26), David Henson (aged 24), and William Thomas (aged 35) were killed by an IRA landmine as their vehicle passed, Brougher Mountain, near Trillick, County Tyrone. A British Army mobile patrol was reportedly the intended target. The five were on their way to inspect a transmitter: two of the dead men were BBC engineers, the other three were construction workers.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 9 March\n|Three off-duty Scottish soldiers (John McCaig, Joseph McCaig and Dougald McCaughey) were shot dead by the IRA after being lured from a pub in Belfast. Two days later, 4,000 loyalist shipyard workers took to the streets to demand the mass internment of Irish republicans.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 23 March\n|Brian Faulkner became the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 25 May\n|The IRA threw a time bomb into Springfield Road British Army/RUC base in Belfast, killing British Army Sergeant Michael Willetts and wounding seven RUC officers, two British soldiers and eighteen civilians.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 8 July\n|During street disturbances, British soldiers shot dead two Catholic civilians (Desmond Beattie and Seamus Cusack) in Free Derry. As a result, riots erupted in the city and the SDLP withdrew from Stormont in protest.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| August\n|Operation Demetrius: internment was introduced. Armed soldiers launched dawn raids throughout Northern Ireland, arresting 342 people suspected of being involved with the IRA. Most of those arrested were Catholics who had no links with republican paramilitaries, and many reported that they and their families were beaten and threatened by soldiers. This sparked four days of violence in which 20 civilians, two IRA members (Patrick McAdorey and Seamus Simpson) and two British soldiers were killed. Fourteen of the civilians, including a Catholic priest, Father Hugh Mullan, were killed by British soldiers; 11 of them in the Ballymurphy massacre. Winston Donnell (22) became the first Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) soldier to die in 'the Troubles' when he was shot by the IRA near Clady, County Tyrone. An estimated 7,000 people, mostly Catholics, were forced to flee their homes. The introduction of internment caused a major, long-term increase in violence.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| September\n|Loyalists formed the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). The group would quickly become the largest loyalist group in Northern Ireland.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 2 November\n|Red Lion Pub bombing – the Provisional IRA exploded a bomb inside a pub on the Shankill Road, Belfast. The blast killed three Protestant civilians and around 30 other people were injured, some seriously. There was also a bombing in drapery shop at the same time right beside the pub which injured several more people.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 4 December\n|McGurk's Bar bombing – the UVF exploded a bomb at a Catholic-owned pub in Belfast, killing fifteen Catholic civilians (including two children) and wounding seventeen others. This was the highest death toll from a single incident in Belfast during the Troubles.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 11 December\n|Balmoral Showroom bombing – a bomb exploded outside a furniture showroom on the mainly-Protestant and loyalist Shankill Road, Belfast. Four civilians, two adults (Hugh Bruce, a Protestant, and Harold King, a Catholic), and two babies, Tracey Munn (2 years old) and Colin Nichol (17 months old) were killed. The babies both died instantly when part of the wall crashed down upon the pram they were sharing. The adult employees were killed and nineteen people were wounded. The IRA was blamed.\n|}\n1972\nJanuary–June\n{|\"floatright\"\n|-\n|  style=\"width:100px; vertical-align:top;\"| 30 January\n|Bloody Sunday – 26 unarmed civilians were shot (of whom 13 were killed and one fatally wounded) by the British Army during a massive anti-internment demonstration in Derry. One of the dead, Gerard Donaghy, was a member of Fianna Éireann and reportedly had nail bombs on his person. After a lengthy examination of the evidence in the Inquiry's Report, Lord Saville concluded that \"in our view Gerald Donaghey (sic) was probably in possession of the nail bombs when he was shot\", but noted \"... for reasons given elsewhere in this report ... Donaghey (sic) was not shot because of his possession of nail bombs\".\nThis was the highest death toll from a single shooting incident during the Troubles.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 2 February\n|Funerals of eleven of those killed on Bloody Sunday. Prayer services held across Ireland. In Dublin, over 30,000 marched to the British Embassy, carrying thirteen replica coffins and black flags.
