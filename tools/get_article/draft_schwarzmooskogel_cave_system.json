It is located in the Styrian part of the Totes Gebirge mountain range in the Loser area near Altaussee.\nExploration history\nThe Schwarzmooskogel ice cave was discovered in 1929 by researchers from Aussee, and exploration began in 1938. The Stellerweg Cave was discovered in 1940 and surveyed from 1953 onwards.\nIn 1976, members of the Cambridge University Caving Club (CUCC) began their research and in 1980 discovered the Schnellzug Cave and the Schwabenschacht, which they surveyed in the following years together with members of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Höhle und Karst Grabenstetten e. V. (ArGe).\nIn 1983, speleologists from the Forschungsgruppe Höhle und Karst Franken e. V. (FHKF) in Nuremberg and the Verein für Höhlenkunde in München e. V. (VHM) discovered one of the largest ice-filled chambers in Europe: The Schneevulkanhalle (snow volcano hall), which is approximately 130 meters long, 90 meters wide, and up to 60 meters high, features a snow cone approximately 50 meters high, ice stalagmites 15 meters high, and icicles up to 10 meters long.\nCUCC and ArGe continue to organize expeditions to this day, and over the years, additional caves have been discovered and connected to the cave system, like Steinbrücken Cave.\nDimensions of the cave system\nThis giant cave system consists of 17 individual caves and has been measured to a length of over 137 km (as of December 2024), making it the second longest cave in Austria.\nThe total depth is 1111 meters (as of December 2024).\nSee Also\n* Steinbr%C3%BCcken Cave\n* Sch%C3%B6nberg Cave System\nReferences\n:Category:Caves of Europe\n:Category:Totes Gebirge"
