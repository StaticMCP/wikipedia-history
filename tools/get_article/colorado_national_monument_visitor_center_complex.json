The complex includes the visitor center, designed by National Park Service architect Cecil J. Doty, the Bookcliff Shelter, designed by NPS architect Phil Romigh, and the Canyon Rim Trail, designed by NPS landscape architects Babbitt Hughes, and built between 1963 and 1965. The structures follow the precedent set by earlier park structures by using native sandstone laid in a random ashlar pattern.\nSee also\n}}\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Mesa County, Colorado\nReferences\nExternal links"
