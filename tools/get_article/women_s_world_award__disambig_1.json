The award has been given since 2004. No monetary prize is attached; the prize token has shape of a glass female silhouette. The corresponding prize for men, although no longer observed, was called 'Men's World Day' until it was terminated in 2006. There is also a gender neutral event called 'Save The World awards' which awards equal numbers of men and women.\nAwards\n2009\nMarch 5, 2009 in Vienna, Austria;\n*World Achievement Award: Betty Williams\n*World Actress Award: Monica Bellucci\n*World Entertainment Award: Kelly Clarkson\n*World Hope Award: Nujood Ali\n*World Lifetime Achievement Award: Marianne Faithfull\n*World Fashion Award: Angela Missioni\n*World Business Award: Marilyn Carlson Nelson\n*World Tolerance Award: Claudia Cardinale\n*World Artist Award: Anastacia\n*World Social Award: Esther Mujawayo\n2006\nOctober 14, 2006 in New York City, U.S.A.; awardees include:\n*World Achievement Award: Shana Dale\n*World Charity Award: Sharon Stone\n*World Entertainment Award: Whoopi Goldberg\n*World Hope Award: Stella Deetjen\n*World Lifetime Achievement Award: Susan Sarandon\n*World Social Award: Lucy Liu\n*World Style Award: Claudia Schiffer\n*World Tolerance Award: Queen Noor of Jordan\n*World Artist Award: Mary J.
