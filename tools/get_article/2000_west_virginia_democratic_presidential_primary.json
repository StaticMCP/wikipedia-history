The West Virginia primary was a semi-closed primary, with the state awarding 42 delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention, of whom 30 were pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the primary results.\nVice president and recently determined presumptive nominee Al Gore swept the state and won 27 delegates with 72% of the vote, winning all 55 counties. Former senator Bill Bradley made the delegate threshold with little more than 18%, and Angus Wheeler McDonald, a farmer and resident of Charles Town, West Virginia, who did not appear on the ballot in any other state, received 7%.\nProcedure\nWest Virginia's Democratic primary took place on May 9, 2000, the same date as the Nebraska primary.\nVoting took place throughout the state from 6:30&nbsp;a.m. until 7:30&nbsp;p.m.\nIn the semi-closed primary, candidates had to meet a threshold of 15 percent at the congressional district or statewide level in order to be considered viable. The 42 pledged delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention were allocated proportionally on the basis of the results of the primary. Of these, between 6 and 7 were allocated to each of the state's 3 congressional districts and another 4 were allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates), in addition to 7 at-large delegates.\nThe delegation included 11 unpledged PLEO delegates: 6 members of the Democratic National Committee and 5 members of Congress, two senators (Robert Byrd and Jay Rockefeller, and 3 representatives (Alan Mollohan, Bob Wise, and Nick Rahall).\nCandidates\nThe following candidates appeared on the ballot:\n*Al Gore\n*Angus W.
