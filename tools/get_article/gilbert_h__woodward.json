He attended Columbian Preparatory School, Washington, D.C.\nMilitary career\nHe graduated from the United States Military Academy in the class of 1940 as a Second lieutenant in the cavalry. He joined the 8th Cavalry Regiment at Fort Bliss and then in 1942 he became an assistant Operations officer in the 84th Infantry Division. He attended Command and General Staff College in 1943 and then returned to the 84th Infantry Division. In March 1944 he was appointed as commanding officer of special troops of the 94th Infantry Division. After the war he performed occupation duty in Czechoslovakia.\nIn 1947 he attended graduate school in political studies at the University of Virginia and then served as an instructor at West Point while completing graduate studies in public law and government at Columbia University. In 1950 he attended the United States Army Armor School and then commanded an armored infantry battalion of the 2nd Armored Division in West Germany from July 1951 to 1953. From 1953 to 1955 he was staff secretary to the commander of the Berlin Brigade. He then attended the Armed Forces Staff College.\nHe then served in various roles at The Pentagon and then attended National War College from 1958 to 1959 following which he was assigned to the plans division of Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe.

In this role he led the negotiations for the return of the crew of the  who had been captured by North Korea on 23 January 1968. Following an apology, a written admission by the U.S. that Pueblo had been spying, and an assurance that the U.S. would not spy in the future, the North Korean government decided to release the 82 remaining crew members, although the written apology was preceded by an oral statement by Woodward that it was done only to secure the release of the Pueblo crew. Woodward's statement was:\nThe position of the United States Government with regard to the Pueblo, as consistently expressed in the negotiations at Panmunjom and in public, has been that the ship was not engaged in illegal activity, that there is no convincing evidence that the ship at any time intruded into the territorial waters claimed by North Korea, and that we could not apologize for actions which we did not believe took place. The document which I am going to sign was prepared by the North Koreans and is at variance with the above position, but my signature will not and cannot alter the facts. I will sign the document to free the crew and only to free the crew.\nHe served at the Pentagon again from March 1969 until September 1970 when he took command of the 2nd Infantry Division in South Korea.

By early November, Woodward and his team had outlined how the Four-Party Joint Military Commission consisting of representatives from South Vietnam, the United States, North Vietnam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam (PRG) should be organized and the requirements for an effective ceasefire. In January 1973, Woodward travelled to Paris to participate in the last stages of the technical negotiations. The final ceasefire protocol closely followed the principles MACV had outlined.
