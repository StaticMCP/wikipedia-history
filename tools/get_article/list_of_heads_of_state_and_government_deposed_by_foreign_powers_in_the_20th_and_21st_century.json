The U.N. Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 1441 in 2002 requiring Iraq to comply with UNMOVIC inspectors under the leadership of Hans Blix. The United States, the United Kingdom, and Spain advocated a resolution declaring Iraq in non-compliance with the inspections but were opposed by France, Germany, and Russia. The United States instead decided to act outside of the United Nations framework to assemble a \"coalition of the willing\" and delivered a 48-hour ultimatum to Saddam to step down by March 19, 2003. The subsequent invasion took control of Iraq by May 1, 2003, and Saddam Hussein was captured in Operation Red Dawn on December 13, 2003, although no weapons of mass destruction were recovered.

Libya received sanctions from the United States and the European Union, while the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant against Gaddafi. The U.N. Security Council authorized a no-fly zone over Libya after the Battle of Ajdabiya, and the NATO-led coalition launched air strikes against the Libyan Air Force. After Gaddafi loyalists gained the upper hand the air strikes intensified in what some interpreted as a move towards decapitation strikes while France, Italy, and the United Kingdom sent military advisors to the National Transitional Council. Eventually the TNC gained the upper hand in the conflict, captured the capital city of Tripoli, and achieved diplomatic recognition from the United Nations.
