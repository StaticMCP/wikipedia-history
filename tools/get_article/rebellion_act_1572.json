If any person was to prevent the use of any royal castle or ordnance by the crown, destroy any of the Queen's ships, or prevent the use of a harbour within the realm, then they were to be considered guilty of high treason and sentenced accordingly.\nSection 3 of the act provided that the act would remain in force until the death of Queen Elizabeth I.\nLegacy\nElizabeth I died on 24 March 1603, and the act was not continued.\nHaving expired, the whole act was repealed by section 1 of, and the schedule to, the Statute Law Revision Act 1863 (26 & 27 Vict. c. 125).\nSee also\n*Treasons Act 1534\n*Treason Act 1551\nNotes\nReferences\n*Select statutes and other constitutional documents illustrative of the reigns of Elizabeth and James I, ed. by G.
