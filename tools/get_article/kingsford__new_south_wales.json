Kingsford is located 6 kilometres south-east of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Randwick.\nLocation\n]]\nKingsford is a mainly residential area, situated directly south of the University of New South Wales, which is in Kensington. Many of the residents are students living in medium and high density housing. A large Australian Army depot lies in the east of Kingsford. Kingsford surrounded by Daceyville to the south, Eastlakes to the west, Randwick to the north, and Maroubra to the south,\nAt the centre of Kingsford, on Anzac Parade and Gardeners Road, there was a large roundabout connecting a public transport system to nine possible destinations via a large number of bus services. For this reason, this part of Kingsford is sometimes referred to as \"nine-ways\". Due to construction on light rail, the roundabout has since been converted into an intersection with traffic lights. Kingsford is less than 5&nbsp;km from Coogee Beach.\nHistory\nThe area was originally known as South Kensington. In 1936 it was renamed Kingsford to honour Australian aviator Sir Charles Kingsford Smith (1897–1935), as was the nearby Sydney Airport. Kingsford was undeveloped until a land boom in the 1920s.\nOn 19 December 1936, the coffin of Eileen O'Connor, who was likely to become Australia's second Catholic saint, was opened in a funeral home at 347 Anzac Parade, Kingsford. The body was found to be incorrupt although Eileen had died in 1921. The body was reinterred in the Coogee home of Our Lady's Nurses for the Poor, an order which Eileen had founded.\nIn the 1940s, many Greeks settled in the area, particularly migrants from the island of Castellorizo (or Kastellorizo). Many opened businesses in the area; and, in 1973, they built the Castellorizian Club on Anzac Parade. Kingsford was originally intended to be the terminus of the Eastern Suburbs railway line; but, as a cost-cutting measure, the line was terminated at Bondi Junction in 1979. A new light rail project linking Kingsford to the CBD via Anzac Parade opened in April 2020.\nCharles Kingsford Smith Tribute\nIn 2010, a tribute was created to Charles Kingsford Smith in Gardeners Lane, off Anzac Parade. The tribute consisted of a mosaic of Smith, a mosaic of his plane, the Southern Cross, and a Trans Pacific Mural depicting the Southern Cross. The tribute was unveiled on 11 August 2010 by Mayor John Procopiadis. It was designed by Masoud Nodous; the artist was Tim Cole. In 2014, the mural depicting the Southern Cross was added. The artist was Annette Barlow.\nFile:Kingsford mosaic 001.jpg|Charles Kingsford Smith Tribute, Gardeners Lane\nFile:SLNSW 31768 Maloneys Corner Kingsford taken for LJ Hooker Ltd.jpg|Maloneys Corner Kingsford in 1951\nDemographics\nIn the 2021 Census, there were  people in Kingsford. 46.4% of people were born in Australia.
