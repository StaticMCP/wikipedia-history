The place of discovery of this seal is unknown, and it is currently part of Shlomo Moussaieff's private collection. The seal contains an ancient Hebrew inscription mentioning the name of Ahaz of Judah, as well as the name of his father, Jotham (Jotham), identifying Ahaz as the \"king of Judah\". The bulla contains a fingerprint which may belong to Ahaz himself.\nText\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Text || 𐤆 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤕𐤌 𐤌𐤋𐤊 𐤉𐤄𐤃𐤄 }}\n|-\n| Transliteration ||    l’ḥz yhwtm mlk yhdh\n|-\n| Translation ||(belonging) to ’Aḥaz (son of) Yehotam, king of Judah\n|}\nAnother extra-biblical source regarding the historicity of Ahaz comes from Tiglath-Pileser III, mentioning tributes he received in gold and silver from Ahaz, and from the bulla known as Ushna seal.\nAuthenticity\nUnprovenanced artifacts that originate in the antiquities market are subject to authentication disputes. The authenticity of ancient bullae has been the topic of scholarly discussion. According to Robert Deutsch, an archeologist who is also the antique dealer who sold the Ahaz bulla, most scholars believe the bullae to be authentic. Others, such as Andrew Vaughn, agree that it would be difficult to fake a bulla, but do not rule out such a possibility, and in fact conclude that some bullae are forgeries.Orte und Landschaften der Bibel.
