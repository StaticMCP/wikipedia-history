It was erected to commemorate the 2 million tons of coal produced by the Karaganda coal basin. The monument is located opposite of the Miners' Palace of Culture, and is cast in bronze.\nHistory\nIn 1969, a competition for the best project of the future monument was announced. There were 11 contenders, including sculptors from Minsk, Sverdlovsk Oblast and Almaty. Sculptors Anatolii Bilyk and Anatolii Malkov won. Their project was taken as a base and minor revisions were implemented. Bilyk worked on the sculpture for a year in Moscow. Several years were spent on approvals, preparation and casting as well as installation.\nThe monument was erected in 1974. Images of the monument are often printed on headlines, cards and envelopes.\nDescription\nThe monument weighs 20 tonnes and is cast in bronze from Saint Petersburg, while the pedestal is made of concrete, and is lined with granite blocks. The monument depicts two men, a Russian and a Kazakh lifting a seam of coal, representing the coal industry and friendship between peoples. The stone and concrete for the pedestal was processed in Almaty.\nBilyk's idea for the monument was formed from his impression of the work of the miners. On the 31st mine, Bilyk spoke with miners and made sketches for the monument.\nSee also\n* Miners' Palace of Culture\n* Karaganda Regional Kazakh Drama Theatre named after Säken Seifullin\n* Karaganda\nReferences"
