It is about a South Korean crown prince who falls in love with a North Korean special agent. The series aired on MBC from March 21 to May 24, 2012, on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:55 for 20 episodes.\nSynopsis\nSet in an alternate reality, modern-day South Korea is governed by a constitutional monarchy descended from the Joseon dynasty. Lee Jae-ha (Lee Seung-gi) is a handsome yet materialistic crown prince who doesn't care about politics and feels total reluctance to being the second in line to the throne. Lee Jae-kang (Lee Sung-min), the current king, tricks him into joining a joint military collaboration with North Korea as a means to help \"make him grow up.\"\nMeanwhile, Kim Hang-ah (Ha Ji-won) is a North Korean Special Forces officer who is also the daughter of a high ranking North Korean military official. Both Jae-ha and Hang-ah meet at the joint military training, a crucial part in establishing friendly relations between the two separate countries. Although the two are initially antagonistic towards each other, Jae-ha unwittingly sparks a friendship with Hang-ah and he subsequently falls in love with her. Soon, an arranged marriage is set up between the two and they eventually become engaged. While they attempt to set their differences aside and build a growing relationship, things suddenly take a turn for the worse when King Jae-kang and his wife are assassinated by the devious and notorious terrorist group, Club M, led by John Mayer/Kim Bong-gu (Yoon Je-moon), a mysterious magician who is obsessed with eliminating the royal family and plans to rule in their stead. Now crowned the new King of South Korea, Jae-ha must learn to be responsible and protect the country before it is too late.\nCast\nMain characters\n* Ha Ji-won as Captain Kim Hang-ah\nThe female protagonist - A North Korean Special Forces officer and instructor known in the military to be an \"Iron Lady\" with absolutely no femininity within her. She is the only daughter of the Deputy Minister of the North Korean Ministry of Unification. Although tough and fearsome on the surface, at heart she is a shy maiden who struggles to find her companion for life. After a few incidents involving her and the South Korean prince (\"the archenemy of the socialist state and the people\"), Jae-ha falls in love with her during the training mission. After Prince Jae-ha confesses his feelings for her on TV, Hang-ah goes to the South to punish him for playing with her feelings.\n* Lee Seung-gi as Prince Lee Jae-ha (later King Jae-ha)\n** Kang Han-byeol as young Jae-ha\nThe male protagonist - The Crown Prince of South Korea with an assumed IQ of 187. An arrogant and irresponsible individual who surprisingly displays a lot of charisma. Unknown to many, Jae-ha's arrogance and behavior was a front so that he could avoid having to meet and befriend people - he had difficulty finding \"real friends\" in school once his royal status became known. When his brother, King Jae-kang, ascended to the throne, he assumed that he could live an indulgent \"playboy\" lifestyle for the rest of his life. As his two years of conscripted service comes to a close, he is tricked by his brother into participating in a joint military exercise between North and South Korea, organized by the King and the North Korean Military Command. King Jae-kang also used this as an opportunity to teach his brother a lesson and \"help him grow up\". However, his personality does not sit well with his teammates, who eventually see him as a royal pain.\nAs a means to whip him into shape, North Korean Representative and Captain Kim Hang-ah \"threatens\" him into submission right after their first encounter.\n* Jo Jung-suk as Eun Shi-kyung\nThe son of the king's chief adviser Eun Kyu-tae, he is a South Korean military officer who participates in the joint collaboration.

He is romantically interested in Princess Jae-shin.\n* Yoon Je-moon as Kim Bong-gu (John Mayer)\nThe series antagonist, a magician by day, an arms dealer, a terrorist mastermind, and an assassin by night.  He decides to assassinate the South Korean king after peace talks are established between both sides of 38th Parallel which compromised the interest of his weapons business. He also has an even darker agenda waiting to be revealed.\n* Lee Yoon-ji as Princess Lee Jae-shin\nThe Princess of South Korea. Prince Jae-ha and King Jae-kang's younger sister. A royal by day and an underground rock band singer by night.

He also sent Jae-ha into the team to be trained with the hope of transforming him into one who can be sufficiently responsible as a member of the Royal Family.
