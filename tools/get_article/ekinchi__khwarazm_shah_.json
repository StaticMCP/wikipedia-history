Unlike the Khwarazmshahs that succeeded him, he was not a descendant of Anushtegin Gharchai.\nFollowing the death of Anushtegin, Ekinchi was given the position of Khwarazmshah by the Seljuk Sultan Berkyaruq. After a short period of time, however, he was killed by several Seljuk amirs who had risen in revolt. After he died, he was replaced by Anushtegin's son, Qutb al-Din Muhammad.\nEkinchi literally means \"farmer\" or \"ploughman\" in Turkic languages.\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*"
