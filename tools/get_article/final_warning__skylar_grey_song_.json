The song was written by Alexander Grant and Grey, and produced by Grant.\nBackground\nWhile Skylar Grey was living in a cabin in Oregon, she said that she was coming into a new version of herself. Grey said she wrote \"Final Warning\" in that cabin the same week she had written the chorus to \"Love the Way You Lie.\" The song is also about the same relationship as \"Love the Way You Lie\". \"Final Warning\" took two hours to write, according to Grey.\nCritical reception\nSam Lansky from Idolator'' described the song as \"a skittering midtempo ballad that’s not playful or ironic — it’s just dark\" and compared its lyrics to Grey's biggest hit as a songwriter, \"Love the Way You Lie\".\nTrack listings\nDigital download\n#\"Final Warning\" - 3:41\nRemix Versions\n#\"Final Warning\" (Faustix & Imanos Remix) - 3:22\n#\"Final Warning\" (MisterMike Remix featuring Thurz) - 5:10\n#\"Final Warning\" (featuring Corey Pieper & Nathan Allan) - 3:29\nMusic video\nOn April 17, lyric video for the song was released on Grey's Vevo account.
