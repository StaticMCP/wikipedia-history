To remedy the gaps left by the Book of Song, History of Liao, and History of Jin, he assembled this work from scattered sources.\nUnfortunately, Wú Guǎngchéng does not indicate his concrete sources, making it difficult to ascertain the origin of numerous passages.\nOverview\nThe work is composed in the style of annalistic outline (), modeled on Zhu Xi's famous Zizhi Tongjian Gangmu.  The “guidelines” () are drawn from the official dynastic histories, while the “meshes” () incorporate material from continuations of the Zizhi Tongjian, unofficial histories, memorials, imperial edicts, and private literature.\nIts chronological span begins in 881 with the uprising of Li Sigong () against Huang Chao, and concludes in 1231 with the secretive refuge of the former Western Xia minister Wáng Lìzhī () in Shēnzhōu.\nEditions\n* First printed in 1825 by the Xiaoxianshanfang Studio ().\n* Facsimile reprint published in 1935 by the Wenkui Studio () in Beiping (Beijing).\nNotes\nReferences\n*Gāo Wéndé (高文德), ed.
