Notable fiction stories by Ellis include The Steam Man of the Prairies and Seth Jones, or the Captives of the Frontier. Internationally, Edward S. Ellis is probably known best for his Deerfoot novels read widely by young boys until the 1950s.\nDime novels\nSeth Jones was a prototypical early dime novel published by Beadle and Adams. It is said that Seth Jones was one of Abraham Lincoln's favorite stories. During the mid-1880s, after a fiction-writing career of some thirty years, Ellis eventually began composing more serious works of biography, history, and persuasive writing.  Of note was \"The Life of Colonel David Crockett\", which had the story of Davy Crockett giving a speech usually called \"Not Yours To Give\".  It was a speech in opposition to awarding money to a Navy widow on the grounds that Congress had no Constitutional mandate to give charity.  It was said to have been inspired by Crockett's meeting with a Horatio Bunce, a much quoted man in Libertarian circles, but one for whom historical evidence is non-existent.\nPseudonyms\nBesides the one hundred fifty-nine books published by his own name, Ellis' work was published under various pseudonyms, including:\n*\"James Fenimore Cooper Adams\" or \"Captain Bruin Adams\" (68 titles)\n*\"Boynton M. Belknap\" (9 titles)\n*\"J. G. Bethune\" (1 title)\n*\"Captain Latham C. Carleton\" (2 titles)\n*\"Frank Faulkner\" (1 title)\n*\"Capt. R. M. Hawthorne\" (4 titles)\n*\"Lieut.
