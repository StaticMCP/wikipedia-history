A chemistry engineer, he was a graduate of Mining-Metallurgic Academy in Kraków.\nMadejski made 11 appearances for the Poland national team, letting 33 goals into his net. His debut in the white-red Polish jersey took place on 6 September 1936 in Belgrade, when Yugoslavia beat Poland 9–3. He was also part of Poland's squad at the 1936 Summer Olympics, but he did not play in any matches. The last game he played for Poland was a 3–2 loss to Ireland in Dublin on 13 November 1938.\nMadejski played at the 1938 FIFA World Cup, and appeared in the 5 June 1938 match against Brazil in Strasbourg, which Poland lost 5–6. At that time, Madejski was banned from playing in any Polish league teams, due to a scandal regarding his transfer from Wisła Kraków to Garbarnia Kraków. As a result, he was not associated with any club for a year.\nDuring the Second World War, Madejski participated in various illegal football tournaments, as all sports in Poland were banned by the German authorities. Arrested by the Gestapo, he spent a few months on death row.\nReferences\n}}"
