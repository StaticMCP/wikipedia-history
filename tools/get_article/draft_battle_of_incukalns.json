The whole day passed in mutual shelling. The Landeswehr held their positions, but the situation worsened significantly in the positions of the left wing of the 3 km long front line near the Inčukalns Manor. It went from hand to hand until the Landeswehr Russian Company defending it were driven from their positions.\nThe battle reached its peak on the night of January 1, when the enemy launched a final assault, breaking through the thinned ranks of the Landeswehr. The 1st Regiment, which had been tasked with encircling the Landeswehr, approached the Inčukalns railway station from the south unnoticed. In an unexpected attack, the attack surprised the station's defenders, but then the Latvian Riflemen, unexpectedly ran into barbed wire left over from World War I, and their attack stopped. This gave the guards officers the opportunity to regroup their defense, but the counterattack of the assault company platoon forced the Latvian Riflemen to retreat 2 km from Inčukalns. The 4th Rifle Regiment from the Inčukalns Manor was also repulsed and the battle ceased, but the guards' losses were heavy, including the battery commander and some of the gunners who had been killed.\nIn the morning, as light broke, the fighting resumed. The 4th Rifle Regiment continued its advance towards the station from the manor. Despite the superiority, the positions were held until noon, but in the afternoon as new enemy machine guns began to fire on the left wing of the Landeswehr, indicating that their positions had been bypassed. At this moment, a train headed towards Riga, leaving behind the wounded at the station, causing panic among the left wing of the Landeswehr.\nIn order to avoid an encirclement, the Shock Company, which had held back the entire attack by the 1st Regiment, began to retreat on the right wing. Active enemy artillery fire and machine guns prevented the guns that had fallen into the crossfire being removed from their positions, the weapons had to be abandoned. When the enemy reached the railway embankment, machine gun fire from the Landeswehr held them off from crossing and cutting off the retreat route. It was clear that the battle was lost.\nAftermath\nOn 2 January, at noon,  the Latvian Provisional Government led by Kārlis Ulmanis left Riga, along with the Student Company. Later, on the morning of 3 January, Oskars Kalpaks, with a total of about 400 soldiers, also left Riga.\nOn the afternoon of 3 January the first groups of rifle scouts entered Riga, followed by the 6th Latvian Rifle Regiment in the evening. On the night of 4 January Pēteris Stučka arrived in Riga by an armored train. At around 3 a.m., representatives of the Soviet government took part in a meeting of the Riga War Revolutionary Committee, starting the Bolshevik rule in Riga.\nRefrences"
