The obverse bore the arms of Rhodesia and the legend RHODESIA INDEPENDENCE ELEVENTH NOVEMBER 1965, while the reverse was blank. The medal was impressed in small capitals with the recipient's name on the rim, and was awarded with a case of issue, miniature medal for wear, and an illuminated certificate.  The ribbon consisted of five equal stripes, green, white, gold, white, green. When the ribbon alone was worn, it bore a green rosette to distinguish it from the Independence Commemorative Decoration.\nRecipients\n29 awards of the Independence Decoration were made between 1970 and 1979. Twenty-eight awards were made in November 1970 to Rhodesian Front politicians including P. K. van der Byl, Des Lardner-Burke and the other ten signatories of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence. No further medals were given out until April 1979, when an award was made to Ken Flower, the Head of the Rhodesian Central Intelligence Organization.\nRecipients were entitled to the post-nominal letters: ID.\nList of recipients\n* Frank Eric Barfoot, CBE\n* Thomas Arnoldus Theron Bosman, QC\n* Noel Hugh Botha Bruce\n* Avon Montgomery Bruce-Brand, CBE\n* The Honourable Pieter Kenyon Fleming-Voltelyn van der Byl, MP\n* Gerald Bryan Clarke, CMG, ISO\n* The Honourable Ian Birt Dillon, MP\n* Brigadier The Honourable Andrew Dunlop, DSO\n* The Honourable Clifford Walter Dupont\n* The Honourable The Duke of Montrose\n* Sir Cornelius Greenfield, KBE, CMG\n* Senator The Honourable Phillip van Heerden\n* The Honourable John Hartley Howman, MP\n* Lieutenant-Colonel William MacPherson Knox\n* The Honourable Desmond William Lardner-Burke, MP\n* The Honourable Ian Finlay McLean, MP\n* Senator Stanley Ernest Morris, CMG\n* The Honourable Bernard Horace Mussett, MP\n* Senator Chief M.
