The music was composed and conducted by John Williams, and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and London Voices in February 2005, with orchestrations provided by Conrad Pope and Eddie Karam. The score was Williams' sixth score in the saga. Shawn Murphy recorded the score. Ramiro Belgardt and Kenneth Wannberg served as music editors; Wannberg served as music editor for the previous Star Wars scores. A remastered version of the soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on May 4, 2018.\nThe album would be Williams' final Star Wars score to be recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra and as of 2025, the most recent score composed by Williams to be recorded outside of Hollywood with one exception in Lincoln, which was recorded in Chicago with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.\nA music video titled A Hero Falls was created for the film's theme, \"Battle of the Heroes\", featuring footage from the film. In the U.K., \"Battle of the Heroes\" was released as a CD-single and reached  25 in the UK Singles Chart in June 2005.\nThe soundtrack also came with a collectors' DVD, Star Wars: A Musical Journey, that features 16 music videos set to remastered selections of music from all six film scores, set chronologically through the saga.\nThis album was chosen as one of Amazon.com's Top 100 Editor's Picks of 2005.\nOverview\nThe musical score for Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, the Star Wars saga's sixth installment, was recorded over fourteen days at Abbey Road Studio with the London Symphony Orchestra and London Voices starting on February 3, 2005, and ending on February 17, with one morning allocated specifically for vocal recording.\n\"Battle of the Heroes\"\n\"Battle of the Heroes\" is the theme for the climactic duel between Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi, written upon the request of George Lucas. Lucas wanted a piece that would function as a tragic version of \"Duel of the Fates\" in the film's final fight scenes.\nThe concert suite begins with a soft and tense ostinato by the violas in tremolo. Stopped horns join in to present an initial statement of the theme, immediately followed by pulsing beats with mezzopiano double basses and cellos. The ostinato builds as the harp and trombones make their entrance. Suddenly, the horns, 1st violins, and choir play the theme at a louder dynamic level. The ostinato still plays beneath it all. Twice, the theme is interrupted by brief flurries of chaotic \"action music\". At a key moment, the \"Force Theme\" makes a forceful entrance in a C minor key. After the piece's main theme is heard several more times, \"Battle of the Heroes\" culminates in a fortissimo tutti of repeated D minor chords. This false ending is followed by the viola ostinato again. Solo flute, oboe, English horn, clarinet, and horn in unison deliver a melancholic interpretation of the theme's third over the ostinato, which slowly dies away before landing on the tonic. The timpani rumble as the entire orchestra crescendos into a final D minor chord.\nThe theme is played during the climactic duel between Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi; during use, Darth Sidious and Yoda also duel. At the beginning of the battle, a cue titled \"Heroes Collide\" (\"Anakin vs. Obi-Wan\" on the original soundtrack) is heard. This cue juxtaposes fast-paced variations of \"Battle of the Heroes\" with the \"Clash of Lightsabers\" cue from The Empire Strikes Back. Later in the duel, fragments of the theme return twice in a cue titled \"The Boys Continue\". (This cue is not heard on the original soundtrack, although both of its \"Battle of the Heroes\" variations can be heard in various video games.) After \"The Boys Continue\" (and a short, quiet cue titled \"Rev. Yoda to Exile\"), a cue simply titled \"Revenge of the Sith\" plays as Vader and Obi-Wan exchange blows on a river of lava. This is basically a re-recording of the concert suite on the soundtrack album, but without the extended opening and ending. There are also a few minor differences in the orchestration, and the rhythm of the final tutti chords is different.\nThe music video A Hero Falls has been featured on DVD and StarWars.com. Set to \"Battle of the Heroes\", it contains video clips from Episode III (with dialogue and sound effects). The music video can be found on the Star Wars: A Musical Journey DVD, included with the Episode III soundtrack album, as well as on the Episode III – Revenge of the Sith DVD.\nIn the UK, the theme was put on general release as a CD single and reached No. 25 on the UK Singles Chart in June 2005.\n|rev1Score =\n|rev2 = Common Sense Media\n|rev2Score =\n|rev3 = Empire\n|rev3Score =\n|rev4 = Filmtracks.com\n|rev4Score =\n|rev5 = Movie Wave\n|rev5Score =\n|rev6 = ScoreNotes\n|rev6score =\n|rev7 = Soundtrack.Net\n|rev7score =\n}}\nThe musical score for Revenge of the Sith has received generally positive reviews. Rob Theakston of AllMusic said, \"Revenge of the Sith holds a place on the mantle with some of the classic scores that made Williams a legendary film composer. It's also a fine closing masterpiece to a series of movies filled with some of the most important musical moments in modern cinematic history.\" Danny Graydon of Empire called it \"a triumphant climax to a modern music masterpiece.\" Specifically pointing out \"Battle of the Heroes\" and \"Anakin's Dark Deeds\", Graydon said, \"The operatic finale of this score emboldens the tragic, doom-laden atmosphere of the saga’s pivotal moment, yet is typically brisk and exciting, deftly utilising themes from the entire series.\"\nFilm music scholar Royal Brown was less enthusiastic about the music and its relation to the overall film series, saying, \"By the time we get to Revenge of the Sith it's not as fresh as it was. Not because Williams is doing anything wrong, but because he's pretty much locked into a particular requirement for this particular kind of movie.\" Filmtracks.com provided a similar consensus in its editorial review describing that when \"compared to its peers, Revenge of the Sith is, despite its great strengths in its individual cues of immense melodrama, the weakest of the six scores when compared amongst each other.\" Morag Reavley of BBC Music said that the soundtrack \"strikes back with all the familiar notes. They just don't sound quite as startling any more.\"\nTrack listing\nIn the film they are played in the order: 1, 7, 13, 2, 6, 5, 8, 4, 11, 10, 9, 3, 12, 14, 15.\nStar Wars: A Musical Journey\nStar Wars: A Musical Journey is a bonus DVD included with the soundtrack album. The DVD, which runs just over an hour long, contains a collection of music video clips from the Star Wars film series set to selected themes from Williams' scores. Each clip features an optional introduction by actor Ian McDiarmid, and the music has been remastered in Dolby 5.1 surround sound. This program served as the foundation for Star Wars: In Concert, almost containing an identical soundtrack.\nStar Wars: A Musical Journey contains the following chapters.
