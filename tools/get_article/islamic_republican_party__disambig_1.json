It was disbanded in 1987 due to internal conflicts.\nFounders and characteristics\nThe party was formed just two weeks following the revolution upon the request of Ayatollah Khomeini. Five cofounders of the party were Mohammad Javad Bahonar, Mohammad Beheshti, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Ali Khamenei, and Abdolkarim Mousavi-Ardabili. Early members of the central committee of the party, in addition to founding members, were Hassan Ayat, Asadollah Badamchiyan, Abdullah Jasbi, Mir Hossein Mousavi, Habibollah Askar Oladi, Sayyed Mahmoud Kashani, Mahdi Araghi, and Ali Derakhshan. The party had three general secretaries: Beheshti, Bahonar and Khamenei.\nThe party has been said to be distinguished by \"its strong clerical component, its loyalty to Khomeini, its strong animosity to the liberal political movements, and its tendency to support the revolutionary organizations\", such as the komiteh.  Policies it supported included the state takeover of large capital enterprises, the establishment of an Islamic cultural and university system, and programs to assist the poor. These revolutionary ayatollahs originally used the party to form a monopoly over the post-revolutionary theocratic Iranian state. In its struggle with civilian opponents, the party made use of its ties to the Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollah.\nSecretaries-general\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:100%; line-height:16px;\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Tenure\n!Ref\n|-\n||Mohammad Beheshti\n||1979–1981\n||\n|-\n||Mohammad Javad Bahonar\n||1981\n||\n|-\n||Ali Khamenei\n||1981–1987\n||\n|}\nCauses of its dissolution\n, 1983]]\nIn the late 1980s, factionalism in the IRP intensified, the major issues being the Iran-Iraq War, whether to open up to foreign countries or remain isolated, and economic policies. Because all rival parties had been banned, the party \"did almost nothing and had little incentive to.\" According to Ahmad Mneisi,\"While unanimous on the idea of a theological state and united under the umbrella of one party, the Islamic Republican Party (IRP), [the religious right] differed on a number of issues, such as the extent to which religion is to take hold of political life (the Velayat-e Faqih debate).\nDaniel Brumberg argued that the IRP was dissolved to weaken popular Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi, as the party had become a stronghold of radical activism backing him in his dispute with President Ali Khamenei. Another report states that it was dissolved in May 1987 due to internal conflicts, and the party was disbanded upon joint proposal of Rafsanjani and  Khamenei on 2 May 1987 when their proposal was endorsed by Khomeini.\n1983 congress\nThe party held its first congress in May 1983 and the members elected the 30-members central council as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%;\"\n! #\n!
