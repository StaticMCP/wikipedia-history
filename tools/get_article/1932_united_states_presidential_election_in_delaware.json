Roosevelt\n| after_party = Democratic Party (United States)\n}}\nThe 1932 United States presidential election in Delaware took place on November 8, 1932, as part of the 1932 United States presidential election which was held throughout all contemporary 48 states. Voters chose three representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nDelaware voted for the Republican nominee, incumbent President Herbert Hoover of California, over the Democratic nominee, Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt of New York. Hoover's running mate was incumbent Vice President Charles Curtis of Kansas, while Roosevelt ran with incumbent Speaker of the House John Nance Garner of Texas.\nHoover won the state by a narrow margin of 2.44%, making Delaware one of the only six states (the other five being Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Vermont) which voted to re-elect the embattled Republican incumbent president, who was widely unpopular over his failure to adequately address the Great Depression. With 50.55% of the popular vote. it was his fourth strongest state in the nation after Vermont, Maine, and neighboring Pennsylvania.\nAs of 2023, this is the most recent time that a Democrat won the presidency without carrying New Castle County. This election marks one of three times in the 20th century that the state voted for the losing candidate, along with 1916 and 1948.\nResults\n}}\nResults by county\n{| width=\"60%\"  class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"| County\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Herbert HooverRepublican\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Franklin D.
