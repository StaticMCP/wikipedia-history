The Palace was made of tree branches, but moated and hung with tapestry and silk inside with glass windows and the lavish food for three days cost £1000. When the royal party left, the Earl's Highland men burnt the lodging to the astonishment of the Italian Papal envoy present who was told that this was local custom. The king's bed was carried to Atholl for seven days in August and September 1532. The trip may also have been in part to adjudicate on local issues.\nIn July 1536, James V granted the Earl a free barony of the lands of Glenlochy in Perthshire. The Earl was involved in promoting royal rule in Perthshire. He became involved in the Campbell family struggle with the MacGregors, and in October 1530 expelled the MacGregors from the house of the Isle of Loch Rannoch. The Earl was also a rival of the Menzies family who held lands in the same region.\nJohn Stewart died in 1542, possibly from a fever caught during the military campaign on the English border that lead to the Battle of Solway Moss.\nMarriages and children\nHe married Grizzel Rattray and was succeeded as Earl by their son John Stewart, 4th Earl of Atholl.\nIn 1542 he married Jean Forbes, a daughter of John Forbes, 6th Lord Forbes and Elizabeth Berlay. Their daughter Barbara Stewart married James Menzies of Weem. Another daughter, Margaret Stewart, married John Grant of Freuchie.\nReferences"
