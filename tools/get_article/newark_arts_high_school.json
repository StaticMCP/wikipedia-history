The school is located in the University Heights section of Newark. Starting in 2011-12, the 7th graders of William Brown Academy were housed there as that school's facility was being constructed.\nAs of the 2023–24 school year, the school had an enrollment of 598 students and 53.5 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 11.2:1. There were 341 students (57.0% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 37 (6.2% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.\nAwards, recognition and rankings\nThe school was the 248th-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 339 schools statewide in New Jersey Monthly magazine's September 2014 cover story on the state's \"Top Public High Schools\", using a new ranking methodology. The school had been ranked 240th in the state of 328 schools in 2012, after being ranked 205th in 2010 out of 322 schools listed. The magazine ranked the school 154th in 2008 out of 316 schools. The school was ranked 186th in the magazine's September 2006 issue, which surveyed 316 schools across the state.\nHistory\nArts High School opened its doors to students in September 1931 as the first public high school in the United States specializing in the visual and performing arts.\nBy the mid-1970s, Arts High School faced challenges from budget cuts affecting public schools in general, and those of the older cities in particular. The school also faced competition from other districts, such as the Montclair Public Schools in the suburban portion of Essex County, that was starting a high school magnet arts program of its own.\nIn 1983, Newark voters approved by referendum a $62.6 million bond package, which included $8 million to be used for a renovation and expansion project at Arts High School. After an 18-month-long renovation project, the school reopened in January 1996, with the addition of drama and science laboratories, and a preserved Art Deco-style auditorium.\nDuring 2006-07, Arts High School celebrated its 75th anniversary in year-long events.  The celebrations began in October 2006 with a 75th Anniversary Gala and Alumni Day. In December, 2006, sponsored by the Arts High Consortium at the Newark Museum, the first Arts High Hall of Fame was established by President of Arts High Consortium Volora Howell and Willie Cole; notable inductees include Fashion Designer, Steven Burrows; Dancer/Choreographer, Savion Glover; and Singer/Actress Melba Moore.  The finale, featuring \"Savion Glover and Friends\" celebrating National Tap Dance Day was held on Friday, May 25, 2007 in the school's auditorium.  Mr. Glover, the choreographer for \"Happy Feet\", as a special treat, performed with some of Arts' students as they accompanied him on drums. Other activities included an art exhibit, fashion show, and student essay contest-\"Arts High School is 75 years old! How have your experiences at Arts High School enriched your life both personally and socially?\"\nUntil 1997, the Arts High School also housed the Newark School of Fine and Industrial Arts, a post-secondary vocational school that focused on arts education.\nAthletics\nThe Arts High School Jaguars compete in the Super Essex Conference, which includes public and private high schools in Essex County, following a reorganization of sports leagues in Northern New Jersey by the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA). Prior to the NJSIAA's 2010 realignment, the school had competed as part of the Colonial Hills Conference. With 476 students in grades 10-12, the school was classified by the NJSIAA for the 2019–20 school year as Group I for most athletic competition purposes, which included schools with an enrollment of 75 to 476 students in that grade range.\nSports offered include volleyball, basketball, softball and baseball.\nThe girls indoor relay team won the Group I state championship in 1989-1991. The boys team won the Group I title in 1990 and 1993.\nAdministration\nThe principal is Regina Sharpe.
