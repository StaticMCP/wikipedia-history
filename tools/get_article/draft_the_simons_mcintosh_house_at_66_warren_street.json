The property at that time consisted of a 2- ½ story wood frame Charleston Single house in the Greek Revival style, a 2-story detached kitchen house, and a 2-story structure to the rear corner of the property (possibly initially intended as a carriage house) and a single-story smoke house. The second property deed shows the transfer of 66 Warren Street to physician Dr. J. Hume Simon. Dr. Simsons purchased the newly constructed home upon its completion for himself, wife Eliza and their five children Constance, Sedwick, Alice, Elise, Thomas, and mother-in-law Eliza M. Wigfall. He paid a sum of $5,400 for the property. As documented in several newspaper advertisements, in January of 1855 Dr. Simons moved his private medical school for young gentlemen from Society Street to his Warren Street property. References have also been found that he provided room and board to a limited number of his students as well. According to the 1860 U.S. Census, Dr. Simons owned three enslaved individuals and mother-in-law Eliza M. Wigfall owned seven enslaved individuals, possibly some living on the property as well. In addition to being an educator, according to the Charleston Orphanage records Dr. Simons was known to have been an attending physician and apothecary at the nearby Orphanage. Dr. Simons was also well known for his book titled “The Planters Guide and Family Book of Medicine for the Instruction and Use of Planters, Families, Country People and All Other who May Be Out of the Reach of Physicians, Or Unable to Employ Them” which was originally published in 1848 and still in print today. With the onset of the war, newspaper advertisements document that in 1862 66 Warren Street took on an additional role as a recruiting office for the confederacy which was ran by the doctor. Military rosters show that Dr. Simons went on to become a Confederate Captain of the Miles Grenadiers, aka Marion’s Artillery. Being away during the war and with Charleston under siege, and likely fearing for his family’s safety, Dr. Simons with the help of his brother Keating sold 66 Warren. A deed show his brother being the agent acting in his behalf. As per Wilmington Delaware records, he relocated his family to Wilmington. Wilmington marriage records show that it was shortly after that daughter Elise married Francis Gurney DuPont of the modern-day DuPont Corporation. None of the other four children ever married. Records show that in 1865 Dr. Simons received a presidential pardon by President Andrew Johnson for his participation in the Civil war against the U.S. government. The family eventually returned to Charleston where Dr. Simons resumed his career as a physician and educator. Cemetery records show that all the Simons family members, apart from Dr. Simons and daughter Elise, are buried at the Cathedral of Saint Luke and Saint John on Coming Street, a short half of a block from their Warren Street home. The family plot is located in the southeast corner of the graveyard. For unknown reasons, upon his death in 1876, Dr. Simons was buried in a Huguenot cemetery in Saint Augustine Florida.\nThe Mertins Family (1864-1873)\nAccording to a property deed dated 1864, the property was next purchased by Joseph Mertens for $27,800. He and his wife Wilhelminne operated a boot and shoe store on King Street, according to advertisements in the newspaper. None of the city directories list the Mertens as having ever lived there. A May 10, 1867 Charleston Courier advertisement ran advertising the property for rent. It is assumed the property was a rental property for the Mertens. Upon Joseph’s death Wilhelminne sold the property.\nThe McIntosh/Minnis Family (1864-1920)\nAn 1873 deed shows the property changing ownership from Wilhelminne Mertins to Jane McKinlay McIntosh. Her husband William R McIntosh, a clerk for the South Carolina Railroad, is not listed on the deed. Records show that Jane and William resided at the property with their four children, Isabella, Georgina, Kate, and Willie. According to the Preservation Society of Charleston archives, in 1874 a Jane MacIntosh purchased the vacant lot next door at 68 Warren Street and built a two-story Charleston Single House. Could this be a scrivener’s error and both Janes be the same person? None of the Charleston City Directories show anyone by the name McIntosh or MacIntosh as ever living there. Also, none of the directories show a Jane MacIntosh as ever even residing anywhere in Charleston. Speculation might say that Jane McIntosh built the house next door as an investment property. Based upon the 1888 Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps, it is believed that it was during the McIntosh/Minnis ownership that the area between the main house and kitchen house was infilled with the present-day two-story hyphen. It is interesting that the 1888 Sanborn Maps show the building at the rear of the property labeled as the kitchen house, an atypical location being situated so far from the main house. Although speculative, perhaps the original owner Dr. Simons, upon purchase of the property, repurposed the intended kitchen house into classroom space for his school and relocated the kitchen to the rear building. The 1872 Dries View Map Shows the 2-½ story main residence and two sizable structures to its rear. One support structure being a 2-story building existing today in a typical kitchen house configuration (typically located directly to the rear of and in line with the main house), and the other being a 2-story support structure at the rear of the property which is no longer in existence today. It is believed that the last remnants of it were removed sometimes in the late 1980s or early 1990s. According to death records, on December 30, 1896, William McIntosh dies and is buried at Magnolia Cemetery on the upper peninsula. Newspaper death notices note that his funeral was held at 66 Warren Street. A note in the paper’s society column tells of a wedding at 66 Warren Street where on October 1906 daughter Isabel marries John Henry Minnis, Vice President of Minnis Stove Company. According to city directories, as a couple the Minnis’ took up residence at 66 Warren Street with Jane and her other three children. Death records show that two years later Isabel and John had a son John H. Minnis, Jr who died at the age of one year. Infant John is also buried in Magnolia Cemetery.\nIsabella seemed to travel in Charleston’s social circles judging by the numerous mentions of her parties in the society column. A deed shows that in 1908 Jane McIntosh transferred the property and its three mortgages to daughter Isabel Mcintosh. City directories show that in 1915 Jane McIntosh along with her daughter, son-in-law and children moved from Warren Street to 60 Huger Street to the newly fashionable suburb of Hampton Park Terrace. Jane would continue to live with the couple until her death on July 16, 1923. She is also buried at Magnolia Cemetery along with her husband and grandson according to cemetery records. It appears by numerous advertisements showing the property available for rent, Isabella used 66 Warren as rental property for the next five years until its sale. The McIntosh/Minnis family owned the property for a total of forty-seven years, the family to own the property for the longest period.\nThe Whiston Family (1920-1964)\nThe next property deed shows that in 1920 the property once again changed ownership and is purchased by Jane Whiston. According to a letter found, she and her husband George moved from Panama where George had several years earlier been involved with the construction of the Panama Canal. George was to be stationed at the Charleston Naval Base upon their arrival. The two youngest of their six children came with them. Death records show that Jane Whiston passed away in 1936. George went on to marry his second wife Iola and sired two more children in his sixties. Under the Whiston’s ownership the property went from being a single-family residence to a ten-unit tenement building. This is documented by the city directories over the period of ownership by the family. Also, literally hundreds of newspaper advertisements advertising apartments for rent document this. That would lead one to believe that it was during the Whiston’s ownership in which all the piazzas were enclosed and the many sizable and disorderly additions were made. According to numerous newspaper advertisements, over a period of several years George repeatedly tried to sell the derelict property. A deed shows that the property finally sold in 1964 upon George’s death for a paltry sum of $9,700. This was $18,100 less than Dr. J. Hume Simons sold it for one-hundred years earlier in 1864. The property had remained in the Whiston family for forty-four years.\nMultiple Investment Owners (1964-1989)\nA series of deeds document that from this point on the property went through four more owners, none of whom owned it for more than a few years and none of whom lived there. It was not until 1979 when an investor, Hillyer Rudisill, purchased the property were there any meaningful improvements made. It was at this time most of the haphazard additions were removed and the property was taken from the ten apartments down to four. Three were in the main house and one in the kitchen house. Early building permit advertisement in the newspaper document this. But even then, it was more of a halfhearted renovation than a restoration. Again, the property went on to change hands three times again ending up in foreclosure by First Federal Savings and Loan.\nThe Wallace Family (1989-2022)\nA deed shows that John and Kay Wallace acquired the property next in 1979, just two weeks prior to the arrival of Hurricane Hugo. According to Board of Architectural review records it was around this time that sadly 66 Warren Street’s original slate roof was replaced with an asphalt shingle roof. It was the Wallace’s who breathed life back into 66 Warren Street giving it its first proper restoration. It was under their stewardship that the property was reduced from four units to two units, one in the main house and one in the kitchen house. The Wallace’s were awarded a Carolopolis Award for their restoration in 1992. The Wallace’s owned and lived in the property for thirty-three years.\nThe Turner/Vasques Family (2022-2024)\nA deed shows that in the spring of 2022, the present couple William Turner and Manuel Vasquez purchased the property. They have embarked on a second renovation/restoration. So far, the 2nd floor piazza’s forward bay has been reopened, significant structural work performed on both the upper piazza and foundation, rot repairs, painting, the addition of twenty-four pairs of shutters and numerous other repairs and renovations performed. Further improvements such as the reintroduction of the long- removed piazza screen wall, its door and surround are also planned. Never truly believing in ghost, since visiting the graves of the original Simons family the owners have had two ghost sightings and several unexplained disturbances in the house. Perhaps one of the Simons decided to hitch a ride back to their home.\nThe Royal Family (2025–present)\nIn the summer of 2025, the property was purchased by Josh and Elizabeth Royal and their two children. Josh Royal, a Charleston native with multi-generational ties to the city, is the chief executive officer of the downtown accounting firm [http://Accountally.com Accountally]. Elizabeth Royal is an interior designer whose work spans the Lowcountry region. The Royal family has expressed a commitment to historic preservation in Charleston. They are supporters of the Historic Charleston Foundation and the Charleston Parks Conservancy, organizations dedicated to maintaining the city’s architectural heritage and public landscapes. Their stated intention is to act as stewards of the property and to contribute to the broader preservation of Charleston’s historic character.\nReferences"
