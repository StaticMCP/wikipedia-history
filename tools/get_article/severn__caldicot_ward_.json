The Severn ward elects or co-opts three town councillors to the town council .\nA by-election took place on 20 May 2010 when long-standing Plaid Cymru town councillor, Joanne Daniels, was disqualified after failing to attend meetings for six months. She blamed this on her international work commitments. Labour Party candidate Alun Lloyd won the by-election by just 8 votes more than his Plaid Cymru rival.\nCounty Council elections\nSevern is a county electoral ward for elections to Monmouthshire County Council. At the 1995 and 1999 elections the ward elected two Labour Party county councillors. From the 2004 elections representation was reduced to one councillor.
