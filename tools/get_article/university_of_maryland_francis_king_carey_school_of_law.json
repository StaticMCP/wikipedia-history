It is located in Baltimore, Maryland. Founded in 1816, it is one of the oldest law schools in the United States.\nThe law school is fully accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA). It is a member of the Association of American Law Schools and has a chapter of the Order of the Coif honor society.\nHistory\nMaryland Law was founded in 1816 as the Maryland Law Institute. David Hoffman is credited with founding the institute, and in 1817, he published his legal course Hoffman's Course of Legal Study. The school began regular instruction in 1824, and it is the fourth oldest law school in the United States. After the law school denied admission to black applicant Donald Gaines Murray on account of his race, in 1936 the Maryland Court of Appeals ruled that the law school must admit him in the case of Murray v. Pearson.\nIn 2002, the law school moved into a facility in downtown Baltimore near the Inner Harbor and Oriole Park at Camden Yards.\nIn 2011, the University of Maryland School of Law received a  donation from the W.P. Carey Foundation, the largest gift in the law school's history. In response, the law school changed its name to the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law.\nStudent body\nMaryland Law has approximately 650 students enrolled in its Juris Doctor (J.D.) program. The racial makeup of students in the J.D. program is approximately , with about 30% identifying as a minority race (and the remainder are unknown or did not specify). Around 72% of J.D. students are under 25 years old. There are more than 40 student organizations, four specialized legal centers, and five law journals.\nIn 2019, Maryland Law enrolled 205 students into its first-year J.D. class, including 179 full-time students and 26 part-time students. The median LSAT score was 160, and the median undergraduate GPA was 3.66. The law school accepted approximately 36% of its applicants.\nRankings\nThe law school was ranked 51st by the U.S. News & World Report in 2023-2024. The 2023 edition ranked Maryland Law 6th in part-time programs, 6th in health care law, 13th in environmental law, 12th in dispute resolution, and 8th in clinical training.\nBar passage and employment outcomes\nAccording to Maryland Law's official data reported to the American Bar Association, approximately 77% of Maryland Law graduates who took the bar exam for the first time in 2019 passed. In addition, 94% of 2019 J.D. graduates were employed in some capacity ten months after graduation.

For part-time J.D. students, tuition and fees were $21,538 for Maryland residents and $31,704 for out-of-state students. The estimated total cost of attendance for J.D. students, which includes tuition and fees, living expenses, transportation expenses, book expenses, and health insurance, was $61,745 for full-time students who are Maryland residents, $79,277 for full-time out-of-state students, $45,123 for part-time students who are Maryland residents, and $56,972 for part-time out-of-state students. In addition, 77% of students received a scholarship or grant from Maryland Law, including 78% of full-time students and 74% of part-time students.\nAcademics\nCurriculum\nCore\nThe core curriculum at Maryland Law for J.D. students includes courses in civil procedure, constitutional law, torts, property, contracts, and criminal law, as well as a two-semester sequence of courses focusing on legal skills of analysis, research, writing, and oral argument. After completing these initial courses, students are required to complete additional coursework in constitutional law, ethics, and legal research, and satisfy experiential and writing requirements. This core curriculum forms the basis for more specialized study through more than 150 elective courses, seminars, independent studies, simulations, clinics, and externships.\nThe LL.M. degree program is designed for students who have earned a prior law degree, either a J.D. degree from a law school in the United States or a law degree from a school in another country. Students must complete coursework in a specialty field and may choose to write a thesis. LL.M. students who did not earn a prior law degree in an American law school must take a course on introductory American law, but otherwise, no specific courses are required for LL.M. students.\nSpecialty programs\nMaryland Law is home to several specialty programs that enable students to explore areas of interest through experiential learning and a specialized curriculum. The main specialty areas include:\n* Alternative Dispute Resolution\n* Business Law\n* Clinical Law\n* Cybersecurity and Crisis Management\n* Environmental Law\n* Health Care Law\n* Intellectual Property Law\n* International and Comparative Law\n* Public Health Law\n* Women, Leadership, and Equality\nStudents can focus in other areas as well, such as criminal law, dispute resolution, family law/child advocacy, general practice, jurisprudence/legal history, labor/employment law, administrative law, property/real estate/decedent's estates law, public interest law/community development, and tax law.\nClinical law program\nThrough the Cardin Requirement, named after Maryland Law alumnus U.S. Senator Benjamin Cardin, each full-time day student in the J.D. program must gain hands-on legal experience by representing actual clients who would otherwise lack access to justice. Most students fulfill the Cardin Requirement through the Clinical Law Program, which provides free legal services to Maryland's poorest citizens each year.\nMore than 25 clinics focus on a broad range of practice areas, including civil and criminal litigation, advice and counseling, and transactional work. Civil practice areas include environmental law, health, housing and community development, juvenile law and children, AIDS, and immigration. Criminal student attorneys often represent defendants in misdemeanor cases in Maryland's district courts, as well as work in the School of Law's community justice efforts. In addition to in-house clinical work, students may gain experience in public and private nonprofit externships in the Baltimore-Washington region.\nInitiatives\nIn addition to formal specialty programs, the law school sponsors a variety of academic and public service initiatives. These initiatives enhance the educational and scholarly mission of the law school and also serve the community.\n* Agriculture Law Education Initiative\n* Chacón Center for Immigrant Justice\n* Leadership, Ethics and Democracy (LEAD) Initiative: In spring 2008, the Fetzer Institute made a three-year $1.6 million funding commitment to the School of Law to help it respond to these challenges and create a Leadership, Ethics and Democracy program (LEAD).\n* Legislation, politics, and public policy: The University of Maryland School of Law offers students an educational experience in the areas of legislation, public policy and public interest practice.\n* Linking law and the arts: The University of Maryland School of Law, in conjunction with local arts organizations and as part of the \"Linking Law and Arts\" series, uses theater and art to help address complex legal, social, and public policy issues. As part of their commitment to blending law and the arts, students and professors at Maryland Law produced a short film in 2010 about the handling of war tribunals at Guantanamo Bay titled \"The Response\" starring Aasif Mandvi. UMD Carey Law is also one of fewer than 10 law schools in the United States to offer a course in Visual Legal Advocacy, teaching students how to and encouraging them to incorporate cinema into their advocacy work.\n*The Moser Ethics in Action Initiative The successor to the LEAD Initiative.\n*Erin Levitas Initiative for Sexual Assault Prevention\nDual-degree programs\nThe law school offers several dual-degree options:\nBusiness\nMaryland Law has a combined J.D./ through:\n* Robert H.
