The Casa de Stewart site is a California Historical Landmark No. 73, listed on December 6, 1932.\nCasa de Stewart was built by José Manuel Machado, a leatherjacket company soldier of the New Spain Army, stationed in San Diego. Machado built the house for his daughter Rosa. Rosa married Jack Stewart, a pilot boat operator from Maine. The Stewarts eventually enlarged the house. Carmen Stewart Meza lived in the house for 50 years; she moved out after a 1966 flood. Casa de Stewart was acquired by California State Parks, who had it restored to a museum, Casa de Machado y Stewart Museum. The house's current address, is 2707 Congress street, at Congress and Mason Streets, in Old Town, San Diego. Casa de Machado y Silvas, built in 1832, is also a California Historical Landmark.\nGallery\nLa Casa de Machado y Stewart in Old San Diego 1872.jpg|La Casa de Machado y Stewart in Old San Diego in 182, adobe with a new whitewash coat\nSan Diego - Casa de Machado y Stewart interior 01.jpg|Casa de Machado y Stewart Museum\nSan Diego - Casa de Machado y Stewart 02.jpg|Casa de Machado y Stewart Museum\nSan Diego - Casa de Machado y Stewart interior 02.jpg|Casa de Machado y Stewart Museum\nSee also\n*California Historical Landmarks in San Diego County\n*Adobe Chapel of The Immaculate Conception\n*Casa de Carrillo House\n*Casa de Estudillo\n*Casa de Cota\n*Mission San Diego de Alcalá\n*Presidio of San Diego\nReferences"
