It aired Monday to Thursday nights.\nThe serial was the idea of producer Paul Jacklin. He had visited the US to research broadcasting trends, noticed several shows revolved around \"sex and sadism\" and decided to make something similar in Australia. He hired writer Kathleen Carroll to script the series. It was the first serial leading role for Leonard Thiele and the first serial written by Carroll.\nThe serial played again in 1953.\nPremise\nSccording to ABC Weekly \"Edmund Conquest, an Englishman, sets out with his servant, Jeremy, to find adventure, and, sailing through the Mediterranean, they are captured by Barbarossa, king of the Barbary Coast pirates. Conquest finds all the adventure he wants—the love of a beautiful Algerian princess, wars in the bleak   mountains behind Algiers, hairsbreadth escapes from death. \"\nCast\n*Leonard Thiele as Conquest\n*Muriel Steinbeck as Yasmin\nReception\n''Smith's Weekly'' called it \"a curious little serial containing the most impressive opening theme-music, the most interesting situations, and the most uncomfortable, dialogue I have heard for many a month.\"\nReferences"
