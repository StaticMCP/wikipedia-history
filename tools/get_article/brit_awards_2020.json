It was held on 18 February 2020 at the O2 Arena in London, with Jack Whitehall as the host for the third year running.\nBBC Radio 1 host Alice Levine hosted the BRITs Are Coming Nominations Launch Show on 11 January 2020. The show was broadcast on ITV.\nCategory changes\nSeveral changes were made to the award categories compared to the previous year with the overall number of awards based on nominations reduced from thirteen to nine. None of the categories included fan voting.\nCategories not included\nCompared to 2019, the following awards were not awarded:\n*International Group Award (Returned in 2021)\n*Best British Video Award\n*Outstanding Contribution to Music Award\n*Global Success Award\nRenamed categories\nThe following awards were renamed:\n*Best New Artist (previously British Breakthrough Act)\n*Rising Star Award (previously Critics' Choice Award)\n*Song of the Year (previously British Single of the Year)\nControversy\nFollowing the launch show, the Brits were castigated for having male-dominated nominations on the main and gender-neutral categories. The nominations for Album of the Year, Best Group and Best New Artist were almost entirely dominated by male solo artists, except for Mabel who was nominated for the latter, and international singers Normani and Miley Cyrus, who both were up for Song of the Year for their collaborations with Sam Smith and Mark Ronson.\nPerformers\nPre-ceremony\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Performer(s)\n!Song\n!UK Singles Chart reaction(week ending 23 January 2020)\n!UK Albums Chart reaction(week ending 23 January 2020)\n|-\n|Liam PayneCheat Codes\n|\"Live Forever\"\n|N/A\n|LP1 – 100 (–31)\n|-\n|Freya Ridings\n|\"Lost Without You\"\n|N/A\n|Freya Ridings – 72 (+18)\n|-\n|Aitch\n|\"Taste (Make It Shake)\"\n|N/A\n|N/A\n|-\n|Dermot Kennedy\n|\"Power Over Me\"\n|60 (+26)\n|Without Fear – 23 (+17)\n|-\n|Mabel\n|\"Don't Call Me Up\"\n|52 (+4)\n|High Expectations – 22 (+7)\n|}\nMain show\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Performer(s)\n!Song\n!UK Singles Chart reaction(week ending 27 February 2020)\n!UK Albums Chart reaction(week ending 27 February 2020)\n|-\n|Mabel\n|\"Don't Call Me Up\"\n|34 (+14)\n|High Expectations – 24 (+5)\n|-\n|Lewis Capaldi\n|\"Someone You Loved\"\n|6 (+1)\n|Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent – 2 (+/–)\n|-\n|Harry Styles\n|\"Falling\"\n|41 (+53)\n|Fine Line – 8 (+1)\n|-\n|Lizzo\n|\"Cuz I Love You\"\"Truth Hurts\"\"Good as Hell\"\"Juice\"\n|N/AN/A66 (+9)N/A\n|Cuz I Love You – 35 (re-entry)\n|-\n|Dave\n|\"Black\"Freestyle\n|100 (re-entry)\n|Psychodrama – 14 (+43)\n|-\n|Billie EilishFinneasJohnny MarrHans Zimmer\n|\"No Time to Die\"\n|1 (debut)\n|When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? – 4 (+2)''Don't Smile at Me'' – 13 (+4)\n|-\n|Celeste\n|\"Strange\"\n|N/A\n|N/A\n|-\n|StormzyBurna BoyTiana Major9\n|\"Don't Forget to Breathe\"\"Do Better\"\"Wiley Flow\"\"Own It\" (with elements of \"Fortune Teller\" by J Hus)\"Anybody\" (Burna Boy)\"Rainfall\"\n|N/AN/AN/A23 (+/–)N/AN/A\n|Heavy Is the Head – 7 (+/–)\n|-\n|Rod StewartRoyal Philharmonic OrchestraRonnie WoodKenney Jones\n|\"I Don't Want to Talk About It\"\"Stay with Me\"\n|N/AN/A\n|''You're in My Heart: Rod Stewart with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra – 34 (–8)\n|}\nWinners and nominees\nThe winners are in bold.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%\"\n!width=\"50%\"|British Album of the Year\n!width=\"50%\"|Song of the Year\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*'Dave – Psychodrama\n**\n**\n**\n**\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*Lewis Capaldi – \"Someone You Loved\"\n**\n**\n**\n** (produced by Fred Again)\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n|-\n!width=\"50%\"|British Male Solo Artist\n!width=\"50%\"|British Female Solo Artist\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*Stormzy\n**\n**\n**\n**\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*Mabel\n**\n**\n**\n**\n|-\n!width=\"50%\"|British Group\n!width=\"50%\"|Best New Artist\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*Foals\n**\n**\n**\n**\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*Lewis Capaldi\n**\n**\n**\n**\n|-\n!width=\"50%\"|International Male Solo Artist\n!width=\"50%\"|International Female Solo Artist\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*Tyler, the Creator\n**\n**\n**\n**\n|valign=\"top\"|\n* Billie Eilish\n**\n**\n**\n**\n|-\n!width=\"50%\"|Rising Star Award\n!width=\"50%\"|British Producer of the Year\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*Celeste\n**Beabadoobee\n**Joy Crookes\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*Fred Again'''\n|}\nMultiple nominations and awards\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" rowspan=2 style=\"text-align: center; background: #f6e39c\"\n|+ Artists who received multiple nominations\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:55px;\" |Nominations\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |Artist\n|-\n| scope=row rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 4\n|Dave\n|-\n|Lewis Capaldi\n|-\n| scope=row rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 3\n|Mabel\n|-\n|Stormzy\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2\n|Burna Boy\n|-\n|Harry Styles\n|-\n|Michael Kiwanuka\n|-\n|Fred Again\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" rowspan=2 style=\"text-align: center; background: #f6e39c\"\n|+ Artists who won multiple awards\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:55px;\" |Awards\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |Artist\n|-\n| scope=row rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2\n|Lewis Capaldi\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.brits.co.uk/ Brit Awards official website]"
