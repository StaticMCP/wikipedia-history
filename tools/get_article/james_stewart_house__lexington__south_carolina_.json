It was built in 1850, and is a 1 1/2-half story, rectangular, frame cottage with a gable roof and two interior chimneys. It features a porch with a high gable supported by square wood posts. To avoid demolition, the house was moved about 1991 from its original location on West Main Street in Lexington to its current site in the vicinity of Red Bank, South Carolina.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.\nReferences"
