In the , the locality of Millaroo had a population of 86 people.\nGeography\nThe locality is bounded to the west by the Burdekin River. The place is located about  south-east of Townsville, about  inland from the Coral Sea.\nIt is a sugarcane growing area with underground water supplies to irrigate crops.\nClimate\nMillaroo has a dry-winter humid subtropical climate, bordering on a tropical savannah climate (Köppen: Cwa/Aw).

There was a pastoral property of that name.\nFollowing World War II, a number of soldier settlement blocks were established in the area for the purpose of growing tobacco, but it was not successful.\nIn 1952, there was a plan to establish a new irrigation area along the Burdekin River based around a new town. The town to be called Millaroo was to be established as a \"modern\" \"first class\" planned town with reserves, parks, and industrial zones suitable for a population of 6,000 (a similar population to that of Ayr at that time). The buildings were to be constructed with brick and concrete to reduce the fire risk.\nIn 1952, the Millaroo Research Station was established by the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock to undertake agricultural research to benefit North Queensland.\nThe Burdekin Gorge Weir () on the Burdekin River (between Ravenswood and Mount Wyatt) was completed in November 1953 to provide water for irrigation. This led to the land at Millaroo switching to growing sugarcane.\nMillaroo State School opened on 19 July 1954.\nMillaroo Post Office opened on 1 July 1955 and closed in 1972.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Millaroo had a population of 200 people.\nIn the , the locality of Millaroo had a population of 96 people.\nIn the , the locality of Millaroo had a population of 86 people.\nEducation\nMillaroo State School is a government primary (Early Childhood-6) school for boys and girls at 1-13 Cunningham Street ().
