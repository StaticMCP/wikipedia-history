A Polish-Lithuanian, Württembergian, and French force under Polish General  of 1,300-2,000 was defeated by seasoned Russian forces led by General Charles de Lambert of about 3,800-4,000.\nBackground\nOn one side was General Kossecki's division, which had been mauled two days previously at Nowo Schwerschen, reinforced after the battle with Württembergian infantry and French cavalry units. On the other side was cavalry from the Army of the Danube.\nOrder of Battle\nAccording to Pugačiauskas, the regiments under Kossecki were:\n* incompletely formed 22nd Lithuanian Infantry Regiment (1,500)\n* 18th Lithuanian Uhlan Regiment (940)\n* Kossakowski's Chasseurs à pied Regiment (two battalions, total 634)\nBattle\nLambert mounted a pursuit, catching them at Kaidanowo, where he destroyed most of the detachment.\nThe Russian cavalry charge proved devastating, as the unseasoned 22nd Lithuanian Infantry Regiment did not withstand it and retreated. The regiment's commander, Stanisław Czapski, tried to halt the retreat and even shot insubordinate soldiers, but his actions were unable to rectify the situation. All three Polish-Lithuanian regiments suffered losses.\nKossecki and about 100 of his cavalry escaped back to Minsk.\nAftermath\nOf the 22nd Lithuanian Infantry Regiment, a mere 30 officers and 53 soldiers remained. Stanisław Czapski was awarded the Legion of Honour by Napoleon due to his effort in this battle.\nThe 18th Lithuanian Uhlan Regiment survived this battle, which was its first, relatively unscathed, as it managed to evade Russian capture and retreated towards Berezina.\nBronikowski and about 1,000 men evacuated Minsk and, including about 500 men of the 7th Württembergian Infantry Regiment, marched to Barysaw. A number of civilians of the administration together with many soldiers escaped to Vilnius, where they caused a panic because the inhabitants thought that the Russians were following them.\nSee also\n*List of battles of the French invasion of Russia\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
