Date\n! Development\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Antiquity\n|Greek myths of Hephaestus and Pygmalion incorporated the idea of intelligent automata (such as Talos) and artificial beings (such as Galatea and Pandora).\n|-\n| Sacred mechanical statues built in Egypt and Greece were believed to be capable of wisdom and emotion. Hermes Trismegistus would write, \"They have 'sensus' and 'spiritus'... by discovering the true nature of the gods, man has been able to reproduce it.\"\n|-\n! 10th century BC\n| Yan Shi presented King Mu of Zhou with mechanical men that were capable of moving their bodies independently.\n|-\n! 384 BC–322 BC\n| Aristotle described the syllogism, a method of formal, mechanical thought in the Organon. Aristotle also described means–ends analysis (an algorithm for planning) in Nicomachean Ethics, the same algorithm used by Newell and Simon's General Problem Solver (1959).\n|-\n!3rd century BC\n|Ctesibius invents a mechanical water clock with an alarm. This was the first example of a feedback mechanism.\n|-\n! 1st century\n| Hero of Alexandria created mechanical men and other automatons. He produced what may have been \"the world's first practical programmable machine:\" an automatic theatre.\n|-\n! 260\n| Porphyry wrote Isagogê which categorized knowledge and logic, including a drawing of what would later be called a \"semantic net\".\n|-\n! ~800\n| Jabir ibn Hayyan developed the Arabic alchemical theory of Takwin, the artificial creation of life in the laboratory, up to and including human life.\n|-\n! rowspan = 2 | 9th Century\n| The Banū Mūsā brothers created a programmable music automaton described in their Book of Ingenious Devices: a steam-driven flute controlled by a program represented by pins on a revolving cylinder. This was \"perhaps the first machine with a stored program\".\n|-\n| al-Khwarizmi wrote textbooks with precise step-by-step methods for arithmetic and algebra, used in Islam, India and Europe until the 16th century. The word \"algorithm\" is derived from his name.\n|-\n! 1206\n| Ismail al-Jazari created a programmable orchestra of mechanical human beings.\n|-\n! 1275\n| Ramon Llull, Mallorcan theologian, invents the Ars Magna, a tool for combining concepts mechanically based on an Arabic astrological tool, the Zairja.

The method was further developed by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the 17th century.\n|-\n! ~1500\n| Paracelsus claimed to have created an artificial man out of magnetism, sperm, and alchemy.\n|-\n!  ~1580\n| Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel of Prague is said to have invented the Golem, a clay man brought to life.\n|}\n1600–1900\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Date\n! Development\n|-\n! 1620\n| Francis Bacon developed empirical theory of knowledge and introduced inductive logic in his work Novum Organum, a play on Aristotle's title Organon.\n|-\n! 1623\n| Wilhelm Schickard drew a calculating clock on a letter to Kepler. This will be the first of five unsuccessful attempts at designing a direct entry calculating clock in the 17th century (including the designs of Tito Burattini, Samuel Morland and René Grillet).\n|-\n! 1641\n| Thomas Hobbes published Leviathan and presented a mechanical, combinatorial theory of cognition. He wrote \"...for reason is nothing but reckoning\".\n|-\n! 1642\n| Blaise Pascal invented a mechanical calculator, the first digital calculating machine.\n|-\n! 1647\n| René Descartes proposed that bodies of animals are nothing more than complex machines (but that mental phenomena are of a different \"substance\").\n|-\n! 1654\n| Blaise Pascal described how to find expected values in probability, in 1662 Antoine Arnauld published a formula to find the maximum expected value, and in 1663, Gerolamo Cardano's solution to the same problems was published 116 years after it was written. The theory of probability was further developed by Jacob Bernoulli and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the 18th century. Probability theory would become central to AI and machine learning from the 1990s onward.\n|-\n! 1672\n| Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz improved the earlier machines, making the Stepped Reckoner to do multiplication and division.\n|-\n! 1676\n| Leibniz derived the chain rule. The rule is used by AI to train neural networks, for example the backpropagation algorithm uses the chain rule.\n|-\n! 1679\n|  Leibniz developed a universal calculus of reasoning (alphabet of human thought) by which arguments could be decided mechanically.

The Turk was later shown to be a hoax, involving a human chess player.\n|-\n! 1795–1805\n| The simplest kind of artificial neural network is the linear network. It has been known for over two centuries as the method of least squares or linear regression. It was used as a means of finding a good rough linear fit to a set of points by Adrien-Marie Legendre (1805) and Carl Friedrich Gauss (1795) for the prediction of planetary movement.\n|-\n!1800\n|Joseph Marie Jacquard created a programmable loom, based on earlier inventions by Basile Bouchon (1725), Jean-Baptiste Falcon (1728) and Jacques Vaucanson (1740). Replaceable punched cards controlled sequences of operations in the process of manufacturing textiles. This may have been the first industrial software for commercial enterprises.\n|-\n! 1818\n| Mary Shelley published the story of Frankenstein; or the Modern Prometheus, a fictional consideration of the ethics of creating sentient beings.\n|-\n! 1822–1859\n| Charles Babbage & Ada Lovelace worked on programmable mechanical calculating machines.\n|-\n! 1837\n|The mathematician Bernard Bolzano made the first modern attempt to formalize semantics.\n|-\n! 1854\n| George Boole set out to \"investigate the fundamental laws of those operations of the mind by which reasoning is performed, to give expression to them in the symbolic language of a calculus\", inventing Boolean algebra.\n|-\n! 1863\n| Samuel Butler suggested that Darwinian evolution also applies to machines and speculates that they will one day become conscious and eventually supplant humanity.\n|}\n20th century\n1901–1950\n{| class=\"wikitable\n|-\n!Date\n! Development\n|-\n! 1910-1913\n| Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead published Principia Mathematica, which showed that all of elementary mathematics could be reduced to mechanical reasoning in formal logic.\n|-\n! 1912-1914\n| Leonardo Torres Quevedo built an automaton for chess endgames, El Ajedrecista. He was called \"the 20th century's first AI pioneer\". In his Essays on Automatics (1914), Torres published speculation about thinking and automata and introduced the idea of floating-point arithmetic.\n|-\n! 1923\n| Karel Čapek's play ''R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)'' opened in London. This is the first use of the word \"robot\" in English.\n|-\n! 1920–1925\n| Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst Ising created and analyzed the Ising model (1925) which can be viewed as the first artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) consisting of neuron-like threshold elements. In 1972, Shun'ichi Amari made this architecture adaptive.\n|-\n! 1920s and 1930s\n| Ludwig Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921) inspires Rudolf Carnap and the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle to use formal logic as the foundation of philosophy. However, Wittgenstein's later work in the 1940s demonstrates that context-free symbolic logic is incoherent without human interpretation.\n|-\n! 1931\n| Kurt Gödel encoded mathematical statements and proofs as integers and showed that there are true theorems that are unprovable by any consistent theorem-proving machine. Thus, \"he identified fundamental limits of algorithmic theorem proving, computing, and any type of computation-based AI,\", laying the foundations of theoretical computer science and AI theory.\n|-\n!1935\n|Alonzo Church extended Gödel's proof and showed that the decision problem of computer science does not have a general solution. He developed the Lambda calculus, which will eventually be fundamental to the theory of computer languages.\n|-\n! 1936\n| Konrad Zuse filed his patent application for a program-controlled computer.\n|-\n!1937\n|Alan Turing published \"On Computable Numbers\", which laid the foundations of the modern theory of computation by introducing the Turing machine, a physical interpretation of \"computability\".

It introduces many concepts, including the logic-based approach to problem-solving, that intellectual activity consists mainly of various kinds of search, and a discussion of machine learning in which he anticipates the Connectionism AI approach.\n|-\n| John von Neumann (quoted by Edwin Thompson Jaynes) in response to a comment at a lecture that it was impossible for a machine (at least ones created by humans) to think: \"You insist that there is something a machine cannot do. If you will tell me precisely what it is that a machine cannot do, then I can always make a machine which will do just that!\". Von Neumann was presumably alluding to the Church–Turing thesis, which states that any effective procedure can be simulated by a (generalized) computer.\n|-\n! 1949\n| Donald O. Hebb develops Hebbian theory, a possible algorithm for learning in neural networks.\n|}\n1950s\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Date\n!

Simon (Carnegie Institute of Technology, now Carnegie Mellon University or CMU). This is often called the first AI program, though Samuel's checkers program also has a strong claim. This program has been described as the first deliberately engineered to perform automated reasoning, and would eventually prove 38 of the first 52 theorems in Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica, and find new and more elegant proofs for some.
