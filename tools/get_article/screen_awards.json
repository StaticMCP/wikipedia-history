The nomination and award selection was done by a panel of distinguished professionals from the industry. The awards were introduced by Screen magazine of the Indian Express Group in 1995. The magazine was acquired by Star India in 2015 and subsequently closed down. Star India continues to sponsor the event under the Star Screen Awards title.\nThe name of each year's ceremony was determined by the presenting network: the first \"Star Screen Awards\" were telecast on Star Plus from 2000 until 2011, after which the \"Colors Screen Awards\" were broadcast on Colors and the \"Life OK Screen Awards\" on Life OK, each for a period of two years. As of 2019, Star continues to hold the television distribution rights to the event.\nHistory\nThe Screen Awards, initiated by the chairman of the Express Group, Viveck Goenka, in 1994, focused on excellence in Indian films. The prizes were awarded by film industry insiders, as opposed to other award ceremonies, where winners are determined by juries. The Screen Awards were the first to be conducted annually.\nUntil 2001, the awards were sponsored by Videocon International and hence known as the Screen Videocon Awards. For regional film industries of South India, Screen has held three editions of the Screen Awards for excellence in South Indian cinema, and prizes were awarded for Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada cinema.\nAwards\nJury awards\n* Best Film\n* Best Director\n* Best Actor\n* Best Actress\n* Best Supporting Actor\n* Best Supporting Actress\n* Best Villain\n* Best Comedian\n* Best Music Director\n* Best Lyricist\n* Best Male Playback\n* Best Female Playback\n* Most Promising Newcomer – Male\n* Most Promising Newcomer – Female\nCritics' awards\n* Best Actor (Critics)\n* Best Actress (Critics)\nTechnical awards\n* Best Story\n* Best Screenplay\n* Best Dialogue\n* Best Background Music\n* Best Editing\n* Special Effects\n* Best Art Direction\n* Best Action\n* Best Cinematography\n* Best Choreography\n* Best Sound Design\nSpecial awards\n* Lifetime Achievement\n* Jodi No. 1\n* Best Child Artist\n* Special Jury Award\n* Best Fresh Talent\n* Best Jodi of the Decade\n* Showman of the Millennium – Raj Kapoor (2002)\n* Best Performer of The Year – Ekta Kapoor (2012)\n* Legend of Indian Cinema Award – Amitabh Bachchan (2013)\nRetired awards\n* Best Actor (Popular Choice)\n* Best Actress (Popular Choice)\n* Entertainer of the Year (2010–12,13,19)\n* Best Animation Film (2009)\n* Best Film in English (2009)\nRecords and facts\nMost awards to a single film\n* Dangal – 12\n* Gully Boy – 12\n* Devdas – 11\nMost directing awards\n* Sanjay Leela Bhansali  – 3\n* Ashutosh Gowariker – 2\n* Rakesh Roshan – 2\nMost acting awards – male (Best Actor + Best Supporting Actor), in chronological order\n* Amitabh Bachchan (4 + 0) = 4\n* Shahrukh Khan (4+0) = 4\n* Hrithik Roshan  (4 + 0) = 4\n* Anil Kapoor (1 + 2) = 3\n* Saif Ali Khan (0 + 3) = 3\nMost acting awards – female (Best Actress + Best Supporting Actress), in chronological order\n* Vidya Balan (5 + 0) = 5\n* Madhuri Dixit (3 + 1) = 4\nMost awards for music direction\n* A.R.
