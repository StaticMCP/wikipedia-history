The exhibition took place on 15, 16, and 18 October 2025. 17 October is a rest day in order to follow an ATP rule that players cannot compete on three consecutive days in an exhibition.\nHistory\nEach of the six participants is guaranteed a participation fee of US$1,500,000, with the winner taking home an additional $4.5 million, for $6 million total. In addition, the winner received as a trophy a life-size replica of a racket made of solid gold 24k, weighing 4 kg, identical to the one with which the soon-to-retire Nadal had been honored the previous year.\nFormat\nThe six participants were initially announced in August 2025; however, Jack Draper suffered a season-ending arm injury, and he was replaced by Tsitsipas. The bracket was announced the following month, with Alcaraz and Djokovic receiving first round byes. The final saw a rematch of the 2024 Six Kings Slam with a face-off between defending champion and world no. 2 Jannik Sinner and world no. 1 Carlos Alcaraz, where Sinner defeated Alcaraz in straight sets (6–2, 6–4). Taylor Fritz achieved his first win against Novak Djokovic in the third-place playoff, when the latter retired after losing a closely contested first set (75″, 6–7(4–7)).\nResults\nTaylor Fritz\n| RD1-score03-1=6\n| RD1-score03-2=6\n| RD1-score03-3=\n| RD1-seed04=\n| RD1-team04= Alexander Zverev\n| RD1-score04-1=3\n| RD1-score04-2=4\n| RD1-score04-3=\n| RD1-seed5=\n| RD1-team5= Stefanos Tsitsipas\n| RD1-score5-1=2\n| RD1-score5-2=3\n| RD1-score5-3=\n| RD1-seed6=\n| RD1-team6= Jannik Sinner\n| RD1-score6-1=6\n| RD1-score6-2=6\n| RD1-score6-3=\n| RD2-seed1=\n| RD2-team1= Carlos Alcaraz\n| RD2-score1-1=6\n| RD2-score1-2=6\n| RD2-score1-3=\n| RD2-seed2=\n| RD2-team2= Taylor Fritz\n| RD2-score2-1=4\n| RD2-score2-2=2\n| RD2-score2-3=\n| RD2-seed3=\n| RD2-team3= Jannik Sinner\n| RD2-score3-1=6\n| RD2-score3-2=6\n| RD2-score3-3=\n| RD2-seed4=\n| RD2-team4= Novak Djokovic\n| RD2-score4-1=4\n| RD2-score4-2=2\n| RD2-score4-3=\n| RD3-seed1=\n| RD3-team1= Carlos Alcaraz\n| RD3-score1-1=2\n| RD3-score1-2=4\n| RD3-score1-3=\n| RD3-seed2=\n| RD3-team2= Jannik Sinner\n| RD3-score2-1=6\n| RD3-score2-2=6\n| RD3-score2-3=\n| 3rd-seed1=\n| 3rd-team1= Taylor Fritz\n| 3rd-score1-1=77'''\n| 3rd-score1-2=0\n| 3rd-score1-3=\n| 3rd-seed2=\n| 3rd-team2= Novak Djokovic\n| 3rd-score2-1=64\n| 3rd-score2-2=0r\n| 3rd-score2-3=\n}}\nReferences"
