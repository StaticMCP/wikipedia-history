The memorial was set up and officiated by former Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman on 31 August 1985, 28 years after the independence of the country.\nArchitecture\nThe museum is housed in an elegant Dutch colonial mansion. The two golden onion domes located at the top of the building embellish the stark white stucco.\nExhibitions\nThe memorial exhibits records and photos of the early era of Malay Sultanate. It also displays the journey of Malaysia from independence and its modern development.\nSee also\n* List of museums in Malaysia\n* List of tourist attractions in Melaka\nReferences"
