Administratively, it belongs to the Chukotka, Russian Federation.\nIt is the easternmost point of Wrangel Island.\nThis headland was named in 1881 after Lieutenant Waring of USS Rodgers, commanded by Lieutenant Robert M. Berry. Lt. Waring was the first to land at this point.\nVery large numbers of birds are nesting on the cliffs of this cape, including the horned puffin, tufted puffin, thick-billed murre, glaucous gull and pelagic cormorant.\n{|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|.]]\n|s at Waring Point.]]\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
