Located in the Belgrano neighbourhood, it is home of River Plate.\nIt was opened on 26 May 1938 and named after former club president Antonio Vespucio Liberti (1900–1978). It is the largest stadium in both Argentina and all of South America with a capacity of 85,018 and is also home of the Argentina national football team. It was the main venue in the 1951 Pan American Games. It hosted the 1978 FIFA World Cup Final between Argentina and the Netherlands. It has also hosted four finals of the Copa América, most recently in 2011, as well as many finals of the Copa Libertadores.\nHistory\nThe Club Atlético River Plate was founded in 1901 and by 1934, it had won two championships. At the time, the club was nicknamed Los Millonarios (The Millionaires) because of the purchase of forward Carlos Peucelle for whom River had paid a huge amount of money. On 31 October 1934, River Plate purchased the land where the club was to build the new stadium in the neighbourhood of Belgrano.\nEl Monumental was built on land reclaimed from the marshy coast of . On 25 May 1935, the cornerstone was laid on the Centennial (now Figueroa Alcorta) and Río de la Plata (Udaondo) Avenues. On 1 December of that year, the Steering Committee presented the approved project in detail to its members at an assembly. They obtained a loan of $2,500,000 from the government and on 27 September 1936, construction began under the direction of architects José Aslan and Héctor Ezcurra.\nThe initial cost of work reached the figure of $4,479,545.80, but was reduced to about 3 million dollars when the committee decided to halt the construction of the north end of the stadium due to a lack of adequate funds.\nThe foundation of the stadium was to be six or eight feet deep. This required open pit excavation to ensure the stability of the ground, and pumping bilge water from the site. The construction of the three stands was completed in two years. There are 50&nbsp;km of steps, with 26,000 square metres of reinforced concrete and almost 3,000 tons of steel.\nThe stadium was inaugurated on Wednesday 26 May, amidst a crowd of approximately 70,000 people. They witnessed the handing over of an Argentine flag, one from the club, paid for by a group of associates, and then sang the national anthem and the River Plate chant. The next day, nearly 68,000 spectators were present. After various activities the evening ended with a match between River Plate and Uruguay team Peñarol, with a 3–1 victory for the home squad.\nEstadio Monumental was redeveloped from 2020 to 2023 and removed the long existing athletic track and add more seats in its place, bringing the front seats closer to the pitch. The existing wooden seats were also removed, with 40,565 set aside for sale. The stadium partially reopened in February 2023. River Plate drew an average home attendance of 83,812 in their first league season after the expansion. The Estadio Monumental currently has a capacity of 84,567, making it the largest in South America. In 2022, the stadium's naming rights were purchased by supermarket chain ChangoMâs.\nNotable events\nWhen the Monumental project was originally designed, it consisted of four double decker stands. As the bank loan was not enough to carry out the entire project, the stadium was left with a horseshoe shape. The horseshoe was partially enclosed in 1958, under the club presidency of Enrique Pardo. The new construction, the first tier Colonia stand, was financed by proceeds from the mn$10 million transfer of Omar Sivori to Juventus of Italy. With the new construction the stadium's capacity reached 90,000.\nThe stadium was remodelled and finally completed to meet the original project after Argentina was awarded the right to host the 1978 World Cup. River Plate was lent money by the Military Government in charge of the country at the time but they struggled to meet repayments due to the changes of currency, which had a detrimental effect on the team. Monumental was the headquarters for the 1978 World Cup. The venue was opened on 1 June for the match between West Germany and Poland. They hosted seven more games, including the final between Argentina and the Netherlands.\nSan Lorenzo earned the record for highest number of people attending a match for a visiting team in 1982. In their second division match against Tigre, San Lorenzo (which did not have a stadium at the time), brought more than 70,000 people to River's stadium. In 1975 when River played Racing for the title (after an 18 years drought) 100,000 were present. At the end of the 1986 and 1996 Copa Libertadores second-leg finals (both against América de Cali), more seats were added and approximately 86,000 spectators were in attendance. It is estimated that for the Argentina versus Uruguay 1987 Copa América semifinal more than 87,000 spectators attended. In 1993, in a qualification match for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Argentina lost 5–0 to Colombia, its greatest ever defeat at home. Since then, however, Argentina had never lost a match in World Cup qualifying within this stadium until Ecuador won 2–0 on 8 October 2015.\nThe total length of the seating in the stands of the stadium is over 70 kilometers.\nSporting events\nThe Monumental, aside from being River Plate's home ground, also accommodates the Argentina national football team in their home games for events such as the FIFA World Cup qualification.\nThe Monumental also hosted the closing ceremonies and the athletics events of the First Pan American Games in 1951. The stadium host the first Super Special Stage of the 2007 Rally Argentina of WRC.\nRugby union matches featuring the Argentina national rugby union team, Los Pumas, also take place occasionally on this field, although the Pumas more frequently play at other stadiums.\nFootball\n1978 FIFA World Cup\nThe stadium served as venue for the following matches during the World Cup:\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: \"\n|-\n!

The opening and final matches were both held in the Monumental, which had a capacity of 76,600 at the time because all of the popular stands were standing-only.\nThe stadium complex also has facilities for tennis, basketball, and other sports, as well as living quarters for young footballers, a theatre hall, a parking lot, museum etc. It can be accessed by several train and bus lines as it is located within walking distance from the Barrancas de Belgrano transportation hub. Contrary to most other stadiums in the Buenos Aires area, there is a sizable car park outside the stadium.\n2014–2016 renovation\nIn the recent years, with the new administration, the stadium has gone through an extensive renovation program that ranged from seating to the stadium's display.\n*In November 2014, the stadium's display was removed and a new full-color led was installed; this one is 19.45 m wide and 7.16 m tall, tripling the size of the old one and making it the largest in a South American stadium. On the same period a new Paddock Club and hospitality seatings were installed at field level.\n*In August 2015, the Ciudad Universitaria station was opened on the Belgrano Norte Line in order to serve both the stadium and the University of Buenos Aires' Ciudad Universitaria campus located on the other side of the tracks. The stadium is linked to the station with a viaduct and the line connects the stadium to both central Buenos Aires through its Retiro terminal and also some of the city's northern outskirts. There were extensive renovations in the bathrooms, and led screens were installed in boxes and stalls.\n*In November 2015, the [http://www.cariverplate.com.ar/museo-river River Plate Museum] was fully renewed: attractions were added and a River Plate store were built, where officially licensed products are sold.\n*In December 2015, a tempered glass envelope was installed over the outer lower rings of the stadium to create a better ambience to the spectators.\nThe renovation plan is still in progress as the club seeks funding for a large improvement plan which includes raising the capacity of the stadium to 85,018 spectators.\nIt will be one of the centenary host cities for the 2030 FIFA World Cup.\nSee also\n*Antonio Vespucio Liberti\n*List of stadiums by capacity\n*Lists of stadiums\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_HujQ_PLofHI/TIaXel3dAjI/AAAAAAAABec/8Sie5dLuitk/s1600/River.JPG Stadium picture]\n*[https://archive.today/20110720230351/stadesmythiques.free.fr/monumental_eng.htm In depth history of 'El Monumental']\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070824090801/http://www.riveresmundial.com.ar/es/content/view/242/116/ History of the stadium 'El Monumental' (written by fans)]\n}}\n}}"
