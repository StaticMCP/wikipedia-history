It dates between the 14th and 10th/9th centuries BCE. In Yugoslavian historiography, starting from Milutin Garašanin, the Brnjica culture was interpreted as the \"Daco-Moesian\" and non-\"Illyrian\" linguistic component of the later Dardani, an Iron Age Palaeo-Balkan group appearing as an Illyrian people in ancient literary tradition.\nThe Brnjica culture is characterized by several groups:\n* Kosovo with Raska and Pester\n* South and West Morava confluence zone\n* Leskovac-Nis\n* South Morava-Pcinja-Upper Vardar\nBrnjica type pottery has been found in Blageovgrad, Plovdiv, and a number of sites in Pelagonia, Lower Vardar, the island of Thasos and Thessaly dating to 13th and 12th century BCE.\nSites\nDonja Brnjica\nThe main site of the culture is a necropolis at Donja Brnjica, (Albanian: Bërnica e Poshtme) near Pristina.\nHisar\nHisar is a multi-periodal settlement at a hill near Leskovac.\nTraces of life of the Brnjica culture (8th century BCE) are seen in the plateau that was protected by a deep moat with a palisade on its inner side, a fortification similar to that of another fortification on the Gradac site in Lanište in the Velika Morava basin.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\nSee also\n* Museum of Kosovo\n* Kingdom of Dardania\n* Archaeology of Kosovo\n* Neolithic sites in Kosovo\n* Roman heritage in Kosovo\n* Copper, Bronze and Iron Age sites in Kosovo"
