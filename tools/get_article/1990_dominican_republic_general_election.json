Following a long vote count, Joaquín Balaguer of the Social Christian Reformist Party (PSRC) was declared winner of the presidential election, whilst in the Congressional elections the PSRC received the most votes and won a majority in the Senate, although the Dominican Liberation Party won the most seats in the House of Representatives.\nThe voter turnout of 60% was the lowest in recent DR history.\nThere were numerous irregularities prior and after election day. Balaguer's victory prompted protests and accusations of fraud. This led the Central Elections Authority to introduce several reforms to the electoral law in 1992, including an increase in the number of members of the Authority and the production of a new electoral roll.\nResults\nPresident\nCongress\n|votes1=663127|st1t1=41|st2t1=–|st3t1=16|st4t1=–|st5t1=\n|party2=Dominican Liberation Party–Democratic Unity||votes2=625929|st1t2=44|st2t2=–|st3t2=12|st4t2=–|st5t2=\n|party3=PRD–BS–PTD|votes3=447605|st1t3=33|st2t3=–|st3t3=2|st4t3=–|st5t3=\n|party4=Independent Revolutionary Party|votes4=139769|st1t4=2|st2t4=New|st3t4=0|st4t4=New|st5t4=\n|party5=PPC–|votes5=8081|st1t5=0|st2t5=–|st3t5=0|st4t5=–|st5t5=\n|party6=National Progressive Force|votes6=18539|vspan6=4|st1t6=0|st2t6=New|st3t6=0|st4t6=New|st5t6=\n|party7=Constitutional Action Party|votes7=|st1t7=0|st2t7=New|st3t7=0|st4t7=New|st5t7=\n|party8=Dominican Communist Party|votes8=|st1t8=0|st2t8=New|st3t8=0|st4t8=New|st5t8=\n|party9=Party of the Dominican People|votes9=|st1t9=0|st2t9=New|st3t9=0|st4t9=New|st5t9=\n|party10=Movement for Independence, Unity and Change|votes10=11052|vspan10=5|st1t10=0|st2t10=New|st3t10=0|st4t10=New|st5t10=\n|party11=MAR|votes11=|st1t11=0|st2t11=New|st3t11=0|st4t11=New|st5t11=\n|party12=MIGRELU|votes12=|st1t12=0|st2t12=New|st3t12=0|st4t12=New|st5t12=\n|party13=MFP|votes13=|st1t13=0|st2t13=New|st3t13=0|st4t13=New|st5t13=\n|party14=MIS|votes14=|st1t14=0|st2t14=New|st3t14=0|st4t14=New|st5t14=\n|invalid=48356\n|total_st1t=120|total_st2t=0|total_st3t=30|total_st4t=0\n|electorate=3275570\n|source=Nohlen\n}}\nReferences"
