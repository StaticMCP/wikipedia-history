Russell T Davies confirmed later that month at San Diego Comic Con that production would begin in August. Produced by Bad Wolf and BBC Studios, Davies is an executive producer along with Phil Collinson, Joel Collins, Julie Gardner, and Jane Tranter. Edoardo Ferretti took on the role of television producer with pre-production underway by July 2024.\nCasting\nRussell Tovey and Gugu Mbatha-Raw lead the series with Jemma Redgrave and Alexander Devrient. Redgrave and Devrient are reprising their roles from Doctor Who as Kate Lethbridge-Stewart and Colonel Ibrahim, respectively. Tovey and Mbatha-Raw previously played Alonso Frame and Tish Jones in Doctor Who, but are set to take on new characters in the spin-off. Ruth Madeley also returns from Doctor Who, playing Shirley Anne Bingham. Colin McFarlane reprises his role as General Austin Pierce, a character first introduced and last seen fifteen years prior in the third series of Torchwood, another Doctor Who spin-off. Adrian Lukis, Patrick Baladi, Vincent Franklin, Francesca Corney and Mei Mac were announced as additional cast members in October 2024.\nWriting\nThe five-part series was written by Davies and Pete McTighe. Davies is the current showrunner of Doctor Who while McTighe also previously wrote for the parent series. The two split writing duties across the programme, with Davies writing the premiere and finale episodes, McTighe writing the second and third episodes, and the two co-writing episode four together. The first read-through for all five episodes occurred on 19 August.  The series sees the return of the Sea Devils.\nFilming\nLocation scouting took place in July 2024. Some filming took place internationally. All episodes are being produced in one block, compared to the two to three blocks that would usually be used for five episodes. Location shooting began on 29 August 2024 in Barry and Atlantic Wharf, both in south Wales. Filming continued into September in various locations across Wales, including at the Welsh Government Building, City Arms pub, Hodge House, and Merthyr Mawr. In October, the series was spotted filming at Cardiff City Hall and National Museum Cardiff. Further recording was set to take place in Mallorca, Spain in October 2024. November filming occurred at Town Bridge in Newport, Wales. Filming concluded on 10 December 2024.\nMusic\nOn 30 May 2025, it was announced that Lorne Balfe had been hired as the show's composer. In addition to the news, Balfe also announced that there would be an upcoming opportunity for some people to be audience members at a recording session for the show the following month.\nRelease\nThe series is set to air on BBC One and stream on BBC iPlayer in the United Kingdom on 7 December 2025, and will stream on Disney+ internationally in 2026.\n}}\nExternal links\n*\n}}"
