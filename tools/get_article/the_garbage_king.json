Before Mamo can realize it, \"Merga\" takes Mamo far from the city and anything he's ever known and sells him to a farmer as a slave.\nDani comes from a rich and privileged family in Addis Ababa. His father, however, wants him to send him away to Jigjiga to make him learn something useful and toughen up. Dani's mother is sick and flew to London, England, to receive better medical care. Dani runs away to escape his father. At the same time, Mamo escapes from the farmer after attempting suicide caused by physical abuse and hitch-hikes back together join a gang of beggar street boys. The members of this gang are using nicknames because they do not know their actual names, or have forgotten them. Their nicknames are Million (The Joviro or gangmaster), Shoes, Getachew, Buffalo and Karate. Karate has a bad sickness that usually makes him go into coughing fits. Later on in the book, Karate passes away from his sickness.\nAwards\nThe Garbage King won the Scottish Arts Council Children's Book of the Year Award and the Stockport Schools Book Award.
