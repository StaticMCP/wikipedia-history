He was signed as an amateur free agent by the Cincinnati Reds in 1959.\nEdwards made his MLB debut at age 23 on June 27, 1961, in a 10–8 Reds' win over the Chicago Cubs. In his first plate appearance, he pinch-hit in the seventh inning for Reds' starting catcher Jerry Zimmerman, drawing a walk against reliever Barney Schultz and later scoring on a triple by Jerry Lynch. In his next trip to the plate, in the ninth inning, he got his first hit and first RBI, driving in Gordy Coleman with a single against reliever Joe Schaffernoth.\nDuring Edwards' rookie season, he backed up Zimmerman and helped the Reds win the 1961 National League pennant. In the 1961 World Series Edwards had 4 hits and 2 RBIs in a losing cause, as the New York Yankees defeated the Reds in 5 games.\nEdwards put up solid offensive numbers from 1962 to 1965, earning three MLB All Star appearances. His offensive numbers diminished after he suffered a broken finger on the last day of spring training in 1966, but he continued to be one of the best defensive catchers in the National League. On June 14, 1965, Edwards was the Reds catcher when pitcher Jim Maloney went 10 innings against the New York Mets without allowing a hit. Edwards left the game in the 10th inning for a pinch runner with the game in a scoreless tie, as the Mets went on to break up the no-hitter and score a run to win the game in the 11th inning. Two months later, on August 19, 1965, Edwards was once again the catcher as Maloney threw another 10 innings without allowing a hit. This time, the Reds scored a run, securing the victory and the no-hitter for Maloney.\nWith the arrival of Johnny Bench, the Reds traded Edwards to the St. Louis Cardinals for Pat Corrales and Jimy Williams on February 8, 1968. With the Cardinals, he was the backup catcher to Tim McCarver, helping them win the National League pennant, however, they would subsequently lose to the Detroit Tigers in the 1968 World Series. Edwards caught Ray Washburn's no-hitter on September 18, 1968. One day after the World Series ended, Edwards was traded with minor leaguer Tommy Smith to the Houston Astros for Dave Giusti and Dave Adlesh on October 11. In his first season with the Houston Astros in 1969, Edwards finished 36th in voting for the National League Most Valuable Player Award.\nHis final game played, at age 36, was a 5–4 10-inning loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers at the Astrodome on October 2, 1974. In his final plate appearance, pinch-hitting in the 10th inning for Skip Jutze against the Dodgers' Eddie Solomon, Edwards drew a walk.\nCareer statistics\nIn a 14-year major league career, Edwards played in 1,470 games, producing 1,106 hits in 4,577 at bats for a .242 batting average along with 81 home runs, 524 runs batted in, and a .311 on-base percentage.

Realmuto in 2023.\nRichard Kendall of the Society for American Baseball Research devised a study that ranked Edwards as the second most dominating fielding catcher in major league history.
