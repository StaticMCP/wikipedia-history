Located on Chester Road between downtown Swarthmore and Swarthmore College, it serves the Media/Wawa Line.\nIn 2013, this station saw 765 boardings and 699 alightings on an average weekday. Dollar-a-day parking and permit parking are available.  It is the first outward-bound Zone 3 station from the central Philadelphia stations. It is the busiest station on the Media/Wawa Line outside of Center City. The adult fare to and from Central Philadelphia is currently $5 during off-peak hours, with an additional $2 surcharge assessed for those who buy a ticket on the train, regardless of whether the ticket window is open.\nThe ticket office is located on the inbound side of the tracks in a building used otherwise by Swarthmore College and the Chester Children's Chorus. The building was originally built in 1880 by the Pennsylvania Railroad and formerly held the Jumping Cow cafe. Swarthmore's main street, Chester Road, has passed under the station since 1931. Before Swarthmore College was opened, the station was known as Westdale.\nStation layout\nSwarthmore has two low-level side platforms.\nBibliography\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=39.902313,-75.350547&spn=0.003918,0.013679&z=17&layer=c&cbll=39.902151,-75.350842&panoid=4QUYdOz2LaDOX72b15BPCQ&cbp=12,15.03,,0,2.74 Station from Google Maps Street View]"
