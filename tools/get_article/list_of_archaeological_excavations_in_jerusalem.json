British Protestants, eager to find hard evidence for their Christian convictions, set out to dig the Holy City. Among them were Flinders Petrie, Charles Warren, Charles William Wilson and Montague Parker.\nThe British Mandate\nDuring the Mandate, efforts to excavate Jerusalem continued with digs by R. A. Stewart Macalister in the City of David.\nJordanian Rule\nUnder Jordanian rule, Kathleen Kenyon excavated in the City of David, discovering numerous important finds including the proto-Ionic capital.\nSummary Table\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
