It is part of European route E67 Via Baltica from Prague in the Czech Republic, to Helsinki in Finland, passing towns and cities in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.\nThree lanes in each direction are planned by 2025 between Prague and Jirny (8&nbsp;km) and to Poděbrady after 2025. Around Hradec Králové, the D11 runs in parallel with the D35 (between the Sedlice and the Plotiště interchanges).\nHistory\nPlans to build a highway connecting Prague and Hradec Králové date from 1938. Construction began in 1978, with sections 1101 (Prague-Jirny) and 1102/I (Jirny–Bříství) put into operation in October 1984. The second oldest  section, 1102/II (Bříství–Třebestovice) was put into operation a year later, in October 1985.\nIn 2009, the connecting section of the D35 motorway Sedlice (MÚK with D11) - Opatovice nad Labem (MÚK with I/37) was put into operation. This significantly accelerated the connection to Pardubice and the southern parts of Hradec Králové.\nIn 2017, the motorway was finally brought to Hradec Králové. In 2018 and 2019, there was an expansion to 6 lanes between Horní Počernice and Jirny, but only four lanes are still in use.\nSections between Hradec Králové - Smiřice and Smiřice - Jaroměř, which construction started in 2018, were opened in December 2021.\nFuture plans\nAs the S3 expressway connecting the Polish side was finished before the Czech D11, further postponement of completion of the motorway to the Polish border is undesirable. Almost all the land for section 1109 (Trutnov - state border with Poland) has already been purchased. Construction was originally scheduled to start at the end of 2023, and the contractor was selected in November 2023. However, a month later, an objection was filed against the selection of the most advantageous bid. This final section is yet to be started, with completion expected in 2027 at earliest.\nSection 1108 Jaroměř – Trutnov; a  segment is planned. The construction should commence in 2025, in order to be put into operation in time for 2028.\nWith the completion of the Polish S3, and after completion of the border section of D11 and the transfer of international traffic for E65 and E67 from Harrachov and Náchod to Královec, congestion is expected on road 37.\nRoute description\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=Temporary end of the motorway (other sections in preparation)\n}}\n|notes=In construction, planned for 2026\n----\nKilometrage end point\n----\nBorder crossing; road continues as the Polish S3\n}}\nImages\nFile:Dálnice D11.jpg|D11 motorway near Bříství, Nymburk District.\nFile:Voleč, dálnice D11.jpg|D11 motorway near Voleč, Pardubice Region.\nFile:MostUPodebrad A.
