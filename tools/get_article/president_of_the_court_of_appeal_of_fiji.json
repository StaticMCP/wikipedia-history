The Chief Justice of Fiji is not permitted to hold this position; in order to give the Court of Appeal a degree of independence from the High Court and the Supreme Court, the Chief Justice, who chairs both courts, is constitutionally disqualified from presiding over, or even sitting on, the Court of Appeal.\nThe following persons have served as President of the Court of Appeal since it was established in 1999.\n{| table width=\"70%\" border=\"1\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 style=\"margin:5px; border:3px solid;\"\n|td width=\"50%\" style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|President of the Court of Appeal||td width=\"50%\" style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|Term of office\n|-\n|Jai Ram Reddy||2000\n|-\n|Sir Timoci Tuivaga [1]||2000 - 2 March 2001\n|-\n|vacant||2001–2002\n|-\n|Jai Ram Reddy||2002–2003\n|-\n|Gordon Ward||2003–2007; following the December 2006 military coup, Sir Gordon Ward and five other judges resigned as judges of the courts of Fiji.\n|-\n|Court of Appeals panel of 3 judges was appointed in 2009|| In April 2009 the court found that the 2006 coup had been illegal, which triggered the 2009 Fijian constitutional crisis.
