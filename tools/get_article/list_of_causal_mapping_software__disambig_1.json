They are only included here if they include any additional features specifically useful for causal mapping, such as:\n*Calculation / simulation of downstream causal effects\n*Ability to distinguish between different sources of evidence for individual links\n*Ability to create causal links on the basis of highlighted passages of source text\nCausal mapping software\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!Application name\n!Status\n!Description and features\n!Platform\n!Price\n|-\n|Cauzality\n|\n| An online tool to create knowledge maps.\nFeatures:\n* Collaborative coding of causal links\n* Directed links\n* Display as a network\n|\n|\n|-\n|Compendium Institute\n|\n|Provides a visual interface which aims to manage connections between ideas and information.\n|\n|\n|-\n|DAGitty\n|\n| An environment for editing, analysing and creating causal diagrams.\nFeatures:\n* Directed links\n* Display as a network\n* Display causal influence via networks\n* Corresponding R package 'daggity'\n|\n|\n|-\n|Decision Explorer\n|\n| A tool to help understand qualitative information.\nFeatures:\n* Directed links\n* Quantitative analysis of coding\n* Display as a network\n|\n|\n|-\n|Graph Commons\n|\n|Focuses on transforming data into interactive maps.\nFeatures:\n• Directed links\n• Display as a network\n• API\n|\n|\n|-\n|Group Wisdom\n|\n| Social research platform with group concept mapping.\nFeatures:\n* Ability to deal with multiple sources\n* Display as a network\n|\n|\n|-\n|Causal Map\n|\n| An online research tool that allows the coding of text to build a causal map.\nFeatures:\n* Qualitative coding of causal links in text\n* Display as a network\n* Filter and query the network\n* Ability to deal with multiple sources\n|\n|\n|-\n|Insight Maker\n|\n|Causal loop diagram builder.
