According to David McDowall, the rebellion continued in April 1911 upon Nadim's return to Constantinople, and the Hamawand were reportedly still in rebellion when World War I began, but this is not mentioned in Gökhan Çetinsaya's account, which simply relates that \"the Hamawand terror in the region lasted about two years and was suppressed only by considerable force.\"\nReferences"
