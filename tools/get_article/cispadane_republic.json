The congress was formed by representatives from the provinces of Modena, Bologna, Ferrara and Reggio Emilia, all located south of the Po; Cispadane indicates \"on this side of (the river) Po\", with the corresponding Transpadane indicating \"across (the river) Po\".\nThe congress was unofficially organized by Napoleon, whose French army had swept through northern Italy earlier in the year, and who needed to settle the situation in Italy and gather new troops for an offensive against Austria.\nThe congress proclaimed that the four provinces would form the : a civic guard, composed of mounted hunters and artillery, was formed. In the 7 January 1797 session, in Reggio Emilia, the congress decided to form a government.\nThe flag, the first tricolour in Italy, was a horizontal tricolour, with red (top), white and green stripes. In the centre was an emblem composed of a quiver, accolade to a war trophy, with four arrows that symbolized the four provinces forming the Republic, all within a crown of bay. The Cispadane Republic was the first Italian sovereign state to adopt the Italian tricolour as its flag.\nOn 29 June 1797, the Cispadane Republic united with the Transpadane Republic to form the Cisalpine Republic.\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n* }}\n*\nSee also\n* Historical states of Italy\n* French client republic"
