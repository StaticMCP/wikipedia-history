De facto, the ruler of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi  holds the presidency and the ruler of the Emirate of Dubai holds the premiership. The president is also the commander-in-chief of the UAE Armed Forces.\nSheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan was widely credited with unifying the seven emirates into one federal state. He was the UAE's first president from the formation of the UAE until his death on 2 November 2004. He was succeeded by his son, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed, who died in office on 13 May 2022. Following his brother Khalifa's death, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan was elected the third and current president of the UAE by the Federal Supreme Council on 14 May 2022.\nList of officeholders (1971–present)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Portrait\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Name\n! colspan=\"3\" | Term of office\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Emirate\n|-\n!
