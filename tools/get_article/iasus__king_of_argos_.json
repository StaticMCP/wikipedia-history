In a Scholia on Euripides' Orestes, Triopas and Sosis are called his parents and Pelasgus is his brother. Pausanias described Iasus as the son of Triopas (son of Phorbas) and brother of Agenor. Generally most scholars agree that Iasus was the father of Io by Leucane. Possibly by the latter, he also fathered Arestor, father of Pelasgus who migrated to Arcadia.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Comparative table of Iasus' family\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"  |Relation\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Names\n! colspan=\"7\" |Sources\n|-\n|Hellanicus\n|Sch. on Homer\n|Sch. on Eurip.\n|Herodotus\n|Apollodorus\n|Pausanias\n|Eustathius\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Parentage\n|Phoroneus\n|✓\n|✓\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|✓\n|-\n|Triopas and Sois\n|\n|\n|✓\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Argus\n|\n|\n|\n|✓\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Argus and Ismene\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|✓\n|\n|\n|-\n|Triopas\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|✓\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\"  |Siblings\n|Agenor\n|✓\n|✓\n|\n|\n|\n|✓\n|✓\n|-\n|Pelasgus\n|✓\n|✓\n|✓\n|\n|\n|✓\n|✓\n|-\n|Argus Panoptes\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|✓\n|\n|\n|-\n|Messene\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|✓\n|\n|-\n|Wife\n|Leucane\n|\n|\n|✓\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Children\n|Io\n|\n|\n|✓\n|✓\n|✓\n|✓\n|\n|-\n|Arestor\n|\n|\n|✓\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nReign\nAfter the death of Phoroneus, the two elder brothers, Pelasgus and Iasus, divided his dominions between themselves in such a manner that Pelasgus received the country about the river Erasmus, and built Larissa, and Iasus the country about Elis. After the death of these two, Agenor, the youngest, invaded their dominions, and thus became king of Argos. According to Pausanias, he was the successor of his father Triopas on the throne of Argos while his brother Agenor succeeded him as the king afterwards.\nNotes\nReferences\n* Apollodorus, The Library with an English Translation by Sir James George Frazer, F.B.A., F.R.S. in 2 Volumes, Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1921.
