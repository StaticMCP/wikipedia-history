He joined Southampton as a trainee in November 1932, signing as a professional the following April. According to Holley & Chalk's \"The Alphabet of the Saints\" he \"used his sturdy build to good effect and served the club well for five years\".\nHis first appearance for the Division Two side was away to Newcastle United on 1 December 1934 as a replacement for Stan Woodhouse. He made a total of 13 appearances that season as The Saints narrowly avoided relegation. The following season had a similar pattern with King replacing the aging Woodhouse, making 21 appearances.\nIn 1936–37 he lost his place briefly to Bobby Whitelaw, who had been signed by new manager George Goss as a replacement for the now-retired Woodhouse. On regaining his place, King formed a useful partnership with fellow half-backs Bill Kennedy and Billy Kingdon, but again The Saints struggled to avoid relegation finishing 19th in the table. For the following season he again lost his place, this time to Welsh international Alf Day who had arrived on a free transfer from Millwall. Once King got back into the side in December he played in the remainder of the season's matches. He started the following season but after the match against West Bromwich Albion on 1 October 1938, he was replaced by the former Arsenal player Ray Parkin who had dropped back from his previous role as an inside forward.\nAlthough he was retained by Southampton, he returned to Plymouth in 1939 and had started work in the Devonport dockyards before Darlington found he was available and signed him on loan in July. The outbreak of World War II prevented him making any appearances for Darlington.\nCareer after football\nDuring the war he joined the Royal Air Force serving in India, and the Burma Campaign as a Sergeant. After the war he returned to Hampshire and became a prison officer.\nReferences"
