Please note that, all the Oscan monetary legends are retrograde, as the one running clockwise on the copy reproduced in the margin\n| caption_right =  Helmeted soldier standing front, head right, holding inverted spear, right foot on (Roman?) standard; left foot on uncertain object; recumbent bull to his right, Oscan \"A\" in exergue.\n| width = 300\n| footer = AR, 3,60 g\n| position = right\n| margin = 0\n| background =\n}}\nThe family of Social War coinage includes all the coins issued by the Italic allies of the Marsic confederation, Marsi, Peligni, Piceni, Vestini, Samnites, Frentani, Marrucini, and Lucani, during the Social War (91–88 BC) against Rome.\nInspired by the Roman denarius, their circulation (and perhaps their release) continued even after the conflict ended, contemporary and promiscuously with their republican models.\nIssues\nTypes\nCoins issued during the Social War consist chiefly of silver coins of the weight of the contemporary Roman denarius, and they are thought to have been issued from the mints of Corfinium and Aesernia.\nThis coinage belongs to the crucial years of the revolt against Rome (90–89 BC). Similar coins of the same family may have been struck later, although there is no firm evidence of this.\nThey circulated in parallel and openly with the Roman denarii of the same weight,. Furthermore, some isolated exempla come from stratigraphic contexts much more recent than the insurrection against Rome.\nExamples of silver denarius\nOne coin that circulated during the Social Wars was a silver denarius coin that on the front side depicted Bacchus with a wreath and on the back depicted the Italian bull goring the Roman wolf. There is an inscription in Oscan on both sides.\nAnother example of a silver denarius personifies Italia on one side, and on the other shows eight warriors swearing an oath.\nThe unique gold stater\nThere is also in the Paris Collection a well-preserved single gold stater of Attic weight of 8.47 gr. (a picture of this coin can be seen [http://numismatica-classica.lamoneta.it/moneta/R-RRG/30 here]. A drawing is in [https://archive.org/stream/dieoskischenmnz01friegoog#page/n90/mode/1up] ) and its first appearance dates back to 1827, although Julius Friedländer reported 1830:\n*Obverse: head of young Dionysos right, crowned with ivy wreath.\n*Reverse: Cista mystica adorned with three wreaths and with a wolf (or panther) skin on the top; thyrsos with ribbons; in exergue, Oscan retrograde legend  mi.ieíis.mi, (a certain and otherwise unknown Minatius Jegius, Minatii f. (?)).\nThe authenticity of this coin is disputed. The genuineness of the piece was supported by Julius Friedländer in his fundamental work about Oscan coinage with an argument based on the perfect accuracy of the legend when compared with the poor knowledge of the Oscan alphabet and language at the time the coin first appeared before the pioneering works of Klenze (1839), Mommsen (1845) and Lepsius (1841). The coin, in particular, shows a perfect distinction between i and stressed í (the difference, in Oscan script, is the addiction of a little line), a distinction that none were aware of before the work of Klenze.\nArguments against the coin's authenticity come from Secondina Lorenza Cesano and Alberto Campana, who very closely follows Cesano reasoning.\nIconography\nSome of the iconographic themes were original, while others were borrowed from the Roman coinage.\nWhen borrowed, the themes acquired new meanings or resonances. For example, the heads on the obverse was usually a personification of Italia depicted as a goddess with a helmet, which replaced the head of Rome, accompanied by a legend reproducing his name, ITALIA, in the Latin alphabet or VITELIU (víteliú = Italia) in Oscan alphabet (there is a unique copy, actually in the de Blacas collection, known to report the double LVITELLIU [vítelliú]).\nInscriptions\nThe inscriptions were partly in Oscan and partly in Latin characters. The pieces were struck by a central mint with two different and simultaneous issues, one for the Oscan-speaking and one for the Latin-speaking citizens.\nLegends often record the names of the chief leaders of the Revolt: Quintus Poppaedius Silo, Gaius Papius Mutilus, with his title Imperator, an unknown Numerius Lucius (?), and others.\nSee also\n*Roman Republican currency\n*Ancient Greek coinage\n*History of coins in Italy\n*Coinage of Aesernia\nReferences\nSources\n*(in Italian) Alberto Campana, La monetazione degli insorti italici durante la Guerra Sociale (91–87 a.C.), Apparuti edizioni, Soliera, 1987\n*(in Italian) Secondina Lorenza Cesano, Di Uranio Antonino e di altre falsificazioni (About Uranius Antoninus and other falsifications), in Rivista Italiana di Numismatica e Scienze Affini, pp.&nbsp;35–69\n*(in German) Julius Friedländer, [https://archive.org/details/dieoskischenmnz01friegoog Die oskischen Münzen], Lipsia, 1850\n*(in French) Theodor Mommsen, Louis de Blacas, Histoire de la monnaie romaine, Paris, 1865–1875\n*This article incorporates text from:\n**Barclay Vincent Head (1844–1914), Historia Numorum, a Manual of Greek Numismatics, Oxford: 1887; 2° ed.
