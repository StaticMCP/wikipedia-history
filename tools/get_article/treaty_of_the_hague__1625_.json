Intended as the basis of an international coalition against Emperor Ferdinand II, additional parties were invited to join, including France, Sweden, the Republic of Venice, Savoy and any other members of the Holy Roman Empire, although they failed to do so.\nGeorge Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham and his agent Sackville Crowe attempted to raise money for the alliance by pawning royal jewels and plate in The Hague and Amsterdam, but were not wholly successful and many of the jewels were returned to England.\nSee also\n*List of treaties\n*Thirty Years' War\nReferences\nSources\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=mDPF4ILESaUC&pg=PA277 Text of the Treaty]\n*[http://www.timeref.com/hstt65.htm Timeline: 1625-1649]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080114081754/http://vietnamnews.vnanet.vn/2004-12/09/Columns/In%20History.htm December 9 in History]"
