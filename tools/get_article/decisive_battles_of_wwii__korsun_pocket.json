Trotter declared Korsun Pocket \"the best wargame ever made for the PC.\" He praised its combination of extreme detail and accessibility, and argued that \"it can be mastered by any novice willing to invest the time and patience\", despite single turns requiring an hour of play. Trotter concluded, \"It is the Mount Everest, the Beethoven's Ninth, and Moby Dick of PC wargames, and it absolutely qualifies as a genuine work of art.\" Similarly, Bruce Geryk of Computer Gaming World called Korsun Pocket \"the best hex-based computer wargame ever made\", and echoed Trotter's praise of its high level of detail. He wrote, \"Korsun Pocket manages to capture everything that's compelling about historical wargaming, exclude the tedium, and present it as a tremendous game.\" Writing for GameSpot, Jeff Lackey echoed Geryk's and Trotter's praise: Korsun Pocket is \"easily the best 2D wargame for the PC to date\", he argued.\nThe editors of Computer Gaming World named Korsun Pocket the 2003 \"Wargame of the Year\".
