Written by Ikki Matsumoto and Wataru Kuniyasu, the single was released on May 26, 1986, by Warner Pioneer through the Reprise label. It was also the second single from her third compilation album ''CD'87''.\nBackground\nThe first day of recording occurred on 8 April 1986, on the same day, when fellow younger idol-singer Yukiko Okada committed suicide. Knowing this news, Akina was unable to start recording due to intense emotional impact, resulting recording to be finished on the last minute.\nNakamori self-covered the song twice: in 1995, under subtitle \"Renewal\" and was included in the compilation album True Album Akina 95 Best and in 2024 under subtitle \"Jazz version\".\nChart performance\nThe single became Nakamori's 12th No. 1 on Oricon's weekly singles chart and sold over 357,600 copies.\nTrack listing\n| lyrics1       = Ikki Matsumoto\n| music1        = Wataru Kuniyasu\n| extra1        = Shingo Kobayashi\n| length1       = 4:27\n| title2        = Saigo no Carmen\n| note2         =\n| lyrics2       = Keiko Asō\n| music2        = Takashi Tsushimi\n| extra2        = Kazuo Shiina\n| length2       = 4:28\n}}\n| lyrics3       = Matsumoto\n| music3        = Kuniyasu\n| length3       =\n}}\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Chart (1986)\n! scope=\"col\" | Peakposition\n|-\n|Japan (Oricon)\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|}\nCover versions\n* Hong-Kong singer Samantha Lam covered the song in Cantonese as \"教堂派對\" on her 1987 album 因你別離 時光影印機 因我愛你\n* Composer Wataru Kuniyasu self-covered the song on his 1988 compilation album ''Wataru Kuniyasu's Best Hits.\n* Yuki Murakami covered the song on her 2014 album Piano Woman: Tomodachi kara''.\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\"| Format(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Serial number\n! scope=\"col\"| Label(s)\n! scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n| 1986\n| 7inch LP\n| L-1670\n| Warner Pioneer\n|\n|-\n| 1988\n| 8cm CD, CT\n| 10SL-145, 10L5-4054\n| Warner Pioneer\n|\n|-\n| 1998\n| 12cm CD\n| WPC6-8672\n| Warner Pioneer\n|\n|-\n| 2008\n| Digital download\n| -\n| Warner Pioneer\n|\n|-\n| 2014\n| Digital download - remaster\n| -\n| Warner Pioneer\n|\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n*1986 in Japanese music\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
