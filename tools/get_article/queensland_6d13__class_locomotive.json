The wheel sets came from B15 class locomotives, and the cylinders were purchased for an aborted project. Per Queensland Railway's classification system, they were designated the 6D13½ class, 6D representing they were a tank locomotive with six wheels, and the 13½ the cylinder diameter in inches.\nThey were generally used as shunters in Brisbane, but on occasions were used in Toowoomba and Warwick. In 1937–1938, all were converted to 0-6-0 tender locomotives and reclassified as the B13½ class with tenders from B13 and C15 class locomotives.\nClass list\n{|cellpadding=\"2\"\n|\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Number\n!Worksnumber\n!In service\n!Notes\n|-\n|align=center|396\n|align=center|2\n|align=center|July 1904\n|\n|-\n|align=center|397\n|align=center|3\n|align=center|August 1904\n|\n|-\n|align=center|398\n|align=center|4\n|align=center|October 1904\n|Preserved at Workshops Rail Museum\n|-\n|align=center|399\n|align=center|5\n|align=center|November 1904\n|\n|-\n|align=center|400\n|align=center|6\n|align=center|February 1905\n|\n|-\n|align=center|401\n|align=center|7\n|align=center|April 1905\n|\n|-\n|}\n|}\nPreservation\nOne has been preserved:\n*398 \"Pompey\" at the Workshops Rail Museum\nReferences"
