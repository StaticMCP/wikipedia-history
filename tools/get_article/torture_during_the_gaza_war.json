This torture has been reported by the United Nations, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, as well as Israeli nonprofit human rights organizations such as Physicians for Human Rights Israel and B'Tselem.\nAccording to these sources, Palestinian men, women and children in Gaza and in detainment in Israel in locations such as the Sde Teiman detention camp have been subjected to rape, gang-rape, sexualized torture, and mutilation, among other forms of sexual violence, as well as psychological and physical torture by both male and female Israeli soldiers and medical staff.\nSome of the victims were United Nations staff forced to confess to terrorism offenses. Multiple reports also speak of prisoners who suffered from medical neglect for injuries sustained, which led to cases of arm and leg amputations. Their testimonies have been corroborated by whistleblowing Israeli staff and a CNN investigation.\nAs of August 2024, at least 53 Palestinian detainees have died in Israeli military facilities since the beginning of the war. Numerous Palestinian detainees have provided testimony of torture by Israeli forces, including during interrogations, Israeli prison guards also spoke out. There were further reports of the Israeli torture of accused militants.\nIn response, Shin Bet officials stated they conduct militant interrogations within the Israeli legal framework. According to Yuval Ginbar, torture is considered legal under certain circumstances.\nBackground\nTorture, ill-treatment, and sexual violence of detained Palestinians by Israel, have been reportedly prevalent for years before the 7 October attacks and invasion of Gaza, with documentation recorded by the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI) and Amnesty International. There has been extensive sexual violence against both male and female detainees, with the most notable case of imprisoned Lebanese Amal leader Mustafa Dirani, who sued Israel on the claim of rape. According to the United Nations Convention Against Torture, torture is defined as \"any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person\" in order to extract information or serve out punishment.\nReports of Israeli torture\nDoctors reported humiliation, beatings, and being forced to kneel for hours. One released man from Shuja'iyya, Gaza City reported beatings, stating that a female Israeli soldier would beat a 72-year-old man. Another stated soldiers forced detainees to bark like dogs. A twenty-year-old man detained in the West Bank stated that he was blindfolded, beaten, burned with a cigarette, and treated \"like an animal\". Three brothers detained from the Gaza Strip described similar treatment in Israel prison, stating they were beaten, stripped to their underwear, and burnt with cigarettes. One released man stated, \"They let dogs urinate on us and shoved sand on us. They threatened to shoot us.\"\nOthers described both physical and psychological torture. Five men reported being tortured over ten hours, including being beaten and submerged in cold water. One man stated that Palestinian prisoners were being \"tortured relentlessly\". He stated the detainees had been starved for three days. In a report by the Ministry of Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs, a detainee stated, \"I heard the sound of detainees who are getting tortured and beaten, as they are being cursed on by soldiers\".\nBy NGOs\nAmnesty International\nIn November 2023, Amnesty International reported on cases of torture and degrading treatment by Israeli authorities, which it described as \"horrifying\", \"gruesome\", and \"a particularly chilling public display of torture and humiliation of Palestinian detainees.\" Amnesty's Secretary General, Agnès Callamard, stated, \"Arbitrary detention and torture and other ill-treatment are war crimes when committed against protected persons in an occupied territory.\" In July 2024, Amnesty interviewed 27 released detainees, who stated they had been subjected to torture on at least one occasion while in Israeli prison.\nUnited Nations\nThe United Nations Human Rights Office in the occupied Palestinian territories called for an investigation into allegations of torture. In a statement, the Office said: \"The massive rise in number of Palestinians arrested and detained, the number of reports of ill-treatment and humiliation suffered by those in custody, and the reported failure to adhere to basic due process raise serious questions about Israel's compliance with international humanitarian law and international human rights law.\" On 19 January 2024, the Human Rights Office stated they had interviewed detainees who \"described being beaten, humiliated, subjected to ill-treatment, and to what may amount to torture... consistent with reports our Office has been gathering of the detention of Palestinians on a broad scale.\" On 19 January 2024, Ajith Sunghay, a Human Rights Office official stated, \"There are reports of men who are subsequently released but only in diapers without any adequate clothing in this cold weather.\"\nIn March 2024, a UNRWA report reported instances of torture documented in Israeli prisons, including beatings and sexual assault. Some UNRWA employees reported being tortured to extract forced confessions. In an April 2024 report, UNRWA stated, \"Male victims reported beatings to their genitals, while one detainee reported being made to sit on an electrical probe.\" In a July 2024 report, the UN stated that Israel had used dogs and waterboarding on Gazan detainees, and that at least 53 died. A group of United Nations special rapporteurs stated in August 2024 that they had received substantiated reports of \"widespread abuse, torture, sexual assault and rape\". The experts stated further that survivors reported \"being attacked by dogs, waterboarding, suspension from ceilings and severe sexual and gender-based violence.\"\nIsraeli NGOs\nThe Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI) stated that there was a \"lot of evidence of cases of violence and cruel and humiliating treatment by prison guards\", and called for an investigation into the deaths of detainees in Israeli custody. PCATI stated they had documented nine clear instances of torture, including sexual violence. Addameer reported that prisoners remained blindfolded and handcuffed during their detention and people were being killed in the military camps. Addameer further reported, \"Statistics and documented testimonies from child detainees indicate that the majority of detained children have been subjected to one or more forms of physical and psychological torture.\" Adalah reported, \"We're seeing really widespread and systemic use of many, many tools in order to inflict torture and ill-treatment on Palestinians\". In July 2024, the executive director of HaMoked stated, \"Violence is pervasive. It's very overcrowded. Every prisoner that we've met with has lost 30 pounds.\"\nOn 5 August 2024, B'Tselem released a report finding that Israeli torture of Palestinian detainees was so systemic and institutionalized that it should now be considered state policy. In its report, B'Tselem stated that \"every inmate is deliberately subjected to severe, relentless pain and suffering, operate as de-facto torture camps.\" They further stated that prisoners were subjected to beatings, humiliation, sleep deprivation, and sexual violence. Director Yuli Novak said that Israel was running torture camps, whose conditions the organization blamed on Itamar Ben-Gvir, the minister in charge of Israel's prison system.\nHuman Rights Watch\nOn 3 January 2024, Human Rights Watch reported that Palestinian workers from Gaza detained in Israel since October 7 had been photographed naked, attacked by dogs, and dragged faced down in the gravel. In August 2024, an HRW report stated that released healthcare workers from Gaza described \"humiliation, beatings, forced stress positions, prolonged cuffing and blindfolding, and denial of medical care. They also reported torture, including rape and sexual abuse by Israeli forces, denial of medical care, and poor detention conditions\" while in Israel detention. A surgeon detained in Israeli prison stated, \"Every minute we were beaten. I mean all over the body, on sensitive areas between the legs, the chest, the back. We were kicked all over the body and the face. They used the front of their boots which had a metal tip, then their weapons.\"\nOther reports\nIn a report on allegations of torture in Israeli prisons, Euro-Med Monitor stated prisoners were being treated like animals. The Wall Street Journal found detainees underwent psychological and physical abuse, including beatings during interrogations. The Commission for Detainees' Affairs alleged that prisoners and detainees were subject to bans on going outside, confiscation of belongings, reduction in food, torture and beatings, and deprivation of medical attention by Israeli authorities. A Defence for Children International report included the testimony of an incarcerated child who stated, \"Around 18 children were severely beaten, screaming in pain. I saw police dogs attacking them, bleeding from the mouth and head.\" An additional Defence for Children report stated that the Israeli military was \"systematically detaining and torturing\" Palestinian children from Gaza.\nIn December 2023, the New York Times reported that Israel had interrogated medical personnel in Gaza under duress.

Following his release from Israeli prison, a Palestinian detainee from Bethlehem stated, \"We were unjustly detained, killed and severely beaten with iron clubs and subjected to all kinds of torture\". A man detained from Gaza stated, \"For 55 days, I was handcuffed, blindfolded, deprived from sleeping, no rest, even food they brought us was for animals... They dealt with us as non-humans\". One man stated that before interrogations, he was kept in a room where bright lights and blaring music were used all day and night, stating, \"I would stay there two or three days, the music didn't stop, not even for a second. It hurt me mentally\". Eight detainees released from Israeli prison in late-July stated they were tortured during their imprisonment.\nA released prisoner stated, \"There are people who have gone mad and urinate on themselves...

In September 2024, +972 Magazine reported the spread of scabies among prisoners, with a dermatologist stating that \"scabies can be effectively treated, but containing the outbreak requires sanitary living conditions. The failure of the IPS to do so suggests that the spread of the disease among prisoners has become, in effect, a part of their punishment\".\nIn March 2025, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club, a non-governmental organization that advocates for the rights and welfare of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, reported that a 17-year-old teenager named Walid Khaled Abdullah Ahmad died in Megiddo prison due to unknown circumstances while under Israeli custody. Ahmad was originally detained by Israeli forces on 30 September 2024, from the town of Silwad.\nPosted to social media\nVideos posted to social media, appearing to show IDF troops subjecting Palestinian detainees to physical, sexual and verbal abuse. One such video was posted at around 31 October and showed a group of Palestinian men blindfolded with their hands and feet bound and mostly stripped naked being physically assaulted by uniformed IDF soldiers. The soldiers involved were reportedly being investigated by IDF officials, per a later statement. A Palestinian woman recounted that about 30 minutes after her husband was arrested by IDF troops she was sent a link to a video on social media, depicting her husband in IDF custody bound and kneeling before a soldier who can be heard yelling expletives in Arabic while kicking him in the stomach.\nIn a Telegram group created after the 7 October attacks, by the IDF Influencing Department and had over 10,500 subscribers as of December 2023, videos of Palestinians being degraded and mocked with dehumanizing language.

The allegations of torture came from staff who stated they were forced to make confessions under torture and ill-treatment, including \"beatings, sleep deprivation, sexual abuse and threats of sexual violence against both men and women\" in Israeli detention. Detainees reported being stripped down to their underwear and forced completely naked. The report found that UN staff were \"pressured to make false statements against the Agency, including that the Agency has affiliations with Hamas and that UNRWA staff members took part in the 7 October 2023 atrocities\" through beatings, waterboarding, and threats to their families.\nIn a statement, the UNRWA communications director stated, \"When the war comes to an end there needs to be a series of inquiries to look into all violations of human rights\".

One detainee told Amnesty that Israeli interrogators beat him severely, resulting in three broken ribs, and ordered Palestinian detainees to \"praise Israel and curse Hamas\". Dr. Shai Gortler, who studies incarceration and torture, stated that Shin Bet allows media exposure \"to put forward its own narrative about its actions, torture included\", among other reasons.\nThe Associated Press analyzed six interrogation videos released by Israel and said the militants may have been speaking under duress. In the videos, the militants appear to be bloodied and wincing in pain. Likewise, on 29 October, an article in Global News said some of the confession videos of Hamas militants could have been produced under duress. AP additionally found that a confession video Israel released showed the captured militant was speaking \"clearly under duress\".\nPublic Committee Against Torture in Israel stated Shin Bet uses extreme heat and cold, sleep deprivation and stress positions during interrogations. In an analysis, NBC News stated that in one of the confession videos, the militant had blood on his shirt and bruises on his face, which Israel stated came from capture in combat. In November 2023, a Palestinian man (accused by Israel to be a militant) was released as part of the prisoner exchange and said he was repeatedly asked by Israeli soldiers to make confessions with \"a gun to his face\".\nWar crimes\nIsraeli explanations\nIn November 2023, Shin Bet said they have conducted interrogations under strict legal frameworks, aiming to gather confessions and intelligence for immediate and future use. The interrogation settings, as reported, were intense, with the suspects often bound and held in improvised facilities. They cited a 1999 Israeli Supreme Court ruling that prohibited torture  except for a \"ticking bomb\" scenario.\nReactions\nFollowing the death of Adnan al-Bursh, the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, Addameer, Al Mezan, and Al-Haq released a joint statement calling for \"immediate and concrete action\" by the international community to ensure investigative access into Israeli prisons. In May 2024, Addameer called on the International Criminal Court to investigate Israel's \"systematic torture\" of Palestinians as a war crime. Basil Farraj, a professor at Birzeit University, stated, \"We are now talking about an intensification of the torture practices, including systematic medical negligence and systematic starvation.\" Alice Jill Edwards, the UN special rapporteur on torture, called on Israel to allow \"access to international human rights and humanitarian observers\". Former Guantanamo Bay detainees compared images they were seeing from Israel to their experiences in Guantanamo. An attorney who visited the Sde Teiman detention center in June 2024 stated, \"The situation there is more horrific than anything we've heard about Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo.\" In July 2024, the UN human rights office stated the abuse and torture of Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons was \"unacceptable\" and called for an independent investigation.\nSee also\n* Mass detentions in the Gaza war\n* Sexual and gender-based violence against Palestinians during the Gaza war\n* Torture during the Algerian War\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/countries/opt/20240731-Thematic-report-Detention-context-Gaza-hostilities.pdf Detention in the context of the escalation of hostilities in Gaza (October 2023-June 2024)] (31 July 2024), per the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights"
