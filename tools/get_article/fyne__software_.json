It allows application software to run on multiple desktop, mobile operating systems, Web browsers (via WebAssembly) and embedded devices (embedded Linux) from a single code base. Fyne is inspired by the principles of Material Design to create applications that look and behave consistently. It uses OpenGL to provide cross-platform GUIs.\nFyne is licensed under the terms of the 3-clause BSD License, supporting the creation of free and proprietary applications. In December 2019 Fyne became the most popular GUI toolkit for Go, by GitHub star count and in early February 2020 it was trending as #1 project in GitHub trending ranks.\nDevelopment\nFyne is currently developed by a team of volunteers and is supported by around 100 contributors. The team meet at a conference held each year along with invited speakers and members of the community.\nThe Fyne toolkit is written primarily in Go. The team focuses on clean APIs and follows the principles of Clean Code to sustain maintainability of the project. All Fyne projects are continuously tested to check correctness, stability as well as formatting and documentation.\nDesign\nDesign of the Fyne API and user interface components follows a careful process to ensure the simplicity. The Fyne toolkit is built in various layers, with each in separate packages.\nAPI\nAPI, or Application programming interface, is an interface or protocol that allows for communication across different parts of the software. Fyne has a self-documenting API that is also extensible resulting in the ability for each developer to create custom tools unique to their project that will mesh with Fyne itself.\nVector graphics\nThe use of vector graphics to paint the UI provides a method of adapting to different device and display sizes without losing image fidelity. This allows the programmer to only need to create the UI once and it will look as expected on any device.\nScreenshot\nThe following is an illustration of some of the widgets from the fyne demo application.\nFyneDesk\nThe Fyne toolkit also powers the \"FyneDesk\" project - a new Unix desktop environment.\nThis desktop forms the foundation of the FyshOS operating system which delivers a complete desktop operating system using only Fyne apps for the user interface.\nUse\nThe largest project currently using the Fyne toolkit is the FyneDesk project, a complete desktop environment for Linux. A popular music player, Supersonic, has been created with the Fyne toolkit. There is also a graphical app editor, Apptrix, created with Fyne that makes it easier to build apps with this technology.\nThere are many other applications being built using the toolkit; those that are open source can be found in an application listing website managed by the project.\nThe Fyne toolkit is used in many popular publications to introduce people into building cross platform applications and personal projects. There have been 15 articles published in The Linux Magazine since November 2021.\nLinux Format published 3 articles, including an interview with the founder in a \"Fyne times\" feature.\nMany businesses are using the Fyne toolkit for their internal and utility applications, including Tuffnells, Tailscale and others.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://demo.fyne.io Fyne demo online]\n* [https://fyne.io/develop/ Developer guides]\n* [https://godoc.org/fyne.io/fyne/v2 GoDoc documentation]"
