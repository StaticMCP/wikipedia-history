This is a kingdom historically imputed by some to be of Irish origin. It was located in Scotland and Ireland. It has been stated that kings of Dál Riata, along with later rulers of Alba and of Scotland, traced their descent from Fergus Mór mac Eirc, and even in the 16th century, James VI of Scotland called himself the \"happie monarch sprung of Ferguse race\".\nGenetic analysis however, suggests an influx of Rb1/Celt in 50-100 CE, likely with Gaulish customs, that created a new Kingdom over the following centuries, eventually crowned as ‘King of the Scots and Picts’. Claudius defeat of the then King of Britain, Caractacus, is a likely driver for this ‘new’ genetic marker, more often found today in Highland clans, than in Ireland.\nBackground\nIt is not until the middle of the 6th century that Irish annals plausibly report the deaths of kings of Dál Riata, with the death of Comgall mac Domangairt, c. 538–545, and of his brother Gabrán, c. 558–560. After the disastrous Battle of Moira (Mag Rath) in 637, Irish Dál Riata lost possession of its Scottish lands. During the 8th century, the rival Dál nAraidi had overrun Irish Dál Riata, though the area retained its name well into the 14th century.\nThe last attested king of Scottish Dál Riata is Fergus mac Echdach, brother of and successor to Áed Find, whose death is reported in the Annals of Ulster in 781. Dál Riata was divided into a number of kingroups or dynasties, called cenéla, among which was the Cenél nGabráin of Kintyre, who claimed descent from Gabrán mac Domangairt, and the Cenél Loairn, who claimed descent from Loarn mac Eirc. While the Irish origin of the Kings of Dál Riata is unquestionable, the links to the Irish nobility were likely exaggerated in later centuries to claim foundership of the kingdom in an effort to add legitimacy to the dynasties.\nKings of Dál Riata\nKings before the Battle of Mag Rath\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse\"\n|- align=left\n! width=\"10%\"|Reign\n! width=\"10%\"|Ruler\n! width=\"20%\"|Name\n! width=\"25%\"|Family\n! width=\"35%\"|Remarks\n|-valign=top\n|Unknown\n|Erc of Dál Riata\n|Erc mac Eochaid\n|Son of Eochaid Muinremuir\n|\n|-valign=top\n|Unknown\n|Loarn mac Eirc\n|Loarn mac Eirc\n|Son of Erc\n|Eponymous founder of the Cenél Loairn; claimed ancestry probably spurious\n|-valign=top\n|498-501\n|Fergus Mór\n|Fergus Mór mac EircMac Nisse Mór\n|Son of Erc\n|Mac Nisse Mór is more likely the real figure who was replaced by Fergus Mor; Annals of Tigernach report his death c. 501.
