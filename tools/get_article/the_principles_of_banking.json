The book considers business cycles as patterns of stable and stressful market behavior, and provides examples illustrating the key principles of bank asset-liability management.

The second edition was published in 2022 and expands upon the original edition, incorporating updates in developments and regulations and in the banking industry, including Basel III Final Form and its constituent elements of The Fundamental Review of the Trading Book, Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book, and Recovery and Resolution Planning, as well as covering the impact of COVID-19 on banks, risk management, and balance sheet management.\nReception\nNihar Mehta, who holds the position of Chief Corporate Development Officer at Monument Bank Ltd in London, expressed his high regard for \"The Principles of Banking\". He considers it the most crucial text for those in the banking industry and strongly believes that it should be an obligatory part of everyone's personal growth agendas. Mr. Mehta drew on his past experiences when he was a part of the UK Financial Services Authority, leading the change in control team. His responsibilities then included scrutinizing and granting regulatory approvals for intricate banking transactions, an example being the takeover of Northern Rock by Virgin Money. During that process, he found himself relying significantly on Professor Choudhry's text as a key reference for acquiring banking licenses.\nTed Teo, an adjunct assistant professor at NUS Business School in Singapore, shared his experience of teaching a banking course. He initially struggled to find suitable textbooks that presented a real-life banking perspective, a challenge he managed to overcome when he discovered books by Professor Choudhry. According to him, Choudhry's books accurately portray the perspective and methodology employed by bankers. They stand out by offering a practical and non-theoretical approach to understanding banking.\nReferences"
