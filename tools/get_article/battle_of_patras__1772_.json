On 23 October, he was joined by Sv. Nikolai and on 27 October by Zabiaka, Slava, Auza, and Modon, which had been detached from Orlov's fleet at Mykonos under Voinovitch. They brought news of an Ottoman force in the Gulf of Patras, so Konyaev and Voinovitch combined forces to look for it.\nOn 5 November, they arrived near Patras, and found 9 30-gun frigates and 12 xebecs at sea, plus 4 xebecs anchored under the guns of the fort.\nOn 6 November, they attacked with their smaller vessels in front due to the narrowness of the channel, and the Ottomans retreated. One xebec ran aground and was destroyed by Sv. Nikolai, Zabiaka, and Modon. Sv. Nikolai and Slava cut off a frigate and another xebec and forced them aground where they were abandoned, and then burnt by Auza. The remaining Ottomans took refuge under the fort.\nIn the afternoon of 7 November, the Russians attacked again, standing back and forth along the Ottoman line to no great effect.\nOn 8 November, they anchored near the Ottoman line, attacking around 11:30 am. By the time around 12 pm, several Ottoman vessels were on fire and abandoned; Konyaev weighed anchor and sent in the boats under protection of Sv. Nikolai, Zabiaka, and Slava to destroy or capture. 7 frigates and 8 xebecs were destroyed, while the remaining frigate and 6 xebecs sailed further up the gulf. The frigate soon ran aground and was destroyed by Slava.\nOn 15 November, Konyaev left for the Aegean Sea.\nShips involved\nRussia (Konyaev)\nTchesma 80\nGraf Orlov 66\nSv.
