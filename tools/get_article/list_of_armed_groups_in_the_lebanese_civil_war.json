      "text": "# List of armed groups in the Lebanese Civil War\n\nThe list of militias in the Lebanese Civil War does not include the \"legal\" Lebanese Army; note that the Army split into two major parts:\n*The Christian-led \"legal\" Lebanese Army favoured the Lebanese Front government\n*The Muslim \"Lebanese Arab Army\" fought for the rival Lebanese National Movement government\nIn addition, there was an autonomous faction within the \"legal\" Lebanese Army called the Army of Free Lebanon. It formed in 1976 and was composed of Maronites and Greek-Catholics reacting against the split with the mainly Muslim Lebanese Arab Army. It continued to be paid by the government, and was fully re-integrated into the \"legal\" army in 1978, with the exception of some units which chose instead to form the South Lebanon Army listed below.\nList\nLebanese Front and other right-wing factions\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"100%\"\n!Militia\n!Fighters\n!Time\n!Demographic\n!Notes\n|-\n|Lebanese Forces\n|10,000-15,000\n|1976-1990\n|Maronite\n|Initially an umbrella organization for Maronite party militias; became an independent power structure in the year 1992.\n|-\n|Army of Free Lebanon\n|3,000\n|1976-1978\n|Christian\n|Dissident faction of the Lebanese Army\n|-\n|Tyous Team of Commandos\n|100\n|1975-1985\n|Maronite\n|\n|-\n|Zahloite Group\n|500\n|1975-1978\n|Christian\n|Formed by a middle-class man against local feudal clans\n|-\n|Kataeb Regulatory Forces\n|10,000-15,000\n|1961-1984\n|Maronite\n|\n|-\n|Kataeb Security Sections\n|1,000\n|1976-1984\n|Maronite\n|The Kataeb party's \"police militia\".
