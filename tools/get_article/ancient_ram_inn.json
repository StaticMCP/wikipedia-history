      "text": "# Ancient Ram Inn\n\nThe Ancient Ram Inn is a Grade II* listed building and a former pub located in Wotton-under-Edge, a market town within the Stroud district of Gloucestershire, England.  This inn was said to have also been owned by the local St. Mary's Church when first built. The late medieval building was remodelled in the mid to late 16th century.\nIt now operates as a guesthouse, and its owners advertise it as \"the most haunted building in England\" with around twenty ghosts said to haunt it. Owner Caroline Humphries has said the building \"kind of evolved into an event location for paranormal activity\" after her father converted it into a guesthouse in 1968.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://ancientraminn.co.uk/ Official website]\n*[https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/oct/31/top10.uk?page=2 Guardian Top ten haunted places in the UK]\n*[https://triskeleheritage.triskelepublishing.com/2023/11/13/mediaeval-myth-busting-blog-26-the-ancient-ram-inn/ Mediaeval Mythbusting Blog #26: The Ancient Ram Inn]"
