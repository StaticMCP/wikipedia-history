Prominent professional photographers present at the first meeting included William England, principal photographer with the London Stereoscopic Company; Richard Keene, who later became a member of The Brotherhood of the Linked Ring and Alfred Seaman who established a large number of studios across the Midlands and North of England. The leading pictorialist photographer Henry Peach Robinson was an early member and was elected President in 1896. William Crooke the prominent Scottish professional photographer was elected president in 1899. Many of the founding members were also members of the Royal Photographic Society but sought to establish an organisation with a more informal and sociable purpose- ‘combining the features of a pleasurable outing with photographic mental friction.’\nAttendance at the first meeting was 48 but grew rapidly over coming years to reach 328 by the 1898 event. The pattern of the convention was to choose a town where they would be 'hosted' by a local photographic society. A large hotel was chosen as the convention headquarters and three to four days were devoted to a programme of lectures, outings, exhibitions and dinners.\nConventions of the Victorian era were held in:\n* 1886 Derby\n* 1887 Glasgow\n* 1888 Birmingham\n* 1889 London\n* 1890 Chester\n* 1892 Edinburgh\n* 1893 Plymouth\n* 1894 Dublin\n* 1895 Shrewsbury\n* 1896 Leeds\n* 1897 Great Yarmouth\n* 1898 Glasgow\n* 1899 Gloucester\n* 1900 Newcastle upon Tyne\n* 1901 Oxford\nDuring the nineteenth century the Convention was a lively focus for debate and experiment around photography.\nTwentieth century meetings included:\n* 1908 Brussels\n* 1912 Amsterdam\nAfter the First World War interest waned and the PCUK was kept running by an increasingly ageing and declining membership. It finally ceased operating in 1935.\nReferences\nSources\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.freewebs.com/jb3d/] Alfred Seaman and the Photographic Convention of the United Kingdom.
