The battle was a minor engagement that Roman sources inflated as a major success. According to Livy, the Romans killed 8,000 Carthaginians and took 700 prisoners for the cost of 500 dead Romans. The Carthaginian loss figures for dead and prisoners appear suspiciously out of proportion to each other. Just north of the battlefield the next day, an irregular clash occurred where allegedly another 2,000 Carthaginians were killed. Afterwards, Nero marched north, where he defeated and killed Hannibal's brother Hasdrubal at Metaurus. The battle is described by Livy at 27.41-42.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
