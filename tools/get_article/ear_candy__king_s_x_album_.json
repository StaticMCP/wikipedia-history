It was produced by Arnold Lanni and King's X.\nThe album has two songs which are rewritten versions of earlier songs: \"Picture\" is also known as \"The Door\", a song with different lyrics, released on their pre-King's X release Sneak Preview. The song \"Mississippi Moon\" is mainly inspired on the song \"If I Could Fly\", which King's X played in shows after they had changed their name to its definite version, King's X.\nThe bonus track \"Freedom\" can also be found as a b-side of the single \"A Box\". It was later given a proper release on the album Ogre Tones.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n*Doug Pinnick – bass, lead vocals\n*Ty Tabor – guitars, backing vocals\n*Jerry Gaskill – drums, backing vocals\nAlbum notes\n*This would be the last studio album King's X would release on Atlantic Records.\n*\"American Cheese (Jerry's Pianto)\" is the second released song to feature Jerry Gaskill on lead vocals.
