It was built by the Canadian National Railway in 1956 and used as a passenger terminal. North Battleford no longer receives scheduled passenger rail service (the closest stations are now served by Via Rail station to the south in Biggar and Unity), and the station is now used as an office space for CNR, and was once the intercity bus terminal.\nThe building is designed in the International Style with a main entrance in the tower; passenger facilities, waiting room and washrooms at one end on the ground floor with baggage and parcel service at the other end; office space on upper floors; much of the original interior finishes, (terrazzo, plaster and linoleum) still services.\nThe building was designated a historic railway station in 1995.\nSee also\n* List of designated heritage railway stations of Canada\nReferences"
