They clearly belong to the central California tradition. (See also Traditional narratives (Native California).)\nOn-line examples of Yuki narratives\n* [http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moajrnl;cc=moajrnl;rgn=full%20text;idno=ahj1472.1-09.004;didno=ahj1472.1-09.004;view=image;seq=0301;node=ahj1472.1-09.004%3A2 \"The Northern California Indians\"] by Stephen Powers (1872)\n* [http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moajrnl;cc=moajrnl;view=image;rgn=main;node=ahj1472.2-03.006%3A13;idno=ahj1472.2-03.006;seq=657 \"Yuka Legends\"] by A.
