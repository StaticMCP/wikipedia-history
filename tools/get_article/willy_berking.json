In the 1930s he played trombone with various dance and entertainment orchestras including the Goldene Sieben and the Telefunken Swing Orchestra under Heinz Wehner, with whom he went to Berlin in 1934. Towards the end of 1943 he became director of the studio orchestra for Imperial records, known as the \"Berking-top series,\" which were excellent, swinging sides, despite the Nazi party ban on swing music. At the same time he directed the propaganda big band, \"Charlie and His Orchestra\".\nAfter the end of World War II continued leading bands, which included Benny de Weille and Louis Freichel as sidemen. Berking was musical director for the Eurovision Song Contest 1957 held in Frankfurt am Main, West Germany.
