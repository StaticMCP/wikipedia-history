It features bronze sculpture by the artist Joseph Durham. It includes statues of the saints Lawrence and Mary Magdalene.\nHistory\nThe fountain was originally installed in 1866 outside the church of St Lawrence Jewry. It was dismantled into 150 pieces in the 1970s which were stored in a vault in the City of London for fifteen years, and after that in a barn at a farm in Epping. The pieces were sent to a foundry in Chichester for reassembly in 2009. The fountain was reassembled in its current location in 2010.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
