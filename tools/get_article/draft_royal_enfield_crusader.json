It was unusual for a British single in that the pushrods were on the left side of the engine, driven by a camshaft in the primary chaincase, with the Lucas alternator in a sealed compartment on the right of the engine. The oversquare engine used a one piece crankshaft.\nA higher performance model, the Crusader Sport, was introduced in 1959.\nAnthony Wilson-Jones, Royal Enfield's Chief Engineer and member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE), approached fellow IMechE member Roland Cross for ideas to improve the performance of Royal Enfield machines. Cross was known for the Cross Rotary Valve engine and his work on liner-less aluminium cylinders. One of the machines Cross carried out development on was a 1963 Crusader Sport, which managed to achieve . Royal Enfield's financial problems led to the project being cancelled before the developments could be applied to production machines.\nIn 1960 a Crusader was entered in the Thruxton 500 endurance race ridden by R. Prowting and M. Munday. The bike won the 250 class.\nThe company was taken over by the E & H P Smith Engineering Group in 1962 who wanted to project a more sporting image for the marque. Former motorcycle racer and winner of the Lightweight TT at the 1932 Isle of Man TT Leo Davenport was put in charge of the company. The Italian-styled Continental was introduced in 1963 and the off-the-shelf learner-legal cafe racer Continental GT in 1965.\nIn 1963 the compression ratio was standardised at 9:1 for all models.\nA 4 valve version of the engine was developed and was due to go into production in 1968.\nModels\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 80%;\"\n|+ Model timeline\n|-\n!

Part of the design brief was that the engine and gearbox mechanisms should be at least as accessible as previous pre-unit models.\nThe engine used the same  bore as the existing  models but with a shorter  stroke making it over-square.\nThe Crusader was introduced in September 1956 and gained much attention at that year's Earls Court Show.\nFive studs retained the cylinder and cylinder head to the crankcases. The engine produced 13 bhp.\nThe bike had an all-welded frame, telescopic forks, full width alloy hubs and an enclosed rear chain.\nThe bike was available fitted with the Airflow fairing and this variant was known as the Crusader Airflow.\nCompression ratio was raised from 8:1 to 8.75:1 in 1962, the final year of the model.\nClipper\nThe Clipper Mk2 was launched in March 1958, production of the pre-unit Clipper having stopped the previous month.\nA variant fitted with the Airflow fairing was available and was known as the Clipper Airflow.\nCompression ratio was raised from 7.5:1 to 8.75:1 in 1962 and then to 9:1 in 1963.\nCrusader Sport\n@ 6,250rpm (claimed)}}\n| torque           =\n| ignition         =\n| fuel_delivery    =  Amal Monobloc\n| transmission     =\n| frame            =\n| suspension       =\n| brakes           =  drum front,  rear}}\n| tires            =\n| rake_trail       =\n| wheelbase        =\n| length           =\n| width            =\n| height           =\n| seat_height      =\n| dry_weight       =\n| wet_weight       =\n| fuel_capacity    =\n| oil_capacity     =\n| fuel_consumption =\n| turning_radius   =\n| range            =\n| ground_clearance =\n| related          =\n| sp               = uk\n| footnotes        =\n}}\nThe Crusader Sport was introduced in September 1958. It was fitted with a lightened flywheel, an alloy head with larger inlet valve, enlarged inlet tract and a larger Amal Monobloc carburettor.

The bike was fitted with dropped handlebars and top speed was close to .\nCompression ratio was raised to 8.75:1 in 1962 and then to 9:1 in 1963.\nA narrower section rear mudguard was fitted in 1963.\nA rev counter, close ratio 4 speed gearbox and a 5 speed gearbox were offered as optional extras from 1963.\nCrusader Super 5\n@ 7,250rpm (claimed)}}\n| torque           =\n| ignition         =\n| fuel_delivery    =  Amal Monobloc\n| transmission     = 5 speed gearbox\n| frame            =\n| suspension       = Front Earles forks\n| brakes           =\n| tires            =\n| rake_trail       =\n| wheelbase        =\n| length           =\n| width            =\n| height           =\n| seat_height      =\n| dry_weight       =\n| wet_weight       =\n| fuel_capacity    =\n| oil_capacity     =\n| fuel_consumption =\n| turning_radius   =\n| range            =\n| ground_clearance =\n| related          =\n| sp               = uk\n| footnotes        =\n}}\nThe Crusader Super 5, more commonly known as just the Super 5, was introduced in 1962. It was fitted with a 5 speed gearbox and was the first British production bike with 5 speeds. Performance was improved compared with the Crusader Sport with higher 9.75:1 compression and a larger carburettor, giving  and a top speed of  in road tests. Earles forks replaced the telescopic forks of previous models. Although the forks worked well and gave good handling and ride, the styling did not fit in with the rest of the bike.\nFor 1963 less valanced chrome mudguards were fitted front and rear and the compression ratio reduced to 9:1.\nCrusader Trials\n@ 7,250rpm (claimed)}}\n| torque           =\n| ignition         =\n| fuel_delivery    =  Amal Monobloc\n| transmission     = 4 speed wide ratio gearbox\n| frame            =\n| suspension       =\n| brakes           =\n| tires            = Front: 275x21, Rear: 400x18\n| rake_trail       =\n| wheelbase        =\n| length           =\n| width            =\n| height           =\n| seat_height      =\n| dry_weight       =\n| wet_weight       =\n| fuel_capacity    =\n| oil_capacity     =\n| fuel_consumption =\n| turning_radius   =\n| range            =\n| ground_clearance =\n| related          =\n| sp               = uk\n| footnotes        =\n}}\nThe Bullet had been a good trials machine, but there was a trend in trials competitions to move towards lightweight bike. A prototype Crusader trials bike was prepared in the late 1950s and on it Benny Crawford won the  in 1960 and again in 1961. Army rider Chris Cullen competed in the 1961 Welsh 3 Day Trial on a Crusader and finished as the highest placed service rider.  A production version of Crawford's machine was shown at the 1961 British Motorcycle Show. The bike had a wide ratio four speed gearbox, a smaller  tank and wasn't fitted with lights. It had a short high-level exhaust and an engine under shield. 21 inch front and 18 inch rear wheels raised ground clearance to .\nCompetitions shop prepared Crusader Trials competed in trials and ISDTs with works riders Peter \"Top Gear\" Gaunt and Peter \"Fearless Fred\" Fletcher.\nContinental\n@ 7,500 rpm\n| torque           =\n| ignition         =\n| fuel_delivery    =  Amal Monobloc\n| transmission     = Wet clutch, 5 speed, chain drive\n| frame            =\n| suspension       =\n| brakes           =  drum front,  rear}}\n| tires            =\n| rake_trail       =\n| wheelbase        =\n| length           =\n| width            =\n| height           =\n| seat_height      =\n| dry_weight       =\n| wet_weight       =\n| fuel_capacity    =\n| oil_capacity     =\n| fuel_consumption =\n| turning_radius   =\n| range            =\n| ground_clearance =\n| related          =\n| sp               = uk\n| footnotes        =\n}}\nThe Continental was introduced in 1963 and had the more sporty appearance it's customers wanted. It was fitted with a 'jelly mould' tank, similar to that on sporty Italian bikes, with a 'Monza' quick filler. Also fitted were dropped handlebars, fly screen, exposed rear springs and an air scoop on the front brake. Enfield's trademark Casquette was replaced by a chrome headlight shell, an alloy casting that held the speedo and rev counter and chequered tape around the exposed top of the stanchions. The engine was to the same specification as the unit fitted to the Super 5.\nA prototype with a SIBA electric start was made but never made it to production.\nTurbo Twin\nAbout 930 machines were produced.\nOlympic\nThe Olympic was announced in 1964, the year of the Tokyo Olympics, to use up spare parts. It was fitted with the Super 5's leading link forks and used a  4 speed engine. Royal Enfield described it as a luxury sports model.\nContinental GT\n| power            = 21bhp @ 7,500rpm\n| torque           =\n| ignition         =\n| fuel_delivery    =  Amal Monobloc\n| transmission     = Wet clutch, 5 speed, chain drive\n| frame            =\n| suspension       =\n| brakes           = Drum\n| tires            =\n| rake_trail       =\n| wheelbase        =\n| length           =\n| width            =\n| height           =\n| seat_height      =\n| dry_weight       =\n| wet_weight       =\n| fuel_capacity    =\n| oil_capacity     =\n| fuel_consumption =\n| turning_radius   =\n| range            =\n| ground_clearance =\n| related          =\n| sp               =\n| footnotes        =\n}}\nThe Continental sold well, but many younger riders modified the bikes with cafe racer parts such as tanks, seats and clip-ons, often brought through specialist dealers such as Deeprose Brothers and Gander and Grey. Davenport came up with the idea of producing a learner-legal, factory customised cafe racer aimed at the young rider and contacted selected Enfield dealers, and especially their apprentices who were in the target age group, for feedback. Draughtsman Reg Thomas was given the responsibility of designing the new bike. At the time dealers were frequently involved in new machine development and London dealer Gander and Grey played a part in the development of the Continental GT.\nStarting with a Crusader Sport, the tank and seat were replaced with a long  fibreglass tank with a quick-filler and a seat with a racing hump. The tank being held in place racing style by a rubber strap. Rear-set footrests, clip-on handlebars, a fly screen and a speedo and rev counter in an alloy casting were fitted. Cooling discs were fitted to the front wheel, but as these were attached to the spokes rather than the hub, were purely visual and did not aid cooling the front brake.\nThe engine was upgraded with the inlet tract opened up to accept a  Amal Monobloc carb fitted with a long bellmouth. Compression ratio was raised to 9.5:1. A rev counter gearbox was fitted to the primary chaincase with drive taken from the camshaft and a large racing style crankcase breather fitted.\nThe Continental GT was launched at London's Ace Cafe, a centre of cafe racer culture, in November 1964. To gain publicity, Royal Enfield planned for a GT to be ridden from John o' Groats to Land's End in under 24 hours by a team of selected journalists. Two stops were scheduled, one at Oulton Park where multiple world champion Geoff Duke was to ride the bike but this was cancelled due to the track being icy. The second stop was at Silverstone, where John \"Mooneyes\" Cooper completed 8 laps, the fastest being at . The whole trip, including the 2 stops at the racetracks was completed in 22 hrs 20 min.\nA number of accessories were offered to further customise the bike through an exclusive deal with Gander and Grey who manufactured the accessories.\nA small number of a US model with high rise handlebars were manufactured in early 1967 prior to the factory's closure. The GT was a good seller and the most successful post-War Royal Enfield. In total around 1,700 examples of the Continental GT were produced.\n'New' Bullet\n| bore_stroke      =\n| compression      = 7.5:1\n| top_speed        =\n| power            = 22bhp @ 6,500rpm\n| torque           =\n| ignition         =\n| fuel_delivery    =  Amal Monobloc\n| transmission     =\n| frame            =\n| suspension       =\n| brakes           =  drum front\n| tires            =\n| rake_trail       =\n| wheelbase        =\n| length           =\n| width            =\n| height           =\n| seat_height      =\n| dry_weight       =\n| wet_weight       =\n| fuel_capacity    = }}\n| oil_capacity     =\n| fuel_consumption =\n| turning_radius   =\n| range            =\n| ground_clearance =\n| related          =\n| sp               =\n| footnotes        =\n}}\nThe pre-unit Bullet was discontinued in 1962 and for 63 a  Bullet based on the Crusader was introduced. This model is commonly referred to as the New Bullet.\nThe competitions department had previously built two 350 cc Crusaders for works trials riders Peter Fletcher and Peter Gaunt. Fletcher's bike had been fitted with a crankshaft from the long-stroke 350 pre-unit Bullet, and an extra outrigger main bearing. Gaunt's bike used an offset crankpin in the 250 Crank to obtain the longer stroke.\nTwo Bullets were built into trials bikes for works riders Peter Fletcher and Peter Gaunt. A 500 cc pre-unit Bullet engine was later shoehorned into Fletcher's bike.\nIn an attempt to win a 1964 contract from the Ministry of Defence, a 350 Bullet was prepared for military use. The contract was awarded to BSA for their B40 WD. The military prepared Bullet is on display at the Imperial War Museum.}} A trials version, the Hounds Arrow was also listed in the Indian catalogue.\nEnfield India Crusader\nIn 1963 Enfield India introduced the Sherpa, powered by a  Villiers 2L two stroke engine made in India under licence. The frame was a lightened and simplified version of that used on the Bullet. Also from the Bullet were the rear shock absorbers, toolboxes and mudguards. Front forks were Dowty units as used on the Ensign.\nThe Sherpa was restyled in 1970 and fitted with the larger Bullet front brake, forks and headlight. The restyled bike was relaunched as the Crusader. Norton Villiers, who owned a 30% stake in Enfield India, were interested in importing the Crusader and the Indian-built Bullet. At the 1972 Earls Court Show there were Crusaders, fitted with SIBA electric starters, on the NV stand, including one modified for police use. There was little interest in the Indian-built bikes so NV dropped plans to import them.\nIn 1980 the engine was increased to , the bike restyled and was relaunched as the Mini Bullet.\nFairings\nAirflow\nDesigner Lawrie Watts had been responsible for the aerodynamics on World Sidecar Champion Eric Oliver's Norton/Watsonian outfit. In 1952 Watts was asked by ''The Motor Cycle's'' editor Harry Louis to produce a streamlined motorcycle for road use. Enfield's chief engineer Wilson-Jones was keen to be involved in the project and a 350 cc Bullet was donated. Work on the enclosure, which was to be called the Dreamliner, was carried out at Enfield's experimental shop. Once the design was finalised a prototype was made in fibreglass by Richard Woods, editor of British Plastic magazine. Back to back tests with the bike fitted with streamlining and without the streamlining at MIRA showed a 35% improvement in fuel consumption at 50 mph and increase in top speed of 7 mph. The FIM banned 'dustbin' fairings on racing motorcycles in 1957 on safety grounds due to instability in sidewinds. This caused the public to loose interest on streamlining on road bikes. Although this was the end for the Dreamliner, both Mitchenall Brothers, the makers of Avon Fairings, and Royal Enfield drew heavily on the Dreamliner design for their subsequent fairings.\nSportsflow\nAvon Speedflow\nThe full sports Avon Speedflow was offered as an accessory for the Continental GT, finished in red and white to match the bike's colour scheme. It was marketed as being a development of the fairing used on Royal Enfield's 250 racer.\nNotes\nReferences\n* }}\nExternal links"
