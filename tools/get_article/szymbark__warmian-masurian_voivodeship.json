It lies approximately  north-west of Iława and  west of the regional capital Olsztyn. The village is located on the northern shore of Szymbarskie Lake.\nThe castle\nThe construction of the castle began in 1301. It was built by the Teutonic Order as a summer residence of the Bishop of Pomesania. A Latin inscription above the main gate (Hec Porta Constructa Est Anno Domini MCCCLXXXVI Tempore Fratris Henrici De Skarlin Prepoziti) dates back to 1386 and mentions brother Henry of Skarlin as constructor. Sometimes he is described as the founder of the castle.}}\nIn April 1945, about three month after the conquest by the Soviet Union, and again in 1947 the castle was set on fire and completely destroyed. The ruins were used for the 1996 movie The Ogre by Volker Schlöndorff with John Malkovich in the title role.\nFile:Szymbark, zamek, pierzeja wschodnia.jpg|The south-east flank and main gate\nFile:Szymbark, zamek, pierzeja południowa.jpg|The south view\nFile:Szymbark5(js).jpg|The north-west tower\nFile:Szymbark4(js).jpg|The north-east tower\nSports\nThe local football club is LZS Zamek Szymbark.
