That's proven by the second side of the album, where Terry falls into the comfortable setting of duetting with Brownie McGhee. While these aren't among the duo's very best recordings, they are nonetheless enjoyable, suggesting that there's something to be said for the familiar\".\nTrack listing\nAll compositions by Sonny Terry\n# \"One Monkey Don't Stop the Show\" – 3:04\n# \"Changed the Lock On My Door\" – 3:30\n# \"Tater Pie\" – 2:32\n# \"She's So Sweet\" – 2:39\n# \"Diggin' My Potatoes\" \t3:32\n# \"Sonny's Coming\" – 2:50\n# \"Ida Mae\" – 3:10\n# \"Callin' My Mama\" – 2:33\n# \"Bad Luck\" – 4:10\n# \"Blues from the Bottom\" – 4:17\nPersonnel\n*Sonny Terry – harmonica, vocals\n*Lightnin' Hopkins (tracks 1–5), Brownie McGhee (tracks 6–10) – guitar\n*Leonard Gaskin – bass (tracks 1–5)\n*Belton Evans – drums (tracks 1–5)\n* Ozzie Cadena (tracks 1–5), Kenneth S.
