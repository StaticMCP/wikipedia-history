According to pre-Meiji scholars, his reign spanned the years from 1348 through 1351.\nGenealogy\nHis personal name was originally Masuhito (益仁), but was later changed to Okihito (興仁).\nHis father was Emperor Kōgon.  His predecessor, Emperor Kōmyō was his uncle, the younger brother of Emperor Kōgon.\n*Lady-in-waiting: Niwata (Minamoto) Motoko (庭田（源）資子; d.1394), Niwata Shigemoto's daughter\n**First son: Imperial Prince Fushimi-no-miya Yoshihito (1351–1416; 伏見宮栄仁親王) (Founder of Fushimi-no-miya house, collateral branch of the Imperial Family and included in the Succession to the Japanese throne until 1947)\n**Second son: Imperial Prince Priest Koshin (1358–1391; 興信法親王)\n*Court Lady: Anfuku-dono-Naishi (安福殿女御)\n*Consort: Sanjō-no-Tsubone (三条局)\n**First daughter: Princess Suiho (瑞宝女王)\n**Third son: Imperial Prince Priest Kojo (弘助法親王)\nEvents of Sukō's life\nSukō occupied the Chrysanthemum Throne from 18 November 1348 until 22 November 1351.\nIn 1348, he became Crown Prince.  In the same year, he became Northern Emperor upon the abdication of Emperor Kōmyō.  Although Emperor Kōgon ruled as a cloistered Emperor, the rivalry between Ashikaga Takauji and Ashikaga Tadayoshi began, and in 1351, Takauji returned to the allegiance of the Southern Court, forcing Emperor Sukō to abdicate.  This was intended to reunify the Imperial Line.\nHowever, the peace soon fell apart, and in April 1352, the Southern Dynasty evacuated Kyoto, abducting with them Retired (Northern) Emperors Emperor Kōgon and Emperor Kōmyō as well as Emperor Sukō and the Crown Prince Tadahito.  Because of this, Takauji made Emperor Kōgon's second son Imperial Prince Iyahito emperor (First Fushimi-no-miya).\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|1= 1.
