Hosted by Dave Aizer and Vivianne Collins, the show was Nickelodeon's take on Robot Wars, the popular and long-running robot-fighting game show. The show was canceled after one season, and subsequently aired on Nick GAS.\nThe series of six shows was filmed at Shepperton Studios in England in January 2002, at the same time as the second season of Robot Wars: Extreme Warriors, which aired on TNN in the U.S. (now Paramount Network). Both shows featured American teams and robots flown to England for the filming.\nTournaments\nSeven different tournaments took place over the six show series. Most of the tournaments aired within a single show, but a few spread out over multiple shows.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Tournament !! Description !! Robots !!
