At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 85, based on 22 reviews. Christopher Weingarten of Rolling Stone stated, \"Though hip-hop gets more melodic and vocally expressive every year, Pusha keeps his cadences steely and his bars hitting like haymakers, maintaining that ice-cold Nineties feel even when he’s taking on modern troubles.\" Corbin Reiff of The A.V. Club considered it a worthy prelude to King Push and praised the dark tone of the album, \"The mood is set right from the beginning on “Intro,” which opens with an array of synth sounds reminiscent of the score to Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange before slamming into a rhythm that's all boom and no bap. That foreboding tone is carried forward through the rest of the record.\" Erin Lowers of Exclaim! wrote that \"the weight of Darkest Before Dawn doesn't simply rest on Pusha T's lyrical weight (literal and figuratively), but also his ability to tap into the strengths of his producers, like Boi-1da's thunderous drums, Kanye West's soulful grandeur or Timbaland's unorthodox layering.\"\nTrack listing\n}}\n| writer1 =\n| length1 = 2:33\n| title2  = Untouchable\n| extra2  =\n| writer2 =\n| length2 = 3:12\n| title3  = M.F.T.R.\n| extra3  =\n*The-Dream\n}}\n| writer3 =\n| note3   = featuring The-Dream\n| length3 = 4:10\n| title4  = Crutches, Crosses, Caskets\n| extra4  =\n*Honorable C.N.O.T.E.\n*Yung Dev\n}}\n| writer4 =\n| length4 = 2:26\n| title5  = M.P.A.\n| extra5  =\n}}\n| writer5 =\n| note5   = featuring Kanye West, A$AP Rocky and The-Dream\n| length5 = 4:46\n| title6  = Got Em Covered\n| extra6  =\n| writer6 =\n| note6   = featuring Ab-Liva\n| length6 = 3:16\n| title7 = Keep Dealing\n| extra7 =\n| writer7 =\n| note7   = featuring Beanie Sigel\n| length7 = 4:11\n| title8 = Retribution\n| extra8 =\n| writer8 =\n| note8   = featuring Kehlani\n| length8 = 3:20\n| title9 = F.I.F.A.\n| extra9  = Q-Tip\n| writer9 =\n| length9 = 2:19\n| title10 = Sunshine\n| extra10 =\n| writer10 =\n| note10   = featuring Jill Scott\n| length10 = 3:13\n}}\nNotes\n* signifies an additional producer.\n*\"Intro\" features additional vocals by Lee Sanchez and G Koop.\nSample credits\n*\"Intro\" contains a sample from a reference track made for Kanye West's Yeezus album titled \"No More Games\" performed by Chantal Kreviazuk.\n*\"Untouchable\" contains a sample from \"Think B.I.G.\" performed by The Notorious B.I.G., written by Christopher Wallace.\n*\"M.P.A.\" contains a sample from \"Konklusjon\" performed by Good News, written by Finn Pedersen.\n*\"Got Em Covered\" contains an interpolation from \"Squeeze 1st\" performed and written by Shawn Carter and Ricardo Thomas.\n*\"F.I.F.A.\" contains a sample from \"Tout Au Pas\" performed by Jean-Philippe Goude.\n*\"Sunshine\" contains an interpolation of \"Workin' My Way\" performed by Alexander, written by Gianfranco Reverberi, Claudio Ghiglino and Susan Duncan-Smith.\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Weekly chart performance for King Push – Darkest Before Dawn: The Prelude\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2015)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Year-end chart performance for King Push – Darkest Before Dawn: The Prelude\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums (Billboard)\n| 48\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
