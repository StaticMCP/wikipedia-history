It was one of the five final primary elections ahead of the 2000 Democratic National Convention. The New Jersey primary was a semi-closed primary, with the state awarding 124 delegates, of which 105 were pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the results of the primary.\nPresumptive nominee and vice president Al Gore won nearly 95% of the vote and all delegates. Conspiracy theorist and political activist Lyndon LaRouche Jr. received roughly 5% of the vote.\nNew Jersey's former US Senator Bill Bradley had been an early competitor for the Democratic nomination but had dropped out by March 9 and did not appear on the ballot.\nProcedure\nNew Jersey held its primary elections on June 6, 2000, the same day as that of Alabama, Montana, New Mexico, and the South Dakota.\nVoting was expected to take place throughout the state from 6:00&nbsp;a.m. until 8:00&nbsp;p.m. In the semi-closed primary, candidates had to meet a threshold of 15 percent at the delegate district or statewide level in order to be considered viable. The 105 pledged delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention were allocated proportionally on the basis of the results of the primary. Of these, between 3 and 4 were allocated to each of the state's 20 \"delegate districts\", each consisting of two New Jersey Legislative Districts, and another 19 were allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates), in addition to 23 at-large delegates. In addition, 23 at-large National Convention delegates plus 14 Pledged PLEOs are to be allocated to presidential contenders based on the primary vote statewide. A mandatory 15 percent threshold was required in order for a presidential contender to be allocated National Convention delegates at either the delegate district or statewide level.\nThe Democratic state committee subsequently convened at the state convention to vote on the 23 at-large and 14 pledged PLEO delegates to send to the Democratic National Convention. The delegation also included 17 unpledged PLEO delegates: 8 members of the Democratic National Committee, 9 members of Congress (both senators, Robert Torricelli and Frank Lautenberg), and 7 representatives (Rob Andrews, Frank Pallone, Bill Pascrell, Steve Rothman, Donald Payne, Rush Holt Jr., and Bob Menendez), and 2 add-ons.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;float:none;padding:5px;\"\n! colspan=\"8\"| Pledged nationalconvention delegates\n|-\n!
