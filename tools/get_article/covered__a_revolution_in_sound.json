Records to commemorate its 50th anniversary as a record label. The album consists of some of the greatest hits from previous and current artists from the late 20th century, while the songs featured on the album themselves are performed by current artists that are signed to Warner Bros. Records. Warner's sister label Elektra Records had done something similar to this nearly 20 years before with an album titled ''Rubáiyát: Elektra's 40th Anniversary'', which featured then-current Elektra artists covering other songs originally released on Elektra or sister label Asylum Records.\nTrack listing\n# \"Just Got Paid\" (ZZ Top cover written by Frank Beard, Billy Gibbons, and Bill Ham) - Mastodon (3:35)\n# \"Her Eyes Are a Blue Million Miles\" (Captain Beefheart cover written by Don Van Vliet) - The Black Keys (3:46)\n# \"A Case of You\" (Joni Mitchell cover written by Joni Mitchell) - Michelle Branch (4:17)\n# \"Here Comes a Regular\" (The Replacements cover written by Paul Westerberg) - Against Me!
