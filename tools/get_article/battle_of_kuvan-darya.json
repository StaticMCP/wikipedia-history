However, this time, the Russian detachment was warmly welcomed. The renowned batyr Zhankozha, who led several clans of Kazakhs living along the Syr Darya, had long fought against the Kokand and Khiva forces. In 1843, he destroyed a Khivan stronghold on the Kuvan-Darya, and two years later, in 1845, he defeated a large Khivan detachment 3000 fighters that had arrived to restore the fortress.\nMeaning\nIn 1846, Zhankozha joined forces with Kenesary to fight against the Kokand forces. Together, they captured Sozak, but disagreements soon arose between them, leading the batyr to act independently. For Zhankozha, the primary enemy remained Khiva, while Kenesary was focused on seeking revenge against Kokand.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
