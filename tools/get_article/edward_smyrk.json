His best first-class bowling figures were 4 for 45 in his last match, for Wellington against Hawke's Bay in 1920.\nSmyrk served as a sapper with the Samoa Expeditionary Force in the Occupation of German Samoa in 1914. He returned to New Zealand in March 1915 and married Jessie Arnold in Napier on 7 April.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
