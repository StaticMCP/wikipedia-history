The inaugural awards were presented in 2012 and the ceremony hosted at the BBC Radio Theatre, Broadcasting House where it has remained ever since.\nThe awards were first announced with an invitation for entries on 24 October 2011, and the shortlisted nominees revealed on 10 January 2012. The inaugural ceremony took place on 29 January 2012 and proved hugely successful. Prior to this, there was no official awards ceremony to recognise audio dramas; the Sony Radio Academy Awards mainly encompassed radio shows and presenters while the Richard Imison Award (for best original script by a new writer) and Tinniswood Award (for best audio drama script of the year) were awarded separately. The Imison and Tinniswood Awards are now incorporated into the Audio Drama Awards, the former administered by the Society of Authors and the latter by both the Society of Authors and the Writers' Guild of Great Britain.\nNominations and judges\nAlthough nominations are dominated by the BBC's in-house arts-oriented stations, particularly BBC Radio 3 and BBC Radio 4, entries are open to all makers of audio drama world-wide.\nThe judges include personalities from both the radio, acting and theatre industry and the literary world. Notable judges have included British dramatist Nell Leyshon, American novelist Stephen Wright, performance historian Viv Gardner, English actor Robert Bathurst, long-time producer and Director-General of the BBC Lord Hall, comedian Alexei Sayle, actress Imogen Stubbs and Royal Shakespeare Company associate director Rupert Goold.\nWinners\n2024\nThe ceremony took place on 24 March 2024 at salty springs featuring agent jonsey and covered audio dramas broadcast between 1 October 2022 and 31 October 2023 or first uploaded / published / released for free listening online during the same period.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+13th annual awards – Host: Meera Syal\n! style=\"width:170px\" |Award\n! style=\"width:300px\" |Winner\n! style=\"width:300px\" |Other finalists\n|-\n|Lifetime Achievement\n|Graeme Garden\n| –\n|-\n|Outstanding Contribution\n|Oliver Emanuel\n|\n|-\n| Best Actor || Hiran Abeysekera (Dear Harry Kane)Director: Sally Avens (BBC Audio Drama London)||\n* Commendation: Lorn Macdonald (Confessions of a Justified Sinner)Director: Kirsty Williams (BBC Scotland)\n* Tim McInerny (Benny & Hitch)Director: Tracey Neale (BBC Audio Drama London)\n|-\n| Best Actress || Rosamund Pike (People Who Knew Me)Director: Daniella Isaacs (Merman)||\n* Gabrielle Brooks (Bess Loves Porgy)Director: Michael Buffong (feral inc)\n* Maxine Peake (The Women of Troy)Director: Nadia Molinari (BBC Audio Drama North)\n|-\n| Best Supporting Performance ||\nMark Heap (Kafka’s Dick)Directors: Polly Thomas and Dermot Daly (Naked Productions)\n|\n* Sacha Dhawan (Anna Karenina)Director: Nadia Molinari (BBC Audio Drama North)\n|-\n|The Marc Beeby Award for Best Debut Performance\n|Rosalind Eleazar (Hindsight )Director: Gaynor Macfarlane (BBC Scotland)\n|\n* Commendation: Jadie Rose Hobson (Exposure)Director: Anne Isger (BBC Audio Drama London)\n* Commendation: Dan Parr (The Test Batter Can’t Breathe)Director: Tracey Neale (BBC Audio Drama London)\n|-\n| Best Audio Drama(Single drama) || Dear Harry Kane by James FritzProducer: Sally Avens (BBC Audio Drama London)||\n*Benny and Hitch by Andrew McCaldonProducers: Neil Varley and Tracey Neale (BBC Audio Drama London)\n* Eat and Run by Paolo ChiantaProducer: Lorna Newman (BBC Audio Drama North)\n|-\n| Best Audio Drama(Series or Serial) || Trust by Jonathan HallProducer: Gary Brown (BBC Audio Drama North)||\n* Commendation: There’s Something I Need to Tell You by John Scott Dryden and Misha KawnelProducer: Emma Hearn (Goldhawk Productions)\n* Flirties by Jess HamiltonProducer: Jess Hamilton (Audiocraft)\n|-\n| Best Audio Drama(Adaptation) || Bess Loves Porgy by Edwin DuBose Heyward adapted by Roy WilliamsProducer: Gill Parry ((feral inc)||\n* Commendation: If on a Winter’s Night a Traveller by Italo Calvino, adapted by Tim Crouch and Toby JonesProducer: Nadia Molinari (BBC Audio Drama North)\n* Commendation: Beowulf Retold based on the version by Seamus HeaneyProducer: Pauline Harris (BBC Audio Drama London)\n|-\n| Best Use of Sound in an Audio Drama || Hamlet Noir by David Chilton, Lucinda Mason Brown, Weronika AndersenProducers: Charlotte Melén, Carl Prekopp and Saskia Black (Almost Tangible)||\n* The Dark is Rising by Gareth FryProducers: Catherine Bailey and Tim Bell (Catherine Bailey Productions and Complicité)\n* The Women of Troy by Sharon HughesProducers: Nadia Molinari (BBC Audio Drama North)\n|-\n| Best Stand-up Comedy|| Are You a Boy or a Girl?
