One mile and a half (2.4&nbsp;km) north-east-by-east from the city centre; a portion was incorporated with the municipal borough in 1874. The remainder formed part of Peterborough Rural District from 1894 until 1926 when the city's boundaries were extended to include the civil parish of Peterborough Without.\nHistory\nSt. Michael's church school was erected in the village in 1873 and had a chancel containing a stained-glass window and a font; divine service was held by the clergy of St. Mary's, Peterborough. The population, including Eastfield, in 1891 was 388.\nOxney Grange, a Grade II listed building dating to the 12th century, was destroyed by fire in 2003.

The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks.
