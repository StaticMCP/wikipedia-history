Duguay-Trouin and Forbin were two of the most successful French naval commanders and they caused much damage to the British merchant fleet.\nBattle\nOn 20 October 1707 a large merchant fleet consisting of 80 to 130 British merchantmen left Plymouth for Portugal with supplies for the war in Spain. The fleet was escorted by a squadron of five ships of the line under Commodore Richard Edwards. The next day near Lizard Point they were spotted by 2 French squadrons of 6 ships each. Technically Forbin was the senior French officer, but Duguay-Trouin was the more aggressive, and his ships led the attack and suffered most of the damage, after Forbin had discovered the British convoy.\nThis battle was almost a complete victory for the French; the 80-gun Cumberland and the 50-guns Chester and Ruby were taken, but Royal Oak escaped into Kinsale with a few merchantmen. The 80-gun Devonshire defended herself for several hours against seven French ships until she caught fire and blew up, only three men escaping out of 500.\nThere is no unanimity on the number of merchantmen captured. French sources speak of 60 ships out of 80, some British sources speak of none at all. The fact that René Duguay-Trouin and Claude de Forbin quarrelled for many years about which of the two squadrons had the biggest role in the victory, points to a considerable number of ships captured. Probably the truth is somewhere in between: Polak in \"Bibliographie maritime française\" speaks of 15 merchantmen captured.\nOrder of battle\nBritain (Edwards)\nexploding during the battle]]\n, 1827)]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"width=40%\n|-\n!style=|Ship\n!style=|Guns\n!style=|Commander\n!style=|Notes\n|-\n|Cumberland\n|80\n|Commodore Richard Edwards\n|Surrendered to Lys\n|-\n|Devonshire\n|80\n|Captain John Watkins\n|Exploded, three survivors\n|-\n|Royal Oak\n|76\n|Captain Baron Wylde\n|Escaped to Kinsale\n|-\n|Chester\n|50\n|Captain John Balchen\n|Surrendered to Jason\n|-\n|Ruby\n|50\n|Captain the Hon.
