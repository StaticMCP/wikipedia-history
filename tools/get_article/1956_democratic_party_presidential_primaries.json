Former Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson was selected as the nominee through a series of primary elections and caucuses culminating in the 1956 Democratic National Convention held from August 13 to August 17, 1956, in Chicago, Illinois. This was the party's second consecutive nomination of Stevenson.\nCandidates\nMajor candidates\nThese candidates participated in multiple state delegate election contests or were included in multiple major national polls.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Candidate\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Most recent position\n!Home state\n! data-sort-type=\"date\" |Campaign\n|-\n! data-sort-value=\"Stevenson\" scope=\"row\" |\nAdlai Stevenson II\n| style=\"background:#1E90FF;\" |\n|Democratic nominee for President(1952)Former Governor of Illinois(1949–53)\n|\n| data-sort-value=\"03-04-2016\" |(Campaign)\n|-\n! data-sort-value=\"Kefauver\" scope=\"row\" |\nEstes Kefauver\n| style=\"background:#ffd12b;\" |\n|U.S. Senator from Tennessee(1949–63)U.S. Representative from Tennessee(1939–49)\n|\n|Withdrew: June 1956(Campaign)\n|-\n! data-sort-value=\"Harriman\" scope=\"row\" |\nW.

Initially, he again won some Democratic Party presidential primaries.\nIn the March 13, 1956 New Hampshire presidential primary, Kefauver defeated Stevenson, his only formidable opponent for the nomination, by a margin of 21,701 to 3,806.\nA week later, Kefauver defeated Stevenson in the March 20, 1956 Minnesota presidential primary, winning 245,885 votes compared to Stevenson's 186,723 votes. Kefauver was also victorious in the Wisconsin presidential primary. Stevenson picked up his native Illinois in a landslide. By April 1956, \"it appeared that Kefauver was on his way to a primary sweep matching the spectacular performance in 1952.\"\nFlorida primary\nOne of the first televised United States presidential debates was held as an hour long one-on-one debate between the party's top-two contenders, Kefauver and Stevenson. The debate was held in Miami, Florida ahead of the state's primary.\nRussell Baker of The New York Times  wrote that the two contenders took near-identical stances on most of the issues discussed in the debate.\nCalifornia primary\nThe June California primary proved decisive for the nomination, delivering Stevenson a major victory and leading to the suspension of Kefauver's campaign for the nomination.\nPolling\nNational polling\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;\"\n!Poll source\n! style=\"width:90px;\" |Publication\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|Gallup\n|Aug. 1953\n|–\n|–\n|17%\n|–\n| | 53%\n|1%\n|11%\n|-\n|Gallup\n|Aug. 1954\n|–\n|–\n|22%\n|–\n| | 57%\n|–\n|–\n|-\n|Gallup\n|Nov. 1954\n|4%\n|–\n|16%\n|2%\n| | 58%\n|–\n|–\n|-\n|Gallup\n|Mar. 1955\n|14%\n|–\n| | 48%\n|2%\n|–\n|5%\n|1%\n|-\n|Gallup\n|Apr. 1955\n|17%\n|–\n| | 37%\n|4%\n|–\n|3%\n|1%\n|-\n|Gallup\n|Aug. 1955\n|6%\n|1%\n|16%\n|–\n| | 55%\n|–\n|1%\n|-\n|Gallup\n|Oct. 1955\n|8%\n|–\n|16%\n|2%\n| | 51%\n|2%\n|–\n|-\n|Gallup\n|Nov. 1955\n|10%\n|1%\n|11%\n|1%\n| | 48%\n|1%\n|1%\n|-\n|Gallup\n|Nov. 1955\n|8%\n|–\n|12%\n|–\n| | 38%\n|–\n|–\n|-\n|Gallup\n|Dec. 1955\n|8%\n|–\n|17%\n|3%\n| | 51%\n|–\n|–\n|-\n|Gallup\n|Jan. 1956\n|8%\n|3%\n|17%\n|3%\n| | 49%\n|–\n|–\n|-\n|Gallup\n|Feb. 1956\n|8%\n|2%\n|18%\n|2%\n| | 51%\n|1%\n|–\n|-\n|Gallup\n|Apr. 1956\n|6%\n|3%\n|33%\n|2%\n| | 39%\n|2%\n|–\n|-\n|Gallup\n|Apr. 1956\n|6%\n|4%\n|29%\n|3%\n| | 41%\n|2%\n|–\n|-\n|Gallup\n|June 1956\n|8%\n|4%\n|26%\n|3%\n| | 42%\n|3%\n|–\n|-\n|Gallup\n|June 1956\n|12%\n|4%\n|16%\n|3%\n| | 45%\n|4%\n|–\n|}\nSee also\n*1956 Republican Party presidential primaries\n*1956 New Jersey Democratic presidential primary\nReferences"
