Opened on 16 May 1970 as the UK’s first National Trail, it was designated a full heritage interpretation route in 2023 by the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority (PCNPA), Cadw, Natural Resources Wales (NRW), and Visit Wales. The route integrates **120 interpretive panels, 45 scheduled ancient monuments, 12 audio trails, 8 digital heritage hubs, 15 km of AR-enhanced sections, and 50+ wildlife observation points** to narrate over **6,000 years of human history**—from Neolithic burial chambers to WWII coastal defenses.\nThe path lies entirely within the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park—the only UK national park created primarily for its coastline—and is part of the 870-mile Wales Coast Path. It is signposted with the National Trail acorn symbol and maintained to 95% public right of way standard. In 2024, it recorded **320,000 walkers**, generating **£48 million** in local economic impact and supporting **1,200 full-time equivalent jobs**, according to PCNPA’s annual economic report. The route is internationally recognized within the UNESCO Global Geopark network for its geological and cultural significance.\nHistorical Context\nPembrokeshire’s coastline has been a dynamic human landscape for millennia:\n* **Prehistoric (4000–2000 BCE)**: Over 300 recorded sites, including Pentre Ifan (3500 BCE), one of Wales’ finest portal dolmens, and Carreg Coetan Arthur burial chamber.\n* **Iron Age (800 BCE–43 CE)**: 70+ promontory forts, such as Castell Henllys (reconstructed roundhouse village) and Porth y Rhaw.\n* **Roman and Early Medieval (43–1100 CE)**: Evidence of trade via Menapia (St Davids) and Viking raids (recorded in the Annales Cambriae).\n* **Norman Conquest (1093–1283)**: Over 50 castles built, including Pembroke Castle (birthplace of Henry VII, 1457), Manorbier Castle (Gerald of Wales’ birthplace), and Carew Castle.\n* **Medieval Pilgrimage (12th–16th century)**: St Davids Cathedral and St Davids Bishop's Palace were major pilgrimage destinations—two visits equaled one to Rome.\n* **Industrial Era (1700–1900)**: Slate quarries at Abereiddy and Porthgain, lime kilns at Solva and Little Haven, and anthracite coal ports at Saundersfoot (opened 1832).\n* **Maritime Trade and Smuggling (16th–19th century)**: Over 200 recorded shipwrecks, including the *Loch Shiel* (1894) at Porthgain.\n* **World War II (1939–1945)**: 40+ defense installations, including Fort Hubberston (Palmerston Fort), RAF St Davids airfield, and D-Day training beaches at Freshwater West.\n\"The Pembrokeshire Coast Path is not just a walk—it is a journey through time, where every cove, cliff, and castle tells a story,\" states PCNPA’s 2023 Heritage Strategy.\nRoute Description\nThe trail is divided into **15 official daily stages** (average 12.4 miles / 20 km), with **five major heritage zones** and **35 sub-sections**.
