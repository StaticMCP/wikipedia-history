As of August 2021 there were 427 species on the official list. Of them, 100 are classed as accidental and six were introduced to North America. One species whose record is under review by the DBRC is not included.\nOnly birds that have occurred as wild individuals in Delaware are listed; this includes introduced species which have established self-sustaining populations in the wild. Birds thought to have occurred only as escapes from captivity are not included.\nThis list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 62nd Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them.\nThe following tags have been used to annotate some species:\n*(A) Accidental - occur seldom and unpredictably and require documentation for reports to be accepted by the DBRC to enter the official record\n*(I) Introduced - a species established by direct or indirect human intervention\nDucks, geese, and waterfowl\nOrder: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae\nThe family Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.
