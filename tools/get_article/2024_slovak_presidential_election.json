Incumbent president Zuzana Čaputová announced in June 2023 that she would not run for a second term.\nIn the first round held on 23 March, Ivan Korčok led with 43% of the votes followed by Peter Pellegrini with 37%. As no candidate received a majority, a runoff was scheduled between the two on 6 April. However, in the second round, Pellegrini defeated Korčok with 53% of the vote. He was sworn in as president on 15 June.Turnout was the highest in both rounds since the 1999 Slovak Presidential election, and the closest in history of direct presidential elections in Slovakia.\nThe election was widely regarded as a win for Slovakia's prime minister Robert Fico who saw his ally elected as President.\nElectoral system\nThe President of Slovakia is elected using the two-round system; if no candidate gains a majority in the first round, a runoff will be held between the top-two candidates.\nCandidates\nEligibility\nSlovak citizens not sentenced for an intentional crime aged 40 or more are eligible to run for the office of president.\nEach candidacy has to be supported by either 15 Members of the National Council of Slovakia or signatures of 15,000 citizens of Slovakia to be admissible.

Meanwhile, Ivan Korčok has been supportive of the West and Ukrainian resistance against Russia. During the campaign, Pellegrini accused Korčok of being a warmonger who wants to send troops to Ukraine, which Korčok denied. Pellegrini also said that he was running for president \"to rescue the government of [Prime Minister] Robert Fico.\" Fico also openly supported Pellegrini, calling him a “a moderate candidate who recognises the value of peace\" and described Korčok as supporting \"everything the West tells him without hesitation\". Pellegrini and Fico's accusations were made despite the office of the president not having constitutional powers to deploy military forces abroad.\nKorčok ran on the notion of \"not letting Robert Fico take everything\"\nFollowing the results of the first round, Korčok said that he acknowledged a \"need to reach out more to voters who supported the government parties,” adding that it was also clear that “they’re not satisfied with how this government is ruling, where it’s taking Slovakia.” Pellegrini congratulated Korčok for his first place and pledged to hold “several duels, as it should be” with Korčok before the second round, and “not to succumb” to an aggressive campaign style, having only engaged once in a debate prior to the first round of voting. He also noted that a majority of voters voted for nationalist candidates and not \"a liberal, progressive\" candidate, and predicted the second round of voting to be a tight race.\nPresident Čaputová denounced war rhetoric used during the campaigning for the second round and defended both Pellegrini and Korčok from allegations that they were willing to deploy soldiers in Ukraine.\nEndorsements\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | Candidate\n! colspan=\"2\" | Endorsement\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: ;\" |\n| Andrej Danko\n| style=\"background-color: ;\" |\n| Peter Pellegrini\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: ;\" |\n| Patrik Dubovský\n| style=\"background-color: ;\" |\n| Ivan Korčok\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: ;\" |\n| Krisztián Forró\n| style=\"background-color: ;\" |\n| Peter Pellegrini\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: ;\" |\n| Štefan Harabin\n| style=\"background-color: #FFFFFF;\" |\n| colspan=\"2\" | No endorsement\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: ;\" |\n| Marian Kotleba\n| style=\"background-color: #FFFFFF;\" |\n| colspan=\"2\" | No endorsement\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: ;\" |\n| Ján Kubiš\n| style=\"background-color: ;\" |\n| Peter Pellegrini\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: ;\" |\n| Igor Matovič\n| style=\"background-color: ;\" |\n| Ivan Korčok\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: ;\" |\n| Milan Náhlik\n| style=\"background-color: ;\" |\n| Peter Pellegrinii\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: #AA1801;\" |\n| Róbert Švec\n| style=\"background-color: #FFFFFF;\" |\n| colspan=\"2\" | No endorsement\n|}\nOpinion polls\nFirst round\nSecond round\nResults\nIn the second round, Pellegrini carried 61 out of 79 districts.\n|party9=Independent|votes9=3111\n|cand10=Andrej Danko|party10=Slovak National Party|votes10=1905\n|cand11=Róbert Švec|party11=|votes11=1876|color11=#AA1801\n|invalid=10563|invalid2=17233\n|electorate=4364071|electorate2=4368697\n|source=[https://www.volbysr.sk/en/vysledky_hlasovania_kolo1.html First Round], [https://www.volbysr.sk/en/vysledky_hlasovania_kolo2.html Second Round]\n}}\nAftermath\nFollowing the results, Pellegrini pledged to be \"a president of all Slovak citizens\" and \"be always by the side of Slovakia.\" Korčok conceded defeat and congratulated Pellegrini, while acknowledging that he was \"disappointed\" by the electoral result.\nPellegrini's victory is seen by analysts to be a gain for the government of Prime Minister Robert Fico, with Pellegrini having been acquiescent in Fico's efforts to overhaul the justice system, which had launched investigations into members of Fico's SMER party and place public broadcasting under state control, in addition to sharing his views on Ukraine and relations with Russia.\nNotes\nReferences"
