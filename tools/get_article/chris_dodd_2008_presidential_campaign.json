Dodd, the senior senator from Connecticut, sought the nomination of the Democratic Party for president of the United States. Centering his campaign in the states of Iowa and New Hampshire, he centred his campaign on the theme of change. Dodd's performance in the opinion polls varied, but in the financial sphere, he had secured some notable and influential endorsements who were the ones largely funding his campaign.\nDodd tried to follow in the pattern of New Englanders who entered the race for the Democratic nomination and won, including John Kerry, Michael Dukakis, and John F. Kennedy. If elected, Dodd would have become the second Roman Catholic president (after Kennedy) and the second Connecticut-born president (after George W. Bush). He would have been the first senator to win the presidency while in office since Kennedy was elected in 1960 (that honor ultimately went to Barack Obama). After his withdrawal from the race, Dodd went on to endorse the eventual winner Barack Obama, and retired from the Senate in 2011.\nBackground\nDuring his years in the House and Senate, Dodd built a long record of political positions on important issues to the nation. He was in favor of ending the Iraq War and redeploying American soldiers from the nation elsewhere. He repeatedly voted against further funding of the war.\nTo combat global warming, he proposed a carbon tax to reduce carbon emissions, and declared that the United States \"must take a 'strategic pause'\" before signing any new free trade agreement.\nDomestically, Dodd proposed mandatory community service for all high school students, and fought to improve child care and health care, and worked to stop predatory lending by credit card companies. He also introduced legislation to enact a Federal Shield law and worked to defeat legislation permitting warrantless surveillance.\nDodd had told the Associated Press in April 2006 that he was considering running, and by May 22 he had met with key backers, including congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, and had assembled a team to prepare a potential 2008 campaign. In June 2006, he held his first major fundraiser, stunning Beltway commentators by raising over $1 million in one night. Dodd attended a Florida Democratic convention in July 2006 to garner further support. He hired former John Kerry campaign manager Jim Jordan in December of that year. Two months later, Dodd told the head of the New Hampshire Democratic Party at the Rainbow Cafe that he was not \"going to do the exploratory thing\" but instead \"plunge right in\" to the race.\nOn the campaign trail\nJanuary 2007\n]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He cited his qualifications of experience and background as the strengths needed to lead the nation as president. A critic of the Iraq War, Dodd stated that his candidacy \"...isn't just [about] Iraq -- there are problems here at home that are huge.\" He decided not to file with the FEC under an exploratory committee but instead filed as a full-fledged candidate. He began campaigning in the state of South Carolina on January 15, 2007, and hit the trails to New Hampshire on January 20.\nFebruary 2007\non February 15, 2007]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

When asked by the Associated Press on the campaign trail if his campaigning really made a difference in changing public perceptions, he replied, \"There is enough time yet to change this [public perceptions], because there are places like Iowa and New Hampshire that give candidates like myself a chance to be heard.\" Dodd's strategy was to speak to voters in restaurants, homes, and small-town diners, although political analysts wondered whether such methods were out-of-date. But he maintained that \"chatting in a living room face to face is still a very important feature of campaigning here. I don't think you can come in here and do sort of a wholesale political operation from  with a pit stop here and there and a media campaign behind you.\" At the end of February, Dodd differentiated himself from his Democratic counterparts by stating his support for the Bush administration's willingness to hold joint talks with Iran and Syria and by stating that as president he would avoid talking with Iran as long as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad remained as president. On the trail, he referred to Ahmadinejad as a \"thug\".\nMarch 2007\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Date\n! Location(s)\n!

Liberal bloggers praised the behind the scenes look at the campaign as innovative and creative. A posting on the Comedy Central show's blog read: \"This was a fascinating look behind the scenes of the show even for us, and a surprisingly cool thing for a Presidential candidate to do. Senator Dodd, we salute both your commitment to fiscal responsibility and your web-savvy.\" After the visit Dodd campaigned in New Hampshire and Nevada finishing the month at a forums in Las Vegas and Washington, D.C. At the Las Vegas Forum, he discussed health care with the other Democratic candidates and voiced his support for a system of Universal Health Care. As March came to a close the campaign revealed their fundraising total for the First Quarter. Dodd raised $4,043,757 in this quarter, spend $1,313,239 and had $7,482,467 cash on hand.\nApril 2007\nhighlight the importance of the first primary state]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Date\n!

While on the trail Dodd participated in a virtual town hall sponsored by the website MoveOn.org. When he was asked the question \"...what is the best and fastest way to get out of Iraq?\" he answered, \"We ought to start redeploying this evening...We ought to begin immediately. I would not wait any longer.\" Continuing on the trail, Dodd sponsored what was called by The Washington Post, the \"most radical plan\" to combat global warming. It included a corporate carbon tax to be levied on corporations to reduce carbon emissions. The plan is part of a larger energy platform of the campaign.\nOn April 26, Dodd participated in the first of many Democratic presidential debates. His campaign has been critical of how little time their candidate has been allotted to speak at the debates, and its website introduced a \"Talk Clock\" demonstrating this disparity.\nAt the end of the month, Dodd set his sights on the state with the most convention votes, California by attending events in Sacramento and San Diego.\nMay 2007\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

On May 15 the campaign released its first ad, which detailed his plan for ending the war in Iraq. In the ad, Dodd also criticized his fellow Democratic candidates by stating, \"We can't simply wait for a new president. We should have the conviction to stand up to this one,\" In Washington, Dodd was exposed to debate on the Iraq War Spending Bill and new videos from al-Qaeda's second in command Ayman al-Zawahiri. Back on the campaign trail he talked about how he would deal with foreign issues particularly in regards to the situation in Iraq, \"I'm not going to let my foreign policy be decided by Mr. al-Zawahiri. Obviously, he's playing his game here. He'd probably like to see us stay down there, bogged down, at the costs we're increasing here, the loss of lives, not to mention the isolation of the United States.\" When Presidential candidate John Edwards released an ad criticizing Congress' failure to end the Iraq War, Dodd took it personal and shot back at Edwards stating, \"\"With all due respect, we could have used John's vote here in the Senate on these issues here.\" He concluded the May campaign by attending House parties in three cities in New Hampshire. .\nJune 2007\nin June 2007]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

During the debate he pointed out a woman in the audience whose husband was fighting in the War on Terrorism, he thanked her for the sacrifice and stated the importance of standing up for America's security while on the campaign trail, \"No one is going to be elected president who is not going to have as their primary responsibility to keep us safe and secure.\" After the debate Dodd went back to the trails, but while campaigning he found a new tool to help spread his message. The campaign encouraged voters to confront politicians with video cameras and ask them to talk about Iraq and to support the \"Dodd Amendment\" which would have required American troops to start redeployment in 30 days. The final step was for the voters to post the interactions on YouTube. The Dodd campaign has used the internet more frequently than other campaigns, often airing staff meetings via the web. The campaign released a new advertisement on June 16 entitled \"Amazing Grace\" which focused on Dodd's time in the Peace Corps. As June came to a close Dodd made his final appearance of the month at a forum in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, the first time he visited the state which moved up its primary dates, causing a controversy with the DNC. On June 30 the campaign revealed the fundraising totals for the second quarter, Dodd raised $3,250,730, spent $4,384,580 and had a total of $6,378,271 cash on hand.\nJuly 2007\nin the Senate in July 2007]]\njoined Dodd on the campaign trail in July 2007]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The campaign uses the network MyLifeBrand which allows Dodd supporters to be linked to other users from other social networking websites. The goal was to bring supporters together and attract new supporters.\nOn July 6 singer Paul Simon joined Dodd on the campaign trail in Iowa as Dodd embarked on a five-day \"River to River\" tour in a big blue bus with the name \"Dodd\" etched on the side. Dodd simultaneously continued his campaign on the web airing live staff meetings and a live chatroom on July 23. The campaign launched a show called D-TV which the Washington Post labeled as the \"political Truman Show\". On July 23, he participated in the YouTube debate broadcast on CNN. Dodd was fielded many questions during the debate including the very first. He received questions ranging from discussion about his hair to Iraq. When asked about his position on gay marriage, he stated:\nWhen asked to comment about the genocide in Darfur and the moral leadership of the United States, Dodd answered that the situation in \"Iraq is related to Darfur, Anderson, here. It's because we're bogged down there at $10 billion a month, we've lost our moral leadership in the world. No one listens to us when it comes to foreign policy. That has to change in this country. That's the difference here.\"\nJuly campaigning wrapped up in Iowa with visits to seven cities in two days from July 27–28.\nAugust 2007\nwho joined him on the trail in August 2007]]\ngot into an argument over a possible invasion of Pakistan]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It started off with the candidate criticizing the merger of Murdoch-WSJ starting a debate over media ethics. Dodd stated on August 1, \"I am deeply troubled by the incredible amount of consolidation occurring across the American media landscape.\" On August 7 during a debate before the AFL–CIO in Chicago Dodd touted his experience in fighting for the rights of labor unions by stating, \"I'm proud to say for 26 years on every major issue that labor's been involved in I've stood with you. I've stood with labor in banning outsourcing of jobs, of offset contracts, of situs picketing, on plant closing legislation.\" He also got into an argument with fellow Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) on Obama's recent comments about escalating the Afghanistan Conflict into Pakistan:\nDODD:I think it's highly responsible—or irresponsible for people who are running for the presidency and seek that office to suggest we may be willing unilaterally to invade a nation here who we're trying to get to be more cooperative with us in Afghanistan and elsewhere.\nOBAMA: Well, look, I find it amusing that those who helped to authorize and engineer the biggest foreign policy disaster in our generation are now criticizing me for making sure that we are on the right battlefield and not the wrong battlefield in the war against terrorism. (Cheers, applause.)\nDodd continued campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire visiting up to four different cities in one day. Political commentator Bill O'Reilly slammed Dodd after he appeared on ''The O'Reilly Factor'' in August, characterizing him as a kool-aid drinker and blind follower of the far left. O'Reilly chastised Dodd and branded him a traitor for his perceived betrayal of fellow Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman during the 2006 Senatorial election.\nOn August 20 he attended a debate that aired on ABC and was moderated by George Stephanopoulos. He commented on the need for a president that can bring people from both parties together, \"it's about getting this job done. We don't elect a king or a queen or a dictator in November, we elect a president. The margins are thin. No one political party is going to write all of this. It takes leadership that knows how to bring people together.\" As the month wound down for the campaign and as Dodd continued on the trail, the month of September loomed in the horizon as did an upcoming debate in Washington on the primary focus of the campaign, the Iraq War. Accompanying Dodd on the trail was the International Association of Fire Fighters, which handed him their endorsement on August 29.\nSeptember 2007\nin September 2007 during his assessment of the situation in Iraq]]\nduring Labor Day 2007]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

However this would later be overshadowed by events that would occur in Washington on September 11. During the testimony of General David Petraeus, he lashed out against the surge policy stating:\nAt the same time the website MoveOn.org released an ad that slammed General Petraeus, calling him a traitor. Dodd voted against a Congressional act to denounce the ad on September 21.\nReturning to the campaign trail, Dodd made stops in Iowa where he started what would be a later October trend by attacking the frontrunner Hillary Clinton. He attacked her record on health care stating, \"It should be far more than just a parable of personal growth and maturation. This was about an issue that was critically important to the country. It was a major effort that failed. There were a lot of reasons that it failed, not the least of which it was mismanaged terribly at the time.\"\nIn addition to the campaigning in Iowa, attended fundraisers in his home state of Connecticut, visited New Hampshire and returned to Iowa all in the timespan of 10 days. At the end of September as the third quarter came to a close, the campaign revealed that it had raised only $1,467,093, spent $4,025,458, leaving $3,874,874 cash on hand.\nOctober 2007\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

On the trail, the campaign received little media attention despite a surge in appearances. As the month neared its final days an unexpected apex emerged for the campaign. During an October 30 MSNBC debate, he went after the frontrunner Hillary Clinton, slamming her for her support of Governor of New York Eliot Spitzer's plan to give driver's licenses to illegal immigrants:\nSEN. CLINTON: I just want to add, I did not say that it should be done, but I certainly recognize why Governor Spitzer is trying to do it. And we have failed --\nSEN. DODD: Wait a minute. No, no, no. You said yes, you thought it made sense to do it.\nSEN. CLINTON: No, I didn't, Chris. But the point is, what are we going to do with all these illegal immigrants who are (driving ?) -- (inaudible)?\nSEN. DODD: Well, that's a legitimate issue. But driver's license goes too far, in my view.\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, you may say that, but what is the identification if somebody runs into you today who is an undocumented worker --\nSEN. DODD: There's ways of dealing with that.\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, but --\nSEN. DODD: This is a privilege, not a right.\nSEN. CLINTON: Well, what Governor Spitzer has agreed to do is to have three different licenses; one that provides identification for actually going onto airplanes and other kinds of security issues, another which is an ordinary driver's license, and then a special card that identifies the people who would be on the road.\nSEN. DODD: That's a bureaucratic nightmare.\nLater in the debate Dodd articulated his support for the decriminalization of marijuana citing the high populations of American prisons. Many of the participants expressed their disagreement with him on this issue. The debate was the last campaign stop for Dodd in October who went into November with energy and momentum from the multiple exchanges.\nNovember 2007\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Date\n!

In Nationwide polls almost always polled at or around 1%. A November 7, 2007, Gallup poll placed him in last place, behind both Joe Biden and Dennis Kucinich, as well as the three front runners. At the state level, Dodd has also not done so well. In a November 18, 2007, Iowa poll conducted by ABC news, he registered with 1% the same number from a similar poll done by ABC news on July 31, 2007. In New Hampshire, a poll conducted by CNN placed Dodd at 1% constant from a September poll but up from polls in June and July. However, on the straw poll level, Dodd was able to gain a victory during an event in South Carolina on March 5, 2007. He won the York County straw poll by receiving 28% of the 100 votes cast. Barack Obama came in second with 24%. Hillary Clinton got 18% and John Edwards received 11%. The victory came two days after Dodd visited the county which probably secured him the win.\nA November 2007 poll of Connecticut voters conducted by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute determined that Dodd was losing in the state to Hillary Clinton. Of the 1,029 voters surveyed, 70% wanted Dodd to drop out of the presidential race, and 55% said he was spending too much time on the campaign trail. In response, Dodd's national press secretary, Colleen Flanagan, said \"Connecticut voters are being asked to look at Senator Dodd in a different light than in past years\" adding that once voters become more focused on the presidential race, they will look to Dodd as \"a candidate who has a track record of proven results.\"\nHead to head\nJanuary 15–16, 2007 Rasmussen Reports\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
