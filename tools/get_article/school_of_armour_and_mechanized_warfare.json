However, the Pakistan Army officers later renamed the school as The Armoured Corps School (19561969) when its scope of teachings were expanded; but later fixated to its permanent structure as The School of Armour (19691993). Since 1993 with new curriculum and syllabus, the school is known from its current name.\nThe Pakistan Army's School of Armour and Mechanized Warfare has been attended and earned qualifications by the foreign soldiers from 29 countries including from the armies of Bangladesh, Brunei, China, Egypt, Gambia, Ghana, Iraq, Indonesia, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Malaysia, Myanmar, Libya, Maldives, Nigeria, Nepal, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Syria, Turkey, Tanzania, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, the UAE, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.\nReferences"
