Gino Vannelli and Chilliwack provided videotaped performances.\nPierre Trudeau attended the ceremonies, the first time a Canadian Prime Minister did so. He introduced Hank Snow into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame.\nCummings and Dan Hill led nominations with four each.  In an unusual move, Hill was nominated in the \"Composer of the Year\" category for \"Sometimes When We Touch\" for the second time as it had sold more than 75,000 copies after the first award at the 1978 Juno ceremony.\nThis was the first year when Gordon Lightfoot failed to pick up an award, and Anne Murray was not present to claim her two awards.  The CBC television broadcast was seen by an estimated 1,827,000 viewers which was down from the year before.\nNominees and winners\nFemale Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Anne Murray\nOther nominees:\n*Carroll Baker\n*Lisa Dal Bello\n*Patsy Gallant\n*Joni Mitchell\nMale Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Gino Vannelli\nOther nominees:\n*Burton Cummings\n*Dan Hill\n*Gordon Lightfoot\n*Neil Young\nMost Promising Female Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Claudja Barry\nOther nominees:\n*Ronney Abramson\n*Carolyne Bernier\n*Roxanne Goldade\n*Denise McCann\nMost Promising Male Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Nick Gilder\nOther nominees:\n*Rick James\n*Marc Jordan\n*Martin Stevens\n*Pat Travers\nGroup of the Year\nWinner: Rush\nOther nominees:\n*Chilliwack\n*Prism\n*Triumph\n*Trooper\nMost Promising Group of the Year\nWinner: Doucette\nOther nominees:\n*Max Webster\n*Streetheart\n*Teaze\n*Zon\nComposer of the Year\nWinner: Dan Hill (Co-composer with Barry Mann), \"Sometimes When We Touch\" by Dan Hill\nOther nominees:\n*Burton Cummings, \"Break It to Them Gently\" by Burton Cummings\n*Nick Gilder & James McCulloch, \"Hot Child in the City\" by Nick Gilder\n*Frank Mills, \"Music Box Dancer\" by Frank Mills\n*Brian Smith & Ra McGuire, \"Raise a Little Hell\" by Trooper\nCountry Female Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Carroll Baker\nCountry Male Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Ronnie Prophet\nCountry Group or Duo of the Year\nWinner: The Good Brothers\nFolk Singer of the Year\nWinner: Murray McLauchlan\nOther nominees:\n*Bruce Cockburn\n*Dan Hill\n*Gordon Lightfoot\n*Valdy\nInstrumental Artist of the Year\nWinner: Liona Boyd\nOther nominees:\n*André Gagnon\n*Hagood Hardy\n*Frank Mills\n*Black Light Orchestra\nProducer of the Year\nWinner: Gino Vannelli, Joe Vannelli & Ross Vannelli, Brother to Brother by Gino Vannelli\nOther nominees:\n*Matthew McCauley & Fred Mollin, Frozen in the Night by Dan Hill & McCluskey by David McCluskey\n*Jack Richardson, Richard T.
