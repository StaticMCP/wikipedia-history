Heather Phares, reviewing for Allmusic, said \"It's fitting that the film's soundtrack is dominated by ballads that feel like a long goodbye to Bella, Edward, and Jacob\", and said \"As with the other volumes of the series' music, however, this collection provides a surprisingly good showcase for female, indie-ish talent.\" Phares concluded, \"While Breaking Dawn isn't one of the more dynamic Twilight Saga soundtracks, it is one of the more emotive ones, and just may help fans get some closure as one of the biggest film franchises of the 2000s and 2010s comes to a close.\"\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2012)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak position\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Mexican Albums (AMPROFON)\n| 28\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2013)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard 200\n| 90\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top Rock Albums (Billboard)\n| 20\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Soundtrack Albums (Billboard)\n| 5\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://breakingdawnthesoundtrack.com/ Official Soundtrack for The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn] – official Breaking Dawn soundtrack site"
