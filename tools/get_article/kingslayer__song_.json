Produced by Bring Me the Horizon's lead vocalist Oliver Sykes and keyboardist Jordan Fish, the song appears on the group's 2020 commercial release Post Human: Survival Horror.\nDespite not being released as a single, the song has become a critical and commercial success, charting at no. 51 on the UK Singles Chart and receiving sales certifications in several countries.\nComposition and lyrics\nOliver Sykes described the song as \"sound[ing] like an anime TV trailer.\"\nSykes initially came up for the idea of the song while he was playing Call of Duty in Amsterdam, with the Kingslayer being what everyone wants to be. He used this idea as an analogy for then US president Donald Trump calling Antifa a \"terrorist organization\" and the chaos caused by the Extinction Rebellion, with Sykes feeling that people have to go out and do what they feel is right, no matter the cost. Hence the themes and for \"Kingslayer\" to break the barriers of the reality. Sykes would go on to compare the sound of the song to something off their second studio album Suicide Season, and how the cute vocals of Babymetal on the chorus would make for a perfect contrast on \"Kingslayer\".\nBabymetal originally recorded all of their parts in English before Sykes asked them to re-record in Japanese.\nLive performances\nThe two bands toured Japan together in October 2023, performing \"Kingslayer\" throughout the tour. A live music video was released for \"Kingslayer\" composed of footage from the Tokyo performance on 12 December 2023. Bring Me the Horizon and Babymetal would perform the song live together again at Sick New World 2024.\nPersonnel\n;Bring Me the Horizon\n*Oliver Sykes – lead vocals, production, engineering\n*Lee Malia – guitars\n*Jordan Fish – programming, backing vocals, production, engineering\n*Matt Kean – bass\n*Matt Nicholls – drums\n;Babymetal\n*Su-metal – lead vocals\n*Moametal – backing vocals\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for \"Kingslayer\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020)\n!scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ)\n| 24\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| UK Singles (OCC)\n| 51\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| UK Rock & Metal (OCC)\n| 2\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| US Hot Rock & Alternative Songs (Billboard)\n| 26\n|}\nCertifications\nReferences"
