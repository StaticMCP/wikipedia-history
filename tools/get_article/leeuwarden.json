It is the provincial capital and seat of the Provincial Council of Friesland.\nThe region has been continuously inhabited since the 10th century. It came to be known as Leeuwarden in the early 9th century AD and was granted city privileges in 1435. It is the main economic hub of Friesland, situated in a green and water-rich environment. Leeuwarden is a former royal residence and has a historic city centre, many historically relevant buildings, and a large shopping centre with squares and restaurants. Leeuwarden was awarded the title European Capital of Culture for 2018. Also, Leeuwarden has been a UNESCO City of Literature since 2019.\nThe  (Eleven Cities Tour), an ice skating tour passing the eleven cities of Friesland, starts and finishes in Leeuwarden.\nThe following towns and villages within the municipality have populations in excess of 1,000 people: Leeuwarden, Stiens, Grou, Goutum, Wergea, Jirnsum, Reduzum, and Wirdum. The municipality is governed by the mayor Sybrand van Haersma Buma and a coalition of the Labour Party, Christian Democratic Appeal, and GreenLeft.\nEtymology\nThe name \"Leeuwarden\" (or older variants of it) first came into use for Nijehove, the most important of the three villages (the other two being Oldehove and Hoek) which in the early 9th century merged into Leeuwarden (Villa Lintarwrde &nbsp;825). There is much uncertainty about the origin of the city's name. Historian and archivist Wopke Eekhoff summed up a total of over 200 different spelling variants, of which Leeuwarden (Dutch), Liwwadden (Stadsfries), and Ljouwert (West Frisian) are still in use.\nThe second part of the name is easily explained: Warden, West Frisian/Dutch/Low German for an artificial dwelling-hill, is a designation of terps, reflecting the historical situation.\nThe first part of the name, leeuw, means lion in modern standard Dutch. This interpretation corresponds with the coat of arms adopted by the city, canting arms featuring a heraldic lion. However, modern standard Dutch was not used in this region in the Middle Ages, when the city was called Lintarwrde. Some scholars argue that the name of the city is derived from leeu-, a corruption of luw- (Dutch for 'sheltered from the wind', cf. the maritime term leeward) or from lee- (a Dutch word for waterway). 'Sheltered landing place or harbour' could be the original meaning. This suits the watery province of Friesland and the position of the original three villages at the end of an important estuary called Middelzee.\nThe name is also similar to that of the French commune Lewarde, located in the Nord Department, an originally Flemish-speaking area annexed to France in the 17th century. Western Flemish was related to Frisian and also to Saxon up to the 11th century.\nHistory\nThe oldest remains of houses date back to the 2nd century AD in the Roman era and were discovered during an excavation near the Oldehove. Inhabited continuously since the 10th century, the city's first reference as a population centre is in German sources from 1285, and records exist of city privileges granted in 1435.  Situated along the Middelzee, it was an active centre of maritime trade. The waterway silted-up in the 13th century.\n(1398–1795)\n|1511|4360\n|1565|6600\n|1606|11330\n|1666|16500\n|1689|14300\n|1744|13490\n|1793|16446\n|1795|12707\n}}\nThe Grote or Jacobijnerkerk () is the oldest building in the city. The 15th century was the period of the two opposing Frisian factional parties Vetkopers and Schieringers. The bastions and a moat were built in the period 1481–1494. In 1747 William IV, Prince of Orange was the last stadtholder residing in the Stadhouderlijk Hof. In the first half of the 19th century the fortifications were demolished.\nFrom 1580 to 1752, a provincial mint operated in the city, minting gold, silver and copper coins of Friesland.\nThe Jewish community of Leeuwarden was one of the earliest in the Netherlands aside from Amsterdam, and was first mentioned in 1645. By 1670, the city council granted a man referred to as \"Jacob the Jew\" (in Dutch) permission to build a Jewish cemetery, meaning that there were enough Jews living there to require a cemetery and other communal institutions. Land for 'The Jodenkerkhof' (Jews' cemetery) was purchased in 1679, near the Oldehove tower.\nThe first synagogue in the city was built in the 17th century, and was also used by the city's Catholics who were not allowed to build a house of worship of their own because of the Protestant city authorities. The Jewish community enjoyed generally good relations with authorities in the 18th century and continued to expand throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, reaching a peak population of 1,236 in 1860.\n, 16 April 1945]]\nIn 1901 the city's population was 32,203.\nLeeuwarden, like the rest of the Netherlands, was occupied by German forces in 1940–1945. This ended when elements of the Royal Canadian Dragoons seized the initiative and advanced into the heavily-defended city on 15 April 1945, ignoring direct orders to wait for supporting infantry. German forces had been driven out by the end of the next day. (The anniversary is marked by both the Dragoons and the city, by flying each other's flags every 15 April.)\nKneppelfreed () was an incident on 16 November 1951 in front of the courthouse at Wilhelminaplein (Wilhelmina Square), when the police used batons against Frisian language activists during a protest against the exclusive use of Dutch in the courts. A committee of inquiry recommended that the Frisian language should receive legal status as a minority language.\nOn 19 October 2013, a fire broke out in a clothes shop on a busy pedestrian street. The fire started late in the afternoon and burned through the night, destroying five shops and eleven flats. The only casualty was a 24-year-old man who was living in one of the flats. The birthplace of Mata Hari was at first thought to be destroyed, but survived, albeit with considerable smoke and water damage.\nHeraldry\nThe coat of arms of Leeuwarden is the official symbol of the municipality. It consists of a blue escutcheon, a golden lion, and a crown. The fact that Leeuwarden carries a lion in its seal seems logical, considering that \"Leeuw\" is Dutch for \"Lion\". However, it is very plausible the oldest name of the city conceals an indication of water rather than an animal, and some sources suggest that the lion may have only been added after the name became official. It is also possible the coat of arms was a gift to the city from the powerful Minnema family.\nGeography\nLeeuwarden is located centrally in Friesland. The military Leeuwarden Air Base lies northwest of the city. East of the city lies recreational area and nature reserve De Groene Ster. It contains the windmill Himriksmole, a golf course and AquaZoo Friesland.\nPopulation centres\nOn 1 January 2014 parts of the neighbouring Boarnsterhim municipality were added to Leeuwarden. On 1 January 2018 it was enlarged by Leeuwarderadeel and parts of former municipality of Littenseradiel.\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"margin:0 2em 0 2em\"\n|Dutch name||West Frisian name||ALIGN=\"right\"|Population\n|-\n|Leeuwarden||Ljouwert||ALIGN=\"right\"|92,146\n|-\n|Stiens||Stiens||ALIGN=\"right\"|7,545\n|-\n|Grouw||Grou||ALIGN=\"right\"|5,655\n|-\n|Goutum||Goutum||ALIGN=\"right\"|2,945\n|-\n|Warga||Wergea||ALIGN=\"right\"|1,685\n|-\n|Irnsum||Jirnsum||ALIGN=\"right\"|1,360\n|-\n|Wirdum||Wurdum||ALIGN=\"right\"|1,210\n|-\n|Mantgum||Mantgum||ALIGN=\"right\"|1,175\n|-\n|Roordahuizum||Reduzum||ALIGN=\"right\"|1,125\n|-\n|Britsum||Britsum||ALIGN=\"right\"|960\n|-\n|Wartena||Warten||ALIGN=\"right\"|915\n|-\n| Wytgaard||Wytgaard||ALIGN=\"right\"|570\n|-\n|Weidum||Weidum||ALIGN=\"right\"|570\n|-\n|Cornjum||Koarnjum||ALIGN=\"right\"|435\n|-\n|Oosterlittens||Easterlittens||ALIGN=\"right\"|435\n|-\n|Lekkum||Lekkum||ALIGN=\"right\"|425\n|-\n|Hijum||Hijum||ALIGN=\"right\"|415\n|-\n|Jorwerd||Jorwert||ALIGN=\"right\"|335\n|-\n|Jelsum||Jelsum||ALIGN=\"right\"|325\n|-\n|Hijlaard||Hilaard||ALIGN=\"right\"|295\n|-\n|Oude Leije||Alde Leie||ALIGN=\"right\"|255\n|-\n|Snakkerburen||Snakkerbuorren||ALIGN=\"right\"|225\n|-\n|Finkum||Feinsum||ALIGN=\"right\"|205\n|-\n|Baard||Baard||ALIGN=\"right\"|185\n|-\n|Hempens||Himpens||ALIGN=\"right\"|155\n|-\n|Jellum||Jellum||ALIGN=\"right\"|150\n|-\n|Beers||Bears||ALIGN=\"right\"|125\n|-\n|Huins||Húns||ALIGN=\"right\"|115\n|-\n|Idaard||Idaerd||ALIGN=\"right\"|80\n|-\n|Friens||Friens||ALIGN=\"right\"|80\n|-\n|Swichum||Swichum||ALIGN=\"right\"|50\n|-\n|Warstiens||Warstiens||ALIGN=\"right\"|35\n|-\n|Aegum||Eagum||ALIGN=\"right\"|35\n|-\n|Miedum||Miedum||ALIGN=\"right\"|30\n|-\n|Lions||Leons||ALIGN=\"right\"|26\n|-\n|Teerns||Tearns||ALIGN=\"right\"|16\n|-\n|Total||||ALIGN=\"right\"|122,293\n|-\n|Source: Statistics Netherlands\n|}\nHamlets\nThe hamlets within the municipality are: Abbenwier, Angwier, Baarderbuorren, Bartlehiem (partially), De Him, De Hoek, De Trije Romers, Domwier, Finsterbuorren, Fûns, Groote Bontekoe, Goatum, Hesens, Hoarne, Hoptille, It Hoflân, It Wiel, Marwert, Midsbuorren, Narderbuorren, Noardein, Oude Schouw (partially), Poelhuzen, Rewert (partially), Skillaerd, Skrins, Suderbuorren, Suorein, Tichelwurk, Truerd, Tsienzerbuorren, Tsjaard, Tsjeintgum, Vierhuis, Vrouwbuurtstermolen (partially), Wammert and Wieuwens\nClimate\n}}\nDemographics\nAs of 2020, Leeuwarden had a total population of 124,084.\nInhabitants by origin\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!2020\n!Numbers\n!%\n|-\n!Dutch natives\n|102,099\n|82.2%\n|-\n!Western migration background\n|9,745\n|7.8%\n|-\n!Non-Western migration background\n|12,240\n|9.8%\n|-\n|Indonesia\n|2,276\n|1.83%\n|-\n|Netherlands Antilles and Aruba\n|1,589\n|1.28%\n|-\n|Suriname\n|1,483\n|1.19%\n|-\n|Morocco\n|1,081\n|0.87%\n|-\n|Turkey\n|547\n|0.4%\n|-\n|Total\n|124,084\n|100%\n|}\nCulture\nMuseums\nMuseums in the city of Leeuwarden:\n* Fries Museum.
