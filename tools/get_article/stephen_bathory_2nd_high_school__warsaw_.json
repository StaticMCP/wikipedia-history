Famous alumni include among others composer Witold Lutosławski and poet and Home Army soldier Krzysztof Kamil Baczyński, killed during the Warsaw Uprising.\nThe school offers subject-profiled classes taught both in Polish and English. Enhanced education in mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, humanities (languages and history) and geography is provided. Since 2005, the school offers the two-year IB program intended for students aged 16–19.\nHistory\nThe school's history starts with the founding of the Stefan Batory Gymnasium (now called Lyceum) on 1 September 1918 with Zdzisław Rudzki as its first headmaster. It was originally located at 21 Kapucyńska Street. Construction of the current premises, the work of the eminent architect and urbanist Prof. Tadeusz Tołwiński, started in 1922 and was completed in September 1924. The school was equipped with exceptionally modern learning facilities and science labs, an astronomical observatory (now closed), an underground swimming pool, and botanical garden. The teaching staff was composed of distinguished teachers like Stanisław Młodożeńiec, Stanisław Arnold, Stanisław Malec, Gustaw Wuttke, Adam Zieleńczyk to name just a few.\nAt the outset of the World War II, during German invasion of Poland in September 1939, the school served as a field hospital, supporting the nearby Ujazdów Hospital. During the German occupation of Poland (1939–1945) the school's buildings were requisitioned and hosted German primary and secondary schools. Its opening was attended by Governor General Hans Frank. Throughout the occupation period Stefan Batory Gymnasium teachers organized underground education for its students.\nIn the post World War II period the name of the school was changed to Stefan Batory Lyceum (full Polish name - II Liceum Ogółnokształcące im. Stefana Batorego w Warszawie).\nIn 1996, during a visit to Poland, the school was visited by Queen Elizabeth II and in 1997, the school was visited by Michael Jackson.\nIn 2017, a team from the school became the first from Poland to win a title (in the Varsity Bowl Division) in the International History Bee and Bowl European Championships, which were held in Rome that year.\nIn 2023, the History Bee and Bowl team won 3rd place in the International History Bee and Bowl European Championships, which were held in Barcelona.\nIn 2024, the History Bee and Bowl team won 1st place in the International History Bee and Bowl European Championships, which were held in London.\nNotable alumni\nThe following list is based on the list provided on the website of the school who have Wikipedia pages about them, historian and alumni information:\n*Vanessa Aleksander - actress\n*Krzysztof Kamil Baczyński (1939) - poet, Home Army (Armia Krajowa) soldier\n* (1969) - singer\n*Jan Bytnar (Rudy) (1939) - WW2 resistance hero\n*Barbara Hesse-Bukowska (1948) - pianist\n*Andrzej Ciechanowiecki - art historian and patron\n*Marian Danysz - physicist\n*Adam Galos - historian\n*Agnieszka Holland (1966) - director\n*Jerzy Kroh - chemist\n*Andrzej Łapicki - actor\n*Hanna Lis - journalist\n*Witold Lutosławski (1931) - composer\n*Michał Matczak (Mata) - rapper\n*Anna Mucha - actress\n*Henry Millicer - aircraft designer and pilot\n*Jan Nowak-Jeziorański - “Courier from Warsaw”, remembered for his work as an emissary  shuttling between the commanders\n*Maciej Nowicki - architect\n*Daniel Olbrychski (1963) - actor\n*Justyna Pochanke - journalist\n*Piotr Słonimski - geneticist, pioneer of yeast mitochondrial genetics\n* (1926) - hydro engineer, scholar, politician, father of Jadwiga Staniszkis\n*Agnieszka Wagner - actress\n*Dorota Wellman - journalistof the Home Army and the Polish government-in-exile\n*Anna Wendzikowska - actress\n*Tadeusz Zawadzki (Zoska) (1939) - WW2 resistance hero\nReferences"
