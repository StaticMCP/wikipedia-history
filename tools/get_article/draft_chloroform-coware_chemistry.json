Typically, this is achieved by reacting chloroform with a strong aqueous alkali metal hydroxide, such as potassium hydroxide (KOH) or cesium hydroxide (CsOH), in one chamber of the COware reactor. This reaction proceeds via the formation of dichlorocarbene as an intermediate, which subsequently undergoes hydrolysis to yield carbon monoxide, water, and the corresponding metal chloride salt.\nThe \"COware\" Reactor Setup\nThe \"COware\" reactor setup is a key enabling technology for \"Chloroform-COware Chemistry.\" Its design typically involves two separate glass chambers that are connected, allowing for the diffusion of gases between them. One chamber serves as the carbon monoxide generator, where chloroform is hydrolyzed under basic conditions. This chamber is usually equipped with an inlet for the addition of reagents, such as the chloroform and the aqueous base. The second chamber is where the carbonylation reaction takes place, containing the substrate, catalyst, solvent, and any other necessary reagents. The connection between the two chambers allows the generated carbon monoxide gas to diffuse from the first chamber to the second, where it can participate in the chemical reaction.\nApplications\nAminocarbonylation of isoquinolines: The technique has been used in the aminocarbonylation of isoquinolines and quinolines to synthesize valuable pharmaceutically relevant compounds.\nCarbonylative Suzuki coupling:  A reaction that combines carbon monoxide insertion with a Suzuki cross-coupling reaction to form ketones.\nCarbonylation of phenols: Carbonylation of a wide range of medicinally relevant phenols, including both natural and synthetic derivatives, into their corresponding aryl ester.\nSynthesis of N-capped peptides: The method allows for the synthesis of a variety of N-capped peptides, including those with biological relevance, such as anticancer drug analogues.\nKey Advantages\nSafety: The two-chamber system produces CO ex situ from chloroform in a closed setup, minimizing exposure risks compared to handling pure CO gas, which can be toxic.\nCost-Effective & Convenient: Chloroform is a relatively inexpensive and readily available chemical, and is easier to handle than high-pressure CO or toxic surrogates (e.g., phosgene derivatives).\nIsotopic Labeling Compatibility: Commercially available isotopically labeled chloroform (¹³CHCl₃ and ¹⁴CHCl₃) can be readily used to synthesize isotopically labeled carbonyl compounds, valuable tools for mechanistic studies and in pharmaceutical research.\nReferences"
