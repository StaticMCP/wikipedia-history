Before 1079, she was given royal title as Princess Myeongbok () while living in Myeongbok Palace and later changed into Princess Yeondeok () when she moved to Yeondeok Palace. Her mother, Lady Kim was formally called as \"Grand Lady of the Nakrang State\" ().\nThen, following her husband who ascended the throne as a King, she become a Queen Consort in 1099. But, in the Goryeosa, there was some misunderstanding because her name after becoming a queen consort, her clan name was written as Yi clan () which wasn't her clan.\nHowever, on 10 November 1105, her husband passed away and their oldest son, Wang U ascended the throne as Yejong of Goryeo those making Yu honoured both as Queen Mother () and Grand Queen Mother () in 1105. Beside Yejong, she bore Sukjong 6 other sons and 4 daughters. After that, she was given Sungmyeong Mansion () in Cheonhwa Hall () as her residence and affiliated institution. As a queen dowager, her birthday was also specially celebrated.\nLater life\nDeath\nOn 8 August 1112, the queen dowager caught an illness and died suddenly after went to recuperation outside the palace at her old age in Sinbak Temple. On 8th month (Lunar calendar) in the same year, she was buried in Sungneung Tomb () and received her posthumous name.\nFuneral\nDuring her funeral, the Liao dynasty sent their envoys to mourn. But, seeing this, the internal court said:\n(\"임금님, 쟤네들이 태후님 제사 지내러 온 건 이번이 처음 아닌가요? 인국(隣國)이 이런 예우(禮)를 보여준걸 축하드립니다!\").\nPosthumous name\n*In 1140 (18th year reign of King Injong), name Yu-ga () was added.\n*In October 1253 (40th year reign of King Gojong), name Gwang-hye () was added to her posthumous name too.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Item/E0018347 Queen Myeongui] on the Encyclopedia of Korean Culture .\n*[http://db.history.go.kr/KOREA/search/searchResult.do?sort=levelId&dir=ASC&start=-1&limit=20&page=1&pre_page=1&itemIds=&indexSearch=N&codeIds=PERIOD-0-3&synonym=off&chinessChar=on&searchTermImages=%EB%AA%85%EC%9D%98%EC%99%95%ED%83%9C%ED%9B%84%C2%A0&searchKeywordType=BI&searchKeywordMethod=EQ&searchKeyword=%EB%AA%85%EC%9D%98%EC%99%95%ED%83%9C%ED%9B%84&searchKeywordConjunction=AND#searchDetail/kr/kr_064r_0010_0010_0010_0300/19/5/19/r Queen Myeongui] on Goryeosa .\n*[https://www.doopedia.co.kr/mo/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view2&MAS_IDX=101013000840883 명의왕후] on Doosan Encyclopedia ."
