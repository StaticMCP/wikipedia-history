Due to the scope of this list, pre-war changes are not shown. Most of these divisions trained in Berlin, which is also where new military technology was kept and tested.\nGerman unit designations\nThese designations are normally not translated and used in the German form in the unit name or description.\nArmy (Heer)\nPanzer divisions\nNumbered panzer divisions\nNamed panzer divisions\nLight mechanized divisions\nThe designation \"Light\" (leichte in German) had various meanings in the German Army of World War II. There were a series of 5 Light divisions; the first four were pre-war mechanized formations organized for use as mechanized cavalry, and the fifth was an ad hoc collection of mechanized elements rushed to Africa to help the Italians and organized into a division once there. All five were eventually converted to ordinary Panzer divisions.\nVarious other divisions were dubbed \"Light\" for other reasons, and are listed among the Infantry Series Divisions (see below ↓).\nInfantry series divisions\nThe backbone of the Heer was the infantry division. Of the 154 divisions deployed against the Soviet Union in 1941, including reserves, there were 100 infantry, 19 panzer, 11 motorized, 9 security, 5 Waffen-SS, 4 \"light\", 4 mountain, 1 SS-police, and 1 cavalry. A typical infantry division in June 1941 had 17,734 men organized into the following sub-units:\n*three infantry regiments with staff and communications units\n**three battalions with:\n***three infantry companies\n***one heavy weapons company\n**one anti-tank company (mot.)\n**one artillery company\n**one reconnaissance unit\n*one tank destroyer battalion with:\n**three companies (each with twelve 3.7&nbsp;cm guns)\n*one artillery regiment\n**three battalions\n***three batteries\n*one pioneer battalion\n*one communications unit\n*one field replacement battalion\n*Supply, medical, veterinary, mail, and police\nInfantry divisions were raised in waves (Aufstellungswelle), sets of divisions with a standardized table of organization and equipment. In general the later waves (i.e., the higher-numbered divisions) were of lower quality than the earlier ones.\nNumbered divisions\nDivisions are listed by number and reflect their lineage where names or designations were changed over time.\n1st to 99th\n100th to 199th\nlater 9th Mountain Division)\n* Division Nr. 141 (later 141st Reserve Division)\n* Division Nr. 143 (later 143rd Reserve Division)\n* Division Nr. 147 (later 147th Reserve Division)\n* Division Nr. 148 (later 148th Reserve Division, 148th Infantry Division)\n* 149th Field Training Division (planned but not formed)\n* 150th Field Training Division (planned but not formed)\n* 151st Field Training Division (planned but not formed)\n* Division Nr. 151 (later 151st Reserve Division)\n* 152nd Field Training Division (planned but not formed)\n* Division Nr. 152\n* Division Nr. 153 (later 153rd Reserve Division, 153rd Field Training Division, 153rd Grenadier Division)\n* Division Nr. 154 (later 154th Reserve Division, 154th Field Training Division, 154th Infantry Division)\n* Division Nr. 155 (later Division Nr. 155 (mot.), Panzer Division Nr. 155, 155th Reserve Panzer Division)\n* 155th Field Training Division (later 155th Infantry Division)\n** Not related to Division Nr. 155.\n* Division Nr. 156 (later 156th Reserve Division, 47th Infantry Division, 47th Volksgrenadier Division)\n* 156th Field Training Division (later 156th Infantry Division)\n** Not related to Division Nr. 156\n* Division Nr. 157 (later 157th Reserve Division, 157th Mountain Division, 8th Mountain Division)\n* Division Nr. 158 (later 158th Reserve Division)\n* 158th Infantry Division\n** Not related to Division Nr. 158.\n* Division Nr. 159 (later 159th Reserve Division, 159th Infantry Division)\n* Division Nr. 160 (later 160th Reserve Division, 160th Infantry Division)\n* 161st Infantry Division\n* 162nd Infantry Division (later 162nd Turkoman Division, with foreign troops)\n* 163rd Infantry Division\n* 164th Infantry Division (later Fortress Division Kreta, which split into –)\n** Fortress Brigade Kreta\n** 164th Light Afrika Division\n* Division Nr. 165 (later 165th Reserve Division)\n* Division Nr. 166 (later 166th Reserve Division, 166th Infantry Division)\n* 167th Infantry Division (later 585th Volksgrenadier Division, 167th Volksgrenadier Division)\n* 168th Infantry Division\n* 169th Infantry Division\n* 170th Infantry Division\n* Division Nr. 171 (later 171st Reserve Division, 48th Infantry Division, 48th Volksgrenadier Division)\n* Division Nr. 172 (later 172nd Reserve Division)\n* Division Nr. 173 (later 173rd Reserve Division)\n* Division Nr. 174 (later 174th Reserve Division)\n* Division Nr. 176 (later 176th Infantry Division)\n* Division Nr. 177\n* Division Nr. 178 (later Division Nr. 178 (mot.)\n* 180th Infantry Division\n* 181st Infantry Division\n* Division Nr. 182 (later 182nd Reserve Division, 182nd Infantry Division)\n* 183rd Infantry Division (later 564th Volksgrenadier Division, 183rd Volksgrenadier Division)\n* 187th Reserve Division (later 42nd Jäger Division)\n* Division Nr. 188 (later 188th Reserve Mountain Division, 188th Mountain Division)\n* 189th Reserve Division (later 189th Infantry Division)\n* 190th Infantry Division\n* Division Nr. 191 (later 191st Reserve Division, 49th Infantry Division)\n* 196th Infantry Division\n* 197th Infantry Division\n* 198th Infantry Division\n* 199th Infantry Division\n|colwidth=25em}}\n201st to 299th\n* 299th Infantry Division\n|colwidth=25em}}\n300th to 999th\nNamed divisions\n* Shadow Division Böhmen  (later 237th Infantry Division)\n* Shadow Division Dresden\n* Shadow Division Schlesien\n* Shadow Division Ostpreußen\n* Sardinian Infantry Division\n|colwidth=25em}}\nLandwehr divisions\nMountain divisions\nSki division\n* 1st Ski Division (previously 1st Ski Brigade)\nCavalry divisions\nAccording to Davies, the Cavalry divisions were mounted infantry and the Cossack divisions were \"true cavalry\", modelled on the Russian cavalry divisions.\nArtillery divisions\nNamed fortress divisions\nNamed training divisions\nRAD divisions\nIn 1945 the Reichsarbeitsdienst (Reich Labour Service) transferred personnel to the army to form new divisions as part of the 35th Aufstellungswelle, the last of the war.\nField replacement divisions\nNavy (Kriegsmarine)\nMarine divisions\nAir Force (Luftwaffe)\nHermann Göring divisions\nThe Hermann Göring formations grew from a single police detachment to an entire armored corps over the course of the war. The later epithet Fallschirm (\"parachute\") was purely honorific.\nAirborne divisions\nTo keep its existence secret, the first German airborne division was named as if a Flieger (\"flier\") division in the series of Luftwaffe divisions that controlled air assets rather than ground troops-named 7th Flieger Division (often translated 7th Air Division - which see: 1st Parachute Division (Germany)) The division was later reorganized to start a series of nominally airborne divisions. Though named  (\"paratrooper\") divisions, only some of them participated in airdrops in the early part of the war. Whilst the first five divisions received full paratrooper training, the remaining divisions did not and in practice operated as ordinary infantry throughout their existence. The lower-numbered ones earned and maintained an elite status, but quality generally declined among the higher-numbered divisions.\nField divisions\nLuftwaffe Field Divisions were ordinary infantry divisions organized from Luftwaffe personnel made available after mid-war due to problems with manpower. They were originally Luftwaffe units but were later handed over to the Heer, retaining their numbering but with Luftwaffe attached to distinguish them from similarly numbered divisions already existing in the Heer.\nTraining divisions\nAnti-Aircraft divisions\nThese were headquarters for controlling aggregates of flak (\"anti-aircraft artillery\") assets rather than ordinary combined arms divisions organized for ground combat.\nWaffen-SS (Schutzstaffel)\nAll divisions in the Waffen-SS were ordered in a single series up to 38th, regardless of type. Those tagged with nationalities were at least nominally recruited from those nationalities. Many of the higher-numbered units were small battle groups (Kampfgruppen), i.e. divisions in name only.\nAlso Panzer Division Kempf, a temporary unit of mixed Heer and Waffen-SS components.\nSee also\n* List of World War II military units of Germany\n* List of German army groups in World War II\n* List of German corps in World War II\n* List of German brigades in World War II\nNotes\nReferences\n;Bibliography\n* Astel, John; Goodwin, A.
