It is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of the Association for Biblical Higher Education. It is chartered by the province of New Brunswick and authorized to confer degrees in church-related education. The university is also registered with the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada, the Association of Christian Schools International, and the Christian Higher Education Canada (CHEC).\nHistory\nKingswood University was founded in October 1945, in Woodstock, New Brunswick by the Alliance of the Reformed Baptist Church of Canada as the Holiness Bible Institute. Its primary purpose was the training of ministers to serve the Reformed Baptist Church within the Atlantic region. In 1947, the school was relocated to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia and renamed Bethany Bible College.\nIn 1965, Bethany relocated a second time to its present location in Sussex, New Brunswick. In July 1966, the Alliance of the Reformed Baptist Church of Canada joined the Wesleyan Methodist Church. Two years later in June 1968, the Wesleyan Methodist Church merged with the Pilgrim Holiness Church to form what is known today as The Wesleyan Church.\nOver the course of time, the university has made significant advances in its academic programs. In May 1970, the General Board of Administration of The Wesleyan Church authorized Bethany Bible College to award the Bachelor of Arts Degree in Religion, the basic four-year program for those entering full-time ministerial service. In 1983, the Province of New Brunswick, through official legislation, authorized Bethany to grant church-related degrees. Accreditation was granted in 1987 by the Association for Biblical Higher Education and reaffirmed in 1997.\nIn the fall of 2011, the name of Bethany Bible College was formally changed to Kingswood University.\nOn July 1, 2015, Dr. Stephen J. Lennox became Kingswood's 12th president of the university.\nOn February 3rd, 2025, Kingswood University announced the appointment of Dr. Rick A. Christman as President-Elect. Dr. Christman previously served as Executive Vice President of Columbia International University (CIU) in Columbia, South Carolina, overseeing areas of operation such as Student Life, Campus Security, Online Admissions/Enrolment and Athletics. Dr. Christman will become Kingswood's 13th President on July 1st, 2025.\nLocation & Campus\nKingswood University Tom Phillippe House.Kingswood University's campus is located on the west side of Sussex, New Brunswick, about 80km west of Moncton, New Brunswick and about 70km east of Saint John, New Brunswick.
