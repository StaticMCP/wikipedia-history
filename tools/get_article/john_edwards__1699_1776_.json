He was a weaver by trade, but is said in early life to have spent seven years as assistant to a bookseller in London, and during that time is supposed to have gained considerable information.\nHis translation of John Bunyan's ''Pilgrim's Progress'' was published in 1767–68.\nEdwards had two sons, Cain and Abel. Cain gained some note as a publisher of almanacs, and his father is also thought to have produced almanacs.\nJohn Edwards prepared his own monument, and inscribed thereon 1 Cor. xv. 52, in Latin. He died in 1776 and was buried on 28 December at Glyn Ceiriog.\nReferences"
