Larking was a right-handed opening batsman. He was born at Loose in Kent and was educated at Charterhouse School.\nAt school Larking played as a consistent opening batsman who was described as a \"prolific run-getter\". Batting in partnership with Anthony Lovett against Harrow School in 1940 the pair scored 250 runs between them in a little over two hours, Larking playing the \"far superior innings\" to score 129 runs during which he \"scarcely made an error\".

Larking had toured North America with the Public School side in 1939.\nAfter the war Larking made three first-class cricket appearances for Kent in the 1946 County Championship all in July. He made his debut against Surrey at The Oval before going on to play in the return match at Blackheath and then against Middlesex at Maidstone at the end of the month.
