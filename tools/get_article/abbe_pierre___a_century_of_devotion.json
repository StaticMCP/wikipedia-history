Frédéric Tellier was announced as director, and co-writer of the script with Olivier Gorce. The idea for the film was born from the desire of Wassim Béji and SND Films to tell the story of the priest's life. Béji explained, \"Abbé Pierre had an incredible life and was a true rock star. To tell the story of this figure who traversed the 20th century is to tell our story\". The film was produced by Béji's WY Productions and by SND, in co-production with France 3 Cinéma.\nIn developing the screenplay, Frédéric Tellier researched extensively for about 3 years. He read books written by Abbé Pierre or by his relatives and watched news footage as well as fictional portrayals of the subject, including ''Hiver 54, l'abbé Pierre (1989) and Les Chiffonniers d'Emmaüs (1955). He also spoke with individuals who knew the priest, such as Laurent Desmard, who worked in a high-ranking position at Emmaüs and who was his private secretary.\nFilming\nFilming began in December 2021, under the working title Les Onze Vies de l'Abbé Pierre (The Eleven Lives of Abbé Pierre).
