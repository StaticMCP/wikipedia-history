That Declaration affirms the principles of democracy, the elements and exercise of democratic government, and the international scope of democracy.\nThe international conferences on new and restored democracies (ICNRD process) began in 1988 under the initiative of President Corazon C. Aquino of the Philippines after the so-called peaceful \"People Power Revolution\" overthrew the 20-year dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos. Initially an inter-governmental forum, the ICNRD process developed into a tripartite structure with participation of governments, parliaments and civil society. The sixth conference (ICNRD-6) that took place in Doha, Qatar, in 2006 reinforced the tripartite nature of the process and concluded with a declaration and Plan of Action which reaffirmed the fundamental principles and values of democracy.\nFollowing up on the outcome of ICNRD-6, an advisory board set up by the chair of the process, Qatar, decided to promote an International Day of Democracy. Qatar took the lead in drafting the text of a United Nations General Assembly resolution and convened consultations with UN member states. At the suggestion of the IPU, on 15 September (date of the Universal Declaration on Democracy) was chosen as the day when the international community would celebrate each year the International Day of Democracy.  The resolution, titled \"Support by the United Nations system of efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies,\" was adopted by consensus on 8 November 2007.\nHistory\n2000s\nThe First International Day of Democracy took place in 2008.\nThe theme for International Day of Democracy 2009 was \"Democracy and political tolerance\". At the U.N. Headquarters there was a speech by the Secretary-General and a screening of the documentary film Please Vote for Me.\n2010s\nFor International Day of Democracy 2010, a panel discussion on \"Democracy and the Millennium Development Goals\" was co-organized by the International Conference of New and Restored Democracy and the Permanent Mission of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\nThe theme for International Day of Democracy 2011 was \"Peace and Democracy: Make Your Voice heard\".\nThe theme for International Day of Democracy 2012 was \"Democracy Education\".\nIn 2013, the IPU promoted the International Day of Democracy through its Member Parliaments in 162 countries around the world. As a result, a number of parliaments from all over the globe announced their events to be held on or close to 15 September. The year's theme was \"Strengthening Voices for Democracy\" and IPU launched an online contest to hear and gather stories from local democracy champions that managed to make their voices heard. These stories were to inspire people to take action in their own community.\nThe theme for International Day of Democracy 2014 was \"Engaging Young People on Democracy\". IPU has urged action and changes in mindset if disillusioned and alienated youth the world over are to be engaged in political decision-making. In its press release, IPU President Abdelwahad Radi said, \"It is a cliché to always link youth to the future. Young people not only have the power to define the future, but also decide on the present. However, they are largely absent from formal decision-making politics and this has to change\". The IPU says youth participation has a special meaning for it and that a programme to promote young men and women’s involvement in the democratic process is getting underway, in follow-up to the resolution adopted by the IPU Assembly in 2010. The IPU announced it would organize the first Global Conference of Young Parliamentarians on 10 and 11 October 2014 and all parliaments were invited to attend. A photo contest titled \"Engage for Change\" encourages youth to show what action they take to bring about positive change in society by sending a photo that shows them working for positive change in their community, region, country or the world.\nThe theme for International Day of Democracy 2015 was \"Space for Civil Society\".\nThe theme for International Day of Democracy 2016 was \"Democracy and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\".\nThe theme for International Day of Democracy 2017 was \"Democracy and Conflict Prevention\".\nThe theme for International Day of Democracy 2018 was \"Democracy under Strain: Solutions for a Changing World\". Coinciding with the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Day is also an opportunity to highlight the values of freedom and respect for human rights as essential elements of democracy.\nThe theme for International Day of Democracy 2019 was \"Inclusion and Participation as Foundations of Democracy\". \"This year's International Day of Democracy is an opportunity to recall that democracy is about people. Democracy is built on inclusion, equal treatment and participation—and it is a fundamental building block for peace, sustainable development, and human rights.\"\n2020s\nThe theme for International Day of Democracy 2020 was \"COVID-19: A Spotlight on Democracy\".\nThe theme for International Day of Democracy 2021 was \"Strengthening democratic resilience in the face of future crises\".\nThe theme for International Day of Democracy 2022 was \"Protecting Press Freedom for Democracy\".\nThe theme for International Day of Democracy 2023 was \"Empowering the next generation\".\nThe theme for International Day of Democracy 2024 was \"Navigating AI for Governance and Citizen Engagement\".\nThe theme for International Day of Democracy 2025 was \"From Voice to Action\".\nSee also\n* Civic engagement\n* Democracy Day in other countries\n* Electoral system\n* European Local Democracy Week\n* UK Parliament Week\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.un.org/en/observances/democracy-day This year's events - UN Website]\n* [http://www.ipu.org/dem-e/idd/overview.htm International Day of Democracy, 15 September]"
