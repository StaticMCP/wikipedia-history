He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a left-handed pitcher from  to  for the Montreal Expos, Philadelphia Phillies, and the Houston Astros. He was a pitching coach for four MLB teams, including with the New York Mets from mid-2008 to 2017.\nEarly life\nWarthen was born in Omaha, Nebraska and attended Omaha North High School, graduating in 1971. He was a high school All-American quarterback, tight end, and linebacker in football and also a star in baseball. He was the 1971 co-winner of the B'nai B'rith Award. In 2018, he was inducted into the Omaha Public Schools Athletic Hall of Fame.\nPlaying career\nWarthen was drafted by the Montreal Expos in the second round of the 1971 Major League Baseball draft. He pitched first for the Watertown Expos in the 1971 Northern League, and was 9–3 with a 3.96 ERA, leading the league with 10 complete games and second in the league in wins.\nHe made his MLB debut as a 22-year-old with the Expos on May 18, 1975, pitching a scoreless eighth inning against the Cincinnati Reds. In his rookie season in 1975, Warthen was 8–6 with three saves and a 3.11 ERA in  innings over 40 games (18 starts), and had the fourth most strikeouts per nine innings (6.871) and third fewest hits per nine innings (6.978) in the National League. Warthen later said that he hurt his arm during a stretch that summer, when he pitched a complete game on a Friday, then came in relief two days later.\nWarthen did not match his rookie performance. He went 2–10 with a 5.30 ERA for Montreal in 1976. Both his wins were two-hit complete game shutouts. The Expos traded him and Barry Foote to the Philadelphia Phillies for Tim Blackwell and Wayne Twitchell in June 1977, but he pitched only  relief innings for the Phillies. After spending most of 1978 with the Triple-A Oklahoma City 89ers, winning the American Association Pitcher of the Year Award, the Phillies traded him to the Houston Astros on September 2 for Dan Larson. He pitched in five September games for the Astros. His final MLB appearance was his best of the season: he pitched 8 innings and allowed both runs in a 2–1 loss to the San Francisco Giants on September 29. He finished his major-league career with a 12–21 win–loss record and a 4.31 ERA. He continued to pitch in the minors through 1982.\nCoaching career\nof Warthen as a coach with the Chattanooga Lookouts]]\nWarthen began his coaching career with the Pittsburgh Pirates minor league organization in 1981 and 1982, serving as a player-coach.
