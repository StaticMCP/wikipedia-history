It suffered heavy damage by bombs during World War II and moved to Brook Street next to Claridge's Hotel.\nJenifer Emery became chairwoman of the company in the 1980s. In 2005, together with her son Alistair Emery, she acquired the company from Claridge's and has since relocated the business to Cardinal Place in Victoria.\nEdward Goodyear has enjoyed patronage from Queen Victoria. The company was granted a Royal Warrant of Appointment as her florist from Queen Elizabeth II in 1955, and from Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh in 1978. Jenifer Emery and Derek Goodyear, Edward Goodyear's grandson, hold these warrants personally and make them available to Edward Goodyear.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.edwardgoodyear.co.uk/ Homepage of Edward Goodyear]"
