The high school offers comprehensive general and Judaic studies programs, enabling students to benefit from both the product and the process of learning.\nHistory\nThe high school opened as Maimonides Secondary School in September 1987, housed on the upper floor of Schara Tzedeck Synagogue. The school moved to Baillie Street in 1992, and was renamed to Talmud Torah High School in 1998.\nIn 2005, King David High School opened the doors to a new facility at Willow and 41st Avenue, in close proximity to the Vancouver Jewish Community Centre.\nThe school continues to receive changes to its interior and exterior structure. Around 2011, the school received a renovation to its library interior. These types of changes will continue to happen for years to come. More recently, the high school has planned to extend the school for 2026, ridding its current backyard.\nFacilities and academics\nIn addition to classrooms, King David High School has two science labs, a music and drama studio, a library, an art room, and a foods room. The high school offers an online schooling/grading system. However, students are still mandatory to enter and use the building throughout their time at King David High School. The school also includes e-mail addresses issued for all staff and students, a library for reading and studying, and many other smart technologies.\nA [http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/ British Columbia Ministry of Education] report recognized the teachers for their commitment to individual support and enrichment.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.kdhs.org/ King David High School website]"
