In 1979, Ware moved to back Thursday Island with her parents, where she established a souvenir and cultural artefact shop. Rosie is married with two daughters.\nWare produces work inspired by the maritime history, culture and environment of the Torres Strait Islands that surrounds her. \"l fell in love with the first lino-printed fabric I saw, covered with cultural motifs, dugong and turtle,\" she has said. \"But when I touched the cloth and felt the rough texture of the cotton, that was something. That's when the seed was planted for my textile career.\" She also spent time with then Prime Minister Tony Abbott when he visited Thursday Island.\nIn 1998, Ware travelled to the Tiwi lslands to investigate the textile design practices.\nHer work has been exhibited at the National Gallery of Australia, Australian War Memorial and Queensland Gallery of Modern Art. She was featured in 2015 Yarn ups at the Australian National University and her artwork Torres Strait Light Infantry Battalion was featured in the exhibition For Country, For Nation at the National War Memorial, Canberra.\nReferences\nExternal links"
