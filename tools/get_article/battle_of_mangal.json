He marched by Muzaffarabad and Pakhli with 7,000 foot soldiers under his command. When he reached Mangal, around 25,000 Pashtun and Hazara troops and their leader, Muhammad Khan Tarin, who opposed the Sikh's passage, attacked the Sikhs. Despite being outnumbered, the Sikhs defeated their opponents with a loss of 2,000 men.\nAftermath\nThe Jaduns to save their town paid down a fine of 5 and a half rupees per house to the Sikhs. Hari Singh Nalwa then built a fort at Nawanshahr. The Maharaja, partly pleased with the treasures and partly to reward his lieutenant for the victory, made Hari Singh Nalwa the governor of the entirety of Hazara.\nSee also\n* Nihang\n* Martyrdom and Sikhism\nReferences"
