The museum has been built within the Khujand Fortress, overlooking the Syr Darya (known in antiquity as the Jaxartes) reconstructed in 1999 on the southeastern corner of the old city wall. The museum was founded in 1986.\nCollections\nThe museum was opened on 29 November 1986, as part of the events celebrating the 2500th anniversary of the city, believed to have been founded as Cyropolis. It is among the 10 largest museums in Tajikistan. There are over 15,000 items in the museum's collections, and it features a wide range of artifacts and displays related to the history of the Sughd Region from prehistoric times to the present day. Items on display include rare Tajiki handwoven rugs, Tajiki embroidery, pottery, household items and costumes. Looking further back in time are dioramas of prehistoric life, modern marble mosaics depicting the life of Alexander of Macedon, who built the most distant of his cities nearby and is believed to have captured the city in 329BC, and a statue of Timur Malik, famous for resisting the Mongol invasion in 1219 and 1220. There is also a section of the exhibition related to the history of the fortress, which has been destroyed and rebuilt multiple times over the years.\nReferences"
