It is owned and utilized by Syracuse University.\nIt is currently home to the School of Design of the College of Visual and Performing Arts. It served as the temporary home for the School of Architecture, while the on campus Slocum Hall was being renovated. In addition, the Goldring Arts Journalism Program is headquartered in the building.\nPurchase by Syracuse University\nThe Warehouse before its renovation\nIt was purchased in 2005 by Syracuse University, which renovated the building for classroom, gallery, and studio use at a cost of $9 million. The renovation was designed by Syracuse alumnus Richard Gluckman of New York City-based Gluckman Mayner Architects.  The design firm was honored for their work on the Warehouse.  In November 2013, the building was official renamed in honor of Chancellor Cantor, who was instrumental in the purchase and renovation of the building.\nThe Warehouse is a collaboration between Syracuse University and the Syracuse community which resulted in repurposing an underutilized building in Syracuse's historic Armory Square into an academic facility. The renovated structure provides flexible space for design studios, classrooms, and offices for the School of Design, while providing a downtown venue for public lectures, exhibitions, and galleries.\nSchool of Design\nThe Warehouse houses the Syracuse University School of Design and the University's central marketing team. The ground floor offers a cafe, reading room, community classrooms, lecture hall, and work spaces, a community exhibition space and an international contemporary art gallery, and is the most public space in The Warehouse.  The first floor is home to the School of Design administrative offices, a large lecture space, a digital fabrication lab/wood shop, and the Genet Art Gallery.  The second floor are central marketing's offices.  The third floor is home to the Communications Design program; the fourth floor is home to the Museum Studies program, and the Syracuse University Office of Community Engagement and Economic Development; the fifth floor is home to the Industrial + Interaction Design program; the sixth floor is home to the Environmental + Interior Design (EDI) program; and the seventh floor is home to the Fashion Design program. Part of The Warehouse's basement contains spray booths and a \"dirty room\" for messy projects.\nThe Warehouse Gallery\nThe gallery opened on April 29, 2006 under the temporary name Bridge Gallery, with Making Frames, a slide exhibition of the Gluckman Mayner architecture firm's projects,  organized by Jeffrey Hoone, Executive Director of CMAC.
