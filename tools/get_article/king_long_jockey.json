Power of the King Long Jockey comes from either a 2.8 litre inline-four turbo diesel engine or a 2.3 litre inline-four turbo diesel engine.\nDevelopment\nIn 2014, Fujian Automobile Industry Group gained control of the King Long Group and the Sprinter body was made available to King Long, leading to the restyled and rebadged King Long Jockey with the designs heavily resembling the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans with identical body styles and overall vehicle dimensions. The King Long Jockey vans are among the various Chinese vans from domestic brands that chose to replicate the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter with only minor styling differences. Other brands include Higer and JAC.\nBadge engineered variants\nThe vehicle body of the King Long Jockey was shared across multiple companies including the related Higer Bus and other small manufacturers that specializes in light commercial vehicles due to company connections and shared toolings. A pure electric cargo van variant was produced by Changsha Meihua Automobile Manufacturing Co., Ltd. and sold as the Tongxin TX5040XXYBEV. Another variant was sold as the BAIC Changjiang BJ5040XXYCJ08EV by Changjiang EV. Yantai Shuchi (烟台舒驰) also produces electric cargo van variants based on the same vehicle body under the YTK5040XXYEV-series codename.\nFile:Changsha Meihua TX5040XXYBEV2 001.jpg|Changsha Meihua TX5040XXYBEV2 front\nFile:Changsha Meihua TX5040XXYBEV2 002.jpg|Changsha Meihua TX5040XXYBEV2 rear\nFile:BAIC Changjiang BJ5040XXYCJ08EV 001.jpg|BAIC Changjiang BJ5040XXYCJ08EV front\nFile:BAIC Changjiang BJ5040XXYCJ08EV 002.jpg|BAIC Changjiang BJ5040XXYCJ08EV rear\nFile:Yantai Shuchi electric van 001.jpg|Yantai Shuchi electric van front\nFile:Yantai Shuchi electric van 002.jpg|Yantai Shuchi electric van rear\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.higer.com Official website]"
