The Yemeni revolution was a series of major protests, political tensions, and armed clashes taking place in Yemen, which began in January 2011, influenced by concurrent protests in the region. Hundreds of protesters, members of armed groups, army soldiers and security personnel were killed, and many more injured, in the largest protests to take place in the South Arabian country for decades.\nThis section of the timeline includes the inception of the protest movement in January 2011 and its growth into a full-fledged uprising over the next several months, with the opposition occupying parts of the capital of Sana'a and Ta'izz in protest against the government of President Ali Abdullah Saleh and in solidarity with Egyptian protesters. By the end of May and the beginning of June, attempts by the regional Gulf Co-operation Council to mediate an end to the crisis had broken down, and tribal fighters clashed openly with government security forces in the streets of Sana'a, bringing the country to the brink of a civil war.\nTimeline\nJanuary\nMid-January\nThousands of Yemenis protested in Sana'a's streets since mid-January 2011 to demand a change in government, though the protests in the south of the country were more aggressive. The protests \"appeared to be the first large-scale challenge\" to Saleh's rule; protesters compared him to the ousted Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, citing government corruption and the poor economy of Yemen. Protests occurred in multiple towns in both the north and south of Yemen initially against Yemeni governmental proposals to modify Yemen's constitution, rejecting the proposals as insufficient, and over unemployment and economic conditions. Protests on 20 January included thousands of protestors in Ta'izz. Protests in Aden took place on 18, 19 and 20 January. In Aden, car tires were burned, roads were blocked and at least seven people – both soldiers and protestors, were injured. Protests in Sana'a appeared to be weakening . Two of the protests occurred at Sana'a University, with a slogan \"Leave before you are forced to leave\", which Reuters interpreted as a criticism of \"autocratic Arab leaders, including Saleh.\"\n27 January\nAt least 16,000 demonstrators took to the streets in Sana'a on 27 January, including at least 10,000 at Sana'a University.\nAfter the government announced intentions for political reforms, protesters rejected the proposals as not extensive enough to ensure Saleh or his son do not continue to rule indefinitely. Protesters appeared to be pushing for reform rather than a revolution unlike in Tunisia. A Yemeni journalist stated: \"These were not spontaneous or popular protests like in Egypt, but rather mass-rallies organised by the opposition who are using events in Tunisia to test Saleh's regime. This is only the start of a fierce political battle in the run-up to Yemen's parliamentary elections in April.\"\n29 January\nOn 29 January, protesters in Sana'a demanded the ouster of Saleh. They chanted \"Ali, leave leave\" and \"Tunisia left, Egypt after it and Yemen in the coming future\" before plainclothes police officers attacked the demonstration, though no casualties were reported. Tawakel Karman, a leading parliamentary member of the Al-Islah, said a security force personnel tried to attack her with a dagger and a shoe but protesters stopped him. She also said that \"We will continue until the fall of Ali Abdullah Saleh's regime. We have the Southern Movement in the south, the (Shia) Huthi rebels in the north, and parliamentary opposition [calling for political change].\"\nAt the end of the month, activist Belquis Al Lahabi noted that, initially, women led multiple protests and a number of the issues raised were on maternal mortality, child marriage, and the uneven burden of illiteracy and poverty on women – though by the end of the first month, women were beaten in the town square in Sana'a that they once led.\nFebruary\n3 February – \"Day of Rage\"\nKarman called for 3 February to be a \"Day of Rage.\" According to the Xinhua News Agency, organisers were calling for a million protesters to participate in the demonstration in Sana'a. The day before, the Interior Ministry stated that it was increasing security prior to the planned protests in order to prevent weapons from being introduced and \"suspects\" from entering major cities.\nAbout 20,000 people demonstrated in Sana'a. Prior to the anti-government demonstration, armed members of the General People's Congress set up tents and portraits of President Saleh in Al-Tahrir Square, the original anti-government protest venue, forcing a change of venue for the anti-government protestors. A protest in Aden was broken up by security services who reportedly fired tear gas and even live ammunition. Mohammed al-Sabri of the Common Forum called Saleh's attempt to halt protests \"unacceptable;\" though he also said that his group would \"discuss the president's announcement.\" Al Jazeera said Yemen had increased security the next day.\n11 February\nHuman Rights Watch said that demonstrators celebrating the ouster of Hosni Mubarak in Egypt turned violent when hundreds of men armed with knives, sticks, and assault rifles attacked the protesters.\n12 February\nBy noon, at least 4,000 protesters gathered to demonstrate in Sana'a, with numbers expected to rise.\nApproximately 5,000 police with clubs and government supporters beat the anti-government protesters who were celebrating the resignation of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and were also demanding the removal of Saleh. Protesters also tried to reach the Egyptian embassy in Sana'a, but police forces kept them back. The General People's Congress sent busloads of their members, equipped with food, water and tents, to Sana'a Square to prevent protesters from gathering there. Clashes then broke out between the groups after pro-Saleh protesters, armed with knives and sticks, forced about 300 anti-government protesters to end their protests. The Associated Press reported government troops as beating the anti-government protesters who were chanting \"After Mubarak, it's Ali's turn\" and \"A Yemeni revolution after the Egyptian revolution.\"\nThe Al-Iman University, which was supposed to have been associated with the Muslim Brotherhood faced calls from MPs for its closure.\n13 February\nAbout 2,000 protesters marched in Sana'a in the third day in a row of protests. The protesters chanted \"the Yemeni people want the fall of the regime\" and \"a Yemeni revolution after the Egyptian revolution.\" About 1,000 protesters then broke off to march to the presidential palace where police then blocked access to the palace and clashed with them.\nSaleh and an unnamed opposition group were preparing to start talks to avoid an \"Egypt-style\" revolt. Saleh also postponed a trip to the United States \"due to the current circumstances in the region.\"\n14 February\nSeveral thousand protesters, mostly university students, demanding Saleh resign and for political reform started at Sana'a University. Pro-government demonstrators then came to the university and attacked the other demonstrators, before the latter started to march ahead. Though police initially managed to keep a counter-demonstration apart from the anti-government protesters, violence was reported. Police also then pushed back the anti-government protesters using clubs. Reports suggested multiple injuries and twenty-three arrests. Protests that turned violent were also reported in Aden and other cities.\n15 February\nIn Sana'a, about 3,000 people protested against the President and were attacked by about 2000 government supporters and plain-clothes police with tasers.\n16 February\nAbout 500 people protested in Aden, calling to \"overthrow the regime\" and for President Saleh \"to leave\". Two were shot dead by police. In Sana'a, hundreds of students protesting against the President were attacked by supporters of the President armed with batons, stones and daggers. Judges continued a sit-in that started on 15 February calling for greater independence for the judiciary, for the members of the Supreme Judicial Council to be dismissed, and for higher salaries.\nVarious witnesses said the anti-government protesters had gathered at Sana'a University in the capital and clashed with loyalists armed with batons and daggers. At least four people were wounded in a similar confrontation on the 16th, as student demonstrators were trying to march from the university toward the city centre and threw rocks at their government attackers, as they continued marching from the university. One person was also killed during a clash between demonstrators and police in Aden.\n17 February\nAbout 2,000 protesters, both anti-government and pro-government wearing Yemeni flags as headbands and capes, faced off against each other on Sana's Al Rabat Street around noon. Stones and pieces of concrete were thrown and the anti-government and pro-government groups sometimes ran towards each other. Police arrived after over an hour of clashes and fired warning shots into the air until all protesters left the area.\nA group of influential clerics in Yemen have called for the formation of a national unity government that would see the opposition represented in key ministries, followed by elections in six months. They say the move would place Yemen in the same situation as Egypt and Tunisia, without suffering bloodshed.\nOn 17 February, in a seventh day of clashes, some supporters of the Yemeni government clashed with anti-government demonstrators calling for Saleh's ouster.\n18 February – \"Friday of Anger\"\nIn the largest demonstrations yet, tens of thousands of Yemenis took part in anti-government demonstrations in Sana'a, Taiz and Aden for a \"Friday of Fury\", as it was termed by protest organisers, with pro-government supporters also rallying in several cities. In the capital, Sana'a, the crowd marched towards the presidential palace, chanting anti-government slogans, despite riot police attempting to stop them from doing so. Three people have been killed in the demonstrations with one of the deaths happening after a hand grenade was thrown at anti-government protesters in Taiz. There were also reports of gunfire during a rally in Aden, where riots flared overnight, with protesters setting fire to a local government building and security forces killing one demonstrator.\n19 February\nSeveral anti-government protesters have been injured in clashes with supporters of Yemen's president, as both sides fired pistols and assault rifles, the first reported use of firearms by demonstrators. Five Saleh opponents were wounded by gunfire, three of them seriously, and three were wounded when demonstrators threw stones at each other outside the university. Around 1,000 anti-government demonstrators chanted \"Leave! Leave!\" and \"The people want the fall of the regime!\", and between 200 and 300 Saleh supporters called for dialogue.\nIn southern Yemen, where resentment of rule from Sana'a has run high, dozens of men used their cars in the town of Karish to block the main road between Taiz and Aden, shouting for \"the fall of the regime\". In Aden as many as 400 protesters staged a peaceful sit-in, holding banners saying: \"No to oppression. No to corruption\". The local council of Sheikh Othman, a directorate in Aden, said in a statement it resigned in protest at the use of live bullets by security forces against protesters which led to deaths and injuries in the city on Friday. In Sana'a, the editor of the defence ministry newspaper was wounded when he was beaten and stabbed by anti-government protesters.\n20 February\nProtests continued as students started a sit-in at Sana'a University. Tents were set up in front of Sana'a University's gate, while thousands of people also staged sit-ins in the cities of Ibb and Taiz. Some tribal representatives came from Arhab, Nahm, Anis (in Dhamar), Shabwah and Abyan to support the peaceful protests, engaging in traditional Yemeni dances with the students. Students from Al-Razi institute declared a sit-in as well.\n21 February\nOn 21 February, a teenager was killed and four people were wounded in a clash with soldiers in Yemen's southern port of Aden.\nIn a press conference, Saleh said that only defeat at the ballot box will make him quit, while the EU delegation to Yemen also issued a statement strongly condemning the use of violence against peaceful protesters and urging Saleh to respond to \"the legitimate aspirations of the Yemeni people\". Yemeni clerics declared that the use of force against protesters is prohibited, which they described as a \"crime,\" and calling for a ban on arbitrary arrest and torture. Amid the ongoing turmoil, authorities have detained, Hasan Baoum, a leader of the separatist Southern Movement.\n22 February\nAnti-government protesters in Yemen continued to demonstrate. A car belonging to Saleh's supporters in Sana'a was burnt. Thousands or protesters also rallied at Sana'a university, while hundreds continued to camp out in a nearby square. Protesters also set up checkpoints around the Sana'a square and searched those trying to enter. Pro-government protesters, armed with daggers and batons, clashed with students resulting in five injuries, before police intervened. The protests result in one death.\nIn Aden, 12 people were killed over the course of the previous week. Schools were also closed, most government employees were not working and a number of shops were closed as hundreds gathered to protest. Protesters in Ash Shihr chanted \"Down, down with Saleh.\" In Taiz, thousands of protesters marched in the Safir square. Hundreds have been camping in the square for at least a week, having renamed it \"Freedom Square.\" A spokesman for the opposition rebuffed Saleh's offer of dialogue and a group of Islamic leaders called for a national unity government that would lead the country to elections.\n23 February\nEight MPs of the ruling party resigned from the party in protest against the violence used by the government against the protesters.\nSaleh ordered security forces to protect protesters.\n24 February\nProtests were reported across the city, including in the southern secessionist stronghold where one anti-government protester was reported killed as a result of a landmine blast at an anti-government protest in Lawder.\nReports suggested Saleh had \"instructed all security services to thwart all clashes and prevent direct confrontation between pro- and anti-government protesters\".\n25 February – \"Day of Rage\"\nAs many as 180,000 people marched across the country in yet another \"day of rage.\" In Sana'about 30,000 anti-government protesters, ten times as many as had become \"normal,\" convened in front of Sana'a University.\nPolice opened fire on the protesters killing between four and eleven people and wounding forty-three.\n26 February\nMajor tribes in Yemen joined the anti-government protests, including the Hashid and Baqil tribes.\n27 February\nHundreds of thousands of Yemeni pro-democracy protesters took to the streets Sana'a demanding for Saleh steps down.\nSaleh also called for his army generals to \"defend the country.\" Various opposition parties said they are joining the young protesters to seek Saleh's removal.\n28 February\nAnti-government protesters increased in number. By the end of the day, Saleh said he would make a proposal for a national unity government even if the opposition parties reject his proposal he said that he would invite independent personalities that would then lay the groundwork for constitutional reforms. Having initially said that the protesters' demands could not be met through \"anarchy and killing\" he later invited opposition parties to form the new government. Mohammed Saleh al-Qubati, an opposition leader, rejected the effort saying Saleh should step down instead of offering outdated \"tranquilisers.\"\nMarch\n1 March\nTens of thousands of the anti-government protesters as well as members of opposition parties took to the streets of Sana'a again. At Sana'a University they chanted \"Leave\" to Saleh after having rejected his demand of a new government.\nThe head of the Council of Islamic Clerics and Yemen's Muslim Brotherhood Abdul-Majid al-Zindani joined the protesters. Previously he had been an ally of Saleh and called for end to protests.\nA senior member of the South Yemen Movement, Yassin Ahmad Saleh Qadish, stated that they wanted a referendum on secession (similar to the 2011 Southern Sudanese independence referendum) if protests succeeded in getting Saleh to step down, stating that \"sharing power and resources\" did not take place as promised for Yemeni unification.\n2 March\nProtests continued, largely centering on Sana'a University. Protesters have called for massive demonstrations on 4 March.\n3 March\nHouthi rebels in the north said that the Yemeni Air Force bombed a protest in Harf Sufyan, where thousands had gathered, killing four and injuring thirteen.\nThe opposition groups agreed on a transition plan which they would offer Saleh, which would foresee him leaving office by the end of 2011.\n4 March\nSaleh rejected the opposition's offer, as Yemeni cities saw the biggest anti-Saleh demonstrations yet, with one protest stretching over 2 kilometres in length. Yemeni soldiers fired rockets and artillery at anti-government protesters in the country's north, in Semla, a village in the 'Amran Governorate, killing at least two people and wounding around seven others, according to a statement issued by the Houthi rebels. According to Al Jazeera, local security forces dismissed the Houthi's account of events, saying armed tribesmen tried to enter one of the city's security checkpoints by force, after which \"clashes ensued, three tribesmen and four policemen were injured\"\nTribal sheikh Ali Ahmad al-Umrani, an ally of Saleh, resigned on this day.\n5 March\nTens of thousands continued with protests in several cities across Yemen, including Sana'a, Aden, Taiz and Hadramawt.

About one million people also staged a protest in southern Yemen, as forces loyal to Saleh's government have killed a boy and injured several others. There were also protests in several prisons that led to at least one death.\nArmy troops also stormed Sana'a University's campus resulting in ninety-eight injuries. The doctors who treated protesters claimed that what had initially been assumed to be tear gas, used by the military to disperse the protesters, might actually have been nerve gas.\n9 March\nOn 9 March, a supporter of the president was killed during clashes with anti-government protesters, in the southern province of Hadramawt while another person was injured.\n11 March – \"Friday of No Return\"\nA \"Friday of No Return\" protest was called after Friday prayers. Tens of thousands of people gathered in Sana'a calling for the ouster of President Saleh. Hundreds of thousands more protested in other cities throughout the country.\nDuring the night, Yemeni police surrounded protesters encamped in a square in Sana'a. Shortly before dawn the next day, they fired on protesters using tear gas and live ammunition. Three people were killed in Sana'a, while another was killed in Mukalla.\n12 March\nFor the second time in two days security forces fired live ammunition and lobbed tear gas grenades during protests in Change Square (University Square) outside Sana'a University on 13 March. Witnesses said at least ten people were injured.\n14 March\nOn 14 March, in the Ma'rib Governorate, a group of protesters stabbed Governor Naji al-Zaidi and four bodyguards with daggers.

Jamal al-Sharaabi, a thirty-five-year-old Yemeni photojournalist, was killed in the attack, marking the first journalist death of the protests.\nSniper fire was also reported. It has been reported that the attackers were pro-government gunmen, though Saleh said that his security forces did not open fire and were even unarmed at the time. There are also reports that some of the protesters who were injured in the attack were taken away in national security vehicles to a local prison for treatment instead of to a regular hospital, sparking fears that the injured will be further harassed. Tens of thousands of people also took to the streets in other cities across the country.\nSaleh declared a state of emergency across the country, while state media blamed the violence on \"clashes among citizens.\" The Common Forum, a coalition of the opposition parties led by Ali Mohammed al-Sabry, condemned the shootings.\nThe Washington Post reported that US President Barack Obama and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and French President Nicolas Sarkozy had condemned the attack.\n19 March\nOn 19 March, The Battle of Sa'dah began\n20 March\nOn 20 March, Sheikh Sadiq al-Ahmar, the leader of the Hashed, which includes Saleh's tribe, issued a statement asking the president to respond to the people's demands and leave peacefully. It was co-signed by several religious leaders.\nAmid a spate of defections and resignations from the army and the diplomatic corps, rival tanks and armoured vehicles from both sides of supporters within the military were deployed in Sana'a.\n22 March\nSaleh stated on 22 March that he would be willing to step down by the end of the year as part of a \"constitutional transfer of power,\" but the opposition rejected the offer out of hand.\nTwo soldiers were reportedly killed in fighting between defected and loyalist army units in Hadida.\nOn 22 March, President Saleh issued a statement saying that he considered the protests to be a \"coup\" and that a civil war would eventually ensue if protests continued.\n23 March\nOn 23 March, the parliament enacted a thirty-day emergency law which suspended the constitution, allowed media censorship, banned street protests and gave security forces far-reaching powers to arrest and detain suspects.\n24 March\nState-owned media reported that there was a massive gun battle between the army and Al Qaeda forces in the province of Abyan and Marib, with soldiers killing fifteen terrorists and arresting others. The government said that the terrorists killed three soldiers and wounded three others. Meanwhile, the army fought the Presidential guards in the town of Mukalla on Thursday with army units backing opposition groups, and around 10,000 protesters gathered in Sana'a, chanting slogans such as \"Go, go, you coward; you are an American agent.\"\nSaleh accepted the opposition's transition plan later on that day.\n25 March – \"FridaAA'Italic text' of Departure\"\nThe opposition has called on Friday to be a day of mass protests dubbed the \"Friday of Departure\" (or \"Day of Departure\"). Hundreds of thousands across Yemen showed up to protest against President Saleh, including in Sana'a. President Ali Abdullah Saleh announced at a public appearance in Sana'a, where \"tens of thousands\" government supporters gathered, that he would not step down but would seek dialogue with anti-government protesters and make concessions.\n26 March\nSaleh and top general Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar (who had sided with the rebels) continued talks about stepping down from their respective positions simultaneously, transferring power to a civilian-led transitional government. Tribal and military leaders and the U.S. Ambassador were also present. The talks broke down over the choice of those civilians. Reuters reported five suspected al-Qaeda militants were killed in Yemen when they attacked a security checkpoint in Lawdar in the South, and three others there the day before.\n27 March\nGeneral Al-Ahmar said that Saleh is trying to use the Al-Qaeda threat to stay in power. President Saleh warned of \"civil war\" that \"will result to tribes fighting each other and a split of Yemen into four separate parts\" in a threat similar to the one Saif al-Islam Gaddafi made to the Libyan people in February.\n28 March\nSome sources indicated on 28 March that a deal was still being worked out with Saleh, despite his assurances to the contrary at public appearances, and that the matter of discussion were the conditions regarding the activities of his sons and other relatives, especially whether they would be immune from prosecution; under the plan, Saleh would hand over power to the vice president (though not the current one, who has indicated he does not wish to have a role in the transitional government; a new one would be appointed before Saleh's resignation), and the new government would amend the constitution before organizing presidential and parliamentary elections.\nFollowing an ammunitions factory explosion in Khanfar, in southwestern Yemen, officials stated that the government had lost control of six out of eighteen of the country's provinces. Saba News Agency, an official Yemeni state media, also made reference to a \"caretaker government\".\n30 March\nHundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to protest against Saleh, and accused him of being responsible for the weapon factory explosion. Protesters threatened to storm the presidential palace this Friday if Saleh does not leave. Protesters call for a million man march in Sana'a on Friday, now dubbed \"Day of Liberation\".\nA coalition of opposition groups issued a statement saying they would not leave the square near Sana'a University until Saleh and his allies are removed from power. It called for a temporary presidential council of five experienced individuals of integrity who would run the country for six months, through an appointed technocrat that would form a caretaker government. It also called for the trial of corrupt officials, return of \"stolen public and private property\", release of political detainees, dissolving the state apparatus and the closing the information ministry – steps similar to those taken in Tunisia and Egypt. They also called for dialogue over the complaints of northern Shias and southerners who wish to secede.\n31 March\nHundreds of thousands of anti-government demonstrators again turned out in 'Change Square' in Sana'a. Meanwhile, tribe members opposed to the president attacked electricity installations in the Ma'rib Governorate, setting off power outages in parts of the capital, as well as in Aden and Hudaydah.\nApril\n1 April – \"Friday of Enough\"/\"Friday of Brotherhood\"\nAnti-Saleh protesters named the day a \"Friday of enough\", while loyalists branded it a \"Friday of brotherhood\". Thousands of pro-democracy protesters converged on Change Square in Sana'a, with some of them setting up tents and hanging posters of young men recently killed in demonstrations. The opposition movement told Al Jazeera that they had hundreds of thousands of people, in over fifteen provinces in Yemen, including tens of thousands in Sana'a, the largest turnout seen there so far. Meanwhile, state television showed thousands of people near the presidential palace, displaying support for the country's leader. Saleh addressed the crowd, pledging to \"sacrifice\" himself for the people.\n2 April\nIn Sana'a, Saleh thanked thousands of supporters gathered near the presidential palace for backing the constitution. In the Aden Governorate, thousands of protesters clashed with anti-riot police backed by tanks. Protesters called for a general strike and residents responded by skipping work, resulting in a shut down of public transport while many closed shops. In Hudaydah, seven protesters were wounded by riot police, as they used batons and tear gas to disperse them.\nThe opposition also proposed a transition plan that mandated the country's president to hand power to his vice-president Abd al-Rab Mansur al-Hadi. Part of his interim duties would have been to reorganise the country's security apparatus and the Republican Guard, currently controlled by Saleh's family.\n3 April\nPolice used tear gas to disperse pro-democracy protesters in Taiz's main square, resulting in over 600 injuries.\n4 April\nThousands marched through Taiz toward Freedom Square, where demonstrators have been camped out, but were blocked when passing in front of governor's headquarters by security forces stationed there. Clashes broke out, with some protesters throwing stones, and troops on nearby rooftops opening fire with live ammunition, killing 12 demonstrators and wounding 30. Protests were also held in Mukalla, as well as in Hudaydah, where a protesters' march was blocked and they were fired upon with tear gas and live ammunition by security forces, as they tried to march on a local presidential palace.\n5 April\nThe US called for Saleh to step down after Yemeni security forces killed at least seventeen people south of Sana'a, though it did not stop military aid for counterterrorism activities.\n6 April\nOn 6 April, thousands of people again took to the streets. In Khormaksar, Aden governorate, hundreds of students set up road blocks, demanding the release of people detained earlier in the day and calling for officials to be triad for massacres against protestors in Sana'a and Taiz. Security forces opened fire and shot tear gas in an attempt to disperse them.\n8 April\nHundreds of thousands protested against Saleh across Yemen, with tens of thousands in Sana'a's Change Square alone, but thousands also staged a pro-Saleh rally. The president made an address rejecting the GCC's offer for a plan to let Saleh step down.\n9 April\nSecurity forces shot and wounded thirty people in Sana'a, while eighty others suffered injuries from beatings with batons.\n10 April\nAccording to doctors, one person was killed and up to 500 people were injured after security forces used live fire on dozens of demonstrators in overnight clashes in Sana'a and Taiz. A mass march to the United Nations building in Yemen's capital was cancelled due to fears of reprisals.\n13 April\nFive people were killed in Sana'a as forces loyal to a defected army general and pro-government fighters clashed, while two more people were killed in Aden in clashes between security forces and anti-regime demonstrators. Later on the same day, approximately 10,000 soldiers from the republican guard defected and joined Ali Mohsen's command.\n15 April\nHundreds of thousands held anti-regime protests after Friday prayers in Sana'a, while others protested in Aden, Taiz and the Hadramawt Governorate. Meanwhile, thousands of supporters gathered near the presidential office, where Ali Abdullah Saleh called on the opposition, whom he also called liars and \"bandits\", to join talks to ensure stability, warned of a possible civil war and break-up of the country.\n16 April\nThousands of women protested in Sana'a, Taiz and other cities against remarks made a day earlier by Ali Abdullah Saleh that it is un-Islamic for women to join men in demonstrations. In Aden, armed men tried to storm a police station and then battled with security forces for half an hour before being driven back by rooftop sniper fire.\n17 April\nHundreds of thousands of people protested in the streets in Sana'a and as well as in Taiz, Ibb and Hudaydah. Pro-government forces opened fire at an anti-government march in the capital, wounding at least four people, as some tried to march outside the usual protest zone.\n18 April\nDefectors of the ruling party founded the Justice and Development Bloc on 18 April.\n22 April\nProtesters held another large Friday rally, and this time managed to occupy change square. Nearby, Saleh staged a rally in support for him where he encouraged the GCC's plan, while protesters do not believe the GCC's plan is appropriate.\n23 April\nSaleh announced he had accepted the GCC's plan. The proposal included his stepping down and shifting control to his deputy after 30 days.  The agreement included immunity for him and his family and further required the opposition to stop public protests and join a coalition with Saleh's ruling party.  The opposition, led by Yassin Saeed Noman, accepted the spirit of the agreement but rejected the conditions, citing a preference to allow Saleh's party to finish its term and acknowledging a lack of power to stop protests.  The agreement came under heavy pressure internationally.  Reactions to Saleh's acceptance have been reserved, without the agreement formalized or accepted by both sides and with the possibility of the stand-off continuing.\n25 April\nThe opposition decided to agree to the GCC-brokered deal, confirming they would consider joining a national unity government. Opposition leaders reportedly received assurances from the US that Saleh would hold up his end of the bargain and leave power at the end of the thirty-day period after the deal goes into effect.\n26 April\nProtests continued despite the announcement of a deal between Saleh and the opposition.

On the island of Socotra, hundreds of women demonstrated to call for Saleh's resignation.\n17 May\nAs demonstrations across Yemen continued, the opposition said it sticks to the original GCC plan and nothing else, after the GCC suggested altering the deal in Saleh's favor to get him to step down.

Heavy street fighting ensued, which included artillery and mortar shelling, in which, by 26 May, around 120 people were killed, including loyalist and defected soldiers, tribal militiamen and civilians.

People on the ground were reporting that it looked like the situation was deteriorating into a civil war.\nLeaked documents show that the Saleh and the defense ministry have intentionally prepared to start a civil war in Yemen, and are trying to build up brigades to fight against citizens.\nBattle of Zinjibar\nAs the situation in Sana'a was developing, about 300 Islamic militants attacked and captured the coastal city of Zinjibar (population 20,000).

The military clashed with the alleged Islamist fighters outside the city and shelled the outskirts of the town. By late on 29 May, the militants still had full control of the city. 21 soldiers five militants and eight civilians were reported to had been killed in the fighting by 31 May. Some opposition figures and activists charged that President Saleh allowed the capture of Zinjibar by the supposed Islamists to support his claims that the country would not be able to survive without him.\nBy 31 May, the ceasefire had broken down and street fighting continued in Sana'a.
