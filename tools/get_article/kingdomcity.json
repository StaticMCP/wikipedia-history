Originally based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, before it expanded to Perth in Western Australia, Kingdomcity now also has locations in Africa, Europe, and many other nations in Asia. It was founded by Mark Varughese.\nHistory\nIn 2006, Mark Varughese claimed to have a profound \"burning-bush experience\" which led to his move from Perth, Western Australia, to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to plant a church.\nAfter two and a half years in Malaysia, he received an invitation to return to Perth to pastor Lakes church concurrently taking over from pastor Neil Smith. This move led to the birth of Kingdomcity – with both congregations unified under one name. In their opinion this was a declaration of their mandate, and a representation of the responsibility of every believer, to bring God's kingdom to every city.\nFollowing the unification of the Malaysian and Australian congregations, Kingdomcity embarked on a period of rapid international growth, primarily within the Asia Pacific and African regions. Beginning in 2014, the church expanded to Cambodia, followed by Singapore in 2015. The expansion continued into Africa with a presence in Botswana in 2016 and Zambia in 2019. The church also established locations in the Middle East (Dubai, 2017), Europe (London, 2018), and other Asian nations, including Indonesia (Bali and Surabaya, 2019) and Sri Lanka (2019). By 2021, the movement reported a weekly attendance of 30,000 people across its various locations and launched its first church in New Zealand (Auckland). A digital expansion also occurred in 2020 with the launch of the global Online Campus, allowing it to reach hundreds of cities worldwide.\nIn addition to its multi-site church growth, Kingdomcity diversified its ministry to include several related organizations. The church founded Kingdomcity Communications Ltd, a media-based communications company that produces digital content, including the church's original music and an accelerated discipleship program called Greenhouse. Furthermore, in 2023, Senior Associate Leader Jemima Varughese pioneered and launched the Kingdomcity School, an international Christian-based online school offering an accredited curriculum for students from years K-12 globally.\nMusic\nKingdomcity's Band produces contemporary Christian praise and worship.
