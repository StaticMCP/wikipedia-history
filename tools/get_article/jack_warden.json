He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for Shampoo (1975) and Heaven Can Wait (1978). He received a BAFTA nomination for Shampoo, and won a Primetime Emmy Award for his performance in ''Brian's Song (1971).\nEarly life\nWarden was born in Newark, New Jersey, the son of Laura M. (née'' Costello) and John Warden Lebzelter, who was an engineer and technician.\nHe was of Pennsylvania Dutch (German) and Irish ancestry. Raised in Louisville, Kentucky, he was expelled from high school for fighting and eventually fought as a professional boxer under the name Johnny Costello. He fought in 13 bouts as a welterweight, but earned little money.\nMilitary service\nWarden worked as a nightclub bouncer, tugboat deckhand, and lifeguard, before joining the United States Navy in 1938. He was stationed for three years in China with the Yangtze Patrol.\nWarden joined the United States Merchant Marine in 1941, but he quickly tired of the long convoy runs.\nIn 1942, Warden moved to the United States Army, where he served as a paratrooper in the 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment, with the 101st Airborne Division in World War II.\nIn 1944, on the eve of the D-Day invasion (in which many of his friends died), Warden, then a staff sergeant, shattered his leg when he landed in a tree during a night-time practice jump in England. He spent almost eight months in the hospital recuperating, during which time he read a Clifford Odets play and decided to become an actor. Notably, Warden later portrayed a paratrooper from the 101st's rivals—the 82nd Airborne Division—in That Kind of Woman.\nAfter leaving the army, Warden moved to New York City and studied acting on the G.I. Bill.\nCareer\nas Det. Johnny Corso in ABC's N.Y.P.D. (1968)]]\nWarden joined the company of the Theatre '47 of Dallas and moved there and performed on stage there for five years. In 1948, he made his television debut on the anthology series The Philco Television Playhouse and also appeared on the series Studio One. His first film roles were uncredited bit parts in the 1950 films The Asphalt Jungle and Sunset Boulevard, and he was also in the 1951 film ''You're in the Navy Now, which also featured the screen debuts of Lee Marvin and Charles Bronson.\nWarden appeared in his first credited film role in 1951 in The Man with My Face.\nFrom 1952 to 1955, Warden appeared in the television series Mister Peepers with Wally Cox. In 1953, he was cast as a sympathetic corporal in From Here to Eternity''. Warden's breakthrough film role was Juror No. 7, a salesman who wants a quick decision in a murder case, in 12 Angry Men.\nWarden guest-starred in many television series over the years, such as Marilyn Maxwell's ABC drama series, Bus Stop, and on David Janssen's ABC drama, The Fugitive. He received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his performance as Chicago Bears coach George Halas in the television movie, ''Brian's Song, and was twice nominated for his starring role in the 1980s comedy/drama series Crazy Like a Fox.\nWarden was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor twice: for his performances in Shampoo and Heaven Can Wait. He also had notable roles in Bye Bye Braverman, The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing, All the President's Men, The White Buffalo, ...And Justice for All, Being There, Used Cars (in which he played dual roles), The Verdict, Problem Child and its sequel, as well as While You Were Sleeping, Guilty as Sin and the Norm Macdonald comedy Dirty Work. His final film was The Replacements'' in 2000, opposite Gene Hackman and Keanu Reeves.\nPersonal life\nWarden married French actress Vanda Dupre on October 10, 1958. They had one son, Christopher. Although they separated in the late 1970s, the couple never legally divorced.\nWarden's health declined in his later years, which resulted in his retirement from acting in 2000. He lived for the rest of his life in Manhattan, New York City, with his girlfriend, Marucha Hinds.\nDeath\nWarden died of heart and kidney failure in a New York City hospital on July 19, 2006, at the age of 85.\nFilmography\nFilm\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
