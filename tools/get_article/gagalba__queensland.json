When suburban development is complete, Gagalba will have approximately 6,000 homes with a secondary school and two primary schools.\nHistory\nGagalba is situated in the Gubbi Gubbi (Kabi) traditional Aboriginal country. The name Gagalba means shining place in the Gubbi Gubbi and Butchulla (Badtjala) languages.\nOn 14 June 2019, parts of the localities of Bells Creek and Meridan Plains were excised to create the localities of Banya, Corbould Park, Gagalba and Nirimba to accommodate future suburban growth in the Caloundra South Priority Development Area.\nDemographics\nThe population of Gagalba was not separately reported in the 2021 Australian census. It was included in the 2021 census data for its neighbouring locality Bells Creek.\nEducation\nAs at 2025, there are no schools in Gagalba. The nearest government primary schools are Nirimba State Primary School in Nirimba to the north and Landsborough State School in Landsborough to the north-west. The nearest government secondary school is Baringa State Secondary College in Baringa to the north.\nReferences"
