The IDA uses NASA Docking System (NDS) hardware. An IDA was permanently installed on each of the International Space Station's (ISS) two open Pressurized Mating Adapters (PMAs), both of which are connected to the Harmony module.\nHistory\nPrior to IDA several different docking adapters were designed to fill a similar role but were never implemented.\nAPAS to LIDS Adaptor System\nThe APAS to LIDS Adaptor System (ATLAS) was announced in 2008. It would have been placed on the open PMAs and converted APAS-95 to the Low Impact Docking System (LIDS). ATLAS was planned to be launched on Orion's first two missions to the International Space Station. Orion's missions to the ISS were later canceled altogether and its role as a crew transporter was replaced by the Commercial Crew Program.\nCommon Docking Adapter\nThe Common Docking Adapter (CDA) was announced in 2009. It was planned to be used to convert the Common Berthing Mechanism to the NASA Docking System. The CDAs would have been attached directly to Node-2 forward and Node-2 zenith. They would have been delivered on the Japanese HTV cargo spacecraft.\nDesign\nIDA converts APAS-95 to the NASA Docking System (which complies with the International Docking System Standard) and allows the transfer of crew, cargo, power and data. IDA has a mass of , a height of  and a width of . When including the docking targets, laser retro-reflectors and related systems that are arrayed around the outer perimeters, the outer diameter is about .\nBoeing is the primary contractor for the IDAs and the adapters were assembled at their Houston Product Support Center. Parts from subcontractors came from 25 American states and the primary structure is from Russian company RSC Energia.\nDeployment of IDA modules\nEach IDA was delivered as unpressurized cargo in the trunk of a SpaceX Dragon 1. When each IDA arrived, Dextre removed it from Dragon's trunk and moved it to about  from the front of the PMA. It then moved the IDA carefully into position until it was seated on the PMA and held it there. Astronauts during an Extravehicular activity then completed the electrical connections and permanently connect it to the PMA.\nIDA-1 was planned to be attached to Node-2's forward PMA. IDA-2 was originally planned to be attached to Node-2's zenith PMA. But following the loss of IDA-1, IDA-2 was instead attached to Node-2's forward PMA (PMA-2). IDA-3, a replacement for IDA-1, is installed at Node-2's zenith PMA (PMA-3).\nIDA-1\nIn February 2015, IDA-1 had been transported to the Kennedy Space Center while IDA-2 was still at Boeing's Houston facility. The systems and targets for IDA-1 were put through about a month of tests at the Space Station Processing Facility before being loaded for launch.\nIDA-1 was lost during the launch failure of SpaceX CRS-7 on 28 June 2015.\nIDA-2\nIDA-2 was launched on SpaceX CRS-9 on 18 July 2016. It was attached and connected to PMA-2 during a spacewalk on 19 August 2016. First docking was achieved with the arrival of Crew Dragon Demo-1 on 3 March 2019.\nIDA-3\nIDA-3 was launched on the SpaceX CRS-18 mission in July 2019. IDA-3 is constructed mostly from spare parts to speed construction. It was attached and connected to PMA-3 during a spacewalk on 21 August 2019. First docking was achieved with the arrival of SpaceX CRS-21 on 7 December 2020.\nGallery\nFile:IDA attached to PMA.png|Rendering of IDA connected to the PMA-2\nFile:IDA former planned locations on ISS.png|Pre-IDA-1 loss, planned locations of the IDAs\nFile:IDA planned locations on ISS.png|Post-IDA-1 loss, current locations of the IDAs\nFile:Iss072e143839 (Nov 3, 2024) --- The unoccupied space-facing port on the International Space Station's Harmony module is pictured several hours before the SpaceX Dragon Freedom spacecraft would relocate there after und.jpg|IDA-3 (white) attached to the top of PMA-3 (black), which is attached to the zenith berth of the Harmony module\nReferences"
