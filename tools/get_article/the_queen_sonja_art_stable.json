Originally,  the stables could house 38 horses, but the compound was considerably  expanded and improved during the reign of King Haakon VII, and his equestrian wife Queen Maud. Between 1905 and 1911, the stables were built into an equestrian facility with a riding hall, blacksmith and a veterinary area. Architect Hjalmar Welhaven led the expansion project while Queen Maud took the initiative to model the improved stable hall after the Royal Mews in London.\nRenovations and current use\nHorses have not been kept in the stables since 1940 and after the end of the German occupation of Norway during the Second World War the building was mostly used as a storage facility and garage. King Harald decided to renovate the building as a present to his wife Queen Sonja on her 80th birthday celebration in 2017. The renovations were made with the combined efforts of Statsbygg, Riksantikvaren and Snøhetta.\nThe Art Stable will be open from March through December each year and function as a venue for exhibitions of art well as presentations on historical and cultural items from the Norwegian Royal Collections.\nExhibitions. 2017-\n* \"Opening exhibition\" an extensive collection of graphic prints gifted by Norwegian artists.\n* “The Royal Stable.
