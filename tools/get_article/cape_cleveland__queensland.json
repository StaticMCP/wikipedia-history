Around Cape Ferguson at the end of Cape Cleveland Road is a  land parcel which is the headquarters of the Australian Institute of Marine Science(), where research into tropical marine science is undertaken.\nHistory\nThe area takes its name from the headland Cape Cleveland, named by Captain Cook on his first voyage to the Pacific in 1770. Cook gave no reason for the name, but it is possible it was in honour of John Clevland, a former Secretary to the British Admiralty. Cook's original choice of name was \"Iron Head\", but this was crossed and replaced in a revision of his log shortly after leaving the cape.\nDemographics\nIn the , Cape Cleveland had a population of 124 people.\nIn the , Cape Cleveland had a population of 155 people.\nIn the , Cape Cleveland had a population of 128 people.\nHeritage listings\nCape Cleveland has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* Cape Cleveland Lighthouse, Cape Cleveland ()\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Cape Cleveland.
