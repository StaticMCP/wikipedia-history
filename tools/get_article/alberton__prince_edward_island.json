It is situated in the western part of the county in the township of Lot 5.\nAlberton is a service centre for local fishing and farming communities, and is adjacent to the community and harbour of Northport.\nHistory\nThe area was long settled by the Mi'kmaq Nation. Europeans first ventured to the area in 1534 when French explorer Jacques Cartier recorded making landfall at nearby Cape Kildare during his journey of discovery in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and St. Lawrence River. Acadians settled on the island in small numbers through the 17th and 18th centuries but only moved in greater numbers to the western part of Ile-Saint-Jean and specifically north of present-day Alberton to the Tignish area following their expulsion by British military forces in the late 1750s.\nFollowing British victory over France, the island's sovereignty passed to Britain in 1763.  In 1765, Captain Samuel Holland surveyed the island and the British government instituted a feudal system of land ownership. The township of Lot 5, which contains present-day Alberton, was granted to Edward Lewis, a British Member of Parliament in the 1767 land lottery.\nNorthport, located near present-day Alberton began to be settled in the 1780s after Lewis made plans for a small trading town called \"Lewis Town\". Located at Bury Head in Northport, it was established in June 1788 and was first populated by local Acadians who had escaped expulsion three decades before British settlements. Scottish and Devonshire settlers were brought in by Lewis to settle his township.\nA local shipbuilding industry and lumber trade at Northport brought prosperity to the area throughout the 1800s, although this went into decline as more forested areas were lost to agriculture, on account of the excellent soils in the area.\nAlberton started to take shape in the 1840s and underwent several name changes including Cross Roads, The Cross, and Stump Town. The nearby shipbuilding, lumber and shipping industries had resulted in developing a sustainable community which was a major trade centre in western Prince County. In 1862, it was named in honour of Albert Edward, the Prince of Wales, who later became King Edward VII and who had visited Prince Edward Island in 1860. The community was named Alberton on 27 June 1862.\nRailways and other constructions\nIn 1872, the Prince Edward Island Railway was constructed, making the port at Northport, adjacent to Alberton, its western terminus. It connected Alberton with communities to the east such as O'Leary, Summerside, Charlottetown, Georgetown and Souris.\nThe western terminus was subsequently extended further from Alberton to Tignish in a sharp diversion just east of the Alberton passenger station, where a wye was constructed and a small railway yard, leading to the spur to Northport.  Alberton went into its own terminus during this period, with various mills, manufacturing businesses, stores and services.  The community became a village in 1878, and became home to a court house and justice centre for western Prince County that year.\nAlberton became the centre of the worldwide silver fox industry when Charles Dalton and Robert Oulton began farming the fur-bearing animals on an island in the harbour at Northport in 1894, bringing tremendous prosperity to area residents and business owners. Despite a fire that devastated part of the town the following year, Alberton quickly reflected its growing economic importance of the village. The railway constructed a new passenger station designed by architect Charles Benjamin Chappell for Alberton in the early 1900s entirely out of stone, one of only two such stations on the island (the other being in Kensington).\nThe fox farming industry brought increased growth in the population and tax base for the community, which resulted in an upgrade from village status, becoming an incorporated town in May 1913. Silver fox farming remained profitable through the 1940s. Many distinctive houses in the community are a reminder of the fortunes that were made during this period.\nThe Western Hospital was constructed in 1945 and was the first hospital built west of Summerside. The public library opened in 1951, followed by the federal government building in 1962 and the Jacques Cartier Arena and a community museum in 1964. The original Maplewood Manor nursing home operated from 1967 to 2011, and was replaced by the new Maplewood Manor nursing home, in the autumn of 2011.\nGeography\nAlberton is roughly halfway between Tignish and O'Leary, and is situated along the north shore of the island, fronting the open Gulf of St. Lawrence.  It has a land area of approximately .\n*90&nbsp;km : Confederation Bridge (to New Brunswick)\n* 120&nbsp;km : Charlottetown\n* 66&nbsp;km : Summerside\n*176&nbsp;km : Wood Islands ferry (to Nova Scotia)\nClimate\nAlberton experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb) similar to that of coastal Hokkaido, being somewhat less extreme due to the island condition and being surrounded by the Gulf of St Lawrence. The amount of rain recorded on a single day was 102&nbsp;mm on 5 August 1989 and the daily record of snowfall was 56.1&nbsp;cm on 15 December 2003. Although the odors associated with fishing and shipping, according to one 2008 report air quality agrees the criteria of regulatory projects of the same.\n, 1981–2010 normals, extremes 1969-present\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 13.2\n|Feb record high C = 14.5\n|Mar record high C = 15.6\n|Apr record high C = 22.5\n|May record high C = 32.8\n|Jun record high C = 33.2\n|Jul record high C = 33.0\n|Aug record high C = 33.3\n|Sep record high C = 33.2\n|Oct record high C = 25.5\n|Nov record high C = 21.0\n|Dec record high C = 14.0\n|Jan high C = -3.9\n|Feb high C = -3.2\n|Mar high C = 0.7\n|Apr high C = 6.1\n|May high C = 13.3\n|Jun high C = 19.1\n|Jul high C = 23.2\n|Aug high C = 23.1\n|Sep high C = 18.7\n|Oct high C = 12.2\n|Nov high C = 5.7\n|Dec high C = -0.0\n|year high C = 9.6\n|Jan mean C= −8.2\n|Feb mean C= −7.7\n|Mar mean C= -3.3\n|Apr mean C= 2.4\n|May mean C= 8.7\n|Jun mean C= 14.5\n|Jul mean C= 18.7\n|Aug mean C= 18.6\n|Sep mean C= 14.4\n|Oct mean C= 8.4\n|Nov mean C= 2.6\n|Dec mean C= -3.5\n|year mean C= 5.5\n|Jan low C = -12.5\n|Feb low C = -12.1\n|Mar low C = -7.3\n|Apr low C = -1.4\n|May low C = 4.1\n|Jun low C = 9.8\n|Jul low C = 14.1\n|Aug low C = 14.0\n|Sep low C = 10.0\n|Oct low C = 4.4\n|Nov low C = -0.5\n|Dec low C = -7.0\n|year low C = 1.3\n|Jan record low C = -31.7\n|Feb record low C = -33.0\n|Mar record low C = -26.0\n|Apr record low C = -15.0\n|May record low C = -7.2\n|Jun record low C = -1.7\n|Jul record low C = 3.0\n|Aug record low C = 1.5\n|Sep record low C = -3.3\n|Oct record low C = -6.7\n|Nov record low C = -16.7\n|Dec record low C = -26.1\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 96.4\n|Feb precipitation mm = 74.5\n|Mar precipitation mm = 80.9\n|Apr precipitation mm = 80.1\n|May precipitation mm = 92.7\n|Jun precipitation mm = 82.1\n|Jul precipitation mm = 86.3\n|Aug precipitation mm = 79.7\n|Sep precipitation mm = 91.6\n|Oct precipitation mm = 96.1\n|Nov precipitation mm = 99.1\n|Dec precipitation mm = 93.7\n|year precipitation mm = 1053.1\n|snow colour =\n|Jan snow cm = 73.6\n|Feb snow cm = 56.0\n|Mar snow cm = 48.3\n|Apr snow cm = 21.8\n|May snow cm = 1.8\n|Jun snow cm = 0.0\n|Jul snow cm = 0.0\n|Aug snow cm = 0.0\n|Sep snow cm = 0.0\n|Oct snow cm = 0.1\n|Nov snow cm = 14.8\n|Dec snow cm = 50.8\n|year snow cm =\n| rain colour  = green\n| Jan rain mm  =22.8\n| Feb rain mm  =18.4\n| Mar rain mm  =32.6\n| Apr rain mm  =58.3\n| May rain mm  =90.8\n| Jun rain mm  =82.1\n| Jul rain mm  =86.3\n| Aug rain mm  =79.7\n| Sep rain mm  =91.6\n| Oct rain mm  =96.1\n| Nov rain mm  =84.3\n| Dec rain mm  =42.9\n| unit precipitation days = 0.2 mm\n| Jan precipitation days  =12.8\n| Feb precipitation days  =10.2\n| Mar precipitation days  =11.5\n| Apr precipitation days  =12.7\n| May precipitation days  =13.3\n| Jun precipitation days  =11.9\n| Jul precipitation days  =11.2\n| Aug precipitation days  =11.4\n| Sep precipitation days  =11.3\n| Oct precipitation days  =12.6\n| Nov precipitation days  =14.5\n| Dec precipitation days  =14.0\n| unit snow days = 0.2 mm\n| Jan snow days  =10.6\n| Feb snow days  =8.2\n| Mar snow days  =7.7\n| Apr snow days  =3.7\n| May snow days  =0.36\n| Jun snow days  =0\n| Jul snow days  =0\n| Aug snow days  =0\n| Sep snow days  =0\n| Oct snow days  =0.08\n| Nov snow days  =3.3\n| Dec snow days  =9.2\n|source 1 =Environment Canada\n|date=August 2010\n}}\nDemographics\n}}\nIn the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Alberton had a population of  living in  of its  total private dwellings, a change of |1145|1}} from its 2016 population of .
