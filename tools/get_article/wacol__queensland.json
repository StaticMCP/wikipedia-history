In the , Wacol had a population of 4,253 people.\nGeography\nWacol is bounded to the west by the Brisbane River and to the north loosely by Wolston Creek. It is  south-west of the Brisbane central business district.\nThe Brisbane-Ipswich railway line enters the suburb from the north-east (Darra), via Wacol railway station in the centre of the locality () and Gailes railway station in the south-west of the locality (), before exiting to the south-west (Goodna / Gailes).\nThe suburb includes the undeveloped Cockatoo Island () in the Brisbane River.\nTermination Hill is a  peak in the south of the suburb ().\nHistory\nTermination Hill was named by explorer John Oxley at the termination point of his first voyage up the Brisbane River in December 1823.\nWolston House was opened in 1852.  Still intact today the building is the only surviving early Brisbane River settlement. The building was planned to be demolished however the National Trust of Queensland intervened to save the building. Major conservation work was undertaken.\nThe Wolston railway station was opened on 8 October 1874, taking its name from Wolston House. However, the name caused confusion with the Wilston railway station, so it was renamed on 8 July 1927 to Wacol railway station. Wacol is a coined word from weigh coal, as the principal purpose of the station was coal handling. The suburb takes its name from its railway station.\nA portion of Wacol comes from the Wolston Estate, consisting of 54 farms on an area of 3000 acres, offered for auction at Centennial Hall, Brisbane, on 16 October 1901. Wolston Estate is the property of M. B. Goggs, whose father obtained the land forty years previously in the 1860s and after whom Goggs Road is named. Only three of the farms sold at the original auction.\nIn 1879, the local government area of Yeerongpilly Division was created. In 1891, parts of Yeerongpilly Division were excised to create Sherwood Division becoming a Shire in 1903 which contained the area of Wolston Estate. In 1925, the Shire of Sherwood was amalgamated into the City of Brisbane.\nThe suburb played host to the American military during World War II, who constructed Camp Columbia () in 1942; after the war, control of the facility was transferred to the Australian Government which used it as a migrant reception and training centre from 1949 to 1987. Associated with the migrant centre was the Wacol East State School, which opened on 14 November 1949 as a \"Special School for New Australians\" and closed on 11 April 1963.\nCarole Park State School opened on 17 September 1948.\nAlso, in the post-war period, the suburb increasingly became home to correctional and mental health facilities.\nHM Prison Wacol opened in 1957 with a special wing for the Wacol Security Patients' Hospital (for the mentally ill). In 1988 it was renamed Wacol Correctional Centre, then in 1996 Moreton Correctional Centre. In 1999 it was closed and rebuilt as the Wolston Correctional Centre.\nIn 1984, the Sir Leslie Wilson Youth Centre (a secure facility for young offenders and \"troubled\" children, formerly known as the Wilson Youth Hospital) and its associated Sir Leslie Wilson School relocated from Windsor to Wacol. In 1994 it was renamed the Sir Leslie Wilson Youth Detention Centre in 1994.\nBarrett Adolescent Centre Special School opened on 29 January 1985. It provided education for children with mental health issues. It closed as a full-time school in 2013, but was relocated to Tennyson where it provides part-time support to children with mental health issues but who remain enrolled full-time in other schools.\nThe John Oxley Youth Detention Centre opened at 139 Wacol Road in 1987. On 15 July 1994 John Oxley School opened to provide education to children held in the John Oxley centre.\nMore correctional facilities followed with Sir David Longland Correctional Centre opening at 234 Wacol Station Road in 1988. In 1990 the former migrant reception centre site was cleared for the construction of the Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre in 1992. The Wolston Correctional Centre and the Brisbane Women's Correctional Centre both opened in 1999. The Brisbane Youth Detention Centre opened in January 2001 as an amgalmation of Sir Leslie Wilson and John Oxley facilities. In 2007 the Brisbane Correctional Centre opened as a redevelopment of the Sir David Longland facility.\nIn December 2011, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals moved from their premises in Fairfield to Wacol.\nDemographics\nIn the , Wacol had a population of 2,957 people.\nIn the , Wacol recorded a population of 3,761 people; 18.9% female and 81.1% male.
