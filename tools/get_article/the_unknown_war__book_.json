It describes the events of the war between Tsardom of Russia and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1654-67. The war has become known as a part of the \"Deluge\", a series of military conflicts that overwhelmed the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the middle of the 17th century which included the Khmelnytsky Uprising, the Swedish invasion, and the Russian invasion among others.\nImportance\nThe book became one of the first in-depth researches of military actions during the Russo-Polish War (1654–67) which took place in the lands of the modern-day Belarus. The topic of armed conflicts between Russia and historical predecessors of the former Soviet Republics was largely forbidden in the times of the Soviet Union (this explains the book title). The book was released in 1995, four years after disintegration of the ex-USSR.\nThe Unknown War focuses on war events in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, one of two integral parts of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (often generalized under the name of Poland). The dominant portion of lands that made up the Grand Duchy in the 17th century are today united in the Republic of Belarus, and hence, create a subject of historic analysis for Belarusian historians like Hienadz Sahanovich.\nThe book describes the following historical figures among others:\n* Janusz Radziwill, Great Hetman of Lithuania\n* Boguslaw Radziwill, Governor of the Duchy of Prussia\n* Pawel Jan Sapieha, Great Hetman of Lithuania\n* Tsar Alexis of Russia\n* John II Casimir Vasa, King of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth\n* George II Rakoczi, Prince of Transylvania\n* Magnus De la Gardie, Swedish governor of occupied territories\n* Philip Abukhovich, Voivode of Smolensk\n* Denis Murashka, commander of Belarusian (Lithuanian) guerrillas\n* Wincenty Gosiewski, Field Hetman of Lithuania\n* Ivan Khovansky, duke and voivode in the Russian army\n* Alexei Trubeskoy, duke and voivode in the Russian army\nControversy\nThe book is sometimes criticized for putting excessive blame for casualties among the population of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania on hostilities committed by the Russian army (which operated in alliance with the Ukrainian Cossacks for the most time of the war). For example, the book says that population loss on the Belarusian lands exceeded 50% (for comparison, population loss during World War II in Belarus, one of the world worst hit territories, was about 25%).\nHowever, these numbers do not differentiate between people who died as a result of military action, and victims of the Black Death which ran through Europe at about that time. Proponents of the book usually respond that the Black Death had a minimal effect of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 17th century.\nAnother argument against the data used in the book tables is that they often refer to the period between 1648 and 1667, and thus additionally account for population loss caused by the Khmelnytsky Uprising of 1648-1654 and not associated with the Russian invasion.\nExample of a table from the book:\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" align=\"center\"\n|+ 4.
