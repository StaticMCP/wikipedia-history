Kazan had fallen deeply in love with Yoshiko, the daughter of Fujiwara no Tamemitsu. When Yoshiko died in childbirth, Kazan was distraught. Seeing an opportunity after Kazan attempted suicide, Michikane convinced Kazan to go away with him and become a Buddhist monk. Kazan agreed and in 986, the two of them sneaked out of the palace under the cover of night and went to the Gangyō-ji where Kazan officially took the priestly name of Nyūkaku. Michikane then returned and placed his nephew on the throne as Emperor Ichijō.\nHe was appointed udaijin in 994.\nAfter the death of Fujiwara no Michitaka, his son  Korechika expected to succeed him as Kampaku, instead, Ichijō appointed Michikane. Michikane died after seven days in the position, earning him the legacy as Nanoka no Kampaku (七日の関白), the seven-day regent.\nGenealogy\nHe was the father of Fujiwara no Kanetaka and Fujiwara no Sonshi.\nTwo clans later on claimed descent from Michikane: the  Rusu and the  Utsunomiya.\nReferences"
