This continues the chronology of the later Crusades through 1400. In the Middle East, the threats to the Christian West were from the Mamluks, the Timurids and the Ottomans. The latter would also threaten Eastern Europe and would emerge as the primary Islamic dynasty opposing the West. The Byzantine Empire would no longer exist, but the Reconquista was working well and would be resolved by the end of the 15th century. The works of Norman Housley, in particular, describe the Crusading movement in this timeframe, the impact of the fall of Constantinople in 1453, and the manifestation of Crusading propaganda.\nChronologies of the Crusades in print\nNumerous chronologies of the Crusades have been published and include the following.\n* A Chronology of the Crusades, covering the crusades from 1055–1456, by Timothy Venning.\n* Chronology and Maps, covering 1095–1789, in The Oxford History of the Crusades, edited by Jonathan Riley-Smith.\n* A Chronological Outline of the Crusades: Background, Military Expeditions, and Crusader States, covering 160–1798, in The Routledge Companion to the Crusades, by Peter Lock.\n* A Narrative Outline of the Crusades, covering 1096-1488, ibid.\n* The Crusades: A Chronology, covering 1096–1444, in The Crusades—An Encyclopedia, edited by Alan V.
