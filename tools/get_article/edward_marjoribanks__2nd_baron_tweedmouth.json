He served in various capacities in the Liberal governments of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nBiography\nTweedmouth was the son of Dudley Marjoribanks, 1st Baron Tweedmouth, and Isabella, daughter of Sir James Hogg, 1st Baronet. Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair, was his sister. He was descended from Joseph Marjoribanks, a wine and fish merchant in Edinburgh who died in 1635 and is thought to have been the grandson of Thomas Marjoribanks of Ratho, head of the lowland Clan Marjoribanks. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, but expelled in 1870 following a prank that led to the damage of college sculptures.\nPolitical career\nTweedmouth was returned to Parliament for Berwickshire in 1880, a seat he held until 1894. The seat had been held earlier in the century by his great-uncle, Sir John Marjoribanks, 1st Baronet, and cousin, Charles Albany Marjoribanks.\nHe served under William Ewart Gladstone as Comptroller of the Household in between February and July 1886 and was sworn of the Privy Council the same year. When the Liberals returned to power under Gladstone in 1892, he was made Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury (chief whip). He succeeded his father in the barony in March 1894, only a few days before Gladstone resigned and Lord Rosebery became prime minister. Rosebery appointed Tweedmouth Lord Privy Seal, with a seat in the cabinet, and in May 1894 he also became Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He retained these posts until the government fell in 1895.\nAmongst other property he inherited the Guisachan estate in Glen Affric from his father but he sold the estate in 1908 to the Earl of Portsmouth.\nAfter ten years in opposition, the Liberals again came to power in December 1905 under Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, who appointed Tweedmouth First Lord of the Admiralty, with a seat in the cabinet. In early 1908 he was criticised for corresponding with German emperor William II on the British naval programme. The matter was referred to the House of Commons. Chancellor of the Exchequer H. H. Asquith eventually stated that the correspondence was \"a purely personal and private communication, conceived in an entirely friendly spirit\" and no action was taken.  However, when Asquith succeeded Campbell-Bannerman as prime minister in April 1908 Tweedmouth was removed as head of the Admiralty and became Lord President of the Council. He suffered a nervous breakdown in June 1908, a condition which was said to partly explain his indiscretion in communicating with the German Emperor on naval matters. Although his health later recovered, he resigned in October 1908. He was made a Knight of the Thistle in 1908.\nAn advocate of workers' rights and social legislation, Tweedmouth was supportive of the Liberal Party's alliance with the Labour Party in the lead-up to the 1906 general election, believing that the Liberals could not win without it, and regarded as \"humbug\" the view that such an alliance meant class legislation.\nHe died on 15 September 1909.\nFamily\nLord Tweedmouth married Lady Fanny Octavia Louise (1853–1904), daughter of John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough and aunt of Sir Winston Churchill, in 1873. She reportedly died from cancer in August 1904, aged 51 \"at Lord Tweedmouth's Glen Affric shooting lodge\". They had a son and heir; Dudley, 3rd Baron Tweedmouth (1874–1935).\nLord Tweedmouth's parliamentary career saw him  reported as being the Laird of Guisachan and Glenaffric  who was, on occasions, \"in a fighting mood\".  Following Lady Tweedmouth's death, Lord Tweedmouth  sold the Lairdship of Glen Affric, the property including the Guisachan  Estate and deer park that his family had owned since the 1850s.  He was reported as being a \"generous laird\", who, like his father,  \"did much for the people\" of his estate; the \"ties which united the people of Glen Affric with the Laird and his lady were close\".\nLord Tweedmouth survived his wife by five years and died in September 1909, aged 60. He was succeeded in the barony by his son, Dudley.\nThe Rocking Chair Ranche\nFrom 1883 until 1896, he was an owner of and investor in Rocking Chair Ranche located in Collingsworth County, Texas, along with his father, The 1st Baron Tweedmouth, and his brother-in-law, The 7th Earl of Aberdeen.\nNotes\nReferences\nSecondary sources\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*[http://www.vandaprints.com/image.php?id=142557 Photograph of Lord Tweedmouth at vandaprints.com]"
