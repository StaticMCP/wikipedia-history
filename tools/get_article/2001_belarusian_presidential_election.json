The election should have been held in 1999, but a revised constitution adopted in 1996 extended incumbent Alexander Lukashenko's term for another two years.\nLukashenko was re-elected with 77.4% of the vote over two minor candidates. Voter turnout was 84%. A senior official for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe noted that the pre-election environment was \"not democratic\" and would not describe it as \"free and fair\".\nBackground\nThe first presidential election in Belarus took place in 1994, with Alexander Lukashenko emerging victorious. Two years later, Lukashenko significantly expanded presidential powers through a constitutional amendment adopted in a referendum. This amendment effectively reset his term, allowing him to serve an additional five years beyond the original 1999 election date, shifting the next election to 2001.\nThe Belarusian Constitution stipulates that presidential candidates must be at least 35 years old. They are also required to have resided in Belarus for at least 10 years preceding the election and, as per the 1996 constitutional amendment, must have been born in the country. To be nominated, candidates need to collect 100,000 signatures. Elections are conducted using a two-round system, with a minimum 50% voter turnout required for legitimacy.\nOver his initial seven-year tenure, Lukashenko consolidated his power by establishing firm control over the media, economy, and all three branches of government. During this period, several individuals, including former Central Election Commission chief Viktar Hanchar and former Minister of Internal Affairs Yury Zakharanka, disappeared under suspicious circumstances.\nAhead of the 2001 election, opposition groups, with the assistance of the OSCE, attempted to negotiate a new electoral law with Lukashenko, but these efforts proved unsuccessful. The law passed in 2000 did not provide guaranteed seats for the opposition on the Central Election Commission and restricted the activities of election observers.\nThe political climate surrounding the election was heavily influenced by recent international events, specifically the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević less than a year prior, shortly after that The Los Angeles Times began referring to Lukashenko as \"Europe's last dictator,\" a nickname previously applied to Milošević, including by American President Bill Clinton. Both themes were central to Lukashenko's campaign.\nCandidates\nOut of 22 initial candidacies, four withdrew their nominations. Among those who withdrew was Natalia Masherova, daughter of Pyotr Masherov (leader of the Belarusian SSR from 1965–1980), who had previously polled at 22% in June compared to Lukashenko's 42%.\nOf the remaining candidates, two did not submit their required signatures, leaving 16 who did. However, only four managed to gather the necessary 100,000 signatures to be formally nominated.\nThe opposition aimed to field a single candidate, with contenders including Mikhail Chigir (former Prime Minister), Pavel Kozlovsky (ex-defense minister), Sergey Kalyakin (Communist party leader), Semyon Domash (former governor of Grodno), and Uładzimir Hančaryk (trade union leader). However, only Domash and Hančaryk successfully gathered the required signatures. Domash subsequently withdrew his candidacy on August 22, just 18 days before the election, reportedly under pressure from the American ambassador, after being promised the position of Prime Minister in the event of an opposition victory.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Information on registered candidates\n|-\n!

He highlighted the achievements of his rule, emphasizing the absence of widespread impoverishment seen in those countries. For the future, Lukashenko pledged significant economic improvements, including raising salaries to $250 and doubling pensions. He also promised to reduce restrictions on businesses.\nIn foreign policy, Lukashenko's primary focus remained the Union State with Russia, though he also expressed a willingness for constructive cooperation with other nations. He openly claimed that the West was planning to remove him from power, mirroring the tactics used against Slobodan Milošević. This narrative resonated with the public, when asked to name up to three threats to Belarus, 41.7% identified NATO, 25% viewed the USA as such, and Russia was a distant third at 7.2%.\nLukashenko's campaign relied heavily on state media, a contrast to traditional political campaigning. He held only one public rally, drawing an estimated 3,000 people in Minsk on September 4.\nUładzimir Hančaryk\nUładzimir Hančaryk, a 61-year-old trade union leader, was notably older than the other 2001 Belarusian presidential candidates. His communist background also made him a target for attacks from other contenders. Hančaryk strategically presented his older age as a sign of experience, aiming to connect with voters by portraying himself as an everyman, no different from other Belarusians.\nHančaryk's campaign platform centered on strengthening democratic institutions. He vowed to establish an independent judiciary and weaken the presidency to empower the legislative and executive branches. A highlight of his campaign was the accusation that Lukashenko's government operated death squads to eliminate political opponents. Lukashenko, in turn, claimed these disappearances were staged by the opposition to blacken his reputation. Regarding foreign policy, Hančaryk emphasized his positive stance toward Russia, even publicly appealing to Vladimir Putin to ensure the fairness of the upcoming elections. He also expressed a desire for eventual European Union membership for Belarus.\nHis campaign maintained a low profile, with the New York Times describing him as \"wooden.\" He held just one rally, attracting 2,500 attendees in Minsk on September 3.\nSergei Gaidukevich\nSergei Gaidukevich, a fifteen-year veteran of the Soviet armed forces who reached the rank of colonel, founded the Liberal Democratic Party of Belarus in 1992 by uniting 28 smaller parties and movements. His party, self-described as centrist and democratic, positioned itself as \"the only party that is against abstract 'market' or communist ideals.\"\nGaidukevich advocated for a broadly liberal economic platform. He criticized the \"dictatorship\" he claimed Lukashenko had established, asserting it had brought all society down to the same level. He also derided his political rivals as \"dinosaurs.\"\nThere was speculation that Gaidukevich's candidacy was a strategic move by Lukashenko to ensure at least one opposing candidate in the event of an election boycott, as had occurred in the 2000 parliamentary elections.\nMedia\nThe election was characterized by abuses against non-government media. This included the closure of Magic Press, a publishing house that printed over 15 newspapers. Additionally, Znameniye Publishers was shut down after printing leaflets for Hančaryk.\nThe media landscape was predominantly government-controlled. The state-owned newspaper, Sovetskaya Belorussiya, held a dominant position, with its circulation volume exceeding that of the top dozen independent papers combined. This platform was leveraged to publish an article, distributed in over 600,000 copies, describing alleged attempts by Western intelligence services to subvert Belarus.\nBelarusian Television (BT), the nation's sole nationwide TV channel, allocated its electoral coverage disproportionately: 68% was dedicated to Lukashenko, while Hančaryk received 20% and Gaidukevich 7%. Lukashenko's portrayal was consistently positive, whereas the opposition received negative coverage. Despite BT's monopoly, only 37.2% of Belarusians watched it, with the Russian ORT channel commanding a much larger audience at 80.3%. A similar situation existed on radio, where the President received 65% of all coverage.\nElection day was marked by the cutting of access to websites critical of Lukashenko, including Hančaryk's campaign site. At the same time, the telephones of organizations conducting independent election oversight were shut down.\nForeign interference\nThe elections had concerns related to foreign interference. In late June, the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, Alexius II, visited Belarus, a trip framed as a counterpoint to the Pope's concurrent visit to Ukraine. During his visit, the Patriarch claimed that Catholics were attempting to sow division.\nWhile Russian President Vladimir Putin initially refrained from a direct endorsement, he visited Vitebsk, Belarus, on 25 July, where he met with Lukashenko. In the weeks preceding the election, Belarus also saw visits from the mayors of Moscow and Saint Petersburg, as well as the leaders of Russian and Ukrainian communist parties. Just two days before the election, on 7 September, Putin explicitly reminded the public that the idea of the Union State originated with Lukashenko.\nAt the same time, the Russian NTV channel, then facing a takeover attempt by Putin, amplified news regarding death squads associated with Lukashenko. Furthermore, the Russian-owned publishing house, Magic Press, printed opposition campaign materials, leading to a crackdown by Lukashenko's government.\nConcerns regarding anti-Lukashenko interference by the USA arose during the election period. The Zubr movement, which emerged before the election and conducted sustained, guerrilla-style protests, was compared by The New York Times to Serbia's Otpor movement, known for its U.S. funding and instrumental role in Slobodan Milošević's downfall.\nDuring the electoral campaign, the Belarusian government expelled an American representative of the AFL–CIO labor organization, alleging support for Hančaryk. Lukashenko also publicly criticized OSCE representative Hans-Georg Wieck, a diplomat and former president of the German Federal Intelligence Service. According to Belarusian journalist Alyaksandr Feduta, Wieck was instrumental in selecting the unified opposition candidate.\nFor the 2001 Belarusian presidential election, $12.41 million was provided through the Freedom Support Act, specifically targeting the elections. This came from a larger estimated $37.78 million in overall aid given to Belarus prior to the election. Some estimates suggest the United States made a total of $50 million available for this election campaign.\nOpinion polls\nState-owned polls predicted a first-round victory for Lukashenko, with projections ranging from 65-70% of the vote.\nBefore the election, NISEPI, a Belarusian pollster, tracked voter intention among the two main candidates, gathering the following data:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Willingness to vote for a candidate\n|-\n!  !! 08.07 !! 16.07 !! 24.07 !! 01.08 !! 09.08 !! 17.08 !! 25.08 !! 31.08 !! 08.09\n|-\n!

Hančaryk\n| 3.4 || 4.2 || 4.8 || 8.4 || 13.7 || 13.1 || 20.3 || 23.2 || 27.8\n|}\nWhile Belarusian law prohibited exit polls, some organizations conducted post-election surveys of the electorate. A survey by NISEPI, for instance, indicated that 57.9% voted for Lukashenko and 24.5% for Hančaryk, 21% of those polled believed that election rigging altered the outcome. In April 2002, Office of Research reported that 61% voted for Lukashenko.\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible sortable\"\n|+ Calculated based on NISEPI post-election poll\n|-\n!
