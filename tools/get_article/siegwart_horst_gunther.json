He once worked with Albert Schweitzer in Africa.  He was a prominent proponent of the claim that the use of depleted uranium in munitions causes cancers, birth defects and other pathologies.  In 2007 the Nuclear-Free Future Award honored for the third time Prof. Günther for refusing to back down to pressure and for visiting Iraq to study the real-life consequences of depleted uranium use.\nSee also\n*Nuclear-Free Future Award\n*Hartmut Gründler\n*[https://youtube.com/watch?v=Bwp6wJMmSEc  The Doctor, the Depleted Uranium, and the Dying Children]—An award-winning documentary film produced for German television, streaming on YouTube\n* International Coalition to Ban Uranium Weapons Archived by the Wayback Machine 19 March 2015.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Siegwart Horst Gunther\n\n#REDIRECT Siegwart Horst Günther"
