Established in 1992, the park celebrates the life and history of the Keweenaw Peninsula in the Upper Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan.  It is a federal-local cooperative park made up of two primary units, the Calumet Unit and the Quincy Unit, and almost two dozen cooperating \"Heritage Sites\" located on federal, state, and privately owned land in and around the Keweenaw Peninsula.  The National Park Service owns approximately  in the Calumet and Quincy Units. Units are located in Baraga, Houghton, Keweenaw, and Ontonagon counties.\nThe Congressional legislation establishing the Park stated, among other things, that:\n(1) The oldest and largest lava flow known on Earth is located on the Keweenaw Peninsula of Michigan.  This volcanic activity produced the only place on Earth where large scale economically recoverable 97 percent pure native copper is found.\n(2) The Keweenaw Peninsula is the only site in the country where prehistoric aboriginal mining of copper occurred.  Artifacts made from this copper by these ancient Indians were traded as far south as present day Alabama.\nCopper heritage\nThe Keweenaw Peninsula is the site of the most extensive known deposits of native copper in the world.  Occurring here in relatively pure form, the red metal could be broken out of the rock and worked to make a wide variety of products, from jewelry and tools by its earliest miners to coins and electric wire by its final generations.  Keweenaw copper was mined for approximately 7,000 years, from 5000 BCE until 1968.  During the period for which records were kept, 1840–1968, more than 11 billion pounds (5 million metric tons) of copper were mined here.  During the peak production years of World War I, 1916–1917, the annual copper yield reached a maximum of 270 million pounds (125,000 t).\n\"(7) The entire picture of copper mining on Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula is best represented by three components: the Village of Calumet, the former Calumet and Hecla Mining Company properties (including the Osceola #13 mine complex), and the former Quincy Mining Company properties.  The Village of Calumet best represents the social, ethnic and commercial themes.  Extant Calumet and Hecla buildings best depict corporate paternalism and power, and the themes of extraction and processing are best represented by extant structures of the Quincy Mining Company.\"\nEthnic heritage\nMany ethnic groups contributed to the heritage of the Keweenaw National Historical Park.   Throughout the later half of the 19th century and the first two decades of the 20th century, immigrants from across Europe migrated to the Keweenaw to work in the copper mines and mining communities. By 1910 the Copper Country had been settled by French Canadian, German, Chinese, Irish, Cornish, Croatian, Finnish, Italian, Greek and Syrian people.\nWhen news of the region's rich native copper was first widely published in the 1830s, many families from the English county of Cornwall immigrated to the Upper Peninsula, bringing the Cornish pasty and their region's knowledge of hard-rock mining with them.  Several park Heritage Sites, including the log cabin village of \"Old Victoria,\" recall Cornish heritage in the region.\nLater in the 1800s, many families from Finland emigrated to the United States.  Until 1918, Finland belonged to Russia as a Grand Duchy.  A large percentage of these Finns settled in the Western Upper Peninsula because of perceived similarities between their old and new homes, and found work in the Keweenaw. Finnish saunas can still be found throughout the area.  Several park Heritage Sites, including the \"Hanka Homestead\", recall the Finnish influx.\nCalumet Unit\nThe Calumet Unit of the Keweenaw National Historical Park includes many sites in and around the villages of Calumet and Laurium, which are not ghost towns but operating human communities that have survived the shutdown of their parent employer, the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company, in 1968.  By digging shafts into the rock, the men and owners of the Calumet & Hecla found geological formations of rock laced with nuggets of almost pure copper.\nThe Calumet & Hecla was the richest of the separate copper mines of the Keweenaw, and the towns built at the mine head reflect its productivity.  A 1,200-seat opera house, large churches built of Lake Superior brownstone, and mansions built by the mining bosses survive as memories of the Calumet mine's glory years.\nFile:H n C Mine Office Calumet, MI.JPG|Main Office of the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company (now the Headquarters of the National Historical Park)\nFile:H n C Mine employee library bathhouse Calumet, MI.JPG|The Company Library and Bathhouse for its employees.\nFile:H n C Mining Company Warehouse Calumet, MI.JPG|Warehouse of the C&H Mining Company in Calumet, Michigan.\nQuincy Unit\nThe Quincy Unit of the Keweenaw National Historical Park commemorates one of the most remarkable feats of engineering in northern Michigan, the  deep Quincy Mine shaft.  Nicknamed \"Old Reliable\" for its record of paying annual dividends for decades, the Quincy mine enjoyed a position on the rich copper rock of the Pewabic Lode.  A private preservation foundation maintains the Quincy Mine's surface mine hoist, which is the largest steam-powered hoist in the world.\nFile:Quincy Mine Location 1920 (HAER).jpg|Quincy Mine plan created by the HAER, National Park Service, Department of the Interior.\nFile:Quincy Smelting Works 1920 (HAER).jpg|Quincy Smelting Works plan created by the HAER, National Park Service, Department of the Interior.\nFile:Quincy Mine Hoist Power House.JPG|Mine Hoist Powerhouse for the Quincy Mine Hoist.\nFile:KNHP Quincy Mine sign.jpg|KNHP sign for the Quincy Mine\nHeritage Sites\nAs of 2023, the Keweenaw National Historical Park operates in cooperation with 23 heritage sites in the Keweenaw Peninsula and nearby. The heritage site system was established in 2007 with an original set of 19 sites. In October 2013, two new sites were added: Houghton's Carnegie Museum and the Michigan Technological University Archives.\nAdventure Mining Company\nThe Adventure Mining Company is located at 200 Adventure Avenue in Greenland, Michigan.  The Adventure Mine operated in Greenland from 1850 until 1920, and consisted of five shafts, one of which descended  beneath the surface.  Although the site seemed promising, the mine never turned a profit.  The Adventure Mining Company currently offers tours of the surface and underground portions of the Adventure Mine.\nA.E. Seaman Mineral Museum\nThe A.E. Seaman Mineral Museum was located on the Fifth Floor of Electrical Resource Center at Michigan Technological University in Houghton, Michigan. As of 2011, it is now located across from the Advanced Technology Development Complex. The museum is named for Arthur Edmund Seaman, who worked at Michigan Tech in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and was the museum's curator from 1928 to 1937.\nThe mineral collection was established in the 19th century, and by 1890 numbered 27,000 specimens.  A museum to house the collection was constructed in 1908. The museum has since moved several times, and the collection has grown to over 30,000 specimens, of which 8,000 are on display.  The museum features an extensive mineral collection and exhibits on copper formation, and has the world's best collection of crystallized native copper and native copper in crystallized calcite.\nCarnegie Museum\nThe Carnegie Museum in Houghton is a former Carnegie library and former home of the Portage Lake District Library.

The theatre originally housed live theatre, attracting notable performers such as Frank Morgan (later famous for his roles in The Wizard of Oz), Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., Lon Chaney, Sr., John Philip Sousa, Sarah Bernhardt, and Madame Helena Modjeska among others.  However, in the late 1920s, the theatre converted to a movie house, serving in this medium until the 1950s. Summer stock theatre was brought back to the Calumet Theater in 1958, and performed there every summer until 1968, and returned in 1972.\nIn 1975, the auditorium was restored for the centennial of Calumet. In 1988−89, the exterior of the theatre was restored.  In 1983, the Calumet Theatre Company was incorporated as a non-profit organization. The staff consists mostly of volunteers, though there are eight full-time staff members.  Today, the Calumet Theatre is home to as many as 80 theatre-related events a year, with an estimated 20,000 people attending.\nChassell Heritage Center\nThe Chassell Heritage Center is located at 42373 Hancock Street in Chassell, Michigan.
