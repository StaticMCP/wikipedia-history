Edward was born in Launceston, Tasmania, brought up in New Zealand, and educated in France and at King's College London.\nHe married Agnes Mildred Hall on 15 July 1874 at Christchurch. She was the daughter of George Williamson Hall, and John Hall was thus her uncle. Edward and Agnes had four children: Edward Howard St George Wakefield (1875); Gerald Seymour Wakefield (1877); Grace Josephine Wakefield (1879); and Mildred Wakefield (1881).\nWakefield was a journalist and then a colourful, volatile and ambitious politician in New Zealand, who showed considerable promise, though this was not quite fulfilled; \"He was among the best parliamentary debaters of the time; admired for his wit and power of argument.\" Prior to entering politics he was a public servant and served as the second Cabinet Secretary for the Fox Ministry in 1869.\nHe was the Member of Parliament for Geraldine 1875–1881, then for Selwyn 1884–1887, when he resigned. He won an  by-election against John McLachlan, and was then elected unopposed in 1884 general election some five months later. He served as Colonial Secretary in the short 1884 ministry of Harry Atkinson; from 28 August to 3 September 1884.\nWakefield subsequently concentrated on writing, producing New Zealand after Fifty Years (1889). Later he moved to America, then London. Having become blind in old age, he was made a brother of the Charterhouse in recognition of his service, and resided there at the almshouse; he died there in 1924.\nReferences\n* [http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/W/WakefieldEdward/WakefieldEdward/en Biography in the 1966 Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]\n* The Cyclopedia of New Zealand, Volume 1 part 1 (1897), Wellington: page 82."
