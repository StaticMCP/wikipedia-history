      "text": "# Endemic flora of Stewart Island\n\n]]\nOf the 893 plant taxa (including hybrids) native to Stewart Island or Rakiura (Māori), the third largest Island in New Zealand located south of the South Island, 585 plants are native, and only a fraction are endemic (found nowhere else).}}\nMuch of this endemism is found in alpine areas, and is represented mostly by small daisies and buttercups. Brachyglottis stewartiae is the only endemic tree. The smaller offshore islands including: Tītī Islands, Codfish Island and islets in the Foveaux Strait are included as Stewart Island in this list. Although David Lyall collected the first plant from Stewart Island in around 1847–51, the first large survey of the flora of Stewart Island was published by botanist Leonard Cockayne in 1909. The most recent full treatment of the island's flora was written by Hugh Wilson in 1987. As Cockayne notes, Stewart Island is a largely unchanged landscape and as a result of this and its unique ecology, it has a national park which covers 85% of its area.\nAlthough the vast majority of plants found on Stewart Island are found in other parts of New Zealand, several of the most common native mainland plants are not found there. Notably missing are any beech trees (Nothofagus sp.), which may be a result of glaciation, as well as kōwhai, māhoe, and kānuka, among others. When glaciers retreated from montane areas of Stewart Island 14,000 years ago, beech trees, as a result of their slow rate of spread, were not fast enough to recolonise. Other common plants were later introduced after their seeds were blown across the Foveaux Strait. Notable ecosystems in Stewart Island include: large dunes formed by pīngao, podocarp forests dominated by kāmahi and rimu, and coastal scrub of tree daisies.}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\nNon-vascular plants\n}}\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
