The institution documents and protects Polish and Eastern Bloc light advertisements created after World War II. It is the first in Poland and one of the few museums of neon signs in the world.\nIt relocated in 2025 to the Palace of Culture from its former premises in the district of Praga-Południe at the Soho Factory. It was established in 2012.\nPhotographer Ilona Karwińska and graphic designer David Hill managed to save more than 200 neon signs and about 500 letters from imminent destruction.\nThe museum also maintains a huge archive of documentation, drawings, photographs and original plans related to the history of these signs.\nFirst, the guide introduces the visitors to the museum itself and the Soho factory area, and then a double-decker bus takes them through the streets of Warsaw, and the guide tells them where this or that sign, advertisement was installed. A collection of Polish neon signs and advertisements from the socialist era is popular with visitors.\nThe oldest neon sign is probably located at the Warszawa Stadion train station. The museum acquired, among others, the neon signs of the restaurants \"Shanghai\" and \"Ambasador\", the café \"Jaś i Małgosia\" and the cooperative trading house \"Sezam\".\nThe museum's collection includes a \"Karina\" sign made from the letters of the original neon \"Tkaniny dekoracyjne\" signage. The sign \"Karina\" was created during the filming of the movie Aftermath by Władysław Pasikowski about the Jedwabne pogrom.\nExhibitions of the collection were held in London, Luxembourg, Amsterdam.\nHistory\nThe history of the museum began in 2005 when Ilona Karwińska saved the Berlin neon sign from Marszałkowska Street in Warsaw. The collection of the museum features about 100 neon lights from all over Poland\nMost of the neons come from the 1960s and 1970s.\nThe nine largest neon signs including GŁÓWNA KSIĘGARNIA TECHNICZNA (MAIN TECHNICAL BOOKSTORE), Jubiler, dworzec kolejowy CHODZIEŻ (CHODZIEŻ railway station), KINO PRAHA (PRAHA cinema) and WARSZAWA WSCHODNIA are located on different Soho Factory buildings. The museum also looks after some neon signs in Warsaw, including Mermaid on Grójecka Street.\nThe museum has a large archive containing blueprints, photographs and original plans.\nIn 2013, the museum together with RWE organized Neon for Warsaw competition.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://neonmuzeum.org/ Official website of the Museum]"
