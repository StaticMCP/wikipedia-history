      "text": "# List of Senior CLASS Award men's lacrosse winners\n\nThe Senior CLASS Award is presented each year to the outstanding senior NCAA Division I Student-Athlete of the Year in men's lacrosse.  The award was established in 2007.\nSo far, no women's version of this award has been created. Three NCAA sports that are sponsored for both men and women have Senior CLASS Awards for only one sex—ice hockey and lacrosse do not have women's awards, and volleyball does not have a men's award.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Winner\n!School\n|-\n|2007\n|Matt McMonagle\n|Cornell\n|-\n|2008\n|Mike Leveille\n|Syracuse\n|-\n|2009\n|Max Seibald\n|Cornell\n|-\n|2010\n|Andrew Maisano\n|Army\n|-\n|2011\n|Brian Karalunas\n|Villanova\n|-\n|2012\n|C.
