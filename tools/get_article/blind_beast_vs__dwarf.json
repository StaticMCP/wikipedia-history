Blind Beast vs. Killer Dwarf is a 2001 Japanese horror film directed by Teruo Ishii in his final effort before his death in 2005.\nMieko Tanaka, elected to the Diet in the 2009 Japanese general election, appears in a role that includes a nude scene. This precipitated a surge in its sales that year.\nPlot\nWhile returning home after viewing an all-girls opera, dime-novel writer Monzo Kobayashi encounters a strange deformed dwarf dressed in samurai garb carrying a woman's severed arm. Unnerved yet fascinated by the encounter, Monzō begins his own research into dwarfs including the mysterious samurai-clad man. Introduced to investigator Kogoro Akechi by an old friend, Monzō learns about a string of grisly murders involving the same man whom Monzō had encountered. As time wears on, Monzō's fascination soon becomes an obsession as he desperately tries to find the secret behind the murders and the strange man.\nCast\n* Lily Franky as Monzō Kobayashi\n* Shin'ya Tsukamoto as Kogorō Akechi\n* Hisayoshi Hirayama as Mōjuu / Blind Beast\n* Little Frankie as Issunbōshi / Dwarf\n* Mutsumi Fujita as Ranko Mizuki\n* Reika Hashimoto as Yurie Yamano\n* Tetsurō Tanba as Dr. Tange\n* Kenpachirō Satsuma as Yasukawa, the doll-maker\nRelease\nHome media\nThe film was released on DVD by Panik House Entertainment on August 22, 2006.
