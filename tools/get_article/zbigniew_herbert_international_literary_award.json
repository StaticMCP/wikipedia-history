Zbigniewa Herberta) is a Polish international literature prize established in 2013 in Warsaw and named after a Polish poet, essayist, and moralist Zbigniew Herbert (1924–1998). It is conferred annually by the Zbigniew Herbert Foundation and its aim is to recognize \"outstanding artistic and intellectual literary achievements on the world stage which have a bearing on the world of values towards which Zbigniew Herbert’s work gravitated\".\nHistory\nIn 2010, the Zbigniew Herbert Foundation was set up to preserve and promote Herbert's \"creative legacy as an integral part of the literary and cultural heritage of Poland, Europe and the world\" as well as to encourage and support \"education in the fields of literature and the humanities, particularly modern literature, writing, poetry and journalism, with a special emphasis on programs for young people\". The initiative to establish the foundation was put forward by his wife Katarzyna Dzieduszycka-Herbert.\nThe jury selecting the winners of the award have included many renowned literature experts and authors such as Edward Hirsch, Jaume Vallcorba Plana, Tomas Venclova, Yurii Andrukhovych, Agneta Pleijel, Michael Krüger, Lidija Dimkovska, and Jarosław Mikołajewski.\nLaureates\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=100%\n|- bgcolor=\"#505050\"\n!Year\n!Laureate(s)\n!Image\n!Citizenship(s)\n!Institution(s)\n!Source(s)\n|-\n! scope=row| 2024\n| Yang Lian\n|\n| Switzerland, China\n| European Graduate School\n|\n|-\n! scope=row| 2023\n|\n|\n| Lithuania\n| University of Vilnius\n|\n|-\n! scope=row| 2022\n|\n|\n| Ukraine\n| University of Lviv\n|\n|-\n! scope=row| 2021\n|\n|\n| United States\n| New York University\n|\n|-\n! scope=row| 2020\n|\n|\n| Germany\n| Kunstakademie Düsseldorf\n|\n|-\n! scope=row| 2019\n|\n|\n| Israel\n| Hebrew University of Jerusalem\n|\n|-\n! scope=row| 2018\n|\n|\n| Ireland\n| University College Cork\n|\n|-\n! scope=row| 2017\n|\n|\n| South Africa / France\n| University of Cape Town\n|\n|-\n! scope=row| 2016\n|\n|\n| Sweden\n| University of Texas at Austin\n|\n|-\n!scope=row| 2015\n|\n|\n| Poland\n| Adam Mickiewicz University\n|\n|-\n!scope=row| 2014\n|\n|\n| Serbia / United States\n| University of New Hampshire\n|\n|-\n!scope=row| 2013\n|\n|\n| United States\n| Princeton University\n|\n|}\nSee also\n*Angelus Award\n*Silesius Poetry Award\n*Polish literature\nReferences"
