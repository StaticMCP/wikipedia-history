He is best known for his taxonomic work and studies into pteridophytes, but also studied orchids, mosses and lichens.\nBiography\nOlof Swartz  attended the University of Uppsala where he studied under Carl Linnaeus the Younger (1741–1783) and received his doctorate in 1781.\nHe first traveled in 1780  to Lapland in the company of several other botanists.\nIn 1783 he sailed for North America and the West Indies, primarily in the area of Jamaica and Hispaniola, to collect botanical specimens.\nHis botanical collection, of an impressive 6000 specimens, is now held by the Swedish Museum of Natural History, as part of the Regnellian herbarium.\nDr. Olof Swartz: drawing of Malaxis umbelliflora\nBy 1786 he left for London to prepare his collection.  There he met naturalist Joseph Banks (1743–1820), who was impressed with his knowledge of Botany.  He was offered a position with the British East India Company as a travelling physician, but turned it down, and returned to Sweden in 1787. Ten years later he proposed to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (of which he became a member in 1789) the idea of a permanent travel grant, based on the methods he had seen employed by Joseph Banks within the British Empire. In 1791 he became Professor Bergianus at the Academy of Sciences at Stockholm. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1805.\nHe was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1806.\nSwartz was the first specialist of orchid taxonomy, who published a critical review of orchid literature and classified the 25 genera that he recognized through his work.  He was also the first to realize that most orchids have one stamen, while slipper orchids have two.\nThe genus Swartzia (Caesalpiniaceae, Fabaceae or Leguminosae) was named in his honour by Schreber. Then Schwartzia, which is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Marcgraviaceae was named in 1829 by Vell.\nSelected works\n* [http://www.botanicus.org/title/b1199485x Nova genera et species plantarum seu prodromus], 1788\n* Observationes botanicae, 1791\n* Icones plantarum incognitarum, illustrating the rare plants of the West Indies (Upsala, 1794-1800)\n* [http://www.botanicus.org/item/31753003467641 Flora Indiae occidentalis],  (3 vols., 1797-1806)\n* Synopsis Filicum, 1806\n* Lichenes Americani (Nuremberg, 1811)\n* Summa vegetabilium Scandinaviae, 1814\nSee also\n* :Category:Taxa named by Olof Swartz\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Kurt Polycarp Joachim Sprengel (1823) Memoir of the life and writings of Olaus Swartz  (Edinburgh:  A.
