The ceremony attracted 16.2 million viewers, 2.5 million fewer than the previous year's ceremony, but still the ratings winner for the week. The Discovery Channel received its first major nomination this year.\nThis awards show was the first in fourteen years to be held in August because of NBC's request; because of NBC Sunday Night Football, the ceremony moved to accommodate NFL Kickoff Weekend.\nA new voting system determined nominees in particular categories (mostly lead acting and outstanding series categories) by a \"blue ribbon\" panel of judges, which resulted in the exclusion of popular shows such as Desperate Housewives and Lost, and actors like James Gandolfini and Edie Falco from The Sopranos and Hugh Laurie from House. Losts exclusion was mocked during the opening sequence (see below), when O'Brien, accompanied by Hugo \"Hurley\" Reyes, headed down a hatch to get to the Emmys. O'Brien asked Reyes if he wanted to come; Reyes says coyly, \"Well, we weren't exactly invited\", to which O'Brien replies \"But you won last year!\"\nFor its second season, The Office won Outstanding Comedy Series; this was its only major award. No comedy series won more than two major awards this year. In the drama field, 24 won Outstanding Drama Series for its fifth season, after being nominated and losing the previous four years.  It was also the first time the Fox Network won this award.  Its three major awards topped all drama series. Its Outstanding Lead Actor, Drama award (for Kiefer Sutherland) was also the first time Fox had won this award.\nEllen Burstyn was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or Movie for her role in Mrs. Harris, even though she was onscreen for only fourteen seconds, which caused controversy.\nThe show that received the most major nominations was Mrs. Harris, with seven. The top-nominated show had not received so few nominations since 1970, when Marcus Welby, M.D. received six. However, there were far fewer nominations back then, with most categories having three slots making this ceremony unique.\nThe pilot episode of My Name Is Earl joined a select group of TV episodes to win for both directing and writing.\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are listed first and highlighted in bold:\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program winner]]\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'The Office (NBC)'\n** Arrested Development (Fox)\n** Curb Your Enthusiasm (HBO)\n** Scrubs (NBC)\n** Two and a Half Men (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* '24 (Fox)'\n** ''Grey's Anatomy (ABC)\n** House (Fox)\n** The Sopranos (HBO)\n** The West Wing (NBC)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'The Girl in the Café (HBO)'\n** Flight 93 (A&E)\n** The Flight That Fought Back (Discovery Channel)\n** Mrs. Harris (HBO)\n** Yesterday (HBO)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Elizabeth I (HBO)'\n** Bleak House (PBS)\n** Into the West (TNT)\n** Sleeper Cell (Showtime)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'The Daily Show with Jon Stewart (Comedy Central)'\n** The Colbert Report (Comedy Central)\n** Late Night with Conan O'Brien (NBC)\n** Late Show with David Letterman (CBS)\n** Real Time with Bill Maher (HBO)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'The Amazing Race (CBS)'\n** American Idol (Fox)\n** Dancing with the Stars (ABC)\n** Project Runway (Bravo)\n** Survivor (CBS)\n|}\nActing\nLead performances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Tony Shalhoub – Monk as Adrian Monk (USA)'\n** Steve Carell – The Office as Michael Scott (NBC)\n** Larry David – Curb Your Enthusiasm as himself (HBO)\n** Kevin James – The King of Queens as Doug Heffernan (CBS)\n** Charlie Sheen – Two and a Half Men as Charlie Harper (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Julia Louis-Dreyfus – The New Adventures of Old Christine as Christine Campbell (CBS)'\n** Stockard Channing – Out of Practice as Lydia Barnes (CBS)\n** Jane Kaczmarek – Malcolm in the Middle as Lois (Fox) (Episode: “Lois Strikes Back”)\n** Lisa Kudrow – The Comeback as Valerie Cherish (HBO)\n** Debra Messing – Will & Grace as Grace Adler (NBC)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Kiefer Sutherland – 24 as Jack Bauer (Fox)'\n** Peter Krause – Six Feet Under as Nate Fisher (HBO)\n** Denis Leary – Rescue Me as Tommy Gavin (FX)\n** Christopher Meloni – Law & Order: Special Victims Unit as Elliot Stabler (NBC)\n** Martin Sheen – The West Wing as President Jed Bartlet (NBC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Mariska Hargitay – Law & Order: Special Victims Unit as Olivia Benson (NBC)'\n** Frances Conroy – Six Feet Under as Ruth Fisher (HBO)\n** Geena Davis – Commander in Chief as President Mackenzie Allen (ABC)\n** Allison Janney – The West Wing as C.

O'Brien then rhetorically asked the flight attendant, \"What could possibly go wrong?\" Immediately after that, the plane began to experience turbulence and then was portrayed as having crashed on (or near) an island. O'Brien is then seen walking ashore on the beach and onto the island still wearing his (now drenched) tuxedo. Hurley appears and then follows O'Brien to a hatch. When O'Brien asks if he wants to come along, Hurley says that they \"weren't exactly invited\". O'Brien enters the hatch and arrives on the set of The Office.\nThe intention of this opening sequence was to parody the premise of the ABC series Lost. However, the sequence reportedly disturbed some viewers because of the Comair Flight 5191 disaster that had occurred earlier in the day. Cincinnati NBC affiliate WLWT-TV had the unfortunate coincidence of running a \"Breaking News\" scroll about the crash at the same time as the scene was airing.\nEntertainment industry critics, such as LA Weekly columnist Nikki Finke, lambasted NBC's decision to not pull the plane crash portion of the opening sequence, in light of the aforementioned crash earlier that day. Finke stated that she believed NBC could have—with relative ease—instructed their writers to come up with a different sketch at the last minute, which could have been used as a substitute.\nOther parodies\nThe skit also parodied shows such as The Office, 24, House, South Park, and Dateline NBC (specifically, the \"To Catch a Predator\" segments). An animated Tom Cruise from the South Park episode \"Trapped in the Closet\" appears in a skit where an animated O'Brien hides in Stan Marsh's closet, only to run away when he discovers Cruise has already occupied the closet.\nTributes\nThe show featured tributes to two TV legends: Dick Clark (\"America's Oldest Teenager\"), and Aaron Spelling, producer of such classic TV shows as Dynasty and Beverly Hills, 90210. The former tribute was presented by Simon Cowell, American Idol judge, with a performance by Barry Manilow, who won a Primetime Emmy Award later that evening. Joan Collins, Heather Locklear, and Stephen Collins, along with the original three ''Charlie's Angels, gave the tribute for Spelling.\nIn Memoriam\nActors from  Dynasty  Joan Collins and Heather Locklear, Actor from 7th Heaven Stephen Collins and Three Original Cast of Charlie’s Angels'' Farrah Fawcett, Kate Jackson and Jaclyn Smith Pays Tribute To Aaron Spelling\n*Dennis Weaver\n*Barnard Hughes\n*Mrs. Philo T.
