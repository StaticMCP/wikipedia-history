      "text": "# John Warner (Jesuit)\n\nJohn Warner (1628–1692) was an English Jesuit, known as a controversialist and confessor to James II.\nLife\nHe was born in Warwickshire, and was educated and ordained priest in Spain. For some years prior to 1663, when he entered the Jesuit order, he held the chair of philosophy and divinity in the English College at Douai. He was afterwards successively lecturer in divinity in the Jesuit college at Liège and prolocutor of the order at Paris, where he took the fourth vow on 2 February 1673. He was appointed rector of Liège in 1678, and on 4 December 1679 provincial of his order. He was reputed to be implicated in the Popish Plot; the 1680 pamphlet A Vindication of the English Catholics against the accusations levelled at the Jesuits in the fictitious Plot is attributed to him. Warner claimed that Titus Oates had offered to sell to the Jesuits his manuscript narrative which later became the backbone of the alleged Plot, early in August 1678. He participated in the eleventh general Jesuit congregation held in Rome from 21 June to 6 September 1682 and served as rector of St. Omer from 1683 until 1686.\nOn the recommendation of Edward Petre, he replaced the Capuchin Father Mansuete as confessor to James II, in 1686; according to Maurice Ashley, Warner gave James moderate advice. At the time of the Glorious Revolution in 1689 he followed James to France, though detained at Gravesend where he needed forged papers to escape. He died at Paris on 21 November 1692.\nWorks\nWarner was the author of several works, including:\n*Vindiciae censurae Duacenae, seu confutatio scripti cujusdam Thomae Albii contra latum a S. facilitate theologica Duacena in 22 propositiones ejus censuram. Cui praefigitur Albianae censurae scopus, et alia quaedam ejus dogmata referuntur, published under the pseudonym Jonas Thamon, Douai, 1661.
