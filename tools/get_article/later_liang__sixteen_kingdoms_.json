It was founded by the Lü family of the Di ethnicity and given the prefix of \"Later\" in historiography to distinguish it with the Former Liang dynasty before them and the three Liang states (Southern, Northern and Western) that emerged during their collapse.\nAll rulers of the Later Liang proclaimed themselves \"Heavenly King\" (Tian Wang). The state's founder, Lü Guang initially took on lesser titles before declaring himself Heavenly King of Liang in 396, and so the state was only known as \"Liang\" (涼) from 396 to 403. The Later Liang at its peak controlled the Hexi Corridor in Gansu with Guzang (姑臧, in modern Wuwei, Gansu) as their capital. After the Southern Liang and Northern Liang broke away in 397, their territory was gradually reduced to their capital region in central Gansu.\nHistory\nBackground\nLü Guang was a Di military general under the Former Qin dynasty. His family was from Lüeyang Commandery, and his father, Lü Polou was a key figure in supporting Fu Jian to the throne. Lü Guang participated in various military campaigns under Fu Jian, and in 383, he was sent to command an expedition to the Western Regions. In 384, Lü Guang conquered Kucha, where he captured and met the Buddhist monk, Kumārajīva. He initially intended to settle down in the Western Regions, but at the advice of Kumārajīva, decided to return to Former Qin with his plunders.\nThe Inspector of Liang province, Liang Xi was suspicious of Lü Guang and attempted to prevent him from returning. However, Lü Guang defeated and executed Liang Xi, thus taking control of the province and appointing himself as the new Inspector. It was around this time when he was made aware that the Former Qin was disintegrating following their defeat to the Eastern Jin at the Battle of Fei River in 383.\nReign of Lü Guang\nIn 386, after hearing of Fu Jian's death the prior year, Lü Guang posthumously honoured him as Emperor Wenzhao before introducing a new reign era at his capital, Guzang (姑臧, in modern Wuwei, Gansu). Historians consider this the beginning of the Later Liang dynasty, named so to distinguish it with the Former Liang and other Liang states from the period. However, Lü Guang would only claim an imperial title in 387, and even then, it was merely the lowly title of Duke of Jiuquan.\nWhile a brilliant commander, Lü Guang was an unpopular ruler, as he was prone to killing his subjects and heavily relied on military might to consolidate his rule. In 386, he had several famous local literati executed, leading to a wave of rebellions breaking out in his territory, one of which was led by a member of the Former Liang ruling family, Zhang Dayu. Lü Guang managed to quell the revolts, and in 389, he elevated himself to King of Sanhe. He then began a war with the Western Qin in Longxi in 391, eventually managing to briefly force them into submission in 395. In 396, he finally claimed the title of Heavenly King of Great Liang.\nIn 397, intending to punish Western Qin for rebelling, Lü Guang began another campaign against them, but this time, his forces were badly routed. After this defeat, another wave of rebellions broke out in Later Liang. Most notably, the Tufa-Xianbei tribe rebelled at Lianchuan (廉川堡, in modern Haidong Prefecture, Qinghai) and founded the Southern Liang, while at Jiankang (建康, in modern Zhangye, Gansu), the Han Chinese administrator, Duan Ye, with the help of the Lushuihu Juqu tribe, established the Northern Liang. From here on, the Later Liang started to decline.\nFall\nIn 400, Lü Guang declared himself retired emperor while his eldest son to his wife, Lü Shao succeeded him as Heavenly King. However, shortly after Lü Guang died, the eldest among all of Lü Guang's son, Lü Zuan, launched a coup and forced Lü Shao to commit suicide. During his reign, Lü Zuan attacked Southern Liang and Northern Liang but to no avail. In 401, his cousin, Lü Chao had him assassinated and passed the throne to his own brother, Lü Long.\nSoon after taking power, Lü Long had many of the local leaders killed. The situation in Later Liang soon became known to the Later Qin in the east, who then laid siege onto Guzang and forced Lü Long to submit as a vassal. Later Qin bestowed Lü Long the title of Duke of Jiankang and allowed him to remain at Guzang, although they also brought back with them Kumārajīva, who had been living as a captive under Later Liang. Lü Long continued to face attacks from Southern Liang and Northern Liang. No longer able to withstand the pressure, he surrendered his entire territory to Later Qin and moved to their capital of Chang'an in 403, thus ending the Later Liang.\nLü Long served as an official under Later Qin and kept his title of Duke of Jiankang. He became a confidant to the prince, Yao Bi, who plotted to usurp the role of Crown Prince from his brother, Yao Hong. However, in 416, after a failed coup, Yao Bi committed suicide and Lü Long was executed along with his brother Lü Chao.\nRulers of the Later Liang\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Temple name\n!
