The temple is also known as Shri Sanwaliya Seth.\nLegend\nAccording to legend, in 1840, a cowherd named Bholaram dreamed of three divine idols buried beneath the ground in the Chhapar area of Bagund village. When the site was excavated, three exquisite idols of Lord Krishna were discovered, just as depicted in the dream. One idol was enshrined in Mandfiya, another in Bhadsoda, and the third remained at the original discovery site in Chhapar, Bagund. Temples were subsequently constructed at all three locations, which lie within approximately 5 kilometers of each others.\nMain Temple\nAmong the three temples, the one at Mandfiya is designated as the main shrine, also known as Sanwaliya Ji Dham (the residence of Sanwaliya). It is a major pilgrimage site for devotees coming from Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat.\nLocation\nSanwaliya Ji Temple is located 41&nbsp;km from Chittorgarh Railway Station and 65&nbsp;km from Dabok Airport. After Shrinathji Temple in Nathdwara, this is considered the second most important pilgrimage site for followers of the Vaishnav tradition.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* https://shrisanwariyaseth.org/  Official Website of Shri Sanwaliya Seth Temple"
