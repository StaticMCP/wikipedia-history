Like at least another of his brothers, he was named after a son of Ramesses II, Amun-her-khepeshef.\nHe died when he was about fifteen years old.\nHe is also mentioned as Ramesses Amun-her-khepeshef. He is not identical with his brother Ramesses VI, who was also called Amun-her-khepeshef before he became pharaoh.\nHe is depicted in his father's temple at Medinet Habu. His well preserved tomb, QV55 (in the Valley of the Queens) was excavated by Italian archaeologists in 1903–1904.\nNotes\nSources\nExternal links\n* [https://thebanmappingproject.com/tombs/qv-55-prince-amenherkhepshef Theban Mapping Project] – Plan of the tomb and other details."
