Robinson Professor in United States History at Stanford University and as a research fellow at the Hoover Institution. She previously served as assistant professor of history at the University of Virginia from 2007-2012. Her research focuses on 20th-century U.S. political, cultural history, including the history of markets, capitalism, and economic ideas.\nBurns has published major intellectual biographies of American political-economic thinkers, notably Goddess of the Market (2009) on Ayn Rand and Milton Friedman: The Last Conservative (2023). Her 2009 biography of Ayn Rand, Goddess of the Market was reviewed in outlets such as Booklist, The Washington Times, and The New York Times, generally receiving favorable reception.\nEarly life\nBurns grew up in Connecticut. She received her bachelor's degree in history from Harvard University in 1998 and her MA and PhD in history from the University of California, Berkeley.\nWorks\nWork on Ayn Rand\nGoddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right offers an examination of Rand's intellectual and political influence, while also exploring her complex personal life. Burns received access to Rand's personal archives, the Ayn Rand Papers, which helped her to provide a detailed account of Rand's rise to prominence, particularly her development of Objectivist philosophy and its enduring impact on American conservatism.\nThe book highlights Rand's important relationships, including her affair with Nathaniel Branden, who played a significant role in her intellectual circle. Burns also emphasizes Rand's contentious relationship with religious conservatism and her evolving views on libertarianism, noting how Rand's ideas have shaped and been reshaped by different movements over time. Burns' portrayal of Rand sheds light on why her philosophy continues to resonate, particularly in times of economic uncertainty, and how her life and reputation diverged from the ideals she championed.\nAs part of the promotion of the book, Burns was interviewed by Jon Stewart on The Daily Show.\nWork on Milton Friedman\nJennifer Burns' 2023 book, Milton Friedman: The Last Conservative, provides a comprehensive exploration of the life and ideas of Milton Friedman, an important figure in 20th-century economics. The book delves into Friedman's role in shaping modern economic thought, particularly his contributions to the understanding of inflation and the evolution of the economics profession. Burns portrays Friedman not just as an economist, but as a public intellectual whose advocacy for personal freedom and critique of government intervention left a lasting impact on American conservatism. Through her research, Burns traces Friedman's career from his early days in an era before mathematical modeling dominated economics, highlighting his ability to communicate complex ideas to a broader audience. The book also examines Friedman's willingness to collaborate with female economists and his readiness to promote ideas that were initially out of favor but later gained recognition. Burns situates Friedman alongside Rand, noting the parallel tracks through which both figures advanced libertarian ideas, contributing to the conservative shift in American political ideology during the 20th century.\nOne reviewer, David R. Henderson of the Cato Institute, criticizes Burns for labeling Friedman a conservative, when he would be more aptly described as a classical liberal due to some of his social views.\nHonors & awards\n* Thomas T. Hoopes Prize, Harvard University (1998)\n* Top Young Historian, History News Network (2010)\n* Fellowship for University Professors, National Endowment for the Humanities (2017-2018)\nReferences"
