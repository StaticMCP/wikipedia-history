The house was built around 1740 and documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) in 1938. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 24, 1973, for its significance in architecture and exploration/settlement.\nHistory and description\nThe Miller-Kingsland House is the oldest recorded home in Boonton. The original Dutch house was one-room with a sleeping attic, built by Johannes Miller around 1740. This room, which is complete with a large cooking fireplace and beehive oven, makes up the west wing of the current structure. The property was sold to Isaac Kingsland in 1798. He added the two and one-half story main section in 1808. It features Dutch style and a gambrel roof.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Morris County, New Jersey\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
