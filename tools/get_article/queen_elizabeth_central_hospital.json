It provides care to the surrounding district hospitals, health clinics, and private medical facilities. Officially, the hospital has 1350 beds available.\nHistory\nIn 1958, the hospital was given Queen Elizabeth II's name.\nPrior to 2017 the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital had less than ten intensive care beds. The Mercy James Institute for Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care opened in June 2017 with an official opening in the following month. It was built as the result of a partnership between the Malawian Ministry of Health and Raising Malawi which is a charity created by Madonna. Madonna has adopted four Malawian children and this unit is named after Mercy James who is one of them. The institute serves as a teaching facility for Malawian pediatric surgeons.\nIn 2024 it was noted that the hospital was delivering with limited resources to an area with high needs. Twenty or thirty surgical operations were made every day. American medical staff from the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School have an exchange with QECH staff so that they can experience this type of medical delivery.\nReferences"
