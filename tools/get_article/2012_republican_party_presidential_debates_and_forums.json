It was broadcast live for 90 minutes on Fox News, FoxNews.com, and Fox News Radio. Most of the candidates who had announced their runs at that time participated in the debate, being Herman Cain, Gary Johnson, Ron Paul, Tim Pawlenty, and Rick Santorum, making this debate the one with the fewest candidates present, with only five.\nCriteria for inclusion in the debate did not allow several other candidates, or potential candidates, to participate in the debate, including Buddy Roemer and Fred Karger, who did not meet the polling criterion of at least 1% in 5 national polls. Mitt Romney met the debate criteria, but rejected the invitation to appear in the debate. Newt Gingrich originally had planned to attend the debate, but did not meet additional criteria of forming an exploratory committee.\nThe debate was moderated by Fox News anchor Bret Baier of Special Report with Bret Baier and several other Fox News contributors, including Juan Williams, Shannon Bream, and Chris Wallace.\nAt the end of the debate, Fox News's online votes showed Ron Paul standing out from the other candidates, but businessman Herman Cain was the overwhelming choice of the Fox News focus group moderated by Frank Luntz.\n*Transcript from [http://2012election.procon.org/sourcefiles/May_5_2011_republican_debate.pdf ProCon.org] and [http://www.ronpaul.com/2012-ron-paul/debates-2012/previous/may-5-2011-greenville-south-carolina/ RonPaul.com]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr0_Xd4nX4M Complete Video from DakotaVoice]\nJune 13, 2011 – Goffstown, New Hampshire\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable floatright\"\n|-\n!

It was broadcast live for 120 minutes on CNN, WMUR-TV, and CNN.com. Candidates making their first debate -- Michele Bachmann, Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney—joined Herman Cain, Ron Paul, Tim Pawlenty and Rick Santorum.\nCriteria for inclusion in the debate did not allow several other candidates, or potential candidates, to participate in the debate, including Buddy Roemer, Gary Johnson, and Fred Karger, who did not meet the polling criterion of at least 1% in 5 national polls. Several other then-potential candidates, including Jon Huntsman, Rudy Giuliani, and Sarah Palin declined to participate in the debate.\nThe debate was moderated by CNN anchor John King of John King, USA and featured several other CNN contributors.\nFollowing the debate, attention was drawn to Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, who announced she had filed with the FEC to run for President during the debate.\n*Transcript from [https://web.archive.org/web/20110618152748/http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2011/06/republican_2012_presidential_d.html Chicago Sun-Times] and [http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1106/13/se.02.html CNN]\n*[http://www.cnn.com/video/?/video/politics/2011/06/13/gop.nh.debate.part.1.cnn Complete video from CNN] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyMZkPFSPkg DakotaVoice]\n*[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/factchecking-the-gop-debate-in-new-hampshire/2011/06/13/AGYXjGUH_blog.html Washington Post Fact Check]\nAugust 11, 2011 – Ames, Iowa\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable floatright\"\n|-\n!

It was moderated by Bret Baier with questions from Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace and the Washington Examiner's Byron York and Susan Ferrechio. Baier and Wallace were praised for their moderation of the debate.\nIt was broadcast live for two hours on Fox News and FoxNews.com. Candidates participating in the debate included Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich, Ron Paul, Tim Pawlenty, Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum and Jon Huntsman Jr. It was the first debate appearance by Huntsman, and the final appearance by Pawlenty. Criteria for inclusion in the debate did not allow several other candidates, or potential candidates, to participate in the debate, including Buddy Roemer, Gary Johnson, Thaddeus McCotter and Fred Karger, who did not meet the polling criterion of at least 1% in 5 national polls.\nThe debate was noted for the sparring between Bachmann and Pawlenty; Pawlenty criticized Bachmann for what he said was a lack of leadership, while Bachmann fired back that Pawlenty's support for cap and trade legislation and the individual mandate while governor of Minnesota made his record look like President Obama's. Gingrich criticized Wallace by saying he was asking \"gotcha questions\" instead of legitimate questions.\nRomney responded to criticisms that \"Romneycare\" (Massachusetts health care reform) was like \"Obamacare\" (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) by using a states' rights argument. Santorum said same-sex marriage is not a state issue because the 10th Amendment \"does not give states the right to trample over moral law.\" Romney agreed that it is a federal issue, reasoning that people move to different states and that marriage is a status, not an activity that takes place within the walls of a state. Huntsman and Paul reiterated their support for civil unions.\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110820233723/http://foxnewsinsider.com/2011/08/12/full-transcript-complete-text-of-the-iowa-republican-debate-on-fox-news-channel/ Fox News Transcript], [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2011/08/ames-debate-romney-bachmann-paul-huntsman-santorum-gingrich-pawlenty-cain.html reprinted in the Los Angeles Times]\n*[http://www.ronpaul.com/2011-08-11/gop-debate-tonight-in-ames-iowa-live-at-9-pm-est-on-fox-news/ Complete video on RonPaul.com]\n*[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/fact-checking-the-gop-debate-in-iowa/2011/08/11/gIQAH9PAAJ_blog.html Washington Post Fact Check]\nSeptember 7, 2011 – Simi Valley, California\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable floatright\"\n|-\n!

It was moderated by Wolf Blitzer, and was notable for being the first Tea Party debate in history. Rick Perry was booed by the audience for defending his use of an executive order to mandate young girls have the HPV vaccine, which he defended by saying, \"I will always err on the side of life\". The debate also engendered controversy when Blitzer asked Ron Paul a hypothetical question about a young man who could afford health insurance but refused to purchase any and went into a coma.

It was moderated by Chris Wallace, Bret Baier, and Megyn Kelly. The debate was only the second of the 2012 cycle to feature former governor Gary Johnson of New Mexico; he was also in the May 5, 2011 debate. This debate in particular was prominent as featuring the highest number of candidates in attendance; out of the ten major Republican candidates for the Presidential nomination, only former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty was absent, as he had already dropped out of the race at this point in time.\nThe debate engendered controversy when a pre-recorded question fielded by Army Captain Stephen Hill from Iraq via YouTube, concerning whether any one of the candidates would reinstate the recently retired \"Don't ask, don't tell\" policy excluding openly gay soldiers like himself from the US military, elicited vocal booing from a few audience members; Santorum, whose turn it was to answer a question, stated that \"I would say any type of sexual activity has no place in the military\" after the booing had subsided, and was applauded by the audience for his response. Rick Perry drew criticism from the other candidates over the Texas DREAM Act, which provides discounts for tuition prices for the children of illegal immigrants. Perry's response, that the other candidates didn't \"have a heart\" was poorly received by conservatives.\nPerry's overall performance was criticised. His speech was so garbled that Mark Hemingway of the Weekly Standard asked if he had suffered a stroke, and Brit Hume of Fox News stated that Perry, \"at a time when he needed to raise his game, I mean, he did worse, it seems to me, than he had done in previous debates.\"\nGary Johnson, who lagged in polls and media attention, made headlines and became the most searched-for candidate on Google for several hours for a joke he made towards the end of the debate, saying, \"My next-door neighbor's two dogs have created more shovel ready jobs than this administration.\"\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110924015206/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/09/22/fox-news-google-gop-2012-presidential-debate/ Fox News transcript] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20180207221814/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/09/22/fox-news-google-gop-2012-presidential-debate.html as archived on February 7, 2018]) and [https://web.archive.org/web/20110924103200/http://politisite.com/2011/09/23/transcript-fox-news-google-gop-presidential-debate-september-22-2011-orlando-florida/ Politisite transcript]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20170127113831/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKNNN0NvVrc Complete video from Fox News Channel]\n*[http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/23/fact-checking-the-g-o-p-debate-in-orlando/ New York Times Fact Check]\n*[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/fact-checking-the-gop-debate-in-orlando/2011/09/22/gIQA1DEdpK_blog.html Washington Post Fact Check]\nOctober 11, 2011 – Hanover, New Hampshire\nThe seventh Republican debate was held at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, and was sponsored by Bloomberg and The Washington Post. It was moderated by Charlie Rose with Julianna Goldman and Karen Tumulty. As Rose described it: \"This debate is different and distinctive. It is only about the economy. So we debate this evening about spending and taxes, deficit and debt, about the present and the future, about rich and poor, and about the role of government.\" Former Governor of New Mexico, Gary Johnson, was excluded from the debate.\n*[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republican-debate-transcript/2011/10/11/gIQATu8vdL_story.html Washington Post transcript], [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/us/politics/bloomberg-washington-post-republican-presidential-debate.html New York Times transcript], [https://web.archive.org/web/20111015015537/http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2011/10/bloombergwashington_post_gop_p.html Chicago Sun-Times transcript] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20111014183756/http://thepage.time.com/2011/10/11/complete-transcript-of-hanover-economic-debate/ Time transcript]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111013131548/http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republican-debate---full-video/2011/10/12/gIQAig5QeL_video.html Complete video from the Washington Post]\n*[http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/fact-checking-the-republican-debate-on-the-economy/ New York Times Fact Check]\n*[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/fact-checking-the-post-bloomberg-debate/2011/10/11/gIQAdAugdL_blog.html Washington Post Fact Check]\nOctober 18, 2011 – Paradise, Nevada\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable floatright\"\n|-\n!

It was moderated by Anderson Cooper. Jon Huntsman boycotted the debate, citing a scheduling spat between the Nevada Republican Party and the New Hampshire Republican Party over whose primaries would be held first. Gary Johnson was excluded from the debate because he did not meet CNN's eligibility requirements.\nThe debate was described as the most contentious thus far. The debate started with all the candidates criticizing the tax plan of Herman Cain (\"9-9-9\"), whose standing in national polls had recently improved considerably. Mitt Romney squared off separately with Rick Santorum and Rick Perry. Santorum attacked Romney over his health care reform initiative in Massachusetts, saying, \"You just don't have credibility... your consultants helped Obama craft Obamacare.\" Romney replied \"the Massachusetts plan... was something crafted for a state... if I'm president of the United States, I will repeal [Obamacare] for the American people\".\nPerry, whose performance was seen as an improvement over past debates, attacked Romney because he hired a lawn service using illegal immigrants; Perry said, \"The idea that you stand here before us and talk about that you're strong on immigration is on its face the height of hypocrisy.\" Romney replied that after they found out the company used illegal immigrants, they let them go, criticising Perry's tuition credit for the children of illegal immigrants, adding that \"If there's someone who has a record as governor with regards to illegal immigration that doesn't stand up to muster, it's you, not me.\". Romney also remarked that upon discovering that illegal immigrants were working on his property, he told the contractor, \"you can't have any illegals working on our property, that's... I'm running for office, for Pete's sake! I can't have illegals.\"\n*Transcript from [https://web.archive.org/web/20120119043528/http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2011/10/republican_las_vegas_cnn_debat.html Chicago Sun-Times], [http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1110/18/se.05.html CNN] and [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/us/politics/western-republican-leadership-conference-wrlc-cnn-debate-at-the-venetian-resort-hotel-casino.html?_r=1&ref=politics NYT]\n*Complete video from [http://www.2012presidentialelectionnews.com/2011/10/video-full-video-of-cnn-western-republican-debate/ 2012 Election Central] , [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qCBsi89FVs DakotaVoice] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3o_JoG_LVg Vote4Paul2012]\n*Factchecking from [http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/las-vegas-debate-fact-check/ New York Times] and [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/fact-checking-the-cnn-republican-debate-in-las-vegas/2011/10/18/gIQAHvbGwL_blog.html Washington Post]\nNovember 9, 2011 – Auburn Hills, Michigan\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable floatright\"\n|-\n!

It was moderated by Maria Bartiromo and John Harwood. It focused on the economy and was attended by Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich, Jon Huntsman, Jr., Ron Paul, Rick Perry, Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum.\nThe defining moment of the debate came when Rick Perry said that he would abolish three government departments. He named the departments of Commerce and Education, but could not remember the Department of Energy. After struggling to remember the name of the last department, Mitt Romney offered \"EPA?\", to which Perry agreed, before backing down when asked by moderator John Harwood if the EPA really was the department he was thinking of. When pressed as to what the third department was, Perry admitted that he could not remember, adding: \"Sorry. Oops.\" The gaffe came to be known as the \"Oops moment\" and was called the \"worst gaffe in US debate history\", the \"end of his campaign\" and was widely mocked in the media.\nNovember 12, 2011 – Spartanburg, South Carolina\nThe tenth Republican debate was held at Wofford College in Spartanburg, South Carolina, sponsored by CBS News, the National Journal, and the South Carolina Republican Party. It was moderated by Major Garrett and Scott Pelley. It was attended by Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich, Jon Huntsman, Jr., Ron Paul, Rick Perry, Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum. The debate focused on foreign policy and was dubbed the \"Commander-in-Chief debate\".\nRick Perry, who was looking to recover following his disastrous debate performance in Rochester, Michigan, alluded to the previous debate: moderator Scott Pelley began to ask him about his plan to abolish the Department of Energy and Perry interrupted, \"Glad you remembered it\". Pelley replied \"I've had some time to think about it\" and Perry quipped, \"So have I\", drawing laughter from the audience.\nMitt Romney and Newt Gingrich both said they would consider military action to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, a stance Ron Paul and Herman Cain disagreed with. Cain, Gingrich, Perry, Romney and Rick Santorum all supported sanctions against Iran, with only Paul and Huntsman opposing them. Cain and Bachmann supported the use of waterboarding whereas Paul and Huntsman opposed it, saying it was torture. Huntsman also called for American soldiers to be removed from Afghanistan, saying \"this nation has achieved its key objectives.\"\nPerry stated that his foreign aid budget would start at $0 for all countries, including Israel. Bachmann and Santorum criticised him for suggesting that Pakistan should get no aid at all, with Santorum saying \"we can't be indecisive about whether Pakistan is our friend. They must be our friend, and we must engage them as friends\". Bachmann drew raised eyebrows for her claim that China's economy was growing because of its lack of a social safety net, saying \"If you look at China, they don't have food stamps. They don't have the modern welfare state, and China's growing... And so what I would do is look at the programs that LBJ gave us with the Great Society and they'd be gone.\"\nRomney and Huntsman clashed over China, with Romney saying that America was in the middle of a trade war with China, who must be taken to the World Trade Organization over currency manipulation. Huntsman replied that China can't be taken to the WTO and starting a trade war with them would be bad for the American economy. The debate itself was criticised for not spending sufficient time on the Eurozone crisis, with only the very last question devoted to it, which only Huntsman was given the opportunity to answer.\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111112212643/http://www.cbsnews.com/2718-505103_162-1349.html CBS News/National Journal Debate] at CBSNews.com with transcript, [http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7388072n full video (79:39)] and fact checks\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111109224019/http://nationaljournal.com/cbs-nj-foreign-policy-debate NJ/CBS Debate: America's Security] at the National Journal\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120308005555/http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2011/11/_cbsnational_journal_gop_debat.html Transcript and complete video from the Chicago Sun-Times]\n*[http://www.2012presidentialelectionnews.com/2011/11/video-watch-the-entire-cbs-news-gop-debate-from-south-carolina/ Complete video from 2012 Election Central]\n*Factchecking from [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/fact-checking-the-south-carolina-debate/2011/11/13/gIQAFKzVIN_blog.html The Washington Post]\nNovember 22, 2011 – Washington, D.C.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable floatright\"\n|-\n!

Herman Cain was widely regarded to be a \"loser\", with \"nothing of interest or insight to add on national security, and it showed\".

It was moderated by Diane Sawyer and George Stephanopoulos. Candidates in attendance were Michele Bachmann, Newt Gingrich, Ron Paul, Rick Perry, Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum. Jon Huntsman, Jr. was not invited as he did not meet the criteria.\nNewt Gingrich was attacked by all the other candidates, squaring off in particular with Mitt Romney. Romney mocked Gingrich's plan to build a lunar colony to mine minerals from the Moon, saying that the real difference between the two of them was their backgrounds, saying \"I spent my life in the private sector. I know how the economy works.\" Gingrich replied, \"Let's be candid. The only reason you didn't become a career politician is you lost to Teddy Kennedy in 1994\", which drew boos and laughter from the audience. Romney replied \"If I'd have beaten Ted Kennedy I could have been a career politician, that's probably true. If I would've been able to get in the NFL like I hoped when I was a kid, I would have been a football star all my life too\", which drew laughter and applause.\nPerhaps the most notable moment of the debate was a \"rare error\" from Romney when discussing Massachusetts health care reform with Rick Perry. After Perry repeated his assertion that Romney had deleted a line about individual mandates being a model for the nation from reprints of his book, Romney offered Perry a $10,000 bet that he had done no such thing, which Perry declined. Romney's offer was derided as being \"out of touch\" and \"elitist\". Other commentators came to his defence, however, calling it a \"non-story\", remarking that \"you have to say a large amount, because the point is that you know you're not going to lose it\" and \"I am willing to bet $10,000 that ordinary viewers barely even noticed Romney's bet until the punditocracy decided to make it the defining moment of the debate.\"\n*Transcript from [https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/full-transcript-abc-news-iowa-republican-debate/story?id=15134849#.TuWPr7LNlGU ABC News] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20120119044243/http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2011/12/mitts_10000_bet_at_abc_news_de.html Chicago Sun-Times]\n*[http://www.2012presidentialelectionnews.com/2011/12/video-watch-the-entire-abc-newsyahoo-iowa-republican-debate/ 2012 Election Central video]\n*Factchecking from [https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/12/fact-checking-the-debate-in-iowa/ ABC News] and [https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2011-12-11/iowa-republican-debate-fact-check/51810372/1 USA Today]\nDecember 15, 2011 – Sioux City, Iowa\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable floatright\"\n|-\n!

Once again, Newt Gingrich came in for criticism from all the other candidates, particularly from Michele Bachmann, with special focus given to his opinion of Government-sponsored enterprise and the $1.6 million he received from Freddie Mac. Gingrich responded that Bachmann's relationship with the facts was dubious.\nRon Paul again clashed with Bachmann and Rick Santorum over foreign policy and Rick Perry expressed a desire to be \"the Tim Tebow of the Iowa caucuses\". Bachmann claimed that after the previous debate, PolitiFact.com \"came out and said that everything that I said was true\", which prompted the fact-checking website to label her claim as \"pants on fire\", saying \"that's simply not the case\".\n*Transcript from [http://historymusings.wordpress.com/2011/12/16/full-text-campaign-buzz-december-15-2011-fox-news-gop-iowa-debate-transcript-republican-presidential-candidates-debate-sioux-city-iowa/ History Musings]\n*[http://www.2012presidentialelectionnews.com/2011/12/video-watch-the-fox-news-iowa-gop-debate-from-sioux-city/ Complete video from 2012 Election Central]\n*Factchecking from [https://web.archive.org/web/20111219153259/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57344030/republican-presidential-debate-fact-check/ CBS News/AP], [https://web.archive.org/web/20111216201358/http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/12/16/truth-squad-part-of-the-cnn-republican-debate-fact-checking-series/ CNN], [https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fact-check-gingrich-off-on-his-budget-history/ Fox News/AP], [http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2011/12/16/debate-fact-check-bachmann Minnesota Public Radio/AP], [http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/16/iowa-debate-fact-check/ New York Times], [https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2011-12-16/fact-check-iowa-debate/52007354/1 USA Today]\nJanuary 7, 2012 – Goffstown, New Hampshire\nThe fourteenth Republican debate was hosted by ABC News and WMUR-TV and was held at Saint Anselm College in Goffstown, New Hampshire. It was moderated by Diane Sawyer, George Stephanopoulos and Josh McElveen. Candidates in attendance were Newt Gingrich, Jon Huntsman, Jr., Ron Paul, Rick Perry, Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum.\nRick Santorum, who was enjoying a surge in the polls following his narrow second-place finish in the Iowa Caucuses, clashed with Mitt Romney over comments he had made that the country didn't need a CEO or manager as President. Santorum said, \"We need a leader... someone who, has the experience to go out and be the commander-in-chief... The commander-in-chief of this country isn't a CEO. It's someone who has to lead... being the president is not a CEO... You've got to lead and inspire.\" Romney responded, \"I think people who spend their life in Washington don't understand what happens out in the real economy. They think that people who start businesses are just managers. The chance to lead in free enterprise is extraordinarily critical to also being able to lead a state, like I led in Massachusetts and, by the way, lead the Olympics. My experience is in leadership.\" Newt Gingrich then criticised Romney's record at Bain Capital, saying \"I'm very much for free enterprise... I'm not nearly as enamored of a Wall Street model where you can flip companies, you can go in and have leveraged buyouts, you can basically take out all the money, leaving behind the workers.\" Romney replied, \"I'm not surprised to have The New York Times try and put free enterprise on trial. I'm not surprised to have the Obama administration do that, either. It's a little surprising from my colleagues on this stage.\"\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable floatright\"\n|-\n! Candidate !!

He called Santorum a \"big government, big spending individual\", citing Santorum's votes to raise the debt ceiling, for the No Child Left Behind Act, for the Medicare Modernization Act and against Right-to-work. Santorum replied, \"I'm a conservative. I'm not a libertarian. I believe in some government. I do believe that... as a senator from Pennsylvania that I had a responsibility to go out there and represent the interests of my state.\" Moderator Josh McElveen asked Paul if he stood by comments that Gingrich was a \"chicken hawk\" for not serving in the military. When Paul said that he did, Gingrich said, \"Dr. Paul has a long history of saying things that are inaccurate and false. The fact is, I never asked for deferment. I was married with a child. It was never a question.\" Paul replied, \"When I was drafted, I was married and had two kids, and I went\", which was greeted with applause.\nRomney got into a long discussion with moderator George Stephanopoulos over whether states have the right to ban contraception or whether that was trumped by a constitutional right to privacy. Romney said, \"So you're asking, given the fact that there's no state that wants to do so and I don't know of any candidate that wants to do so, you're asking could it constitutionally be done? We can ask our constitutionalist here,\" gesturing to Ron Paul, which drew laughter and applause from the audience. The discussion continued until Romney grew frustrated at the repeated questioning and asserted, \"States don't want to ban contraception. So why would we try and put it in the Constitution?... Contraception, it's working just fine, just leave it alone.\" Stephanopoulos later joked on The Colbert Report that he had a bet with fellow moderator Diane Sawyer that he could get Romney to say \"contraceptions are working just fine\". Jon Huntsman, in response to a question on civil unions, joked, \"I'm a married man. I've been married for 28 years. I have seven kids. Glad we're off the contraception discussion.\"\nOther memorable moments from the \"lively\" debate came when Gingrich accused the media of bias for ignoring \"anti-Christian bigotry\"; Paul was asked whether he would rule out a third party bid for the White House and he responded that he wouldn't, saying \"I don't like absolutes\" but adding \"I have no plans to do it. I don't intend to do it\"; Rick Perry said that he would \"send troops back into Iraq\", adding \"we're going to see Iran, in my opinion, move back in at literally the speed of light. They're going to move back in and all of the work that we've done, every young man that has lost his life in that country will have been for nothing because we've got a president that does not understand what's going on in that region\" and Santorum said that \"there are no classes in America.\"\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120119041845/http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2012/01/gop_nh_abcyahoo_news_debate_tr.html Transcript from the Chicago Sun-Times]\n*[http://www.2012presidentialelectionnews.com/2012/01/video-watch-the-full-abc-new-hampshire-gop-debate/ Complete video from 2012 Election Central]  and on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNSUWxeb7EE YouTube /w Closed Captioning]\n*Factchecking from [https://web.archive.org/web/20120109005046/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57354732/fact-checking-the-weekends-gop-debates/ CBS News/AP], [https://archive.today/20130102065411/http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2012/01/08/truth-squad-fact-checking-the-gop-debate-4/ CNN], [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/fact-checking-the-abc-news-and-meet-the-press-debates/2012/01/08/gIQAs2MVjP_blog.html The Washington Post]\nJanuary 8, 2012 – Concord, New Hampshire\nThe fifteenth Republican debate was hosted by NBC News and Facebook and was held in Concord, New Hampshire.

King had stated that the morning of the debate had five podiums, but Perry dropping out the morning of, brought it to four .\nThe debate is famous due to the fact that Newt Gingrich spent three minutes yelling at the moderator at the beginning of the debate after Gingrich was asked to respond to his ex-wife's claim that Gingrich had proposed an open marriage to her in 1999 while he had been carrying on an affair. Gingrich felt that the question was an extremely unfair way to begin a presidential debate and was an attempt to protect President Barack Obama. The incident resulted in a great amount of applause for Gingrich, and was widely broadcast on YouTube. It was also credited with raising Gingrich's support in South Carolina, leading to his win in that state's primary two days later.\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120123031224/http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2012/01/south_carolina_gop_cnn_debate_.html Transcript from The Chicago Sun-Times]\n*[http://www.2012presidentialelectionnews.com/2012/01/video-watch-the-full-cnn-southern-republican-debate/ Complete video from 2012 Election Central]  and from [https://web.archive.org/web/20120123032757/http://electad.com/videos/republican-presidential-debate-cnn-january-19-2012/ ElectAd] and on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-fU-knxT0U YouTube /w Closed Captioning]\n*Factchecking from [https://web.archive.org/web/20120109005046/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57354732/fact-checking-the-weekends-gop-debates/ CBS News/AP], [https://web.archive.org/web/20120120235423/http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2012/01/20/truth-squad-3-checks-on-thursdays-gop-debate/ CNN], [http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/19/charleston-s-c-debate-fact-check/ New York Times], [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/fact-checking-the-cnn-debate-in-charleston/2012/01/19/gIQALs8dCQ_blog.html The Washington Post]\nJanuary 23, 2012 – Tampa, Florida\nThe eighteenth Republican debate was held in Tampa, Florida.

The debate focused mainly on foreign policy and was described as \"a debate that even the participants more or less admitted was boring enough to induce narcolepsy in a chronic insomniac\" and \"less a debate than a think-tank-style discussion of the issues and so dry that reporters fell asleep.

Both debates were produced in conjunction with Project White House and Jim Nintzel of the Tucson Weekly.\n: The first debate, held on the 18th at 8 pm MST, produced by Illegal Knowledge and hosted by [http://maassive.com/ Dave Maass] of San Diego CityBeat, had nine participants, composed of eight lesser known Republican candidates (Donald Benjamin, Simon Bollander, Cesar Cisneros, Kip Dean, Sarah Gonzales, Al \"Dick\" Perry, Charles Skelley and Jim Terr) and one Green Party candidate (Michael Oatman). A press release regarding this first debate was distributed which invited all candidates listed on either Republican or Green Party ballots in Arizona to the first debate, although none of the major Republican or Green Party candidates appeared.\n: The second debate, held on the 19th at 7pm MST, produced by [http://accesstucson.org/ Access Tucson]   and hosted by both [http://maassive.com/ Dave Maass] of San Diego CityBeat and Amanda Hurley of [http://journalism.arizona.edu/ The University of Arizona School of Journalism], was restricted only to Republican candidates and featured seven of the eight lesser known Republican candidates from the previous night (less Cesar Cisneros).\n: Two lesser known candidates appearing in the first debate, Sarah Gonzales (who placed sixth) and Michael Oatman (who placed tied for third), placed ahead of their better known Republican and Green Party counterparts (Buddy Roemer and Gerard Davis respectively) in the Arizona Presidential Preference Election Results from February 28, 2012.\n:*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTajGGq0kBw Video of First Debate]\n:*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI3sHRmEZRo Video of Second Debate]\n:*Project White House Debates\nCancelled Ion Television/Newsmax debate\nReal estate developer and media personality Donald Trump was announced as moderator for a debate sponsored by Newsmax Media and broadcast on Ion Television, scheduled for December 27, 2011 in Des Moines, Iowa. The role of Trump, who very publicly considered running for president in the spring of 2011, as moderator attracted controversy as candidates and observers questioned the seriousness of Trump and whether he was doing it as a publicity stunt.\nNewt Gingrich and Rick Santorum were the only candidates to accept the invitation to participate. The campaigns of Jon Huntsman and Ron Paul both released statements declining the invitation. Ron Paul's campaign wrote, \"Mr. Trump's participation will contribute to an unwanted circus-like atmosphere,\" while Jon Huntsman's campaign said in a statement, \"We have declined to participate in the 'Presidential Apprentice' Debate with The Donald,\" alluding to the Celebrity Apprentice reality show for which Trump is host. Trump responded, \"Few people take Ron Paul seriously and many of his views and presentation make him a clown-like candidate. I am glad he and Jon Huntsman, who has inconsequential poll numbers or a chance of winning, will not be attending the debate and wasting the time of the viewers who are trying very hard to make a very important decision.\"\nMitt Romney announced on December 6 that he also would not be attending the debate. On December 8, Rick Perry and Michele Bachmann announced they would not be attending either. Furthermore, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said that a debate moderated by Trump would be problematic.\nSpeaking about the host, Santorum said, \"I'm not defending Newsmax's decision to put Donald Trump in there. If you look at the [[#November 9, 2011 – Auburn Hills, Michigan|]] where Jim Cramer is screaming at people&nbsp;– maybe Donald will surprise us both.\" On December 13, Trump withdrew as moderator and the debate was canceled.\nComplaints of bias\nThroughout the early debates, there have been a wide range of complaints about the various criteria hosting organizations have used to determine which candidates are allowed in the debates.\nDavid Weigel of Slate magazine coined the term the \"Gary Johnson Rule\" (or the \"Anti-Gary Johnson Rule\") to refer to the deliberate construction of rules by 2012 presidential debate organizers to include eight specific, pre-determined candidates while excluding others. The phrase refers specifically to the various rules created to outline who will be allowed to participate in the 2012 GOP presidential debates. Variations of these rules have been used to exclude Johnson from all but two debates during the 2012 presidential cycle and to completely exclude other candidates.\nOn November 15, Gary Johnson's campaign filed an official complaint with the FEC and FCC over exclusion from the November 12th CBS Debate, claiming that his exclusion shows media favoritism.  According to the complaint, free publicity provided by a media outlet on public airwaves may be considered a political donation if not equally distributed between candidates running for office. On December 28, Gary Johnson announced that he was ending his quest for the Republican nomination and would instead seek the Libertarian nomination, citing his exclusion from the debates as one reason for doing so.\nAfter the CBS/National Journal debate in Spartanburg, South Carolina, both the Bachmann and Paul campaigns issued statements alleging bias from the debate.\nSee also\n*Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012\n*Prelude to the Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012\n*Results of the Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20181226210807/http://debatestats.com/ Debate Statistics from the 2012 Republican debates]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120107102352/http://www.2012presidentialelectionnews.com/2012-debate-schedule/2011-2012-primary-debate-schedule 2012 Primary Debate Schedule « 2012 Election Central]\n*[http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-debates/index.html Republican Presidential Debates] Fox News\n*[http://projects.WSJ.com/campaign2012/delegates/ Interactive map, tracking GOP delegates nationally and by state, over time]  The Wall Street Journal\n*[http://www.fec.gov/press/press2011/presidential_form2nm.shtml 2012 Presidential Form 2 Filers] (i.e. official candidates) at the Federal Election Commission (FEC)"
