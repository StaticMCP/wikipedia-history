His forces advanced along the Pshada River, where they encountered a coalition of Circassian warriors led by Némire Shubs. A battle ensued near the river, resulting in a decisive Circassian victory.\nAccording to historical sources, Dawlet-Girey II was captured but later released. Some accounts describe that, as a symbolic act of humiliation, he was placed on a camel facing its tail before being sent back to the Crimean Khanate.\nReferences"
