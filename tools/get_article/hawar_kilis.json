It is located between Azaz and Al-Rai, on the Queiq Plain, some  north of the city of Aleppo, and just  south of the border with the Turkish province of Kilis.\nThe village administratively belongs to Nahiya Sawran in Azaz District. Nearby localities include Zayzafun  to the west and Baraghida  to the south.\nDemographics\nIn the 2004 census, Hawar Kilis had a population of 438. The village is inhabited by Turkmen.
