Although Tomislav Nikolić of the Serbian Radical Party received the most votes, the elections were invalidated as voter turnout was just 39%, less than the 50% threshold required by electoral law. As a result, fresh elections were held in June 2004.\nTwo days after the election, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia coalition was dissolved.\nResults\nReferences"
