The population was 1,781 at the 2010 census. Warroad had its own newspaper before it was incorporated in 1901.\nMinnesota State Highways 11 and 313 are two of the city's main routes.\nHistory\nWarroad was once one of the largest Ojibwe villages on Lake of the Woods. The Ojibwe fought a long war against the Sioux for the lake's rice fields. Occupying the prairies of the Red River Valley, the Sioux often invaded the territory by way of the Red and Roseau Rivers, a route that ended at the mouth of the Warroad River. This was the old \"war road\" from which the river and village derive their name.\nIn the 20th century, Warroad had a strong commercial fishing industry, which gradually turned to sport fishing and tourism. For many years, commercial boats provided regular service to the islands and to Kenora, Ontario, at the north end of Lake of the Woods.  The lumber industry also boomed, bringing the Great Northern and Canadian National railways to town and seeing the beginning of one of the largest window manufacturers, Marvin Windows.\nWarroad is also called \"Hockeytown USA\" for its strong hockey tradition. The Warroad High School program has earned four men's state championship titles (1994, 1996, 2003, 2005) and four women's (2010, 2011, 2022, 2023) over 20 years, and has produced NHL and Olympic players. No U.S. Hockey Olympic men's team has won a gold medal without a player from Warroad. Another important piece of Warroad hockey history is the Warroad Lakers amateur team, which existed from 1947 to 1997.\nGeography\nWarroad is along the southwest shore of Lake of the Woods at Muskeg Bay, east of Roseau and west of Baudette. Warroad is 7.5 miles south of Canada.
