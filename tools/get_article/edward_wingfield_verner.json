      "text": "# Edward Wingfield Verner\n\nSir Edward Wingfield Verner, 4th Baronet (1 October 1830 – 21 June 1899) was a Conservative Party politician in Ireland who sat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom from 1863 to 1880.\nVerner was the second son of Sir William Verner, Bt (1782–1871) and his wife Harriet Wingfield. He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. He married Selina Florence, daughter of Thomas Vesey Nugent, on 15 December 1864.\nVerner was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Lisburn in 1863.  He contested a by-election in February of that year, and was narrowly defeated by the Liberal Party candidate, industrialist John Doherty Barbour. However, that result was overturned on petition and at a second by-election in June he won the seat by 151 votes to Barbour's 90.\nVerner held the Lisburn seat until 1873. His father William had been one of the two MPs for County Armagh, and on William's death Edward resigned his seat to stand in the by-election for Armagh. He was elected unopposed, and re-elected with a generous majority in 1874. He stood down at the 1880 general election, when his nephew William Edward was defeated by the Liberal candidate James Nicholson Richardson.\nOutside of Parliament, Verner was High Sheriff of County Dublin in 1866. He lived at Corke Abbey, County Wicklow, and died on 21 June 1899.\nArms\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
