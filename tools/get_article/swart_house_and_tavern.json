It consists of a long, 2-story, rectangular gable-roofed structure with a -story rear wing. The rear wing was built about 1750 and the building was substantially enlarged about 1792 in the Federal style.  Also on the property is a stone masonry smokehouse.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.\nBorn in the Schoharie Valley in 1718, Adam Swart did not move to Schenectady until his marriage to Catherine Van Patten in 1742. Their son Nicholas built the Swart Tavern in the late 18th century, a building which is still standing, but no longer in use as a tavern. A circa 1840 painting of the Swart Tavern is also on display.\nReferences"
