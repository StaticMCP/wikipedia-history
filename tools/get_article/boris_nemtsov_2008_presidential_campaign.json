Nemtsov believed that the only way for the opposition to have a chance at defeating the establishment in the presidential election was for it to ultimately unite around a single candidate. He had previously unsuccessfully attempted to coalesce the opposition into a coalition during the preceding 2007 Russian legislative election. It was rumored that his Union of Right Forces might ultimately seek a coalition with Mikhail Kasyanov's Russian People's Democratic Union for the presidential election. In addition, the Union of Right Forces also sought to see the opposition coalesce behind a single candidate for the presidential election.\nAt a party meeting on 23 November 2007, the Union of Right Forces declared that Nemtsov would be their nominee.\nIn late November Nemtsov was detained at a rally protesting the legislative elections as having been unfair.\nNemtsov was formally nominated by the Union of Right Forces on 18 December 2007.\nRussian television news media, both regional and national, under the influence of the Kremlin, attacked Nemtsov.\nOn 26 December 2007, Nemtsov withdrew his candidacy for the 2008 presidential election, saying that he did not want to draw votes away from the other candidate of the \"democratic opposition\", Mikhail Kasyanov. Nemtsov also had declared that he would no longer run, in part, due to his belief that the government had predetermined the election's winner.\nReferences"
