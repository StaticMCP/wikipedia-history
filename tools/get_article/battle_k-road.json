      "text": "# Battle K-Road\n\nis a one-on-one fighting arcade video game developed by Psikyo in 1993 and released as well as published under Jaleco's partnership in Japan for the arcades in 1994.\nGameplay\nScreenshot of Battle K-Road\nThe game focuses mostly on reality fighting rather than fictional fighting. At the start of the game in one-player mode, the player will face against the other fighter that uses the same fighting style as the one the player chose. After the player wins against the opponent, the player will face against other opponents that use other fighting styles in the K-Road Tournament. If the player loses, the game will only allow the player to continue fighting through it with the character he used, and will not allow the player to choose another character.\nThe gameplay has a 6-button layout, but with command inputs different compared to ones in most fighting games released at the time. There are three punches and kicks for a few directions (weak, medium and strong). There are seven fighting styles featured in the game and two playable characters per style, for a total of 14 playable fighters.\nFighters\nKarate\n*  Anthony Hawk\n*  Masamichi Ohyama\nBoxing\n*  Rick Simpson\n*  Jeff Howard\nMuay Thai\n*  Shinsaku Maekawa\n*  John Anderson\nCommando Sambo\n*  Wolf\n*  Dan\nMixed martial arts\n* Cyborg D-9F\n*  Cyborg T-8P\nSumo\n*  Mitsuji Tanimachi\n*  Harimaoh\nJujutsu\n*  Tyssa Willing\n*  Yuki Fujiwara\nOther\n* Mr. Bear - the final boss of the game.
