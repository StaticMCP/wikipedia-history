Partially owned by several entities and maintained by the National Park Service (NPS), the park commemorates the heritage of the world's preeminent whaling port during the nineteenth century.\nEstablished in 1996, the park encompasses 34 acres (fourteen hectares) dispersed over 13 city blocks. It includes a visitor center, the New Bedford National Historic Landmark District, the New Bedford Whaling Museum, the Seamen's Bethel, the schooner Ernestina, and the Rotch–Jones–Duff House and Garden Museum. The only parts owned by the NPS are the Visitor Center and the Corson Maritime Learning Center.\nThe park is a historic district administered under a partnership between the NPS, the City of New Bedford, and private building owners to preserve the historic landscapes, structures, and collections and promote research and educational programming associated with the history of whaling.\nThe enabling legislation also established a formal affiliation with the Iñupiat Heritage Center in Utqiaġvik, Alaska, to commemorate the 2,000-plus whaling voyages from New Bedford to the Western Arctic.\nThe city markets the park as \"New England's real seaport\", drawing a distinction with Connecticut's Mystic Seaport Museum, which is a collection of historic buildings and vessels moved from various other locations throughout the region.\nThe Whaleman Memorial stands two blocks west of the park, at the corner of William and Pleasant Streets in front of the New Bedford Public Library.\nImage:New Bedford Whaling National Historical Benjamin Rodman Mansion 2006.jpg|Benjamin Rodman Mansion\nImage:New Bedford Whaling National Historical Dover St 2006.jpg|Dover Street\nImage:New Bedford Whaling National Historical Rotch Jones House 2006.jpg|Rotch-Jones House\nSee also\n*Merrill's Wharf Historic District\n*New Bedford Whaling Museum\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in New Bedford, Massachusetts\nExternal links\n*[https://www.nps.gov/nebe/index.htm National Park Service: New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park]\n*[http://www.whalingmuseum.org/ New Bedford Whaling Museum]\n*[http://www.ernestina.org/ The Schooner Ernestina]"
