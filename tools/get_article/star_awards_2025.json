The ceremony was held on 6 July 2025 with Channel 8, Channel U airing the show and simulcast on mewatch and YouTube. The ceremony was the first to be held outside April since the revision of the nomination period in 2008, as it was announced to be postponed to 6 July on its initial announcement on 11 February; it was planned to be scheduled in July for this special occasion.\nBackground\nStar Awards 2025 marked the 30th anniversary of the annual Singaporean television awards ceremony, themed \"Walking Through Time Together.\" The event celebrated three decades of local entertainment, reflecting on past milestones, present achievements, and future aspirations. This milestone edition highlighted the enduring bond between Mediacorp and its audiences, featuring a star-studded lineup of local and international artistes who came together to honour the contributions of Singapore's media professionals.\nAs with previous ceremonies, the Walk of Fame was aired first at 5pm, before the ceremony commenced at 7pm. The Backstage Live ran concurrently on MeWatch and YouTube, with the ceremony starting at 3.30pm until the ceremony ended. For the first time since 2018, a half-hour Post Party ceremony was held after the ceremony ended.\nNew award categories\nWith BYD joining as a new presenter for Star Awards 2025, two fan-voted categories — Favourite Male and Female Character — were revealed during the Red Carpet show on 6 July 2025. Voting officially closed on 15 June 2025. A voter would be selected via a lucky draw to win a BYD Sealion 7 vehicle.\nPresenters and performers\nOn 18 June 2025, it was announced that Chantalle Ng would co-host the ceremony along with Guo Liang.
