He was traded to Collingwood in 1998 and the following season missed a lot of football after suffering a foot stress fracture.\nCollingwood off-loaded King after the 1999 season, so they could get a ruckman in Steven McKee to their club. He broke a leg in his first year at Richmond but re-established his place in the team during the 2001 season and was a member of their finals campaign. King appeared in the Preliminary Final loss to Brisbane and performed admirably with 21 disposals.\nKing headed to South Australian National Football League (SANFL) club South Adelaide in 2004 and won the Club's best and fairest award, the Knuckey Cup. In 2005, he struggled with regularly being tagged and left the club and headed home to Melbourne at the end of the season. He is currently an assistant coach for Keysborough in the Mornington Peninsula Football League.\nHis father, Derek, was a league footballer at St Kilda, and Liston Trophy winner in the Victorian Football Association.\nReferences\n*\n*Holmesby, Russell and Main, Jim (2007).
