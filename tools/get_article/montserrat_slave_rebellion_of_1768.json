By the late 1760s, as a result of dwindling provisions, labour shortages, and increasingly strict oversight, slaves faced worsening living conditions.\nUprising\nBy 1768, slaves outnumbered white colonists by three to one, and black and creole Montserratians, led by the slave Cudjoe, decided to stage an uprising against the plantation owners. 17 March was chosen as the day of the uprising as the rebels knew that their Anglo-Irish enslavers would be drinking heavily for St Patrick's Day.\nThe rebels planned for domestic slaves at Government House to seize any weapons held there while other slaves would arm themselves with rocks, farm tools, clubs and homemade swords, but the plot was disclosed by a slave to an Irishwoman, leading to a successful quashing of the rebellion.\nRepercussions\nNine rebels, including Cudjoe, were hanged, and his head placed on a silk-cotton tree as a warning to slaves considering another revolt. Thirty other rebels were imprisoned and then sold to other islands.\nCultural legacy\nThe uprising was forgotten until 1971 when Montserratian scholars discovered references to the rebellion and began to publicise it. In 1985, the Government of Montserrat declared 17 March a national holiday. St Patrick's Day is now the centrepoint of a ten day festival honouring the rebellion and its members.\nIn 2018, Montserratian playwright Chadd Cumberbatch wrote and directed a new play, 1768, as a theatrical re-imagining of the uprising to mark the 250th anniversary of the events.\nReferences\nSources\n* Bush, B.
