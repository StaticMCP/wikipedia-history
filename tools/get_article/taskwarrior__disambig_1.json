It uses a command-line interface, although since its inception, graphical user interface wrappers have also been created.\nTaskwarrior uses concepts and techniques described in Getting Things Done by David Allen, but is paradigm-agnostic in that it does not require users to adhere to any given life-management philosophy.\nAccording to its author, Taskwarrior was created \"to address layout and feature issues\" in the Todo.txt applications popularized by Gina Trapani.\nThe authors offer an accompanying tool called Timewarrior for tracking time spent on projects. Configuration allows e. g. to define recurring breaks such as lunch time. The documentation notes that \"Timewarrior focuses on accurately recording time already spent, whereas Taskwarrior looks forward to work that is not yet done.\"\nTaskwarrior's source code is a free and open-source software and can be either compiled from source code to run on a variety of architectures and operating systems, or installed as a binary, which is available on many Linux distribution binary repositories.\nTypical Workflow\nTaskwarrior comprises three main commands: add, list, and done. All other functionality – recurrences, tags, priorities, etc. – are optional.\nAdding a task\n$ task add Pick up keys to the new apartment\nCreated task 1.\nListing Tasks\n$ task list\nID Project Pri Due Active Age    Description\n1                        4 secs Pick up keys to the new apartment\n1 task\nMarking a task as completed\n$ task 1 done\nCompleted 1 'Pick up keys to the new apartment'.\nMarked 1 task as done.\nCreating a task with due dates, recurrences, and tags\n$ task add Mow the lawn project:Lawnwork due:tomorrow recur:biweekly +home\nCreated task 1.\nSyncing\nWhen used in conjunction with Taskserver, can sync tasks into the cloud, and indirectly with other clients/devices.\nAccolades\n* Issue 124 of the UK Linux Format magazine (November 2009) featured Taskwarrior in its Hot Picks section.\n* RadioTux Talk #137 (July 2011, German) chose Taskwarrior as Hot Pick\n* FLOSS Weekly dedicated episode 175 (July 2011) to Taskwarrior\n* Linux Voice featured a tutorial on Taskwarrior\nSee also\n* Comparison of time-tracking software\n* Getting Things Done\n* Time management\n* Task management\n* Org-mode\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior GitHub]"
