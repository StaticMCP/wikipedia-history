Most survivors were paralysed.\n|-\n!Jesse William Lazear\n|\n|\n|The 34-year-old American physician was convinced that mosquitoes were carriers for yellow fever. He allowed himself to be bitten by multiple mosquitoes and died days later from the disease.\n|-\n!Victims of the Thanksgiving Day Disaster\n|\n|\n|During the 1900 Big Game between the California Golden Bears and the Stanford Cardinal American football teams, a large crowd of people who did not want to pay the $1 () admission fee gathered upon the roof of a glass blowing factory to watch for free. The roof then collapsed, severing fuel pipes and causing at least 100 people to fall four stories to the factory floor. 60 to 100 more people fell directly on top of a furnace, the surface temperature of which was estimated to be around 500&nbsp;°F (260&nbsp;°C). 23 people were killed, and over 100 more were injured. The disaster remains the deadliest accident at a sporting event in U.S. history.\n|-\n!James Doyle Jr.\n|\n|\n|The lineworker in Smartsville, California, was killed by an electric shock through a telephone receiver after a broken power line came in contact with the telephone wire.\n|-\n!R. Stanton Walker\n|\n|\n|The 20-year-old was watching an amateur baseball game in Morristown, Ohio when a foul ball struck him in the hand, driving a knife he was passing to one of his friends into his chest. His friends asked if he was hurt and he said \"not much\", but the wound soon began to bleed heavily and he died within minutes.\n|-\n!Ed Delahanty\n|\n|\n|The 35-year-old American baseball player for the Phillies died after being removed from a train due to drunken horseplay, falling off International Bridge below Niagara Falls. Sam Kingston, a local night watchman, was the last to see him alive, reportedly scuffling with him. Kingston's account of the incident was spotty and inconsistent; it is unclear whether Delahanty was intentionally pushed, accidentally fell, or decided to jump.\n|-\n!Mary Ellen Rumble\n|\n|\n|The daughter of a farmer in Watervale near Murrumburrah in New South Wales was killed when one of a group of horses attempting to escape from a paddock knocked her down, causing her neck to snap.\n|-\n!Archibald Anderson\n|\n|\n|The 19-year-old was bathing in the Yarra River when a tooth plate fell out and got lodged in his throat, choking him to death.\n|-\n!Thomas Selfridge\n|\n|\n|Thomas Selfridge and Orville Wright were presenting the 1908 Wright Military Flyer to the US Army Signal Corps Division at Fort Myer. The plane made 41⁄2 rounds around the Fort before running into problems and crashing. Selfridge fractured his skull and died three hours later, becoming the first person to die in the crash of a powered aircraft.\n|-\n!Dietrich von Hülsen-Haeseler\n|\n|\n|The Chief of the German Imperial Military Cabinet suffered a heart attack and died aged 56 after giving a ballet performance to Kaiser Wilhelm II and other members of a hunting party staying at Donaueschingen Palace. Shortly after ending his recital with a bow, he collapsed and was pronounced dead at the scene. The circumstances of his death were covered up by military officials so as not to further inflame public outrage over the Eulenburg affair, a government scandal dealing with accusations of homosexual behavior against members of the Kaiser's cabinet and entourage.\n|-\n!Doc Powers\n|\n|\n|The 38-year-old American Major League Baseball player ran into a wall while chasing a foul ball during a Boston Red Sox-Philadelphia Athletics game at Philadelphia's Shibe Park, on 12 April 1909. He died from internal injuries and gangrene two weeks later.\n|-\n!Ada Gregory\n|\n|\n|The 52-year-old widow in Bentleigh, Victoria, who had been suffering from \"fits of melancholia\", began convulsing after rubbing powder on her teeth and asking her two children to take some medicine, which they did not do. She was believed to have taken strychnine.\n|-\n!Sigmund Neuberger\n|\n|\n| The 40-year-old German magician, better known as \"The Great Lafayette\", was so devastated by the death of his pet dog Beauty that he arranged burial for her with the Edinburgh City Council at Piershill Cemetery, under the condition that he would also be buried next to her when he died. Lafayette reportedly proclaimed that he would not live much longer after Beauty's death. Four days later, he was performing at the Empire Palace Theatre in Edinburgh, Scotland, when a fire broke out and engulfed the stage within minutes. The audience, thinking that this was all part of the illusion, did not evacuate until the theatre manager signaled for the orchestra to play God Save the King. Two days after the fire, Lafayette's body double was misidentified as Lafayette himself until his real body was identified a day later and was buried per his wishes. Other than Lafayette, ten other people also died in the disaster.\n|-\n!Franz Reichelt\n|\n|\n|The 33-year-old tailor and inventor leaped from the Eiffel Tower wearing a parachute made from cloth, his own invention, and fell  to his death. He was asked by friends and authorities to use a dummy for the feat, but declined, saying \"I intend to prove the worth of my invention\".

She suffered a fractured skull, a concussion, and internal injuries and died in the Epsom Cottage Hospital 4 days later.\n|-\n!Victims of the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916\n|\n|\n|Between 1 and 12 July 1916, four people were killed and one critically injured by a shark attack at Jersey Shore, New Jersey. Before 1916, American scholars and scientific community doubted that sharks would fatally wound a living person in the temperate waters of the northeastern United States without provocation. The attack led to a wave of panic that led to shark hunts aimed at eradicating the population of \"man-eating\" sharks, and entered into American popular culture, serving as an inspiration of the novel Jaws and its film adaptation.\n|-\n!Grigori Rasputin\n|\n| 30December [O.S.17December] 1916\n|The 47-year-old Russian mystic died of three gunshot wounds, one of which was a close-range shot to his forehead. Little is certain about his death beyond this, and the circumstances of his death have been the subject of considerable speculation. According to his murderer himself, Prince Felix Yusupov, Grigori Rasputin consumed tea, cakes, and wine which had been laced with cyanide but he did not appear to be affected by it. He was then shot once in the chest and believed to be dead but, after a while, he leapt up and attacked Yusupov, who freed himself and fled. Rasputin followed and made it into the courtyard before being shot again, and collapsing into a snowbank. The conspirators then wrapped his body and dropped it into the Malaya Nevka River.\n|-\n!Gustav Kobbé\n|\n|\n|The 61-year-old author and music critic was sailing in Great South Bay, New York, when he noticed a low-flying seaplane heading toward him.

Co-star Wilfred Lytell and a chauffeur were able to extinguish the flames and rush her to a hospital, where she died the following day from her injuries.\n|-\n!Mr. and Mrs. Earl J. Dunn\n|\n|\n|While attempting to turn around at Grand View in Yellowstone National Park, the Dunns somehow backed their car over a cliff, despite a tree barrier that would normally have made this impossible. The vehicle fell  and then rolled another .\n|-\n!Thornton Jones\n|\n|\n|The lawyer from Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales, slit his own throat while he was having a nightmare. An inquest at Bangor delivered a verdict of \"suicide while temporarily insane\".\n|-\n!Cora Stallman\n|\n|1 August 1925\n|The 45-year-old schoolteacher from Cincinnati, Ohio, was found dead in a cistern in Coles County, Illinois, and was confirmed to be poisoned by a \"strange man\".\n|-\n!Phillip McClean\n|\n|\n|The 16-year-old and his brother were clubbing a cassowary on the family property in Mossman, Queensland, when it knocked him down, kicked him in the neck, and opened a large cut, leading to death from loss of blood.\n|-\n!Bobby Leach\n|\n|\n|The American stunt performer died after a botched amputation of the infected leg which he had broken after slipping on an orange peel. He had gone over Niagara Falls in a barrel 15 years earlier.\n|-\n!Harry Houdini\n|\n|\n|The 52-year-old Hungarian-American escape artist, illusionist, and stunt performer reportedly died from a punch from college student J. Gordon Whitehead, which gave him \"peritonitis, caused by a ruptured appendix.\" However, other stories claim he was murdered. Who or what killed Houdini is still under speculation.\n|-\n!Isadora Duncan\n|\n|\n|The 50-year-old American dancer broke her neck in Nice, France, when her long scarf became entangled in the open-spoked wheel and rear axle of the Amilcar CGSS automobile in which she was riding.\n|-\n!Alexander Bogdanov\n|\n|\n|The 54-year-old Soviet polymath and pioneer of blood transfusion died after exchanging his blood with his student who suffered from malaria and tuberculosis, presumably due to hemolytic transfusion reaction. Bogdanov's hypotheses were that the younger man's blood would rejuvenate his own aging body, and that his own blood, which he believed was resistant to tuberculosis, would treat the student's disease. The student injected with his blood made a complete recovery.\n|-\n!Alfred Loewenstein\n|\n|\n|The 51-year-old financier and third-richest man in the world at the time, died while flying from England to Belgium on his private Fokker F.VII airplane. It is believed he fell out of the aircraft and into the water where he died.\n|-\n!Victims of the Gillingham Fair fire disaster\n|\n|\n|At Gillingham, Kent, United Kingdom, an annual firefighting demonstration involving a rescue operation inside a three-storeys dummy house was hosted at a fair in Gillingham park. The real fire was accidentally lit after the six men and nine boys aged between 10 and 14 were ready to enact their staged rescue. The canvas-clad wooden structure quickly engulfed in flames, trapping the occupants inside. The crowd reportedly cheering and applauding what they believed to be realistic and spectacular effects until they witnessed two boys with their clothing ablaze jump to their deaths from the top of the structure. The fire resulted in the death of 15 people.\n|-\n!William Kogut\n|\n|\n|The 26-year-old convicted murderer, a death row inmate at San Quentin in California, reportedly committed suicide using a pipe bomb he made with playing cards and a hollow steel leg from his cot.\n|-\n!|Arnold Bennett\n|\n|\n|The 63-year-old British novelist was dining in Paris with his partner, Dorothy Cheston Bennett. He drank two glasses of tap water during the meal, scoffing at Dorothy's claims that the water in Paris was not properly treated to be safe to drink. Within two days, he contracted typhoid fever and died two months later.\n|-\n!|James Leo McDermott\n|\n|\n|After the 40-year-old deputy sheriff stepped out of his car at an oil station, the vehicle began to roll forward, and he attempted to hop onto the car's running board to stop it. It carried him forward and slammed him into a hook used to hold air and water hoses, which impaled him just below the heart.\n|-\n!|Eben Byers\n|\n|\n|The 51-year-old American socialite and industrialist died after drinking excessive quantities of Radithor, a patent medicine that contained 2 microcuries of radium. He drank a total of around 1400 doses, which concentrated in his bones, continually irradiating him. By 1931, his bones were reportedly disintegrating and his jaw had been removed; he died the next year.\n|-\n!Michael Malloy\n|\n|\n|Five people, called the \"Murder Trust,\" planned to kill Malloy for life insurance. Over the course of two months, they added antifreeze, turpentine, horse liniment, and finally rat poison in his alcohol, but Malloy drank it with no problems whatsoever. They then tried feeding him wood alcohol, expired oysters, and then a sandwich made of expired sardines and shrapnel, none of which had the desired effect. The group then tried to freeze him to death, and when that failed they ran him over twice with a taxi, from which Malloy recovered. Finally, they connected a hose to a coal gas jet and placed it in his mouth, which caused his death from carbon monoxide poisoning. Malloy was given nicknames such as \"Mike the Durable\", \"Iron Mike\", and \"The Irish Rasputin\".\n|-\n!Susan Grace Kelly\n|\n|\n|The 80-year-old woman in Armidale, New South Wales, was sitting with her daughter when she fell back dead after hearing a loud clap of thunder. Her last words were, \"That was very close.\"\n|-\n!Catherine Steyer\n|\n|\n|The 33-year-old hatcheck girl was accidentally electrocuted by a homemade booby trap, consisting of powered wires hidden within drapes, that her fiance had installed after her apartment was broken into a few months prior. Falling onto one wire, with another dangling above her arm, she completed the circuit each time the dangling wire touched her; she died slowly from the repeating doses of electricity.\n|-\n!Fred Clapp\n|\n|\n|A 77-year-old farmer from Clark County, South Dakota, died after being dragged by a bundle of horses while being tied to the harness.\n|-\n!Benjamin Taylor\n|\n|\n|During a carbuncle removal operation, an electric cautery ignited gases from the patient's lungs. This caused an explosion which killed Taylor and injured two nurses.\n|-\n!Nicholas Comper\n|\n|\n|The 42-year-old aviator and aircraft designer was attempting to light a firework in Hythe, Kent, when a passerby enquired what he was doing; he replied that he was an IRA man planning to blow up the town hall. The passerby knocked down Comper, who hit his head on the curb.\n|-\n!Italo Balbo\n|\n|\n|The 44-year-old governor of Italian Libya was flying his personal Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 when the Libyan airfield at Tobruk was attacked by a squad of British planes.

Budlong insisted on using a real saber rather than a prop one. While filming a cavalry charge, Budlong's horse was frightened by the sounds of simulated explosions and threw Budlong, causing him to impale himself with the sword.\n|-\n!Rolf Mützelburg\n|\n|\n|The 29-year-old commander of German submarine U-203 died during a World War II patrol southwest of the Azores when he dived from the sub's conning tower to swim in the ocean. The boat lurched suddenly, and Mützelburg's head and shoulder struck the sub.\n|-\n!Maj. Kenneth D. McCullar\n|\n|\n|The 27-year-old member of the 64th Bombardment Squadron was taking off for a night mission in New Guinea when he struck something with his bomber, referred to in reports as a \"brush kangaroo\" or \"baby kangaroo\" and later found to be a wallaby. The bomber crashed on takeoff, which detonated its load of bombs, killing McCullar and the rest of the bomber's crew.\n|-\n!Victims of the Balvano train disaster\n|\n|\n|At around midnight on 3 March 1944, a freight train headed from Naples to Potenza came to a stop inside the Armi tunnel in the town of Balvano due to its inability to climb over an incline. Due to a combination of carbon monoxide produced by poor-quality coal used on the locomotives and the lack of ventilation inside the tunnel, at least 517 people (most of whom were stowaway passengers) died as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning. The disaster remains the deadliest train accident in Italian history.\n|-\n!Thomas Midgley Jr.\n|\n|\n|In 1940, the 51-year-old contracted polio, which left him severely disabled, leading him to devise an elaborate system of ropes and pulleys to lift himself out of bed.

Of 1,195 crewmen aboard, about 300 went down with the ship. The remaining 890 faced hypothermia, dehydration, saltwater poisoning, and shark attacks while stranded in the open ocean for four days, with few lifeboats and almost no food or water. Only 316 survived the sinking; no U.S. warship sunk at sea has lost more sailors.\n|-\n!Louis Slotin\n|\n|\n|The 35-year-old Canadian physicist and Manhattan Project scientist died as the result of an accident while performing an experiment called \"tickling the dragon's tail\". Slotin used a screwdriver to separate two half sphere-shaped neutron deflectors enclosing a plutonium core which came to be known as the \"demon core\" to observe how much he can deflect the neutron without the core went over its critical mass. His screwdriver slipped, causing the top deflector to fully encase the core, resulting into a criticality accident that exposed him to a fatal dose of radiation. Slotin died 9 days later; the other people in the room observing the experiment survived.\n|-\n!Thomas Mantell\n|\n|\n|The 25-year-old P-51 Mustang fighter pilot crashed while in pursuit of an unidentified flying object near Franklin, Kentucky, thus becoming the first person known to have died as a result of a UFO sighting.

The blood clot quickly travelled to her brain, and she died in emergency surgery.\n|-\n!Gareth Jones\n|\n|\n|The 33-year-old British actor died of a heart attack between scenes of a live television play, Underground on the ITV network. Other members of the cast improvised lines, such as, \"I'm sure if So‑and‑so were here he would say...\", to compensate for his absence. Coincidentally, his character was scripted to die of a heart attack in a later scene of the play.\n|-\n!Nine members of a hiking group led by Igor Dyatlov\n|\n|\n|Nine experienced hikers died under unexplained circumstances on a ski trek across Northern Urals. Their inadequately dressed bodies were found on the slopes of Kholat Syakhl mountain, 1.5&nbsp;km away from their tent, which was cut open from the inside and abandoned along with equipment and supplies. The official investigation found no evidence of foul play and determined that six of the hikers died from hypothermia, while the other three sustained fatal physical trauma. Inexplicable injuries, traces of radiation on victims' clothing, and reports of bright burning objects in the sky have led to much speculation about the exact nature of the incident.\n|}\n1960s\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Name of person\n!scope=\"col\"|Image\n!scope=\"col\"|Date of death\n!scope=\"col\"|Details\n|-\n!Alan Stacey\n|\n|\n|The 26-year-old British racing driver died in a crash during the 1960 Belgian Grand Prix when a bird struck him in the face. 22-year-old British driver Chris Bristow was killed during the same race.\n|-\n!John A. Byrnes, Richard Leroy McKinley, and Richard C. Legg\n|\n|\n|During the testing of an experimental nuclear reactor design, in Arco, Idaho, two soldiers and a sailor were killed, but their deaths were not due to radiation poisoning. While trying to bring the reactor online, Byrnes, an army specialist, was supposed to pull a control rod partway out by hand, but he pulled the rod further than intended. The reactor instantly went prompt critical, which flash-boiled the water around the reactor. The force of the steam expanding lifted the entire reactor into the air about , in what has been described as a water hammer-like effect. Many components were thrown out of the top, one of which impaled Legg, a navy electrician's mate, lifted him from a catwalk, and penetrated the ceiling, leaving him dangling. While the reactor was airborne the radioactive steam escaped, spraying the room. The steam was so hot that Byrnes instantly died of severe thermal burns. McKinley suffered a head wound, from which he died later that day. The steam left the bodies of all three men radioactive, so they were buried in lead-lined coffins. The three remain the only human beings killed by a reactor explosion in the United States.\n|-\n!Victor Prather\n|\n|\n|The 34-year-old U.S. Navy flight surgeon drowned at the end of the record-setting Strato-Lab V balloon flight when he slipped from the rescue sling during recovery operations in the Gulf of Mexico and his pressure suit filled with water.\n|-\n!scope=\"row|Giulio Cabianca and 3 others\n|\n|\n|The 38-year-old Italian racing driver died in a bizarre series of events at the Modena Autodrome after a gearbox failure; unable to stop, Cabianca went off track, struck a spectator and then went through the gate of the Autodrome which was open because of men at work near the track. The car crossed the Via Emilia, collided with several vehicles, then crashed against the wall of a coachbuilder shop. Cabianca was killed, as were three others on the road.\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Joseph A. Walker and Carl Cross\n|\n|\n|Astronaut and NASA test pilot Walker, flying a Lockheed F-104N Starfighter, and North American Aviation test pilot Cross, co-piloting a North American XB-70 Valkyrie bomber, were killed in a mid-air collision during a publicity photo shoot of multiple aircraft with General Electric engines flying in formation near Edwards Air Force Base. With the Valkyrie in a spin, pilot Alvin S. White ejected and survived, but centrifugal force prevented Cross' ejection seat from retracting into the escape capsule.\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Nick Piantanida\n|\n|\n|The 34-year-old skydiver died four months after an attempt to break the record for the highest parachute jump near Joe Foss Field, Sioux Falls, South Dakota; his suit had depressurized, causing brain damage from lack of oxygen.\n|-\n!Jayne Mansfield, Samuel Brody, and Ronnie Harrison\n|\n|\n|The 34-year-old American actress and Playboy model died when the driver of her 1966 Buick Electra 225 crashed into a tractor which had abruptly stopped to make way for an approaching mosquito insecticide fog-spraying truck, which released clouds of insecticide that obscured the tractor. Brody, her lover, and Harrison, the driver, also died, but her children, including Mariska Hargitay, who was 3 years old at the time, survived. Many people speculated that the accident was the result of a Satanic curse.\n|-\n!Harold Holt\n|\n|\n|The 59-year-old Prime Minister of Australia disappeared, presumed drowned, while swimming at Cheviot Beach near Portsea, Victoria. He was \"simply one of the number of ordinary Australians who drown each year through poor judgment or bad luck\"; his drowning has been described as \"not unusual\", and as \"an ordinary death, a shockingly banal one that still befalls dozens every summer.\" Holt's disappearance gave rise to a variety of unfounded conspiracy theories.\n|-\n!Albert Dekker\n|\n|\n|The 62-year-old American actor and politician was found dead kneeling naked in his bathtub with a noose wrapped around his neck, a dirty hypodermic needle in each arm, a scarf over his eyes, a ball in his mouth secured to his head with wire, his wrists in handcuffs, and leather belts and thongs around his torso, one of them tied to a rope around Dekker's ankles. There were vulgar phrases and drawings in lipstick all over his body. His death was ruled an accidental case of erotic asphyxiation.\n|}\n1970s\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Name of person\n!scope=\"col\"|Image\n!scope=\"col\"|Date of death\n!scope=\"col\"|Details\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Alan Fish\n|\n|\n|On 16 May, while watching a Los Angeles Dodgers—San Francisco Giants game, the 14-year-old was struck in the head by a Manny Mota foul ball, causing an intracerebral hemorrhage.

The diving supervisor recognized Dimmer's condition, but the onshore physician consulted by the platform incorrectly diagnosed Dimmer as suffering from pneumonia. As a result, decompression continued, and Dimmer's pneumothorax proved fatal.\n|-\n!Deborah Gail Stone\n|\n|\n|The 18-year-old hostess for the America Sings attraction at Disneyland died after being crushed between two walls around 11:00&nbsp;pm. It is speculated that she either fell backward or tried to jump from one stage to another.\n|-\n!Christine Chubbuck\n|\n|\n|The 29-year-old American news anchor from Hudson, Ohio, shot herself in the head on live television at the start of Suncoast Digest, a local newscast for WXLT-TV in Sarasota, Florida, after reading some of the area's breaking news headlines.
