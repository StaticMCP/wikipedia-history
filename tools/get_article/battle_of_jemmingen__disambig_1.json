Louis was driven away by Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba and defeated at the Battle of Jemmingen (also known as Battle of Jemgum, at Jemgum in East Frisia, now part of Germany) on 21 July 1568.\nForces\nThe Spanish army consisted of 12,000 infantry (4 tercios), 3,000 cavalry, and some cannons. Louis of Nassau opposed them with 10,000 infantry (2 groups), some cavalry, and 16 cannons.\nBattle\nAfter three hours of skirmishes, Louis' army left its trenches and advanced. Pounded by effective musket fire and intimidated by the Spanish cavalry, the advance turned into a general retreat towards the river Ems.\nAftermath\nOn 19 May 1571 a statue of the Duke, cast from one of the captured bronze cannons, was placed in Antwerp citadel. After the Sack of Antwerp in 1576, the city joined the Dutch Revolt and in 1577 the statue was destroyed by an angry crowd.\nNotes\nReferences\n* Laffin, John, ''Brassey's Dictionary of Battles'', Barnes & Noble, 1995.\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027122807/http://www.geocities.com/aow1617/Jemmingen2.html  The Battle of Jemmingen]"
