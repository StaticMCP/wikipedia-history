The position was created in 1946, when the British administration merged the Prussian provinces of Westphalia and the northern part of the Prussian province of the Rhine (North Rhine) to form the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. In 1947, the state was expanded by the inclusion of the state of Lippe.\nThe current minister-president is Hendrik Wüst, heading a coalition government between the Christian Democratic Union and Alliance 90/The Greens. Wüst succeeded Armin Laschet following his resignation in 2021.\nThe office of the minister-president is known as the state chancellery () and is located in the capital of Düsseldorf, along with the rest of the cabinet departments.\nTitle\nThe German title Ministerpräsident can be translated literally as minister-president, although the state government sometimes uses the English title prime minister.\nOrigin of the office\nAfter the Second World War, the Prussian province of Westphalia and the northern part of the Prussian province of the Rhine (North Rhine) were administered as part of the zone allocated to the British military administration, and were merged to form the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. In 1947, the state was expanded to include the state of Lippe. The British government began to back the advocates of a merger of the states.\nList\nPolitical party:\n|CDU|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|SPD|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Green|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%; border:1px #AAAAFF solid\"\n|-\n!width=80px rowspan=2 colspan=2|Portrait\n!width=30% rowspan=2|Name(Born–Died)\n!width=35% colspan=3|Term of office\n!width=28% rowspan=2|Political party\n|-\n!Took office\n!Left office\n!Days\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\"| North Rhine-Westphalia (1946–present)\n|-\n| bgcolor=#EEEEEE colspan=8 | British occupation zone in Allied-occupied Germany (1946–1949)\n|-\n| bgcolor=#EEEEEE colspan=8 | State of the Federal Republic of Germany (as of 23 May 1949)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:;\" | 1\n|\n|Rudolf Amelunxen(1888–1969)\n|23 August 1946\n|16 June 1947\n|\n|Non-partisan (until 1947)Centre Party (from 1947)\n|-\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" | 2\n|\n|Karl Arnold(1901–1958)\n|17 June 1947\n|20 February 1956\n|\n|Christian Democratic Union\n|-\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" | 3\n|\n|Fritz Steinhoff(1897–1969)\n|20 February 1956\n|21 July 1958\n|\n|Social Democratic Party\n|-\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" | 4\n|\n|Franz Meyers(1908–2002)\n|21 July 1958\n|8 December 1966\n|\n|Christian Democratic Union\n|-\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" | 5\n|\n|Heinz Kühn(1912–1992)\n|8 December 1966\n|20 September 1978\n|\n|Social Democratic Party\n|-\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" | 6\n|\n|Johannes Rau(1931–2006)\n|20 September 1978\n|27 May 1998\n|\n|Social Democratic Party\n|-\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" | 7\n|\n|Wolfgang Clement(1940–2020)\n|27 May 1998\n|22 October 2002\n|\n|Social Democratic Party\n|-\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" | 8\n|\n|Peer Steinbrück(born 1947)\n|6 November 2002\n|22 June 2005\n|\n|Social Democratic Party\n|-\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" | 9\n|\n|Jürgen Rüttgers(born 1951)\n|22 June 2005\n|14 July 2010\n|\n|Christian Democratic Union\n|-\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" | 10\n|\n|Hannelore Kraft(born 1961)\n|14 July 2010\n|27 June 2017\n|\n|Social Democratic Party\n|-\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" | 11\n|\n|Armin Laschet(born 1961)\n|27 June 2017\n|26 October 2021\n|\n|Christian Democratic Union\n|-\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" | 12\n|\n|Hendrik Wüst(born 1975)\n|27 October 2021\n|Incumbent\n|\n|Christian Democratic Union\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* North Rhine-Westphalia\n* Politics of North Rhine-Westphalia\n* Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia\nReferences\nExternal links\n* http://www.nrw.de/en/state-government/prime-minister/"
