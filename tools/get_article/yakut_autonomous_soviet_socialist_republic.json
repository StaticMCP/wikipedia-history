It comprised the territory of the Yakutsk Oblast, excluding the Nizhnyaya Tunguska district, which became part of the Kirensky district of the Irkutsk Governorate; the Republic also included the Khatango-Anabar district of the Yeniseysk Governorate, the Olekminsko-Suntarskaya volost of the Kirensky district of the Irkutsk Governorate and all the islands of the Arctic Ocean located between the meridians of 84° and 140½° east longitude. It was transformed into the Sakha Republic in 21 April 1992.\nMaksim Ammosov, together with Platon Oyunsky and Isidor Barakhov, played a major role in the formation of the Yakut Autonomous Republic. Ammosov served as the first Executive Secretary of the Yakut Communist Party, Oyunsky was the first Chairman of the Central Executive Committee, and Barakhov was the first Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars.\nSee also\n*Yakut Regional Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union\nNotes\nReferences"
