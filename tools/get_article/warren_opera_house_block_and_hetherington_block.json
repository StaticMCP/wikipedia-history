They are both 2½-story brick structures. The Opera House block, originally owned by E.E. Warren, is located on the corner and features a corner turret.  It housed Warren's dry goods store and a theatre.  The adjacent commercial block was originally owned by John J. Heatherington, and is similar in style to the Opera House block.  Both buildings feature facades with a tripartite arrangement and center frontispieces that project slightly forward, a broad rock-faced beltcourse that runs above the second floor windows, a narrow metal cornice, and a brick parapet with finials.  The Opera House's parapet has a triangular pediment with \"Opera House\" on a rectangular base, and the Hetherington Block has a similar feature in a simplified form. The buildings were listed together on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.  In 2014 they were included as a contributing property in the Greenfield Public Square Historic District.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://hotel-greenfield.com/ Hotel Greenfield]"
