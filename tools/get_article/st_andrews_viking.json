      "text": "# St Andrews Viking\n\nThe St Andrews Viking is a family of American powered parachutes that was designed and manufactured by St Andrews Aviation of Panama City, Florida and later produced by Viking Aircraft Inc., also of Panama City.\nDesign and development\nThe two-seat Viking II was designed to comply with the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles two-seat trainer rules. It features a parachute-style high-wing, two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration, tricycle landing gear and a single  Rotax 503 engine in pusher configuration. The  2si 690-L70 engine was a factory option.\nThe aircraft is built from tubing and includes a partial cockpit fairing. The side-by-side seating configuration is unusual in powered parachutes, but was intended to make dual instruction easier. In flight steering is accomplished via dual foot pedals that actuate the canopy brakes, creating roll and yaw. On the ground the aircraft has a center-mounted bicycle handlebar that controls the nosewheel steering. The main landing gear incorporates steel spring rod suspension. The aircraft was factory supplied in the form of an assembly kit or could be delivered ready-to-fly.\nVariants\n;Viking I\n:Single seat version introduced in March 2000, that sold for US$10,900 complete and ready-to-fly in 2001.\n;Viking II\n:Two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration version introduced in 1998, that sold for US$12,000 complete and ready-to-fly, US$10,000 complete but unassembled or US$4,300 for the carriage kit only, less engine and canopy, in 2001.\nSpecifications (Viking II)\n|more general=\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=Rotax 503\n|eng1 type=twin cylinder, two-stroke, air-cooled aircraft engine\n|eng1 kw=\n|eng1 hp=50\n|prop blade number=3\n|prop name=composite propeller\n|prop dia m=\n|prop dia ft=\n|prop dia in=\n|prop note=\n|perfhide=\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=\n|max speed kts=\n|max speed note=\n|cruise speed kmh=\n|cruise speed mph=30\n|cruise speed kts=\n|cruise speed note=\n|stall speed kmh=\n|stall speed mph=\n|stall speed kts=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|never exceed speed mph=\n|never exceed speed kts=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|range km=\n|range miles=\n|range nmi=\n|range note=\n|endurance=\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling ft=\n|ceiling note=\n|g limits=\n|roll rate=\n|glide ratio=\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate ftmin=600\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|sink rate ms=\n|sink rate ftmin=\n|sink rate note=\n|lift to drag=\n|wing loading kg/m2=\n|wing loading lb/sqft=\n|wing loading note=\n|power/mass=\n|thrust/weight=\n|more performance=\n|avionics=\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040701000000*/http://www.vikingaircraft.com/ Viking archives] on Archive.org"
