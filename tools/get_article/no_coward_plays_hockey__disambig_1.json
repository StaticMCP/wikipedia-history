The song was composed in 1968 by Aleksandra Pakhmutova (music), Sergei Grebennikov and Nikolai Dobronravov (lyrics - both). During this period of Soviet history, ice hockey was very popular in the Soviet Union, which is why it was not a big surprise when such a song appeared. Since then, it has been performed by many musicians - and some hockey arenas in Russia use its theme to open the game.\nThe original version of this song was performed in 1968 by Vadim Mulerman.\nThe Canadian distribution rights to the song were owned by Aggie Kukulowicz, who acted as Team Canada's translator during the Summit Series.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.pakhmutova.ru/songs/pesni75.shtml#%D2%F0%F3%F1%20%ED%E5%20%E8%E3%F0%E0%E5%F2%20%E2%20%F5%EE%EA%EA%E5%E9 Official web site of Aleksandra Pahmutova]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcALaB2XVMQ  2001 version by Nikolai Fomenko, Viktor Rybin and Sergey Mazaev] (YouTube)"
