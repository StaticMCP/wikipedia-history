UAPB replaced Jackson State University after Jackson State played 29 games in the classic and Alcorn State replaced Tennessee State University after Tennessee State played 33 games in the classic.\nLocation\nThe game is held at Simmons Bank Liberty Stadium in Memphis.\nAnnual attendance\nThe record for attendance, 61,171, was set in 1997. Since the Jackson State–Tennessee State rivalry became a fixture in 1994, the average attendance for a Southern Heritage Classic game was about 50,000. Both schools are roughly equidistant from Memphis, being located approximately 200 miles away. The 2001 game was moved from its originally scheduled date of September 15 to November 22 due to the events of the September 11 terrorist attacks, and attendance suffered as a result, drawing only 28,690. The attendance for the 2024 was around 28,000 which was the lowest attended game since 1991. With Jackson State and Tennessee State no longer participating in the classic, attendance is expected to be significantly lower than years past.\nEconomic impact\nAt its peak, the classic and several festivities affiliated with it generated approximately $21 million for the Memphis economy and $325,000 for each university annually. The game also features a highly anticipated battle of the bands. The Southern Heritage Classic tailgating experience has traditionally been a large draw and begins days before the game. Concerts and other events fill up the weekend calendar in the Memphis area, drawing fans from all over the country. Past concerts have included headline stars such as Luther Vandross, The O'Jays, Gap Band, Gladys Knight and Usher.\nHistory\nAlthough the two teams played each other, the games were played at each team's home field on an alternating basis. That made it difficult for fans of the road team to travel en masse. Both head coaches, Bill Thomas from TSU and W. C. Gorden from JSU discussed the possibility of playing annually at a neutral site in Memphis; which was roughly equidistant from both campuses. Doing so benefited both schools by enhancing the rivalry and bringing in more dollars and large alumni base in the Memphis metro area.\nThe Southern Heritage Classic was founded and has been produced by Fred Jones Jr. A Memphis entrepreneur and entertainment producer, Jones was tasked with organizing the game as officials from both schools weren't familiar enough with the Memphis area.\nThe Classic part of the series between the two schools began in 1990, with Tennessee State winning 23–14. There were only two games staged in the period between 1990 and 2022 in which Jackson State did not participate — 1991 and 1993. Mississippi Valley State played Tennessee State in 1991, and Grambling State was TSU's opponent in 1993. Tennessee State played in every Southern Heritage Classic from the game's inception until 2025, and had an overall record of 19–12 when participating in the contest.\nThe games have largely been close, hard-fought battles with three overtime games and fourteen contests decided by a touchdown or less. The record for the highest-scoring game was set in 2001, the game delayed by the September 11 terrorist attacks, when Tennessee State beat Jackson State, 64–33, for a combined 97 points. TSU quarterback Shannon Harris, passed for 360 yards and a Southern Heritage Classic record seven touchdowns in that game. Between 1995 and 2007, nine games out of thirteen were decided by seven points or less.\nNearly 50 players who participated in the Southern Heritage Classic have gone on to play in the NFL, including four first-round draft picks: Lester Holmes (JSU offensive lineman, drafted 19th by the Philadelphia Eagles in 1993), Sylvester Morris (JSU wide receiver, drafted 21st by the Kansas City Chiefs in 2000), Rashard Anderson (JSU defensive back, drafted 23rd by the Carolina Panthers in 2000) and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie (TSU defensive back, drafted 18th by the Arizona Cardinals in 2008).\nThe 2020 game, scheduled for September 12, was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn February 2, 2022, Jackson State announced that the school would immediately leave the series due to conference conflicts. Tennessee State's president issued a scathing response stating the decision to terminate the series was “an insensitive and irresponsible act\" with consequences that go beyond football. On February 11, 2022, Jackson State announced they will play in the 2022 Southern Heritage Classic for the last time. In October 2022, Jackson State paid $800,000 to settle a lawsuit over their exit of the classic.\nOn December 7, 2022, it was announced that Arkansas–Pine Bluff will replace Jackson State in the classic.\nOn February 28, 2025, it was announced that Alcorn State will replace Tennessee State in the classic.\nGame results\n| team2 = Tennessee State\n| team2style =\n| series_summary = yes\n| legend_tie_text =\n| legend_forfeit_text = Jackson State/Tennessee State did not play\n| September 8, 1990 | Memphis, TN | Tennessee State | 23 | Jackson State | 14\n| August 31, 1991 | Memphis, TN | Miss.
