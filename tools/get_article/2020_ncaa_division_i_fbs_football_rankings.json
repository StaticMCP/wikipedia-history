Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, does not bestow a national championship at the FBS level. Instead, that title is bestowed by one or more different polling agencies. There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason—the AP Poll and the Coaches Poll. One additional poll, the College Football Playoff (CFP) ranking, is usually released starting midway through the season. The CFP rankings determine who makes the four-team playoff that determines the College Football Playoff National Champion. Due to scheduling impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, release of CFP rankings during the 2020 season was adjusted to have the first rankings issued on November 24 and the final rankings issued on December 20.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Increase in ranking\n|-\n|

dropping the Florida Gators only one spot from No. 6 to No. 7 following their home loss to a losing–record, unranked LSU Tigers team that was starting a freshman quarterback for the first time. Some also criticized the committee for undervaluing the undefeated Cincinnati Bearcats (dropped from No. 8 to No. 9 behind three two–loss teams) and for overvaluing the two–loss Iowa State Cyclones (rose from No. 7 to No. 6 despite two losses, including being defeated by the one-loss, No. 19-ranked Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns, 31–14).\nNotes\nReferences"
