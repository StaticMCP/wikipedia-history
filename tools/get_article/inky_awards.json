There are two awards: the Gold Inky Award for an Australian young adult title, and the Silver Inky Award for an international (non-Australian) young adult title.\nThe Awards are named after Inky – the Inside a Dog mascot and all-round wonder-dog.\nThe Inky Awards were founded by the Centre for Youth Literature at the State Library Victoria in 2007 as Australia's first national teen choice awards for young adult literature.\nIn 2020, the INKY awards were discontinued indefinitely as part of State Library timetabling changes.\nGold Inky Award Winners (Australian)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Author\n!Title\n!Publisher\n|-\n|2019\n|Lynette Noni\n|Whisper\n|Pantera\n|-\n|2018\n|Peter Vu\n|Paper Cranes Don’t Fly\n|Ford Street\n|-\n|2017\n|Cath Crowley\n|Words in Deep Blue\n|Pan Macmillan\n|-\n|2016\n|Amie Kaufman & Jay Kristoff\n|Illuminae\n|Allen and Unwin\n|-\n|2015\n|Gabrielle Tozer\n|The Intern\n|HarperCollins\n|-\n|2014\n|Will Kostakis\n|The First Third\n|Penguin Random House\n|-\n|2013\n|Barry Jonsberg\n|My Life as an Alphabet\n|Allen and Unwin\n|-\n|2012\n|Em Bailey\n|Shift\n|Hardie Grant Egmont\n|-\n|2011\n|James Moloney\n|Silvermay\n|HarperCollins\n|-\n|2010\n|Lucy Christopher\n|Stolen\n|Scholastic\n|-\n|2009\n|Randa Abdul-Fattah\n|Where the Streets Have No Name\n|HarperCollins\n|-\n|2008\n|James Roy\n|Town\n|University of Queensland Press\n|-\n|2007\n|Simmone Howell\n|Notes from the Teenage Underground\n|Pan Macmillan\n|}\nSilver Inky Award Winners (Non-Australian)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Author\n!Title\n!Publisher\n!Ref.\n|-\n|2019\n|Holly Black\n|The Cruel Prince\n|Allen & Unwin\n|\n|-\n|2018\n|Angie Thomas\n|The Hate U Give\n|Walker\n|\n|-\n|2017\n|Alice Oseman\n|Radio Silence\n|HarperCollins\n|\n|-\n|2016\n|Jandy Nelson\n|''I'll Give You the Sun\n|Walker Books\n|\n|-\n|2015\n|Rainbow Rowell\n|Fangirl\n|Pan Macmillan\n|\n|-\n|2014\n|Julie Berry\n|All The Truth That's In Me\n|HarperCollins\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|Maggie Stiefvater\n|The Raven Boys\n|Scholastic\n|\n|-\n|2012\n|John Green\n|The Fault in Our Stars\n|Penguin Random House\n|\n|-\n|2011\n|Cassandra Clare\n|Clockwork Angel\n|Walker Books\n|\n|-\n|2010\n|Maggie Stiefvater\n|Shiver\n|Scholastic\n|\n|-\n|2009\n|Suzanne Collins\n|The Hunger Games\n|Scholastic\n|\n|-\n|2008\n|Jenny Downham\n|Before I Die\n|Penguin Random House\n|\n|-\n|2007\n|John Green\n|Looking for Alaska\n|HarperCollins\n|''\n|}\nThe Process\nEligible books are submitted for consideration by publishers via a nomination form on InsideaDog.com.au.\nA longlist of 10 Australian books and 10 international books is then selected by \"Inky Awards teen alumni\", with the Centre for Youth Literature staff acting as the filter for coordination and eligibility.\nThe longlist is read by a panel of teenaged judges, who whittle the list down to a shortlist of ten books (5 Australian, 5 international).\nThe shortlist is published on Inside a Dog and individuals aged 12–18 can vote for their favourite. The Australian book with the most votes receives the Gold Inky Award and a cash prize ($2000), and the international book with the most votes wins the Silver Inky Award.\nReference List\nExternal links\n* [https://insideadog.com.au/the-inky-awards/ Official website]"
