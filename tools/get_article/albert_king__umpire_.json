He stood in three Test matches in 1931.\nBorn at Durban in 1878, King played three first-class matches for Natal during the 1906–07 season. He scored a total of 85 runs, with a highest score of 62 not out made against Eastern Province in his second match, an innings that ended when King was forced to retire hurt. He also took seven wickets, all of them in a single innings on debut against Griqualand West. In the match, Griqualand West were dismissed for 64 in their first innings and 31 in their second, with King taking seven wickets for ten runs in the second from just 38 balls. At the time these were the best innings bowling figures for Natal in first-class cricket.\nKing died at Durban in 1946. He was aged 67.\nSee also\n* List of Test cricket umpires\nReferences"
