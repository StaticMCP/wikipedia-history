It is one of the four oldest schools in Yorkshire, dating from 1139 and was refounded by King Edward VI in 1548.\nHistory\nKing's School Pontefract was founded in 1139. Little documentation survives from its early years, and it was refounded in the reign of King Edward VI. It has been associated with the Duchy of Lancaster since 1588 when it was given an endowment to allow it to continue functioning. In 1792 it was refounded yet again by George III who is the eponymous king. Annual payments of £50 were made by the Duchy of Lancaster until 1869. It closed in the 1880s but reopened on 4 May 1890 and has continued to the present day, although it was relocated in 1932.\nGrammar school\nThe present buildings were opened on 14 July 1932 by Sir F. Stanley Jackson. It was a boys' grammar school with around 650 boys, operated by the West Riding County Council. Four houses were formed, each associated with a name and a colour. They were Atkinson (yellow), Lyon (blue), De Lacy (green) and King Edward (red). Classes corresponding to years were numbered from 1 to 5 with three streamed classes in each year from and including Form 2. Upon entry to the school boys were placed in classes 1A, 1B and 1C ordered by surname alphabetically. In the second form streaming started with the top 30 rated pupils being placed in 2R (R for Rapid as year 3 was skipped by these pupils, passing directly to 4R). The other classes in the second form were 2A, 2B, 2C based on academic level. This was altered in the late 60's when  the A, B, and C  was replaced. While the \"R\" stream remained in place and skipped the 3rd grade the remaining pupils were assigned non-denominational A1 and A2 status. So second year student were now 2R, 2A1 and 2A2. All pupils had a form master who usually wore a black robe, and went to classes with specialist Teachers. There were not enough rooms for all classes to have a form room - some of the upper sixth form used to have the corridor outside the dining room as their form room. Only a few pupils stayed on for the sixth form, many pupils left the school at 16. It was expected that the R-class pupils would go on to the sixth form. The Grammar school had a tradition of playing Rugby Union and there were fields outside for this purpose, which were converted for cricket in the summer.\nComprehensive\nThe school became a comprehensive with a sixth form in 1978. Pontefract Girls' High School, the girls' grammar school became New College, Pontefract, and 11-18 school. In 1987, Pontefract schools lost their sixth form, with a sixth form college being established at New College, Pontefract.\nAcademy\nThe school converted to academy status on 1 April 2013 and is one of two high schools with Carleton High School in Pontefract Academies Trust.\nHeadmasters\nThe following have been headmasters:\n* 1548 John Stagg\n*1585 Lyonell Naylor\n*1593 John Marshe\n*1593 William Hartley\n*1622 Arthur Bromeley\n*1622 Thurston Elliott\n*1654 Thomas Lake\n*1662 Thomas Hunt\n*1672 Joseph Swift\n*1685 Nathan Drake\n*1689 Thomas Atkinson\n*1697 Thomas Horwood\n*1705 Thomas Horwood\n*1713 Francis Lassells\n*1737 Richard Harrison\n*1742 William Holmes\n*1778 Miles Steadman\n*1793 James Bindloss\n*1806 James Dixon\n*1807 Archibold C Campbell\n*1822 Pattison Watman\n*1851 Samuel W Newbald\n*1869 Thomas Longley\n*1874 Henry Caukwell\n*1889 Thomas H Nichols\n*1918 Edward B Forrest\n*1939 John D Lean (Died late 1958)\n*1959 Alan H Aldous\n*1970 J.
