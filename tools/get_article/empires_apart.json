If you are in search of a competitive multiplayer game, look no further.\"\nMarcello Perricone of Strategy Gamer summarized: \"In the end, Empires Apart is both a good spiritual successor to Microsoft’s classic and a good game in its own right, delivering a very capable experience that successfully brings most of Age of Empires mechanics into the modern age. If you liked Ensemble’s iconic series then you should definitely take a look at this game.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
