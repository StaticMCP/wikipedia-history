The memorial was erected to commemorate those who fell in the bloody Battle of Kilkis–Lachanas on 21 June 1913, which proved decisive for Greece's victory in the Second Balkan War. The museum was expanded in 1971, and belongs to the Ministry of National Defence, which is also responsible for running it.\nIn its two rooms, visitors may see memorabilia of the 1912-13 Balkan Wars including personal artifacts of the officers who fought in the battle, military uniforms, weapons, and regimental colours. There is also a relief map and audiovisual presentation of the battle.\nFile:Macedonian_Museums-56-Polemiko_Kilkis-247.jpg|Artillery of the Balkan wars\nFile:Macedonian_Museums-56-Polemiko_Kilkis-248.jpg|Memorabilia of the Balkan Wars\nFile:Macedonian_Museums-56-Polemiko_Kilkis-249.jpg|Military uniform\nSources\n*"
