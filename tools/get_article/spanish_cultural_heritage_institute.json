It is attached to the Directorate-General for Cultural Heritage and Fine Arts.\nIn order to develop this work, the IPCE has specialists in various disciplines: architects, archaeologists, ethnographers, conservators, scientists, archivists, computer specialists and curators, among others. These professionals face their work from the necessary multidisciplinary perspective, demanded by the complex task of conserving and valorizing cultural property.\nFunctions\nThe Institute carries out the following functions:\n* Development and implementation of conservation plans of movable and immovable Spanish Cultural Property.\n* Setting up of main lines of research in heritage conservation criteria, methodology and techniques.\n* Filing and systematizing the work carried out by the Institute.\n* Training of specialists who attend the functions of the Institute.\nConservation, research, training and diffusion are the basis of the IPCE structure. It is based on the solid track record of its predecessor, the Spanish Historical Heritage Institute, responding to a dynamic collaboration with local and autonomous Administrations. All this is upgraded by the constant contact between international professionals and institutions.\nIPCE Functional Areas\nConservation\nOne of the main functions of the Spanish Cultural Heritage Institute (IPCE) is the conservation of heritage.\nThe Institute develops many projects and activities on all types of heritage: monumental architecture, works of art, archaeological objects, textiles, bibliographic and documentary heritage, etc.\nThe IPCE also coordinates the generation and implementation of the National Cultural Heritage Plans, joint management tools for different types of cultural goods. Their drafting involves professionals of the Central Government, Autonomous Communities and independent experts.\nA National Plan sets the criteria and develops methods to protect, preserve, investigate, document and transmit cultural heritage.\nCurrently there are thirteen National Cultural Heritage Plans for the following matters: Cathedrals, abbeys, monasteries and convents; defensive architecture; industrial heritage; cultural landscapes; research in heritage conservation; preventive conservation; intangible heritage; twentieth  century heritage; education and heritage; traditional architecture; conservation of photographic heritage; and emergencies in heritage.\nResearch\nResearch should be the leitmotif of any conservation intervention and valorisation of cultural heritage. On this premise, the Institute specialists develop research in different areas: heritage applied sciences, conservation, architecture, archaeology, art history, ethnology and documentation.\nTraining\nThe quality of the interventions developed by the managerial and technical stall, responsible for heritage protection, depends on their complete and updated training. The IPCE is aware of the need to develop a training policy, keeping with national and international criteria in the heritage field. We, therefore, run various training activities, such as courses, conferences, technical seminars, etc.\nDocumentation\nThe ample documentary, bibliographic and photographic archives of the IPCE require constant conservation and valorisation. Thus the information stored in the Archive, the Library and Photo Library of the Institute contributes to increase constantly the knowledge of Spanish Cultural Heritage.\nDiffusion\nThe functions carried out by the Institute, mainly those related to research, conservation and diffusion of cultural goods, demand an active communications policy addressed to government, public and private institutions. Among other initiatives, this diffusion policy brings about a yearly publication plan that includes scientific monographs and magazines - \"Patrimonio Cultural de España\" and \"Informes y Trabajos\"-.\nIPCE Internal Organization\nConservation Intervention Area\nThe main functions of this area are the design, management and implementation of conservation interventions in cultural property, the draft and management of National Heritage Plans and the promotion of architectural, archaeological, historical and ethnographic research.\nThe area develops the following works:\n* Conservation of cultural property.\n* Advice on conservation projects of Autonomous Communities and other public or private institutions.\n* Draft and management of National Heritage Plans.\n* Technical reports about projects applying for finance through 1% Cultural (1% of the budget for civil works is spent on art projects).\n* Ethnographic research and implementation of projects.\n* Management of the Finance Program for the International Archaeological Projects, developed by the Ministry of Culture and Sports.\n* Drafting of documents on intervention criteria, methodology and action protocol in cultural property.\n* Reports on loan agreements and condition reports for exhibitions promoted by public institutions.\n* Coordination of European Heritage Days.\nResearch and Training Area\nThe general functions are the development, application and research of experimental sciences in conservation of cultural heritage.\nThe lines of works are:\n* Advice on the selection of methods and materials preparation used in cultural property treatments.\n* Selection of methodology and analysis techniques.
