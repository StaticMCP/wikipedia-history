It is one of the state's largest rivers, and is part of the Lake Eyre Basin. It runs along the eastern side of the Simpson Desert, and drains water from Eyre Creek, the Diamantina and Georgina rivers from Goyder Lagoon, carrying it into Lake Eyre during its infrequent floods.\nThe river passes through a number of permanent and semi-permanent waterholes, including the Poothapootha, Emu Bone, Wurdoopoothanie waterholes and Kalawarranna soakage.\nThere are seven tributaries of the river; Warburton Creek, Macumba River, Officer Creek, Kallakoopah Creek, Yelpawaralinna Creek and Derwent Creek.\nSee also\n}}\n*\nReferences"
