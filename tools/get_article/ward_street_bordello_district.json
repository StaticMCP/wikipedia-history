Nation made a celebrated appearance after which she declared the city a 'Demonocracy'.\nMayor J.E.T. Bowden, who had been the Mayor of Greater Jacksonville during the Great Fire of 1901 successfully came out of retirement and won a landslide re-election on the single issue of protecting the Bordellos and keeping them legal.\nThe Bordellos remained legitimate businesses in Jacksonville until 1953, and the last of the Grand Houses were demolished in 1981.\nNotable Bordellos of Ward Street: The Grande Dames\nThe Senate\nThe New York House\nRussian Belle  Built and owned by Belle Orloff, the Russian Madame famous for sending Carry A. Nation packing after an attempted raid on the part of the Temperance Crusader.\nThe Turkish Bath\nThe Court  Built and owned by Cora Crane, it was the grandest of the Grande Dames.\nExternal links\n*[https://www.metrojacksonville.com/article/2010-aug-grand-madames-bowden-backs-bordellos-wins-landslide Mayoral Campaign Speech of J.E.T.
