The palace was property of the Radziwiłł family until the first half of the nineteenth-century. In 1823 the building was sold to Ludwik Michał Pac who, following architect Enrico Marconi's designs, carried out a reconstruction of the palace into the Classicist architectural style. The palace was partially destroyed during World War II, with reconstruction works carried out between 1948 and 1951. Presently, the palace houses the headquarters of the Ministry of Health.\nFile:Miod40DSC 1221.jpg|View of wing from Miodowa Street\nFile:Miod29DSC 1219.jpg|View from Miodowa Street\nFile:VarsaviaMiodowaPalazzoPac.jpg|Gatehouse of Pac Palace\nReferences"
