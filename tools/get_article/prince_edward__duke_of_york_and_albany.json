As a boy, Edward, with his brother, went through long hours of schooling in arithmetic, Latin, geometry, writing, religion, French, German, Greek and even dancing to be well rounded.\nSeven Years' War\nPrince Edward showed an interest in naval affairs and sought permission to serve with the Royal Navy. He participated in the naval descents against the French coast taking part in the failed Raid on St Malo, which ended in the Battle of St. Cast in 1758.\nHe was promoted to captain of HMS Phoenix on 14 June 1759. He was made Rear-Admiral of the Blue in 1761, vice-admiral of the blue in 1762, and in 1766, only a year before his death, rising to the rank of Admiral of the Blue.\nLater life\n.]]\nHe was created Duke of York and Albany and Earl of Ulster by his paternal grandfather, George II, on 1 April 1760. When Edward's brother ascended the throne on 25 October 1760 as George III, he named Edward a privy counsellor. From the time his brother became king and until the birth of the King's first child, the future George IV, on 12 August 1762, the Duke was heir presumptive to the British throne.\nOn 27 July 1765, he was initiated into the Masonic Order.\nIn the late summer of 1767, on his way to Genoa, the Duke fell ill and had to be landed in the harbour of Monaco. Despite the care and attention he was given, he died in the Palace of Honoré III, Prince of Monaco, on 17 September. The state bedchamber where the ill duke died has since been known as the York Room.\nAfter his death, his body was returned to London aboard , and is interred in Westminster Abbey.\nLegacy\n, approx. 1764–1765]]\nLiterature\n*In 1762, James Boswell published \"The Cub at Newmarket\", a poem which he dedicated to Prince Edward, without getting his permission.  Boswell met the Prince at the Newmarket races in 1760 during his first visit to London. The cub referenced in the work is Boswell himself. The dedication reads:\n*Prince Edward is an important character in Norah Lofts' historical novel The Lost Queen (1969), chronicling the life of his youngest sister, Caroline Matilda, Queen Consort of Denmark and Norway as wife of King Christian VII. Edward is mentioned as having had a special link with her, stronger than with his other siblings. The book also depicts Edward as having planned shortly before his death to elope with a commoner woman with whom he was in love, marry her in Russia and never go back to Britain &ndash; which is not firmly attested in historical sources.\nPlaces and people named after Prince Edward\n*Prince Edward County, Virginia.\n*Cape York, the tip of the Cape York Peninsula in Far North Queensland, is the northernmost point on the Australian continent.\n*The Duke of York Islands (formerly ) in East New Britain Province, Papua New Guinea.
