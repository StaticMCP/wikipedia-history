It shows a person with dwarfism in the household of Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle, resting one hand on a dog (whose collar bears Perrenot de Granvelle's coat of arms, only identified as such in 1899) and holding a sceptre in another. It formed part of superintendent Nicolas Fouquet's collection before being seized from him by Louis XIV and is now in the Louvre Museum (INV 1583).\nReferences\ncategory:1560 paintings\ncategory:Portraits of men\ncategory:16th-century portraits"
