It is affiliated with the Churches of Christ. The university is governed by a board of directors, all of whom must be active members of the Churches of Christ.\nAcademics\nHeritage Christian University offers a 128-hour undergraduate program leading to a bachelor's degree in Biblical Studies. All students major in the bible and may choose up to 12 electives or one of two concentrations—Preaching Ministry or Family Life Ministry.  HCU also offers an Associate of Arts program. This 66-hour program of study results in the A.A. in Biblical Studies.\nHeritage Christian University offers three master's degrees. The Master of Arts (M.A.) prepares students for serious biblical study in Greek or Hebrew. The Master of Ministry (M.Min.) trains students for more effective ministry. The Master of Divinity (M.Div.), the first professional degree in the field of ministry, prepares ministers for comprehensive service for churches. In particular, in cooperation with the Ezell Institute for Biblical Research, students completing the M.Div. degree will be equipped to work in churches with limited resources. All three degrees aim to prepare workers for more effective service in the kingdom of God.\nThe MA and the M.Min. are both 36-hour programs, while the Master of Divinity is 75 hours with a required Spiritual Formation program to be completed. Instead of a thesis, M.Min. students participate in a practicum that gives them \"experience in a supervised program of the church.\" On June 27, 2011, Heritage Christian University announced that the school had been approved to offer the Master of Divinity degree. Graduate and undergraduate classes are offered both on-campus and online.\nHeritage Christian University is accredited by the Association for Biblical Higher Education. The ABHE is a member of the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) and is recognized as a national institutional accrediting agency for Bible colleges and universities.\nThe Alabama State Department of Education licenses Heritage Christian University as a private university.\nThe U.S. Office of Education Register lists the university, making Heritage Christian University students eligible for grants and federal loans.\nThe Alabama State Approving Agency recognizes Heritage Christian University for educational benefits to veterans.\nHeritage Christian University meets the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services's requirements for eligibility to enroll foreign students.\nLibrary\nThe Overton Memorial Library serves Heritage Christian University undergraduate and graduate students, as well as faculty and staff. The library was dedicated in November 1986 in honor of Basil and Margie Overton and in memory of their son Timothy, who died in 1974. Library holdings exceed 136,000 physical volumes.\nIn October 2005, the McMeans Family Reading Area was created in honor of William Delona and Othella Tuten McMeans. The Heritage Marriage and Family Resource Center was created within OML in April 2006 through a grant from the Alabama Marriage and Family Project. In June 2008, the Bagents Family Resource Center was created, honoring the Bagents Family.\nThe Frederick W. Danker Depositorium is located within the Overton Memorial Library. In April 2010, Frederick Danker informed the staff of the Overton Memorial Library that he would be giving his entire personal library and papers to the library. The process officially began in October 2010 and continued until shortly after Danker's death in February 2012. Housed within the Danker Depositorium are files of research conducted by Danker, personal correspondence, published and unpublished writings by Danker and memorabilia from his home and office.\nIn March 2019, the library's reference collection was named the Ray and Blanche Horsman Reference Collection in honor of the Horsman's dedication to Christian education and to the Overton Memorial Library.\nCampus\nThe Academic Building was constructed in 1977. This  building contains administrative and faculty offices, classrooms, auditorium, and a cafeteria.\nThe Alexander Activities Building was built in 1978 and has a gymnasium for students.

To graduate with an associate's or bachelor's degree, a student must complete the Field Education requirements, consisting of Field Education units and Missions Practicum units.\nM.Div. students are prepared to enter a serious engagement with their relationship to God as a primary part of their formation as a leader in a Christian community. Within the first calendar year of enrollment in the M.Div. degree, students are required to attend a retreat and become part of a spiritual formation group. As a part of their development, students participate in M.Div. chapels, journaling, and personal interaction with the Director of the Graduate Program to help them develop as Christian leaders.\nHeritage Christian University Press and Cypress Publications\nSince 2018, Heritage Christian University Press, under the imprints of HCU Press and Cypress Publications, has published the following to date:\n·       Danker, Frederick W.
