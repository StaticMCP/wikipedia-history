The game covers the Punic Wars between Rome and Carthage.  The original version of the game used hard mounted game boards, which increased the selling price of the game.  An updated version of Hannibal at Bay was announced on May 13, 2008 and was scheduled to be released in June 2008.  This game will use cardstock game boards (like those in the Panzer Grenadier series) to reduce the price of the game.  This version game is designed to be an entry point for the series, just like Airborne is for Panzer Grenadier.\nFading Legions\nFading Legions was released in 2002 and moved the series to the end of the Roman Empire, with battles against the Sassanid Persians and other enemies.\nQueen of the Celts\nThe series did not receive any updates until 2007, with Queen of the Celts.  This game covers both the Roman invasion of Britain and the resistance led by Caratacus, and the revolt of Boudicca against Roman misrule.  The game is named after Boudica.\nKing of Kings\nKing of Kings is the first book supplement to Rome at War and was announced on September 15, 2008.
