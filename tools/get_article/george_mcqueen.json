He signed for Airdrieonians and was immediately an important member of the side as they became one of the strongest in Scotland, finishing runners-up in the league for four seasons in succession and winning the Scottish Cup in 1924, McQueen lifting the trophy as captain. He remained with the Diamonds as a regular until retiring in 1933, aged 38, having made over 400 appearances overall and scored more than 30 goals from penalties and free-kicks, in which he specialised.\nMcQueen was selected for the Scottish Football League XI once in 1925 and travelled with the Scotland team as reserve defender in two occasions, but never received a full international cap.\nReferences"
