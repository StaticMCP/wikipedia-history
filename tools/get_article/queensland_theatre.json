It regularly performs in its own Bille Brown Theatre and the Queensland Performing Arts Centre's Playhouse.\nThe company was founded in 1970 by British actor and director Alan Edwards with a full company of performers. It was granted the prefix \"Royal\" in 1984. It is currently headed by executive director Criena Gehrke.\nHistory\nThe company has a strong history of development programs and has always aimed to encourage artistic growth across the state. There is an emerging artists program, writing program, including the Queensland Premier's Drama Award, and regional partnerships program.\nEmphasis is also placed on developing and inspiring young people through the company's education and youth program, with programs including The Scene Project, Youth Ensemble, Theatre Residency Week, Young Playwrights and other master classes.

Many Queenslanders including Babette Stephens and Diane Cilento have worked with the original Queensland Theatre Company during their careers. A large number of Sydney- and Melbourne-based actors have performed with the company, which some considered controversial as it reduced the number of opportunities for Queensland-based actors within the state-funded professional theatre.\nArtistic directors\nThe foundation artistic director was Alan Edwards. He was succeeded in 1988 by Aubrey Mellor, who was followed by Chris Johnson, Robyn Nevin and director/playwright Michael Gow.\nFrom July 2010, Wesley Enoch took over as artistic director, firstly on a part-time basis and then full-time in January 2011. becoming the first Indigenous person to head a state-funded theatre entity in Australia.

In March 2024, Lee Lewis resigned from the position.\nChairs\nFollowing Elizabeth Jameson's eleven year stint, filmmaker Dean Gibson was appointed chair of the company's board in June 2024.\nVenues\nFor almost thirty years the Queensland Theatre Company used the purpose-built 600 seat SGIO Theatre in Turbot Street, Brisbane, as their chief venue for productions.
