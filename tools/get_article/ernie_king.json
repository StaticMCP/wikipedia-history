He played football as an amateur with Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic in the Southern League before joining Southampton in October 1924.\nHe signed his first professional contract in January 1925 and made his first-team debut when he replaced Bert Shelley at right half for a Football League Second Division match at Sheffield Wednesday on 12 December 1925. The match was lost 2–1 and George Harkus took over at right half for the next match, retaining his place for the rest of the season.\nKing's only other first-team appearance came a year later, when he replaced Ted Hough at right back for a 3–1 victory over Barnsley on 18 December 1926.\nKing remained at The Dell until the summer of 1927, when he joined Guildford City. Although he only made two first-team appearances for the Saints, he played over 100 matches for the reserves.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.11v11.com/players/ernest-king-46127/ Career details on www.11v11.com]"
