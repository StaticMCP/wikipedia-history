The series is published by Metropolitan Books and includes contributions by such notable American thinkers and authors as Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn, Chalmers Johnson and Andrew Bacevich. The project's goal is to critique what the authors consider the imperial ambitions of the United States and to explore viable alternatives for foreign policy.\nThe American Empire Project was founded by Tom Engelhardt and Steven Fraser and started publication in 2004. It includes revised or reprinted editions of older books, as well as new books published for the first time.\nAmerican Empire Project book list\nA partial list of books in the project:\n*''A People's History of American Empire (2008); by Howard Zinn, Paul Buhle, Mike Konopacki\n*A Question of Torture: CIA Interrogation, from the Cold War to the War on Terror (2006); by Alfred McCoy\n*Ain’t My America: The Long, Noble History of Antiwar Conservatism and Middle-American Anti-Imperialism (2008); by Bill Kauffman\n*Blood and Oil: The Dangers and Consequences of America's Growing Petroleum Dependency; by Michael T.
