Andelic argued that, compared to the elections documented in this book, the film The Campaign, which is a fictional account of North Carolina politics, was \"ultimately a good deal less interesting\".\nBryan Thrift of Johnston Community College stated that the author \"succeeds masterfully\" at the stated goal. Thrift praised the \"thorough\" researching, and stated that the \"primary strength\" is how the work analyzes the political developments of the state, though Thrift argues that the book also has \"vivid, engaging stories\".\nSee also\n* Politics of North Carolina\n* Kerr Scott\n* Pat McCrory\nReferences\n*\n*  }}\nNotes\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://uncpress.org/book/9781469606972/the-making-of-a-southern-democracy/ The Making of a Southern Democracy] - University of North Carolina Press"
