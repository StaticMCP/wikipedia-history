On 10 September 1995, Guyana's Prime Minister, Cheddi Jagan, officially designated September as Amerindian Heritage Month. In memory of Campbell's achievement, 10 September is still celebrated as \"Heritage Day\".\nEvents and festivities\nThe official opening of Amerindian Heritage Month celebrations takes place at the Umana Yana on the first day of September. Every year a 'Heritage Village' is selected, which becomes the focus of festivities, particularly on 10 September. Previous Heritage Villages include: Micobie (2012), Aishalton (2011), Sophia (2010), Orealla (2009), and Santa Aratak (2008).\nReferences"
