Family Entertainment was the family division label of Warner Bros. Entertainment. It was founded in 1993 and released numerous theatrical and direct-to-video family-oriented films and television shows before the label was retired in 2011.\nHistory\nThe division was founded in 1993 to produce more family-friendly films after its 1987 distribution deal with the Walt Disney Company in which Warner Bros. released Disney films theatrically (e.g. The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast as well as reissues such as Cinderella) in many overseas territories from 1988 to 1992. The first theatrical film released under the Family Entertainment label was Dennis the Menace, released in the summer of 1993. The film proved to be a huge hit at the box office, grossing over $50 million at the domestic box office despite receiving negative reviews from critics. Following it was Free Willy, which was also released in the summer of 1993 and would also be a huge box office hit, grossing over $75 million domestically.\nOther 1993 releases included a live-action film adaptation of the book The Secret Garden, which didn't perform as well as the previous two films but still garnered over $30 million at the domestic box office, and ''George Balanchine's The Nutcracker. The last 1993 theatrical release from Warner Bros. Family Entertainment was Batman: Mask of the Phantasm'', and it wasn't a success at the box office, getting only $5 million at the box office compared to its $6 million budget, due to a lack of promotion from Warner Bros.\nIn 1994, it was the worst year for Warner Bros. Family Entertainment, where it was home to numerous box-office bombs. In the early part of 1994, Warner Bros. released Thumbelina, which was a major box-office bomb. Another 1994 film was a live-action rendition of the book Black Beauty, which was another box-office bomb for the studio, grabbing only nearly $5 million at the box office. Following it was A Troll in Central Park, which garnered less than $1 million at the box office. The last two films in 1994 were Little Giants, which performed better, but only received nearly $20 million domestically and Richie Rich, which was a box-office success, grossing over $76 million for its $40 million budget.\nIn 1995, it brought a live-action rendition of the book A Little Princess, which only got over $10 million in its domestic release. Other films that year included international distribution of The Pebble and the Penguin, which was a box-office bomb, grossing nearly $4 million, and Born to Be Wild, which also garnered nearly $4 million. However, the biggest success of 1995 for the company was the sequel to Free Willy, Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home, which, although not nearly as successful as the first film, was a minor success, garnering over $30 million.\nIn 1996, it saw Warner Bros. Family Entertainment's biggest hit yet, Space Jam, which garnered over $90 million domestically. The following year, the division released Turner Feature Animation's ''Cats Don't Dance'' (inherited from Turner Pictures as a result of Time Warner's merger with Turner Broadcasting), which bombed at the box office with over $3 million earned stemming from a lack of promotion. The next 1997 film was the third Free Willy film, Free Willy 3: The Rescue, which performed poorly, grossing over $3 million.\nIn 1998, it released Warner Bros. Feature Animation's Quest for Camelot, which would be a box-office bomb, but grossed more than previous films released by the company, grossing nearly $23 million domestically. In 1999, Warner Bros. Family Entertainment released two more films, the poorly performed The King and I, which only grossed nearly $12 million, and Brad Bird's The Iron Giant, which was also a box-office bomb, grossing over $23 million. The film itself was planned to be released under the banner, but director Brad Bird was against it for a multitude of reasons, especially the serious tone, Bugs Bunny being an ill-fit to open the film, and that the words \"Family Entertainment\" would have made this be marketed solely as a kids film, so Bird and the crew made a custom Warner Bros. Feature Animation logo instead. The Iron Giant would, however, go on to become a cult classic through video releases and television airings. The only film released under Warner Bros. Family Entertainment in 2000 was My Dog Skip, which became the company's first major box-office success in nearly four years, grossing nearly $35 million, although the film itself would use the main Warner Bros. Pictures logo instead.\nWarner Bros. continued to release family films later in the 2000s as well as the 2010s, but the logo for its Family Entertainment subsidiary was no longer used in the United States.\nWarner Bros. Family Entertainment continued operations in Germany until 2011, after releasing ''Laura's Star and the Dream Monsters.\nThough made before Warner Bros. created the label, it also covers the VHS releases of Calamity Jane, The Incredible Mr. Limpet, The Wizard of Oz, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Superman, Bugs Bunny's 3rd Movie: 1001 Rabbit Tales, The NeverEnding Story, The Goonies, Daffy Duck's Quackbusters, All Dogs Go to Heaven (the 1996 UK VHS release only), The NeverEnding Story, The NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter, Rover Dangerfield, Curly Sue and Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman.\nNotable theatrical movies\n* Dennis the Menace (1993, co-production with Hughes Entertainment)\n* Free Willy (1993, co-production with Regency Enterprises)\n* The Secret Garden (1993)\n* George Balanchine's The Nutcracker (1993, co-production with Elektra Entertainment and Regency Enterprises)\n* Batman: Mask of the Phantasm (1993, co-production with DC Entertainment)\n* Thumbelina (1994, produced by Don Bluth Entertainment)\n* Black Beauty (1994)\n* A Troll in Central Park (1994, produced by Don Bluth Entertainment)\n* Little Giants (1994, co-production with Amblin Entertainment)\n* The NeverEnding Story III: Escape from Fantasia (1994, German, French and U.K. distribution only)\n* Richie Rich (1994, co-production with Silver Pictures, Davis Entertainment and The Harvey Entertainment Company)\n* Born to Be Wild (1995)\n* A Little Princess (1995)\n* Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home (1995, co-production with Regency Enterprises)\n* The Amazing Panda Adventure (1995)\n* The Pebble and the Penguin (1995, non-US distribution only, produced by Don Bluth Entertainment)\n* It Takes Two (1995, produced by Rysher Entertainment)\n* Space Jam (1996)\n* The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996, German theatrical distribution only)\n* Shiloh (1996, co-distribution with Legacy Releasing)\n* Cats Don't Dance (1997, co-production with Turner Entertainment Co.)\n* A Rat's Tale (1997, co-production with Augsburger Puppenkiste and Monty Film)\n* Mijn Franse tante Gazeuse (1997, Dutch distribution only, produced by Bos Bros.
