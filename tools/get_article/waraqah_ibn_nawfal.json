Waraqah died shortly after Muhammad is said to have received his first revelation in 610 CE.\nWaraqah and Khadija were also cousins of Muhammad: their paternal grandfather Asad ibn Abd-al-Uzza was Muhammad's matrilineal great-great-grandfather. By another reckoning, Waraqah was Muhammad's third cousin: Asad ibn Abd-al-Uzza was a grandson of Muhammad's  patrilineal great-great-great-grandfather Qusai ibn Kilab. Waraqah was the son of a man called Nawfal and his consort—Hind, daughter of Abī Kat̲h̲īr. Waraqah was proposed to marry Khadija, but the marriage never took place.\nWaraqah is revered in Islamic tradition for being one of the firsts to believe in the prophecy of Muhammad. Other prominent Christian hanifs in Muhammad's biography include Bahira and Quss Ibn Sa'ida al-Iyadi.\nHadith traditions\nWitness to Muhammad\nWhen told of Muhammad's first revelation (which is understood to be Sura 96:1-5), Waraqah said his call to prophecy was authentic. Tradition recounts Waraqah saying: \"There has come to him the greatest Law that came to Moses; surely he is the prophet of this people\".\nTwo different narrations from Aisha give these details.\nPoems\nSome poems have been reported to be composed by Waraqah for his companion Zayd ibn Amr bin Nufayl.\n}}\nPersecution of Bilal\nOnce in the heat of the day Waraqah passed an open valley, where Umayyah ibn Khalaf was forcing his slave Bilal ibn Rabah to lie with a large rock on his chest until he denied his faith and worshipped Al-Lat and Al-‘Uzzá. Bilal kept insisting, \"One, one!\" i.e., there was only one God. Waraqah joined, \"One, one, by God, Bilal!\" He then protested against the abuse, telling Umayyah and his clan: \"I swear by God that if you kill him in this way, I will make his tomb a shrine.\" Umayyah took no notice.\nIbn Kathir doubts this tradition because the persecution of the Muslims only began several years after Waraqah's death. However, Sprenger points out that Bilal, being ancestrally Abyssinian, might have been Christian before he was a Muslim, though Bilal was taken from his parents at an early age. It is possible that Umayyah was persecuting him for this reason before 610. In that case, the story that Waraqah tried to help his co-coreligionist might be true. On the other hand, there are no sources that identify Bilal as a Christian, on the contrary, he, before becoming a Muslim renounced his idol worship, hinting that Bilal was a polytheist before he converted early on to Islam. Furthermore, Bilal was one of the first converts to Islam.\nLegacy\nMuhammad  said of Waraqah: \"Do not slander Waraqah ibn Nawfal, for I have seen that he will have one or two gardens in Paradise.\"\nKhadija told Muhammad  that Waraqah \"believed in you, but he died before your advent.\"\nMuhammad added: \"I saw him in a dream, and upon him were white garments. If he were among the inhabitants of the Fire then he would have been wearing other than that.\"\nIn popular culture\n* Syrian actor Rafiq Subaie played the role of Waraqah bin Nawfal in Omar (TV series).\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://hajj.al-islam.com/display.asp?lang=eng&sub=7&fname=kasas/6 A short description of the first revelation and immediate events]\n*[http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Quran/Sources/BBwaraqa.html Islamic Awareness - Did Waraqah ibn Nawfal teach the Prophet?]"
