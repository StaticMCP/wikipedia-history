It is one of the 10 largest cities in the Dominican Republic with a population estimated in 2022 at 153,241 within the city limits (metropolitan population: 270,000), of whom 149,840 are urban and 3,401 are rural.  The name Romana comes from the word \"Bomana\", a name given by Indians to what is known today as Romana River.\nThe modern La Romana International Airport was opened in 2000. The city is near several other cities, such as San Pedro de Macorís and the national capital, Santo Domingo de Guzmán. The city is a hub for a growing tourist industry with several nearby local resort spots, such as the beachfront Bayahibe, Dominicus, Casa de Campo, and the growing number of golf resorts that surround the area.\nHistory\nThe city of La Romana was officially founded in 1897 as an oil town. After 1917 with the construction of a large sugar-mill the economy quickly shifted to sugar production. The commissioning of the sugar mill coincided with the rise in sugar prices worldwide, prompting the sugar industry to welcome workers from different parts of the country as well as other parts of the Caribbean, many families moved to La Romana for economic opportunities.\nIn early 1960, Gulf and Western Industries, Inc. purchased the sugar mill and started to invest in the livestock industry which was cemented in the province. Meanwhile, $20 million were invested to rebuild La Romana and build schools, clinics, housing and other infrastructure for workers. During the mid-1970s the American conglomerate began selling its Dominican assets, and at the same time built what is now one of the largest exclusive tourist resorts in the Dominican Republic, Casa de Campo.\nEconomy\nLa Romana has historically been a company town, with the Central Romana Corporation owning the majority of the town. It is a town with nearly 100% employment, mostly in the tourism industry or with The Central Romana Corporation, the Duty Free Zone ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080905142109/http://www.zfr.com.do/ Zona Franca Romana]), or one of the service businesses there.\nLa Romana has been a one-company town since the South Puerto Rico Sugar Company built the mammoth Central Romana mill in 1917. It was the only sugar operation not taken over by Rafael Trujillo during his reign. From 1964 to 1967, the South Puerto Rico Sugar Company, including properties in Florida, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic became part of the conglomerate Gulf+Western. In 1984, the Gulf+Western Corporation sold their stake in the Central Romana Corporation to a group of local and foreign investors which includes the Fanjul brothers.\nGulf+Western acquired Consolidated Cigar in 1968 and shifted the Canary Island cigar-making operation to its Tabacalera de Garcia tobacco plant in La Romana. The Tabacalera de Garcia factory is currently one of the largest cigar factories in the world, and has been owned by the biggest cigar marketing company in the world, Altadis, since 1999. Three world-famous brands are produced in La Romana: Montecristo, H. Upmann, and Romeo y Julieta.\nCity of La Romana\nFile:Casa de Campo Marina, La Romana 22000, Dominican Republic - panoramio (4).jpg\nFile:La Romana, Dominican Republic - panoramio (38).jpg\nFile:La Romana, Dominican Republic - panoramio (39).jpg\nTourism\nCasa de Campo resort complex was built in 1975 by Gulf+Western.

The platform on the western bank was renovated and the river channel was dredged to a depth of .\nInaugurated with the arrival of the vessel Costa Marina in December 2002, the Central Romana Corporation invested US$12 million to extend the existing port by over .
