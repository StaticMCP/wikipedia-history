Smith of Rochester, New York, one of the earliest residents of Monroe County, New York.\nHe began his college life at Hamilton College, but transferred to Yale College at the beginning of his Junior year. He graduated from Yale in 1839.  After leaving college he studied law, was admitted to the bar in Rochester, and engaged in his chosen profession, also devoting much time to politics as a leader of the Whig party in his neighborhood. He was a member of the State Assembly of New York in 1849 and 1850, and was subsequently, Adjutant General of New York of the state under Gov. Washington Hunt.\nAfter some time he abandoned his legal and political career to study for the ministry of the Protestant Episcopal Church. Having been admitted to orders, he was made the minister of a church in Albion, New York, where he remained two years. He then resigned his post and visited Europe. On his return he became Rector of St Michael's Church, in Germantown, Pennsylvania. In 1863 he was appointed a chaplain in the regular army and assigned to the charge of the Military Hospital in Germantown. As his health was impaired by these two-fold engagements, he resigned his rectorship and devoted himself to the hospital until disease completely prostrated him.\nHe died at Germantown, Pennsylvania in December 1863. His remains were removed to Rochester for interment.\nReferences"
