The book delves deep into the political, military, and social aspects of Fascist Italy, chronicling its trajectory from initial triumphs to eventual collapse.\nGooch begins by exploring Mussolini's rise to power and the consolidation of his dictatorship following the March on Rome in 1922. He highlights Mussolini's ambitions for a revived Roman Empire and the expansionist policies that led to Italy's invasion of Ethiopia in 1935, a pivotal event in shaping international perceptions of Fascist Italy.\nThe narrative unfolds against the backdrop of Italy's alliance with Nazi Germany and Mussolini's ambitions for territorial expansion in Europe. Gooch examines the complex dynamics within the Axis powers and Italy's military campaigns in North Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Balkans. He assesses Mussolini's strategic decisions, military capabilities, and the impact of these campaigns on Italy's economy and society.\nCentral to Gooch's analysis is the turning point of 1943, when Italy's military defeats, internal dissent, and Allied invasion of Sicily culminated in the collapse of Mussolini's regime. Gooch explores the political intrigues that led to Mussolini's ousting by King Victor Emmanuel III and the subsequent Italian armistice with the Allies on 8 September 1943.\nThe book also examines the complex legacy of Fascism in Italy, the repercussions of Mussolini's rule on Italian society, and the post-war trials of Fascist leaders. Gooch's narrative is enriched by archival research and provides a nuanced understanding of the motivations, ideologies, and consequences associated with Fascist Italy during this critical period of European history.\nReception\n''Mussolini's War won the Royal United Services Institute Duke of Wellington Medal for Military History for 2021. The book was also ranked 40th on The Daily Telegraph'' list of the 50 best books of 2020.\nCritical reception was generally favourable.

Tony Barber praised the book's readability, and praised the narrative as \"lucid\" and the analysis as \"perfectly judged\".
