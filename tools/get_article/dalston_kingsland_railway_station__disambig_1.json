Situated in London fare zone 2, the station straddles the boundary with the London Borough of Islington, with part of the platforms falling within Islington. The station is located opposite Ridley Road Market. Ticket barriers are in operation.\nKingsland railway station was opened on the site in 1850. It was closed and replaced by Dalston Junction station, approximately  walk away, in 1865. The current station was opened by British Rail in 1983. There is now an official out-of-station interchange with Dalston Junction, which is served by the Windrush line of the London Overground.\nHistory\nA station was first opened on the site on 9 November 1850 by the North London Railway. It closed on 1 November 1865 when an extension was built to Broad Street in the City of London and a triangular junction was installed which joined the existing tracks to the east and west of the station. A new Dalston Junction station was opened at the southern tip of the junction and it replaced Kingsland station. The station was rebuilt and reopened on 16 May 1983 as part of the Crosstown Linkline service. The station replaced Dalston Junction when it closed in 1986, along with the rest of the line to Broad Street.\nPresent day\nDalston Junction reopened on 27 April 2010 on the London Overground East London line extension, with interchange permitted between it and Dalston Kingsland. The western curve of the junction was relaid for the East London line going to Highbury & Islington station; the site of the eastern curve is covered by the Dalston Eastern Curve Garden and the car park of Kingsland shopping centre.\nAs part of TfL's Overground improvement programme, plans have been approved to redevelop the station. Aside from increasing the number of entry and exit gates, the changes are largely cosmetic and do not make any provision for step-free access.\nPlans have been approved to redevelop the \"Peacocks\" building immediately adjacent to the station into a 15-storey tower block.\nServices\nAs part of the programme to introduce four-car trains on the London Overground network, the North London line between  and  closed in February 2010, reopening on 1 June 2010. The closure was to enable the installation of a new signalling system and the extension of 30 platforms. Engineering work continued until May 2011, during which reduced services operated and Sunday services were suspended.\nTypical off-peak frequency at the station is four trains per hour westbound to  via ,  and ; four trains per hour westbound to Clapham Junction; and eight trains per hour eastbound to . However, service intervals vary from about seven minutes during peak times to 30 minutes on Sundays\nAt Dalston Kingsland station the North London line (NLL) was powered by both 25 kV overhead AC and 750 V third-rail DC systems and was the change-over point between current collection by pantographs and by shoes for passenger trains that are dual-system Class 378 electric multiple units (EMUs). For reliability, time-saving, and as part of the NLL upgrade, the third rail has now been removed and overhead cables power the North London line between Stratford and Acton Central.\nIn August 2002 a potentially serious railway accident was avoided near Dalston Kingsland when a passenger train was inadvertently diverted on to the goods line during emergency signalling. When the passenger train was reversing to its correct path a following goods train almost ran into it.\nConnections\nLondon Buses routes 67, 76, 149, 243 and 488 serve the station.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/xls/station_usage_2005-06.xls Excel file displaying National Rail station usage information for 2005/06]\n}}"
