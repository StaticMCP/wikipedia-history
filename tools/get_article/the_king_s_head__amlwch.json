It is named after Henry VII of England, who was born in Wales (Pembroke Castle) in 1457.\n\"The Kings\", as it is popularly known, is the only original pub left standing from the town's copper industry at Parys Mountain in the eighteenth century.  This is at a time when it was recorded that there was a pub ratio of one pub for every four people in the town when the population was near 10,000 at the time.\nExternal links\n*[https://kings-head-amlwch.blogspot.com/ Kings Head Website]"
