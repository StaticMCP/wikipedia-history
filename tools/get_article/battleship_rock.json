Precipitation runoff from this iconic landform's slopes drains to the San Juan River via Lime Creek. Access to the butte is via the 17-mile Valley of the Gods Road which passes near this butte. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises nearly  above the valley floor in 0.25&nbsp;mile (0.4&nbsp;km). This landform's toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names.\nGeology\nBattleship Rock is composed of two principal strata of the Cutler Formation. The bottom layer is slope-forming Halgaito Formation and the upper stratum is cliff-forming Cedar Mesa Sandstone. Cedar Mesa Sandstone is the remains of coastal sand dunes deposited about 270 to 300 million years ago, during the Wolfcampian (early Permian). The buttes of Valley of the Gods are the result of the Halgaito Formation being more easily eroded than the overlaying sandstone. The valley floor is Honaker Trail Formation.\nClimate\nSpring and fall are the most favorable seasons to visit Battleship Rock. According to the Köppen climate classification system, it is located in a cold semi-arid climate zone with cold winters and hot summers. Summers highs rarely exceed . Summer nights are comfortably cool, and temperatures drop quickly after sunset. Winters are cold, but daytime highs are usually above freezing. Winter temperatures below  are uncommon, though possible. This desert climate receives less than  of annual rainfall, and snowfall is generally light during the winter.\nSee also\n* Castle Butte (Valley of the Gods)\nGallery\nFile:Battleship Rock, Utah.jpg|North aspect\nFile:Valley of the Gods Plains.jpg|Battleship Rock to right\nFile:Valley of the Gods sep 2012 29.jpg|Northwest aspect\nFile:Annular Eclipse in Valley of the Gods - 53329776615.jpg|West aspect\nFile:Battleship Rock, Valley Of The Gods.jpg|Northwest aspect\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Weather: [https://www.yr.no/en/forecast/daily-table/2-5534795/United%20States/Utah/San%20Juan/Battleship%20Rock Battleship Rock]"
