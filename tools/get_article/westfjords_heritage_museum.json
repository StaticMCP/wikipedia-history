The main focus is also to maintain knowledge and skills concerning their repair and maintenance and make sure that the knowledge is being passed between generations.[http://nedsti.is/batar/ Byggðarsafn Vestfjarða / Bátar] The museum was opened in Turnhúsið on Fisherman's Day in 1988.[http://timarit.is/ Timarit.is - Leita]\nMost of the museum collection consists of various historical things regarding the fisheries and the fishing industry around the Westfjords. Among interesting things is a collection of 190 accordions, a collection of valuable old boats and different things found by divers in the seas around the fjords.\nThe museum is a popular point of interest. Visitors from cruise ships that come to Ísafjörður are frequent guests. A local theatre group dressed in Icelandic national costumes makes a play of the daily life of the beginning 19th century, where they sing and dance to a music and put the fish bacalao out in the sun to dry. In 2013 during the summer opening time, 12,000 visitors came to visit the museum.[http://nedsti.is/frettir_og_tilkynningar/FRAM_sluttar_vertidinni_i_ar/ Byggðarsafn Vestfjarða / Fréttir og tilkynningar / FRAM slúttar vertíðinni í ár] The Museum is managed by Ísafjarðarbær, Súðavíkurhreppur and Bolungarvíkurkaupstaður.\nThe museum is open during the summertime.\nMuseum history\nThe first ideas about establishing heritage and maritime museum came from a man named Bárður G. Tómasson. In 1939, he wrote a newspaper article suggesting that people should unite in a project that involved a restoration of an old boat model called sexæringur. The boat should be an indicator of a regional heritage and maritime museum. The idea was successful. Few years later, in July 1941, the Ísafjörður heritage and maritime museum was established and Bárður was elected the first chairman. In the early decades little changed concerning the museum and its activities although in the year 1947 the museum came under control of the town council of Ísafjörður and the county committees. It was not until in the beginning of the 1970s with the restoration of Neðstikaupstaður that the museum found its future home in Turnhúsið which opened on Sjómannadagurinn the year 1988.[http://nedsti.is/um_safnid/ Byggðarsafn Vestfjarða / Um safnið]\nNeðstikaupstaður\nNeðstikaupstaður is an old historical site from the time Ísafjörður was called Skutulsfjarðaeyri. It has a long history of being a trading point with fish and other goods. It had couple of houses but the area consists now of four old houses that were built by Danish traders during the time that Iceland was under the Danish crown. The oldest house is Krambúðin built 1757 as a storage house and a trading store. Now it is the residence of the museum curator and his family. Faktorshúsið was built 1765 as a home for the \"faktor\" the store manager. Now the director of Ísafjörður Safnahús \"The Museum house\" (photo and art museum) lives there. Tjöruhúsið was built in 1781 as a storage house and is now a seafood restaurant by the same name.\nTurnhúsið was built 1784 as storage house now the home of Westfjords heritage museum.\nNeðstikaupstaður is the oldest \"village\" in Iceland where houses are grouped together from historical time. In 1975 that the houses were put on a preservation list and a major restoration started in  1977. The trading history came to an end in 1926, and since then the houses had lacked maintenance, were used as storage rooms and were in a really bad condition. This monumental site is now a pride for the town and its people, it keeps the history alive in an authentic atmosphere of the 18th century.[http://nedsti.is/nedstikaupstadur/ Byggðarsafn Vestfjarða / Neðstikaupstaður]\nTurnhúsið\nTurnhúsið or the Tower house is the youngest house in Neðstikaupstaður. It has three floors and the tower that had a special purpose. In the tower itself was a peeking hole where ships and people working were under the eyesight of the manager. The building style, called sparra stova is said to be unique and similar to Germanic-European houses from the same time. The house was restored with that idea it would be a place for the heritage museum that was opened the year 1988.[http://nedsti.is/nedstikaupstadur/turnhus/ Byggðarsafn Vestfjarða / Neðstikaupstaður / Turnhús]\nThe collection\nThe museum is said to be storing priceless artifacts.
