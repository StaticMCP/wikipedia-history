      "text": "# 2025 Minnesota Vikings season\n\nThe 2025 season is the Minnesota Vikings' 65th in the National Football League (NFL), their 10th playing their home games at U.S. Bank Stadium, their 21st under the ownership of Zygi Wilf and their fourth under the head coach/general manager tandem of Kevin O'Connell and Kwesi Adofo-Mensah. The Vikings will attempt to make the playoffs in back-to-back seasons for the first time since 2009, and end their five-year playoff victory drought. They failed to improve on their 14–3 record from 2024 after a 28–22 loss at home in Week 7 to the defending Super Bowl champions, the Philadelphia Eagles and failed to match it after losing to the Los Angeles Chargers by a 37–10 score in Week 8. The Vikings' 4–6 start is their worst since they also started 4–6 in 2020.\nOffseason\nFutures contracts\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Position\n!style=\"\"|

round of the 2025 NFL draft. They are scheduled to go into the draft with four selections, their fewest since making five picks in 2009. As well as their original first-round pick, they were also awarded a third-round pick in compensation for the departure of QB Kirk Cousins during the 2024 offseason, and acquired an additional fifth-round pick in a trade that sent DE Za'Darius Smith to the Cleveland Browns; that same deal sent the Vikings' original sixth- and seventh-round picks to the Browns. Their original second-round pick was sent to the Houston Texans in order to acquire another first-round selection in 2024; that pick was then sent to the Jacksonville Jaguars in a package with their original third- and fourth-round selections in the 2025 draft in order to move up again and select OLB Dallas Turner. They also traded picks with the San Francisco 49ers in order to acquire RB Jordan Mason, giving up their original fifth-round selection and a 2026 sixth-round pick for a 2025 sixth-round selection. The Vikings had been expected to receive an additional seventh-round pick in a trade that sent G Jesse Davis to the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2022, but the conditions of the trade were not met and the pick remained with the Steelers.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 2025 Minnesota Vikings draft selections\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Round\n!style=\"\"| Selection\n!style=\"\"| Player\n!style=\"\"| Position\n!style=\"\"| College\n!style=\"\"| Notes\n|-\n! 1 || 24\n| Donovan Jackson || G || Ohio State ||\n|-\n! 2 || 56\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the Houston Texans}} ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"| 3 || 88\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the Jacksonville Jaguars}} ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"|\n|-\n! 97\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the Houston Texans}} ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Compensatory selection\n|-\n! 102\n| Tai Felton || WR || Maryland || 2020 Resolution JC-2A selection; from Lions via Jaguars and Texans\n|-\n! 4 || 126\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the Jacksonville Jaguars ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"4\"| 5 || 139\n| Tyrion Ingram-Dawkins || DT || Georgia || from Browns}}\n|-\n! 142\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the Seattle Seahawks ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| from Jaguars via Texans\n|-\n! 160\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the San Francisco 49ers ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"|\n|-\n! 172\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the Los Angeles Rams ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| from Seahawks\n|-\n!rowspan=\"4\"| 6 || 187\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the Houston Texans ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| from 49ers\n|-\n! 200\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the Cleveland Browns ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"|\n|-\n! 201\n| Kobe King || LB || Penn State || from Rams\n|-\n! 202\n| Gavin Bartholomew || TE || Pittsburgh || from Texans via Steelers, Bears and Rams\n|-\n! 7 || 240\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the Cleveland Browns ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"|\n|}\nDraft trades\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 2025 Minnesota Vikings undrafted free agents\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Name\n!style=\"\"| Position\n!style=\"\"| College\n!style=\"\"| Ref.\n|-\n| Tyler Batty\n| OLB\n| BYU\n|rowspan=\"9\" |\n|-\n| Silas Bolden\n| WR\n| Texas\n|-\n| Max Brosmer\n| QB\n| Minnesota\n|-\n| Logan Brown\n| OT\n| Kansas\n|-\n| Chaz Chambliss\n| OLB\n| Georgia\n|-\n| Oscar Chapman\n| P\n| Auburn\n|-\n| Zeke Correll\n| C\n| NC State\n|-\n| Dontae Fleming\n| WR\n| Tulane\n|-\n| Keenan Garber\n| CB\n| Kansas State\n|-\n| Matt Harmon\n| OLB\n| Kent State\n|\n|-\n| Joe Huber\n| G\n| Wisconsin\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n| Austin Keys\n| LB\n| Auburn\n|-\n| Robert Lewis\n| WR\n| Auburn\n|-\n| Vershon Lee\n| C\n| South Carolina\n|\n|-\n| Dorian Mausi\n| LB\n| Auburn\n| rowspan=\"7\" |\n|-\n| Bryson Nesbit\n| TE\n| North Carolina\n|-\n| Mishael Powell\n| S\n| Miami (FL)\n|-\n| Myles Price\n| WR\n| Indiana\n|-\n| Tre Stewart\n| RB\n| Jacksonville State\n|-\n| Zemaiah Vaughn\n| CB\n| Utah\n|-\n| Alex Williams\n| DE\n| Middle Tennessee\n|-\n| Elijah Williams\n| DE\n| Morgan State\n|\n|-\n| Ben Yurosek\n| TE\n| Georgia\n|\n|}\nStaff\nCurrent roster\nPreseason\nSchedule\nThe Vikings' preseason opponents and schedule was announced on May 14, in conjunction with the release of the regular season schedule.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Week\n!style=\"\"| Date\n!style=\"\"| Opponent\n!style=\"\"| Result\n!style=\"\"| Record\n!style=\"\"| Venue\n!style=\"\"| Recap\n|-\n! 1\n|\n| Houston Texans\n| W 20–10\n| 1–0\n| U.S. Bank Stadium\n| [https://www.nfl.com/games/texans-at-vikings-2025-pre-1 Recap]\n|-\n! 2\n|\n| New England Patriots\n| L 12–20\n| 1–1\n| U.S. Bank Stadium\n| [https://www.nfl.com/games/patriots-at-vikings-2025-pre-2 Recap]\n|-\n! 3\n|\n| at Tennessee Titans\n| L 13–23\n| 1–2\n| Nissan Stadium\n| [https://www.nfl.com/games/vikings-at-titans-2025-pre-3 Recap]\n|}\nGame summaries\nWeek 1: vs. Houston Texans\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Preseason Week 1: Houston Texans at Minnesota Vikings&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=\n|time=3:00&nbsp;p.m.\n|road=Texans\n|R1=7|R2=0|R3=3|R4=0\n|home=Vikings\n|H1=3|H2=10|H3=0|H4=7\n|stadium=U.S. Bank Stadium, Minneapolis, Minnesota\n|attendance=66,715\n|weather=None (indoor stadium)\n|referee=Brad Allen (122)\n|TV=KMSP/NFLN\n|TVAnnouncers=Paul Allen, Pete Bercich and Ben Leber\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/games/texans-at-vikings-2025-pre-1 Recap], [https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/v1754845421/gamecenter/7af5c794-3ca3-11f0-b670-ae1250fadad1.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\nFirst quarter\n*MIN – Will Reichard 48-yard field goal, 8:57.

In addition to home and away matchups against each of their NFC North divisional rivals, they are also scheduled to play against each of the teams in the NFC East and AFC North, as well as the teams that also finished in second place in each of the NFC South, NFC West and AFC West.\nThe NFL announced the International Series matchups for 2025 prior to the rest of the schedule on May 13.

McCarthy became the first quarterback in NFL history to score three fourth-quarter touchdowns in an NFL debut, the first Vikings quarterback to throw multiple touchdowns in an NFL debut since Fran Tarkenton did so in the team's inaugural season in 1961, and the first quarterback to overcome a fourth-quarter deficit of at least 10 points in an NFL debut since Steve Young did it with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1985.\nWeek 2: vs. Atlanta Falcons\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week 2: Atlanta Falcons at Minnesota Vikings– Game summary\n|date=September 14\n|time=7:20p.m. CDT\n|road=Falcons\n|R1=6|R2=3|R3=3|R4=10\n|home=Vikings\n|H1=0|H2=6|H3=0|H4=0\n|stadium=U.S. Bank Stadium, Minneapolis, Minnesota\n|attendance=66,859\n|weather=None (indoor stadium)\n|referee=Adrian Hill (29)\n|TV=NBC\n|TVAnnouncers=Mike Tirico, Cris Collinsworth and Melissa Stark\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/games/falcons-at-vikings-2025-reg-2 Recap], [https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/v1757906577/gamecenter/f6437c01-311e-11f0-b670-ae1250fadad1.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\nFirst quarter\n*ATL – John Parker Romo 38-yard field goal, 11:12.
