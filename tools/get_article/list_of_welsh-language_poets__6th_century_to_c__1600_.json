The following list is as inclusive as possible for the years prior to 1600. It includes as many minor poets as possible to illustrate the range and content of Welsh poetry throughout the ages. However much early poetry has been lost, and much medieval verse is either anonymous or, usually in the case of mythological poems and prophetic verse, attributed to the 6th-century poet Taliesin or the mythical figure of Myrddin. Early religious and gnomic verse is also usually anonymous. Where possible examples of each poet's surviving work is presented at [http://cy.wikisource.org/wiki/Categori:Barddoniaeth Welsh Poetry at Wikisource]\nEach period of the poets listed below is accompanied by a graphical timeline to illustrate the main events and individuals that influenced the poets and their work. These timelines also depict the development of the Welsh language. Further details of its development may be found at Welsh language.\nPre 6th century\nNo works by Welsh poets prior to the 6th century have survived. Tradition records:\n*Maelgwyn of Llandaff (c. 450) – said, according to one source, to have written of Joseph of Arimathea's burial at Glastonbury. However, in the mid-5th century he would have spoken Brythonic, not Welsh, and as a monk would probably have written in Latin. His existence is doubtful.\n*St. Meugan (fl. c. late 5th century) – possibly a court poet to Cadwallon of Gwynedd\n6th century to 1100\nExtant\nThe bulk of surviving verse from the period known as \"Canu'r Bwlch\" is anonymous.[http://cy.wikisource.org/wiki/Categori:Barddoniaeth_anhysbys (see Wikisource)]\nThe works of the following poets, belonging to the Hengerdd or Cynfeirdd period, are extant and accepted as probably genuine:\n*Aneirin (Neirin mab Dwyrei) (fl. 550–600)\n*Taliesin (fl. later 6th century)\nThe following works are probably apocryphal:\n*Meigant (fl. c. 600–620) – a poet whose surviving work is recorded in the  [http://cy.wikisource.org/wiki/Categori:Llyfr_Du_Caerfyrddin Black Book Of Carmarthen].\n*Afan Ferddig (7th century) – accepted as the author of [http://cy.wikisource.org/wiki/Moliant_Cadwallon Moliant Cadwallon] a praise poem to Cadwallon ap Cadfan\n*Juvencus Manuscript/ Cambridge Juvencus (late 9th century) contains two Welsh englyn-poems, one of nine and one of three englynion. For the text and Sir Ifor William's translation see: [http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/juvencus.html The Juvencus Englynion].\n*The englyn-cycles which were previously attributed to Llywarch Hen and Heledd are now seen as works of later (9th–10th century) poets.\n*St Elaeth (11th century) – a poet and a monk whose surviving verse is recorded in the [http://cy.wikisource.org/wiki/Categori:Llyfr_Du_Caerfyrddin Black Book Of Carmarthen].\nNon-extant or doubtful\nFour others are named by Nennius as poets of renown alongside Taliesin and Aneirin:\n:*Blwchbardd\n:*Cian (Guenith Guaut)\n:*Culfardd\n:*Talhaearn Tad Awen\n*Arofan (7th century)\n* (?9th century) – referred to in several poems but otherwise unknown.
