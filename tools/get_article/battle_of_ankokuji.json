Following this, Itagaki Nobukata, a retainer under Takeda Shingen, would personally finish off Yoritsugu at Ankokuji. Yoritsugu's younger brother, Yorimune, however would be killed during this battle.\nReferences\nThe Samurai Sourcebook\n\n---\n\n## Battle of ankokuji\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Ankokuji"
