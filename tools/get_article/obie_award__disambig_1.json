Starting just after the 2014 ceremony, the American Theatre Wing became the joint presenter and administrative manager of the Obie Awards. The Obie Awards are considered off-Broadway's highest honor, similar to the Tony Awards for Broadway productions.\nBackground\n, Shelley Winters and Jason Robards at the first Obie Awards (1956)]]\nThe Obie Awards were initiated by critic Jerry Tallmer and Edwin (Ed) Fancher, publisher of The Village Voice, who handled the financing and business side of the project. They were first given in 1956 under the direction of Tallmer. Initially, only off-Broadway productions were eligible; in 1964, off-off-Broadway productions were made eligible. The first Obie Awards ceremony was held at Helen Gee's cafe.\nWith the exception of the Lifetime Achievement and Best New American Play awards, there are no fixed categories at the Obie Awards, and the winning actors and actresses are all in a single category titled \"Performance.\" There are no announced nominations. Awards in the past have included performance, direction, best production, design, special citations, and sustained achievement. Not every category is awarded every year.  The Village Voice also awards annual Obie grants to selected companies; in 2011, these grants were $2,000 each to Metropolitan Playhouse and Wakka Wakka Productions. There is also a Ross Wetzsteon Grant, named after its former theater editor, in the amount of $2,000 (in 2009; in 2011 the grant was $1,000), for a theatre that nurtures innovative new plays.\nThe first awards in 1955-1956 for plays and musicals were given to Absalom (Lionel Abel) as Best New Play, Uncle Vanya, Best All-Around Production and The Threepenny Opera as Best Musical.\nIn September 2014, the American Theatre Wing joined the Village Voice as co-presenters, with the Wing having \"overall responsibility for running\" the Awards.  In 2021, the Wing took over as sole presenter of the Obie Awards.\nAward categories\n*Obie Award for Distinguished Performance by an Actress\n* Obie Award for Distinguished Performance by an Actor\n* Obie Award for Distinguished Performance by an Ensemble\n* Sustained Achievement Award\n* Best New American Theatre Work Award\n* Playwriting Award\n* Design Award\n* Special Citations\n* Obie Grants\n* The Ross Wetzsteon Award\nCeremony history\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Host\n!Venue\n!Presenters\n|-\n|1956\n|Shelley Winters\n|Limelight Cafe\n|\n|-\n|1957\n|Geraldine Page\n|rowspan=2|[Limelight Cafe]\n|\n|-\n|1958\n|Maureen Stapleton\n|\n|-\n|1959\n|Kim Stanley\n|rowspan=14|Village Gate\n|\n|-\n|1960\n|Anne Bancroft\n|\n|-\n|1961\n|Julie Harris\n|\n|-\n|1962\n|Lotte Lenya\n|\n|-\n|1963\n|Uta Hagen\n|\n|-\n|1964\n|Colleen Dewhurst\n|\n|-\n|1965\n|Gloria Foster\n|\n|-\n|1966\n|Anne Jackson\n|\n|-\n|1967\n|Barbara Harris\n|\n|-\n|1968\n|Estelle Parsons\n|\n|-\n|1969\n|Julie Bovasso\n|\n|-\n|1970\n|Dustin Hoffman\n|\n|-\n|1971\n|Elaine May\n|\n|-\n|1972\n|Groucho Marx\n|\n|-\n|1973\n|Sylvia Miles\n|unknown venue\n|\n|-\n|1974\n|Madeleine Le Roux\n|unknown venue\n|\n|-\n|1975\n|Godfrey Cambridge\n|Village Gate\n|\n|-\n|1976\n|no formal host\n|Lincoln Center\n|\n|-\n|1977\n|Paul Sorvino, Gilda Radner, Marilyn Sokol\n|rowspan=3|The Bottom Line\n|\n|-\n|1978\n|Dustin Hoffman\n|\n|-\n|1979\n|Ron Leibman\n|\n|-\n|1980\n|no formal host\n|rowspan=2|Roxy NYC\n|\n|-\n|1981\n|Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver\n|\n|-\n|1982\n|Swoosie Kurtz, Tommy Tune\n|Savoy\n|\n|-\n|1983\n|Harvey Fierstein, Julie Bovasso\n|First City Cabaret\n|\n|-\n|1984\n|no formal host\n|Cat Club\n|\n|-\n|1985\n|Ellen Stewart, Harvey Fierstein\n|Puck Building\n|\n|-\n|1986\n|Christopher Durang, Swoozie Kurtz\n|unknown venue\n|\n|-\n|1987\n|Morgan Freeman, Christine Lahti\n|unknown venue\n|\n|-\n|1988\n|Morgan Freeman, Lee Breuer\n|unknown venue\n|\n|-\n|1989\n|no formal host\n|unknown venue\n|\n|-\n|1990\n|Julie Bovasso, Olympia Dukakis\n|unknown venue\n|\n|-\n|1991\n|Stockard Channing, Alan Arkin\n|rowspan=2|Palladium Ballroom\n|\n|-\n|1992\n|Jerry Zaks, Kate Nelligan\n|\n|-\n|1993\n|no formal host\n|unknown venue\n|\n|-\n|1994\n|Mary McDonnell, James McDaniel\n|unknown venue\n|\n|-\n|1995\n|Hector Elizondo, Anne Meara\n|unknown venue\n|\n|-\n|1996\n|Nicky Silver\n|unknown venue\n|\n|-\n|1997\n|no formal host\n|unknown venue\n|Fyvush Finkel, Kathleen Chalfant, Lisa Gay Hamilton, Peter Francis James, Shirley Knight, Camryn Manheim, Mary Louise Parker, Roger Guenveur Smith, Julie Taymor, Marisa Tomei, Rip Torn, Ming Cho Lee, Karin Coonrod, and Scott Elliot\n|-\n|1998\n|Eric Bogosian, Kristen Johnson\n|rowspan=8|Webster Hall\n|Danny Hoch, Woodie King Jr., Mac Wellman, Mary Louise Wilson, Lea DeLaria, Ellie Covan, Tsai Chin, Greg Germann, and Liz Diamond\n|-\n|1999\n|Lea DeLaria, Paul Rudnick\n|Betty Buckley, Kathleen Chalfant, Stephen DeRosa, David Henry Hwang, Swoosie Kurtz, Elizabeth Marvel, John Cameron Mitchell, Everett Quinton, Phylicia Rashad, and Roger Rees\n|-\n|2000\n|Claudia Shear, Mary Testa\n|Ping Chong, Felicity Huffman, William H.
