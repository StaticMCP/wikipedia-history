The interviews were drawn from the Imperial War Museum's sound archive.  Many of the recordings had not been heard since the 1970s.  As well as putting the interviews into chronological and campaign order, the book also puts the surrounding events into context.\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928044740/http://www.forgottenvoices.co.uk/ Forgotten Voices website]\n* [http://www.iwm.org.uk Imperial War Museum website]"
