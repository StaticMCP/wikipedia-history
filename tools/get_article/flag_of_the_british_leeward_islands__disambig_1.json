The colonies under the Federal Colony had their own badges from 1909. The Governor-in-chief of the Leeward Islands used a Union Flag defaced with the coat of arms. The badge depicted two white ships sailing in opposite directions through the straits. In the foreground was a pineapple, with three smaller ones behind it, as the fruit was an important product of island agriculture. The coat of arms of Great Britain appeared above the scene.\nThe flag was adopted in 1871 when Sir Benjamin Pine was governor; a rumour stated the large pineapple represented him and the smaller ones represented his family (as a form of canting). The flag was in use for 85 years until the federation was dissolved following the annexation of most of its islands to the larger West Indies Federation in 1958. The only change came in 1952 when the Queen Elizabeth II requested the Tudor Crown in all official British symbols be replaced with St. Edward's Crown, which she wore at her coronation.\n)\n}}\nSee also\n*Former parts of the Leeward Islands\n**Flag of Antigua and Barbuda\n**Flag of the British Virgin Islands\n**Flag of Dominica\n**Flag of Montserrat\n**Flag of Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla\n***Flag of Saint Kitts and Nevis\n***Flag of Anguilla\n*Flag of the British Windward Islands\n*Flag of the West Indies Federation\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
