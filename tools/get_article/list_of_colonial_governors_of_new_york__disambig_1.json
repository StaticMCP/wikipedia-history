These colonists were largely of Dutch, Flemish, Walloon, and German stock, but the colony soon became a \"melting pot.\" In 1664, at the onset of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, English forces under Richard Nicolls ousted the Dutch from control of New Netherland, and the territory became part of several different English colonies. Despite one brief year when the Dutch retook the colony (1673–1674), New York would remain an English and later British possession until the American colonies declared independence in 1776.\nWith the unification of the two proprietary colonies of East Jersey and West Jersey in 1702, the provinces of New York and the neighboring colony New Jersey shared a royal governor.  This arrangement began with the appointment of Queen Anne's cousin, Edward Hyde, Lord Cornbury as Royal Governor of New York and New Jersey in 1702, and ended when New Jersey was granted its own governor in 1738.\nDutch Era of New Netherland (1624–1664; 1673–1674)\n, New Netherland, and New England.|alt=A hand-drawn parchment map with territories colored red, green, and yellow, and captions written in Latin.]]\nNew Netherland (Dutch: Nieuw-Nederland) was the 17th-century colonial province of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands and the Dutch West India Company. It claimed territories along the eastern coast of North America from the Delmarva Peninsula to southwestern Cape Cod.  Settled areas of New Netherland are now constitute the states of  New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and Connecticut, and parts of Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. The provincial capital New Amsterdam was located at the southern tip of the island of Manhattan at Upper New York Bay.\nNew Netherland was conceived as a private business venture to exploit the North American fur trade. By the 1650s, the colony experienced dramatic growth and became a major port for trade in the North Atlantic. The leader of the Dutch colony was known by the title Director or Director-General. On August 27, 1664, four English frigates commanded by Richard Nicolls sailed into New Amsterdam's harbor and demanded the surrender of New Netherland.  This event sparked the Second Anglo-Dutch War, which led to the transfer of the territory to England per the Treaty of Breda.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!#\n!width=80|Portrait\n!width=200|Director (or Director-General)\n!width=100|Took office\n!width=100|Left office\n!width=500|Notes\n|-\n|1||| || Cornelius Jacobsen May (fl. 1600s) || 1624 || 1625 ||\n* Explored Delaware Bay, New York Bay, Hudson River.\n* Established base at Nut Island (Noten Eylant)  and outposts including Fort Nassau on Delaware River.\n* Cape May was named in his honor.\n|-\n|2||| || Willem Verhulst(or van der Hulst)(fl. 1600s) || 1625 || 1626 ||\n* Initiated construction of Fort Amsterdam on southern tip of Manhattan Island, and Fort Wilhelmus on the Delaware River.\n* Unpopular with the colonists, he was quickly replaced.\n|-\n|3|||  || Peter Minuit (1580–1638) || 1626 || 1631 ||\n* Purchased the island of Manhattan from Native Americans on May 24, 1626 for 60 Dutch guilders worth of goods.\n|-\n|4||| || Sebastiaen Jansen Krol (1595–1674) || 1632 || 1633 ||\n* Commander at Fort Orange (New Netherland) before and after his term as Director General\n|-\n|5|||  || Wouter van Twiller (1606–1654) || 1633 || 1638 ||\n* Previously a Dutch West India Company warehouse clerk, used family connections to the Rensselaer family to gain appointment\n* Purchased Nut Island (Noten Eylant), later called Governor's Island from Canarsee tribe for two axeheads, a string of beads and iron nails\n* Lost the colony's claim of the Connecticut River valley to New England settlers\n* Pushed back encroaching Virginia settlers who tried to settle Delaware River valley\n|-\n|6|||  || Willem Kieft (1597–1647) || 1638 || 1647 ||\n* Attempted to drive out Lenape tribe.\n* Attacks on Pavonia and Corlears Hook, led to Kieft's War.\n* Fired by the Dutch West India Company in 1647.\n* Died at sea near Swansea, Wales on September 27, 1647 while returning to Amsterdam aboard the Princess Amelia.\n|-\n|7|||  || Peter Stuyvesant (–1672) (Director General) || 1647 ||  1664 ||\n* Authorized charter for Communipaw and Bergen (now Jersey City) in 1660.\n* New Amsterdam, Pavonia, and Staten Island attacked by the Lenape during the brief Peach War (1655)\n* Obtained victory the Esopus Wars against the Lenape and Esopus tribes\n* Surrendered New Netherland to the British.\n* Also the Director of Curaçao (1642–1664)\n|}\nRestoration of the colony, 1673–1674\nIn 1673, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch were able to recapture New Amsterdam (renamed \"New York\" by the British) under Admiral Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest and Captain Anthony Colve.  Evertsen renamed the city \"New Orange.\" Evertsen returned to the Netherlands in July 1674, and was accused of disobeying his orders. Evertsen had been instructed not to retake New Amsterdam but instead to conquer the British colonies of Saint Helena and Cayenne (now French Guiana). In 1674, the Dutch were compelled to relinquish New Amsterdam to the British under the terms of the Second Treaty of Westminster.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!width=80|Portrait\n!width=200|Governor\n!width=100|Took office\n!width=100|Left office\n!width=500|Notes\n|-\n| || Anthony Colve (fl. 1600s) || 1673 || 1674 ||\n* Colve's authority was brief, starting with the taking of New York, but ended on February 9, 1674 with the signing of the Treaty of Westminster, which restored the colony to the English.
