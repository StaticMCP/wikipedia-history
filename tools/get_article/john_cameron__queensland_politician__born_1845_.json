His grandfather had been an officer of the 79th Highlanders at the Battle of Waterloo. His father left for Australia in 1852 and after settling in Victoria his family followed on the SS Great Britain the following year. On their arrival, the family took up Native Creek and later Berremboke stations near Geelong.\nWhilst in Victoria, Cameron attended Scotch College in Melbourne and Geelong Grammar School where, he later claimed \"I never did any good beyond being a good fighter\". After leaving school in 1859, he began work as a jackaroo and two years later the Camerons joined up with the Crombie family to drive their flocks to Barcaldine in Queensland. Around 1865, John Cameron went out on his own and found work as an overseer at Alice Downs before becoming manager of Wilby Downs.\nThe Camerons and Crombies joined with others to form a business partnership that embraced seven properties which John later became a partner in. In 1877, the business was wound up but Cameron, along with his brother-in-law, James Crombie, kept control of\nKensington Downs and Greenhills. After that partnership folded in 1881, Cameron joined with his mother in the running of Kensington Downs.\nPolitical career\nCameron, representing the Opposition, stood for the seat of Mitchell at the 1893 colonial election, and defeated Charles Fitzgerald, the Labour candidate, and J. Campbell, an independent. He served one term before losing his seat to Fitzgerald in 1896. At the 1899 election, Cameron, now representing the Ministerialists, stood for the seat of Barcoo but was defeated by Labour's George Kerr.\nIn 1901, the state member for Brisbane North, Thomas MacDonald-Paterson, resigned the seat to enter Federal Parliament and Cameron was his replacement. He held the seat until 1908 when ill-health forced his resignation.\nPersonal life\nCameron married Sarah Annie Lodge in Mudgee and together had four sons and one daughter. One of the sons, Sir Donald Cameron, went on to have a distinguished career in the Federal Parliament. Sarah died in 1893 and in 1899 he married Louise Christine Heussler, the daughter of John Heussler. This marriage realised one son.\nCameron died in Brisbane in June 1914 and after a private funeral was buried at Toowong Cemetery.\nReferences"
