      "text": "# United States presidential elections in Virginia\n\n| voted_winning = 40\n| voted_losing = 17\n}}\nFollowing is a table of United States presidential elections in Virginia, ordered by year. Since its admission to statehood in 1788, Virginia has participated in every U.S. presidential election except the election of 1864 during the American Civil War, when the state had seceded to join the Confederacy, and the election of 1868, when the state was undergoing Reconstruction.\nAs of 2024, it is the only state of the former Confederacy to vote reliably Democratic, having done so in every election since 2008. It was carried by a Democratic nominee who lost the popular vote in 2024.\nWinners of the state are in bold. The shading refers to the state winner, and not the national winner.\nElections from 1864 to present\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Year\n!

The victory by an ardent opponent of slavery spurred the secession of eleven states, including Virginia, and brought about the American Civil War.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Year\n!

The election was the only one in history to be decided by the House of Representatives under the provisions of the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution after no candidate secured a majority of the electoral vote. It was also the first presidential election in which the candidate who received a plurality of electoral votes (Andrew Jackson) did not become president, a source of great bitterness for Jackson and his supporters, who proclaimed the election of Adams a corrupt bargain.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Year\n!
