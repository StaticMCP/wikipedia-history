It was inspired in part by German essayist Walter Benjamin's \"The Storyteller\". The book is considered to be the closest McMurtry wrote to an autobiography.\nReception\nSalon Books wrote, \"As a critic, McMurtry is far too peripatetic; his desultory analysis of Benjamin amounts to something like a raveled sweater full of aimless tangled threads. Better to view him here, I think, as a memoirist -- and more just, as well, since the majority of the book is devoted more to his history and to that of his grandparents, first-generation Texas pioneers, than to the bricks and mortar of analysis. From this angle, McMurtry's thin book glitters.\"\nPublishers Weekly called it a \"digressive, erudite and frequently glum assessment of his career and the importance of storytelling... a thoughtful, elegant retrospective on Texas, his work and the meaning of reading by an author who has the range to write with intelligence about both Proust and the bathos of a Holiday Inn marquee.\"\nThe Los Angeles Times wrote the book contained \"brief illuminations of themes McMurtry has treated at length in his novels. It’s like Texas’ Red River in summer, braiding itself into random channels, sometimes more sand and cottonwoods than river, but pleasant, as riparian habitat usually is.\"\nKirkus said \"it’s philosophy, literary criticism, and memoir all rolled up into one neat package, and McMurtry’s constant readers will find much pleasure in these pages.\"\nReferences"
