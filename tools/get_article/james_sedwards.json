Sedwards also has ongoing improvisation duo work with drummer Jem Doulton and was a live member of the reunited This Heat (playing under the name This Is Not This Heat) from 2016 until 2019.\nSedwards is an original member of the Thurston Moore Group, alongside Moore, My Bloody Valentine's Deb Googe (on bass) and Sonic Youth's Steve Shelley (on drums), playing on all their albums, from The Best Day (2014) onwards.\nSedwards is noted for his guitar skills, having been a runner-up at the 1998 Guitarist of the Year competition held at the Wembley Conference Centre (now Wembley Arena) with the judges finding his composition and performance of the piece 'Cough Cap Kitty Cat' the \"perfect blend of technical expertise and inventiveness.\" He also came in 2nd place in the first UK Riffathon in 2003, a nationwide guitar competition in aid of Action For Brazil's Children Trust and judged by Jimmy Page and Brian May, where he played the 1973 live version of Led Zeppelin's 'Immigrant Song'.\nOn many of his projects, Sedwards plays bass guitar in addition to (or instead of) six-string guitar. He has also been noted for sometimes playing his guitar with a power drill.\nJohn Peel infamously said that Sedwards is \"the first person who's not a footballer that I've been jealous of.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.noughtmusic.com Nought homepage]\n*[http://www.myspace.com/nought Nought @ MySpace]\n*[http://www.headheritage.co.uk/unsung/review/777/]\n*[http://purgeandpinstinct.bandcamp.com/ The Devil Bandcamp site]"
