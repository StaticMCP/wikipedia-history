      "text": "# 1989–90 Golden State Warriors season\n\nThe 1989–90 Golden State Warriors season was the 44th season for the Golden State Warriors in the National Basketball Association, and their 27th season in the San Francisco Bay Area. The Warriors received the fourteenth overall pick in the 1989 NBA draft, and selected point guard Tim Hardaway from the University of Texas-El Paso; Hardaway teamed with All-Star forward Chris Mullin, and second-year star Mitch Richmond to form the threesome later known as Run TMC.\nThe Warriors got off to a bad start by losing 14 of their first 18 games of the regular season, but posted two six-game winning streaks afterwards winning 12 of their next 15 games, and held a 23–24 record at the All-Star break. At mid-season, the team traded Winston Garland to the Los Angeles Clippers. However, midway through the season, they struggled and fell below .500, missing the NBA playoffs by finishing in fifth place in the Pacific Division with a 37–45 record.\nMullin averaged 25.1 points, 5.9 rebounds, 4.1 assists and 1.6 steals per game, and was named to the All-NBA Third Team. In addition, Richmond averaged 22.1 points and 1.3 steals per game, while Terry Teagle provided the team with 16.1 points per game, and Hardaway contributed 14.7 points, 8.7 assists and 2.1 steals per game, and was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team. Meanwhile, rookie shooting guard Sarunas Marciulionis contributed 12.1 points per game off the bench, Rod Higgins provided with 11.1 points and 5.1 rebounds per game, Tom Tolbert averaged 8.8 points and 5.2 rebounds per game, and Manute Bol contributed 1.9 points, 3.7 rebounds, and led the team with 3.2 blocks per game, but struggled only shooting .331 in field-goal percentage.\nDuring the NBA All-Star weekend at the Miami Arena in Miami, Florida, Mullin was selected for the 1990 NBA All-Star Game, as a member of the Western Conference All-Star team. In a 120–115 road win over the Boston Celtics at the Boston Garden on January 21, 1990, Hardaway, Mullin and Richmond all surpassed 20 points in the same game for the first time. The Warriors also led the NBA in scoring during the season. Following the season, Teagle was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, and Bol was dealt to the Philadelphia 76ers.\nFor the season, the Warriors changed their uniforms, which remained in use until 1997.\nDraft picks\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\"\n!
