The Minister responsible is Trevor Jones.\nFoodland Ontario\nFoodland Ontario was founded in 1977 as a consumer promotion program for the agricultural products in Ontario. Foodland Ontario is administrated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Agribusiness. Foodland Ontario's mandate states their goal is to \"spread the word about the great taste, nutrition and economic benefits of buying Ontario food to all people in Ontario\".\nAccording to the Ministry, Foodland Ontario commercials such as the \"Good things grow in Ontario\" campaign reach more than 90% of the target audience including television, radio, billboard and print media campaigns.  Food retailers such as grocery stores and farmer's markets display the logo to promote Ontario foods and capture niche markets for products such as health food.  In 2011-12, over 700,000 copies of Foodland calendars and 250,000 copies of two Foodland cookbooks were distributed across the province.\nMinistry agencies\nThe Ministry is responsible for the following agencies, boards and commissions:\n* Agricorp\n* Agricultural Research Institute of Ontario\n* Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Appeal Tribunal\n* Business Risk Management Review Committee\n* Grain Financial Protection Board\n* Livestock Financial Protection Board\n* Livestock Medicines Advisory Committee\n* Normal Farm Practices Protection Board\n* Ontario Farm Products Marketing Commission\n* Ontario Food Terminal Board\nOrganization history\nPrior to confederation, the Bureau of Agriculture of the Province of Canada was responsible for collecting facts and statistics relating to the agricultural, mechanical and manufacturing interests.\nUnder the terms of the British North America Act 1867, the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario was empowered to appoint, as one of the executive officers of the government, a Commissioner of Agriculture and Public Works.\nOn March 4, 1868, the Act for the Encouragement of Agriculture, Horticulture, Arts, and Manufactures received royal assent, establishing the Department of the Commissioner of Agriculture and Public Works. The Commissioner was referred to simply as the Commissioner of Agriculture and Arts when dealing with matters relating to arts and agriculture, and as the Commissioner of Public Works, when dealing with matters relating to public works. However, a separate Department of Public Works was established in 1869, taking over the public works functions. However, one individual continued to be commissioner for both portfolios until 1874.\nThe agricultural and arts functions of the department were carried out by the Commissioner through the Bureau of Agriculture and Arts.574}} \"Arts\", at the time, referred to the practical application of an industrial, manufacturing, or scientific pursuit, rather than to its current meaning. Additionally, a variety of both agricultural and arts-related agencies were required to report to the commissioner, and to provide statistical information to the bureau. The department also had responsibility over immigration between 1869 and 1874. In 1874, a separate Commissioner for the Department of Public Works was created.\nIn 1877, the Department of the Commissioner of Agriculture and Arts was formally established. The Commissioner acted as head of the Bureau of Agriculture and Arts from 1877 until 1882, as well as the Bureau of Industries, which replaced the Bureau of Agriculture and Arts, from 1882 until 1888.\nIn 1880, the \"arts\" related responsibilities of the Commissioner, and the bureau, were transferred to the Department of Education. The name of the department, however, remained the Department of the Commissioner of Agriculture and Arts until 1888.\nIn 1888, the department was renamed the Department of Agriculture. With this change, the head of the department was renamed to the Minister of Agriculture, with cabinet standing.  Prior to the First World War, the department were responsible for a wide range of functions including the Office of the Registrar General (until 1891); the Clerk of Forestry (until 1895); the Inspector of Factories (until 1915); the Inspector of Mines (until 1891); and the Provincial Inspector in Road-making (until 1900). After the First World War, the department's function became increasingly more focused in the regulation and promotion of agricultural activities. The department was briefly responsible for telephone services between 1960 and 1971.\nIn 1966, the department was renamed the Department of Agriculture and Food. By this time, rural development has emerged distinctly as an area of focus. With the reorganization of the government in 1972, the department was renamed the Ministry of Agriculture and Food. In 1994, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food was renamed the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs.\nList of ministers\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 75%\"\n!\n!
