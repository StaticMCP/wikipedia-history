Belarusian courts sentenced 13 people to a combined total of nearly 200 years in prison.\nActions\nSignalling equipment was destroyed in three regions of Belarus, and railway lines were blocked. As a result of these operations, the work of several branches of the Belarusian railway was disrupted, particularly in the south of Belarus. There have been some 80 acts of sabotage on Belarusian railways as of 12 April 2022, based on data from the Belarusian Interior Ministry.\nThe most common form of damage is setting fire to the signalling equipment. This disrupts the lights on the railway system, forcing trains to slow to . A married couple set fire to the logs of railway tracks. Other acts of sabotage have involved the railway's workers themselves as well as hackers attacking the railway's computer system. The Deputy Interior Minister threatened to kill the partisans in a statement in early March. Shots were fired at people attempting to set fire to a signal box in late March.\nSetting fire to relay cabinets has proved a favourite form of sabotage, this stops the railway system knowing if part of a track is occupied, or not, by a train. In March 2022, the Belarusian section of the Gomel-Chernihiv-Kyiv railway was put out of service this way.\nThe opposition's actions assisted Ukrainian forces in defeating the 2022 Russian offensive which aimed to conquer Kyiv.\nReactions\nIn late April 2022, the Belarusian House of Representatives passed a law to apply the death penalty for sabotage.\nSee also\n* Rail War\n* Rail war in Russia (2022–present)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Sly, Liz [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/04/23/ukraine-belarus-railway-saboteurs-russia/ The Belarusian railway workers who helped thwart Russia’s attack on Kyiv] The Washington Post (April 23, 2022)"
