It was produced by Erick Sermon.\nBackground\nAccording to Too Short, there are several versions of the song. He recorded the first when he was in high school, another version when he was signed to 75 Girls Records and Tapes, and the final one when he changed to Jive Records. With respect to the inspiration of the song, he said:\nWe was cutting school one day and went down to Berkeley. We went from our school to Berkeley High and we were smoking weed and shit. We just kept laughing because there were these flat booty girls everywhere we went. We really were on a mission that day, looking for a girl with a fat ass and I was the one who wrote the song about it.\nRapper Erick Sermon had heard the song and wanted Too Short to make it. He produced the final version of the song.\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1998)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
