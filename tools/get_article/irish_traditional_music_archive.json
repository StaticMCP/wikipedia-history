Focusing on Irish traditional music, Irish dance and their history, the archive covers the performance traditions of the island of Ireland, within the Irish diaspora, and other performers of Irish traditional music globally.\nThe archive, described by some sources as the \"largest collection of its kind in the world\", contains thousands of sound recordings, as well as books and serials, photographs, sheet music, DVDs, posters and catalogues. Founded with the Breandán Breathnach Collection, the collection has been expanded through donations by radio, television, libraries and private collectors.\nFounded in 1987, the archive has been housed in a Georgian house in central Dublin since 2006.\nHistory\nITMA was co-founded in 1987 by Nicholas Carolan and Harry Bradshaw. Nicholas Carolan, who first found a space for the archive in the Temple Bar area of Dublin, served as director for 28 years until he was succeeded by Grace Toland in 2015. Carolan continued in a voluntary role as director emeritus.\nThe organisation receives some funding from the Arts Council of Ireland.\nPublications\nThe archive has published two major printed publications deriving from historical manuscript collections of Irish traditional music: Tunes of the Munster Pipers: Irish Traditional Music from the James Goodman Manuscripts, 500 pre-Famine melodies edited by Dr Hugh Shields from a Trinity College Dublin collection; and The Irish Music Manuscripts of Edward Bunting (1773–1843): An Introduction and Catalogue by Dr Colette Moloney, a guide to 1,000 18th- and early 19th-century melodies and 500 song texts held in Queen's University Belfast. The archive began a programme of publishing historical and archival sound recordings with the release of the EP-CD Adam in Paradise by the singer Eddie Butcher (in conjunction with the Ulster Folk & Transport Museum).\nIn 2011, ITMA released a biography of Butcher, with 67 previously unpublished songs and an accompanying boxset of three CDs.\nBroadcasting\nThe archive has cooperated with RTÉ Radio and RTÉ Television on several projects. In one such project, some of the archives of Irish traditional music of RTÉ Radio, dating back to the 1940s, were remastered, copied and catalogued for public access in the archive. In a television project, archive staff researched the traditional music holdings of the early decades of RTÉ Television (1961–1991) and other television and film archives such as those of Ulster Television in Belfast.\nSee also\n*Music of Ireland\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
