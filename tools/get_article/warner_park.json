In 2024, the Madison Night Mares, a women's collegiate softball team in the Northwoods League, play their home games at Warner Park. Its stadium, nicknamed the \"Duck Pond,\" was built in 1982 for the now-defunct Madison Muskies and has a capacity of 6,750. The Madison Hatters used the stadium in 1994 as did the Madison Black Wolf from 1996-2000. Today it hosts the Madison East High School and Madison La Follette High School baseball teams.\nThe adjacent football field was formerly the home of the Madison Mustangs, a semi-professional football team that played in the Central States Football League in the 1960s and 1970s.\nThe park contains a 9-foot-tall metal replica of the Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World), built in 1950.\nSee also\n* Replicas of the Statue of Liberty\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.cityofmadison.com/parks/parks/park.cfm?id=1368 Official website]\n*[http://www.ballparkdigest.com/visits/index.html?article_id=1301 Ballpark Digest visit to Warner Park]"
