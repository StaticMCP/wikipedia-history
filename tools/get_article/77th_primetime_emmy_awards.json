CBS broadcast the ceremony as part of a rotating deal among the \"Big Four\" networks (ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC) signed in 2018. Additionally, it was announced that the ceremony would be available live and on-demand via Paramount Skydance's streaming service Paramount+. The ceremony was produced by Jesse Collins Entertainment (Jesse Collins, Dionne Harmon, and Jeannae Rouzan-Clay) for the third consecutive year. On April 16, comedian Nate Bargatze was announced as the ceremony's host.\nDuring a press conference held on September 11 promoting the show, producer Collins announced that the ceremony would feature reunions in tribute to the 25th anniversaries of The WB and CW comedy-drama series Gilmore Girls and CBS reality competition series Survivor, and the 35th anniversary of NBC's police procedural franchise Law & Order. Furthermore, the telecast would pay tribute to the 40th anniversary of the NBC sitcom The Golden Girls with country singer Reba McEntire and Little Big Town's Karen Fairchild and Kimberly Schlapman performing the series' theme song, \"Thank You for Being a Friend\". Eric Dane and Jesse Williams were initially scheduled as co-presenters to honor the 20th anniversary of ABC medical drama ''Grey's Anatomy, but Dane was absent from the ceremony while Williams presented alone. According to Collins, he told reporters for Variety'' after the awards ceremony, \"I just was told that he wasn't able to make it, and fortunately, Jesse was able to present by himself.\" The following month, Dane revealed during an interview with The Washington Post that he was recovering from a fall her suffered in his kitchen shortly before the ceremony. He had previously been diagnosed with ALS in April.\nIn an effort to shorten winners' acceptance speeches and have the telecast run on time, Bargatze announced that he would donate $100,000 to the Boys & Girls Club of America. However, for every second an award winner's speech went over the 45-second limit $1,000 would be deducted from the donation. Similarly, for every second under the limit another $1,000 would be added. At the end of the show, the sum of money slated be donated fell $60,000 below zero due to several winners' speech going over the time limit. As a result, Bargatze stated that CBS would donate the full $100,000 to the charity, and that he would add an additional $250,000.\nSeveral other individuals were involved with the production of the telecast. Alex Rudzinski and Rickey Minor served as director and musical director for the ceremony, respectively. Entertainment Tonight co-anchors Kevin Frazier and Nischelle Turner hosted a red carpet pre-show preceding the telecast. Comedians Mikey Day, James Austin Johnson, and Bowen Yang participated in an opening comedy sketch with Bargatze parodying how Philo Farnsworth invented television similar to the \"Washington's Dream\" sketch featured on a 50th season episode of Saturday Night Live.\nCategory and rule changes\nOn January 8, 2025, the Television Academy announced rule changes that affected the directing and guest performer awards. Starting with the 77th ceremony, individuals or directing teams are permitted to submit multiple episodes for consideration in the directing categories, provided that the episodes are from different programs. In previous years, directors or directing teams could only submit one entry per category. Additionally, any performer who previously won or has been nominated in the lead or supporting acting categories would be ineligible to submit a performance of the same character in the same series for consideration in the guest performance categories in subsequent years.\nOn July 22, 2025, it was announced that Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series would be presented at the main ceremony, replacing Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special, which was presented at the Creative Arts ceremony held on September 7. Two weeks later, the Television Academy moved the presentation for Outstanding Variety Special (Live) to the main ceremony as well.\nCritical reviews and viewership\nThe broadcast generally received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Aramide Tinubu, writing for Variety, found the onslaught of surprise winners adding to the excitement, but criticized host Bargatze's performance saying, \"He lacked the enthusiasm and gumption needed to lead a three-hour-long award program and often seemed stunned to be in the spotlight.\" She also noted that the decision to have a forty-five second acceptance speech rule to caused winners to hurriedly rush through their speeches while contrasting that with presenters' introductions that seemed to drag down the ceremony. Daniel Feinberg of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"It was an ill-conceived mess, punctuated by well-deserved wins and emotional and effective speeches, but rarely helped by Bargatze's consistently uneasy performance.\" Brian Lowry of TheWrap commented, \"Unfortunately, racing through the speeches came at too high a cost for the show itself, one that played out in uneven pacing and awkward moments strewn throughout.\" He concluded that due to the time limit, the ceremony was \"an otherwise bland affair, which, one suspects, is just the way the Television Academy wanted it.\"\nIn a more positive review, Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times complimented the show and said of host Bargatze, \"If your goal was to avoid insulted celebrities, social media outrage or petulant notes from the White House, you could have done no better than to hire Bargatze, a clean, calm, classical, noncontroversial, nonpolitical, very funny, very successful comedian.\" He also reserved praise for several presenters such as Stephen Colbert, Brad Garrett, and Ray Romano. Matt Roush wrote in TV Insider, \"There was a sense that for all of the ribbing, this Emmys broadcast was a pleasurable celebration of an ever-evolving medium.\" He also gave high marks toward Bargatze, but criticized the acceptance speech 45-second rule as tiresome. David Nemetz of TVLine \"These Emmys were strangely anti-TV at times, with a self-deprecating tone that bordered on masochistic. But they also showcased the best that TV has to offer, with surprise wins and stirring speeches that reminded us of the sheer quantity of top-notch programming we're blessed to have at our fingertips right now.\"\nThe ceremony was viewed by 7.59&nbsp;million people in the United States, making it the most-viewed Emmys in four years, representing a 10% increase over the previous year's ceremony. It also achieved a 1.28 rating among adults ages 18–49. Ratings figures included those who watched the telecast on CBS or streamed it on Paramount+.\nIn Memoriam\nThe annual In Memoriam segment was presented by Phylicia Rashad, and featured Vince Gill and Lainey Wilson performing Gill's song \"Go Rest High on That Mountain\".\n* Malcolm-Jamal Warner – performer\n* Julian McMahon – performer\n* Valerie Mahaffey – performer\n* Teri Garr – performer\n* Gary Smith – producer\n* Allan Blye – writer, producer\n* Terry Louise Fisher – writer, producer\n* David W.
