He played college football for Minnesota State University, Mankato from 2005 to 2009.\nCollege career\nBattles played college football from 2005 to 2009 as an offensive tackle for the Minnesota State Mavericks.    He was a four-year starter at Mankato, starting in 43 of 46 games while with the program.  According to Mark Craig of the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, Battles \"dominated the NCAA Division II ranks\" as an offensive lineman for MNSU.  Battles credited offensive line coach Mike Cunningham for treating him like a son and keeping him motivated through four years at MNSU.\nProfessional career\nMinnesota Vikings\nIn May 2010, Battles signed as a free agent to play professional football with the Minnesota Vikings. He was moved by the Vikings from an offensive tackle to an offensive guard. He told reporters that the position change presented a challenge due to the differences in footwork and technique, but added, \"When I get an opportunity, I have to make the most of it.\"  Before playing in his first pre-season game in August 2010, Battles told a reporter, \"I haven't even been to an NFL game. To actually play in the first NFL game I go to is awesome. I'm looking forward to it.\"  After completing the entire NFL preseason with the Vikings, Battles was released on September 5, 2010.\nGreen Bay Packers\nIn December 2010, he signed with the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League. He was a member of the Packers practice squad and became \"an unofficial good-luck charm\" for the Packers who went 7-0 after he joined the team (two regular season games and five postseason games) to become the first No. 6 seed from the NFC to play in the Super Bowl.\nBattles was part of the Packers' practice squad at Super Bowl XLV. With the team in Irving, Texas, Battles told a reporter for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, \"I was a Packer fan growing up. Just to be a part of this organization is great -- especially to be a part of the Super Bowl experience. A lot of guys don't get to experience this, even guys who have long careers. It's a blessing to be here and I'm thankful for it.\"\nAt the media day before Super Bowl XLV, Battles showed up wearing a giant \"cheesehead.\"  Photographs of the grinning, 6 foot, 3 inch, 315 pound cheesehead were published in multiple newspapers including a featured picture of the day in the United Kingdom's The Daily Telegraph.  Battles told reporters, \"I'm enjoying every minute of it.\"\nIn August 2011, he joined the Packers for their visit to the White House after winning Super Bowl XLV and was prominently featured in photographs as he stood behind President Barack Obama. When his photograph was printed in newspapers across the country, friends of Battles joked that he \"must have sneaked in there.\" Asked about his prominent placement, Battles told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, \"I just call myself lucky for getting that spot. We went down in rows and I ended up right there in the front.\"\nOn July 31, 2011, the second day of the Packers' 2011 training camp, Battles suffered an injury to his Achilles tendon. He was unable to return to the team after the injury and was waived/injured on August 30, 2011. After clearing waivers, he was placed on injured reserve and released with an injury settlement on September 2.\nGreen Bay Blizzard\nBattles played for the Green Bay Blizzard of the Indoor Football League in 2014.\nCleveland Gladiators\nBattles started the final game of the 2015 season for the Cleveland Gladiators.\nReferences"
