      "text": "# Ann Stewart Anderson\n\nAnn Stewart Anderson (March 3, 1935 – March 4, 2019) was an American artist from Louisville, Kentucky whose paintings \"focused on the rituals of being a woman.\" Anderson is known for her part in creating the collective work, the \"Hot Flash Fan,\" a fabric art work about menopause funded by the National Endowment for the Arts. She was the executive director of the Kentucky Foundation for Women. Anderson died on March 4, 2019, one day after her 84th birthday.\nEarly life and education\nAnn Stewart Anderson was born in Frankfort, Kentucky.  Along with her two sisters, Ann Stewart was a “PK,” a Preacher's Kid, the daughters of Olof Anderson and Martha Ward Jones Anderson. Rev. Anderson led Presbyterian congregations in Lebanon and Richmond, KY., before moving his family to Louisville to head Harvey Browne Memorial Presbyterian Church. She graduated from Wellesley College with a B.A. in History of Art in 1957, and earned a Master in Art (Painting) from The American University in 1961. She attended the Corcoran School of Art and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.\nCareer\nAnderson worked at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in the late 1950s and taught art in the Montgomery County, Maryland schools before relocating to Chicago. From 1964 to 1975, she was employed by the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where she quickly rose to become dean of students, a position that tempered her spirit and tested her diplomatic skills as she dealt with students involved in the heady days of the late 1960s, including the protests around the Democratic Convention of 1968. After two unsuccessful attempts at applying for the Mary Elvira Stevens Traveling Fellowship, awarded to Wellesley alumnae, she won the fellowship in 1975, when she was 40. With the Stevens Fellowship, Ann Stewart spent a year in Egypt working on a photographic project, finding scenes of daily life from modern-day Cairo and Egyptian villages (plowing, planting, harvesting; making beer and bread and mud-bricks; plucking ducks; fishing with nets in the river delta) that mirrored those depicted in Pharaonic-era tomb paintings from 3, 000 years ago.  After returning to Kentucky in 1975, Anderson served as artist-in-residence at St. Francis High School in Louisville and later as executive director of the Kentucky Foundation for Women. In 1985, she collaborated on an NEA-funded project called Hot Flash Fan with the feminist artist Judy Chicago, a giant multi-media project addressing menopause that included work by over 50 artists. A 60-year retrospective exhibition of her work, \"Looking Back/Moving Forward,\" was mounted at PYRO Art Gallery in Louisville in 2009.\nAwards\n2002: Individual Grant, The Kentucky Foundation for Women,\n1998: Professional Development Grant, Kentucky Arts Commission,\n1998: Sallie Bingham Award, Kentucky Foundation for Women,\n1991: Southern Arts Federation, New Forms Regional Initiative Grant,\n1988: Purchase Award, Kentucky Graphics,\n1987: Individual Grant, The Kentucky Foundation for Women,\n1986: Charles Logan Memorial Prize, Water Tower Art Association, Water Tower Annual,\n1985: Robert Cooke Enlow Memorial Purchase Award, Evansville Museum of Art and Science,\n1975: Mary Elvira Stevens Traveling Fellowship, Wellesley College,\nCollections\nCitizens Bank, Glasgow KY; Homequity Wilton, CT; Drake Hotel, Chicago; Turtle Wax Company, Chicago; Brown Foreman Distillers; Atlantic Richfield Corporation; Alabama Power Company;  Colwell Financial; Central Bank, Lexington; Hilliard Lyons, Louisville; University of Kentucky Art Museum\nExhibits\n:1958 13th Area Exhibition, The Corcoran Gallery of Art,  Washington DC\n:1959 14th Area Exhibition, The Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington DC\n:1960 Pyramid Gallery, Richmond VA\n:1960 LaRue Gallery, Washington D.C.\n:1962 15th Area Exhibition, The Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington DC\n:1962 American Art League Show, Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC\n:1962 La Boheme, Arlington VA\n:1963 Art Center Gallery, Louisville KY\n:1966 National Show of Drawings, Mulvane Art Center, Topeka KS\n:1966 Artists of Kentucky Area, J.
