Sources published during the regnal year 39 Vict refer to this session as 39 Vict, because, at that time, it was not known when the session would end.\nDuring the year 1876 and the session 39 & 40 Vict, the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed 81 public general acts; 52 public acts of a local character, which were placed amongst the local and personal acts; 243 local acts; 2 private acts printed by the Queen's Printer; and 1 private act not printed.\nThe number shown after each act's short title, popular title or long title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held.\nSome of these acts have a short title. Some of these acts have never had a short title. Some of these acts have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\nPublic general acts\n*Agricultural Holdings (England) Act (1875) Amendment Act 1876 c. 74 — repealed by Agricultural Holdings (England) Act 1883 (46 & 47 Vict. c. 61)\n*Annual Turnpike Acts Continuance Act 1876 c. 39 — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1898 (61 & 62 Vict. c. 22)\n*Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 c. 59 — repealed by Constitutional Reform Act 2005 (c. 4)\n*Appropriation Act 1876 c. 60 — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1883 (46 & 47 Vict. c. 39)\n*Bankers' Books Evidence Act 1876 c. 48 — repealed by Bankers' Books Evidence Act 1879 (42 & 43 Vict. c. 11)\n*Bishopric of Truro Act 1876 c. 54 — repealed by Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1973 (c. 39)\n*Burgesses Qualification (Scotland) Act 1876 c. 12 — repealed by Town Councils (Scotland) Act 1900 (63 & 64 Vict. c. 49)\n*Burgh Wards (Scotland) Act 1876 c. 25 — repealed by Town Councils (Scotland) Act 1900 (63 & 64 Vict. c. 49)\n*Burghs Gas Supply (Scotland) Act 1876 c. 49 — repealed by Gas Act 1948 (11 & 12 Geo. 6. c. 67)\n*Cattle Disease (Ireland) Act 1876 c. 51 — repealed by Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act 1878 (41 & 42 Vict. c. 74)\n*Chairman of Quarter Sessions (Ireland) Jurisdiction Act 1876 c. 71\n*Chelsea Hospital Act 1876 c. 14\n*Commons Act 1876 c. 56\n*Consolidated Fund Act (4,080,000l.) c. 2.
