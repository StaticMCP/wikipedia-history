It is taken from Mao's essay titled Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan written in 1927 during the Land Revolution. It means that a revolution cannot be gentle and soft, but determined and thorough, and it is a violent and bloody action of one class overthrowing another.\nIn this report, Mao stated that \"A revolution is not a dinner party, or writing an essay, or painting a picture, or doing embroidery; it cannot be so refined, so leisurely and gentle, so temperate, kind, courteous, restrained and magnanimous. A revolution is an insurrection, an act of violence by which one class overthrows another.\"\nBased on this view, historian Zhang Ming further pointed out that \"a revolution is not a dinner party, a revolution is a petition to eat\". The saying is also the basis of a political joke: \"for many cadres  Geming bushi qingke jiushi chifan 'Revolution is not entertaining guests, just eating dinner [at public expense or at the cost of the nouveaux riches].\"\nIn late 1966, during the early Cultural Revolution, the Chinese composer Li Jiefu (李劫夫, 1913-1976) composed a communist revolutionary song based on Mao's saying, entitled \"Geming Bu Shi Qingke Chifan\"《革命不是请客吃饭》(Revolution is Not a Dinner Party), and it was recorded and disseminated across China soon thereafter.\nSee also\n*Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun\nReferences"
