He headed the Commission of the Holy See for Religious Relations with the Jews. He spent most of his career in the diplomatic service of the Holy See both in Rome and overseas. He was made a cardinal in 1991.\nEarly life\nCassidy was born in Sydney on 5 July 1924. His parents were not Catholic and divorced while he was just one. When he was a student at Parramatta High School, a priest from St Felix's parish discouraged Cassidy from becoming a priest because he had not finished his secondary education, had not studied in Catholic schools and his family background was \"unsuitable\". Due to financial difficulties after his grandfather died, he left school to support his grandmother in 1939 and worked at the New South Wales Department of Road Transport as a junior clerk. In 1942, he presented his case for entering the seminary directly to Archbishop Norman Gilroy of Sydney, who accepted his arguments. Cassidy entered the local seminary, St Columba's Catholic College in Springwood, in February 1943.\nCassidy was ordained a priest of the Archdiocese of Sydney on 23 July 1949 at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, by Cardinal Gilroy. Edward Bede Clancy, like Cassidy a future cardinal, was ordained at the same time. He volunteered to transfer to the Diocese of Wagga Wagga and in January 1950 he was assigned to the small parish of Yenda.\nDiplomatic service\nIn 1952, Bishop Francis Henschke of Wagga Wagga asked him if he would like to go to Rome to study canon law; he agreed and left for Rome on 1 September 1952. While studying in Rome, he resided at Collegio Sant'Apollinare, next to Piazza Navona. He completed his education studying at the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome, where he obtained a doctorate in canon law in July 1955 with a dissertation on the history and juridical nature of apostolic delegations, and at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy, also in Rome, from October 1953, where he obtained a diploma in diplomatic studies. After finishing his studies, he joined the Vatican diplomatic service in July 1955.\nHe served in the nunciatures in India, Portugal, and Ireland. He was appointed counsellor of the apostolic delegation in the United States in June 1967, but as the nuncio in Ireland, Archbishop Giuseppe Sensi, was then transferred to the nunciature in Portugal, Cassidy was required to stay in Dublin until the following November.  He then did not take up his role in the US, and was named instead counselor of the nunciature in El Salvador, where he remained until the end of 1969, at which point he became counselor of the nunciature in Argentina.\nOn 27 October 1970 he was appointed titular bishop of Amantia and Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to the Republic of China. He was consecrated on 15 November by Cardinal Jean-Marie Villot assisted by Archbishops Giovanni Benelli and Matthew Beovich, representing Cardinal Sergio Pignedoli. On 31 January 1973 he was additionally named the first Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to Bangladesh (Cassidy relocated to Dhaka shortly thereafter) and Apostolic Delegate to Burma. On 25 March 1979, Pope John Paul II appointed him Apostolic Delegate to Southern Africa and Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to Lesotho. His term as Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to China only ended in April 1979; he was the last to hold that title. On 6 November 1984, he was appointed Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to the Netherlands.\nRoman Curia\nOn 30 May 1988 he was appointed Substitute of the Secretariat of State in the Roman Curia. After only a year he was appointed president of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity. In the consistory of 28 June 1991 Pope John Paul II created him Cardinal-Deacon of S. Maria in Via Lata. On 26 February 2002 he took the option open to cardinal deacons to be elevated to the rank of cardinal priest after ten years as a cardinal deacon.\nIn 1999, Cassidy was jointly responsible for the publication of the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification, widely received as a landmark achievement for ecumenism in bridging the centuries-long divide between Catholics and Lutherans. Reflecting on his involvement, Cassidy joked that signing it would be the one thing he could confidently cite on his behalf on judgement day.\nRetirement\nWhen he retired in 2001, he returned to his native Australia, where he substituted for local priests on occasion and served as chaplain to the Italian-speaking community of Newcastle.\nHis book titled Rediscovering Vatican II – Ecumenism and Interreligious Dialogue, was published 2005 and marked the 40th anniversary of the Vatican's ecumenism declaration Nostra aetate. The book made a significant contribution to ongoing international inter-religious dialogue.\nCassidy died in Newcastle, Australia, on 10 April 2021 at the age of 96.\nHonours\nIn 1990, Cassidy was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) in \"recognition of service to the [sic] religion and to international affairs\".\nIn 2006, the LDS Church in Australia presented Cassidy with an award for his efforts to bring better understanding to the people of the world. Presenting the \"John Simpson Standing for Something\" award to Cassidy for his role in building interfaith relations across the world, LDS Elder Paul Sybrowsky said that \"Latter-day Saints have seen that Cardinal Cassidy is indeed a man filled with faith and courage to help make this a better world for all to live in.\" In a message of congratulations, Premier Morris Iemma (also a Catholic) said that \"no Australian has risen to greater eminence in the Catholic Church, and none has been such a devoted servant of the cause of ecumenism and inter-faith dialogue.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bcassidye.html Cardinal Cassidy on Catholic hierarchy.org]\n* [http://www.catholic.org/featured/headline.php?ID=1557 Interview with Cardinal Cassidy]\n* [http://www.cathnews.com/news/510/88.php news item on his book]"
