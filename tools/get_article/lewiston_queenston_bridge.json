The bridge was officially opened on November 1, 1962. It is an international bridge between the United States and Canada. It connects Interstate 190 in the town of Lewiston, New York to Highway 405 in the community of Queenston, Ontario. The Lewiston–Queenston Bridge is architecturally similar to the Rainbow Bridge at nearby Niagara Falls.\nCustoms plazas are located on both ends of the bridge, with tolls only being charged on entering Canada ($6.00 USD or $8.50 CAD per passenger automobile). The bridge accepts E-ZPass electronic toll collection and houses the second Canadian E-ZPass collection facility, after the nearby Peace Bridge. Also, two duty-free stores are located between the two plazas.\nThe bridge permits no pedestrians, but bicycles and licensed taxi service is permitted. The Lewiston–Queenston Bridge lacks expedited border clearance facilities for NEXUS and FAST card holders traveling from the United States into Canada, but does have a NEXUS lane for travel into the United States.\nGantries have lights indicating the direction of traffic as the lanes are reversible. Speed limit is posted in kilometres and miles per hour ( limit) along the bridge. Canadian and United States flags fly at the midpoint on the south side of the bridge.\nBorder crossing and toll\nThe crossing is the fourth-busiest on the Canada–United States border, with delays of up to two hours. It is on the most direct route connecting the US Interstate system to Toronto and Detroit. Canada replaced its border inspection facilities in 2011. The United States announced plans in 2016 to spend  to upgrade the primary inspection facilities. Construction was completed in 2022. Both facilities are open 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\nThe toll for use of the bridge is payable upon entering Canada only.\n* Canada-bound:\n** 10 customs booths for cars/RVs\n** 5 customs booths for trucks\n** Dedicated Bus Processing Lane\n** parking area for trucks for inspections\n** helipad\n** 6 toll booths\n* US-bound:\n** 6 customs booths for cars/buses/RVs\n** 3 customs booths for trucks\n** parking area for trucks for inspections\nPassenger vehicles pay a toll only when entering Canada from the US. The cost is $6.00 USD or $8.50 CAD, as of May 1, 2025, payable by cash in both currencies, debit, Visa, or Mastercard (CAD only) or E-ZPass (USD only).\nHigh mast lighting is used on the Canadian side, with regular light standards used for bridge and the US side.\nPrevious suspension bridges\nThe Queenston-Lewiston suspension bridge, 1915.\nThe first Queenston-Lewiston Bridge was built in 1851 by engineer Edward Serrell and wrecked by wind in 1864 (or 1854). Newspapers reported that bridge deck had been destroyed in February 1864 by wind which caused main deck to sway excessively due to earlier removal of stabilizing guy-wires by local authorities, however main suspension cables remained fully intact. Some of the cables were still in place as late as 1895. The road deck span was about . The suspension bridge design was unusual because the cables were attached to the cliff with only small towers. This made the road deck span shorter than the cable span of .\nA second bridge called the Queenston-Lewiston Bridge, a suspension bridge was later constructed. Located   north of the current bridge, this suspension bridge was originally built near the present location of the Rainbow Bridge, and was moved to Queenston in 1898 by R.S. Buck and engineer L.L. Buck, after the completion of the Rainbow Bridge's predecessor, the Upper Steel Arch Bridge. The suspension bridge was dismantled in 1963 after the current bridge was completed and opened.\nReminders of the earlier bridge are still visible in the area. First is two columns that lie within the Earl W. Brydges Artpark State Park. Second is the original plaque, now located midspan alongside the road, right at the border between the two countries. The plaque is flanked by a US and a Canadian flag.\nThe supports are part of Owen Morrell's Omega, a steel sculpture and observation platform added in 1981. Two columns remain on the Canadian side at the foot of York Street in a wooded area now known as York Park.\nPlane crash\nOn December 1, 1961, while the bridge was under construction, an F-100 fighter (variously reported as belonging to the United States Air Force or Air National Guard) caught fire just after taking off from a base near Niagara Falls, New York.  To protect people in the city, the pilot steered it into the Niagara River gorge before safely ejecting; but this aimed it near the construction site. It passed not far over the heads of workers near the site, missed a construction crane by about , and crashed into the gorge side about 600 feet beyond the bridge before falling into the river.\nSee also\n*List of bridges documented by the Historic American Engineering Record in New York\n*List of bridges in Canada\n*List of bridges in the United States by height\n*List of Canada–United States border crossings\n*List of crossings of the Niagara River\n*List of international bridges in North America\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.niagarafallsbridges.com/ Niagara Falls Bridge Commission]\n*[http://www.nflibrary.ca/nfplindex/results.asp?action=browse&q=295&key=371 Images from the Niagara Historic Digital Collections]\n*[http://niagaratraffic.ca/bridge/ Live Traffic Camera of Lewiston Queenston Bridge]\n*[http://www.nflibrary.ca/nfplindex/results.asp?action=browse&q=349&key=85392 Lewiston Queenston Bridge Collection of Images] Niagara Falls Public Library (Ont.)\n*"
