A report of the Local Government Boundary Commission for England published in November 1978 set out proposals for changes to the wards of Liverpool City Council, maintaining the number of councillors at 99 representing 33 wards. Picton ward was represented by three councillors.\nThe report describes the boundaries of Picton ward as \"Commencing at a point where Smithdown Road meets the eastern boundary of Smithdown Ward, thence generally northeastwards, generally northwestwards and southeastwards along said boundary to the southern boundary of Kensington Ward, thence eastwards along said boundary to Rathbone Road, thence southwestwards along said road to Shanklin Road, thence eastwards and southwards along said road to Sandown Road, thence eastwards and southwestwards along said road and continuing southwestwards along Sandown Lane to High Street, thence southeastwards along said street to Grange Terrace, thence southwestwards along said terrace and continuing southwards along the path across Wavertree Playground, between Grange Terrace and Smithdown Road, to Smithdown Road, thence westwards along said road to Garmoyle Road, thence northwestwards along said road to Wellington Avenue, thence southwestwards along said avenue to Smithdown Road, thence northwestwards along said road to the point of commencement\".\n2004 boundaries\nA review by the Boundary Committee for England recommended that the council was formed of a reduced number of 90 members elected from 30 wards. The ward was formed from the former Picton ward, losing some of the pre-2004 ward and gaining from the former Kensington, Smithdown and Arundel wards. The ward was part of the Liverpool Wavertree Parliamentary constituency.\nThe population at the 2011 census was 17,009, and at the 2021 Census was 18,906.\nCouncillors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Election!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor\n|-\n| 2004\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Laurence Sidorczuk (LD)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Ian Jobling (LD)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Andrew Makinson (LD)\n|-\n| 2006\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Laurence Sidorczuk (LD)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Ian Jobling (LD)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Andrew Makinson (LD)\n|-\n| 2007\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Laurence Sidorczuk (LD)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Ian Jobling (LD)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Andrew Makinson (LD)\n|-\n| 2008\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Laurence Sidorczuk (LD)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Ian Jobling (LD)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Andrew Makinson (LD)\n|-\n| 2010\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Tim Beaumont (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"| Ian Jobling (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Andrew Makinson (LD)\n|-\n| 2011\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Tim Beaumont (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Abdul Qadir (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Andrew Makinson (LD)\n|-\n| 2012\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Tim Beaumont (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Abdul Qadir (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Nathalie Nicholas (Lab)\n|-\n| 2014\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Tim Beaumont (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Abdul Qadir (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Nathalie Nicholas (Lab)\n|-\n| 2015\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Tim Beaumont (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Abdul Qadir (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Nathalie Nicholas (Lab)\n|-\n| 2016\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Tim Beaumont (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Abdul Qadir (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Nathalie Nicholas (Lab)\n|-\n| 2018\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Paul Kenyon (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Abdul Qadir (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Nathalie Nicholas (Lab)\n|-\n| 2019\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#FF8C00\"| Calvin Smeda (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Abdul Qadir (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Nathalie Nicholas (Lab)\n|-\n| 2021\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Calvin Smeda (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Abdul Qadir (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Nathalie Nicholas (Lab)\n|-\n|}\nindicates seat up for re-election after boundary changes.\nindicates seat up for re-election.\nindicates change in affiliation.\nindicates seat up for re-election after casual vacancy.\nNotes\n*Cllr Ian Jobling (Lib Dem, 2007) defected to the Labour Party and was subsequently elected as a Labour candidate in the Allerton & Hunts Cross ward.\n*Cllr Paul Kenyon (Labour, 2018) resigned from the council in September 2019\nElection results\nElections of the 2020s\n}}\n13.78\n}}\n10.15\n}}\n2.52\n}}\n0.85\n}}\n1.48\n}}\n23.93\n}}\n34.11\n}}\n1.79\n}}\n33.90\n}}\nElections of the 2010s\n}}\n9.61\n}}\n8.23\n}}\n1.23\n}}\n2.36\n}}\n1.49\n}}\nN/A\n}}\n17.84\n}}\n34.32\n}}\n0.39\n}}\n}}\n13.75\n}}\n9.20\n}}\n3.69\n}}\n1.02\n}}\n2.23\n}}\n22.96\n}}\n0.85\n}}\n0.46\n}}\n}}\n10.60\n}}\n4.05\n}}\n4.29\n}}\n0.38\n}}\nN/A\n}}\nN/A\n}}\n14.66\n}}\n4.25\n}}\n1.11\n}}\n}}\n3.66\n}}\n2.21\n}}\n3.15\n}}\n2.31\n}}\n0.38\n}}\n5.88\n}}\n27.06\n}}\n0.44\n}}\n2.94\n}}\n}}\n3.47\n}}\n1.08\n}}\n4.75\n}}\n0.03\n}}\n1.00\n}}\n0.62\n}}\n2.45\n}}\n27.82\n}}\n1.19\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\nElections of the 2000s\n}}\n}}\n}}\nAfter the boundary change of 2004 the whole of Liverpool City Council faced election.
