The temple is dedicated to Ardhanarishvara, a composite form of the Hindu deities Shiva and his consort Parvati.\nThe Chenkottu Velavar Temple, dedicated to Murugan (Kartikeya), is also situated on the same hill, and a separate temple for Ganesha, called the Ucchi Pillaiyar Kovil, exists adjacent to the main temple complex.\nHistory\nThe temple is one of the shrines of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams praised in the Tevaram hymns of the Saivite saints. Both Sambandar, who lived in the 5th century, and Arunagirinathar, have composed hymns celebrating the temple. In the ancient work Cilappatikaram, the place is mentioned by the name Neduvelkundru.\nThe temple is also the subject of a popular composition by Muthuswami Dīkshitar, Arthanārishvaram, set in the raga Kumudakriya.\nImportant renovations were made during the reigns of the Chola, Pandya and Nayak kings, and by a British colonial officer, Davis, whose image can be found in the Mukkoottu Vinayaka temple.\nThe temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu.\nLegends\nIt is believed that Adi Kesava Perumāl, a form of Vishnu enshrined here, instructed Parvati on the Kedara Gowri Vratam, which she performed to unite with Shiva as Ardhanareeswarar.\nOnce Brahma, Indra and the sage Bhringi went to Kailash to worship Shiva. Everyone first paid their respects to Parvati and then proceeded to Shiva. However, Bhringi directly marched to Shiva. Parvati, annoyed by his act, sucked the flesh from the sage's body to stop him proceeded. Shiva blessed Bhringi with a third leg, to counter Parvati's curse. With her austerities, Parvati appeased Shiva to grant position in his body, thus leading to the half-male, half-female manifestation as Ardhanareeswarar.\nAnother legend states that there was a battle between the serpent Adishesha and the wind-god Vayu for superiority. The sages set a challenge that Adishesha had to cling to Mount Meru and Vayu has to release him by his power. Adishesha succeeded. Vayu, out of anger, stopped the airflow in the world; as a result all living beings fainted. The sages convinced Vayu to release his hold. By the sudden release of air by Vayu lead the top of the mountain with the head of Adisesha, thrown into earth on three places with flesh and blood and making it red and thus the name Chengodu. There is a 60&nbsp;ft long snake carved on the hill, and hence the name as Nagamalai. Sambandar composed the Tiruneelakandapathigam here, to help rid fellow travellers of an affliction. Saint Arunagirinathar has also composed Tirupuggal on Murugan here.\nMargatha Lingam\nIn this temple, Emerald Lingam is established.\nMargatha Linga darshan takes place solely in the early mornings of the margali month between 3:30 and 7 am and during the daily Ucchi Kala Poojai.\nArchitecture\nThe sacred hill is about 650&nbsp;ft. high, and a climb of 1156 steps leads worshippers to the temple at its peak.

The hill contains about 350 acres of land, which lies 2000&nbsp;ft about sea level.\nOn top of the hill, the main gopuram (Tower) with 5 tiers is on the north side of the hill.

There is a water spring at the foot of the image, which is said to have been divinely manifested \"Uli Padaa Uruvam\" ('sculptured without tools'), also known to be Navabashana type. There are many mandapams on the way for people who alight steps to take rest.
