Following the loss, Holyfield parted ways with long-time trainers Lou Duva and George Benton and replaced them with Emanuel Steward. Holyfield claimed he made the switch to help \"rekindle his enthusiasm for boxing.\" Steward also made the decision to reduce Holyfield's sparring sessions in an effort to keep Holyfield fresh, stating \"He's got to start a whole new career if he's going to continue boxing\". In the months after the loss, Holyfield mulled a comeback, but in April 1993, he would reach an agreement with Bowe for a rematch later in the year. As part of the contract, both fighters agreed to have one fight before the rematch. Bowe announced that he would defend his heavyweight championship against Jesse Ferguson in May, while Holyfield decided to meet Alex Stewart in a rematch of their 1989 fight in June.\nThe fight\nIn contrast to their thrilling 1989 fight, Holyfield controlled almost the entire fight as Stewart offered little offense. A right uppercut landed by Holyfield towards the end of the first round opened a cut beside Stewart's left eye, though it was not as severe as the cut he suffered in the 1989 fight. The fight would go the full 12 rounds with Holyfield winning lopsidedly on all three of the judge's scorecards with 2 scores of 118–110 and one score of 119–109.\nAftermath\nSteward blamed the lackluster fight on Stewart, stating \"He acted like he didn't want to fight. I was looking for this great war, I was nervous. Then he comes out and looks like he wants to go to bed.\" Stewart was also critical of his own performance. \"Of course this wasn't one of my better performances, I couldn't throw punches, I couldn't get off. I thought I could fight a defensive fight until about the sixth round and then try to go for the kill, but I couldn't get any combinations or anything at all. I have to apologize to everyone because I did not fight a very good fight.\"\nFight card\nConfirmed bouts:\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"font-size: 85%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"| Weight Class\n! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"| Weight\n! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"|\n! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"| vs.\n! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"|\n! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"| Method\n! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"| Round\n! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"| Time\n! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"| Notes\n|-\n|Heavyweight\n|200+ lb\n|Evander Holyfield\n|def.\n|Alex Stewart\n|align=center|UD\n|align=center|12\n|\n|-\n|Middleweight\n|160 lb\n|Vinny Pazienza\n|def.\n|Lloyd Honeyghan\n|align=center|TKO\n|align=center|10/12\n|align=center|\n|-\n|Super featherweight\n|130 lb\n|John John Molina\n|def.\n|Manuel Medina\n|align=center|UD\n|align=center|12\n|\n|\n|-\n|Middleweight\n|160 lb\n|Raúl Márquez\n|def\n|Tommy Small\n|align=center|UD\n|align=center|8\n|\n|-\n|Lightweight\n|135 lb\n|Ivan Robinson\n|def\n|Leon Bostic\n|align=center|UD\n|align=center|6\n|\n|}\nReferences"
