Her silver armor also turns gold to reflect this change, and in this state is powerful enough to overwhelm Elina, Ymir, and Mirim, but loses all sense of reason and turns into a berserker, unable to distinguish friend from foe. Through her demonic powers, she fights on horseback with the aid of her spectral steed , and wields , a broadsword that can be converted to a lance at will. In this state, she calls herself the .\n:It is hinted through flashbacks of the second ''Queen's Blade'' anime adaptation that Annelotte may be Aldra's long lost sister, as a white-haired figure resembling her can be seen walking with the latter.

Sainyang, the younger sister and more taciturn of the two (she only whispers to her sister's ear), can use arts with a mysterious power similar to magic, but is often seen spacing out and is very weak, so she's not very useful in battle.

She is equipped with the Hyper Vibration Armor and armed with the Hyper Vibration Sword  – a sword with a chainsaw-like edge, and the Hyper Vibration shield, all of which are powered by the Hyper Vibration Crystal. Despite being given the armor and weapons, she has a weak-willed personality. She eventually leaves the Queen's Army for the Rebel Army after Ymir tries to destroy her home village, in order to punish the villagers for sheltering Annelotte.

It is later revealed that this \"Great Power\" is the , a massive mobile fortress that Yuit's mother Cyan once sought. She sometimes greets her invaders with either a fascinating dance or a death dance. Luna Luna has the bravery of a warrior and the character of an innocent maiden, and her fighting dance is a mixture of both.

During that time, she met Ymir following a skirmish with some drunken women, and has grown acquainted to her despite the latter's merchant-like personality. It is also shown that she tends to rush with her Holy Poses, often rendering them ineffective.\n:Sigui is very eager to bring down the Rebel Army, who she considers to be a band of heretics, and sees their leader Annelotte, who carries demon blood, as an abomination. She also considers the use of alchemy as a heresy (even the Holy Dynasty has divided opinions on this topic). She is armed with the  and , and her fighting skills rivals Annelotte's. Like Melpha in ''Queen's Blade'', she is also a user of the \"Divine Power\", the manifestation of God's miracles utilized by the provocative \"Holy Poses\".

However, she was not pushed around by Nanael's whims because of her \"my pace\" nature (doing things in her own pace), and it actually looked like she was the one in control. Despite this, they get along well. Nanael, who went on a rampage, ordered Laila to clean the chaos on the human world with the \"Divine Punishment\" using Holy Milk. Because she is not a true angel, Laila must wear the sacred tool , an artificial wing, to fly, and she is armed with the Heavenly Rifle which fires Holy Milk. At first Laila looks very cool-headed, but she makes so many mistakes that she might actually be very dumb. She has the power to grow in size up to a giant form, that she uses to stop the fortress Bligh when the Rebel Army tries to attack Gainos.\n:Laila is illustrated by Hirotaka Akaga.\nNeutral\n;|宝石姫 エイリン|Hōseki Hime Eirin|Gemstone Princess Eilin}}\n:\n:Eilin is a Dwarf from the Gemstone Mountains, a mountain in the Continent that produces gems.

She acts aloof when she talks, but she still follows her earnestly. Even if she were to lose her, she would follow her with her full spirit. She wields a huge nodachi called  which she carries on her back (she claims on her profile that she picked it up somewhere). She is also able to play a whistle made from seashells that boosts her and her comrades' strength.

She suddenly appeared 100 years ago, and the swamp which became her residence gradually expanded by her magic, as she is trying to change the whole Continent into a barren land. She despises the Queen's Blade tournament, as it maintains the present world. With techniques to manipulate departed souls, to summon and to curse, it has reached the extreme that her magical power is perhaps the strongest in the Continent. The true character of the Swamp Witch has the form of a wicked spirit, and her soul and magic are confined in a treasure that has a spider-like form. Unless she parasitizes on an excellent body, her power will be extremely restricted. However, the Swamp Witch has finally obtained the supreme body called Werbellia, and is able to display her complete power. Werbellia is the demonic daughter of the Demon King who lives in the Netherworld, and is Aldra's and Annelotte's mother. She \"became\" the Swamp Witch around the end of the penultimate Queen's Blade, in an incident that happened several years ago.\n:The Swamp Witch's behavior is basically decided by vague \"fortune-telling\". For example, according to a prediction, she cannot kill the beautiful fighters by her own hands; it was predicted that the beautiful fighters would harm themselves, so she weakened the beautiful fighters by casting a curse crueler than killing them. This was known as the . Although she's like an incarnation of evil, she is a being adored by most of her subordinates. Apart from her many unintelligible remarks, she is generous and magnanimous, with an evil charisma.\n:Werbellia makes a brief cameo appearance in the final episode of ''Queen's Blade: Beautiful Fighters'', where she appears (albeit in hooded form) to curse Tomoe during the latter's journey back to Hinomoto.

She was once respected as an honest, just and upright person, but after she became the Queen, she proclaimed herself as \"chosen by the Gods\" and abolished the Queen's Blade tournament altogether. She encouraged the research of the , and civilization progressed very quickly with the effort. She also invalidated the traditional aristocrat system to give a chance of prosperity to all the people regardless of their birth.\n:By becoming Queen, however, Claudette's strictness has increased, and thus became a ruthless tyrant. Those who break the law are punished without mercy, and any opposition to the Queen are completely obliterated by a powerful military force. Along with a new set of armor, her zweihander, Thunderclap, has also gained a significant upgrade through the power of the Wizard Stones (courtesy of Ymir), and can now manipulate lightning without readying the sword.

She still has a huge sister complex for her older sister Leina, who has gone missing prior to the series' start. This has resulted in her being mentally unstable and having a sadistic, if not psychotic, personality. Known to be the cruelest of the Assassins of the Fang, she will take down anyone who goes against the Queen. She wears a brand-new set of armor, though she still retains her trademark claw gauntlet and cat-eared headband from her previous outfit.

However during her travels, she contracted a mysterious disease that requires her to sleep 16 hours a day. Not only does she need to sleep that long, she also experiences sudden cases of narcolepsy, often requiring her to retreat to her hideout whenever she feels drowsiness. Nonetheless, she is a well-revered warrior who is loved by many. Due to the fighting spirit ingrained in her body, even when she falls asleep due to her curse, she viciously attacks all who approach her carelessly. She has joined and helped Annelotte's party on several occasions, but has a tendency to act alone. Although she does not have a gamebook in Rebellion, she has appeared in all other media. Created by Hirokazu Hisayuki.\n;\n:\n:Formerly known as the , Ymir was a former participant in the Queen's Blade tournament. She had her weapon broken during a fight with Claudette, and by her clan's law is forced to submit to her demands. She became one of Queen Claudette's closest associates and, along with her rich knowledge of alchemy, invented various items to strengthen the Queen's Army. She became much cooler in personality, no longer being afraid of snakes, and rumors from those who knew the often teary-eyed Ymir say she is now another person entirely. She now wields twin battle axes as weapons, and wears a new set of Dwarven armor modeled after the Gothic Lolita style of fashion. Created by Natsuki Mibu.\n;\n:\n:The former Queen and victor of the last two Queen's Blade tournaments, where she was known as the .

Her happy life was short-lived when the war between the Queen's Army and the Rebel Army spread through the whole Continent, and to protect her beloved husband, she was determined to throw herself in the fight, using her innate summoning skills once again. Used to her work as a Gondolier, she was convinced by Ymir to join the Queen's Army when she saw Annelotte (actually Melona, posing as her) acting rude towards a girl from her town.\n:She summoned and made a contract with the Underworld dwellers }} and }} (an amalgamation of the demon Belphegor). However, both demons are secretly plotting to eat Aldra when given the opportunity.

After awakening her ultimate skills in the tournament and returning to Hinomoto, Tomoe was acknowledged as the supreme warrior of Masakado Shrine, and was given the title of Sword Saint Priestess from the High Priest. However, during her travels in the Continent, a curse of blindness was cast on her by the Swamp Witch. Despite her loss of sight, Tomoe did not lose her burning heart and gentle smile. The day her eyes are opened again will probably be the day when the world will submit to Hinamoto's sword skills. When Annelotte travelled to Hinomoto, Tomoe trained her to be calm and observe her foes when she fought, but couldn't join her quest, as Tomoe chose to stay and keep protecting her village. Although she does not have a gamebook in Rebellion, she has appeared in all other media. Created by Eiwa.\n;\n:\n:The benevolent Bandit of the Wilderness and a friendly rival to Leina who, following the tournament, resumed her training. As a result, her muscle strength increased to the point where she discards her mace for hand-to-hand combat.

Created by Eiwa.\n;\n:\n:The Ancient Princess of the Amara Kingdom, revived by the power of the Swamp Witch, and one of the participants in the Queen's Blade Tournament. With the help of her eloquent and good partner, the Living Scepter Setora, after the tournament she succeeded in reviving her home, the Amara Kingdom, in a small desert. She became the Queen of the small kingdom. Going at her own pace as usual, she doesn't appear to have changed much since becoming the Queen, but she now seems to think about the ideal way she ought to manage her \"country\" and her \"people\". Currently, she loves the citizens of the new Kingdom of Amara (with a population of 98 people) from the bottom of her heart. In the ruins of the Amara desert she found an ancient treasure, the , that allowed her to manipulate anyone, but she was forced to hand it over to the Swamp Witch. She has no intention of joining Annelotte in their fight, and is only interested in the fortress the Rebel Army acquired. Although she does not have a gamebook in Rebellion, she has appeared in all other media. Created by F.S.\n;\n:\n:Not much is known about her current role, but Melona seems to have left the Swamp Witch and is now considered part of the Queen's Army. In fact, she poses as Ymir as a spy for the Swamp Witch (implying that she captured the real Ymir in the castle in the Anime), by aiding the Queen in power, making Mirim a guinea pig for the Hyper vibration Suit Experiment, tricking Aldra to help the queen and trying to make Annelotte to lose her good side as a Demon form. All in order to make conflicts between continents and the rebellions, so the Swamp Witch can attack all of them and to rule all over the continents.
