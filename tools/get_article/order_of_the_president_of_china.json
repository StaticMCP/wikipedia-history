It is used to promulgate laws, appoint and remove members of the State Council, confer state medals or honors, declare a state of emergency or a state of war, or issue amnesty orders or mobilization orders. Presidential Orders have been issued by the President since the Constitution of the People's Republic of China was enacted in 1954. The position of the President was vacant and abolished for a time until it was restored at the fourth session of the 5th National People's Congress in 1982. Presidential Orders are believed to record the powers granted to the President by the Constitution and reflect the trajectory of China's legal system construction.\nHistory\n\"Order\" is one of the oldest types of Chinese administrative documents and the only type of official document in China that has been used since the pre-Qin period. On September 27, 1949, on the eve of the proclamation of the People's Republic of China, the first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference passed the \"Organic Law of the Central People's Government\". On September 30, the Central People's Government Committee was elected, and the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government were elected. On October 1, the Central People's Government Committee held its first meeting in the Qinzheng Hall of Zhongnanhai and announced that the Central People's Government had officially assumed its new office. The Chairman, Vice Chairman and members of the Central People's Government took office. After that, Mao Zedong signed a number of \"Orders of the Chairman of the Central People's Government\" or \"Orders of the Central People's Government\" in the name of the Chairman of the Central People's Government. For example, on April 30, 1950, Chairman Mao signed the Order of the Chairman of the Central People's Government to promulgate the \"Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China\".  On September 20, 1950, the Central People's Government issued the \"Order of the Central People's Government on the Promulgation of the National Emblem of the People's Republic of China\", which determined the design, explanation and use of the national emblem of the People's Republic of China. Mao Zedong, in the name of the Chairman of the Central People's Government, promulgated the order (written in traditional Chinese characters at the time):During this period, personnel appointments were handled by the Central People's Government Committee and the State Council. On September 20, 1954, the first session of the 1st National People's Congress was held. The Constitution of the People's Republic of China was adopted at the meeting. Article 40 of the Constitution provided:The position of the Chairman of the People's Republic of China was officially established. Chairman Mao and Liu Shaoqi successively issued the \"Order of the Chairman of the People's Republic of China\". After the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, Liu Shaoqi was targeted as the number one target due to his serious differences with Mao and quickly lost power. At the 12th Plenary Session of in 1968, Liu Shaoqi removed from all positions within and outside the party and expelled from the party. In October of the following year, Liu Shaoqi died of illness due to persecution. After that, the position of the Chairman of the People's Republic of China was vacant. The two Vice Chairpersons of the People's Republic of China at that time, Soong Ching-ling and Dong Biwu, acted as the Chairman, but did not succeed the Chairman as Vice Chairpersons. The position of the Chairman was vacant. The subsequent dispute over the abolition of the chairmanship ended with the direct deletion of Chapter 2, Section 2 of the Constitution, and the Chairman of the People's Republic of China was officially abolished. During the period when the position of the Chairman was vacant and abolished, the \" Order of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress\" and the \"Order of the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress \" replaced the Order of the President of the People's Republic of China.\nOn December 4, 1982, the fifth session of the 5th National People's Congress adopted the fourth Constitution after the founding of the PRC, which restored the provisions on the President of the People's Republic of China in the chapter on state institutions and re-established the positions of President and Vice President.\nAlthough the President became a figurehead and had no power to veto the decisions of the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee, he still had the responsibility to promulgate laws. Starting from the 6th National People's Congress, the Presidential Order was restored.\nList\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Session\n!President\n!Number of orders\n!Start and end time\n|-\n|1st\n|Mao Zedong\n|\n|1954 – 1959\n|-\n|2nd\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Liu Shaoqi\n|\n|1959 – 1965\n|-\n|3rd\n|\n|1965 – 1975, actual: 1965 – 1968\n|-\n|4th, 5th\n| colspan=\"3\" |The presidency vacant and abolished\n|-\n|6th\n|Li Xiannian\n|65\n|June 18, 1983 – March 12, 1988\n|-\n|7th\n|Yang Shangkun\n|72\n|April 9, 1988 – February 22, 1993\n|-\n|8th\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Jiang Zemin\n|94\n|March 28, 1993 – December 29, 1997\n|-\n|9th\n|85\n|March 17, 1998 – February 28, 2003\n|-\n|10th\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Hu Jintao\n|87\n|March 16, 2003 – February 28, 2008\n|-\n|11th\n|75\n|March 16, 2008 – December 28, 2012\n|-\n|12th\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Xi Jinping\n|86\n|March 15, 2013 – December 27, 2017\n|-\n|13th\n|130\n|March 18, 2018 – February 24, 2023\n|-\n|14th\n|Incumbent\n|March 11, 2023 –\n|}\nReferences"
