The two-day program includes forums, a showcase event, networking and an annual awards ceremony.\nThe AWMA was founded in March 2018 by industry veteran Vicki Gordon and come after the research report 'Skipping a Beat' published in 2017 found gender inequality to be rife in the Australian music industry. Artist Katie Noonan said at the launch, \"These awards are a powerful signal to our industry, our artists and our audience that female musicians can, should and will take centre stage\". The inaugural event was staged in Brisbane on 9–10 October 2018. Helen Reddy was the inaugural inductee into the AWMA Honour Roll.\nIn its second year, the AWMAs became a beacon for recognising the achievements and contributions of women across all areas of the Australian music industry. In 2020 and 2021 AWMA was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. It returned on 17–18 May 2022 in Brisbane, Queensland.\nBackground\nThe aim of Australian Women in Music is to advance gender equality in the Australian music industry by recognising the value, achievements and contributions of women across all areas of industry. Women represent only one-fifth of songwriters and composers registered with APRA, despite making up 45 percent of qualified musicians. Of the 100 most played songs on commercial radio in 2016, only 31 were by a female act or act with a female lead. Since the first Australian Independent Records Association Awards in 2006 to 2018, only 22 of the total 103 awards presented have been won by acts with a female lead, or equal numbers of women and men.\nCategories\nCategories as listed below\n* Honour Roll: The AWMA honour roll acknowledges outstanding women in the Australian music industry who have made significant and lasting contributions in their chosen field.
