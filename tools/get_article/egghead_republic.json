Abbatescianni noted that the film shifts \"from genius into sheer madness,\" with humour that is \"broad\" and surreal elements that verge on excess. Because of these qualities, Abbatescianni found the film unforgettable, calling it \"hilarious and gruesome, incisive and idiotic, at once inspired and deranged.\" He suggested that while some viewers may dismiss it as nonsensical, others might regard it as visionary, concluding that \"forgetting [the film] is not an option\".\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n!
