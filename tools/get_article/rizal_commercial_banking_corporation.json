It initially operated with 15 employees at a one-room office along Ayala Avenue. It was later upgraded to a commercial bank upon the approval of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas and, in 1963, began operation as such under its present name Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC). RCBC established its first head office at 219 Buendia Avenue, also in Makati, making it the first commercial bank to do so in the province. In 1989, it acquired its universal banking license.\nIn 2000, RCBC acquired major control of Bankard Inc., a credit card company from divestment of Equitable PCI Bank In 2006, the acquisition of almost all assets of Bankard was approved.\nIn 2007, RCBC acquired the thrift bank Merchants Savings and Loan Association Inc. from Finman Capital Corp. and consolidated it with its own thrift bank RCBC Savings Bank with the aim for increasing its branch network. In 2009, RCBC acquired J.P. Laurel Rural Bank in Batangas to expand microfinance operations to Luzon. On October 28, 2013, RCBC's microfinance subsidiary, Rizal Microbank opened the very first banking office made of recycled shipping container vans in the Philippines. On 2012, RCBC acquired First Malayan Leasing and Finance Corporation and its subsidiary Malayan Rental to enter equipment leasing business.\nIn 2019, RCBC raised ₱ 15 billion in Peso Bond, the Philippines’ first green finance framework under the ASEAN Green Bond Standards.
