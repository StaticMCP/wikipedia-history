In tribal administrative structure, both a Cultural Services (or Cultural Heritage) Department and a Historic Preservation Department operate under the Nation’s executive branch, working together on the Choctaw Nation’s cultural revitalization strategy... The Cultural Services Department (sometimes called Cultural Heritage Department) emphasizes language, arts, and education – its mission “to preserve our Choctaw cultural value by providing a foundation of knowledge utilizing our traditional elders, providing resource materials, participating in cultural activities and… protecting our historic sites and cultural artifacts”. The Historic Preservation Department focuses on the protection of tangible heritage: it “involves physically protecting Choctaw historic sites, repatriating and reburying Choctaw ancestors and sacred objects… conducting research on Choctaw history and traditional life and providing a variety of opportunities related to Choctaw history and culture”. Together, these departments support Choctaw sovereignty and continuity by ensuring that traditional knowledge, language, arts, and sacred places are sustained for future generations.\nChoctaw elders perform traditional songs at a cultural ceremony in front of the Choctaw Capitol Museum in Durant, Oklahoma.

[https://www.choctawnation.com/about/culture/services/#:~:text=It%20is%20our%20mission%20to,our%20Choctaw%20traditions%20and%20culture Cultural Services]. .\nLegal Framework and Governance\nAs a federally recognized sovereign nation, the Choctaw Nation exercises distinct legal authority over its cultural resources. The Nation’s Historic Preservation Department functions as a federally designated Tribal Historic Preservation Office (THPO) under Section 101(d)(2) of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). In 2002 the Choctaw Nation signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Park Service (NPS) that formally authorized the Choctaw Nation “to take on the duties of the State Historic Preservation Officer on Choctaw Tribal Trust lands” . This step made the Choctaw Nation’s Historic Preservation Department the official THPO for the tribe. Under NHPA Sec. 101(d)(2), a tribe may assume some or all state SHPO functions by submitting a preservation plan to NPS and entering into a preservation agreement. The NPS Tribal Historic Preservation Program reviews such applications and executes agreements with tribes .Thus, the Choctaw Nation’s THPO is approved by NPS and carries out preservation duties on tribal lands and affiliated areas, just as a state historic preservation officer (SHPO) would under state law .\nBecause of tribal sovereignty and history, the Choctaw Nation’s preservation jurisdiction is notably expansive. In contrast to a state SHPO (whose authority is bounded by state lines), the Choctaw Nation has defined an “area of historic interest” that extends beyond its current jurisdiction. The Historic Preservation Department explains that, due to the forced Removal of the Nation in the 1830s, many ancestral sites lie outside present-day Oklahoma. It therefore considers all Choctaw-created sites “of equal value and importance, whether they are located within the external boundaries of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, within the original Choctaw homeland, or in faraway places,” and feels an equal responsibility to protect sites across that area .In practice, this means the Choctaw THPO consults on federal undertakings (Section 106 reviews) affecting Choctaw-related cultural sites even beyond Oklahoma, and in multiple states (including Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, etc.) .  This sovereignty-based scope is a key difference from state agencies: CHen state historic preservation officers must cede review on tribal lands to THPOs, whereas Choctaw’s THPO actively oversees projects throughout the tribe’s expanded area of interest.\nAt the tribal level, the Historic Preservation Department operates under the authority of the tribal government and reports to the Chief and Tribal Council. Its legal basis also stems from the Nation’s own governing documents and its treaty relationship with the U.S. (the Choctaw Nation is recognized by a series of treaties dating back to 1786 .  The department’s mission statement reflects that heritage: it seeks to “assist the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma community in preserving its living heritage, through protecting sacred sites and historic sites and through aiding community efforts to maintain and revitalize Choctaw traditional culture”.he NPS-approved Tribal Historic Preservation Plan (as required under NHPA) obligates the department to integrate traditional values (oral history, consultations with elders and spiritual leaders) into preservation work, including the identification of “Traditional Cultural Properties” (sites of cultural significance).\nHistoric Preservation Programs and Responsibilities\nThe Choctaw Nation’s Historic Preservation Department carries out a broad cultural resource management program. A primary responsibility is archaeology and site protection: the department’s Tribal Archaeology Program “conducts archaeological surveys and limited excavations to ensure that Choctaw Nation construction projects do not damage the archaeological sites left by our ancestors,” covering sites from 10,000-year-old camps to 20th-century homesteads. Archaeologists inventory sites, maintain records (in GIS databases of Choctaw historic place names and locations ., and respond to reports of vandalism or grave disturbances.\nAnother key program is Cemetery Restoration. The department staffs a Census of Choctaw Burials and provides services to locate, preserve, and protect abandoned or endangered Choctaw cemeteries within the Nation’s service area. In practice this means identifying family grave sites, clearing brush and debris, erecting markers, and negotiating with landowners to ensure respect for tribal burial grounds. These efforts complement compliance with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). The Choctaw Nation’s NAGPRA Liaison, working with the Historic Preservation Department, has led a “No Stone Unturned” initiative (established 2018) to inventory Choctaw cultural items and human remains in museum and government collections nationwide. This program “set out to locate and repatriate any Choctaw objects or human remains” held in institutions, building hundreds of cooperative relationships and returning ancestors and sacred objects to the Nation\nThe Historic Preservation Department also identifies and documents Traditional Cultural Properties (TCPs) – landscapes or sites with ongoing cultural significance to the Choctaw people. Examples include sacred springs, ceremonial grounds, earth mounds, traditional use areas, and village sites. NPS and tribal guidelines define TCPs as places “rooted in the history of the community” and important to its contemporary religious or cultural practices. The Choctaw department incorporates traditional knowledge (elders’ accounts, oral histories) into the evaluation of such sites for eligibility to the National Register of Historic Places and tribal registers  .In practice the department’s staff work to nominate eligible properties to the national or tribal registers, and to influence planning so that development projects account for these sites  .\nIn addition, the department manages cultural landscapes and traditional lifeways programs. For example, the “Growing Hope” program revives traditional Choctaw agriculture by collecting heirloom seed crops and building community gardens; it allows Choctaw citizens to grow and eat traditional foods once cultivated by their ancestors . The Historic Preservation Department also conducts educational and interpretive work (lectures, museum exhibits, publications) to share Choctaw history with both tribal members and the public. Outreach is an explicit part of its charge: the department offers customized presentations on Choctaw history and lifeways, and partners with the Choctaw Nation Capitol Museum and cultural center to develop exhibits and programs\n.Through these programs, the Historic Preservation Department fulfills many tasks that SHPOs perform (survey, inventory, review, public education) under the tribe’s sovereign authority.\nCultural Heritage Education and Programs\nThe Cultural Services (Heritage) Department focuses on language, arts, and intergenerational knowledge transfer. Its mission is to educate tribal members and the public about Choctaw culture. A cornerstone of this effort is the Choctaw language program. The tribe’s School of Choctaw Language (Chahta Anumpa Aiikhvna) offers free classes, both in-person and online, for adults and youth. For example, the department publishes self-paced digital courses and conducts live 10-week language courses via videoconference . In recent years it has also recorded fluent elders telling stories in Choctaw (using grant funding), creating an audio archive so that “when all the speakers are gone, you should be able to…listen to authentic language spoken with different verbs and inflections” . These recorded narratives preserve dialects and provide material for developing curricula. Choctaw language instruction is seen as vital to sovereignty: tribal leaders often note that “speaking the Choctaw language preserves, promotes and protects Choctaw culture and sovereignty” (the official language page’s tagline)\nBeyond language, the department actively promotes traditional arts and crafts. It offers workshops and classes in historically accurate techniques such as pottery, flintknapping, basketry, traditional moccasin-making, beadwork, and food preparation  . For example, adults and youth can participate in “Make & Take” sessions on beading, basketry, and corn-husk doll-making. or learn stickball rituals and social dances through live demonstrations. These programs use Choctaw materials and methods to “revitalize the knowledge of our ancestors,” as the Historic Preservation site explains Choctaw Nation. The Choctaw Nation also produces educational videos and publishes a Choctaw-language newspaper (Chahta Tosholi) and newsletter (Iti Fabvssa) to share cultural stories and lessons.\nCrucially, the Cultural Services Department fosters intergenerational transfer of knowledge. It regularly involves elders, Tribal Council members, and experts in teaching roles. For instance, community centers across the Nation host intergenerational events where Youth Advisory Board members interview elders and document their memories.. The tribe selects “Outstanding Elders” from each district and collects written biographies to honor living elders. Tribal programs like the annual Labor Day Choctaw Festival and Veterans Memorial ceremonies prominently feature elders in ceremonial roles. In this way, elders literally and figuratively pass on cultural traditions – from songs to stories – to younger generations. The department’s official statement underscores this approach: it pledges to use “our traditional elders” and resource materials as a foundation of knowledge to sustain Choctaw traditions\nAnother notable initiative is the Princess and Royalty Program, which educates Choctaw youth about their heritage through cultural pageantry. Each year, young Choctaw women participate in a program that trains them in public speaking, ceremony, and tribal history. This leadership-development program creates “lifelong memories and friends,” while ensuring that each new generation learns the cultural values expected of tribal royalty .  Similarly, school visits and summer camps led by cultural instructors allow children to practice traditional games, storytelling, and crafts under elder guidance.\nOverall, the Cultural Heritage Department’s educational programs range from formal classes to informal community outreach. For example, the department publishes free “How to” guides (digital pamphlets) on crafts and has a mobile “Culture on Wheels” exhibit for schools. Combined with the Historic Preservation Department’s archives, the tribe’s media (like the Biskinik newspaper) ensures that both written and oral Choctaw histories are preserved. The Biskinik archives, for instance, house decades of tribal stories, obituaries, and interviews “of countless Choctaws,” with back issues available online and older editions preserved at the Choctaw Cultural Center .The Choctaw Capitol Museum also collects elder stories via video interviews (the Historic Projects Department archives these recordings)Together, these efforts underscore a comprehensive strategy: teaching the Choctaw language and arts, engaging youth, and archiving elders’ knowledge so that cultural heritage remains a living, community-wide project.\nCommunity Engagement, Outreach, and Partnerships\nBoth departments emphasize outreach to tribal and non-tribal communities. The Cultural Services Department’s Cultural Outreach program conducts demonstrations and presentations to schools, businesses, and events across Oklahoma. It advertises hands-on “make and take” classes (beading, basketry, pottery, doll-making) and live cultural demonstrations (stickball, social dances, traditional weaponry) to local groupsy bringing traditional crafts into classrooms and community centers, the department raises awareness of Choctaw lifeways and provides practical skill-building. This public education role complements the Historic Preservation Department’s work: for example, HP staff may give lectures on archaeology or consultations for development projects, while Cultural Services focuses on folk arts and history.\nThe Choctaw Nation also actively pursues collaboration with external institutions and other tribes. One notable partnership is with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In 2016, a pilot program with the Mobile District Corps involved Choctaw THPO and cultural specialists joining Corps archaeologists on ancestral lands along the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway. Together they collected traditional materials (palmetto fronds, river cane, clay) to support cultural classes . or example, one outcome was a joint basketry workshop: “we have been out gathering river cane that is going to be used for a joint class between our tribe and [the] Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians to do traditional basketry,” noted THPO Ian Thompson.These activities not only supply traditional materials (like cane and clay) for Choctaw crafts but also strengthen government-to-government ties.\nFederal partnerships also extend to museums and academia. In 2024 the Choctaw Nation collaborated with the Musée du quai Branly–Jacques Chirac in France to curate an exhibit of Choctaw artifacts dating to the 1700s.Choctaw historic preservation staff “assisted in its preparation,” helping to interpret the Choctaw–French historical alliance. At the exhibit’s U.S. venue (the Choctaw Cultural Center), the tribe showcased items collected on loan from the University of South Alabama and other institutions to highlight shared Choctaw history. Such projects bring international attention to Choctaw heritage and build scholarly partnerships. .Choctaw historic preservation staff “assisted in its preparation,” helping to interpret the Choctaw–French historical alliance.\nChoctaw Nation offices also reach out to state governments and neighboring tribes. The nation’s THPO chairs the Oklahoma Tribal Historic Preservation Working Group and coordinates regionally. For example, the Corps of Engineers project aimed to involve tribes with ancestral ties to their lands – the Choctaw Nation engaged both Mississippi and Alabama Choctaw communities in these ethnobotanical activities. Similarly, language and cultural conferences often bring together the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma with the Jena Band of Choctaw (Louisiana) and the Mississippi Band of Choctaw for joint programs. The Nation is a member of intertribal organizations (e.g., NATHPO, ATALM) and contributes to federal advisory committees on cultural issues (its THPO and NAGPRA liaison serve on national review boards). These networks ensure that Choctaw cultural policy is informed by and contributes to broader tribal initiatives nationwide.The Choctaw Capitol Museum and the Choctaw Cultural Center (near Calera, OK) serve as additional outreach hubs, though run by affiliated entities. The Capitol Museum (a historic 1884 building) offers interpretive exhibits on Choctaw governance, labor history, and traditional practices . ultural Services and Historic Preservation staff collaborate with these venues for annual events (Choctaw Labor Day Festival, museum tours) and educational programs. In sum, the two departments’ outreach ranges from local beadwork classes to international museum exhibits, all aimed at both preserving and sharing Choctaw heritage.\nSovereignty, Comparison with SHPOs, and Federal Agencies\nChoctaw Nation’s cultural programs operate on the foundation of tribal sovereignty, which differs from state or federal authorities. Unlike State Historic Preservation Offices (SHPOs), which are state government agencies, the Choctaw THPO answers to tribal law and priorities. For example, the tribe’s “area of historic interest” explicitly ignores state boundaries to include ancestral Choctaw homelands, whereas SHPO jurisdiction is limited to its own state. Similarly, a state may not consult the Choctaw THPO on tribal lands, and the Choctaw Nation need not follow state preservation laws off tribal trust lands. Within Oklahoma, the Choctaw THPO has assumed federal Section 106 review duties for Choctaw lands (through its 2002 NPS agreement), whereas the Oklahoma SHPO retains authority over state or private lands. This sovereignty-based arrangement means the Choctaw Historic Preservation Department jointly conducts preservation planning with, and reports to, the National Park Service rather than a state historic agency.\nAt the federal level, the National Park Service plays a supporting role: it administers the THPO program, provides grant funding, and reviews tribal plans. The Choctaw Nation, through its THPO, may apply for NPS Historic Preservation Fund grants (under the state, tribal, local grants program) to carry out surveys, cemeteries inventories, and other tasks. Unlike a federal land management agency (e.g. NPS, Forest Service, Corps), the tribe’s departments are not regulators of public lands; rather they advise and consult on how federal and state projects affect Choctaw heritage. In practice, federal agencies must engage the Choctaw THPO under Section 106 when projects occur in the Nation’s area of interest. In turn, the tribe’s cultural offices respect federal laws like NHPA and NAGPRA while integrating Choctaw values and legal principles.\nIn summary, the Choctaw Nation’s Cultural Heritage (Services) and Historic Preservation departments function as sovereign entities with authorities similar to state agencies but grounded in tribal law and history. They exemplify a modern tribal approach to cultural revitalization: blending education (language and arts programs), community-led stewardship (archaeology and cemeteries), and broad collaboration (with elders, youth, agencies, and museums) in service of preserving Choctaw heritage for future generations.\nReferences"
