Relations between the two countries date back to 1848, when Faisal bin Turki, ruler of the Second Saudi state, formally requested the support of the British Political Resident in Bushire for his representative in Trucial Oman.\nSaudi Arabia and the United Kingdom are strategic allies. There are more than 200 joint ventures between British and Saudi Companies, worth $17.5&nbsp;billion, and some 30,000 British nationals are living and working in Saudi Arabia as well as nearly 100,000 Saudi nationals living in the UK. Saudi Arabia is the United Kingdom's primary trading partner in the Middle East and the United Kingdom is Saudi Arabia's closest European ally.\nHistory\nAccording to some sources from the Arab world, the founder of Saudi Arabia's radical state ideology, Wahhabism, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, was a British agent. As early as 1865, the British signed a treaty with the Wahhabi House of Saud in order to gain influence in the heart of the Arabian Peninsula after the conquest of Bahrain. The following year, a friendship agreement was signed with the Saudis, establishing the British role as protector of the Wahhabis. After the second Saudi state was crushed, members of the Saud dynasty found refuge in British-controlled Kuwait. With British help, Ibn Saud conquered Riyadh in 1902 and established a third Saudi-Wahhabi state.\nDuring First World War, Ibn Saud signed the 1915 Treaty of Darin with the British government, thereby accepting the British protection. On 20 May 1927, the British government and the Kingdom of Nejd concluded the Treaty of Jeddah, a further agreement. The United Kingdom was among the first states that recognised the country in 1926 and had a diplomatic delegation in the country. Saudi Arabia opened its embassy in London in 1930, which was the country's second official foreign affairs body abroad and led by Hafiz Wahba.\nAl-Yamamah arms deal controversy\nIn 1985, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud, son of the Saudi defence minister, negotiated the Al-Yamamah arms deal for British-based arms company British Aerospace (now privatised and known as BAE Systems). Since then, the deal has brought in £43&nbsp;billion in revenue for BAE Systems.\nAccording to police estimates, more than £6&nbsp;billion may have been paid to Saudi officials in order for BAE Systems to gain this contract. According to 'US sources', cited by the Guardian newspaper, millions of pounds went to Prince Bandar himself, distributed in chunks of up to $30&nbsp;million (£15&nbsp;million) at a time. Asked about allegations of royal corruption in 2001, Prince Bandar said: \"If you tell me that building this whole country [...] out of $400bn, that we misused, or got, $50bn, I'll tell you, 'Yes. So what?'\"\nAccording to the Guardian, around £60&nbsp;million was allegedly spent by BAE Systems on extravagant holidays, fleets of classic cars, shopping trips and escorts for Prince Turki bin Nasser Al Saud, who controlled the Royal Saudi Air Force. The newspaper also alleged that Bandar's father and Turki bin Nasser's father-in-law Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al Saud was described by a British ambassador as having \"a corrupt interest in all contracts\" while the Guardian's legal sources alleged that BAE disguised many of the payments by making them through an anonymous offshore company called Poseidon.\nWith reference to this scandal, former British defence secretary Ian Gilmour, Baron Gilmour of Craigmillar told the BBC: \"If you are paying bribes to high-up people in the government, the fact that it's illegal in Saudi law doesn't mean much.\"\nat RAF Waddington]]\nSenior British figures were aware of the allegations. Within days of the deal being announced, Margaret Thatcher's chief adviser Charles Powell, Baron Powell of Bayswater, who went on to work for BAE Systems, received an Arab-language magazine which detailed accusations of Bandar and others taking huge commissions. The British government advised the Ministry of Defence not to comment on the allegations.\nDecades later, after these allegations were repeated in the Guardian newspaper in 2004, BAE Systems admitted it was being investigated by Britain's Serious Fraud Office. Several senior BAE Systems employees were interviewed or arrested.\nIn 2005, the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia agreed a military agreement, where BAE Systems would equip Saudi Arabia with Eurofighter Typhoons. In 2006, the Saudis threatened to end co-operation with the UK unless the Serious Fraud Office dropped its investigation into BAE Systems over the Al-Yamamah arms deal. On 8 December 2006, Tony Blair (who was the British Prime Minister at the time), wrote a secret personal letter to the Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, in which he urged Goldsmith to stop the Serious Fraud Office investigation. In the letter, Blair stated he was worried about the \"critical difficulty\" the investigation could cause for the negotiations of the new Eurofighter Typhoon sales contracts. Shortly after, the investigation was shelved on 'national security' grounds. This decision was later found to have not been legal by the High Court. Two senior judges condemned what they called the government's \"abject\" surrender to a \"blatant\" threat by the Saudis.\nWhile BAE Systems never admitted to corruption or bribery, they did pay fines of £286&nbsp;million in order to settle British and American probes into corruption at the company. No further action was taken against the company and nobody working for the British or Saudi governments or BAE Systems ever served prison time as a result of the allegations.\nBritish reaction to Saudi-led Intervention in Yemen\ns are playing a central role in Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen.]]\nIn March 2015, after Houthi rebels took control of Yemen and ousted former president  Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, a coalition of Gulf states led by Saudi Arabia began to bomb and impose a naval blockade on Yemen. The coalition was led by the Saudi Arabian Air, Ground and Naval forces, who confirmed the use of 100 fighter jets, 150.000 ground forces and some naval units. Saudi Arabia was assisted by the armies of the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Sudan and Egypt who have each committed between 3 and 30 fighter jets, as well as Jordan and Morocco, who confirmed their support, but the details of which remain unspecified. Between the start of the attack and December 2016, Britain licensed £3.3&nbsp;billion worth of arms to Saudi Arabia despite protests from the public, politicians, media outlets and campaign groups. This included £2.2&nbsp;billion worth of ML10 licenses (aircraft, helicopters and drones), £1.1&nbsp;billion worth of ML4 licenses (grenades, bombs, missiles, countermeasures) and £430,000 of ML6 licenses (armoured vehicles and tanks).\nThe UK’s biggest arms company BAE Systems sold over £17 billion worth of equipment and services to the Saudi Arabian military since 2015.\nIn June 2016, Campaign Against Arms Trade gained permission from the British High Court to bring a judicial review against the government over British arms sales to Saudi Arabia. In response to this decision, Campaign Against Arms Trade spokesman Andrew Smith said: \"This is a historic decision and we welcome the fact that arms exports to Saudi Arabia will be given the full scrutiny of a legal review, but they should never have been allowed in the first place. The fact that UK aircraft and bombs are being used against Yemen is a terrible sign of how broken the arms export control system is. For too long, government has focused on maximising and promoting arms sales, rather than on the human rights of those they are used against\". After hearing closed evidence kept concealed \"on grounds of national security\", Lord Justice Burnett and Mr Justice Haddon-Cave found that the secretary of state's decision to sustain the UK's arms trade with Saudi Arabia was \"not unlawful\". CAAT vowed to appeal the decision.\nIn November 2016, two parliamentary committees (Committee on Arms Export Controls and International Development and Business Committee) released a joint report calling for the British government to stop licensing arms exports to Saudi Arabia until a UN investigation had been conducted into alleged breaches of international humanitarian law. However, British government ministers Liam Fox, Boris Johnson, Michael Fallon and Priti Patel released a statement saying they disagreed with the parliamentary committee's recommendations.\nmeets Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir]]\nIn December 2016, British  government research revealed that British-made cluster bombs had been used by the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. This was confirmed by the Saudi Arabian government in the same month. Cluster munitions (another term for cluster bombs) can lie unexploded for long periods of time and cause severe injury to civilians even years after the initial attack. It is illegal to use, produce, transfer or stockpile cluster bombs, since the coming into force of the UN Convention on Cluster Munition on 1 August 2010. This treaty is international law and although Saudi Arabia has neither signed nor ratified it, the UK ratified this treaty in 2010, meaning it is not only illegal for the UK to produce and transfer cluster bombs according to British as well as international law, but the country also has a duty to promote the aims and ratification of the treaty to non-signatory states.\nIn January 2017, Parliament debated a motion calling for an independent investigation into violations of International Humanitarian Law in Yemen. Incidents to be investigated include the bombing of a funeral which killed 140 people; the bombing of a refugee camp and eight bombings of densely populated areas in Sa'dah, Sana'a, Hodeidah, Hajjah and Ibb, which Amnesty International have raised concerns about.\nIn a 20 June 2019 judgment, the Court of Appeal ruled favouring the anti-arms trade campaigners in their legal campaign against the government over their arms sales to the Saudi government. The Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) asserted that the arms sales made by the British government are being used by the Saudi-led coalition in their violations of international law. International trade secretary, Liam Fox, said that the government would challenge the judgment, but had adjourned any licences for the Saudi government and its partners in the coalition.\nAt the June 2019 G20 Summit held in Osaka, Japan, UK Prime Minister Theresa May urged the Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to collaborate with the United Nations to find a solution to the 4-year long conflict in Yemen.\nhighlighting the UK's complicity in Saudi Arabia's bombing campaign against Yemen]]\nLabour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, claimed that the Prime Minister was not successful in signalling the UK government's disapproval of Saudi's role in Yemen war. He added, \"She should confirm the UK government will immediately stop selling arms to his regime.\"\nAndrew Smith, of Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), said that Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson \"have played an utterly central and complicit role in arming and supporting the Saudi-led destruction of Yemen.\" Jeremy Hunt's Conservative leadership campaign was partly funded by Ken Costa, investment banker with close ties to Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince.\nRecent exchanges\nIn May 2021, the foreign ministries of Saudi Arabia and the UK met in London and discussed global issues and bilateral relations, as well as the issue of Palestine.\nIn October 2023, amid the Gaza war, British PM Rishi Sunak met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia. During the meeting, the Prime Minister encouraged bin Salman to leverage Saudi Arabia's leadership in the region to promote stability.\nDiplomatic relations\nThe UK has an embassy in Riyadh, consulate in Jeddah and trade office in Al Khobar.  The current British ambassador to Saudi Arabia is Neil Crompton. Saudi Arabia has an embassy and consulate in London. Mohammed bin Nawwaf bin Abdulaziz was the Saudi ambassador to the UK between 2005 and 2019. He was replaced by Khalid bin Bandar Al Saud both of whom are the members of the House of Saud.\nDeath of King Abdullah\nIn January 2015, Prince Charles travelled to the Saudi capital Riyadh, as did a number of world leaders including Prime Minister David Cameron, to pay his respects following the death of the nation's King Abdullah. The decision following the King's death to fly flags at half-mast on key public buildings in London drew sharp criticism from some prominent politicians who highlighted claims of Saudi Arabia's abuses of free speech, women's rights and the country's role as a cradle of Islamist extremism.\nEconomic relations\nEconomic relations between the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia are primarily characterized by oil trade, arms exports, and mutual investments. Saudi Arabia is one of the most important buyers of British arms; the UK has been supplying the kingdom with large quantities of weapons and military technology since the 1960s. Overall, bilateral trade has increased significantly in recent years, with trade in goods (goods and services) amounting to around £18.5 billion in 2022/23. The UK mainly exports machinery, vehicles, pharmaceuticals, high-quality consumer goods, and services to Saudi Arabia, while petroleum, petrochemical products, metals, and plastics are among the most important Saudi Arabian exports to the UK. In 2022, Saudi Arabia was the UK's 21st largest trading partner, accounting for around 1.1% of total UK foreign trade.\nThe two countries also have close investment ties: Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) has invested heavily in British companies and projects in recent years, including the acquisition of Premier League club Newcastle United in 2021. British companies are active in the Saudi energy sector, finance, and other industries. British authorities also welcome the economic reforms initiated by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as part of \"Vision 2030\" and have sought to participate in the opportunities arising from these reforms. For example, London hoped to win the listing of a stake in the Saudi oil company Saudi Aramco on the London Stock Exchange  (which ultimately did not happen).\nMilitary relations\nThe UK's Ministry of Defence Saudi Armed Forces Project (MODSAP) supplies weapons and services to the Saudi Armed Forces under the Saudi British Defence Cooperation Programme (SBDCP) and the SALAM Project. MODSAP's principal roles are to monitor the progress and performance of the SBDCP and the Salam prime contractor, UK-headquartered arms company BAE Systems, so that the requirements of Saudi Arabia's armed forces are faithfully met.\nThe UK's Ministry of Defence also runs the Saudi Arabia National Guard Communications Project, which aims to improve the communication capabilities of Saudi Arabia's National Guard. The UK also runs a British Military Mission to the Saudi Arabian National Guard.\nIn 2021, the UK stated that it would not stop selling weapons to Saudi Arabia. In March 2022, Boris Johnson visited Saudi Arabia as \"part of efforts to secure more oil supplies\".\nSaudi Arabia is pushing to join the Global Combat Air Programme a multinational initiative led by the United Kingdom, Japan, and Italy to develop a sixth-generation stealth fighter, with tentative British and Italian support. However, due to concerns surrounding defence export rules and extended negotiations, Japan currently opposes Saudi entry. The UK Ministry of Defence intends to review means of cooperation with Saudi Arabia, and understand the Saudi government's military and industrial objectives. This is predicted to be completed by March 2024.\nAl Salam arms deal\nAfter two years of lobbying from the government and BAE Systems, in February 2014, British arms company BAE Systems agreed a deal to supply the Saudis with 72 Typhoon fighter jets, worth £4.4 billion (just over US$7 billion). This followed sustained pressure from the British government which involved, among numerous other things, British Crown Prince Charles performing a sword dance dressed in traditional Saudi ceremonial dress.\nControversy\nBritish parliamentary committee report on relations\n's state visit to the United Kingdom in March 2018]]\nIn 2013, a UK parliamentary committee report was published, examining the UK's relationship with Saudi Arabia. The Saudi ambassador to the UK warned of negative consequences for bilateral relations when the parliamentary enquiry was announced in 2012.\nMPs on the foreign affairs committee also asked the government to \"assess\" the supply of weapons by Saudi Arabia to Syrian rebels seeking to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad. However, the report found no \"conclusive proof\" that it has been used for internal repression, and said there would be \"significant costs for the UK-Saudi relationship\" by ending sales. MPs described Saudi Arabia as \"part of the problem as well as part of the solution\" in counter-terrorism co-operation. The government was urged to try to \"improve the monitoring of the funding flowing from Saudi Arabia to organisations with an extremist message\", and to ensure that its \"legitimate promotion of religious values does not inadvertently contribute to the furtherance of extremism.\" It was also asked to give an \"assessment of the situation and the actions it is taking to monitor Syrian rebel groups that are receiving funding and arms from Saudi Arabia, and its efforts to engage with the Saudi authorities regarding any concerns about them.\"\nThe foreign affairs committee report noted: \"Democratic governments such as the UK face a challenge in trying to reconcile their liberal constituencies at home with the need to maintain relationships with undemocratic and conservative regimes that are important to their interests on a regional and global level.\" Another section asserted:\nRichard Ottaway, the foreign affairs committee chairman, said:\nA spokesperson for The Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT) stated that \"Unfortunately it looks as though arms company and establishment interests reached into the heart of this inquiry. The foreign affairs committee is giving cover to the UK government as it continues the policy of pandering to despicable regimes in its desire to drum up sales for [defence firm] BAE Systems.\" Ann Feltham from CAAT added that:\nSaudi crucifixion sentence for pro-democracy protester fallout\nOn 14 February 2012, a Saudi 70-year old called Ali Mohammed Baqir al-Nimr was arrested after taking part in anti-government rallies in Saudi Arabia. In 2014, he was sentenced to death and pro-Saudi government media reported that Nimr would be crucified.\nIn September 2015, Jeremy Corbyn, Britain's opposition leader, used his speech to Labour Party conference to call on Britain's Ministry of Justice to drop its bid for a £5.9&nbsp;million Saudi prisons contract, partly because of Al-Nimr's imminent execution. The bid had been put in by Justice Solutions International, the commercial arms of the Ministry of Justice.\nThere was also controversy, among the British press and public, when the Saudis sentenced British pensioner Karl Andree to 350 lashes after he was arrested for transporting home-made wine in his car.\nSaudi Arabia's ambassador to Britain, Prince Mohammed bin Nawaf bin Abdulaziz, wrote a response to Jeremy Corbyn's speech in Britain's Telegraph newspaper. In it, he accused Corbyn of disrespect and referred to the arrests and crucifixion sentences of pro-democracy activists and threats of lashing against a pensioner transporting wine in his car as \"a number of domestic events in the Kingdom\". \"We will not be lectured to by anyone,\" he said.\nDespite pressure from the Saudi governments and top figures in the British government like David Cameron and Philip Hammond, the justice secretary Michael Gove cancelled the contract in October 2015. However, the government did continue resisted pressure from human rights groups to stop licensing weapons exports to Saudi Arabia. Between October 2015 and September 2016, the British government licensed at least £544&nbsp;million worth of military exports to Saudi Arabia including components for bombs, machine guns and sniper rifles.\nAccording to the Telegraph, the UK's Foreign Office feared that Mohammed bin Nawaf was poised to react to the prisons contract cancellation by taking a temporary \"leave of absence\" while a wide-ranging review of relations with the UK was conducted. In order to repair the damage from these events, and to ensure the Saudis keep buying weapons from British-headquartered companies like BAE Systems, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond travelled to Saudi Arabia on 27 October 2015. While there, he met with Saudi King Salman; interior minister and crown prince Mohammed Bin Naif; defence minister and deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman and the leader of Saudi Arabia's National Guard Prince Mutaib. Travelling with Hammond were Hugh Blackman, the commander of the British Military Mission to Saudi Arabia; Peter Drew, the programme director of the joint British and Saudi military programme 'Saudi-Arabia National Guard Communication project' and two British military attaches.\nIn the same month, the Prime Minister's chief of staff Edward Llewellyn, Baron Llewellyn of Steep visited Saudi King Salman in Riyadh in what the Telegraph called \"a secret diplomatic offensive with Saudi Arabia after row\".\nHuman rights abuses\nin London, 13 January 2017]]\nIn February 2015, Prince Charles visited Saudi Arabia, at the request of the British Government because of his close ties to the Saudi royal family, and he was accompanied by senior Foreign Office officials. According to a Telegraph source, Charles raised the case of Raif Badawi, a pro-democracy blogger who had been flogged in public a month before. The Telegraph source said the Prince received a \"friendly response\" from Saudi royals. Badawi remained in prison and his supporters fear he could be publicly flogged again at any time.\nIn October 2018, Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post, went missing from the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The Turkish authorities accused the Saudi government of murdering and dismembering the 59-year old journalist. Khashoggi was a critic of crown prince Mohammad bin Salman and was living in exile in the United States from the past one year. Saudi denied the allegations. Amidst the controversy, Jeremy Hunt asked Saudi Arabia to urgently explain the disappearance of Khashoggi. In a phone call to Adel al-Jubeir, Hunt warned that \"friendships depend on shared values\".\nAfter Saudi Arabia accepted to have killed Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Turkey, Theresa May vowed to not let any suspect involved in the murder enter the UK in future. She said if any suspect had a British visa, it would be revoked.\nOn 12 November 2018, the UK Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt flew to Saudi Arabia to request Mohammad bin Salman's cooperation with the Turkish authorities into the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Hunt said, \"It is clearly unacceptable that the full circumstances behind his murder still remain unclear. We encourage the Saudi authorities to cooperate fully with the Turkish investigation into his death, so that we deliver justice for his family and the watching world. The international community remains united in horror and outrage at the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi one month ago.\"\nThe Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, during her 20-minute meeting with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, at the 2019 G20 Summit addressed the need for maintaining transparency in the Jamal Khashoggi murder legal process.\nIn 2010, a Saudi Prince was jailed after he abused his workers. He thought that he could get away with it. He was later sent back to Saudi Arabia.\nIn 2012, a Saudi Princess, Sara Bin Talal Al Saud, applied for asylum in the UK. She claims that she faced a lot of abuse in Saudi Arabia.\nResident diplomatic missions\n* Saudi Arabia has an embassy in London.\n* The United Kingdom has an embassy in Riyadh and a consulate-general in Jeddah.\nSee also\n* Foreign relations of Saudi Arabia\n* Foreign relations of the United Kingdom\n* List of Ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Saudi Arabia\n* Operation Granby\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.worldlii.org/int/other/LNTSer/1928/43.html British Empire and Hejaz - Treaty of Friendship and Good Understanding]"
