In the , Rungoo had a population of 11 people.\nGeography\nThe Hinchinbrook Channel and its inlets form the eastern boundary of the locality, while the northern boundary loosely follows Porter Creek.\nThe Bruce Highway enters the locality from the south (Bemerside) and exits to the north (Damper Creek).\nThe North Coast railway line also enters the locality from the south (Bemerside) and exits to the north (Damper Creek). It is to the east of the highway as it enters and exits the locality but runs immediately parallel and west of the highway through most of the locality. The locality was historically served by the now-abandoned Rungoo railway station ().\nThe terrain varies. To the east of the railway line and highway is low-lying land from  above sea level, but, to the west, the terrain is mountainous rising to  with a number of named peaks:\n* Bishop Peak ()\n* Mount Leach ()\nThere are a number of flat low-lying marine islands along the coast which are within the locality boundaries, but only one is named, Benjamin Flats ( at ).\nMost of the locality is within one of two protected areas. In the north is the Cardwell State Forest. The remainder of the locality is mostly within the Girringun National Park, part of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area.\nThe land not within a protected area includes two of the larger marine islands (one of them being Benjamin Flats), both of which are marshland, and two pockets of land in the south of the locality immediately west of the railway line, used for rural residential housing, some crop growing, and grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nRungoo was named after the former Rungoo railway station, which was in turn named on 26 June 1925 by the Queensland Railways Department. It is believed to be an Aboriginal word meaning camping place.\nDemographics\nIn the , Rungoo had a population of 12 people.\nIn the , Rungoo had a population of 11 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Rungoo. The nearest government primary school is Macknade State School in neighbouring Macknade to the south-east. The nearest government secondary school is Ingham State High School in Ingham to the south. There are also Catholic and independent schools in Ingham.\nAmenities\nThe Fisher Creek boat ramp is east of the Bruce Highway and, despite its name, provides access into nearby Plunkett Creek (). It is managed by the Cassowary Coast Regional Council.\nReferences"
