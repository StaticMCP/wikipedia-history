The fight was promoted by Matchroom Sport (promoted Froch) and Goossen Tutor Promotions (promoted Ward)\nWard\nWard advanced to the final by winning his tournament bouts. He won his title against Kessler in his opening bout, scoring a dominant 11th-round technical decision. Ward beat Allan Green in his second bout. Ward's Group Stage 3 bout called off when Dirrell, his 2004 U.S. Olympic teammate, dropped out of the tournament. Ward instead faced contender Sakio Bika outside of the tournament and won a decision. In his May semifinal fight, Ward defeated Abraham to advance to the final.{\nFroch\nFroch defeated Dirrell on a split decision in England in his opening-round bout. Then Froch lost a decision (and his title) to Denmark's Kessler in Denmark in Group Stage 2.\nHowever, after Kessler dropped out, Froch met Abraham for the vacant belt in Group Stage 3 and won a decision to claim his title. Froch advanced to the final in June by scoring a majority decision against Johnson.\nThe fight\nAlthough the fight was competitive throughout, Ward was able to use his superior speed and movement to help him outbox Froch for the first half of the encounter, neutralizing his attack and beating him to the punch at both distance and close range. Ward seemed to ease off in the later rounds and Froch began to edge them, looking the stronger by the end of the bout.
