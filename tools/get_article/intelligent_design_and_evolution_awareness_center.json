Johnson lectured at UCSD.  By 2008 it appeared to be moribund.\nSee also\n* A Scientific Support for Darwinism\n* Creation–evolution controversy\n* National Center for Science Education\n* Project Steve\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ideacenter.org/ IDEA Center site]\n* [http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-evolution-timeline-interactive Human Timeline (Interactive)] – Smithsonian, National Museum of Natural History (August 2016)."
