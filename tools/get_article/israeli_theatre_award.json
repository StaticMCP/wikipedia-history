In 2018, directors of the major theatres announced the dissolution of the association and the cessation of the award, citing controversies around it and budgetary difficulties. The directors promised to formulate the new definition of the prize.\nThere were categories of awards for achievements of individuals in major theatre occupations, including the Lifetime Achievement award, as  well as for several categories of acts.\nCurrently the common cultural prize is the Israel Prize.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Israeli Theatre award\n\n#redirect Israeli Theatre Award"
