There is also an open-air museum of forest architecture (a small portion of the planned ethnographic park has been completed) and an eagle-shaped World War II cemetery.\nNext to the museum is the Third Millennium Avenue, along which young oak trees were planted by President Bronisław Komorowski, among others.\nScenes for Jerzy Skolimowski's film Essential Killing were filmed in the village.\nExternal links\n* [http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/city/granica/ Jewish Community in Granica] on Virtual Shtetl\nReferences"
