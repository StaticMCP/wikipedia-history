Cimarron was the first Western to win Best Picture, and would remain the only to do so until Dances with Wolves won in 1990. Cimarron received a then-record seven nominations, and was the first film to win more than two awards; it and A Free Soul were the first films to receive multiple acting nominations.\nNine-year-old Jackie Cooper was the first child actor to receive a nomination and was the youngest nominee until Tatum O'Neal received a nomination for her performance in 1973's Paper Moon. He remains the second-youngest Oscar nominee of all time, and the only Best Actor nominee under age 18. At the ceremony, he fell asleep on the shoulder of Best Actress nominee Marie Dressler; when Dressler was announced as the winner, Cooper had to be eased onto his mother's lap.\nVice President Charles Curtis came in from Washington to address the 1,800 guests, making the ceremony a national event.\nBest Actor winner Lionel Barrymore became the first person to have received nominations in multiple categories, having been nominated for Best Director for Madame X at the 2nd Academy Awards, as well as the only Best Actor winner born in the 1870s.\nWinners and nominees\nNominees were announced on October 5, 1931. Winners are listed first and highlighted in boldface.\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*'Cimarron – William LeBaron for RKO Pictures'\n** East Lynne – Winfield Sheehan for Fox Film Corporation\n** The Front Page – Howard Hughes for United Artists\n** Skippy – Adolph Zukor for Paramount Pictures\n** Trader Horn – Irving Thalberg for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*'Norman Taurog&nbsp;– Skippy'\n** Wesley Ruggles&nbsp;– Cimarron\n** Clarence Brown&nbsp;– A Free Soul\n** Lewis Milestone&nbsp;– The Front Page\n** Josef von Sternberg&nbsp;– Morocco\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*'Lionel Barrymore&nbsp;– A Free Soul as Stephen Ashe'\n** Jackie Cooper&nbsp;– Skippy as Skippy Skinner\n** Richard Dix&nbsp;– Cimarron as Yancey Cravat\n** Fredric March&nbsp;– The Royal Family of Broadway as Tony Cavendish\n** Adolphe Menjou&nbsp;– The Front Page as Walter Burns\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*'Marie Dressler&nbsp;– Min and Bill as Min Divot'\n** Marlene Dietrich&nbsp;– Morocco as Amy Jolly\n** Irene Dunne&nbsp;– Cimarron as Sabra\n** Ann Harding&nbsp;– Holiday as Linda Seton\n** Norma Shearer&nbsp;– A Free Soul as Jan Ashe\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'The Dawn Patrol&nbsp;– John Monk Saunders'\n** The Doorway to Hell&nbsp;– Rowland Brown\n** Laughter&nbsp;– Harry d'Abbadie d'Arrast, Douglas Doty, and Donald Ogden Stewart\n** The Public Enemy&nbsp;– John Bright and Kubec Glasmon\n** Smart Money&nbsp;– Lucien Hubbard and Joseph Jackson\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*'Cimarron&nbsp;– Howard Estabrook, based on the novel by Edna Ferber'\n** The Criminal Code&nbsp;– Seton I.
