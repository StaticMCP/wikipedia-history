Produced by Production I.G and distributed by Kadokawa Pictures, the film is directed by Takayuki Hamana from a script written by Kenji Konuta. The film follows the Library Defense Force protecting a novelist, who becomes the target of the Media Betterment Committee due to the resemblance of his book to a recent terror attack.\nThe anime film adaptation was confirmed in June 2011. Hamana and Konuta joined the staff in December 2011. The voice cast of the anime series confirmed their return to reprise their roles for the film in February 2012, with Issey Ogata and Megumi Han joining them the following month.\nLibrary War: The Wings of Revolution had an early screening in Tokyo on June 5, 2012, and was widely released in Japan on June 16. The film grossed million at the box office.\nPlot\nA terrorist attack has taken place at the Tsuruga Nuclear Power Plant, resulting in the swift passage of an anti-terrorism bill that gives the Media Betterment Committee (MBC) and other agencies additional jurisdiction. While on a date, Iku Kasahara and Atsushi Dojo are called back to the Kanto Library Base to protect Kurato Tōma, the author of Nuclear Peril which has a plotline similar to the recent terrorist attack and who is currently a wanted man by the MBC. After purchasing eyewear as part of Tōma's disguise, Kasahara and Dojo encounter Kiyoka Kojima, a bookstore staff who was also saved by Dojo in the past. The Library Defense Force (LDF) files a lawsuit, with Tōma as the plaintiff, against the MBC at the Tokyo District Court. The court rules in favor of the plaintiff, causing the MBC to file an appeal at a high court. One night, members of the Future Library Committee attempt to abduct Tōma but are apprehended by Mikihisa Komaki and Hikaru Tezuka. Asako Shibasaki then tells Hikaru that she is going to deal with his brother Satoshi.\nTōma is moved from the Kanto Library Base to Kazuichi Inamine's estate. Meanwhile, Shibasaki proposes to Satoshi to become the voice of anti-censorship in the National Diet in exchange for her overlooking his recent plot to abduct Tōma. A few days before the high court's verdict on the appeal, MBC agents infiltrate Inamine's estate, but Kasahara and Dojo manage to bring Tōma back to the Kanto Library Base. On the day of the verdict, the high court rules in favor of the appeal, resulting in the lawsuit being brought to the Supreme Court of Japan. During a meeting, Kasahara suggests Tōma seek asylum, which is then approved by the LDF as a last resort if they fail to win the lawsuit.\nOn the day of the verdict, the Supreme Court rules that Tōma is to be prohibited from writing for five years. Kasahara, Dojo, and other members of the LDF attempt to transport Tōma to the Dutch embassy, but they are blocked by the MBC. Kasahara, Dojo, and Tōma proceed on foot toward the American embassy, during which Dojo gets shot in the leg by an MBC agent. Dojo is brought to Kojima's workplace at the Books Kinokuniya store to recuperate, while Kasahara and Tōma proceed to the consulates found in Osaka. On their way, Tōma tells Kasahara that he is going to write a fairy tale about a troubadour being saved by two bluebirds from oppression to perform music that is not approved by a king.\nKasahara and Tōma arrive near the British Consulate-General, but they are caught by MBC agents. The LDF arrives after receiving Kasahara's coded message about their location, giving her and Tōma time to proceed next to the American consulate, where they are blocked by MBC's huge reinforcements. As the two are about to get caught, a diplomat from the British consulate arrives to save Tōma and accept his asylum after receiving a call from the LDF. The recent incident has garnered the attention of the international community, condemning the Media Betterment Act. One week later, Kasahara visits Dojo in a hospital, where they affirm their love. A year after the revision of the act prohibiting the use of weapons, Kasahara, now married to Dojo, overlooks the recruits in the LDF as their instructor.\nVoice cast\n* Marina Inoue as Iku Kasahara\n* Tomoaki Maeno as Atsushi Dojo\n* Miyuki Sawashiro as Asako Shibasaki\n* Akira Ishida as Mikihisa Komaki\n* Tatsuhisa Suzuki as Hikaru Tezuka\n* Kanji Suzumori as Ryusuke Genda\n* Haruo Satō as Kazuichi Inamine\n* Ryōta Akazawa as Akiya Ogata\n* Hiroyuki Yoshino as Satoshi Tezuka\n* Rie Tanaka as Maki Orikuchi\n* Unshō Ishizuka as Mitsumasa Hikoe\n* Yōji Ueda as Takeshi Enoki\n* Kana Ueda as Marie Nakazawa\n* Megumi Han as Kiyoka Kojima\n* Yūsuke Koide as Rikudō Mark Ingram\n* Issey Ogata as Kurato Tōma\nProduction\nIn June 2011, an anime film based on Library War light novel series by Hiro Arikawa was first reported to be in the works through a pamphlet advertising new releases from Kadokawa Shoten.
