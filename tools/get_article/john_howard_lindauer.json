Then he became an associate professor and full professor at Claremont McKenna College and the Claremont Graduate School from 1966 to 1974.\nAlaska\nHe then moved to Alaska and served as chancellor for the University of Alaska Anchorage from 1976 to 1978 then was dean of the School of Business and Public Affairs.\nLindauer served as one of the state commissioners for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, and later worked at the Alaska Post-Secondary Education Commission.

Leading up to the election he spent $1.7 million on his campaign. However, it was later revealed that nearly all the money he spent on the election came from his wife and was not his own money. Later, he pleaded no contest to charges stemming from campaign finance problems. As a result, he received a one-year suspended sentence, 100 hours of community service, 2 years of probation, and a $15,000 fine. After the sentence, he stated through his lawyer that he would move back to Chicago.\nSelect publications\n* Macroeconomics (1968, 1972, 1976),\n* Stabilization Inflation and the Inflation-Unemployment Trade-off\n* Land Taxation and Indian Economic Development (with Sarjit Singh) 1974\n* The General Theories of Inflation, Unemployment, and Government Deficits 1968, reissued 2012\nReferences\n|-"
