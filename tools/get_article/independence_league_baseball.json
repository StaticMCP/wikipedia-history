The league played its inaugural season in 2022 with ten teams and had eight teams for 2023.  eight teams are listed for the 2024 season.\nHistory\nThe league was announced in October 2021 with seven teams which were leaving the Expedition League:\n* Badlands Big Sticks (Dickinson, North Dakota)\n* Canyon County Spuds (Caldwell, Idaho)\n* Casper Horseheads (Casper, Wyoming)\n* Fremont Moo (Fremont, Nebraska)\n* Hastings Sodbusters (Hastings, Nebraska)\n* Spearfish Sasquatch (Spearfish, South Dakota)\n* Western Nebraska Pioneers (Gering, Nebraska)\nFor the 2022 season, the league added the Gem City Bison (Laramie, Wyoming), the North Platte Plainsmen (North Platte, Nebraska), and the Nebraska Prospects, a traveling team to balance the schedule. The Western Nebraska Pioneers were the champions of the inaugural season.\nFor the 2023 season, the Oahe Zap were founded in Pierre, South Dakota while the North Platte Plainsmen and the Western Nebraska Pioneers left the league to play their own independent schedules. In December 2022, the Casper Horseheads ceased operations after four years in the two leagues and the Canyon County Spuds announced their relocation from Caldwell, Idaho to Casper, Wyoming to become the Casper Spuds. In January 2023, the Gem City Bison announced that they are skipping the 2023 season, citing \"ongoing challenges\", and that they will be \"working diligently\" to return in 2024. In February 2023, the Sawtooth Sockeyes (Caldwell, Idaho) joined the league as an unaffiliated, travel only team to help balance the schedule.\nIn October 2023, the Badlands Big Sticks left the league to join the Northwoods League for the 2024 season.\nthe league website lists five teams as members for the 2024 season (Casper Spuds, Fremont Moo, Hastings Sodbusters, Oahe Zap, Spearfish Sasquatch) and three teams as unaffiliated, travel only teams (Nebraska Prospects, Plainsmen Baseball, Bison Baseball). It isn't stated if the Plainsmen or Bison are connected to the same-named previous teams, nor is there anything said about the Sawtooth Sockeyes absence.\nTeams\nCurrent members\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | Current teams\n|-\n!Team\n!Founded\n!Joined\n!Stadium\n!City\n!Capacity\n|-\n| Bison Baseball || 2024 || 2024 ||None (traveling team) || n/a || n/a\n|-\n| Casper Spuds || 2021 || 2022 || Mike Lansing Field || Casper, WY || 2,500\n|-\n| Fremont Moo || 2019 || 2022 || Moller Field || Fremont, NE || unknown\n|-\n| Hastings Sodbusters ||2018 ||2022 || Duncan Field || Hastings, NE ||2,300\n|-\n| Nebraska Prospects || 2022 ||2022 ||None (traveling team) || n/a || n/a\n|-\n| Plainsmen Baseball ||2024 || 2024 || None (traveling team) || n/a || n/a\n|-\n| Oahe Zap || 2023 || 2023 || Hyde Stadium || Pierre, SD || 1,200\n|-\n| Spearfish Sasquatch ||2018||2022||Black Hills Energy Stadium || Spearfish, SD ||1,100\n|}\nFormer members\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:black\" colspan=\"5\" | Former teams\n|-\n!
