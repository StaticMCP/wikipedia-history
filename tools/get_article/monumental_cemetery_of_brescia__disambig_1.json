It was the first construction project by the Neoclassical architect Rodolfo Vantini, who started its erection in 1813 and dedicated his whole life to its creation.\nHistory\nThe Napoleonic Edict of Saint-Cloud enacted on 12 June 1804 established some rules related to the public healthcare, imposing a certain distance between the place designated for burials and residential areas.\nIn 1806, Brescia was one of the first cities to promulgate a law based on the edict and the city deputation decided to establish a graveyard following the new guidelines. The designated area was chosen to be out of Porta San Giovanni, while on 12 September 1808 the City of Brescia acquired new lands for this purpose. On 19 January 1810, the bishop Gabrio Maria Nava consecrated the place and immediately after the cemetery started to be used. In 1814, after many debates about the facility enhancement, the architect Rodolfo Vantini was nominated to build a funerary chapel.\nDuring the following years, neoclassical arcades and buildings inspired by Hellenistic architecture were added to this area thanks to Vantini even though the whole construction took several years and was only completed at the beginning of the XX century, after Vantini’s death.\nDescription\nThe main sections which compose the Cemetery are:\n* The central chapel dedicated to Saint Michael, whose statue was sculpted by Democrito Gandolfi.\n* The municipal chapel or Rotondina Comunale, the very first pantheon of the cemetery. From 1833 to 1904, 25 politicians and eminent personas from Brescia were buried in this chapel.\n* The green hemicycle opposite to the St. Michael chapel, composed by 66 memorial cenotaphs which tribute renowned Brescian personalities: poets, entrepreneurs, intellectuals and soldiers.\n* The lighthouse, which was finished in 1870, it's 60 meters high and has a circular basement surrounded by porticos and tombs, moreover, a lantern has been positioned on the top. The Berlin Victory Column by the German architect Johann Heinrich Strack was inspired by Vantini's lighthouse. Furthermore, the tomb and the statue of Rodolfo Vantini by Giovanni Seleroni have been positioned inside the monument central hall.\n* The military ossuary, one of the biggest military funerary monument in Italy. It was constructed during the 1920s in order to commemorate the fallen of World War I.\n* The Pantheon (or Famedio in Italian), a hall dedicated to the most eminent people from Brescia and to those who lived there.\n* The pyramidal shaped tomb of Giovanni Battista Bossini.\n* A section for Muslims.\nNotable burials\n* Tito Speri (1825–1853), patriot and hero of the Risorgimento;\n* Rodolfo Vantini (1792–1856), architect and creator of the Cemetery;\n* Giuseppe Zanardelli (1826–1903), jurist and politician, Prime Minister of Italy from 1901 to 1903;\n*  (1782–1836), poet;\n*  (1882–1916), count;\n* Ugo da Como (1869–1941), politician and deputy.\n* Hina Saleem (1985–2006), victim of an honour killing\nMonuments\nBronze monuments\nCimitero monumentale Vantiniano famiglia Da Ponte Domenico Ghidoni Brescia laterale destra.jpg|Christ the Redeemer\nCimitero monumentale Vantiniano cenotafio Zanardelli Ettore Ximenes Brescia sinistra.jpg|Zanardelli's tomb by Ettore Ximenes\nCimitero monumentale Vantiniano busto di Antonio Tagliaferri Brescia dettaglio.jpg|Antonio Tagliaferri bust\nCimitero Vantiniano busto di Cristo Brescia.jpg|Christ bust\nCimitero Vantiniano monumento funebre famiglia Basiletti Bonfadio Emilio Quadrelli 1891 Brescia.jpg|Weeping women\nCimitero Vantiniano monumento funebre famiglia Cuni di Luigi Contratti Brescia.jpg|Cuni's family tomb\nCimitero Vantiniano monumento funebre famiglia Martinengo Cesaresco di Democrito Gandolfi 1832 Brescia.jpg|Martinengo Cesaresco's family tomb\nMarble monuments\nFile:Cimitero monumentale Vantiniano famiglia Soncini fronte Brescia.jpg|Soccini's family tomb\nFile:Cimitero Vantiniano di Annible Calini Abbondio Sangiorgio.jpg|Annible Calini monument\nFile:Cimitero monumentale Vantiniano famiglia Facchi Angelo Boninsegna Brescia.jpg|Facchi's family tomb\nFile:Cimitero Vantiniano monumento a Cesare Arici Francesco Somaini.jpg|Cesare Arici monument\nFile:Cimitero Vantiniano monumento a Giovan Battista Gigola di GB Lombardi Brescia.jpg|Giovan Battista Gigola monument\nFile:Cimitero Vantiniano tomba Pitozzi Baggi di GB Lombardi 1861.jpg|Pitozzi Baggi's family tomb\nFile:Cimitero Vantiniano monumento Panciera di Zoppola di GB Lombardi 1855 sinistra.jpg|Panciera di Zoppola's family tomb\nFile:Cimitero Vantiniano monumento Dossi Rampinelli Spalenza di GB Lombardi 1856 dettaglio.jpg|Dossi Rampinelli Spalenza's family tomb\nFile:Cimitero Vantiniano monumento Massimini di Giannino Castiglioni Brescia.jpg|Massimini's family tomb\nFile:Cimitero Vantiniano monumento funebre famiglia Vigliani di Francesco Gusmeri 1895 Brescia.jpg|Vigliani's family tomb\nFile:Cimitero Vantiniano monumento funebre famiglia Monti della Corte di Giovanni Antonio Labus Brescia.jpg|Monti della Corte's family tomb\nFile:Cimitero Vantiniano monumento funebre famiglia Mazzucchelli di Giovanni Battista Lombardi Brescia.jpg|Mazzucchelli's family tomb\nFile:Cimitero Vantiniano monumento funebre famiglia Maffei Erizzo di Abbondio Sangiorgio sinistra Brescia.jpg|Maffei Erizzo's family tomb\nGallery\nFile:Cimitero monumentale Vantiniano gruppo Pietà di Ermenegildo Luppi lato Ovest Brescia.jpg|Pietà\nFile:Cimitero monumentale Vantiniano San Michele monumento Caduti Ovest Brescia.jpg|Monument to the Fallen of World War I\nFile:Cimitero monumentale Vantiniano San Michele lato Sud Brescia.jpg|St. Michael Church\nFile:Tomba di Tito Speri.jpg|Tito Speri tomb\nFile:Cimitero Vantiniano monumento Giovanni Battista Bossini a Brescia.jpg|Don Bossini tomb\nFile:Cimitero monumentale Vantiniano lato Est Brescia.jpg|Eastern view\nFile:Cimitero monumentale Vantiniano San Michele lato nord Brescia.jpg|General view of the Cemetery\nFile:Cimitero monumentale Vantiniano cenotafio Zanardelli Ettore Ximenes Brescia.jpg|Tomb of Giuseppe Zanardelli\nFile:Cimitero monumentale Vantiniano Monumento ai Prodi Bresciani di Luigi Pagani 1879.jpg|Prodi Bresciani monument\nSee also\n* List of cemeteries\n* Rodolfo Vantini\n* Berlin Victory Column\n* Monumental Cemetery of Milan\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
