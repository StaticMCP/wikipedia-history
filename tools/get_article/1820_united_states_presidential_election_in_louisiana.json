The state legislature chose three representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nDuring this election, Louisiana cast its three electoral votes to Democratic Republican candidate and incumbent President James Monroe.\nEffectively, the 1820 presidential election was an election with no campaign, since there was no serious opposition to Monroe and Tompkins. In fact, they won all the electoral votes barring one from New Hampshire, which was cast for Secretary of State John Quincy Adams.\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Louisiana\nReferences"
