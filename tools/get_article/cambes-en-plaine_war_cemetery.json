The cemetery contains 224 graves of which one is unidentified.\nHistory\nFollowing the Allied landings on D-Day, elements of the East Riding Yeomanry, supporting the British 3rd Infantry Division pushed through to the northern outskirts of Cambes-en-Plaine on 9 June 1944. A defensive German line here stopped the advance on Caen. A large number of burials date to between the 8 and 12 July 1944, during Operation Charnwood, the final attack on Caen. Over half of the burials in the graveyard are from soldiers in the 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division.\nLocation\nThe cemetery is located in the commune of Cambes-en-Plaine, in the Calvados department of Normandy, on the Rue du Mesnil Ricard (D.79B).\nPhotographs\nFile:Cambes-En-Plaine War Cemetery -1.JPG|Entrance to the war cemetery\nFile:Cambes-En-Plaine War Cemetery -3.JPG|Sacrificial cross in the cemetery\nFile:Cambes-En-Plaine War Cemetery -9.JPG|Brouay war cemetery\nFile:Cambes-En-Plaine_War_Cemetery_-8.JPG|Graves of 59th (Staffordshire) Division soldiers\nSee also\n* American Battle Monuments Commission\n* UK National Inventory of War Memorials\n* German War Graves Commission\n* List of military cemeteries in Normandy\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Shilleto, Carl, and Tolhurst, Mike (2008).
