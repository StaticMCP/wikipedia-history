P. J. Abdul Kalam inspecting the Malacañang Honor Guards during 2006]]\nThe Presidential Security Command (PSC), known from 1986 to 2024 as the Presidential Security Group (PSG), is a Philippine close protection agency. It is the primary agency concerned with providing close-in security and escort to the President of the Philippines, their immediate families, former presidents of the Philippines as well as visiting heads of state.\nThe PSC is stationed at Malacañang Palace, the official residence of the president. Members of the PSC also accompany the president on both domestic and overseas trips.\nHistory\nOn June 23, 1898, a guards unit called as the Cuerpo de la Guardia Presidencial (Presidential Guard Corps) was raised at the time to protect the first official president, Emilio Aguinaldo, from attempts on his life. Composed of a presidential cavalry squadron and artillery batteries, reinforced with multiple guards infantry battalions all under the command of Major Geronimo Gatmaitan, which provided the protection of President Aguinaldo and his family. Like today's PSC, they wore rayadillo uniforms, but with straw hats.\nIn 1936, the 1st Cavalry Regiment of the 1st Infantry Division, Philippine Army, raised the same year, was tasked with defending President Manuel Quezon, his family, and the palace complex. On May 22, 1938, they were joined by the Malacañang Guard, made up of a company organized into two to three platoons with a little over a hundred members, to reinforce the President's security.  In February 1939, the Malacañang Guard was transferred to the Philippine Constabulary.\nDuring the Second World War, the Presidential Guards were combined with the Philippine Constabulary and Manila ROTC units to form the new Second Regular Division which fought in Bataan.  After the inauguration of the Second Philippine Republic, units of the occupying Imperial Japanese Army initially took over guard duties at the palace, only to be replaced by an all-Filipino guard battalion at the insistence of President José P. Laurel. During the Battle of Manila in 1945, Presidential Guardsmen remained at their posts in Malacañang.  At war's end, it was in turn replaced by the AFP Presidential Guards Battalion under the orders of President Sergio Osmeña and would remain until the time of his successor, Manuel Roxas.\nThe PSG of today traces its origins to 1950 when President Elpidio Quirino transferred the Presidential Guards Battalion under the control of the Philippine Constabulary (PC) in 1950. At the same time, a separate presidential security unit was founded as the secret service and protective unit of the state presidency, the First Family, and Malacañang Palace, under the control of the Constabulary (first the Secret Service of Malacañang Palace then later renamed into the Presidential Security Force, the Presidential Security Unit, and then the Presidential Security Agency). On October 22, 1971, under the Presidency of Ferdinand Marcos, General Order No. 212 GHQ, AFP was issued, creating the Presidential Security Command (PSC) as a unified command of the AFP.\nWhen President Corazon Aquino was sworn in as president, she gave the order to disband the PSC and replace with \"a leaner\" Presidential Security Group (PSG), with then-Army Colonel (and future Secretary of National Defense) Voltaire Gazmin as its chief. This was formalized by General Order No. 60, GHQ-New Armed Forces of the Philippines (NAFP), which deactivated the PSC and activated the PSG as one of the support units of the NAFP. The PSG, then as in the present, has always included both civilian agents and seconded servicemen from the Armed Forces.\nThe PSG launched the PSG Troopers website on February 10, 2017, as part of an effort to improve public relations. Information concerning the president's security arrangements are considered as classified.\nFour PSG officers were wounded in an encounter with New People's Army guerillas in Arakan, North Cotabato after they were spotted running a fake vehicle checkpoint.\nOn September 26, 2017, a PSG officer was found dead inside the Malacañang complex with a gunshot wound to the chest.\nIn January 2024, the Department of National Defense officially disclosed that the Presidential Security Group (PSG) was expanded from a group to a command, now officially known again as the Presidential Security Command (PSC), restoring the setup of the organization during the time of President Ferdinand Marcos, late father and namesake of the current President, Bongbong Marcos. The term PSC was earlier utilized on January 19 when the agency's Commander, MGen. Nelson Morales, issued a statement reacting to criticisms on Marcos’ use of the presidential helicopter to travel to the Philippine Arena in Bulacan to watch the Coldplay concert.\nIn July 2024, the Vice Presidential Security and Protection Group (VPSPG), a separate unit activated in 2022 that was responsible for the security of Vice President Sara Duterte, was revealed to have been integrated into the reorganized Command after the elevation of the 75 personnel of the Police Security and Protection Group (PSPG) assigned to the VPSPG were transferred to the National Capital Region Police Office.\nRole\nThe role of the PSC is tasked with:\n* Providing security to:\n** The president and their immediate family.\n** The president-elect and their immediate family.\n** Visiting heads of states or diplomats and Cabinet members and their families travelling with them and other guests.\n** Visitors of the Presidential Museum and Library.\n* Providing escort security for them at all times.\n* Securing the president residences, offices, and places of engagements.\n* Surveillance and monitoring activities.\n* Performing state protocol duties including honor guard duties.\n* Public Order, Public Safety, & Crowd Control.\nThe Presidential Security Command also have other functions, such as providing support to other government agencies. They assist the AFP and PNP in its anti-organized-crime and corruption undertakings as well as maintaining public order and safety, usually authorized by the Office of the President. They also conduct community service efforts in local communities, and maintain and secure all facilities and transportation assets used by the offices of the president and vice president in doing its regular and non-regular functions. The role of securing the Vice President and it’s immediate family is under the Vice Presidential Security and Protection Group (VPSPG).\nOrganization\nThe following are organized under the PSC (formerly the PSG) as of 2023:\nKey personnel\n# Commander\n# Chief of Staff\n# Special Reaction Unit Commander\n# Commanding Officers\n#* Headquarters and Headquarters Service Battalion\n#* Security Battalion\n#* Presidential Escorts Battalion\n#* Presidential Guards Battalion\nUnits\n* Headquarters & Headquarters Service Battalion\n* Presidential Escorts - the actual personnel accompanying the President and his/her immediate family\n* Guard Battalion\n* Security Battalion\n* Special Reaction Unit\n** K9 Unit\n* PSG Station Hospital\n* PSG Dental Dispensary\n* Presidential Intelligence Company\n* PSG Training School\n* PSG Band\n* Philippine National Police-Police Security and Protection Group (PNP-PSPG) Presidential Protection Division\nRecruitment\nAgents are usually personnel from the Armed Forces of the Philippines, Philippine National Police and Philippine Coast Guard.  However, there are a few civilian personnel acting as support units.\nMilitary and police personnel serving in the PSC retain the ranks and insignia of their parent service which are worn in almost all orders of dress.\nEquipment\nPSC members are known to carry assorted firearms, some known firearms include:\n|File:M1911A1.png|M1911 pistol\n|File:First-year_H&K_USP_9mm_(32415150000)_modified.png|Heckler & Koch USP\n|File:Heckler_&_Koch_MP5-1.jpg|Heckler & Koch MP5\n|File:Gewehr_G36_noBG.jpg|Heckler & Koch G36\n|File:M4A1 ACOG.png|Colt/Elisco\nM4A1 5.56mm Assault Rifle\n|File:Remington_R4_Rifle.JPG|Remington R4 5.56mm Carbine\n|File:FN_MAG_white_background.jpg|FN MAG\n|File:Armbrust_rocket_launcher_photo_Iraq_OIG.jpg|Armbrust\n|File:54RA-IMG_9142.jpg|Mistral (missile)\n}}\nThe PSC utilizes Motorola trunked two-way radios with encryption capability.\nVehicles\nThe PSC currently uses a fleet of vehicles, ranging from motorcycles; armored modified sedans and mid-sized vehicles; and armored personnel carriers.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://psgtroopers.com/2017/ Official Site]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160718075731/http://www.psg.mil.ph/index.php Old site of the Presidential Security Group] (Archive)"
