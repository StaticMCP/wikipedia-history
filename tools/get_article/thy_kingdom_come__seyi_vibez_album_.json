It was released on 24 June 2023, through Vibez Inc, and Dvpper Music. The album included guest appearances from Nigerian indigenous rapper Phyno, and South African singer Ami Faku. It was executively produced by Dvpper Music founder and CEO Dapper, and Seyi Vibez, along with production from Dibs.  The album is a mixture of Afropop, Amapiano, Nigerian Hip Hop, Afroswing, R&B/Soul, Arabic hip hop, and Fuji fusion.\nBackground\nIn 2023, Seyi Vibez announced the release of his debut project, two weeks after releasing Vibe Till Thy Kingdom Come. The project debuted at number three, and reached number two on Nigeria's TurnTable official album chart.\nPromotion\nOn 27 June 2023, Seyi announced a free homecoming show to promote the album and his previous album Vibe Till Thy Kingdom Come.\nCritical reception\n}}\nAdeayo Adebiyi, a music reporter for Pulse Nigeria stated that “With ‘Thy Kingdom Come’, Seyi Vibez thumps his chest while maintaining a resolution to make music that retains the core elements of his identity. The result is an album that achieves a musical depth that surpasses his previous efforts”. Reviewing for MoreBranches, Patrick Ezema stated that “His lyrics betray, brave as he may try to be, the pain of his loss, but his emptiness is better felt in the things left unsaid; spaces in the album where there should be chaotic log drums, he fills with more morose horns. A similar cloud overshadowed Vibe Till Thy Kingdom Come, but on Thy Kingdom Come the first signs of healing appear over his wounds, as he contends with the finality of loss”.\nRankings\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"border:none; margin:0;\"\n|+Select rankings of Thy Kingdom Come\n! scope=\"col\"| Publication\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| List\n! scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| Rank\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\"| Pulse Nigeria\n|Pulse Nigeria s Top 10 Afrobeats albums (EP & LP) for the first half of 2022\n|\n| }}\n|}\nTrack listing\n| extra6          =\n| length6         = 2:20\n| title7          = Trumpet\n| writer7         = Oluwaloseyi\n| extra7          =\n| length7         = 2:45\n| title8          = Flakky\n| note8           = feat.
