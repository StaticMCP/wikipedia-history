He played just one first class innings for Rhodesia in 1965 when he was dismissed for a duck and failed to take a wicket.  However, he represented Western Province with distinction between 1967/68 and 1980/81. In both the 1978 and 1979 English summers he was an overseas player for Glamorgan and in the former season won their player of the year award. He had scored over 1000 runs during the season for the Welsh county and managed his career best of 122 against Worcestershire at Swansea.\nSwart retired in 1985 having performed the double of 2000 runs and 200 wickets in the Currie Cup.\nReferences"
