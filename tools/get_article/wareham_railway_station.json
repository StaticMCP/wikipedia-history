It is situated about  north of the town centre and  down the line from  on the South West Main Line. On tickets, the station is printed as \"Wareham, Dorset\" to avoid confusion with Ware railway station.\nHistory\nThe original Wareham station was built to serve the Southampton and Dorchester Railway and opened in 1847.\nThe current station opened in 1887, replacing the original station, and was sited east of what is now only a pedestrian crossing but was once a busy road level crossing (the road now bridges the railway)\nUntil 1967, trains through the station were normally steam hauled. Class 205 (2H) diesel-electric multiple units were used during the final years of British Rail operation on the Swanage branch. Between 1967 and 1988, passenger services on the London-Weymouth line were normally provided by Class 33/1 diesel locomotives with Class 438 coaching stock (also known as 4-TC units). The line was electrified in 1988, using the standard British Rail Southern Region direct current third rail at 750 volts. After electrification, Class 442 electric multiple units were initially used, but these were replaced by Class 444s in 2007.\nBranch line to Swanage\nThis station had two bay platforms which served the branch line to Swanage from 1885 until 1972, when the branch was closed.\nThe branch line to Swanage forms part of the preserved Swanage Railway, a steam locomotive-operated heritage railway that currently operates between Swanage and a Park and Ride site at Norden, just north of Corfe Castle.\nThe rail connection between the Swanage Railway and the Network Rail tracks at Worgret Junction has been restored. On summer Saturdays, trains run through from a number of South Western Railway stations, including London Waterloo and Salisbury through Wareham to Corfe Castle to link with Swanage Railway services.\nHeritage services on the line run between Swanage and Norden station, near Corfe Castle. On 13 June 2017, a four-coach diesel-hauled trial service began running to Wareham; this was the first train to work between the two towns since the Swanage branch closed in 1972. Special services operated between Wareham and Swanage on some dates during the summer of 2017 as a trial. A further trial took place in the form of a four trains a day service on Tuesdays, Wednesday, Thursdays and Saturdays between 4 April and 9 September 2023, operated by Swanage Railways.\nServices\nWareham station is served by one South Western Railway service an hour on each direction on the South West Main Line between London Waterloo and Weymouth, strengthened to twice per hour on Saturdays.\nPrior to 9 December 2007, it was the terminus for an hourly local service from Brockenhurst, but this has now been partially replaced by the additional Weymouth service.\nFollowing trials in 2017 and 2023, there are no further plans to operate services on the Swanage Railway to Wareham.\n|route1=South Western RailwaySouth West Main Line|previous=Wool or |next2=|route2=South Western RailwayLondon Waterloo to Corfe CastleSummer Saturdays only |col=}}\n|system2=Heritage railways/UK\n|line2=Swanage Railway|note-mid2=Special events only|left2=Norden|to-left2=Swanage\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links"
