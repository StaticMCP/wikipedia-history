An Act of Congress of 31 January 1862 authorized President Abraham Lincoln to seize control of the railroads and telegraph for military use in January 1862.  In practice, however, the USMRR restricted its authority to Southern rail lines captured in the course of the war. As a separate organization for rail transportation, the USMRR is one of the predecessors of the modern United States Army Transportation Corps.\nThis is a partial list of the civil engineers who worked on the USMRR during the American Civil War (1862-1867) as reported by General Daniel McCallum in 1866.\nMilitary railroad civil engineers\nVirginia (1862–1866)\n*Anderson, Adna (1827–1889), engineer of repairs for railroads running from Alexandria.\n*Beggs, John S., (1821–1889) superintendent of railroads running from Harper's Ferry, West Virginia (Winchester and Potomac Railroad).
