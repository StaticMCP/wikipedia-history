This lineage society supported preservation and recognition of sites and properties important to American history.\nShe was also the first benefactor of the Princeton University Graduate College.\nWith Kate McFarlane, Ward organized the Washington Headquarters Association of Rocky Hill. They helped preserve Rockingham, the final headquarters of General George Washington during the Revolutionary War. After passing into private hands in the mid-19th century, it was bought by a quarry and used for worker housing. Ward and McFarlane raised money to buy the house and move it away from the quarry, which would undermine it.\nMarriage and family, private life\nIn 1845 Ward married the widower and US Senator John R.

The couple separated in 1880.\nWard Thomson was a frequent participant in Miss Matoaca Gay's Shakespeare seminars in Washington, DC during the 1880s and 1890s.\nShe died 2 March 1906 in Washington, D.C. and is buried at Princeton, New Jersey.\nReferences"
