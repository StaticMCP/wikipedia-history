Therefore, he sought peace with the Kidarites and offered them his sister in marriage but instead sent an imposter. The Sasanians allied with the Hepthalites in order to align against the Hepthalites and eventually the Hepthalite - Kidarite War of 467 turned out to be the demise of the Kidarites.\nAftermath\nThe Kidarites suffering defeats against the Hepthalites and Sassanids pushed them out of Central asia and Bactria, which would eventually lead them to Gandhara and would come in conflict with the Guptas.\nReferences"
