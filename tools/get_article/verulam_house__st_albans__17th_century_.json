The main source describing it is John Aubrey's Brief Lives (1669-1696). It was named after Verulamium, the ancient Roman city of St Albans, though it was not sited within that city's walls as Aubrey asserted.\nHistory\nBacon completed it around 1617, partly motivated by a drought which starved the advanced plumbing system built at Gorhambury by his father - Bacon stated that \"since he could not carry the water to his house, he would carry his house to the water\". He picked a site next to water gardens he had already constructed and Aubrey writes that he was assisted in the designs by the father of the painter William Dobson. Again according to Aubrey, it cost £9000-£10,000 and included underground larders, an underground kitchen and two rooms for Turkish baths.\nBacon died childless and so his will conveyed Verulam House to trustees for the use of his secretary Thomas Meautys. It then passed to Bacon's widow Anne's second husband Sir Harbottle Grimston, who assigned Verulam House to his son George upon the latter's marriage. It was occupied by George's widow after his death without issue. Neglected during the English Civil War, it was demolished in 1663 or 1665-1666 and the materials sold off to two carpenters for £400, who then sold them on for double the price they had paid for them.\nReferences\ncategory:Buildings and structures in St Albans\ncategory:17th-century architecture in England"
