He served as the Secretary-General of the National Security Council from 25 March 2014 until 12 February 2015. King was widely regarded as the most important aide to Ma Ying-jeou. He served as the Secretary-General of Kuomintang (KMT) from December 2009 to January 2011. King also served as Vice Mayor of Taipei from 2002 to 2006 and had previously been a scholar of journalism. King is alleged to be a descendant of the Aisin Gioro clan.\nEducation\nAfter graduating from National Tainan Second Senior High School, King studied journalism at National Chengchi University and received his bachelor's degree in the subject. He then completed graduate studies in the United States, where he earned a  Master of Arts (M.A.) in mass communication from Texas Tech University and his Ph.D. in communications specializing in journalism from the University of Texas at Austin in 1994 under journalism scholar Maxwell McCombs. His doctoral dissertation was titled, \"Issue agendas in the 1992 Taiwan legislative election.\"\nEarly career\nKing had taught at National Chengchi University. He also had taught at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in Hong Kong.\nKMT Secretary-General\nAs Secretary-General, King pledged to sort out financial questions of national funds that had been mixed with party assets, and urged party members to provide more than \"lip service\" to support party candidates in the run-up to the mayoral elections at the end of 2010.\nPersonal life\nKing is alleged to be related to the last Qing emperor Puyi, although lack of genealogical evidence has raised suspicions. Were his relation to the imperial family true, he would also be the cousin of Puru and his surname King a sinified adoption of the Qing imperial clan name Aisin Gioro.\nSee also\n* Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office\n* Manchu people in Taiwan\nReferences"
