And his forces started a series of devastating theft and extreme looting. In the same year he marched to Baalbek and put the sword to the necks of its people, killing the majority of its inhabitants, and contemporary historians' statements confirm his harsh revenge against the people of Baalbek, and do not give a reason for the killing. Al-Tabari and Ibn Al-Atheer agreed on the following statement: “He killed most of its people until there was nothing left of them - as was said - except for a little, then he killed the animals.”\nTulunids\n.]]\nThe Tulunids were overthrown by the sailor Demian, known as “Demian of Tyre,” who was famously known for repelling the Byzantines, along with the great sailor Leo of Tripoli, the Tyrian naval fleet achieved a victory over the Byzantines under the leadership of the Qadi Muhammad ibn al-Abbas al-Jamahi in the year 296 AH / 908 AD.\nAbbasids\nUnder the command of Ibn Zakarwayh, Baalbek disobeyed al-Muktafi and began to pray and preach to the leader of the Qarmatians. But Muhammad bin Suleiman, a senior official and commander of the Abbasid Caliphate, was able to return the whole of the Levant to the fold of the caliphate after he got rid of its Qarmatian influence and put down their revolution in the year 291 AH / 906 AD. Baalbek returned to the authority of the Abbasids.\nTyre re-entered the possession of the Abbasid leader \"Muhammad bin Ra'iq\" in the year 327 AH / 938 AD, where he stayed for some time with a Ghulam named Mashreq. And before Ibn Ra’iq went to Baghdad in the year 329 AH / 940 AD, he gave Tyre and Jordan to “Badr bin Ammar” the ruler of Tiberias - also said to be the ruler of Tripoli.\nIkhshidids\nBaalbek was oscillating between the rule of the Ikhshidids and the Hamdanids. Following the death of Muhammad bin Ra’iq, the Abbasid leader of the Levant in the year 330 AH / 941 AD, Muhammad bin Tughj, nicknamed Ikhshid, annexed the Levant to Egypt, and in the year 333 AH / 944 AD the Abbasid ruler Al-Mustakfi approved him over Egypt and the Levant.\nminted in Palestine under al-Ikhshid, 944 CE. From 942 on, Ibn Tughj included his name and title (\"Muhammad al-Ikhshid\"), alongside that of the caliph in his coinage.]]\nRevolt of Tripoli\nIn Tripoli, 357 AH corresponding to the year 968 AD, there was a revolution against the Ikhshidid rule as a result of the tyranny of the governor, Abu al-Hasan Ahmed bin Ghurair al-Arghli, and his injustice and cruelty in the treatment of the people. It is known that Tripoli was affiliated at the time to the Wilayat of Damascus, and that the Damascene wali is the one who appoints the governor of Tripoli. The people expelled the ruler from the city, so he settled in the  and fortified it, and the residents of Tripoli became without a ruler or an Amir. In the meantime, the Byzantine Emperor Nikephoros Phocas II arrived in Tripoli during his campaign in the Levant, aiming to seize the region from Muslim control. By this point, he had already captured the northern part of the country, including Arqa. He arrested Abu Al-Hassan bin Ghurair Al-Arghli and took all his money, then he went to Tripoli and went down to it on the day of Eid Al-Adha and stayed in it that night and burned its territory and returned to the coastal countries.\nof Nikephoros II (right) alongside Mother Mary, 963-969 AD.]]\nHamdanids\nAfter the establishment of the Hamdanid state in Aleppo, Saif al-Dawla extended his authority to Baalbek  in the year 335 AH / 947 AD. Although Damascus revolted against Sayf al-Dawla, and favored the Ikhshidids when Kafur al-Ikhshidi regained it, Baalbek separated from Damascus, and remained a fortress for Sayf al-Dawla until his death in the year 356 AH / 967 AD. After the death of Saif al-Dawla, the Byzantines invaded it, and plundered it along with all the other Hamdanid cities.\nFatimids\nIn the year 359 AH / 970 AD, the Fatimid leader (Jawhar) arrived in Damascus and took possession of it and then he went to Baalbek and subjugated it and performed a sermon in it to the Fatimid Caliph Al-Mu’izz after it had been to the Abbasid Al-Muti’. And the call to prayer was made in  (an Adhān'' formula) and the city followed the deputy of Damascus, Jaafar bin Falah.\nAnti-Fatimid rebellions\nIn 975, the anti-Fatimid rebel Alptakin resolved to extend his influence over the Bekaa Valley and the coastal Lebanese cities shortly after his occupation of Damascus, so he marched towards Baalbek to fight Zālim Ibn Mawhūb, and succeeded in defeating him. He fled and hid with Prince Tamim bin Al-Mundhir bin Al-Nu`man Al-Arslani, then he wrote to Al-Mu`izz informing him of the situation, so Al-Mu`izz ordered him to reside in Sidon.\nTyrian Revolt\nA revolt was led by a sailor named Allaqa took place in Tyre against Fatimid influence and perceived neglect, the rebels drove out the Fatimids for two years until the revolt was suppressed with the help of Hamdanid prince Abu Abdallah al-Husayn in 998, whereby the latter was subsequently assigned as governor of the city and its surroundings.\nEvents\n900s\ncampaigns of consolidation, : areas under direct Abbasid control in dark green, areas under loose Abbasid suzerainty, but under autonomous governors, in light green.
