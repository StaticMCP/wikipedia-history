Kicking Sunrise signed to Right coast Music in March 2014. The independent record label commented after signing Kicking Sunrise: \"This is a great era to be launching new music, and we are grateful for the opportunity to bring new and exciting music to the worldwide community.\"\nTo get some inspiration while writing ''Here's to the Sunrise'', Kicking Sunrise drove from Washington Township (Gloucester County), New Jersey to Huntington Beach, California and lived on the West Coast for ten months. The album took about three months to write, and is a combination of pop, hip hop and R&B. Lead singer Joe Murphy stated that, \"It's a feel good, summertime beach vibe. It's chill.\"\nKicking Sunrise released their album ''Here's to the Sunrise'' through Right Coast Music on June 2, 2015. They released one promotional single from the album: \"Here's to the Sunrise\" on April 10, 2015. Kicking Sunrise states that on the album, \"You can expect a lot of diversity. The album has a lot of different sounds and songs but all have a core sound, where you know it's Kicking Sunrise.\"\nKicking Sunrise released a music video of their single \"Here's to the Sunrise\" on Vevo in June, 2016.\nKicking Sunrise also released two acoustic videos of their songs from the ''Here's to the Sunrise'' album.

According to Murphy, \"Sky High gives you that self-confidence when you're doubting yourself. This song was written to remind you that it's okay to accept who you are and allows you to recognize the obstacles that makes you a stronger individual today.\" \"Sky High\" has a \"feel good funk\" sound and contains exciting, upbeat elements throughout the song.\nThe other two singles \"Give Me Tonight\" and \"By Myself\" were released along with their EP ''When It's Right'' on January 4, 2018.\nKicking Sunrise's single \"Stay Beautiful\" was released under the record label Right Coast Music on January 25, 2019.\nOn August 23, 2019, Kicking Sunrise released their single \"Underneath\".

In the visual for the single, Murphy's girlfriend (and now-fiancée) believes she is helping capture footage for a new project, but soon realizes that it'll be a day she remembers for the rest of her life. After its release, Murphy stated \"We’ll look back at this video and be able to reconnect with how much this moment meant to us and the unconditional love we have for each other. This is something we’ll have for years to come and hopefully share with our grandchildren someday.\" The duo also released their newest single \"Forever\" on March 12, 2021.\nInfluences\nConsidering Kicking Sunrise's music has a lot of diversity, both members have different influences.
