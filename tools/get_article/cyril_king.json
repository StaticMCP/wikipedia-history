Paiewonsky.\nEarly life\nKing was born in Frederiksted on the island of Saint Croix, where he lived during his formative years. During World War II, he served in the 873rd Port Company in Hawaii.\nAfter the completion of his service, he attended the American University, where he earned a public administration degree.\nPolitical career\nStarting in 1949, King worked for Minnesota senator Hubert Humphrey, as the first black member of staff of the U.S. Senate. He rose through the ranks of the office, eventually becoming chief of staff. He returned to the islands in 1961 as government secretary on the appointment of President John F. Kennedy .\nTo support his election for governor in 1970 and challenge the Democratic Party in the Virgin Islands, he developed the Independent Citizens Movement. Even though his 1970 campaign was unsuccessful, he ran again in 1974 and won, becoming the second governor of the Virgin Islands. At the time of his death, he had been planning to run for a second term.\nDeath\nWhile stateside on official business in 1977, King took ill and decided to return to the territory where he was welcomed by a large crowd of supporters at the airport that now bears his name. He worked from home but never recovered fully, and died on January 2, 1978. It was eventually revealed he suffered from cancer.\nLegacy\nA Virgin Islands statute puts aside April 7, King's birthday, as Cyril Emmanuel King Day.\nIn 1984, the Harry S. Truman Airport on St. Thomas was renamed Cyril E. King Airport by the Virgin Islands Legislature.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://mls.stx.k12.vi/MLS_WebSite/Profiles/kingc.htm Profiles of Outstanding Virgin Islanders]  (includes link to photo)\n|-"
