Advocates of IBC promote the idea of \"becoming your own banker\" by accumulating cash value in a dividend-paying permanent life insurance policy and then borrowing against that value for one’s financial needs instead of relying on traditional bank loans. The concept was introduced in the 1980s by insurance agent R. Nelson Nash and detailed in his 2000 book, Becoming Your Own Banker. Proponents claim that IBC allows individuals to recapture interest payments and gain financial control by self-financing purchases, while critics argue it is a complex and expensive approach that benefits insurance companies and agents more than policyholders. The Infinite Banking Concept remains a subject of debate in financial circles, with a dedicated following of practitioners alongside substantial skepticism from mainstream financial advisors.\nHistory\nThe Infinite Banking Concept was developed by R. Nelson Nash (1931–2019) in the early 1980s. Nash conceived the idea after encountering financial strain from high interest rates on bank loans, which prompted him to leverage the cash value of his whole life insurance policies for personal financing. A career life insurance agent with a background in forestry and an interest in Austrian economics, Nash synthesized these experiences into a strategy for “personal banking” using life insurance. He began teaching the concept through seminars in the late 1980s and 1990s.\nIn 2000, Nash self-published Becoming Your Own Banker: Unlock the Infinite Banking Concept, a short book outlining the IBC principles. The book gained a grassroots following and Nash updated it in multiple editions throughout the 2000s. In it, Nash argued that individuals could create a “private banking system” by building up cash surrender value in participating (dividend-paying) whole life insurance and then borrowing against it for major expenses, thereby “paying interest to themselves” rather than to banks. Nash’s ideas drew on his study of economic cycles and distrust of the fractional reserve banking system, resonating with some proponents of Austrian School economics.\nOver the following decades, IBC spread through a network of financial professionals and workshops. Nash founded Infinite Banking Concepts, LLC and an associated practitioner program to train insurance advisors in the method. In 2010, economist Robert P. Murphy and financial consultant L. Carlos Lara co-authored How Privatized Banking Really Works, integrating Nash’s banking concept with free-market economic theory. An industry grew around IBC, including the Nelson Nash Institute (formerly Infinite Banking Institute) which promotes the concept’s education. Nash’s work was recognized in some economic circles – for example, the Foundation for Economic Education gave him an award in 2018 for his contributions to financial education. Nash continued to lecture on IBC until his death in 2019, after which followers have carried on his legacy through institutes, podcasts, and seminars.\nFurther reading\n* Nash, R. Nelson.
