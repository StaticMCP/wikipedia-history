It includes all tram systems in Ireland, past and present; cities with currently operating systems, and those systems themselves, are indicated in bold and blue background colored rows. The use of the diamond (♦) symbol indicates where there were (or are) two or more independent tram systems operating concurrently within a single metropolitan area.  Those tram systems that operated on other than standard gauge track (where known) are indicated in the 'Notes' column.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=100%\n|-\n! width=17% | Name of System\n! width=17% | Location\n! width=12% | TractionType\n! width=12% | Date (From)\n! width=12% | Date (To)\n! class=\"unsortable\" width=30% | Notes\n|-\n| Arigna Tramway\n| Arigna\n| Steam\n| 1887\n| 1959\n| Operated by the Cavan, Leitrim & Roscommon Light Railway and Tramway Company Limited\n|-\n| Cork Tramways Company\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Cork\n| Horse\n| 12 Sep 1872\n| Dec 1875\n| &nbsp;\n|-\n| Cork Electric Tramways and Lighting Company\n| Electric\n| 2 Dec 1898\n| 30 Sep 1931\n| Gauge:\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Dublin United Tramways\n| style=\"background:#CFECEC\" rowspan=3 | Dublin\n| Horse\n| 1 Feb 1872\n| 1901\n| &nbsp;\n|-\n| Electric\n| 16 May 1896\n| 3 Jul 1949\n| Operation suspended during part of 1944 because of fuel (coal) shortage; service restored 2 October 1944.\n|- style=\"background:#CFECEC\"\n| Luas\n| Electric\n| 30 Jun 2004\n| &nbsp;\n| Light rail\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | Dublin Southern District Tramways\n| rowspan=3 | ♦ Dublin – Dún Laoghaire – Dalkey\n| Horse\n| 17 Mar 1879\n| ?\n| rowspan=\"3\" | Opened in stages, completed 9 July 1885.
