It contains the town of Anakie. It is a sapphire mining area. In , the locality of Anakie Siding had a population of 155 people.\nGeography\nThe town is located just to the south of the Capricorn Highway,  west of Emerald.\nThe town of Anakie is on the Central Western railway line running from Rockhampton west to Longreach.

It contains a number of unnamed peaks rising to  above sea level.\nHistory\nThe pastoral runs in the Leichhardt District were surveyed by August 1866, including Anakie Downs, Saint Helens, Emerald Downs, and Glendarriwill.  At this time, the estimated  Anakie Downs property was owned by R. Treffitt (also given as Triffit), who also owned the nearby Retreat run.  On 17 January 1870 the 'superb station property known as the St. Helens, , and Retreat runs  on the Nogoa River, Leichhardt District, in the midst of the choicest and most remunerative stations in North Queensland', together with 10000 sheep, was sold by public auction to R. F. Greene for £2750.  The property was sold again by February 1880.\nA railway line west from Emerald Downs was considered for the area by the chief engineer for the Railway Department in 1878, but difficulties encountered with mountain ranges further to the west.  This line 'beyond Emerald Downs first passes through the good country known as  Downs' was still unresolved by March 1878.  A  rail siding had been added to the new line by November 1884.\nAnakie Provisional School was opened 27 July 1885. On 1 January 1909, it became Anakie State School. It had occasional closures due to low student numbers.\nAnakie Post Office opened on 12 March 1894 (a receiving office had been open since 1885).\nTaraborah Provisional School opened in 1900.

The name is also written as Taroborah State School.\nBy September 1902, the area was becoming known for sapphire mines, the nearest on Retreat Creek,  from the Anakie railway station.  With granitic rock masses and adjoining metamorphic rocks including gneiss, with hornblende, some epidote, some ruby, and garnet, zircons were also found.  The quality of the blue, red, and yellow sapphires was noted.\nAnakie was one of three towns within the locality of The Gemfields (the others being Sapphire and Rubyvale) until 17 April 2020, when the Queensland Government decided to replace The Gemfields with three new localities (Anakie Siding, Sapphire Central and Rubyvale) based around each of the three towns respectively. The boundaries of the localities of Emerald and Gindie were also modified to accommodate the introduction of the locality of Anakie Siding with an area of .\nDemographics\nIn , the locality of Anakie Siding had a population of 155 people.\nTransport\nGreyhound buses run west (and return) from Rockhampton along the Capricorn Highway.\nEmerald (about  east) has an airport with regular services to Brisbane and other points.\nQueensland Rail's Spirit of the Outback train service that runs twice weekly will stop at Anakie on request.\nEducation\nAnakie State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 1 School Lane ().
