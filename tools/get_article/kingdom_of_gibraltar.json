It was added to the monarchy titles by King Henry IV of Castile, upon the addition of Gibraltar to the Crown patrimony in 1462.\nThe title of “King of Gibraltar” was kept in the titles and honours of the Spanish Crown and is no longer among the titles of the present king, Felipe VI, as only the town of Gibraltar (merely 1% of the actual Spanish Kingdom of Gibraltar) was ceded to the British Crown under Article X of the Treaty of Utrecht 1713.\nHistory\nDuring the Middle Ages, Gibraltar was part of the Moorish Taifa of Málaga in Al-Andalus. It was captured from Castile in 1333 by Abu Malik Abd al-Wahid of the Marinid dynasty. After an unsuccessful siege led by Alfonso XI of Castile during the Reconquista period, the local governor ‘Isa ibn al-Hassan proclaimed himself “King of Gibraltar and its lands” in 1355. This title remained in Muslim hands for the next century.\nGibraltar was finally recaptured by Castile on 15 December 1462 when it fell to an army led by Enrique Pérez de Guzmán y Fonseca, later 2nd Duke of Medina Sidonia, who expelled Moors from the territory. King Henry IV of Castile, the brother of the later Queen Isabella I of Castile, rewarded the Duke with the title of Marquess of Gibraltar and added the kingship of Gibraltar to the list of titles of the Castilian crown. The title can thus no longer be used by his successors as the territory was ceded to the Crown of Great Britain in perpetuity, under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713. The United Kingdom, by contrast, takes the position that the treaty transferred sovereignty as well as possession.\nWhen Gibraltar was captured by an Anglo-Dutch fleet on behalf of the Archduke Charles, claimant to the Spanish throne, in 1704, the city council and most of the population left in 1706 to found the nearby town of San Roque. The original royal warrant of 1502, which the city council took with it to San Roque along with Gibraltar’s standard and records, is now in the San Roque municipal archives. San Roque still uses a modified version of the original coat of arms of Gibraltar to symbolise its connection to Gibraltar.\nAs with the rest of the historic substantive titles pertaining to the Spanish monarchy, this title is not officially designated in the 1978 Constitution, but the constitution notes that the title of the monarch is “King of Spain” and further grants the right to use “the others pertaining to the Crown” (los demás que correspondan a la Corona). This title is not “pertaining to the crown” of Spain. The Spanish Constitution has no competence to authorise the use of foreign titles belonging to other monarchs.\nModern usage in Gibraltar\nAs the kingship of Gibraltar is no longer among the titles of the Spanish monarchy, it was customary for titles and arms of conquered territories to be omitted from British regnal claims.\nIn 2010, the government of Gibraltar issued coinage bearing the title “Queen of Gibraltar”. The title appeared on most Gibraltar and UK government documents when referencing Queen Elizabeth II in relation to Gibraltar. Following her death and the accession and proclamation of King Charles III in Gibraltar, Chief Minister Fabian Picardo has referred to him as “King of Gibraltar”. On February 4, 2024, Gibraltar announced that they would present coins bearing the royal cypher of King Charles III at the [https://www.tradefairdates.com/World-Money-Fair-M2799/Berlin.html Berlin Money Fair].\nSee also\n* List of titles and honours of the Spanish Crown\n* History of Spain\n* History of Gibraltar\nReferences"
