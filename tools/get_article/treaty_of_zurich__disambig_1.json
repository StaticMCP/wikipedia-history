The agreement was a reaffirmation of the terms of the preliminary\npeace of Villafranca, which brought the Austro-Sardinian War to an official close. The treaty actually consisted of three separate treaties &ndash; a treaty between France and Austria, which reaffirmed the terms of the preliminary peace, re-established peace between the two emperors, and ceded Lombardy to France.  A second treaty, between France and Sardinia, saw France cede Lombardy to Sardinia.  The third treaty, signed by all three powers, re-established a state of peace between Austria and Sardinia.\nIn the French-Austrian treaty, both countries agreed to work towards a confederation of Italian states, including Venice, under the honorary presidency of the Pope (art. 18), which never happened.\nSee also\n*Armistice of Villafranca\n*Treaty of Turin (1860)\n*Treaty of Vienna (1866)\n*Second Italian War of Independence\nExternal links\n*[http://www.uni-mannheim.de/mateo/camenaref/cmh/cmh402.html The Valtelline (1603-1639) - Chapter II]\n*[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/national/italy2.htm Heraldry in Pre-Unification Italy]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080415135710/http://www.hungarian-history.hu/lib/thou/thou12.htm Chapter XI - Hungarian Soldiers in Foreign Armies]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070101191853/http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555207_10/Italy.html Encarta Encyclopedia - Italy]\n*[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14078/14078-h/14078-h.htm The Project Gutenberg eBook - The Liberation of Italy by Countess Evelyn Martinengo-Cesaresco]"
