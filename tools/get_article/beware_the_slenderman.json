Benjamin Lee of The Guardian said \"Beware the Slenderman is both haunting and poignant, a sad tale of what bullying, untreated mental illness and crushing loneliness can create. It’s pre-empting a fictional horror film about Slenderman, now in production, that seems somewhat irresponsible in comparison.\" and gave it a 4/5 stars.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.hbo.com/documentaries/beware-the-slenderman Beware the Slenderman] on HBO\n*\n*"
