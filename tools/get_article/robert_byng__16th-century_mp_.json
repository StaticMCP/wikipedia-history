He was twice elected to Parliament, representing Steyning in 1555 and Abingdon in 1559. The latter seat was probably gained through the influence of his first wife's stepfather Sir John Mason.\nHe married twice. His first wife, Frances Hill, was the daughter of Richared Hill of Hartley Wintney with whom he had three sons, including his heir George Byng. His second wife was Mary Maynard, with whom he had three sons and a daughter.
