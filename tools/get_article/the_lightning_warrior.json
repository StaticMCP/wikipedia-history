It is regarded as one of the better Mascot serials. A number of the production's outdoor action sequences were filmed on the rocky Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, California, known for its huge sandstone boulders and widely recognized as the most heavily filmed outdoor shooting location in the history of the movies. Released in December 1931, this was the last movie of the original Rin Tin Tin, as he died in August 1932, being replaced that same year by Rin Tin Tin Jr.\nPlot\nThe Wolfman, a mysterious masked figure, is leading an Indian uprising to drive local settlers off their land.  The Wolfman kills Jimmy Carter's father and Alan Scott's brother, which leads the two heroes and Alan's dog Rinty to hunt down and defeat the villain.\nCast\n*Rin Tin Tin as \"Rinty\", a dog known as The Lightning Warrior to the local Indians\n*Frankie Darro as Jimmy Carter\n*George Brent as Alan Scott, government agent\n*Patrick H.
