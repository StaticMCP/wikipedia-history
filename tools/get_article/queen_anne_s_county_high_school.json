It is one of two public high schools in Queen Anne's County along with Kent Island High School.\nOverview\nThe school is located on the Eastern Shore of Maryland in the town of Centreville, MD.  The school is on Maryland Route 304, south of Maryland Route 305, east of Maryland Route 213, and west of U.S. Route 301.  The current building was built in 1966.\nThe school was created with the desegregation of the school system in 1966, twelve years after Brown vs. Board of Education was ruled.  The high school for African Americans, the Kennard School, was closed and turned into the present Kennard Elementary School.  The three White schools - Centreville High School, Sudlersville High School, and Stevensville High School - were closed and turned into middle schools.\nThe current principal is Mr. Lou Sheppard.\nStudents\n| 1993 | 1,529\n| 1994 | 1,519\n| 1995 | 1,533\n| 1996 | 1,590\n| 1997 | 1,636\n| 1998 | 1,728\n| 1999 | 1,108\n| 2000 | 959\n| 2001 | 935\n| 2002 | 912\n| 2003 | 1,021\n| 2004 | 1,060\n| 2005 | 1,094\n| 2006 | 1,175\n| 2007 | 1,225\n| 2008 | 1,199\n| 2009 | 1,240\n}}\nSports\nState Champions\n* 2024 - Women’s Soccer\n* 2021 - Women’s Lacrosse\n* 2010 - Boys' Lacrosse\n* 2009 - Swimming\n* 1978 - Baseball\nState Finalist\n* Boys' Swimming- 2014\n* Boys' Track & Field- 1985, 2012\n* Girls' Lacrosse- 2012, 2024\n*Boys' Ballet- 2010\n* Boys' Soccer- 2012\n* Ice Hockey (Co-Opp)- 2012\n* Boys' Lacrosse- 2009\n* Football- 2009\n* Girls' Soccer- 2003\nState Semi-Finalist\n* Girls' Lacrosse- 2007, 09, 10, 13, 14\n* Field Hockey- 2011, 2023, 2024\n* Boys' Lacrosse-1999, 2011\n* Girls' Lacrosse-2011\n* Football-2004, 08, 10\n* Boys' Soccer- 1974, 1975, 2005, 06, 2023\n* Girls' Soccer- 2004\n* Boys' Lacrosse-1999, 2000\n* Unisex Badminton-1966\nState Quarter-Finalist\n* Football- 1985, 1999\nBayside Champions\n* soccer -1996\nSee also\n*List of high schools in Maryland\n*Queen Anne's County Public Schools\nReferences and notes\nhttp://qacps.schoolwires.net/qhs , https://web.archive.org/web/20140512144253/http://qacps.schoolwires.net/Domain/123\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080310235231/http://www.qacps.k12.md.us/qhs/ Queen Anne's County High School website]\n*[https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=centreville,+md&ie=UTF8&ll=39.037686,-76.050668&spn=0.011217,0.020084&t=h&z=16 Map of School from Google Maps]"
