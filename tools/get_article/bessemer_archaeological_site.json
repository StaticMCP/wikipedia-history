The site was first excavated in 1977 prior to the construction of Virginia Route 220 through the area, and again in 1987 when the roadway was widened.  It included pit hearths, evidence of a large (20 meter by 6 meter) rectangular building, stone tools, and pottery sherds.  Human burial sites were also identified, as was the location of portions of a palisade that probably surrounded the settlement.\nThe site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Botetourt County, Virginia\nReferences"
