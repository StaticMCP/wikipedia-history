The idea being an attempt at reconciliation of the thought itself when the reality is an insatiable quest that ultimately transforms the protagonist entirely from something quite innocent and pure into a more sinister, powerful self through recognition of this transformation\".\nIn March 2017, Kingswood released their second album After Hours, Close to Dawn, which peaked at number 10 on the ARIA Charts.
