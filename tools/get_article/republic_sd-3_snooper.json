It was evaluated by the Army Signal Corps in 1959, but did not enter operational service.\nDesign and development\nThe Guided Missiles Division of Republic Aviation was awarded a contract for development of a short-range reconnaissance drone in 1957, winning a competition conducted by the U.S. Army to fill the requirement. Given the overall designation AN/USD-3 for the entire system, and sometimes referred to as Sky Spy, the Snooper was of twin-boom configuration, a single Continental IO-200 horizontally-opposed piston engine being mounted in a pusher configuration. The drone was capable of flying for up to 30 minutes, allowing it to overfly multiple reconnaissance targets during a single flight.\nLaunch was from a zero-length launch setup, two rocket boosters burning solid fuel being used to assist the aircraft into flight; following a mission, which could either use autopilot control following a programmed course or radio command guidance from a ground station, the Snooper would land via parachute; airbags were installed in the airframe to cushion the landing. The SD-3's nose section was designed to be interchangeable among a number of payloads; options included television, aerial photography, infrared photography, or radar systems.\nOperational history\nRevealed to the press in late 1958, the SD-3 first flew in January 1959; following manufacturer's trials, the U.S. Army ordered fifty pre-production aircraft to conduct a full evaluation of the system. Although the trials, conducted by the Signal Corps, were considered successful, the Army cancelled the SD-3 program at the end of the trials. However, the SD-3's twin-boom pusher design would become commonly used by unmanned aerial vehicles in later years.\nSpecifications\nSee also\n|related=\n|similar aircraft=\n* Aerojet SD-2 Overseer\n* Radioplane MQM-57 Falconer\n* Beechcraft MQM-61 Cardinal\n|lists=\n* List of military aircraft of the United States\n*List of military electronics of the United States\n* List of unmanned aerial vehicles\n}}\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*"
