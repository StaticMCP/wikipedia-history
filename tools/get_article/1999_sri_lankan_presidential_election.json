This was the 4th Presidential election held in the country's history, and the Nominations were accepted on 16 November 1999. Incumbent President Chandrika Kumaratunga of the governing People's Alliance was re-elected for a second term, defeating the United National Party's Ranil Wickremesinghe, receiving 51% of the vote. This was Wikcremesinghe's first of the three unsuccessful bids for the Presidency.\nBackground\nChandrika Kumaratunga assumed office of the President on 12 November 1994, after winning that year's Presidential election. Under the Provisions of the Constitution, the president is elected to a six-year term and the president can call for an early presidential election after completing four years of his first term. President Kumaratunga decided to call an Early Presidential election as she was constitutionally eligible to do so, since her four years of her first term was completed on 12 November 1998. Her announced the Proclamation by the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1102/22 on 20 October 1999.\nNominations were accepted from 9.00am to 11.00am IST, on 16 November 1999, and the Date of the election scheduled for 21 December, was announced by the Gazette Extraordinary No.531/12, on the same day.\nKumaratunga declared her intentions to run for a second term, and campaigned to continue her actions against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, while her main opponent Ranil Wickremasinghe called for the commencement of direct negotiations with the Tigers.\nDuring the campaign, the UNP proposed holding a live presidential debate between its candidate Ranil Wickremesinghe and President Kumaratunga, but she did not agree to participate, and the debate ultimately did not take place.\nThree days before the election, on December 18, 1999, Kumaratunga was nearly killed by an LTTE assassination attempt at her final rally. She lost her right eye, and appeared heavily bandaged on television before the election.\nResults\nThe results of the Election were officially declared on 22 December 1999, with Chandrika Kumaratunga winning a second term in office. She was sworn in later that same day at the Temple trees, only hours after the announcement of the final results.\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*"
