It is part of the City University of New York (CUNY) system and the only community college in Brooklyn.\nHistory\nFounded in 1963, Kingsborough Community College serves a widely diverse population of approximately 14,000 students. The college has been identified as an Aspen Prize Top Community College seven consecutive times by the Aspen Institute College Excellence Program, finishing in the top 10 three times, most recently in 2023.\nIn 2019 Leonard Riggio, the founder and chairman of Barnes & Noble book stores, donated $1 million toward scholarships for Kingsborough students.\nAcademics\nKCC offers over 50 programs of study, including the only New York State license-approved polysomnographic technology degree program in New York City and NYC’s first and only accredited A.A.S. degree in surgical technology. It is the first college in Brooklyn with a New York State Department of Health–Bureau of Emergency Medical Services-approved paramedic curriculum. Its maritime program, replete with its own boats and dock, offers training for various careers at sea.\nCampus\nLocated in Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, the  campus overlooks Sheepshead Bay, Jamaica Bay, and the Atlantic Ocean. It is located on the site of the old Sheepshead Bay Maritime Training Center for Merchant Marines, Coast Guard and Navy and the Manhattan Beach Air Force Station.\nA working lighthouse, # 34360, sits atop the Marine Academic Center (MAC). Designed by Gruzen Samton Architects, it has flashed a white light every 4 seconds since 1990.\nThe library at Kingsborough Community College is named after former City University of New York Chancellor Robert Kibbee. The 743-seat Leon M. Goldstein Performing Arts Center at Kingsborough was named in honor of Leon M. Goldstein, who was president at the college from 1971 to 1999. Kingsborough is the only college in New York City with its own private beach, which is open for swimming during the summer.\nAthletics\nKingsborough Community College teams participate as a member of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA).
