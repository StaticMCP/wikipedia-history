It is oriented towards astronomy, not terrestrial telescopes (e.g., spyglasses).\nMany of the largest were metal mirror reflectors, some of which had substational apertures even for the 20th century. One problem was that many instrument makers. including William Herschel, did not pass on their mirror-making craft, and by the next century reflectors had largely been passed over in favour of small achromats (2-lens refractors). It was not until the 20th century that really large reflectors would predominate once again.\nThe major breakthrough in the 18th century was the perfection of two and even three lens refractor telescopes, as well as the increased number of reflectors using polished metal mirrors rather than metal-coated glass, which was not developed until the mid-19th century.\nSelected Reflectors & Refractors\nThe main telescope technologies during this period were refractors with non-achromatic objectives (single lens), speculum metal reflectors, refractors with achromatic doublets objective (doublet lens), and apochromatic triplets (after 1760s) objectives. The list is inherently limited by what examples and records have survived.\n*\n*\n*\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n! Name(s)\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Aperture cm (in)\n!
