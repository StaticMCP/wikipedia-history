As at November 2018, it appears to be without any buildings or structures (apart from the railway line). Although the town plan show streets, there is no visual evidence of those streets having been established.\nHistory\nThe town's name is derived from the railway station name, assigned by the Queensland Railways Department on 18 November 1911, as the junction name for the line to Quilpie, from the Charleville to Cunnamulla line.\nThe town is first shown on a 1913 survey plan. Queensland electoral rolls show a large number of railway construction workers living in a camp in 1913, constructing the railway line. In 1922, the electoral roll shows a small number of railway workers living there, presumably operating and maintaining the line. After that, there appears to be no permanent population.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
