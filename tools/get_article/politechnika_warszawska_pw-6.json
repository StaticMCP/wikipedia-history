It was manufactured at PZL Świdnik from 2000 and at ZS Jezow from 2007.\nDevelopment\nThe PW-6 was designed to be an ab initio trainer with the capability of providing cross-country training as well. It has handling and performance characteristics similar to the Politechnika Warszawska PW-5. In this way, it was envisaged that the transition to solo flying in the single-seater could be made sooner.\nThe prototype of the PW-6, built at the Politechnika Warszawska, PZL Świdnik and DWLKK, made its maiden flight from Bemowo Airfield, Warsaw, in July 1998. Type certification was granted in September 2000, after Jerzy Kedzierski and Maciej Lasek completed the test flights. Serial production started at PZL Swidnik soon afterwards, with first deliveries to Egypt, New Zealand, Belgium, Canada, United States, Portugal and Germany. Production at PZL Swidnik ceased after approximately 26 aircraft had been completed, but resumed at Zaklad Szybowcowy Jezow in 2007.\nDesign\n*Classical shoulder-wing, two seater, tandem layout, designed in accordance with the requirements of JAR-22 Utility Category.\n*Wing shape and profile are similar to the PW-5 design: trapezoid plan with bow-shaped ends, shoulder-set on the fuselage, having a single-spar structure with sandwich shells. Schempp-Hirth-type air brakes extend on the upper wing surface only.\n*Fuselage shell of glass-epoxy composite monocoque structure, stiffened with frames. Fabric-covered rudder.\n*Fixed undercarriage consisting of main wheel behind the rear pilot, with shock absorber and drum brake, a smaller front wheel and a tail wheel to prevent ground scraping if over rotation takes place during take off or landing.\n*Two tow releases, for aerotowing and winch-launching.\nVariants\nThe following derivatives were projected, though not built:\n*PW-7 Motorglider project: two seater side-by-side motorglider, with PW-6 wing geometry.\n*PW-9A Aerobatic Training Glider, with automatic control connections and tail ballast compartment.\n*PW-9M Self Launching Training Glider, with Solo engine and folding propeller.\nSpecifications\nSee also\nReferences\n*Ewald J, Flight Test: PW-6, Sailplane and Gliding, Feb-Mar 2001\n*[http://www.worldclasssoaring.org/ The World Class Soaring Association]"
