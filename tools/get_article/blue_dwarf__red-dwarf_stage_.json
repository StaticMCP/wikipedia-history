Because red dwarfs fuse their hydrogen slowly and are fully convective (allowing their entire hydrogen supply to be fused, instead of merely that in the core), they are predicted to have lifespans of trillions of years; the Universe is currently not old enough for any blue dwarfs to have formed yet. Their future existence is predicted based on theoretical models.\nHypothetical scenario\nStars increase in core power and pressure as they age, creating a power excess, which means they will find a way to get brighter. For stars more massive than red dwarfs, their opaque atmosphere means the star has to get bigger to become more luminous. However, it is predicted that red dwarfs with less than  have clearer atmospheres. Thus they can increase luminosity simply by getting hotter, and as a result, more blue.\nDespite their name, blue dwarfs would not necessarily increase in temperature enough to become blue stars. Simulations have been conducted on the future evolution of red dwarfs with stellar mass between 0.06&nbsp; and 0.25&nbsp;.\nOf the masses simulated, the bluest of the blue dwarf stars at the end of the simulation had begun as a 0.14&nbsp; red dwarf, and ended with surface temperature approximately , making it a type&nbsp;A blue-white star.\nEnd of stellar life\nBlue dwarfs are believed to eventually completely exhaust their store of hydrogen fuel, and their interior pressures are insufficient to fuse any other fuel. Once fusion ends, they are no longer main-sequence \"dwarf\" stars and become so-called white dwarfs – which, despite the name, are not main-sequence \"dwarfs\" and are not stars, but rather stellar remnants.\nOnce the former \"blue\"-dwarf stars have become degenerate, non-stellar white dwarfs, they cool, losing the remnant heat left over from their final hydrogen-fusing stage. The cooling process also requires enormous periods of time – much longer than the age of the universe at present – similar to the immense time previously required for them to change from their original red dwarf stage to their final blue dwarf stage. The stellar remnant white dwarf will eventually cool to become a black dwarf. (The universe is not old enough for any stellar remnants to have cooled to \"black\", so black dwarfs are also a well-founded, but still hypothetical object.)\nIt is also theoretically possible for these dwarfs at any stage of their lives to merge and become larger stars, such as helium stars. Such stars should ultimately also become white dwarfs, which like the others, will cool down to black dwarfs.\nSee also\n*Lists of stars\n*\nReferences\n}}"
