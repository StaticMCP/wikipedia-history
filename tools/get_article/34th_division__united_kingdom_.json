The division was raised from volunteers for Lord Kitchener's New Armies, originally made up of infantry battalions raised by public subscription or private patronage. The division was taken over by the War Office in September 1915. It served in France and Belgium in the trenches of the Western Front for the duration of the war.\nUnit history\ncrossing the River Lys at Halluin in captured German pontoons, 18 October 1918.]]\nThe 34th Division was one of the six created for the Fourth New Army on 10 December 1914. The division was originally made up of Pals battalions, and two brigades of the Northumberland Fusiliers; the Tyneside Scottish and Tyneside Irish. Major-General Edward Ingouville-Williams, an experienced commander who had led a brigade in action with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), took command of the division in June 1915.\nThe division landed in France in January 1916.
