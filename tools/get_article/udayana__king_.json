He is a popular figure in Indian literature, for both his romantic and military stories, but though he probably existed, little is known for certain about his life or reign.\nAccording to Buddhist sources, the Buddha visited Kauśāmbī several times during the reign of Udayana on his effort to spread the dharma, the Noble Eightfold Path and the Four Noble Truths. Udayana was an upasaka (lay follower) of Buddha. The Chinese translation of the Buddhist canonical text  states that the first image of Buddha, carved out of sandalwood, was made under the instruction of Udayana.\nLife\nUdayana, the son of Śatānīka II by the Videha princess succeeded him.\nNiti Adaval mentions about Udayana and his love for music, art and fondness of women. Due to a dohada (\"pregnancy craving\"), Mṛgāvatī, pregnant with Udayana, is either covered or immersed in red. A monstrous bird mistakes her for raw meat and carries her away, later dropping her. She is cared for in a hermitage, where she raises her son. Udayana obtains a wonderful lute, elephant taming skills, and confidants; he and his mother eventually return to their home, Kauśāmbī.\nUdayana is later captured by Pradyota, the King of Ujjayinī. Here, he teaches the lute to Pradyota's daughter, Vāsavadattā, and they fall in love. Eventually they escape to Kauśāmbī, where Udayana's rightful kingship is restored, and they are married. But fearing Udayana is getting soft, and desiring an additional political alliance, Udayana's ministers make him believe that Vāsavadattā is dead, and get him married to Padmāvati.\nThough he is later reunited with Vāsavadattā, Udayana remains childless from both of his wives. Later, as a boon of Kubera or Lord Shiva per other sources, Vāsavadattā becomes pregnant with Naravāhanadatta (his name means \"given by Kubera\"), who is fated to become the emperor of the vidyādharas.\nAccording to the Puranas, the 4 successors of Udayana were , , Niramitra and .\nAccounts\nUdayana, the romantic hero of the , the Vina-Vasavadatta, the  and many other legends was a contemporary of Buddha and of Pradyota, the king of Avanti.
