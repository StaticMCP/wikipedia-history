One of these supplements was The Fourth Succession War Military Atlas Volume 1, designed by Sam Lewis, James Long, Michael Lee, Blaine Pardoe and Boy Petersen, with illustrations by Roger Loveless and John Marcus, and cover art by Jim Holloway.  It was released by FASA in 1988.\nFASA published Volume 2 of this set the following year.\nReception\nIn Issue 6 of the British game magazine Games International, Jake Thornton expressed disappointment in this product, saying, \"Sadly the whole book smacks of being written to a rather unimaginative formula. Unless you really don't have the time, or you simply must have everything FASA produce, I wouldn't recommend you buy it.\" Thornton concluded by giving this book a very poor rating of only 1 out of 5 for role-playing gamers, and 3 out of 5 for wargamers, and stated that\nIn Issue 51 of the French games magazine Casus Belli, Pierre Lejoyeux noted that \"Each battle is presented and analyzed with many color shots and with the same rigor and seriousness that would be appropriate for a 'professional' on the Second World War.\"\nReferences"
