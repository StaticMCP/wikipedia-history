The Swedes had 15,100 soldiers and were led by Gustavus Adolphus, while the Imperialists had 16,200 soldiers and were led by Field-Marshal Count Tilly. Tilly's troops attacked Gustavus' entrenchments in front of Werben (Elbe), but Swedish batteries and the cavalry under Wolf Heinrich von Baudissin forced them to retreat, at the cost of 6,000 Imperials and 200 Swedes.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*George Bruce.
