Based on the nonfiction book ''The Operators: The Wild and Terrifying Inside Story of America's War in Afghanistan'' by Michael Hastings, it is a fictionalized version of the events in the book based on United States Army General Stanley McChrystal.\nThe film was released on Netflix on May 26, 2017.\nPlot\nIn the summer of 2009, four-star General Glen McMahon, having won renown for his effective leadership in Iraq, is sent to Afghanistan to prepare a strategic assessment so the government can end the ongoing war. He is given wide latitude to write it, on the sole condition that he not request more troops.\nMcMahon and his staff, including right hand man Major General Greg Pulver, unanimously believe the war can be won, and recommend that President Obama authorize a surge of 40,000 troops to secure Helmand province to stabilize the country. The Secretary of State informs McMahon that such a surge is unfeasible politically and the report won't be reviewed until after Afghanistan's presidential election.\nCaptain Badi Basim of the Afghan National Army joins McMahon's staff as a liaison. He arrives in civilian clothes as his uniform increases the risk he'll be killed. McMahon learns that massive voter fraud in the recent election has forced a runoff election, further delaying the review of his assessment. Fed up, McMahon secretly leaks the report to The Washington Post and reveals in an interview with 60 Minutes that he's only met once with President Obama in the preceding 70 days.\nObama responds by sending 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan, with a pledge that U.S. and coalition forces will fully withdraw in 18 months. McMahon and his staff are furious that America's Afghan strategy has been telegraphed to their Taliban enemies. To make up the shortfall of 10,000 troops needed for McMahon's plan, he takes his staff to Paris to negotiate with other coalition nations, where he learns the President is in Denmark and wishes to meet. The ambassador to Afghanistan cautions McMahon that if he continues to anger the President, he'll be fired for insubordination, and the President ends up brushing off their meeting. When McMahon attends a dinner in his honor, Rolling Stone writer Sean Cullen reveals his intention to write a feature story about McMahon. On their wedding anniversary McMahon's wife Jeanie confronts him about neglecting his family through his long absences overseas.\nEn route to Berlin with McMahon's staff to continue negotiations, Cullen concludes they are arrogant, care little about growing public perception that the war is costly and unwinnable, and hold their civilian leadership in contempt. McMahon is confronted by a German official who criticizes the war and McMahon's strategy but the Germans and the French agree to furnish troops for McMahon's planned offensive, codenamed \"Operation Moshtarak\", which Afghan President Hamid Karzai has approved. Several civilians are accidentally killed when the operation launches. McMahon holds a public meeting to apologize to local citizens and explain the U.S. is fighting for their benefit. The crowd remains hostile and McMahon is asked to leave. McMahon discovers Cullen's article, now published, paints a negative picture of him and his staff defying the President and mishandling the war effort. When Obama calls McMahon to Washington, McMahon takes a job as a civilian consultant in anticipation of his firing. Cullen ponders the consequences of his article, having hoped McMahon's fall would convince the government to stop invading foreign countries and end the war in Afghanistan.\nA new general is appointed by the government to replace McMahon and continue the war.\nCast\n'''McMahon's Entourage'''\n* Brad Pitt as General Glen McMahon, a character based on General Stanley McChrystal.

And Brad Pitt's performance, sadly, belongs in a different film entirely.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=TsZN7Y0H5VAC The Operators] by Michael Hastings at Google Books"
