In early January, severe rainfall caused widespread floods across North West England and the East Midlands.\nJanuary\nNorth West (1 January)\nAround  of rainfall in 24 hours brought floods to parts of England and Wales on New Year's Day, prompting the Met Office to issue severe weather warnings; this led to 137 flood warnings being issued by the Environment Agency (EA) across England, Scotland and Wales, with extensive flooding affecting parts of North West England, especially Greater Manchester. A major incident was declared by Greater Manchester Police in response to flooding across Bolton, Didsbury, Harpurhey, Stalybridge, Stockport and Wigan, as well as parts of Cheshire and Lancashire.\nGreater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service reported that they had attended over 100 incidents and evacuated almost 1,000 people as a result of the floods: 400 from flats at Meadow Mill in Stockport after they lost electricity and water supplies; 445 from a hotel in Didsbury after power and water supplies were cut off; around 50 other properties in Didsbury; and some evacuations in Platt Bridge. City centre canals overflowed and the River Tame and River Mersey reached record highs in places; the latter meant sluice gates had to be opened at Fletcher Moss Park where a car was submerged. Around 100 people attending a New Year's Eve event were stranded in Harpurhey. Floods also occurred in Cheadle, where a tributary of the Mersey flooded roads and homes, and Broadbottom, where a wall collapsed onto cars and homes were flooded. Three people were rescued from a car submerged in floodwater in Warrington.\nFlooding also occurred in Cheshire, Lancashire, Merseyside and Yorkshire. Part of the Bridgewater Canal's embankment collapsed near Little Bollington, causing water to pour out and inundate surrounding fields; Cheshire Police had to evacuate properties, a sewage treatment works was flooded and part of the M56 motorway was closed between Manchester Airport and Bowdon. The Sankey Canal in St Helens burst its banks, submerging cars and houses in Haydock in several feet of water. Flooding also occurred in Lymm, where three people were rescued from a car, Ormskirk, where homes were flooded, and Ribchester, where a brook burst its banks and flooded houses. The M57 motorway was closed between Kirkby to Aintree due to flooding. The River Ure burst its banks near Wensley, North Yorkshire, flooding the A684 road and surrounding fields.\nNumerous train lines were blocked by floodwater leading to cancellations across the North West. Trains did not operate between Manchester and Manchester Airport and Liverpool Lime Street, or from both Liverpool and Manchester to Huddersfield, Leeds and York. The line between Manchester Piccadilly and Warrington Central was blocked, as was the line between Todmorden and Rochdale.\nSouth East (5-6 January)\nOn 5 January, flooding affected areas of South East England, namely Sussex, as the region was hit by heavy rain; flood warnings were issued for parts of the Adur, Bull, Cuckmere and Ouse rivers. Areas affected by floods included Barcombe, Hellingly, Isfield and Littlehampton. A number of rail services were affected, with floods hitting Frant railway station and the line between Arundel and Billingshurst.\nFlooding continued into the next day as a yellow rain warning covered the region, with further flood warnings issued by the EA. Fields near Barcombe Mills were inundated by floodwater from the River Ouse; there was disruption on the A29 road at Pulborough as floods affected gardens and properties in the town.\nEast Midlands (6 January)\nHeavy rainfall on 6 January led to floods across the East Midlands, with the EA issuing almost 200 flood warnings. A major incident was declared in response to the floods in Leicestershire and Rutland; this was followed by the Lincolnshire Resilience Forum (LRF), who coordinate emergency services in the county, also declaring a major incident in Lincolnshire.\nNorth Yorkshire Police found the body of a man in floodwaters in Beal, North Yorkshire, and said they believe he entered the water within the previous two days. Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service said it had received over 200 calls and 59 people had been rescued from flooded areas; Leicestershire Police said it had also received a high number of calls and reported that the worst hit areas were Melton Mowbray, Rutland and South Leicestershire. A rare severe flood warning, which indicates a danger to life, was issued for part of the River Soar in Barrow-upon-Soar: the EA said rising water levels at the Pilings Lock put properties at a nearby caravan park and marina at risk. In Lincolnshire, 50 schoolchildren were rescued from Edenham Primary School after all surrounding roads were flooded. The LRF said that a further 16 people had been rescued from flooded properties in Billingborough whilst 97 properties in the county suffered internal flooding. Lincolnshire Police said the south of the county was most impacted, whilst the LRF reported 16 major roads in the county were closed, including part of the A1 and A15. Elsewhere in the country, part of the M5 motorway was closed following flooding near Gloucester and rail lines were blocked.\nJune\nOn 13 June, thunderstorms led to heavy rainfall in Kent which caused flash flooding in some areas. East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust advised patients to stay away from Buckland Hospital after it was hit by flooding, whilst 21 people in Dover were moved to temporary accommodation. In Guston, 120 students were evacuated from the Duke of York's Royal Military School after their dormitory was flooded.\nJuly\nOn 17 July, trials in six courtrooms at the Old Bailey were forced to move after floodwater started to pour down the walls, with one witness describing it as \"like the Titanic\" as water lapped in the corridors. Heavy rainfall in Cumbria on 19 July led to an animal shelter in Wetheral flooding, forcing dozens of cats and dogs to be moved; a fundraising campaign had raised over £12,500 by the following day.\nOn 20 July, some weather stations in Northern Ireland recorded their wettest July day on record amid an amber weather warning for rain. The M12 motorway was closed after it partially flooded and a number of roads in Enniskillen were impassable due to floodwater. A number of properties were flooded and a rock climbing centre estimated damage would cost over £20,000.

A number of schools were closed due to flooding and rail services were disrupted between Norwich and Wymondham due to water on the tracks. Power outages were reported in Long Stratton and the area north of Aylsham, with villages including Alby, Antingham and Erpingham affected.
