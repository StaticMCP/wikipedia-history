Demands for improving the tax system were put forward.]]\nThe Niš rebellion (; ) was a short-lived Christian uprising (5–26 April 1841) that broke out in the Ottoman nahiya (sub-districts) of Niš, Pirot, Vranje and Toplica, today in Serbia. At that time, it was known as the Bulgarian revolt. In Serbian historiography it is regarded as a Serbian revolt, while in Bulgarian historiography as a Bulgarian rebellion.\nRebellion and suppression\nThe rebellion was led by Miloje Jovanović and Nikoča Srndaković Srndak. It was rapid, large and forceful, relatively unexpected by the Ottomans with initial combat successes. Ali Riza, a special commissioner sent to negotiate with the rebels, in a report sent to Istanbul, referred to the Bulgarians who dared intending to achieve supposed independence like that of the Serbs. During the rebellion, the Ottomans burnt down 225 villages.\nAftermath\nAfter the suppression of the rebellion, protests against Ottoman rule continued until September 1842. Around 10,000 people fled to the Principality of Serbia and the Ottoman government appealed for their return. As a result, Miloš Obrenović I of Serbia took a hand in arranging it. Jérôme-Adolphe Blanqui wrote Voyage en Bulgarie (Voyage in Bulgaria), a report of a mission given by French authorities to investigate the real causes of the Niš revolt.\nNotes\nSee also\n* Battle of Čegar\n* Niš conspiracy (1821)\n* Bulgarians in Serbia\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*Недељковић, С. \"Учешће Арбанаса у гушењу Нишке буне 1841. године.
