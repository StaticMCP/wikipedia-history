It was Lulu's first release of new material since 1982.\nHistory\nThe title track was a hit in Europe, reaching No. 11 on the UK Singles Chart, and peaked at No. 3 on the US dance charts. It is described by reviewer Jose F. Promis as \"...housey and anthem-like...(and) stands as one of the better dance-pop songs of the decade.\"  The album only briefly charted in the UK Albums Chart, peaking at No. 67.\nRolling Stone gave the album three stars, describing it as \"a classy, good-hearted effort.\"  Spin magazine recommended the album, describing Lulu as having assumed \"the mantle of soul survivor, achieving (Lisa) Stansfield status on the title track.\"  Jose F. Promis, in reviewing the album for AllMusic, stated that \"This isn't a bad album, by any means; it just could have been better.\"\nThree of the tracks are covers—\"How 'Bout Us\" was a 1981 international hit for US R&B band Champaign, \"I'm Back for More\" was originally recorded by Marlena Shaw and a 1980 duet version recorded by Al Johnson and Jean Carne, and \"Rhythm of Romance\" was previously recorded by Sheena Easton and Glen Goldsmith. \"Let Me Wake Up in Your Arms\" was produced by Lulu's ex-husband Maurice Gibb with his brother Barry Gibb. \"Restless Moods\" was later recorded by its co-writer Ruby Turner.\nTrack listing\n#\"Independence\" (Winston Sela, Leon Ware) 4:16\n#\"There Has Got to Be a Way\" (Sami McKinney, Kenny Moore, Allee Willis) 4:22\n#\"Restless Moods\" (Wayne Brown, Ruby Turner) 4:27\n#\"I'm Back for More\" featuring Bobby Womack (Ken Stover) 5:06\n#\"How 'Bout Us\" (Dana Walden;  Producer; Nick Martinelli  4:52\n#\"Until I Get Over You\" (Simon Climie, Rob Fisher, Dennis Morgan) 3:28\n#\"Let Me Wake Up in Your Arms\" (Barry Gibb, Maurice Gibb, Robin Gibb) 4:30\n#\"You Left Me Lonely\" (Errol Henry) 4:42\n#\"Rhythm of Romance\" (Kerry Chater, Michael Jay)  4:17\n#\"I'm Walking Away\" (Steve DuBerry, Lulu)  4:55\n#\"A Place to Fall\" (Chuck Jones) 3:29\n#\"Let Me Wake Up in Your Arms (Romantic Reprise)\" remix by Frankie Knuckles\nProduction and personnel\n*Tracks 3, 4, 8, 10 and 11 produced by Errol Henry.
