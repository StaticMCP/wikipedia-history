The first theatre of the war was an invasion of Portugal by Spain in alliance with France against the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance, which ended in disaster after three defeated invasion attempts. The second theatre was a Spanish invasion of Portuguese colonies in South America, which ended in stalemate.\nBecause no major battles were fought, even though there were numerous movements of troops and heavy losses among the Spanish invaders, this theatre of the Seven Years' War is known in Portuguese historiography as the Fantastic War (Portuguese and Spanish: Guerra Fantástica).\nThe war ended along with the Seven Years' War in the 1763 Treaty of Paris.\nBackground\nWhen the Seven Years' War between France and Great Britain started in 1754, Spain and Portugal remained neutral, their differences in South America having been settled by the Treaty of Madrid of 1750. Ricardo Wall, prime minister to King Ferdinand VI of Spain, was opposed to the pro-French party at court who wanted to enter the war on the side of France.\nAll this changed when Ferdinand died in 1759 and was succeeded by his younger half-brother Charles III. The more ambitious Charles was motivated to preserve Spain's prestige as a European and colonial power. By 1761 France looked to be losing the war against Great Britain. Fearing a British victory over France, Charles signed the Family Compact with France (both countries were ruled by branches of the House of Bourbon) in August, and claimed compensation for attacks by English privateers in Spanish waters. This brought war with Great Britain in January 1762. Portugal had been weakened by the disastrous 1755 Lisbon earthquake, leading Prime Minister Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal, to direct all efforts towards the reconstruction of the country and neglected the armed forces, in which he had little interest. A new treaty between Spain and Portugal, the Treaty of El Pardo of 1761, rendered the Treaty of Madrid null and void.\nWar\nSpain agreed with France to attack Portugal, which had been neutral, but served as an important economic ally of Great Britain. France hoped that this new front would draw away British forces, now directed against France.\nThe third Franco-Spanish invasion of Portugal in Europe (main theatre of the war, which absorbed much of the Spanish war effort), on 5 May 1762, was followed by a Spanish invasion of Portuguese territories in South America (a secondary theatre of the war). While the first ended in humiliating defeat, the second represented a stalemate: Portuguese victory in northern and western Brazil; Spanish victory in southern Brazil and Uruguay.\nPeninsular theatre\n, drawing by Lord George Townshend, 1763]]\nDuring the war, a Franco-Spanish army of about 42,000 men, first led by Nicolás de Carvajal, Marquis of Sarria and then by Pedro Pablo Abarca de Bolea, 10th Count of Aranda, invaded Portugal in 1762, in three different regions at three different times: provinces of Trás-os-Montes (May–June 1762), province of Beira (July–November 1762) and Alentejo (November 1762). They were faced by ferocious popular resistance and, from the middle of the second invasion onwards, by an Anglo-Portuguese army of nearly 15,000 men commanded by William, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe.\nIn the first invasion, the Spanish&nbsp;– whose final goal was Porto, the second city of the kingdom – occupied without opposition several undefended towns and ruined fortresses of the Trás-os-Montes Province; there were neither regular soldiers nor gunpowder in the entire province, except in the fortress of Miranda do Douro. However, guerrillas exploited the mountainous nature of the province to cut off the invaders' supply and communication lines with Spain as well as to inflict heavy losses. The Portuguese abandoned their villages, inducing famine among the Spaniards, who launched two offensives towards Porto: the first was defeated by the militia and peasants at the Battle of Douro and the second was beaten off at the mountains of Montalegre. This failure and the arrival of Portuguese reinforcements (including regular troops) forced the now diminished Spanish army to retreat into Spain, abandoning all their conquests (except Chaves). After this defeat, the Franco-Spanish commander, Sarria, was replaced by the Count of Aranda.\nDuring this first invasion of Portugal, the total Spanish casualties, according to a contemporaneous French source, Charles François Dumouriez, were 10,000 men: prisoners, deserters or deaths by hunger, guerrilla ambushes and disease (8,000 according to modern Spanish military historian José Luis Terrón Ponce).\nAt the request of Portugal, one British force of 7,107 soldiers and officers landed in Lisbon, deeply reorganizing the Portuguese army (7 to 8,000 regular soldiers). The supreme command of the allied army (from 14 to 15,000 men) was delivered to one of the best soldiers of his time: the Count of Lippe.\nIn the beginning of the second invasion (province of Lower Beira, July–November 1762), the Franco-Spaniards captured several poorly equipped Portuguese fortresses and towns, including Almeida. However, the Anglo-Portuguese army defeated a Spanish corps which was preparing another invasion through the province of Alentejo at the Battle of Valencia de Alcántara, and foiled the Spanish attempt to cross the river Tagus, defeating them at Vila Velha.\nThe allied army eventually stopped the Bourbon army's march toward Lisbon in the mountains near Abrantes (which by its position dominated the country) and used a scorched earth strategy – in cooperation with the rural population – to starve the invaders: peasants abandoned their villages, destroying or taking with them all the food, while the guerrillas attacked their logistic lines. The invaders had to choose between stay and starve or withdraw.\nThe outcome was the destruction of the Franco-Spanish army, whose remnants&nbsp;– leaving their wounded and sick behind – were chased to Spain by the Anglo-Portuguese army and peasants, after two encirclement movements undertaken by a Portuguese force under General George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend toward the enemy's rear: the first move forced the Bourbons to withdraw from the hills east of Abrantes to Castelo Branco, while the second made them flee to Spain. The Spanish headquarters (Castelo Branco), was captured by the allied army, which took thousands of prisoners (2 November 1762).\nThe total Franco-Spanish losses in this second invasion were evaluated by a contemporaneous Bourbon source as 15,000 men (Charles François Dumouriez in 1766), while the total casualties for both the invasions were about 30,000 men, according to the British minister in Portugal, Edward Hay (8 November 1762).\nAs explained by historians Danley Mark and Patrick Speelman:\nDuring the third Spanish offensive (November 1762), the Spaniards attacked by surprise two Portuguese towns (Ouguela and Marvão) – but were defeated - and had to retreat again before the reinforced and advancing Anglo-Portuguese army, which took some prisoners. Additional Spanish prisoners were taken when a Portuguese force led by British Colonel Wrey entered Spain and attacked the region of Codicera on 19 November.\nThus, Aranda, with his forces ruined and demoralized, sent to Lippe an emissary proposing an armistice on 24 November, which was accepted and signed on 1 December 1762.\nSouth American theatre\nRiver Plate\nIn South America, the Spanish Cevallos expedition (3,900 men) was more successful. In present-day Uruguay, they captured Colónia do Sacramento (with 767 defenders) and two other fortresses: fort of Santa Teresa (with 400 defenders), on 19 April 1763; and fort of San Miguel (with 30 defenders), in 23 April.\nSouthern Brazil\nCevallos advanced and won a still greater victory when he conquered most of the vast and rich territory of the so-called \"Continente de São Pedro do Rio Grande do Sul\" – the present-day Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, where the Portuguese had only up to 1,000 men (soldiers and militia). São José do Norte and the capital&nbsp;– S. Pedro do Sul- were abandoned without a fight. However, the Spaniards were routed by the Portuguese in the Battle of Santa Bárbara (1 January 1763), when an invading army of 500 Spaniards and 2,000 Indians, in cooperation with Cevallos, tried to conquer Rio Pardo, nearly the only remaining Portuguese territory in Rio Grande do Sul: seven cannons, 9,000 head of cattle and 5,000 horses were captured.\nThis huge territory would be completely retaken by the Portuguese during the so-called \"deaf war\" (1763–1777).\nMato Grosso\nA Spanish army of 600 or 1,200 men (according to the sources) tried to retake the territory of Mato Grosso, in the right bank of the Guaporé River, besieging the fortress of Conceição (the \"door\" for the gold-rich Province of Mato Grosso). The 100 defenders, after receiving reinforcements, not only resisted but conquered and occupied&nbsp;– until the end of the war&nbsp;– the reductions of San Miguel and San Martin, which were main sources of Spanish supply and were located on the left bank of the river Guaporé, the Spanish side. They also engaged in biological warfare. The Spaniards withdrew&nbsp;– after losing half of their men from hunger, disease and desertion&nbsp;– leaving the Portuguese in the possession of the disputed territory. Rolim Moura was rewarded with the vice-royalty of Brazil for this victory.\nAmazonia\nThe Portuguese conquered most of the valley of Rio Negro, expelling the Spaniards from S. Gabriel and S. josé de Maribatanas (1763) and building two fortresses there with the Spanish cannons.\nAftermath\nWith the signing of the Treaty of Paris, relations between Spain and Portugal were restored to the status quo ante bellum.\nEurope\nSpain was forced to return to Portugal the small cities of Almeida and Chaves on the Spanish-Portuguese frontier. All the other cities and strongholds had been retaken by Anglo-Portuguese forces during the chase of the remnants of the Franco-Spanish troops.\nSouth America\nThe Spanish-Portuguese colonial conflict during the Seven Years' War ended in a tactical stalemate, but it would represent a Portuguese strategic victory in the short run. Apart for the forts of Santa Teresa and San Miguel, the Spanish would lose to the Portuguese all the territory conquered during the war. Colonia del Sacramento was given back by the same treaty and Rio Grande do Sul would be retaken from the Spanish Army during the undeclared war of 1763–1777 and Portugal retained all its conquests (Rio Negro Valley and Guaporé River's right bank/Mato Grosso).\nReferences\nCitations\nWorks cited\n* Arenas, Mar García.
