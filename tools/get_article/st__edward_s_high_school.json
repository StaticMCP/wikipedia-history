The high school was known for offering high quality college preparatory education and for its campus situated on a hill overlooking the city. The campus's most prominent landmark is the recognizable neo-gothic Main Building.\nHistory (1872 - 1967)\nIn 1872, Father Edward Sorin, C.S.C., arrived in Austin to investigate the possibility of building a secondary educational institution. In 1872, Father Sorin bought one hundred and twenty-three acres from Mrs. Mary Doyle, a parishioner of St. Mary's Church. Later Mrs. Doyle donated an additional three hundred and ninety-four acres to Fr. Sorin for the purpose of establishing a high school-college.\nSt. Edward's High School opened in 1878, on the site of the present Internal Revenue Service building and was known as St. Edward's Academy.\nIn 1881 St. Edward's first boarding student moved onto the campus. Two day students enrolled. St. Edward's Academy became a six year high school offering a classical course and a commercial course. Meeting the requirements of the State of Texas, the Academy was officially chartered, in 1885, for a 50 year term.\nFather Peter J. Hurth, C.S.C., determined to build a physical plant to satisfy the needs of the growing enrollment. In 1885 the Main Building was completed.\nOn April 9, 1903, the building burned to the ground. Within two days plans had been drawn up to rebuild the structure. The specifications called for a central portion of 107 feet by 50 feet.\nDuring this time the school was known as St. Edward's College, although it was really a high school. Under Fr. Matthew Schumacher, St. Edward's defined clearly the collegiate and high school departments. Initially the high school did not have its own principal - the president held that title - nor did it have a separate faculty. At that time it was referred to as the “prep department.” Still it possessed a real identity which had been lacking before.\n1900s\nIn 1921 college-level courses were added to the curriculum. In 1924 and 1925, the institution became known as St. Edward's High School and received accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. Membership in this organization would elude the college for many years. Also in 1924 and 1925 St. Edward's received its University charter from the Texas State Department of Education and from the Texas Association of Colleges.\nBetween 1925 and 1958 St. Edward's High School and St. Edward's University were co-located. Both the high school and university administrations were located in the Gothic-styled Main Building. From 1958 until 1967 the two educational institutions remained co-located. The High School resided on the southeastern corner of the property. From 1958 until the school's closing in 1967, the High School and the Congregation's High School community took complete possession of the campus’ most recognizable feature - the imposing Main Building.\nDuring the First World War, and the Great Depression, St. Edward's struggled to enlarge its facilities and enrollment, although it eventually succeeded.\nIn 1931, Brother Hubert Koeppen, C.S.C., arrived on campus. For the past 36 years Br. Hubert was a familiar figure. Many alumna return to the campus to see Brother Hubert.\nPostwar\nWith the outbreak of the Second World War, the period of the 1940s saw many changes come to St. Edward's High School. Since young men enlisted in the military service, the college numbers dropped to an enrollment of 8 freshmen; and an increased high school enrollment filled the vacancy. This enabled the college not only to keep its Charter as a college but also to keep the college in existence. The college is now St. Edward's University. During this period of time the high school was used by the Texas State Guard as a training camp for high school and junior college men.\nIn 1958 Brother Peter Celestine C.S.C., came to St. Edward's as Principal and head of the boarding department. Many changes occurred during those years. The number of boarding students increased.\nCoinciding with Brother Peter's arrival, the Congregation of Holy Cross decided to form two communities, one for the University and one for the High School, with Brother Peter serving as Superior of the Congregation's High School community. Unfortunately, by spinning off the High School community, the Congregation had unwittingly planted the seed for its ultimate demise.\nThe high school closed in 1967.\nAcademic programs\n* Jr. High School (grades 6 - 8)\n* High School (grades 9 - 12) - curriculum to obtain a high school diploma\n* College Prepl (grades 9 - 12) - curriculum for college entry & advanced Mathematics and Sciences\nAthletics\nSt. Edward's participated in the Texas Catholic Interscholastic League (TCIL) in football, basketball, baseball, track & field, cross country, golf, and tennis.\nResidences\nSt. Edward's was a boarding school with students from across the state of Texas, Mexico, Central and South America\nNotable alumni\n* Ray Campi - Musician, The King of Rockabilly\nGallery\nImage:St Edwards Main Building.jpg|Main building\nImage:St Edwards main building SE.jpg|Southeast view of the main building\nImage:St Edwards historical marker.jpg|Historical marker on the main building\nImage:St Edwards Grotto.jpg|The grotto\nReferences\n* St. Edward's University: A Centennial History, William Dunn, C.S.C., pg. 171\nExternal links\n*[http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=119581854746858&v=wall/ St. Edward's HS Facebook page (By Invitation Only)]\n*[http://www.stedwards.edu/ St. Edward's University]\n*[http://www.stedwards.edu/alumni/about/chapters/highschool.html/ St. Edward's Alumni Assoc]\n*\n*[http://web.me.com/mikeoconnell1/SEHS/Reunions.html/ St. Ed's Reunions - 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017]"
