Dewey had paved the way to win the Republican presidential nomination in the primary elections, where he had beaten former Minnesota Governor Harold E. Stassen and World War II General Douglas MacArthur. In Philadelphia he was nominated on the third ballot over opposition from die-hard conservative Ohio Senator Robert A. Taft, the future \"minister of peace\" Stassen, Michigan Senator Arthur Vandenberg, and California Governor Earl Warren. In all Republican conventions since 1948, the nominee has been selected on the first ballot. Warren was nominated for vice president. The Republican ticket of Dewey and Warren went on to lose the general election to the Democratic ticket of Harry S. Truman and Alben W. Barkley.  One of the decisive factors in convening both major party conventions in Philadelphia that year was that Philadelphia was hooked up to the coaxial cable, giving the ability for two of the three then-young television networks, NBC and CBS, to telecast for the first time live gavel-to-gavel coverage along the East Coast. Only a few minutes of kinescope film have survived of these historic, live television broadcasts.\nPlatform\nThe party platform formally adopted at the convention included the following points:\n* Reduction of the public debt\n* Reduction of the inheritance tax\n* Promotion of small business through reduction of governmental intervention and regulation.\n* Labor reform\n* Elimination of unnecessary federal bureaus, and duplication of functions of necessary governmental agencies.\n* Federal aid to states for slum clearance and low-cost housing\n* Extension of Social Security benefits\n* A federal anti-lynching law\n* Federal civil rights legislation. Texas delegate Orville Bullington led a successful protest demanding southern representation on the platform panel considering the civil rights proposals.\n* Abolition of the poll tax\n* A crackdown on domestic Communism\n* Recognition of the state of Israel\n* International arms control \"on basis of reliable disciplines against bad faith\".\n* The admissions of Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico as states to the union.\nCandidates before the convention\n* Businessman Riley A. Bender of Illinois\n* Speaker of the House Joseph William Martin Jr. of Massachusetts\nFile:Thomas E.
