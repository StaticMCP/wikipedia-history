This development is part of the Victorian Government's Melbourne 2030 plan. The redevelopment will include a multi-deck car park, multi-story residential and commercial buildings and a pedestrian bridge or underground crossing linking both buildings.  The Glen Waverley Railway Station is also planned to be redeveloped.  The first stage of redevelopment, entailing preliminary roadworks is due for completion in October 2009. The Kingsway Realignment Project is jointly funded by Monash City Council, the Department of Planning and Community Development's 'Creating Better Places Program' and VicTrack.\nFestivals\nKingsway hosted Glen Waverley's inaugural Food and Wine Festival in November 2009. The festival was primarily funded through the Monash City Council having approved $80,000 in funding in 2008, and included many Kingsway retailers and Victorian wineries.  The streets surrounding Kingsway was closed off to traffic.\nAn inaugural Chinese New Year Lantern Festival was held in February 2009.\nMajor intersections\nHigh Street Road  (Metro Route 24) – City,\n|notes=\n}}\nSpringvale Road (Metro Route 40)\n|notes=\n}}\n|}\nSee also\nReferences\nSources\n* [http://www.metlinkmelbourne.com.au Metlink Melbourne]\n* [http://monash.vic.gov.au/ Monash City Council]\n* Glen Waverley Trader Association\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090614180452/http://www.monash.vic.gov.au/business/trader-groups.htm Glen Waverley Traders Association]\n* [http://www.monash.vic.gov.au/ City of Monash Website]"
