She had four siblings, Edith, Ada, Richard, and John Remer. Before becoming an actress, she worked as a governess and a swimming instructor.\nCareer\nWare debuted on stage in 1899 when she was a student at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. Along with other students, she was an extra in a production of The Little Minister.\nShe had a successful Broadway stage career making her first appearance in 1899 with Maude Adams, and by her 30s, she was playing the character parts for which she became famous. She began playing character parts in silent films in 1914 and continued into the sound era. Like Louise Closser Hale, Ware was a raven-haired woman for most of her stage career, but adopted an all-blond coif toward the late 1920s at the end of the silent era and into sound movies.\nPersonal life\nShe married actor Frederick Burt (1876-1943) in 1919.\nOn January 25, 1939, Helen Ware died of a throat infection in Carmel, California, aged 61.\nFilmography\n* Your Girl and Mine: A Woman Suffrage Play (1914)\n* The Price (1915)\n* Cross Currents (1915)\n* Secret Love (1916)\n* The Garden of Allah (1916)\n* The Haunted Pajamas (1917)\n* National Red Cross Pageant (1917) *Lost film\n* ''Thieves' Gold (1918) *Lost film\n* The Deep Purple (1920) *Undetermined/presumably lost\n* Colorado Pluck (1921)\n* Beyond the Rainbow (1922)\n* Fascination (1922) *Undetermined/presumably lost\n* Mark of the Beast (1923)\n* Soul-Fire (1925)\n* Napoleon's Barber (1928) *Lost film\n* New Year's Eve (1929) *Lost film\n* Speakeasy (1929) *Lost film, but the soundtrack survives\n* The Virginian'' (1929) as Mrs. 'Ma' Taylor\n* Half Way to Heaven (1929)\n* Slightly Scarlet (1930)\n* ''She's My Weakness (1930)\n* Abraham Lincoln (1930)\n* One Night at Susie's (1930)\n* Tol'able David (1930)\n* Command Performance (1931)\n* Party Husband (1931)\n* I Take This Woman (1931)\n* The Reckless Hour (1931)\n* The Night of June 13 (1931)\n* Flaming Gold (1932)\n* Ladies They Talk About (1933)\n* Girl Missing (1933)\n* The Keyhole (1933)\n* The Warrior's Husband (1933)\nWare on left with George Fawcett as her husband and [[Clara Bow as their daughter in Beyond the Rainbow'' 1922, Bow's first film]]\n* She Had to Say Yes (1933)\n* Morning Glory (1933)\n* Sadie McKee (1934)\n* ''That's Gratitude (1934)\n* Secret of the Chateau (1934)\n* Romance in Manhattan (1935)\n* What's the Idea?
