Roxas stated the following on his acceptance speech:Even though congratulated by DENR secretary Lito Atienza, the ousted former chairman and the leader of \"Atienza faction\" or \"Pro-Arroyo faction\", he later criticized the election, and called Drilon and his allies \"merry cabal of destabilizers\".

He also attended in December of the same year a protest against constitutional convention proposal of Arroyo.\nCampaign\nRoxas released a political ad in 2009, when he was riding in a pedicab as a passenger that is peddled by a young boy, and then Roxas takes over to peddle.
