The reviewer praised the \"simply superb\" graphics and ability to automate or manually control systems. He criticized the inadequate documentation, reporting that he needed more than ten hours to learn how to play, and lack of replay value in the historical scenarios and \"boring, ahistorical, and monotonous\" campaign. The reviewer concluded that SSI should combine its graphics and detail with ''Gary Grigsby's Pacific War''s game design.\nReferences"
