Through a series of six modules, new players (\"cadets\") are introduced first to maneuvering a small ship and firing weapons, and then to more complex systems. The cadet is then promoted to lieutenant and if the player can successfully negotiate the final module, \"The Tholian Web\", the player is deemed ready to participate in the full Star Fleet Battles game.\nThe supplement includes a 48-page rulebook, nine starship diagrams, a hex map and 54 die-cut counters.\nPublication history\nTask Force Games published Star Fleet Battles in 1979, and reviewers quickly noted its extreme complexity. Seven years later, Task Force Games published Introduction to Star Fleet Battles, written by the original game designer Stephen V. Cole, as a means of teaching new players the various layers of complexity, one layer at a time.\nReception\nIn the June–July 1986 edition of Adventurer (Issue 2), Stephen Dillon called this \"A well planned  introduction to SFB of benefit to new players and clubs wishing to taste the excitement of Star Fleet command. Introduction to SFB also serves as an excellent solo instruction module.\"\nIn the November 1986 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #83), Phil Frances recommended this for new players, saying, \"This product is a handy starter for those who didn't understand its fully-fledged big brother, or simply want to test the waters before splashing out on the system.\"\nReferences"
