Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Solomon Islands accepted the convention on June 20, 1992, making their historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As of 2023, Solomon Islands has only one World Heritage Site.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\nIn danger|outline=silver}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (province)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color: #FFE6BD\"| East Rennell\n|\n|Rennell and Bellona\n|1998\n|854; ix (natural)\n|East Rennell makes up the southern third of Rennell Island, the southernmost island in the Solomon Island group in the western Pacific. Rennell, 86 km long x 15 km wide, is the largest raised coral atoll in the world. The site includes approximately 37,000 ha and a marine area extending 3 nautical miles to sea. A major feature of the island is Lake Tegano, which was the former lagoon on the atoll. The lake, the largest in the insular Pacific (15,500 ha), is brackish and contains many rugged limestone islands and endemic species. Rennell is mostly covered with dense forest, with a canopy averaging 20 m in height. Combined with the strong climatic effects of frequent cyclones, the site is a true natural laboratory for scientific study. The site is under customary land ownership and management.\n|}\nTentative list\nIn addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. , the Solomon Islands have listed two properties on their tentative list.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (province)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" | UNESCO criteria\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Marovo - Tetepare Complex\n|\n|Western Province\n| align=\"center\" |2008\n|iii, v, vi, vii, viii, ix, x (mixed)\n|\n|-\n!Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Solomon Islands\n|\n|Choiseul Province, Guadalcanal Province, Makira-Ulawa Province, Western Province\n| align=\"center\" |2008\n|vii, ix, x (natural)\n|\n|}\nReferences"
