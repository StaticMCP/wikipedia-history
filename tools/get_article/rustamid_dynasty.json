The dynasty governed as a Muslim theocracy for a century and a half from its capital Tahert (present day Tagdemt) until the Ismaili Fatimid Caliphate defeated it. Rustamid authority extended over what is now central and western Algeria, parts of southern Tunisia, and the Jebel Nafusa and Fezzan regions in Libya as far as Zawila.\nHistory\nOrigins\nThe Rustamids were of Persian origin. They claimed descent from the Kings of Kings of the Sasanian Empire.\nBackground\nThe Ibadi movement reached North Africa by 719, when the missionary Salama ibn Sa'd was sent from the Ibadi ''jama'a'' of Basra to Kairouan. By 740, their efforts had converted the major Berber tribes of Huwara around Tripoli, in the Nafusa Mountains and at Zenata in western Tripolitania. In 757 (140&nbsp;AH), a group of four Basra-educated missionaries including Abd al-Rahman ibn Rustam proclaimed an Ibadi imamate in Tripolitania, starting an abortive state led by Abu al-Khattab Abdul-A'la ibn as-Samh which lasted until the Abbasid Caliphate dispatched Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath al-Khuza'i to suppress it in 761. Ifriqiya was conquered by the Abbasids from Kharijite control and Abu al-Khattab ibn as-Samh was killed. On his death, the Tripolitanian Ibādiyya elected Abu al-Hatim al-Malzuzi as Imam; he was killed in 772 after launching a second unsuccessful revolt in 768.\nRise\nIn 777, Abd al-Rahman ibn Rustam, an Ifriqiyan-born convert to the Ibadi movement of Persian origin and one of the four founders of the imamate, was elected Imam; after this, the post remained in his family, a practice which the Ibadiyya justified by noting that he came from no tribe, and thus his election as imam would not favour the domination of one Ibadi tribe over the others.\nThe new imamate was centered on the newly built capital of Tahert (or Tahart), near present-day Tiaret. Several Ibadi tribes displaced from Tunisia and Tripolitania settled there and strong fortifications were built. Al-Bakri mentions that after the establishment of Tahert, tribes within the area congregated around the vicinity of Tahert as the town was conceived of as a military base of the Imam and leader of the Ibadi tribes. The town was surrounded by a strong wall, it had a fortress, a commercial center, regular supply of water, gardens of fruit and vegetables and it was foremost a religious and economic center of the region. It eventually became a center along the caravan trade route to the Near East, this economic prosperity resulted in the later settlement of non-Ibadite Muslims and Christians.\nThe Rustamids fought the Kairouan-based Aghlabids of Ifriqiya in 812, but otherwise reached a modus vivendi; this displeased Ibādī tribes on the Aghlabid border, who launched a few rebellions. The Rustamids established positive relations with the Midrarid dynasty of Sijilmasa and the Umayyads of Cordoba.\nDecline\nIn 873, a succession crisis occurred as the third imam Abu Bakr, fearing the loss of his title to his older brother Mohammed Abu al-Yaqzan, attempted to assassinate him. However, his plot failed, leading to the population uprising against Abu Bakr, resulting in his overthrow and death in 874. Consequently, Mohammed Abu al-Yaqzan assumed the title.\nAfter Abd al-Wahhab, the Rustamids grew militarily weak; they were easily conquered by the Ismaili Fatimids in 909, upon which many Ibadis – including the last imam – fled to the Sedrata tribe of Ouargla, whence they would ultimately emigrate to Mzab.\nSociety and culture\nThe Rustamid dynasty, \"developed a cosmopolitan reputation in which Christians, non-Kharijite Muslims, and adherents of different sects of Kharijites lived\". On the intellectual field, the Rustamids had many scholars and learned men, such as Abd al-Rahman ibn Rustam, Abd al-Wahhab ibn Abd al-Rahman, Aflah ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhab, dan Abu al-Yaqzhan ibn Aflah, Mahdi an-Nafusi, ‘Abd Allah al-Lamthi, and Mahmud ibn Bakr. ‘Abd ar-Rahman had an exegesis of the Qur’an. ‘Abd al-Wahhab wrote his Masa'il Nafusah on Islamic jurisprudence. Aflah mastered Arabic literature, mathematics, and astronomy. Abu al-Yaqzhan wrote about 40 works. Because of their intellectual enthusiasm, the Rustamids vigorously transferred valuable works from the Mashriq to the Maghrib, especially to the library of al-Ma‘shumah (in Tahert) and that of Khizanah Nafusah (in Jabal Nafusah).\nMoreover, Tahert was famous as ‘Iraq al-Maghrib, al-‘Iraq ash-Shaghir, Balkh al-Maghrib, or Little Basra. Apart from these achievements, the Rustamids also had significant contribution to Islamization in the Maghrib and Bilad as-Sudan. For about two centuries (130–340 AH / 750–950 AD), the Kharijite people gained control of trade routes in the Maghrib and Bilad as-Sudan. Many Ibadite merchants made journeys along the vast area, such as Tahert, Wargla, Nafzawa, Jabal Nafusah, Tadmakkat, Gao, and Ghana. By this economic activity, the Ibadites took advantages of trading business and preaching Islam at the same time.\nThe Rustamid dynasty's origin accounted for the large presence of Persians in Tahert in the 9th century.\nRustamid imams\n*Abd al-Rahman ibn Rustam (Bānū-Bādūsyān) (776–788)\n*Abd al-Wahhab ibn Abd al-Rahman (788–824)\n* Aflah ibn ʿAbdi l-Wahhab (824–872)\n* Abu Bakr ibn Aflah (872–874)\n* Muhammad Abu l-Yaqzan ibn Aflah (874–894)\n* Yusuf Abu Hatim ibn Muhammad (894–895)\n* Yaʿqub ibn Aflah (895–899)\n* Yusuf Abu Hatim ibn Muhammad, again (899–906)\n* Yaqzan ibn Muhammad Abi l-Yaqzan (906–909)\nSee also\n*Banu Masala\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n* Wheatley, Paul, \"The Places where Men Pray Together: Cities in Islamic Lands, Seventh Through the Tenth Centuries\", Published by University of Chicago Press, 2001, .\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081118035320/http://www1.bartleby.com/67/292.html The Encyclopedia of World History]\n* [http://www.euratlas.net/AHP/histoire_europe/carte_europe_0800.html Card of Rustamid or Tahert Kingdom].\n* [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/514123/Rustamid-kingdom Rustamid Dynasty Encyclopedy Britanica].\n*"
