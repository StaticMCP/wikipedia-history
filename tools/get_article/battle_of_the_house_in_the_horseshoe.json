The battle, which took place on either July 29 or August 5, 1781 (with July 29 being the most accepted date), ended in a victory for the loyalists.  The surrender terms between the combatants were negotiated by Alston's wife on behalf of the patriots, and by Fanning for the loyalists.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120720235314/http://www.nchistoricsites.org/horsesho/main.htm  North Carolina State Historic Sites page]\n*[http://www.northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/411/entry North Carolina History Project, \"House in the Horseshoe\"]"
