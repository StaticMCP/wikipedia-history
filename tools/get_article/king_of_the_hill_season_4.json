The Region 1 DVD was released on May 3, 2005. The Region 2 and 4 DVDs were respectively released on January 15 and June 20, 2007.\nProduction\nThe showrunners for the season were Greg Daniels and Richard Appel. The episode \"Transnational Amusements Presents: Peggy's Magic Sex Feet\" focused on fetish websites, with a real interactive website being created to promote the episode, under the domain name peggysfeet.com. The cross-media stunt originated after staff writers were discussing how domain names on the internet can sell for large prices. Shortly after writing the episode, Jonathan Collier registered the address peggysfeet.com, with Richard Appel telling Entertainment Weekly in 2000, \"I got a message from Twentieth Century Fox months later saying, 'we wanted to get peggysfeet.com, but it's already owned by someone.' And I said, 'well, luckily it's one of the writers on our show.' I'd like to believe that had we not registered it, 7 million people would have tried to after the episode aired.\" Appel also noted that they researched various fetish websites for the episode, saying \"I do know that some visits — purely for purposes of accuracy — were made to these types of websites. I haven't yet visited one, but the general consensus was that it's much more about the smushing of mashed potatoes and worms than actual sex.\"\nEpisodes\n| ProdCode=3ABE24\n| Viewers=9.74\n| ShortSummary=Conclusion.
