Delany and a representative early story by him, nonfiction pieces related to the awards, and the three Rhysling Award and Dwarf Stars Award-winning poems for 2013, together with an introduction by the editor.

The range of types of work in this particular anthology helps give an idea of the whole of science fiction being written today.\" She rates the pieces included as \"of course, wonderful,\" and their authors as \"writers at the top of their genre,\" while noting that the book \"is geared towards sci-fi lovers, and those who are already familiar with ... the genre,\" and so \"likely not a good choice to introduce someone to science fiction.\" At the same time, it may \"disappoint\" those \"looking for science fiction in the most traditional sense of 'men in space, encountering little green men.'\" As the text contains \"challenging\" points of view and \"abounds\" with \"[a]lternative viewpoints, and alternative sexualities ... [t]his would likely be an appropriate book for an older teen reader, but adults might want to give the book a quick once-over before their children get their hands on it.\"\nThe anthology was also reviewed by Gary K. Wolfe in Locus no. 659, December 2015, Don Sakers in Analog Science Fiction and Fact, April 2016, Charles de Lint in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, May-June 2016, and Norman Spinrad in ''Asimov's Science Fiction'', October-November 2016.\nNotes"
