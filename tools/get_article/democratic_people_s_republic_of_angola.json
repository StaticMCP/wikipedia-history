It was formed during the dawn of Angolan independence, in November 1975, though by February 1976, its FNLA forces had been largely defeated by the MPLA of the People's Republic of Angola. The Democratic People's Republic, at first, was inspired by Maoism and the Chinese Communist Revolution, including an explicit mention of the construction of socialism in its program, but later moved towards anti-communist positions. It was initially supported by the People's Republic of China and, later, by South Africa and the United States.\nSee also\n*List of heads of state of the Democratic People's Republic of Angola\n*List of heads of government of the Democratic People's Republic of Angola\nReferences"
