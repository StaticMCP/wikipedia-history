He has received multiple awards and honors from national governments, universities, and other non-governmental organisations including the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize.\nWałęsa served as President of Poland from 1990 to 1995 and became the first democratically elected president of Poland since 1926 as well as the first-ever Polish president elected by popular vote. He was the leader of the Solidarity movement and led a successful pro-democratic effort, which in 1989 ended Communist rule in Poland and ushered in the end of the Cold War.\nHe was named the Time Person of the Year (1981) and one of Time's 100 most important people of the 20th century (1999). He has received over forty honorary degrees, including from Harvard University and Columbia University, as well as dozens of the highest state orders, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, and the French Grand Cross of Legion of Honour. In 1989, Wałęsa was the first foreign non-head of state to address the Joint Meeting of the U.S. Congress. The Gdańsk Lech Wałęsa Airport has borne his name since 2004.\nHonors\nand the coat of arms of Gdańsk, of which one of the crosses was replaced by a fleur-de-lis, symbol of Our Lady of Częstochowa.]]\nApart from his 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, Wałęsa has received many other international distinctions and awards. He has been named \"Man of the Year\" by Time Magazine (1981), The Financial Times (1980) and The Observer (1980). He was the first recipient of the Liberty Medal, on 4 July 1989 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and that same year received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He is the third foreigner and the first non-head-of-state to have addressed a joint session of the United States Congress (15 November 1989).\nOn 8 February 2002, Wałęsa represented Europe, carrying the Olympic flag at the opening ceremonies of the XIX Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City, in company with Archbishop Desmond Tutu (Africa), John Glenn (the Americas), Kazuyoshi Funaki (Asia), Cathy Freeman (Oceania), Jean-Michel Cousteau (Environment), Jean-Claude Killy (Sport), and Steven Spielberg (Culture). Two years later, on 10 May 2004, Gdańsk International Airport was officially renamed Gdańsk Lech Wałęsa Airport to commemorate a famous Gdańsk citizen, and his signature was incorporated into the airport's logo.\nA month later, in June 2004, Wałęsa represented Poland at the state funeral of Ronald Reagan. On 11 October 2006, Wałęsa was  keynote speaker at the launch of \"International Human Solidarity Day,\" proclaimed in 2005 by the United Nations General Assembly. In January 2007 Wałęsa spoke at a Taiwan event, \"Towards a Global Forum on New Democracies,\" in support of peace and democracy, along with other prominent world leaders and Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian.\nOn 25 April 2007, Wałęsa represented the Polish government at the funeral of Boris Yeltsin, former president of the Russian Federation. On 23 October 2009, he spoke at a conference in Gdansk of presidents of all European senates, commemorating the 20th anniversary of the first free parliamentary elections in a former communist country – the 1989 elections to the Polish Senate.\nOn 6 September 2011, Wałęsa rejected Lithuania's Order of Vytautas the Great as a result of constant discrimination on the part of the Lithuanian government towards its Polish minority.\nHonours\nOrders\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n!class=\"unsortable\"| Ribbon bar\n!
