He was educated at Winchester and he matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford in 1826. He became a scholar at Trinity College and graduated with a first class honours. He was called to the bar but did not practice, instead serving on government commissions. He was a British Poor Law Commissioner serving in Ireland between 1845 and 1847. He tackled his work assisting the relief effort with enthusiasm but argued with Charles Trevelyan and Charles Wood over taxes. He resigned his office because he objected to rate-in-aid legislation that he regarded as unfair to the north of Ireland, making them in effect pay for relief twice.\nTwisleton died at Boulogne, France, on 5 October 1874 and is buried at Broughton churchyard in Oxfordshire.\nReferences"
