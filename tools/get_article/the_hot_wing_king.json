She was inspired to write a play that centered on Black gay men because she wanted to create a story that reflected her brother's life experiences. The Hot Wing King premiered on February 11, 2020, off-Broadway at Pershing Square Signature Center in Manhattan. The show's run ended prematurely due to restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Katori Hall directed a production at the Alliance Theatre in 2022.\nA new production opened at the Dorfman Theatre, part of the National Theatre in London on 11 July 2024, with its opening night on 18 July 2024.\nReception\nThe Hot Wing King received mixed reception. In a review for the New York Times, Ben Brantley praised \"the matter-of-fact depiction of Black gay characters who may be dissatisfied, to varying degrees, with their own behavior but not, ultimately, because of their sexuality\" but further stated \"the balance between social soap opera and buoyant comedy isn't always gracefully sustained.\" Similarly, Marilyn Stasio of Variety called the plot \"meandering\" and referred positively to \"the extremely likable characters.\" Robert Hofler of TheWrap called The Hot Wing King \"a raucous comedy\" that was also \"lopsided.\"\nHall received the 2021 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for The Hot Wing King. The citation described the play as \"a funny, deeply felt consideration of Black masculinity and how it is perceived, filtered through the experiences of a loving gay couple and their extended family as they prepare for a culinary competition.\"\nSee also\n*Culture of Tennessee\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.signaturetheatre.org/shows-and-events/Productions/2019-2020/The-Hot-Wing-King.aspx The Hot Wing King] on SignatureTheatre.org"
