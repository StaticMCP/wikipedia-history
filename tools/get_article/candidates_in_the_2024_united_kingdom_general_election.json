The processes used by Labour and the Conservatives were described by PoliticsHome as \"secretive\" and \"controversial\".\nIn June 2022, former Channel 4 journalist Michael Crick launched a Twitter account called Tomorrow's MPs, documenting the selection process of parties candidates in the runup to the next general election.\nConservative\nOn 5 April 2023, Home Secretary and Fareham MP Suella Braverman defeated Meon Valley MP Flick Drummond by a majority of local party members of 77 to 54, to be preselected for the new seat of Fareham and Waterlooville. Drummond later won the contest to be selected for Winchester, a seat far more likely to be gained by the Liberal Democrats.\nOn 17 April 2023, Chairman of the Conservative Party Greg Hands announced the first 19 seats that would open selections. The seats were listed by ConservativeHome as Bicester and Woodstock, Calder Valley, Camborne and Redruth, Canterbury, Coventry South, Earley and Woodley, Eltham and Chislehurst, Hazel Grove, Hove and Portslade, Isle of Wight East, Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle, Milton Keynes South, Norwich North, Selby, South Cambridgeshire, South West Devon, Tamworth, West Bromwich and West Lancashire.\nOn 29 May, the Conservative Campaign Headquarters announced the next 24 seats that would open selections: Altrincham and Sale West, Bishop Auckland, Bromsgrove, Broxbourne, Chippenham, Coventry North West, Eastleigh, Esher and Walton, Exeter East and Exmouth, Halifax, Hendon, Henley, Mid Bedfordshire, Newport West and Islwyn, Norwich South, Reigate, Rugby, Scarborough and Whitby, South Shropshire, Stevenage, Stoke-on-Trent Central, Walsall and Bloxwich, West Suffolk and Wolverhampton West.\nOn 2 June 2023, Bromsgrove Conservatives began their selection process for a candidate.\nOn 12 June, Boris Johnson resigned as an MP, triggering a by-election. The same day, Nigel Adams also resigned as an MP. On 19 June, David Warburton gave up his seat in Parliament.\nOn 11 August, the Conservatives opened selections for 26 seats: Alyn and Deeside, Bridlington and The Wolds, Bristol North West, Bury South, Clwyd North, Colchester, Crawley, Croydon East, Doncaster North, Dorking and Horley, Frome and East Somerset, Glastonbury and Somerton, Heywood and Middleton North, Huntingdon, Leeds East, Leeds West and Pudsey, Mid Cheshire, North West Leicestershire, Pontefract, Castleford and Knottingley, Richmond Park, Sittingbourne and Sheppey, Southampton Itchen, St Albans, Wakefield and Rothwell, Waveney Valley and Wirral West.\nNadine Dorries announced her intentions to resign and officially resigned on 29 August. Chris Pincher left Parliament on 7 September.\nOn 22 September, nominations opened in 10 seats: Bath, Bolton South and Walkden, Bridgend, Coventry South, Lancaster and Wyre, Norwich North, Telford, West Bromwich, Westmorland and Lonsdale and Wimbledon.\nOn 30 September 2023, The Telegraph reported that the Conservatives had only selected 65 candidates out of their target of 100 before the Conservative Party Conference.\nOn 13 October 2023, nominations opened in 18 seats: Bristol North East, Cardiff North, Cardiff West, Chester North and Neston, City of Durham, Croydon West, Dwyfor Meirionnydd, Gower, Hampstead and Highgate, Harrow West, Leicester East, Mid Cheshire, Nottingham East, Oxford West and Abingdon, Queens Park and Maida Vale, Wirral West, Wolverhampton South East and Wolverhampton West.\nOn 23 November 2023, Nick Rose, who had been the candidate for Norwich North, resigned.\nIn late 2023, two candidates were removed after MI5 warned in 2021 that they were potential Chinese spies. In April 2024, the selection process was internally criticised by party members for \"purging Brexit-backing candidates\". The preferred selection of One Nation Conservatives by the party leadership over right-wing candidates was reported on. This included the former Deputy Leader of the UK Independence Party and Conservative MEP David Campbell Bannerman who was blocked in South Norfolk.\nOn 28 May 2024, it was reported that the Conservatives had 183 candidates to select.\nOn 28 May 2024, presenter Iain Dale announced that he would be stepping back from his LBC radio show to run as a Conservative candidate in the election, hoping to stand in the seat of Tunbridge Wells, where he lives. However on 31 May he announced that he had decided not to put his name on the shortlist after comments he had made about Tunbridge Wells, two years earlier, emerged online. In the clip he had said that he didn't like living in the town he was running in. Dale defended himself by stating that \"there is a context to it, but nobody's interested in context or nuance in these situations\".\nBy 7 June, the Conservatives had filled all seats with candidates in Great Britain except for Rotherham. Laila Cunningham was originally selected as the Conservative candidate for the seat, but withdrew shortly before the nominations deadline. As the party did not field a replacement, it is the only seat in Great Britain aside from the Speaker's seat of Chorley in which no Conservative candidate was nominated.\nLabour\nIn March 2021, the local parties in East Ham and West Ham were suspended following allegations of electoral fraud, disbanding the internal selections committee. This was a precursor to contentious selections across East London, between centrist supporters of Keir Starmer and Momentum-backed supporters of former leader Jeremy Corbyn.\nThe Labour Party selected many prospective parliamentary candidates throughout 2022.\nIn July 2022, a trigger ballot was held in Ilford South to determine whether MP Sam Tarry should face reselection; Tarry lost the vote by 57.5% to 42.5%. On 10 October 2022 a reselection vote was held, which Tarry lost to local council leader Jas Athwal by 361 votes to 499. In late 2022, councillor Dominic Beck stood down as Labour PPC for Rother Valley.\nBy 1 January 2023, a total of 77 Constituency Labour Parties had selected prospective parliamentary candidates.\nIn February 2023, BBC News reported that local Labour parties were being overruled over parliamentary selections by \"a clique in London\". Nine members of the selection committee in Bolton North East Parliamentary Labour Party resigned after the national party imposed a shortlist on them. The main contention was over the fact that Leigh Drennan, the chair of North West Labour, was not shortlisted despite being endorsed by Deputy Labour Leader Angela Rayner.\nIn March 2023, Labour's national executive committee resolved not to endorse Jeremy Corbyn for Islington North in the next general election, preventing him from seeking re-election as a Labour candidate. Labour later chose Praful Nargund as their candidate, which was shortly followed by Corbyn announcing his intention to run as an independent in the constituency.\nOn 23 May 2023, eleven members of the Copeland local Labour Party executive resigned following the decision of the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party not to longlist local councillor Joseph Ghayouba for selection. Local officials said it showed a \"shameless disregard for democracy\" by Labour's national ruling body. On 6 June 2023, former Copeland PPC Gillian Troughton withdrew from the selection in Whitehaven and Workington, describing the selection process as \"frustrating and ultimately disenfranchising\".\nOn 26 May 2023, the Wirral West Constituency Labour Party was suspended by the national party, following complaints. This was the same week that the local MP Margaret Greenwood announced that she was standing down at the next general election. As Wirral South was abolished, incumbent MP Alison McGovern challenged neighbouring MP Mick Whitley for the nomination in Birkenhead. Whitley was deselected on 16 June 2023.\nOn 7 June 2023, MP for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney Gerald Jones defeated MP for Cynon Valley Beth Winter for his party's selection to become the Labour candidate for the new parliamentary seat of Merthyr Tydfil and Aberdare, which will be contested at the 2024 general election. The seat was renamed from Merthyr Tydfil and Upper Cynon in the final recommendations.\nFrom 15 to 16 July, 100 Labour PPCs were given a weekend for a crash course in \"message discipline, media training and the art of campaigning\" in Stratford-upon-Avon.\nOn 27 July 2023, Labour opened selections for 94 \"non-priority\" parliamentary seats. On 31 August 2023, Labour suspended the CLP in Leicester East amid the process of selecting a new candidate to replace Claudia Webbe.\nOn 5 September 2023, Labour suspended its leadership team in the Bolton North East constituency following a disagreement over the selection of a prospective parliamentary candidate.\nOn 8 December 2023, Labour opened selections for 211 'non-battleground' parliamentary seats.\nIn March 2024, Joel Bodmer withdrew from the selection process in Croydon East alleging abuse. This was following an unauthorised breach of data.\nBy 22 May 2024, LabourList reported that approximately 100 seats did not have Labour candidates announced yet.\nOn 31 May 2024, Faiza Shaheen was removed as the candidate for Chingford and Woodford Green. There was media speculation over the future of Diane Abbott, but she confirmed she would be standing.\nBy 7 June, Labour had filled all seats in Great Britain (except that held by the Speaker) with candidates.\nLiberal Democrats\nPresident of the Liberal Democrats Mark Pack lists prospective parliamentary candidates on his website.\nIn March 2024, Liberal Democrat PPC for South Shropshire Chris Naylor stood down due to ill health.\nBy 7 June, the Liberal Democrats had filled all seats with candidates in Great Britain except for Manchester Rusholme and Chorley.\nScottish National Party\nSNP MPs are not automatically reselected to stand, the party has a full open reselection process. To be nominated to take part in a selection contest a party member requires either a nomination by their local campaigns committee, or 50 local branch members.\nOn 25 August 2023, Patrick Grady was not approved as a candidate for the 2024 general election. Glasgow Central MP Alison Thewliss ultimately won the selection contest in his seat of Glasgow North. East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow MP Lisa Cameron criticised the \"party hierarchy\" when she faced a reselection challenge, like many sitting members, per the party rules, claiming she had spoken out about Grady. She claimed she had been ostracised by the party leadership and threatened to resign and call by-election in protest. Cameron was challenged by Grant Costello, a digital manager for the SNP's Westminster group who lives in the constituency. Costello was endorsed by MSPs Christina McKelvie and Collette Stevenson. Ultimately, on 12 October 2023, Cameron — a social conservative — left the SNP altogether and defected to the Conservatives, two hours before the two weeks of voting was due to conclude. Grant Costello, who was leading in the voting, won the selection for SNP candidate for the new seat of East Kilbride and Strathaven. Cameron was reportedly not standing for Parliament again. The same day 8 other candidates were also announced.\nArgyll and Bute MP Brendan O'Hara was challenged for reselection by Helensburgh councillor Math Campbell-Sturgess. In Glasgow East, David Linden won a selection contest against neighbouring MP Alison Thewliss, whose constituency was split into seven.\nIn Falkirk, two SNP councillors Gary Bouse and Paul Garner launched their campaign to succeed John McNally. Toni Giugliano was cleared of breaking selection rules.\nOn the eve of the 2023 Rutherglen and Hamilton West by-election Mhairi Black reportedly threatened to quit the SNP. This was over her wishes to be succeeded as SNP candidate for Paisley and Renfrewshire South by her senior adviser Robert Innes. Jacqueline Cameron, the depute leader of Renfrewshire Council stood against him. On 26 October 2023, Cameron was declared selected by 60%.\nBy April 2024, candidates had been selected for all 57 new constituencies.\nGreen Party of England and Wales\nThe Green Party of England and Wales confirmed in January 2024 that it aims to field candidates in all 575 constituencies in England and Wales.\nThe Green Party of England and Wales nominated a candidate in 574 of the 575 constituencies in England and Wales, including Chorley where the Speaker is standing to defend his seat without opposition from the Conservatives, Labour, the Lib Dems, or Reform.  The only constituency in England and Wales where the Greens are not standing a candidate of their own is Heywood and North Middleton, where they endorsed independent candidate Chris Furlong.\nScottish Greens\nThe Scottish Greens stood a record number of candidates, a candidate in 44 of 57 constituencies in Scotland.\nGreen Party Northern Ireland\nThe Green Party Northern Ireland also stood in a record number of seats in Northern Ireland, a candidate in 11 of 18 constituencies in Northern Ireland.\nPlaid Cymru\nPlaid Cymru Leader Rhun ap Iorwerth was named as the candidate for Ynys Môn. In October 2023 he was replaced as candidate by Llinos Medi.\nReform UK\nFor the 2019 general election, the Brexit Party (the former name of Reform UK) did not stand candidates in seats where the Conservative party won in 2017. Leader Richard Tice ruled out a similar arrangement for this election, and stated his party's intention to stand in 630 seats.\nThe party pulled some of its prospective candidates for controversial social media comments. However, it also gave its support to other parliamentary candidates that are standing for the party that have spread conspiracy theories.\nAfter media speculation on the question, honorary president and former leader Nigel Farage declared he would not be standing as a candidate. Farage later announced on 3 June that, contrary to his statement earlier in the campaign, he would stand for Parliament in Clacton, and that he had resumed leadership of Reform UK. He also said that Labour would win the election.\nSince January 2024, it was reported that Reform UK had pulled over 100 candidates. Just before the deadline they were 80 candidates short of the total they intended to reach.\nWorkers Party of Britain\nDuring his victory speech following the 2024 Rochdale by-election, George Galloway claimed his Workers Party had 59 candidates ready to contest a general election. Later, in a tweet from 2 March Galloway confirmed that this total increased to 79. As of June the party listed over 250 candidates, and also supporting a number of independent candidates, most notably Jeremy Corbyn in Islington North, Faiza Shaheen in Chingford and Woodford Green, and Andrew Feinstein in Holborn and St Pancras.\nSinn Fein\nSinn Féin did not contest four constituencies; Belfast East, Belfast South and Mid Down, Lagan Valley and North Down.\nDemocratic Unionist Party\nThe Democratic Unionist Party did not contest Fermanagh and South Tyrone, instead endorsing Ulster Unionist Party candidate Diana Armstrong. The DUP stood aside in North Down in order to support the bid of independent unionist candidate Alex Easton, who had stood unsuccessfully for the DUP for the seat in 2017 and 2019.\nUlster Unionist Party\nThe Ulster Unionist Party stood candidates, denied any electoral pacts and explained their lack of a candidate in Belfast North as being down to a lack of party infrastructure on the ground in the constituency.\nOther parties\nGina Miller's True and Fair party planned to contest a small number of constituencies.\nThe British Democrats confirmed three parliamentary candidates in the 2024 general election.\nThe Christian Peoples Alliance stated they aimed to stand in 100 seats. After the close of nominations they had 22 candidates.\nThe English Democrats, Heritage Party, Climate Party, Transform, TUSC, Liberal Party, UK Independence Party, the Animal Welfare Party, Official Monster Raving Loony Party and the Communist Party of Britain ran candidates.\nThe Wessex Regionalists announced they would not stand candidates, citing the strong likelihood of a Labour victory leaving little interest in alternative parties.\nIndependents\nJeremy Corbyn stood as an independent in Islington North. Other sitting MPs who stood as independents (rather than within the party they represented at the 2019 General Election) included Andrew Bridgen, Angus MacNeil, and Claudia Webbe.\nOn 5 June, former Labour candidate Faiza Shaheen, who had been deselected in Chingford and Woodford Green due to her social media history which the party alleged displayed a history of downplaying antisemitism, announced her independent candidacy.\nCandidates by constituency\nCandidates by demographic\nGender\nThe proportion of female candidates decreased to 30%. In Northern Ireland, one third of the candidates are women.\nCandidate changes\nMPs not standing for re-election\nBy 7 June 2024, a total of 132 Members of Parliament announced their intention not to stand for re-election. Four MPs — Nadine Dorries, Nigel Adams, Chris Skidmore (all Conservative) and Chris Pincher (independent, elected as Conservative) — announced their intention not to stand again but later resigned from Parliament before the election and are not included in the figures below. This general election marks the first time that no sitting MPs from the Liberal Democrats stood down since their formation in 1988.\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+ Number of MPs standing down by party affiliation\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"| Party\n! colspan=\"2\"| MPs standing down\n|-\n!

However, in some cases sitting MPs secured selection to stand in a substantially or completely different seat from their present seat. They may happen because their seat is marginal and likely to be lost by their party, losing preselection to another candidate, boundary changes abolished their present seat or their present seat was redrawn in an unfavourable way in boundary changes.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Members of Parliament changing constituencies\n! scope=\"col\" | MP\n! scope=\"col\" | Former constituency\n! scope=\"col\" | First elected\n! colspan=2 | Party (as elected)\n! scope=\"col\" | New constituency\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Note\n|-\n|\n| Wolverhampton South West\n| 2019\n|\n| South Shropshire\n| While there are no significant changes to Anderson's former seat, it is a marginal Conservative seat, whereas South Shropshire is likely a safe Conservative seat.
