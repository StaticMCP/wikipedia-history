This led to the first colonial naval bombardment in Somalia's history as retaliation.\nBackground\nOn April 24, 1890 Italian steamboat Volta was sent to the shores of Warsheikh under the command of Lieutenant Zavagli, with instructions to seek a meeting with the local chief, whose population  primarily belonged to the Abgaal sub-clan of the Hawiya Somalis, to \"demonstrate the crew's friendly intentions and to offer gifts for the chiefs and the population\". Alongside Zavagli were Coxswain Angelo Bertolucci, Seaman 3rd Class Angelo Bertorello, Engineer 3rd Class Alfredo Simoni, Stoker 2nd Class Giuseppe Gorini, Chief Helmsman 2nd Giovanni Gonnella, and an Arab interpreter Said Achmed.\nMassacre\nAfter Zavagli arrived, the Somalis attacked, launched at a signal from the Somali chief. Zavagli died on the boat, while it tried to get out to sea while the rest of the crew fired wildly to cover their escape. Bertorello was hit by the Somalis while working on the anchor; he suffered fatal wounds.\nThe death of Lieutenant Zavagli, and Bertorello, was one of many \"incidents\" that stalled Italian colonial ambitions in Somalia.\nAftermath\nSheekh Ahmed Gabyow recited this poem after the battles of Cadale and Warsheikh, the first call for Somali nationalism.\nAnother Italian defeat at Lafoole in 1896, dubbed the \"Somali Adwa\" by the Italians, resultec in the death of Italian Consul General Antonio Cecchi, the most important expeditionist and fervent promoter of the Italian Colonial Administration. Italian ships bombed the coasts of Nimmo and Jasira, before withdrawing to their areas of influence.\nSee also\n* Italian-Somali Wars\n* Banadir resistance\n* Italian Somaliland\nReferences"
