      "text": "# International Sponsors of War__disambig_1\n\nInternational Sponsors of War () was a publicly-available list of companies and individuals maintained by the Ukrainian National Agency on Corruption Prevention (NACP) in connection with the Russo-Ukrainian War, particularly the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It had no legal standing but was nonetheless impactful. By December 2023, the list included 46 companies from 17 countries and 261 individuals who, by doing business with Russia, increase Russian revenues and ultimately Russian military budget in the ongoing war with Ukraine.}} The list is contrasted with international boycott of Russia when by 2023 more than 1000 companies withdrew or divested themselves from Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. NACP viewed the list as a reputational instrument for elements of global supply chains, aimed at reducing Russia's financial and technological capability to damage Ukraine. In September 2022 the list was included into London Stock Exchange Group's database. Some companies among International Sponsors of War are also restricted in other countries.\nInclusion on the list was arbitrary and decided by the NACP on a one to one basis. Some companies have been removed from the list, as they ceased business with Russia and condemned the war. In June 2023, media outlets also reported the removal of five Greek tanker companies from the list, however the NACP kept them as they did not publicly condemn the invasion. In March 2024, following diplomatic pressure, the list of International Sponsors of War was removed from public access by the NACP and its data were moved to the Interdepartmental Working Group on Implementation of the State Sanctions Policy (IWG).\nCompanies\nList\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!Name\n!Country\n!Branch\n!Notes\n!Date\n|-\n|Alibaba Group Holding Limited\n|\n|Various\n|Through AliExpress in Russia the company provides an international platform for the sale of foreign goods.\n|2023\n|-\n|Auchan\n|\n|Retail\n|According to NACP, after the invasion of Ukraine, Auchan's Russian subsidiary continued to pay taxes to the Russian budget, supply goods to the Russian military in the occupied Ukrainian territories under the guise of humanitarian aid and help Russian military offices recruit conscripts.
