It introduced concepts such as \"cough etiquette\", \"early, targeted, and layered nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)\", \"hand hygiene\", \"nonpharmaceutical intervention (NPI)\", and \"social distancing\". In the report's introduction, a chart illustrates how expanding \"medical surge capacity\", \"reducing the anticipated demand for services\", and \"limiting disease transmission\" can delay a \"rapid upswing of cases\" and lower the \"epidemic peak\". This would \"allow  a better match between the number of ill persons requiring hospitalization and the nation's capacity to provide medical care for such people.\" This chart was shared on social media in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n2010s\n*2013 – CDC releases first report to categorize threats by hazard level.\n*2014 – CDC established a Modeling Task Force capable of generating estimates of risk for importation of cases of Ebola from West African countries like Mali to the United States.\n2020s\n* 2025 – CDC's Roybal Campus is attacked by a gunman who kills a local police officer and strikes four CDC buildings over 180 times.\nSee also\n*Louis L.
