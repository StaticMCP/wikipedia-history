It briefly included a second chapter in Bloomington, before that organization split off to form the Prairie Aviation Museum in 1983. Following the separation, in 1985 it began negotiating for the lease of a hangar at the Logan County Airport.\nIn 1987, the museum was given a  World War II barracks that had been moved to the airport from Camp Ellis years before and began renovating it. An F-4B located at Chanute Air Force Base was flown to the museum as a sling load underneath a helicopter in 1991. The B-25 project, which had been brought with the museum after its move, was eventually sold in 1994.\nAfter learning it would be receiving a grant, the museum announced plans to upgrade its building in 2013.\nExhibits\nExhibits at the museum include a searchlight.\nCollection\n* Beechcraft UC-45F Expeditor\n* Bell TH-13T Sioux\n* Bell UH-1H Iroquois\n* Lockheed T-33A\n* LTV A-7E Corsair II\n* McDonnell F-4B Phantom II\nSee also\n* Prairie Aviation Museum\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
