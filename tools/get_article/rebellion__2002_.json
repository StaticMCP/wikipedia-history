It was held exclusively for wrestlers from the promotion's SmackDown! brand division, which made it WWE's first-ever SmackDown!-exclusive PPV. The event took place on October 26, 2002, at the Manchester Arena in Manchester, England and was broadcast exclusively in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. It was the first Rebellion held under the WWE name, after the promotion had been renamed from World Wrestling Federation (WWF) to WWE in May earlier that year. Rebellion was discontinued after this event due to the promotion's discontinuation of UK-exclusive PPVs in 2003.\nProduction\nBackground\nin Manchester, England.]]\nRebellion was an annual United Kingdom-exclusive pay-per-view (PPV) produced by the American professional wrestling promotion, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), since 1999. The 2002 event was the fourth event in the Rebellion chronology. It was scheduled to be held on October 26, 2002, at the Manchester Arena in Manchester, England. It was also the first Rebellion produced under the WWE name, as the company was renamed from World Wrestling Federation (WWF) to WWE in May earlier that year. It was also the first Rebellion produced under the brand extension that was introduced in March, which divided the roster into two separate brands, Raw and SmackDown!, where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform. The 2002 event was in turn held exclusively for wrestlers from the SmackDown! brand, which was the promotion's first SmackDown!-exclusive PPV produced.\nStorylines\nThe event featured nine professional wrestling matches and two pre-show matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by WWE's writers on the SmackDown! brand. Storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television show SmackDown!.\nEvent\n{| class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ Other on-screen personnel\n|-\n!Role:\n!Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Commentators\n|Michael Cole\n|-\n|Tazz\n|-\n|Interviewer\n|Mark Lloyd\n|-\n|Ring announcer\n|Tony Chimel\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Referees\n|Mike Chioda\n|-\n|Mike Sparks\n|-\n|Brian Hebner\n|-\n|Jim Korderas\n|}\nPrior to the start of the pay-per-view, Bill DeMott defeated Shannon Moore in a dark match.\nPreliminary matches\nThe first match of the pay-per-view was scheduled to be The Undertaker facing Matt Hardy. However, SmackDown! General Manager Stephanie McMahon came out and revealed that The Undertaker was not at the event since his wife was expecting a baby. Stephanie then revealed that, as part of a trade to acquire Big Show, Raw's Booker T would substitute for The Undertaker for one night only. The match ended when Hardy went for the Twist of Fate, but Booker T reversed it and hit the scissors kick for the win. Following the match, Booker T performed the Spinaroonie before leaving the ring.\nThe next match was a mixed tag team match which saw John Cena and Dawn Marie face Billy Kidman and Torrie Wilson. After Cena hit Wilson with a bodyslam, Wilson responded by executing a low blow on Cena. Kidman performed the Shooting Star Press on Cena for the win.\nThe third match was between Funaki and Crash. When Crash went for the Oklahoma roll, Funaki blocked it and performed a roll-up to win the match.\nNext was an elimination triple threat match for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship between Jamie Noble, Rey Mysterio and Tajiri. Noble first eliminated Tajiri after executing the Tiger Bomb. When Mysterio went for a victory roll, Noble grabbed Nidia outside the ring and pinned Mysterio to retain the title. After the match, Mysterio attacked Noble, knocking both him and Nidia down, followed by Mysterio hitting the 619 on both of them.\nThe next match saw Reverend D-Von and Ron Simmons face Chuck Palumbo and The Big Valbowski. D-Von grabbed Palumbo's tights and performed a roll-up to win the match.\nThe match that followed was a Kiss My Ass match between Rikishi and Albert. After Albert hit an exposed turnbuckle, Rikishi executed a Banzai Drop on Albert for the win. After the match, Albert refused to kiss Rikishi's ass, resulting in the referee threatening to suspend Albert if he did not. Albert attempted to hit Rikishi with a low blow, but Rikishi regained control and hit the Stink Face on Albert. Following the match, Tazz, Michael Cole and ring announcer Tony Chimel rejoined Rikishi in the ring to dance.\nIn the penultimate match, Chris Benoit and Kurt Angle defended the WWE Tag Team Championship against Los Guerreros (Eddie Guerrero and Chavo Guerrero). The match went back and forth as Benoit and Angle both delivered a series of suplexes to both Guerreros. As Angle prepared to execute the Olympic slam on Eddie, Eddie slipped off his shoulder and shoved Angle into Benoit, causing an argument between the two which knocked the referee down. Eddie applied the Lasso From El Paso on Angle, who countered with an ankle lock before Chavo hit Angle with the championship belt for a near-fall. After Benoit threw Eddie throat first onto the top rope, Angle executed the Olympic slam on Eddie for the win.\nMain event match\nThe main event saw Brock Lesnar defend the WWE Championship against Edge in a handicap match, in which Lesnar teamed with Paul Heyman. The match was evenly controlled by Lesnar and Edge, while Heyman spent most of the match in the corner of the ring. In the end, when Edge attempted to come off the top rope, Lesnar hit Edge in the midsection with a steel chair and executed an F-5 to win the match and retain the title. After the match, Heyman attacked Edge with the chair, before Edge kicked the chair into Heyman's face and hit him with the Edgecution.\nAftermath\nThe 2002 Rebellion would be the final Rebellion event, as WWE discontinued UK-exclusive PPVs after the 2003 Insurrextion PPV and the company began to broadcast Raw and SmackDown! from the UK in 2004.\n|note1   = dark\n|match1  = Bill DeMott defeated Shannon Moore\n|stip1   = Singles match\n|time1   = 8:26\n|match2  = Booker T defeated Matt Hardy\n|stip2   = Singles match\n|time2   = 12:00\n|match3  = Billy Kidman and Torrie Wilson defeated John Cena and Dawn Marie\n|stip3   = Mixed tag team match\n|time3   = 5:22\n|match4  = Funaki defeated Crash\n|stip4   = Singles match\n|time4   = 5:36\n|match5  = Jamie Noble (c) (with Nidia) defeated Rey Mysterio and Tajiri\n|stip5   = Triple threat elimination match for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship\n|time5   = 12:47\n|match6  = Reverend D-Von and Ron Simmons defeated Chuck Palumbo and The Big Valbowski\n|stip6   = Tag team match\n|time6   = 4:06\n|match7  = Rikishi defeated Albert\n|stip7   = Kiss My Ass match\n|time7   = 7:15\n|match8  = Chris Benoit and Kurt Angle (c) defeated Los Guerreros (Eddie and Chavo)\n|stip8   = Tag team match for the WWE Tag Team Championship\n|time8   = 16:35\n|match9  = Brock Lesnar (c) and Paul Heyman defeated Edge\n|stip9   = Handicap match for the WWE Championship\n|time9   = 18:50\n}}\nSee also\n*Professional wrestling in the United Kingdom\nReferences"
