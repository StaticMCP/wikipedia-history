It was the first provider of tertiary education in Warrnambool.\nThe college completed a move from its premises on Timor Street to its current location on Princes Highway near Sherwood Park railway station in 1984, and by 1988 enrolments had grown to 3000 by 1988. The college offered undergraduate and postgraduate course in aquaculture, humanities, commerce, municipal engineering, and applied science, as well as nursing education and teacher training.\nIn 1990 it merged with Deakin University and became its Warrnambool campus.\nIn October 2019 WIAE celebrated its 50th anniversary.\nReferences"
