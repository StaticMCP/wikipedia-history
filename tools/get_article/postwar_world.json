      "text": "# Postwar World\n\nPostwar World () is a Korean-language book by Pak Noja, Russian-Korean scholar and professor of University of Oslo. It discusses the impact of the 2022 to present Russian invasion of Ukraine and its impact on the world order.\nContents\nHe argues that major wars between powerful nations tend to happen every 30 to 50 years, as the dominant world order weakens.\nHe points several historical examples:\n* The Napoleonic Wars led to a two-power system with Britain and Russia at the center. But the Crimean War chipped away at Russia's dominance, allowing Britain to take the lead.\n* Germany's victory in the Franco-Prussian War challenged Britain, but Germany's defeat in World War I also led to Britain losing its top spot to the United States.\n* After World War II, the US and the Soviet Union became the two superpowers during the Cold War. But with the Cold War's end, the US emerged as the sole superpower.\nHowever, Park observes that this US-led unipolar system is being challenged by major non-Western powers like China, Russia, and Iran. This is reflected in ongoing conflicts between major powers, such as the Israel-Palestine conflict, the Nagorno-Karabakh War, and the recent war in Ukraine. Park suggests that these events signal a shift towards a new multipolar world order, beginning around 2022.\nAuthor explains the reason why Anti-War movement in russia is relatively small. Unlike South Korea, where a sense of solidarity developed through the democratization movement after the 1980s, Russia experienced the collapse of the Soviet Union and suddenly introduced capitalism.  As a side effect, it is said that social movements have failed to develop because social trust has decreased and distrust of others has increased.\nIn addition, unlike some Korean \"left\" figures who evaluate the Russia-Ukraine war as \"Russia's self-rescue measure against the West\" and the Putin regime as a \"progressive alternative\" to neoliberalism, he strongly criticizes the unethical nature of the Putin regime. The reality of Russia, where the rights of non-regular workers and platform workers are violated and the oppression of democratic unions is fierce, and the massacres, targeted assassinations, illegal confinement, and forced migration committed by the Putin regime in Ukraine are mentioned. But some Korean leftists have positive views on Putin's Russia. He emphasizeds that these illusions must be abandoned. Nevertheless, the author argues that for the peace on the Korean Peninsula, although Putin's invasion of Ukraine is a clearly crime, South Korea must abandon \"blind obedience to the United States\" and restore diplomatic relations with Russia.\nReviews\nReporter Kim Han-byeol of the JoongAng daily agreed with the author's explanation on why the war continues despite the international sanctions against Russia and why support for the war is high within Russia. But he disagree on the argument that for peace on the Korean Peninsula, \"blind obedience to the United States\" must be abandoned and relations with Russia must be restored.\nYang Seon-ah, a reporter for the Hankyoreh newspaper, said that in this book, the Russian author kindly pointed out the ideological identity and goals of the regime deep in the consciousness of the Putin regime. At the same time, it also reported the current status of Russian civil society and wrote that it well explains why there is no noticeable strong anti-war movement or movement against the regime in Russia even though the surveillance and oppression of the Putin regime continues.\nThe left wing Korean newspaper,  reviewed that this book will serve as a reliable compass for readers who are curious about what the ‘postwar world’ will look like and the path Korea should take.\nReferences\n*"
