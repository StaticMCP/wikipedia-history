The granite monument with bronze plaque is located near the site of the Hotel Hall where the Hoo Hoo organization was founded.  The monument was designed in the Egyptian Revival style by George Zolnay and placed in 1909.  The plaque was originally affixed to Hotel Hall, but was moved to the granite marker after the building was demolished in 1927.  The monument is a rare Arkansas work by Zolnay.\nThe monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Clark County, Arkansas\nReferences\nExternal links"
