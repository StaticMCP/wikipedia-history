Cleveland, Benjamin Jensen, Susan Bryant, and Arnel David.\nSynopsis\nThe book addresses how U.S. national security practitioners approach population-centric warfare and strategic competition in the 21st century. The authors argue that strategic advantage can be achieved from mapping human geography in a connected world, leveraging key relationships, and combining unconventional (special operations) and conventional methods to put adversaries on the horns of a dilemma.\nThe Wavell Room described the book's aim \"as an attempt to raise awareness that the human domain – how we articulate it and conceptualise this idea – should be considered as not only a warfighting function in itself, but one that is crucial for success for any military force.\"\nReferences"
