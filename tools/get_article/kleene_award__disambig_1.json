A paper qualifies as a student paper if each author is a student at the date of the submission. Also eligible are authors who have graduated only recently, provided the submitted paper is based on work carried out when he or she still was a student. The award decision is made by the Program Committee.\nThe award is named after Stephen Cole Kleene, who did pioneering work in the field of logic as related to computer science.\nPast recipients\nPast recipients of the Kleene award are tabulated below.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
