He worked for a Baltimore stationery importer. In an effort to increase their exports, German exporters occasionally combined stationery with toys and other goods. Toys that Schwarz displayed in the window of the store outsold stationery. By 1862 he had switched to selling the toys from his own shop, and in 1870 he moved his business to Manhattan in New York City. He married Caroline Clausen (1841–1904). Together they had four sons and three daughters: Anna Schwarz (1863–1933), Ida Schwarz (1864–1942), Henry Schwarz, George Frederick Schwarz (1868–1931), Emilie Schwarz (1870–1958), H. Marshall Schwarz, and Herbert Ferlando Schwarz (1883–1960).\nFrederick August Otto Schwarz died at his home in Manhattan at 20 East 61st Street.  Schwarz is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery.\nFrederick August Otto Schwarz Jr. is his great grandson.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
