The term \"pahari\" or \"pahadi\" originates from the Hindi word \"pahad\", denotes \"mountain\" or \"hill\", and collectively describes the inhabitants of mountainous areas, including parts of Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand, and northern Pakistan, as well as the Himalayan foothills in Nepal.\nHistorically, pahari communities, including Bangladeshi Pahari groups—though their cultures are not extensively documented—and Indo-Aryan speaking populations developed distinct identities due to their geographical isolation. This separation encouraged the emergence of a unique art forms, folk traditions, and linguistic patterns. However, these cultures also absorbed elements from broader civilizations, including Indo-Aryan, Central Asian, and Tibetan influences.\nGeography and demographics\nPahari culture is influenced by the geography of the region, which consists of hilly terrains, forests, rivers, and remote valleys. The Pahari-speaking communities reside across various ecosystems such as the lush green hills of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand to the rugged terrains of Jammu and Kashmir and northern Pakistan. All these territories and regions, including cross border regions are originally classified as the Indo-European family.\nThe population comprises various ethnic groups, including Kolis, Dogras, Gujjars, Gaddis, Bhutias, and Bakarwals in India, and Pahari pathans and Dards in Pakistan. In Nepal, Pahari culture is practiced through groups like the Gurungs, Thakalis, and Tamangs. Despite differences in language and traditions, these communities share common cultural elements due to their geographic proximity and historical exchanges.\nLanguages\nThe northern regions of the Indian subcontinent are home to a variety of regional languages. In the Jammu region of India, Dogri and Gojri are widely spoken. Dogri, primarily used by the Dogra community, is recognized as one of the 22 scheduled languages of India and enjoys a rich literary tradition. Gojri is spoken by the nomadic Gujjar and Bakarwal communities, who traditionally engage in transhumance, moving between the plains and high-altitude pastures.\nHimachal Pradesh is characterized by several Himachali languages, major of them including Mahasu Pahari (Mahasui) Kulluvi, Mandeali, Kangri, and Chambeali. Mahasu Pahari is spoken in Shimla and Solan district. It is divided into two subgroups Upper Mahasui and Lower Mahasui. Kochi, Sudochi, etc are dialects of Upper Mahasui which are spoken in Upper Shimla district while Keonthali, Baghati, Bagheali, Hinduri, etc are dialects of Lower Mahasui spoken in Lower Shimla district and Solan district. Kulluvi is spoken in the Kullu Valley, while Mandeali is associated with the Mandi district, Kangri is associated with the Kangra district, and Chambeali is native to the Chamba region. These languages belong to the Western Pahari group and are part of the cultural identity of their respective regions.\nIn Uttarakhand, three major languages are prominent—Jaunsari, Kumaoni and Garhwali. Jaunsari is spoken in Jaunsar-Bawar region in Dehradun District, it is closely related to Mahasu Pahari and Sirmauri of Himachal Pradesh. Kumaoni is spoken in the Kumaon division, covering districts such as Almora, Nainital, and Pithoragarh, while Garhwali is native to the Garhwal division, which includes areas like Dehradun, Tehri, and Pauri. Both languages belong to the Central Pahari group.\nIn Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir, Pahari-Pothwari serves as a significant linguistic variety. It is spoken in Azad Kashmir and in parts of northern Pakistan and regions across the Line of Control. The language features multiple dialects and acts as a linguistic link between communities on both sides of the Kashmir border.\nThese languages belong primarily to the Indo-Aryan linguistic family, with local dialects varying significantly between valleys and districts. Although many Pahari languages have not been extensively documented, the government institutions and NGOs made attempts to preserve them through literature, radio broadcasts, and cultural programs.\nArts and crafts\nArt and craft are parts of Pahari culture, with communities known for their distinct styles of handicrafts, weaving, and painting, including Pahari painting. Originating in Himachal Pradesh, Pahari paintings are renowned for their delicate brushwork, colors, and themes drawn from mythology, nature, and folklore. The Kangra school of painting is especially popular for its depictions of Radha and Krishna.\nHandloom weaving such as woolen shawls, carpets, and blankets are commonly produced in the region. Kullu shawls and Chamba rumals (handkerchief) are known for their patterns and use of natural dyes. Communities in the Pahari belt engage in woodwork and pottery such as wood carving and pottery.\nMusic and dance\ngiddha (Pahari giddha)]]\nMusic and dance play a central role in the cultural life of the Pahari regions, within their celebrations, festivals, and rituals. These art forms serve as entertainment as well as linguistic expressions of tradition, emotions, and social unity. The folk music of the region is often centered around themes of nature, love, separation, and devotion. Traditional musical instruments, such as the dhol (a double-sided drum), nagara (a kettledrum), flute, and chimta (a percussion instrument with jingling discs), are commonly used as an traditional musical instruments for folk songs.\nNati, originating from Himachal Pradesh, nati is known for its slow, and rhythmic movements. It is performed during festivals and celebrations, often involving long lines of dancers who move in unison to traditional music.\nMarriage\nThe Pahaṛi communities exhibit a rich variety of marriage customs, encompassing practices such as polyandry, where multiple brothers share a single wife; polygyny, in which one man has several wives; and group marriages that involve a number of husbands and wives. Monogamous unions are also present, though they are less prevalent. In certain Pahari traditions, girls may be married at a young age, sometimes before turning 10, but they generally do not begin living with their husbands until they have reached a suitable level of adulthood. These marriage traditions suggests the complex social dynamics within Pahari culture and demonstrate how these communities navigate their social and environmental circumstances.\nReligion and festivals\nand dancing]]\nThe majority of Pahari communities follow Hinduism, Islam, or Buddhism, although local animistic practices are also prevalent in remote areas. Temples, mosques, and monasteries dot the landscape, often serving as important cultural centers.\nPaharis native of Jammu and Kashmir districts such as Rajouri, and Poonch observe Vaisakhi festival. It is celebrated to mark the harvest season.\nPaharis in the Jammu and Kashmir observe Muslim religious festivals such as Eid.\nCuisine\n(Himachali dish) served with chutney]]\nThe cuisine of the Pahari region is influenced by local ingredients and seasonal availability. Common foods include lentils, rice, vegetables, and dairy products. Traditional dishes vary from region to region.\nPahari murga dish features chicken cooked in a mixture of milk and yogurt, seasoned with spices such as coriander, ginger, garlic, cardamom, cinnamon, and fennel. Paharis also prepare chainsoo, a lentil-based dish from the Garhwal region, Chainsoo is made from black gram (urad dal).\nThe cuisine of the Pahari region includes several dishes classified by the use of local ingredients, aromatic spices, and traditional cooking methods. One such dish is the pahari chicken snack, where pieces of chicken are stir-fried with a paste made from mint, coriander, garlic, and ginger. Green chilies and garam masala is also added to its flavor, which is used during colder months.\nBabru is a variation of poori, prepared by adding baking powder to the dough. The dough is filled with cooked black gram dal, the same lentil used in chainsoo, and then deep-fried for crisp texture. This dish is served  on everyday meals.\nChana madra is another staple dish that involves slow-cooking chickpeas in a yogurt-based gravy. Spices like cardamom, cloves, turmeric, and cumin impart layers of flavor, making it a prominent dish in the region's culinary repertoire.\nShakuli, a traditional papad, is made using refined flour, salt, water, and oil. The mixture is steamed and left to dry in the sun for several days. It is usually served with meals.\nAloo palda is prepared of potatoes, which are simmered in a gravy made from onions, whisked yogurt, and ground rice. The Chamba region serves Chamba Chukh and fried fish, which features freshwater fish coated in a mixture of ginger, garlic, coriander, turmeric, and red chili powder. The fish is dipped in gram flour batter and deep-fried, resulting in a golden dish.\nKullu trout is also a fish preparation process from the Kullu region. The trout is marinated with spices and pan-fried, usually served with hot rice. Traditional tea such as kahwa is infused with saffron, cinnamon, and almonds. People of different cultures including from paharis serve kehew. Siddu is another cuisine prepared by paharis and other natives of Jammu and Kashmir, steamed bread made with wheat flour and stuffed with lentils or vegetables, popular in Himachal Pradesh.\nClothing\nduring inauguration of Atal Tunnel wearing Himachali cap]]\nPahari attire is adapted to the cold climate of the mountains. Woolen garments are common, with men wearing chogas (long cloaks) and women draping shawls or pashmina scarves. Himachali caps, known for visible colors and geometric patterns, are a distinctive feature of the region's attire. In Kashmir, the pheran is a traditional loose gown worn by both men and women during winter.\nSocial structure\nThe social structure of Pahari communities is often organized around villages, with a close-knit community lifestyle. Traditional joint families are common, although nuclear families are becoming more prevalent due to modernization. Agriculture, livestock rearing, and horticulture are the primary sources of livelihood. Some communities, such as the Bakarwals and Gujjars, follow a semi-nomadic lifestyle, migrating with their herds across different altitudes throughout the year.\nThe isolation of many Pahari regions has helped preserve certain traditional customs, although modernization is gradually influencing daily life. Education, tourism, and government initiatives reportedly improved living conditions in some areas, while others continue to face challenges related to infrastructure and employment.\nDecline\nPahari literary works and traditions are at risk of being lost due to socio-cultural, economic, and political factors.\nThe decline of Pahari culture is closely tied to the diminishing use of its dialects, which serve as carriers of the region's folklore, traditions, and modern social behavior. In regions like upper Shimla and the Mahasu area of Himachal Pradesh, these dialects are under significant pressure, primarily because they lack a standardized script and formal documentation. Although the Tankri script exists, limited attempts were made to record the oral traditions or cultural practices of the region. For centuries, the transmission of Pahari dialects, ballads, and folk tales has relied on oral methods, which are now being disrupted by modern lifestyle changes.\nA key factor contributing to the decline is the of people from rural areas to urban centers in search of better employment and educational opportunities. This migration has weakened intergenerational exposure to the native dialects and customs, as individuals become disconnected from their roots. Additionally, economic shifts—such as the decline in the region's apple industry—have driven many families toward the service sector, often requiring them to move away from their ancestral homes. As a result, the younger generation is increasingly adopting Hindi and English as primary languages, particularly in family settings, further eroding the use of Pahari dialects.\nWithout written records or sufficient daily interaction with the language, the cultural bond with Pahari heritage is weakening. As fewer people engage with their native dialects, the risk of cultural erosion grows, leading to the gradual decline of both the language and the traditions it encapsulates.\nPreservation\nPahari culture, like many indigenous cultures, faces challenges from modernization, migration, and environmental changes. The government and non-governmental organizations attempting to preserve traditional arts, languages, and lifestyles. Cultural festivals, museums, and academic research are playing a role in safeguarding the heritage of these communities.\nPahari culture has been recognized under the UNESCO Convention for the safeguarding of the Intangible cultural heritage (2003), focused on preserving the cultural practices of the Pahari communities in the Himalayan region. This recognition has facilitated community-based inventorying processes, allowing local populations to actively document and celebrate their traditions, including folk music, dance, crafts, and languages. The UNESCO's recognition was aimed to safeguard this intangible heritage and to promote cultural exchange and inform policies that support the sustainability and resilience of Pahari cultural practices.\nSee also\n* Takri Script\n* Dogri literature\n* Literature of Kashmir\nReferences"
