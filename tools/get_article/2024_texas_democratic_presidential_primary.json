The contest was held on Super Tuesday alongside primaries in 14 other states and territories.\nBiden won the primary in a landslide, with opposition from smaller candidates. Frankie Lozada won Loving County, the only other county victory by a candidate over Biden alongside Dean Philips' victories in Oklahoma's Cimarron County and in Nebraska's Logan County. Biden's defeat in Loving County was attributed to its low population (having 64 citizens as of the 2020 census), which allowed its only voter to hand the county to a minor candidate named Frankie Lozada. In South Texas, a region with a heavily Hispanic population, Biden significantly underperformed his statewide total, a continuation of his troubles with this demographic from 2020.\nCandidates\nThe filing deadline was December 11, 2023.
