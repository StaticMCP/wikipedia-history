      "text": "# List of United Kingdom by-elections (2010–present)\n\nThis is a list of parliamentary by-elections in the United Kingdom since 2010, with the names of the incumbent and victor and their respective parties. Where seats changed political party at the election, the result is highlighted: blue for a Conservative gain, red for a Labour gain, orange for a Liberal Democrat gain, purple for a UKIP gain and other colours for any other gains.\n, a total of 60 by-elections have been held in this period. The first was held in January 2011 and the most recent in May 2025.\nProcess of resignation from the House of Commons\nWhere the cause of by-election is given as \"resignation\" or \"seeks re-election\", this indicates that the incumbent was appointed on his or her own request to an \"office of profit under the Crown\", either the Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds or the Steward of the Manor of Northstead. Accepting an office of profit under the Crown vacates the member's seat. This process is used because members of the House of Commons are not technically permitted to resign. A member who vacates their seat in this manner may stand for re-election.\nRecall petition\nA recall petition is created by advice of the Speaker of the House of Commons if an MP is suspended from the House for at least 10 sitting days, usually a result of a criminal conviction or breaking Commons Select Committee on Standards conventions. A petition is successful if at least 10 per cent of the constituency's electorate sign the petition. Successful petitions result in the MP vacating the seat, triggering a by-election.\nAs of March 2024, six petitions have been held under the Act, four resulting in by-elections and one being terminated early due to the MP's resignation.\nBy-elections\n2024–present Parliament\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | By-election\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Date\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 120px;\" | Incumbent\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px;\" colspan=2 | Party\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 120px;\" | Winner\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 25px;\" colspan=2 | Party\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 550px;\" | Cause\n|-\n|- bgcolor = b8e9f1\n|Runcorn and Helsby\n| 1 May 2025\n| Mike Amesbury\n|\n| Sarah Pochin\n|\n| Resigned after suspension from Parliament and being liable to a recall petition after a conviction for assault\n|-\n|}\n2019–2024 Parliament\nThere were twenty-three by-elections in the 2019–2024 Parliament, the most by-elections in one parliament since the 1987–1992 Parliament, which had 24. Fourteen by-elections occurred in constituencies previously represented by the governing Conservatives, seven in constituencies represented by Labour, and two in constituencies represented by the SNP. The incumbent MP's party won nine by-elections, including one at Southend West, in which the other major parties did not field candidates. Labour won thirteen by-elections, gaining seven seats from the Conservatives and one from the SNP, but losing one each to the Conservatives and the Workers Party of Britain. The Liberal Democrats gained four seats from the Conservatives, while the Conservatives gained one from Labour. Five by-elections happened due to the deaths of the incumbent MPs, three of whom represented the Conservatives and two Labour.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | By-election\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Date\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 120px;\" | Incumbent\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px;\" colspan=2 | Party\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 120px;\" | Winner\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 25px;\" colspan=2 | Party\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 550px;\" | Cause\n|-\n|- bgcolor = pink\n|Blackpool South\n| 2 May 2024\n| Scott Benton\n|\n| Chris Webb\n|\n| Resigned after being suspended from Parliament for five weeks and being subject to a recall petition for breaching lobbying rules\n|-\n|- bgcolor = #C999A6\n|Rochdale\n| 29 February 2024\n| Tony Lloyd\n|\n| George Galloway\n|\n| Death (leukaemia).\n|- bgcolor = pink\n|Kingswood\n| 15 February 2024\n| Chris Skidmore\n|\n| Damien Egan\n|\n| Resignation in protest of the Conservative government's bill to grant new oil and gas licences.\n|- bgcolor = pink\n|Wellingborough\n| 15 February 2024\n| Peter Bone\n|\n| Gen Kitchen\n|\n| Successful recall petition after allegations of bullying and sexual misconduct.\n|- bgcolor = pink\n|Tamworth\n| 19 October 2023\n| Chris Pincher\n|\n| Sarah Edwards\n|\n| Resigned after losing his appeal to his suspension due to groping allegations.\n|- bgcolor=pink\n|Mid Bedfordshire\n| 19 October 2023\n| Nadine Dorries\n|\n| Alistair Strathern\n|\n| Resigned after being omitted from Boris Johnson's resignation honours list.\n|- bgcolor=\"pink\" lan\n|Rutherglen and Hamilton West\n| 5 October 2023\n| Margaret Ferrier\n|\n| Michael Shanks\n|\n| Recall petition after breaking COVID-19 rules in 2020.\n|-bgcolor=ffcc66\n|Somerton and Frome\n| 20 July 2023\n| David Warburton\n|\n| Sarah Dyke\n|\n| Resigned 14 months after suspension from the Conservative Party pending an investigation.\n|- bgcolor=pink\n|Selby and Ainsty\n| 20 July 2023\n| Nigel Adams\n|\n| Keir Mather\n|\n| Resigned after being omitted from Boris Johnson's resignation honours list.\n|-\n|Uxbridge and South Ruislip\n| 20 July 2023\n| Boris Johnson\n|\n| Steve Tuckwell\n|\n| Resigned after a parliamentary investigation found evidence he misled Parliament over Partygate and he failed to act on warnings about Chris Pincher.

Three were in seats held by Labour, one by the governing Conservatives and one by Sinn Féin, who do not take up their seats in the House of Commons. Four by-elections were won by the incumbent party and the Liberal Democrats won a seat from Conservatives. One by-election was a result of the death of the incumbent MP, who represented Labour. Two by-elections were the result of recall petitions via the provisions of the Recall of MPs Act 2015, the first such in the country.\nAt the dissolution of Parliament in 2019 there were two vacancies: Bassetlaw, caused by the resignation of Labour member John Mann, and Buckingham, caused by the resignation of Speaker John Bercow. With the proximity of the 2019 general election, by-elections were not called for these seats. The Conservatives, the party Bercow had represented before he took up the speakership, regained Buckingham and won Bassetlaw from Labour as well.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | By-election\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Date\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 120px;\" | Incumbent\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px;\" colspan=2 | Party\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 120px;\" | Winner\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 25px;\" colspan=2 | Party\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 550px;\" | Cause\n|-\n|- bgcolor=ffcc66\n| Brecon and Radnorshire\n| 1 August 2019\n|Chris Davies\n|\n|Jane Dodds\n|\n| Recall petition after conviction for false expenses claims.\n|-\n|Peterborough\n| 6 June 2019\n|Fiona Onasanya\n| }}\n|Lisa Forbes\n|\n|Recall petition after conviction for perverting the course of justice, in relation to a motoring offence.\n|-\n|Newport West\n| 4 April 2019\n|Paul Flynn\n|\n|Ruth Jones\n|\n|Death (long illness).\n|-\n|Lewisham East\n| 14 June 2018\n|Heidi Alexander\n|\n|Janet Daby\n|\n|Resignation on appointment as Deputy Mayor of London.\n|-\n|West Tyrone\n| 3 May 2018\n|Barry McElduff\n|\n|Órfhlaith Begley\n|\n|Resignation after a joke about the Kingsmill massacre on social media.\n|}\n2015–2017 Parliament\nThere were ten by-elections in the 2015–2017 Parliament (with a planned by-election in Manchester Gorton cancelled when the 2017 general election was called). Seven were in seats held by Labour, and three by the governing Conservatives. Eight by-elections were won by the incumbent party: the Conservatives won a seat from Labour and lost one to the Liberal Democrats. Three by-elections happened due to the deaths of the incumbent MPs, all of whom represented Labour.\nAt the dissolution of Parliament in 2017, one seat was vacant: that for Manchester Gorton, caused by the death of its Labour member Gerald Kaufman. With the close proximity of the 2017 general election on 8 June, the by-election previously called for 4 May had its writ cancelled by the House of Commons. All but two of the candidates nominated for the by-election then stood at the general election, and Labour held the seat.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | By-election\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Date\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 120px;\" | Incumbent\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px;\" colspan=2 | Party\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 120px;\" | Winner\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px;\" colspan=2 | Party\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 500px;\" | Cause\n|-\n|Stoke-on-Trent Central\n|23 February 2017\n|Tristram Hunt\n|\n|Gareth Snell\n|\n|Resignation to take up his new role as head of the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n|- bgcolor=\"lightblue\"\n|Copeland\n|23 February 2017\n|Jamie Reed\n|\n|Trudy Harrison\n|\n|Resignation to take up his new role in the nuclear power industry.\n|-\n|Sleaford and North Hykeham\n|8 December 2016\n|Stephen Phillips\n|\n|Caroline Johnson\n|\n|Resignation citing irreconcilable differences with the government.\n|- bgcolor=\"ffcc66\"\n|Richmond Park\n|1 December 2016\n|Zac Goldsmith\n|\n|Sarah Olney\n|\n|Sought reelection as an independent in opposition to the government's policy on Heathrow Airport expansion.\n|-\n|Witney\n|20 October 2016\n|David Cameron\n|\n|Robert Courts\n|\n|Resignation as MP two months after resigning as Prime Minister and Leader of Conservative Party.\n|-\n|Batley and Spen\n|20 October 2016\n|Jo Cox\n|\n|Tracy Brabin\n|\n|Death (murder).\n|-\n|Tooting\n|16 June 2016\n|Sadiq Khan\n|\n|Rosena Allin-Khan\n|\n|Resignation upon election as Mayor of London.\n|-\n|Ogmore\n|5 May 2016\n|Huw Irranca-Davies\n|\n|Christopher Elmore\n|\n|Resignation to contest the Welsh Assembly election.\n|-\n|Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough\n|5 May 2016\n|Harry Harpham\n|\n|Gill Furniss\n|\n|Death (cancer).\n|-\n|Oldham West and Royton\n|3 December 2015\n|Michael Meacher\n|\n|Jim McMahon\n|\n|Death (short illness).\n|}\n2010–2015 Parliament\nThere were 21 by-elections in the 2010–2015 Parliament. Fourteen were in constituencies held by Labour, four by the governing Conservatives, one by their coalition partners the Liberal Democrats and two by Sinn Féin, who do not take up their seats in the House of Commons. Seventeen by-elections were won by the incumbent party: Labour won a seat from the Conservatives and lost one to Respect, while UKIP gained two seats from the Conservatives after the incumbent MPs defected to the party and were re-elected. Six by-elections happened due to the deaths of the incumbent MPs, all of whom represented Labour. In all six of those by-elections, Labour retained the seat.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | By-election\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Date\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 120px;\" | Incumbent\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px;\" colspan=2 | Party\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 120px;\" | Winner\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px;\" colspan=2 | Party\n!! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 500px;\" | Cause\n|-bgcolor=\"plum\"\n|Rochester and Strood\n|20 November 2014\n|Mark Reckless\n|\n|Mark Reckless\n|\n|Sought re-election upon change of party allegiance.\n|-\n|Heywood and Middleton\n|9 October 2014\n|Jim Dobbin\n|\n|Liz McInnes\n|\n|Death (acute alcohol toxicity with food aspiration).\n|-bgcolor=\"plum\"\n|Clacton\n|9 October 2014\n|Douglas Carswell\n|\n|Douglas Carswell\n|\n|Sought re-election upon change of party allegiance.\n|-\n|Newark\n|5 June 2014\n|Patrick Mercer\n|\n|Robert Jenrick\n|\n|Resignation after Standards Committee recommended suspension for six months for breaching paid advocacy rules.\n|-\n|Wythenshawe and Sale East\n|13 February 2014\n|Paul Goggins\n|\n|Mike Kane\n|\n|Death (stroke/haemorrhage).\n|-\n|South Shields\n|2 May 2013\n|David Miliband\n|\n|Emma Lewell-Buck\n|\n|Resignation to join International Rescue Committee.\n|-\n|Mid Ulster\n|7 March 2013\n|Martin McGuinness\n|\n|Francie Molloy\n|\n|Resignation to end 'double-jobbing' as MP and Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly.\n|-\n|Eastleigh\n|28 February 2013\n|Chris Huhne\n|\n|Mike Thornton\n|\n|Resignation following pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice.\n|-\n|Croydon North\n|29 November 2012\n|Malcolm Wicks\n|\n| Steve Reed\n|\n|Death (cancer).\n|-\n|Middlesbrough\n|29 November 2012\n|Stuart Bell\n|\n|Andy McDonald\n|\n|Death (cancer).\n|-\n|Rotherham\n|29 November 2012\n|Denis MacShane\n|\n|Sarah Champion\n|\n|Resignation after Standards and Privileges Committee recommended suspension for 12 months for claiming false expenses (United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal).\n|-\n|Cardiff South and Penarth\n|15 November 2012\n|Alun Michael\n|\n|Stephen Doughty\n|\n|Resignation to contest South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner election.\n|- bgcolor=pink\n|Corby\n|15 November 2012\n|Louise Mensch\n|\n|Andy Sawford\n|\n|Resignation for family reasons.\n|-\n|Manchester Central\n|15 November 2012\n|Tony Lloyd\n|\n|Lucy Powell\n|\n|Resignation to contest Greater Manchester Police and Crime Commissioner election.\n|- bgcolor=\"#CEF2E0\"\n|Bradford West\n|29 March 2012\n|Marsha Singh\n|\n|George Galloway\n|\n|Resignation (serious health problems).\n|-\n|Feltham and Heston\n|15 December 2011\n|Alan Keen\n|\n|Seema Malhotra\n|\n|Death (cancer).\n|-\n|Inverclyde\n|30 June 2011\n|David Cairns\n|\n|Iain McKenzie\n|\n|Death (pancreatitis).\n|-\n|Belfast West\n|9 June 2011\n|Gerry Adams\n|\n|Paul Maskey\n|\n|Resignation (to contest Louth in the Irish general election).\n|-\n|Leicester South\n|5 May 2011\n|Peter Soulsby\n|\n|Jon Ashworth\n|\n|Resignation (to contest the mayoralty of Leicester).\n|-\n|Barnsley Central\n|3 March 2011\n|Eric Illsley\n|\n|Dan Jarvis\n|\n|Resignation after pleading guilty to false accounting (United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal).\n|-\n|Oldham East and Saddleworth\n|13 January 2011\n|Phil Woolas\n|\n|Debbie Abrahams\n|\n|Void election under the Representation of the People Act 1983; found to personally have made false statements of fact concerning a candidate.\n|}\nSee also\n* 1986 Northern Ireland by-elections\n* List of by-elections to the Scottish Parliament\n* List of by-elections to the Senedd\n* List of United Kingdom by-elections (1979–2010)\n* List of United Kingdom MPs by seniority (2010–2015)\n* List of United Kingdom MPs by seniority (2015–2017)\n* List of United Kingdom MPs by seniority (2017–2019)\n* List of United Kingdom MPs by seniority (2019–2024)\n* United Kingdom by-election records\nNotes\nReferences"
