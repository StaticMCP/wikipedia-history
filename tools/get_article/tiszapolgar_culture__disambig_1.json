It was located in the territory of present-day Eastern Hungary, Eastern Slovakia, the Transcarpathian region of Ukraine, and Western Romania.\nThe type site Tiszapolgár-Basatanya is a town in northeastern Hungary (Polgár). It is a continuation of the earlier Neolithic Tisza culture. The type site Româneşti is located in the Româneşti-Tomeşti, Timiș County, Romania.\nMost of the information about the Tiszapolgár culture comes from cemeteries; over 150 individual graves have been being excavated at Tiszapolgár-Basatanya. The pottery is unpainted but often polished and frequently decorated.\nIn 2022 a trove of 169 gold rings was found in Romania, in the burial of a high-status woman belonging to the Tiszapolgár culture. The trove was described as \"a sensational find for the period\".\nGenetics\nLipson et al. (2017) found in the remains of five individuals ascribed to the Tiszapolgár culture three G2a2b and a subclade of it, and two I2a and a subclade of it. Of the five samples of mtDNA extracted, three belonged to T21c, one belonged to H26, and one belonged to H1.\nGallery\nFile:Copper axe - Déri Museum IV.1928.184.jpg|Copper axes\nFile:Early Eneolithic earthenware dishes, museum Zrenjanin.jpg|Tiszapolgar ceramics\nFile:Pedestalled goblet, museum Zrenjanin.jpg|Tiszapolgar ceramic vessel\nFile:Early Eneolithic cups, museum Zrenjanin.jpg|Ceramic cups\nFile:Journal.pone.0278116.g009.png|Copper bracelet\nFile:Journal.pone.0278116.g008.png|Copper spiral ornaments\nFile:Journal.pone.0278116.g006.png|Copper beads\nFile:Journal.pone.0278116.g007.png|Copper spiral ornament\nSee also\n* Prehistory of Transylvania\nBibliography\n*\n*\n* Parkinson, William A.
