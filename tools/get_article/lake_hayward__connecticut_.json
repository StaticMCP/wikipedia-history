In 1838, Charles Goodyear, of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, and Nathaniel Hayward were partners in a rubber mill which operated in Massachusetts. In 1847 after breaking away from Goodyear's company, Mr. Hayward established a factory in Colchester, Connecticut to manufacture shoes. Mr. Hayward remained in Colchester, Connecticut, until his death in the 1860s. During the time he was residing in Colchester, he purchased land for hunting along Shaw's pond on the north east edge of East Haddam, Connecticut, where a grist mill was operating. After Nathaniel Hayward's death, Shaw's Pond was renamed Lake Hayward in his honor, as well as Hayward Avenue in Colchester.\nLake Hayward is approximately  long and  wide.
