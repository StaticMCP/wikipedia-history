In 1992, DVRP again called restoration of the Far-Eastern Republic, threatening to form a provisional government and speak at the UN and The Hague if their demands for a referendum on the matter were not met.\nThe party's leader, Igor Cherevkov, was seen In 2009 on a Vladivostok rally, demanding change of power both in Moscow and in Primorye. He later died in 2017.\nReferences"
