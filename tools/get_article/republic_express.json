The train ran between Haydarpaşa Terminal in Istanbul and Ankara. After the Yüksek Hızlı Tren was put into service in 2009, the route of the Republic express was cut from Ankara to Eskişehir. On 31 January 2012, the Republic Express was discontinued due to the rehabilitation of the railway between Istanbul and Arifye and replaced with high speed service.\nGallery\nSögütlücesme kar.jpg|The eastbound train entering Söğütlüçeşme.\nCumhuryet Tuzla.jpg|The eastbound train passing Tuzla station.\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*[http://www.tcdd.gov.tr/home/detail/?id=495 TCDD]"
