It is located in Tartu Parish in the village of Voldi, near the northern end of the village of Äksi where the road Äksi-Kukulinna joins the road Tartu-Jogeva-Aravete.\nHistory\nThe monument to the fallen from the region of Äksi was opened on June 28, 1925. Twenty years later, the figure on the top was demolished. A replica of the statue was made and the monument reopened on August 27, 1989, roughly a year after the government of the Estonian SSR declared its sovereignty from the Soviet Union during the Singing Revolution.\nDescription\nFrom both streets, stone paths lead over a meadow to the left and the front side of the monument. They end at a slight elevation, where four steps each lead to a square surface completely covered with stone slabs. In the middle, there is a three-step pedestal, on which a granite column – which also tapers above with a three-step staircase – stands. On the top, a simple soldier made of bronze is placed; he holds a rifle in his hands.\nOn the front side of the column, there is an oak leaves wreath made of bronze in the lower half. In the upper half, there is a text engraved with the year of the Revolutionary War and a reference to the location:\nOn the back of the column, the names of 34 victims are engraved.\nSources\n* Kultuurimälestiste riiklik register: [https://register.muinas.ee/public.php?menuID=monument&action=view&id=27114 27114 Vabadussõja mälestussammas]\nExternal links\n* [https://register.muinas.ee/public.php?lang=en National Registry of Cultural Monuments]\n*[https://militaryheritagetourism.info/de/military/sites/view/268?0 Monument to the War of Independence in Äksi]"
