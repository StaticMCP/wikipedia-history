It is  northeast of the city of Summerside.  In 2021, its population was 1,812 and is seeing rapid growth thanks in part to a recently opened business park.\nHistory\nThe area was first known as Five Lanes End, as roads from five different communities converged at the point. It was renamed '''Barrett's Cross''' in 1824 after an early settler who established an inn in the area. In 1862, the town was renamed after Kensington Palace in London and it became a town after the Prince Edward Island Railway's mainline from Charlottetown to Summerside curved through the community.  The town's former railyards are now rehabilitated as a tourist venue, with the former Kensington Railway Station designed by architect Charles Benjamin Chappell designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1976.\nDemographics\n}}}}\nIn the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Kensington had a population of  living in  of its  total private dwellings, a change of |1619|1}} from its 2016 population of .
