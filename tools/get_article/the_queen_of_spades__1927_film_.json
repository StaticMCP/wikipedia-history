It is one of many film adaptations of the Russian writer Alexander Pushkin's 1834 short story \"Pikovaya Dama\" (\"The Queen of Spades\") and follows his story closely. It is an example of German Expressionism so prevalent there following the success of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari in 1919. The film's sets were designed by art director Franz Schroedter.\nPlot\nTomski, a Russian soldier, mentions to the other soldiers playing cards with him that, years before, his grandmother, the Countess Tomski, told him that an old sorcerer had bestowed upon her a supernatural secret to winning at cards. Another soldier named Hermann later manages to sneak into the Countess' house and tries to wrest the secret from her. The old woman dies of fright, and later her ghost returns to haunt Hermann, driving him insane.\nCast\nas the Countess Tomski\n* Walter Janssen as Hermann\n* Henri de Vries as Tomski's Uncle\n* Alexander Murski\n* Auguste Prasch-Grevenberg as Hermann's Mother\n* Robert Scholz\n* Ferdinand von Alten\n}}\nReferences\nBibliography\n*  | editor-first1 = Hans-Michael | editor-last1 = Bock | editor-link1 = Hans-Michael Bock | editor-first2 = Tim | editor-last2 = Bergfelder | title = The Concise Cinegraph: Encyclopaedia of German Cinema | publisher = Berghahn Books | year = 2009 | location = New York | isbn = 978-1-57181-655-9 }}\n*  | last1 = Workman | first1 = Christopher | last2 = Howarth | first2 = Troy | title = Tome of Terror: Horror Films of the Silent Era | publisher = Midnight Marquee Press | year = 2016 | location = Baltimore | isbn = 978-1-936168-68-2 }}\nExternal links\n*"
