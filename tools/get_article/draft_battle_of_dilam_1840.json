The battle took place near the town of Dilam in the Najd region, marking one of the key clashes during the early efforts of Faisal bin Turki to reestablish Saudi rule after his return from exile in Egypt.\nBackground\nFollowing the collapse of the First Saudi State in 1818, the region of Najd came under Egyptian occupation as part of the Ottoman Empire’s attempt to consolidate power over Arabia. After the withdrawal of Egyptian forces in the 1830s, Faisal bin Turki sought to reassert control and rebuild the Saudi state. Tensions rose when Ottoman troops re-entered parts of Arabia to challenge Faisal’s growing authority.\nThe Battle\nIn 1840, Ottoman–Egyptian forces advanced from the Hijaz toward central Arabia. Faisal bin Turki mobilized his tribal allies and confronted them near the town of Dilam. The battle resulted in a decisive Saudi victory, forcing Ottoman troops to retreat westward toward Taif and weakening their position in central Arabia.\nAftermath\nThe victory at Dilam consolidated Faisal bin Turki’s leadership and paved the way for the full restoration of the Second Saudi State. It also demonstrated the declining influence of Egyptian authority in the Arabian Peninsula after the withdrawal of Muhammad Ali’s forces under international pressure.\nLegacy\nHistorians view the Battle of Dilam as a turning point in the Saudi–Ottoman conflicts of the 19th century. It reinforced Faisal bin Turki’s legitimacy and marked the beginning of a new era of relative stability in central Arabia under his rule.\nReferences\n* Al-Rasheed, Madawi. A History of Saudi Arabia.
