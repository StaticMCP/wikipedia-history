YTA was managed by a group of student representatives from the United States, Canada, and India. Guatam Jain, at the time a middle school student in California, was inspired to create a philanthropic organization after reading Craig Kielburger's book Free the Children in the summer of 2003.  The organization ceased activities in 2013, and it was de-registered in California in 2015.\nYTA has received seed funding from Youth Venture, a non-profit organization launched by the Ashoka Foundation in 1996.\nPrograms\nYTA hosted two programs intended to spread awareness about social issues affecting children.\nThe Share & Care Club encouraged teenagers to forgo a soda or a pack of chewing gum every month in favor of forwarding the funds to YTA select organizations.\nThe Birthday Club encouraged children to donate to charities on their birthdays.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
