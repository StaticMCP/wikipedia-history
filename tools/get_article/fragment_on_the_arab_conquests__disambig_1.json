The fragment depicts events from the early seventh century conflict between the Byzantines and \"the Arabs of Muhammad\", particularly of the battle of Yarmouk.\nText\nText in square brackets is conjectured, being unreadable in the original. This is clear in the original manuscripts.\nAnalysis\nThe fragments are believed to be contemporary to the events of the Arab conquest of the early 7th century. They also provide one of the earlier date for the battle of Yarmuk as having taken place on 20 August 636, assuming Yarmouk is to be identified with the \"battle of Gabitha\" mentioned in the fragments.\nCook and Crone in Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World take the fragments to indicate that Muhammad was still alive in 636 at the battle of Yarmouk, contradicting the Muslim accounts of his death.\nSee also\n* Thomas the Presbyter\n* Doctrina Jacobi\nReferences"
