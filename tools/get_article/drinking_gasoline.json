All four tracks are featured on the band's \"Gasoline in Your Eye\" videocassette, also issued in 1985. All known copies of the original UK pressing had labels on the wrong discs (ie, side 1 label on side 3, side 2 label on side 4.) It peaked at #71 in the UK.\nReception\nJohn Leland at Spin called it, \"living proof that technology is best entrusted to people who don't know how to use it. Sequencers and drum computers set a simple staccato cadence that the duo uses to carry its fragmented messages. Weird noises and voices cut in and out, irritating your peripheral senses while the hyperkinetic beatbox assaults your central nervous system with its idiot pounding.\" Andy Hurt of Sounds said \"the men of steel say in 33 minutes what they once would have state in a tenth of the time. Disllusioning.\"\nTrack listing\nAll songs were written by Richard H. Kirk and Stephen Mallinder.\nPersonnel\n;Cabaret Voltaire\n* Stephen Mallinder – vocals, bass, production\n* Richard H. Kirk – guitars, keyboards, production\n;Other personnel\n* Mark Tattersall – drums on \"Kino\" and \"Sleepwalking\"\n* Paul White – artwork\nReferences\n# Liner notes"
