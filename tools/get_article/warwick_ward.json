He appeared in more than 60 films between 1919 and 1933. He also produced 19 films between 1931 and 1958. He was born in St. Ives, Cornwall.\nWard was a popular leading man in silent films of the 1920s, although he also played villains. Ward cultivated a debonair but forceful air in his films. Having made his breakthrough in British productions, he found his career impacted by a slum in 1924 that dramatically reduced the number of British films being made. Ward increasingly appeared in Continental productions, particularly German films. His career gradually tailed-off with the arrival of sound film and he began a second career as a film producer. He was an important figure at Associated British and appears in the studio's Elstree Story (1952).\nFilmography\nActor\n* The Silver Lining (1919)\n* Build Thy House (1920)\n* Mary Latimer, Nun (1920)\n* Wuthering Heights (1920)\n* The Manchester Man (1920)\n* The Call of the Road (1920)\n* Handy Andy (1921)\n* The Mayor of Casterbridge (1921)\n* Corinthian Jack (1921)\n* ''Little Meg's Children (1921)\n* Demos (1921)\n* The Golden Dawn (1921)\n* The Diamond Necklace (1921)\n* Belphegor the Mountebank (1921)\n* Tell Your Children (1922)\n* The Lilac Sunbonnet (1922)\n* The Call of the East (1922)\n* Bulldog Drummond (1922)\n* Petticoat Loose (1922)\n* The Hotel Mouse (1923)\n* The Lady Owner (1923)\n* The Great Turf Mystery (1924)\n* The Prude's Fall (1924)\n* Human Desires (1924)\n* Southern Love (1924)\n* The Money Habit (1924)\n* Hurricane Hutch in Many Adventures (1924)\n* Madame Sans-Gene (1925)\n* Varieté (1925)\n* The Wooing of Eve (1926)\n* The Woman Tempted (1926)\n* Lady Harrington (1926)\n* The Famous Woman (1927)\n* Eva and the Grasshopper (1927)\n* The Bordellos of Algiers (1927)\n* Looping the Loop (1928)\n* The White Sheik (1928)\n* Maria Marten (1928)\n* Odette (1928)\n* The Case of Prosecutor M (1928)\n* La venenosa (1928)\n* Eva and the Grasshopper (1928)\n* The Most Beautiful Woman in Paris (1928)\n* After the Verdict (1929)\n* The Wonderful Lies of Nina Petrovna (1929)\n* Her Dark Secret (1929)\n* The Three Kings (1929)\n* The Informer (1929)\n* The Way of Lost Souls (1929)\n* Birds of Prey (1930)\n* L'enfant de l'amour (1930)\n* The Yellow Mask (1930)\n* To Oblige a Lady (1931)\n* Number, Please (1931)\n* Deadlock (1931)\n* A Man of Mayfair (1931)\n* Stamboul (1931)\n* Life Goes On (1932)\n* Blind Spot (1932)\n* The Callbox Mystery (1932)\n* F.P.1 (1933)\n* Kind, ich freu' mich auf Dein Kommen (1933)\nProducer\n* The Man at Six (1931)\n*The Last Chance (1937)\n* French Leave (1937)\n* Saturday Night Revue (1937)\n* Save a Little Sunshine (1938)\n* Night Alone (1938)\n* Almost a Honeymoon (1938)\n* The Gables Mystery (1938)\n* Me and My Pal (1939)\n* Dead Men Are Dangerous (1939)\n* Suspected Person (1942)\n* Women Aren't Angels (1943)\n* Warn That Man (1943)\n* The Man from Morocco (1945)\n* Quiet Weekend (1946)\n* My Brother Jonathan (1948)\n* The Dancing Years (1950)\n* Isn't Life Wonderful!
