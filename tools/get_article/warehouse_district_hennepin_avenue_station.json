This was the original northern terminus of the Blue Line until the new Target Field station opened on November 14, 2009 to provide access to the new Northstar Commuter Rail line.\nThe Warehouse District station is located on 5th Street North, between 1st Avenue North and Hennepin Avenue in downtown Minneapolis. This is a center-platform station with one traffic lane to the south of the platform. Service began at this station when the Blue Line opened on June 26, 2004, and this station is where the opening ceremony was held. The first train departed at 11:00&nbsp;a.m. on that day.\nThe station was designed by ESG Architecture & Design, who also designed the adjacent Nicollet Mall station. To reflect its neighborhood, the station incorporates brickwork and metal columns into the design. The public art installation, Untilted, by Penny Rakoff and Bill McCullam depict labor disputes that occurred in the city in the first half of the 20th century, most notably the Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934. Images are printed onto ten 15.5 × 12.25 inch and two-hundred 2.75 × 2.75 inch tiles.\nThis station is planned to a stop on the METRO E Line.\nThe Target Center, home of the Minnesota Timberwolves, is a block from the station. Although Target Field station is the official stop for the Minnesota Twins' Target Field, Warehouse/Hennepin also sees significant traffic during Twins games.\nNotable places nearby\n* First Avenue & 7th Street Entry\n* Mayo Clinic Square\n* Target Center\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.metrotransit.org/warehouse-district-hennepin-station Metro Transit: Warehouse District/Hennepin Avenue Station]"
