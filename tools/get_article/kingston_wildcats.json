The club acts as \"school of basketball\" for players in the Royal Borough of Kingston and Surrey with teams for players between the ages of 8 and 16.  The club also runs a senior men's team and its practices and home fixtures take place at Chessington School.\nHistory\nThe team was founded in 1983 and played as Tolworth Reckers in the Surrey League until 1994 when as Chessington Wildcats they moved up to the regional NBL Division Three South.  In 1996 they were promoted to the national NBL Division 2.\nThe team changed their name to Kingston Wildcats  in an attempt to improve its profile in 1998 and this coupled with some shrewd recruiting culminated in winning the Division Two Play off final at Wembley beating the highly fancied Manchester Magic. An automatic place in Division One was initially denied due to the capacity at Chessington Sports Centre being below the 500 stipulated for the division.\nIn 2000 to take their place in Division One they moved to Tolworth Recreation Centre.  TRC had hosted top flight basketball in the 70's and 80's when Kingston Kings were one of the best teams in the country, however a large investment by both Kingston Council and Kingston Wildcats was required to get the centre's equipment up to the required standard.\nThe club withdrew from the EBL prior to the 2006/07 season due to financial problems, and returned to the Surrey League.  In 2007/08 the club entered the National Founders Cup, getting to the final where they lost by one point to London Lithuanians.  In 2008/09 a win against King's Lynn Ironwolf in the final of same competition gave the club their second trophy on the national stage.  In 2009/10 an injury depleted team lost in the final once again to London Lithuanians this time by one point.  In 2010/11 Kingston reached the final again, but lost 79 -70 to London Rocco's Raiders.\nSeason-by-season National League records\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n!

We first entered as Chessington Wildcats whilst in a regional league in 1994.  There was then a long break while we were in the full national league.  In 2007 Steve Rich and Mark Bottiglia organised a return to this competition.  Coached by Phil Gunner the team made four finals in a row from 2008 to 2011.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|-bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n! Season\n! Stage Reached\n! Against\n!
