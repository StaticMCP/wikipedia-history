It runs along the Mediterranean coast from the beach at Les Catalans in the city centre to Promenade Georges Pompidou and the Plages du Prado in the south, at the limit with the 8th arrondissement. It was named after US President John Fitzgerald Kennedy the year of his assassination, in 1963.\nDescription\nStarting as a simple path created between 1848 and 1863, the Corniche was later developed into an actual road from 1954 to 1968, when the municipal executive led by Mayor Gaston Defferre decided to expand it. Plans for a tram line, which were first presented in the late 19th century, were rapidly realised, although it was later disbanded to create space for the automobile.\nIt overlooks the Mediterranean and its islands, amongst others the Frioul archipelago. Along it are fishermen's barracks, 19th century villas (most notably the Villa Valmer and its public park), hotels, restaurants (including Le Petit Nice of chef Gérald Passédat), bars and beaches (Plage du Prophète being one of the best known). The Corniche also passes over the Vallon des Auffes and its adjacent Monument aux Morts de l'Armée d'Orient, as well as the Anse de la Fausse Monnaie (Counterfeit Money Cove). As the origin of this name remains unknown, it is used in local tales to embellish the story of the area.\nOn the sea side of the Corniche Kennedy is a bench running nearly its entire  length, with almost no interruption; this made people from Marseille dub it the \"longest bench in the world\". Despite it being forbidden to jump into the sea from the Corniche, it is a popular activity for local residents.\nIn popular culture\nThe boardwalk serves as a meeting place for teenagers in the novel Corniche Kennedy by Maylis de Kerangal. In 2016, the novel was given a film adaptation by the director Dominique Cabrera in an eponym movie. The Corniche can also be seen in the 2014 film The Connection by director Cédric Jimenez. In ‘’Creation Lake: A Novel’’ by Rachel Kushner, the narrator states, ‘’Our hotel, The Richelieu, was not a luxury establishment but happened to be, unlike all the other hotels in this part of Marseille, on the correct side of the Corniche—the waterfront side.’’\nGallery\nFile:Malmousque.JPG|alt=Le Petit Nice|Le Petit Nice\nFile:Vallon des auffes et morts d'orient.JPG|alt=Vallon des Auffes|Vallon des Auffes and Monument aux Morts des Armées d'Orient\nFile:Corniche Kennedy 013.jpg|Le Rhul restaurant\nFile:Plage du Prophete.JPG|Plage du Prophète\nFile:Corniche Kennedy 003.jpg|Fishermen on the Corniche with the Frioul archipelago in the distance\nFile:Corniche Kennedy 006.jpg|Le Peron restaurant\nFile:Pont fausse monnaie marseille.jpg|alt=Counterfeit Money Bridge|Counterfeit Money Bridge\nFile:Marseille Corniche Président John Kennedy.jpg|Broadwalk near the Marégraphe\nReferences"
