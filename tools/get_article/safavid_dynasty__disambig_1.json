Their rule is often considered the beginning of modern Iranian history, as well as one of the gunpowder empires. The Safavid Shah Ismail I established the Twelver denomination of Shi'a Islam as the official religion of the Persian Empire, marking one of the most important turning points in the history of Islam. The Safavid dynasty had its origin in the Safavid Sufi order, which was established in the city of Ardabil in the Iranian Azerbaijan region. It was an Iranian dynasty of Kurdish origin, but during their rule they intermarried with Turkoman, Georgian, Circassian, and Pontic Greek dignitaries; nevertheless, for practical purposes, they were not only Persian-speaking, but also Turkish-speaking and Turkified. From their base in Ardabil, the Safavids established control over parts of Greater Iran and reasserted the Iranian identity of the region, thus becoming the first native dynasty since the Sasanian Empire to establish a national state officially known as Iran.\nThe Safavids ruled from 1501 to 1722 (experiencing a brief restoration from 1729 to 1736 and 1750 to 1773) and, at their height, controlled all of what is now Iran, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Armenia, eastern Georgia, parts of the North Caucasus including Russia, Iraq, Kuwait, and Afghanistan, as well as parts of Turkey, Syria, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.\nDespite their demise in 1736, the legacy that they left behind was the revival of Iran as an economic stronghold between East and West, the establishment of an efficient state and bureaucracy based upon \"checks and balances\", their architectural innovations, and patronage for fine arts. The Safavids have also left their mark down to the present era by establishing Twelver Shi'ism as the state religion of Iran, as well as spreading Shi'a Islam in major parts of the Middle East, Central Asia, Caucasus, Anatolia, the Persian Gulf, and Mesopotamia.\nGenealogy\nThe Safavid Kings themselves claimed to be sayyids, family descendants of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, although many scholars have cast doubt on this claim. There seems now to be a consensus among scholars that the Safavid family hailed from Iranian Kurdistan, and later moved to Iranian Azerbaijan, finally settling in the 11th century CE at Ardabil. Traditional pre-1501 Safavid manuscripts trace the lineage of the Safavids to the Kurdish dignitary, Firuz-Shah Zarrin-Kolah.\nAccording to historians, including Vladimir Minorsky and Roger Savory, the Safavids were Turkish speakers of Iranian origin:\nBy the time of the establishment of the Safavid empire, the members of the family were Turkicized and Turkish-speaking, and some of the Shahs composed poems in their then-native Turkish language. Concurrently, the Shahs themselves also supported Persian literature, poetry and art projects including the grand Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp, while members of the family and some Shahs composed Persian poetry as well.\nThe authority of the Safavids was religiously based, and their claim to legitimacy was founded on being direct male descendants of Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, and regarded by the Shiʻa as the first Imam.\nFurthermore, the dynasty was from the very start thoroughly intermarried with both Pontic Greek as well as Georgian lines. In addition, from the official establishment of the dynasty in 1501, the dynasty would continue to have many intermarriages with both Circassian as well as again Georgian dignitaries, especially with the accession of Tahmasp I.\nSelf-identification and worldview\nThe identity created by the Safavid monarchs and the Persian-speaking urban elites who backed them was based on religion. The Safavids portrayed themselves as the rightful successors of the Twelve Imams in Shia Islam and reinforced this claim by inventing a genealogical link to the third Shia Imam, Husayn ibn Ali, through his supposed marriage to Shahrbanu, the daughter of last Sasanian ruler Yazdegerd III. The Safavids also drew inspiration from earlier times, both historical and mythological. The historical component was the Turco-Mongol tradition, which the Safavids considered themselves the inheritor of. The 14th century warlord Timur influenced their self-image. In his autobiography, Shah Tahmasp I mentioned that he often read the Tarikh-e Teymur. This romanticized past was given renewed attention once the Safavids abandoned their role as warriors.\nThe mythological component was references to pre-Islamic kings and heroes. Zahhak, Fereydun and Jamshid were amongst the figures that Shah Ismail I compared himself to in his poetry. His two sons Sam and Rostam, had traditional Persian names. When Shah Soltan Hoseyn was crowned shah in 1694, Jamshid and Kay Kawad were amongst the pre-Islamic figures mentioned in the khotba speech by the sheykh al-islam of Isfahan, Mohammad Baqer Majlesi. The Tohfat al-alam, a paean to Shah Soltan Hoseyn composed about ten years after his coronation, contains similar themes. Although many dynasties in Iran remembered only fractions of the past, they still aimed to claim a connection to it, a tradition the Safavids continued. The Dutch Iranologist Rudi Matthee adds \"Yet that does not mean that the Safavids were engaged in a systematic and comprehensive mining of the past with the intention of \"retrieving\" an authentic identity\".\nThe identity of the Safavids was broad in certain aspects, consistent with premodern custom. The Safavid dynasty was likely of Kurdish origin, while Shah Ismail I had Pontic Greek descent and spoke a variant of Azerbaijani Turkic. Both Rudi Matthee and English–American Iranologist Dick Davis agree that \"pure identity was not part of Iran's early, multi-ethnic and imperial consciousness and emerged only in Sasanian times\". The Safavids still set themselves apart from others, mainly judging by perceived levels of civilization. Those considered barbarians were not only outsiders but also certain neighboring Muslims, including Arabs, Turks, and Kurds. Texts in Persian portrayed them all as primitive, unpredictable and unreliable. The Safavids considered the truly uncivilized groups to include the Turkmens, Lezgins, Kipchaks, and Uzbeks. This grouping also included the Russians, whom the Iranians reportedly called the \"Uzbeks of Europe\". The Safavid outlook on civilization also included Western Europeans, albeit they were rarely mentioned in Persian texts. These texts make little mention of Europe (Farangestan) as a competitor, threat, or point of comparison, even long after the Safavid dynasty.\nLegitimacy in the Safavid chronicles revolved around support for the shah and his associates, not adherence to the Muslim divine order or ties to the land. In this system, loyalty became the key and nearly exclusive condition for inclusion. The clerical elite in Iran justified this perspective in religious terms, seeing the dynasty and its shah as essential to upholding and safeguarding the divine order.\nSafavid Shahs of Iran\n*Ismail I 1501–1524\n*Tahmasp I 1524–1576\n*Ismail II 1576–1578\n*Mohammad Khodabanda 1578–1587\n*Abbas I 1587–1629\n*Safi 1629–1642\n*Abbas II 1642–1666\n*Suleiman I 1666–1694\n*Soltan Hoseyn 1694–1722\n*Tahmasp II 1722–1732\n*Abbas III 1732–1736\nMothers of Safavid Shahs\nCulture\nThe Safavid family was a literate family from its early origin. There are extant Tati and Persian poetry from Shaykh Safi ad-din Ardabili as well as extant Persian poetry from Shaykh Sadr ad-din. Most of the extant poetry of Shah Ismail I is in Azerbaijani pen-name of Khatai. Sam Mirza, the son of Shah Ismail as well as some later authors assert that Ismail composed poems both in Turkish and Persian but only a few specimens of his Persian verse have survived. A collection of his poems in Azeri were published as a Divan. Shah Tahmasp who has composed poetry in Persian was also a painter, while Shah Abbas II was known as a poet, writing Azerbaijani verses. Sam Mirza, the son of Ismail I was himself a poet and composed his poetry in Persian. He also compiled an anthology of contemporary poetry.\nSafavid Dynasty, Horse and Groom, by Haydar Ali, early 16th century.jpg\nSafavid Dynasty, Woman with a Spray of Flowers, circa 1575 AD.jpg\nSafavid Dynasty, Joseph Enthroned from a Falnama (Book of Omens), circa 1550 AD.jpg\nShirin bathing, being approached by Khusraw, Safavid miniature painting, Iran.jpg\nSee also\n*Khanates of the Caucasus\n*List of Shi'a Muslim dynasties\n*Persianate states\n*Safavid art\n*Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam\n*Trade in Iran's Safavid era\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n* Christoph Marcinkowski (tr.), Persian Historiography and Geography: Bertold Spuler on Major Works Produced in Iran, the Caucasus, Central Asia, India and Early Ottoman Turkey, Singapore: Pustaka Nasional, 2003, .\n* Christoph Marcinkowski (tr., ed.), ''Mirza Rafi‘a's Dastur al-Muluk: A Manual of Later Safavid Administration.
