The company was founded in 1817, and the forge closed in 2005.\nHistory\nEdward Elwell (1783–1869), son of an ironfounder in Walsall, leased a forge in 1817 in Wood Green, Wednesbury, powered by water from the River Tame. There had been a water-powered forge in Wednesbury since at least 1597, when William Whorwood leased a forge owned by William Comberford. It may have been the same site as the forge at Wood Green, which by 1785 was one of four forges in the town.\nEdward Elwell became known as a maker of quality edge tools, such as axes, hoes, shovels and spades. The machinery was powered by water and by steam engines. By 1851 Edward Elwell's son Edward (1814–1857) had taken over management of the company, but he resumed control on his son's death; his grandson Alfred took over when he died in 1869.\nThe company exported to many countries, including America, where it sold large quantities of edge tools during the American Civil War. The company was interested in the welfare of its workforce, converting former workshops into housing, and developing sports facilities. St Paul's Church, Wood Green, completed in 1874, was built by the Elwell family.\nAfter Alfred Elwell's death in 1902 the business became a private limited company. The water wheels were replaced in 1904 by water turbines. In 1967, the company became one of the amalgamated firms of a newly formed company Spearwell Tools Ltd, and this was later taken over by Spear & Jackson. Wednesbury Forge closed in 2005, and the buildings were demolished in 2007.\nReferences"
