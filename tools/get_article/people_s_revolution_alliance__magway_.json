It was formed in response to the 2021 Myanmar coup d'état and is operating in Magway Region, Myanmar.\nHistory\nThe Chief Commander of the PRA, Kyaw Ko Shein, was active in civil organizations that carried out democratic rights before the military took power. Kyaw Ko Shein and local youth held peaceful protests against the military coup in the Magway Region, and the military council violently suppressed it. After the junta's violent clashes and killings, they decided to start an armed resistance.\nOn 7 April 2023, the PRA-Magway fired missiles at the junta-controlled No. 10 Defense Industry factory, burning the factory and killing some soldiers. The operation was supported militarily by the People's Defense Force and Chinland Defense Force groups in the area.\nObjectives\nThe PRA's stated objectives are to end all tyranny, including Myanmar's military dictatorship, to build a federal democratic state based on human existence, dignity freedom, and the right to create one's own destiny, to promote a new society with economic justice, political justice, and social justice.\nReferences"
