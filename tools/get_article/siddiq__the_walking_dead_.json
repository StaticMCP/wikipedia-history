With the arrival of a group of outsiders to their doors after they were rescued by Judith from a herd of walkers, Siddiq quickly treated the wound that one of the newcomers had done to the head and subsequently attended the meeting convened at the church of the place to decide its destiny within the walls. Convinced that the newcomers were not a problem for anyone, Siddiq agreed to allow them to stay in the community; although he eventually changed his mind after Michonne unmasked the team leader about her dark past and the knife she had hidden in her belt. In “Stradivarius”, when Michonne decided to escort the newcomers to Hilltop instead of abandoning them to her fate, Siddiq accompanied the woman on her trip and maintained that she had to allow Magna and her companions to remain in Alexandria, but it made it clear that only I was helping them for their daughter. After arriving at the site where Magna's group was previously camping, the outsiders were sad to discover that the place was razed by walkers and that none of their other companions managed to survive, and while they collected some supplements from the ground, Siddiq found a flute that belonged to Luke and confessed to having played the instrument during his youth. After spending the night in an old warehouse, Siddiq tried to convince Michonne to change his mind about traveling with them to Hilltop and finally informed him that Maggie and her baby had left the community to found other establishments with Georgie. Before being able to explain what happened, the group was ambushed by several walkers and Siddiq along with the rest of his companions defended themselves from the creatures and escaped terrified of the place.

Later, when Rosita proposed to Gabriel to talk about the baby that was to come, Siddiq and the woman waited for the priest on the porch of his house and as the future father of the creature, he decided to join the meeting to take part in the future plans they had with the new blessing of their lives.\nIn \"The Calm Before\", Siddiq is among the group of Hilltop residents who are kidnapped by Alpha, the leader of the group The Whisperers, and is the only survivor of the ensuing massacre.

After observing how a satellite fell in the vicinity of the space and collapsed within the territory of the Whispers, Siddiq decided to lend his help to extinguish the forest fire that had caused the disaster and had no choice but to cross the border that his enemies had marked.\nIn \"Ghosts,\" when Alexandria was attacked by herds of walkers for forty-nine hours, Siddiq helped defend the community of creatures along with the rest of his companions and subsequently attended the meeting convened by Michonne to discuss what was happening, although he suffered again of hallucinations that forced him to retire. His disorder in turn prevented him from attending to the wound that Carol had done while defending himself against some walkers and his problems were eventually discovered by Dante, who told him that he understood what was going on and enjoyed a drink together thus encouraging their friendship.\nIn \"Silence the Whisperers,\" more hallucinations about what happened in the stable began to dominate Siddiq's mind and prevented him from paying full attention to the scene of the crime committed by Negan against one of the bandits in his attempt to save Lydia from her abusers; heading quickly to the infirmary and immersing his face against icy water. After stabilizing, Siddiq was part of the council meeting to discuss Negan's fate and was one of those who voted in favor of forgiving the prisoner's life instead proposing to focus all his attention against the true enemy that was stalking them, but when the vote was in a tie with Gabriel being the last one left to vote, Siddiq had no choice but to wait for the priest to give his final testimony and thus apply the measures against Negan.\nIn \"What It Always Is,\" when Negan escaped from his cell, Siddiq accompanied Daryl in the search for the prisoner and took advantage of the fact that they were near Hilltop to go to the community and rest. Offering his help in the infirmary of the place, Siddiq noticed the bad state in which Ezekiel was and after examining it he discovered a large lump in his neck due to thyroid cancer that was affecting him, and despite proposing treatments that could help him out from the terrible situation he is facing, Ezekiel opposed and chose to accept his destiny.

In the fight that follows, Dante strangles Siddiq to death from behind to protect his secret.\nIn the mid-season finale \"The World Before,\" Dante reflects on the events leading up to Siddiq's murder before finally going to prevent him from reanimating. However, Dante only gets as far as closing Siddiq's eyes before they are interrupted by Rosita, who quickly grows suspicious of Dante's behavior. As Rosita and Dante enter into a struggle, Siddiq reanimates and is drawn by the cries of his daughter. However, before the zombified Siddiq can hurt Coco, Rosita manages to overpower Dante and puts Siddiq down by stabbing him in the head with Dante's knife. Siddiq is subsequently given a funeral attended by his friends and family. Later, an enraged Gabriel, who loved Siddiq like a brother, kills Dante in his cell.\nIn \"What We Become,\" Siddiq reappears in Michonne's hallucinations, where Siddiq tells her to imagine the sun. At first Michonne is glad to see him, but he blames her for his murder and also begins to blame her for the deaths of Rick and Carl. Siddiq then asks what will happen to his family when he is gone. Michonne starts crying and tells Siddiq that he is her family, but the latter responds \"this is how it feels to be your family\".\nDevelopment and reception\nSiddiq is portrayed by Avi Nash on The Walking Dead television series. Greg Nicotero explained the significance of Siddiq's first appearance in the eighth season premiere \"Mercy\" to Entertainment Weekly, and why Rick is heard saying \"My mercy prevails over my wrath\" in one of the layered timelines of the episode: \"you hear that line in the episode, because Siddiq says it to Carl in the gas station when he's talking about his mom and he was talking about the traveler and all this stuff, and it's Siddiq that says that he's basically quoting something that his mom said. So when you broke it down that way there might even be four timelines because if you think about Rick at Glenn and Abraham's graves, and then you think about Rick on the back of the truck when he's doing his speech so yeah, we always do that because it always gives the audience an opportunity to put some of these timelines together for themselves.\"\nThe Hollywood Reporter asked actor Chandler Riggs if his character Carl died a hero in the episode \"How It's Gotta Be\" for sacrificing his life to save Siddiq - someone he did not know - and Riggs replied: \"I definitely think so. It wasn't saving Siddiq, it was saving all of Alexandria. He was the reason that they all got to safety — because he stalled the Saviors and [prevented] them from finding any Alexandrians with his smoke grenades and he led them away from everyone and saved everyone. It was a pretty cool way to go out.\" Riggs also joked with Entertainment Weekly that Carl's death \"was all Siddiq's mom's fault\".\nIn the season finale \"Wrath\", when Siddiq finally tells Rick that Carl was bitten by a walker while trying to honor Siddiq's mother, Erik Kain of Forbes commented that \"The Siddiq and Rick scene should [have] happened two episodes ago. It was fine, I guess, but felt really out of place.\"\nHe was promoted to series regular for season 9.\nReferences"
