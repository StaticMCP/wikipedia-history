She proceeded to make the full announcement herself. The next day it was reported that Reeves was not intoxicated and was hurt by Osbourne's behaviour. The incident has since been ascribed to an autocue malfunction, but Reeves said in his defence that he was trying to read the autocue screen, but he couldn't read it because Osbourne was pushing him out of the way.\nArctic Monkeys\nWhen the Arctic Monkeys took to the stage to collect their award for 'Best British Album', the band were dressed up in traditional English country and hunting outfits and even took a plastic duck to the stage with them. During the acceptance speech, they made a derogatory joke about the Brits School which forced producers to pull it from the television broadcast.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/2008 Brit Awards 2008 at Brits.co.uk]\n*[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/news/newsbeat/080114_brits.shtml BBC Radio 1]"
