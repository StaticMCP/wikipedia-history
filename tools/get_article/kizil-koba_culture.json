The culture is represented by the materials from the Kizil-Koba cave in the foothills of the Crimean Mountains in the East Crimea.\nThe similarity between the Kizil-Koba culture and the Koban culture created by the Cimmerian tribes in the Caucasus leads to suppose that the Kizil-Koba culture emerged in the Caucasus.\nKizil-Koba Cave\nKizil-Koba (The Krasnaya Cave -literally translates as the Red Cave) is the biggest grotto of the Crimea and one of the karst cave that appear on the limestone in Eastern Europe.\nSee also\n* History of Crimea\n* List of caves\nReferences"
