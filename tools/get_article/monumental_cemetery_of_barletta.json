The project was commissioned to Sponzilli from Barletta, head of the civil engineering, in 1843. The new cemetery was inaugurated in the second half of the 1800s.\nMonumental sites\n]]\nIn addition to the approximately 80 votive aedicules of particular artistic value, three important monuments can be identified:\nGreek Cemetery\nSince 1500, Barletta has always boasted a large Greek community, with two Orthodox worship: the church of San Giorgio and the church of the Greeks.. The Greek cemetery dates back to the mid-1800s.\nPyramidal Church\nAt the beginning the pyramid was supposed to act as an entrance to the cemetery, but the original project was overturned many times. In 1860 it was inaugurated as a cemetery church.\nShrine of the Slavs\nDesigned by Dušan Džamonja in 1969, it is one of the four spomeniks of Italy\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.spomenikdatabase.org/post/10-amazing-yugoslav-era-monuments-built-around-the-world Spomenik Database]\n*[http://www.cnj.it/PARTIGIANI/JUGOSLAVI_IN_ITALIA/appen.htm Partisan of Balkan]\n*[https://fondoambiente.it/luoghi/cimitero-greco-ortodosso-barletta?ldc Greek cemetery of Barletta]\n*[https://www.barlettanews24.it/attualita/16778/la-storia-del-cimitero-di-barletta-tra-i-primi-in-puglia History of cemetery of Barletta]\n*[https://iicbelgrado.esteri.it/it/gli_eventi/calendario/brevi-cenni-storici-dell-ossario/ Belgrado event of cemetery of Barletta]"
