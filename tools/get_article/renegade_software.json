Their stated goal was to give game developers more artistic freedom and more recognition. One of the first games released by Renegade Software was Magic Pockets, for which they had struck a deal with music publisher Rhythm King to include a Betty Boo song in the game.\nLater Renegade also published games by other developers and went on as one of the successful independent publishers of its time, until it was acquired by Time Warner in 1995 to become \"Warner Interactive Entertainment Ltd\", still publishing under the Renegade label. before being merged with the European arm of Time Warner Interactive in the same year, rebranding as Warner Interactive Europe. Subsequently, in November 1996, the entirety of Warner Interactive Europe (including Northampton-based Time Warner Interactive Ltd, and Renegade itself) was sold to GT Interactive and the Renegade label ceased to exist.\nGames\nSource:\n* Gods (1991)\n* Magic Pockets (1991)\n* Cadaver: The Payoff (1991)\n* Sensible Soccer: European Champions (1992)\n* Sensible Soccer: European Champions: 92/93 Edition (1992)\n* Fire & Ice (1992)\n* The Chaos Engine (1993)\n* Uridium 2 (1993)\n* Turrican 3 (1993)\n* Elfmania (1994)\n* International Sensible Soccer (1994)\n* ''Ruff 'n' Tumble (1994)\n* Sensible World of Soccer (1994)\n* Flight of the Amazon Queen (1995)\n* Harpoon Classic (1995)\n* Virocop (1995)\n* Sensible World of Soccer '96/'97 (1996)\n* Sensible World of Soccer: European Championship Edition (1996)\n* The Chaos Engine 2 (1996)\n* Z'' (1996)\nReferences"
