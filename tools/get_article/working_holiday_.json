It is a collection of tracks by American indie bands which were originally released on a series of 12 7\" singles by Simple Machines as part of the Working Holiday monthly record club starting in December 1992. Each song was intended to commemorate a holiday in the month it was released. Subscribers to the record club were also sent a calendar showing the holidays and a specially made 7\" single-carrying box.\nA limited edition of the Working Holiday! album contained a second disc of live performances from a three-day live music festival held in January 1994 at The Black Cat in Washington D.C. to celebrate the completion of the Working Holiday series. The 20-page CD booklet with all album editions contains a detailed and illustrated account of the record club project and the live music festival.\nTrack listing\nDisc 1 - 7\"s on Holiday!\n#11:59 It's January - Scrawl\n#Tin Foil Star - Versus\n#Abraham Lincoln - Lungfish\n#James Brown - The Tinklers\n#Ides - Codeine\n#Working Holiday - The Coctails\n#Roll Away the Stone - Eggs\n#Christmas Trees Everywhere - Jonny Cohen\n#Saints Above - Veronica Lake\n#Where Is Our Reason - My Dad Is Dead\n#Kiss Me - Rastro!\n#Another Child Bride - Nothing Painted Blue\n#Indie - Lois\n#If You Hurt Me - Small Factory\n#Kidding on the Square - Tsunami\n#Falk - Jawbox\n#Back to School - Crackerbash\n#Under the Ground - Grifters\n#Coalmine #666 - Crain\n#A Penny for the Guy - Pitchblende\n#Night of the Chill Blue - Superchunk\n#Winter's Come - Caterpillar\nDisc 2 - Live tracks from the Working Holiday Weekend with MC Jason Noble\n#Hello!\n#Big Puffy Girl Handwriting - Danielle Howle\n#Fun Fun Fun in the Sun Sun Sun - The Tinklers\n#Not Coe - David Greenberger\n#Whoopsy Daisy - The Coctails\n#Broken Heart of a Neutron Star - Crain\n#Flax - Pitchblende\n#Why am I so tired all the time? - Eggs\n#Might - Archers of Loaf\n#From the Curve - Superchunk\n#Newspaper - Tsunami\n#Rubberman - Jonny Cohen\n#The Girl with the Carrot Skin - Bricks\n#Lady Putney - Caterpillar\n#Big Things, Little Things - Rodan\n#Sleeping through the Jane Pratt Show - Franklin Bruno\n#Hacienda - Versus\nArtwork by Archer Prewitt.
