Established by The Ray and Diana Harryhausen Foundation based in Edinburgh, the awards aim to recognise the achievements of contemporary animators, whilst celebrating the ongoing legacy of stop-motion animator Ray Harryhausen. The award statues are cast by Arch Bronze, who also sculpt the Laurence Olivier Awards.\nOverview\nThe awards were originated by Foundation trustee John Walsh. They were announced at San Diego Comic Con 2021, with The Beat commenting that \"...exciting things are happening at the Harryhausen Foundation, and the new film award announcement is sure to make an impact in the animation world.\" Walsh told the Puppet Place blog that he hoped that the awards would promote Ray's legacy alongside identifying new talent coming into the animation industry.\nRay Harryhausen's daughter Vanessa Harryhausen told Starburst Magazine that her father had always valued the educational value of his films, and hoped that the awards would continue to inspire new generations of artists. The winners of the inaugural awards ceremony were announced online on June 29th 2022, marking Ray Harryhausen's birthday. The first physical awards ceremony took place at The Cameo, Edinburgh on the same date in 2023, followed by a 60th anniversary screening of Jason and the Argonauts.\nCategories\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Category\n!Year Awarded\n!Winners\n|-\n|Best Feature Film Animation\n|2022\n2023\n2024\n|Mad God (2021, Director Phil Tippett)\nPinocchio (2022, Directors Guillermo del Toro & Mark Gustafson)\nThe Inventor (2023, Director Jim Capobianco)\n|-\n|The Spirit of Harryhausen Award\n|2023\n2024\n|Epic Tails (2022, Tat Productions)\nThe Primevals (2024, Director David Allen\n|-\n|Best Short Film Animation\n|2022\n2023\n2024\n|Only a Child (2021, Director Simone Giampaolo)\nPuppet Story (2022, Director Park Se Hong)\nA Bear Named Wojtek (2023, Director Ian Gardner)\n|-\n|Best Commercial Film Animation\n|2022\n|Save Ralph (2021, Arch Model Studio)\n|-\n|Best Television Animation\n|2022\n|Scream Street 2.12 'The Noisy Place' (Factory)\n|-\n|Best Student Film Animation\n|2022\n2023\n2024\n|Absolution Parsin (2022, Director Jack Nop)\nProvisions (2022, Director Kehyal Roy-Meighoo)\nSeaglass (2024, Director Cheryl Blake)\n|-\n|'''Best Children's Film Animation\n|2022\n2023\n2024\n|Battle of Gastropoda (2022, Director Kristian Harding)\nThe Speech of Txai Surui (2023)\nJoint winners: Heroic Quest (2024, Director: Benjamin Holmes), & Sandra v/s Vivora (2024,Director Lisa Holmes)\n|-\n|Honorary Award\n|2022\n|John Walsh\n|-\n|Harryhausen Hall of Fame Award'''\n|2022\n2023\n2024\n|Phil Tippett\nJanet Stevens\nBridget Appleby\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.harryhausenawards.com/ Ray Harryhausen Awards official website]\n* [https://www.rayharryhausen.com/ray-harryhausen-awards/ The Ray and Diana Harryhausen Foundation]"
