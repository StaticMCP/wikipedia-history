It was headquartered in Moscow, with regional branches reporting to the central agency. Each regional branch was assigned an area of responsibility including defense enterprises and organizations located in several oblasts or republics.\nIn July 1979, the Minsk Regional Inspection for Complex Technical Control was founded. The Minsk Special Center of the USSR State Technical Commission was set up on the premises of the regional inspection in August 1989.\nDuring the establishment of statehood in Belarus the country's leadership took measures to secure information protection in all spheres of activities of the state for the sake of ensuring the national security.\nOn 12 January 1993, by the resolution of the government the Minsk Special Center of the USSR State Technical Commission was reorganized into the State Center for Information Security under the Defense Ministry of the Republic of Belarus. The new body was tasked with ensuring the protection of classified data by technical means in government agencies, at enterprises, in institutions and organizations during the research, development, manufacturing, and operation of armaments, military hardware, automated control systems, electronic computing machines used for the defense and security of the country. In October 1994, by the relevant decree of the President of the Republic of Belarus control over the State Center for Information Security was transferred to the Security Council of the Republic of Belarus.\nIn November 2000, the State Center for Information Security under the Security Council of the Republic of Belarus was converted into the State Center for Information Security under the President of the Republic of Belarus.  On 21 April 2008, in line with the relevant presidential decree the State Center for Information Security was converted into The Operational and Analytical Center under the Aegis of the President of the Republic of Belarus  (OAC).\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://oac.gov.by/ OAC] in Russian\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130821073151/http://oac.gov.by/info/history.html OAC history] in Russian\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160305105937/http://law.by/main.aspx?guid=76293 Better regulations for electronic interactive games in Belarus]\n* [http://www.osce.org/fom/73455 Commentary on recent documents of the Republic of Belarus regarding use of the national segment of the Internet]"
