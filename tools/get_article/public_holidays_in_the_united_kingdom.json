      "text": "# Public holidays in the United Kingdom\n\nIn the United Kingdom, public holidays are days on which most businesses and non-essential services are closed. Many retail businesses (especially the larger ones) do open on some of the public holidays. There are restrictions on trading on Sundays, Easter and Christmas Day in England and Wales and on New Year's Day and Christmas Day in Scotland. Public holidays defined by statute are called \"bank holidays\", but this term can also be used to include common law holidays, which are held by convention. The term \"public holidays\" can refer exclusively to common law holidays.\nThere is no automatic right to paid time off on these days, or any right to a holiday at all, but banks close and the majority of the working population is granted time off work or extra pay for working on these days, depending on their contracts. Before 1980, collective agreements widely included public holidays as part of a standard entitlement to time off. Schedule 11 of the Employment Protection Act 1975 enabled mandatory extension of collective agreements across sectors, but this was repealed with effect from 1980, and the Fair Wages Resolution 1946 (affecting public sector contracts) was repealed with effect from 1983. This meant there was no effective legal mechanism for holidays until the Working Time Regulations 1998, based on the Working Time Directive restored 20 and then 28 days paid holidays - however employers do not need to grant paid holidays on public holiday days.\nThere are eight bank holidays a year in England and Wales, nine in Scotland and ten in Northern Ireland. Additional days have been allocated for special events, such as royal weddings, coronations, and jubilees. There are seven bank holidays common to all jurisdictions: New Year's Day, Good Friday, the early May bank holiday (May Day), the Spring bank holiday, the Summer bank holiday, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day. Easter Monday is a bank holiday in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, but not in Scotland. In Northern Ireland, Saint Patrick's Day and Orangemen's Day are also bank holidays. In Scotland, 2 January and St Andrew's Day are bank holidays. The Summer bank holiday varies according to jurisdiction: in Scotland, it is on the first Monday in August, and in the rest of the United Kingdom, it is on the last Monday in August.\nHistory\nIn England, Wales and Northern Ireland, Good Friday and Christmas Day are common law holidays, having been customary holidays since time immemorial.\nThe first official bank holidays were named in the Bank Holidays Act 1871, introduced by Liberal politician and banker Sir John Lubbock. Under the Act, \"no person was compelled to make any payment or to do any act upon a bank holiday which he would not be compelled to do or make on Christmas Day or Good Friday, and the making of a payment or the doing of an act on the following day was equivalent to doing it on the holiday\". People were so grateful that some called the first bank holidays ''St&nbsp;Lubbock's Days for a while.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ England, Wales and Ireland\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Bank holidays 1871\n|-\n| Easter Monday\n|-\n| Whit Monday\n|-\n| First Monday in August\n|-\n| 26 December (or 27th if 26th is a Sunday)\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Scotland\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Bank holidays 1871\n|-\n| New Year's Day\n|-\n| Good Friday\n|-\n| First Monday in May\n|-\n| First Monday in August\n|-\n| Christmas Day\n|}\nThe Act did not include Good Friday and Christmas Day as bank holidays in England, Wales, or Ireland because they were already recognised as common law holidays.\nIn 1903, the Bank Holiday (Ireland) Act added 17 March, Saint Patrick's Day, as a bank holiday in Ireland only. New Year's Day did not become a bank holiday in England, Wales and Northern Ireland until 1 January 1974. Boxing Day did not become a bank holiday in Scotland until 1974.\nStarting in 1965, experimentally, the August Bank Holiday weekend was observed at the end of August \"to give a lead in extending British holidays over a longer summer period\". Each year's date was announced in Parliament on an ad hoc basis, to the despair of the calendar and diary publishing trade. The rule seems to have been to select the weekend of the last Saturday in August, so that in 1968 and 1969 Bank Holiday Monday actually fell in September.\n| amendments            =\n| repealing_legislation =\n| related_legislation   =\n| status                = amended\n| legislation_history   =\n| theyworkforyou        =\n| millbankhansard       =\n| original_text         = https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/80/contents/enacted\n| revised_text          =\n| use_new_UK-LEG        = yes\n| UK-LEG_title          = Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971\n| collapsed             = yes\n}}\nA century after the 1871 act, the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971 (c. 80), which currently regulates bank holidays in the UK, was passed. The majority of the current bank holidays were specified in the 1971 Act: however New Year's Day and May Day were not introduced throughout the whole of the UK until 1974 and 1978 respectively. The date of the August bank holiday was changed from the first Monday in August to the last Monday in August in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (but not in Scotland), and the Whitsun bank holiday (Whit Monday) was replaced by the Late Spring Bank Holiday, fixed as the last Monday in May. From 1978, the final Monday of May in Scotland (a statutory holiday in the rest of the UK) and the first Monday in May in the rest of the UK (a statutory holiday in Scotland) have been proclaimed as bank holidays.\nIn January 2007, the St Andrew's Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Act 2007 was given royal assent, making 30 November (or the following Monday if 30 November falls on a weekend) a bank holiday in Scotland.\nFuture\nThere are calls for extra public holidays on the patron saints' days in England (for St.&nbsp;George's Day), and Wales (for St.&nbsp;David's Day). For example, in 2018 the Labour Party announced it would make those days bank holidays if elected. The same year, an online petition to the Prime Minister as to Wales received 3,577 signatures.\nIn 2009, it was reported that St&nbsp;Piran's Day (patron saint of Cornwall) on 5 March is already given as an unofficial day off to many government and other workers in the county. It is suggested that a move from the May bank holiday to a St&nbsp;Piran's Day bank holiday in Cornwall would benefit the Cornish economy by £20–35&nbsp;million.\nThe number of holidays in the UK is relatively small compared to many other European countries. However, direct comparison is inaccurate since the 'substitute day' scheme of deferment does not apply in most European countries, where holidays that coincide with a weekend (29% of fixed-date holidays) are \"lost\". In fact, the average number of non-weekend holidays in such countries is only marginally higher (and in some cases lower) than the UK. Worth mentioning is that public holidays in Europe which fall on Thursday or Tuesday typically become \"puente\" or \"bridge\" four-day or even six-day extended holiday weekends as people tend to use one or two days from their holiday entitlement to take off Monday and/or Friday.\nAfter the election of the coalition government in May 2010, the Department of Culture, Media and Sport launched a pre-consultation in 2011 which included the suggestion of moving the May Day Bank Holiday to October, to be a \"UK&nbsp;Day\" or \"Trafalgar Day\" (21&nbsp;October) or to St&nbsp;David's Day and St&nbsp; George's Day.\nLegal basis\nBank holidays are established in several ways:\n* by statute (statutory holidays) – Holidays specifically listed in the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971.\n* by royal proclamation – Under the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971, bank holidays are proclaimed each year by the legal device of a royal proclamation.\n* by convention (common law holidays) - Holidays established in common law (not applicable in Scotland)\nRoyal proclamation is also used to move bank holidays that would otherwise fall on a weekend and to create extra one-off bank holidays for special occasions. The Act does not provide for a bank holiday to be suppressed by royal proclamation without appointing another day in its place. In this way, public holidays are not \"lost\" in years when they coincide with weekends. These deferred bank holiday days are termed a \"bank holiday in lieu\" of the typical anniversary date. In the legislation they are known as \"substitute days\". The movement of the St Andrew's Day Scottish holiday to the nearest Monday when 30&nbsp;November is a weekend day is statutory and does not require a proclamation. Bank holidays falling on a weekend are always moved to a later date, not an earlier one.\nWorkers' rights\nAlthough there is no statutory right for workers to take paid leave on bank holidays, where paid leave is given (either because the business is closed or for other reasons), the bank holiday can count towards the minimum statutory holiday entitlement. Likewise, if people are required to work on a bank holiday, there is no statutory right to an enhanced pay rate nor to a day off in lieu, although many employers do give either or both. Any rights in this respect depend on the person's contract of employment. The statutory minimum paid holidays is 28&nbsp;days (or 5.6 weeks) a year under the Working Time Regulations 1998 (including any bank holidays or public holidays that are taken).\nDates in England, Northern Ireland, and Wales\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- Holiday dates in England, Northern Ireland, and Wales\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Date !! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Occasion\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Type !! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Notes\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\"| Region\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| England and Wales !! scope=\"col\"| Northern Ireland\n|-\n| 1/2/3 January || New Year's Day || Proclaimed || Falls on 1 January unless this is a Saturday or Sunday. 1 January was not a statutory holiday before 1974.

The legislation does not specify a name for the holiday, merely when it occurs. It normally falls on the last Monday in May, but in 2002, 2012 and 2022 it was moved a few days into June and was followed by an extra bank holiday, in order to create a four-day jubilee weekend in celebration of Elizabeth&nbsp;II's 50, 60 and 70 years of reign.

This was as a result of the decision to move the holiday to the end of the month, and the nearest Monday being taken. The current definition was introduced in 1971.\n* In 1995 the early May bank holiday was moved to Monday 8&nbsp;May to commemorate the 50th&nbsp;anniversary of VE&nbsp;Day.\n* In 2002, there was a special holiday on Monday 3&nbsp;June to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth&nbsp;II. The Spring Bank Holiday was moved from 27&nbsp;May to 4&nbsp;June to create a four-day weekend.\n* In 2012, there was a special holiday on Tuesday 5&nbsp;June to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth&nbsp;II. The Spring Bank Holiday moved to Monday 4 June to create a four-day weekend.\n* In 2020, the early May bank holiday originally set for Monday 4&nbsp;May was moved to Friday 8&nbsp;May to commemorate the 75th anniversary of VE&nbsp;Day.\n* In 2022, there was a special holiday on Friday 3&nbsp;June to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II. The Spring Bank Holiday was moved to Thursday 2&nbsp;June to create a four-day weekend.\nDates in Scotland\nNational bank holidays\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- National bank holidays in Scotland\n! scope=\"col\"| Date !! scope=\"col\"| Occasion\n! scope=\"col\"| Type !! scope=\"col\"| Notes\n|-\n| 1/2/4 January || New Year's Day || Statutory or proclaimed || 1 January by statute when this is not a Saturday or Sunday. 2 January by statute when this is a Monday. 4&nbsp;January by proclamation when this is a Tuesday.\n|-\n| 2/3/4 January || New Year Holiday || Statutory or proclaimed || 2 January by statute when this is not a Saturday or Sunday. 3 January by statute when this a Monday, or by proclamation when this is a Tuesday. 4&nbsp;January by proclamation when this is a Monday.\n|-\n| Variable || Good Friday || Statutory ||\n|-\n| First Monday in May || Early May bank holiday || Statutory ||\n|-\n| Last Monday in May || Spring bank holiday || Proclaimed ||\n|-\n| First Monday in August || Summer bank holiday || Statutory || The Summer bank holiday remains on its original date in Scotland.

Some of these may be taken in lieu of statutory holidays while others may be additional holidays, although many companies, including Royal Mail, do not follow all the holidays listed below, and many swap between English and local holidays.\nSince Easter 1996 the Scottish clearing banks have harmonised the days on which they are closed with those in England and Wales and are therefore closed on Easter Monday and the last Monday in August (rather than the first). This has resulted in a number of local authorities creating a public holiday on Easter Monday. Previously Easter Monday had not been a public holiday in Scotland.\nThere have been protests about banks opening on 2 January since this decision was taken. This has resulted in many banks now providing only a limited service on 2 January, with most members of staff still entitled to the holiday.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- Local holidays in Scotland\n! scope=\"col\"| Date !! scope=\"col\"| Name !! scope=\"col\"| Major towns/cities (not an exhaustive list)\n|-\n| 1 January || New Year's Day ||rowspan=\"2\"| all\n|-\n| 2 January\n| 2 January\n|-\n| Wednesday after last Tuesday in January || Day after Up Helly Aa fire festival|| Shetland\n|-\n| First Monday in February || Winter Holiday || Inverness\n|-\n| First Monday in March || || Inverness\n|-\n| Last Monday in March || || Lochaber\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| Easter holiday (variable) || Good Friday || Ayr, Dumfries and Galloway, East Dunbartonshire, Edinburgh, Falkirk, Inverclyde, Kilmarnock, Paisley, Stirling, South Lanarkshire, West Dunbartonshire\n|-\n| Easter Monday || Ayr, Edinburgh, Falkirk, East Dunbartonshire, Glasgow, Inverclyde, Kilmarnock, North Lanarkshire, Paisley, Stirling, South Lanarkshire, West Dunbartonshire\n|-\n| First Monday in April ||rowspan=\"5\"| Spring Holiday || Carnoustie and Monifieth area, Dundee, Fife, Scottish Borders, Inverness, Perth\n|-\n| Second Monday in April || Angus, except Carnoustie and Monifieth area, Elgin\n|-\n| Third Monday in April, or preceding week if would otherwise coincide with Easter Monday || Edinburgh\n|-\n| Monday in April; date varies from year to year || Aberdeen\n|-\n| Last Monday in April || Inverclyde\n|-\n| First Monday in May || Labour Day or Early May Bank Holiday || all\n|-\n| Tuesday after first Monday in May ||rowspan=\"5\"| Victoria Day (*)/Spring Holiday || Clydebank, Stirling\n|-\n| Last Monday strictly before 24 May|| Edinburgh*\n|-\n| Fourth Monday in May || Perth*\n|-\n| Last Monday in May || Ayr, Dundee*, East Dunbartonshire, Glasgow, North Lanarkshire, Paisley*, South Lanarkshire\n|-\n| First Monday in June || Galashiels, Inverclyde, Fife\n|-\n| Tuesday after second Thursday in June || Linlithgow Marches ||Linlithgow\n|-\n| Second Thursday in June || Lanimer Day || Lanark area only\n|-\n| Last Monday in June ||rowspan=\"3\"| Fair Holiday || Elgin\n|-\n| Saturday preceding first Monday in July || Edinburgh\n|-\n| First Monday in July || Falkirk, Inverness\n|-\n| First Friday in July || Braw Lads Gathering || Galashiels\n|-\n| Second Monday in July ||rowspan=\"5\"| Fair Holiday || Aberdeen\n|-\n| Third Monday in July || Arbroath, Fife, East Dunbartonshire, Glasgow, North Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire except Lanark\n|-\n| Fourth Friday in July || Scottish Borders\n|-\n| Last Monday in July || Dundee\n|-\n| First Monday in August || Paisley\n|-\n| First Monday in September || Late Summer Holiday || Elgin, Inverclyde\n|-\n| Second Monday in September || Battle of Stirling Bridge || Falkirk, Perth, Stirling\n|-\n| Third Friday in September ||rowspan=\"2\"| Ayr Gold Cup || Ayr, Kilmarnock\n|-\n| Monday after third Friday in September || Ayr, Kilmarnock\n|-\n| Third Monday in September ||rowspan=\"5\"| Autumn Holiday || Edinburgh\n|-\n| Last Monday in September || Aberdeen, Angus except Carnoustie and Monifieth area, East Dunbartonshire, Glasgow, North Lanarkshire, Paisley, South Lanarkshire, West Dunbartonshire\n|-\n| First Monday in October || Carnoustie and Monifieth area, Dundee, Inverness, Perth\n|-\n| Second Monday in October || Scottish Borders\n|-\n| Third Monday in October || Elgin, Fife\n|-\n| First Monday in November || Samhain holiday || Inverness\n|-\n| 30 November || St. Andrew's Day To be taken in lieu of one of the other statutory holidays at discretion of individual companies/authorities. || an official holiday in Angus, Fife, Scottish Borders\n|}\nSpecial holidays\n* During the sterling crisis of 1968, Prime Minister Harold Wilson convened a meeting of the privy council in the early hours of 14&nbsp;March to declare 15&nbsp;March a bank holiday. This allowed the UK government to close the London gold market to stem the losses being suffered by the British pound. It was this meeting that triggered the resignation of Foreign Secretary George Brown.\n* 14 November 1973 was made a special bank holiday to celebrate the wedding of Princess Anne and Mark Phillips.\n* 7 June 1977 was made a special bank holiday as part of the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth&nbsp;II.\n* The wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer on 29 July 1981 resulted in an extra bank holiday.\n* 31 December 1999 was a one-off bank holiday as part of the Millennium celebrations.\n* In 2002, there was a special holiday on Monday 3&nbsp;June to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth&nbsp;II. The Spring Bank Holiday was moved from 27&nbsp;May to 4&nbsp;June to create a four-day weekend.\n* Friday 29 April 2011 was a special bank holiday to celebrate the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton.\n* In 2012, there was a special holiday on Tuesday 5&nbsp;June to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth&nbsp;II. Therefore, to create a four-day weekend, the Spring Bank Holiday that would usually have occurred at the end of May was moved to Monday 4&nbsp;June.\n*In 2022, there was a special holiday on Friday 3&nbsp;June to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth&nbsp;II. Therefore, to create a four-day weekend, the Spring Bank Holiday that would usually occur at the end of May was moved to Thursday 2&nbsp;June. An additional public holiday was declared for Monday 19&nbsp;September, the day of the State Funeral of Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;II.\n* Monday 8 May 2023 was an additional public holiday to commemorate the Coronation of King Charles&nbsp;III and Queen Camilla.\nSee also\n* UK labour law\n* List of holidays by country\n* Public and bank holidays in Scotland\n* Public holidays in Gibraltar\n* Public holidays in Guernsey\n* Public holidays in Jersey\n* Public holidays in the Isle of Man\n* Public holidays in Anguilla\n* Public holidays in Bermuda\n* Public holidays in the British Virgin Islands\n* Public holidays in the Cayman Islands\n* Public holidays in the Falkland Islands\n* Public holidays in Montserrat\n* Public holidays in the Pitcairn Islands\n* Public holidays in Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha\n* Public holidays in the Turks and Caicos Islands\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/Employees/Timeoffandholidays/DG_073741 Bank Holidays and British Summer Time]\n* [https://www.mygov.scot/scotland-bank-holidays/ Scotland Bank Holidays - Scottish Government]"
