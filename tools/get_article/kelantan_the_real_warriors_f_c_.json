The club plays in the Malaysia Super League, the top-flight football league of Malaysia, after being promoted from the Malaysia Premier League in 2022. The club was founded in 2016 as MPKB-BRI UbeS Football Club (Kota Bharu Municipal Council – Islamic City Youth and Sports Secretariat), before being reformed as Kelantan United in 2017, Kelantan Darul Naim and Kelantan The Real Warriors in 2024 and 2025 respectively. Their home stadium is Sultan Muhammad IV Stadium which has a capacity of 30,000.\nHistory\nFormation and early years\nThe club was previously known as Majlis Perbandaran Kota Bharu-Bandar Raya Islam Urusetia Belia and Sukan Negeri Kelantan Football Club (MPKB-BRI UBeS FC). They entered the Malaysian football competition in 2016 when the club was accepted to compete in the FAM League. The club finished the season at the eight place.\nKelantan United\nFor the 2017 season, they participated in the Malaysia FA Cup.

In 2023, the club was promoted to the Malaysia Super League for the first time in their history. On 2 June 2023, Kelantan United recorded their first win in the top flight against city rivals Kelantan, with the score of 4–1.\nKelantan Darul Naim\nIn the 2024–25 Malaysia Super League season, Kelantan United was rebranded as Kelantan Darul Naim Football Club. The club's president Rozi Muhammad said the rebranding comes from the management's desire to unite Kelantan supporters under one banner. In November 2024, the club travelled to India and took part in the 2024 edition of the Sikkim Gold Cup.\nThe Real Warriors\nIn 2025, they were rebranded again, this time as Kelantan The Real Warriors Football Club.
