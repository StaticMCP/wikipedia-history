The inscriptions closely resemble the Ramesseum king list, which is a similar scene of Ramesses II, which was used as a template for the scenes here.\nThe scene shows Ramesses III participating in the ceremonies of the Festival of Min where statues of ancestral kings are carried in an elaborate procession to make offerings to Min. It contains 16 cartouches with the names of nine pharaohs divided into two parts.\nThe sparse outline of the scene was published by Vivant Denon in 1802, who was part of Napoleon's expedition to Egypt in 1798 to 1801, which published a slightly more detailed scene in 1809.\nThirty years later, the complete scene including the cartouches of the kings was published by John Gardner Wilkinson in 1837, followed by Champollion and Lepsius. All the 19th-century editions contain omissions and errors, but in 1940 the Epigraphic Survey published the definitive (and complete) rendering of the scenes.\nThe kings mentioned in the list\nThe scene is divided in two parts, on the left side, 7 statues of ancestors are being carried in a procession. The right side is led by nine kings.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"90%\"\n|+The rulers mentioned in the list\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Left procession\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Right procession\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;font-weight:bold\" | #\n| style=\"text-align: center;font-weight:bold\" | Pharaoh\n| style=\"text-align: center;font-weight:bold\" | Inscription (throne name)\n| style=\"text-align: center;font-weight:bold\" | #\n| style=\"text-align: center;font-weight:bold\" | Pharaoh\n| style=\"text-align: center;font-weight:bold\" | Inscription (throne name)\n|-\n| 1\n| Ramesses III\n| Usermaatre-meryamun\n| 8\n| Ramesses III\n| Usermaatre-meryamun\n|-\n| 2\n| Setnakhte\n| Userkhaure-meryamun\n| 9\n| Setnakhte\n| Userkhaure-meryamun\n|-\n| 3\n| Ramesses II\n| Usermaatre-setepenre\n| 10\n| Seti II\n| Userkheperure-setepenre\n|-\n| 4\n| Merenptah\n| Baenre-meryamun\n| 11\n| Merenptah\n| Baenre-meryamun\n|-\n| 5\n| Ramesses III\n| Usermaatre-meryamun\n| 12\n| Ramesses II\n| Usermaatre-setepenre\n|-\n| 6\n| Setnakhte\n| Userkhaure-meryamun\n| 13\n| Seti I\n| Menmaatre\n|-\n| 7\n| Seti II\n| Userkheperure-setepenre\n| 14\n| Ramesses I\n| Menpehtyre\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"3\" |\n| 15\n| Horemheb\n| Djeserkheperure-setepenre\n|-\n| 16\n| Amenhotep III\n| Nebmaatre\n|}\nIt remains in situ on the eastern second pylon in the second court, in the upper register on the eastern wall. It's also seen by some as an addition to the Abydos King List, as the Medinet Habu list contains some Rammasside pharaohs who reigned after the Abydos list was made.\nSee also\n* Abydos King List (Seti I)\n* Abydos King List (Ramesses II)\n* Manetho King List\n* Karnak King List\n* Palermo Stone\n* Saqqara Tablet\n* Turin King List\n* Ramesseum king list\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*[https://archive.org/details/KennethA.KitchenRamessideInscriptionsVol5]Kenneth A.
