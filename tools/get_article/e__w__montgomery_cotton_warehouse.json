Montgomery Cotton Warehouse, also known as the Greenville Bonded Cotton Warehouse and now the Elements West Apartments, is a historic cotton warehouse located in Greenville, South Carolina. The original section was built about 1928. Following the property's purchase in 1933 by Edmund Warren Montgomery, a significant cotton merchant and broker in upstate South Carolina from the early-to-mid-20th century, three additions were completed.  The two-story, brick building measures 553 feet long and 60 feet deep, and has 68,000 square feet in seven bays.\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.\nReferences"
