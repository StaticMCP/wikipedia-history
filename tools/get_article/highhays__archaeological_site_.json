The excavations revealed a previously unknown suburb of Kilkenny which appeared to be the location of an industrial site dedicated to pottery. Amongst the 9,000 finds were a firing kiln, sherds of pottery, a ring-brooch, an ear scoop and decorated buckles. The type of pottery produced there has since been attributed the name Highhays Ware. It is found throughout Kilkenny city as well as other towns and castle sites in the southeast of Ireland, along the Rivers Nore and Barrow.\nThe 2022 publication \"Highhays, Kilkenny: A Medieval Pottery Production Centre in South-East Ireland\" describes the excavation and finds in much detail.\nGallery\nFile:Castleinch Jug.png|Castleinch Jug, on display in Rothe House\nFurther information\n* Highhays, Kilkenny: A Medieval Pottery Production Centre in South-East Ireland, Oxbow Press, 2022.
