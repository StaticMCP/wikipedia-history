      "text": "# Inner Mongolian independence movement\n\nThe Inner Mongolian independence movement (), also known as the Southern Mongolian independence movement (), is a movement for the independence of Inner Mongolia (also known as Southern Mongolia) and the political separation of Inner Mongolia from the People's Republic of China. It is part of an Inner Mongolian nationalist movement.\nDemchugdongrub was a key figure in the Inner Mongolian independence movement.\nThe movement is led primarily by three popular organizations: the Inner Mongolian People's Party, a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization; the Southern Mongolian Democratic Alliance, and the Mongolian Liberal Union Party, led by Temtsiltu Shobtsood (Xi Haiming), the Southern Mongolian Democratic Alliance, led by Hada; and the Mongolian Liberal Union Party, led by Olhunud Daichin. The stated goals of all three organizations are the secession of Inner Mongolia from the People's Republic of China, and either the establishment of an independent Inner Mongolian state or the unification of Inner Mongolia with \"Outer Mongolia\", i.e. the State of Mongolia. The Chinese government asserts that there is active Inner Mongolian separatism, and the 2020 Inner Mongolia protests and a few other specific examples have been noted. In 2018, Chinese state media outlet Economic Daily reported that a man surnamed Jiang was the first in Inner Mongolia to be sentenced on charges of terrorism in the region, although it was not specified what cause he was supporting.\nSee also\n* Mengjiang\n* Pan-Mongolism\n* List of active separatist movements in Asia\n* Secession in China\n* Separatist movements of China\n* Affirmative action in China\n* Human rights of ethnic minorities in China\nReferences"
