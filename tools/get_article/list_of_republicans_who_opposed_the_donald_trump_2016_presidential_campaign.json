In the same study, establishment Republicans were found to be more likely to support Trump's candidacy, the opposite of what most observers, including Donald Trump himself, claimed.\nSee also\n* Newspaper endorsements in the United States presidential election, 2016\n* Protests against Donald Trump\n* Republican and conservative support for Barack Obama in 2008\n* Republican In Name Only\n* Stop Trump movement\n* List of Democrats who opposed the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign\n* List of former Trump administration officials who endorsed Joe Biden\n* List of Republicans who opposed the Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign\n* List of Republicans who opposed the Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign\n* List of Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign endorsements\n* List of Evan McMullin 2016 presidential campaign endorsements\n* List of Gary Johnson 2016 presidential campaign endorsements\n* List of Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign non-political endorsements\n* List of Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign political endorsements\n* List of Jill Stein 2016 presidential campaign endorsements\nNotes\nReferences"
