She was wrecked at Lisbon in 1814.\nCareer\nQueen Charlotte made only one voyage across the Atlantic. Queen Charlotte, Mudge, master, left Falmouth on 11 March 1808. She was at Halifax between 21 and 30 April. She was then at New York between 7 May and 10 June. On her return voyage she was at Halifax again between 16 and 23 June, and she arrived back at Falmouth on 13 July.[https://www.rfrajola.com/mercury/British%20Packet%20NA%201755-17840%20with%20Mailboats.pdf Olenkiewicz, John S.
