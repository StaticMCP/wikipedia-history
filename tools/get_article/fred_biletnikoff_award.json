(TQCF), an independent not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organization. The award was created in 1994. The award is named for Fred Biletnikoff, who played college football at Florida State and professionally with the Oakland Raiders and Montreal Alouettes. Any NCAA Division I FBS player who catches the football through a forward pass is eligible to be selected as the award winner, though in practice, and as it has been awarded to a player at that position every year, it is considered a de facto honor for the sport's most outstanding wide receiver. Tight end Kyle Pitts of the University of Florida was one of 3 Biletnikoff Award finalists in 2020.\nA national selection committee consisting of over 600 journalists, commentators, broadcasters, and former players selects the award winner. No member of the board of trustees of the foundation has a vote. The foundation's charitable mission is provision of scholarships to North Florida high school seniors who have overcome significant challenges to achieve at the highest levels, with 320 scholarships having been awarded through 2024 with total benefits of well over 5 million dollars.\nIn December 2022, founding trustee and chairman Walter Manley II and past chairman Mark Ryan announced a goal of $10 million in aggregate to be awarded by 2030.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!bgcolor=\"#e5e5e5\"| Year !! bgcolor=\"#e5e5e5\"| Winner !! bgcolor=\"#e5e5e5\"| Team\n!Ref\n|-\n| 1994 ||  || Penn State\n|\n|-\n| 1995 ||  || Ohio State\n|\n|-\n| 1996 ||  || Wyoming\n|\n|-\n| 1997 ||  || Marshall\n|\n|-\n| 1998 ||  || Louisiana Tech\n|\n|-\n| 1999 ||  || Stanford\n|\n|-\n| 2000 ||  || Pittsburgh\n|\n|-\n| 2001 ||  || LSU\n|\n|-\n| 2002 ||  || Michigan State\n|\n|-\n| 2003 ||  || Pittsburgh\n|\n|-\n| 2004 ||  || Michigan\n|\n|-\n| 2005 ||  || Oregon State\n|\n|-\n| 2006 ||  || Georgia Tech\n|\n|-\n| 2007 || rowspan=\"2\" |  || rowspan=\"2\" | Texas Tech\n|\n|-\n| 2008\n|\n|-\n| 2009 ||  || Notre Dame\n|\n|-\n| 2010 || rowspan=\"2\" |  || rowspan=\"2\" | Oklahoma State\n|\n|-\n| 2011\n|\n|-\n| 2012 ||  || USC\n|\n|-\n| 2013 ||  || Oregon State\n|\n|-\n| 2014 ||  || Alabama\n|\n|-\n| 2015 ||  || Baylor\n|\n|-\n| 2016\n|\n| Oklahoma\n|\n|-\n| 2017\n|\n| Oklahoma State\n|\n|-\n| 2018\n| Jerry Jeudy\n| Alabama\n|\n|-\n| 2019\n| Ja'Marr Chase\n| LSU\n|\n|-\n| 2020\n| DeVonta Smith\n| Alabama\n|\n|-\n| 2021\n| Jordan Addison\n| Pittsburgh\n|\n|-\n| 2022\n| Jalin Hyatt\n| Tennessee\n|\n|-\n| 2023\n| Marvin Harrison Jr.\n| Ohio State\n|\n|-\n| 2024\n| Travis Hunter\n| Colorado\n|\n|}\nReferences\n;General\n*\n;Footnotes\nExternal links\n*\n* Scholarships:https://biletnikoffaward.com/about-scholarships/\n* National Selection Committee: https://biletnikoffaward.com/voters/\n* Candidate Eligibility, Watch List Inclusion & Voting Criteria: https://biletnikoffaward.com/criteria/\n* 2019 Banquet: https://biletnikoffaward.com/2019-banquet-video/\n* 2021 Banquet: https://biletnikoffaward.com/2021-banquet-video/"
