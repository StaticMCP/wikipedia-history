The Directors Guild of Canada which, in another first, was presenting CFA awards, voiced what was on everyone's minds: the fear that a poorly-presented show would cause irreparable harm to the CFAs and the industry. After much debate, it was decided that they would go ahead with the live broadcast, which aired coast-to-coast on CBC Television and was hosted by comedian Rich Little.\nThe telecast was plagued by technical difficulties and criticism was harsh, with journalists and industry members calling it \"the poor-man's Oscars\". It would be several years before the ceremony was telecast again.\nWinners\nFilms\n*Film of the Year: The Mills of the Gods: Viet Nam — Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Douglas Leiterman, Beryl Fox producers, Beryl Fox director\n*Feature Film: Le Festin des morts (Mission of Fear) — National Film Board of Canada, André Belleau producer, Fernand Dansereau director\n*Arts and Experimental: Syrinx — National Film Board of Canada, Ryan Larkin director\n*TV Information: Bernard Shaw: Who the Devil Was He? — Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Vincent Tovell producer\n::Stravinsky — National Film Board of Canada, Roman Kroitor producer, Wolf Koenig and Roman Kroitor directors\n::Ladies and Gentlemen...
