(ABBI) is an organization dedicated to the registration of bucking bulls and establishing the American Bucking Bull as a documented breed of cattle. American Bucking Bull, Inc., is owned by the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) and stock contractors. The organization created a breed registry and manages the registration and certification of American Bucking Bulls. It also keeps records of other breeds of bulls, some of which died out many years ago. It is the largest organization performing these functions. It maintains a genetic DNA database, manages bucking bull pedigrees and encourages the growth of the breed. ABBI also holds competitions for bucking bulls ages two through four. It also has its own magazine, the American Bucking Bull.\nHistory\nPeople first began to breed cattle specifically to produce bulls that were good at bucking in rodeos in the 1970s.  An early pioneer was Bob Wilfong. He came from a background of ranching and rodeo. \"Raising bucking stock was just kind of a deal to play with\", Wilfong said. Wilfong's whole breeding program was to buy cattle and see if they could buck.\nThe idea of registering bucking bulls originated in 1992 with Bob Tallman and Sammy Andrews. Tallman is a fifth-generation cattleman and a ProRodeo Hall of Fame rodeo announcer. Andrews is a stock contractor who owned Bodacious, a bull infamous for his severe injuries to riders, especially Tuff Hedeman. After the incident in which Bodacious injured Hedeman and the bull's subsequent retirement, there was a significant cultural shift in the sport of bull riding. Originally, the riders were the focus of the sport, but Bodacious made bulls themselves into popular athletes; many fans knew the name of Bodacious but not that of the injured rider.\nAfter Bodacious became so popular with fans, his popularity expanded to other bulls, such as Bushwacker, Dillinger, and Little Yellow Jacket. Stock contractors started making money from all types of activities, not just bucking them: marketing, futurities, licensing, and breeding. This shift resulted in duplicity in the breeding business: certain breeders were attempting to scam others by pretending they had young bulls who were the progeny of notable sires such as Oscar, Red Rock, and Pacific Bell, when in fact the heritage of these bulls was not as advertised; this practice resulted in distrust of pedigree claims. Andrews was sure that \"a credible market\" required \"a way to certify bloodlines\", and Tallman proposed the use of DNA parentage testing, which he used in his own breeding program.\nThus, in 1994, Tallman created the Rodeo Stock Registry (RSR) as a genetic database. The intent was to allow breeders to track the pedigrees of notable bucking bulls, and thus prove parentage of offspring. When the RSR became available, breeders such as Wilfong started using it to register his bulls and manage his program. He used the RSR to calculate that he had 16 different bloodlines in his pedigrees.\n\"Bob Tallman literally created an industry by introducing DNA testing and organized competitions for bucking bulls,\" stated Randy Schmutz, general manager of United Bucking Bulls, Inc. (UBBI). \"His ideas and thinking were questioned and highly criticized by many, but he stuck to it. It's because of Tallman that we have what we call the 'bucking bull breeding industry' today!\"\nIn 1996, Tallman and a partner started Buckers, Inc., a business using DNA testing to verify a bull's parentage. Bodacious became the test case for this model: \"every stock contractor in the business wanted a bull as rank [difficult to ride] as Bodacious—especially if they were certain the calf was a legitimate son.\" Buckers, Inc. registered and certified records of Bodacious' progeny that could be documented via semen collection. They also started collecting other top bulls' semen. By 2003, Buckers had 11,000 cattle registered. Then-CEO Randy Bernard at the PBR was so impressed that he bought out Buckers and renamed the company to American Bucking Bull, Inc. He sold 19 shares of ABBI for $25,000 each.\nThe first bucking bull registered by the ABBI was Bodacious, also the first bull in the Buckers, Inc., database. His ABBI registration number is 1000078. When Bodacious died in 2000, he had 23 sons who had professional \"outs\", meaning that they had bucked in events sanctioned by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) or the PBR. This earned him \"the top spot on the all-time producing sire's list\" at that time. The RSR, transferred to American Bucking Bull, Inc., becoming the heart of the organization. The DNA registry database grew from 20,000 livestock registrations to over 180,000 in a little over a decade.\nAt that point, in 2003, other investors were invited to buy stock in the ABBI. Thousands of dollars were invested, which the PBR matched. Then, the first ABBI Finals were held in 2004 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Growth of the ABBI increased the popularity of breeding cattle specifically for their traits as bucking stock, and organized livestock breeding exploded for both genders of cattle.\nThe ABBI developed futurity programs for the bulls as it grew. A futurity is an event for younger bulls where the bull is judged solely on his own performance. There is no rider. In the PBR's initial years, the most a bull could earn at any event was the $20,000 prize for being selected the World Champion Bull. Today in the ABBI, registered bulls can earn up to $500,000 in events between ages two and four. These futurity events caused the ABBI to grow at accelerated rates.\nOrganizational structure\nThe American Bucking Bull organization is owned half by the Professional Bull Riders. Stock contractors own shares that comprise the other half of ownership. The organization is run by a board of directors representing all parties. Their mission is to register and promote the breed of the American Bucking Bull.  The genetic DNA registry that American Bucking Bull manages is the largest registry in the world for bucking bulls. Many of the most notable bulls in modern bull riding, including Bushwacker, Black Pearl, Long John, Bruiser, and Shepherd Hills Tested are now of the American Bucking Bull breed and developed their talents via ABBI event competition.\nThe PBR itself was founded in 1992 as a rodeo organization that only promoted bull riding. Since then, this focus has dramatically changed the way sports broadcasting handles rodeo. As of 2018, the PBR brings in millions per year in commercial sponsorships and reaches half a billion viewers, establishing bull riding as a mainstream sport. As of 2018, the Premier Series sponsor is Monster Energy, and PBR bull riding events are featured on CBS Sports Network and CBS networks. At the PBR World Finals, riders compete for a $1 million bonus. For bulls, the ABBI World Finals Classic takes place at the PBR World Finals. There 3- to 4-year-old bulls compete to win a $250,000 prize.\nIndustry breeders use the ABBI registry to help bulls to retain value and prove their abilities. One example was the Rosser family, who owned the Flying U Rodeo Company. In search of DNA to document parentage, Rosser mentioned one time that a bull skeleton was dug up to recover a bone fragment. It was DNA tested and used to prove that a notable bull's calves were sired as stated, showing that the genetic data kept by the registry was of value. The registry also promotes how important the maternal side is in producing the most rank bulls. For example, the cow who produced 2009 ABBI World Champion Finals Classic Bull Black Pearl sold in 2011 for $100,000. She also produced at least three other futurity money winners.\nPrior to the ABBI, the best PBR bulls earned their owners money through a stud career, simply as long as parentage verified. With the ABBI, the legitimacy provided by a breed registry boosted the price of the semen used for artificial insemination and the earnings could increase significantly from each collection of semen as offspring went on to win championships. A bull typically garners $25,000 for the World Champion Bull title. The ABBI awards about $2 million each year to its competitors, such as the winners of futurity and classic events in the age range of 2 to 4 years.\nMore skilled bull riders and more athletic bulls have enhanced the sport. For some bull owners and breeders, the breeding of bulls has become a full-time career. A good example of a bull that ABBI developed into a successful breeding sire is three-time world champion Bushwacker, owned by Julio Moreno. Moreno retired him after the 2014 season. Bushwacker had career earnings of $600,000; now Moreno sells his semen for $5,000 a straw.\nToday, the ABBI DNA registry database contains cattle records of over 200,000 individuals, including bulls in the United States, Canada, Brazil, and Australia. The registry stores more than just pedigrees. It also stores visual descriptions, ear tag numbers, and electronic chip IDs.\nBreeding stock\nHow cattle breeding developed from the early years to the present model was illustrated by the experiences of Bill Wilfong's breeding program.  His cattle occasionally produced muleys polled livestock, (cattle with no horns). \"Those White Spotted Park cattle were bigger than most and had a natural come back pattern. They'd come back and fight\", said Wilfong. \"There was a white spotted, long eared muley with a lot of front end and a lot of kick. He loved to come back in the gate. I didn't like muleys, but he was so good I bred to him anyway.\" This produced the cow BW 51, whom he bred to notable sire Houdini, and produced the champion bull Voodoo Child in 2002. Slade Long, an ABBI and PBR statistician, rated Voodoo Child as one of the Memorable Bulls of the PBR as part of the Golden Children Group. Voodoo Child has a record 101 outs with only five qualified rides. Voodoo Child was also the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) Bucking Bull of the Year in 2007 and 2008.\nFollowing Wilfong was Gene Baker, a former calf roper and the owner of Homestead Genetics, based in Anson, Texas. Baker moved from breeding show cattle to breeding bucking bulls in 2002 when the RSR became available in 2002. His business also benefited from the purchase of the sire 329 Houdini in 2006 who, as stated earlier, sired the bull Voodoo Child, PRCA Bucking Bull of the Year in 2007 and 2008. Houdini's progeny brought in over $5 million in competitive earnings.  Baker's company has won well over 60 futurity event championships, including three wins at the annual ABBI American Heritage futurity, and the 2010 champion PBR classic once. Baker had two bulls ranked in the top in 2011.\nThe ABBI mostly focuses on recording animals in the American Bucking Bull breed registry. The organization also makes a breeder's certification participation program for particularly outstanding bulls, such as the following:\n* Bushwacker - 2010 ABBI Classic World Finals Champion. PBR Brand of Honor. Three-time PBR World Champion Bull in 2011 and 2013 through 2014. Newsweek states that Bushwacker is the Michael Jordan of bulls. Bushwacker has career earnings of $600,000. His owner, Julio Moreno, once rejected an offer of $800,000 for the bull. In 2014, Moreno said he valued Bushwacker at $2 million.\n* Code Blue - 2009 PBR World Champion Bull. ABBI competition bull.

He died early.\n* Houdini - ABBI sire. Sire to PBR 2007 and 2008 PRCA Bucking Bull of the Year Voodoo Child. The ABBI Registry recorded over 1,000 of his progeny, according to owners, the Bakers of Homestead Genetics, who owned him when he died in 2010 at 19 years old. They refer to him as the greatest sire who ever was. In 1991, 329 Houdini was born on the Rafter 7 Ranch in Oklahoma. His sire was 161 White Sports Coat, and his dam was CP cow 6. Brady Roach sold Houdini to Mitch Terrell of Anson, Texas, when he was two years old. Terrell intended to breed and buck Houdini. He said the bull was a good bucker and sire. \"He just spun right outside the gate and had a lot of electricity to him,\" Terrell recalled. They did buck Houdini some and turned out some great calves. However, Houdini eventually ended up just being a sire and that was where he excelled. He ended up with an owner named Samford for a long stretch. Samford indicated he was always extremely pleased with Houdini's calves. \"You could breed Houdini to a fence post and he'd throw something that bucks,\" Samford said. Eventually, Samford sold Houdini to the Bakers for record $100,000. Hurst, no longer invested in Houdini, said, \"He was and still is one of the top sires ever. I have several calves coming up out of Houdini and they're all really good.\"\n:Also, in 2002, Houdini was cloned. The PBR had written a feature article about Houdini on January 28, 2013. An incredible number of bucking bulls have the letters Hou in their names, in a salute to the sire Houdini. In 2013, there were close to 155,000 bulls registered in the ABBI database. Of those, close to 2,400 were sired by Houdini. Obviously, Houdini is one of the high producing. Many of those he produced are notable bulls, especially so for Voodoo Child and Black Pearl. His sire, White Sports Coat, was also a high producer. He also produced some notable bulls such as Panhandle Slim, Rooster, and Prime Time. Houdini's dam was the double bred Plummer CP6. Attend any ABBI event, and there is almost sure to be at least one bull with Houdini genetics.\n* Little Yellow Jacket - ABBI managed embryos starting with McClure number 68 were flushed through to calf number No. 94, a female. 94 was a high performing bucker at junior rodeos. Gary McClure breed her mother, No. 68 to well-known producer Whitewater Skoal, who was then flushed to champion Little Yellow Jacket. Three-time PBR World Champion Bull from 2002 through 2004. Inaugural 2011 PBR Heroes & Legends Celebration: Brand of Honor. North Dakota Cowboy Hall of Fame.\nOn December 14, 2009, the ABBI registry reached the 100,000th entry in its DNA database. Cody Lambert, livestock director for the PBR, noted that:\nThere are more good bulls out there than ever before and the ABBI is one of the main reasons for that. Before the ABBI when someone bought a calf and bucked him they could never be 100% sure of that calf's pedigree, but now every registered animal in the ABBI is backed up with DNA, so you know exactly how your animals are bred.\" ABBI President Brad Boyd pointed out that, \"This first base of 100,000 core DNA'd animals is truly the foundation for the heritage and documented ancestry of future generations of bucking bulls and elite females to come.\nIn his best year at the PBR, Bushwacker netted $335,000 winnings in 2010. He retired after 2014, and he has career winnings approximated around half a million dollars. ESPN once described Bushwacker as \"the baddest body in sports,\" and suggested that bulls like him garnered more fan appreciation than their riders. Then-CEO Jim Haworth said the bulls become \"celebrity athletes.\" While he was an active bucking bull, Bushwacker packed the house and earned $1,000 per ride. After 2010, he \"aged out\" of the prime ABBI window, but continued to earn money in the PBR.\nFuturity and classic events\nThe ABBI created futurities for registered bulls from ages 1 through 2, and derby events for bulls that are 3 years old. For bulls that are 3- and 4-years old, they created classic events. The annual ABBI Futurity and the Classic World Finals are the top two events for bulls. The Classic World Finals is held at the PBR World Finals. Many of the events are held at PBR regular-season events.\nABBI World Finals\nThe annual ABBI Classic World Finals championship for three- and four-year-old bulls was held as part of the PBR World Finals for several years. The PBR World Finals moved to the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex in 2022 and now takes place in the spring. The ABBI World Finals, however, continue taking place in Las Vegas in the autumn; now held in conjunction with the championship events of the PBR's Challenge Series and Team Series.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ABBI World Champion Classic Bull\n!Year\n!Owner\n!Bull\n|-\n|2004\n|D&H Cattle Company / Shippy / Jirl Buck\n|13 Big Deal\n|-\n|2005\n|D&H Cattle Company\n|S5 Stray Kitty\n|-\n|2006\n|Don & Janelle Kish\n|295 God's Gift\n|-\n|2007\n|Flying U / Julio Moreno & Cindy Rosser\n|T-11 Troubadour\n|-\n|2008\n|D&H Cattle Company / Cliff Wiggins\n|10-5 Crosswired\n|-\n|2009\n|Ravenscroft / Boyd-Floyd\n|250 Black Pearl\n|-\n|2010\n|Julio Moreno & Richard Oliviera\n|13/6 Bushwacker\n|-\n|2011\n|Kent Cox / Doug Ackerman\n|705 Back Bender\n|-\n|2012\n|Luthy / Duckwall / D&H Cattle Company / Power River Rodeo\n|20U Shepherd Hills Tested\n|-\n|2013\n|Wyatt Crowder\n|708 The Rocker\n|-\n|2014\n|D&H Cattle Company / Buck Cattle\n|58X Long John\n|-\n|2015\n|D&H Cattle Company / Buck Cattle\n|32Y Bruiser\n|-\n|2016\n|Dakota Rodeo - Berger / Struve\n|2125 Wicked Stick\n|-\n|2017\n|Tommy Julian / D&H Cattle Company\n|20A High Test\n|-\n|2018\n|Barthold / Almand / D&H Cattle Company\n|561C Hocus Pocus\n|-\n|2019\n|D&H Cattle Company / Flinn\n|43C- Chiseled\n|-\n|2020\n|Larry Barker\n|124 Woopaa\n|-\n|2021\n|Tommy Julian / D&H Cattle Company\n|34E Juju\n|-\n|2022\n|Staci Addison / Tommy Julian / Crooked W / D&H Cattle Company\n|35F Cool Whip\n|-\n|2023\n|Tommy Julian / BS Cattle Company\n|922 Flyin' Wired\n|-\n|2024\n|Less Than 8 Cattle Company\n|321 King Tut\n|-\n|2025\n|Flinn / D&H Cattle Company\n|J39- Ransom\n|}\nSources:\nThe ABBI World Finals Futurity bull is awarded yearly.
