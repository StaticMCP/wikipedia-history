It was administered by the Canadian Centre for Investigative Journalism (CIJ).\nHistory\nFounded in 1978, CIJ began giving the awards in 1986. The inaugural awards had just two categories: print and broadcast. The categories were refined in 1987 to be newspaper, magazine, television, and radio.  The 1990 awards split the newspaper category into open newspaper and small newspaper, and the radio and television categories were each split into network and regional. They were the final awards given under the organization's name before it was changed to the Canadian Association of Journalists (CAJ) the day after the awards ceremony. The CAJ continued giving awards from 1991 onward under its new name.\n1986 Awardees\nBroadcast\n* Eric Malling, The Fifth Estate\n::He was honored for an investigation into the federal government's decision to allow StarKist to ship cans of tainted tuna from its Saint Andrews, New Brunswick.
