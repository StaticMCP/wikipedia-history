His most popular books have generally featured dragons as their central characters.\nBorn in Somerset and raised in Bournemouth, Edwards studied art and design. He went on to work as a graphic designer and animator before developing his writing career in the 1990s. He often includes illustrations with his novels. Edwards now lives in Nottingham with his wife and two children.\nBody of work\nEdwards' major body of work consists of two related fantasy trilogies: the Ultimate Dragon Saga trilogy and the Stone trilogy (also known as the Amara trilogy).\nThe former series of books is a fantasy work set in times before humans, and as such there are no human characters in the novels. The dragons are sentient and, much like the rabbits and moles in Richard Adams' Watership Down and William Horwood's Duncton Wood respectively, they are anthropomorphised, displaying a large array of human characteristics, relationships and emotions.\nThe latter series is set - although not in an actual Earthly time period - parallel to the late 19th century. Its events are triggered by the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883, and feature human characters prominently, although the stories are also populated with other races such as dragons. This series can be read as a standalone trilogy, although minor plot and character connections to the Ultimate Dragon Saga mean that prior reading of the first trilogy will give a richer appreciation of the second.\nSince finishing the Stone trilogy, Edwards has written several short stories, published in Realms Of Fantasy magazine. In 2008 he published his first crime novel, Runaway Minister, under the pseudonym Nick Curtis. It was published by Black Star Crime books.  Two years later, he published a sequel, Close Enemies.\nIn 2014, Edwards published the hybrid low fantasy detective novel  Talus and the Frozen King under his own name.\nBibliography\nNovels\nStand Alone Novels\n*Talus and the Frozen King (2014)\nThe Ultimate Dragon Saga trilogy\n*Dragoncharm (1995)\n*Dragonstorm (1996)\n*Dragonflame (1997)\nThe Stone trilogy, or the Amara trilogy\n*Stone and Sky (1999)\n*Stone and Sea (2000)\n*Stone and Sun (2001)\nWriting as Nick Curtis\n*Runaway Minister (2008)\n*Close Enemies (2010)\nWriting as J.D.
