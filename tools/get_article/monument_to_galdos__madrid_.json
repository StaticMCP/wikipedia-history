It lies on the southern part of El Retiro.\nHistory and description\nAn initiative of friends and admirers of the writer such as the Quintero brothers, , González Blanco and , in 1918 the project was entrusted to Victorio Macho, who had already carried out a study of the facial features of Galdós in the past. The material costs were funded via popular subscription.\nThe sculpture represents Galdós towards the end of his life, sitting on an armchair (with arms in the form of lions), with his legs covered by a blanket.\nThe monument was unveiled during an emotive ceremony on 20 January 1919, attended by Galdós himself. Tomás Borrás Bermejo, Emiliano Ramírez Ángel, Ramón Pérez de Ayala and Enrique de Mesa were among those in attendance. An ageing Galdós (he would die less than a year later)—ill of uremia and nearly completely blind—felt the statue with his fingers and told Macho: \"Magnificent, my friend Macho. And he looks so much like me!\".\nThe work brought fame to the then young Macho and boosted his incipient career.\nReferences\n;Citations\n;Bibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*"
