      "text": "# Revolutionary Boogie\n\nRevolutionary Boogie is a 2011 album by blues guitarist and singer Michael Powers. This was the follow up to his album Prodigal Son that was released in 2006.\nBackground\nThe album which was produced by Eric R. Durham was released on 9 August 2011. It was also released on Blues Boulevard Records 250297 in November 2011, and on Music Avenue 250297. In addition to his own material, the album also featured covers of material by Muddy Waters, Elmore James, Jimi Hendrix and Willie Dixon. Three songs, \"Shake Your Money Maker\", \"I Ain't Superstitious\" and \"Honeybee\" are recorded with backing by The Mana’o Trio, which according to Blues Finland have a Hawaiian connection.\nReception\nJoachim 'Joe' Brookes of Rock Times reviewed the album. The review was dated July 22, 2011. He finished off with, \"Insgesamt hat Michael Powers mit \"Revolutionary Boogie\" einen würdigen Nachfolger für \"Prodigal Son\" eingespielt. Die neue Scheibe kommt kurz hinter dem Vorgänger ins Ziel.\" Translated into English:\"Michael Powers has recorded a worthy successor to \"Prodigal Son\" with \"Revolutionary Boogie\". The new album comes in just behind its predecessor.\"\nMark Johnson of Sea of Tranquility gave the album four stars in a review that was published on 19 August 2001. He said that the moment you put in the CD it rocks. And he said that the backing instruments only enhance what Powers is doing through the chords. He named the Jimi Hendrix song \"Spanish Castle Magic\" as the highlight of the album. He finished off with telling the reader to get this album if they like boogie and blues.\nThe review by David Maine of PopMatters was published on 4 October 2011. He started off with questioning what was so revolutionary about the album. He did say that the artist knew his material and his brand of meaty, guitar-based blues is powerful and satisfying. He also said that Powers had a strong, expressive voice, and his singing nicely complemented his thunderous guitar slinging. He rated the album with a seven.\nA brief review of the album by Classic Rock by Henry Yates was published on 12 October 2011 in its \"Blues Round-up: November 2011\" set of reviews. He said the album wasn't doing much what you hadn't heard before but inferred that the reliable vocal and excellent guitar made up for it. He also made a reference to Powers that at his age, at nearly sixty, he wouldn't be likely to change the world, \"but he can still start one hell of a party\".Classic Rock, 12 October 2011 - [https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/blues-round-up-november-2011 Blues Round-up: November 2011 Henry Yates on new releases from Popa Chubby, Henry Parker & His Magical World, Roadhouse, Michael Powers and Moreland & Arbuckle, Michael Powers: Revolutionary Boogie]\nThe album received a positive review from Blues Finland which was published on 9, November 2011.\nThe album got a brief review by La hora del blues which was published in May, 2013.
