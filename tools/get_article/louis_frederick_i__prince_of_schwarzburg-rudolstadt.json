He was received at the Palace of Versailles by King Louis XIV and in Vienna by Emperor Leopold I.  He was also received by Duke Frederick I of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, whose daughter Anna Sophie he would marry on 15 October 1691 at Friedenstein Castle in Gotha.  The pair would have 15 children.\nHis father was raised to Imperial Prince in 1697 and again in 1710.  In 1710, his father had accepted the elevation, but not made it public.  After his father died in 1710, Louis Frederick I inherited Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and published the promotion.  From 15 April 1711, he styled himself Prince of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt.  At the time, the principality had around  inhabitants.  The elevation strengthened the position of the House of Schwarzburg against the House of Wettin and ensured its survival into modern times.  Between 1697 and 1719, they added an Imperial Hall to the southern side of their Schwarzburg Castle, underlining the importance the princes attached to their elevation.\nLouis Frederick I assisted his father in administrating the principality even before 1710.  After he inherited the throne, he reformed the administration on an absolutist basis.  George Ulrich von Beulwitz was the highest civil servant in the principality.  Inspired by the Sun King, Louis Frederick I toyed with the idea to move his residence to Schwarzburg.  However, his financial position made this impossible.\nLouis Frederick I took his own life on 24 June 1718 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Frederick Anton.\nMarriage and issue\nOn 15 October 1691 at Friedenstein Castle in Gotha, Louis Frederick I married Princess Anna Sophie of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, the daughter of Duke Frederick I of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg.
