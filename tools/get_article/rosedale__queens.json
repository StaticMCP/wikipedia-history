The neighborhood, located along the southern part of Queens, borders Nassau County.\nRosedale is located in Queens Community District 13 and its ZIP Code is 11422. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department's 116th Precinct.\nHistory\nRosedale was originally conceived in the consolidation of the borough of Queens as a part of what is now Springfield Gardens. At the time, the Laurelton Land Company was in charge of the new Borough of Queens. It was dotted with farmland that was isolated from each other, so construction on an acceptable mode of transportation was started immediately. The Southern Railroad of Long Island (now Long Island Rail Road) was built and the whole area (today Laurelton, Rosedale, and Springfield Gardens) was served by the Laurelton station. The area was also connected to the Brooklyn waterworks. In the 20th century, the water system was less needed, and its use dwindled.  Today the ruins of the aqueduct system can still be seen. After the Long Island Rail Road's construction, many new roads such as Francis Lewis and Sunrise Boulevard (today Sunrise Highway) were constructed. The area that is now Rosedale remained farmland until the mid-1930s. After the former period of relatively slow growth, development rapidly turned Rosedale into a suburban community. Rosedale was originally known as Foster's Meadow.\nDuring the mid-1970s, African American and Caribbean families started moving into what had been a mostly Irish, Italian, and Jewish community. Many black families' homes were firebombed to harass them and cajole them to leave. The U.S. government filed a civil-rights lawsuit in 1975 against a group named Return Our American Rights (ROAR), alleging that ROAR had been harassing white homeowners who tried to sell to black clients, and implicating ROAR in some of the firebombings. In 1976, Bill Moyers presented a documentary titled Rosedale: The Way It Is, which addressed the racial tensions in the community. While the racial tensions decreased in subsequent years, there were still some incidents of racial conflict: for instance, during the July 4 weekend in 1989, a group of white youths chased black youths through Rosedale after a dispute over firecrackers.\nIn the end, the area ended up being mostly a home to many Caribbean immigrants. Irish, Italian, and Jewish Americans moved to the neighboring Nassau County communities of Valley Stream, South Valley Stream, and Woodmere.\nLocation\nRosedale is bordered to the north by Cambria Heights, to the east by Valley Stream and North Woodmere (both in Nassau County), to the west by Laurelton, Springfield Gardens, and John F. Kennedy International Airport, and to the south by Inwood and Lawrence in Nassau County. It is at the eastern edge of New York City, at its border with Valley Stream forming part of the boundary between Queens and Nassau County. The neighborhood is part of Queens Community Board 13. Many roads of importance in Queens also run through Rosedale such as Francis Lewis Boulevard, Conduit Avenue, Cross Island Parkway, and the Belt Parkway, as well as Rockaway Boulevard, Sunrise Highway, and Merrick Boulevard which connect Queens and Nassau Counties.\nWarnerville and Meadowmere\nWarnerville and Meadowmere are small neighborhoods within Rosedale. The area is served by the 11422 ZIP Code, which also covers the rest of Rosedale and parts of Kennedy Airport. Warnerville is surrounded on three sides by Jamaica Bay just to the southeast of John F. Kennedy International Airport and comprises just three streets, bordered by Rockaway Boulevard on the east. Meadowmere is surrounded by Nassau County and comprises just four streets and six blocks, bordered on the west by Hook Creek and on the east by Rockaway Boulevard.\nDemographics\nBased on data from the 2010 United States census, the population of Rosedale was 25,063, a decrease of 439 (1.7%) from the 25,502 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .\nThe racial makeup of the neighborhood was 5.3% (1,334) White, 79.9% (20,033) African American, 0.3% (82) Native American, 2.2% (556) Asian, 1.0% (242) from other races, and 1.9% (474) from two or more races.
