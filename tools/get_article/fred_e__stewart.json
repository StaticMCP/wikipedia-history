Starting from a single complaint of a $500 pay-off to settle a law violation, the scandale became a snowball rolling downhill with charges of \"shakedowns\" and \"favoritism\" being hurled on all sides. . . . Among the first to be subpoenaed were former City Attorney Erwin P. Werner and his wife, Mrs. Helen M. Werner  . . . . Discovery of two dictograph microphones in the Werner offices and the pilfering of their office were sensational developments in the case. In Oakland the Alameda county grand jury subpoenaed Fred Stewart . . . for questioning.[https://www.proquest.com/docview/164644507 \"Digest and resume,\" Los Angeles Times, June 14, 1936, page C-8]\nHe told investigators he had never been to the Werner ranch near Glendora, as reported, \"and any statement to that effect is an unmitigated lie.\"[https://www.proquest.com/docview/164614923 \"Tale Denied by Stewart,\" Los Angeles Times, June 26, 1936, page 3]\nThe investigation of the relationship between the wine industry and the government continued over the years, and in November 1939 Stewart, fellow board member William G. Bonelli and seven other people were indicted in by a Los Angeles grand jury for conspiring to obtain $15,000 from California wine makers.[https://www.proquest.com/docview/164953168 \"Stewart Indicted in Liquor Plot Case,\" Los Angeles Times, November 16, 1939, page 1]  The charges against Stewart were later dismissed.\nStewart died at his home in Oakland on April 17, 1942, at the age of 61. He was survived by his wife and five children.\nReferences"
