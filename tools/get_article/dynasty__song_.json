It features vocals by longtime collaborator Haley Gibby (simply credited as Haley), who for the first time was given lead billing on this single – which was inspired by an event that Kaskade was headlining. This track would become Kaskade's first number one on ''Billboard's'' Hot Dance Airplay chart after collaborating with deadmau5 (his third number one overall), as well as Gibby's first number one as a featured lead vocalist.\nTrack listings\n*;Digital download - single\n# \"Dynasty\" - 3:16\n*;Dynasty (Remixed)\n# \"Dynasty\" (Kaskade Club Mix) - 8:00\n# \"Dynasty\" (Kaskade Arena Remix) - 7:38\n# \"Dynasty\" (Michael Woods Club Mix) - 7:55\n# \"Dynasty\" (Michael Woods Vocal Mix) - 7:55\n# \"Dynasty\" (Dada Life Remix) - 5:30\n# \"Dynasty\" (Sunnery James & Ryan Marciano Remix) - 7:00\n*;Digital download - Beatport contest winner remix single\n# \"Dynasty\" (Alex Rich Remix) - 6:18\nChart positions\n*Hot Dance Airplay: #1\nReferences"
