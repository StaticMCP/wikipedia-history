      "text": "# 1861 Goulburn colonial by-election\n\nA by-election was held for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly electorate of Goulburn on 13 June 1861 because of the resignation of Charles Walsh. Walsh stated that he had been elected to support the Land Bills, which would open up the free selection of Crown land, and the Legislative Council Bill which would replace the nominated council with an elected body. These bills had not been passed by the Legislative Council and the Premier Charles Cowper had arranged for 21 new members to be appointed to the council. Walsh stated that as the bills \"will be carried through both branches of the legislature, and become the law of the land\" he therefore resigned as the tasks had been achieved.\nIt is unclear when Walsh wrote the letter, because on 10 May 1861, before the new members had been sworn in, Sir William Burton the President of the Legislative Council, announced his resignation and left the chambers, followed by the 13 members of the opposition. Under the standing orders of the council in the absence of the President or the Chairman of Committees, George Allen, the council was adjourned until the next sitting day. As there was no further sitting day before the council was prorogued on 13 May 1861 the bills were not passed.\nDates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Date !!
