Released in 2016, the album is a blend of blues, jazz, funk, and soul. King's vocals on the album were heavily influenced by Ray Charles's vocal stylings. Truth reached #1 at the Roots music report -Contemporary Blues Chart, and #5 at the Living Blues Chart.\nBackground\nTruth is an album with a big band sound, that primarily is composed of two genres: jazz and Chicago blues. The album contains, \"blues, funk, soul, and everything in between.\"\nRelease and reception\nDan Bindert of Chicago Blues Guide said, \"...he (Guy King) plays it sophisticated and soulful, with a sense of taste and genuine feeling that's sometimes lacking in contemporary blues. It's easily the Israeli-born guitarist's most fully realized recording yet, with top flight production.\"\nJohn Mitchell of Blues Blast Magazine opined: \"The style is relaxed with more than a touch of jazz in Guy’s playing, at times recalling George Benson in his prime.\"\nPersonnel\nGuy King Band\n*Guy King – Lead guitar, Rhythm guitar, vocals\n*Amr Marcin Fahmy - Rhodes B3 Hammond Organ\n*Jake Vinsel - bass\n*George Fludas - Drums,\n*Marques Carroll - Trumpet\n*Christopher Neal - Tenor Saxophone\n*Brent Griffin Jr - Baritone Saxophone\n*Sahrah Marie Young, Kiara Shackelford and Jihan Murray-Smith -Background Vocals\nReferences"
