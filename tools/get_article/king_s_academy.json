It is named in honor of King Abdullah II of Jordan and seeks to fulfill His Majesty's vision of producing \"a new generation of enlightened and creative minds.\"\nKing Abdullah attended high school at Deerfield Academy in the United States as there was no school of comparable standing in Jordan when he was a boy, but his son Crown Prince Hussein enrolled in the new school's second incoming class (2008). The school's first headmaster, Dr. Eric Widmer, was a past headmaster of Deerfield.\nThe primary language of instruction at King's Academy is English. Both Arabic-speaking and non-Arabic-speaking students are required to study Arabic. The academy is a member of the G30 Schools group.\nThe school is included in The Schools Index as one of the 150 best private schools in the world and among top 15 schools in the Middle East.\nLocation and campus\nThe King's Academy campus was designed by an Egyptian architect and Director of the Prince's School of Traditional Arts in London Khaled Azzam. The campus and buildings are constructed on a 575-dunum (144-acre) site and comprise some 35 major buildings.\nAthletic facilities\nThe athletic facilities include a semi-Olympic swimming pool, tennis court, squash court, handball, and basketball courts, and cardio and weight training facilities. There is also an outdoor sports stadium that includes a full-size football field, two additional football fields, and a track.\nKing Abdullah II Spiritual Center\nThe King Abdullah II Spiritual Center is a multi-faith spiritual center that is available for use to all members of the school community, regardless of their faith. Both the indoor prayer room and the open-air courtyard are available for use at all times by students, faculty, staff, and campus visitors.\nThe Abdul Majeed Shoman Auditorium\nThe Abdul Majeed Shoman Auditorium holds around 200 people and is the location of both school and community events including concerts, student recitals, plays, and dance performances. Students and faculty members gather here for weekly school meetings.\nThe Sheikh Jabir Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Building\nThe building has a total area of 2,200 square meters and houses the Middle School, the Office of the Headmaster, and the Office of Admissions.\nThe Middle School comprises 10 classrooms, two fully equipped science labs, an art wing, a study lounge, and a large multipurpose room, in addition to the dean's office and the school counselor's office. The building is fully accessible with an elevator and additional ramps.\nThe HRH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Library\nFor use by students, faculty, staff and guests of King's Academy, the HRH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Library holds 50,000 volumes. The building is outfitted with wireless internet, reading tables, and study spaces, including a circular reading room (a rotunda) that overlooks the campus.\nStudent body\nThe King's Academy campus was built to accommodate both day and boarding students, the latter comprising about 70 percent of the student body.\nFor the 2022–2023 academic year, 570 students were enrolled at the school, representing some 40 countries in the Middle East and around the world. Of these students, 45 percent are female, and 55 percent are male.\nApproximately 43% of students receive financial aid.\nAcademics\nThe school's curriculum is based on the American Advanced Placement (AP) program, and the Middle School curriculum is based on the College Board’s QUEST framework for teaching and learning.
