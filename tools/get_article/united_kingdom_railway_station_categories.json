The scheme was devised in 1996 and there was a review in 2009 when 106 stations changed categories. The categorisation scheme is owned by Network Rail, the site landlord of most of the stations.\nSome stations are in more than one category: for instance, at London St Pancras International, the surface platforms are in category A and the Thameslink platforms are in category C1.\nStations in Scotland are categorised and counted in the totals below, for example  and  are both category A, but are not included in the lists of stations for each category.\nCategorisation scheme\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"75%\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | Category\n!
