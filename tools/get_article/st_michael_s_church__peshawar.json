It is located on The Mall. It was consecrated in 1851. It is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Islamabad-Rawalpindi.\nHistory\nIn the nineteenth century, armed British Catholic soldiers would parade to church, led by a Drum Major wielding his baton, with two bagpipers and two or four kettle drummers. After Mass, the soldiers would march back to their barracks. The church had special pews with arrangements for holding weapons.\nThe church was not constructed using traditional Catholic architecture, but was built to resemble a Muslim Mosque, even engraving scriptures in the local language of Pashto.\nPost-Independence\nSince 1957 the parish has been home to St. Mary's High School for boys.\nIn 2001, Fr. John William, the parish priest at asked the Pakistani government for soldiers to guard Christian churches and housing developments after threats of violence had been made in Peshawar.\nThe tower of the church almost collapsed following the country's worst-ever earthquake in 2005.\nChurch leaders and Christian communities received letters warning them to convert to Islam or face suicide bombings. A group of church leaders met with police officials on August 11, 2007, and urged authorities to protect the minorities and apprehend the fundamentalists for causing unrest. Fr. Yousaf Amanat was parish priest at the time.\nReferences"
