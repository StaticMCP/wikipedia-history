      "text": "# List of United Kingdom flags\n\nand County flags flying in Parliament Square, London]]\nThis list includes flags that either have been in use or are currently used by the United Kingdom, the individual countries of the United Kingdom, the British Overseas Territories and the Crown Dependencies.\nThe College of Arms is the authority on the flying of flags in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and maintains the only official register of flags for these countries. It was established in 1484 and as part of the Royal Household operates under the authority of the Crown. The Lord Lyon King of Arms, established prior to 1399, holds a similar role within Scotland. A separate private body called the Flag Institute, an educational charity financed by its own membership, also maintains a registry of United Kingdom flags that it styles 'the UK Flag Registry', though this has no official status under UK law.\nFlags recognised by planning law\nCertain classes of flag enjoy a special status within English planning law and can be flown without needing the planning permission normally required for advertisements. These include any country’s national flag, civil ensign or civil air ensign; the flag of the Commonwealth, the United Nations or any other international organisation of which the United Kingdom is a member; a flag of any island, county, district, borough, burgh, parish, city, town or village within the United Kingdom; the flag of the Black Country, East Anglia, Wessex, any Part of Lincolnshire, any Riding of Yorkshire or any historic county within the United Kingdom; the flag of St David; the flag of St Patrick; the flag of any administrative area within any country outside the United Kingdom; any flag of the British Armed Forces; and the Armed Forces Day flag.\nSince the United Kingdom left the European Union, flying the flag of the European Union now requires planning permission. However the United Kingdom remains a member of the Council of Europe, which uses the same flag.\nCertain other flags may be flown without obtaining planning permission, providing they adhere to certain restrictions including location, size, and number of flags. These include \"house flags\" for companies or individuals occupying a building, or temporary events taking place in a building; sports club flags (excluding sponsorship logos); the rainbow flag; flags of certain award schemes (Eco-Schools, The King's Awards for Enterprise, Investors in People, Blue Flag Award for beaches, and Green Flag Award for parks and open spaces); and NHS flags.\nCurrent national flags\nNational and subnational flags of the United Kingdom.\nUnited Kingdom\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n! style=\"width:110px;\"|Flag!! style=\"width:100px;\"|Date!!Use!!Description!!Status\n|-\n|  || rowspan=\"2\"|since 1801 || rowspan=\"2\"|The Union Flag, also commonly known as the Union Jack.

The Ulster Banner portrayed here is from the former coat of arms of Northern Ireland and was the flag of the Government of Northern Ireland between 1924 and 1972. Since 1972 this flag has continued to be used for want of another distinctive flag, almost exclusively amongst the Unionist community. The flag is commonly used for sporting events and teams from Northern Ireland, most notably in the Commonwealth Games, the Northern Ireland national football team and events where Northern Irish competitors represent the province specifically such as snooker, darts and golf.\n|-\n|  || c. 1542(variants first appeared c. 1286) || Flag of Scotland, also known as the St&nbsp;Andrew's Cross, or the Saltire || Azure a saltire Argent||National flag used by Scottish Government and agencies, sports teams representing Scotland and by ordinary citizens.\n|-\n|  || c. 1807(variants first appeared c. 1485) || Flag of Wales, also known as the Red Dragon or Y Ddraig Goch|| Per fess Argent and Vert, a dragon passant Gules||National flag used by the Welsh Government and agencies, sports teams representing Wales and by ordinary citizens.\n|}\nThe flags of England and of Scotland are ancient war flags which became by usage the national flags of the Kingdom of England (which included Wales) and of the Kingdom of Scotland respectively and continued in use until the Act of Union 1707. Thereafter, they were as de facto flags of those parts of the United Kingdom. The flag of Wales was formalised in 1959, but has ancient origins; the dragon was used as a battle-flag by countless Welsh rulers, the current flag being a redesign of the flag carried by Henry Tudor. The Flag of Northern Ireland is controversial. The coat of arms of the Government of Northern Ireland, a red cross on a white field, defaced with a Red Hand of Ulster within a six pointed star topped with a crown, became used as a local flag, though the end of the province's Government in 1973 ended its official status. This flag has continued to be the internationally recognisable de facto flag of Northern Ireland through its use by international sporting organisations (for example FIFA, UEFA, and the Commonwealth Games) to represent Northern Ireland, though locally it has the allegiance mainly of the Unionist community. The St Patrick's Saltire is also sometimes used by the UK government in London to represent Northern Ireland when a discrete Northern Ireland flag is required.\nCrown Dependencies\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n! style=\"width:110px;\"|Flag!! style=\"width:100px;\"|Date!! style=\"width:250px;\"|Use!! style=\"width:250px;\"|Description\n|-\n|  || 1993–present || Flag of Alderney || A red cross on a white field (St George's Cross) with an inescutcheon of the island's coat of arms.

The white discs were removed from the field of the flags and each respective coat of arms was increased in size for ease of identification. As the MoD only had authority over sea flags, the governments of the Overseas Territories were free to continue using the flags with white discs on land. The Overseas Territories' governments did switch to the updated flags over a staggered period of time, however some old-style flags with white discs may still be seen. Such flags have generally been adopted by Order in Council. Civil (Red Ensign) flags are under the control of the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Transport and are split into two categories: Category 1 is to register ships of unlimited tonnage and type. Category 2 is to register commercial ships and yachts of up to 150 gross registered tons.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n! style=\"width:110px;\"|Flag!! style=\"width:100px;\"|Date!! style=\"width:250px;\"|Use!! style=\"width:250px;\"|Description\n|-\n|  || 1990–present || Anguilla || A blue ensign defaced with the Coat of arms of Anguilla\n|-\n|  || 1960-present|| Flag used in Akrotiri and Dhekelia|| The Union Jack is used as no territory flag exists\n|-\n|  || 2013–present || Ascension Island, a constituent part of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha|| A blue ensign defaced with the Coat of arms of Ascension Island\n|-\n|  || rowspan=\"2\" | 1999–present || rowspan=\"2\" | Bermuda[http://www.redensigngroup.org/entities/category-1/bermuda.aspx Red Ensign Group] || A red ensign defaced with the Coat of arms of Bermuda.
