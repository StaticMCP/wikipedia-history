The album was recorded live for broadcast on the King Biscuit Flower Hour at the Spectrum in Philadelphia in March 1975, during a tour of North America, opening for Humble Pie.\nIt was produced, mixed, and mastered by Jon Astley and Andy Macpherson. They only played one song from Entwistle's current album Mad Dog (\"Cell Number 7\"), but included classic Who songs written by John Entwistle such as \"Heaven and Hell\", \"My Wife\" and \"Whiskey Man.\" Other highlights included \"My Size\" and a cover version of Buddy Holly's \"Not Fade Away.\" As a bonus track, the album includes an interview with Entwistle conducted by Steve Luongo (who worked on his next solo album Music From Van-Pires) and Bob Pridden. Many Ox fans have compared this album to The Who's live album Live at Leeds as it was remastered by the same personnel who remastered Live at Leeds. The album, though recorded in 1975, features a cover photo of Entwistle playing live in the 1980s or '90s.\nTrack listings\nAll tracks written and composed by John Entwistle, except where indicated.\n2005 reissue bonus track\nPersonnel\n* John Entwistle - lead vocals, bass guitar\n* Graham Deakin - drums\n* Robert A.
