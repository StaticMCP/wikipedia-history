The Luis Lacalle Pou-Beatriz Argimón ticket was elected President of the Republic and Vice President respectively.\nHistory\nIn May 2019, the former president of Uruguay, Julio María Sanguinetti expressed himself favouring a political alliance to compete with the ruling party in the general elections. According to the statements, the Colorado Party, the National Party and the Independent Party should be included.\nAt the beginning of September 2019, the then candidate for the PN, Luis Lacalle Pou, expressed to Argentine businessmen that in Uruguay an alternation in power was taking place in which there would have to be an agreement between \"four or five opposition parties\", which he later referred to as \"Multicolor Coalition\". On the night of 27 October, the day the general election was held, after knowing the projections of results, Ernesto Talvi, Guido Manini Ríos and Edgardo Novick announced their support of Lacalle Pou in the second round.\nPablo Mieres said that if certain agreements were reached, his party would support Lacalle Pou, which became official a few days later. On 5 November, the «Commitment for the Country» was presented, a basic document of programmatic agreement between the different parties that make up the Multicolor Coalition.\nOn 24 November, the election was held, in which Lacalle Pou was victorious against Daniel Martínez (50.79% to 49.21%). The adjusted result, regarding what the voting intention polls marked, prevented from officially knowing the winner on the same night of the election, since the difference that resulted from the primary scrutiny was less than the number of votes observed.\nPresidential election\nIn the first round held on 27 October, the sum of the votes of the parties that would later take part in the coalition was 1,315,258.29 corresponding to 56.09% of the valid votes. In the second round held on 24 November, the Lacalle Pou-Beatriz Argimón ticket received 1,189,313 votes, in this case corresponding to 50.79% of the valid votes, surpassing the Daniel Martínez-Graciela Villar ticket in all departments of the country except for Montevideo and Canelones.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Year\n! colspan=\"4\" |Presidential ticket\n! colspan=\"2\" |First round\n! colspan=\"2\" |Second round\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Notes\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |President\n! colspan=\"2\" |Vice President\n!Votes\n!%\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n!2019\n|\n|Luis Alberto Lacalle Pou\n|\n|Beatriz Argimón\n|1,315,258\n|56.09\n|1,189,313\n|50.79\n|In the first round the coalition was not formed\n(result is sum of the members).\n|-\n!2024\n|\n|Álvaro Delgado\n|\n|Valeria Ripoll\n|655,426\n|28.20\n|1,101,296\n|47.92\n|\n|}\nLegislative election\nChamber of Representatives\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Year\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n!Notes\n|-\n!2019\n|\n|\n|\n|The parliamentary elections are simultaneous to the first round of the presidential elections;\nthe coalition was not formed (result is sum of the members).\n|-\n|2024\n|\n|\n|\n|The parliamentary elections are simultaneous to the first round of the presidential elections;\nthe coalition was not formed (result is sum of the members).\n|}\nSenate\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Year\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n!Notes\n|-\n!2019\n|\n|\n|\n|The parliamentary elections are simultaneous to the first round of the presidential elections;\nthe coalition was not formed (result is sum of the members).\n|-\n|2024\n|\n|\n|\n|The parliamentary elections are simultaneous to the first round of the presidential elections;\nthe coalition was not formed (result is sum of the members).\n|}\nLegislature in 2020–2025\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"5%\" |Party\n! rowspan=\"2\" |President\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |Leader\n! colspan=\"2\" |Seats\n|-\n!Senators\n!Representatives\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:\" |\n|National\n|Beatriz Argimón\n|\n|Luis Alberto Lacalle Pou\n|}}\n| align=\"left\" |}}\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:\" |\n|Colorado\n|Julio María Sanguinetti\n|\n|Ernesto Talvi\n|}}\n| align=\"left\" |}}\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#FBC22B\" |\n|Open Cabildo\n|Guillermo Domenech\n|\n|Guido Manini Ríos\n|\n| align=\"left\" |\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:\" |\n|Independent\n|Pablo Mieres\n|\n|Pablo Mieres\n|}}\n| align=\"left\" |}}\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#92D050\" |\n|Party of the People\n|Edgardo Novick\n|\n|Edgardo Novick\n|\n| align=\"left\" |\n|}\nLegislature in 2025–2030\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |Party\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Ideology\n! rowspan=\"2\" |President\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Leader\n! colspan=\"2\" |Seats\n|-\n!Senators\n!Representatives\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:\" |\n|National Party\n|Liberal conservatismChristian democracy\n|Macarena Rubio\n|Álvaro Delgado\n|}}\n| align=\"left\" |}}\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:\" |\n|Colorado Party\n|\n|Andrés Ojeda\n|Andrés Ojeda\n|}}\n| align=\"left\" |}}\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#FBC22B\" |\n|Open Cabildo\n|National conservatismRight-wing populism\n|Raúl Lozano Bonet\n|Guido Manini Ríos\n|\n| align=\"left\" |\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:\" |\n|Independent Party\n|Christian humanism\n| colspan=\"2\" | Pablo Mieres\n|}}\n| align=\"left\" |}}\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#00a655\" |\n|\n|ConstitutionalismEco-nationalism\n| colspan=\"2\" | Eduardo Lust\n|\n| align=\"left\" |\n|}\nReferences"
