This marked the first time in eight years that the venue hosted the show. The show was hosted by hip-hop rapper and singer Doja Cat. It was the first time in history a Video of the Year nominee hosted the ceremony the same year.\nThe ceremony was simulcast on The CW, a free over-the-air broadcaster, with Mountain and Pacific time zones airing it live and others delayed for primetime, and on various ViacomCBS networks and platforms. Lil Nas X, Olivia Rodrigo and BTS were the most awarded artists of the night with three awards each, followed by Billie Eilish, and Justin Bieber with two each; the latter was also the most nominated artist with nine nominations. Beyoncé extended her lead as the most-awarded artist in the show's history, collecting her 29th trophy. Her daughter Blue Ivy Carter also became the youngest winner in the show's history.\nOn August 1, a new iteration of the MTV Video Music Awards \"moon person\" trophy was unveiled at NASA's Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, in honor of MTV's 40th anniversary. Designed by Kehinde Wiley, it features vines and flowers symbolizing \"the ethnic histories that surround America\", with the network stating that \"each intertwined vine or leaf\" holds a \"different historical relevance, such as the seeds from African slaves, that are woven into the American tapestry\".\nMTV collaborated with 9/11 Day for a week of activities to \"promote awareness and positive action\" in honor of the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, which fell on the eve of the ceremony.\nThe show received 3.7 million viewers across all networks, including 900,000 viewers on MTV, representing a 31% drop from last year's 1.3 million. However, the show garnered 38 million interactions across all U.S. platforms, beating the Super Bowl for the first time and becoming 2021's top telecast in social media buzz. Internationally, the VMAs increased 43% in Brazil and 25% in the U.K.\nPerformances\nLorde was initially announced as a performer for the main show on August 18, 2021, but later pulled out of the event on September 3 \"due to a change in production elements\". Ed Sheeran additionally performed his new single \"Bad Habits\", but the clip was uploaded to MTV's YouTube channel instead of being shown during the live broadcast. Anitta made a clip for the song \"Girl from Rio\" uploaded to MTV's YouTube channel as an advertisement for Burger King, but it was deleted.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ List of musical performances\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Artist(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Song(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\"| Pre-show\n|-\n| Polo G\n| \"Rapstar\"\n|-\n| Kim Petras\n| \"Future Starts Now\"\n|-\n| Swedish House Mafia\n| \"It Gets Better\"\"Lifetime\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\"| Main show\n|-\n| The Kid LaroiJustin Bieber\n| \"Stay\"\"Ghost\"\n|-\n| Olivia Rodrigo\n| \"Good 4 U\"\n|-\n| Kacey Musgraves\n| \"Star-Crossed\"\n|-\n| Twenty One Pilots\n| \"Saturday\"\n|-\n| Ed Sheeran\n| \"Shivers\"\"Bad Habits\"\"Perfect\"\n|-\n| Lil Nas XJack Harlow\n| \"Industry Baby\"\"Montero (Call Me by Your Name)\"\n|-\n| Camila Cabello\n| \"Don't Go Yet\"\n|-\n| Shawn MendesTainy\n| \"Summer of Love\"\n|-\n| Doja Cat\n| \"Been Like This\"\"You Right\"\n|-\n| Chlöe\n| \"Have Mercy\"\n|-\n| Normani\n| \"Wild Side\"\n|-\n| Ozuna\n| \"La Funka\"\n|-\n| Foo Fighters\n| Global Icon Medley:\"Learn to Fly\"\"Shame Shame\"\"Everlong\"\n|-\n| Alicia KeysSwae Lee\n| \"Lala (Unlocked)\"\"Empire State of Mind\"\n|-\n| Busta RhymesSpliff Star\n| Medley:\"Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See\"\"Ante Up\"\"Scenario\"\"Touch It\"\"Look at Me Now\"\"Pass the Courvoisier\"\n|-\n| Machine Gun KellyTravis Barker\n| \"Papercuts\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" |Extended Play Stage (Presented by Coors Light)\n|-\n| Saint Jhn\n| \"Sucks To Be You\"\"Trap\"\"Roses\"\n|-\n| Latto\n| \"Big Energy\"\"Muwop\"\"Bitch from da Souf\"\n|}\nPresenters\nPresenters for the ceremony were announced on September 8, 2021.
