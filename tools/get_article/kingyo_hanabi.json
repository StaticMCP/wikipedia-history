The DVD version was sold simultaneously. It became the theme song of the Japanese television program \"Super TV\". 50,000 limited edition copies were sold which included a picture book drawn by Otsuka. It reached number three on the Oricon charts.\nMusic video\n'Kingyo Hanabi' is a simple video that shows Otsuka singing underwater and on a small island during dawn/dusk. While Otsuka is on the island, she holds a firework in her hand that emits golden sparks, which then rain down around Otsuka who is under the water. Otsuka sits on a veranda looking at a man and reaches out tentatively, but he moves away before she can hold his hand. She then slowly falls to the ground and cries before disappearing.\nTrack listing\nReferences\n*avex network inc.
