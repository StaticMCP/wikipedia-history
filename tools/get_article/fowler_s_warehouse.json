Fowler Ltd. Principally on Henry Street in Fremantle, the building extends through to Pakenham Street, and comprises offices, warehouse, engine room packing and coffee roasting house, stables and sheds. Local architect Frederick William Burwell designed the building. Burwell also designed the Central Chambers, Sail and Anchor Hotel, Victoria Pavilion, Owston's Buildings and Marmion House.\nThe City of Fremantle purchased the property in 1971 and leased it to a wool stores company. In 1991–1992 the City undertook restoration of the buildings.\nReferences"
