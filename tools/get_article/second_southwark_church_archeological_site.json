The site includes the remains of the second church to serve Southwark Parish.  It is believed to have been erected by 1673, and replaced an earlier church built about 1655.  The church was abandoned shortly after the American Revolutionary War, and stood in ruins through the American Civil War.  A monument was erected on the site in 1927.  A Virginia highway marker commemorating the church site is located near the junction of Virginia Routes 10 and 618.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.\nReferences"
