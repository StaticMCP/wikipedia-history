He joined the Amalgamated Association of Card and Blowing and Ring Room Operatives (Cardroom Amalgamation), and also the Labour Party; in 1949, he was elected to Tyldesley Urban District Council.\nKing subsequently became a full-time organiser for the Cardroom Amalgamation, then the secretary of its affiliate, the North East Lancashire Card and Blowing Room Operatives' and Ring Spinners' Association.

In 1975, King became an adviser to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service, serving for three years.\nIn his spare time, King was the founder and president of the Accrington Pakistan Friendship Association, and he also served as a magistrate.\nReferences"
