The ward was first used in the 1964 elections and last used for the 1998 elections. It returned councillors to Havering London Borough Council.\nThe ward was subject to a boundary revision in 1978 that increased the number of councillors from two to three. The ward covered part of the London County Council-built Harold Hill estate that was completed in 1958. The ward was only represented by Labour Party councillors, most notably Arthur Latham who was MP for Paddington North and then Paddington.\nList of councillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Term\n!
