      "text": "# The Queen v Brenton Harrison Tarrant\n\nThe Queen v Brenton Harrison Tarrant [2020] NZHC 2192 was a New Zealand sentencing case regarding Brenton Tarrant's involvement in the Christchurch mosque shootings after his guilty plea. It culminated in the first-ever life imprisonment without the possibility of parole sentence in New Zealand history.\nSentencing\nSentencing began on 24 August 2020 before Justice Cameron Mander at the Christchurch High Court, and it was televised. Tarrant did not oppose the sentence proposed and declined to address the court. The Crown prosecutors demonstrated to the court how Tarrant had meticulously planned the two shootings and more attacks, while numerous survivors and their relatives gave victim impact statements, which were covered by national and international media. Tarrant was then sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for each of the 51 murders, and life imprisonment for engaging in a terrorist act and 40 attempted murders. The sentence is New Zealand's first terrorism conviction. It was also the first time that life imprisonment without parole, the maximum sentence available in New Zealand, had been imposed.}} Mander said Tarrant's crimes were \"so wicked that even if you are detained until you die, it will not exhaust the requirements of punishment and denunciation.\"\nReferences\nNotes"
