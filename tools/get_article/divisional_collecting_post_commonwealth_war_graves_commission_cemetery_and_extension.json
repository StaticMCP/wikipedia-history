From 1924 to 1926, after the armistice, the cemetery was enlarged by concentrating battlefield graves and those from smaller cemeteries.\nThe cemetery and its extension were considered separate sites until their records were combined in 2001.\nThe cemetery was designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
