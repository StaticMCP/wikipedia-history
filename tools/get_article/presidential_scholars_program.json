It is described as \"one of the nation's highest honors for high school students\" in the United States of America.\nThe program was established in 1964 by executive order of Lyndon B. Johnson, then the president of the United States to recognize the most distinguished graduating seniors for their academic achievements. In 1979, it was expanded to recognize students who demonstrate exceptional talent in the visual, creative, and performing arts. In 2015, the program was expanded once again to recognize students who demonstrate ability and accomplishment in career and technical fields.\nApplication for the U.S. Presidential Scholars Program is by invitation only. Students may not apply individually to the program. The presidentially-appointed White House Commission on Presidential Scholars makes the final selection of up to 161 U.S. Presidential Scholars from among that year's senior class. All scholars are invited to Washington, D.C. in June the following year for presentation of the Presidential Scholars Medallion during a White House-sponsored ceremony.\nEligibility and selection process\nEligibility is set by the U.S. Department of Education. Students cannot apply to the program, and are nominated through screening criteria that vary depending on the type of scholarship for which they are eligible.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Nominees\n! Approximate number per year\n|-\n| Eligible students in the U.S., District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and citizens living abroad\n| 3600\n|-\n| Semifinalists\n| 620\n|-\n| Presidential Scholars\n| 161 including 20 Arts and 20 Career and Technical\n|}\nGeneral\nAll graduating high school seniors who are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents and who have scored exceptionally well on either the SAT of the College Board or the ACT Assessment of the American College Testing Program on or before October of each year are automatically considered for participation.\nThe United States Department of Education then examines the test records for the scoring students, ranks them separately for males and females, and selects the top 20 males and top 20 females in each state. Each Chief State School Officer (CSSO) may nominate up to ten male and ten female candidates, residing in the CSSO's jurisdiction, based on their outstanding scholarship.\nCandidates are notified of eligibility, and if interested in being considered for the scholarship, must submit an essay, self-assessments, high school reports, and transcripts. They are evaluated on their academic achievement, personal characteristics, leadership and service activities, and an analysis of their essay. 500 students are chosen as semifinalists. In March, the White House Commission on Presidential Scholars makes the final selection of up to 161 Presidential Scholars.\nArts\nTo be eligible, students must have registered with and been active participants in the YoungArts program. 150 students are invited to apply by the National Foundation for the Advancement of Artists. 60 YoungArts candidates enter the selection process at the semifinalist level. In April, the Commission on Presidential Scholars makes the final selection of up to 20 Presidential Scholars in the Arts.\nCareer and Technical\nNominations are submitted by each state's Chief State School Officer (CSSO). CSSOs can nominate up to five candidates who meet the requirements. In March, up to 60 candidates enter the U.S. Presidential Scholars Program selection process at the semifinalist level.
