At the 2020 census, its population was 326. It contains 63 sections of land. Parnell is located in the southeast of the township. The places of Allison, Gaynor, and Orrsburg once existed in the western portion of the township.\nIndependence Township was erected in May, 1856 when the county court ordered the northern portion of Jackson Township to be called Independence Township. In 1863 some lands east of the present boundary were ceded to Worth County.\nA settlement known as Luteston was located in the northeast of this township a bit west of  Sheridan. A post office named Lutzton operated here from 1861-1875.\nReferences"
