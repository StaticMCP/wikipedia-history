The organization subsequently decided to increase the number of acting awards again, with the new awards separated by genre of film instead of performer gender; beginning with the 12th Canadian Screen Awards in 2024, distinct awards will now be presented for Best Lead Performance in a Drama Film and Best Lead Performance in a Comedy Film.\n2020s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#bebebe;\"\n! style=\"width:8%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:19%;\"| Actor\n! style=\"width:19%;\"| Film\n! style=\"width:2%;\"| Ref\n|-\n| rowspan=\"9\" align=\"center\"| 2023  12th Canadian Screen Awards\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Amrit Kaur\n| The Queen of My Dreams\n|\n|-\n| Ariane Castellanos\n| Richelieu\n| rowspan=7|\n|-\n| Rayan Dieudonné\n| Kanaval\n|-\n| Juliette Gariépy\n| Red Rooms (Les Chambres rouges)\n|-\n| Mia Goth\n| Infinity Pool\n|-\n| Oyin Oladejo\n| Orah\n|-\n| Théodore Pellerin\n| Solo\n|-\n| Alexander Skarsgård\n| Infinity Pool\n|-\n| rowspan=\"9\" align=\"center\"| 2024  13th Canadian Screen Awards\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Sebastian Stan\n| The Apprentice\n|\n|-\n| Oluniké Adeliyi\n| Village Keeper\n| rowspan=7|\n|-\n| Christine Beaulieu\n| The Thawing of Ice (La fonte des glaces)\n|-\n| Sean Dalton\n| Skeet\n|-\n| Chaïmaa Zineddine Elidrissi\n| Gamma Rays (Les Rayons gammma)\n|-\n| Britt Lower\n| Darkest Miriam\n|-\n| Carrie-Anne Moss\n| Die Alone\n|-\n| Oshim Ottawa\n| Atikamekw Suns (Soleils Atikamekw)\n|}\nReferences"
