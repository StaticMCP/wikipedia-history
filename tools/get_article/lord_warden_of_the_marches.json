The holders were responsible for the security of the border between the two nations, and often took part in military action. They were also responsible, along with Conservators of the Truce, for administering the special type of border law known as March law.\nThe Marches on both sides of the border were traditionally split into West, Middle, and East, each with their own warden answerable to the Lord Warden-general. The English Western March was based on Carlisle and the Eastern March on Berwick-upon-Tweed.\nThe offices became unnecessary after the union of the crowns of England and Scotland under King James in 1603.\nFor England\nWarden of the Marches\n*Robert de Clifford (1297–) (died 1314)\n*John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey (1327–)\n*Henry de Percy, 2nd Baron Percy (1328–)\n*Ralph Neville, 2nd Baron
