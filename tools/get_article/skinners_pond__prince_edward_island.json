      "text": "# Skinners Pond, Prince Edward Island\n\nSkinners Pond is a rural unincorporated community in Prince County, Prince Edward Island, Canada.\nIt is located northwest of the town of Tignish in the township of Lot 1, near the northwestern tip of the province.  The primary industries for the area are agriculture and fishing.\nSkinners Pond traces its name to a small lake of the same name.  Originally the settlement was called Skinner Pond, however it was changed to Skinners Pond in 1966; note that there is no apostrophe in the name.\nThe exact population of Skinners Pond is unavailable as its population is amalgamated under the township of Lot 1 (2001 pop. 1,900).\nSkinners Pond is probably best known as the boyhood home of Canadian musician Stompin' Tom Connors, who was adopted and raised by a family on a local farm.\nThe 2021 mystery film A Small Fortune is set in Skinners Pond."
