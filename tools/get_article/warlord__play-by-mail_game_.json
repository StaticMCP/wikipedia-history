      "text": "# Warlord (play-by-mail game)\n\nWarlord is a closed-ended, computer moderated, play-by-mail (PBM) wargame.\nHistory and development\nWarlord was a closed-ended play-by-mail (PBM) wargame of moderate complexity. It was published by KJC Games in the United Kingdom. It drew from another KJC game called Casus Belli.\nGameplay\nIn Warlord, 100 players competed in a post-apocalyptic setting following nuclear war and nuclear winter. Gameplay occurred on a planet called Dexet where \"a few million people survived by taking refuge in huge underground bunkers\". Each player leads a city on the planet's surface. Survivors populated each city, led by \"power-hungry military dictators\". Players were supplied at the start with a world map and a map of their starting location, 8 × 9 sectors in size. Cities were placed randomly on the game map at 6–12 sectors apart.\nPlayers could make up to 15 orders per turn. Actions included movement and combat. Technology was basic at the outset and advances during the game. For combat, players had access to \"infantry, tanks, aircraft, and ships\". Nuclear weapons were possible later in gameplay. Diplomacy was part of gameplay, through an in-game messaging system or outside of the game. Players achieved victory by gaining control of 20% of cities.\nReception\nThe editors of GM Magazine reviewed the game in a 1990 issue, noting that it was \"fast moving with plenty going on\". They noted the importance of diplomacy and the simplicity of the game interface. They stated that it could be enjoyed by beginners and experienced gamers.\nSee also\n* List of play-by-mail games\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*"
