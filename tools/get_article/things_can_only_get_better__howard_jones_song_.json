In the US, the song reached number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and hit number 6 on the UK singles chart.\nBackground\nA typically upbeat Jones composition, it was one of two songs from the album to feature all-female singing group Afrodiziak on backing vocals. John Leland from Spin magazine wrote that \"It mines the best of the Anglo soul movement: a clean slap-bass line, precise horns and synths, and some well-paced and inviting singing\".\nThe main B-side was another album track from the UK version of the album, \"Why Look for the Key\", although with a slightly longer fade that made it about twenty seconds longer than the version on the UK version of Dream into Action. \"You Jazzy Nork!\" is a reworked instrumental version of \"Why Look for the Key\" performed by the Alphonse Conway Orchestra.\nThe cover of the 12\" single featured a photograph of Jones, in profile, sitting on a high bar stool. This image was used in silhouette for the 7\" artwork, the single being issued in several alternative sleeves with different colour backgrounds.\nMusic video\nThe music video depicts Jones singing the song as his road crew sets up equipment for a concert, followed by a transition to the show as he performs for a lively crowd. A martial artist styled after Daniel LaRusso, the protagonist of the American martial arts drama film The Karate Kid (1984), and the Tramp character made famous by Charlie Chaplin wander around backstage during the setup and later appear in the crowd. At the end of the video, the Tramp walks off hand in hand with a young girl who had earlier watched the crew at work.\nTrack listings\n7\" Elektra – 7-69651 (US)\n# \"Things Can Only Get Better\" – 3:59\n# \"Why Look for the Key\" – 3:40\n12\" Elektra – 0-66915 (US)\n# \"Things Can Only Get Better (LP Version)\" –\t3:59\n# \"What Is Love?
