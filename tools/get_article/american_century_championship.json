The site where Edgewood now stands was previously part of a ranch adjacent to Friday's Station, the historic 19th-century Pony Express station and inn. The Park family bought the ranch in 1896 to raise cattle, and in the 1960s they decided to build a golf course on their property. The course was designed by George Fazio, and opened along with the resort in 1968. The course is at the southeast edge of the lake, at an average elevation exceeding  above sea level. Fazio's nephew Tom Fazio has renovated the course, now , from time to time.\n1990s: Early tournament years\n, the inaugural winner and two-time champion.]]\nOn Friday, July 13, 1990, in Round One of the first annual Celebrity Golf Championship, Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway shot 70, with former quarterback Steve Bartkowski and former MLB player and manager Davey Johnson both trailing by one.

Smoltz was 18 points behind Fish. Despite playing from the front tees, this broke the competitive course record of 64 at Edgewood Tahoe Resort, which was set in 1984 by World Golf Hall of Famer Lee Trevino. On Sunday, July 12, before Round Three, two-time defending champion Tony Romo was forced to withdraw after sustaining a wrist injury, ending Romo's quest for a three-peat. Fish would not relinquish his 36-hole lead as he went on to win the tournament scoring 76 total points. Williams finished in second place nine points behind Fish. John Smoltz's consistency found him in third place after scoring 58 total points and Curry rallied on Sunday to score 26 points and finish fourth after scoring a combined 56 total points.\n, 2021 winner.]]\nOn Friday, July 9, 2021, in Round One of the 32nd annual American Century Championship, Modano holed out from 205 yards on the 18th hole for a double eagle, marking the first in tournament history. The double eagle was debatable because his wife Allison Micheletti was behind him but moved to the right right before Modano attempted and hit his second shot, which under the rules of golf, if caught, would have penalized him by two strokes and given him a birdie instead. Under Rule 10.2b(4), when a player begins taking a stance for the stroke and until the stroke is made, the player's caddie must not deliberately stand in a location on or close to an extension of the line of play behind the ball for any reason. Had Modano been made aware of the breach before he signed his scorecard, the two strokes would have needed to have been added. If he was unaware about the penalty and signed his scorecard, the penalty could still be added after the scorecard was returned and before the tournament was over. A disqualification penalty would only be incurred if he had known about the penalty before returning his scorecard and had failed to add this to his score. Nevertheless, this gave him ten points and jumped him into a tie for first place with Smoltz with 25 points scored each. Wagner and Dallas Stars center and right wing Joe Pavelski both trailed by only one point each. On Saturday, July 10, in Round Two, Smoltz lead after two rounds racking up 51 points, with former NBA player and coach Vinny Del Negro trailing by two points back and Wagner four points back of the leader. On Sunday, July 11, in Round Three, Del Negro had an eagle putt for the win on the 18th hole but left it a little short and settled for birdie. Smoltz made his par putt for one point to give him 69 total points, forcing a sudden-death playoff, the fourth in tournament history, between him and Del Negro. Romo scored 66 total points to finish in third place. In the sudden-death playoff, Smoltz hit his drive to the right, hit his next shot into a tree branch, and proceeded to go for the hole on his third shot, but it ended up splashing into \"Lake Laimbeer\". Another birdie on the 18th hole gave an emotional Del Negro the win as he dedicated the win to his late father who had died on Wednesday. He became the first person in basketball to win the tournament.\nOn Friday, July 8, 2022, in Round One of the 33rd annual American Century Championship, Washington Capitals right winger T. J. Oshie scored 21 points, with Mulder and Sörenstam both trailing by a single point back. On Saturday, July 9, in Round Two, Mulder takes a decent lead with 45 total points heading into the final round, but was ultimately unable to seal the deal. Fish trailed by three points behind Mulder and Thielen and Lowe both scored 38 total points each. On Sunday, July 10, in Round Three, Romo and Pavelski score 25 and 27 points respectively to force a three-way sudden-death playoff with Mulder, as they all finish with 62 points each. 62 total points accumulated through three rounds of play is the lowest ever by the leaders under this format. This was the fifth playoff in tournament history and the first playoff to happen in consecutive years. On the second playoff hole, Mulder and Pavelski both hit a tree on their drives and Romo capitalizes with a birdie to win his third ACC Championship. Over 67,000 spectators attended that summer, setting a tournament record.\n(left) with son and 2023 winner Stephen Curry (right) in 2016.]]\nOn Friday, July 14, 2023, before Round One of the 34th annual American Century Championship, as Curry was being introduced on the first tee, the opening tee box announcer named some of his biggest accomplishments and mentioned \"...but he still hasn't won the big one... The American Century Championship.\" That would change by the end of the weekend. After a quick start on Friday, Curry ended the first round with the lead, having scored 27 points. Pavelski trailed by four points back and Anaheim Ducks left wing Alex Killorn trailed Pavelski by two. Curry topped his performance on Saturday, July 15, in Round Two, with a hole-in-one on the seventh hole from 165 yards. This was the first time someone made a hole-in-one on the seventh hole and the fifth in tournament history, as well as Curry's second hole-in-one. He finished the day in the lead once more with 50 points so far. Fish and Pavelski both trailed by three points each. On Sunday, July 16, Fish tied Curry coming off of the front nine in Round Three, which was a classic shootout. Fish claimed the lead and held it for most of the back nine. Fish held a three-point lead over Curry going into the 18th and final hole. The tournament finish was controversial because a fan interrupted the outcome. As Fish approached the tee box, a heckler yelled at him \"Hey, Fish, f––– you, you suck!\" The heckler then screamed bird noises right in his backswing as Fish hooked it to the right in the trees. The fan tried to scurry away and was tracked down by Curry and Fish's caddies as well as Stephen's father, Dell Curry, who regularly plays in the tournaments with his sons and was previously Stephen's caddie in the past. It was later revealed that the fan had money on Curry to win the tournament. Fish had to settle for par. Curry won the tournament by making an essential clutch eagle for a walk-off win. Had he missed the putt, he would have lost. He finished the event with 75 points, two more points than Fish and nine more points than Pavelski. He became the first active player to win the event since Del Greco in 2000 (fifth total), the second in basketball to win it, and the first African-American to win the event. A record 76,810 fans came out to watch.\nOn Thursday, April 18, 2024, it was rumored that Stephen Curry would not be able to play if he were to participate as a member of the United States men's national basketball team at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, France. On Tuesday, May 7, 2024, it was confirmed. A regular staple, this is the first time Curry will miss the event since 2012 and will make him the first reigning champion in tournament history not to defend the title. On Friday, July 12, 2024, in Round One of the 35th annual American Century Championship, Carolina Panthers wide receiver Adam Thielen scored 24 points with Fish trailing by only one point. Lowe and Pavelski both scored 21 points, respectively. The shot of the day came on the par-three 12th hole, when NFL and College Football Hall of Fame wide receiver Tim Brown made a hole-in-one from 143 yards, the sixth hole-in-one in tournament history and the first ever occurrence on that particular hole. NFL and College Football Hall of Fame running back, fellow Heisman Trophy winner, and former Raider teammate Marcus Allen then made him realize that he had won a 2024 MasterCraft X24 boat collaborated with TravisMathew worth $200,000.00 after he had told him. On Saturday, July 13, in Round Two, Fish moved into the lead after two rounds with 57 total points, with Pavelski trailing by seven points back and Thielen 12 points back of the leader. Fish scored 34 points on the day, giving him possession of the top two single round modified Stableford scoring system point totals. On Sunday, July 14, in Round Three, despite Pavelski making a charge, Fish would again not relinquish his 36-hole lead, as he went on to win the tournament, making him the eighth multi-time winner in tournament history. Fish scored 83 total points, the second most ever in tournament history, and scored 60 points in Rounds Two and Three, the most ever for Rounds Two and Three and the most for any two consecutive rounds. Pavelski finished in second place with 79 total points and Sörenstam finished in third place with 68 total points. This summer set a new attendance record of 77,049 fans.\n, 2025 winner.]]\nOn Friday, July 11, 2025, in Round One of the 36th annual American Century Championship, Pavelski scored 23 points with Del Negro trailing by only one point. Former soccer player Taylor Twellman and Stephen Curry both scored 21 points, respectively. On Saturday, July 12, in Round Two, Pavelski tied Twellman for the co-lead after two rounds with 44 total points, with country music singer Jake Owen trailing by three points. The shot of the day on Day Two came on the par-three 12th hole, when former MLB player Jimmy Rollins made a hole-in-one from 139 yards, the seventh hole-in-one in tournament history and the second ever (consecutive) occurrence on that particular hole. This is the third straight year with an ace at the tournament. He won a 2024 MasterCraft X24 boat collaborated with TravisMathew worth $200,000.00. On Sunday, July 14, in Round Three, Pavelski won the tournament with a dramatic eagle on the eighteenth and final hole, finishing with 73 total points. He celebrated his birthday on Friday, his wedding anniversary on Saturday, and celebrated his win very similar to Curry's two years ago. Smoltz finished in second place with 64 total points and Owen finished in third place with 62 total points.\nTraditions\n(right) after teeing off and Marshall Faulk (left) getting ready to tee off in 2008]]\nteeing off in 2008]]\n(right) and Ray Allen (left) in 2008]]\napproaching the green from the beach on the 17th hole in 2008]]\nspeaking to kids about cyberbullying at the event in 2017]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\"| Legend\n|-\n|style=\"background:#CFECEC; width:1em\"|^\n|As active professional athlete\n|-\n| style=\"background:#afe6ba; width:3em;\"|\n| Won the tournament\n|-\n| style=\"background:#98fb98; width:3em;\"|\n| Tournament record\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; background-color:#eeabab;\"|^\n| Denotes single tournament participants record progression\n|-\n|}\nAwards\nThe total prize money for the 2023 American Century Championship was $600,000, with $125,000 going to the winner.

Although participation by professional golfers is usually avoided, a handful of female players with professional and/or collegiate experience have been invited to play, the most notable being Annika Sörenstam, who has one runner-up finish at Edgewood Lake Tahoe. The size of the field has gradually increased over the years to meet the growing interest of celebrities wanting to compete. 93 players were a part of the 2023 event.\nMost wins\nThe first winner of this celebrity golf tournament was Mark Rypien in 1990, and he repeated in 2014. The player with the most tournament victories is Rick Rhoden, who won eight times between 1991 and 2009. Dan Quinn has five wins, followed by Billy Joe Tolliver with four, and Mark Mulder and Tony Romo have three titles to their name. Rypien was the tournament's first foreign-born winner in the inaugural event with his first victory in 1990. Two-time champions include Jack Wagner, Rypien, and Mardy Fish.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!# !! Year !! Winner !! ProfessionPosition !!

It was originally titled The Celebrity Golf Association, the brainchild of Jim Karvellas. Initially, the tournament had no title sponsor, but landed three future Hall of Fame players from different sports: John Elway, Michael Jordan, and Mario Lemieux. Karvellas is quoted as saying: \"They are here at Caesars Tahoe this week, because they believe in the concept, they love the game of golf and they like to compete. I shall be forever indebted to them for that.\"\nRound 1 of the American Century Championship starts on Friday and is broadcast live on NBC Sports and Peacock from 4:00 to 6:00 PM ET. After Round 1 is recorded, the tape plays on Golf Channel from 9:30 to 11:30 PM ET. Rounds 2 and 3 of the American Century Championship follows and concludes on Saturday and Sunday, respectively. Both are broadcast live on NBC Sports and Peacock from 2:30 to 6:00 PM ET.\nNaming rights\nThe first tournament was held  in 1990 and sponsored by NBC, which broadcasts the second and third round coverage on the weekend. The inaugural tournament was the first annual Celebrity Golf Championship. Isuzu sponsored the tournament from 1992 through 1998, making it the annual Isuzu Celebrity Golf Championship. On Monday, September 21, 1998, American Isuzu Motors Inc. announced that it would no longer be sponsoring the event. Current sponsor American Century Investments succeeded Isuzu in 1998, making it the American Century Celebrity Golf Championship from 1998 to 2002. Since 2003, it has been the American Century Championship. In July 2015, American Century Investments extended its sponsorship to 2022. On Monday, July 10, 2023, NBC Sports and American Century Investments announced a six-year extension of the American Century Championship through 2029.\nTicketing\nTickets are $40.00 for practice rounds and $50.00 for actual rounds.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
