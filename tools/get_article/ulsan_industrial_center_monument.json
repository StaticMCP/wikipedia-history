Like the monument's number of pillars, it contains 5 exits (from North and counterclockwise Bongwol-ro, Munsu-ro, Duwang-ro, Suam-ro, Samsan-ro) and is egg-like asymmetric because of this. As it is the most 'rushing' intersection in Ulsan, the rotary has been functioning as de facto bus transfer center, which is in fact not available in the city yet.\nList of bus stops named after Gongeoptap\nThere are 4 city bus stops and 2 intercity bus stops which use 'Gongeoptap' name around the rotary, listed in Bus Information System. The stops are:\n* Samsan-ro\n** 공업탑 (BIS No. 40401, [https://www.google.com/maps/place/35%C2%B031'57.7%22N+129%C2%B018'35.4%22E/@35.5326854,129.3091417,340m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0 Google Maps]) - East bound, incorrectly informed as 'route to Taehwagang station' but actually buses do not go straight through.\n** 공업탑 (BIS No. 40403, [https://www.google.com/maps/place/35%C2%B031'58.0%22N+129%C2%B018'36.7%22E/@35.5327764,129.3094847,340m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0 Google Maps]) - East bound, no description but the actual bus stop for buses route to Taehwagang station.\n** 공업탑 (BIS No. 40402, [https://www.google.com/maps/place/35%C2%B031'58.3%22N+129%C2%B018'32.7%22E/@35.5328714,129.3083927,340m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0 Google Maps]) - West bound, informed as 'route to Gongeoptop' and in reality buses turn the rotary.\n** 공업탑 (BIS No. 40404, [https://www.google.com/maps/place/35%C2%B031'58.6%22N+129%C2%B018'33.9%22E/@35.5329344,129.3087127,340m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0 Google Maps]) - West bound, no description but for buses that go directly Bongwol-ro or Munsu-ro.\n** 공업탑 ([https://www.google.com/maps/place/35%C2%B031'59.3%22N+129%C2%B018'41.4%22E/@35.5331351,129.3109503,271m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0 Google Maps]): East bound, intercity/Express unload only.\n* Munsu-ro\n** 공업탑 시외정류소 ([https://www.google.com/maps/place/35%C2%B031'58.6%22N+129%C2%B018'16.6%22E/@35.5329414,129.3039148,340m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0 Google Maps]): West bound, intercity load only; there was a city bus stop with the same name and location but removed in 2015.\nReferences"
