In 2011, it was temporarily taken down during the construction of an underground railway station and sent to restorers. However, when it was about to be reinstalled, a minority of Praga's residents objected, as they perceived the monument as a remnant of the Communist era. In surveys carried out by the city council and Gazeta Wyborcza in 2012 and 2013 respectively, the majority of Warsaw's residents said they would like the monument to be returned to its original place or placed somewhere nearby. In  2015, the Warsaw City Council overturned its earlier decision to return the monument and made the removal permanent.\nThe monument was colloquially known as 'the four sleepers' or 'the four mourners' ( or ), in reference to the figures of two Polish and two Soviet soldiers with bowed heads at the four corners of the monument.\nReferences"
