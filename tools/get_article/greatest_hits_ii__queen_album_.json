The album consisted of Queen's biggest hits between 1981 and 1991, from the UK chart-topper \"Under Pressure\" to \"The Show Must Go On\".\nThe compilation Greatest Hits II reached number one on the UK Albums Chart, and is the tenth best-selling album in the UK with sales of 3.9 million copies as of 2014. It is the seventh best-selling album in Germany, the thirteenth best-selling album in France, and the best-selling album by a foreign artist in Finland. Accumulated sales (Greatest Hits II and Classic Queen for the US and Canada combined) are in excess of 25 million worldwide.\nFreddie Mercury designed the crest on the album cover, using the astrological signs of the four members: two Leos (Roger Taylor and John Deacon), one Cancer (Brian May) and one Virgo (Mercury).\nContent\nThe compilation contains most of Queen's hits from 1981 to 1991. The singles \"Body Language\", \"Back Chat\", \"Las Palabras de Amor\", \"Thank God It's Christmas\", \"Princes of the Universe\" and \"Scandal\" were omitted for this release. \"Las Palabras de Amor\", \"Thank God It's Christmas\", \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\" and \"Princes of the Universe\" were later included on Greatest Hits III.\nRelease\nGreatest Hits II was released less than a month before the death of lead singer Freddie Mercury and was the last Queen release of any kind while he was still alive. The album was not initially made available in the United States and was replaced with its counterpart Classic Queen in early 1992 to capitalise on the band's renewed popularity in the country following the inclusion of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" in ''Wayne's World. Greatest Hits II was later made available in the US with its inclusion in two box sets, Greatest Hits I & II in 1994, and The Platinum Collection: Greatest Hits I, II & III in 2002. On 19 April 2011, Hollywood Records released the newly remastered version of Greatest Hits II in the United States as an individual album for the first time.\nA companion video release entitled Greatest Flix II was released at the same time, but is currently out of print. Most of the videos are now available on the DVD Greatest Video Hits 2 with the exception of the videos from the 1991 Innuendo'' album.\nTrack listing\n| title1          = A Kind of Magic\n| note1           = early fade\n| length1         = 4:22\n| title2          = Under Pressure\n| note2           = edited version\n| length2         = 3:58\n| title3          = Radio Ga Ga\n| length3         = 5:43\n| title4          = I Want It All\n| note4           = single version\n| length4         = 4:01\n| title5          = I Want to Break Free\n| note5           = single remix\n| length5         = 4:18\n| title6          = Innuendo\n| length6         = 6:27\n| title7          = It's a Hard Life\n| length7         = 4:09\n| title8          = Breakthru\n| length8         = 4:09\n| title9          = Who Wants to Live Forever\n| note9           = edited version\n| length9         = 4:57\n| title10         = Headlong\n| note10          = original Innuendo LP edit\n| length10        = 4:33\n| title11         = The Miracle\n| note11          = early fade\n| length11        = 4:54\n| title12         = I'm Going Slightly Mad\n| note12          = original Innuendo LP edit\n| length12        = 4:07\n| title13         = The Invisible Man\n| length13        = 3:58\n| title14         = Hammer to Fall\n| note14          = single version\n| length14        = 3:40\n| title15         = Friends Will Be Friends\n| length15        = 4:10\n| title16         = The Show Must Go On\n| note16          = early fade-out\n| length16        = 4:23\n| title17         = One Vision\n| note17          = single version\n| length17        = 4:01\n|total_length = 75:57\n}}\n| total_length    = 79:53\n| title18         = I Was Born to Love You\n| note18          = From Made in Heaven, 1995\n| writer18        = Mercury\n| length18        = 4:48\n}}\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" border=\"1\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (1991)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|Australian Top 50 Albums\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n|-\n|Finnish Top 100 Albums\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|Netherlands Top 100 Albums\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|New Zealand Top 40 Albums\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|Swiss Top 100 Albums\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|UK Albums Chart\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" border=\"1\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (1992)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|Austrian Top 75 Albums\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|French Compilations\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|German Albums Chart\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n|-\n|Hungarian Top 40 Albums\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|Norwegian Top 40 Albums\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Portuguese Albums (AFP)\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|Swedish Top 60 Albums\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n|-\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" border=\"1\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2006)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|Italian Top 100 Albums\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|28\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" border=\"1\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2008)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n| Mexican Albums (AMPROFON)\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |10\n|-\n|Spanish Top 100 Albums\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|45\n|-\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" border=\"1\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2012)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" border=\"1\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2025)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2019–2025)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Portuguese Albums (AFP)\n| 151\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1991)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| New Zealand Albums (RMNZ)\n| 34\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1992)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| New Zealand Albums (RMNZ)\n| 2\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1993)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| New Zealand Albums (RMNZ)\n| 28\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!scope=\"column\"|Chart (1997)\n!scope=\"column\"|Position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|German Albums Chart\n|72\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
