He introduced his system of classification at the library; this has since been adopted wholly or in part by various librarians. The system is a combination of the three fundamental subsystems — classified, alphabetical, and numerical. Methods of management that were followed there were also devised by him.\nSchwartz contributed to the Library Journal and other periodicals.\nReferences"
