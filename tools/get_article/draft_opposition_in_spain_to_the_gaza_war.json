From the earliest days of the conflict, Spain called for a ceasefire, for the protection of civilian populations in the Gaza Strip, and for unimpeded access for humanitarian aid.\nPrime Minister Pedro Sánchez repeatedly described Israel’s response in Gaza as disproportionate, warning that it risked destabilizing the region.\nThe Spanish government has taken a series of measures reflecting its opposition to Israel’s conduct during the war, including announcing a de facto arms embargo, blocking the transit of certain military shipments through Spanish ports, increasing humanitarian aid to Gaza, and supporting international legal inquiries and calls for accountability.\nAt the same time, Spanish diplomats have reaffirmed Spain’s condemnation of terrorism, including Hamas, and expressed solidarity with Israeli civilians affected by the October 7 attacks. A recurring theme in Spain’s statements has been the plea for responses that respect international law and avoid civilian harm.\nBackground\nThe Gaza war began after the October 7 attacks carried out by Hamas against southern Israel, which killed around 1,200 people and triggered a large-scale Israeli military offensive in the Gaza Strip. The conflict has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths, widespread destruction in Gaza, and a severe humanitarian crisis.\nSpain has historically supported a negotiated two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, maintaining diplomatic relations with both Israel and the State of Palestine. In 2014, the Spanish Congress of Deputies passed a non-binding resolution urging the Government of Spain to recognize Palestine as a state. Spain also contributes to EU humanitarian and development assistance for the Palestinian territories and has regularly condemned attacks on civilians by both sides.\nPublic opinion in Spain has traditionally shown stronger sympathy toward the Palestinian cause than in many other Western European countries. Surveys conducted before the 2023 war found that a clear majority of Spaniards supported the recognition of a Palestinian state, while showing limited trust in the Israeli government.\nSpanish government stance\n, Prime Minister of Spain.]]\nThe Government of Spain condemned the October 7 attacks by Hamas as acts of terrorism while simultaneously urging Israel to respect international humanitarian law in its military response. From the first days of the Gaza war, Spanish officials emphasized the need for a proportionate reaction and called for the protection of civilians in the Gaza Strip.\nPrime Minister Pedro Sánchez and Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares repeatedly called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, warning that Israel’s “disproportionate response” risked destabilizing the region. Spain supported multiple UN General Assembly resolutions demanding a ceasefire and humanitarian access, and voted in favor of UN Security Council Resolution 2728, which called for an immediate ceasefire linked to the release of hostages.\nIn November 2023, Sánchez and Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo visited the Rafah crossing on the Egypt–Gaza border, where Sánchez stated that “the indiscriminate killing of civilians is unacceptable” and called for a political solution based on the two-state solution.\nThe Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced increased humanitarian funding for Gaza through UNRWA and other agencies, while halting the approval of new arms export licenses to Israel, effectively imposing a de facto arms embargo.\nSpain’s stance has created tensions within the governing coalition, with the PSOE maintaining a cautious diplomatic tone while the left-wing Sumar alliance called for stronger measures such as the suspension of the EU–Israel Association Agreement.\nSpanish government stance: 2024–2025 developments\n:Positions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Spain.]]\nIn June 2025 Spain, through its Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares, urged the international community to support a Spain-drafted United Nations General Assembly resolution condemning Israel’s blockade of the Gaza Strip and violence across the Palestinian Territories. He highlighted that the blockade was preventing humanitarian aid, medicine, and food from reaching Gaza.\nAlso in June 2025, Spain introduced a resolution together with Palestine at a UN emergency special session, titled the “Spanish-Palestinian resolution on civilian population protection and humanitarian obligations in relation to the conflict in Gaza,” which was approved by the General Assembly with 149 votes in favour and 12 against.\nIn August 2025, the Foreign Ministry signalled support for a temporary UN-led mission intended to stabilise Gaza, suggesting that such a mission could help toward establishing a Palestinian state administration and improve peace and security for all.\n:Diplomatic actions\nOn September 9, 2025, the Spanish Council of Ministers approved a series of measures to pressure Israel. These include: approval of a Royal Decree-Law to legally consolidate the arms embargo on Israel (which had been in de facto place since October 2023); ban on ships carrying fuels used by the Israeli armed forces calling at Spanish ports; prohibition of military material transport aircraft using Spanish airspace; ban on entry to Spain of those directly involved in genocide, war crimes, etc.; ban on products from illegal settlements; restriction of consular services for Spanish citizens in illegal settlements; and increased humanitarian aid and cooperation projects. The Spanish government set a target for humanitarian and cooperation assistance to Gaza to reach 150 million euros by end of 2025.\nAlso in September 2025, Spain summoned Israel’s acting ambassador in Madrid in response to comments from the Israeli Prime Minister’s office, which had accused Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of making “blatant genocidal threats.” The Foreign Ministry rejected those accusations as false and defamatory.\n:Internal changes / tensions within the government coalition\nThere is evidence of division within Spain’s governing coalition (primarily between PSOE and Sumar) over the intensity of measures to oppose Israel’s conduct in the Gaza war. While PSOE has generally supported diplomatic and humanitarian pressure, Sumar and other left-wing actors have pushed for stronger-action, including sanctions and more public condemnation.\nSpain officially recognised the State of Palestine on 28 May 2024, together with Ireland and Norway. This move was supported by left and progressive parties and seen as a fulfillment of longtime positions, though it also generated diplomatic tension with Israel.\nIn September 2025, following Spain’s announcement of the new package of measures (arms embargo, bans on ports, etc.), Israel responded by banning two Spanish ministers from entering Israel. Spain in turn recalled its ambassador, escalating diplomatic tensions.\nSports diplomacy\nIn March 2025, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez called on international sports governing bodies to suspend Israel from global competitions, drawing a parallel with the exclusion of Russia from many sporting events following its invasion of Ukraine. Sánchez argued that “a state accused of committing genocide cannot be treated as a normal competitor” and urged the IOC and international federations to take action.\nShortly afterwards, the Consejo Superior de Deportes (CSD) sent a formal request to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) supporting Sánchez’s proposal and urging the Olympic Movement to take “coherent action to uphold international humanitarian law.”\nPublic broadcasting decisions\n, Spain’s public broadcasting corporation]]\n]]\nDuring the Eurovision Song Contest 2025, the Spanish public broadcaster RTVE aired a disclaimer before the broadcast condemning the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip and citing official figures on the number of civilian victims of the Gaza war. The statement affirmed RTVE’s commitment to “the defence of human rights and international humanitarian law.”\nOn 16 September 2025, RTVE announced that it would not participate in or broadcast future editions of the Eurovision Song Contest if Israel takes part. RTVE justified its decision as a matter of ethical responsibility and human rights, stating that it could not “provide entertainment coverage that normalises a state currently under investigation for possible genocide.”\nThe announcement triggered a broad public debate in Spain and drew international media attention, with some praising the decision as consistent with Spain’s stance on the Gaza war and others criticising it as politicising a cultural event.\nIn response, the EBU stated that Spain had become the fifth country to refuse participation after Ireland, Iceland, Slovenia and Norway, and the first of the so-called Big Five (the five largest financial contributors to the contest) to take such a stance. The EBU announced that it would review the situation and issue a formal decision on Israel’s participation by December 2025.\nPolitical parties and institutions\n:Positions of major national political parties\nSpain’s political parties have shown markedly different stances regarding the Gaza war and the country’s policy response:\nThe governing Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party (PSOE) has supported the Spanish government’s diplomatic efforts, humanitarian aid initiatives, and recognition of the State of Palestine, while avoiding the use of terms such as “genocide” to describe Israeli actions. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez framed Spain’s policy as one of “peace, international law and protection of civilians.”\nThe left-wing Sumar alliance, part of the governing coalition, has been far more critical of Israel’s actions, repeatedly describing them as “genocide” and calling for sanctions, suspension of the EU–Israel Association Agreement, and a total diplomatic freeze. Sumar ministers pushed for Spain to lead a European arms embargo and advocated for prosecuting Israeli leaders before the International Criminal Court.\nThe conservative People’s Party (PP) has supported Israel’s “right to self-defense” and criticized the government’s rhetoric as “unbalanced” and “harmful to Spain’s international credibility.” PP opposed the recognition of Palestine, arguing it should occur only as part of a negotiated peace settlement.\nThe far-right Vox party strongly aligned itself with Israel, rejecting any criticism of its military operations and framing opposition as “anti-Semitic.” Vox opposed humanitarian funding for Gaza and criticized the government for “siding with terrorists.”\nSeveral regional and nationalist parties, including Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC), EH Bildu, PNV and Junts, have backed calls for an arms embargo, recognition of Palestine, and stronger action to halt Israeli attacks on civilians. ERC and Bildu MPs displayed Palestinian flags during parliamentary sessions in solidarity.\n:Resolutions and debates in the Spanish parliament\nin the XV legislature.]]\nThe Congress of Deputies held multiple debates on Spain’s stance during the Gaza war. In November 2023, it passed a motion urging the government to suspend arms exports to Israel, increase humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, and support international investigations of alleged war crimes.\nIn May 2024, the chamber supported the government’s decision to officially recognize the State of Palestine in a symbolic vote, with 172 votes in favor (PSOE, Sumar, ERC, Bildu, PNV, Junts) — 150 against (PP, Vox) and 28 abstentions.\nParliamentary debate on Gaza continued throughout 2024 and 2025, often marked by high tension and visible protest inside the chamber. Several MPs from Sumar, ERC and Bildu unfurled Palestinian flags during plenary sessions and held up posters reading “Ceasefire Now” and “Stop the genocide,” actions that drew formal complaints from the PP and Vox groups for “turning the chamber into an activist stage.”\nIn February 2025, the Congress passed a non-binding resolution calling on the government to downgrade diplomatic relations with Israel, ban the entry of Israeli officials who have supported forced displacement of Palestinians, and prohibit the use of Spanish airspace and ports for transporting weapons to Israel. The motion was approved with 178 votes in favor and 161 against, reflecting the governing coalition’s alignment on the issue.\nThe Senate — where the PP holds a majority — adopted several non-binding motions criticizing the government’s stance as “biased” and demanding a “balanced policy” supporting Israel’s right to defend itself. Despite this, the upper chamber also endorsed an increase in humanitarian aid to Gaza by a large cross-party majority, while rejecting sanctions proposals against Israel tabled by left-wing parties.\n:Statements by the Spanish monarchy\nIn September 2025, King Felipe VI publicly denounced the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip during an official address at the opening of the judicial year in Madrid. The monarch expressed “deep concern over the unbearable suffering of civilians, especially children,” and urged the international community to “redouble efforts to ensure the protection of the civilian population and the effective delivery of humanitarian aid.” His remarks were interpreted as an implicit call for a ceasefire and were widely reported in Spanish and international media.\n:Regional parliaments and local governments\nSeveral regional parliaments and large city councils adopted motions condemning Israeli attacks on civilians and calling for a ceasefire. The Parliament of Catalonia passed a resolution in December 2023 urging the Spanish government to break military ties with Israel and support the recognition of Palestine.\nThe City Council of Barcelona suspended its twin-city relationship with Tel Aviv in February 2023, citing “systematic violations of Palestinian human rights,” and later reaffirmed this position during the Gaza war.\nOther local councils, including Madrid, Valencia, and Seville, passed symbolic motions calling for a ceasefire and humanitarian aid, often along party lines.\nThe Government of the Principality of Asturias and its president, Adrián Barbón, have taken public positions critical of Israel’s conduct during the Gaza war and expressed solidarity with the Palestinian people.\nIn August 2025, during the opening ceremony of the annual International Sella River Descent (one of Asturias’s most prominent sporting events), the regional government displayed the Palestinian flag alongside the Asturian flag as a gesture of support for victims of the war in Gaza. Barbón stated that “Asturias cannot remain silent in the face of the massacre of civilians” and urged a ceasefire and respect for international humanitarian law.\nIn September 2025, the Asturian government withdrew the attendance of its ministers from the official stages of the Vuelta a España cycling race in protest against Israel’s participation in the event. The decision was announced after Israel’s national team was confirmed to compete. Barbón explained that “representatives of the Asturian government cannot participate in acts alongside a state accused of committing genocide.”\nThese symbolic actions positioned Asturias as one of the first Spanish autonomous communities to explicitly condemn what its government described as “the genocide against the Palestinian people.”\n:Resignations or internal protests\nNo high-ranking government officials resigned over Spain’s stance on the Gaza war, but several career diplomats expressed discomfort with what they described as “excessive alignment with Sumar’s rhetoric.”\nA few PSOE MPs privately criticized the government’s recognition of Palestine as “premature,” though they ultimately voted in favor to preserve party unity.\nCivil society and NGOs\n:Human rights, humanitarian and development NGOs\nSeveral major Spanish NGOs active in human rights, humanitarian aid, and international cooperation have condemned Israel’s military operations in the Gaza Strip and called for a ceasefire.\nThe Spanish section of Amnesty International denounced “indiscriminate attacks against civilians” and urged the Government of Spain to halt all arms exports to Israel and support international investigations of alleged war crimes.\nOxfam Intermón, Médicos del Mundo, and Acción contra el Hambre coordinated joint appeals urging Spain and the EU to press for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and increase funding for emergency aid to Gaza.\nCruz Roja Española expanded its humanitarian programs in Gaza and coordinated the delivery of medical supplies and food funded by the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID).\n:Trade unions, professional associations and civic platforms\nSpain’s two largest trade unions — the CCOO and the UGT — condemned the Israeli attacks on civilians and called for an arms embargo and respect for international law. They urged the Spanish government to “act firmly to stop the massacre.”\nThe Organización Médica Colegial de España denounced the bombing of hospitals and the targeting of health personnel, and coordinated statements from regional medical colleges demanding protection of healthcare workers in conflict zones.\nThe Consejo General de la Abogacía Española expressed concern over possible violations of international law and offered legal support to international investigations.\nCitizen platforms such as Plataforma Solidaridad con Palestina and Red Solidaria contra la Ocupación de Palestina (RESCOP) organized regular demonstrations, public debates, and lobbying campaigns targeting Spanish MPs and MEPs.\nCampaigns and public actions\n:Civil society groups launched several high-profile campaigns in Spain in response to the Gaza war:\nIn late 2023, RESCOP coordinated a nationwide boycott campaign targeting companies supplying weapons or surveillance technology to Israel, with dozens of local councils approving symbolic motions supporting the boycott.\nIn February 2024, over 700 Spanish cultural figures, including writers, musicians and filmmakers, signed an open letter calling on the government to suspend all arms trade with Israel and support the prosecution of war crimes at the International Criminal Court.\nThroughout 2024 and 2025, weekly demonstrations in major cities such as Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and Seville gathered thousands of participants demanding a ceasefire, lifting of the blockade, and recognition of Palestine.\n:Freedom Flotilla\nIn July 2024, a group of Spanish activists, humanitarian workers and members of civil society organisations took part in the Freedom Flotilla — an international initiative aimed at breaking the naval blockade of the Gaza Strip and delivering humanitarian aid. The Spanish contingent, sailing aboard the vessel María under the banner of the coalition Rumbo a Gaza, included representatives of human rights NGOs, trade unions and cultural associations. The flotilla was intercepted in international waters by the Israeli Navy, which boarded the ships and diverted them to the port of Ashdod. The Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the interception as “an excessive use of force” and formally requested the release of the detained activists.\nAcademia, intellectuals and cultural sector\n:Writers, academics and scientists\nNumerous Spanish intellectuals, university professors, and scientists condemned Israel’s military operations in the Gaza Strip and urged the Government of Spain and the EU to demand an immediate ceasefire and accountability.\nIn February 2024, dozens of Spanish scientists and health researchers from institutions such as the CSIC and the Carlos III Health Institute condemned the targeting of hospitals, laboratories, and water infrastructure in Gaza as violations of international humanitarian law.\n:Artists, filmmakers, musicians and actors\n, one of the most prominent Spanish artists to describe Israel’s war in Gaza as genocide.]]\nSpain’s cultural sector has been especially vocal in demanding an end to the war. Between late 2023 and 2025, over 1,500 Spanish artists, writers, filmmakers, musicians and other cultural figures publicly expressed their opposition to Israel’s military operations in Gaza. Actions included open letters, artistic performances, public statements, and cultural boycotts of events sponsored by Israeli institutions.\nIn February 2024, more than 700 Spanish cultural figures — including prominent writers, filmmakers, musicians, and visual artists — signed an open letter urging the government to suspend all arms trade with Israel and to support the prosecution of alleged war crimes at the International Criminal Court. The manifesto was led by filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar and signed by other high-profile cultural figures such as Javier Bardem, Penélope Cruz, Fernando León de Aranoa, Rozalén, Vetusta Morla, and Isabel Coixet.\nIn addition to written statements, numerous symbolic and performative acts took place. Spanish actors and musicians expressed public support for Palestine during award ceremonies, concerts and theatre premieres. At the 2024 Goya Awards, several winners wore pins of the Palestinian flag and called for a ceasefire in their acceptance speeches, receiving standing ovations. Similar actions were repeated at the Premios Max, the Premios Ondas and several major summer music festivals.\nIn September 2025, Javier Bardem used his presence at the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards to draw media attention to the situation in the Gaza. In interviews on the red carpet and to international media outlets covering the event, and later during his on-stage speech, he described Israel’s actions as “a genocide against the Palestinian people” and urged the international community to “stop the massacre” and hold those responsible accountable under international law. Bardem’s remarks were widely reported in Spanish and international media, sparking both praise and criticism.\n.]]\nAt the National Cinematography Award ceremony, actor Eduard Fernández used his acceptance speech to condemn the \"barbarity\" and \"genocide\" in Gaza. In a symbolic act of solidarity, Fernández wore a Palestinian keffiyeh and read out the names of children killed in the conflict, stressing that he could not remain silent in the face of the humanitarian crisis. He also stated that those who are not moved by the atrocities \"have a profound problem with their own humanity\".\n:Universities and research institutions\nSeveral Spanish universities formally condemned the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and called for political action. The Complutense University of Madrid, University of Valencia, University of the Basque Country and others issued joint statements urging the Spanish government and the EU to push for a ceasefire, while offering scholarships for displaced Palestinian students.\nIn November 2023, over 250 Spanish university lecturers and researchers — including professors from the Complutense University of Madrid, the University of Barcelona, and the University of Granada — signed a statement denouncing the “indiscriminate killing of civilians” and calling for an arms embargo on Israel.\nIn June 2024, after weeks of student protests organized by Acampada UniOvi, the University of Oviedo reached an agreement that formally condemned the military intervention in the Gaza Strip. The university acknowledged the structural causes of the conflict, reaffirmed its support for an immediate and lasting ceasefire, and called for the release of all hostages. It stated that its position was aligned with multiple United Nations resolutions and supported by opinions issued by the International Court of Justice.\nAs part of the agreement, the university pledged to suspend all academic and institutional collaborations with Israeli institutions and companies until conditions in Gaza ensure peace and respect for human rights. The deal also included measures to enhance ethical transparency, such as creating an Ethics Committee with student representation and submitting a proposal to the CRUE for a joint institutional statement on the conflict.\nA month earlier, in May 2024, the CRUE had already urged the European Commission to review its research cooperation programs with Israeli institutions involved in military technology, citing ethical and legal concerns under the Horizon Europe framework.\nSports community\n:Athletics\nDuring the 2025 World Athletics Championships, Olympic triple jump champion Ana Peleteiro condemned the silence of the athletics world, describing the situation in Palestine as \"a tragedy and a genocide that demands all our attention and solidarity\". She urged athletes and federations to take a stand in defense of human rights.\n:Basketball players\nHistorically, some Spanish basketball players have staged protests or taken activist positions regarding the situation in Palestine. Sitapha Savané, former player and current president of CB Gran Canaria, has maintained an outspoken stance throughout his career.\nIn 2009, while playing for Gran Canaria, Savané took to the court with the word \"Gaza\" written on his shoes, in reference to the Israeli bombings at the time. The gesture led the ACB to open disciplinary proceedings against him.\nIn March 2024, former NBA player Marc Gasol expressed his support for the missions of the NGO World Central Kitchen, which sent humanitarian aid to Gaza.\nSpanish basketball circles also raised criticism of Israel’s presence in the EuroLeague, especially after the competition added a second Israeli team, Hapoel Tel Aviv, alongside Maccabi Tel Aviv, in 2025. The decision came amid widespread protests accusing Israel of \"genocide\" in Gaza, with growing voices in Spain demanding that Israeli clubs be excluded from the competition. In Vitoria-Gasteiz, protests against Maccabi Tel Aviv had already been recorded as far back as April 2002, highlighting the continuity of concerns within Spanish basketball communities.\n:Combat Sports\nIlia Topuria, the Spanish-Georgian mixed martial artist and reigning UFC Featherweight Champion, publicly rejected the war between Israel and Gaza, expressing solidarity with the Palestinian people and condemning the violence. He made these remarks during a public event in front of leaders of the far-right political party VOX, which has expressed support for Israel.\n:Cycling\nProfessional cyclist Pello Bilbao strongly criticized Israel’s military operations in Gaza, referring to them as \"genocide\". He also accused the UCI of hypocrisy for sanctioning athletes from certain countries while allowing Israel–Premier Tech to compete despite the ongoing war.\n:Soccer\nSpanish footballer Borja Iglesias expressed solidarity with the Palestinian people during protests over Israel’s participation in international sporting events. He argued that stopping a major competition to denounce a \"genocide\" should be seen as more important than the event itself, stressing the need for athletes to take a public stand against the war in Gaza.\nIn September 2025, the Basque Country announced it would play a friendly match against the Palestine on 15 November 2025 at San Mamés Stadium in Bilbao. Organized as a gesture of solidarity, the game is intended to draw international attention to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and to use sport as a platform for visibility and human rights advocacy.\nPrivate media and public opinion\n:Editorial positions of major Spanish media outlets\nSpanish mainstream media have expressed diverse editorial positions on the Gaza war and Spain’s policy response.\nThe centre-left daily El País published several editorials supporting the Spanish government’s calls for a ceasefire, condemning attacks on civilians, and advocating for the recognition of the State of Palestine. In an editorial from May 2024, El País described Spain’s recognition of Palestine as “a necessary step to unlock a credible peace process.”\nConversely, the conservative newspaper El Mundo criticized the government’s position as “unbalanced” and “damaging to Spain’s diplomatic credibility,” arguing that the move to recognize Palestine was “premature” and undermined Spain’s traditional alignment with the EU.\nLa Vanguardia, based in Barcelona, took a more centrist approach, condemning Israeli attacks on civilians while also emphasizing the need to guarantee Israel’s security. Its editorial board supported Spain’s humanitarian initiatives and called for the EU to take a leading role in mediating peace talks.\n:Media coverage of the war and protests in Spain\nSpanish media have given extensive coverage to both the war itself and the widespread protests across the country. Major newspapers and broadcasters reported daily on the rising death toll in the Gaza Strip, the humanitarian crisis, and international diplomatic responses.\nTelevision networks such as RTVE, La Sexta, and Telecinco regularly broadcast live reports from Gaza, interviews with humanitarian workers, and debates on Spain’s foreign policy. Coverage often highlighted civilian casualties, destruction of hospitals and schools, and restrictions on humanitarian aid convoys.\nLarge protests in Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Seville were widely reported, with tens of thousands of people marching under slogans such as “Ceasefire now” and “Stop the genocide.” Media coverage often emphasized the peaceful and diverse nature of these demonstrations, which included unions, student groups, feminist organizations, and migrant collectives.\n:Public opinion surveys\nPolls indicate that Spanish public opinion has been broadly supportive of the Palestinian cause and critical of Israel’s military operations.\nA CIS survey published in December 2023 found that 68% of Spaniards supported an immediate ceasefire and 74% favored increasing humanitarian aid to Gaza, while only 17% supported continuing arms sales to Israel.\nIn June 2024, a YouGov poll showed that 61% of Spaniards supported the government’s decision to recognize the State of Palestine, while 24% opposed it and 15% were undecided.\nPublic opinion in Spain has remained among the most pro-Palestinian in Western Europe, with consistent majorities expressing skepticism about Israel’s respect for international law and concern over the humanitarian situation in Gaza.\nProtests and demonstrations\n:Large-scale demonstrations in Spanish cities\nMass protests have taken place across Spain since the early stages of the Gaza war, with tens of thousands of people demonstrating in solidarity with the Palestinian population and calling for a ceasefire.\nThe largest demonstrations occurred in Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, Bilbao and Granada, with estimates of more than 50,000 participants in Madrid on 21 January 2024 and around 40,000 in Barcelona on 28 October 2023.\nWeekly demonstrations continued throughout 2024 and 2025, often coinciding with major events such as parliamentary debates, European Union summits, or visits by Israeli officials.\n:Organisers, slogans and groups involved\nProtests were organized by a broad coalition of civil society groups, including the Red Solidaria contra la Ocupación de Palestina (RESCOP), Plataforma Solidaridad con Palestina, the CCOO and UGT trade unions, student associations, feminist organizations, migrant collectives, and various left-wing parties including Sumar, Podemos and ERC.\nDemonstrators carried Palestinian flags and banners with slogans such as “Ceasefire now,” “Stop the genocide,” “Freedom for Palestine” and “No more complicity.”\n:National and international coverage and impact\nThe protests attracted extensive coverage from national media outlets including El País, El Mundo, La Vanguardia, RTVE and La Sexta, and were also reported internationally by Reuters, BBC and Al Jazeera.\nCommentators highlighted the unusually large scale of the demonstrations compared to other Western European countries, portraying Spain as one of the European nations where public opposition to Israel’s military campaign was strongest.\nSome protests coincided with official visits by Israeli or EU officials, prompting increased security measures around government buildings and foreign embassies in Madrid and Barcelona.\n:Incidents and controversies\nMost demonstrations were peaceful and without major incidents. However, isolated episodes generated controversy:\nIn Madrid (November 2023), police detained several protesters after paint was thrown at the Israeli Embassy building during a rally. No injuries were reported.\nIn Barcelona, right-wing parties and pro-Israel groups accused local authorities of tolerating “hate speech” after a municipal building displayed a Palestinian flag during a demonstration. City officials defended it as a “symbolic gesture in support of international law.”\nDespite these isolated incidents, Spanish media and police authorities consistently described the demonstrations as largely peaceful and well organized.\n:Disruptions during the 2025 Vuelta a España\nSeveral stages of the 2025 Vuelta a España were severely disrupted by pro-Palestinian protests targeting the participation of the Israel–Premier Tech cycling team. Demonstrations took place throughout the race, with varying intensity, and in several cases forced race neutralisations, suspensions or cancellations.\nOne of the most controversial incidents occurred during the 13th stage finishing at Alto de l'Angliru in Asturias, where a group of demonstrators blocked the road 12.1 kilometres from the finish line, just before the start of the final climb. The Guardia Civil quickly dispersed the protesters, but the incident caused widespread debate. Twelve activists were arrested for obstructing the race.\nEven larger disruptions took place in other regions. In the Galicia stage between A Coruña and Santiago de Compostela, the race was neutralised and ultimately suspended with 30 kilometres remaining after large groups of protesters occupied the route and threw red powder on the road to symbolise civilian bloodshed in the Gaza Strip.\nSimilarly, the Basque Country stage from San Sebastián to Bilbao was halted 18 kilometres from the finish line when hundreds of protesters blocked the road, forcing riders and team cars to stop. After over an hour of negotiations between organisers and local authorities, the stage was cancelled for safety reasons.\nThe protests culminated during the final stage in Madrid, when more than 100,000 demonstrators filled the city centre waving Palestinian flags and chanting “Ceasefire now” and “Stop the genocide.” Organisers declared that the race could not proceed “as if nothing was happening” while thousands of civilians were dying in Gaza. Race officials, citing safety concerns, suspended the final stage entirely, marking the first cancellation of a Vuelta finale in its history.\nThe Government of Spain publicly expressed support for the protesters' demands, with Minister of Culture and Sport Miquel Iceta stating that “the call for peace and respect for international law must be heard” and that “sport cannot be indifferent to genocide.” The government emphasized that while it regretted the disruption, “the right to life outweighs the right to competition.”\nSeveral international cycling teams and sponsors issued statements supporting the ceasefire calls, while others criticized the Spanish authorities for “failing to guarantee race security.” The unprecedented suspension drew global media attention and became one of the most visible anti-war demonstrations in Europe during the Gaza war.\nControversies and debates\n:Criticism of institutions and public figures\nSome Spanish officials and cultural figures who took public positions against Israel faced backlash. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez was accused by the opposition People’s Party (PP) and Vox of “damaging Spain’s credibility” and “legitimizing terrorism” after describing Israel’s response as “disproportionate.”\nArtists and actors who wore Palestinian symbols at the 2024 Goya Awards were criticized by conservative media and pro-Israel groups, who accused them of “politicizing culture” and “ignoring Hamas atrocities.”\n:Diplomatic tensions caused by Spanish actions\nSpain’s increasingly assertive stance generated diplomatic tensions with Israel. The recognition of the State of Palestine on 28 May 2024 prompted Israel to recall its ambassador in Madrid and to summon the Spanish ambassador in Tel Aviv for consultations.\nIn September 2025, after the Government of Spain announced new measures including a formal arms embargo, bans on ships and aircraft linked to the Israeli armed forces, and entry bans for individuals implicated in war crimes, Israel banned two Spanish ministers from entering its territory. Spain responded by recalling its ambassador.\n:Reactions from Israel and other countries\nThe Government of Israel repeatedly accused Spain of “aligning with Hamas” and of making “genocidal threats,” particularly after remarks by Prime Minister Sánchez calling Israel’s actions “disproportionate” and denouncing “the massacre of civilians in Gaza.” The Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned Israel’s acting ambassador in Madrid in protest, calling the accusations “false and defamatory.”\nSome EU member states, including Ireland and Belgium, supported Spain’s positions, co-signing joint statements for a ceasefire and recognition of Palestine. Others, such as Germany and Hungary, criticized Spain for “breaking EU unity” and “undermining relations with Israel.”\nSee also\n* Spain–Israel relations\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*"
