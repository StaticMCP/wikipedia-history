He was among the first to warn of desertification and desiccation and wrote on \"The encroaching Sahara\".\nIn 1935, he wrote of the \"desert whose power is incalculable and whose silent and almost invisible approach must be difficult to estimate.\" He suggested that this was man-made and this led to a joint Anglo-French forestry mission from December 1936 to February 1937 that toured northern Nigeria and Niger to assess the danger of desertification.\nLife\nHe was born in London on 4 January 1872, and was the second son of Edward Charles Stebbing (b. 1839). He was educated at St Paul's School, London. He then studied at the Royal Engineering College and Coopers Hill College (which specialised in training for the Indian Forest Service). He then studied at the University of Edinburgh and graduated with a MA.\nFrom 1900 to 1910, he worked as Forest Entomologist and Zoologist for the Indian Forest Service.\nIn 1910, he returned to the University of Edinburgh as Professor of Forestry. He lived at 13 Wolseley Place, Edinburgh with his brother.\nIn the First World War, he was a Second Lieutenant in the Royal Flying Corps.  He served on the Serbian Front in Macedonia, taking part in the Battle of Kajmakčalan and acting as transport officer to the Scottish Women's Hospitals.\nIn 1923, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir Edmund Taylor Whittaker, Ralph Allan Sampson, Arthur Crichton Mitchell and James Hartley Ashworth.\nHe retired in 1951 and died on 21 March 1960.\nFamily\nIn 1907, he married Maude Evelyn Brown (d. 1950).\nWorks\n* Injurious Insects of Indian Forests (1899) [https://archive.org/details/injuriousinsects00steb online]\n* Insect intruders in Indian homes (1909) [https://archive.org/details/insectintrudersi00stebrich online]\n* Stalks in the Himalayas (1911) ([https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/12/03/110037037.pdf New York Times review]\n* Jungle By-ways in India (1911) [https://archive.org/details/junglebywaysinin00stebrich online]\n* Indian forest insects of economic importance.
