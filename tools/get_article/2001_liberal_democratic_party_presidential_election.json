At this meeting, Mori stated that \"we will bring forward this autumn's LDP presidential election\", effectively announcing his resignation. On March 13, at the LDP convention held at the Nippon Budokan, Mori announced, \"We will hold an early presidential election\". With the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly election looming in June, the LDP's Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly members issued a protest statement expressing dissatisfaction with Mori's \"confusing resignation announcement\". However, with the convention over, the LDP began the process of electing the next president. Koizumi was elected.\nAs the election to had occurred only to fill remainder of Mori's term, Koizumi's term would expire in September 2001. Mori asked Koga to \"increase the local votes,\" and Koga replied, \"I'll do it because it's the president's order,\" increasing the prefectural vote count from one to three. Shizuka Kamei, who had been running, concluded a policy agreement with Junichiro Koizumi and withdrew from the general election, supporting Koizumi instead (though after the election, Koizumi unilaterally reneged on all policy agreements). The date for the presidential election was then set for September, when the term of office expired. However, as a special measure, the party asked party members in the Diet whether they wanted to run prior to the announcement. Only one (Junichiro Koizumi) expressed interest in running. Therefore, Junichiro Koizumi was re-elected without a vote, and at the general meeting of both houses of the National Diet, which replaced the party convention on 10 August 2001, Junichiro Koizumi was reappointed as President.\nPrefectural votes, which correspond to local votes, were expanded from one to three. Local primaries were held in 45 prefectures, excluding Hiroshima and Yamaguchi. The prefectural votes were awarded using a winner-take-all system, with the top candidate in the prefectural primary receiving three votes.\nCampaign\nCandidates\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"font-size:120%;\"\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Candidate\n|Taro Aso\n|Ryutaro Hashimoto\n|Shizuka Kamei\n|Junichiro Koizumi\n|-\n|style=\"background:#438C15\"|\n|style=\"background:#556B2F\"|\n|style=\"background:#8FBC8F\"|\n|style=\"background:#9370DB\"|\n|-\n| style=\"width:200px;\" |\n| style=\"width:200px;\" |\n| style=\"width:200px;\" |\n| style=\"width:200px;\" |\n|-\n|Experience\n|Member of the House of Representatives\n(Fukuoka 8th district)\nMinister of State for Economic and Fiscal Policy\n|Member of the House of Representatives\n（Okayama 4th district）\nPrime Minister\n|Member of the House of Representatives\n（Hiroshima 6th district）\nLiberal Democratic Party Policy Research Council\n|Member of the House of Representatives\n（Kanagawa 11th district）\nMinister of Health, Labour and Welfare\n|-\n|Faction\n|Shikōkai\n|Heisei Kenkyūkai\n|Shisuikai\n|Seiwa Seisaku Kenkyūkai\n|-\n|Home prefecture\n|Fukuoka Prefecture\n|Okayama Prefecture\n|Hiroshima Prefecture\n|Kanagawa Prefecture\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of endorsements\n!Candidate\n!Taro Aso\n!Ryutaro Hashimoto\n!Shizuka Kamei\n!Junichiro Koizumi\n|-\n! rowspan=\"20\" |Endorser\n|Hideyuki Aizawa\n|\n|Yasuhiro Nakasone\n|Masajuro Shiokawa\n|-\n|Yozo Ishikawa\n|Hiromu Nonaka\n|Takami Eto\n|Hiroshi Mitsuzuka\n|-\n|Tsuneo Suzuki\n|Fumio Kyūma\n|Shizuo Satō\n|Shozaburo Nakamura\n|-\n|Eisuke Mori\n|Hosei Norota\n|Keiji Furuya\n|Kosuke Ito\n|-\n|Katsuhito Asano\n|Tadahiro Matsushita\n|Takeo Kawamura\n|\n|-\n|Takeshi Iwaya\n|Takamori Yoshikawa\n|Toshikatsu Matsuoka\n|Kunishige Kamamoto\n|-\n|Hideo Usui\n|Makoto Taki\n|Kōki Kobayashi\n|Hiroo Nakashima\n|-\n|Norihiko Akagi\n|Masatoshi Kurata\n|\n|Taku Yamasaki\n|-\n|Akira Shichijo\n|Yūko Obuchi\n|Isao Matsumiya\n|Yoshiyuki Kamei\n|-\n|Seiko Noda\n|Juro Saito\n|Yoshitake Masuhara\n|Akira Amari\n|-\n|Mayumi Moriyama\n|Shigenobu Sakano\n|Shonosuke Hayashi\n|Kisaburō Tokai\n|-\n|Yoshiro Hayashi\n|Yutaka Okano\n|Kyoko Nishikawa\n|Kazunori Tanaka\n|-\n|Shunichi Suzuki\n| Mitsuhiro Uesugi\n| Hiroyuki Kurata\n| Toshio Yamauchi\n|-\n| Kazuna Matsumoto\n| Ryotaro Sudo\n| Yasushi Kano\n| Koichi Kato\n|-\n|Hiroyuki Arai\n|Shuntaro Kageyama\n|Sanzo Hosaka\n|Teiichi Tanigaki\n|-\n|Hiroyuki Morishita\n|Yuya Niwa\n|Tsukako Ohno\n|Gen Nakatani\n|-\n| Shunichi Yamaguchi\n| Yoshitaka Murata\n| Hirohide Uozumi\n| Koichi Kishi\n|-\n| Hachiro Okonogi\n| Kazuzo Miyamoto\n| Tomoharu Yoda\n| Jun Iwasaki\n|-\n|Yasukazu Hamada\n|Ichiro Ichikawa\n|Taro Nakayama\n|Makiko Tanaka\n|-\n|Shozo Konoike\n|Keisuke Sunada\n|Hideki Miyazaki\n|Masayoshi Hirasawa\n|}\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Total votes\n!Diet votes\n!Prefectural votes\n|-\n|Junichiro Koizumi\n| align=\"right\" |298 votes\n| align=\"right\" |175 votes\n| align=\"right\" |123 votes\n|-\n|Ryutaro Hashimoto\n| align=\"right\" |155 votes\n| align=\"right\" |140 votes\n| align=\"right\" |15 votes\n|-\n|Taro Aso\n| align=\"right\" |31 votes\n| align=\"right\" |31 votes\n| align=\"right\" |0 votes\n|-\n|Shizuka Kamei\n| colspan=\"3\" | Withdrew after prefectural vote counting\n|-\n|Blank vote\n| align=\"right\" |3 votes\n| align=\"right\" |0 votes\n| align=\"right\" |3 votes\n|}\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* }}\nExternal links\n* （ANNnewsCH）"
