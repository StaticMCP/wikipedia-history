The Qing admiral Shi Lang led a fleet to attack the Tungning forces in Penghu. Each side possessed more than 200 warships, while the Tungning admiral Liu Guoxuan's  forces were outnumbered by Shi Lang's three to one. Liu surrendered when his flagship ran out of ammunition and fled back to Taiwan. The loss of Penghu resulted in the surrender of Zheng Keshuang, the last king of Tungning, to the Qing dynasty.\nPrelude\nKangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty assigned Yao Qisheng as Viceroy of Fujian in 1678. Yao Qisheng assisted Kangxi Emperor in executing the Sea Ban order: \"Not even a plank is allowed to enter the water\" (). This persisted until 1683 as a measure to weaken their economy, cutting off all trade with the Tungning Kingdom. By 1683, Kangxi Emperor had stopped all attempts at negotiation with Tungning. Yao Qisheng had also recommended Shi Lang as the commander-in-chief of the Qing navy, and Kangxi Emperor agreed. He sent Admiral Shi Lang with a force of about 21,000 men and 240 warships to invade Tungning. Shi Lang attempted to attack Penghu before a major hurricane would strike, but was driven back by Liu Guoxuan. After the hurricane, Shi Lang regrouped his forces and was ready to strike again.\nBattle\nShi Lang divided his force into several smaller fleets. Most of them were sent to attack Liu and his Penghu defence fleet. However, a small detachment was sent to go around the battle and land directly on the island where Liu's base was located. Liu was prepared for this, and positioned archers and cannons on the beaches, followed by troops to stop the Qing advance.\nA few days before the battle, Shi Lang had bought cannons from the Dutch so his ships would be better armed. On July 12, 1683, Qing naval forces took Hujing Island and Tongpan Island in the early stages of the battle. During the battle, the Qing forces smashed into Liu's forces and broke up his formation, but the defenders still fought on bravely. The Qing ships were larger, better armed, and had more ammunition. Within an hour, most of the Tungning ships had sunk. However, the remaining ships continued to fight.\nIn the end, the ammunition of the Tungning ships diminished, but hand-to-hand combat still continued. When the flagship and commander Liu's ammunition ran out, the remaining ships surrendered, some of them burning for three days and nights. Many generals and soldiers refused to surrender, instead choosing to drown as a show of loyalty to the former Ming dynasty, thus ending the battle.\nLand battle\nAs the battle at sea raged on, Qing soldiers rushed ashore under the cover of cannon fire. The defenders used their cannons and arrows to stop the Qing forces, but there were simply too many. Led by several skilled generals, the Qing forces broke through Liu's defenses and attacked his base. The victorious Qing forces burnt it down and raised the Qing flag from the highest flagpole.\nAftermath\nAfter surrendering, Liu intended to commit suicide, but was stopped by Shi Lang. They had a brief talk about the battle, upon which Liu was released. With the destruction of Liu's fleet, Penghu surrendered, and Tungning soldiers deserted in droves. It became obvious to the Tungning royal court that they were now defenceless. A few days later, Zheng Keshuang and his court formally surrendered to the Qing dynasty, ending the Kingdom of Tungning.\nSee also\n* Taiwan under Qing rule\nNotes\nBibliography\n* Wong, Young-tsu (2017) China’s Conquest of Taiwan in the Seventeenth Century: Victory at Full Moon.
