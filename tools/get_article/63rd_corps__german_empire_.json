It was formed in January 1917 and was still in existence at the end of the war.\nChronicle\nThe 63rd Corps (z.b.V.) was formed in January 1917.\nWith the onset of trench warfare, the German Army recognised that it was no longer possible to maintain the traditional Corps unit, that is, one made up of two divisions.  Whereas at some times (and in some places) a Corps of two divisions was sufficient, at other times 5 or 6 divisions were necessary.  Therefore, under the Hindenburg regime (from summer 1916), new Corps headquarters were created without organic divisions.  These new Corps were designated\nGeneral Commands for Special Use ().\n63rd Corps was still in existence at the end of the war.\nCommanders\nThe 63rd Corps was commanded throughout its existence by Bavarian Generalleutnant (General der Infanterie from 17 January 1917) Albert von Schoch.\nSee also\n*German Army (German Empire)\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
