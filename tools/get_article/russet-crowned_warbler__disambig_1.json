While the individuals are smaller than members of other orders, the order itself is one of the largest of all vertebrates.\nThe family Parulidae are the warblers of the New World.  They are largely arboreal and very colorful, and they are unrelated to the Old World warblers (Sylviidae), and the Australian warblers (Acanthizidae).\nList of subspecies\n* Myiothlypis coronata castaneiceps\n* Myiothlypis coronata chapmani\n* Myiothlypis coronata coronatus\n* Myiothlypis coronata elatus\n* Myiothlypis coronata inaequalis\n* Myiothlypis coronata notius\n* Myiothlypis coronata orientalis\n* Myiothlypis coronata regulus\nDescription\nThe russet-crowned warbler is approximately 14&nbsp;cm in length.  Among its distinguishing markings are the rust-orange crown, for which it is named, black crown-stripes and eye-line and otherwise gray face.  Its breast is often pale yellow.  The species exhibits no obvious sexual dimorphism.\nVocalization\nIt has a musical song typically delivered in a rapid phrase of rising pitch.  The response by the mate, often delivered immediately following or shortly after, is a similar song of descending pitch.\nDistribution and habitat\nMost populations occur between 1500 and 3000 meters above sea level on either side of the Andes throughout northern South America. Typically found in the subtropical and temperate forests, they can usually be found inhabiting dense under growth.\nDiet\nThe russet-crowned warbler forages in pairs and small mixed flocks.\nReferences\n*Ridgely, Robert S. & Greenfield, Paul J.
