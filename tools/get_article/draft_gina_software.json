GINA is used by humanitarian organizations, integrated rescue systems, as well as firefighters, emergency services, and other security forces.\nIt had its first practical test in 2010 during the aftermath of the earthquake in Haiti. Since then, it has been used in responding to the tsunami in Japan, as well as conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, and many African countries. GINA is also an official supplier to the United Nations Peacekeeping Forces.\nHistory\nThe beginnings of GINA Software\nThe company's origins trace back to 2010, when Zbyněk Poulíček and Boris Procházka, then developers and students, sought a way to apply technology to assist people in crisis situations. In response to the devastating earthquake in Haiti, they developed GINA (Geographic Information Assistant) system. The early version featured a basic digital map that allowed users to share their locations in real-time, enabling communication between teams in areas with limited infrastructure. Following its deployment in the aftermath of the Haiti earthquake, the system was used in 2011 by European Union delegation workers to map the spread of cholera in the affected region.\nThe system was further developed in collaboration with non-governmental organizations and first responders. Over time, incident management and situational awareness software was created to address the needs of both first responders and operators.\nInternational deployment and collaboration\nGINA Software has collaborated with a number of international organizations and institutions and has been deployed by organizations such as the Czech Red Cross, Save The Children, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) . The company also supplies its solution to the European Space Agency (ESA) . GINA Software also collaborates with companies such as Garmin, Sygic, Milestone, Teltonika, and Taiit Communication.\nAwards\nThe company has received numerous prestigious awards throughout its existence, confirming its innovation and positive impact on society. Among the most significant of these are:\n* SDGs AWARD WINNER 2019 – award for the Overall Winner of 2019.\n* Deloitte FAST50 2018 – special recognition in the category of companies with significant social impact, the Social Impact Award.\n* Galileo 2012 – regional winner of the competition in the field of European space technologies.\n* Imagine Cup 2010 – winner of the student competition in the technology field.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ginasoftware.com Official website]"
