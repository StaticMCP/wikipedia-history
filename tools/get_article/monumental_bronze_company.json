The Union model had \"U.S.\" (United States) on the belt buckle, while the Confederate model had \"C.S.\" (Confederate States).\nFile:Patchogue AmLegion from Baker Street; 1885 Statue.JPG|Civil War Soldiers monument in White Bronze, 1885, Patchogue, New York\nFile:Soldier's Monument of Lowville, NY in the Fall..JPG|Lewis County Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, 1883, Lowville, New York\nSee also\n*J.
