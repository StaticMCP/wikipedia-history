The team plays in the United Rugby Championship league and in the European Professional Club Rugby tournaments. In the 2014–15 season they won the Pro12 title and became the first Scottish team to win a major trophy in rugby union's professional era. In 2023-24 they became the first Scottish side to win the United Rugby Championship in its current form. The side is known for its fast, dynamic and attacking style of play, using offloads and quick rucks. Defensively the club prides itself on its 'Fortress Scotstoun' where the club play at home.\nHistory\nGlasgow Warriors are a continuation of the amateur Glasgow District side founded in 1872.\nFor the history of Glasgow as an amateur district side see:\nReshaped as a professional club in 1996, Glasgow Warriors were originally known as Glasgow Rugby before rebranding as Glasgow Caledonians in 1998 by a merger with the Caledonian Reds. They dropped the Caledonians to become Glasgow Rugby in 2001 again and finally rebranded as the Glasgow Warriors in 2005.\nOrigins: District Sides\nScotland had four District Sides:- North and Midlands; South; Glasgow District and Edinburgh District. Glasgow and Edinburgh were formed in 1872 and played the world's first ever inter-district match on 23 November of that year. This was known as the 'Inter-City' derby; originally a twice a season event until 1876, then became annual thereafter.\nThe district sides capped the best amateur players from their area's club sides to play inter-district matches and matches against touring sides. The Scottish Inter-District Championship began in 1953-54 (and so encompassed the traditional Inter-City derby). Unlike the Scottish clubs (and Ireland's provincial sides), the Scottish district sides had no settled home and were not members of their Rugby Union. This meant when Scottish rugby embraced professionalism it was not clear if a model based on districts or clubs would be used.\nProfessional model: Club or District debate\nIt was not clear which route professionalism would go in Scotland. This created a turbulent start for professionalism in Scotland and left Scotland far behind fast-embracing Ireland in the set up of its professional structure. The first season of the Heineken Cup in 1995–96 was run without any Scottish teams in European competition.\nAn EGM was held by the SRU for its member clubs to debate the matter and try and settle the issue on 8 February 1996. The SRU management was in favour of districts and its Vice-president Fred McLeod, and Jim Telfer argued for the proposal. In favour of the clubs to be represented in Europe were former Scotland internationalists Gavin Hastings and Keith Robertson. Critically a speech from the floor from Brian Simmers of Glasgow Academicals – arguing that Hastings and Robertson didn't have the best interests of Scottish rugby at heart and they were arguing only for their own clubs – swung the debate and the District model won by 178 to 24.\nThe four amateur district teams Glasgow, Edinburgh, South of Scotland and North and Midlands were to become the professional sides Glasgow Warriors, Edinburgh Rugby, Border Reivers and the Caledonia Reds.\nProfessionalisation: Glasgow Warriors\nGlasgow Rugby was created in 1996 to compete in the Heineken Cup, because the Scottish Rugby Union did not think that Scottish club sides would be able to compete against the best teams from France and England. As the District sides picked the best club players from their respective areas, it was felt that they stood more chance of competing with the other nation's sides.\nFor a detailed season by season guide of Glasgow Warriors history see:\nScottish Inter-District Championship era\nGlasgow and the other three Scottish districts competed in the Scottish Inter-District Championship to determine their European Qualifying; the leagues positions determining whether they entered the Heineken Cup or the Challenge Cup for the following season.\n1996-97 : Kevin Greene in charge\nDue to Glasgow District's bottom placing in the 1995–96 Scottish Inter-District Championship, Glasgow was entered into the 1996–97 European Challenge Cup where they finished second bottom of their group.\nNew Zealander Kevin Greene was placed in charge of the professional Glasgow district, however as there was only 8 professional Glasgow planned matches:- 5 in European competition and 3 in the Scottish Inter-District Championship, this was taken on as a part time role with Greene also coaching the amateur side Glasgow Academicals. This season Glasgow played their home matches at Hughenden Stadium.\nResults improved somewhat domestically in 1996-97 with Glasgow securing second place in that season's Inter-District Championship behind Caledonia Reds.\n1997-98 : Keith Robertson in charge\nThe season started with Greene still in charge, but it was decided that the Glasgow coach role would be full time; and Greene announced he would shortly be standing down, after discussion with the SRU. This season Glasgow played their home matches at Scotstoun Stadium.\nThe 1997–98 season saw Glasgow qualified for the Heineken Cup for the first time. In their group stage that season finishing second, they qualified out of the group only to be well beaten in the Quarter Final play-off by Leicester Tigers. That was Kevin Greene's last game in charge and he returned to New Zealand, turning down advances from Ulster Rugby. He remained helpful to the Glasgow District side, organising New Zealand trips for the Glasgow Thistles side, at the time used for Glasgow's up and coming young players.\nNew Zealander Keith Robertson had been earmarked for the role since May 1997 when the Highlanders toured the UK. In the Scottish Inter-District Championship, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Caledonia Reds all finished the season equal, with the Edinburgh team pipping Glasgow to the title with only a points difference of 3 pts between the two sides.\n1998-99 : Merger with Caledonia Reds\nBecause of the SRU's high debt, partly as a result of the redevelopment of Murrayfield Stadium, there was a recognised need for further reorganisation. After two seasons, Glasgow merged with the Caledonia Reds to form a team that would be known as Glasgow Caledonians. As part of the merger, Glasgow played home matches in Glasgow, Stirling, Perth and Aberdeen.\nEdinburgh Rugby similarly merged with the Border Reivers. In effect, both the Glasgow and Edinburgh clubs took over the other districts. Glasgow's new 'Caledonian' label was later quietly dropped at the start of the 2001–02 season, with the team name becoming once again Glasgow Rugby. The Glasgow side however became colloquially known as Glasgow Warriors from at least the 2001–02 season onwards.\nOnly two professional sides remaining meant that the 1998–99 Scottish Inter-District Championship was fought out in a three match 'Tri-Series' battle between Glasgow and Edinburgh.\n1999 : Richie Dixon in charge\nThe combined sides did not fare better in Europe. Glasgow finished bottom of their group in the 1998–99 Heineken Cup. Robertson struggled with the newly merged team and the side lost the Tri-Series, and former Glasgow District captain and manager Richie Dixon was brought in to mould the team in January 1999 to finish the season.\nThe SRU realised that Glasgow and Edinburgh needed more competition domestically than each other and so began a successful dialogue with the Welsh Rugby Union that resulted in both Scottish sides being entered in the WRU Challenge Cup in early 1999.\nWelsh-Scottish League era\n1999-2000 : Scottish Inter-District Championship 'Tri-Series' success\nThe WRU Challenge Cup was deemed a success and the SRU and WRU announced a new league system for the 1999-2000 season. The Welsh-Scottish League was essentially the Welsh Premier Division augmented by the Glasgow and Edinburgh sides.\nGlasgow played another season with home matches all over Scotland. Glasgow, Stirling, Perth and Aberdeen as before but also Inverness hosted a Tri-Series Inter-District match against Edinburgh.\nThis meant the end of the traditional Scottish Inter-District Championship although it did continue as before with the amateur district sides. The 1999-2000 season's Tri-Series was run without a sponsor. Glasgow won the title, but at a cost; they had beaten Edinburgh four times that season (including twice in the Tri-Series) and Edinburgh's only win was the 5th match, a dead rubber at the end of the Tri-Series. The fans didn't like the format and it was scrapped.\n2000-01 : Coastal Cup success\nIn the pre-season, Dixon took Glasgow off to Canada. There they won 3 matches against Canadian sides to win the Coastal Cup. The side also made progress in the Welsh-Scottish League with a solid 7th place, in front of Edinburgh.\nGlasgow made the decision to play their competitive home matches actually in Glasgow, and so played at Hughenden Stadium.\nThe Welsh-Scottish League lasted three seasons. Although both Glasgow and Edinburgh finished no higher than mid-table for those three seasons, it did provide the Scottish sides with much needed competition. It was looked on as a successful model of co-operation between two rugby unions. The Irish Rugby Football Union began talks with the SRU and WRU about further extending the co-operation in a new Celtic League.\nCeltic League era\n2001-02 : Celtic League semi-finalists and the end of the Welsh-Scottish League\nThe Celtic League began in truncated fashion in the autumn of 2001 with the addition of the four Irish provincial teams in two pools; Glasgow reached the semi-finals of the inaugural competition, but struggled thereafter.\nIn its first year the Celtic League ran concurrently with the 2001–02 Welsh-Scottish League but fixture congestion meant that the Welsh-Scottish tournament was scrapped in favour of the new league.\n2002-03 : Kiwi Searancke in charge\nDixon became Head of Coach Development for the SRU and once again the SRU looked to New Zealand for a successor. Kiwi Searancke was an outspoken fiery coach, who often criticised the players, and often hit the headlines. He guided the team to the Celtic League quarter-finals but the team struggled in the Scottish Inter-District Championship.\nThe new Celtic League was an instant success and the SRU took the opportunity to resurrect one of its disbanded districts in 2002. The Border Reivers were thus reborn for 2002–03 season.\nThe Celtic League remained in its truncated 'pools' form for 2002–03 season before its expansion to a full league set-up the following season. This gave the SRU a one-off chance to revive the 2002–03 Scottish Inter-District Championship as a professional tournament. Glasgow, Edinburgh and the Borders fought in out in what was the final professional Inter-District championship; the Bank of Scotland Pro Cup. Glasgow finished bottom of the table.\n2003 : Hugh Campbell in charge\nMidway through the Scottish Inter-District Championship, on 1 April 2003, the SRU decided Searancke had to go. For a couple of weeks that month, Richie Dixon stepped in, while the SRU looked for a replacement. That replacement was former Glasgow District prop Hugh Campbell. As part of the coaching team Sean Lineen joined as assistant and Shade Munro joined as a development coach.\n2003-04 : Glasgow City Sevens success\nIn a poor league season for the Warriors, the club finished second-bottom of the table. It had more success in the short-lived Celtic Cup, reaching the semi-final in its inaugural season. In the European Challenge Cup they were agonisingly dropped out at the second round by Saracens by an aggregate score over the home and away ties going the English club's way by a mere 3 points.\nTowards the end of the season Glasgow Warriors entered its academy side into the Glasgow City Sevens, run by Cartha Queens Park rugby club. The young Glasgow side won the event. This was also the first season that the club announced their end of season awards; with Glenn Metcalfe winning their player of the season, and James Eddie winning Young Player of the season.\n2004-05\nIn 2004–05 Glasgow had finished sixth in the Celtic League, the best placing of the three Scottish teams that existed at that time. In the league Calvin Howarth and Dan Parks fought it out for the stand off slot, academy prospect Colin Gregor getting a few substitute appearances. Sean Lamont won Player of the Season, scoring 9 tries in competitive matches. The ill-fated Celtic Cup ended this season, Glasgow Warriors beat by Leinster in the Quarter-Finals.\n2005-06 : Warriors tag becomes official\nAs noted before, from at least the 2001-02 season, the team was known by the fans as the Glasgow Warriors. The fansite glasgowwarriors.com started in 2003, years before the club officially changed its name. The SRU made this name change official for the start of the new 2005–06 season.\nAlthough the club started the season at Hughenden Stadium around December they made the switch to Firhill Stadium. Firhill Stadium was last used by the Warriors in the 1998-99 season when the side toured Scotland playing their home games.\nA drop to 11th place in the league that season sealed Head Coach Hugh Campbell's fate and he left the Warriors before the end of the season in March 2006.\n2006-07 : Sean Lineen in charge\nIn his place, the Warriors promoted his assistant Sean Lineen. Under his reign the Warriors became a mid table side. For this season, the club switched back to using Hughenden Stadium for their home matches.\n2007-08 : 1872 Cup begins with Glasgow success\nThis season the club again switched base to play back at Firhill Stadium.\nDisappointing results for the Border Reivers saw them disband again in 2007. With only two professional sides once again, the SRU took the opportunity to dust down and rename the 1995 Scottish Inter-District Championship trophy and use the two Celtic League fixtures between Glasgow Warriors and Edinburgh Rugby as a mini-cup tournament. The Glasgow-Edinburgh 'inter-city' derby dates back to 1872 and is the oldest provincial match in the world. To mark this, the 1872 Cup thus began in 2007-08.\nGlasgow Warriors were the inaugural winners of the 1872 Cup, winning the cup by six points over the two legs of the tie.\n2008-09 : Challenge Armand Vaquerin success\nA pre-season jaunt to France to play Castres Olympique and Beziers saw the Warriors win both matches to win the Challenge Armand Vaquerin, one of the very few non-French teams to win the tournament.\n2009-10 : Celtic League semi-final\nIn Lineen's second to last season in 2009-10 the team managed 3rd and secured a semi-final against Ospreys - the club's first Celtic League semi final since 2001-02. Ospreys made the home tie count and ran out 20-15 winners; and went on to win the league that year.\n2010-11 : Glasgow City Sevens success\nThe Warriors were looking to push on from that semi-final appearance and become regular play-off contenders for the title. But once again the team slumped to an 11th place finish in 2010-11. This was the last season of the Celtic League as two Italian sides had joined the league and it was rebranded the next season.\nThe Warriors did manage to win the Glasgow City Sevens again this season. Joining the usual Scottish sides, the Warriors also competed with Ospreys and Wasps. The Warriors side beat East Renfrewshire sides Whitecraigs and Glasgow Hutchesons Aloysians in the early rounds then Ospreys in the semi-final by 26-17, and then trounced Wasps in the final by 48-0 with Pete Horne grabbing a hat-trick.\nPro12 era\n2011-12 : Pro12 play-offs\nThe Celtic League was rebranded as the Pro12 league in season 2011–12. This was to better reflect the entry of the Italian sides into the Celtic League.\nThe Pro12 league format had a top four play-off system to decide the champions. The season 2011-12 proved Sean Lineen's last season as Head Coach. Once again, the Warriors finished fourth. That meant an away semi-final in Dublin against Leinster. The Irish side won in a narrow 19 - 15 victory. Lineen moved on to take on the Scotland Under 20 coaching position.\n2012-13 : Gregor Townsend in charge\nGlasgow switched their home base again, back to another old haunt, Scotstoun Stadium.\nNew coach Gregor Townsend inherited the squad. He solidified Glasgow Warriors position as title challengers in the league. In 2012-13 the team finished 3rd in the league. They were beaten again in Dublin by Leinster in an even narrower score 17 - 15.\n2013-14: First Pro12 final and Melrose Sevens success\nThe following season it was no surprise that Leinster and Glasgow were the top two teams in the league. Glasgow's trip to Dublin in 2013-14 ended the same way with an Irish win. Townsend later reflected that he got his team talk wrong in the final, although the then speculation over Stuart Hogg's future couldn't have helped the team either. However the Warriors side, with 7s specialist Carlin Isles starring, did win the Melrose Sevens that year.\n2014-15 : Championship and Melrose Sevens success\nTownsend resolved to go one better the following season. The Warriors finished top of the league and again made the final. Last season that would have ensured a vital home final tie. However this 2014-15 season was the first 'destination' final. So they had to go to Ireland again and face an Irish team. This was Munster and played at Ulster's Kingspan stadium. The Irish were again confident but Glasgow simply blitzed Munster in the final winning 31 - 13 for the Warriors first league title since the 1999-2000 Scottish Inter-District Championship 'Tri-Series'. Glasgow also successfully defended their Melrose Sevens title, beating the German international 7s side in the final.\n2015-16 : World Cup decimates squad\nThe following season 2015-16 was a world cup year. With so many Warriors players away with Scotland - and the perennial problem of Scotland only having 2 pro sides - Townsend looked to Europe to make an impact. However Saracens ended their Champions Cup hopes at the quarter final stage. The unfancied Connacht stepped up this year in the Pro12. The Connacht side generally lost the fewest players to the Irish national side and this helped them make a run for the title. They beat Glasgow in Galway in the semi-final, with Finn Russell injured with a serious cheekbone fracture at the start of the match. Connacht then secured the title in a destination final at Murrayfield stadium.\n2016-17 : End of an era\nTownsend's last season was 2016-17. It was announced early that Townsend would be taking over the Scotland international job from Vern Cotter. He had made Glasgow Warriors a fixture in the Pro12 playoffs and made the side champions in 2015. The early announcement this season resulted in a bit of instability and that season Townsend finished in the Warriors lowest position of 6th in his tenure. 2016-17 season was also the last season of the Pro12. 2 South African sides joined the following year and the league was rebranded as the Pro14.\nSince the Pro12 started in season 2011–12, Glasgow Warriors were the only team that have made the play-offs in every year, but this record was finally broken at the end of the 2016–17 season on 28 April 2017 when the Warriors lost to Leinster in Dublin ensuring that a top 4 finish for the Glasgow side was unattainable.\nGlasgow Warriors hold the Pro12 record of the highest number of consecutive seasons that a team has made the play-offs – with 5 seasons between 2011–12 and 2015–16. Going further back and taking the Celtic League into account, this record is also shared with Leinster who made the play-offs in the last 2 years of the Celtic League and first 3 years of the Pro12.\nPro14 era\n2017-18 : Dave Rennie in charge\nWith the addition of two South African sides, the Pro12 expanded to become the Pro14 for season 2017-18.\nThe format of the league changed to accommodate the extra teams. It was split into two conferences and matches played in a conference system with the addition of 2 derby fixtures. The play-off system also changed with the winners of the conferences hosting a Semi-Final and each conference runners up and 3rd place teams playing off in Quarter-Final fixtures.\nFor the Pro14's inaugural season, Glasgow Warriors were placed in a conference with the Ospreys, Blues, Munster, Connacht, Zebre and Cheetahs. After a blistering start with 10 straight wins, the Warriors were the first team to secure a play-off place. The Warriors won top place in Conference A and secured a home semi-final. Inconsistent form in the latter half of the season then cost the Warriors; losing in the semi-final to Scarlets.\n2018-19: Pro14 Final in Glasgow\nGlasgow Warriors' conference did not change for season 2018-19 but home and away fixtures were swapped from the previous year.\nOther than a blip against the Southern Kings and a notable dip in the Festive period against Edinburgh and Benetton Treviso, by and large Glasgow Warriors seemed to ease through their fixtures. By the end of the regular season Glasgow were top of Conference A again and setting new records:- the final regular season match against Edinburgh Rugby saw the Warriors hit a club record of 7 consecutive try bonus point league wins; their total of 15 try bonus points throughout the season was a new Pro14 record; their 81 points scored was the most ever scored in a league campaign by Glasgow Warriors; and their 83 tries was the most scored in a league campaign by Glasgow Warriors; and their 621 points scored was the most scored in a league campaign by Glasgow Warriors. They narrowly lost to Leinster in the final at Celtic Park following an error by Stuart Hogg in the Warriors try-line. The Celtic Park final attendance, swelled by Glasgow Warriors fans normally unable to watch at a sold-out Scotstoun, remains the highest in the Celtic League/Pro12/Pro14 history.\n2019-20 : COVID interrupts\nIn 2019–20, the Warriors started poorly but results picked up as the season progressed. By the end of February 2020, Glasgow Warriors had solidified the play-off 3rd spot and were hopeful of a decent run to overtake Ulster into the 2nd place in their conference. However, the COVID-19 pandemic intervened and Pro14 matches were stopped. The season restarted at the end of August; but it was instead curtailed, now with only two matches to play, meaning it was virtually impossible to catch Ulster in the second spot. Worse for the Warriors was the Pro14 decision to not play any Quarter-Final matches which meant that they would not be involved in the play-offs. Missing out, the final was played between Leinster and Ulster, with Leinster winning.\n2020-21 : Danny Wilson in charge\nSeason 2020-21 was still affected with the COVID-19 pandemic; this meant very limited or usually no fans at the matches. The Southern Kings went bankrupt and the Cheetahs were unable to compete due to the pandemic, so the Pro14 ran with 12 European sides, still in two conferences. They did however court some of the South African Super Rugby Unlocked franchises for the following season and organised an end of season tournament – the Rainbow Cup – which because of COVID-19 was run as a mini European league of the Pro14 sides; and a South African league of their 4 biggest franchises that the Pro14 wished to invite – the winners of the two leagues would play off in a final. Glasgow Warriors stuttered in the Pro14 and only improved towards the end of the tournament. They managed to still secure a Champions Cup spot despite their early form. The end of season Rainbow Cup saw Glasgow lose their match against the surprise eventual Rainbow Cup tournament winners Benetton Treviso but then win the rest of their matches, securing the 1872 Cup along the way and beating this season's Pro14 winners Leinster in their last match.\nUnited Rugby Championship era\n2021-22 : Season slump\nThe European sides were again joined by the South African franchises in season 2021–22. The championship was split in four conferences:- a Scottish-Italian conference, a South African conference, a Welsh conference and an Irish conference. The Warriors stuttered through the URC campaign. They seemed to have a bad knack of winning fixtures until the last quarter and then blowing their lead. Still, home results remained a bit better than the away fixtures. By the end of April they were just about managing to cling onto top 4 in the URC. Then the form stopped stuttering, but unfortunately things got worse. They bowed out of the Champions Cup at the hands of La Rochelle (the eventual winners of the European Cup that season), to find themselves in the Challenge Cup. A win against Newcastle Falcons papered over cracks but they were beaten in the quarter-final against Lyon, again losing the match from a winning position. (Lyon went on to win the Challenge Cup.)\nBeaten by both European winners may have been understandable but the Glasgow side's league form was much worse and a run of away fixtures hardly helped. Beaten by the Stormers and Bulls, the Warriors lost the 1872 Cup deciding match to Edinburgh. Not only did Edinburgh secure the 1872 Cup, but it meant that Edinburgh leapfrogged Glasgow Warriors in the league and also won the Scottish-Italian conference. Glasgow Warriors finished 8th; their lowest league position since 2010–11. It was the first time that Edinburgh finished higher than Glasgow since that 2010–11 season. Finishing 8th meant that Glasgow failed to qualify for the Champions Cup next season. The last time that happened was the 2005–06 season, causing Hugh Campbell to lose his job; and they played the 2006–07 season in the Challenge Cup under Sean Lineen. Eighth place in 2021-22 did qualify the Warriors for the last quarter-final place of the URC, but they were given the 1st seeds Leinster in Dublin to play. The Warriors failed to regroup for the quarter-final and although they again started brightly the team predictably slumped. It was quite a slump too, a 76–14 defeat: it was the Warriors worst result domestically; and their second-worse result of all time. Only the Leicester Tigers European quarter-final play-off match of 1997–98 season, a 90–19 defeat, was worse. The SRU was quick to act in the face of these poor results and Danny Wilson was stood down as Head Coach.\n2022-23 : Franco Smith in charge, European Challenge Cup final\nJust before the 2022–23 season began, Glasgow hired Franco Smith. It took a few games for the team to settle into the new coach, but they did and results followed. Glasgow went unbeaten at home in the regular URC season, and in European Challenge Cup Glasgow tore through opposition till the final. Winning the 1872 Cup and the Scottish-Italian Shield, they made 4th in the URC, playing Munster at home in the Quarter-Final. A red card to Tom Jordan made it difficult for the Warriors and they lost the match 14–5 to the Irish side. In the European Challenge Cup final, a devastating first half by Toulon scoring 21 points without reply left the Warriors too much to do in the second half and the French side won out 43–19. Nevertheless, it was a very successful first season under Smith, with the side back challenging on all fronts after the slump of the Danny Wilson era. He was named URC coach of the year.\n2023-24 : Championship success\nScotstoun remained a fortress in the URC and they remained unbeaten at home in the 2023–24 season. Indeed, only the Stormers, the Sharks, Edinburgh and Cardiff managed to prevent Glasgow taking the bonus point win there. Away from home, the Warriors were beaten five times. Once by Connacht, once by Munster, in the 1872 Cup match against Edinburgh - though not enough to stop the 1872 Cup heading to Glasgow again, and crucially at the end of the season an away loss to the Bulls and the Lions. The Warriors lost their 1st place in the league by the two South African losses, and finished the season 4th in the table, but only 3 points behind 1st place.\nThe play-offs meant that Glasgow faced the Stomers at home. In blustery conditions the Warriors comfortably won the match, helped by the Stomers poor kicking in the wind. The quarter final was against Munster away at Thomond Park. Munster displaying advertising promoting the final between them and the Bulls before the match gave Glasgow extra impetus and they outplayed the Irish side. That meant a final in South Africa at Loftus Versfeld. The Bulls won the match before, but like that match Glasgow knew they could win the second half, if they could keep the first half tight. A score at the end of the first half by Scott Cummings made the half time score 13–7 to the Bulls; and the Warriors stepped on the gas in the second half with tries by George Turner and Huw Jones. Glasgow saw out the match 21 - 16, with the Bulls only scoring 3pts in the second half, to become URC champions.\nWomen's team\nIn December 2023, Glasgow launched a women's team to compete in the Celtic Challenge, a cross-border competition that is designed to develop players for the Celtic nations, starting in the 2023–24 season.\nStadium\nFor the most part, Glasgow Warriors through the years have played their matches in Glasgow either at Hughenden Stadium, Firhill Stadium or Scotstoun Stadium, their current base.\nA closer look at the club's history reveals a more nomadic nature. Some of this was planned as the club took over the Caledonia Reds district; or a liberal spreading of the Warriors brand to various grounds for friendlies and smaller ties; and some of this was caused by inclement weather; in particular the Warriors had to play several games at the football ground of Kilmarnock F.C. in 2015/16. The laying of a synthetic pitch at Scotstoun Stadium for the 2016-17 season resolved those weather-related issues, though there have on occasion been complaints from visiting teams about the synthetic surface.\nTo accommodate their fans and further promote rugby in Glasgow, the Warriors made the decision to play their home 1872 Cup match at Hampden Park in Glasgow in December 2024. That decision was vindicated by almost 28,000 fans turning out at the football stadium, almost four times their Scotstoun capacity.\nStadia moves\nOriginally based at Hughenden Stadium in 1996-97, Glasgow moved to Scotstoun Stadium for the 1997-98 season. Rugby at Scotstoun, however, goes back even further, right to the beginning of the 1900s when the likes of Glasgow HSFP and Kelvinside Accies along with others played there on their journeys to Old Anniesland and Balgray respectively.\nThe merger with the Caledonia Reds for the season caused the Warriors to play their matches not only at Hughenden and Firhill Stadium in Glasgow, but also at Perth's McDiarmid Park and Aberdeen's Rubislaw Playing Fields as it consolidated the traditional North and Midlands district.\nThe following year saw the Warriors additionally play at Bridgehaugh Park in Stirling. the Caledonian Stadium in Inverness and Millbrae in Ayr.\nFrom the 2000-01 season Glasgow settled in Hughenden through to the middle of 2005-06 season, after which Firhill was used briefly. However the following year Hughenden was used again.\nThe Warriors moved to Firhill Stadium in 2007–08 season and that was the club's base until the summer of 2012.\nIn 2012, Glasgow Warriors moved from Firhill back to Scotstoun Stadium, which had previously been the club's training base.\nIn addition to those grounds above:- Rugby Park in Kilmarnock; Old Anniesland in Glasgow; Braidholm in Giffnock; Whitecraigs in Newton Mearns; London Road in Stranraer; Burnbrae in Milngavie, North Inch in Perth and Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh have all hosted home matches for the Glasgow side.\nFrom 2024 Glasgow has taken its home 1872 Cup match against Edinburgh Rugby to the much higher capacity Hampden Stadium to cater for the fan numbers wanting to see the clash.\nFans\nGlasgow Warriors fans are collectively known as the Warrior Nation. The official supporters club is The XVIth Warrior, founded in 2012.\nHome\nAlthough the current Scotstoun Stadium capacity has occasionally been increased to 10,000 for selected matches, from the 2016–17 season the standard capacity at home is now 7351, which regularly sells out. There is now a record number of season ticket holders at the club.\nSuch is the demand for tickets at Glasgow, it had been reported that Mark Dodson, former chief executive of the Scottish Rugby Union, was in talks with Glasgow City Council about building a bigger stand on the railway side of Scotstoun Stadium.\nA quirk of such high demand is seen when you compare the 2015-16 standard capacity at Scotstoun (6800) with Glasgow's seasonal average attendance (6950) The seasonal higher than capacity average was made possible when Scotstoun Stadium became unplayable that winter and home games were switched to the higher capacity grounds of Rugby Park and Murrayfield Stadium.\nAway\nThe away support of the Glasgow Warriors ranges from about 300 fans for a Pro12 match in Italy to around several thousand fans for the 1872 Cup away match against Edinburgh Rugby at Murrayfield Stadium.\nThe Pro12 Grand Finals of 2013–14 season and 2014–15 season, in Dublin and Belfast respectively, saw around 4 to 5 thousand of the Warrior Nation follow their team to Ireland each time.\nThe 2016-17 European Champions Cup Quarter Final away to Saracens saw 6000 of the Warrior Nation make their way to Allianz Park and provided the London side with their highest ever home attendance.\nFanzones\nVarious public houses around Glasgow have operated as Fanzones for the club. The official Fanzone for the 2016–17 season was The Crafty Pig. For 2018–19 season The Old Schoolhouse is the XVIth Warriors fanzone. For the 2024–25 season, it remains The Old Schoolhouse and additionally The Beechwood Bar in Kings Park.\nRecords and achievements\nFor Amateur era see:\nHonours\n* United Rugby Championship\n**
