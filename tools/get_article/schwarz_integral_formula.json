Then\n:f(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\oint_{|\\zeta| = 1} \\frac{\\zeta + z}{\\zeta - z} \\operatorname{Re}(f(\\zeta)) \\, \\frac{d\\zeta}{\\zeta}+ i\\operatorname{Im}(f(0))\nfor all |z|&nbsp;&nbsp;0, |zα&nbsp;f(z)| is bounded on the closed upper half-plane. Then\n:f(z) = \\frac{1}{\\pi i} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{u(\\zeta,0)}{\\zeta - z} \\, d\\zeta = \\frac{1}{\\pi i} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{\\operatorname{Re}(f)(\\zeta)}{\\zeta - z} \\, d\\zeta\nfor all Im(z)&nbsp;>&nbsp;0.\nNote that, as compared to the version on the unit disc, this formula does not have an arbitrary constant added to the integral; this is because the additional decay condition makes the conditions for this formula more stringent.\nCorollary of Poisson integral formula\nThe formula follows from Poisson integral formula applied to&nbsp;u:\n:u(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_0^{2\\pi} u(e^{i\\psi}) \\operatorname{Re} {e^{i\\psi} + z \\over e^{i\\psi} - z} \\, d\\psi \\qquad \\text{for } |z|\nBy means of conformal maps, the formula can be generalized to any simply connected open set.\nNotes and references\n* Ahlfors, Lars V.
