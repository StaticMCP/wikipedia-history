Member Kristyn Osborn wrote the single with John Shanks, who also produced it. It was released as the lead single by Lyric Street Records on November 14, 2005.\nThe single peaked at number 21 on the US Hot Country Songs chart.\nMusic video\nThe music video starts with the trio performing in front of an audience and shows Kristyn Osborn and her boyfriend (her then real-life boyfriend Aaron Eckhart) arguing in the car while driving on a road in the city trying to find their way. Throughout the video the trio continue to perform on stage while Kristyn and her boyfriend continue to argue. When the two stop for gas, Kristyn takes the wheel while her boyfriend is pumping gas. Her boyfriend slides into the passenger seat and Kristyn drives quickly through the city, making her boyfriend nervous. Toward the end of the video, Kristyn pulls the car over by sliding it into place, at this time the car overheats and her boyfriend is angry. Kristyn decides the best way to say she is sorry is by giving him a long kiss, which eventually ends up with him kissing her on the hood of the car. The trio finishes up their performance and the video fades out. The video was directed by Trey Fanjoy.\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (2005–2006)\n!align=\"center\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Chart (2006)\n!Position\n|-\n|US Country (Radio & Records'')\n|align=\"center\"|85\n|}\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Release dates and format(s) for \"I'm Taking the Wheel\"\n!Region\n!Date\n!Format(s)\n!Label(s)\n!\n|-\n|United States\n|November 14, 2005\n|Country radio\n|Lyric Street\n|\n|}\nReferences"
