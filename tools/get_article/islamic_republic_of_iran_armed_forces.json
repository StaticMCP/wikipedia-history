Iran's military forces are made up of approximately 610,000 active-duty personnel plus 350,000 reserve and trained personnel that can be mobilized when needed, bringing the country's military manpower to about 960,000 total personnel. These numbers do not include Law Enforcement Command or Basij.\nMost of Iran's weapons consists of equipment from its robust domestic rearmament program, which the country launched and its inventory has become increasingly indigenous. Most of the country's military hardware is domestically manufactured, and Iran had become an exporter of arms by the 2000s. Unable to import weapon systems from abroad due to international and U.S. sanctions, and suffering from an increasingly aging air force fleet, Iran has invested considerable funds into an ambitious ballistic and cruise missile program for mid-range strike capability, and has manufactured different types of arms and munitions, including tanks, armoured vehicles and drones, as well as various naval assets and aerial defense systems.\nIran's ballistic missile and space program is an internationally hot political topic over which it has consistently refused to negotiate. Iranian authorities state that the country's missile program is not designed to deliver nuclear payloads, but is used only for surgical strikes.  It is therefore not relevant to any nuclear negotiations with the P5+1.\nThe Iranian drone program has also raised concerns in the Western world, especially with proliferation among Iranian-allied forces in the Middle East, as well as exports to countries hostile to the U.S. According to U.S. Central Command chief Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, the U.S. is \"for the first time since the Korean War operating without complete air superiority\" due to threats posed by Iranian drones.\nAll branches of the armed forces fall under the command of the General Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces. The Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics is responsible for planning logistics and funding of the armed forces and is not involved with in-the-field military operational command. The commander-in-chief of the armed forces is the Supreme Leader.\nHistory\nAfter the coup in 1953, Iran began purchasing some weapons from Israel, the United States and other countries of the Western Bloc. Later on, Iran began establishing its own armaments industry; its efforts in this remained largely unrecognized internationally, until recently.\nFollowing the Iranian revolution in 1979, deteriorating relations with the U.S. resulted in international sanctions led by the US, including an arms embargo being imposed on Iran.\nRevolutionary Iran was taken by surprise by the Iraqi invasion that began the Iran–Iraq War of 1980–1988. During this conflict, there were several conflicts against the United States. From 1987, the United States Central Command sought to stop Iranian mine-laying vessels from blocking the international sea lanes through the Persian Gulf in Operation Prime Chance. The operation lasted until 1989. On April 18, 1988, the US retaliated for the Iranian mining of the  in Operation Praying Mantis. Simultaneously, the Iranian armed forces had to learn to maintain and keep operational, their large stocks of US-built equipment and weaponry, without outside help, due to the American-led sanctions. However, Iran was able to obtain limited amounts of American-made armaments, when it was able to buy American spare parts and weaponry for its armed forces, during the Iran–Contra affair. At first, deliveries came via Israel and later, from the US.\nThe Iranian government established a five-year rearmament program in 1989 to replace worn-out weaponry from the Iran–Iraq War. Between 1989 and 1992, Iran spent $10 billion on arms, some of which were designed to prevent other states' naval vessels from accessing the sea, including marines and long-range Soviet planes capable of attacking aircraft carriers.\nA former military-associated police force, the Iranian Gendarmerie, was merged with the National Police (Shahrbani) and Islamic Revolution Committees in 1990.\n, 1980s]]\nIn 1991, the Iranian armed forces received a number of Iraqi military aircraft being evacuated from the Persian Gulf War of that year; most of which were incorporated into the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force.\nSince 2003 there have been repeated US and British allegations that Iranian forces have been covertly involved in the Iraq War. In 2004, Iranian armed forces took Royal Navy personnel, on the Shatt al-Arab (Arvand Rud in Persian) river, between Iran and Iraq. They were released three days later following diplomatic discussions between the UK and Iran.\nIn 2007, Iranian Revolutionary Guard forces also took prisoner Royal Navy personnel prisoner when a boarding party from  was seized in the waters between Iran and Iraq, in the Persian Gulf. They were released thirteen days later.\nSince 1979, there have been no foreign military bases present in Iran. According to Article 146 of the Iranian Constitution, the establishment of any foreign military base in the country is forbidden, even for peaceful purposes.\nOn 4 December 2011, an American RQ-170 Sentinel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was captured by Iranian forces near the city of Kashmar in northeastern Iran.\nIn 2012, it was announced that Iran's Quds Force is operating inside Syria providing the government of Bashar al-Assad with intelligence and direction against rebel opposition.\nIn December 2012, Iran stated it had captured an American ScanEagle UAV that violated its airspace over the Persian Gulf. Iran later stated it had also captured two other ScanEagles.\nIn November 2015, Iranian special forces assisted in the rescue of a Russian pilot that was shot down by Turkey, over Syria.\nIn April 2016, Iran sent advisors from the 65th Airborne Special Forces Brigade to Syria in support of the government.\nIn 2016, Revolutionary Guard forces captured US Navy personnel when their boats entered Iranian territorial waters off the coast of Farsi Island in the Persian Gulf. They were released the next day following diplomatic discussions between the US and Iran.\nIn March 2021 state TV in Iran showed footage of a \"missile city\" armed with ballistic and cruise weapons described as \"a new Revolutionary Guard base\" along the Gulf coast.\nIn March 2023, Iran began the process of allowing women to enlist in the military for the first time since the White Revolution.\nCommanders\n* Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution and the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic, in )\n* Minister of Defence Brigadier General Aziz Nasirzadeh\n* Minister of Interior Brigadier General Eskandar Momeni\n* Commander of the General Staff of the Armed Forces Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi\n* Deputy commander of General Staff of the Armed Forces Brigadier General Mohammad-Reza Gharaei Ashtiani\n* Senior Military Advisor to the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Major General Yahya Rahim Safavi\n* Islamic Republic of Iran Army\n** Commander-in-Chief of the Army Major General Amir Hatami\n** Deputy Commander in Chief of the Army Brigadier General Mohammad-Hossein Dadras\n** Chief of the Army Joint Headquarters Rear admiral Habibollah Sayyari\n** Commander of the Army Ground Forces Brigadier General Kioumars Heydari\n** Commander of the Air Force Brigadier General Hamid Vahedi\n** Commander of Air Defense Force Brigadier General Alireza Sabahifard\n** Commander of the Navy Rear admiral Shahram Irani\n* IRGC\n** Commander-in-Chief of the IRGC Mohammad Pakpour\n** Deputy Commander of the IRGC Rear admiral Ali Fadavi\n** Chief of the IRGC Joint Headquarters Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Naqdi\n** Commander of IRGC Ground Force Brigadier General Mohammad Karami\n** Commander of the IRGC Aerospace Force Brigadier General Majid Mousavi\n** Commander of IRGC Navy Rear admiral Alireza Tangsiri\n** Commander of Quds Force Brigadier General Esmail Qaani\n** Commander of the Basij Resistance Force Brigadier General Gholamreza Soleimani\n* Law Enforcement Force\n** Commander-in-Chief of the General Command of the Law Enforcement Brigadier General Ahmad-Reza Radan\nStructure\n* Military Office of the Supreme Leader\n**   General Staff of the Armed Forces\n***  Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (Sepah)\n**** Ground Force\n**** Basij\n**** Quds Force\n**** Aerospace Force\n****  Navy\n***  Islamic Republic of Iran Army (Artesh)\n**** Ground Force\n**** Air Defense\n**** Air Force\n****  Navy\n***   General Command of the Law Enforcement (Police)\n* The Iranian regular military, or Islamic Republic of Iran Army, consists of the Islamic Republic of Iran Army Ground Forces, the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy, the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force, and the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Defense Force. The regular armed forces have an estimated 420,000 personnel: the Islamic Republic of Iran Army Ground Forces with 350,000, of which 220,000 are conscripts; the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy with 18,000, and the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force with 37,000 airmen. The Islamic Republic of Iran Air Defense Force is a branch split off from the IRIAF, and has 15,000 personnel.\n* The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or Revolutionary Guards, has an estimated 190,000 personnel in five branches: Its own Navy, Aerospace Force, and Ground Forces; and the Quds Force (special forces).\n** The Basij is a paramilitary volunteer force controlled by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards. Its membership is a matter of controversy. Iranian sources claim a membership of 12.6 million, including women, of which perhaps 600,000 are combat capable. There are a claimed 2,500 battalions of which some are composed of full-time personnel.\nCyberwarfare\nIt has been reported that Iran is one of the five countries that has a cyber-army capable of conducting cyber-warfare operations. It has also been reported that Iran has immensely increased its cyberwarfare capability since the post presidential election un-rest. In 2010, China accused the United States of having initiated a cyber war against Iran through websites such as Twitter and YouTube in addition to employing a hacker brigade for the purpose of fomenting unrest in Iran.\nIn early 2010, two new garrisons for cyberwarfare were established at Zanjan and Isfahan. As of 2024, Iran's cyber activities have become more sophisticated, engaging in a persistent cyber struggle with Israel that focuses on espionage, information warfare, and attempts to target critical infrastructure, although Israel maintains a technological edge.\nBudget\nIran's 2021 defense budget was estimated to be $25.0 billion by IISS.\n}}\nDefense industry\nof Iranian F-14 Tomcats, in 2008]]\ns patrolling the Persian Gulf.]]\nis a solid-fuel, guided ballistic missile]]\ndrone is widely considered to be one of the most capable Iranian drones in service]]Under the last Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Iran's military industry was limited to assembly of foreign weapons. In the assembly lines that were put up by American firms, such as Bell, Litton and Northrop, Iranian workers put together a variety of helicopters, aircraft, guided missiles, electronic components and tanks.\nIn 1973, the Iran Electronics Industries (IEI) was established. The company was set up in a first attempt to organize the assembly and repair of foreign-delivered weapons. The Iranian Defense Industries Organization was the first to succeed in taking a step into what could be called a military industry by reverse engineering Soviet RPG-7, BM-21, and SAM-7 missiles in 1979.\nNevertheless, most of Iran's weapons before the Islamic revolution were imported from the United States and Europe. Between 1971 and 1975, the Shah went on a buying spree, ordering $8 billion in weapons from the United States alone. This alarmed the United States Congress, which strengthened a 1968 law on arms exports in 1976 and renamed it the Arms Export Control Act. Still, the United States continued to sell large amounts of weapons to Iran until the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\nAfter the Islamic revolution, Iran found itself severely isolated and lacking technological expertise. Because of economic sanctions and a weapons embargo put on Iran by the United States, it was forced to rely on its domestic arms industry for weapons and spare parts, since there were very few countries willing to\ndo business with Iran.\nThe Islamic Revolutionary Guards were put in charge of creating what is today known as the Iranian military industry. Under their command, Iran's military industry was enormously expanded, and with the Ministry of Defense pouring investment into the missile industry, Iran soon accumulated a vast arsenal of missiles.\nSince 1992, it has also produced its own tanks, armored personnel carriers, radar systems, guided missiles, marines, military vessels and fighter planes. Iran is also producing its own submarines.\nIn recent years, official announcements have highlighted the development of weapons such as the Fajr-3 (MIRV), Hoot, Kowsar, Fateh-110, Shahab-3 missile systems and a variety of unmanned aerial vehicles, at least one of which Israel claims has been used to spy on its territory.\nOn November 2, 2012, Iran's Brigadier General Hassan Seifi reported that the Iranian Army had achieved self-suffiency in producing military equipment, and that the abilities of Iranian scientists have enabled the country to make significant progress in this field. He was quoted saying, \"Unlike Western countries which hide their new weapons and munitions from all, the Islamic Republic of Iran's Army is not afraid of displaying its latest military achievements and all countries must become aware of Iran's progress in producing weaponry.\"\nUAV program\nIran has produced several unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which can be used for reconnaissance and combat operations. Iran has also  claimed to have downed, captured and later reverse-engineered US and Israeli drones. Iranian drones have seen extensive combat during the Syrian Civil War as well as by the Houthi movement during the Yemeni Civil War, mostly against Saudi targets. Some time after the beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the U.S. reported that Iran was supplying Russia with military drones. Iran later confirmed the reports, though it denied the drones were meant to be used in the Ukraine war, and added that China was on the list of countries looking to import Iranian drones.\nBallistic missile program\ntest,2 November 2006.]]\n]]\nOn November 2, 2006, Iran fired unarmed missiles to begin 10 days of military simulations. Iranian state television reported \"dozens of missiles were fired including Shahab-2 and Shahab-3 missiles. The missiles had ranges from 300 km to up to 2,000 km. Iranian experts have made some changes to Shahab-3 missiles installing cluster warheads in them with the capacity to carry 1,400 bombs.\" These launches came after some United States-led military exercises in the Persian Gulf on October 30, 2006, meant to train for blocking the transport of weapons of mass destruction.\nIran is also believed to have started the development of an ICBM/IRBM missile project, known as Ghadr-110 with a range of 3000&nbsp;km; the program is believed to be a parallel of the advancement of a satellite launcher named IRIS. Iran also dedicated underground ballistic missile bases and silos. Older generation platforms, like the Shahab family, are slowly being phased out of service and replaced by newer generation ballistic missiles that emphasise accuracy and manoeuvrability over longer range, such as the Fateh and Sejjil families. By 2020, the U.S. military command in the Middle East had assessed that Iran's missile forces, by far the largest and most diverse in the Middle East, have already achieved overmatch against their adversaries in the region.\nWeapons of mass destruction\nIran started a major campaign to produce and stockpile chemical weapons after a truce was agreed with Iraq after 1980–88 Iran–Iraq War. However, Iran ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1997. Iranian troops and civilians suffered tens of thousands of casualties from Iraqi chemical weapons during the 1980–88 Iran–Iraq War.\nEven as of twenty-four years after the end of the Iran–Iraq War, about 30,000 Iranians are still suffering and dying from the effects of chemical weapons employed by Iraq during the war. The need to manage the treatment of such a large number of casualties has placed Iran's medical specialists in the forefront of the development of effective treatment regimens for chemical weapons victims, and particularly for those suffering from exposure to mustard gas.\nIran ratified the Biological Weapons Convention in 1973. Iran has advanced biological and genetic engineering research programs supporting an industry that produces vaccines for both domestic use and export.\nMilitary aid\nIn 2013, Iran was reported to be suppling money, equipment, technological expertise and UAVs to the former Ba'athist Syrian government and Hezbollah during the Syrian civil war, as well as to the Iraqi government and its state-sponsored organizations like the Popular Mobilization Forces, and the Peshmerga during the War on ISIL.\nEquipment\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Iranian Fighting Vehicles\n!Model\n!Image\n!Origin\n!Quantity\n!Notes\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |Tanks\n|-\n|T-54A\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"14\" |Unknown\n|\n|-\n|T-55A\n|\n|\n|-\n|Type 69\n|\n|\n|(Captured from Iraq).\n|-\n|Safir-74\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Chonma-ho\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|T-72M\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|(Captured from Iraq), (Some with an upgraded fire-control system).\n|-\n|T-72M1\n|\n|(Some with an upgraded fire-control system).\n|-\n|T-72S\n|\n|\n|(Some with electro-optical active protection system or slat armour).\n|-\n|FV 101 Scorpion\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|(Locally upgraded examples known as Tosan).\n|-\n|FV4201 Chieftain\n|\n|(Locally upgraded examples known as Mobarez), (Some with a Russian V-84 engine).\n|-\n|M47M\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|(Some upgraded with an EO device and explosive reactive armour).\n|-\n|M48A5\n|\n|\n|-\n|M60A1 Patton\n|\n|\n|-\n|Karrar\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |Armoured Fighting Vehicles\n|-\n|EE-9\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Unknown\n|(Captured from Iraq).\n|-\n|Lynx\n|\n|\n|(Some armed with ZU-23s).\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |Infantry Fighting Vehicles\n|-\n|BMP-1\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Unknown\n|\n|-\n|BMP-2\n|\n|(Some upgraded to carry Dehlavieh ATGMs).\n|-\n|BTR-82\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |Armoured Personnel Carriers\n|-\n|BTR-50PK\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Unknown\n|\n|-\n|BTR-60PB\n|\n|\n|-\n|M113\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Boragh\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|(Can be armed with MRLs and ZU-23s).\n|-\n|Rakhsh\n|\n|(Can be armed with ZU-23s).\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicles\n|-\n|Toofan\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Unknown\n|\n|-\n|Ra'ad\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |(Yet to enter mass production).\n|-\n|Caracal\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |Infantry Mobility Vehicles (IMV)\n|-\n|M1151\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"8\" |Unknown\n|(Taken over from Afghan National Army elements that escaped to Iran).\n|-\n|YOZ 102\n|\n| rowspan=\"7\" |\n|\n|-\n|Jasour\n|\n|\n|-\n|Fateq\n|\n|(Can be armed with RCLs).\n|-\n|Roueintan\n|\n|(Yet to enter mass production).\n|-\n|Early Rakhsh\n|\n|(Can be armed with ZU-23s).\n|-\n|Late Rakhsh\n|\n|\n|-\n|Kia\n|\n|\n|}\nSee also\n* List of Iranian two-star generals since 1979\n* List of military equipment manufactured in Iran\n* Equipment of the Iranian Army\n* Current Iranian Navy vessels\n* List of Iranian Air Force aircraft\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*  Alain Rodier, , French Centre for Research on Intelligence, January 2007 – Order of Battle, strategy, asymmetric warfare, intelligence services, state terrorism.
