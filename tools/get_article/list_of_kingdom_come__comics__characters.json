      "text": "# List of Kingdom Come (comics) characters\n\n}}\nThe following is an extensive list of characters that appear in the 1996 DC Comics Elseworlds story Kingdom Come.\nProtagonists\n* Norman McCay: An elderly pastor who serves as the narrator. After Wesley Dodds' death, Norman unwillingly inherits his late friend's precognitive powers and is charged by the Spectre with deciding who will bear the guilt of the coming apocalypse. He was modeled after Norman Ross, the father of Kingdom Come artist Alex Ross.\n* Spectre: The Agent of God's Wrath takes Norman through the events of a possible future to determine who is responsible for an impending apocalyptic event, but his \"faculties are not what they once were\" and he needs a human perspective to properly judge events. Norman succeeded in convincing him to try to see these events through his guide's human perspective and the two become close friends afterwards.\nSuperman's Justice League\nMany of the members of the re-formed Justice League are either old characters in new forms or brand new adoptions of old names. Partial list:\n* Superman: Leader of the League, the silver-templed Man of Steel is growing uneasy with the role of being a world leader during a time of extreme tension. His \"S\" chest symbol shield backdrop and belt are black rather than the original yellow as a sign of mourning not only because of Lois Lane's assassination by the Joker, but his own stance regarding the superhuman issue. Due to a lifetime of absorbing yellow-solar radiation, he is more powerful than ever, and has become resistant to kryptonite.\n* Wonder Woman: Superman's lieutenant, she is slowly consumed by rage directed at the state of the world and her exile from Paradise Island. Her fellow Amazons have deemed her mission to bring peace to \"man's world\" a failure. At the conclusion, she starts a relationship with Superman and her royal station as Princess is restored.\n* Red Robin: Dick Grayson, the original Robin, has replaced his former mentor on the Justice League and is estranged from him. At the end of the story, he and Bruce reconcile and become friends again.\n* Green Lantern: Alan Scott, the Golden Age Green Lantern, does not have a power ring, as he incorporated the lantern that fueled the ring into his armor and wields a longsword of light. His space station becomes the Justice League's new satellite headquarters. At the conclusion of the miniseries, he becomes a UN charter member under the nation of \"New Oa\". His space station's design is based on the cover artwork for the Electric Light Orchestra Album \"Out of the Blue\".\n* Flash: He is referred to as \"Wallace West\" in the novelization; Mark Waid later confirmed this Flash to be Wally West in The Kingdom, despite wearing a variation of Jay Garrick's helmet. After becoming the embodiment of the Speed Force, the Flash is now faster than ever. His molecules have become unstable and as a result, he is constantly in motion. This also allows him to see every plane of existence, including ethereal planes. When Superman goes into exile, the Flash remains active, using his lightning-speed to constantly and restlessly patrol and protect Keystone City. He is saved from the Gulag bombing by Jade's shields.\n* Hawkman: Now a literal 'hawk man', he has become a guardian of nature, though also referred to as an ecological terrorist. The story does not specify which version of Hawkman this is, apart from \"combining the spirit of the old with the otherworldly flesh of the new\", which suggests he is Carter Hall in the body of the post-Zero Hour Thanagarian \"Hawkgod\". He is killed in the nuclear blast.\n* Power Woman: The former Power Girl (now physically enhanced to bodybuilder-like proportions) and the League's enforcer.\n* Ray: Son of the first Ray, he is one of the survivors of the Gulag battle after being teleported out by Fate. The Ray is responsible for removing the radiation from Kansas, twice, once after the Justice Battalion disaster and the second time after the Gulag bombing.\n*Donna Troy: Seen wearing Amazon robes, the former Wonder Girl has replaced her sister/mentor Wonder Woman as Paradise Island's ambassador to the world.

He is killed in the prison riot when Von Bach snaps his spine.\n* Hourman: The successor of the first Hourman, who does not possess his predecessor's time limit.\n* Sandman: The former Sandy, the Golden Boy, Sanderson Hawkins has taken up the mantle of Sandman after Wesley Dodds, his mentor, died.

Partial list:\n* Batman: Since his identity was made public, the Batman no longer hides behind the carefree facade of Bruce Wayne; as a result, Wayne Manor was destroyed by Two-Face and Bane. His age and lifetime of injuries force him to wear an exoskeleton at all times. His costume is an armored suit with a Xistera-like weapon and a flying belt. Batman has transformed Gotham City into a police state aided by his army of \"Bat-Knights\" patrolling the streets, controlled from the Batcave. His distrust of both Superman's League and Luthor's MLF leads him to form the Outsiders, feeling mankind should be able to make its own decisions and mistakes.\n* Ted Kord: One of Batman's three lieutenants, now wearing a Blue Beetle armored battle suit powered by the mystical scarab that gave Dan Garret his powers.\n* Oliver Queen: Batman's lieutenant, he has married his long-time love Dinah Lance, and the two had a daughter. His appearance is similar to that in The Dark Knight Returns. Green Arrow persuades some of the young heroes willing to follow Superman to change their minds and support Batman's cause. He is killed in the nuclear blast as his skeleton can be seen directly to the left of Superman, cradling his wife's corpse.\n* Dinah Queen: Batman's lieutenant, the former Black Canary now sports short gray hair, dresses herself in a practical, manly fashion and wields a crossbow after adopting her husband's crime-fighting ways.

Effectively Batman's adoptive granddaughter, she becomes close to his son Ibn al Xu'ffasch.\n* Ralph Dibny: The former Elongated Man, Ralph is contorted out of shape. It is presumed that he did not participate in the final battle at the Gulag. In Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #22, he is shown 20 years later attending Batman's funeral.\n* Creeper: Though he has aged, he is still the insane screwball he was when he was young, apparently quitting his Jack Ryder personality for good.

Batson's brainwashing is the result of bio-engineered worms created by his deceased old enemy Doctor Sivana. He is killed by deliberately setting off the nuclear bomb prematurely over Ground Zero.\n* Vandal Savage is an immortal caveman. In the novelization, Spectre expresses deep annoyance at being unable to administer justice on Savage, due to Savage's immortality. Like Luthor, Savage assists with victims of the nuclear fallout. In the additional epilogue, Batman praises Savage for his extensive healing experience.\n* '''Ibn al Xu'ffasch''': He is the son of Batman and Talia al Ghul, the heir to Ra's al Ghul's criminal organization The League of Assassins, and used as a mole to infiltrate Luthor's MLF.

Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #22 shows him at Batman's funeral 20 years later, married to Nightstar with two children: a daughter and a son.\n* Selina Kyle is the only female member of the MLF. According to the novelization, she becomes wealthy from running a cosmetics corporation.

Apart from Magog and Alloy, they all originate from Charlton Comics.\n* Magog: Ironically referred to as the new 'Man of Tomorrow', he and Alloy were the only survivors of the Battalion, and at least partially responsible for the destruction of Kansas, for which Magog later seeks forgiveness. He is seen carrying injured heroes to Jade's protective shields. At the end of the novel, Magog lives on Paradise Island and is seen disciplining Swastika, having finally seen the need for self-restraint. In the novelization, he matures to the point of becoming a dean of students there. According to Alex Ross, Magog is named after a biblical character, represents the golden calf, the scar rounding his right blind eye is also symbolical, but most importantly Magog represents \"everything we (Ross and Waid) hate in modern superhero design\", being based on Marvel Comics' Cable, and his creator Rob Liefeld.\n* Alloy is the combined form of the Metal Men and member of Magog's Justice Battalion. Along with Magog, he is the only survivor of the Kansas disaster. He later joins the Justice League. Alloy is melted by the U.N. nuclear strike.\n* Captain Atom: Member of Magog's Justice Battalion, his detonation at the hands of Parasite and the following irradiation of Kansas caused Superman's return to action.\n* Judomaster: Member of Magog's Justice Battalion, she is killed with the other members when Captain Atom explodes.\n* Nightshade: Member of Magog's Justice Battalion, she is killed when Captain Atom explodes.\n* Peacemaker: Member of Magog's Justice Battalion, his armor is reminiscent of that worn by Boba Fett. He is killed when Captain Atom detonates.\n* Thunderbolt: A member of Magog's Justice Battalion, he is killed when Captain Atom explodes. This version of Peter Cannon's costume is an homage to the Lev Gleason's Daredevil from the Golden Age of comics. Alex Ross admitted that he chose the design \"just as an excuse to draw it\".\n* Question: Present at the metahuman bar alongside Rorschach before Superman's arrival.\nCharacters with heroic legacies\nSome of the metahumans and human warriors involved are inheritors in one way or another from passed heroes. Not everybody amongst this new generation is willing to uphold the legacy resting on their shoulders:\n* Manotaur: A Minotaur-like metahuman with a Rannian armor and set of weapons, he survives the Gulag battle after being shielded from the nuclear blast by Jade. In the novelization, he becomes a teacher at Paradise Island.\n* Stars: An African-American kid; possibly related to Stripes, wearing a pilot jacket, aviator glasses, American flag bandana, and a T-shirt with an inverted American flag, he owned the cosmic rod in conjunction with the cosmic converter belt.

He survives the Gulag battle shielded from the nuclear blast by Jade.\nRogue characters\nListed below are the major, supporting, or otherwise notable characters:\n* Parasite: Contrary to his usual persona, Parasite is portrayed as an unstable villain with severe short-term memory loss problems, and a coward. He literally \"split the Atom\" when he makes contact with Captain Atom, causing a nuclear explosion that destroys Kansas.\n* 666: A gothic looking man/machine hybrid with little respect for the heroes of the past and is one of the major prisoners inside of the gulag. 666 battles other metahumans not for justice, but for sport.

The Americommando and his Minutemen were controlled by the mysterious \"Brain Trust\". All of them were captured by the Justice League.\n* Von Bach: A Yugoslavian would-be dictator who speaks in German, he was imprisoned in the Gulag for killing opponents who had already surrendered.

According to Alex Ross, he intended the character as a tribute to the work of Jack Kirby, \"if Kirby had ever got into a Japanese period\".\nOther characters\n* Jonathan Kent II / Hyperman is the son of Superman and Wonder Woman that was taken by the madman Gog. After the child slipped into hypertime after saving his parents and Batman in the past, an older Jonathan appeared before his parents displaying chronokinesis as \"Hyperman\" guided by his older self.\n* Boston Brand appears as a skeleton wearing his tattered old uniform. He is never identified as \"Deadman\", and simply introduces himself as Boston.

In the novelization, Orion hints that he recruited Jimmy Carter, Desmond Tutu, and Mikhail Gorbachev to help him run a fair election, but failed.\n* The Quintessence are Ganthet, Highfather, Phantom Stranger, Shazam and Zeus. Powerful enough that just one can stop the impending apocalypse immediately, but fearing their interference will cause a bigger disaster, they decide to do nothing. Shazam was displeased that Lex Luthor brainwashed Captain Marvel.\n* Wesley Dodds: The former Mystery Man known as the Sandman is plagued with visions of the impending apocalyptic battle between the various factions of metahumans and the human heroes.
