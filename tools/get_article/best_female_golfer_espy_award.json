      "text": "# Best Female Golfer ESPY Award\n\nThe Best Female Golfer ESPY Award has been presented annually in two different periods to the  professional female golfer adjudged to be the best in a given calendar year. It was originally presented between 1993 and 2004, but was, along with the parallel Best Male Golfer ESPY Award, subsumed in 2005 by the Best Golfer ESPY Award. In 2009, the awards were again bifurcated by sex.\nBetween 1993 and 2004, the award voting panel comprised variously fans; sportswriters and broadcasters, sports executives, and retired sportspersons, termed collectively experts; and ESPN personalities, but balloting thereafter has been exclusively by fans over the Internet from amongst choices selected by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee.\nThrough the 2001 iteration of the ESPY Awards, ceremonies were conducted in February of each year to honor achievements over the previous calendar year; awards presented thereafter are conferred in June and reflect performance from the June previous. The award wasn't awarded in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nList of winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"white-space: nowrap;\"\n!Year\n!Golfer\n!Nation of citizenship\n|-\n|1993\n|Dottie Mochrie\n|\n|-\n|1994\n|Betsy King\n|\n|-\n|1995\n|Laura Davies\n|()\n|-\n|1996\n|Annika Sörenstam\n|\n|-\n|1997\n|Karrie Webb\n|\n|-\n|1998\n|Annika Sörenstam (2)\n|\n|-\n|1999\n|Annika Sörenstam (3)\n|\n|-\n|2000\n|Juli Inkster\n|\n|-\n|2001\n|Karrie Webb (2)\n|\n|-\n|2002\n|Annika Sörenstam (4)\n|\n|-\n|2003\n|Annika Sörenstam (5)\n|\n|-\n|2004\n|Annika Sörenstam (6)\n|\n|-\n|2009\n|Lorena Ochoa\n|\n|-\n|2010\n|Lorena Ochoa (2)\n|\n|-\n|2011\n|Cristie Kerr\n|\n|-\n|2012\n|Cristie Kerr (2)\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|Stacy Lewis\n|\n|-\n|2014\n|Michelle Wie\n|\n|-\n|2015\n|Lydia Ko\n|\n|-\n|2016\n|Lydia Ko (2)\n|\n|-\n|2017\n|Ariya Jutanugarn\n|\n|-\n|2018\n|Park Sung-hyun\n|\n|-\n|2019\n|Brooke Henderson\n|\n|-\n|2020\n| colspan=2 align=center|Not awarded due to the COVID-19 pandemic\n|-\n|2021\n|Kim Sei-young\n|\n|-\n|2022\n|Nelly Korda\n|\n|}\nSee also\n*Best Male Golfer ESPY Award\n*List of golf awards\n*List of sports awards honoring women\n*List of LPGA Tour leading money winners by year\n*Rolex Player of the Year Award\n*Vare Trophy\nNotes\nReferences\n*"
