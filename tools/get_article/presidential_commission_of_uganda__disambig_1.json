Chaired by Paulo Muwanga, the commission served as the de facto executive authority as the office of President of Uganda  during a turbulent period in Uganda’s history, bridging the gap between Binaisa’s presidency and the general election that restored Milton Obote to power. The commission was established to stabilize the country amid political instability and to oversee the controversial 1980 election, which sparked significant unrest.\nComposition and Role\nThe Presidential Commission was a six-member body, with Paulo Muwanga as its chairman. Other members included key political and military figures. The commission’s primary role was to govern Uganda during the transitional period, managing state affairs and preparing for the December 1980 general election. As head of the commission, Muwanga wielded significant influence, overseeing both executive and electoral processes. The commission operated under the Uganda National Liberation Front (UNLF), a coalition formed to unify opposition groups after Amin’s fall.\nIt was composed as follows:\nLeaders and member Interim Government of Presidential Commission of Uganda\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!#\n!Position\n!Name\n!Inaugurated\n!Left office\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"4\" |National Resistance Army\n|-\n|—\n|\n|Godfrey Binaisa\n|5 May 1980\n|5 May 1980\n|-\n|1\n|Chairmen (rotating monthly)\n|Paulo Muwanga\n|5 May 1980\n|12 May 1980\n|-\n|2\n|\n|Yoweri Museveni\n|May 1980\n|May 1980\n|-\n|3\n|\n|Oyite-Ojok\n|May 1980\n|May 1980\n|-\n|4\n|\n|Tito Okello\n|May 1980\n|May 1980\n|-\n|5\n|\n|Zeddy Maruru\n|May 1980\n|May 1980\n|-\n|—\n|\n|William Omaria\n|May 1980\n|22 May 1980\n|-\n|—\n|\n|Steven Kashaka\n|22 May 1980\n|22 May 1980\n|-\n|6\n|\n|Joram Mugume\n|22 May 1980\n|22 May 1980\n|-\n|—\n|\n|Pecos Kuteesa\n|22 May 1980\n|22 May 1980\n|-\n|—\n|\n|Smith Open Acak\n|22 May 1980\n|22 May 1980\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"3\" |Presidential Commission of Uganda\n|\n|-\n|7\n|\n|Saulo Musoke\n|22  May 1980\n|15 December 1980\n|-\n|8\n|\n|Polycarp Nyamuchoncho\n|22 May 1980\n|15 December 1980\n|-\n|9\n|\n|Yoweri Hunter Wacha-Olwol\n|22 May 1980\n|15 December 1980\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"4\" |Presidential Commission of Uganda\n|-\n|10\n|\n|Milton Obote\n|15 December 1980\n|15 December 1980\n|-\n|}\n1980 General Election\nThe commission’s most significant responsibility was overseeing the general election held on December 10, 1980. Muwanga, as head of the Electoral Commission, declared the Uganda People’s Congress (UPC), led by Milton Obote, the winner, securing Obote’s return to the presidency. However, the election was marred by allegations of fraud, including ballot stuffing and voter intimidation, leading to widespread controversy. Opposition groups, particularly Yoweri Museveni’s Uganda Patriotic Movement, rejected the results, claiming the commission manipulated the outcome to favor Obote. This dissatisfaction fueled the Ugandan Bush War, a guerrilla conflict led by Museveni that eventually toppled Obote’s government in 1986.\nThe commission dissolved on December 15, 1980, when Obote assumed the presidency.\nSee also\n*Uganda\n*Uganda since 1979, part of the History of Uganda series.\n*President of Uganda\n*Politics of Uganda\n*Political parties of Uganda\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Uganda.html World Statesmen – Uganda]\n* [http://rulers.org/rulu.html#uganda Rulers.org – Uganda]\nSources"
