Mohammad Hamid Ansari, former vice-chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, formally inaugurated it on 21 April 2001. Department of AYUSH, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India gave accreditation to the academy in 2004 and promoted it as 'centre of excellence' in 2008. Membership of the academy is open to anyone who has an interest in the academy's activities particularly on history of medicine and history of science. Being a charitable organization, donations to the Academy are also exempted from Income Tax under section 80G of the Income Tax Act 1961.\nThe founder president is Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman.\nIbn Sina Academy is a part of signatories related to various health issues in the world.\nHistory\nIbn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences is an extension of Majlis Ibn Sina, which was formed in 1965 under the aegis of Tibbi Academy. Majlis Ibn Sina was a sort of monthly discussion group. For instance, the first meeting of that Majlis was held to discuss typhoid.\nTibbi Academy was itself formed in 1963 at Bhopal. In a note on page&nbsp;4, of the first book of Tibbi Academy, on Modern Times and Unani Medicine the author Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman announced the establishment of Tibbi Academy with its clear objective: \"to publicise the theoretical principles and practical ideas of Unani medicine, to publish the text of standard works of Unani medicine and also their translations… further, a learned and research oriented monthly journal\".\nFrom 1965 to 1970, a monthly journal with the title Al-Hikmat (in Urdu) from Delhi was published under the auspices of Tibbi Academy under the editorship of Syed Zillur Rahman Nadvi. The editor stated in the introduction of the first issue (May 1965, page&nbsp;2) that the journal is being issued.\nFurther, besides the above-mentioned objectives, the editor listed a couple of additional objectives, e.g., \"the search of manuscripts of the Unani medicine, their edition and publication, … to excite the feeling of the pressing need of Unani medicine literature, and to publish a standard book every year\". He lamented that despite the publication of 30-40 Tibbi magazines in India, no learned journal of Unani medicine is being published. He stressed that Al-Hikmat would be a purely scholarly journal not confined to Unani medicine: It would include some articles on basic sciences, that is, zoology, botany, chemistry, physics, astronomy and philosophy.\nIn 1970, Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman renamed the Tibbi Academy as Shifaul Mulk Memorial Committee after his teacher, Shifaul Mulk Hakim Abdul Latif (29 April 1900 – 14 November 1970), former professor and principal of Ajmal Khan Tibbiya College, Aligarh Muslim University. The purpose of this memorial committee was the same as Tibbi Academy formed in 1963, except the widened scope of publications.\nAll these past establishments — Tibbi Academy (1963), Majlis Ibn Sina (1965) and Shifaul Mulk Memorial Committee (1970) — merged and came under one trustee organisation, i.e., Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences in 2000.
