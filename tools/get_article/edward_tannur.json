A non-active cadre of the National Awakening Party, he represented the East Nusa Tenggara II electoral district and sat in Commission IV.

Shortly after, Tannur deactivated from his position in parliament.\nBackground\nEdward Tannur was born in Atambua, East Nusa Tenggara Province.

Other members of the 7 of Hary Tanoesoedibjo family contested elsewhere in Java, but their party failed to secure any seats, ending the election with less than 2% of the vote (the electoral threshold was 4%).\nSon's car incident\nTannur gained media attention after his son Ronald Gregorius Tannur (alternatively Gregorius Ronald Tannur) killed his ex-partner Dini Sera Afrianti (aged 29) by colliding her with his car and battering her corpse with it in 2023.
