The event was broadcast live online and locally through Bahrain TV, ABS-CBN Sports and Action, and OSN Sports.\nBackground\nBrave 2: Dynasty was Brave Combat Federation's second card and the second to take place in Bahrain, where the company headquarters is located.\nThe event was the third professional Mixed Martial Arts fight night to take place in Bahrain, after Desert Force 11 on March 7, 2014, and its predecessor Brave 1: The Beginning on September 23, 2016.\nBrave 2 was originally supposed to be headlined by the fight between Mexico's Masio Fullen and Germany's Alan Omer for the inaugural featherweight title. One week before the fight, Omer suffered a severe eyebrow laceration and pulled from the fight. One day later, Masio Fullen also pulled, due to a rib injury and the title fight was canceled. Brave then promoted Gadzhimusa Gaziev vs Carl Booth from the co-main event to the main event spot.\nWith the card dropping to nine bouts after Omer vs Fullen being scrapped, the promotion added a tenth bout, a last-minute strawweight addition between Jomar Pa-ac and Haider Farman.\nOttman Azaitar was supposed to face New Zealand's John Vake in a featured main card fight but Vake failed to reach an agreement for the bout, being replaced by Kevin Koldobsky in the Welterweight match.\nSBG Ireland's Ben Forsyth was supposed to make his Brave debut against India's Amit Thapa but Thapa failed to reach an agreement for the bout. In turn, Tyree Fortune, from the United States, was scheduled to fight Forsyth.\nThe Maradona controversy\nOne of the biggest controversies of Brave 2 promotion involved Argentina's football player and FIFA World Cup champion Diego Maradona. Before the event, Maradona appeared in a video giving his support to Ottman Azaitar, whose brother is friends with the former footballer. The story came up in social media and the Argentinian fans got revolted with the support from the idol to a foreign athlete instead of his fellow countryman Kevin Koldobsky.\nBroadcast\nThe event was broadcast internationally online, through Brave's official website and YouTube channel, for free. In addition, the card was also broadcast in Bahrain through Bahrain TV, Middle East through OSN Sports, and Asia through ABS-CBN Sports and Action.\nBroadcasting team\n*Play-by-play commentator: Cyrus Fees\n*Color Commentator: Alex Soto (former UFC, Titan FC, and Bellator fighter)\n*Cage announcer: Carlos Kremer\nResults\n}}\nCarl Booth\n|def.\n|Gadzhimusa Gaziev\n|TKO (punches)\n|2\n|2:24\n}}Ottman Azaitar\n|def.\n|Kevin Koldobsky\n|Decision (unanimous) (30x27, 30x27, 30x27)\n|3\n|5:00\n|\n}}\nHamza Kooheji\n|def.\n|Jeremy Pacatiw\n|Decision (unanimous) (29x28, 29x28, 29x28)\n|3\n|5:00\n|\n}}\nJarrah Al Silawi\n|def.\n|Erik Carlsson\n|Submission (Kimura)\n|2\n|1:39\n|\n}}\nElias Boudegzdame\n|def.\n| Walel Watson\n|Submission (Kimura)\n|1\n|1:47\n|\n}}\nAlex Leko\n|def.\n| Daniel Swain\n|TKO (punches)\n|2\n|4:37\n|\n}}\nGurdarshan Mangat\n|def.\n| Troy Bantiag\n|TKO (punches)\n|2\n|0:23\n|\n}}\nTyree Fortune\n|def.\n| Ben Forsyth\n|Decision (unanimous) (30x27, 30x27, 30x27)\n|3\n|5:00\n|\n}}\nCristian Quiñonez\n|def.\n| Ahmed Faress\n|TKO (punches)\n|2\n|2:46\n|\n}}\nJomar Pa-ac\n|def.\n| Haider Farman\n|Decision (unanimous) (30-27, 29-28, 29-28)\n|3\n|5:00\n|\n}}\nBonus Awards\n*Fight of the Night: Haider Farman x Jomar Pa-ac\n*Knockout of the Night: Carl Booth\n*Submission of the Night: Elias Boudegzdame\nReferences"
