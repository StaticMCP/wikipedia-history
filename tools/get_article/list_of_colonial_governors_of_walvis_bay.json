The list encompass the period from 1878 to 1994, when Walvis Bay and the surrounding territory (including the Penguin Islands) was controlled by the United Kingdom and later by South Africa.\nThe list also encompasses the period of joint Namibian-South African control of Walvis Bay, from 1993 to 1994.\nThe title of the position changed a number of times.  Under British rule, the title of the position went from Captain (1878) to Resident Magistrate (1878–1883) to Magistrate (1883–1910).  Under South African rule, the title was Magistrate (1910–1925), Magistrate and Chairman of Village Management Board (1925–1931) and Mayor (1931–1994).  Under joint Namibian-South African rule, the title was Chief Executive Officer of Joint Administrative Authority (1993–1994).\nList\n(Dates in italics indicate de facto continuation of office)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=left\n!
