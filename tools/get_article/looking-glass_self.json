The term describes the process by which individuals develop their self-concept based on their understanding of how others perceive them. According to Cooley, individuals form their self-image by imagining how they appear to others, interpreting others’ reactions, and internalizing these perceptions. This reflective process functions like a mirror, wherein individuals use social interactions to observe themselves indirectly. Over time, these imagined evaluations by others can influence and shape one's self-assessment. Sociologist Lisa McIntyre, in The Practical Skeptic: Core Concepts in Sociology, further elaborates that the looking-glass self encapsulates the tendency for individuals to interpret and understand their identities through the lens of others' perceived judgments.\nCooley's three steps\nCooley takes into account three steps when defining \"the looking glass self\".\n1) The imagination of our appearance from another person's perspective\n2) The imagination of person's judgment of us.\n3) An emotional reaction such as pride or shame, based on the judgment attributed to the other person.\nAs a result of the three-step process, individuals may change their behavior based on what they feel other people think about them. In this way, social interaction acts as a \"mirror\" or a \"looking-glass\", since one's sense of self and self-esteem is built off of others.\nFor example, an individual may walk into a job interview with confidence and attempt to display this confidence. A person in this situation most often examines the reactions of the interviewers, to see if they are positively or negatively reacting to it. If the individual notices positive reactions, such as nodding heads or smiles, this might further develop the individual's sense of self-confidence. If the individual notices negative reactions, such as a lack of interest, this confidence in self often becomes shaken and reformed in order to better oneself, even if the perceived judgments were not necessarily true.\nRole in social media\nSocial media reflects the mechanisms of the looking-glass self, as different forms of social media offer many different \"mirrors\" in which individuals present themselves, perceive judgements of others based on likes, follows, etc., and further develop their sense of self. Indeed, as cyberpsychologist Mary Aiken, PhD. explains, social media has created a concept named the \"cyber self\", a version one wishes to portray online and to the public, that is based on the judgements of others. Unlike the real self, different forms of media allow judgements to be clearly posted, so in many cases, judgements may not even need to be imagined. Aiken explains this concept best, noting that \"selfies ask a question of their audience: Like me like this?\" Far different from face-to-face interactions, social media is intended to be accessible and public at all times. Users are constantly exposed to criticism and judgement from others, and so the cyber self can be easily changed and perfected to fit the supposed acceptance of others.\nThese aspects of social media and its relationship with the looking-glass self present a whole range of effects on social media users. Aiken notes that individuals, and particularly teenagers, who are increasingly involved in updating their online personas, risk damaging the development of their real-world self. She also notes that this effect may be even greater among users who display all different sorts of \"cyber selves\" among different platforms with different purposes, such as between X (previously Twitter), Instagram, and LinkedIn. A social media study also uncovered a host of positive effects of the use of social media and in developing oneself, with dozens of creators citing that producing content gave them a sense of self-confidence and self-worth, enhanced their creativity, increased their sense of professionality, and that their platforms offered a positive space to interact with others.\nThe negative effects of the looking-glass self can be harmful to the people's mentality. According to Zsolt Unoka and Gabriella Vizin's, To See In a Mirror Dimly. The Looking-Glass is Self-Shaming in Borderline Personality Disorder, shame is a large factor in the development of Borderline Personality Disorder. The feeling of shame and insufficient self-worth comes from traumatic experiences such as abuse, neglect, abandonment, shaming family situations, and harsh upbringing. Therefore, the looking-glass self can cause feelings of insufficient self-worth and mental health issues.\nAccording to Susan Harter's, The Perceived Directionality of the Link Between Approval and Self-Worth: The Liabilities of a Looking Glass Self-Orientation Among Young Adolescents, self-worth in adolescents is based mainly on their peer's approval of them. In a world of social media, seeking attention and approval from others is how adolescents determine their self-worth. They create an image of themselves they think others will approve of. This is in close relation to the concept of the looking glass self. Adolescents experience anxiety and depression based on a low opinion of self-worth, and they base this self-worth on other's opinions of them.\nStudies\nThe term \"looking-glass self\" was coined by Cooley after extensive psychological testing in 1902.\nFamily study\nIn another study in the Journal of Family Psychology in 1998, researchers Cook and Douglas measured the validity of the looking glass self and symbolic interaction in the context of familial relationships. The study analyzed the accuracy of a college student's and an adolescent's perceptions of how they are perceived by their parents, surveying mothers, fathers, college students, and adolescents.\nThree areas were investigated: assertiveness, firmness, and cooperation. In reference to the three areas, respondents were asked the following: how they behave toward the target, how the target behaves toward them, and how they think they are viewed by the target. The study identified the looking glass self as a \"metaperception\" because it involves \"perception of perceptions\".  One of the hypotheses tested in the study was: If \"metaperceptions\" cause self-perceptions, they will necessarily be coordinated. The hypothesis was tested at the individual and relationship levels of analysis.\nFindings\nThe study determined that the hypothesis is strongly supported at the individual level for cooperation for both college students and adolescents, but is only partially supported for assertiveness for college students.  Also, for college students, at the relationship level with their mothers the study supported assertiveness. There was an irregular finding regarding firmness in the mother-adolescent relationship that indicated that the firmer adolescents were perceived by their mothers, the less firm they rated themselves in the relationship. While there was not strong support of the hypothesis on the relationship level, on the individual level the findings suggest that how college students and adolescents think about themselves is directly correlated to how they think they are perceived by their parents.\nSocial media study\nIn 2015, Julie Jones, a professor at the University of Oklahoma, asked a range of questions to 46 YouTube producers to evaluate how producing in media has positively or negatively affected them. As Jones explains, \"digital media can serve as a mediated mirror and social media sites provide the space where others' judgments are clearly posted.\"\nFindings\nOf the YouTube producers asked, many noted that producing content gave them a sense of self-confidence and self-worth, enhanced their creativity, increased their sense of professionality, and their platforms offered a positive space to interact with others.\nEmoji study\nWith the increasing prevalence of online communication in interpersonal relationships, scholarly attention has turned to the role of digital media in shaping self-perception. A systematic literature review by Huang, Hu, and Li (2022) suggested that the concept of the looking-glass self—a person's self-concept developed through interpersonal interactions—can be produced, reinforced, and reshaped through online media platforms.\nEmojis and memes serve as visual tools that compensate for the lack of nonverbal cues in text-based digital communication. These elements convey emotional tone, attitude, and vocal nuance that are otherwise difficult to express through written text alone. The same study also reported survey results from 460 respondents, revealing that 30.6% of participants used emojis specifically to influence how they are perceived by others online. This finding indicates that users employ emojis and memes as strategic tools for self-expression and the construction of their online personas.\nFeedback received from others in response to such visual communication plays a critical role in reinforcing or altering an individual's looking-glass self. The process of interpreting and responding to these digital cues contributes to a dynamic cycle in which self-perception is continually shaped by social interaction in online environments.\nTherefore, beyond serving a basic expressive function, emojis and memes have emerged as significant instruments in the development and transformation of self-identity in digital contexts.\nAdolescence study\nIn a longitudinal study in the International Journal of Behavioral Development in 2018, researchers investigated self-other agreement, which refers to the similarity between adolescents' perception of their own personality and their parents' perception. Building on the looking-glass self, researchers examined whether self-other agreement in personality between adolescents and their parents promoted self-esteem development from adolescence to adulthood. The researchers specifically examined whether the effect of self-other agreement prevailed after controlling for personality traits and whether the impact differed between boys and girls. It was hypothesized that when there is high agreement, adolescents may form a clearer and more confident self-view, thereby supporting positive development.\nFindings\nThe study revealed significant differences in self-esteem development between boys and girls. For girls, higher self-parent agreement at adolescence predicted greater increases in self-esteem through young adulthood. For boys, higher self-parent agreement at age 12 predicted lower self-esteem at age 17, but also predicted steep increases in adulthood self-esteem. The gender difference was explained by the idea that, by late adolescence, boys' self-views are more established and less influenced by parents than girls'.\nApplications\nApplications in child development and residential care\nThe looking-glass self hypothesis (LGSH) has been extended beyond general social psychology into developmental and clinical settings, especially in understanding how vulnerable youth form self-concepts. Two empirical studies by Silva and Calheiros tested the LGSH in the context of significant caregiving relationships—first with maltreated children and their mothers, and later with adolescents in residential care and their professional caregivers.\nIn their 2021 study, the researchers examined how children and adolescents internalize their mothers’ actual appraisals (i.e., what mothers truly think of their children) through their perceived appraisals (i.e., what children believe their mothers think of them). The findings demonstrated that children's self-representations were significantly shaped by these perceived judgments, particularly in emotional and intellectual domains. The results supported the looking-glass self hypothesis and showed how maltreatment—especially psychological neglect—distorts reflected appraisals, often leading to lower self-esteem and negative self-views.\nExpanding this framework, their 2022 study tested the LGSH in the context of youth-caregiver relationships in residential care, involving 755 youth and 300 caregivers. Results revealed that youth's self-concepts were significantly mediated by how they believed caregivers viewed them. This mediation was observed across various domains, including social behavior, emotional well-being, competence, and misfit identity. The study underscored the central role of professional caregivers in shaping positive identity construction in youth who have experienced trauma or abandonment. Notably, when caregivers held more positive views and communicated them effectively, youth developed healthier and more confident self-concepts.\nTogether, these studies provide robust empirical support for Cooley's theory, emphasizing the importance of significant others—whether parents or caregivers—as psychological \"mirrors\" in self-construction. They also illustrate the potential of supportive relational environments in mitigating the negative effects of adversity on identity development.\nApplications in mental health and recovery\nThe looking-glass self theory has been applied to the field of mental health recovery, particularly in community-based case management for persons with severe mental illness (SMI). Kondrat and Teater (2012) proposed that relationships between mental health consumers and their case managers act as mechanisms of self-change through reflective appraisal processes. Drawing on Charles Horton Cooley's original theory, they argued that consumers internalize how they believe their case managers perceive them—whether with hope and empowerment or with stigma and limitation.\nIn this model, the looking-glass self process becomes a critical tool for fostering recovery-oriented identity development. Consumers who perceive that case managers see them as capable, valuable, and on a path toward recovery are more likely to internalize those beliefs and reshape their self-concepts accordingly. Conversely, when professionals convey low expectations, consumers may adopt self-defeating views and remain stuck in stigmatized identities.\nThe authors emphasized that therapeutic relationships are not only sources of support, but also mirrors that reflect back identity possibilities. They call for practitioners to consciously model recovery-affirming beliefs, using Cooley's theory as a guiding framework for relational empowerment in social work and mental health care.\nCritical perspectives\nIt has been argued that the looking glass self conceptualization of the social self is critically incomplete in that it overlooks the divergent roles of ingroups and outgroups in self-definition. That is, it has been demonstrated that while individuals will converge upon the attitudes and behaviours of ingroup members, they will also diverge from the attitudes and behaviours of outgroup members. The neglect of the latter scenario is attributed to the looking glass approaches' implicit focus on ingroup member appraisals. This alternative perspective is derived from the self-categorization theory analysis of social influence. Indeed, it is further argued that the looking glass self metaphor fails to reflect the fact that influence derives from the self-categorization of other individuals as part of the self. In other words, people are not shaped by the reflections from 'others', but rather are shaped by the creation of a collective social identity that contrasts 'us' against relevant 'others'. Therefore, the concept of self-identity may be considered an example of a social construction.\nRelated concepts\nSociometer hypothesis\nSource:\nThe sociometer hypothesis was created by Mark R. Leary, Ellen S. Tambor, Sonja K. Terdal, Deborah L. Downs. Ultimately, the hypothesis aims to explain self-esteem as a measure of one's acceptance into society (i.e. their inclusionary status), to indicate whether one is at risk of being socially ostracized. This ability is speculated to have evolved from monitoring the expressions as a method to gauge group membership.\nFurthermore, it theorizes parts of the self are constructed based on qualities that are thought to be highly valued by others (i.e. intelligence, athleticism, temperament, etc.). These values are reflected in how an individual weighs different domains of their self regarding desirability (i.e. traits that are perceived to be more socially sought out for hold greater significance). These values are then reflected in the evaluation of one's self-esteem; that is, the higher the self-esteem, the more an individual perceives them as socially accepted and vice versa. Hence why individuals with low self-esteem are thought to be sensitive to indicators of social acceptance, whereas those with high self-esteem are less susceptible.\nDecreases in self-esteem are deemed a warning sign that one's interpersonal relationships may be at risk of being jeopardized. On the other hand, occasions that threaten one's ego signal a decline in one's bonds. Ergo, in response to observing a change in their self-esteem, it is predicted that the individual will engage in maintenance behaviours.\nAffect is also thought to be closely intertwined with self-esteem. As a byproduct of self-esteem, fluctuations are predicted to produce feelings of social anxiety.\nSymbolic interaction\nIn hypothesizing the framework, \"the mind is mental\" because \"the human mind is social\". From the time they are born, humans define themselves within the context of their social interactions. Children learn that the symbol of their crying will elicit a response from their caregivers, not only when they are in need of necessities such as food or a diaper change, but also when they are in need of attention. Cooley best explains this interaction in On Self and Social Organization, noting that \"a growing solidarity between mother and child parallels the child's increasing competence in using significant symbols. This simultaneous development is itself a necessary prerequisite for the child's ability to adopt the perspectives of other participants in social relationships and, thus, for the child's capacity to develop a social self.\"\nGeorge Herbert Mead described the creation of the self as the outcome of \"taking the role of the other\", the premise for which the self is actualized. Through interaction with others, we begin to develop an identity of our own as well as developing a capacity to empathize with others. As stated by Cooley, \"The thing that moves us to pride or shame is not the mere mechanical reflection of ourselves, but an imputed sentiment, the imagined effect of this reflection upon another's mind\" (Cooley 1964).\nМмУИ\nSee also\n* Expectancy effect\n* Michelangelo phenomenon\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*McGraw Hill Ryerson \"Challenge and Change: Patterns, Trends and Shifts in Society\" New York: 2012 pp.&nbsp;130  for quote \"In Cooley's words, 'I am not what I think I am and I am not what you think I am; I am what I think you think I am.\n*\n*Cooley, Charles H.
