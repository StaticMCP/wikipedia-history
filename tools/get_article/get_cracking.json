      "text": "# Get Cracking\n\nGet Cracking is a 1943 British comedy war film, directed by Marcel Varnel starring George Formby, with Dinah Sheridan and Ronald Shiner. It was produced by Marcel Varnel and Ben Henry for Columbia (British) Productions, a subsidiary of the American studio. The film opens like a World War Two documentary with a narrator explaining the action, before becoming a more traditional Formby vehicle.\nSynopsis\nMechanic and Home Guard lance corporal George Singleton (Formby) has an adversary in a fellow Home Guard, Everett Manley (Shiner). When the rival Home Guard units of Major Wallop and Minor Wallop are sent on battle manoeuvres, George launches his own unique style of commando raid against neighbouring Major Wallop to steal a Vickers machine gun. The raid fails and Singleton loses his lance corporal stripe, so he and a little evacuee girl named Irene decide to build their very own tank. The venture is such a success that George is made a sergeant.\nThe film includes three songs from Formby: 'Under the Blasted Oak', 'Home Guard Blues' and 'Get Cracking'.\nProduction\nThe film was released on 17 May 1943 and runs for 96 minutes in black and white. It was written by L. du Garde Peach, Michael Vaughan and John L. Arthur, while the songs were written by George Formby with Fred Godfrey, Fred E. Cliffe and Eddie Latta.\nCast list\n* George Formby as George Singleton -\n* Dinah Sheridan as Mary Pemberton\n* Edward Rigby as Sam Elliott\n* Frank Pettingell as Alf Pemberton\n* Ronald Shiner as Everett Manley\n* Wally Patch as Sergeant Joe Preston\n* Mike Johnson as Josh\n* Irene Handl as Maggie Turner\n* Vera Frances as Irene\n* Frank Atkinson as Station Master\n* Ben Williams as Home Guard\n* Harry Fowler (Uncredited)\n* E.
