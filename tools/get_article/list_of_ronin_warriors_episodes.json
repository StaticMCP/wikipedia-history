A young man named Ryo and his tiger White Blaze mysteriously appears in the street, nearly causing a young boy named Jun to be injured while skateboarding. Násti and her grandfather believe that Ryo is one of the Ronin Warriors and that there is perhaps hope for the world. Násti rushes off to meet Ryo, but he is surrounded by police. Meanwhile, the storm clouds move in and all power cuts out, leaving cars stranded and causing a helicopter to crash. As glass shatters all over the city from a massive lightning strike, everyone but Ryo runs in fear and Jun gets separated from his parents. Ryo calls out for the Dynasty to fight him and a Dynasty soldier shows up and the two battle. Ryo battles the soldier with the aid of White Blaze, which proves difficult, and Jun, who comes across the battle, is nearly killed before Násti saves him. Ryo and White Blaze are defeated and Ryo is about to be killed when another Ronin Warrior, Rowen, protects him. The other Ronin Warriors, Cye, Sage and Kento also arrive to fight. The Warriors summon their full armor and fight the soldier, but don't work as a team and are therefore unable to defeat him. He takes Jun and Násti hostage, trapping them in a television screen where they feel every injury he receives. The soldier beats up Ryo until he calls up his ultimate attack, \"Flare Up Now\", destroying the soldier and accidentally blasting the building behind him in half. Násti and Jun are set free and the Dark Warlords and Arago, the leaders of the Dynasty introduce themselves, sure in their victory over the Ronin Warriors, whom they see as weak, while a giant castle appears in the sky.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = June 27, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Arago sends the Dark Warlord of Cruelty Anubis to eliminate the Ronin Warriors, telling him to target Násti as the Warriors will fight to protect her. The military tries to launch an attack on Arago's castle to no avail as the Dynasty turns their own weapons against them and obliterates the attacking force. Anubis finds the Warriors, Násti and Jun hiding in the subway and attacks. The Warriors use their armor to form the Circle of Power to protect Násti and Jun, but without their armors, they are no match for Anubis and he ties them up with his Quake With Fear attack. The Ronins are unable to dissolve the circle and call upon their armors, but the mystic Kháos appears and uses his staff to dissolve it himself. The Ronins summon their armor and Ryo and Anubis launch their most powerful attacks against each other at the same time. One of Ryo's swords gets knocked from his hand and he passes out, but Anubis is injured too. Realizing that the Circle of Power is unbroken and that he cannot allow the Ronins to face him, Arago sends a tornado of dark energy that picks up the Warriors and scatters them to the most desolate regions on Earth.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = June 28, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Násti and Jun find the sword Ryo dropped and are taken by White Blaze towards the volcano where Arago dropped him. Ryo awakens and starts climbing out while Arago sends Anubis to destroy him for good. Anubis and a bunch of Dynasty soldiers chase down Násti and Jun, believing that the two will lead them to Ryo, but they are saved by Kháos who uses his staff to open a giant chasm, taking out the Dynasty soldiers, though Anubis emerges unharmed. The staff also restores power to the city and finding Násti's abandoned jeep working now, Násti and Jun head off again to find Ryo. Ryo climbs out of the volcano, but is attacked by Anubis. White Blaze returns his missing sword, but Anubis knocks him back into the volcano again. However, Ryo's power is increased and he emerges as more than a match for Anubis. Anubis captures Násti and Jun and Ryo is unable to approach them as his armor is hot enough to incinerate them. Anubis casts them into the volcano to force Ryo to get rid of his armor to rescue them then prevents him from re-summoning it and beats him up and tosses him in the volcano again, but Ryo manages to pull Anubis in with him. Both manage to get to safety in the volcano which starts to erupt. Ryo calls upon his armor again and destroys Anubis' weapons as the volcano erupts and knocks Anubis into the eruption, but Anubis survives and is yelled at by Arago for his failure. Násti, Jun, Ryo and White Blaze vow to find the remaining Warriors who they believe are still alive and Ryo accepts that they need to work as a team to defeat the Dynasty. This pleases Kháos who is watching from nearby.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = June 29, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = With Anubis having failed, Arago sends Sekhmet after the Ronin Warriors. It is also shown that Arago has captured the people of the city. At the suggestion of Násti, she, Ryo, Jun and White Blaze head to the university where her grandfather works to get his help in finding the other Ronin Warriors. On the way, the group stops by Jun's house to try to find his parents, but have no luck, so Jun vows he will help the Warriors defeat Arago and save the world. At the university, the group tries to enlist the help of Násti's grandfather, but he refuses to help, telling them to just give up. Jun realizes that two suits of armor are two disguised Dynasty soldiers that attack. Ryo, with help from White Blaze and Jun, defeats the soldiers, but Dr. Yagyu is possessed by a Dynasty spirit and attacks too. Ryo manages to free Dr. Yagyu, but he has been poisoned by the Dynasty and dies, but not before revealing that the Warriors have been returned to the places where their armor was created. Násti tries to find the answer in his computer while Sekhmet watches nearby, planning to follow them and attack once they find their comrades. However, White Blaze detects the Dark Warlord and attacks him. Ryo notices the fight and joins in, but is unable to defeat Sekhmet. Finally Násti realizes that her grandfather was referring to a poem he used to teach her and finds it on the computer before the university is destroyed. Jun notices that Sekhmet doesn't have six arms like it appears, he's just moving his arms really fast and informs Ryo who uses the information to defeat him. Following the information found in the riddle, the group then heads to the Akiyoshidai Plataeu with Sekhmet following them, unknown to them.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = June 30, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = On the road to the Akiyoshidai Plataeu, Násti explains that she believes Sage was sent to the caverns there as the first verse of the poem led to Ryo while the next verse is \"the light blossoms when in the darkest prison\" and Sage is the Warrior of Light. They reach the Akiyoshidai Plataeu followed by Sekhmet who plans to kill Sage while he's sleeping, but White Blaze senses his presence and alerts Ryo who starts a battle with him. Ryo discovers that his armor has grown more powerful since he awakened in the volcano and realizes that he grows stronger with each battle. Sekhmet blinds him with his poison, but White Blaze saves him and they escape. Using his swords, Ryo tracks down Sage who is imprisoned in rock while Násti and Jun are captured by Sekhmet and Dynasty soldiers. Sekhmet attacks Ryo who is no match for him without his sight, but Ryo manages to shatter Sage's prison. Sage emerges and quickly defeats Sekhmet with his Thunder Bolt Cut, blasting him away. Outside the caves, Sage heals Ryo's eyesight using his sword and the sun.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = July 3, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = The group discovers the next clue \"Whirling water, sounding distant, calling you\" and realize that Cye's probably in the Naruto Straight. Finding a whirlpool, the group splits up to find the Warriors: Násti and Sage head north to find Kento (with Arago sending Cale to do the same) while Ryo, White Blaze and Jun stay to save Cye. Ryo battles a bunch of Dynasty soldiers and summons his armor to defeat them, while White Blaze takes out two enemy archers. However, as Ryo heads underwater to find Cye, something goes wrong with his armor and Sekhmet attacks. It turns out Ryo's armor is being affected by Sekhmet's poison amplified by the water and he is defeated. Sekhmet heads to finish Cye off before he can awaken, but is attacked by fish and a whale. He kills all of them, but it allows Ryo's swords to wake Cye. Cye blasts Sekhmet and rescues Ryo before returning to the water to continue the battle. As in the water Cye is immune to his poison, Sekhmet brings them to a bridge nearby and beats up Cye. Jun and White Blaze revive Ryo by dragging him into a fire and he steps in to help Cye. Combining Cye's Super Wave Smasher and Ryo's Flare Up Now, they defeat Sekhmet which Arago is not pleased with. Seeing the power of their teamwork, the two vow to find their friends and unite to defeat the Dynasty.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = July 4, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Násti and Sage travel to Mount Daisetsu to find Kento, unknowingly followed by Cale. After they are forced to abandon Násti's jeep, Sage heads off on his own and orders Násti to return to the city, but she refuses and follows him. A snowstorm starts and Násti is attacked by a pack of wild wolves, but is saved by Sage. Cale tries to take them out with an avalanche, but they jump out of the way and the wolves are swept away by the avalanche. Knowing it is too dangerous for Násti to leave if Arago or his Warlords caused that, Sage allows Násti to come with him and they head to a giant rock called The Throne of the Gods. Násti believes that this is what the line of the poem \"burning within a throne of rock\" meant when it referred to Kento's location. Cale attacks the two and Sage tries to break the rock with his Thunder Bolt Cut, but does no damage to it. Cale thrusts his sword into the rock and it will seek out Kento's heart and kill him before he wakes. Sage and Cale battle, but Sage is unable to defeat him and he and Násti fall over a cliff next a waterfall. The two fall into a cave and as they lay unconscious, Kháos appears and tells Sage that he needs to unlock the full power of his armor by achieving concentration of both mind and body then disappears before Sage wakes up. Násti decides to distract Cale while Sage rescues Kento and upon reaching a cliff-top, calls Cale out. He doesn't appear, but she notices Kháos and remembers how he dissolved the Circle of Power and gave the Ronins back their armor and saved her and Sage from drowning and wonders why he just doesn't save Kento himself. As he walks away, Násti calls after him and follows, but he disappears as the snow starts up again. Cale catches her and dangles her in a waterfall to draw the meditating Sage out. When that fails, he freezes the waterfall, but Sage emerges and saves Násti. With his full power unlocked, it restores life to the land and he successfully uses the Thunder Bolt Cut on the rock as the sword reaches Kento. At first it appears as if Sage acted too late, but Kento bursts out of the rock and causes an explosion that blows Cale away. With Kento rescued, the three head back to the city to reunite with the others and find Rowen.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = July 5, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Arago sends Dais to destroy the Ronin Warriors before they can locate and rescue Rowen. As they drive back to the city, Násti explains the poem to Sage and Kento, explaining that the last verse that will lead them to Rowen is \"floating amongst the eyes of the ages, unmoored in the stream of the sky,\" but she has no idea what this means. At a temple, Ryo, Cye, Jun and White Blaze wait for the others, but Jun is captured by Dais. Ryo and Cye battle him to save Jun and manage to free Jun, but he nearly falls to his death before White Blaze saves him. Dais easily defeats Ryo and Cye and then claims that he holds Rowen captive and tells them to meet him in the city of Sandai to rescue him. Ryo and Cye head off to find Rowen, leaving Jun and White Blaze behind to let the others know what happened. At Sandai, Ryo and Cye find Rowen held captive by Dynasty soldiers. The two armor up and destroy the soldiers and it is revealed that \"Rowen\" is actually an illusion and that it is really Dais. Dais creates an illusion so that Ryo and Cye each believe that they are fighting Dais, but are really fighting each other. The two use their ultimate attacks on each other, and knock each other out, realizing the truth just after they attack. Dais prepares to finish them, but the others arrive and he decides to do the same to Sage and Kento. Sage sees through the illusion and drops his weapon, but Kento doesn't and beats Sage up. After the truth is revealed, Kento turns on Dais and uses his Iron Rock Crusher to drive him off. While the group recovers from their wounds, Ryo sees a shooting star and realizes that \"unmoored in the stream of the sky\" means that Rowen is floating in outer space and Násti believes that he's right.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = July 6, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Now that they know where Rowen is, the Warriors try to figure out how to get to him. Not having a way to do so themselves, they realize that Arago will try to destroy Rowen himself and they decide to try to find out what that method will be. Násti proposes that two of the Warriors find out Arago's plan while the other two return to the city. When the Warriors get into an argument about who will go, Násti chooses Cye and Sage herself, but that night, Ryo, Kento and White Blaze sneak off to do the job themselves after telling Jun to tell Násti when she wakes up. Arago summons the Nether Spirits to deal with Rowen, explaining to the Warlords that the spirits can combine their powers together to create a massive supernatural construct called a Dark Matrix that will be able to destroy anything it's sent against. Arago plans to send it to destroy Rowen. As Kento and Ryo approach the building where the Dark Matrix is, Arago sends Dynasty soldiers to distract them. Though they easily defeat them, the Dark Matrix is launched, but Kháos intervenes and destroys it. Arago calls upon the spirits again to form another one while sending Anubis to stop Ryo and Kento. The two battle him, then, knowing they're running out of time, armor up and start climbing the building. However, the energy from the Dark Matrix strikes Anubis and gives him even more power and then while he battles Ryo and Kento, causes their armor to start squeezing them to death. The Dark Matrix starts to launch and Ryo, seeing his only chance to save Rowen, jumps on it to ride it into space, but is absorbed by the matrix. Kento meets up with the others and informs them of what happened and they watch as the Dark Matrix launches into space.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = July 7, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Ryo is alive inside the Dark Matrix, but his armor is absorbing the energy from it and slowly crushing him. Arago appears to the others and taunts them about the fact that Ryo and Rowen will soon be dead and sends his soldiers to face them. Anubis asks for a fair fight against Ryo, claiming it won't be victory if the Warriors aren't defeated in a fair fight, but Arago refuses to listen to him and plans to use the power of the Nether Realm to destroy the Warriors and sends Anubis away. Inside the Dark Matrix, as Ryo is slowly crushed, he realizes that if he doesn't do something both he and Rowen will die. Channeling the energy his armor is absorbing, Ryo launches Flare Up Now and destroys the Dark Matrix from within. Seeing this from the ground, the other Warriors despair, but continue fighting. Ryo survives the explosion, but passes out and starts to drift out into space. However, Rowen wakes up and uses his bow to reel Ryo in. Rowen propels them back to Earth which the other Warriors witness and rejoice. Anubis senses it too and heads out to stop Ryo and Rowen while Arago realizes that another power has awakened inside of Anubis. Rowen doesn't remember what happened and before Ryo can explain, they are attacked by Anubis. Ryo is injured and weakened from the energy ball and fails when he tries Flare Up Now on Anubis who captures him and Rowen with Quake With Fear. However, Anubis hesitates to kill the helpless Ryo with his desire for a fair fight conflicting with his Dynasty morals. Before he can decide, Rowen hits him with Arrow Shockwave. Anubis survives the attack, but his mask and helmet breaks in half, revealing to a shocked Rowen that he's human. Anubis tries to attack Rowen again, but is stopped by Arago himself as his loyalty seems to be faltering. Arago teleports Anubis back to his castle. The other Warriors, Násti, Jun and White Blaze arrive and the Ronin Warriors are finally reunited. Seeing that he has failed to stop the Warriors reunion, Arago orders his castle gates sealed against the inevitable attack.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = July 10, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Arago has his castle gates closed and the defenses activated. A bank of think fog rolls over Toyama and Násti reveals that it is part of the castle's defenses. The group walks along and comes to a bank of thick black fog that's another part of the defenses and Kento tries to enter with a vehicle, but is attacked by streams of energy and driven out. The energy attacks the rest of the group, but they manage to escape. In the castle, Arago summons Dais to deal with the Warriors and he convinces Arago to open the gates and let the Warriors in so he can draw them into a trap, explaining that their armor will be easier to control inside the castle with the hep of the Nether Spirits. Arago agrees, but warns Dais that he will be very angry if Dais fails to stop the Warriors. The fog is lifted and the group is able to see the four gates to Arago's castle, but decide to leave Násti and Jun behind as it is too dangerous. Ryo refuses to listen to Jun's pleas to let him come and slaps him, causing Jun to run off. Násti follows him and Ryo sends White Blaze after them to protect them while he and the other Warriors enter the gates, closing them behind them. Dais arrives and opens the gates, summoning the Nether Spirits. Unable to defeat Dais, the Warriors try to summon their armor, but the spirits block their powers and Dais easily defeats them. Násti finds Jun who knows Ryo never meant to hurt him and convinces her that they need to help the Warriors. They notice their friends in trouble and start to go to help them, but the spirits attack them, but Kháos's staff appears and drives them away. Dais ties up the Warriors and offers Ryo his life in exchange for serving Arago, but Ryo refuses so Dais cuts him down to kill him. Before he can, Násti, Jun and White Blaze arrive and Dais tries to attack them, but Kháos's staff protects them and drives away the spirits. With the spirits gone, Ryo is able to summon his armor and blasts Dais away with Flare Up Now. The attack also destroys the castle gates. Arago promises that Ryo will fall and won't be able to defeat him. Ryo apologizes to Jun and thanks him and Násti for saving him. Násti points out that it was the staff that did it and it causes the Warriors to realize that there's someone on their side trying to help them.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = July 11, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = The group moves through the city, making their way to Arago's castle and come across an abandoned store selling skateboards and realize it is where they all met for the first time. Jun rushes off wanting to find his parents and Násti follows, but an army of Dynasty soldiers attack the Warriors. The soldiers also go after Násti and Jun along with possessed cars and it forces the Warriors to split up which Sage realizes is the Dynasty's intention: to use Násti and Jun to split the Warriors up so they're weaker. Sage, Násti and Jun escape the subway only to be confronted by Dynasty soldiers. Sage armors up and takes them out while across the city the other Warriors take out the soldiers attacking them, but they are scattered. A building is brought down forcing Sage, Jun and Násti back into the subway where they are confronted by Cale. He absorbs all the light in the subway and Sage's light power. Sage is unable to unleash his Thunder Bolt Cut for fear of hitting Násti and Jun and Cale captures him with his Black Lightning Flash. The attack drains Sage of his energy and causes his armor to disappear, but before it can kill him, Jun attacks Cale with Kháos's staff. Jun is injured by an attack from Cale, but the staff frees Sage and restores his power along with the light in the subway. Sage calls upon his armor again and blasts Cale away with his Thunder Bolt Cut and apologizes to Jun as he had always thought of Jun as a burden. However, the Warriors are still scattered across the city. Also, Kháos's staff disappears.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = July 12, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Searching through the subway for the others, Kento and Rowen reunite. Kento is skeptical at first that it is really Rowen, but Rowen makes a joke about how he found Kento by his growling stomach and he seems to be convinced. Meanwhile, Arago addresses Cale, Dais and Sekhmet and informs them that together the Ronin armors are unbeatable, but now that they're separate, they are vulnerable. He plans to use the Ronins own strengths against them and assigns Dais to the task, though he doesn't tell him the plan. In the subway, Kento is anxious to get out and find the others and suggests blasting out while Rowen cautions that their job is to protect and rebuild and not destroy. Two subway trains come at them, sending them different ways on the track to separate them again. Rowen manages to get out of the way by clinging to the ceiling, but Kento has to battle several Dynasty soldiers on his train and when it heads for a pile of rock, climbs on top to escape, but is thrown into a field. There he sees images of the Dark Warlords and Arago speaks to him. Arago reveals that the field contains the bones of every mortal that fell to the Ronin armor and that the Ronin armors and the Warlord armors have the same origin. He also reveals that the Ronin armors used to be worn by men that used them to conquer and that while the people wearing them grow stronger the more they're used, so too grows the bloodlust. Arago believes that it will eventually bring the Warriors over to his side and that they will help him conquer everything. The other Warriors attack Kento and he defeats them, but it is revealed to be all just one of Dais' illusions. He and Arago try to convince Kento to join them, telling him that the armor contains evil and that its bloodthirsty nature will eventually overwhelm him and cause him to turn. Dais and Arago claim that Kento's armor was always the most blood-thirsty of the group and thus he will be the first to turn. Dais sends an illusion of an army at Kento and while he realizes what it is, he feels the urge to kill. Kento armors up and battles Dais and when he grows angry, the armor seems to take control of him somewhat. After taunting Kento by attacking him in the guise of his friends, Dais causes Kento to hit him with Iron Rock Crusher. The attack shatters the illusion and blasts Dais away, but also causes destruction in the city, attracting Rowen to Kento's position. Arago speaks to Kento, telling him to look at the destruction he caused and saying he proved that all Kento will cause is destruction and that he will soon join his side. Rowen and Kento reunite, but Kento now has doubts about the nature of his and the other Ronins armor and what will happen. Arago congratulates Dais and tells him his plan is not over yet and that Anubis will handle the next part. Dais doesn't believe Anubis worthy, but Arago assures him that Anubis has changed.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = July 13, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = As Anubis showed weakness when he battled Ryo and Rowen last, Arago has the Nether Spirits fortify the evil in his heart. Anubis protests at first, but after the spirits powers take effect, he breaks free of his binds and is sent by Arago to enact the next phase of his plan. At an amusement park, while Jun heads off with White Blaze to play, Dynasty soldiers attack. Sage battles them and is nearly beaten, but is saved by Ryo and Cye. Together they defeat the Dynasty soldiers in the park and in a subway and decide that following the subway might lead them to Arago's castle. Rowen and Kento arrive having followed the sounds of battle, but Kento displays doubts about his future when they refer to the soldiers as \"Dynasty twerps\" wondering if he'll become a \"Dynasty twerp\" too when his armor turns him evil. Anubis arrives, his eyes glowing red occasionally and proves to be more powerful than ever. The Warriors except for Kento armor up, with Kento's own doubts combined with Anubis being human increasing his fear of what he could become. At the insistence of the others, Kento tries to power up, but fails due to his fears about his armor. Kento explains what happened to the others and his fears that if he uses the armor he will become like the Dark Warlords. As a result, Kento refuses to fight with his armor and without it, the other Warriors are weakened and no match for Anubis. Arago is pleased as without Kento the Warriors will be easy for Anubis, who the Nether Spirits are keeping in control, to defeat. Anubis proves too powerful for the Warriors and defeats them with his Quake With Fear. Kháos appears nearby and tells the Warriors to trust their armor, that it responds to what's in their hearts. Anubis goes to finish Ryo, but Jun and White Blaze try to stop him. Anubis easily throws them aside, injuring them, but Jun's courage causes Kento to summon his armor, saying that Jun taught him what real courage is. Anubis tries to attack again with Quake With Fear, but Kento hits him with Iron Rock Crusher. Not only does Kento's attack knock Anubis out, but it drives the spirits influence from his body. However, it leaves the Warriors wondering what does it mean for them that a human is wearing evil armor. Arago tries to pull Anubis back to his castle, but Kháos intervenes and pulls Anubis to him instead. Arago is furious while the Warriors realize that Kháos has arrived to help them which he confirms.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = July 14, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = The Ronin Warriors, Jun and Násti meet with Kháos in a park. Kháos commends the Ronin Warriors for all of the good they have done so far and Násti for helping to bring the Warriors together. Kháos confirms that the Ronin and Warlord armors do share the same origin and that they can be bent to either good or evil. According to Kháos, Arago knows that the armors can be used to destroy him and will be working to bend the Warriors armors to evil and Arago can bend the Ronin armor to his will if goodness isn't in the Ronins hearts and souls. Anubis awakens and Kháos stops the Warriors from attacking him so he can talk to him and try to convince him to change sides. By this point, Anubis has seen enough that he understands that Arago is only using him for his armor and Kháos explains that the nine armors were once all one and are formed out of human emotions. Anubis' virtue is Loyalty which means he is loyal to whoever is his master, but Kháos points out that Anubis can choose his own master. Kháos walks away after telling Anubis to no longer be controlled by Arago (which he has been for over a thousand years) and to pick his own path and follow it. Realizing Anubis is lost to him, Arago sends all three Dark Warlords to attack Anubis and retrieve his armor. By the time they arrive, Anubis has come to the conclusion that Kháos is right and fights back against them but is easily defeated. However, before the Warlords can take Anubis to Arago, the Ronin Warriors attack and engage them in battle. The Warriors hold off the Warlords, but Arago blinds them temporarily with a bolt of energy, allowing the Warlords to escape with Anubis. The Warriors are more determined than ever to attack Arago's castle and defeat him and Kháos agrees to become the bridge to the castle, but worries about the power of the Dark Side within. In the castle, Anubis is brought before Arago and tries to no avail to convince the other Warlords of the truth and is thrown in the dungeon. The Warlords ask for the power of the Dark Side to make them stronger so they can defeat the Warriors, but Arago reveals the source is pure evil and demands they prove themselves ready for the power. As the Warriors discuss the upcoming attack on the castle and Ryo's fears about what Kháos told them about their armor, Kháos summons Arago and does battle with him. Kháos is no match for Arago and is killed, but as his last act he summons a bridge to Arago's castle from himself. The Warriors hear the commotion and are saddened when they realize Kháos's sacrifice, but prepare themselves to make use of it to finally assault Arago's castle. At the same time, Arago is aware of what Kháos planned and is amused, planning to let the Warriors in; confident in his coming victory.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = July 17, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = The Ronin Warriors, leaving behind Násti, Jun and White Blaze who wish them good luck, enter Kháos's bridge. Arago sends the Nether Spirits to destroy the bridge and the Warriors and collect their armor and they nearly succeed, but the spirit of Kháos is able to channel the bridge's energy and destroy the spirits. Upon arrival at the castle, the Warriors are attacked by Dynasty soldiers and after fighting for a while, summon their armor and Rowen destroys them with Arrow Shockwave. However, when Ryo tries to use Flare Up Now against the castle, it just rebounds on him. Arago then sends the Dark Warlords, now with increased power from the Nether Spirits to attack the Warriors. Their attacks easily overpower the Warriors and the Warlords warn them not to go on or face destruction, but the Warriors decide to push on anyway. Entering the castle, they end up separated and Sage is confronted by Cale, Ryo and Cye by Sekhmet and Rowen and Kento by Dais. Cye and Kento go up against Sekhmet and Dais one on one to allow Ryo and Rowen to go confront Arago and the two meet up and finally confront Arago face to face and demand answers. Arago explains that as his Nether World grows bigger he needs the Earth as his world feeds off the anger and hatred in humans. He explains that just with the humans from Toyama he is able to create an unending army of Nether Spirits and Dynasty soldiers to take over the world. Ryo and Rowen attack Arago to no avail with both of their attacks being deflected back at them and Ryo even getting blown outside the castle. Meanwhile, as the other Ronin fight their opponents, Anubis, still trapped in the castle dungeon, tells them to hold on as he will help them thanks to Kháos freeing him from Arago's evil.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = July 18, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Ryo falls to a ledge and is nearly killed by Sekhmet but is saved by Cye.

Meanwhile, Násti and Jun become determined to help the Ronin Warriors and ride White Blaze through the bridge to the castle where they dodge Dynasty attacks. Arago watches as the Warriors fight with some success against the Warlords and realizes that their armor grows stronger the more they battle and he needs that for himself. When the Warriors manage to get past the Warlords, Arago calls them off and demands the Warlords give their armor to him. They agree and Arago absorbs the Warlords and starts building a physical body for himself. Násti, Jun and White Blaze find Ryo in a lot of pain and come under attack by a Dynasty army but are saved by Rowen and Cye and Rowen destroys most of the army with Arrow Shockwave. The Ronins then destroy much of the rest and form an energy pyramid that destroys the rest. Arago reveals that the source of the armor is that it originally belonged to him before Kháos stole it and tried to hide it from him and attacks with his hand, injuring Ryo and causing his armor to disappear and absorbing Rowen, Cye and Kento. Meanwhile, Anubis escapes from his prison to help. Násti and Jun are captured by more Dynasty soldiers while White Blaze is surrounded, but Anubis saves them. His presence causes the remaining Ronin virtues to activate and Ryo is healed. Sage attacks Arago to no avail and his sword is destroyed and he is absorbed. Ryo summons his armor and attacks Arago together with Anubis, but to no avail and Anubis is absorbed leaving Arago having absorbed eight of the nine armors and Ryo alone to face him.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = July 19, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Arago faces Ryo, taunting him about having absorbed his friends. This causes Násti to lose hope, but not Jun. Ryo attacks Arago to no avail with not even Flare Up Now doing anything. Arago grabs Ryo and explains that having absorbed eight armors he is too powerful for Ryo to harm. However, before he can harm or absorb Ryo, the other Warriors (who are still alive inside Arago) fight back and manage to force Arago to let Ryo go. Ryo becomes determined to find someway to free his friends and kill Arago, but is unsure how while Arago grows stronger by feeding off the fear and suffering of the people he has captured which gives Násti and Jun hope as that means that Jun's parents and the other people Arago has captured are still alive. Arago chases Ryo who is reluctant to destroy him as doing so will kill the other Ronin Warriors, and knowing all his normal attacks wouldn't cause any harm either way. Ryo is nearly absorbed by Arago, but White Blaze saves him and they fight Arago who forces the other Ronin Warriors to use their attacks against Ryo. Arago prepares to absorb Ryo, but the other Ronins take control of him and urge Ryo to use the opportunity to destroy Arago; but he refuses, as he will kill them doing it and not even sure if his attacks could even hurt Arago with his current level of power. Arago regains control and draws Ryo to him in order to absorb him.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = July 20, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = As Arago pulls Ryo to him, Ryo gives up hope despite Jun's pleas. However, the spirit of Kháos appears to him to show him how Arago tried to take over the world in the past. Kháos shows Ryo how he defeated Arago and killed him, but Arago swore that with his armor he would return one day and returned to the Nether World as a soul. Kháos, knowing that with Arago's armor still intact this is still possible and unable to destroy it, splits the armor into the five Ronin and four Warlord armors to diffuse Arago's armor's power. The nine armors are thus linked, but according to Kháos, not necessarily to Arago's evil. While all of the armors are made up of the parts of the human spirit, the Ronins are linked to the purest parts of it while the other armors are more easily corruptible and eventually returned to Arago's side. Kháos explains that while the armors can be used for either good or evil, it is the wearer's soul that determines which side that armor is on. Unfortunately, after Kháos explains all of this, Ryo is absorbed by Arago who sends out a blast of energy that causes destruction in the city below. Inside Arago, Ryo watches as the spirit of Kháos apologizes to the Warriors for involving them in the battle against Arago who appears and tries to make Ryo despair by claiming his friends now hate and feel betrayed by him. Ryo refuses to give into despair and calls upon his friends to help him fight once more. Ryo emerges from Arago and absorbs the power of the other four armors to form a new armor, the Inferno Armor. With the Inferno, Ryo is more than a match for Arago and blasts him with Flare Up Now, destroying him and his castle and releasing the other Ronin Warriors. The Warriors float safely to the ground while Násti, Jun and White Blaze escape through Kháos's bridge and the group stands on a rooftop and looks out at the now freed city, the threat over.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = July 21, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Ryo is attacked and killed by Arago, but is relieved when he wakes up and realizes that it was just a nightmare. He watches as Cye and Kento practice their moves while they rest at a house on a lakeside. Meanwhile, Sage and Rowen visit the city where everything has returned to normal with no one but them remembering what happened during Arago's reign of terror. Despite the peace, the Ronin Warriors worry about threats from other parts of the Dynasty than just the now-dead Arago and about Ryo's new armor. At the gates to the Nether World, a new threat, Saranbo appears, announcing his intention to destroy the world and steal the Ronin armors for himself to become invincible. Ryo finds Násti researching his armor and she explains that her grandfather was aware of the armors special powers and that the white armor he had summoned is called the Inferno armor. However, she is worried about Ryo as it takes a lot out of him to use and she believes he should rest. Ryo feels fine after sleeping a lot and believes he is okay now. After having stopped to get a drink, a gate to the Nether World appears in front of Rowen and Sage and Saranbo arrives to attack them. Saranbo proves to be more than a match for them and demands to know which of them holds the Inferno armor and leaves after blasting them and discovering that neither holds it. They inform Cye, Kento and Násti about this but don't tell Ryo as he is still exhausted from his fight with Arago and needs more time to recover. Deciding to keep it from Ryo and protect him, they lure Saranbo into a trap, but he is unscathed by even the combined power of Arrow Shockwave and Thunder Bolt Cut and easily defeats them. Upon learning that none of them possess the armor, he goes in search of Ryo leaving the others captured. Saranbo finds Ryo and tells him he has captured his friends and demands he find them. Ryo and White Blaze head out in search of the others and upon finding them, come under attack by Saranbo. Ryo loses until the Inferno Armor forms around him and he blasts Saranbo with Flare Up Now, apparently destroying him. However, Saranbo survives and is pleased to learn that he was right that Ryo is the wielder of the Inferno armor. After the battle, Násti arrives to find Ryo who returns to his normal Wildfire armor and collapses.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = July 24, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Saranbo meets with the Dynasty soldiers to plan his next move in gaining the Inferno armor.

Still feeling guilty over the others getting hurt last time, Ryo heads out to confront Saranbo alone at a pier but he passes Jun on the way and Jun goes to Násti's house and lets the others know what he saw and they realize what it means. At the pier, Ryo summons his armor and confronts Saranbo alone. Saranbo easily beats Ryo and starts draining him of his armor, but White Blaze saves him. However, Saranbo quickly defeats White Blaze, but the attack allows Ryo to get up and fire Flare Up Now at Saranbo who returns with Wave of Destruction. Saranbo's attack overpowers Ryo's and Ryo is blasted into the water. White Blaze cries out for help and Jun, looking for Ryo with the others, hears him.

Jun plays with White Blaze, pretending to be a Ronin Warrior and goes to Násti's where the others are gathered examining Ryo's damaged swords. Násti explains that the swords couldn't handle the intensity of the Inferno armor and continuing to use it as Ryo did could result in it failing him. Ryo is upset that he can't trust his own swords and Jun suggests finding him a new one, causing Násti to come up with the idea that maybe there is another sword meant to work with the Inferno armor which she looks through her grandfather's data for. Násti finds a special pair of swords meant for the original wearer of the Inferno armor called the Soul Swords of Fervor or the Soul Swords which legend states is hidden at the base of a volcano and protected by a special divine power.

Meanwhile, Ryo, Násti and Jun try to help White Blaze recover from his serious injuries while the other Ronins decide to try to take on Lord Saber Stryke on their own, not sure they can trust Ryo in the fight. When Rowen suggests this to Ryo, he runs off followed by Jun and examines his broken swords, brooding over their destruction. Jun tries to cheer him up, but is interrupted by the arrival of Black Blaze with the Swords of Fervor and Lord Saber Stryke.

The power of the volcano successfully repairs the swords and the group heads back home, but Ryo senses the nearby presence of the warrior, though he dismisses it. On the ride home, Jun encourages Násti to race White Blaze who seems to be back to normal after being restored by Black Blaze, the power of whom he now carries inside. At home, the Warriors see a news report about the eruption of Mount Aso and the ice that now covers it and decide to investigate. On the road, the warrior appears and Ryo engages in a battle with him, but proves to be no match for him. The warrior proves to be more than a match for all of the Warriors together and nearly kills Ryo before White Blaze knocks him away, knocking off his cloak. The warrior introduces himself as Sun Devil and explains that he was sent by his master to test their armors limits, but refuses to identify that master. Sun Devil splits into five copies which easily overpower the Warriors, but White Blaze attacks the one fighting Ryo and transforms into Black Blaze who has become a part of him ever since he saved White Blaze.

He creates an evil clone of Cye with the same armor, but red and more powerful. This clone will be powerful enough to defeat the Warriors. Arago is worried that they will be defeated again because of their reliance on the art of fighting battles, but Sekhmet is confident that he has accounted for that problem. Meanwhile, Ryo worries about being able to control the intense power created by the combination of the Soul Swords and the Armor of Inferno while everyone else worries about it as well as the fact that the Dynasty nearly overpowered them with its evil. That night, Ryo dreams that he tests his strength by using Flare Up Now to cut a massive boulder in half which works, but Kháos's spirit appears to tell him that strength alone isn't enough to defeat Arago and the forces of evil, he must also fight the battle with his heart. He then appears in the dreams of all the other Warriors to give them advice and the next day, Kento believes that they need to find their center to find the balance Kháos was talking about and they take off to do so. Cye travels to the ocean, but is attacked by Dynasty soldiers. After defeating them, he comes face to face with his evil clone, Red Torrent and proves to be no match for him, forced to take the battle out of the water due to Red Torrent possessing Sekhmet's poison which starts affecting the ocean and being overpowered by Red Torrent's Super Wave Smasher when they fire at each other. Kháos's spirit appears again and tells Cye to ignore the turmoil and strength of his foe and find the peace in the battle. Cye realizes this is like how a whale let a powerful current carry him. Kháos tells him not to fight, but to swim into the stream of its nature and Cye clears his mind and searches for a solution. Red Torrent shoots his poisonous Super Wave Smasher and Cye decides to absorb the attack and use his armor to purify the water. The effort works and Cye, his power strengthened, blasts Red Torrent with his own Super Wave Smasher, destroying Red Torrent.

In order to do so, Sage returns to the caves at the Catasota Gulch Pinnacles where the Armor of Halo was created and the source of its power. At the Pinnacles, Sage saves a deer from a pack of wolves who run away when he starts glowing. The deer and its herd, also fearing Sage, run away from him. Meanwhile, Arago summons Cale and sends him to go after Sage to try to turn him to the side of evil, believing that once the Ronin Warriors see their true power, they will switch sides. Cale approaches Sage and explains that the wolves and the deer ran from him because they sensed the evil of his armor and fear it. Cale claims that the armors purpose is to bring destruction to the world and attacks. Cale battles Sage, trying to convince him of the armors evil power and for Sage to turn to evil, telling him that the armor makes him continually fight and destroy. Fearing this might be true, Sage powers down his armor and runs, hiding in a waterfall and meditating. In order to show Sage how cold and dark the heart of a Dynasty warlord is, Cale covers everything, including all living creatures in ice and snow, freezing Sage in the waterfall and tries to convince him to help destroy the world. In an attempt to drive Sage to evil, Cale revives and controls five deer and makes them attack Sage, trying to force him to kill them and drive him further from good, but when it fails, Cale kills them again. Sage summons his armor to fight Cale again, understanding that while his strength may come from the Dynasty, he still controls it with his mind. Sage unleashes the Thunder Bolt Cut, defeating Cale, but blasting off the top of the caves. Cale tells Sage he has now become a Dynasty warrior before collapsing and not wanting to give into the evil in the armor, Sage separates it from him and cuts it in half with his sword. However, his sword channels the power of his own spirit and repairs the armor and realizing that this is not an evil power, Sage regains faith in his mind, skill and spirit to overcome evil. This causes life to be restored to the land. However, this leaves Sage vulnerable and Arago opens a gate to the Nether Realm and captures Sage and the Armor of Halo.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = August 1, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Having already captured Cye and Sage, Arago decides to send Dais to capture another Ronin and Dais picks Kento. Dais reveals that he has a plan that Kento's brute strength will be no match against and asks for the help of the Twin Sand Strikers which Arago agrees to as Dais has served him well in the past. As Kento dozes as he makes his journey, he remembers what Kháos's spirit told him in his dream: that while he is the strongest among the Ronin Warriors, one great force cannot ruin another and that he must use the spirit of the armor to push his way through the \"sands of deception\", telling him to know them and to \"see what is not there.\" At a construction site, Kento is confronted by Dais who he is shocked to see alive and is attacked by the Sand Strikers. Dais claims the Dynasty is unstoppable and while the Sand Strikers hold Kento down, sends a wrecking ball at him. Kento dodges and battles the Sand Strikers, apparently destroying them with the wrecking ball, but they survive and bring part of a building down on top of him. However, Dais prevents them from killing Kento, telling them he wants Kento to suffer and telling Kento to continue his quest, that he'll be waiting for him. The three then travel to a forest which they petrify to await Kento's arrival. Kento arrives and battles Dais, unleashing Iron Rock Crusher twice and causing the area to turn into a desert. Dais reminds Kento how he once revealed to him that the stronger he gets the stronger the hold of evil on him and tells him that the world will end up just like it if he insists on fighting. Kento battles the Sand Strikers again, but when he unleashes Iron Rock Crusher once more, they simply absorb the power and easily beat him and Dais leaves to tell Arago of his victory. Kento wakes up and to confuse him, the Sand Strikers dash around so fast that it appears there are many of them. Remembering what Kháos told him, Kento taps into the spirit of the armor which he realizes is a part of the natural energy flowing through the Earth and is able to see where the Sand Strikers really are. Using this, Kento unleashes Iron Rock Crusher again and destroys the Sand Strikers. Kento finally understands that in order to use all of his armor's strength, he must focus all of its power. Dais shows up again and attacks, but after he reveals that Cye and Sage have been captured, Kento willingly follows him to the Nether Realm in an effort to rescue them.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = August 2, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Rowen practices his now-maximized powers by using Arrow Shockwave to successfully blast away storm clouds, but is blasted by an unseen force and pulled into the clouds where he is confronted by a beautiful girl named Lady Kayura.

Kháos travels to a waterfall where it is revealed that he's not actually Kháos, but someone who has taken on his role and his way of doing things. Ryo is determined to get into the Nether Realm and rescue his friends and despite Násti and Rowen's warnings that it is a trap, he is insistent so Rowen decides to join him in trying. Lady Kayura reports on the fake Kháos to Arago and her belief that it is merely someone who is able to wield his staff, but Arago tells her to ignore him and focus on capturing Ryo and Rowen which she has a plan for.

Anubis convinces them of his sincerity and accepting him as a friend, they invite him to stay with them. Anubis explains to them how four hundred years ago he was a warrior that had become extremely power-hungry and bloodthirsty which caused him to join Arago, but Kháos showed him that that wasn't a good thing and that Arago wasn't his destiny as he thought. He now realizes that his destiny is to stop Arago. Anubis senses the presence of Dais and forces him to show himself. Dais claims that all of the Ronin Warriors have been captured by Arago, but Anubis points out that Ryo and Rowen are still free. Dais explains that they are merely being toyed with by Arago and attacks Anubis who easily defeats him, knocking his helmet off and revealing his face to Jun and Násti. Anubis refuses to kill him, saying that Dais' armor protects him and tries to convince Dais that the armor's power doesn't come from Arago like he believes but that Arago wants it for himself before he, Jun and Násti leave.

Arago summons Badamon, Lord of the Nether Spirits to explain the story behind the Inferno. Badamon explains that it came to be when the world was plagued by evil a long time ago. The five Ronin armors combined together to form the Inferno and it was worn by the first Ronin Warrior, Hariel. Ryo and Rowen continue battling Dala who taunts them about the fact that Ryo refuses to summon the Inferno to fight because it might drain their friends of the last of their energy and kill them. Badamon continues his explanation, telling the Warlords that the Inferno defeated the evil force plaguing the world long ago and that what they have seen is just the beginning of the Inferno's power, that nothing can stop it and even he doesn't know the full power of the Inferno, but that it is rumored that at full power it could destroy the world and leave behind a void. Arago explains that he wants to conquer the armor for just that purpose, to build a new world under his control. Badamon plans to be the one to control the armor which he claims he can do with just a bit more time. Rowen rides off on a horse, leaving Ryo to battle Dala on his own, telling him to summon the Inferno. Ryo refuses to take that risk and continues to battle Dala on his power alone, trying and failing to use Flare Up Now on Dala. With the power of the three armors in his sword, Dala is able to use Cye, Kento and Sage's attacks against Ryo, blasting him down. Badamon explains to the Warlords that he and his spirits can control the Inferno Armor where the Warlords would be destroyed and he has take control of the armor. Rowen blasts the roof off of the other Ronin Warriors prison with his Arrow Shockwave as a signal and they send their armor power to Ryo who forms the Inferno. Ryo destroys Dala and his sword with Rage of Inferno and in his normal armor, helps Rowen defeat the Dynasty soldiers he is fighting. The two then continue their journey while Badamon and his Nether Spirits prepare for their efforts to take over the Inferno Armor.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = August 8, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Badamon harnesses the power of the Nether Spirits to observe events if the past where Ryo summoned the Armor of Inferno in order to find an alternate means to summon it without the five main armors and also to come up with a plan to control it, taking notice of how the armor was activated solely with one of the four and Kaos' staff. Meanwhile, Ryo and Rowen try to make their way through a maze to Arago's castle. Badamon reports to Arago a plan to summon the Inferno armor and take control of it: Transfer the power of the three Dark Warlords armors to Ryo which would then overwhelm him then make him summon the Inferno. As he would be under the influence of the evil armors, he would then do what they want. Arago agrees, but tells Badamon not to tell the Dark Warlords which he agrees with as they may a risk of the three betraying them if they realize they are being used. With that in mind, Badamon requests for Lady Kayura's aid and gives her a magic sand (called \"Kousa\") he created that will allow her to control Ryo. Ryo and Rowen try to make their way to Arago's castle undetected, but are found and blocked in and the Dark Warlords and some Dynasty soldiers are sent to confront them. They defeat the soldiers and escape, but are confronted by Lady Kayrua who uses the sand on the three Warlords, Ryo, Rowen and White Blaze and forces Ryo to summon the Inferno armor using the power of Rowen and the Dark Warlords armors with the Nether Spirits and the sand to control him. However, instead of the Inferno being controlled by the Dark Warlords armors, it works in reverse; controlling them and making them attack Lady Kayura. However, they are no match for her and she easily defeats them since their powers were given to Ryo. She wakes Ryo, but he drives the Nether Spirits and sand's influence from his body and battles Lady Kayura. Ryo uses Rage of Inferno while Lady Kayura uses Star Sword Scream, but Ryo destroys her sword with his attack as well as the nearby area and she retreats. However, Arago is pleased as the Inferno Armor holds powers that even he was unaware of. Ryo reunites with Rowen and White Blaze to continue their quest.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = August 9, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = The clash between Ryo with the Inferno Armor and Lady Kayura was so powerful that it creates destruction in the mortal world as well as the Nether World. Ryo, exhausted and in pain from the battle and Rowen rest and discuss how Ryo didn't feel any different after absorbing the power of the Dark Warlords. This leads Rowen to theorize that perhaps they aren't all bad as they protected Ryo briefly from Lady Kayura. While Lady Kayura lost against Ryo, Arago is still pleased with her as the Armor of Inferno was proven to have the power to destroy the mortal world like Arago wants. Jun, Násti and Anubis look through Násti's grandfather's data, looking for anything they can use against the Dynasty and Anubis spots a symbol that Arago uses and becomes determined to find out what it is as it may be important. Násti discovers that the symbol stands for the Jewel of Life, an object capable of destroying Arago which was hidden by the very first Ancients. After the discovery, Anubis senses something and when investigating, comes under attack from Dynasty soldiers. Anubis fights them and they alert Badamon of Násti's discovery. Badamon orders the soldiers not to let Násti, Jun and Anubis escape with the information and two soldiers lure Anubis away while another tries to kill Násti and Jun. Anubis defeats the soldiers and Násti locates the a map leading to the Jewel of Life which Anubis realizes is near water. Meanwhile, Ryo and Rowen contemplate how the Dark Warlords almost seemed to turn good and worry about their friends. Needing to stop Anubis, Násti and Jun from finding the Jewel, Badamon dispatches a Dynasty warrior named Kashura to stop them, explaining that legend says that the Jewel is the heart of the nine armors and beats strong in the heart of the pure and gives strength to the weak and thus is a threat to Arago and his empire. Násti uncovers the same thing, reading that the Jewel gives the armors their power and figuring out with Anubis that it must be in Jewel Lake. The three head there with Anubis planning to travel to the Nether World afterwards to help the Ronin Warriors, but refusing to allow Jun and Násti to come as it is too dangerous. At Jewel Lake, Anubis parts the water with Kháos's staff and is able to use the staff to open the tomb that's revealed at the bottom. In the tomb they find the armors of the Ancients that guard the tomb, murals of the battles between Hariel and evil in the past and the Jewel of Life. When Jun picks up the Jewel, Kháos speaks to them telling them that only the pure of heart can use the Jewel as in evil hands it could destroy the world. Kashura arrives with Dynasty soldiers and attacks, but the Ancient armors, possessed by the souls of their wearers, destroy the soldiers and when Kashura threatens Násti and Jun, Anubis stabs him through the back with Kháos's staff, killing him. At Kháos's request, Anubis releases the souls in the armors to move on, their job now finished and puts the Jewel around Násti's neck when Jun gives it to him, saying that Jun and Násti are the purest of heart people he knows and they will all go together to save their friends.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = August 10, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Anubis, Násti and Jun contemplate the power of the Jewel of Life and wonder how it is supposed to defeat Arago and Násti gives it to Jun to wear. Meanwhile Dynasty soldiers cause havok and destruction in the city, easily repelling all human efforts to stop them. Badamon approaches Arago with fears about allowing Ryo and Rowen free rein within the castle before a structure the Nether Spirits are building which Badamon calls the Tower of Pain is completed due to the unfathomable power of the Inferno Armor, but Arago assures him that they won't be free for long as he is drawing them into a trap. At Násti's home, Anubis contemplates the war with the Dynasty and looks for a sign from Kháos when it will be time for him to complete his own destiny when suddenly Kháos's staff and the Jewel of Life glow, causing snow. Ryo and Rowen continue to make their way through the maze, avoiding Dynasty soldiers and trying to find a way into the castle. They get sucked into a wall while trying to climb it and end up trapped in the dungeon. Upon blasting their way out of the room, they are confronted by Lady Kayura. The two fight her to no avail and she tricks Ryo into launching Flare Up Now at her then dodges, causing him to hit a structure which drains his armor of power. Rowen is unable to stop it and Ryo is completely drained while the effects are seen in the mortal world as Arago's castle flickering in and out of view, causing Anubis to say that the Dynasty is rising again. While wondering what to do, both the staff and the Jewel of Life glow again and Anubis finally understands what he has to do to help the others. As Ryo is unconscious and completely drained, Rowen holds off Lady Kayura while sending White Blaze to carry Ryo to safety. Rowen battles Lady Kayura but is no match for her, getting blasted so high into the air at one point that he nearly falls to his death before his armor saves him. At the same time, Anubis uses both the Jewel of Life and Kháos's staff to carry him, Násti and Jun to Ryo and Rowen to help them out. During his fight with Lady Kayura, Rowen spots White Blaze carry Ryo onto a barge and take off and he lands on the barge to protect them but is defeated. However, as Anubis, Násti and Jun approach, the power of the Jewel of Life causes a water spout that knocks Lady Kayura off the barge and forces her back ashore. Násti, Jun and Anubis land on the barge and reunite with exhausted Ryo and Rowen who are re-energized by the Jewel's power\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = August 11, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Off-shore, Ryo, Rowen, Násti, Jun, White Blaze and Anubis are confronted by Lady Kayura and a bunch of Dynasty soldiers and Ryo and Rowen fight them, having no luck against Lady Kayura. Meanwhile, Arago speaks with Badamon who has prepared altars for the nine armors and has been having his Nether Spirits \"purify\" the bodies of the Dark Warlords who Arago only sees as useful tools. Anubis and White Blaze successfully protect Násti and Jun from Dynasty soldiers while Ryo and Rowen battle against more soldiers and Lady Kayura with little luck. Realizing they need the other Ronin Warriors to win, Rowen sacrifices himself to buy them some more time by blasting Lady Kayura into the air and trying to fight her there, but is instead defeated and apparently killed. Ryo prepares to continue the battle with Lady Kayura, but Anubis interrupts and tells Ryo to let him handle it while Ryo goes off to rescue the other Ronin Warriors. Ryo agrees and leaves Anubis to continue the fight. Dynasty soldiers attack Násti and Jun, but the Jewel of Life protects them and kills the soldiers. Knowing that the Jewel is a mystical artifact that poses a threat to the Dynasty and not wanting to risk Násti and Jun uncovering its powers, Badamon suggests they do something about it, but Arago isn't worried, believing that the Ronins and their allies have no way of using the three mystical artifacts that could spell doom for the Dynasty: the Inferno Armor, the Soul Swords of Fervor and the Jewel. Anubis is able to hold his own against Lady Kayura with Kháos's staff protecting him, however, to his surprise, the staff will not strike down Lady Kayura for some reason. Rowen is dropped into a cavern where it is revealed he faked his death and he finds the other Ronin Warriors completely drained of power which has turned them into statues. Rowen uses the strength of his armor's power of Life in the form of his arrows to try to awaken the others before collapsing. Ryo arrives near the other Warriors and is confronted by the Dark Warlords and defeated, however, Jun, Násti and White Blaze arrive and when Jun rushes forward to help, the Jewel protects Ryo and harms the Dark Warlords, driving them off. However, Lady Kayura arrives and like the Staff of the Ancients, the Jewel has no effect on her. As it looks like it is over for Ryo, Rowen and the other Ronin Warriors appear to once again help Ryo fight the Dynasty.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = August 14, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = The reunited Ronin Warriors face down Lady Kayura and demand she leave them alone and let them face Arago, but she tells them they must face her first to face Arago. However, the Dark Warlords demand to fight them instead and when Ryo, Cye and Kento charge them, drop them through trap doors to separate them and head off to face them, leaving Sage and Rowen to face Lady Kayura. Ryo, Sage and Cye land in a pit which is filled with water, but Cye manages to find an exit which he blasts open, dropping the three into a chasm. While Ryo and Kento manage to hang onto the side of the chasm, Cye falls in and later Dais and Sekhmet knock Kento and Ryo in. Sage and Rowen battle Lady Kayura, targeting her amulet while trying to protect Jun and Násti at the same time from Dynasty soldiers when the Jewel of Life doesn't seem to be doing anything. Cale confronts Cye in the chasm, using the darkness there to his advantage as Cye can't see where he is while Cale can see him and attack. At the same time, Kento faces Dais who grows to a giant size to fight him which doesn't seem to be an illusion while Ryo faces Sekhmet who traps Ryo in a sea of acidic venom which will slowly eat away at his armor and then his body. Anubis, who is nearby, is confused when Kháos's staff glows and remembers how it wouldn't let him harm Lady Kayura and how she disappeared after it didn't. Anubis realizes that it might be a sign that Ryo is in trouble and heads off to help him while Sage and Rowen continue to protect Násti and Jun, but are outnumbered. Just in time, Anubis reaches Ryo and rescues him from the poison with the staff and drives Sekhmet away. As Kento is about to be killed by the giant Dais, Anubis causes Dais disappear using the staff and Ryo is able to convince Kento that Anubis is now on their side and they head off together. They reach Cye in time for Anubis to restore light to the area with the staff which also drives off Cale. The group quickly reunites with the others and Ryo forms the Inferno. With the Inferno, Ryo is able to block Lady Kayura's Star Sword Scream and blasts her with Rage of Inferno, breaking her amulet off her neck. Lady Kayura is left completely confused at where she is and when Ryo goes to finish her off, Anubis stops him, explaining that for some reason the staff wouldn't let him harm her. The Jewel of Life also glows and Badamon and Arago grow worried as the Ronin Warriors now control the artifact. Arago pulls the completely confused Lady Kayura back to him as the Ronin Warriors watch.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = August 15, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = The Ronin Warriors, having found a somewhat safe place, rest and practice for the upcoming fight with Arago while Anubis meditates. When they leave, Násti and Jun stay behind and Anubis decides to as well as he isn't sure of what Kháos's will for him now is. Násti, Jun and White Blaze for Warriors in Good Job. The Warriors reluctantly accept this, but warn Anubis that they won't hold back on Lady Kayura if they encounter her as she fights with Arago. Meanwhile, Lady Kayura sits in her room and flashes back on her life which she is able to do as her amulet is cracked. She remembers that she is the last remaining member of Kháos's people who has great supernatural powers as a result. Lady Kayura takes her amulet off again and resists the evil, worrying Badamon and Arago as without Lady Kayura he doesn't have the power of Kháos's clan on his side when the shrines he's building for the nine armors are complete, saying that his plan to unite the Dynasty and mortal world under his control is impossible without her help. However, Badamon proposes letting her regain her memories and then having him possess her mind and soul so she will be completely under their control, but they know they need to keep Anubis away for the plan to work so Arago sends the Dark Warlords to deal with him. The Warriors battle an army of Dynasty soldiers and armor up to deal with them, which they easily do, but are confused by the fact that no stronger enemies appear to fight like Lady Kayura or the Dark Warlords. Badamon goes to Lady Kayura and successfully possesses her to do the Dynasty will while Anubis senses that something has happened to her and realizing that she is the last of Kháos's clan, becomes determined to save her like Kháos saved him. The Dark Warlords attack and Anubis is forced to fight them briefly until he uses Kháos's staff to split the land and send them away. As the Warriors defeat the Dynasty soldiers, Lady Kayura arrives atop a Dynasty Dark Matrix and Sage and Cye's attacks have absolutely no effect against it so they form the Inferno Armor. However, the Inferno has no effect against the Matrix either and it crashes into Ryo and detonates, dispelling the Inferno and knocking the Ronin Warriors out, except for Ryo. As Lady Kayura is about to capture them, Anubis arrives to try to save her from Badamon, but is confronted by the Dark Warlords. However, the Shakujo levitates and takes the form of  his helmet from his old armor of Cruelty. Realizing that Kháos's will is that he fight in his armor again, he puts the helmet on and dons his old armor and launches Quake With Fear at Lady Kayura.\n| LineColor           = FF5F5F\n}}\n| AltDate             = August 16, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Anubis launches Quake With Fear at Lady Kayura and the Dark Warlords, tying them up and tries to reach the real Lady Kayura, however Badamon, controlling Lady Kayura, tells him that his hold on her is unbreakable and breaks free of the chains and charges at Anubis. Meanwhile, Nether Spirits arrives on barges with one each coming from one of nine nearby towers and each take one of the Ronin Warriors to one of the towers. The possessed Lady Kayura tries to convince Anubis to surrender while Anubis tries to convince the Dark Warlords that they are just being used which Lady Kayura proves by trapping them in spheres of energy. Badamon explains that the nine armors forever link the mortal realm and the Nether World which has always been the Warlords purpose. Násti confirms this, saying that there is an old legend that mentions nine keys which she realizes means the nine armors and warns that the whole world could possibly be destroyed as a result of this. Lady Kayura sends the Warlords up to more barges and battles Anubis whose Quake With Fear has little effect on her. Lady Kayura defeats Anubis and captures him too then goes after Jun and the Jewel of Life. Arago cheers his victory in capturing the nine armors and how he will use them to complete his plan. Lady Kayura chases Jun, Násti, and White Blaze; nearly getting the Jewel of Life before White Blaze retrieves it from her. Násti realizes that the Jewel still has the power to defeat Arago which is why she wants it so badly and confirming this, she attacks again. Meanwhile, Anubis prays to Kháos for strength and manages to break Badamon's spell freezing him and sends his armor from his body, causing Kháos's staff to reappear and drive away the Nether Spirits holding him prisoner. Anubis saves Násti as Lady Kayura is about to kill her and summons his armor again. Lady Kayura attacks him with Star Sword Scream which he absorbs then launches Quake With Fear which is charged with the energy of Lady Kayura's attack at her. Anubis then jumps up and holds Lady Kayura in place as the attack strikes, fatally wounding him and he sends his armor to Lady Kayura. The combination of the attack and the armor drives Badamon from Lady Kayura's body, finally freeing her from the influence of evil and Anubis collapses into a river, dead, but pleased that he has succeeded. Arago is furious with Badamon for his failure and tells him to prepare to use the remaining armor to open a gateway to the mortal world. However, Badamon warns that if they miss the opportunity caused by the eclipse of the sun in the mortal world, not even the power of the armors will be enough to try again. Lady Kayura leads Násti, Jun and White Blaze to a barge that will lead them to safety and Násti explains to her what has occurred. Lady Kayura becomes determines to fight Arago as Anubis wanted her to and informs Jun that the Jewel of Life holds great power the secret to defeating the Dynasty. Determined to save his friends, Jun has White Blaze carry him to Ryo and tries to use the Jewel to free him, but fails until a bunch of Dynasty soldiers attack.

Ryo, Kento and Cye reunite and head off to find Arago while Násti, Jun, White Blaze, Rowen and Sage meet up as well. The Dark Warlords completely reject Arago and are joined by Ryo, Kento and Cye, but Arago warns them that once the sun is completely dark, the mortal world will absorbed by the Nether Realm and he will be completely victorious. Badamon and the Nether Spirits, rejoicing in this, fly through the gateway to the mortal world. Ryo tries Flare Up Now on Arago, but he just jumps in the river and puts out the flames and climbs a tower. Lady Kayura warns Ryo to be careful as the tower is filled with the essence of pain and is behind the Dynasty's evil power and it could turn Ryo evil like she once was. Arago transports the tower and himself into the mortal world where its influence brings out the worst in humanity and makes people turn on each other. Everyone travels back to the mortal world to continue the fight and the Ronin Warriors combine their armors upon Ryo once more to form the Inferno Armor and he unleashes a column of flame that destroys Badamon. Násti, Jun and Black Blaze arrive with the Soul Swords and using them, Ryo battles Arago and unleashes the Rage of Inferno, but Arago is able to turn the attack aside and incapacitate Ryo. Arago then tries to absorb him, but urged on by the spirit of Anubis, Ryo doesn't give up and instead projects his body and soul into Arago, holding him still so the other Warriors have a clear shot at him. Reluctantly as they might kill Ryo and all crying, the Ronin Warriors slash Arago with their weapons, fatally injuring him. Jun calls out for Ryo to be saved and the Jewel of Life sends out a beam of energy that pulls Ryo safely out of Arago as he explodes into pieces, finally destroyed while his tower and its influence as well as the Nether Realm disappear. Ryo thanks Jun for saving his life and everyone celebrates by throwing off their helmets, causing their armors to disappear.

Ryo and Sage attack Mukala with their strongest moves, but Mukala emerges from the rubble unscathed.\n| LineColor           = 00FF00\n}}\n| AltDate             = April 2, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = Mukala continues his attack on Ryo and Sage. Naria pleads with them to stop fighting, to which Ryo and Sage abide. They deduce that it is their armors that want to fight rather than themselves. Ryo refuses to fight and is then savagely beaten by Mukala. Sage saves Ryo from a fatal blow and resolves to keep fighting, but he too realizes that they have become pawns in a battle between the two Inferno Armors. He decides to stop fighting as well. Cye, still separated from the group and questioning his will to fight, is found by White Blaze. Kento, Rowen, Mia and Ully travel to Nairobi, Tanzania to find Ryo and Sage. They decide to decipher the conflict between the two armors rather leaving it as a contest of strength. As they attempt to locate the Taulagi village, they are attacked by the tribe. Kento and Ully become separated from Rowen and Mia, but spot Naria and follow her to Ryo and Sage's location. Rowen and Mia discover engravings in a cave, which speaks of The Tree of Life, whose evil light will inspire the people and save them from all that threaten their lives. The Tree of Life forms the entrance to their valley, while all is underneath the Black Inferno Armor. Kento attempts to rescue Ryo and Sage but is intercepted by Mukala. Kento's armor then flashes a darker color as he attempts to battle Mukala, which Ully notices as appearing more evil. Mia reads on the cave walls that if the Black and White Inferno Armors, which were both born in the valley, were to ever meet, that it would release an energy that would be too much for the universe to bear. Rowen's armor unlocks a power within the crystals around them which causes the lightning to strike The Tree of Life. More dark crystals arise, which Mukala uses to don the Black Inferno Armor. Rowen then arrives and tells Kento to stop fighting, telling them that another person's will is manipulating all of them into a dishonest fight. Naria tells Mukala that the armor has been influencing him negatively. Kento and Rowen attempt to attack Mukala, but both notice that it is their armor's will that is forcing them to fight rather than their own. Both then free themselves from their armor, to which Mia notices that there is a split between their armors as well as their own virtues that represent the forces of good. Back in Japan, Cye then retrieves his Armor of Torrent, saying he will wear it again to save his friends, but also to test whether his will is stronger than that of his armor.\n| LineColor           = 00FF00\n}}\n| AltDate             = April 2, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = Naria, Mia and Ully attempt to find ingredients to make medicine for the ailing Ronin Warriors. Mia again reiterates her belief that it was their armors that forced them to fight, rather than the Ronin Warriors themselves. Cye soon finds the group and uses his virtue to restore Ryo, Sage, Rowen, and Kento back to health. They notice the virtue has disappeared from his armor, noticing it must be removing themselves during this conflict. Naria explains the history of the armor and their tribe: the Black Inferno Armor appeared in the Valley of the Black Crystal, and that the Talaugi were worshiped because of this. The Black Inferno Armor was always worn by their tribe and protected them from outside influence, but one day it showed that it could move on its own power and revealed a darker side. When Mukala discovered there was another Inferno Armor, the Black Inferno Armor ordered that it find and fight it, to which Mukala obeyed. Naria is dismayed that Mukala has become overpowered by the Black Inferno Armor. Black Blaze soon separates himself from White Blaze, which then separates Cye from the Armor of Torrent, which moves on its own accord. The Ronin Warriors then decide to destroy both Inferno Armors, saying that the armors without virtue become sinister forces. Naria pleads with Mukala to end the conflict, but to no avail. White Blaze is soon attacked by the tribe, which then capture Mia, Ully and Naria. Black Blaze gives the Armor of Torrent to Mukala, who summons the other armors to create the Inferno Armor. The Ronin Warriors soon find Mukala, and though he attacks them, they state that they do not wish to fight him but rather want to confront the Inferno Armor. The two Inferno Armors manipulate the sun and moon, which creates a lunar eclipse that darkens the land. The Ronin Warriors see visions of the end of the world that would result from the two armors' lust for battle. They resolve to let their virtues win, and summon their own armor to battle the Inferno Armor, which is now acting on its own will. Despite being initially unable to cause any damage, the five decide to fight with their spirits as one, attacking the Inferno Armor with the power of their virtues. This defeats the evil spirit residing within, and Ryo is able to don the Inferno Armor once again. Ryo then commences battle with Mukala, who has donned the Black Inferno Armor. Ryo again pleads with Mukala to end the battle, saying that an armor that has abandoned its spirit can only bring death. While the two continue to fight, their attacks bring shockwaves onto the landscape; Naria and White Blaze are soon caught in the crossfire and are dealt fatal blows. Mukala, mortified, surveys the damage; the Ronin Warriors use the opportunity attack him with their virtues to let him see the true nature of the human spirit. The attack succeeds. The eclipse soon clears, and the armors then disappear, but not before reviving Naria and White Blaze. Mukala then approaches Naria and warmly calls her by her name, as Ryo, Rowen, Cye, Kento, Sage, Mia, Ully and White Blaze look on.\n| LineColor           = 00FF00\n}}\n}}\nRonin Warriors: Message\n|title=\n|director=\n|writer=\n|aux2=\n|aux2T=Storyboard by\n|airdate=\n|altdate=\n|altdateT=English air date\n|episodes=\n| AltDate             = June 3, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = Rowen runs through the city, wondering if he is being called to fight again. He is unsure who is calling upon them, as he feels his days of fighting should be behind him. A mysterious being known as Suzunagi soon covers the city with light beams, and attacks Rowen. Rowen is able to deflect her attacks, confirming Suzunagi's suspicions that though they are no longer Ronin Warriors, they still have enhanced abilities. She tells Rowen that they will continue to be Ronin Warriors until they die, that she feels sorry for them and that they should curse the Ancient One for giving them their armors in the first place. A flashback shows the origins of the Armor of Strata: The Ancient One uncovers a box containing it, being relieved that it has not found its true master. He says that due to the impending evil that it is time to be called upon again. As he unlocks the Armor of Strata, he is met by a young Suzunagi, imploring him not to release the armor as it would ignite the fires of war. The Ancient One notices the girl is filled with bitterness of the past, and commands the Armor of Strata to release her from her anger. The young Suzunagi is able to evade the attack. In the present day, Rowen tells Suzunagi to relieve her hatred against the armors, and resolves to find the source behind her anger in order to put her at peace. Rowen uncovers Suzunagi's drawings of the armors, but notices that they are of different designs. He is then given a vision of Suzunagi proclaiming a hatred of the armors, as well as an attempt destroy them. Suzunagi tells Rowen that the sadness she felt as a child has evolved into hatred, and orders Rowen to kill her. Rowen refuses to harm her until he discovers why she hates the armors. Suzunagi then states that Rowen will be judged, and summons the Armor of Strata on Rowen's behalf. The episode ends with Rowen sitting in a new Armor of Strata, but he is immobile.\n| LineColor           = 00416A\n}}\n| AltDate             = June 3, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = As Suzunagi looks upon the immobile Rowen, she mentions that he is the \"first.\" Cye receives a dream of the armors as well as a distressed Rowen, who calls for help. Ryo, Sage, Cye and Kento reunite, and all mention that they had the same dream. Ryo opens a package from Rowen, which consist of a book of the Edo period called \"The Legend of the Five Warriors.\" It is a stage play about the Ronin Warriors and their battle against Talpa, but was written back in the 19th Century before it became reality. Rowen's package contains a letter stating that though the five have not seen each other as often since the armors disappeared, he believes they are being called again and will investigate. Ryo expresses disbelief that the play contains all of their battles, feeling as though they are puppets on a cardboard stage. Cye laments the idea that they are being drawn into battle again, wondering if this will define his life. He soon receives visions of dynasty soldiers attacking the city, but also of himself, wearing in the Armor of Torrent, being embraced and protected by Suzunagi. Cye rushes towards Suzunagi and asks what is going on, but Suzunagi tells him to stay away, and that it is her destiny to protect his future. A vision appears of Cye and his armor being auctioned, with the auctioneer stating that though Cye has lost his will to fight, he has still chosen the battlefield. Cye wonders why he made this decision, but Suzunagi tells him that it is due to his nature as a warrior. Suzunagi tells Cye that she can see all, and that she knows his future. She feels the need to protect him due to his virtue of kindness, as well as his decision to choose the armor. Cye says the armor will be a part of him forever, as well as fighting and violence. He asks Suzunagi why he needs to be protected, and she tells him that she must give up her life to protect his spirit, and to remain true to himself. Cye then receives a vision of Suzunagi being bound and captured, and attempts to rescue her. He asks Suzunagi if this is the future she foresaw, and refuses to let it happen by summoning his armor. A new Armor of Torrent appears, and a tear forms in its eye. Suzunagi then mentions that this is now \"two.\"\n| LineColor           = 00416A\n}}\n| AltDate             = June 3, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = Kento mentions to Sage that he is ready for a fight. Sage tells him that Rowen and Cye are missing, and that he could be next. Sage reads \"The Legend of the Five Warriors\" and wonders how the superstitions of a previous century could have such a large impact on their lives. He mentions that though becoming Ronin Warriors fulfilled their dreams, he was more than prepared to put down the sword for the rest of his life. He reflects that though the armors helped rescue the world from evil, he still feels guilt from the anguish that were indirectly caused by them. When thinking of the play, Sage speculates that it was likely written to warn future generations of the evil nature of their armors. Sage notices the play foretells of a child who will be sent forward from the past to show how them how to live as individuals. He believes that she was likely sent to fulfill their innermost wishes, and that a grudge may exist between the armors. Discovering a passage of the Inferno Armor destroying the others, Sage notices that this has not happened as of yet and wonders if it is their destiny. Realizing that something must have happened in the past, Sage comes to the conclusion that their time as Ronin Warriors is not done as of yet, and that another battle may be coming. The Armor of Halo then manifests in front of him and attempts to attack, but Sage does not defend himself. The armor stops its attack, to which Sage says the time of fighting force with force is finished, causing the armor to disappear. Sage mentions that he can see the path, to which Suzunagi looks on in surprise. Looking at the book once again, Sage notices a drawing of the building where Rowen had previously went to before he disappears and rushes towards it. Kento attempts to jump off a skyscraper but is stopped before he lands, to which he concludes that someone must be keeping them alive to summon the Inferno Armor. Suzunagi then attacks Kento with the Armor of Hardrock. She confirms that she wants to summon the Inferno Armor to guide it to its proper path, and for that reason she created new sets of armor. Kento tells Suzunagi that the Inferno Armor causes nothing but destruction, but Suzunagi already knows this, saying that darkness shrouds the Inferno Armor and the light is needed to free the world. The new Armor of Hardrock approaches Kento, and though he attempts to fight it, he causes no damage. A light then engulfs the area, showing a flashback of a young Suzunagi and her mother. Sage soon arrives and notices the new Armor of Hardrock, but upon seeing him Suzunagi retreats. The Armor of Hardrock attempts to follow her, but Kento jumps upon it, causing himself and the armor to disappear. Sage then asks if this is the beginning or the end.\n| LineColor           = 00416A\n}}\n| AltDate             = June 3, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = Sage enters the building where Suzunagi is residing. Suzunagi reflects on changing of the seasons, how they are self-contained from her guilt, and whether she belongs in the current world. She commends on how the beauty in nature transcends everything in the heart, providing a sense of comfort and balance that can put the soul at ease. As Suzunagi pulls out the new Armor of the Halo out of a chest, Sage approaches her. Suzunagi asks Sage what he is looking for, but Sage mentions that she summoned him. She tells him that she has no idea what her motivations are, but Sage deduces that it likely has something to do with the Inferno Armor and its nature of destruction. He tells Suzunagi that the Ronin Warriors no longer want anything to with that life. Suzunagi responds that she wants to remove all sorrow from the world, but Sage tells her that doing so will remove all good things from the world as well. Sage is then transported to town an Edo-era town center where a performance of \"The Legend of the Five Warriors\" is playing, and where a young Suzunagi and her mother live. The area is soon attacked by battleships. Sage then sees the play's author, Suzunagi's father, being punished by death due to his insisting its contents are real and causing panic on the way of life amongst the people. Sage, clad in his old armor, attempts to destroy the battleships but inadvertently destroys the town center as well. Suzunagi tells Sage that in this world, he is the spirit and that since he tried to fix the area's situation, he should not blame her for doing the same and that this is why they need the Inferno Armor. She tearfully pleads with Sage to quickly put on his new Armor of Halo. Sage complies, but before he calls upon the armor, he disappears, leaving Suzunagi in tears.\n| LineColor           = 00416A\n}}\n| AltDate             = June 3, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = Suzunagi laments that she has lost her spirit, no longer finding joy in the world. Ryo asks Mia why she is trying to get him from confronting Suzunagi, noting that the other Ronin Warriors have disappeared. Mia suggests that he may not need to fight and suggests a different approach. Ryo listens to voicemails from the other four members. Rowen's talks about \"The Legend of the Five Warriors\" and its ending, claiming that it ends in a bottomless pit of darkness with the armors destroyed. He also predicts a final battle is coming and urges them to end the cycle of violence. Cye's reflects on their previous battles, but that he is now more worried about his immediate surroundings and himself. He feels the armors have deep problems within themselves that are beyond his control, but he now wants to focus on what he can control - his own life. Kento's inquires on the occurrences of the last few days, and how he wishes they can over come their tormentor with The Inferno Armor. He tells them that he is afraid, but he is afraid because he is unsure of who they are fighting - whether it is a new villain, or themselves. Sage's urges Ryo to have faith in their emotions, telling them it is important to cause empathy for others. He feels that the armors had an influence on them for several generations, and that though the armors entwined themselves in dark moments in human history, it is ultimately the human spirit that is in control of them. It is through this mix that has caused strong compassion within the Ronin Warriors as well as humanity. A foreign government meets and discuss the appearances of dynasty soldiers fighting and causing damage in the city. They determine that similar occurrences happened in Japan, and Mia, who is attendance, stands and claims she has all the answer they are looking for. Ryo confronts Suzunagi at last, and claims that he can feel the others. This causes the new Armors of Strata, Torrent, Halo, and Hardrock to appear. Ryo tells Suzunagi that he will comply with her plan since he has confidence in his friends. Suzunagi tells Ryo the unique toll the armors have taken on each of its members: Rowen understands the mistakes of the past, Cye is searching for peace of mind, Kento wonders if the fighting will never end, while Sage has denied himself all battles. She asks Ryo what he thinks will be the end result of following their armors and then tells him to summon the Inferno Armor to end her anguish. Ryo tells her that he is taking the armor in order to find the answers to all of their questions, as the darkness and suffering they encountered had left all of their hearts weary and scarred. Suzunagi helps Ryo put on his new Armor of Wildfire, and Ryo tells her he will help relieve her from her curse. Ryo reunites with the other warriors and are transported with Suzunagi towards a graveyard who she claimed is filled with the other warriors who rejected the power of the armors. Suzunagi tells the warriors she will kill them there, but White Blaze soon emerges, placing a flower on Suzunagi's mother's grave. Her mother's spirit soon appears, and tells her that her sadness and suffering caused a great darkness to grow within her. However, she informs her that the graveyard that they are visiting contains warriors who did not just reject the spirit of the armors, but also embraced the power of love. It is through this love that has allowed them to relieve their grudge against humanity and rest in peace. Suzunagi's flashback of the battleship attack continues, where she witnesses her mother being killed in a fire right in front of her eyes, leaving Suzunagi alone and without someone to love. Her mother tells her that she placed her love in a small corner of the armors, and trusted that the five spirits that would come in a latter era would help Suzunagi finally ease her of her suffering. Suzunagi's mother tells her that she will always love her, and she thanks the Ronin Warriors for guiding Suzunagi back to the light. Suzunagi replies that she can love again, and that she at last found the peace she has been waiting for. Ryo, Rowen, Cye, Kento and Sage gather for the final time in the series and peer over the city in their new armors. They accept that they are beginning a new chapter as Ronin Warriors, but it will be themselves rather than their armors that will make an impact throughout history. As long as their hearts are filled with love, they know their spirits will dispel the negative influences and guide them towards the path of righteousness. A post-credit scene shows Ully, now in junior high, winning a kendo tournament.\n| LineColor           = 00416A\n}}\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.thetvdb.com/series/ronin-warriors/allseasons/official Ronin Warriors - Official Order] at TheTVDB"
