The Intelligence Organization of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IO-IRGC) was established on Khamenei's initiative in 2009.\nAccording to Stratfor, it is as powerful as the Ministry of Intelligence and possibly even more powerful than the other service. The agency appears to be more active at a domestic level while at an international level, the Quds Force is the key operational group. The agency also has a wide range of Basij informers. It has been described as a \"more ideological counterpart\" to the Ministry of Intelligence, which it\n\"overshadows\" and \"often\" overrules, according to the New York Times.\nDescription\nThe IO-IRGC is known for conducting internal surveillance, suppressing dissent, and maintaining a vast network of ideological informants. Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a pro-Israel lobby group, alleges that the Commander of IRGC Intelligence is directly implicated in \"surveilling and torturing dissidents\". According to Iran International, the IO‑IRGC systematically employs white torture and rape threats.\nAs head of the intelligence organization, Kazemi was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in October 2022 and February 2025 for his actions.\nSenior officials\nDeputy of IRGC Chief and Commander of the IO-IRGC:\n* Hossein Taeb (2009–2022)\n* Mohammad Kazemi (2022–2025)\n:* Deputy: Hassan Mohaqeq (2019–2025)\n* Majid Khademi (2025–Present)\n* Vice-Chairman: Mahdi Sayyari (from 2016)\nSee also\n* Parallel Intelligence Agency\n* Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Cyber Command\nReferences"
