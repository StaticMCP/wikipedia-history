Only the emperors who were recognized as legitimate rulers and exercised sovereign authority are included, to the exclusion of junior co-emperors who never attained the status of sole or senior ruler, as well as of the various usurpers or rebels who claimed the imperial title.\nThe following list starts with Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor, who rebuilt the city of Byzantium as an imperial capital, Constantinople, and who was regarded by the later emperors as the model ruler. Modern historians distinguish this later phase of the Roman Empire as Byzantine due to the imperial seat moving from Rome to Byzantium, the Empire's integration of Christianity, and the predominance of Greek instead of Latin.\nThe Byzantine Empire was the direct legal continuation of the eastern half of the Roman Empire following the division of the Roman Empire in 395. Emperors listed below up to Theodosius I in 395 were sole or joint rulers of the entire Roman Empire. The Western Roman Empire continued until 476. Byzantine emperors considered themselves to be Roman emperors in direct succession from Augustus; the term \"Byzantine\" became convention in Western historiography in the 19th century. The use of the title \"Roman Emperor\" by those ruling from Constantinople was not contested until after the papal coronation of the Frankish Charlemagne as Holy Roman emperor (25 December 800).\nThe title of all emperors preceding Heraclius was officially \"Augustus\", although other titles such as Dominus were also used. Their names were preceded by Imperator Caesar and followed by Augustus. Following Heraclius, the title commonly became the Greek Basileus (Gr. Βασιλεύς), which had formerly meant sovereign, though Augustus continued to be used in a reduced capacity. Following the establishment of the rival Holy Roman Empire in Western Europe, the title \"Autokrator\" (Gr. Αὐτοκράτωρ) was increasingly used. In later centuries, the emperor could be referred to by Western Christians as the \"emperor of the Greeks\". Towards the end of the Empire, the standard imperial formula of the Byzantine ruler was \"[Emperor's name] in Christ, Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans\" (cf. Ῥωμαῖοι and Rûm).\nDynasties were a common tradition and structure for rulers and government systems in the Medieval period. The principle or formal requirement for hereditary succession was not a part of the Empire's governance; hereditary succession was a custom and tradition, carried on as habit and benefited from some sense of legitimacy, but not as a \"rule\" or inviolable requirement for office at the time.\nConstantinian dynasty (306–363)\n) – Ambiguous legitimacy|name=ambig}}}}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:center\"\n|+\n! scope=col width=\"7%\" | Portrait\n! scope=col width=\"17%\" | Name\n! scope=col width=\"26%\" | Reign\n! scope=col width=\"50%\" | Notes\n|-\n|\n! scope=row style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA\" | Constantine I\"the Great\"\n| 25 July 306 – 22 May 337)West; then whole}}\n| Born at Naissus  272 as the son of the Augustus Constantius and Helena. Proclaimed Augustus of the western empire upon the death of his father on 25 July 306, he became sole ruler of the western empire after the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312. In 324, he defeated the eastern Augustus Licinius and re-united the empire under his rule, reigning as sole emperor until his death. Constantine completed the administrative and military reforms begun under Diocletian, who had begun ushering in the Dominate period. Actively interested in Christianity, he played a crucial role in its development and the Christianization of the Roman world, through his convocation of the First Ecumenical Council at Nicaea. He is said to have received baptism on his deathbed. He also reformed coinage through the introduction of the gold solidus, and initiated a large-scale building program, crowned by the re-foundation the city of Byzantium as \"New Rome\", popularly known as Constantinople. He was regarded as the model of all subsequent Byzantine emperors. His reign was marked by greater imperial control over the Eastern Church and the construction of new churches, especially at the holy places sacred to Christianity. To this day, Constantine is venerated as a saint by the eastern Orthodox church.\n|-\n|\n! scope=row style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA\" | Constantius II\n| 9 September 337 – 3 November 361)East; then whole}}\n| Born on 7 August 317, as the second surviving son of Constantine I, he inherited the eastern third of Roman Empire upon his father's death, sole Roman Emperor from 353, after the overthrow of the western usurper Magnentius; after two years on the run, the latter committed suicide. Constantius' reign saw military activity on all frontiers, and dissension between Arianism, favoured by the emperor, and the supporters of the Nicene Creed. In his reign, Constantinople was accorded equal status to Rome, and the original Hagia Sophia was built. Constantius appointed Constantius Gallus and Julian as Caesares, and died on his way to confront Julian, who had risen up against him.\n|-\n|\n! scope=row style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA\" | Julian \"the Apostate\"\n| 3 November 361 – 26 June 363)}}\n| Born in May 332 at Constantinople (the first emperor born there), Julian was the grandson of Constantius Chlorus and cousin of Constantius II. Proclaimed by his army in Gaul, he became the legitimate Emperor upon the death of Constantius. Julian has been described as the last pagan emperor of the Roman Empire and was generally opposed to Christianity. He was killed on campaign against Sassanid Persia, despite his initial success in surrounding the ancient city of Ctesiphon. For his adherence to the old Roman gods and rejection of the Christian faith, he became known as Julian the Apostate.\n|-\n! colspan=4 | &nbsp;\n|-\n|\n! scope=row style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA\" | Jovian \"Flavius\" will generally be omitted in the following entries for simplicity.}}\n| 27 June 363 – 17 February 364)}}\n| Born in , Jovian hailed from a military family and was captain of the guards (protector domesticus) under both Constantius II and Julian.

Meanwhile, Valens faced the challenge of the invading Huns, whose ferocity pushed the Gothic tribes to seek refuge within the Empire; Valens allowed them to settle on the condition that they become allies to the Empire. When the Goths were mistreated at Roman hands and rebelled, Valens proceeded to face them without awaiting assistance from Gratian's armies and was killed at the Battle of Adrianople.\n|-\n! colspan=4 | &nbsp;\n|-\n| style=\"background:#EBEBEB\" |\n! scope=row style=\"text-align:center; background:#EBEBEB\" | Procopius ()\n| style=\"background:#EBEBEB\" | 28 September 365 – 27 May 366; East)}}\n| style=\"background:#EBEBEB\" | Maternal cousin of Julian; revolted against Valens and captured Constantinople, where the people proclaimed him emperor.

During his reign, Theodosius made Nicene Christianity the official religion of the state. He reunited the whole Empire after defeating Eugenius at the Battle of the Frigidus, in September 394. Theodosius died of a fever at Milan in 395 and his two sons, Honorius and Arcadius, became the emperors of the West and East, splitting power between them.\n|-\n|\n! scope=row style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA\" | Arcadius\n| 17 January 395 – 1 May 408; East)}}\n| Born in 377/378, Arcadius was the eldest son of Theodosius I and upon the latter's death in 395, the Roman Empire was permanently divided between the Eastern Roman Empire—later referred to as the Byzantine Empire—and the Western Roman Empire with Arcadius becoming Byzantine emperor in the East while his younger brother Honorius became emperor in the West; both were manipulated by court officials and did not possess their father's leadership abilities. After contracting an illness, Arcadius died in 408.\n|-\n|\n! scope=row style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA\" | Theodosius II\"the Calligrapher\"\n| 1 May 408 – 28 July 450; East)}}\n| Born on 10 April 401, he was the only son of Emperor Arcadius and Empress Aelia Eudoxia. Theodosius II succeeded the throne in 408 upon the death of his father. Because he was a minor, the praetorian prefect Anthemius was essentially regent from 408 to 414, but Theodosius II's elder sister Aelia Pulcheria played a critical role as regent and co-ruler during his early years. Pulcheria exerted considerable influence, shaping court policies and fostering Christian orthodoxy. Theodosius II was known for his mild and scholarly temperament. He had a keen interest in theology, astronomy, and calligraphy, and was reportedly well-educated, thanks to the influence of his sister Pulcheria. His long reign was marked by significant legal, administrative, and theological developments. One of the most enduring legacies of Theodosius II's reign was the construction of the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople.  These massive fortifications protected the city for over a millennium and are regarded as one of the greatest defensive structures of antiquity.  Theodosius II strongly supported Nicene Christianity and convened the Council of Ephesus in 431 CE, which declared the Virgin Mary as Theotokos (\"God-bearer\") and condemned the theology of Nestorianism. He also commissioned the Theodosian Code, a comprehensive compilation of Roman laws published in 438; this codex organized and systematized the legal framework of the empire and influenced later European legal traditions. During his reign, he faced constant threats from the Huns of Attila and negotiated treaties with them, paying substantial tributes to prevent invasions. He married Aelia Eudocia Augusta, a learned woman of Greek descent, who, like the emperor's sister Pulcheria, became an influential figure in the court. Their marriage produced one daughter, Licinia Eudoxia, who later married Valentinian III, the Western Roman Emperor. Theodosius II died in 450 CE from injuries sustained after falling off his horse while hunting. His death marked the end of a relatively peaceful and prosperous reign, though it left unresolved issues such as rising threats from external enemies and religious divisions.\n|-\n! colspan=4 | &nbsp;\n|-\n|\n! scope=row style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA\" | Marcian\n| 25 August 450 – 27 January 457; East)}}\n| Born in 396.

He was the first emperor to be crowned by the Patriarch of Constantinople, and the first one to legislate in Greek. His reign was marked by the pacification of the Danube and peace with Persia, which allowed him to intervene in the affairs of the West, supporting candidates for the throne and dispatching an expedition to recover Carthage from the Vandals in 468. Initially a puppet of Aspar, Leo began promoting the Isaurians as a counterweight to Aspar's Goths, marrying his daughter Ariadne to the Isaurian leader Tarasicodissa (Zeno). With their support, in 471 Aspar was murdered and Gothic power over the army was broken.\n|-\n|\n! scope=row style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA\" | Leo II \"the Younger\"\n| 18 January – November 474\n| Born 468, he was the grandson of Leo I by Leo's daughter Ariadne and her Isaurian husband, Zeno.

He crowned his father as co-emperor and effective regent on 29 January, dying shortly after.\n|-\n|\n! scope=row style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA\" | Zeno\n| 29 January 474 – 9 January 475)}}\n| Born  425 in Isauria, originally named Tarasicodissa. As the leader of Leo I's Isaurian soldiers, he rose to comes domesticorum, married the emperor's daughter Ariadne and took the name Zeno, and played a crucial role in the elimination of Aspar and his Goths. He was named co-emperor by his son on 29 January 474 and became sole ruler upon the latter's death, but had to flee to his native country before Basiliscus in 475, regaining control of the capital in 476. Zeno concluded peace with the Vandals, saw off challenges against him by Illus and Verina, and secured peace in the Balkans by enticing the Ostrogoths under Theodoric the Great to migrate to Italy where the Gothic king ruled. Convincing Theodoric to move his Goths westward into Italy allowed Zeno to reduce what had been a drain to imperial resources, since these Germanic warriors had been exacting payments from the Empire throughout the 470s and 480s and menacing Eastern territories. As a consequence, Zeno's reign also saw the end of the western line of emperors. His pro-Miaphysite stance made him unpopular and his promulgation of the Henotikon resulted in the Acacian Schism with the papacy.\n|-\n|\n! scope=row style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA\" | Basiliscus\n| 9 January 475 – August 476}}\n| General and brother-in-law of Leo I, seized power from Zeno and crowned himself emperor on 12 January.

He was nicknamed \"Dikoros\" (Latin: Dicorus), because of his heterochromia. Apparently, there was some insistence from the citizenry of Constantinople that Zeno's successor should be an \"Orthodox\" Christian, which caused Ariadne to turn to Anastasius in the first place. Anastasius reformed the tax system and the Byzantine coinage and proved a frugal ruler, so that by the end of his reign he left a substantial surplus. His Miaphysitism led to widespread opposition, most notably the Revolt of Vitalian and the Acacian Schism. His reign was also marked by the first Bulgar raids into the Balkans and by a war with Persia over the foundation of Dara. He died childless. Shortly before his death, he tried to devise a means for one of his three nephews to succeed him by placing a note that read Regnum under their beds, but when none of them chose that bed, he decided instead to name the first person he saw the following morning. Keeping true to his word, when Justin—commander of the imperial guards—entered his presence first that morning, he was pronounced as Anastasius's successor.\n|}\nJustinian dynasty (518–602)\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:center\"\n|+\n! scope=col width=\"7%\" | Portrait\n! scope=col width=\"17%\" | Name\n! scope=col width=\"26%\" | Reign\n! scope=col width=\"50%\" | Notes\n|-\n|\n! scope=row style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA\" | Justin I \"the Thracian\"\n| 9/10 July 518 – 1 August 527)}}\n| Born  at Bederiana (Justiniana Prima), Dardania.

He succeeded Justin I as emperor upon the former's death. Through his mighty commanding general Belisarius, Justinian was able to regain North Africa, as well as much of Italy and Spain; these were territories that had been seized and occupied previously by various Germanic tribes (Vandals and Goths) at the former Western Roman Empire's expense.

Maurice fought wars against the Sassanian kingdom on the eastern front of his empire, the Avars and Slavs for control over the Balkans, and reinforced Byzantine holdings in Ravenna and Carthage. He is best remembered for his contributions to Byzantine military theory, notably his treatise Strategikon, a manual on warfare. Maurice named his son Theodosius as co-emperor in 590.

Named co-emperor in 1261, crowned in 1272, he succeeded as sole emperor on Michael's death. Favouring monks and intellectuals, he neglected the army by significantly reducing military spending, and his reign saw the collapse of the Byzantine position in Asia Minor.

The conflict ended in 1347 with Kantakouzenos recognized as senior emperor, but he was deposed by John V during another civil war. After successful Turkish incursions and their seizure of Adrianople, John V appealed to the West for aid against the Ottomans, even going so far as to seek religious union and journeying to Rome to convert to Catholicism. Despite his efforts otherwise, John V was forced to recognize Ottoman suzerainty in 1371.\n|-\n|\n! scope=row style=\"text-align:center; background:#F8F9FA\" | John VI Kantakouzenos\n| 8 February 1347 – 10 December 1354)with Matthew Kantakouzenos (1353–1357)}}\n| A maternal relative of the Palaiologoi, he was declared co-emperor on 26 October 1341, and was recognized as senior emperor for ten years after the end of the civil war on 8 February 1347.

Raised to co-emperor in 1373, he became senior emperor on John V's death and ruled until his death. He journeyed to the West European courts seeking aid against the Turks, and was able to use the Ottoman defeat in the Battle of Ankara—thanks largely to the fact that Timur and the Tatars attacked the Turks when they were besieging Constantinople, which forced the Turks' retreat—to regain some territories and throw off his vassalage to them.

Facing the designs of the new sultan, Mehmed II, on Constantinople, Constantine acknowledged the Union of the Churches and made repeated appeals for help to the West, but in vain.
