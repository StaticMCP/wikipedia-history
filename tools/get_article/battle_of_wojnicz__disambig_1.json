The battle ended in a Swedish victory.\nBackground\nIn the early stages of the Siege of Kraków, the Polish royal units of Hetman Lanckoronski decided to abandon the city, as the situation of the defenders was hopeless. Together with king Jan Kazimierz, the Poles headed eastwards, to the city of Tarnów. The king with the royal court had then turned southwards, towards Nowy Wiśnicz and Nowy Sącz, leaving the army of Lanckoroński to join units under Hetman Potocki by the ancient market town of Wojnicz.\nSwedish king Charles Gustav, who commanded the siege of Kraków, decided to chase the Poles, leaving Arvid Wittenberg with 8,000 soldiers in Krakow. Charles Gustav had app. 5,000 soldiers, mostly infantry, while the Polish units were more numerous, including the hussars under Aleksander Koniecpolski. The Poles were camped in the hills above Wojnicz, on the Dunajec river.\nBattle\nDue to poor visibility, the Swedes sent two cavalry regiments for reconnaissance. The regiments clashed with the Polish cavalry, which had been sent on a similar mission. The skirmish turned into a full-scale battle, which took place inside the Polish camp, among its tents. Charles Gustav quickly sent reinforcements, attacking the wings of the Polish cavalry. Under pressure from disciplined Swedish musketeers and their firepower, the hussars, who were an elite force of the Polish army, had to retreat beyond the river Dunajec. Stanislaw Lanckoronski narrowly escaped death.\nThe battle was another Polish failure and resonated profoundly across the Commonwealth. In nearby Tarnów, where the Polish forces had fled, thousands of soldiers switched sides and joined Charles Gustav. Among them were Dymitr Wisniowiecki, Aleksander Koniecpolski and Jan Sobieski, the future Polish king, who hoped that the Swedes would help Poland in the never-ending wars in the east.\nSwedish units\n*1.
