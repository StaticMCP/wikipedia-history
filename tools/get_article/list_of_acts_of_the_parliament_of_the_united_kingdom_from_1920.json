For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3. c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\n10 & 11 Geo. 5\nThe second session of the 31st Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 10 February 1920 until 23 December 1920.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 10 & 11 G. 5.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n| |note4= }}\n| |repealed=y|An Act to amend the Law in respect of the Standard Fineness of Silver Coins current in the United Kingdom and in other parts of His Majesty's Dominions.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n| |repealed=y|An Act to remove doubts as to the interpretation of subsection (4) of section five of the Representation of the People Act, 1918.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n-\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  and for other purposes incidental thereto.}}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|\n| |note4= }}\n-\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  of a provision for the Maintenance of the Children of the Marriage under sixteen.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  as respects such duties; and to amend the Motor Car Acts, 1896 and 1903, and the Development and Road Improvement Funds Act, 1909; and to make other provision with respect to roads and vehicles used on roads, and for purposes connected therewith.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and the Enactments relating to Agricultural Holdings.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and to continue certain byelaws.}}\n-\n|  }}\n|\n| |note4= }}\n}}\nLocal acts\n}}\n|\n|  }}\n| or the '''Price's Patent Candle Company's Act 1920'''|local|4|20-05-1920|An Act to confer further powers upon Price's Patent Candle Company Limited to repeal certain provisions of its existing Acts and for other purposes.}}\n|  and 1914 for the construction of certain works; and for other purposes.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  and the Ebbw Vale Urban District Council Act, 1917, for the purchase of certain lands and the construction of certain works, and for other purposes.}}\n-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n| |po1=Blaydon Order 1919|po1short=n}}\n|\n|\n-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n-\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n-\n|  relating to Glasgow Corporation.|po1=Glasgow Corporation Order 1920|Provisional Order to increase the Parks Libraries Municipal Buildings Public Health and Sewage Assessments in the City and Royal Burgh of Glasgow; to increase the amount the Corporation may borrow for Police and Tramway purposes; to make provision with respect to Ferries on the River Clyde; to amend certain provisions of the Glasgow Building Regulations Act, 1900; to extend the time for the compulsory purchase of Lands for and for the completion of the Tramways, Street Works and Bridges authorised by the Glasgow (Tramways, Bridges, &c.)
