It is also spoken as a second language by the Kalash people.\nNames\nThe native name of the language is Khō-wār, meaning \"language (wār) of the Kho people\".  During the British Raj, it was known to the English as Chitrālī (a derived adjective from the name of the Chitral region) or Qāshqārī. Among the Pashtuns and Badakhshanis, it is known as Kashkār. Another name, used by Leitner in 1880, is Arnyiá or Arniya, derived from the Shina language name for the part of the Yasin (a valley in Gilgit-Baltistan) where Khowar is spoken.\nHistory\nThe Khowar language expanded throughout Chitral from the northern part of the region, specifically from the Mulkhow and Torkhow Valley. According to Morgenstierne, the original abode of the Khowar language was northern Chitral in the valleys around Mastuj. The Khowar language started expanding into southern Chitral around the early 14th century.\nKhowar shares a great number of morphological characteristics with neighbouring Iranian languages of Badakhshan, pointing to a very early location of proto-Khowar in its original abode in Upper Chitral, although from its links with the Gandhari language, it likely came from further south in the first millennium BC, possibly through Swat and Dir.\nGeorg Morgenstierne noted, \"Khowar, in many respects [is] the most archaic of all modern Indian languages, retaining a great part of Sanskrit case inflexion, and retaining many words in a nearly Sanskritic form\".\nPhonology\nKhowar has a variety of dialects, which may vary phonemically. The following tables lay out the basic phonology of Khowar.\nVowels\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Front\n!Central\n!Back\n|-align=center\n!Close\n| || ||\n|-align=center\n!Mid\n|\n|\n|\n|-align=center\n!Open\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nKhowar may also have nasalized vowels and a series of long vowels , , , , and . Sources are inconsistent on whether length is phonemic, with one author stating \"vowel-length is observed mainly as a substitute one. The vowel-length of phonological value is noted far more rarely.\" Unlike the neighboring and related Kalasha language, Khowar does not have retroflex vowels.\nConsonants\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|-style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n!

The original Old Indo-Aryan /s, ʂ, ɕ/ contrast is maintained, eg. OIA. joṣati, aśru, svásṛ; Kh. ǰoṣík, aśrú, ispusár. The OIA kṣ became c̣/c̣h eg. OIA. pakṣa, Kh. poc̣ and more sibilants were made instead of a reduction which Continental IA did, eg. OIA. gaḍa, Kh. goẓ. OIA cluster ts was either preserved as a single phoneme ċ/ċh or merged with some other consonant OIA. vatsa, matsya, uts Kh. bac̣hóɫ, maċhí, uċ.\nTone\nKhowar, like many Dardic languages, has either phonemic tone or stress distinctions.\nOrthography\nKhowar orthography is derived from Urdu alphabet, with additional letters created to represent sounds unique to Khowar. Similar to Urdu, Khowar is typically written in the calligraphic Nastaʿlīq script.\nFrom the end of the 19th century onwards, literaturists and rulers of Chitral princely state have put in much effort to popularize literacy, reading, and writing in Khowar. Initially, Mirza Muhammad Shakur and Prince Tajumal Shah Mohfi adopted Persian alphabet, used in neighbouring Afghanistan. However, Persian alphabet did not have letters for many unique sounds in Khowar. By the early 20th century, as under British Colonial rule, Urdu education and literacy became ever more popular among Indian Muslims (see Hindi–Urdu controversy), Chitrali literaturists, namely Sir Nasir ul-Mulk and Mirza Muhammad Ghafran saw Urdu script as a better fit for Khowar. Nonetheless, Urdu also lacked sounds that existed in Chitrali. Thus, new letters were proposed and created. But the process of settling on a standard Khowar script continued for decades into the 1970s. This process was not without controversy either. Some literaturists were advocating for keeping the number of letters to a minimum, or in other words removing Arabic letters that do not represent distinct sounds in Khowar and are homophone with other letters (for example , being homophone with  respectively). In total, 6 new letters were added to the 37-letter Urdu Alphabet, to create the 43-letter Khowar script.\nGrammar\nNouns\nKhowar nouns inflect based on animacy, number, and case.\nAnimacy\nThe three gender system from Old Indo-Aryan has been replaced with an animacy-based noun classification system in Khowar.\nNumber\nThe direct case plural is usually marked only on animate nouns.\nCase\nAll Khowar nouns have four case forms, direct, oblique, ablative, and vocative. Inanimate nouns additionally have forms for instrumental, and four different locative cases. The locative 1 expresses pointlike locations as opposed to those having linear extent. The locative 2 expresses horizontal motion or location. The locative 3 expresses upward motion or location, while the locative 4 expresses downward motion or location.\n::{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Case endings\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Case\n! colspan=\"2\" | Singular\n! colspan=\"2\" | Plural\n|-\n! animate || inanimate\n! animate || inanimate\n|-\n! direct\n| Ø, or -án\n| Ø\n| -án, -gíni, or reduplication\n| Ø, (-án)\n|-\n! oblique\n| -o\n| -o\n| -an\n| -an\n|-\n! locative 1\n| rowspan=5\n| -a\n| rowspan=5\n| -en\n|-\n! locative 2\n| -i\n| -en\n|-\n! locative 3\n| -tu\n| -en\n|-\n! locative 4\n| -o\n| -en\n|-\n! instrumental\n| -en\n| -en\n|-\n! ablative\n| -ar ~ -ári\n| -ar\n| -ar ~ -ári\n| -ar ~ -ári\n|-\n! vocative\n| -é, -aá (for God)\n|\n| -án (used with voc particle é: ‘hey, o’ …)\n|\n|}\nPronouns\nOnly the first and second person pronouns have distinct direct and oblique forms.\n::{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ First and second person pronouns\n! rowspan=2 | Case\n! colspan=\"2\" | Singular\n! colspan=\"2\" | Plural\n|-\n! 1st !! 2nd\n! 1st !! 2nd\n|-\n!

They have both a basic and extended form which is formed with h(a). The emphatic form is usually used when something is mentioned for the first time.\n::{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Demonstrative pronouns\n! rowspan=2 |\n! colspan=2 | Singular !! colspan=2 | Plural\n|-\n!
