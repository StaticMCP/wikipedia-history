Based in Tengah Air Base, the squadron goes by the motto \"Stand Firm in Defence\" with the Osprey adopted as its mascot.\nHistory\nThe Squadron was set up in September 1970 as Singapore's first Air Defence Fighter Squadron and received their first aircraft - twenty refurbished Hawker Hunters aircraft in July 1970. The Hawker Hunters served faithfully for twenty years, after which they were replaced by the F-16A/Bs in 1990. These were, in turn, replaced by newer F-16C/Ds in 2000 and were subsequently transferred to Royal Thai Air Force the same year.\nThe Squadron celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2020.\nInformation\nThe tail is adorned with a red checkered tailband. The squadron's logo is centered with the serial number on the base of the tail. This scheme was already applied during the F-16A/B era.\nAchievements\n140 Squadron is also a consistent winner in the annual Singapore Armed Forces Best Unit Competition for the Air Force, having emerged as the Best Fighter Squadron since the competition's inception back in 1985. Namely: 1985, 1987, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2016.\n140 Squadron won the Best Squadron for the Hotshot Challenge 2016. It celebrated its 45th anniversary in 2015 and won the Best Fighter Squadron.\nAircraft operated\n#46× Hawker Hunters (1970–1992)\n#8× F-16A/B Fighting Falcons (1990–2004)\n#12× F-16C/D Fighting Falcons (2003–present)\nLatest photo\nFile:RSAF Hawker Hunter (front).jpg|A retired 140 Sqn Hawker Hunter FGA.74S - serial number 527, parked outside the RSAF Museum.\nFile:RSAF F-16´s preparing to scramble.jpg|Pilots of 140 Sqn responding to a simulated quick reaction alert (QRA) to scramble their F-16Cs.\nFile:RSAF F-16 in alert fighter taxi-ing.jpg|F-16C clearing out from the flight-line for taxi-ing.\nFile:RSAF F-16 on taxi.jpg|Same F-16C taxi-ing towards the runway for take-off.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/atozlistings/air_force/assets/airbases_and_squadrons/tengah.html RSAF web page on 140 Sqn & Tengah Air Base (TAB)]"
