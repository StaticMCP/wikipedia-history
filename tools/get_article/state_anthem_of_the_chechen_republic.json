Between 2000 and 2010, the Republic of Chechnya did not have its own anthem, unlike other first-level administrative divisions of the Russian Federation. The former self-proclaimed Chechen Republic of Ichkeria had its own anthem, titled \"Death or Freedom\".\nThe author of the text is Akhmad Kadyrov, the first Head of the Chechen Republic and father of current Head Ramzan Kadyrov. The accompanying music was composed by Chechen musician Umar Beksultanov.\nOppositions to the Kadyrov regime prefer the use of the Anthem of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria over the current State Anthem of the Chechen Republic.\nLyrics\n;Chechen original\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Cyrillic script\n!Latin script\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top; white-space:nowrap;\"\n|\n|\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top; white-space:nowrap;\"\n!Arabic script\n!IPA transcription\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top; white-space:nowrap;\"\n|dir=\"rtl\"|خارر̤وٓنوٓ ڗە تەسنا خییلا حوٓ یاگارخ،\nنوٓخچییچوٓ ر̤ا یوٓجنا غاتتینا یاخا.\n𝄆 کاوکازان تڨەس خیللا، مارشوٓنان آگا،\nحان لاتتان سیی دینا یاح یوٓلچو ناحا. 𝄇\nبارت بوٓلو حان ڨامناش – ماخ بوٓر̤و بەرکات!\nحوٓ یوٓر̤ورگ، نانا یار̤، نوٓخچیین خالڨ حاستا.\nتخان داخار، تخان دەرزار دایمەخکان قەرچاح،\nدەڨالدار دوٓخوش دو، داللا بەش خاستام. 𝄇\nباشلامان باخحاشکا داین سینوٓس دوسسو.\nاوٓرگانا تولغەنوٓ نەنان موٓتت بویر̤و.\n𝄆 ایسباحا سوٓوغات حوٓ، آزالـلەح دەللا.\nشاتلاقان ایللی دو تخونا نیر̤ڨ بەللارگ. 𝄇\nڨینحەگام، حان حونارش خازدەللا شاینا،\nحالڨار̤ا لەرام بار قائ خولدا حونا.\n𝄆 ماشاران غاروٓلەح ایرسان نەڨ تاینا،\nسیی دوٓلوش نوٓخچییچوٓ یەخییلا تخونا! 𝄇\n|\n|}\n{| cellpadding=\"6\"\n!English translation\n!Russian translation\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top; white-space:nowrap;\"\n|No matter how unjust the bloodshed burned you,\nFor times countless you kept falling and rising.\n𝄆 Lightning of Kavkaz, cradle of liberty,\nYour proud people kept glorious your honour. 𝄇\nTreasured is the harmony between your peoples,\nThere is no other homeland for us Chechens.\nLife and death in the hearth of our homeland,\nPraise to thee, and blessed be our native homeland!\nThe souls of our forebears land atop Bashlam,\nThe waves of Argun speak our mother tongue.\n𝄆 You are a grand gift given for life to us,\nAnd our anthem has granted strength to us! 𝄇\nLabour, courage, and respect of the people,\nLet this for thee be delightful news.\n𝄆 The guardian of peace, the path to happiness,\nLet us all live in glorious Chechnya! 𝄇\n|\n|}\nRegulations\nThe anthem of the Chechen Republic is performed when the Head of the Chechen Republic assumes office after taking the oath; at the opening and closing of the republic's parliamentary meetings; during the official ceremony of lifting the national flag; and during ceremonies of meetings and wires of delegations of foreign countries, intergovernmental organizations, and official visits to the republic by foreign head of states.\nThe anthem can also be played during the openings and closings of monuments, memorials, ceremonial meetings, holiday meetings, during other solemn and protocol events held by the state authorities of Chechnya, local self-government bodies, and state NGOs.\nAdditionally, the anthem is performed during official ceremonies during sports competitions in the Chechen Republic in accordance with the rules of holding these competitions (in particular, at the first and last home game of the \"Terek Football Club\" season).\nSee also\n* Anthem of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://chechnya.gov.ru/page.php?r=79 Listen online]\n* [http://chechnya.gov.ru/page.php?r=80 Chechen and Russian lyrics]"
