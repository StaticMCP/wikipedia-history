The festival claims to be \"the nation’s largest Renaissance theme park.\" As of 2017, the festival sits on 55 acres of land, and offers over 200 acres of camping facilities to patrons. The festival regularly draws over half a million guests annually, making it the largest Renaissance festival in the country by attendance.\nHistory\nThe TRF was founded in 1974 by brothers, David and George Coulam, on an abandoned strip mining site in what is now Todd Mission, Texas. At the time, it spanned fifteen acres, with three stages featuring small improv theatre groups, and merchants selling their goods on blankets. The opening year saw a turn-out of 33,000.\nThe fair has since grown to an annual attendance of over 500,000 with 400 vendors and 21 stages over eight weekends. A documentary series on the TRF and its ownership, Ren Faire, was produced in 2024 by HBO.\nFeatures\nAs of 2017, the TRF featured approximately 500 costumed actors who performed on 25 stages. Its 350 on-site shops included: international food purveyors; unique artisans; merchants and craft vendors; human-powered rides; an abundance of performers walking among the guests; and the Queen's Royal Finale (fireworks if weather permits) at dusk. The fair hosts over half a million visitors annually, which peaked at 679,000 in 2016.\nThemed weekends\nEach of the weekends of the festival take on a different theme, influencing the performances, costumes, food, drink, art, shops, contests, and games throughout the festival grounds.\n*Oktoberfest - German theme, including polka music and dancing, and the serving of traditional German beer.\n*1001 Dreams - Fantasy theme, encouraging lavish costumes of wizards, fairies, and elves and including several fantastical contests, such as scavenger hunts and costume contests.\n*All Hallows Eve - Medieval Halloween theme, including spooky decorations and contests, such as jack-o-lantern carving contests, to celebrate the holiday.\n*Pirate Adventure - Pirate theme, encouraging pirate costumes and including several sea-related games and contests.\n*Roman Bacchanal - Roman theme, encouraging Roman costumes and hosting several Roman-themed contests and games such as toga contests and spaghetti eating contests.

The festival features several medieval-themed music and dance groups, including everything from belly dancing, to harps and fiddles, to bagpipes and accordions, to the carillon.  Throughout the festival park several demonstrating artists can be found presenting the methods of various medieval trades, such as glassblowing, forging armor, candle-making, coin minting, and others to visitors.\nOn the larger stages, other, grander events take place, the largest of which is the Joust. The Joust is performed by the Hanlon-Lees Action Theatre, and is an accurate reenactment of a medieval joust, featuring authentic weapons, costumed horses, and armored knights. Staple performances include The Birds of Prey show, a highly praised free-flying bird show including hawks, owls, vultures, and eagles, the Fire Whip Show, the Clan Tynker Family Circus, the Pride of Bedlam, and the School of Sword. Other performances at the festival include acts designed for mature audiences only; as well as for youngsters.\nAt the end of the festival, a royal finale takes place in the arena, featuring performances from several of the entertainers and musicians, and closing with a fireworks presentation.\nSee also\n* List of Renaissance and Medieval fairs\n* Renaissance Fair\n* Ren Faire\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://trfbeefeaters.com Texas Renaissance Festival Beefeaters]\n* [https://www.texrenfest.com/festival-map/ Map of festival grounds]"
