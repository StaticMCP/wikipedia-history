The Suns and Rays of Bolívar were South American military forces aligned with Simón Bolívar, primarily from Venezuela, where they had been fighting to overthrow Spanish rule on the continent. \"Suns and Rays\" was the name of their Masonic lodge, where they hatched the plans to organize this revolution. Other Masonic movements involved in this Revolution affiliated with Freemasonry in Cuba were; Knights Rationales, Cadena Eléctrica and Cadena Triangular de Bolívar.\nReferences"
