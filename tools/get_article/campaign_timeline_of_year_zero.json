      "text": "# Campaign timeline of Year Zero\n\nThe following is a campaign timeline of the Year Zero alternate reality game.  The Year Zero alternate reality game, and its accompanying concept album of the same name, criticizes the United States government's policies as of 2007, projecting a dystopian vision of its impact on the state of events in 2022.  The game began in mid-February 2007 and seems to have wrapped up in April shortly after the album came out.\nFebruary 2007\n;February 12, 2007\n:*Fans found that a new Nine Inch Nails tour T-shirt contained highlighted letters that spell out the words \"I am trying to believe.\" It was discovered that iamtryingtobelieve.com was registered as [https://web.archive.org/web/20080827163127/http://iamtryingtobelieve.com/ a website], and soon several related websites were found in the IP range ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070216002832/http://anotherversionofthetruth.com/ Another Version of the Truth], [https://web.archive.org/web/20070216002715/http://bethehammer.net/ Be the Hammer], [https://web.archive.org/web/20070216003954/http://105thairbornecrusaders.com/ 105th Airborne Crusaders], and [https://web.archive.org/web/20070216003025/http://churchofplano.com/ Church of Plano]), all describing a dystopian vision of the world fifteen years in the future.\n:*Consolidated Mail Systems was found through reference on the Another Version of the Truth forums.\n;February 14, 2007\n:*During Nine Inch Nails' first ever concert in Lisbon, Portugal, a USB flash drive was found in a bathroom stall containing a high-quality MP3 of the track \"My Violent Heart\", which quickly circulated on the internet. This was initially thought by many to be an accidental leak of the song, but further releases in a similar fashion confirmed these to be intentional \"leaks\" and as part of the overall alternate reality game.  On the end of the MP3 was a few seconds of static, which, when analyzed under a spectrogram reveals an image of \"The Presence.\"  The same static is on the album at the end of Track #9, \"The Warning\".\nSpectrogram analysis of \"2432.mp3.\"\n;February 19, 2007\n:*A USB drive was found at a concert in Barcelona, Spain, containing two audio files: the track \"Me, I'm Not\" and an MP3 of static.
