Examples of this are the Channel Island fox, extinct dwarf elephants of Crete, and Brookesia micra, a minuscule chameleon from Madagascar. An noninsular example is the evolution of dwarfed marmosets and tamarins among New World monkeys. Phyletic dwarfism may have also helped give rise to birds from their much larger dinosaur ancestors.\nReferences"
