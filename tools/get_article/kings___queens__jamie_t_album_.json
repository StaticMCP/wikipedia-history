It peaked at No. 23 on the UK singles chart. The namesake EP also featured three B-sides: \"Forget Me Not (The Love I Knew Before I Grew)\" (feat. Hollie Cook & Ben Bones), \"Planning Spontaneity\", and \"When They Are Gone (For Tim)\".\n\"The Man's Machine\" was the third single from the album, released on 23 November 2009.
