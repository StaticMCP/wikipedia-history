By March 2024, more than 190 candidates had filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to run for the Democratic nomination in 2024. As in previous cycles, the majority of these candidates did not appear on any ballots, raise money, or otherwise attempt to formally run a campaign.\nOn July 21, 2024, incumbent President Joe Biden, then-presumptive Democratic nominee after his victories in the primaries, suspended his re-election campaign. Biden immediately endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, who announced her own candidacy the same day and officially became the Democratic nominee on August 5. On August 6, 2024, Harris chose Tim Walz to be her running mate.\nMajor candidates\nOn July 21, 2024, then-presumptive nominee Joe Biden announced the suspension of his re-election campaign and immediately endorsed Harris as his successor. Other than Biden, the only presidential candidates who were awarded pledged delegates to the 2024 Democratic National Convention based on the results of the primaries were incumbent Democratic U.S. Representative Dean Phillips and businessman Jason Palmer.\nOn August 2, 2024, Harris unofficially received the party nomination in a virtual roll call vote, which became official on August 5.\nNominee\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Democratic nominee for the 2024 presidential election\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Candidate\n!
