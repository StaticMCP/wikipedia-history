It gives its name to a ward in the Erdington council constituency. Kingstanding ward includes the areas; Perry Common, Witton Lakes. The other part of Kingstanding falls under the Oscott ward.\nKingstanding houses a covered drinking water reservoir, Perry Barr Reservoir, on the site of the former Perry Barr Farm.\nKingstanding is served by two libraries; Kingstanding Library and Perry Common Library.\nThe area known as Kingstanding Circle is where the Kingstanding village centre lies with its shops and Kings Road/ Kingstanding Road roundabout.\nHistory\nThe name of the area is derived from the occasion when the Stuart King Charles I supposedly reviewed his troops standing on the Neolithic Bowl Barrow in the area on 18 October 1642 during the English Civil War, after his stay at nearby Aston Hall. The first references to Kingstanding were as King's Standing.\nThe course of the Icknield Street Roman Road runs past this barrow; and when the foundations for the water pumping station were being dug in 1884, a hoard of Roman coins was discovered.\nThe area was largely rural until 1928, when large-scale residential development commenced in the area. The first of the estates was completed in 1934. It was during the 1930s and 1940s that most of the current housing was built.

It killed one woman and injured five others, one of which was in life-threatening condition.

However, it was announced by the Returning Officer shortly after the declaration that a counting error had taken place and, following a High Court recount, Ebanks was removed as Councillor on 26 July 2006 and replaced by Labour candidate Catherine Grundy. In 2014 Conservative Gary Sambrook defeated Labour in a by-election, caused by the resignation of Catharine Grundy. In the 2014 local elections Ron Storer also won the seat for the Conservatives from Labour, in what was once a safe Labour seat. They continued to represent the ward until the 2022 Birmingham City Council Election.\nAt the 2019 general election, Gary Sambrook was elected to be the MP for the Birmingham Northfield constituency and remained as the councillor for the ward until the 2022. At the 2022 local election, Ron Storer was elected to be the councillor for the Longbridge & West Heath ward which is in the Birmingham Northfield constituency. At the 2022 Birmingham City Council Election, the Conservative's Rick Payne and Labour's Des Hughes were elected to serve on the Council to represent the ward.\nKingstanding is part of the Birmingham Erdington parliamentary constituency. The current Member of Parliament is Paulette Hamilton of the Labour Party, who was first elected in a by-election in March 2022 following the death of the previous Labour MP Jack Dromey.\nWorld War II\nA number of bombs were dropped on the then new Kingstanding housing estate during World War II.
