They were as follows:\n* Rudolf of Habsburg, king (1273–1291)\n* Adolf of Nassau, king (1292–1298)\n* Albert I of Habsburg, king (1298–1308)\n* Henry VII of Luxembourg, king from 1308, emperor (1312–1313)\n* Louis IV the Bavarian, king from 1314, emperor (1328–1347), House of Wittelsbach\n* Charles IV of Luxembourg, king from 1346 (re-elected in 1347), emperor (1355–1378)\n* Wenceslaus of Luxembourg, king (1378–1400)\n* Rupert of the Palatinate, king (1401–1410), House of Wittelsbach\n* Jobst of Moravia, king (1410–1411), House of Luxembourg\n* Sigismund of Luxembourg, king from 1410, emperor (1433–1437)\nThis categorisation is, however, not universally recognised by historians. In fact, during this period only Rudolph&nbsp;I, Adolphus of Nassau and Henry&nbsp;VII were imperial counts; all the other kings were dukes or (Bohemian) kings and prince-electors.\nSee also\n*Anti-king#Germany\n*Interregnum (HRE)\nLiterature\n* Bernd Schneidmüller: Die Kaiser des Mittelalters, C.
