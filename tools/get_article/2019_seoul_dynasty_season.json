The team looked to improve on their 2018 season, when they posted a 22–18 record and missed out on the season playoffs.\nA 3–0 victory over the London Spitfire in the final match of Stage 1 gave the team a 4–3 record and qualified them Stage 1 Playoffs. Seoul took down the New York Excelsior 3–1 in the quarterfinals, but they were eliminated after losing to the Vancouver Titans, 0–4, in the semifinals. The Dynasty struggles in Stage 2, as they were only able to amass a 3–4 record. After the All-Star break, Seoul hit their stride. The team opened Stage 3 with three straight 4–0 sweeps over their opponents, leading to a 5–2 Stage 3 record. Qualified as the fifth seed in the Stage 3 Playoffs, the team fell to the San Francisco Shock 1–3 in the quarterfinals. Seoul struggled in Stage 4, which included the implementation of an enforced 2-2-2 role lock; a 1–3 loss to the Philadelphia Fusion in the final match of the regular season took the team out of the top six in regular season standings.\nIn eighth place in the regular season standing, Seoul had to compete in the Play-In Tournament in order to make it to the season playoffs. After defeating the Guangzhou Charge 3–1 in the tournament, the Dynasty claimed the final spot in the season playoffs.

Seoul's season ended in the first round of the lower bracket, as they fell 1–4 to the Hangzhou Spark.\nPreceding offseason\nPlayer re-signings\nFrom August 1 to September 9, 2018, all Overwatch League teams that competed in the 2018 season could choose to extend their team's players' contracts. On August 31, before Dynasty released any of their players, Heo \"Gambler\" Jin-Woo retired from professional play and became a streamer for Gen.G Esports, the team's parent organization. Three days later, Dynasty acquired Baek \"Fissure\" Chan-hyung from Los Angeles Gladiators. Dynasty elected not to re-sign three players, releasing Gong \"Miro\" Jin-Hyuk, Moon \"gido\" Gi-Do, and Choi \"Wekeed\" Seok-Woo. The Dynasty also announced Kim \"KDG\" Dong-gun as the team's new head coach.\nFree agency\nAll non-expansion teams could not enter the free agency period until October 8, 2018; they were able to sign members from their respective academy team and make trades until then.

On October 19, Dynasty signed three players in tank Choi \"Michelle\" Min-hyuk, tank Hwang \"Marve1\" Min-seo, and support Lee \"Jecse\" Seung-soo, along with an assistant coach in Lee \"WhyNote\" Ju-hyeop.

On Eichenwalde, both team also completed the map to push the map into overtime rounds, but Paris was full-held in their second attack, while Seoul managed a tick. The final map, Watchpoint: Gibraltar, also went to overtime rounds; this time, Paris would take the map win, but the Seoul took match, 3–1.

Seoul selected Volskaya Industries for map three, but the Shock secured a map victory after the map went to overtime rounds. Dorado, the fifth map, was again completed by both teams on their respective attacks, but again, the Shock emerged victorious to take the match. The 1–4 loss ended Seoul's playoff run.\nStage 4\nPrior to the beginning of Stage 4, which would include the implementation of an enforced 2-2-2 role lock by the league, the Dynasty mutually parted ways with DPS Byeon \"Munchkin\" Sang-beom, who was moved to an inactive role after Stage 3.\nSeoul opened Stage for with a match against the Shock on July 26.

Seoul found themselves up 2–0 going into the match break. The Dynasty struggled to shut down the Charge on the third map, Horizon Lunar Colony, as they were only able to draw the map.
