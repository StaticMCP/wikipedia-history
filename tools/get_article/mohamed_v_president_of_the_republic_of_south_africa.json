The court ruled that the South African government may not extradite a suspect who may face the death penalty without seeking an assurance from the receiving country that the suspect will not be sentenced to death.\nSee also\n* Section Eleven of the Constitution of South Africa\n* S v Makwanyane (abolishing the death penalty in South Africa)\n* Soering v United Kingdom (similar ruling from the European Court of Human Rights)\n* United States v.
