The Anglo-Jayakartan forces inflicted significant losses on the Dutch during the war. Many Dutch lodges and forts were captured by the Anglo–Jayakartan forces with the help of Bantenese forces of Ranamanggala's orders, and suppression of the VOC(Dutch East India Company) following the war with the East India Company caused the Dutch to retreat from Banten. This eventually led to Dutch incidents on the island of Run. The Dutch began to prepare their second attempt at conquering Jayakarta in May 1619.\nBackground\nIn 1618, Jan Pieterszoon Coen, the governor-general of VOC sent a protest message to East India Company in Jayakarta due to English fleets having hijacked and captured the VOC ship Zwarte Leeuw in Patani, Siam. Writing to Thomas Dale, he complained that the English were starting to harm the Anglo-Dutch relations in East Indies. The English countered that the Dutch started the conflicts by trying to expel the English from Moluccan.\nThe Dutch aimed to remove the allies of the English in the East Indies, as well as expel the English possessions in the East Indies. Thus, Coen assessed that the justifications given by the English were not the true reasons for the hijacking of Dutch ships in Siam. Coen additionally tried to intimidate the English by planning the assassination of Nicholas Ufftels.\nCourse of the war\nOn 20 December 1618, the VOC fleets had a naval engagement against EIC fleets off the Jayakarta coasts. Jan Pieterszoon Coen launched military aggression on EIC by declaring war in the East Indies. Two days before, the VOC fleets in Molucca had already been plundering the EIC ships. The EIC received news that Richard Wetsby, an English ambassador in Jambi was killed by the VOC after Wetsby received a party invitation by the VOC, and that the EIC ship The Hound was burned.\nOn 31 December 1618, Jan Pieterszoon Coen launched a naval action off the Jayakarta coasts, but his fleets were not able to attack because their fleets were trapped by the Anglo-Bantenese fleets. With these conditions, Coen decided to retreat to Molucca to assemble his forces.\nOn 26 December 1618, the Banten Sultanate sent 2,000–3,000 troops to Jayakarta on Arya Ranamanggala's orders, the main objective being to expel the VOC from Jayakarta. Ranamanggala established the new rules that the VOC could not trade and open lodges in Jayakarta, but the arrival of Bantenese forces also unsettled Wijayakrama, the ruler of Jayakarta. Wijayakrama demanded that if the Dutch were to leave Jayakarta, the English must also leave Jayakarta. According to the EIC, this condition marked Wijayakrama's desire to sever their relations with Banten. It also pressed the English to do something in Jayakarta while the five ships of the Dutch company were leaving Jayakarta to avoid Wijayakrama's condition.\nAssault to Mauritius Huis\nseen taken captive by the Javanese forces, François Valentyn in the book 1619]]\nFrom 10 to 14 January 1619, the Anglo-Jayakarta forces attacked the VOC fort on the Jayakarta coast, causing the Dutch to retreat to Jepara and Ambon. The Dutch also sending the message to EIC for gaving the fairness of the family and VOC officials. VOC mentioned that the people living on the Fort of Mauritius Huis was living in the worst conditions and trusted the EIC for the future of their people in the fort that has no assurance, this request was accepted by the EIC, and gave 200.000 Lire to their officials safety in two years. However the VOC respond this answer by attacking EIC fleets in Ambon.On 22 January 1619, Jayakarta forces led by Wijayakrama was leading his forces to kidnap the VOC leaders in Jayakarta. They successfully kidnapped Pieter van den Broecke, a VOC leader in Jayakarta.\nSieges of Mauritius Huis\nOn 29 January 1619, after the Anglo-Jayakarta forces stormed the VOC forts off the Jayakarta coast, the Bantenese forces blockaded the VOC forts. The English only helped the Jayakartan forces by supplying them with weapons. However, VOC officials at the fort were forced to surrender after 4 days to the Anglo-Jayakartan forces. Meanwhile, the Cirebon Sultanate established relations with the EIC, opening their ports to them. The Sultanate chose Henry Boshvile as the leader of their trade posts in Jepara.\nArrest of Wijayakrama\n) attacked by Bantam fighters, 1724 print.]]\nArya Ranamanggala took offence at Wijayakrama's decisions to declare war against the Dutch and make an agreement with the English about the Dutch fort. Ranamanggala demanded that the English must leave Jayakarta, threatening to destroy the English trading office in Banten otherwise. On 19 February 1619, during the negotiations, Ranamanggala ordered his commander Pangeran Upatih to attack the English troops with 4,000 men. Following the attack, Several English troops ran to their office in Jayakarta and left Jayakarta. Meanwhile, Wijayakrama was arrested along with 50 of his guards, dismissed from his position, and detained and exiled to Tanara. Wijayakrama's son, Jayawikarta, rose to lead the Jayakartan government. But Ranamanggala was his superior, causing Jayakarta to fall completely under the control of Arya Ranamanggala.\nCapture of Nassau Huis\nOn 1 March 1619, the Anglo-Jayakarta forces attacked the VOC lodges off the Jayakarta coast. The attack involved both naval and ground units. Jayakarta forces with the help of EIC fleets captured the VOC lodges and factory off the Jayakarta coast. They succeeded in capturing many of the VOC spices and weaponry, the English also freeing their captured forces.\nAftermath\nCoen and his fleets bombarded the English fleets in the island of Run, the main base of EIC. Many of the pieces of forts were destroyed by Coen's fleets. After that, the VOC fleets also attacked many of the EIC spice farms which were within VOC canon range. VOC fleets delayed their campaign in the Banda islands and sailed to Jayakarta to launch a counter-attack against Jayakarta.\nCoen decided to launch their counter-attacks on Jayakarta by attacking the Bantenese forces off the coast line of Jayakarta and capture their fort that was under Bantenese hands. Jan Pieterszoon Coen launched the series of brutal naval actions on Jayakarta by destroying the port of Jepara and hijacking many Chinese ships who wanted to trade with Jayakarta.\nReferences\nNotes\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
