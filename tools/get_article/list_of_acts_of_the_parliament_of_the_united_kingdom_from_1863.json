For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".\nSome of these acts have a short title. Some of these acts have never had a short title.  Some of these acts have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n26 & 27 Vict.\nThe fifth session of the 18th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 5 February 1863 until 28 July 1863.\nPublic general acts\nand to settle certain Annuities on Her Royal Highness.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  of the last Session.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n| or the Supply Act 1863|public|6|27-03-1863|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to apply the Sum of Ten Millions out of the Consolidated Fund to the Service of the Year One thousand eight hundred and sixty-three.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| or the Supply (No. 2) Act 1863|public|15|11-05-1863|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to apply the Sum of Twenty Millions out of the Consolidated Fund to the Service of the Year One thousand eight hundred and sixty-three.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n| or the Local Government Amendment Act 1863|public|17|11-05-1863|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act for amending the Local Government Act (1858).|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| or the Land Drainage (Ireland) Act 1863|public|26|08-06-1863|archived=n|An Act to facilitate the Drainage of Land in Ireland.}}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  relating to the Districts of Basford, Teignmouth, Kingston-upon-Hull, Nottingham, Bradford, Ryde, Bedford, Croydon, Batley, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Sheerness, and Bromsgrove.|po1=Provisional Order putting in force the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, within the District of the Basford Local Board in the County of Nottingham, for the Purchase of Lands by the said Board for Street Improvements.|po1short=n|\n|po2=Provisional Order putting in force the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, within the District of the Teignmouth Local Board, for the Purchase of Land by the said Board for a Public Road.|po2short=n|\n|po3=Provisional Order putting in force the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, within the Borough of Kingston-upon-Hull, for the Purchase of Lands by the Local Board of Health of the aforesaid Borough for Street Improvements.|po3short=n|\n|po4=Provisional Order putting in force the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, within the District of the Local Board for the Borough of Nottingham, for the Purchase and taking of Lands by the said Board otherwise than by Agreement.|po4short=n|\n|po5=Provisional Order putting in force the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, within the District of the Bradford Local Board of Health, for the Purchase of Land by the said Board for Street Improvements.|po5short=n|\n|po6=Provisional Order altering the Kingston-upon-Hull Improvement Act, 1854, in force within the Borough of Kingston-upon-Hull, incorporating in it Provisions of the Towns Improvements Clauses Act, 1847, respecting Streets, providing for the Recovery of Expenses incurred in the making good of Streets, and extending Provisions for preventing Fraud in the Sale and Delivery of Coal.|po6short=n|\n|po7=Provisional Order for extending the Borrowing Powers of the Ryde Commissioners acting as Local Board within the District of Ryde in the Isle of Wight.|po7short=n|\n|po8=Provisional Order repealing and altering Parts of Local Acts in force within the District of the Bedford Local Board.|po8short=n|\n|po9=Provisional Order for altering the Provisional Order applying the Public Health Act, 1848, to the District of Croydon in the County of Surrey.|po9short=n|\n|po10=Provisional Order for altering the Order in Council applying the Public Health Act, 1848, to the District of Batley in the County of York.|po10short=n|\n|po11=Provisional Order for extending the Borrowing Powers of the Berwick-upon-Tweed Local Board of Health.|po11short=n|\n|po12=Provisional Order for extending the Borrowing Powers of the Sheerness Local Board of Health.|po12short=n|\n|po13=Provisional Order altering parts of a Local Act in force within the District of the Bromsgrove Local Board.|po13short=n|\n}}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  authorizing the Sale of Mill Sites and Water Powers by the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland.}}\n|  }}\n| or the Security from Violence Act 1863|public|44|13-07-1863|archived=n|An Act for the further Security of the Persons of Her Majesty's Subjects from personal Violence.}}\n|\n|\n|\n|  for punishing Mutiny and Desertion of Officers and Soldiers in the Service of the East India Company; and for regulating in such Service the Payment of Regimental Debts and the Distribution of the Effects of Officers and Soldiers dying in the Service.|note4= }}\n|\n|  until the First Day of January One thousand eight hundred and sixty-five, and to amend the said Act.|note4= }}\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  to amend the Laws relating to Loan Societies.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  relating to the Burgh of Leith.|note4=|po1=|po1short=n}}\n|\n|\n| |po1=In the Matter of Morden Carrs.
