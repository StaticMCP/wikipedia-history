During this period, Pakistan was governed under the 1962 Constitution which declared the country to be a federal presidential republic. In contrast to the earlier 1956 Constitution, Pakistan was governed as a secular republic rather than an Islamic republic. Moreover, Field Marshal Ayub Khan governed the republic throughout its entire existence as the president of Pakistan.\nHistory\nBackground\nIn 1947, Pakistan achieved its independence from British rule in India as the Dominion of Pakistan, an independent federal dominion of the British Commonwealth of Nations. During this period, Pakistan administered itself under the Government of India Act 1935 as an interim constitution. After the death of Pakistan's founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, in 1948 and the assassination of Liaquat Ali Khan in 1951, Pakistan suffered from unstable and constantly changing leadership under several prominent members of the Muslim League. In 1955, Iskander Mirza succeeded Malik Ghulam Muhammad as Governor-General of Pakistan, and later became the first president after the 1956 constitution. In just three years, Mirza dismissed four elected governments and was under increasing pressure to call new elections by 1958.\nIn response to political opposition to Mirza by political leaders such as Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy and Feroz Khan Noon, Mirza declared martial law on 7 October 1958 and abrogated the constitution. Mirza subsequently appointed Ayub Khan, then the defence minister, as Chief Martial Law Administrator. Twenty days later, on 27 October, Khan launched a coup d'etat against Mirza and declared himself president. Khan's new regime immediately banned all political parties, maintained martial law, and centralized power under the elite bureaucracy of the upper class.\nFormation\nIn 1960, a referendum, that functioned as the Electoral College, was held that asked the general public: \"Do you have confidence in Muhammad Ayub Khan?\" The voter turnout was recorded at 95.6% and such confirmation was used as impetus to formalise the new system – a presidential system. Ayub was elected president for the next five years.\nThe Supreme Court established a new constitutional commission led by Chief Justice Muhammad Shahabuddin to draft a new constitution. Ayub altered the constitution to fit his desired vision, disregarding the 1961 commission report by Shahabuddin. The new constitution restored political freedom by lifting the martial law enforced since 1958, and declared Pakistan to be a federal presidential secular republic. The constitution was also more liberal compared to its 1956 predecessor, declaring Islam as a respected religion but not the state religion. Under this constitution, the president would have to be elected by 80,000 (later 120,000) Basic Democrats through an electoral college, who were theoretically able to choose any candidate; however, Ayub heavily controlled these Basic Democrats.\n1965 war\nDemocratic movement and uprising\nInterregnum under Yahya Khan\nDemographics\nGovernment\nPolitics\nEconomy\nReferences"
