The result was a Spanish victory.\nOne of the English ships, the Francis, was captured and the others fled from the battle. Then, knowing Drake's plans, the Spanish flotilla took advantage over the bulk of Drake's fleet, and arrived at San Juan on 13 November,  reinforcing the town with 500 soldiers and supplies. The Spaniards organized different artillery positions in strategic locations, and the five frigates were positioned to cover the entrance of the bay with their artillery, awaiting the arrival of Drake. On 22 November, with the defenses completed, the English fleet arrived off San Juan and tried to invade the town. The result was another Spanish victory over Drake's forces.\nSee also\n* Spanish Main\n* Battle of Las Palmas\n* Battle of San Juan (1595)\n* Guadalupe Island\n* Fort San Felipe del Morro\nNotes\nReferences\n* Fernández Duro, Cesáreo (1898).
