He holds the record for the slowest winning time ever recorded at a Kentucky Derby, at 2:52. Kingman was ridden in the Derby by Isaac Burns Murphy and was considered one of the best prospects for winning the 1891 American Derby. However, Kingman finished third in that race and won few races of importance thereafter.\nKingman was bought by John E. Madden of Louisville, Kentucky in the latter part of 1891 for $5,000 at the Jacobin Stable dispersal sale. Kingman did not race after three years old and died in 1893 at the age of five.\nPedigree\nReferences"
