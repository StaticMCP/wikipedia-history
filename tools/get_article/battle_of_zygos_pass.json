To combat the Pecheneg revolt, Byzantine Emperor Constantine IX sent an army under the command of Basil the Synkellos, Nikephoros Botaneiates, and the Doux of Bulgaria, to guard the Danube. Whilst marching to their station, the Pechenegs ambushed and destroyed the Byzantine army. Surviving troops, led by Nikephoros, escaped. They traveled for 12 days to Adrianople, while under constant Pecheneg attacks. Botaneiates first gained notoriety after his actions during the battle. Resulting in a promotion to magistros. As a consequence of the Byzantine defeat at this battle, Emperor Constantine IX was forced to sue for peace.\nBattle\nDuring the Pecheneg Revolt, Byzantine Emperor Constantine IX sent Nikephoros Botaneiates, Basil the Synkellos, and the Doux of Bulgaria to guard the Danube River. While traveling through the mountains, Basil decided to not attack the Pechenegs, and ordered his army to leave the region. The Pechenegs ambushed the Byzantines as they were leaving, destroying their army. Nikephoros rescued the cavalry by ordering them into a tight formation, preventing the Pecheneg's horse archers from inflicting casualties on the Byzantines.\nNikephoros withdrew and encamped his army at a nearby river bank. He deployed scouts to prevent any further surprise attacks. Nikephoros held out against the Pechenegs for eleven days, during which, the Pechenegs shot the Byzantine horses, forcing them to continue on foot. The Pechenegs also unsuccessfully tried to persuade the Byzantines to surrender. One Byzantine soldier offered Nikephoros a horse to escape on. However, he refused the offer.\nOn the twelfth day, Nikephoros reached Adrianople. Once the Byzantine army arrived at the city, the Pechenegs fled. Because of Nikephoros's actions during the battle, emperor Constantine IX awarded him the title of Magistros. Afterwards, Constantine IX sued for peace with the Pechenegs due to the crushing losses.\nReferences"
