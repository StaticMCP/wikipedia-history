It promotes neurogenesis of neural stem/progenitor cells (cells capable of differentiating into neurons, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes) in vitro.  In addition, queen bee acid has been reported to have in vitro anti-tumor, anti-biotic, immunomodulatory, estrogenic, neurogenic, and innate immune response modulating activities.\nIn the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has taken legal action against companies that have used unfounded claims of health benefits to market royal jelly products.\nSee also\n* 10-Hydroxydecanoic acid\n* 2-Decenedioic acid\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.drugs.com/mtm/royal-jelly.html Royal Jelly Uses, Side Effects & Warnings], medically reviewed by Drugs.com on Sep 29, 2020.
