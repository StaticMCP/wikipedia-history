These links are specified by the user, and are arbitrarily flexible.  glue is written in Python, and built on top of its standard scientific libraries (i.e., Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy, [http://vispy.org/ Vispy]). glue is distributed as part of the Anaconda Python distribution, and is available on MacOS X, Linux, and Windows platforms.\nglue offers a high-level of customization, and users can easily integrate their own Python code for data input, export, cleaning, and analysis. Examples of customization include automatically loading and cleaning data before starting glue, writing custom functions to parse files in a preferred file format, writing custom functions to link datasets, or creating custom data viewers.\nglue is being used on astronomy data of star forming-clouds, medical data including brain scans, and many other kinds of data. Several plugins exist to extend glue's functionality to a wide range of fields. These include [https://github.com/glue-viz/glue-medical glue-medical] to parse medical imaging data (e.g. DICOM files), [https://github.com/glue-viz/glue-geospatial glue-geospatial] for GIS visualization, [https://github.com/glue-viz/glue-openspace glue-openspace] to interface with the [https://www.openspaceproject.com/ OpenSpace] planetarium software, and [https://github.com/glue-viz/glue-wwt glue-wwt] to support interoperability with the WorldWide Telescope software.\nIn 2019, glue gained attention for its role in astronomers' discovery of the Radcliffe wave, an enormous gaseous structure that was only able to be seen with the assistance of new 3D mapping techniques. In 2023, glue played an instrumental role in the discovery and rendering in Augmented reality of a Superbubble between Perseus (constellation) and Taurus (constellation).\nOriginally built on the Qt GUI framework for use on the desktop, an entirely browser-based version of glue ([https://github.com/glue-viz/glue-jupyter glupyter]) is being developed for the Project Jupyter ecosystem, including Jupyter notebooks and JupyterLab.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
