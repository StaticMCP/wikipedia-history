A Chinese-Hong Kong co-production, the film stars Sun Honglei as Police Captain Zhang, who partners with a drug lord named Timmy Choi (Louis Koo) after Choi is arrested. To avoid the death penalty, Choi agrees to reveal information about his partners' methamphetamine ring. Zhang starts to harbor doubts about Choi's honesty as the police begin to take on the drug ring.\nThe film premiered at the Rome Film Festival on November 15, 2012. It has received positive reviews.\nPlot\nFleeing from an explosion at his drug manufacturing facility, Timmy Choi crashes his car into a restaurant and as he revives he is captured by Captain Zhang Lei. Realizing that he will receive the death penalty for his crimes, he bargains information on his colleagues to survive and introduces Captain Zhang Lei as \"Uncle Bill\", to become a supplier to Haha, who owns a port and can distribute drugs to other countries. Captain Zhang Lei poses as Haha to the real \"Uncle Bill\". Choi goes to his factory where he meets with his two mute employee brothers. Choi plants recording devices in his factory, setting up everyone in it.  Then they set up the real Haha with the real Uncle Bill.  However, an attempt to capture the mute brothers at the factory fails, and they escape through a hidden tunnel. Captain Zhang is livid at Choi for withholding information about the secret exit, which has cost the lives of several police team members.\nChoi pleads for a second chance as \"Uncle Bill\" is really just a front for 7 influential Hong Kong gangsters whom he did not wish to rat out because 2 of them are his relatives as they are his brother and godfather. The next day, Captain Zhang poses as Haha again and meets with \"Uncle Bill\". They negotiate a deal to distribute drugs using Haha's port, while Choi identifies the 7 gangsters's bosses. Later they discuss terms of the deal at a nightclub, where Captain Zhang, posing as Haha, accuses \"Uncle Bill\" of being a cop, pretending to be infuriated. The big 7 confront him in the parking garage, revealing their identities and confirming their business relationship. On the day after that, Choi leads the big 7 and their entourage to the port, but instead pulls the entourage in front of a primary school as parents and children are arriving for the day.\nChoi removes his wires and reveals to the big 7 that he has ratted them out and they are surrounded by cops. Realizing that something has gone wrong, Captain Zhang and his officers close in. A shootout ensues, and nearly all of the gangsters, along with several officers, are killed. Choi escapes in a school bus. However, he crashes into the escaping mute brothers as they are fleeing, believing that Choi has ratted them out. Another shootout takes place. Captain Zhang, wounded, arrives with several other wounded comrades to stop the mute brothers. Though the mute brothers are killed, the cops are all severely wounded from the shootout. Choi who was handcuffed earlier by Zhang escapes and uses the opportunity to fatally gun down Zhang and the other officers, but Zhang is able to handcuff himself to Choi's leg before he dies. Choi is then captured by SWAT reinforcements before he can escape. Choi begs them for another chance to live by trading more information on other gangsters, but is executed by lethal injection.\nCast\n*Louis Koo as Choi Tin-ming/Timmy Choi ()\n*Sun Honglei as Captain Zhang Lei ()\n*Huang Yi as Yang Xiaobei ()\n*Wallace Chung as Guo Weijun ()\n*Gao Yunxiang as Xu Guoxiang\n*Li Guangjie as Chen Shixiong ()\n*Guo Tao as Senior Dumb\n*Li Jing as Junior Dumb\n*Lo Hoi-pang as Birdie\n*Eddie Cheung as Su\n*Gordon Lam as East Lee ()\n*Michelle Ye as Sal ()\n*Lam Suet as Fatso\nProduction\nThe film was billed as  To's first action film to be entirely shot and set in Mainland China.
