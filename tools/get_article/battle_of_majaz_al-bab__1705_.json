For this reason, he first captured the city of El Kef then besieged the city of Tunis. The Algerians finally abandoned the siege on Tunis after the promise of a ransom. The Algerian forces fled, leaving behind much equipment and many treasures.\nThe battle\nWhen Hussein ibn Ali, the bey of Tunis, saw the sudden huge Algerian army disappear in one night, a cavalry was sent by the Bey set out in pursuit for the Algerians, after taking the treasures and booty that the governor of Bône  sent, among them old Arab auxiliaries of Moustapha who rushed behind them. They followed them all the way to the city of Majaz al-Bab in the plain Sedira where they met. The retreating Algerians suddenly turned for an offensive return who surprised the small cavalry, which made a mess among them, leaving the Tunisians with 500 soldiers less.\nReferences"
