Awarded projects must have enhanced the quality of the built environment or public domain or contribute to the wellbeing of the broader community.' In addition to the named award, the jury also can present National Awards for Urban Design and National Commendations for Urban Design.\nNaming of the award\nThe award is named after United States born architect and landscape architect Walter Burley Griffin (1876–1937), designer of Australia's capital, Canberra. Soon after winning the design competition for Canberra he and his wife Marion Mahony Griffin established an influential design practice based in Australia from around 1914 to 1935.\nChange from civic design to urban design\nThe national award was initially established by the RAIA as the Civic Design Award in 1988 and then named as the Walter Burley Griffin Award for Civic Design Award in 1990 and given annually through to 2002. In 2003 the award subject was changed from 'Civic Design' to 'Urban Design' to reflect changes in the architectural profession and the rise of 'urban design' as a specialisation and the more common terminology for architectural and city making projects of larger scale and community or public benefit.\nEarlier awards for civic design\nIn 1959 the Civic Trust Awards were established in the United Kingdom as an awards system to recognise outstanding planning, urban design and architecture.  In 1967 the Civic Trust of South Australia was established based on the UK Civic Trust Awards, and is now known as the Australian Civic Trust and although still a registered incorporated association in 2025 it has not been active since 2019.\nIn 1964 Robert Woodward was presented with the inaugural RAIA NSW Chapter Civic Design Award for the El Alamein Fountain in Kings Cross, Sydney. In 1967 Harry Seidler was presented with an RAIA Civic Design Award for Australia Square.In 1979 the NSW Chapter of the Institute of Architects named the state–based award as the Lloyd Rees Award for Civic Design. In 1980 Jørn Utzon was presented with a RAIA Civic Design Award for the Sydney Opera House.\nState based awards for urban design\nThe Australian Institute of Architects national awards jury selects a national winner each year from a shortlist made of up to eight selected state and territory urban design awards from AIA local chapter awards including;\n* Australian Capital Territory: Sir John Overall Award for Urban Design\n* New South Wales: Lloyd Rees Award for Urban Design (started 1964, named 1979)\n* Northern Territory: George Goyder Award for Urban Design\n* Queensland: Karl Langer Award for Urban Design\n* South Australia: Gavin Walkley Award for Urban Design\n* Tasmania: Dirk Bolt Award for Urban Design (started 2019)\n* Victoria: Joseph Reed Award for Urban Design (named 1997)\n* Western Australia: John Septimus Roe Award for Urban Design\nRecipients of state–based awards (including commendatations) are then eligible for consideration for the Named Award, Architecture Award and Commendations for Urban Design presented later in the same year, as part of the national architecture awards. On some occasions state commnedations have won the Walter Burley Griffin Award.\nRecipients of Walter Burley Griffin Award for Urban Design\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ style=\"text-align:
