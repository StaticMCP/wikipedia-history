The Old Courthouse (St. Louis), is at the right.]]\nBiography\nJump was born in Paris, France, around 1831.  His early life is not well documented, but he emigrated to California in 1852, attracted to the United States by the California Gold Rush. He traveled in the Western United States, returned to Paris for a short time and then back to the U.S.\nWhile living in California, Jump, who was both a talented painter and cartoonist, made a living drawing commercial signs, painting portraits, and producing humorous cartoons of political figures for various publications.\nHe worked in many places around the state, but mostly in San Francisco; there he created labels for whiskey bottles, and caricatures of contemporary figures. The 1860 census listed him as a \"portrait painter.\"\nIn 1864 he was living in the Montgomery Block, San Francisco.\nJump remained active in San Francisco until October 1865, when an earthquake occurred. After moving to Washington, DC, in 1868, Jump became somewhat renowned for his artistic merits as a portrait painter. It was there that he met and married a French performer from a touring opera company. By the 1870s, Jump and his wife had moved to New York City, where he worked as a comic illustrator. Later in the decade, Jump attempted to start an illustrated newspaper in Montreal. Following the failure of this venture, Jump moved frequently, first to New Orleans, then to Cincinnati and St Louis.\nIn 1875 and 1878 he lived in St. Louis, Missouri.\nIn 1878, while working on sketches of the New Orleans Mardi Gras for the Frank Leslie's Weekly, Jump was arrested on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon when a pistol fell from his pocket and discharged. He pleaded guilty and a judge sentenced him to ten minutes in the parish prison.\nJump was living in St. Louis in 1878 and assigned to make sketches for ''Frank Leslie's Weekly of the first Veiled Prophet Parade and Ball when he was hurt badly by two hoodlums who took a wallet, a ring, and sketches of the ball. Nevertheless, Jump was able to finish his drawing of the parade (above), and it was published in the Weekly.''\nFinally, in 1880, Jump and his wife settled in Chicago, where he was just able to make a living by producing circus and theatrical posters. He was living in Chicago in 1882.\nReputation\nWhen Jump lived in San Francisco, California, in the 1860s, he was reputed to be the city's \"favorite cartoonist.\" He roomed with Samuel Clemens, who wrote under the name Mark Twain. Michael G. Mattis of the Sacramento Bee wrote that Jump \"had an eye for accurate detail, even when his aim was burlesque. One of the pleasures his audiences got from his drawings was that in crowd scenes it was always possible to recognize the faces of scores of notable San Franciscans.\"\nFellow artist Frank Bellew recalled that Jump once said of his career:\n. . . one has to turn one's hand to everything. I draw caricatures for the bar-rooms, and do these big posters for the theaters, and make sketches for private individuals, and so on.\nThe Chicago Tribune said that Jump:\ndespite his dissolute habits, was possessed of no mean talent in his particular line. He never attempted much in the way of oil paintings of any very fine work, because he was too restless and nervous and lacked application. As a caricaturist, however, he was a wonderful success. Specimens of his work in this line are to be found in a thousand different places and in a score of large cities . . . .\nA dispatch from St. Louis, Missouri, said that Jump:\nwas known as an eccentric character, but a fellow of some talent, and very apt at cartoons. Free and easy specimens of his work adorn the walls of several leading saloons and sporting headquarters. . . . Through his paintings[,] he was as well known as any man in the city.\nDeath\nOn April 21, 1883, Jump committed suicide by shooting himself in the head with a pistol, driven to depression by the state of his marriage, financial issues, and alcoholism. He died the next morning.\nAn article reporting Jump's death appeared in the Chicago Daily Tribune, on the day of his death.\nThe article described how Jump wrote two final letters, one addressed to his wife, and another to a lodge in St. Louis, where he was a member.\nThe letter to his wife read as follows:\nkeep calling here for letters; there will be a good one for you from England. I am too excited to write. God bless you. Your husband,\nE. Jump.}}\nThe other read:\nJump's funeral took place two days after his death, and he was buried at Rosehill Cemetery, Chicago. He was survived by his wife and daughter.\nFamily\nThe woman with whom he was living in 1860 was named Rose Jump. He married Emily C. Rogers of Ireland on January 21, 1868, in the District of Columbia. She had been a prima donna with Napoleon's Italian opera company in Italy.\nThey had a daughter, born 1865.\nEmily C. Jump was committed to a New York asylum 1in 1885 as a \"helpless inebriate.\"\nGallery\nImage:Edjump3.jpg|''Sketch from Their Excellencies' Reception\nImage:Edjump2.jpg|Sketches at the Capital-The Smoking Room, House of Commons\nImage:Edjump4.jpg|Sketches from the Capital-A Game of See-Saw\nImage:Edjump5.jpg|Sketches at the Capital.
