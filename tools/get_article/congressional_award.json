Established in 1979, the program recognizes the initiative, service, and achievements of young people. The Congressional Award is nonpartisan and voluntary.\nIt recognizes the setting and completion of goals in four program areas: voluntary public service, personal development, physical fitness, and expedition or exploration. Based on their time commitments to each area, participants earn bronze, silver, or gold Congressional Award certificates and medals.\nThe Congressional Award was created by law on November 16, 1979, under Public Law 96–114, also known as the Congressional Award Act. The legislation was sponsored by Senator Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming and Representative James J. Howard of New Jersey.\nThe Congressional Award operates as a public–private partnership, registered as a 501(c) organization and funded entirely by private-sector donations. It is Congress’s only official charity.\nAs of September 2011, more than 50,000 youths had registered as participants in the program. The Congressional Award is one of two congressional honors for young people, the other being the Congressional Medal of Merit.\nProgram overview\nOnce a participant registers for the program online or by mail, they receive a record book to track progress in the four key areas: voluntary public service, personal development, physical fitness, and expedition or exploration.\nParticipants must register officially to receive their record books, which are required to document and verify activities. After achieving their goals and meeting the program requirements, participants submit their completed record books to the national office for review. The office notifies them of approval or requests additional information.\nProgram areas\nThe four program areas are voluntary public service, personal development, physical fitness, and expedition or exploration. The structure is designed to foster well-rounded growth, similar to the Duke of Edinburgh's Award.\nVoluntary public service\nThis area encourages participants to share their time and talents for the benefit of others. Activities must be unpaid and may include service used to meet graduation requirements. Youth are expected to provide direct service to the community, demonstrating sensitivity, commitment, and perseverance. Participants may set up to four goals per record book in this category.\nPersonal development\nThe personal development component challenges participants to broaden their horizons by pursuing new interests or advancing existing skills. Goals should focus on developing individual talents, life skills, or personal growth. Participants may set up to two goals per record book.\nPhysical fitness\nThis category promotes physical well-being through measurable fitness goals. Participants may take up a new physical activity or improve their performance in an existing one. Both team and individual activities qualify as long as they demonstrate progress toward improved fitness. School gym classes do not count toward this requirement. Up to two goals may be submitted per record book.\nExpedition or exploration\nThis component aims to build self-reliance, determination, and cooperation through adventure and discovery. Participants plan and complete either an expedition (an outdoor or wilderness experience) or an exploration (a cultural or environmental experience).\nExpeditions typically involve camping, hiking, or other outdoor activities that require planning and survival skills. Explorations focus on new cultural or environmental experiences, such as visiting historical sites, living on a farm, or traveling to another region or country.\nActivities like conferences, camps, retreats, or organized tours do not qualify, as the experience must be independently planned and executed by the participant.\nValue-added partnerships\nThe Congressional Award allows participants to count many of their existing activities toward the program, through partnerships with youth organizations such as:\n4-H\nAmeriCorps NCCC\nASPCA\nBig Brothers Big Sisters of America\nBoys & Girls Clubs of America\nBoy Scouts of America\nCivil Air Patrol\nGirl Scouts of the USA\nHabitat for Humanity\nRed Cross\nYMCA\nActivities completed prior to registration do not count. The award focuses on goal-setting and achievement, not past accomplishments.\nGoals\nParticipants complete the program by setting and achieving self-directed goals. Goals should be specific, measurable, challenging, and achievable. Advisors and validators assist participants in refining and documenting their goals.\nRequirements\nParticipants must complete a set number of hours and months of activity in each of the four program areas, depending on the award level pursued (bronze, silver, or gold). Participants work at their own pace, and higher-level awards include recognition for lower-level achievements.\nPartial awards are not granted; all four program areas must be completed at the required level before an award is issued. The minimum time requirements encourage sustained engagement rather than short-term participation.\n;Certificate levels:\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Minimum hours by program area\n! Bronze\n!

Instead, they hold several fundraising events to support the program, most notably: The Congressional Award Chiefs of Staff Annual Golf Classic and The Congressional Award Chiefs of Staff Charity Poker Event.\nThe Congressional Awards' largest event is the annual gold medal ceremony, held in the US Capitol. The June ceremony celebrates the accomplishments of gold medalists, bringing them together from across the country for a presentation of their Congressional Award gold medal by their member of Congress. Due to the large number of medalists, there are usually two ceremonies on Capitol Hill on the gold medal day.\nAccompanying the gold medal ceremony is the gold nation experience, an opportunity for gold medalists to create new relationships with other outstanding youth from across the country. The optional program provides medalists with an opportunity to come to Washington, D.C. and see the city together. The gold nation experience usually runs from the week of the gold ceremony until the day after. The cost of the gold nation experience is greatly discounted to medalists due to the fundraising efforts of the Congressional Award Foundation. However, medalists must provide their own transportation to Washington. The gold medal ceremony also commemorates adults and their participation in youth fund raising and volunteering.\nHistory\nThe Congressional Award was created in 1979 with the passage of the Congressional Award Act. Since then, the Act has had to be reauthorized to extend the Act's termination date. On July 23, 2013, Senator Tom Carper (D-DE) introduced the Congressional Award Program Reauthorization Act of 2013 which would again extend the termination date of the program, pushing it from October 1, 2013, to October 1, 2018.\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office's [http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44505 report on S. 1348], the Congressional Award Foundation received no federal appropriated funds, but did receive free office space in a Congressional office building and did not have to pay for the medals produced by the U.S. Mint.\nOn September 24, 2018, Rep. David Brat (R-VA) introduced H.R. 6862: Congressional Award Program Reauthorization Act of 2018. On September 26, 2018, Sen. Michael Enzi (R-WY) introduced S. 2309, the corresponding Senate bill. On October 11, 2018, President Donald Trump signed [https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/s3509 S. 3509], which retroactively reauthorizes the Congressional Award Board, effective October 1, 2018, until October 1, 2023, which administers the Congressional Awards Program.\nOther awards\nThe Horizon Award\nThe Horizon Award is a special recognition from the Joint Leadership Commission of the Congressional Award Foundation and its board of directors. The Horizon Award is presented to individuals from the private sector who have contributed to expanding opportunities for all Americans through their own personal contributions, and who have set exceptional examples for young people through their own successes in life. These recipients have truly forged ahead, establishing noble horizons to which our youth can aspire.\nPast recipients include:\n* 1997 Jimmy Smits, Tom Selleck\n* 1998 Leeza Gibbons, David Frost, Grant Hill\n* 1999 Mariah Carey, Judith Hale\n* 2000 Bob Lanier\n* 2001 Esai Morales\n* 2002 Arnold Schwarzenegger, Wynton Marsalis, Jerry Blavat\n* 2003 Art Monk, Charles Mann\n* 2007 Lauren Nelson\n* 2008 Drew Brees, Dwayne Johnson\n* 2009 Nick Cannon, Jimmie Lee Solomon\n* 2010 Michael Oher\n* 2011 Dominique Dawes\n* 2012 Dikembe Mutombo, Debbie Dingell\n* 2013 Patrick Ewing, Tony Horton\n* 2014 Kevin Liles\n* 2015 Steve Pemberton\n* 2016 America Ferrera, Cal Ripken Jr.\n* 2017 Chris Doleman\n* 2018 Curtis Martin\nThe Wallop Howard Leadership Award\nThe Wallop Howard Leadership Award is presented annually to individuals in the public sector who have displayed outstanding commitment to improving the lives of America's young people and providing critical support in the Congressional Award Foundation’s efforts to make the Congressional Award a national opportunity. The Leadership Award is presented by the Congressional Award Joint Leadership Commission, composed of The Speaker and Minority Leader of the House and Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate.\nPast recipients include:\n* 1994 President and Mrs. Jimmy Carter, Senator Malcolm Wallop, Congressman James Howard\n* 1995 Congressman John Glenn, Congressman Tom Bliley\n* 1996 His Royal Highness Prince Philip, Senator Mark Hatfield\n* 1997 Senator Bob Dole, Congressman Esteban Torres\n* 1998 Senator Robert Byrd, Congressman Dan Schaefer\n* 1999 Secretary of State Colin Powell, Judith McHale\n* 2000 First Lady Nancy Reagan, Congressman Charles Rangel\n* 2001 Congressman Donald Payne\n* 2002 Congressman Major Owens\n* 2003 Congressional Award Chairman Thomas Campbell\n* 2006 Congressman Ed Pastor\n* 2007 Senator Mike Enzi, Congressman Rush Holt\n* 2008 Senator and Mrs. Trent Lott, First Lady Laura Bush\n* 2009 Congressman Chris Shays\n* 2010 Senator John Culver\n* 2011 Governor Dirk Kempthorne, Senator David Pryor\n* 2012 Senator Bob Bennett\n* 2013 Senator Alan Simpson, Dr. Francis Collins\n* 2014 Hon.

More than 10,000 adult volunteers dedicate thousands of hours to promoting a lifestyle of service.\nThe Congressional Award is designed to bridge the gap between adolescence and adulthood. Working with adults is one way by which participants can achieve this. Most participants will work with five or more adults throughout the program: one advisor and four validators.\nAdvisors\nEach youth selects one adult to serve as their advisor. Teachers, neighbors, clergy, and coaches are examples of possible advisors. The youth may select any adult to be their advisor, so long as the advisor is not a relative or a peer. The advisor meets regularly with the youth to assist him or her in goal-setting and completing the record book. The advisor must sign the youth’s record book prior to submission to the Congressional Award Foundation for review.\nValidators\nValidators assist the participant with individual activities within a particular program area. Validators should be knowledgeable and/or experienced in the activity being pursued. For example, if a youth’s goal and activities involved basketball, a basketball coach would make a suitable validator. Similarly, if a youth volunteers at an animal shelter, a senior employee or the volunteer coordinator would be an appropriate validator. An advisor can also serve as a validator. While not particularly common, this is appropriate if a suitable validator cannot be found.\nIn addition to advisors and validators, countless adult volunteers promote the Congressional Award Program throughout the country.\nThe Congressional Award Foundation\nThe Congressional Award Foundation is the non-profit entity that oversees the distribution of The Congressional Award on behalf of Congress.\nBoard of directors\nThe Congressional Award Foundation's 48-member board of directors is partially appointed by the joint leadership of both parties in the House of Representatives and the Senate. In addition to actively promoting the Congressional Award Program across the country, the board meets quarterly to assess the program’s growth and provide direction to the national staff.\nNational/appointed members denoted by asterisk (*)\nExecutive officers\n* Chairman of the Board – Paxton K.

In a GAO audit of the Congressional Award Foundation’s 2005 and 2006 financial statements, the office identified\n:two significant matters related to the Foundation’s financial statements. These matters concerned (1) the Foundation's ability to continue as a going concern, which has been resolved, and (2) inconsistency between functional expenses reported in the Foundation’s annual information return (Form 990) filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the audited financial statements for fiscal year 2005.\nThe first \"significant\" matter referred to various problems, including a serious decline in the Foundation's assets: as of September 30, 2006 the value of the Foundation's asset had declined to under $8,500. Within a year, the asset value had grown to $125,000. The GAO also noted that the Foundation's national director paid over $23,000 to cover the costs of the Foundation's gold award ceremony during the Foundation's 2006 fiscal year; she was reimbursed for all but $664 by December 2006.\nThe inconsistency described in the second matter was resolved in the Form 990 and audited financial statements for fiscal year 2006.\nCongress created the Congressional Award Fellowship Trust in 1990 to \"benefit the charitable and educational purposes of the Foundation\"; the Foundation withdrew $20,000 from the trust in order to support its 2007 operations.\nThe Congressional Award has enjoyed financial stability in the subsequent years, and its proactive fundraising initiatives are working to ensure that it will never again face a budget shortfall.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.congressionalaward.org/ Official website]\n* [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/808 Congressional Award Act]\n* [https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s111-2865 Congressional Award Program Reauthorization Act of 2009]\n* [https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/s1348 Congressional Award Program Reauthorization Act of 2013]\n* [https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/s3509 Congressional Award Program Reauthorization Act of 2018]"
