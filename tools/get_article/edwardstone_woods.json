It is in four areas, Park Wood with the adjacent High Wood, Cowper's Wood, Stallington Wood and Priory Down.\nThese are ancient coppice with standards woods, which are mainly ash, maple and hazel, but there are large stands of hornbeam and small-leaved lime in some areas. The diverse ground flora is typical of Suffolk boulder clay soils.\nThe woods are private with no public access.\nReferences"
