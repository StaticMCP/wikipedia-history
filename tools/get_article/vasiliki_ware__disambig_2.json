The vases include a reddish-brown wash applied unevenly to mimic stone vessels.  The mottling was produced by uneven firing of the slip-covered pot, with the hottest areas turning dark. Considering that the mottling was controlled into a pattern, touching with hot coals was probably used to produce it.  There is also a style painted in a creamy white over the reddish-brown wash applied all over the body.\nThe first examples of Vasiliki ware are to be found in East Crete during EM IIA period, but it is in the next period, EM IIB, that it becomes the dominant form among the fine wares throughout eastern and southern Crete. Dating varies between scholars, but the Early Minoan II period is generally thought to run between around 2600–2000 BC.\nThe typical long-spouted pots, with a relatively small top mouth, are often called \"teapots\" by archaeologists; another common shape is called the \"egg-cup\".\nFile:Vasiliki teapots with elongated spouts AMH Heraklion.jpg|White style Vasiliki ware, AMH\nFile:Vasiliki ware tea pot archmus Heraklion.jpg|Another style of \"teapot\", Vasiliki, 2400–2200 BC, AMH\nFile:Vasiliki ware, jug, 2400-2200 BC, AMH, 144530.jpg|Vasiliki ware, jug, 2400–2200 BC\nFile:Tonkrug Vasiliki 01.jpg|Teapot in the white style, 2300–2000 BC, AMH\nFile:Pottery from Vasiliki, 2300-1900 BC, AMH, 144823.jpg|White style jug, 2300–1900 BC\nFile:Vasiliki ware from Phournou Koryphi 2.JPG|Other shapes; two \"egg-cups\" at rear\nReferences"
