It specializes in creating real-time strategy (RTS) games, particularly within the historical genre. Their contributions include the development of expansions and remastering of Age of Empires titles. In June 2022, Forgotten Empires was acquired by Keywords Studios.\nHistory\nForgotten Empires originated as a group of gamers who began working on a modification for Age of Empires II in 2012. Around the same time, Microsoft was in the process of creating a remastered HD edition of Age of Empires II. The mod was successful, prompting Microsoft to collaborate with the group to transform their project into an official expansion. This collaboration was announced in June 2013, with Microsoft revealing Forgotten Empires' involvement in the ongoing development of Age of Empires II: HD Edition. Subsequently, in collaboration with SkyBox Labs, the expansion titled Age of Empires II HD: The Forgotten was released a few months later.\nAfter this success, Forgotten Empires and Microsoft Studios co-developed The African Kingdoms and Rise of the Rajas, two further Age of Empires II HD expansion packs. They also contributed to Tale of the Dragon, an expansion for Age of Mythology, a spin-off game centered on mythology.\nAge of Empires: Definitive Edition was revealed by Forgotten Empires in 2017 during the Electronic Entertainment Expo PC Gaming Show. The game's release date was pushed back from October 19, 2017, to February 20, 2018. Through the Windows Store, Age of Empires: Definitive Edition was made accessible.  Forgotten Empires had co-developed multiple video games and expansions for the Age of Empires franchise with World's Edge, SkyBox Labs, and Relic Entertainment.\nIn June 2022, Keywords Studios acquired Forgotten Empires for $32.5 million. In 2023, World's Edge announced that a remastered version of Age of Mythology, Age of Mythology: Retold, is in development, with Forgotten Empires also co-developing it.\nGames and expansions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Title\n!Notes\n|-\n|2013\n|Age of Empires II HD: The Forgotten\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Co-developed with SkyBox Labs.\n|-\n|2014\n|Age of Mythology: Extended Edition\n|-\n|2015\n|Age of Empires II HD: The African Kingdoms\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2016\n|Age of Mythology: Tale of the Dragon\n|-\n|Age of Empires II HD: Rise of the Rajas\n|-\n|2018\n|Age of Empires: Definitive Edition\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Co-developed with Tantalus Media and Wicked Workshop\n|-\n|2019\n|Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition\n|-\n|2020\n|Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" |2021\n|Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition - Lords of the West\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Co-developed with World's Edge\n|-\n|Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition - United States Civilization\n|-\n|Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition - The African Royals\n|-\n|Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition - Dawn of the Dukes\n|-\n|Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition - Mexico Civilization\n|-\n|Age of Empires IV\n|Co-developed with World's Edge and Relic Entertainment\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2022\n|Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition - Dynasties of India\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Co-developed with World's Edge\n|-\n|Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition - Knights of the Mediterranean\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2023\n|Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition - Return of Rome\n|-\n|Age of Empires IV: The Sultans Ascend\n|Co-developed with World's Edge and Relic Entertainment\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2024\n|Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition – Victors and Vanquished\n| rowspan=\"9\" |Co-developed with World's Edge\n|-\n|Age of Mythology: Retold\n|-\n|Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition – Chronicles: Battle for Greece\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" |2025\n|Age of Mythology: Retold – Immortal Pillars\n|-\n|Age of Mythology: Retold – Heavenly Spear\n|-\n|Age of Empires IV – Knights of Cross and Rose\n|-\n|Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition – The Three Kingdoms\n|-\n|Age of Empires IV – Dynasties of the East\n|-\n|Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition – Chronicles: Alexander the Great\n|}\nReferences"
