It was last assigned to the Western Flying Training Command, and was disbanded on 16 June 1946 at Luke Field, Arizona.\nThere is no lineage between the United States Air Force 37th Training Wing, established on 22 December 1939 as the 37th Pursuit Group (Interceptor) at Albrook Army Airfield, Panama Canal Zone, and this organization.\nHistory\nThe wing directed Training Command Flight Schools in Arizona.  Most of the assigned schools provided phase II basic and phase II advanced flying training for Air Cadets, although the wing also commanded both contract basic (phase I) and Army schools.  Graduates of the advanced schools were commissioned as Second Lieutenants, received their \"wings\" and were reassigned to Operational or Replacement Training Units operated by one of the four numbered air fores in the zone of interior.\nAs training requirements changed during the war, schools were activated and inactivated or transferred to meet those requirements.\nLineage\n* Established as 37th Flying Training Wing on 17 December 1942\n: Activated on 8 January 1943\n: Disbanded 16 June 1946.\nAssignments\n*  AAF West Coast (later, AAF Western Flying) Training Center, 8 January 1943 – 16 June 1946\nTraining aircraft\nThe schools of the wing used a wide variety of planes to support its numerous training needs:\n* Primary training aircraft were the Boeing-Stearman PT-17 and Ryan PT-22.
