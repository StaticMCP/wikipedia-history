It had been 16 years since the previous appearance of the nation at the Summer Olympics, when it made its debut at the 1968 Games in Mexico City, Mexico. The Central African Republic was represented by three athletes; marathon runner Adolphe Ambowodé and two boxers, Dieudonné Kossi and Antoine Longoudé. There were no medals won by the trio.\nBackground\nThe Central African Republic made its debut in the Olympic Games at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, Mexico. The country has twice boycotted the Olympic Games, first was because of the inclusion of the New Zealand team at the 1976 Summer Olympics despite the breach of the international sports boycott of South Africa by the nation's rugby union team shortly prior. Then in 1980, the country was one of several who joined in with a United States led boycott over the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War. The highest number of Central African athletes entered in a team for an Olympics is 15, occurring at both the 1988 and 1992 Summer Olympics.\nFor the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, United States, the nation entered three male competitors; Adolphe Ambowodé in the marathon, and two boxers, lightweight Dieudonné Kossi and welterweight Antoine Longoudé.\nAthletics\nAmbowodé competed in the men's marathon, which took place at a course spread out across Los Angeles on 12 August. He finished in 70th position out of the 78 runners who completed the course, with a time of 2:41:26. He was over 31 minutes outside the fastest three finishers, who each completed the marathon with times of under 2 hours and 10 minutes. The overall winner was Portugal's Carlos Lopes (2:09:21).\n;Marathon\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Event\n!rowspan=2|Athlete\n!colspan=2|Race\n|-\n!Time\n!Rank\n|-\n|Men's marathon\n|Adolphe Ambowodé\n|align=center|2:41:26\n|align=center|70\n|}\nBoxing\nLongoudé fought in the first round of the welterweight tournament against Rudel Obreja of Romania.
