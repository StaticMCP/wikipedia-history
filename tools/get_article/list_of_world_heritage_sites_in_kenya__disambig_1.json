Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural heritage consists of natural features (physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty. Kenya accepted the convention on 10 July 1997, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As of 2024, there are eight World Heritage Sites in Kenya.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\nIn danger|outline=silver}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\"| Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\"| Location (county)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | UNESCO data\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| Year listed\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Fort Jesus, Mombasa\n|\n| Mombasa\n| 1295rev; ii, iv (cultural)\n| 2011\n| The late 16th century Portuguese fort was built to control the European trade routes in the Indian Ocean.
