Born on 16 October 1986 in Mangalia and raised in Neptun, Romania, she met native producing trio Play & Win and adopted a pop-rock style, which was later changed to minimal-infused house music. Inna is the recipient of five Balkan Music Awards, one European Border Breakers Award, three MTV Europe Music Awards for Best Romanian Act and fourteen Romanian Music Awards. Inna's debut studio album Hot, including her breakthrough single of the same name, was released in August 2009 and won the Romanian Music Award for Best Album.\nI Am the Club Rocker (2011), Inna's second record, was nominated for the same award at the 2012 Romanian Music Awards. The record featured the commercially successful single \"Sun Is Up\", which won the Eurodanceweb Award in 2010. It was the first time that a Romanian artist had received the award. Her third album Party Never Ends (2013) was nominated for the Romanian Music Awards for Best Album, and the same year, a collaboration with Moldovan musical project Carla's Dreams on \"P.O.H.U.I.\" received the Media Music Award for Best Zonga. Inna released her eponymous studio album in October 2015, which spawned several singles including \"Diggy Down\". The song topped the Romanian charts in 2014, and was awarded with Best Dance at the Media Music Awards.\nBalkan Music Awards\nThe Balkan Music Awards is an annual music award show hosted by Balkanika Music Television.
