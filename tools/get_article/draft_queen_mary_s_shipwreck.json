This event included a variety of walk-through haunted maze attractions, live music, dance parties, and various activities over fifteen years. The Shipwreck Halloween event was rebranded in 2010 to Queen Mary's Dark Harbor, following the discontinuation of Shipwreck in 2009.\nShipwreck was created by Eric Prevratil, son of the then president of the Queen Mary ship, Joseph Prevratil.\nHistory\nQueen Mary's Shipwreck: Halloween Terror Fest (\"Shipwreck\") began on Friday, October 13th 1995 and initially ran for nine nights. Shipwreck received its name from the creative company, Shipwreck Productions, that produced the event.\nShipwreck began with one maze titled \"Haunted Hull of Horrors.\" The initial admission fee for the event was $6.00.\nThe following year (1996), Queen Mary’s “Shipwreck explored its second year with an additional maze, the “Londontowne of Terror.”\nThe annual event ran for a total of twelve days.  In 1997, Shipwreck returned with a third maze, \"Decks of the Dead,\" and ran for a total of fifteen days. Tickets rose to a price of $13.  It is reported that ticket sales doubled from the previous year. 1998 was the first year that admission included unlimited access to the mazes.\nTwo years later (2000), Queen Mary's Shipwreck announced an all new 3-D attraction, the \"House of Hallucinations,\" for it's sixth annual event - totaling to six mazes within the hull of the ship, three on the ship, and two on shore in the Queen's Marketplace. According to the then ship's president,Joseph Prevratil, attendance increased an approximated 17,000 from the previous year, which was 55,000 above the norm then. The price is rated at $23. The Los Angeles Times criticized the lack of scare actors and mismatched theming, especially in comparison to other local haunts, including Knott's Scary Farm and Universal Halloween Horror Nights.\nIn 2001, Shipwreck required its scare actors to go through a boot-camp to hone their skills for the first time ever. Admission was $25 and ran for eleven total nights in October. Expansions continued until the year of 2004, whereby the Queen Mary's Shipwreck Halloween Terror Fest event celebrated its ten year anniversary.\nBy 2005, the entry fee rose to $30 and continued the traditions of previous years. The next year (2006), the Queen Mary's Shipwreck event displayed seven mazes, over 400 performers, two dance parties, and live music each night.\nShipwreck celebrated it 13th anniversary in the year 2007.  It did so by adding two new themed mazes, \"Revenge of the Reaper\" and \"Manor of Mayhem.\"  It is reported by Lovetta Kramer, the vice president of marketing and communications, that Shipwreck has become the largest event conducted on the Queen Mary ship each year.\nIn 2009, Queen Mary's Shipwreck celebrates its final year, following a \"revamped and re-intensified\" of the terror event, including \"live music, dancing, costumes, frightening effects and terrifying interactive attractions.\" The Queen Mary's Shipwreck Halloween Terror Fest ran for a total of fifteen years, concluding its the last day of operation on October 31st, 2009.  Queen Mary Shipwreck was succeeded by Queen Mary's Dark Harbor, which continues to this day.\nAttraction History\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:100%\"\n! colspan=\"6\" | Queen Mary's Shipwreck Attraction History\n|-\n! # !!
