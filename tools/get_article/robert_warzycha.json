He won two Polish Ekstraklasa titles and a Polish Super Cup with Górnik Zabrze. Warzycha was also a regular member of the Poland national team throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, amassing 47 caps.\nHe moved to the United States in 1996 and subsequently spent seven seasons in Major League Soccer with Columbus Crew. He later served as a coach for the team, serving as head coach for five seasons.\nClub career\nAfter beginning his career in his native Poland, Warzycha moved to England in March 1991 when Howard Kendall signed him for Everton in a £500,000 deal. He started well, scoring twice in his first eight games for Everton, and missing just five league games in the 1991–92.\nHe was one of only thirteen players not from the British Isles to play on the opening weekend of the FA Premier League along with Jan Stejskal, Peter Schmeichel, Andrei Kanchelskis, Roland Nilsson, Eric Cantona, Hans Segers, John Jensen, Anders Limpar, Gunnar Halle, Craig Forrest, Michel Vonk and Ronnie Rosenthal and was also the first player from mainland Europe to score in the Premier League, finding the net in Everton's second Premier League game - a 3–0 away win over Manchester United. His goal was the only one scored by a Polish player in the competition until Marcin Wasilewski scored in January 2015, more than 22 years later.\nHis goal against Manchester United in a 3–0 win at Old Trafford proved to be his last goal for Everton. He fell out of favour later that season and played just seven times in the 1993–94 season, and was clearly not part of new manager Mike Walker's plans when he arrived at Goodison Park in January 1994 following the resignation of Howard Kendall. He went to Hungary at the end of the season to sign for Pécsi Mecsek. A year later, he was sold to Kispest Honvéd FC of Hungary.\nIn 1996, he joined Columbus Crew for the Major League Soccer's inaugural year. Warzycha became a staple in the lineup for five seasons, and then a bit player in his final two, as he battled injuries. He retired as the Crew's all-time assist leader with 61 and also scored 19 goals in MLS league play. During his playing days in Columbus, Warzycha was known as \"The Polish Rifle,\" in part because of his accuracy from free kicks. On 25 March 2000, Warzycha scored the first-ever regular-season \"Golden Goal\" in Major League Soccer history to defeat the San Jose Earthquakes 2–1. He played two more years for Columbus Crew before retiring from playing in 2002 at the age of 39.[http://web.mlsnet.com/t102/load.jsp?section=about&content=timeline Columbus Crew: About: timeline]\nInternational career\nFor Poland, Warzycha was capped 47 times, scoring seven goals between 1987 and 1993.\nManagerial career\nAfter retiring as a player, he became an assistant coach with the Crew. After Greg Andrulis was fired in July 2005, Warzycha assumed interim head coaching duty. He went back to assisting after Sigi Schmid was hired for the full-time job. He now coaches the 2012 and 2013 NAL teams at Club Ohio.\nAfter spending several years as Schmid's assistant, Warzycha was promoted to the head coach position at Columbus Crew for the 2009 MLS season, in which he coached the team to the Supporter Shield, awarded for the most points during the regular season. Warzycha signed a multi-year contract extension with Columbus on 1 September 2011 that kept him under contract through the 2013 season. He was released from his contract early, on 2 September 2013.\nPersonal life\nRobert is the father of professional soccer player Konrad Warzycha, who played for Columbus Crew under his father.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by national team and year\n|-\n!National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|Poland\n|1987||1||0\n|-\n|1988||6||1\n|-\n|1989||6||1\n|-\n|1990||15||3\n|-\n|1991||7||1\n|-\n|1992||7||0\n|-\n|1993||5||1\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total!!47!!7\n|}\nHonours\nPlayer\nGórnik Zabrze\n* Ekstraklasa: 1987–88\n* Polish Super Cup: 1988\nBudapest Honvéd\n* Magyar Kupa: 1995–96\nColumbus Crew\n* U.S. Open Cup: 2002\nIndividual\n* MLS All-Star: 1997, 1999\nManager\nColumbus Crew\n* Supporters' Shield: 2009\nReferences\n}}"
