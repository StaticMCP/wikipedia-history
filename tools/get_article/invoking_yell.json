It went on to play on such other film festivals as Panic Fest, and the Chattanooga Film Festival, as well as Popcorn Frights Film Festival in Florida, Miami. By July 28, 2023, Welcome Villain acquired the film's North America and international distribution rights for territories.\nProduction\nThe film was independently financed and shot in Los Lleuques by Vallastudio Films, on a very small budget. It was a three-day shoot, with a month of pre-production and a post-production stage of six months. In an interview with The Pit magazine, Valladares said:\n''\"I'll start by saying that filming the movie was quite a wild ride. We shot the entire film in just three days. We began on a Thursday and wrapped up on Saturday. The crew consisted of only three people plus the actresses. Since it was a documentary-style film, we had a lot of creative freedom when it came to shooting. Now, filming at night in a forest was challenging. Our only source of light was an LED light on the camera, so we had only a few meters of illuminated area. It was complex, but it turned out to be a lot of fun. Many scenes were shot behind the cabin where we were staying, though in the film, it looks like we were deep in the mountains. I divided all the nighttime scenes in the film into two days of shooting. I believe we managed to capture some really unsettling moments, where the silence and the sound of the trees rustling in the wind were the main focus\".\nReception\nCritical response\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a weighted average score of 86%. Its critical consensus says, \"Invoking Yell'' In Patricio Valladares' found footage ghost story/freakout psychodrama, three women try to put black metal on the Chilean map.\"\nMichelle Swope of Bloody Disgusting commended the film for \"Elements of the supernatural and occult rituals and riveting performances make the final act of Invoking Yell shocking, anxiety-inducing, and genuinely horrifying. Fans of found footage will especially enjoy this film.\". Mary Beth McAndrews, writing for Dread Central, stated that the film \"'Invoking Yell' is violent, creepy, and a shining example of contemporary international found footage.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* [https://foundfootagehorrormovies.com/2024/10/02/invoking-yell-review-2023/ Invoking Yell] at [https://foundfootagehorrormovies.com/2024/10/02/invoking-yell-review-2023/ Found Footage Horror Movies]"
