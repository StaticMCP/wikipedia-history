Both terms are usually translated into English as \"army group\" but refer to different concepts.\nDifferences between Heeresgruppe and Armeegruppe\nSome German formations, such as Army Group A, were known as Heeresgruppe, whereas others, such as Army Group Liguria, were known as Armeegruppe. Both of these terms have, for a lack of alternatives, been translated into English as \"army group\". Generally, the major army groups were Heeresgruppen, whereas the term Armeegruppe was used for formations that contained between two and three armies, initially reserved for those formations that included non-German armies. For instance, Army Group Balck contained the 6th German Army and the 3rd Hungarian Army.\nHeeresgruppen\nThe Heeresgruppen-type army groups of the Wehrmacht were:\n* Army Group A\n* Army Group B\n* Army Group C\n* Army Group D\n* Army Group E\n* Army Group F\n* Army Group G\n* Army Group H\n* Army Group Africa (Heeresgruppe Afrika)\n* Army Group Don\n* Army Group Courland (Heeresgruppe Kurland)\n* Army Group Centre (Heeresgruppe Mitte)\n* Army Group North (Heeresgruppe Nord)\n* Army Group North Ukraine (Heeresgruppe Nordukraine)\n* Army Group Ostmark (Heeresgruppe Ostmark)\n* Army Group South (Heeresgruppe Süd)\n* Army Group South Ukraine (Heeresgruppe Südukraine)\n* Army Group Upper Rhine (Heeresgruppe Oberrhein)\n* Army Group Vistula (Heeresgruppe Weichsel)\nContinuities of the Heeresgruppen\nThere were numerous redesignations applied to the Heeresgruppen-type army groups, which often overlapped with each other. For instance, \"Army Group South\" of the Invasion of Poland became \"Army Group A\" of the Western Campaign, which became \"Army Group Center\" during Operation Barbarossa. \"Army Group North\" during the Invasion of Poland became \"Army Group B\" in the west and then \"Army Group South\" in the east. \"Army Group C\" during the Polish and French campaigns became \"Army Group North\" during the Soviet campaign. The following diagram attempts to show what Heeresgruppe was renamed how and when.\nThe colors stand for the theaters of war: Invasion of Poland in pink, Battle of France in blue, Balkans campaign in purple, North Africa in orange, Eastern Front in red, Italian front in green, Western Front in yellow.\nImageSize  = width:1080 height:420\nPlotArea   = width:965 height:360 left:35 bottom:20\nAlignBars  = early\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy                      # European date format\nPeriod     = from:01/01/1939 till:08/05/1945 #\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:1 start:01/01/1939\nScaleMinor = grid:blue unit:month increment:3 start:01/09/1939\nPlotData=\ncolor:pink width:15\nbar:N from:01/09/1939 till:10/10/1939 text:AG North\ncolor:blue width:15\nbar:N from:15/10/1939 till:17/06/1941 text:AG B\ncolor:red width:15\nbar:N from:22/06/1941 till:20/01/1945 text:AG Center\nbar:N from:25/01/1945 till:08/05/1945 text:AG North\ncolor:pink width:15\nbar:S from:01/09/1939 till:20/10/1939 text:AG South\ncolor:blue width:15\nbar:S from:25/10/1939 till:17/06/1941 text:AG A\ncolor:red width:15\nbar:S from:22/06/1941 till:04/07/1942 text:AG South\nbar:S from:09/07/1942 till:04/02/1943 text:AG B\nbar:S from:09/02/1943 till:01/04/1944 text:AG South\nbar:S from:06/04/1944 till:17/09/1944 text:N.

Its commander was additionally known as Oberbefehlshaber West after 15 March 1941.\n* Operation Barbarossa (June 1941) initiated the German-Soviet War and was conducted by three army groups: Army Group North, Army Group Centre, and Army Group South.\n* For Case Blue (summer 1942), Army Group South was split into Army Groups A and B, with Army Group A facing the Caucasus and Army Group B covering the northern approach.\n* In November 1942, Army Group Don was inserted between Army Groups A and B. It was dissolved, shortly after the end of the Battle of Stalingrad, on 12 February 1943.\n* On 1 January 1943, Army Group E was formed to oversee the German occupation in the Balkans.\n* On 22 February 1943, the remnant German forces of the North African campaign were briefly combined into Army Group Afrika. It ceased to exist shortly after on 13 May 1943.\n* On 9 March 1943, Army Group B was renamed Army Group South.\n* On 17 July 1943, a new Army Group B was formed in southern Germany and northern Italy. It was later sent to German-occupied France on 1 December 1943.\n* On 26 July 1943, a new Army Group C was formed in Italy to manage the Italian campaign.\n* On 12 August 1943, Army Group F was formed in the Balkans.\n* On 31 March 1944, Army Group A was renamed Army Group South Ukraine and Army Group South was renamed Army Group North Ukraine.\n* On 28 April 1944, Army Group G was formed in German-occupied southern France.\n* On 20 September 1944, Army Group South Ukraine was renamed Army Group South and Army Group North Ukraine was renamed Army Group A.\n* On 11 November 1944, Army Group H was formed in the German-occupied Netherlands.\n* On 25 January 1945, several redesignations took place: Army Group A became Army Group Centre, Army Group Centre became Army Group North, Army Group North (now trapped in the Courland Pocket) became Army Group Courland. A new army group, Army Group Vistula, was inserted between Army Groups North (previously Army Group Centre) and Army Group Centre (previously Army Group A).\n* In April 1945, Army Group South was redesignated Army Group Ostmark.\nSee also\n* List of World War II military units of Germany\n* List of German corps in World War II\n* List of German divisions in World War II\n* List of German brigades in World War II\nReferences"
