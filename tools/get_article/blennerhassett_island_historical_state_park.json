The property was the site of a Palladian mansion owned by Harman Blennerhassett, a participant in some of the alleged intrigues of Aaron Burr, and his wife Margaret Agnew.  While the original mansion burned to the ground in 1811, a detailed replica, which can be toured, was built on its foundations in the 1980s. The Blennerhasset Mansion is built in a Federal architectural style with, Palladian attributes.\nThe park is accessed via sternwheeler riverboat from Point Park on 2nd Street in Parkersburg, West Virginia.
