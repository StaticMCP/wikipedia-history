It was founded in 1949 after the incorporation of Xinjiang into the People's Republic of China. In 1955, it was replaced by the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.\nHistory\nDuring the final stages of the Chinese Civil War, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) held a decisive advantage, while the Nationalist Army suffered successive defeats. After the First Field Army, commanded by Peng Dehuai, captured Lanzhou and subsequently the entire Gansu province on August 26, 1949, the military and political leaders of Xinjiang Province, including Tao Zhiyue and Burhan Shahidi, declared an uprising against the ROC government. Zhang Zhizhong, who had already sided with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), mediated the conflict, while Deng Liqun served as the CCP's negotiator. That same year, the Soviet Union ordered the insurgents to halt their advance into Dihua (now Ürümqi) and surrender to the People's Republic of China. On September 25, the First Army Corps of the First Field Army, led by General Wang Zhen, captured Dihua, making Xinjiang a province of the People's Republic of China. On December 17, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government was established, with Burhan Shahidi as its first chairman.\nOn September 13, 1955, the 21st meeting of the Standing Committee of the 1st National People's Congress decided to abolish Xinjiang Province and establish the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, with the original administrative area of ​​Xinjiang Province as its administrative area. On October 1, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region was established, and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region People's Committee was subsequently established. Xinjiang became one of China's five provincial-level minority autonomous regions, and the name \"Xinjiang Province\" became history.\nDemographics\nAccording to the 1953 Chinese census published by the National Bureau of Statistics on November 1, 1954, as of June 30, 1953, the population of Xinjiang Province was 4,873,608, of which 3,640,125 were Uyghurs, accounting for three-quarters of the total population of Xinjiang Province, while Han and other ethnic groups accounted for one-quarter.\nAdministrative divisions\nIn 1954, Xinjiang Province comprised 1 administrative region, 10 special districts, 5 autonomous prefectures, 1 provincial-level city, 2 cities, 73 counties, and 6 autonomous counties.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+The administrative divisions of Xinjiang Province in 1954\n!Prefecture-level cities and special districts\n!Number of counties and districts\n!Administrative center\n!County name (county seat)\n|-\n|Ürümqi\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Ürümqi Special Zone\n|8 counties, 1 autonomous county\n|Ürümqi\n|Fukang County (urban area), Shanshan County (urban area), Qitai County (urban area), Hutubi County (urban area), Turpan County (urban area), Jimsar County (urban area), Manas County (urban area), Toksun County (urban area), Muleihe Kazakh Autonomous County (urban area)\n|-\n|Hami Special Zone\n|2 counties, 1 autonomous county\n|Hami County\n|Hami County (urban area), Yiwu County (urban area), Barkol Kazakh Autonomous County (urban area)\n|-\n|Korla Special Zone\n|5 counties\n|Korla County\n|Korla County (urban area), Yuli County (urban area), Luntai County (urban area), Ruoqiang County (urban area), Qiemo County (urban area)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Southern Xinjiang Administrative Office\n| rowspan=\"5\" |1 city, 26 counties, and 1 autonomous county\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Kashgar\n|Kashgar Prefecture (headquartered in Kashgar City): Kashgar City, Shufu County (urban area), Shule County (urban area), Bachu County (urban area), Yingjisha County (urban area), Yuepuhu County (urban area), Jiashi County (urban area), Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County (urban area).\n|-\n|Shache Special Zone (based in Shache County): Shache County (urban area), Zepu County (urban area), Yecheng County (urban area), Maigati County (urban area)\n|-\n|Hotan Special District (based in Hotan County): Hotan County (urban area), Ceqin County (urban area), Pishan County (urban area), Minfeng County (urban area), Luopu County (urban area), Yutian County (urban area), Moyu County (urban area)\n|-\n|Aksu Special District (headquartered in Aksu County): Aksu County (urban area), Kuqa County (urban area), Shaya County (urban area), Uqturpan County (urban area), Xinhe County (urban area), Awat County (urban area), Wensu County (urban area), Keping County (urban area), Baicheng County (urban area)\n|-\n|Kizilsu Kyrgyz Autonomous Region (headquartered in Artush County): Artush County (urban area), Wuqia County (urban area), Akqi County (urban area)\n|-\n|Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture\n|3 counties\n|Changji County\n|Changji County (urban area), Miquan County (urban area), Ürümqi County (urban area)\n|-\n|Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture\n|2 counties, 1 autonomous county\n|Yanqi Hui Autonomous County\n|Hejing County (urban area), Heshuo County (urban area), and Yanqi Hui Autonomous County (urban area)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture\n| rowspan=\"4\" |1 city, 24 counties, 2 autonomous counties\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Yining City\n|Ili Prefecture (headquartered in Yining City): Yining City, Yining County (Yining City), Tekes County (urban area), Suiding County (urban area), Zhaosu County (urban area), Xinyuan County (urban area), Gongliu County (urban area), Huocheng County (urban area), Nileke County (urban area), and Chabuchar Xibe Autonomous County (urban area).\n|-\n|Tacheng Special District (located in Tacheng County): Tacheng County (urban area), Shawan County (urban area), Emin County (urban area), Wusu County (urban area), Yumin County (urban area), Tuoli County (urban area), and Hoboksar Mongol Autonomous County (urban area).\n|-\n|Altay Special District (headquartered in Altay County): Altay County (urban area), Fuhai County (urban area), Jimunai County (urban area), Qinghe County (urban area), Habahe County (urban area), Fuyun County (urban area), Bulinjin County (urban area).\n|-\n|Bortala Mongol Autonomous Region (seat in Bole County): Bole County (urban area), Jinghe County (urban area), Wenquan County (urban area)\n|}\nPolitics\nIn 1949, after the Xinjiang Provincial Government of the Republic of China surrendered to the Chinese Communist Party, it was replaced by the newly established Xinjiang Provincial People's Government on December 17 of the same year.
