At centralised and local events, patriotic speeches were held and songs such as Heil dir im Siegerkranz, the unofficial anthem of the empire were sung. Celebrations also took place publicly during the Weimar Republic (1919–1933) and with the participation of high dignitaries. Nazi Germany only celebrated the founding of the German Empire in the beginning.\nEast Germany completely abolished this custom. On 18 January 1971, West Germany issued a motif of special stamps for the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Empire on 30 Pfennig stamps (Michel catalogue 658 and 385) designed by the Deutsche Bundespost Berlin. This corresponded to the rate for a standard letter at the time. On 24 November 1971, a commemorative coin was struck with a nominal value of five Deutsche Marks which paid tribute to the same event.\nSome adherents of the political right continued this tradition. Also, some student connections celebrated Reichsgründungskneipen (Imperial Founding Pubs).\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-11061, Berlin, Reichsgründungsfeier, Festgottesdienst.jpg|Reichspräsident Paul von Hindenburg leaving the Berlin Cathedral after the celebrations in 1931.\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-14231, Berlin, Reichsgründungsfeier der Universität.jpg|Rudolf Smend speaking in 1933 at the celebrations in the auditorium of Berlin's Humboldt University.\nFile:DBP 1971 658 100 Jahre Reichsgründung.jpg|Deutsche Bundespost (1971) issued this stamp on the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Empire - an imperial eagle with the imperial crown.\nSee also\n* Proclamation of the German Empire (paintings)\n* Unification of Germany\nFurther reading\n* Fritz Schellack: Nationalfeiertage in Deutschland von 1871 bis 1945.
