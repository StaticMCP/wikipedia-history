      "text": "# The Coldest Winter: America and the Korean War\n\n}}\nThe Coldest Winter: America and the Korean War is a non-fiction book by the author David Halberstam. It was published posthumously in 2007, after his sudden death in a traffic collision at the age of 73.\nThe book was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for History in 2008.\nSubject\nThe book, written more than half a century after the Korean War, looks at the war from a different perspective than previously written works on the war by various authors.\nQuotes pay homage to an earlier Korean War author T. R. Fehrenbach, and The Coldest Winter mentions Fehrenbach's combat experience, something that Fehrenbach never mentions for himself in his seminal work, This Kind of War.\nReception\nCharles J. Hanley, in a 2017 review of a different book, was critical of the lack of attention paid to civilian casualties in The Coldest Winter.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.c-span.org/video/?201269-11/korean-war-veterans-panel Panel discussion at the Library of Congress on The Coldest War with U.S. Army veterans of the Korean War, September 29, 2007]\n*[https://www.c-span.org/video/?201297-1/the-coldest-winter TimesTalks panel discussion on The Coldest War with Dexter Filkins, Frances FitzGerald, Leslie H.
