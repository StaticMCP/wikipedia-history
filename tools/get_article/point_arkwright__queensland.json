In the , Point Arkwright had a population of 309 people.\nGeography\nThe suburb takes its name from the headland Point Arkwright, the most easterly part of the suburb ().\nThe David Low Way enters the locality from the south (Yaroomba) and exits to the north (Coolum Beach).\nThe land use is a mixture of suburban housing and parkland.\nHistory\nThe headland Point Arkwright was originally called Petrie Heads after the first settler of Brisbane Andrew Petrie who had explored this region of Southern Queensland in the early 1840s.\nThe headland being named as Point Arkwright would appear to post-date 1861 as that is the year that Lt. Heath RN named the associated headland of Point Cartwright as Point Raper. As both Point Cartwright and Point Arkwright are thought to have been named together in recognition of the English inventors, it would have to have been some time after 1861 when Point Raper was being used for Point Cartwright. The Point Arkwright name is believed to be named after Sir Richard Arkwright, who invented the machinery for cotton spinning factories. It is not known who bestowed the Point Arkwright name as it was obviously intended to be grouped with Point Cartwright, which was named after Edmund Cartwright who developed weaving and combing equipment which complement Arkwright's inventions. The name Point Arkwright was in use from at least 1864.\nDemographics\nIn the , Point Arkwright had a population of 273 people.\nIn the , Point Arkwright had a population of 309 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Point Arkwright.
