He was educated at Chermside and Wooloowin State Schools and the Commercial High School. In World War II he served in 143rd Australian General Transport Company from 1942 and then joined the RAAF the next year where he achieved the rank of Flying officer and serving in England and Canada. He was discharged in February 1946 and took up work at the family leather manufacturing in Kedron.\nPolitical career\nAt the 1950 state election, Dewar contested the new seat of Chermside for the Liberal Party and defeated Labor's J.B. Macarthur. He held the seat until it was abolished for the 1960 election. He then won the seat of Wavell, holding it until his defeat in 1969.\nDuring his time in Parliament he was Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Problems of Youth (1957-1959), Minister for Labour and Industry (1963-1965), Minister for Industrial Development (1965-1967) and deputy leader of the Liberal Party in 1965.\nHe was forced to resign as Minister for Industrial Development in 1967 for allegedly \"kissing and certain other actions\" with two girls from the Department of Labor and Tourism. Dewar was outraged at the accusations and accused departmental public servants of spreading the story. He resigned from the Liberal Party in August 1968 and sat as an Independent Liberal for the last year of his parliamentary career.\nPersonal life\nOn the 16 Nov 1946, Dewar married Ailsa Marjorie Drain (died 1991) and together had one son and one daughter.\nDewar died in January 1995 and was cremated at Albany Creek Memorial Park Crematorium.\nReferences"
