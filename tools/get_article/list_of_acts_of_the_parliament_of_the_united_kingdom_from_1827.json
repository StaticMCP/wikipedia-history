For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\nAll modern acts have a short title, e.g. the Local Government Act 2003.  Some earlier acts also have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n7 & 8 Geo. 4\nContinuing the first session of the 8th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 14 November 1826 until 2 July 1827.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 7 & 8 G. 4.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  for the better Regulation of the Manufacture of Ounce Thread.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  for rendering the Payment of Creditors more equal and expeditious in Scotland.|note4= }}\n|  for the Advance of Money for carrying on Public Works in Ireland.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  for regulating the Costs of certain Distresses.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  for regulating Vessels carrying Passengers to Foreign Parts.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  for providing for the repairing, maintaining, and keeping in repair certain Roads and Bridges in Ireland.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n| or the Criminal Statutes (England) Repeal Act 1827|public|27|21-06-1827|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act for repealing various Statutes in England relative to the Benefit of Clergy, and to Larceny and other Offences connected therewith, and to malicious Injuries to Property, and to Remedies against the Hundred.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  respecting deserted Children in Ireland.|note4= }}\n|  of such Elections.}}\n|  }}\n|  and of King George the Second, as relate to the settling the Rates of the Carriage of Goods.|note4= }}\n|  relating to Duties of Excise on Crown, flint, and Phial Glass, and to alter certain Laws of Excise relating to Flint Glass.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| or the Union of Parishes Act 1827|public|43|23-06-1827|archived=n|An Act to consolidate and amend the Laws in force in Ireland for Unions and Divisions of Parishes, and for uniting or disappropriating Appropriate Parishes or Parts of Parishes;
