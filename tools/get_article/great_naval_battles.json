It consist of five separate games, four of which  depict various phases of World War II. Each game combines a wider view of the action on a fleet scale, as well as controls for individual ships. SSI covered similar themes in another naval game, Fighting Steel, which was released afterwards, in 1999.\nGames in series\nThe game series contains the following games:\n:* Great Naval Battles: North Atlantic 1939-1943 was released in 1992 and depicts naval warfare in the North Atlantic during World War 2.\n:* Great Naval Battles: Guadalcanal 1942-1943 depicts naval combat in the Pacific Ocean during World War 2.\n:* Great Naval Battles Vol. III: Fury in the Pacific, 1941–1944 is a direct sequel to #2 and depicts the remainder of the Pacific Ocean war. It was not considered to be as strong a product as the previous two games, as it had some problems with bugs. the game structure was problematic due to some attempts to include air combat.\n:* Great Naval Battles 4: Burning Steel 1939–1942 was released in 1995 and constituted a major overhaul of the game. It utilized entirely new procedures and interfaces. Several new features were provided, including the ability to full customize each combat scenario.\n:* Great Naval Battles V: Demise of the Dreadnoughts; 1914–18 is set in World War I, and does not include aircraft.
