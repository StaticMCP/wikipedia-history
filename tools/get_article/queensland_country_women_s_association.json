The association seeks to serve the interests of women and children in rural areas in Australia through a network of local branches. Established in 1922, local branches provide friendship and mutual support to their members while contributing to the betterment of life in their local communities. Over time, many branches have evolved to include support for wider issues such as domestic violence campaigns and fund-raising for international initiatives such as orphanages.\nIn 2019 the QWCA received a Queensland Greats Award from the Queensland Government.\nHistory\nOn 8–11 August 1922, the Brisbane Women's Club held an open conference for countrywomen in Brisbane's Albert Hall during the Exhibition (a time when many country people visited Brisbane). The conference was opened by Lady Forster, wife of Australian Governor-General and the Queensland Governor Matthew Nathan attended. On 11 August 1922, the outcome of the conference was to establish the Queensland Country Women's Association. Ruth Fairfax was elected the first president.\nThe first meeting of the Toowoomba branch was held at the Toowoomba Town Hall on 12 September 1922. Fairfax attended and spoke about the objectives of the organisation. The meeting resolved to hold a conference as soon as there were sufficient representatives to attend.\nThe objectives of the association were broad but included some specific items:\n1. To improve welfare and conditions of women and children in the country\n2. To draw together all women, girls, and children in Country Districts.\n3. To bring opportunities for recreation and enjoyment within reach of all Members.\n4. To encourage the active study of Local, Municipal and State affairs and to promote a wise and kindly spirit.\n5. To improve educational facilities in the Country.\n6. To secure better provision for the safeguarding of Public Health especially of children, and the securing of more adequate Medical and Hospital facilities for Country Districts.\nThere was a call for a design for a badge and the winner was Mabel Chandler of Burra Burri who proposed the letters CWA within a large letter \"Q\"; this design is still used as the organisation's logo. It was decided that the silver and royal blue should be adopted as the colours for the organisation. Many QCWA buildings or 'rest rooms' are painted royal blue and white to approximate the chosen colours.\nIn the 1930s the association held the motto \"With loyalty to the Throne, service to the country, through country women, by country women, for country women\".  By 1950 this was given as \"Honour to God, Loyalty to the Throne, Service to the country, Through country women, By country women, For country women\".\nA creed was also made:\n::I would be true, for there are those who trust me; I would be pure, for there are those who care; I would be strong for there is much to suffer; I would be brave, for there is much to dare.\n::I would be friend to all—the foe—the friendless; I would be giving and forget the gift; I would be humble, for I know my weakness; I would look up—and laugh—and love—and lift.\nBranches were grouped within a division, within the State body.  Western Division included Roma and Trenhed.  The Southern Region was rearranged by 1945 to form new divisions such as the Gympie and South Burnett.  The new Maranoa Division looked after 29 branches including Dalby and Wandoan.\nQueensland's Younger Sets were formed by April 1928 in Warwick, with the QCWA Bundaberg Younger Set established in mid-2008.  Membership is for girls and women up to 25 years-of-age, although one set in 1930 allowed 'any girl or unmarried woman' as eligible for membership.\nIn 2012 the QWC celebrated its 90th birthday.\nThe Queensland chapter was inducted into the Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame in 2013.\nIn 2017 the QWCA created its own perfume, '1922', to mark its 95th anniversary. It was released at 2017 Ekka and was developed by Damask Perfumery in Brisbane. The artwork and branding of the bottle was supplied by Brisbane watercolour artist Michelle Grayson.\nIn 2019 the QWCA received a Queensland Greats Award from the Queensland Government.\nIn 2022 the QCWA celebrated their centenary year.  As part of the celebrations, in early February, the Perth Mint launched a $1 coin commemorating the centenary in Queensland and New South Wales.  Other intended events were ongoing displays celebrating the achievements of early members, and attending Parliament House and raising concerns affecting women and families across Queensland.\nBranches\nAs at December 2018, the QWCA had over 240 branches throughout Queensland. The following list includes all branches active in December 2018, and some of the former branches.
