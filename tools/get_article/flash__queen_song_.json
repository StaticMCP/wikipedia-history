Written by guitarist Brian May, \"Flash\" is the theme song of the 1980 film Flash Gordon.\nThere are two versions of the song. The album version (\"'''Flash's Theme'''\") is in fact the start to the film, with all the dialogue from the first scene. The single version contains dialogue cut from various parts of the film, most memorably, Brian Blessed's character Prince Vultan exclaiming \"Gordon's alive?!\" This version was also included on the Greatest Hits compilation from 1981.\nThe song's lead vocals are shared by May and Freddie Mercury, with Roger Taylor adding high harmonies. May plays most of the instruments, except for the bass guitar and drums. He used an Imperial Bösendorfer piano (with 97 keys instead of 88, having an extra octave on the low range), an Oberheim OB-X synthesizer (as seen in the song's music video), and his homemade Red Special electric guitar.\nThe song reached number 10 on the UK Singles Chart and number three in Germany. On the U.S. charts, \"Flash's Theme aka Flash\" reached number 42 on the Billboard Hot 100.  It peaked at number 39 on the Cash Box Top 100.\nRecord World described the single version as a \"supersonic cut with a chorus hook guaranteed to rescue tired holiday ears.\"\nMusic video\nThe music video was filmed at Advision Studios, London, in November 1980 and directed by Don Norman and shows the band performing the song to a screen showing clips from the film Flash Gordon. An alternative version broadcast during the Concert for Kampuchea in 1981 with different clips included on the Flash Gordon 2011 iTunes edition.\nPersonnel\n*Freddie Mercury – lead and backing vocals\n*Brian May – lead and backing vocals, guitars, piano, synthesizer\n*Roger Taylor – drums, backing vocals, timpani\n*John Deacon – bass guitar\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1980–1981)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia (Kent Music Report)\n| 16\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Canada RPM Top Singles\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|24\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |Italy (Musica e dischi)\n|14\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|US Cash Box Top 100\n| released   =\n| recorded   =\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      =\n| length     = 3:03 (radio mix)\n| label      =\n* Frisbee Tracks\n* Virgin\n* Nebula\n| writer     = Brian May\n| producer   = Vanguard\n| chronology = Queen\n| prev_title = We Will Rock You\n| prev_year  = 2000\n| next_title = Another One Bites the Dust (The Miami Project Remixes)\n| next_year  = 2006\n| misc       = }}\n}}\nGerman producers Vanguard released a cover of \"Flash\", credited to \"Queen + Vanguard\", on 10 February 2003.

Runk (Brandon McKnight), mentioning that he has been saving the song \"for the right moment\".\nIn 2016, a re-recording of the song was used to advertise Flash Multi Surface Concentrated Cleaner in the UK. It has since been used to promote other Flash products. In 2022, the song appeared in a Toyota Corolla Cross commercial in Australia but it used \"Cross\" instead of \"Flash\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/discography/flash-gordon/#lyrics Lyrics at Queen official website]  (original version, reprise, single version)"
