He was baptised with the name of Thomas Evelyn Ellis, and was known within his family as \"Tommy\". Educated at Eton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1917 he assumed the surname Scott-Ellis by Royal Licence.\nMilitary career\nCommissioned into the 10th Hussars as a second-lieutenant on 19 April 1899, and honorary colonel of the Royal Scots Fusiliers, he saw active military service in the Second Boer War and was promoted to lieutenant on 1 April 1900. Following the end of that war, he retired from active service in August 1902. He was appointed a captain (supernumerary) in the 2nd County of London Yeomanry (Westminster Dragoons) on 13 September 1902. Scott-Ellis resumed active military service during World War I, being promoted Major in the Royal Tank Corps.\nCollecting and interests\n, Wrexham, Wales]]\nAfter succeeding to his family titles in 1899 he received his inherited estates when he came of age in 1901. This included the Howard de Walden Estate in Marylebone, London and earned him the title of 'Britain's wealthiest bachelor'. His fortune derived from his grandmother's estates which she had inherited as daughter of the Duke of Portland. The relatively small Ellis family estates, built on slavery and sugar estates in Jamaica, primarily Montpelier, Jamaica  had been conveyed by his grandmother to his uncle, Evelyn Henry Ellis, in 1891.\nHoward de Walden took a lease on Audley End House, Essex which had once belonged to his ancestors, in 1904 but reportedly never felt settled there. The artist Auguste Rodin created a bust of him in 1906 which is held in the collection kept at the Rodin Museum in Philadelphia. He purchased 'Croesnewydd hall' near Wrexham in 1929 which had been the home of his ancestors; that in between leasing Chirk Castle, Denbighshire from 1911 in preparation for his marriage, which became his main residence after World War I until 1946; and where he learned the Welsh language, he also spent time at 'Plas Llanina', Ceredigion.\nThe Barony also inherited Dean Castle in Kilmarnock via inheritance from his grandmother, the 6th Baron's wife, 'Lady Lucy Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck'.\nA great sportsman, he was back up for the British fencing team at the 'Intercalated games' at Athens, 1906. He was a member of a Jockey club between 1905–1924, and had passions for horse-racing and sailing. He interested in powerboats, and was crew member of the Dylan he participated in the first and only motor boat competitions at the Olympics of 1908 in London. His steam yacht, Branwen,  length overall, launched 28 October 1905 was the first vessel built at the John I. Thornycroft & Company's Woolston yard.\nIn 1914, he provided financial support for the creation of Crab Tree Club in London and also in that year he was one of the people \"blessed\" in Wyndham Lewis's Blast Magazine.\nScott-Ellis had been awarded the a degree of LL.D. honoris causa by the University of Wales, he was President of the National Museum of Wales also a governor in the National Library of Wales. In addition, he was chairman of the British Empire Academy.\nHe had also been made a trustee of the Tate Gallery in 1938 and served as president of the Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales from 1931 to 1945. In 1934, he served as treasurer of the Royal Salop Infirmary in Shrewsbury.\nHoward de Walden became a keen heraldist and genealogist, as well as amassing one of the most extensive collections of British armour, most of which is now on display at Dean Castle, Kilmarnock.\nAugustus John, in his memoirs, recalls visiting de Walden at Chirk Castle and being \"greatly impressed to find our host one morning, clad, cap-à-pie, in a suit of ancient armour and reading his newspaper.\"\nHoward de Walden was also an author, who produced several operas under the pseudonym of T. E. Ellis.  Ellis approached composer Joseph Holbrooke with his \"Dylan - Son of the Wave\". his resulted in the composition of the opera \"Dylan\", first performed at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London, conducted by Artur Nikisch, on 4 July 1914. The staging included another technological wonder:\n\"In this work, in order to get convincing flights of wild fowl, films were made in the Outer Hebrides and projected on to the stage. This, of course, was in the days of the silent film, when there was no means of deadening the whirr or hum of the projector and the films themselves resolved into a series of flicks. The scoring, however, was vivid enough to cover the sounds, and this incipient film music was infinitely more successful than some of the over-vaunted high-level scores heard to-day. The theatre, however, was not ready for such an innovation, and the extra-musical effects were not taken seriously.\" (See Joseph Holbrooke  Wikipedia entry).\nCollaboration on two further operas, \"The Children of Don\" (first performed at the London Opera House, conducted by Arthur Nikisch, on 15 June 1912 - postponed from 12 June) and \"Bronwen\", brought about the completion of Holbrooke's most ambitious project, a trilogy under the collective title \"The Cauldron of Annwn\" setting Scott-Ellis' versions of tales from the Welsh \"Mabinogion\". Until his death in 1946, Scott-Ellis effectively acted as patron to Holbrooke, subsidising performances and publication of many of his works.His passion was to do with literature from the medieval period, especially Welsh literature. He participated in writing in the National Eisteddfod of Wales, in particular to do with the fables of the Mabinogion.\nDispute with John Lewis\nJohn Lewis of the eponymous department store on Oxford Street engaged in a protracted legal dispute with de Walden, his ground landlord, over the Holles Street premises. The litigation went through the courts for twenty-three years and cost Lewis £40,000. At one point John Lewis was sent to Brixton Jail for contempt of court, and de Walden sued him for libel following his erection of placards at his stores. The case was eventually settled amicably.\nFamily\nIn 1912 Howard de Walden married Margherita Dorothy van Raalte, herself a collector of antiquities.
