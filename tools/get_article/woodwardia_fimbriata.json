It is native to western North America from British Columbia through California, including the Sierra Nevada, into Baja California.\nIt grows in coniferous forests and other moist wooded habitat.\nIt was first described by James Edward Smith and is  characterized by its large fronds and arrangement of reproductive sori.\nNot only is it used in gardens, but it also has a history of use by the native tribes in the United States, such as the native tribes of California.\nDescription\nWoodwardia fimbriata has very long fronds, each reaching 1 to 3 meters in length. Its sori are short but broad and are arranged in neat lines, the characteristic that gives the chain ferns their name. The chain shape is visible on both sides of each leaflet.\nThe fronds are bipinnately compound, the leaves have the same general shape and leathery texture.\nParts of the rhizome exist above and below ground. The above ground portion is covered with petioles, reddish-brown or orange-brown scales cover the bases of these petioles. The petioles can also be straw colored or have a reddish-brown color at their bases and can be between 15 and 100 cm in length.\nTaxonomy\nWoodwardia fimbriata was first described by James Edward Smith. It was first published in The Cyclopaedia in the year 1818. The term \"Woodwardia\" is a reference to the English botanist Thomas Jenkinson Woodward.\nCommon names include the giant chain fern and the western chain fern.\nSynonyms include: Woodwardia chamissoi, Woodwardia paradoxa, Woodwardia biserrata and Woodwardia spinulosa.\nDistribution and habitat\nWoodwardia fimbriata can be located along the western coast of North America from British Columbia in Canada to Baja California as well as the state of Nevada.\nRecords of Woodwardia fimbriata indicate its presence in canyons, foothills, springs, streambeds and banks and in different kinds of forests such as redwood, coniferous and mixed forests.\nIt grows mainly in moist and wet environments, with elevations between 0-1000 meters, but records note instances at elevations up to 8000 feet (2438 meters).\nEcology\nNatural threats to Woodwardia fimbriata include soil erosion and competition for natural resources by invasive species.\nIt is found near trees such as red alder (Alnus rubra), and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), or near other ferns such as the sword and maidenhair ferns.\nUses\nCultivation\nWoodwardia fimbriata is cultivated as an ornamental plant for traditional and native plant gardens, and in natural landscaping and habitat restoration projects. It is a recipient of the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\nWhen grown in cultivation, it should be placed in partially shaded and moist environment and with acidic or neutral soil, but it can also be grown in full sun with proper watering.\nThere are no notable pests or diseases that specifically affect it in cultivation.\nUses by Native Americans\nThe indigenous tribes of California used fibers obtained from Woodwardia fimbriata to add patterns into their baskets. Fibers were obtained from the stems and dyed red using an extract from white alder before being added into baskets.\nMethods for obtaining fibers involved using the leaves, more specifically fiber was obtained from crushing the rachis of leaves and processing them. Dyes were obtained from both white alder and red alder barks.\nThere are also records of medical use of this plant for pain relief, specifically by Luiseno Indians who used extractions from the roots.\nThe leaves were also placed in the ovens of the Pomo and Kashaya tribes before cooking.\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*[http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?query_src=photos_index&where-taxon=Woodwardia+fimbriata Woodwardia fimbriata - U.C.
