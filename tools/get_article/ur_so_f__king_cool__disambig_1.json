It was released on 29 May 2020 by Bad Batch Records and distributed by Sony Music in Australia and New Zealand and globally by Elektra Records. It was written by Toni Watson ( Tones and I).\nBackground\nIn May 2020 Tones and I explained to Poppy Reid of Rolling Stone (Australia), that \"You're So Fucking Cool\", is about a party she attended in Los Angeles. Reid observed, \"there are elements of her true self in the music: frustration, longing, loneliness, playfulness.\" Tones announced the release of the song on 26 May 2020.\nCritical reception\nThe song was panned by critics and was included on a list of the worst songs of 2020 published by Insider; its lyrics were described as \"condescending and bitter\".\nMusic video\nThe music video was released on 29 May 2020, and was directed by Tones and I, Nick Kozakis and Liam Kelly. The cover art for the single depicts the artist in seven different guises: all appear in the music video. Tones and I was able to appear as multiple characters in one scene due to the use of a robotic camera that filmed duplicated shots over a 3-day period.\nThe music video was nominated for Best Video at the ARIA Music Awards of 2020.\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020–2021)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Canada CHR/Top 40 (Billboard)\n| 48\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Mexico Airplay (Billboard)\n| 44\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ)\n| 9\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Sweden Heatseeker (Sverigetopplistan)\n| 3\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Austria (Ö3 Austria Top 40)\n| 72\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Hot Rock & Alternative Songs (Billboard)\n| 99\n|}\nCertifications\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Region\n!scope=\"col\"|Date\n!scope=\"col\"|Format(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|Label\n!scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Various\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 29 May 2020\n|\n| Bad Batch\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia\n| rowspan=\"3\"| Contemporary hit radio\n| Sony\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Italy\n| 5 June 2020\n| Warner\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\"| United States\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 16 June 2020\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Elektra\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n| Alternative radio\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|}\nReferences"
