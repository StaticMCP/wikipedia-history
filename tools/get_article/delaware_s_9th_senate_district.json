It has been represented by Democrat Jack Walsh since 2016, succeeding fellow Democrat Karen Peterson.\nGeography\nDistrict 9 covers the areas between Newark and Wilmington in New Castle County, including parts of Pike Creek, Pike Creek Valley, Newport, Stanton, and far eastern Newark proper.\nLike all districts in the state, the 9th Senate district is located entirely within Delaware's at-large congressional district. It overlaps with the 17th, 18th, 19th, 21st, and 24th districts of the Delaware House of Representatives.\nRecent election results\nDelaware Senators are elected to staggered four-year terms. Under normal circumstances, the 9th district holds elections in presidential years, except immediately after redistricting, when all seats are up for election regardless of usual cycle.\n2020\n}}\n2016\n2012\nFederal and statewide results\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! width=\"30\" | Year\n! width=\"60\" | Office\n! width=\"180\" | Results\n|-\n| 2020\n| President\n| align=\"right\"  | Biden 63.6 – 34.5%\n|-\n| 2016\n| President\n| align=\"right\"  | Clinton 57.4 – 37.0%\n|-\n| 2014\n| Senate\n| align=\"right\"  | Coons 60.1 – 37.3%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 2012\n| President\n| align=\"right\"  | Obama 64.6 – 33.9%\n|-\n| Senate\n| align=\"right\"  | Carper 72.5 – 24.0%\n|-\n| Governor\n| align=\"right\"  | Markell 75.1 – 22.9%\n|}\nReferences"
