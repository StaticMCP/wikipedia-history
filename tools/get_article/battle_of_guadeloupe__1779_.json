The Royal Navy under Joshua Rowley sighted and promptly chased the French frigates, all of which were captured after a brief fight.\nBattle\nOn 21 December 1779,  along with the 74-gun ships of the line , , and the 64-gun  under Rear-Admiral Joshua Rowley, sighted the 32-gun French frigates Fortunée and Blanche and the 28-gun Elise, off the French island of Guadeloupe. The French ships had been part of the Comte d Estaing's fleet.\nThe engagement that followed was one sided - the French ships were in disorder; their crews were weak; and they could not escape the vastly superior British  force. The Blanche was defeated and captured on the evening of 21 December. The Fortunée attempted to escape by throwing her quarter-deck guns overboard, but was captured on the early morning of 22 December, an hour before the Elise had struck.\nThe Blanche and Fortunée were thus added to the British navy.\nRowley then led his squadron to capture a large French convoy, which had sailed from Marseille, off Martinique.\nReferences\nSources\n*|publisher=Chatham Publishing}}\n*|publisher=Conway Maritime Press|isbn=0-85177-252-8}}\n*|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1598841008}}"
