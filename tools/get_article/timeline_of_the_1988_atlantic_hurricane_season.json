It was an active season during which twelve tropical cyclones formed. The season officially began on June&nbsp;1, 1988 and ended November&nbsp;30, 1988. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most systems form.\nOf this season's 12 named storms, 5 attained hurricane status, of which 3 became a major hurricanea storm that ranks as a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson scale. The most notable storm in 1988 was Hurricane Gilbert, which was at the time the most intense hurricane in the Atlantic on record. Hurricane Gilbert caused about $5&nbsp;billion in damage and 300 fatalities. The other notable storm was Hurricane Joan, which struck Nicaragua as a category 4 hurricane, and caused about $2&nbsp;billion in damage and about 200 fatalities. Joan crossed into the Pacific and was renamed Miriam. As a result of their intensity, the names Gilbert and Joan were subsequently retired from reuse in the North Atlantic by the World Meteorological Organization.\nThis timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It includes information that was not released throughout the season, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not initially warned upon, has been included.\nBy convention, meteorologists one time zone when issuing forecasts and making observations: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and also use the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight UTC). In this time line, all information is listed by UTC first with the respective local time included in parentheses.\nTimeline\nMay\n;May 30\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT) &ndash; Tropical Depression One forms about  south of Isla de la Juventud, Cuba.\nJune\n;June 1\nThe 1988 Atlantic hurricane season officially begins.\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT) &ndash;
