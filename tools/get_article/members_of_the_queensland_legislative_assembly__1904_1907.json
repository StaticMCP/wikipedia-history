In 1906, Morgan left to become president of the Queensland Legislative Council, replacing Hugh Nelson who had died on 1 January, and Kidston became Premier. By March 1907, a major realignment had taken place — Kidston had split away to form his own party, the \"Kidstonites\", taking the ministry, numerous MPs and the coalition with him. By the 1907 state election, the parliamentary parties were as follows:\n* Kidstonites, led by William Kidston, consisting of Liberals and former Labour members.\n* Labour Party, led by David Bowman.\n* Philp Party (Conservative), led by Robert Philp.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
