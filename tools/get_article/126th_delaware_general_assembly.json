Elections were held the first Tuesday after November 1 and terms began in Dover on the first Tuesday in January. This date was January 5, 1971, which was two weeks before the beginning of the third administrative year of Governor Russell W. Peterson and Eugene Bookhammer as Lieutenant Governor.\nCurrently the distribution of seats for both houses was based on a court interpreted interpretation of the federal 1960 census. It resulted in a large shift in membership numbers to the New Castle County area and ruling that the election districts would abandonment of county lines for their boundaries, but could design whatever district boundaries that would accomplish such population equals. Subsequent census were adjusted such boundaries to continue such adjectives, the next being in 1972.\nIn the 126th Delaware General Assembly session both chambers had a Republican majority.\nLeadership\nSenate\n*Reynolds du Pont, New Castle County, Republican\nHouse of Representatives\n*William L.
