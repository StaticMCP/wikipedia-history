It was first mentioned in 1677 as Schwartzenheüßeren, a name that would become Schwarzhäusern.\nSeveral Mesolithic or Neolithic flint tools have been found in sites around the municipality.  There are several early medieval graves at Klebenrain.  By the 13th century, a bridge was built over the Aare river, which connected the village to regional center of power in Aarwangen.  In 1432, Aarwangen came under Bernese power and brought neighboring Schwarzhäusern with it.  For a few decades, Bern and Solothurn shared authority over the parish of Niederbipp, which included Schwarzhäusern.  However, in 1463, it came completely under Bern's control.  Following the 1798 French invasion, under the Helvetic Republic it became part of the District of Wangen.  Schwarzhäusern remained in the Wangen district until 1871, when it joined the Aarwangen district.\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries cottage industry weaving began to supplement agriculture in the local economy.  During the 19th century, as agriculture became increasingly mechanized and required fewer workers, many residents were forced to emigrate to find work.  At the beginning of the 21st century, agriculture and small businesses provide only 17% of the jobs in the municipality and about three-quarters of the workers commute to nearby towns for work.
