Due to those reasons, he withdrew himself from the awards and did not wish to participate.\nK.O and Kid X excluded in the nominees for the SA Hip Hop Awards (2014)\nIn 2014, rapper K.O and Kid X had effectively been excluded from the nomination list of the 2014 South African Hip Hop Awards. It was thought that the duo were snubbed despite their single garnering one million views on YouTube and blazing local charts for weeks on end. However, the SA Hip hop awards organisers took to Twitter to set the record straight and said that Cashtime Life had asked to be excluded from the nominees and they had \"kindly obliged\".\nNasty C snubbing the SA Hip-Hop Awards (2017)\nIn 2017, rapper Nasty C did not submit his music for consideration in the 2017 South African Hip-Hop Awards as he believed the organisation did not properly acknowledge his success.\nSouth African Hip Hop Awards honouring HHP, Ben Sharpa & ProKid (2018)\nThe 7th annual ceremony which took place on Wednesday, the 19th of December at The Lyric Theatre, Gold Reef City, Johannesburg. Hip Hop masses that were in attendance were entertained with special tributes to Ben Sharpa, Pro Kid and HHP.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.sahiphopawards.com/ South African Hip Hop Awards website]\n*"
