The vessel can pump  for firefighting, and is the city's first dedicated fireboat.\nShe was purchased through a port security grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\nThe $2.7 million grant was shared with the Fire Department of nearby Astoria, Oregon, and Clark County Fire & Rescue.\nIn 2002 a Washington Survey and Review Bureau evaluation reported that Vancouver maritime commerce was well above the size where the city needed a dedicated fireboat.\nThe publication of the report triggered an increase local insurance rates. The FEMA research paper Marine Response Vessel Use and Design Assessment recommended that Vancouver's fireboat should have a minimum pumping capacity of at least .\nOperation\nIn addition to her fire-fighting capability the vessel is equipped with infrared sensors to support search and rescue missions.\nIn her cabin there is a decontamination station as well as facilities for providing emergency medical care and transportation. She is equipped with equipment to contain oil and other hazardous material spills.  In addition, she was designed to be of use in the event of natural or man-made disasters, like earthquakes, or terrorist attacks.\nThe Discovery is available to respond anywhere on the Columbia River system. (when staffed)                                                                              Vancouver Fire responded to 22 maritime incidents in 2024.\nThe Discovery is not staffed full time. She operates with a minimum crew of 3- pilot, deckhand and rescue swimmer. In normal circumstances, this crew is assigned to a \"marine engine company\" in town, which must respond several miles to reach the Discovery for an emergency response. If that engine company is committed to an incident, or if the engine crew on a given day does not contain the requisite pilot, deckhand and swimmer, the Discovery cannot operate and won't be dispatched.\nReferences\n}}"
