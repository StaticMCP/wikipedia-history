Although he came from a military family, he rejected this tradition. While studying at Exeter College, Oxford, he came under the influence of pacifist ideas, particularly those of Bart de Ligt.\nDuring the Second World War, he declared as a conscientious objector and was briefly imprisoned. He spent the rest of the war on alternative service, including working in a hospital.\nAfter the war, Brock worked with a Quaker relief mission to Germany and Poland, sparking his interest in Eastern Europe. After the mission ended, Brock took graduate study at Jagiellonian University, receiving a doctorate in history in 1950.\nBrock later emigrated to Canada and settled there, working at the University of Toronto from 1966.\nBrock's work on the study of peoples in Eastern Europe included detailed studies of the history and culture of the culture of the Poles, Czechs, and Ukrainians. Brock often learned the languages of the culture he was studying in order to read source material in these languages.\nBrock's studies on pacifism included a trilogy of books, Pacifism in the United States: From the Colonial Era to the First World War (1968), Pioneers of the Peaceable Kingdom (1970), and Twentieth-Century Pacifism (1970). The last book, appearing as the Vietnam War protests had revived public interest in pacifism, was \"a critical and popular success\". By 1973, historian Robert Scharf said that \"Professor Brock has become a recognised authority on pacifism in our Western civilization\", while political scientist Martin Ceadel stated \"[n]o ideology owes more to one academic than pacifism owes to Peter Brock. That the scope and richness of this historical tradition can now be recognized is largely the result of Brock's sympathetic and dedicated scholarship, which was begun when pacifism was an unfashionable subject.\"\nA revised edition of the third book, Pacifism in the Twentieth Century was published in 1999 with Nigel Young.\nSee also\n* List of peace activists\nBibliography\nFor a complete bibliography, see\n*The Political and Social Doctrines of the Unity of Czech Brethren in the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries (1957).\n*''Vasya Pozdnyakov's Dukhobor narrative (1965).\n*Pacifism in the United States.
