Two of them, kabaddi and kho-kho, are played at the South Asian Games, with kabaddi also featuring at the Asian Games. Many of these games are played across the entire subcontinent under different names and with some rule variations, while some of these games may be played only in certain countries or regions.\nHistory\nAncient era\nSome traditional South Asian games, such as kabaddi, kho-kho, and atya-patya, are believed to be thousands of years old, finding mention in historical scriptures and dating back to ancient India. Kho-kho, for example, dates back to at least the fourth century BC. Many South Asian games likely reflect characteristics of traditional life in the subcontinent; for example, the Bengali hopscotch game of ekka-dokka (related to Stapoo and Chindro) may reflect the concepts of land division and ownership of property in ancient times.\nModern era\n. Kho kho is South Asia's second-most popular tag game.]]\nAfter the British colonisation of the subcontinent which peaked from the 19th century to 1947, Western sports such as cricket, football, and hockey began to be followed to a greater extent, to the detriment of the traditional games. The modern advent of urbanisation, globalisation (which attracted people towards more globally popular games),[https://ir.nbu.ac.in/bitstream/123456789/3953/1/Karatoya%20vol%2012%20Article%20No%205.pdf Bengal Traditional Games and Sports Culture Around in Twentieth-Century North Bengal] Badal Roy & Dr. Sudash Lamahttps://ir.nbu.ac.in/  and technology (which gave people digital forms of entertainment such as the Internet, television, and video games) have further diminished the traditional South Asian sports. Additional reasons include religious extremism in some areas, which has restricted people from playing certain games, and lack of governmental support.\nHowever, the affordability of the traditional games saw them prioritised for physical education purposes by some thinkers of the early postcolonial period, and some professional leagues are now being started for traditional sports, such as the Pro Kabaddi League, Ultimate Kho Kho, and Pro Panja League, which are beginning to revive interest in these sports and even globalise them. These leagues are now some of the most-watched competitions in India.\nTraditional games\nGillidanda\nGillidanda or gulli danda is a game where players attempt to hit a stick as far as possible to score points. It has similarities to the popular South Asian sport of cricket, as well as to traditional games around the world, such as tipcat.\nChindro\nGutte\nGutte (similar to Meergati and Bilghotti in Pakistan) involves players throwing up and then grabbing stones on the ground, while ensuring none of the stones falls from the air to the ground.\nDark room\nDark room is the same as hide-and-seek, except that it is played in an entirely dark room.\nDonkey Donkey\nDonkey Donkey (similar to the Pakistani Beech ki Billi) is a game in which two players attempt to throw a ball to each other, while a player in the middle tries to catch it.\nBall games\nMaram pitti\nMaram Pitti is similar to Pakistan's Maran Kuttai.\nSeven stones\nIn the game of seven stones (known by several other names in various regions), one team throws a ball at a pile of stones and then attempts to rebuild the pile, while the other team tries to eliminate the first team's players by throwing the ball at them.\nVariations of tag\nDeciding who the denner is\nIn many South Asian variations of tag, the player meant to tag the other players is known as the \"denner\". There are various ways of selecting the denner, such as Saa Boo Three (also known as pugam pugai), in which a group of three players face one of their hands up or down, and if one of the players faces their hand the opposite way of the other two, then they are chosen as the denner.\nKabaddi\nKho-kho\nFreeze tag\nFreeze tag (also known as Baraf Paani in North-India and Pakistan, and as Borof Paani in Bangladesh) involves players becoming \"frozen\" in place when tagged by an opponent, but becoming unfrozen when tagged by a teammate.\nAtya-patya\nLangdi\nAankh micholi\nAankh micholi (similar to Bangladesh's Kanamachi) is a form of blindfolded tag.\nKokla chappaki\nThis game (similar to Rumal Chor and Bengal's Rumal Churi) is similar to duck, duck, goose.\nOonch Neech\nBoard games\nSnakes and ladders\nAnother traditional game called Ludo, is mostly played at the same board on the other side.
