Washington drew up his troops in a defensive position behind Brandywine Creek. Howe sent Lieutenant General Wilhelm von Knyphausen's 5,000 troops to demonstrate against the American front at Chadd's Ford. Meanwhile, Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis took 10,000 troops on a wide flank march that crossed the creek and got in the rear of the American right wing under Major General John Sullivan. The Americans changed front but Howe's attack broke through.\nAs Howe's wing made progress, Knyphausen converted his feint into a frontal attack on the American center. Washington's army was driven to the rear in disarray, but was saved from rout by Major General Nathanael Greene's rear guard action. Washington's army retreated to Chester, Pennsylvania while Howe occupied Wilmington, Delaware. The engagement took place in Chadds Ford Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania.\nBritish Army order of battle\nSir William Howe\nGeneral Sir William Howe (18,000)\nQuartermaster General: Brigadier General Sir William Erskine, 1st Baronet\nNote: Each brigade had two or four 3-pound or 4-pound cannons attached.\nLeft Wing\nLieutenant General Lord Cornwallis\n* Unbrigaded:\n** 16th Light Dragoons (200)\n** Hessian and Anspach Jägers: Lieutenant Colonel Ludwig von Wurmb (500)\n** Mounted Jäger company, Captain Richard Lorey (100)\n** Artillery: 3rd Brigade\n*** Four 12-pound cannons & six 6-pound cannons\nLord Cornwallis\n* Guards Brigade: Brigadier General Edward Mathew (939)\n** Elements of 1st Foot Guard, 2nd Foot Guard, and 3rd Foot Guard Regiments\n** 1st Battalion (488)\n*** Grenadier company, Lieutenant Colonel Sir George Osborn, 4th Baronet (124)\n*** Hyde's company (93)\n*** Wrottesley's company (91)\n*** Cox's company (90)\n*** Garth's company (90)\n** 2nd Battalion (451)\n*** Stephen's company (88)\n*** Murray's company (89)\n*** O'Hara's company (87)\n*** Martin's company (91)\n*** Light company, Lieutenant Colonel Osborn (96)\n* Light Infantry: (1,300)\n** 1st Light Infantry Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Abercromby of Airthrey\n*** Light companies of (from left to right in formation) 5th, 15th, 22nd, 27th, 33rd, 38th, 42nd, 35th, 28th, 23rd, 17th, 10th, and 4th Regiments.\n** 2nd Light Infantry Battalion, Major John Maitland\n*** Light companies of (from left to right in formation) 37th, 43rd, 45th, 49th, 55th, 63rd, 71st, 64th, 57th, 52nd, 46th, 44th, and 40th Regiments.\n* Grenadiers: (1,400)\n** 1st Grenadier Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel William Medows\n*** Grenadier companies of (from left to right in formation) 5th, 15th, 22nd, 27th, 33rd, 37th, 40th, 38th, 35th, 28th, 23rd, 17th, 10th, and 4th Regiments\n** 2nd Grenadier Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Monckton\n*** Grenadier companies of (from left to right in formation) 43rd, 49th, 52nd, 57th, 64th, 71st, 63rd, 55th, Marines, 46th, 44th, and 42nd Regiments\nCharles Grey\n* 3rd Brigade: Major General Charles Grey, 1st Earl Grey (3,000 in 3rd and 4th Brigades)\n** 15th Foot\n** 17th Foot\n** 42nd Foot\n** 44th Foot\n* 4th Brigade: Brigadier General James Agnew\n** 33rd Foot\n** 38th Foot\n** 46th Foot\n** 64th Foot\n* Hessian Brigade: Colonel Carl von Donop (1,300)\n** Linsing Grenadier Battalion\n** Minningerode Grenadier Battalion\n** Lengerke Grenadier Battalion\nRight Wing\nWilhelm Knyphausen\nLieutenant General Wilhelm von Knyphausen\n* Unbrigaded:\n** Queen's Rangers, Captain James Weymss (300)\n** Rifle Corps, Captain Patrick Ferguson (90)\n** 16th Light Dragoons (200)\n** 71st Foot (1,200)\n*** 1st and 3rd battalions guarding the baggage train.\n*** 2nd battalion (350)\n** Artillery: 1st and 2nd Brigades\n*** Six 12-pound cannons & four howitzers\n* Hessian Brigade: Major General Johann Daniel Stirn (2,000)\n** Erbprinz Infantry Regiment\n** Donop Infantry Regiment\n** Mirbach Infantry Regiment\n* 1st Brigade: Major General James Grant (1,400)\n** 4th Foot\n** 23rd Foot\n** 28th Foot\n** 49th Foot\n* 2nd Brigade: Major General Grant (1,300)\n** 5th Foot\n** 10th Foot\n** 27th Foot\n** 40th Foot, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Musgrave, John Graves Simcoe\n** 55th Foot\nAmerican Army order of battle\nGeorge Washington\nGeneral and Commander in Chief George Washington (12,000 regulars, 3,000 militia)\nMain Body\n* Unattached:\n** Chadds Ford redoubt: Colonel Thomas Proctor\n*** 4th Continental Artillery Regiment: One 6-pound gun, two 4-pound guns, one 8-inch howitzer\n** Light Infantry Corps: Brigadier General William Maxwell (1,000)\n*** About 100 soldiers were detached from each regular brigade to form this corps\n** North Carolina Brigade: Brigadier General Francis Nash (1,094)\n*** 1st North Carolina Regiment, Colonel Thomas Clark\n*** 2nd North Carolina Regiment, Colonel Alexander Martin\n*** 3rd North Carolina Regiment, Colonel Jethro Sumner\n*** 4th North Carolina Regiment, Colonel Thomas Polk\n*** 5th North Carolina Regiment Colonel Edward Buncombe\n*** 6th North Carolina Regiment, Colonel Gideon Lamb\n*** 7th North Carolina Regiment, Colonel James Hogun\n*** 8th North Carolina Regiment\n*** 9th North Carolina Regiment\n* Division: Major General John Armstrong Sr. (2,000)\n** 1st Pennsylvania Militia Brigade: Brigadier General James Potter\n*** Philadelphia County Regiment, Moor\n*** Philadelphia County Regiment, McVaugh\n*** Bucks County Regiment, Maj.
