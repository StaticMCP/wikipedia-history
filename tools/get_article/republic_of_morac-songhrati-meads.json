Meads.\nMorton F. Meads\nMorton Meads was a U.S. Army Soldier, discharged in Manila in 1946, for illegally engaging in various personal business ventures, mainly in the re-sale of army surplus.\nMeads' tall tales of his so-called birthright \"Kingdom of Humanity\" were captured in the local Philippine newspapers, which then caught the attention of the local Philippine military authorities. Meads was later arrested on criminal and civil charges for his business ventures, although these charges were later dropped. Regardless, Meads' fanciful storytelling sparked the motivation of powerful Filipino businessmen, such as Tomas Coloma, to race towards claiming the South China Sea Islands for the Philippines, such as the Spratlys.\nHistory\nThe republic's history begins with Morton Meads' supposed British forebear, Captain James George Meads, who laid claim to the Spratly Islands in 1877. Captain Meads was exploring the South China Sea on the Modeste and laid claim to the islands and took the name King James I. Descendants of Meads have continued to posit legitimacy over the islands, and ownership of the islands' resources.\nKingdom of Humanity\nA rival entity called the \"Kingdom of Humanity\" formed in 1914 under the leadership of Franklin M. Meads, the son of James George. The two rival factions continued their claim on the islands during World War II, when they were occupied by Japanese troops. Franklin died in 1945, and his son Josiah took over leadership ; Josiah himself died soon after. His son, Morton F. Meads, was to succeed but was deemed too young.\nLegal attempts at legitimacy\nThe Kingdom faded into obscurity over the next decade until 1972, when the then-ruling Morton Meads unsuccessfully petitioned the United Nations, Chiang Kai-shek of the Republic of China, and the Philippines to recognise the Kingdom and its claims. Later that year, the remainder of the Kingdom's governing body drowned in a shipwreck off the coast of Philippines during Typhoon Ora, except for Meads.\nThe Kingdom reappeared in 1985 when Meads sued the United States and others for $25 billion, claiming \"unfair competition, harassment, [and] sabotage.\" The case was not heard.\nSee also\n*Spratly Islands\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Samuel Pyeatt Menefee, \"Republics of the Reefs: Nation-Building on the Continental Shelf and in the World's Oceans\", California Western International Law Journal, vol. 25, no. 1, Fall, 1994, pp.&nbsp;83–85."
