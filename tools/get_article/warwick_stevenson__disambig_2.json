(ATi).]\nSignificant injuries\n*Broke his left ankle in 1997 and was told by doctors that he would never race again.\n*Broke his wrist at the 1999 ABA Spring National in Santa Clara, California on 31 May 1999.\n*Broke his hand at the 2003 ABA World Championships.\n*Suffered a collapsed right lung and internal bleeding at the ABA National in Oldsmar, Florida in April 2004 after crashing onto a jump in the rhythm section on Saturday (day one). He was sent to the hospital and spent the entire next day in the hospital, where his lung re-inflated on its own. He could not fly home to Arizona and had to stay in Florida a few days when he was told that if he flew the change in the atmospheric pressure inside the aircraft could do serious damage. He was laid up for nearly three months.\n*In April 2005 he tore his anterior cruciate ligament in his knee. Unlike in tennis or basketball, cycling doesn't require lateral stability because the athlete doesn't need to be able to stop or launch himself sideways. He was able to race with a leg brace for much of the year. He waited until after the 2005 NBL Grand Nationals to have the surgery.\n*Had knee surgery in late October 2005 for the injury he suffered in April 2005 and was laid up for five months until 26 March 2006 NBL Nellis Silver State National in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n*Suffered distal radius fracture in his arm at the ABA Sooner Nationals on 4 February 2007 in Guthrie, Oklahoma.\n*On 10 May 2007 he had emergency surgery to have his spleen removed. He injured it after a serious training accident in Texas practicing on trails. According to Stevenson, He apparently flat lined on the operating table as a result. Lack of care and infection caused a Staph infection and deep stomach scar. His first race back was the ABA Midwest National in Rockford, Illinois on 15 June 2007.\nRacing habits and traits\nMiscellaneous\n*In 1999 he set the ABA record for turning \"AA\" pro from \"A\" pro in just 33 days.\n*He was a coach on MTV's television show Made (Originally aired Thursday, 27 January 2005 during the show's fifth season) in which he taught a girl to ride a BMX bike on a BMX race track over the course of six weeks.\n*He was featured on MTV's television show MTV Cribs (originally aired Tuesday, 3 May 2005 season 11, episode 66) which featured a tour Stevenson's former Scottsdale residence he had obtained with the winnings as a pro BMX racer.\nBMX and general press magazine interviews and articles\n*\"ONES of a KIND:The Jamie Staff/Warwick Stevenson Interview\" Transworld BMX September 2002 Vol.9 Iss.9 No.71 pg.55 Joint interview of Stevenson and fellow racer Jamie Staff.\n*\"The Warlock\" Moto Mag May/June 2003 Vol.2 No.3 pg.21\n*\"Warwick Seals The Deal\" Transworld BMX March 2004 Vol.11 Iss.3 No.89 pg.46\n*\"Life in the Fast Lane: Warwick interviews Randy\" Transworld BMX April 2004 Vol.11 Iss.4 No.90 pg.36 article featuring both Randy Stumpfhauser and Stevenson with side bar interviews of them interviewing each other.\n*\"Answers From Warwick\" Transworld BMX October 2004 Vol.11 Iss.10 No.96 pg.30 Warwick answers submitted questions by the readers of Transworld BMX.\nBMX magazine covers\nNote: Only magazines that were in publication at the time of the racer's career(s) are listed unless specifically noted.\nMinicycle/BMX Action & Super BMX:\n*None\nBicycle Motocross Action & Go:\n*None\nBMX Plus!:\nSnap BMX Magazine & Transworld BMX:\nTwenty BMX:\nMoto Mag:\n*September/October 2002 Vol.1 No.2 (1) in second place behind Kyle Bennett (9).\nBicycles Today & BMX Today (The official NBL publication under two names):\nABA Action, American BMXer, BMXer (The official ABA publication under three names):\nNotes\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ababmx.com/ The American Bicycle Association (ABA) Website.]\n* [http://www.nbl.org/ The National Bicycle League (NBL) Website.]\n* [http://www.bmxultra.com/prosection/interview/warwicks.htm May 1999 bmxultra.com interview.]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20030227164141/http://www.bmxonline.com/bmx/interviews/article/0,15737,381066,00.html Part 1 of a 27 November 2001 bmxonline.com interview.]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20030227163242/http://www.bmxonline.com/bmx/interviews/article/0,15737,381071,00.html Part 2 of a 27 November 2001 bmxonline.com interview.]\n* [http://expn.go.com/athletes/bios/STEVENSON_WARWICK.html EXPN.com bio.]\n* [http://www.harobikes.com/news/paper.php?Article=121003&section=global&Headline=Warwick%20Stevenson%20Interview 10 December 2003 Harobikes.com interview.]\n*[http://www.powerbar.com/Athletes/Profiles/Details.aspx?id=6B3E7351-D64B-4713-B287-B04D850F46CC Powerbar.com Profile.]"
