These sanctions were imposed against individuals, businesses, officials and assets such as yachts from Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.\nImpacted yachts\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 align=center |Name !! rowspan=2 align=center |Owner !! colspan=4 align=center |Action taken !! rowspan=2 align=center |Photo !! rowspan=2 align=center |Refs\n|-\n!
