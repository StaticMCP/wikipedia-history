      "text": "# The Discovery of Middle Earth: Mapping the Lost World of the Celts\n\nThe Discovery of Middle Earth is a 2013 non-fiction book by British author Graham Robb. Drawing on ancient maps and other archival sources, Robb argues that the ancient Celts organized territories and determined the locations of settlements and potential battle sites based on solstice lines. This set of tribal migration was an extension of the Greek system of klimata.\nAs evidence, Robb presents interpretations of artistic geometries, road surveying, and Greek \"centuriations.\" He suggests these alignments predate the Roman Empire. Published by Norton and Company, the book was well received for its contributions to ancient geography, mathematics, and European ethnography.\nReferences"
