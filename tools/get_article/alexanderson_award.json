It honors outstanding research articles arising from AIM research activities (workshop, research community, or SQuaRE) which have been published within the past three years.\nMotivation\nThe award was conceived of by John Fry in order to honor Gerald L. Alexanderson, Professor at Santa Clara University and founding chair of AIM's board of trustees.\nPrize\nWinners of the Alexanderson Award are given a medal, a cash prize and a trip to Bock Cay in the Bahamas.\nAwardees\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!
