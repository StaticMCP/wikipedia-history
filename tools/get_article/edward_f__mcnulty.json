      "text": "# Edward F. McNulty\n\nEdward Francis McNulty (May 27, 1905 – March 21, 1980) was a Republican politician in Philadelphia who served for a term on the Philadelphia City Council.\nMcNulty was born in Philadelphia in 1905, the son of John and Anna McNulty. Born and raised in Philadelphia's Port Richmond neighborhood, he was given the nickname \"Happy\" at a young age, in tribute to his smiling disposition. McNulty attended parochial school at Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary Catholic Church, but dropped out at age 14 to find work. He worked in the local chemical industry, eventually rising to become foreman of the plastics division of Allied Chemical Company. He also became involved in local politics, and was elected a Republican committeeman in 1931; two years later, he was named ward leader of the 25th ward, a position he held for forty years. In 1934, he married Ida Lafferty, with whom he had four children.\nIn 1963, McNulty was the Republican nominee for city council from the sixth district. In what the Philadelphia Daily News called \"one of the biggest surprises\" of the election that November, he narrowly defeated the incumbent, Democrat William A. Dwyer Jr. On the Council, he earned a reputation as a quiet but well-liked legislator. Nevertheless, when the time came for reelection, party leaders looked for a different candidate to take McNulty's place. When the party hierarchy endorsed former city controller Frank J. Tiemann for the sixth district seat, McNulty entered the primary anyway. Tiemann won the primary. In the general election, Tiemann lost to Democrat Joseph L. Zazyczny.\nAfter leaving office, McNulty worked for the state Department of Revenue as an auditor. He retired in 1970 and moved to Cherry Hill, New Jersey. In 1980, he died at Washington Memorial Hospital in Turnersville, New Jersey, at the age of 74.\nReferences\nSources\n*  }}\n*\n*  }}\n* }}\n*\n*\n*"
