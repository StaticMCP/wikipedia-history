He was President of the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions, representing more than 9,300 employees, and head of the Amalgamated Transit Union's bargaining unit during the strike beginning March 2, 1990, and ending in April 1993.  As Council President, Strait discussed the terms of all possible negotiations with the 16 local union presidents.  Believing the company was motivated by a preconceived desire to bust the union, Strait explained that \"they negotiated us into a strike. I think this has been planned. The company wants to get rid of the union.\"\nInitial strike negotiations were stalled by acts of violence.  While Greyhound CEO Fred Currey argued that \"no American worth his salt negotiates with terrorists,\" Strait responded that management's failure to negotiate amounted to \"putting the negotiations back into\nthe hands of terrorists.\" Shortly after Currey declared \"victory\" and called the strike \"irrelevant,\" Greyhound was forced to declare bankruptcy in June, 1990, which Strait predicted in a debate with Executive Vice President and Chief Negotiator Anthony Lannie on Jim Lehrer's NewsHour.\nAfter Greyhound declared bankruptcy, Strait was primarily concerned with obtaining seniority rehiring for the striking workers, explaining, \"They promised these scabs jobs.  They just don't want to negotiate seniority. If you have a dollar amount, but no seniority, you don't have a job. Without seniority you don't have anything.\"\nPrior to the 1990 strike, Strait was active in the 1983 Greyhound strike as president of Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1098 in Washington, DC.  His initial involvement with Greyhound began when he began driving buses in the 1960s.\nAs a labor leader, Strait was a witness at the United States Senate Subcommittee on Labor Management Relations hearing for a bill designed to strengthen protections for striking workers.\nStrait died on December 20, 2008, at the age of 78.\nReferences"
