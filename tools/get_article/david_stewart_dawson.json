Advertising in Australian newspapers brought so much business he decided to move there and emigrated in 1886. He founded the business of Stewart Dawson and Co. in Sydney and soon had branches in Melbourne, and Auckland and Dunedin in New Zealand and Regent Street in London. After making the company a limited liability company in 1907, Dawson sold the company in 1931 to RHO Hills department store (now House of Fraser).[https://www.housefraserarchive.ac.uk/company/?id=c2682 HOUSE OF FRASER Archive :: Company: RHO Hills Ltd] The resulting company operated until \"around 1935\".[https://www.silvercollection.it/electroplatesilverD.html English electroplate silver: marks and hallmarks of British silver plate: Da-Dh]\nHe dealt extensively in inner-city real-estate, including some of the most significant transactions in Australian history. Anticipating the Great Depression, he converted much of his property (valued around  £1,000,000) from ownership to rental. One significant property he owned was half of the Strand Arcade (Pitt Street end). This peculiar arrangement was to have far-reaching consequences as a result of piecemeal development and inconsistent maintenance.[http://www.dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/strand_arcade Strand Arcade]\nHe was noted for his contribution to the war effort, and served on many committees.\nHe founded the Ambassadors Restaurant, Pitt Street, in 1923, long one of the most fashionable in Sydney.\nHe had a head office, \"The Treasure House\" (built 1907) in Hatton Garden, London and homes in Potts Point and Palm Beach, Sydney, a villa in Monte Carlo and a three-storey country mansion, \"Bon Accord\" in Springwood in the Blue Mountains, close to Norman Lindsay's home.\nOn his death the Monte Carlo villa went to his widow, Harriet Stewart Dawson (née McNab) (1864–1945) who married Prince Michal Radziwill, \"Ordynat\" (entailed estate holder) of the Palace and estate of Antonin in Ostrow County, Poland (1870–1955) in 1938. \"Bon Accord\" was kept as a guest house by his heirs, managed by Hugh D. McIntosh, but burned down in 1937.\nThe James Pascoe Group is the current owner of Stewart Dawson's stores, which are a luxury jewelry retailer with 15 locations in New Zealand.
