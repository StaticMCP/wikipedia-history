Temporal logics are traditionally interpreted in terms of Kripke structures.\nFormal definition\nLet  be a set of atomic propositions, i.e. boolean-valued expressions formed from variables, constants and predicate symbols. Clarke et al. define a Kripke structure over  as a 4-tuple  (S, I, R, L)}} consisting of\n* a finite set of states .\n* a set of initial states .\n* a transition relation  such that  is left-total, i.e.,  such that .\n* a labeling (or interpretation) function .\nSince  is left-total, it is always possible to construct an infinite path through the Kripke structure. A deadlock state can be modeled by a single outgoing edge back to itself.\nThe labeling function  defines for each state  the set  of all atomic propositions that are valid in .\nA path of the structure  is a sequence of states  s1, s2, s3, ...}} such that for each ,   holds.\nThe word on the path  is the sequence of sets of the atomic propositions\nL(s1), L(s2), L(s3), ...}},\nwhich is an ω-word over alphabet .\nWith this definition, a Kripke structure (say, having only one initial state  may be identified with a Moore machine with a singleton input alphabet, and with the output function being its labeling function.\nExample\nLet the set of atomic propositions  }}.\nand  can model arbitrary boolean properties of the system that the Kripke structure is\nmodelling.\nThe figure at right illustrates a Kripke structure  (S, I, R, L)}},\nwhere\n*  }}.\n*  }}.\n*  }}.\n*  ), (s2, ), (s3, )}}}}.\nmay produce a path  s1, s2, s1, s2, s3, s3, s3, ...}} and  , , , , , , , ...}} is the execution word over the path .\ncan produce execution words belonging to the language )*()ω ∪ ()ω}}.\nRelation to other notions\nAlthough this terminology is widespread in the model checking community, some textbooks on model checking do not define \"Kripke structure\" in this extended way (or at all in fact), but simply use the concept of a (labelled) transition system, which additionally has a set  of actions, and the transition relation is defined as a subset of , which they additionally extend to include a set of atomic propositions and a labeling function for the states as well ( as defined above.) In this approach, the binary relation obtained by abstracting away the action labels is called a state graph.\nClarke et al. redefine a Kripke structure as a set of transitions (instead of just one), which is equivalent to the labeled transitions above, when they define the semantics of modal μ-calculus.\nSee also\n*Temporal logic\n*Model checking\n*Kripke semantics\n*Linear temporal logic\n*Computation tree logic\nReferences"
