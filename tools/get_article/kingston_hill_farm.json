The  farm is centered on a building complex with a c. 1810 -story wood frame farmhouse, which follows a typical plan of five bays with a central chimney.  Behind the house are a seed barn and wagon shed, both dating to the early 20th century.  A family cemetery with 18th-century graves is located near the southern boundary of the property.  The farm was first established by William Potter in the 1730s; by the early 18th century it came into the hands of Elisha Reynolds Potter, who operated it as a tenant farm.  Potter tore down the original farmhouse and built the now-surviving smaller house.\nThe farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Washington County, Rhode Island\nReferences"
