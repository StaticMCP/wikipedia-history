It was the second Fifth Colvmn Records compilation and was released to celebrate the three year anniversary of the label.\nReception\nJon Worley of Aiding & Abetting gave Fascist Communist Revolutionaries a mixed review, calling the compilation \"a nice a starting point for the uninitiated, but not as important for current fans\" but described the tracks by Dessau, Trust Obey and Vampire Rodents as \"worth the price of admission.\" Sonic Boom said \"the album serves as an excellent example of the current FCR style with many of the FCR's own bands present as well as a handful of licensed material from European labels.\"\nTrack listing\n| extra1          = Chemlab\n| length1         = 4:59\n| title2          = Suffered\n| note2           = Extended Remix\n| writer2         =\n| extra2          = Dessau\n| length2         = 6:03\n| title3          = Queener\n| note3           = Booty Banger Mix\n| writer3         =\n| extra3          = Acumen\n| length3         = 6:29\n| title4          = Fucked Up Generation\n| note4           = Fuck-N-Suck-Gen\n| writer4         =\n| extra4          = Death Ride 69\n| length4         = 4:20\n| title5          = Distractor\n| writer5         =\n| extra5          = haloblack\n| length5         = 5:13\n| title6          = Hands of Clay\n| note6           = Schwer Geprüft Mix\n| writer6         = John Bergin\n| extra6          = Trust Obey\n| length6         = 8:23\n| title7          = Dim\n| writer7         =\n| extra7          = Final Cut\n| length7         = 5:41\n| title8          = Gravida\n| writer8         = Mauro Teho Teardo\n| extra8          = Meathead\n| length8         = 5:31\n| title9          = The Brain Cult of Macho Irony\n| note9           = Swamp Terrorists Remix\n| writer9         = Templebeat\n| extra9          = Templebeat\n| length9         = 5:39\n| title10          = Blind Acceleration\n| writer10         = Daniel Vahnke\n| extra10          = Vampire Rodents\n| length10         = 2:54\n| title11          = Need to Destroy\n| writer11         =\n| extra11          = THC\n| length11         = 4:10\n| title12          = Reported\n| note12           = Die Krupps Remix\n| writer12         = Dirk Ivens\n| extra12          = Dive\n| length12         = 3:06\n| title13          = Texas\n| writer13         =\n| extra13          = James Ray and The Performance\n| length13         = 5:29\n}}\nPersonnel\nAdapted from the Fascist Communist Revolutionaries liner notes.\n* John Bergin&nbsp;– cover art, design\n* Zalman Fishman&nbsp;– executive-producer\nRelease history\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!
