The prizes were first awarded in 2023.\nThe first José Rizal Heritage Awards covered six fields: Statesmanship and Public Service, Humanitarian Services, Cultural and Public Services, Sustainable Economic and Public Services, Medical Research and Education, and Lifetime Achievement.\nThe José Rizal Heritage Award is widely regarded as a prestigious award in the respective fields especially in the Philippine community.\nExcept in extraordinary circumstances, such as war or pandemia, all awards are given annually. Each recipient, known as a laureate, receives a José Rizal Award Plaque and a certificate.\nSince 2023, the José Rizal Heritage Awards were awarded 19 times to 21 laureates.\nHistory\nThe José Rizal Heritage Fund Association was established in 2019 as a tax-exempt organization to coordinate and implement the philanthropic aid projects of the various chapters of the Knights of Rizal in Switzerland. This allows for the issuance of tax-deductible donation receipts to donors.\nThe Order of the Knights of Rizal is the only state-recognized order of knighthood in the Philippines. It was founded to honor and uphold the ideals of the Philippine national hero José Rizal. Membership in the order, along with its ranks and insignia, is recognized as an official honor and award under the \"Honors Code of the Philippines (Executive Order No. 236).\"\nThe order was founded on December 30, 1911 by nine founding members under the leadership of Colonel Antonio Torres, who would later become the first chief of police of Manila. In 1951 a Legislative Charter was signed into law by the then President Elpidio Quirino on June 14, 1951 as Republic Act No. 646, transforming the privately constituted order (existing since 1911) into a body corporate and politic.\nAward\nSince the José Rizal Heritage Fund, as a non-profit association, cannot take on any financial risks, a separate, non-charitable association to organize the José Rizal Heritage Award Gala was established. This association - José Rizal Heritage Award Organization - organized the first Award Gala on September 23, 2023, in Wil, St. Gallen, Switzerland.\nLaureates\nThe following outstanding individuals have been honored with a José Rizal Heritage Award for their contributions to the society:\nAward Winners 2024:\nHumanitarian Services:\nHon.
