His drawing, Studies of a Child and Two Women, is in the collection of The Tate Gallery. Other works are in Wolverhampton Art Gallery, Shipley Art Gallery, Worcester City Museum and the Ashmolean Museum. In 1951 an album of his drawings was sold by Christie's.\nIn 1854, his address was 22 Foregate Street, Worcester; during a \"short stay\" in London in 1856 he gave his address as 16 Russell Place, Fitzroy Square. In or after 1859, he was again living in Northwick.\nDavis visited the Netherlands, and travelled to Rome in 1866. He died there on 12 June 1867, during a cholera outbreak, at the age of just 34.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.artnet.com/artists/edward-thompson-davis/past-auction-results/2 Works by Edward Thomson Davis] at Artnet"
