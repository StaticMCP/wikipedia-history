A mail receiving office called Cementmills was opened at the company's works in about January 1918, being renamed to Cement Mills in March 1918. It was upgraded to a full post office on 20 April 1925. By 1937, the company ceased using limestone from the area in favour of the coral from Moreton Bay, resulting in the closure of the quarries and the cement mill.\nGore State School opened on 20 January 1913. It was renamed Maxhill State School in 1927. In 1937, the school building was relocated to the cement mills and renamed Cement Mills State School. The school closed on 21 February 1975. In the 1980s, at the request of residents, the Inglewood Shire Council bought the school building and relocated it for use it as a public hall.
