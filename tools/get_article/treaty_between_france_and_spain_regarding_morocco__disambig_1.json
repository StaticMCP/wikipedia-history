Artilicle 7 says \"The city of Tangier and its outskirts will be provided with a special\ngovernment, which will be determined hereafter; they will form a zone\nincluded within the following described limits:\nStarting from Punta Altares on the southern coast of the Straits of\nGibraltar, the boundary will extend in a straight line along the crest\nof Jebel Beni Meyimel, keeping the village called Dzar-ez-Zeitun on\nthe west, and will then follow the boundary line between the Fahs on\nthe one side and the tribes of Anj era and of Wed Ras on the other side,\nto its juncture with the river Es Seghir. Thence, the boundary will\nfollow the channel of the river Es Seghir, then the channels of the rivers\nM'harhar and Tzahadartz to the sea.\" . This led to the International Zone of Tangier.\nReferences"
