It was the third presidential election in Indonesia after the 1945 and 1963 elections. Suharto was officially elected president on 27 March 1968 for a five-year term after previously holding the position of acting president since 1967, when Sukarno was officially impeached and removed by the MPRS. Suharto was officially sworn in on the same day, marking the formal beginning of his first five-year term as president.\nBackground\nThis presidential election was held because Sukarno was impeached and removed by the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly (MPRS) in 1967. Cabinet changes had been very frequent since the G30S/PKI incident, but Sukarno's presidential mandate was finally revoked in 1967 due to the people's demands (TRITURA, The People's Three Demands). He was replaced by Suharto, who became acting president to secure the condition of Indonesia after the G30S/PKI incident. Sukarno was under house arrest until the end of his life.\nResults\nPresident\nReferences"
