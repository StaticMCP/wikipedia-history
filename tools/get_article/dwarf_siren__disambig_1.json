Dwarf sirens possess external gills throughout adulthood and lack hind legs, and can be distinguished from members of the genus Siren in that dwarf sirens have three toes on each foot rather than four. Whereas sirens have three gill slits, dwarf sirens keep just a single slit. Like sirens, dwarf sirens are restricted to the Southeastern United States.\nSpecies\nThe genus Pseudobranchus consists of the following extant species:\n*Southern dwarf siren (P. axanthus)\n**Narrow-striped dwarf siren  (P. a. axanthus)\n**Everglades dwarf siren  (P. a. belli)\n*Northern dwarf siren (P. striatus)\n**Broad-striped dwarf siren  (P. s. striatus)\n**Gulf Hammock dwarf siren  (P. s. lustricolus)\n**Slender dwarf siren  (P. s. spheniscus)\nThere are also two extinct species known from fossil evidence:\n* †Pseudobranchus vetustus (Miocene to Pliocene of Florida)\n* †Pseudobranchus robustus (Pleistocene of Florida)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080624201351/http://www.eol.org/taxa/16141922 Pseudobranchus - Encyclopedia of Life]"
