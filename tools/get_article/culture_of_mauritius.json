      "text": "# Culture of Mauritius\n\nMauritius is a multi-ethnic, multilingual and plural society with a population composed mainly of four major ethnic and religious groups. It is often depicted as a \"rainbow nation\".\nThe island of Mauritius did not have any indigenous population and has been characterized by successive waves of European colonization and multiple immigrations. Under French rule between 1715 and 1810, slaves were imported on the island from mainland Africa and Madagascar.\nIndian migrants from Pondicherry first arrived on the island in 1736. Later, massive immigration from the Bhojpuri-speaking regions of India took place following the abolition of slavery in 1835 by the British Empire. After an early influx of Chinese migrants into Mauritius, mostly from Fujian, Cantonese and Hakka migrants from Southern China (Guangdong) settled on the island, first as indentured labourers and later as free merchants. Hakka Sino-Mauritians eventually became the dominant group within the community.\nThe co-existence of Mauritians of Indian, African (known as Mauritian Creoles), European (mostly French), and Chinese ancestry eventually led to a sharing of values and cultures, a collective participation in festivals and an increased understanding between people of different ethnic backgrounds. Mauritians from different cultural backgrounds are very distinct from each other, and it is also highly unpopular to encourage the dissolution of cultural boundaries in Mauritius. Mauritian high culture is French and Indian dominated.\nReligions\nThe Constitution of Mauritius prohibits discrimination based on creed and provides for the right of individuals to change, manifest, and propagate their religious beliefs. The government of Mauritius recognizes 6 groups as religions: Hindus, Roman Catholics, Muslims, Anglicans, Presbyterians, and Seventh-day Adventists; other religious groups must register as associations.\nThe people of Indian descent (Indo-Mauritian) follow mostly Hinduism and Islam. The Franco-Mauritians, Creoles and Sino-Mauritians follow Christianity.  Hinduism is the major religion, followed by Christianity (with Catholicism as the largest Christian denomination), followed by Islam and some form of Chinese-related religions; a very small number of people follow Buddhism.\nA majority of Sino-Mauritians identify as Catholic Christians. However, Sino-Mauritians also follow some form of Chinese-related religions (which include Taoist and Chinese Folk religions). A minority of Sino-Mauritians follow Buddhism; they also follow Confucianism. Guan Di (Kwan Tee; the god of wealth, also the god of war and the righteous and the benefactor) is an important deity for Sino-Mauritians, especially for those working in the business field. In Chinese pagodas, altars can also be found for Guan Yin, the Goddess Mazu (also known as Tin Hao; the protector of sailors), the God Choy Sun (the God of Good Fortune). Pagodas also shelter ancestral cult altars and ancestral tablets. Following Chinese tradition, religious services are typically conducted one week after death at the pagoda and the ancestral tablet of the deceased with his name written in Chinese characters is deposited behind the altar. On Chinese New Year, descendants of the deceased can practice the ancestral rites before the ancestral tablets as a sign of respect.\nPublic holidays and festivals\nCelebrated festivals with public holidays\nPublic holidays on the same dates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Name of holiday\n!Description\n!Date\n!Type of calendar\n|-\n|New Year's Day\n|Celebration to welcome the new year, celebrated by Mauritians of all origins.

Therefore, only the months when they are likely to be celebrated is given.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Name of holiday\n!Month of the year based on Gregorian calendar\n!Ethnic/religious groups\n!Description\n|-\n|Chinese Spring Festival\n|January or February, dependent on the Chinese calendar\n|Chinese Festival of Sino-Mauritians and Overseas Chinese living in Mauritius\n|The Spring Festival, which is the Chinese New Year, is celebrated in January/February, depending on the adjustment of lunar days. Red, the symbol of happiness, is the dominant colour. Food is piled up to ensure abundance during the year and the traditional wax cake is distributed to relatives and friends. Firecrackers are lit to ward off evil spirits.\n|-\n|Thaipoosam Cavadee\n|January or February, dependent on the Tamil calendar\n|Hindu festival\nof Tamil Mauritians\n|Cavadee is celebrated in honour of Hindu deity Lord Murugan during January/February, more precisely by the Tamil community in Mauritius. Along with the fire-walking and sword-climbing ceremonies, Cavadee is among the most spectacular Tamil events. The body pierced with needles and the tongue and cheeks with skewers, the devotee, trance-like and in penance, walks in procession to the temple bearing the \"Cavadee\", a wooden arch covered with flowers with a pot of milk at each end of its base which he or she places before the deity.\n|-\n|Maha Shivratree\n|Between February and March\n|Hindu Festival of mainly Bihari Mauritians and other Hindu communities as well\n|Maha Shivaratree is celebrated in honour of Hindu deity Lord Shiva during Falgun month. Hindu devotees, clad in spotless white, carry the \"Kanwar\" - wooden arches covered with flowers – set foot for the pilgrimage to Ganga Talao, to fetch the Ganga Jal from the lake. The whole scene is reminiscent of the great rituals on the banks of the Holy Ganges in India.\n|-\n|Ugadi/Gudi Padwa\n|March\n|Hindu Festival of Telugu community and Marathi community in Mauritius\n|Ugadi/Gudi Padwa is the Hindu New Year for Telugus and Marathis respectively.\n|-\n|Assumption Day\n|15 August\n|Christian Festival\n|During odd years, and Assumption Day in even years. The decision to alternate between the two dates was a government decision to avoid increasing the number of unworked days after Abolition of Slavery (1 February) and Arrival of Indian indentured labourers (2 November) were declared public holidays in the early 2000s.\n|-\n|Ganesh Chaturthi\n|Between August and September\n|Hindu Festival of Marathi community in Mauritius\n|Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated by the Marathi-speaking community in Mauritius on the 4th day of the lunar month of the Hindu calendar. It marks the birthday of Lord Ganesha, the Hindu deity of wisdom and remover of all obstacles according to Hindu mythology.\n|-\n|Divali\n|Between October and November\n|Hindu Festival\n|Divali is the most jovial of all Hindu festivals. Celebrated in October/November it marks the victory of righteousness over evil in the Hindu mythology. Traditionally, clay oil lamps were placed in front of every home turning the island into a fairyland of flickering lights; these have now been replaced mostly by decorative electric lights.\n|-\n|All Saints' Day\n|1 November\n|Christian Festival\n|During odd years, and All Saints' Day in even years. The decision to alternate between the two dates was a government decision to avoid increasing the number of unworked days after Abolition of Slavery (1 February) and Arrival of Indian indentured labourers (2 November) were declared public holidays in the early 2000s.\n|-\n|Eid Ul-Fitr**\n|Any time of year because Islam is based on a lunar calendar\n|Muslim Festival\n|The exact date of this festival is subject to confirmation as its celebration depends on the visibility of the moon. Eid-Ul-Fitr** is celebrated to mark the end of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fasting. It is a day of thanksgiving and rejoicing for Muslims. Special prayers are offered at mosques during that morning.\n|}\nMajor events without public holidays\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name of Events\n!Date/ Month of the year based on Gregorian calendar\n!Ethnic/Religious Group\n!Description\n|-\n|Chinese Food and Cultural Festival\n|End of April or Early May\n|Chinese event\n|An annual event which takes place in the Chinatown in Port-Louis; it is organized by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. A festival which celebrates Chinese culture, include Chinese culinary and dance. Foreign performers from China and locals may also perform on that event. It started in 2005.\n|-\n|Dragon Boat Festival\n|Between End of May and beginning June, dependent on the Chinese calendar\n|Chinese Festival\nSino-Mauritian and Overseas Chinese living in Mauritius\n|Dragon Boat Festival is celebrated to commemorate Qu Yuan; tradition include eating zongzi. Dragon Boat Festival has become a major annual event in Mauritius over the years, with Chinese dance events and Dragon Boat race competition.

Guan Di is an important deity for Sino-Mauritians, especially for people in the business field. It is an important event in the city of Port Louis.\n|-\n|Père Laval Pilgrimage\n|8 September\n|Christian Festival\n|The death of Father Jacques Désiré Laval is commemorated on the 9 September. Mauritians, regardless of age throughout the island, leave their houses and start on a long march to the shrine of Father Jacques Désiré Laval in Sainte Croix.\n|}\nClothing of Mauritius\nFashion in Mauritius is also influenced by formality-related rules, personal preference, differences between urban and rural lifestyles, and the diverse origins of the Mauritian population, including ethno-religious identity. Mauritians of all backgrounds wear bright colours, especially Mauritian women. Flip-flops (locally known as 'savat'), which are suitable for the Mauritian climate, are worn by all Mauritians regardless of their cultural background.\nBeachwear and tight or revealing clothing is acceptable in many resorts but not considered appropriate in towns and villages. Both Western-style clothing and traditional ethnic clothing are worn in Mauritius.\nCuisine\ndish of curry with rice and a salad]]\nThe cuisine of Mauritius is a blend of African, French and other European cuisines, as well as Chinese, and Indian influences. It is common for a combination of cuisines to form part of the same meal.\nBeef and pork are not commonly found in restaurants given dietary restrictions of Hindus and Muslims.\nMauritius has had strong ties with French culture throughout its history and was left with a very French \"savoir vivre\". Even today, the popularity of French dishes like the bouillon, tuna salad, daube, civet de lièvre or coq au vin served with good wine show the prevalence of French culture in Mauritius. As the years passed by, some have been adapted to the more exotic ingredients of the island to confer some unique flavour.\nDuring the 19th century, after the abolition of slavery, Indian workers who migrated to Mauritius brought their cuisine with them. Those indentured labourers came from different parts of India, each with their own culinary tradition, depending on the region. Traces of both northern and southern Indian cuisine can be found in Mauritius. Some common preparations are curry, chutney, rougaille poisson sale (tomato paste that is very popular with fish) and pickles, most of which use local ingredients. The Mauritian versions of those dishes have a local flavour and differ, at times considerably, from the original Indian recipes.\nThe end of the 19th century saw the arrival of Chinese migrants, who came mostly from the south-eastern part of China. They are largely credited with making rice, the staple diet of the island, and making noodles, both steamed and fried, popular. Chinese appetizers such as taken (local version of the spring roll with a flour batter replacing the traditional rolled wrapping), crispy chicken and crispy squid have become part of the Mauritian folklore. Furthermore, Chinese and other Asian restaurants are present all around the island, and offer a variety of chicken, squid, mutton and fish dishes, most typically prepared in black bean sauce or oyster sauce. Mauritian families often consider dinner at an Asian restaurant a treat.\nAlong the years, each of the country's communities has adapted and mixed each other's cuisine to their liking.\nThe production of rum is common throughout the island. Sugar cane was first introduced on the island when the Dutch colonised it in 1638. Even then, the propensity of making rum out of sugar cane was strongly recognised. Sugar cane was mainly cultivated for the production of \"arrack\", a precursor to rum. Only much later, after almost 60 years, was the first proper sugar produced.\nHowever, it was during the French and English administration that sugar production was fully exploited, which considerably contributed to the economic development of the island. It was Pierre Charles François Harel who in 1850 initially proposed the concept of a local distillation of rum in Mauritius. In part due to his efforts, Mauritius today houses three distilleries (Grays, Medine and St Aubin) and is in the process of opening an additional three.\nWhile not as famed as its Caribbean counterparts from Cuba, Jamaica or Barbados, Mauritian rum is slowly gaining exposure on the international stage and is considered by local stakeholders as an area of potential growth.\nLanguage and literature\nLanguage\nCurrently, the official language of Mauritius is the English language. The British colonial legacy in Mauritius is reflected in the use of the English language in governmental documents and communications; however, English is rarely used in public life and in daily conversation. Mauritians working in the tourism industry are fluent in English, however; English is also taught in school and is the working language of government and businesses.\nFrench is the ancestral language of the Franco-Mauritians. The presence of French settlers left an important mark on the ethnic composition of Mauritius in the form of the Franco-Mauritians; despite being a minority group, the Franco-Mauritians strongly affected the rest of the population through the use of the French language. As the French language was associated with high culture in Mauritius, the educated and the business class commonly spoke French. Nowadays, business and social aspects of life, as well as the media (including daily newspapers), literature and many cultural expressions in Mauritius, are dominated by the French language. Most Mauritians are more comfortable speaking French than English, and French is used by all ethnic groups.\nMauritian Creole evolved from the pidgin used by the French slave masters of the 18th century to communicate with their slaves, and incorporated words from African and Malagasy dialects. Mauritian Creole is understood and spoken by all Mauritians regardless of ethnic background.Mauritian Creole was initially not taught at school due to what was considered 'a lack of prestige' due to its association with the local Creole population and was perceived as a form of 'broken French'. It was only in January 2012 that Mauritian Creole was officially introduced in the National Curriculum Framework and became an optional language subject for primary school students.\nMost ethnic groups in Mauritius have an ancestral language. Due to the presence of Mauritians of Indian and Chinese descent, Asian languages, which include Bhojpuri, Hindi, Mandarin, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu, are commonly spoken. Most of these languages act as significant religious and ethnic identity markers. Asian languages are taught at schools, and the ethnic background of a student predominately influences his choice of Asian language.\nLiterature\nWhile kreol morisien (Mauritian Creole) is the most-spoken language in Mauritius, most of the literature is written in French, although many authors write in English, Bhojpuri, and Morisien (Mauritian Creole), and others such as Abhimanyu Unnuth and Pahlad Ramsurrun in Hindi.  Mauritius's renowned playwright Dev Virahsawmy writes exclusively in Morisyen.\nImportant authors include Eugénie Poujade, Malcolm de Chazal, Ananda Devi, Raymond Chasle, Loys Masson, Marcel Cabon, Lindsey Collen, and Edouard Maunick. Other younger writers like Shenaz Patel, Amal Sewtohul, Natacha Appanah, Alain Gordon-Gentil and Carl de Souza explore the issues of ethnicity, superstition and politics in their novels.\nLegends and folklore stories\nMany people in Mauritius, in particular those living in rural areas, believe in witchcraft and paranormal activities; this is very likely to be the combination of African, Malagasy, Indian, Chinese and European folk traditions.\nCalèche de Lallmatie\nCalèche de Lallmatie (lit. \"Chariot of Lallmatie\" in English) is a Mauritian legend around the village of Lallmatie which says that two women dressed in white riding two white horses were seen at night, close to midnight. The legend appeared some years prior to the appearance of Touni Mniwi phenomenon.\nLougarou\nLougarou (lit. \"werewolf\" in English; from the French term \"Loup garou\") is a notorious figure which appears in Mauritian folklore, which is mostly used to scare children; its appearance may result from the combination of French and African folklore stories. The Lougarou appears at full moon and brings trouble to the local population. Protection against the Lougarou is believed to be given if a person consults a longanis (i.e. a local sorcerer) or a treter (i.e. witch doctor).\nTouni Minwi\nThe legend of Touni Minwi (lit. \"Naked at Midnight\") appeared in 1994 following Cyclone Hollanda; the cyclone had led to the destruction of many houses and electricity shortages. Touni Minwi was supposedly a form of Lougarou, who would visit women in their homes at night. This led to hysteria among the local population; many witnesses would affirm having seen frightful manifestations at night time, including apparitions of Lougarou.  The Touni Minwi phenomenon led to a large mobilization of people in the capital, Port Louis, and in the village of Lallmatie.\nMountain-related legends or folk stories\nLe Morne Brabant and the Maroons\nAccording to the legend, the maroons decided to jump to their death from Le Morne Brabant when they misunderstood the presence of a group of soldiers who were supposed to inform them that they were emancipated following the Slavery Abolition Act passed by the British. Fearing recapture and being returned to their former masters, they decided to commit suicide.\nPieter Both and the Milkman\nPieter Both Mountain is one of the most emblematic places in Mauritius; it is characterized by a rock which looks like a human head on its top. According to a famous local legend, a milkman from the village of Crève Coeur (which is also located at the foot of the mountain) used to sell milk in the surrounding villages. One day, the milkman decided to take a shortcut through Pieter Both to reach the next village; when walking, he felt tired and decided to rest. When he woke up, he saw fairies dancing and singing; the fairies told him not to tell anyone about what they saw or he would be turned into stone. The milkman, however, could not prevent himself and told the story to his friends. When the milkman returned to Pieter Both, the fairies knew that he did not keep the secret and turned him into stone. The head of milkman is the top of the mountain. The rock, which is perched on the tip of Pieter Both, is therefore believed to be the milkman.\nLandmarks, architecture, and monuments of significance\nWorld Heritage Sites\nAapravasi Ghat\nThe Aapravasi Ghat is found in the bay of Trou Fanfaron in Port Louis; it is the place where indentured Indian labour system started. In 1834, following the emancipation of slaves, the British used Mauritius as their first site to experiment the use of contracted 'free (indentured) labour' from the poorest parts of India to replace the use of slaves. The Aapravasi Ghat is the remnants of an immigration depot built in 1849 to receive the influx of indentured labourers coming from India, Eastern Africa, Madagascar, China and Southeast Asia to start a new life of work on the sugar plantations. The Aapravasi Ghat site is owned by the Ministry of Arts and Culture. The property is protected as National Heritage under the National Heritage Fund Act 2003 and the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund Act 2001. It was listed in the World Heritage List in 2006.\nLe Morne Cultural Landscape\nLe Morne Brabant is found in the southwest of Mauritius; it used to shelter escaped slaves, called maroons, throughout the 18th to 19th centuries. The Mauritian oral traditions associated with the maroons have made Le Morne a symbol of the slaves’ fight for freedom, their suffering, and their sacrifice. It was listed in the World Heritage List in 2008. The International Slave Route Monument, located at the foot of Le Morne Brabant, was established in 2009 due to its association with a historical and legendary place, called the 'Valley of Bones'. According to the legend, the maroons decided to jump to their death from Le Morne Brabant when they misunderstood the presence of a group of soldiers who were supposed to inform them that they were emancipated following the Slavery Abolition Act passed by the British. Fearing to be recaptured and be returned to their former masters, they decided to commit suicide.\nChinese cultural landmarks\nChinatown of Mauritius, Port Louis\nThe Chinatown of Mauritius is situated in Port Louis. The Chinatown emerged in a city which is marked by the strong racial segregation of the 18th century. A small Chinatown was already forming in Port Louis in the mid-1780s, and in the mid-1840s, Port Louis market was dominated by Chinese traders. The Chinatown was also divided by the Cantonese and the Hakka who showed hostility towards each other. Port Louis Chinatown was originally developed around the shops of Fujianese and Cantonese immigrants in the north of Royal Road and was further expanded in the 20th century. The Cantonese established their own neighbourhood at Royal Road and extended along Arsenal Road to La Rampe Road; they opened shops, restaurants, Kwongs (societies) and religious associations, which include the Chan Cha (founded prior to 1874). Between the 1910s and 1920s, Hakka commerce started to extend beyond the limits of the Old China Town along Royal Road; Hakka business would later expand to the South of Royal Road.In the 1940s, there was an influx of Chinese immigrants who arrived in Mauritius to open more businesses, and decided to settle around Royal Road in the heart of Port Louis, further developing what is currently known as the Mauritian Chinatown.\nThe Chinatown also houses the Heritage Court, which is the headquarters of the Namshun Society (also known as the Nam Shun Fooy Kwoon (南顺会馆)). The Namshun Society was initiated by early Cantonese migrants from Nanhai and Shunde (who became known as \"Nam Shun\" (南顺) in Mauritius) since 1859, when the early migrants formed an informal association of mutual help; it was officially registered on 26 June 1894. The founding father of the Namshun society was Affan Tank Wen.\nIn 2018, the New Chinatown Foundation was established with the common goal of reviving the Chinatown, as well as restoring and preserving its cultural heritage.\nChinese pagodas\nChinese pagodas throughout Mauritius are important sites for Sino-Mauritians as these are where traditional ceremonies and festivals take place. It was common practice for Chinese migrants to donate money to the pagodas which they frequently go to.Cantonese clan groupings also set up their own pagodas. Cantonese pagodas included Chan Cha Pagoda (found at Arsenal Road), Tiong Fa Pagoda (found on La Rampe Road), Fok Diak Pagoda (found at Rémy Ollier Road and built in 1846), and Sweet-Hang Pagoda (found on David Road). Nam Shun Fooy Kwoon has pagodas which are located next to the Champs de Mars in Port Louis, consisting of the Kwang Tee (Guan Di) Pagoda (first built in 1895, a new building was inaugurated in November 1980), where a shrine for the dead (jiu sin sun wai) for the Cantonese community is found to allow the souls of the deceased to rest, and the Tin Hao (Mazu) Pagoda; they also have an altar for the God of Good Fortune, Choy Sun.\nKwan Tee Pagoda, Port Louis\nThe Kwan Tee Pagoda (or Guan Di Pagoda) is located at Les Salines, Port Louis; it is the oldest pagoda in the Southern Hemisphere and in Mauritius. Its location and construction follow the Chinese principles of spirituality by facing the sea and being against the mountains. It was built in 1842 by Hahime Choisanne and his followers. The Cohan Tai Biou Society (which existed since 1819 and was founded by Log Choisanne) is responsible for the administration of the Kwan Tee Pagoda. Guan Di is an important deity for Sino-Mauritians, especially for people who have businesses. The cult of Guan Di is associated with the god of wealth; Guan Di is also the god of war and of the righteous and of the benefactor. Inside the pagoda, there is the altar of Mazu, who is a protector of sailors, and Guan Yin. There is also an ancestor cult altar, with the oldest tablet dating around 1841. Following Chinese tradition, religious services are typically conducted one week after death at the pagoda and the ancestral tablet of the deceased with his name written in Chinese characters is deposited behind the altar. On Chinese New Year, descendants of the deceased can practice the ancestral rites before the ancestral tablets as a sign of respect. The Kwan Tee Pagoda has also been listed in the National Heritage List since 2016.\nMusic and dance\nMusic found in Mauritius has the sounds and rhythms of Western, Eastern, and African civilizations which result from the preserved legacy transmitted by the ancestors of the Mauritians to their descendants. Traditional dances and music were introduced by Indian and Chinese migrants to Mauritius. The most well-known Traditional Chinese dance in Mauritius is the Dragon dance and the Lion dance. Western music and dance are also well represented in Mauritius, where rap, hip-hop, Jazz, and waltz (along with all types of ballroom dancing) can be found. There is also a strong following of oldies music, dating from 1960s and 1970s; performers such as Elvis Presley, Cliff Richard, and Engelbert Humperdinck are part of the national musical heritage.\nSome sounds and rhythms from various ethnic backgrounds have also merged to form unique forms of rhythm and sound. The most typical folkloric dance is the Sega, which is of African origin; the Sega was originally danced and sung by slaves before being adopted by all Mauritians. Seggae (a form of music which results from the mixture of the Sega and reggae) emerged in the 1980s, reflecting the mixed cultural aspect of Mauritius.\nNational symbols\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of national symbols\n!Symbols\n!Name\n!Images\n!Description\n|-\n|National anthem\n|\"Motherland\"\n|\n|The music was composed by Philippe Gentil, and the lyrics were written by Jean-Georges Prosper.

However recently, rugby union has rapidly increased in popularity in the small island nation. Football is also popular. Both national teams have very low world rankings for their particular sports.\nAt the 2008 Summer Olympics, Mauritius had won its first Olympic medal. Bruno Julie, a boxer, won the bronze medal.\nHowever, Mauritius is quite competitive at the regional level (Inter-Ile) in the Indian Ocean. Mauritius has collected some gold, silver and bronze medals at the Jeux des Iles de l'Océan Indien (JIOI). The second and the fifth editions were hosted by Mauritius in 1985 and 2003 respectively. Mauritius also organised the JIOI in 2019, where the Mauritian athletes dominated the games and won numerous gold medals and the competition.\nAs in countries like Malaysia, football is hugely popular among males, especially England's Premier League. The most followed clubs are Liverpool F.C., Manchester United and Arsenal F.C. Owing to their recent successes, FC Barcelona have gained significant support.\nThe national sport, however, remains horse racing, which is part and parcel of the island's cultural heritage. Horse racing in Mauritius dates back to 1812, when the Champ de Mars Racecourse was inaugurated, making it the oldest racecourse in the Southern Hemisphere. Races are widely followed, both in terms of attendance at the Champ de Mars and viewership by television audiences. Mauritians of all ages like to discuss races, share tips and place bets.\nAt an amateur and recreational level, there is a growing culture of participation in sport, with trail running, cycling, mountain biking and water sports becoming increasingly accessible and popular.\nBasketball has also been steadily rising in popularity. The national men’s team competes in FIBA Africa pre-qualifiers but has yet to reach the AfroBasket finals or World Cup. Youth development programs have launched nine “basketball schools” nationwide to teach fundamentals and channel talent to elite centres.\nSee also\n* Drugs in Mauritius\n* Flag of Mauritius\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050209222948/http://www.masa.mu/ Mauritius Society of Authors]\n*[http://www.restaurants.mu Mauritius Restaurants Guide]\n*[http://www.lehman.cuny.edu/ile.en.ile/indien/paroles.html île en îleLiterature of the Indian Ocean], biographies, bibliographies, excerpts and links.\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080405015708/http://www.mauritianmuslim.co.uk/Islam%20in%20mauritius.shtml Islam in Mauritius]\n*[http://www.island-of-mauritius.com/mauritius_festivals.html Festivals in Mauritius]\n*[http://www.eglise.mu Local network of churches]\n*[http://mauritiusattractions.com/national-holidays-and-festivals-i-39.html Mauritius National Holidays and Festivals]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131013173253/http://mauritius-conference-centre.com/ Trianon Conference Centre, Mauritius]\n*[http://www.mauritiuscuisine.com Free recipes of Mauritius]\n*"
