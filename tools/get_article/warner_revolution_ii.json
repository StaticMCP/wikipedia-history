Its  span wing lacks flaps and has a wing area of . The acceptable power range is  and the standard engines used are the  Continental O-240 or the  Lycoming O-290 powerplants.\nThe Revolution II has a typical empty weight of  and a gross weight of , giving a useful load of .  With full fuel of  the payload for the pilot, passenger and baggage is .\nThe standard day, sea level, no wind takeoff with a  engine is  and the landing roll is .\nOperational history\nIn May 2014, 19 examples were registered in the United States with the Federal Aviation Administration, although a total of 30 had been registered at one time.\nSpecifications (Revolution II)\n|more general=\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=Lycoming O-290\n|eng1 type=four cylinder, air-cooled, four stroke aircraft engine\n|eng1 kw=\n|eng1 hp=125\n|prop blade number=2\n|prop name=metal, fixed pitch\n|prop dia m=\n|prop dia ft=\n|prop dia in=\n|prop note=\n|perfhide=\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=\n|max speed kts=\n|max speed note=\n|cruise speed kmh=\n|cruise speed mph=115\n|cruise speed kts=\n|cruise speed note=\n|stall speed kmh=\n|stall speed mph=42\n|stall speed kts=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|never exceed speed mph=160\n|never exceed speed kts=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|range km=\n|range miles=300\n|range nmi=\n|range note=\n|endurance=\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling ft=14000\n|ceiling note=\n|g limits=\n|roll rate=\n|glide ratio=\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate ftmin=1200\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|lift to drag=\n|wing loading kg/m2=\n|wing loading lb/sqft=11.1\n|wing loading note=\n|power/mass=\n|thrust/weight=\n|more performance=\n|avionics=\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
