It is now a regular guest at major European festivals for early music and has repeatedly recorded newly discovered music from the Renaissance and early Baroque periods, which has been positively received by musical experts.\nThe ensemble is geared towards the best possible representation of the respective repertoire and is therefore variable in its instrumentation. In addition to international vocal soloists, highly specialised instrumentalists for the original instruments of the respective epoch will be engaged. The aim is a lively and at the same time stylistically correct rendition of the works of the 16th and 17th centuries. In addition to the performance of Italian, Flemish, English and Central German composers, special attention is paid to North German music.\nThe director of the ensemble, which was founded in 1993, is Manfred Cordes, a lecturer at the Hochschule für Künste Bremen.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* [https://www.ndr.de/ndrkultur/programm/titelliste1212.html?date=2019-06-23&hour=22 Titelliste] (radio program) NDR 23 June 2019\n* [http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2002/Jun02/FestiveHanseaticMusic_WeserRenai.htm Festive Hanseatic Music / Works by Julius Johann Weiland, Julius Ernst Rautenstein, Heinrich Albert, Andreas Hakenberger, Philipp Dulichius, Christoph Bernhard, Dietrich Becker, Matthias Weckmann, Jocaob Obrecht, Orlando Di Lasso, Andries Pevernage and Clemens non papa.] musicweb-international.com June 2002"
