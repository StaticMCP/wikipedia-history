It is a 2-story, side hall, mid-19th-century Greek Revival–style dwelling with a -story, Queen Anne–style addition.  It was the home of noted artist Edward Hopper (1882–1967) from the time of his birth until he moved to Manhattan in 1910.  He held title to the house until his death.\nThe house was built in 1858 by the artist's maternal grandfather, John Smith.  The house served as Hopper's primary residence until 1910.  After graduating from Nyack High School in 1899, Edward commuted to New York City, where he had enrolled at the New York School of Illustrating. He soon transferred to the New York School of Art.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.\nEdward Hopper House Art Center\nThe house is now the Edward Hopper House Art Center, which features one gallery dedicated to Hopper's life and work, and other galleries for changing exhibits.  The center also offers workshops, lectures, jazz concerts, figure drawing and other classes.\nSee also\n* Nyack, New York\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.hopperhouse.org/ Edward Hopper House Art Center]"
