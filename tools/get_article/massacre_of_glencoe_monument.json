Its design is based on the elaborate Gosforth Cross.  An annual wreath-laying ceremony is held at the Monument to commemorate those who fell in the massacre.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Donaldson, M.E.M., \"[https://www.ambaile.org.uk/detail/en/9980/1/EN9980-macdonald-monument-glencoe-village.htm MacDonald Monument, Glencoe Village]\", Am Baile: highland history and culture, ambaile.org.uk (retrieved 29 Oct 2019): monument photograph from first half of 20th century."
