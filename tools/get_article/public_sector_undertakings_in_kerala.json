Public sector undertakings in Kerala, i.e. enterprises in which majority shareholder is Government of Kerala are generally divided into Manufacturing & Non-Manufacturing. Some of the PSUs such as Kinfra, KSIDC, SIDCO etc. are promotional agencies. As of 2004 there were 104 enterprises spread over 14 different sectors of Kerala economy. These sectors are as varied as engineering, electronics to wood products & welfare agencies. Eleven units are joint venture of Kerala government with the central government. Most of state PSUs units are under Department of Industries & Commerce (85 enterprises).\nThe largest enterprises (Based on 2005 figures)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n!

As per CAG report for 2008-2009, Kerala PSUs lack accountability, and needs improvement for imbibing professionalism and efficiency. It showed an incurred loss of 589 crore. Losses in PSUs were attributed to poor financial management, planning, implementation of projects, running of operations and monitoring. In 2012–13, out of the 78 PSUs which had finalised their accounts during that fiscal year, 45 PSUs earned a total profit of 666.86 crore and 31 PSUs incurred loss of 607.34 crore, as per CAG report. Kerala State Beverages Corporation was the most profit making PSU, while the Kerala State Electricity Board incurred an operational loss of 3,758.17 crore.\nIn a 2016 study, Kochi-based think tank Centre for Public Policy and Research stated that Kerala government should take a cue from the disinvestment process initiated at the Centre and initiate it at the State level, as Kerala has the case of large number of PSUs in the state that were closed, as they were not able to withstand the competition in the market. During the fiscal year 2016-2017, PSUs in Kerala incurred a net loss of ₹80.67 crore. According to Kerala's state industrial department, the PSUs had a combined net profit of 106.91 crore in 2017-2018; there were total 42 PSUs.
