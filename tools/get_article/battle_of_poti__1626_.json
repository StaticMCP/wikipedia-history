In early 1626, he gathered 60 chaykas for a raid on the Black sea coast of Caucasus. Before this, the Zaporozhian and Don Cossacks led by Oleksiy Shafran jointly raided Trabzon.\nCossack campaign and battle\nIn the spring of 1626, the Cossack fleet that consisted of 60 chaykas had set off for a raid to the coast of Georgia. The Cossack squadron reached the mouth of river Rioni near Poti, where it was caught up and defeated by the Ottoman fleet. The Cossacks lost 30 chaykas – 20 were destroyed and 10 were captured.\nAftermath\nDespite the defeat, Cossacks continued their campaigns on the sea. In summer of the same year, the Zaporozhian and Don Cossacks had set off on a raid to the Bosporus, where they fought an unsuccessful battle against an Ottoman fleet and lost approximately 25 chaykas. In October 1626, the Cossacks of Mykhailo Doroshenko jointly with the Polish units of Stanislaw Chmielecki defeated the Tatar raiders at Bila Tserkva.\nNotes\nReferences"
