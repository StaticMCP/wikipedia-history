It was the 41st running of the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes.\nThe winner was Fahd Salman's Generous, a three-year-old chestnut colt trained at Whatcombe in Oxfordshire by Paul Cole and ridden by Alan Munro. Generous's victory gave his owner, trainer and jockey their first win in the race.\nThe race\nThe race attracted a field of nine runners, all trained in the United Kingdom. The favourite was Generous, who had won the Epsom Derby by five lengths before defeating Suave Dancer in the Irish Derby. Two of Generous's best regarded challengers were trained by Michael Stoute: Saddler's Hall was a three-year-old colt who had bypassed the Derby but won the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot by six lengths, whilst the four-year-old Rock Hopper had won the Hardwicke Stakes and the 1991 Princess of Wales's Stakes. Another major contender was Sanglamore, the Henry Cecil-trained winner of the Prix du Jockey Club and the Prix d'Ispahan. Clive Brittain's Newmarket stable had three runners: the dual Earl of Sefton Stakes winner Terimon, the Chester Vase runner-up Luchiroverte and the Derby Italiano winner Hailsham. The other runners were Tiger Flower, the only female contender, and Sapience, the winner of the Ebor Handicap and the 1990 Princess of Wales's Stakes. Generous headed the betting at odds of 4/6 ahead of Saddler's Hall (6/1), Sanglamore (7/1) and Rock Hopper (8/1).\nHailsham went into the lead from the start and set a strong pace from Saddler's Hall, Luchiroverte and Generous. When Hailsham began to weaken with five furlongs left to run, Saddler's Hall took the advantage and led the field into the straight ahead of Generous, Luchiroverte  and Rock Hopper, with Sanglamore making progress on the outside. Two furlongs from the finish, Generous accelerated past Saddler's Hall and quickly went several lengths clear of the field. Sanglamore moved into second place but could make no impression on the leader. Generous won easily by seven lengths from Sanglamore, with Rock Hopper and Terimon in third and fourth places. Sapience came home fifth ahead of Saddler's Hall, with long gaps back to Luchiroverte, Tiger Flower and Hailsham.\nRace details\n* Sponsor: De Beers\n* Purse: £451,600; First prize: £278,480\n* Surface: Turf\n* Going: Good\n* Distance: 12 furlongs\n* Number of runners: 9\n* '''Winner's time: 2:28.99\nFull result\n{| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-  style=\"background:#7d7; text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"width:35px;\"| Pos.\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| Marg.\n! style=\"width:160px;\"| Horse (bred)\n! style=\"width:30px;\"| Age\n! style=\"width:160px;\"| Jockey\n! style=\"width:210px;\"| Trainer (Country)\n! style=\"width:50px;\"| Odds\n|-\n| 1\n|\n| Generous (IRE)\n| 3\n| Alan Munro\n| Paul Cole (GB)\n| 4/6 fav\n|-\n| 2'\n| 7\n| Sanglamore (IRE)\n| 4\n| Pat Eddery\n| Roger Charlton (GB)\n| 7/1\n|-\n| 3\n| 1\n| Rock Hopper (GB)\n| 4\n| Bruce Raymond\n| Michael Stoute (GB)\n| 7/1\n|-\n| 4\n| 1½\n| Terimon (GB)\n| 5\n| Michael Roberts\n| Clive Brittain (GB)\n| 18/1\n|-\n| 5\n| 2\n| Sapience (IRE)\n| 5\n| Willie Carson\n| Jimmy Fitzgerald (GB)\n| 40/1\n|-\n| 6\n| 3½''\n| Saddlers' Hall (IRE)\n| 3\n| Lester Piggott\n| Michael Stoute (GB)\n| 6/1\n|-\n| 7\n| 10\n| Luchiroverte (IRE)\n| 3\n| Frankie Dettori\n| Clive Brittain (GB)\n| 66/1\n|-\n| 8\n| 15\n| Tiger Flower (GB)\n| 4\n| Steve Cauthen\n| Henry Cecil (GB)\n| 10/1\n|-\n| 9\n| 30\n| Hailsham (CAN)\n| 3\n| Ray Cochrane\n| Clive Brittain (GB)\n| 100/1\n|}\n* Abbreviations: nse = nose; nk = neck; shd = head; hd = head; dist = distance; UR = unseated rider\nWinner's details\nFurther details of the winner, Generous\n* Sex: Colt\n* Foaled: 8 February 1988\n* Country: Ireland\n* Sire: Caerleon; Dam: Doff The Derby (Master Derby)\n* Owner: Fahd Salman\n* Breeder: Barronstown Stud\nReferences"
