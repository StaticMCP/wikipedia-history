It is the second installment of a \"trilogy\", also comprising Empire (2000) and Commonwealth (2009).\nSummary\nMultitude is divided into three sections: \"War,\" which addresses the current \"global civil war\";  \"Multitude,\" which elucidates the \"multitude\" as an \"active social subject, which acts on the basis of what the singularities share in common\"; and, \"Democracy,\" which critiques traditional forms of political representation and gestures toward alternatives.\nMultitude addresses these issues and elaborates on the assertion, in the Preface to Empire, that:\n\"The creative forces of the multitude that sustain Empire are also capable of autonomously constructing a counter-Empire, an alternative political organization of global flows and exchanges.\"\nNotes\nFurther reading\n* Welsh, John.
