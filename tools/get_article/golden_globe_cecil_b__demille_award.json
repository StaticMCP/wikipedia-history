DeMille Award is an honorary Golden Globe Award bestowed by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) for \"outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment\". The HFPA board of directors selects the honorees from a variety of actors, directors, writers and producers who have made a significant mark in the film industry. It was first presented at the 9th Golden Globe Awards ceremony in February 1952 and is named in honor of its first recipient, director Cecil B. DeMille. The HFPA chose DeMille due to his prestige in the industry and his \"internationally recognized and respected name\". DeMille received the award the year his penultimate film, The Greatest Show on Earth, premiered. A year later in 1953, the award was presented to producer Walt Disney.\nThe award has been presented annually since 1952, with exceptions being 1976, 2008, 2022, and 2024. The second incident was due to the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike's cancellation of that year's ceremony. The award that year was meant to honor director Steven Spielberg, but due to the cancellation of the ceremony, the award was presented to him the following year. The third occurrence resulted from various media companies, actors, and other creatives boycotting the awards in protest over its lack of action to increase the membership diversity of the HFPA. In 2024, the award was shelved to make way for additional categories at that year's ceremony.\nThe youngest honoree was actress Judy Garland, at age 39 in 1962. Garland was also the first female honoree. The oldest honoree was producer Samuel Goldwyn, at age 93 in 1973. In 1982, Sidney Poitier became the first African-American recipient. In 2018, Oprah Winfrey became the first African-American woman to receive the honor. As of 2025, 71 honorees have received the Cecil B. DeMille Award: 18 women and 53 men. The award has notably been presented to two members of the same family: with Jane Fonda receiving the award in 2021, 41 years after it was presented to her father Henry Fonda.\nList of honorees\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Year of ceremony, name of honoree, nationality, and his or her official HFPA description\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"1%\"|Year\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" width=\"1%\"|Image\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"5%\"|Honorees\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"5%\"|Nationality\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" width=\"30%\"|Description\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" width=\"1%\"|\n|-\n| 1952\n|\n! scope=\"row\"|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \"A Hollywood pioneer, he directed and produced films such as The Ten Commandments (1923), The King of Kings (1927), The Greatest Show on Earth (1952) and The Ten Commandments (1956).\"\n|\n|-\n| 1953\n|\n! scope=\"row\"|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \"In 1928, he created Steamboat Willie introducing Mickey Mouse, and from that point there was no stopping the king of family entertainment in the U.S.\"\n|\n|-\n| 1954\n|\n! scope=\"row\"|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \"Child actor at 8, World War I soldier at 15 (he lied about his age), bantamweight boxer, screenwriter, producer and co-founder of 20th Century Fox.\"\n|\n|-\n| 1955\n|\n! scope=\"row\"|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \"A Dane who came to Hollywood in 1914 when he was 28 and became a leading character actor and well-known humanitarian.\"\n|\n|-\n| 1956\n|\n! scope=\"row\"|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \"Youngest of twelve children of Jewish immigrants from Poland who, with three brothers, established Warner Bros. which he ran with a firm hand until 1967.\"\n|\n|-\n| 1957\n|\n! scope=\"row\"|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \"Child actor and newsboy who started in the wardrobe department in 1919 and became a top director/producer.\"\n|\n|-\n| 1958\n|\n! scope=\"row\"|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \"Began as a writer and always looked for the strong story, as evidenced in the films during his time as the head of production for 20th Century Fox.\"\n|\n|-\n| 1959\n|\n! scope=\"row\"|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \"The beloved Frenchman came to Hollywood in 1929 but was denied re-entry in 1935 due to his political views.
