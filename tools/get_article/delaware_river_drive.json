      "text": "# Delaware River Drive\n\nDelaware River Drive was a state highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey.\nRoute description\nA 1913 map of the proposed New Jersey State Highway System with an accompanying report shows the route of the Delaware River Drive beginning at the State Capitol on West State Street in Trenton. It then followed West State Street and Sanhican Drive to the city limits, then followed present-day Route&nbsp;175 to present-day Route&nbsp;29 to Frenchtown.\nFrom Frenchtown north, the Delaware River Drive followed County Route&nbsp;619 (CR&nbsp;619) into Milford, where it met CR&nbsp;519, following CR&nbsp;519 a short distance to the center of Milford. North of Milford, the route followed CR&nbsp;627 as far as Riegelsville, then continued along River Road to Carpentersville, and Carpentersville Road to Phillipsburg.\nThe Delaware River Drive continued north of Phillipsburg on present-day CR&nbsp;646 to CR&nbsp;519, following CR&nbsp;519 through Harmony and Roxburg to CR&nbsp;620, which took the drive into Belvidere, the county seat of Warren County, and beyond to U.S. Route 46 (US&nbsp;46).\nThe route then followed the present US&nbsp;46 through Manunka Chunk to Columbia; the Delaware River Drive between Columbia and Dunnfield has been obliterated since 1953 by an alignment of the former US&nbsp;611, now part of Interstate&nbsp;80 (I-80).\nNorth of I-80, The Delaware River Drive follows the historic Old Mine Road for much of its route to the New York state line at Montague Township in Sussex County. Much of this section is through the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area. North of US&nbsp;206, the Delaware River Drive follows CR&nbsp;521.\nHistory\nLegislated in 1911, this was New Jersey's second state highway. Legislation in 1913 provided for the extension of the Delaware River Drive to Cape May.\nThe Egan Bill of 1916, and the Edge Bill of 1917 did not provide for a route along the Delaware River; the Delaware River Drive may be considered to have been decommissioned by these acts.\nThis route, and the Ocean Highway predated any highway numbering system in New Jersey, and may be considered a transition between the early auto trails\nand modern state highways.\nSee also\n*\n*\nReferences"
