Carles Tusquets was the preceding interim President of the club who took over from Josep Maria Bartomeu after the latter resigned on 27 October 2020. However, Tusquets did not contest the elections. 9 pre candidates ran for the presidency. These include former club President Joan Laporta, Victor Font, Emili Rousaud, Toni Freixa, Jordi Farre, Augusti Benedito, Xavi Vilajoana, Lluis Fernández and Pere Riera.\nIn order to advance to the main election the candidates had to collect a minimum of 2,257 signatures from club members. Joan Laporta, Victor Font and Toni Freixa were the only remaining candidates.\nOn 6 March, a day before the election, the club received a total of 20,663 votes by post early as those many members did not want to vote at the polling stations and cause crowds due to the pandemic. The remaining votes were cast on 7 March. Joan Laporta won, returning as president of FC Barcelona with 54.28% of the vote. Victor Font came second with 29.99% of the vote and Toni Freixa came third with 8.58% of the vote.\nResults\n}}\nSee also\n* 2015 FC Barcelona presidential election\n* History of FC Barcelona\n* List of FC Barcelona presidents\nReferences"
