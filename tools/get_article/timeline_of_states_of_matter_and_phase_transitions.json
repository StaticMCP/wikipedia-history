His cycle includes evaporation of water, formation of clouds, snow and rain.\n* c. 77 AD – Pliny the Elder in his Natural History, concludes that clouds are formed by the condensation of air.\n* c. 439 AD – Proclus in his ''Commentary on Plato's Timaeus, categorizes the four elements using three binary qualities sharp/blunt, subtle/dense and mobile/inmobile.\nBefore 18th century\n* 7th century – Jabir ibn Hayyan (Geber) proposes four primary qualities: hotness, coldness, dryness, moistness. The classical elements can hold only two of these qualities. Metals internal qualities are different from their external qualities.\n* 1260 – First detailed description of snowflakes by Albertus Magnus.\n* 1471 – Alchemist George Ripley describes 12 main alchemical processes including congelation and sublimation.\n* 1530 – Alchemist Paracelsus proposes his theory of tria prima were primary elements being: a combustible element (sulfur), a liquid changeable element (mercury) and solid element (salt).\n* 1637. – René Descartes rejects the hypothesis that water vapor is the same as air.\n* 1648 – Jan Baptist van Helmont coins the term gas.\n* c. 1660 – Otto von Guericke carries experiment to demonstrate the artificial formation of fog.\n* 1669 – Johann Joachim Becher, influenced by Paracelsus, proposes a model in his Physica subterranea, where all matter is composed of the elements air, water and three earths: terra lapidea (vitrieous earth) related to its fusibility, terra fluida (mercurial earth) contributing to fluidity and volatility, and terra pinguis (fatty earth) related to combustibility and flammability.\n18th century\n* 1724 – Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit discovers supercooling, while developing the Fahrenheit scale.\n* 1730 – René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur develops the Réaumur scale, calibrated between the freezing point (0°R) and the boiling point of water (80°R).\n* 1742 – Anders Celsius develops the Celsius scale, calibrated where its 0°C are defined at the freezing point of water and 100°C at the boiling point of water.\n* 1751 – Charles Le Roy describes clouds as suspension of water.\n* 1756 – William Cullen provides the first demonstration of artificial refrigeration.\n* 1762 – Joseph Black discovers latent heat.\n* 1780 – Antoine Lavoisier postulates three states of matter: solids, liquids and vapors.\n* 1784 – Liquefaction of sulfur dioxide by compression and cooling by Jean-François Clouet and Gaspard Monge.\n19th century\n* 1822 – Charles Cagniard de la Tour discovers the critical point (called de la Tour point at the time). His experiments with sealed cannons mark the discovery of supercritical fluids.\n* 1823 – Systematic studies of the liquefaction of gases by Michael Faraday. He removes the distinction between vapour and gas.\n* 1824 – Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot publishes Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire,'' introducing the earliest version of Clausius–Clapeyron relation which characterizes the transition between two phases of matter.\n* 1834 – Émile Clapeyron works out his version of the Clausius–Clapeyron relation.\n* 1850 – Rudolf Clausius reformulates the Clausius–Clayperon relation.\n* 1861 – Dmitri Mendeleev establishes the critical temperature, he calls de la Tour point, the absolute boiling point.\n* 1869 – Thomas Andrews studies of liquefaction of gases. He standardizes and coins the term critical point, critical temperature and critical pressure. He also discovers critical opalescence.\n* 1868 – Dmitry Chernov introduces the critical points of steel.\n* 1873 – James Thomson coins the term triple point of water.\n* 1873 –Johannes Diderik van der Waals thesis. He explains that water-vapour transition by introducing van der Waals equation and the van der Waals force.\n* 1875 –James Clerk Maxwell introduces his Maxwell construction for state transitions.\n* 1875-1876 – Josiah Willard Gibbs introduces the concept of \"phase\". See also his phase rule published in \"On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances\" paper.\n* 1879  William Crookes first identifies plasma in laboratory\n* 1881 – John Aitken demonstrate that in fog, water condenses on particles in air. He also establishes the dew point.\n* 1888–1889 – Crystalline optical properties of liquid crystals and their ability to flow are first described by Friedrich Reinitzer and confirmed by Otto Lehmann.\n* 1887 – Floris Osmond introduces the different names for the phases of steel.\n* 1895 – Pierre Curie discovers that induced magnetization is proportional to magnetic field strength\n20th century\n* 1900 – Gustav Heinrich Tammann discovers the phases of ice: ice II and ice III.\n* 1911 – Heike Kamerlingh Onnes discloses his research on superconductivity\n* 1908 – Marian Smoluchowski explains critical opalescence with fluctuations of density.\n* 1912 – Peter Debye derives the  law for the low temperature heat capacity of a nonmetallic solid\n* 1912 – Percy Williams Bridgman, systematic study of the phases of ice.
