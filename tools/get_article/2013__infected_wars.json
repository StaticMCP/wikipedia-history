Even then, it still barely registers as above-average. Those specifically looking to play out a post-apocalyptic buddy movie situation on their iOS device will, however, doubtless find this a blast.\"\nDavid Clarke for TouchArcade rated the game 2 out of 5 stars, stating that \"2013: Infected Wars is a meal cooked ten years ago, frozen and reheated five times over, and served on a plate made out of a laserdisc copy of ''Uwe Boll's Alone in the Dark''. You can keep your 'console quality graphics and sound.' Just give me some inspiration.\"\nLee Hamlet for 148Apps, like Pocket Gamer, rated the game 3 out of 5 stars, stating that \"With 8 rather long and drawn out campaign levels, Infected Wars is a little too light on content for the steep price tag, though the multiplayer does provide some longevity. With some tightening up, this could become a solid third-person shooter and one of the best zombie games on the App Store. Currently though, it's not quite there.\"\nMatthew Pollesel for Gaming Age rated the game C, stating that \"In other words, not for any reason that’d be enough for me to make the leap from saying 'I loved 2013!' to 'I loved 2013…so you should too!' From any objective perspective, it's probably not worth your time, so unless you happen to be me, stay far, far away.\"\nReferences"
