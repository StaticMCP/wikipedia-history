According to Abbas Abdi, an Iranian political activists, the issue of political independence, the interference of foreigners and Mohammad Reza Shah's dependence on them was a key issue in the Iranian revolution that was also manifested in the slogans; But the combination of these things with freedom and the Islamic republic was formed gradually. According to Ebrahim Nabavi, slogans of the Iranian revolution were formed in two time periods. According to him, \"It seems that since the fall of 1978, there is some order in the slogans and they are thoughtful, but before that, for example, in the demonstrations held by student groups until October and November of 1978, most of the slogans were against the government, the king and tyranny, but the name of Ruhollah Khomeini and the emphasis on the Islamic aspect of the revolution were mentioned in the slogans since the end of 1978, that is, when the leaders of the revolution and the groups that organized the revolution were registering the revolution document in their name.\"\nFarrokh Negahdar, one of the leaders of the left-wing groups opposed to the Shah, says, \"The large participation of people from all groups in the revolutionary gatherings was a prominent feature of the days before the victory of the Iranian revolution, but there was a kind of exclusivity and the supporters of Ruhollah Khomeini did not allow other groups to demonstrate in the streets with their own slogans.\" But Abbas Abdi believes that the slogans of the leftists did not appeal to the public and were not usually spread among the people. Ahmad Salamatian believes that because the various stages of the revolution's peak coincided with religious occasions, the slogans that were given in religious ceremonies such as Ashura, although they were only political, kept the religious structure of these ceremonies. He also believes that before and after the victory of the revolution, the placards of demonstrators and their slogans have a noticeable difference: Before the victory of the revolution, in the placards of various groups and factions, the photos of Mohammad Mosaddegh, Ali Shariati or the photos of the victims of repression can be seen, but after the victory of revolution, only the photo of Ruhollah Khomeini and large religious placards and flags remained.\nList of slogans based on the topic\nSlogans against the Shah's regime\n* Poor Azhari, you dog of four stars, say again that it is a tape, a tape that has no legs\n* You are not honorable, not an Imam, but a complete donkey\n* We say we don't want a king, the prime minister will be changed!
