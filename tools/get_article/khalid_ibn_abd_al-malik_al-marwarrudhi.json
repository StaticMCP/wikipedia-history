The party travelled to the Nineveh Plains in the valley of the Tigris, at 35 degrees north latitude. The measurement they obtained enabled the astronomers to  obtain a value of  for the circumference of the Earth, (or, according to other sources, ). The two researchers measured in Arabian , and determined the geographical latitudes of the end points they used from the star altitudes in a celestial horizontal coordinate system. As it is thought that one Arabian  represented , they found the length of 1° of meridian to be , which differs from the true value by .\nMarwarrūdhī  was chosen by the geometer Al-Abbās ibn Said al-Jawharī to organize a new observatory on Mount Qasioun. Despite encountering technical difficulties caused by the distortion of the astronomical instruments, in  he spent a year obtaining of solar and lunar observations of the Sun and the Moon. He played a role in the project  determine the length of the spring season by means of astronomical observations.\nMarwarrūdhī was the first of three generations of astronomers.\nReferences\nSources\n*  ([http://islamsci.mcgill.ca/RASI/BEA/Marwarrudhi_BEA.pdf PDF version])\n*\nFurther reading\n*"
