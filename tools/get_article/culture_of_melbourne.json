Since its founding as a British settlement in 1835, Melbourne has been culturally influenced by European culture, particularly that of the British Isles. During the 1850s Victorian gold rush and in the decades that immediately followed, immigrants from many other parts of the world, notably China and the Americas, helped shape Melbourne's culture. Over time, Melbourne has become the birthplace of a number of unique cultural traits and institutions, and today it is one of the world's most multicultural cities.\nTraditionally acclaimed as Australia's \"cultural capital\", Melbourne topped the Economist Intelligence Unit's annual ranking of the world's most liveable cities throughout much of the 2010s, based in part on its cultural attributes.\nOverview\nMelbourne hosts and supports many cultural institutions, such as museums, galleries, events, festivals, public/street art, popular music, live music, film, independent music and literary talks, independent film and fashion. The city celebrates a wide variety of major annual cultural events, including local, national and international events. A number of cultural hubs also exist in the city, including the Victorian Arts Precinct, with its distinctive spire, and Federation Square, one of the city's main cultural hubs and tourist centres that celebrated its ten-year anniversary in 2012. Federation Square's distinctive architecture, large digital screen and public space attracts congregations, rallies and public audiences for sporting events.\nArts\nArchitecture\nfrom the main avenue of the Carlton Gardens]]\n]]\nMelbourne's buildings and structures feature a wide variety of architectural designs, and the city is home to the Royal Exhibition Building, the first Australian building to be listed on the World Heritage Register.\nAustralia's second oldest architectural firm, and one of the world's oldest, Bates Smart, is based in Melbourne.\nSome of Australia's most prolific architects have originated from Melbourne, including Joseph Reed, William Wardell, John James Clark, Charles D'Ebro, Charles Webb, William Pitt, Nahum Barnet, Harry Norris, Sir Roy Grounds and Robin Boyd. In recent years, Melbourne has produced internationally recognised architectural firms, including Denton Corker Marshall, Fender Katsalidis, Daryl Jackson and Peddle Thorp, as well as local award-winning trendsetters, Edmund & Corrigan, Ashton Raggatt McDougall and Wood Marsh.\nLiterature\n]]\nMelbourne's literary history is  rich and diverse. The State Library of Victoria was the first major cultural institution to be established in Melbourne since its founding in 1854, and is one of Australia's oldest cultural institutions. The library holds more than two million books and 16,000 serials, and is a part of an extensive network of public and university libraries across the city. A wide range of independent bookstores also exist in the city, as well as a variety of larger bookstore chains, and in 1960, the first children's bookstore in Australia, The Little Bookroom, was opened.  The Foreign Language Bookshop is the oldest and largest language bookshop in Australasia, established in 1938 in Bourke Street as a free lending library.  The primary aim of the business was to reduce migrant isolation, particularly for European migrants disembarking from ships into Australia.\nin Gordon Reserve]]\nIn the decades following the gold rush, Melbourne was Australia's undisputed literary capital, famously referred to by Henry Kendall as \"that wild bleak Bohemia south of the Murray\". During this time, Melbourne-based writers and poets Adam Lindsay Gordon, Marcus Clarke, and Rolf Boldrewood produced classic visions of colonial life and created a nascent national literature.\nMelbourne's literary publishing sector is the largest in Australia, including the largest number of independent publishers, and presents two of Australia's most significant literary awards: the Victorian Premier's Literary Awards and the Melbourne Prize for Literature. Melbourne is the setting of many significant novels including Fergus Hume's The Mystery of a Hansom Cab (1886), George Johnston's My Brother Jack (1964), Helen Garner's Monkey Grip (1977) and Christos Tsiolkas’ The Slap (2008). The Mystery of a Hanson Cab was the best-selling detective novel of the 19th century. Garner's seminal 1977 novel Monkey Grip achieved notability for capturing Melbourne's burgeoning counter-culture and Bohemia scene, as well as the lives of communal single-mothers, junkies and artists living in sharehouses in the inner city neighbourhoods of Fitzroy and Carlton. It is now considered one of Australia's earliest and most important contemporary novels, with the BBC selecting it as one of \"100 stories that shaped the world\" – the only Australian novel on the list. Other contemporary writers from Melbourne include Kerry Greenwood, Germaine Greer, Stephanie Alexander, Tony Birch and Barry Dickins.\nThe Melbourne Writers Festival was founded in 1986 and is an annual, two-week literary festival that hosts keynotes, panels and workshops by a wide range of local and international guests. Since beginning as a one-day zine fair in 2004, the Emerging Writers' Festival has expanded to ten days of events, workshops, and panel discussions that are focused on the development of writers. Annually across Melbourne there are many local writers’ festivals including the Bayside Literary Festival, Williamstown Literary Festival and Glen Eira Storytelling Festival. In addition to book readings by local authors, many of these events provide opportunities for local writers to develop their skills via workshops and short-story competitions.\nIn August 2008, Melbourne was the second city in the world to be recognised as a City of Literature by UNESCO—the Wheeler Centre for Books, Writing and Ideas is a literary and publishing centre founded as part of Melbourne's successful bid. As well as programming literary events, debates and awards, the Wheeler Centre hosts literary organisations such as the Melbourne Writers’ Festival, Emerging Writers’ Festival, SPUNC, Australian Poetry, Express Media, Writers Victoria and the Melbourne City of Literature Office.\nOpera and theatre\nin St Kilda.]]\nThe Australian Ballet Company is based in Melbourne and the National Theatre in St Kilda is the oldest ballet school in Australia. Ballet is a regular feature at the Victorian Arts Centre and National Theatre venues. Melbourne is the second home of Opera Australia after it merged with Victoria State Opera in 1996. The Victorian Opera held its inaugural season in 2006 and operates in various Melbourne venues.\nThe Royal Melbourne Philharmonic was formed in 1853, making it Australia's oldest musical organisation and the only orchestra in Australia to be bestowed \"royal\" status. The Victoria Orchestra, based in Melbourne, was Australia's first professional orchestra and performed during the period from 1888 to 1891. The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, first assembled in 1906, is now the city's premier orchestra and tours internationally.\nThere are more theatres and performance venues in Melbourne than any other city in Australia. In Southbank, Victoria, the Arts Centre Melbourne is a hub of performing arts venues and is the cornerstone of the Melbourne Arts Precinct which also includes the Melbourne Recital Centre and Southbank Theatre, home of the Melbourne Theatre Company. In the city's East End Theatre District, notable theatres include the Princess Theatre, Regent Theatre, Forum Theatre, Comedy Theatre; the Athenaeum, and Her Majesty's Theatre. The Palais Theatre is a significant music venue in nearby St Kilda.\nSeveral professional theatre companies operate in Melbourne, of which the Melbourne Theatre Company, the oldest professional theatre company in Australia, has the most institutional support of any in Australia. There is also a range of smaller professional theatre companies in Melbourne, including the Malthouse, La Mama in Carlton, Cariad Productions, the Red Stitch Actors Theatre, Theatreworks in StKilda and PONYCAM. An array of amateur companies also exist, such as OXAGEN Productions, the Malvern Theatre Company, CLOC, Catchment Players of Darebin, MLOC Productions, Theatrical Incorporated, Altona City Theatre, Windmill Theatre Company and Dandenong Theatre Company.\nFile:Her Majesty's Theatre, Melbourne.jpg|Her Majesty's Theatre\nFile:Princess Theatre, Melbourne, Australia.jpg|Princess Theatre\nFile:Regent Theatre in Collin Street, Melbourne.jpg|Regent Theatre\nFile:Capitol Theatre Melbourne white lighting.jpg|The Capitol\nComedy\n, one of the Melbourne International Comedy Festival's main venues]]\nMelbourne is known throughout both Australia and the world as a centre of comedy, with the Melbourne International Comedy Festival listed as one of the three largest stand-up comedy festivals in the world. The city has also produced many of Australia's top-rating comedy television and radio shows, and many of the country's leading comedians either come from the city or have relocated to Melbourne.\n]]\nMelbourne-born satirist Barry Humphries created his main character, Dame Edna Everage, as a comic version of a suburban homemaker. Through Everage, Humphries has written and performed cutting odes to Melbourne mores and the middle class suburbs of Moonee Ponds and Highett, among others. The character was retired in mid-2012 during the Eat Pray Laugh farewell tour.\nDance events\nMelbourne also hosted the 2008 World Latin American Dance Championships. The competition was held in the Vodafone Arena and immediately following the Australian Dancesport Championships. The Australian Dancesport championships will commence on 10 December 2008 and the World Latin Championships will be held on 14 December 2008.\nVisual arts\n(1889), painted by Heidelberg School artist Arthur Streeton in the then-rural Melbourne suburb of Heidelberg]]\nThe Melbourne arts scene is vibrant and the city hosts the annual Melbourne International Arts Festival as a celebration of its artistic tradition.\nIn the 1880s, a group of Melbourne artists formed the first distinctive Australian school of painting. Named the Heidelberg School, and latterly described as Australian Impressionism, the movement's four principle artists were Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton, Charles Conder and Frederick McCubbin. Together they painted en plein air at artists' camps set up around Melbourne's rural suburbs, including Box Hill and Heidelberg, allowing them to capture the unique light, colour and atmosphere of the Australian bush. Many of the group's most famous works from this period are large-scale sunlit landscapes and pastoral figure subjects, however they also explored Melbourne's urban scenery, local history (including pioneer and bushranger themes), beaches (often along Port Phillip Bay at Mentone, Sandringham and Beaumaris), and did portraits of wealthy Melburnians from their inner-city studios. In 1889 they staged the 9 by 5 Impression Exhibition opposite the Melbourne Town Hall. It is regarded as a landmark event in Australian art history.\nModernist John Brack captured the idiosyncrasies of daily life in Melbourne. His most iconic painting, Collins Street., 5 pm (1955), shows grim-faced pedestrians moving in unison down Collins Street. It was voted by patrons in 2011 as the National Gallery of Victoria's most popular work.\n's stained glass ceiling in the Great Hall of the National Gallery of Victoria]]\nThere are more than 100 galleries in Melbourne. In the city, [http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/ NGV International], the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060714012130/http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/ngvaustralia/ Ian Potter Centre] and Ian Potter Museum of Art, the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art, Flinders Lane Gallery, Anna Schwartz Gallery, McCulloch Gallery, and the Australian Centre for the Moving Image — an organisation dedicated to the moving image in all its forms, from film and animation, to video games and television — have been established. The Gertrude Contemporary Art Spaces and the Centre for Contemporary Photography, both based in Fitzroy, are examples of galleries in the inner-city. Suburban venues also exist, such as Heidelberg's Heide Museum of Modern Art, located in the north-eastern region of the city. The Art Almanac website, promoting itself as \"Australia's Monthly Briefing on Art\", publishes a monthly list of activities for Melbourne's galleries and art services, in addition to the other Australian states, covering more than 550 art galleries throughout the entire nation; the organisation also publishes a hard copy almanac each month.\n]]\nMelbourne is home to a large array of public artworks, statues and sculptures. Sculptors such as Deborah Halpern have played a large part in enhancing many of the city's public spaces with their iconic and larger-than-life works. In more modern times, the city has become well known for stencil graffiti, public art that appears in the city's numerous laneways.\nThe city has major film festivals including the Melbourne International Film Festival, Melbourne Queer Film Festival, Melbourne Underground Film Festival and Melbourne International Animation Festival, featuring several of the city's major cinemas. The Central City Studios in Melbourne Docklands, constructed in 2005, has seen the production of several big budget films.\nMelbourne is also known for fashion. The city, once a leader in the textile industry, retains a small manufacturing base, but has diversified into the more creative areas of the fashion industry. The Melbourne Fashion Festival is one of the city's annual events, while the Melbourne Spring Racing Carnival, the Logies and the Brownlow Medal dinner are three of the biggest annual red carpet events in the country.\nStreet Art in Melbourne is internationally recognised. International artists, such as Banksy, have painted work in Melbourne.\nMusic\n, one of the Victorian era's most famous opera singers, took her stage name from her native Melbourne.]]\nMelbourne has one of the most highly regarded live music scenes in the world. In terms of the quality and number of venues, arguably, it is comparable with cities such as Austin. Hundreds of venues throughout Melbourne host live music, some of which host live music every night of the week.\nOperatic soprano Dame Nellie Melba, one of the late Victorian Era's most famous singers, took her stage name from her native Melbourne, her stage name also being the source of the term ‘melba toast’.\nIn 1934 Clement Williams recorded Let’s Take a Trip to Melbourne, written by Jack O'Hagan. Singer Paul Kelly has written several well-known songs about aspects of the city close to the heart of many Melburnians, notably \"Leaps And Bounds\" and \"From St Kilda to King's Cross\", while Skyhooks also wrote some more tongue-in-cheek songs about Melbourne. \"Balwyn Calling\", \"Carlton (Lygon Street Limbo)\" and \"Toorak Cowboy\" are examples.

Several distinct post-punk scenes emerged in the inner suburbs, each sharing a DIY ethic and a passion for experimentation. Led by the Primitive Calculators, the Fitzroy-based Little Band scene gave rise to groups such as Dead Can Dance and Hunters & Collectors. At The Organ Factory in Clifton Hill, conceptual composers mixed with experimental punk outfits, namely Tsk Tsk Tsk and Essendon Airport, out of which grew the funk-tinged pop group I'm Talking, fronted by a young Kate Ceberano. St Kilda's Crystal Ballroom became the stomping ground for darker, noisier punk groups, including The Moodists, Crime and the City Solution, and Nick Cave's The Birthday Party. Cave and Birthday Party bandmate Mick Harvey went on to form one of Australia's most acclaimed rock bands, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, whose evolving multinational lineup has included Melbourne musicians JG Thirlwell (known for his project Foetus), Hugo Race, and Dirty Three violinist Warren Ellis.\nMany independent artists from Melbourne have become internationally notable and regularly tour abroad, including: The Temper Trap, Cut Copy, Architecture in Helsinki, The Drones, Grinderman, Augie March, New Buffalo, The Cat Empire, Dirty Three, Muscles, The Lucksmiths, Ned Collette, The Crayon Fields, Love of Diagrams, Midnight Juggernauts, Gotye, Courtney Barnett, Alex Lahey, G Flip and The Avalanches amongst others.\nMelbourne's lively rock and pop music scene has fostered many internationally renowned artists, including Rogue Traders, Taxiride, Missy Higgins, Madison Avenue, Anthony Callea and The Living End.

Perhaps the best-known novel internationally is Nevil Shute's novel On the Beach. In 1959, it was made into a film directed by Stanley Kramer and starring Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner and Anthony Perkins.

The documentary details Melbourne's rich architectural history, particularly during its Marvellous Melbourne era when it was said to be the wealthiest city in the British Empire. In an article about the documentary for The New York Times, Natasha Frost commented:\n\"Melbourne has little such on-screen cachet. Its skyline barely sticks in the memory. Instead, those architectural aspects that linger are on a far smaller scale: the lacy ironwork that fringes cottages and terrace houses; the unusually broad streets of the central city; the independent cinemas spread across town&ndash;the Astor, the Palace, the Sun Theatre&ndash;with their gran facades and gently creaking seats.\"\n&ndash; Natasha Frost, The New York Times\nSport\nduring the 2010 AFL Grand Final.]]\n, Melbourne's most popular homegrown sport, at Docklands Stadium]]\nIn a country that is often labelled 'sports mad', Melbourne has a reputation among Australians for being the national sporting capital.
