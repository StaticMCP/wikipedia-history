The column features two-sided pedestal stands which depict the delivery of Pedro’s heart to the representatives of Porto and landing at Mindelo where Pedro IV gave the flag to Tomás de Melo Breyner. These two low-reliefs were originally made of Carrara marble, and they have been replaced with bronze duplicates for protection purposes. The coats of arms of Bragança and Porto have been depicted on the front and back sides of the column and surrounded with oak and bay leaves.\nThe statue was fused in Belgium and it describes Pedro (in a military uniform on horseback) presenting the constitutional charter (on his right hand) to Porto. The monument was inaugurated in October 1866. It has been classified as Property of Public Interest since 1982.\nGellery\nFile:Estatua D Pedro IV c (Porto).JPG|Low-relief displaying landing at Mindelo\nFile:Estatua D Pedro IV d (Porto).JPG|Low-relief displaying the delivery of Pedro’s heart\nFile:Estatua D Pedro IV b (Porto).JPG|Statue of Pedro IV presenting constitutional charter\nFile:Estátua de D.
