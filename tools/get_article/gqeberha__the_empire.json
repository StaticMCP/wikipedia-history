The decision to cancel the show comes after declining viewership ratings, marking the end of the series after two seasons.\nGqeberha: The Empire premiered in early 2023 and quickly gained attention for its unique setting in the Eastern Cape, specifically in the city of Gqeberha. The telenovela followed the story of a powerful businessman with multiple wives and the challenges they face as a family.

While the show resonated with some audiences, it did not achieve the sustained viewership necessary for continuation.\"\nDespite its initial promise, Gqeberha: The Empire faced stiff competition from other telenovelas and struggled to keep viewers engaged, leading to its eventual cancellation.\nFans of the show have expressed mixed reactions on social media, while cast members shared their gratitude for the opportunity to be part of the production. The show's cultural impact will be remembered, and M-Net and MultiChoice hinted at exploring new productions to continue investing in local content.\nCast and characters\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|Actor\n|Role\n!
