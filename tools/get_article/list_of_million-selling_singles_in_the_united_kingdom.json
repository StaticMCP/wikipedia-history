Originally only physical record sales were counted since the start of the UK Singles Chart in November 1952. Digital downloads of a track were included from 2004 onwards and from 2014 onwards BPI-certified awards (Silver, Gold and Platinum) and the weekly charts include audio streaming. In 2017, the OCC included streaming in their definition of a million-seller and published a full list of the 311 songs which had achieved this. Certified awards can also include shipments (sales to trade). The OCC and Music Week regularly announce when a record becomes a million seller.\nHistory\nPrior to the formation of the British Phonographic Industry in 1973, the only way to know if a record had sold a million copies in the United Kingdom was if the record company alerted the press. In addition, in many cases the record company would present the artist or group with Gold Records to commemorate the million sales. However, there was some controversy over whether certain singles had actually reached sales of one million copies in the United Kingdom.\nIn April 1973, the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) began classifying singles and albums by the number of units sold to dealers. The highest threshold is \"Platinum record\" and was then awarded to singles that sold more than 1 million units. For singles released after 1 January 1989, the number of sales required to qualify for Platinum, Gold and Silver records was dropped to 600,000&nbsp;units (Platinum), 400,000&nbsp;units (Gold) and 200,000&nbsp;units (Silver). In February 1987, the BPI introduced multi-Platinum awards so that if a single sold 1,200,000 units it was classified as double Platinum, 1,800,000 units as triple Platinum, etc.\nDigital downloads have been counted towards singles sales from 2004 onwards: the first single to achieve a million digital sales was \"I Gotta Feeling\" by the Black Eyed Peas. Additionally, audio streaming has been included in the official chart and BPI awards since 30 June 2014, at a rate of 100 streams representing one unit sale; however, the OCC still compiles a 'sales' (only) chart.\nIn 1963, the Beatles' song \"She Loves You\" became the best-selling single of all time in the UK. This record was broken in 1977 when Paul McCartney's subsequent band Wings surpassed it with \"Mull of Kintyre\", which also became the first song to sell 2 million copies in the UK. In 1984, Band Aid released the charity-record \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" in response to the famine in Ethiopia; it sold 1 million copies in the first week and soon became the best-selling single. This record was broken in 1997, following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, when Elton John released \"Candle in the Wind 1997\", a re-write of the Marilyn Monroe tribute released in 1973. Selling more than 650,000 copies on its first day on sale and more than 1.5 million in its first week, it quickly became the UK's best-selling single. It was classified by the BPI as 9× Platinum (5.4 million) in October 1997, but more recent reports by the OCC put its total sales at 4.93&nbsp;million.\nMillion-selling singles (paid-for sales)\nThe following list is restricted to paid-for sales since the inception of a UK chart in 1952. Unless stated otherwise, sales figures from the OCC are correct as of 19 September 2017. At this date, the OCC started recording million-sellers using combined sales (including streaming), but published the paid-for sales figures as well.\n, 180 singles have sold 1 million copies in the UK. Of these, 112 were originally released in the 20th century (70 of them selling 1 million before the year 2000) and the remainder were released between 2000 and 2014. The most recently released single to become a million-seller is \"Uptown Funk\" by Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars, which was released in December 2014 and passed a million sales ten weeks later in February 2015. Bing Crosby's \"White Christmas\" is the earliest release: originally 1942, although only sales from 1952 onwards are counted. The year in which the most million-sellers were released is 2011, with fifteen; while a record 40 releases in the 2010s have sold a million copies.\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Artist\n! scope=\"col\" | Single (two songs separated by / denotes a double A-side)\n! scope=\"col\" | Date released|group=\"nb\"}}\n! scope=\"col\" | Date certifiedPlatinum\n! scope=\"col\" | Date sold1 million\n! scope=\"col\" | Copies sold\n! scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| Order in which songs reached1 million\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |  || \"White Christmas\"\n|  ||  || 2010–12 || 1,047,349 || 117\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |  || \"(We're Gonna) Rock Around the Clock\"\n|  ||  || 1955 || 1,439,196 || 1\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |  || \"Diana\"\n|  ||  || 1957 || 1,253,486 ||\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |  || \"Mary's Boy Child\"\n|  ||  || 1957 || 1,187,752 ||\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | with The Jordanaires || \"It's Now or Never\"\n||  ||  || 1960 || 1,272,271 ||\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |  || \"Stranger on the Shore\"\n||  ||  || 1961 || 1,186,534 ||\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |  and The Shadows || \"The Young Ones\"\n||  ||  || 1962 || 1,068,368 ||\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |  || \"I Remember You\"\n||  ||  || 1962 || 1,106,190 ||\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |  || \"She Loves You\"\n||  ||  || 1963 || 1,930,000 ||\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Gerry and the Pacemakers || \"You'll Never Walk Alone\"\n||  ||  || 2016 || 1,011,244 || 165\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |  || \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\"\n||  ||  || 1963 || 1,810,829 ||\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |  || \"Can't Buy Me Love\"\n||  ||  || 1964 || 1,547,454 ||\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |  || \"I Feel Fine\"\n||  ||  || 1964 || 1,423,196 ||\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |  || \"Unchained Melody\"\n||  (re-issue) ||  || 2004–10 || 1,101,570 ||\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |  || \"Tears\"\n||  ||  || 1965 || 1,523,690 ||\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |  || \"The Carnival Is Over\"\n||  ||  || 1965 || 1,426,218 ||\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |  || \"Day Tripper\" / \"We Can Work It Out\"\n||  ||  || 1965 || 1,402,308 ||\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |  || \"Green, Green Grass of Home\"\n||  ||  || 1966 || 1,257,737 ||\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |  || \"Release Me\"\n||  ||  || 1967 || 1,384,673 ||\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |  || \"The Last Waltz\"\n||  ||  || 1967 || 1,184,163 ||\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |  || \"Hey Jude\"\n||  ||  || 2010–12 || 1,141,635 || 116\n|-\n|Frank Sinatra\n|\"My Way\"\n|March 1969\n|N/A\n|2018\n|1,000,000\n|176–177\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |  || \"Sugar, Sugar\"\n||  ||  || 1970| || 1,040,461 ||\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | || \"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing (In Perfect Harmony)\"\n||  ||  || 2004–10 || 1,016,440 ||\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |  || \"Eye Level\"\n||  ||  || 1978 || 1,008,481 ||\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |  || \"Long Haired Lover from Liverpool\"\n||  ||  || 2004–10 || 1,006,661 ||\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |  || \"Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree\"\n||  ||  || 2010–12 || 1,011,658 || 118\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | || \"I Love You Love Me Love\"\n||  ||  || 1973 || 1,146,051 ||\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Slade || \"Merry Xmas Everybody\"\n||  ||  || 1980 || 1,306,566 ||\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |  || \"Sailing\"\n||  || Customise search with the following settings – Search by: \"Keyword\", By Format: \"Single\" – then search the required entry.
