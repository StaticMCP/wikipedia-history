The creek boasts the highest falls in Bucks County.\nStatistics\nFalls Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on 1 February 1990 as identification number 1202458. Its length is approximately , the elevation at the source is  and at the mouth is . The average slope is about 282 feet per mile, or 52 meters per kilometer. However, the stretch through the falls is about  () in length with a drop of about , so the slope in that region is about 750 feet per mile or 146 meters per kilometer.\nCourse\nFalls Creek rises with Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 56 to the west and Ringing Rocks County Park to the northeast. The creek flows for a very short distance to the east then turns north where it receives a tributary from the right, then continues north until it drains into the Pennsylvania Canal (Delaware Division). Just a short distance from the canal, it passes over High Falls, the highest falls in Bucks County.\nGeology\n*Appalachian Highlands Division\n**Piedmont Province\n***Gettysburg-Newark Lowland Section\n****Brunswick Formation\n****Diabase\n*Atlantic Plain\n**Atlantic Coastal Plain Province\n***Lowland and Intermediate Upland Section\n****Trenton Gravel\nMost of the path of Falls Creek lies in a bed of igneous rock of diabase formed as an intrusion into the surrounding Brunswick Formation. The diabase consists of dark gray to black rock, mineralogy consists of labradorite and augite. As it flows down the High Falls, it transitions into the Brunswick, laid down during the Jurassic and Triassic and consists of mudstone, siltstone, and shale. Mineralogy includes argillite and hornfels. Lastly, it enters the river lowland known as Trenton Gravel, a bed laid down during the Quaternary, consisting of sand and clay.\nCrossings and Bridges\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Crossing !!
