They asked to send the brother of their King who had been installed by Hassan Pasha but then expelled by Count Alcaudete, this was because the King who reigned was an oppressor to the Muslims as he overcharged them for taxes to pay his tribute to the King of Spain. The Pasha of Algiers attempted to dissuade the Sharif by inviting him to march against the Spaniards in Oran. For this purpose Hasan Corso was given the command of 5,000 musketeers, 1,000 spahis and 8,000 Kabyles brought by Abdelaziz. An alliance was concluded with the Saadians against Oran. Mohammed al-Shaykh sent his sons Mohammed El Harrane and Abdelkader at the head of 21,000 horsemen and 10,000 infantry. The agreement was that the Algerians and Saadians would meet up at Ain Temouchent and the two allied armies were to seize Oran. The Saadians violated this agreement and entered Tlemcen and made themselves masters of the city, Moulay Abdallah occupied Tlemcen with a strong garrison while his brother ravaged the territory of the Beni Amer.\nA group of the Beni Amer who were pursued by the Saadians arrived at a camp situated in the Regency of Algiers and appealed for help. Hasan Corso advanced into the Chelif valley where the Sharifian general was operating, Hasan Corso chased, defeated and killed the Saadian general.\nThe commandment in Tlemcen then requested help and Mohammed al-Shaykh sent his three sons, this would result in a battle near the Abou Azoun river resulting in an Algerian victory.\nReferences"
