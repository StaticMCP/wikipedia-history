It is located at a distance of 470&nbsp;km from the National Capital New Delhi and 332&nbsp;km from the State Capital Dehradun. Bageshwar is known for its scenic environment, glaciers, rivers and temples. It is also the administrative headquarters of Bageshwar district.\nSituated on the confluence of Saryu and Gomati rivers, Bageshwar is surrounded by the mountains of Bhileshwar and Nileshwar to its east and west, the Suraj Kund in the north, and Agni Kund in the south. Bageshwar was a major trade mart between Tibet and Kumaun, and was frequented by the Bhotia traders, who bartered Tibetan wares, wool, salt and Borax in exchange for carpets and other local produces in Bageshwar. The trade routes were, however, closed after the Indo-China War of 1962.\nThe city is of great religious, historic and political significance. Bageshwar is mentioned in various Puranas, where it has been associated with  Shiva. The Uttrayani fair held annually in Bageshwar used to be visited by approx 15,000 people in the early twentieth century, and was the largest fair of Kumaon division. The fair became the epicenter of the Coolie Begar Movement in January 1921. The city of Bageshwar gets its name from the Bagnath Temple. Hindi and Sanskrit are the official Languages however Kumaoni is spoken by a large number of people.\nHistory\nMythological origins and early history\nwas erected in 1640 by King Laxmi Chand]]\nBageshwar's name is closely linked to its religious and mythological significance. The Bagnath Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, has been a revered site for centuries. According to the Manaskhand of the Shiva Purana, the temple and the surrounding town were established by Chandeesh, a servant of Lord Shiva.\nAnother popular legend involves Sage Markandeya, who is said to have worshipped Lord Shiva at this very spot. In one version of the legend, Lord Shiva blessed Sage Markandeya by appearing to him in the form of a tiger, which contributed to the region's strong religious and cultural identity.\nEarly medieval period\nBageshwar's history in the medieval period is tied to the powerful dynasties that ruled the Kumaon region. During the 7th century, Bageshwar was part of the Katyuri Kingdom and was situated near Kartikeypura, the capital of the Katyuri Dynasty. The Katyuris ruled the region until the death of Birdeo, the last ruler of the united Katyuris, in the 13th century. His death led to the fragmentation of the Katyuri kingdom into eight smaller princely states, with Bageshwar falling under the control of the Baijnath Katyurs, descendants of the original Katyuri kings.\nThe 10th century saw the rise of the Chand dynasty, founded by Som Chand, who displaced the Katyuris and established the new kingdom of Kurmanchal, later known as Kumaon. Som Chand's successors later moved the capital of Kumaon from Champawat to Almora in the 16th century, marking the establishment of the Chand dynasty's influence over the region.\nGorkha invasion and British annexation\nA major event in the history of Bageshwar occurred in 1791 when the Gorkhas, expanding their kingdom westward across the Kali River, invaded Kumaon, including Bageshwar. The Gorkhas swiftly took control of the region and its administrative centers, including Almora, which was then the seat of the Kumaon Kingdom. However, Gorkha rule was short-lived. After the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–1816), the British East India Company defeated the Gorkhas and forced them to cede Kumaon to the British under the Treaty of Sugauli in 1816.\nUnder British rule, the Kumaon region, including Bageshwar, was integrated into the Kumaon Province governed by a chief-commissioner on non-regulation system. In 1891, this region was administratively divided into three districts—Kumaon, Garhwal, and the Tarai. These were later reorganized again, with Almora and Nainital becoming the headquarters for eponymous districts. By 1886, Bageshwar had a population of about 500 people, as recorded in 'The Himalayan Gazetteer' by Atkinson.\nModern development\nIn the early 20th century, Bageshwar began to see some important infrastructural and administrative developments. In 1906, a dispensary was established in the town to provide basic healthcare services to the local population. Three years later, in 1909, a post office was set up, further enhancing the town's communication and administrative facilities.\nEducation also began to take root in the region. In 1926, a public school was established in Bageshwar, and it was later upgraded to a junior high school in 1933. These early efforts in education were pivotal in laying the groundwork for the town's later developments.\nDuring this period, the British also conducted a survey for a potential rail link connecting Bageshwar with Tanakpur in 1902. However, the project was delayed due to the outbreak of World War I, and it was not pursued further during the British colonial period. In the 1980s, following a visit from Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, the British-era survey for a rail link between Bageshwar and Tanakpur was revisited, though the project did not proceed in the same manner as initially planned.\nPost-independence developments\nAfter India gained independence in 1947, Bageshwar was incorporated into the Almora district of Uttar Pradesh. In 1951, the town had a population of just 1,740 people and was part of the Kanda development block. This was a period of gradual development, with the consolidation of nine smaller villages into the Bageshwar State village in 1948. These villages would later form the nucleus of the town's urban growth.\nIn 1955, Bageshwar was officially declared a town under the UP Town Area Act of 1914, and the first Town Area Committee was constituted in 1957. Over the years, the town's infrastructure continued to improve, and in 1968, it achieved the status of a Municipal Council. One of the significant developments was the introduction of a water supply scheme in 1975, which was designed to cater to a population of 6,000 people by 1997.\nEducation saw further progress post-independence. In 1949, a private high school was opened in memory of Victor Mohan Joshi, and it was upgraded to an Inter College in 1967. In addition, the first women's primary school was established in the 1950s, and a women's public high school opened in 1975. The opening of the Government Degree College in 1974 by Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna marked another important milestone in the educational development of Bageshwar.\nFormation of Bageshwar district\non 15 September 1997, Bageshwar became an independent district, carved out from Almora, with its own administrative headquarters. The district's formation was spearheaded by the then Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, Mayawati. In 2000, following the creation of Uttarakhand as a separate state, Bageshwar became part of the newly formed Uttarakhand state. On November 9, 2000, following the creation of Uttarakhand as a separate state, Bageshwar became a part of the new state.\nGeography and Climate\nBageshwar is located at  in Bageshwar District in Uttarakhand.
