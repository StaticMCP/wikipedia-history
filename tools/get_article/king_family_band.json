The band consists of all 9 family members, with the children ranging in age from 10–25.\nWith eleven years of experience, the Kings put on a high energy show that everyone is sure to enjoy. They excite audiences with banjo and fiddle favorites—such as the \"Orange Blossom Special\", Dueling Banjos and Rocky Top—as well as standard bluegrass, gospel, country and original music.\nThe King family first garnered recognition when they won the open stage competition at the Springfield, Illinois Bluegrass Festival, and were invited to  Silver Dollar City's Youth in Bluegrass Festival.\n__TOC__\nHistory and achievements\nThe beginnings of the band started with the purchase of a violin at a local music shop's sidewalk sale. Tim and Kim King had four children at the time, with the oldest one being their five-year-old son Caleb.\nThe group boasts two state of Illinois banjo champions, two No. 1 RAA radio hits and two proud (most of the time) parents of seven children.\nThe Kings' fifth CD, released in October 2012, was produced by Pat Holt, who produced legends such as Johnny Cash, James Taylor, Alabama and Charlie Daniels.\nThe Kings keep a busy tour schedule playing at fairs, churches, art centers, festivals and private events across the country, including concerts in Nashville and Branson. Individually, four of the band's members are state award-winning instrumentalists, and as a group they took 2nd at the 2012 CAM Gospel Sing-Off in Branson. The King Family Band is known for their heart-felt and powerful original music, with Caleb recently labeled a Songwriter to Watch by the Nashville Songwriters Association International.\nIn 2011 they performed at the world-famous Krannert Center for the Performing Arts in Urbana, IL.\nDiscography\n*Prairie Praise\n*En Route\n*Redbud Tree (2010)\n*Glory Land (2011)\n*My Kinda Dream (2012)\nMembers\n*Tim King – bass, vocals\n*Kim King –  fiddle, vocals\n*Caleb King – banjo, guitar, fiddle, vocals\n*Carson King – banjo, fiddle, vocals\n*Rachel King –  guitar, fiddle, bass, vocals\n*Kendall King – mandolin, fiddle vocals\n*Rebecca King – dobro, fiddle, banjo vocals\n*Renee King – guitar, fiddle, vocals\n*Robin King – fiddle, vocals\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.thekingfam.net Official site]"
