It is the first album with bassist Alicia Vigil following the departure of Frédéric Leclercq in 2019 and more than four years after the previous album Extreme Power Metal was released in September 2019, marking their longest gap between studio albums to date. It is also the band's shortest studio album, at 49 minutes and 7 seconds.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nBand members\n* Marc Hudson – lead and backing vocals\n* Herman Li – guitars, backing vocals, production\n* Sam Totman – guitars, backing vocals, production\n* Alicia Vigil – bass, backing vocals\n* Gee Anzalone – drums, backing vocals\nAdditional musicians\n* Coen Janssen – keyboards\nTechnical\n* Damien Rainaud – production, mastering, mixing, engineering\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Chart performance for Warp Speed Warriors\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2024)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Japanese Digital Albums (Oricon)\n| 46\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Japanese Hot Albums (Billboard Japan)\n| 19\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
