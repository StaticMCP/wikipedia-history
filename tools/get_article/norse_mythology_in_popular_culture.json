With the widespread publication of Norse myths and legends at this time, references to the Norse gods and heroes spread into European literary culture, especially in Scandinavia, Germany, and Britain. In the later 20th century, references to Norse mythology became common in science fiction and fantasy literature, role-playing games, and eventually other cultural products such as Japanese animation. Storytelling was an important aspect of Norse mythology and centuries later, with the rediscovery of the myth, Norse mythology once again relies on the impacts of storytelling to spread its agenda.\nReintroduction to popular culture\nAntiquaries of the 19th century such as George Webbe Dasent brought the mythology of Scandinavia back to the popular notice of many people in Germany and England; in both cases, Norse mythology was recognized as the latest surviving form of Germanic paganism. Germany and England were Christianized far earlier than the Scandinavian countries and much of their own traditions were lost.\nIn Britain, William Morris composed poetry such as Sigurd the Volsung on Norse legendary subjects as well as translating Icelandic sagas into English. In Germany, Richard Wagner borrowed characters and themes from Norse mythology to compose the four operas that make up Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung), though he also utilized medieval German sources and Germanized the names of the Norse gods. In Germany, the rediscovery of Norse mythology became popularized by transforming its art-religion context to an alternative spiritual practice. The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien was said to have been heavily influenced by Norse mythology, which brought on many debates about structural and theoretical approaches to mythology.\nDepictions in modern popular culture\nComics\nAmerican comics\n* The Norse Pantheon and related elements have a prominent role in the Marvel Universe, especially Thor, who has been one of the longest-running superheroes for the company and has had a starring role in both The Avengers comics and the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
