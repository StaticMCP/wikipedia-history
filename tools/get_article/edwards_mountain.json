Edwards Mountain rises just to the west of Sperry Glacier. Based on the Köppen climate classification, Edwards Mountain has an alpine climate characterized by long, usually very cold winters, and short, cool to mild summers. Temperatures can drop below −10&nbsp;°F with wind chill factors below −30&nbsp;°F.\nGeology\nLike other mountains in Glacier National Park, Edwards Mountain is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was initially uplifted beginning 170&nbsp;million years ago when the Lewis Overthrust fault pushed an enormous slab of precambrian rocks  thick,  wide and  long over younger rock of the cretaceous period.\nGallery\nGunsight Mountain (left), Edwards Mountain, and Little Matterhorn (lower right) seen from Bearhat Mountain\nSee also\n* Mountains and mountain ranges of Glacier National Park (U.S.)\n* Geology of the Rocky Mountains\nReferences"
