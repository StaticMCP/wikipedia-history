It was made at Islington Studios by British Gaumont, an affiliate of Gainsborough Pictures. The film's sets were designed by Alex Vetchinsky. The film was distributed by Gaumont British Distributors.\nCourtneidge plays a dual role as the sisters Bertha and Cicely Fytte. Bertha is a dour schoolteacher, while the bubbly Cicely runs a nearby circus. When Bertha elopes, Cicely takes her place at the school to prevent her from getting the sack. It was the film debut for Vivien Leigh.\nThings Are Looking Up was released to cinemas in the United Kingdom in 1935.\nPlot\nCicely Fytte is a circus equestrienne and the twin sister of Bertha Fytte who disapproves of her. Bertha is a strict schoolteacher at a girls' boarding school and not well liked by the girls. One day Bertha elopes with a wrestler so Cicely temporarily takes her place as teacher for one day - to prevent her from losing her job. Cicely is livelier and not as disapproving as Bertha so the girls are initially surprised by Cicely's bubbly personality - unaware that she isn't Bertha. A series of comical events follow: up-beating singing in a music class (leading to the composition of the song \"Things Are Looking Up\"), winning a tennis match at Wimbledon (despite not having as much experience as Bertha and breaking a racket) and trying to teach geometry (despite not knowing the subject). In spite of her unorthodox methods, she becomes successful and by the time Bertha (having been shortlisted to succeed the retiring headmistress) returns, she becomes headmistress. As soon as Bertha comes back to the school, Cicely leaves with the music teacher, Van Gaard in his car and they sing their song from the music lesson Cicely covered - Things Are Looking Up.\nCast\n* Cicely Courtneidge as Cicely Fytte / Bertha Fytte\n* Max Miller as Joey\n* William Gargan as Van Gaard\n* Mary Lawson as Mary Fytte\n* Mark Lester as Chairman\n* Henrietta Watson as Miss McTavish\n* Cicely Oates as Miss Crabbe\n* Judy Kelly as Opal\n* Dick Henderson as Mr. Money\n* Dickie Henderson as Mr. Money's Son  (billed as Dick Henderson Jr.)\n* Charles Mortimer as Harry\n* Hay Plumb as Tennis Umpire\n* Danny Green as Big Black Fox\n* Suzanne Lenglen as Madame Bombardier\n* Vivien Leigh as Schoolgirl (uncredited)\n* Alma Taylor as Schoolmistress (uncredited)\n* Wyn Weaver as Governor (uncredited)\n* Ian Wilson as Drummer in Band (uncredited)\nCritical reception\nTV Guide called the film a \"quite good comedy,\" and rated it two out of four stars.
