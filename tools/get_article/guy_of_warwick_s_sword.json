The sword measures over  in length and is designed to be used with two hands.\nIn the time of Queen Elizabeth I of England there was an official Keeper of Guy of Warwicks Sword. Today the sword is held at Warwick Castle.\nReferences\n* \"Treasures of Britain\", p.477. Published by Drive Publications Ltd."
