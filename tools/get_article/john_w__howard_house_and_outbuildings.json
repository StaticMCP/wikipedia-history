Howard House is a historic residence near Greenville, Alabama, United States.  It was built around 1860 by planter John W. Howard.  While much of the land was sold off and used for timber, Howard's family continued to occupy the house at least through 1992.  The house is a one-story, Greek Revival structure with an inset front porch.  The façade is five bays wide, and the central entrance has double doors with multi-light sidelights and transom.  The interior is a triple-pile center-hall plan.  Outbuildings include a frame barn, a two-room detached kitchen, and the family cemetery.\nThe house was listed on the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage in 1982 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.\nReferences"
