The filmmakers obscured the actors' features to differentiate the two television series, but the images' compositions are the same.\nThe series' costume design is one of its main focal points. During its premiere, the production team hosted runway events for cast members to showcase their costumes. The Yang generals and Yelü Xie's costumes were designed based on battle armour from the Tang, Song and Liao dynasties. However, the Yangs' armours attracted the most attention, as audiences felt that they resembled samurai armour more than Chinese armour, because of their bright red and black colouring, and long narrow plates. The Song military uniform designs were featured again in The Legend of the Condor Heroes (2008) and A Weaver on the Horizon (2010).\nSoundtrack\nTrack listing\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  [http://www.ctv.com.tw/event/2006/young/ The Young Warriors page on CTV website]\n*  [http://data.ent.sina.com.cn/tv/3791.html The Young Warriors] on Sina.com\n*  [http://www.tangrendianying.com/works-tv-detail.php?id=9 The Young Warriors official Chinese Entertainment Shanghai website]"
