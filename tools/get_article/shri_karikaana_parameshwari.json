Garbhagudi is carved out of a single rock. In 1970s when Indira Gandhi visited the temple, roads were fully built up to uphill. It is located in the very dense forest, so it is a favorite spot for nature lovers. There are views of the Arabian Sea from the top of the mountain. It is dedicated to the deity Kali (Devanāgarī: काली).\nOndadke or Vandadake Shambhulingehwara temple is also nearby to this place.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20031224093444/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/2003/06/29/stories/2003062900930300.htm 694 temples come under new Endowment Act]\n*[http://www.kamat.org/picsearch.asp?search=Karikanamma Photo of the temple]"
