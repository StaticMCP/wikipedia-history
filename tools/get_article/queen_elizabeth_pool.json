The original pool, which opened on August 22, 1922, was the oldest municipal pool in Western Canada.[http://www.albertacentennial.ca/history/viewpost.aspx~id=423.html Queen Elizabeth Pool – the oldest municipal pool in Western Canada – Alberta Centennial]   The Edmonton Bulletin described the pool as “delightfully situated in what is generally recognized as the city’s most beautiful park.\"\nThe pool was originally named the South Side Pool; it was renamed the Queen Elizabeth Pool in 1939 during a Royal Visit. The pool cost $18,600 to build and was made of reinforced concrete, designed to minimize heaving due to frost.\nIn 1923, a municipal order was issued banning people of colour from using public pools in Edmonton, including the Queen Elizabeth Pool, but the order was revoked the following year in response to community advocacy.\nFollowing the discovery of a crack in the pool's basin, the facility was closed in 2004. The original pool was demolished in the summer of 2011 and reopened later that same year 600m to the west adjacent to the Kinsmen Sports Centre.\nThe new pool features a 6-lane, 25-metre pool with a zero depth entry, children's spray park, sun deck, universal access change room and showers and lockers on the pool deck.\nSee also\n* Royal eponyms in Canada\nNotes"
