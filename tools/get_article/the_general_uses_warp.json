      "text": "# The General Uses Warp\n\n\"The General Uses Warp\" () is a North Korean song praising Kim Jong Il. The song was first released in 1996 by Wangjaesan Light Music Band, with lyrics written by Jong Ryol () and music composed by Kim Un Ryong ().\nBackground\nThe song, released in the middle of the 1990s North Korean famine, claims that Kim Jong Il and his father Kim Il Sung could use chukjibeop, a magic ability attributed to xians, Taoist immortals, also known as suōdì in Chinese and shukuchi in Japanese. It literally means \"earth-shrinking\" and describes mythical techniques of rapid movement and teleportation. The story dates back to pre-war times, when a legend arose that Korean guerilla fighters, including Kim Il Sung, used this ability to escape Japanese forces during the war for independence.\nThis was one of many methods used to deify and exalt the leaders since the Kim Jong Il era, along with claims that Kim Jong Un can bring good weather when he travels. In 2019, however, Kim Jong Un instructed the propaganda workers to stay away from mystification of the leaders. While his father distanced himself from the public with such supernatural praise, the current supreme leader chooses to imitate his grandfather Kim Il Sung, who worked to create a friendly and relatable image.\nLyrics\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Korean\n!Korean (with Hanja)\n!Revised Romanization\n!McCune–Reischauer\n!Translation\n|-\n|동에 번쩍 서에 번쩍\n천하를 쥐락펴락\n방선천리 주름잡아\n장군님 가신다\n수령님 쓰시던 축지법\n오늘은 장군님 쓰신다\n백두의 전법 신묘한 전법\n장군님 쓰신다\n동에번쩍 서에번쩍\n천하를 쥐락펴락\n구름타고 오르신다\n최전연고지우에\n험산준령 비켜선다\n번개도 뒤따른다\n장군님의 지략으로\n승전고 울린다\n|東에 번쩍 西에 번쩍\n天下를 쥐락펴락\n防線千里 주름잡아\n將軍님 가신다\n首領님 쓰시던 縮地法\n오늘은 將軍님 쓰신다\n白頭의 戦法 神妙한 戦法\n將軍님 쓰신다\n東에 번쩍 西에 번쩍\n天下를 쥐락펴락\n구름타고 오르신다\n最前緣高地우에\n險山峻嶺 비켜선다\n번개도 뒤따른다\n將軍님의 智略으로\n勝戰鼓 울린다\n|Dong-e beonjjeok seo-e beonjjeok\nCheonha-reul jwirak-pyeorak\nBangseon-cheolli jureumjaba\nJanggun-nim gasinda\nSuryeong-nim sseusideon chukjibeop\nOneureun janggunnim sseusinda\nBaekdu-e jeonbeop sinmyo-han jeonbeop\nJanggun-nim sseusinda\nDong-e beonjjeok seo-e beonjjeok\nCheonha-reul jwirak-pyeorak\nGureumtago oreusinda\nChoejeonyeon-goji-ue\nHeomsan-jullyeong bikyeoseonda\nBeongae-do dwittareunda\nJanggunnim-e jiryag-euro\nSeungjeongo ullinda\n|Tong-e pŏntchŏk sŏ-e pŏntchŏk\nCh'ŏnha-rŭl chwirak-p'yŏrak\nPangsŏn-ch'ŏlli churŭmjaba\nChanggun-nim kashinda\nSuryŏng-nim ssŭshidŏn ch'ukchibŏp\nOnŭrŭn changgun-nim ssŭshinda\nPaektu-e chŏnbŏp shinmyo-han chŏnbŏp\nChanggun-nim ssŭshinda\nTong-e pŏntchŏk sŏ-e pŏntchŏk\nCh'ŏnha-rŭl chwirak-p'yŏrak\nKurŭmt'ago orŭshinda\nCh'oejŏnyŏn-goji-ue\nHŏmsan-jullyŏng pik'yŏsŏnda\nPŏn'gae-do twittarŭnda\nChanggun-nim-e chiryak-ŭro\nSŭngjŏn'go ullinda\n|Flashing in the East, flashing in the West,\nGrasping and releasing the world at will.\nRuling over a thousand-ri defense line\nThe General is on the move.\nThe Chukjibeop once used by the Supreme Leader\nToday, the General employs it.\nThe tactics of Paektu, miraculous tactics\nThe General employs them!\nFlashing in the East, flashing in the West,\nGrasping and releasing the world at will.\nHe ascends riding the clouds,\nTo the apex of the front-line defenses!\nTreacherous mountains and steep passes step aside,\nEven lightning follows him\nWith the General's strategy\nThe drums of victory resound!\n|}\nReaction\nDespite being created to praise North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, the song became a meme and a source of parodies in South Korea due to its absurd themes. Praising North Korean regime is criminal under the South Korean law, but the use of this song and its parodies is tolerated as it is perceived as ironic and satirical.\nIn 2012, when the website of the left-wing Unified Progressive Party was hacked, the hackers used this song as background music on its main page.\nIn 2020, the Korean Workers' Party newspaper Rodong Sinmun published a purported anecdote from 1945 in which Kim Il Sung described methods of deception he used while fighting the Japanese forces, while denying the literal existence of chukjibeop:\n}}\nThis article was interpreted by South Korean and international media as a possible step back from the supernatural mystification of North Korea's leaders, in line with guidance that Kim Jong Un had provided a year earlier. However, the same article with minor differences was already published by the same North Korean newspaper in 2015 and again in 2018 without any media attention.\nSee also\n*Music of North Korea\n*North Korean cult of personality\n*North Korean leaders' trains\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  (Wangjaesan Light Music Band version)"
