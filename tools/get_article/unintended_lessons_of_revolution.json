It was published by Duke University Press.\nIt was inspired while researching for Rural Resistance in the Land of Zapata (2008), having noticed \"the role of rural teachers\", and by the Iguala mass kidnapping, whose 43 missing victims the book is dedicated to. It covers Mexican normal schools' development of \"a very radical tradition\" from their foundation in the 1920s under Education Minister José Vasconcelos, substantial institutional backing under President Lázaro Cárdenas and Education Sub-Secretary Moisés Sáenz, effect of 1940s urbanization, and anti-communist and Catholic backlash in the 1950s. From chapter four the book covers the tumultuous 1960s and increasing involvement with radical and guerrilla movements, especially under President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz; their position under President Luis Echeverría, and in the epilogue their legacy and influence into the 2000s.\nReception\nHistorian Kevan Antonio Aguilar praised it for representing the different gender and indigenous perspectives from interviews. According to Aguilar, men remembered the \"catharsis of protests and participation in agrarian struggles\" whilst women spoke more of the imposed labor stemming from gender norms. Such was complimented by anthropologist . Aguilar furthermore found it a \"wonderful contribution to a rich historiography\", but wished it interacted with other Latin American literature on student movements; specifically  (Brazil),  (Uruguay), Marian Schlotterbeck (Chile), and Heather Vrana (Guatemala). Historian A. S. Dillingham additionally complimented its coverage of mestizaje.\n*Other reviews:\nSources\nBibliography\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n* (Open Access)"
