It covers the colonies that joined them prior to their Independence in 1776 (for example the Plymouth Colony merged with Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1691 and the Saybrook Colony merged with Connecticut Colony in 1644). These would include the New England Colonies, Chesapeake Colonies, Middle Colonies, and the Southern Colonies, as well as in the British-controlled Ohio Country and Illinois Country.\nThere are 18 military conflicts in this list, excluded are all conflicts involving other British territories in British America that did not become part of the United States.\nWhile this list is related to the wars involving the United States, it serves as a historical prequel in that it focuses on the colonies and territories that would later make up the United States. As such the criteria will be similar and different in several respects.\nKey\n|#F88|Colonial defeat}}\n17th century wars\n{|class=\"wikitable sticky-header plainrowheaders\"\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; color:yellow;\"\n!scope=col  style=\"background:#b0313f; width:350px;\"|Conflict\n!scope=col  style=\"background:gray; width:190px;\"|Allies\n!scope=col  style=\"background:gray; width:180px;\"|Opponent(s)\n!scope=col  style=\"background:green; width:270px;\"|Result\n!scope=col  style=\"background:#115cbc; width:260px;\"|English monarchs\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n!scope=row style=\"background:#efefef\" | First Anglo-Powhatan War(1609–1614)Part of the Anglo-Powhatan Wars and American Indian WarsLocation: Colony of VirginiaCurrent location in the United States: Virginia saving the life of Capt.

Criteria for inclusion on these lists\n|-\n| 1. Being that rebellions were much more common in this area, produced a great loss of life per capita in the region where they were fought, and were more geopolitically significant, rebellions are allowed to be included in this list, with the exception of slave rebellions. However, bloodless rebellions will not be included unless there is a change in territory, but all other rebellions can be linked in the see also section. Riots such as the Boston Massacre or the Knowles Riot and/or vigilantism such the burning of the Peggy Stewart or the Boston Tea Party should likewise not be included. If it can be established that a North American based anti piracy campaign can be established this may be included.\n|-\n| 2. Extended wars focusing on European or other non British North American colonies should only be included if a successor colony or territory is included in some way or affected a colony. For example, the Nine Years' War should not be included, but King William's War should be included as it is the portion of the war that focuses on the North America theater.\n|-\n| 3. Colonial Wars not including the 13 British Colonies and/or territories that became the United States should generally not be included especially if there was no British involvement. For example conflicts such as the Dutch Conquest of New Sweden should not be included, though they may be referenced in the see also section.\n|}\nReferences"
