They were last awarded in 2021.\nLucky Grills, actor and comedian came up with the idea to create an awards show to celebrate Australian Variety, during a meeting in 1975.\nThe Mo Awards, initially the Star Awards, were a state honour in New South Wales only, established by local entertainers to promote the live entertainment industry.\nJohnny O'Keefe became chairman in 1976, and decided the awards should become an Australia-wide national awards program. Entertainer Don Lane then proposed the awards be renamed the Mo Awards in honour of Australian comedian and vaudevillian Roy Rene, who was famous for the character \"Mo McCackie.\"\nCategories\nThe award categories were reviewed annually and adapted to new trends in the Australian entertainment sector; categories included awards in: musical theatre, opera, classical music, dance, comedy, rock music, jazz, country music, plays and variety shows.\nAward winners\nThe Award winners are listed below.\n1975: NSW Star Awards\nThe NSW Star Awards took place on 10 November 1975 at South Sydney Seniors Leagues Club – Redfern.
