      "text": "# Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems\n\nInitiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems is a competitive research grants program authorized in the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-185) and reauthorized in the 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171, Sec. 7205).  The law allows mandatory funds available from savings in food stamp program administration to be  used to support the program.  Grants were awarded in FY2000 and FY2001; in all other years congressional appropriators have prohibited USDA from spending funds on personnel to operate the program except for oversight of existing grants.\nReferences\n*"
