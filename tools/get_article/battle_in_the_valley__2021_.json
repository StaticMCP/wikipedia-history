On August 14, 2021 at Resurgence, NJPW announced Battle in the Valley for November 13 at San Jose Civic in San Jose, California. The event saw the NJPW debuts of Buddy Matthews and Jonah, and Kazuchika Okada making his first US appearance since 2019.\nStorylines\nBattle in the Valley featured professional wrestling matches that involve different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\nResults\nNEW JAPAN PRO-WRESTLING|url=https://www.njpw1972.com/tornament/102275?showResult=1|access-date=2021-11-13|website=NJPW|language=en}}\n|times   =\n|match1  = Bullet Club (Chris Bey and Hikuleo) defeated The DKC and Kevin Knight\n|stip1   = Tag team match\n|time1   = 8:35\n|note1   = dark\n|match2  = Josh Alexander defeated Yuya Uemura\n|stip2   = Singles match\n|time2   = 11:44\n|match3  = Stray Dog Army (Bateman and Misterioso) defeated Violence Unlimited (Brody King and Chris Dickinson)\n|stip3   = Tag team match\n|time3   = 10:08\n|match4  = Fred Rosser, David Finlay, Rocky Romero, Alex Coughlin and Alex Zayne defeated Team Filthy (Tom Lawlor, J.
