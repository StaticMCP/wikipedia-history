The sculptor of the monument is Omar Eldarov. The monument was raised in 1975, a year after the death of the artist.\nBahlulzade is depicted looking at his favorite landscape, leaning on two empty picture frames. According to the art critic Samir Sadigov, the space, composition, dynamics and image in the sculpture complement each other. The frames, according to Sadigov, in addition to the spatial and aesthetic role, also play the role of an image. The frames are arranged in such a way that the viewer looking at the portrait, depending on the place, will see through them the village of Amirjan and the lake Bulbula from a new perspective.\nThe art critic Ziyadkhan Aliyev spoke about the monument to Sattar Bahlulzade:\nThe sculptor Omar Eldarov said that he created a monument to Sattar Bahlulzade \"at the call of his heart\".\nReferences"
