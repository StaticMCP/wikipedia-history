      "text": "# Discovery Home & Health (British and Irish TV channel)\n\nDiscovery Home & Health was a British and Irish television satellite and cable channel. It was launched on 1 July 2000 as part of the Discovery Channel's bouquet of channels, as Discovery Health, following a similar format to the American channel of the same name.\nIt was rebranded on 7 May 2005 to its current name, and relaunched as a female oriented lifestyle channel. This coincided with the relaunch of Discovery Home & Leisure as Discovery Real Time, a male oriented channel. In the same month, a timeshift service - Discovery Home & Health +1, began test operations on Sky and fully launched on the 23rd.\nOn 30 April 2013, Discovery Home & Health received a new look, following the closure of Discovery Real Time and Discovery Travel & Living, and began broadcasting in widescreen, the last of Discovery's UK channels to do so. Some programming from the closed channels was transferred over to Home & Health. At the same time the channels also moved into Real Time's old EPG slots on Sky and did so on Virgin Media on 7 May 2013.\nThe network was superseded by the streaming platform Discovery+, which effectively carries all of its content, and it was discontinued with immediate effect on 6 January 2021, the same fate which befell Discovery Shed.\nProgramming\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.discoveryuk.com Discovery Channel UK]"
