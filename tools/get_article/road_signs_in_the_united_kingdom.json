Signs in Wales (Welsh) and parts of Scotland (Scottish Gaelic) are bilingual.\nA range of signs are used on British roads, such as motorway signs, warning signs and regulatory signs.\nThe United Kingdom signed the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals on 8 November 1968 but has yet to fully ratify it.\nHistory\nEarly Traffic Signs\nMilestones and direction markers have existed for centuries. Signs to meet other needs developed from the late nineteenth century.\nSigns for Cyclists\nModern British road signage can be traced to the development of the \"ordinary\" bicycle and the establishment of clubs to further the interests of its riders, notably the Cyclists' Touring Club (CTC), the National Cyclists' Union (NCU) and the Scottish Cyclists' Union (SCU). By the early 1880s, all three organisations were erecting their own cast-iron \"danger boards\". Importantly, these signs warned of hazards, rather than just stating distances or giving direction to places, acknowledging the fact that cyclists, like modern motorists, were unlikely to be familiar with the roads they were travelling along and were moving too fast to take avoiding action without prior warning.\n, Cheshire]]\nIn addition, it was the cycling lobby that successfully pressured the government in 1888 into vesting ownership of and responsibility for roads with county councils in previously established highway districts that would be funded from taxation rather than tolls. The districts were active in the erection of semi-standardised directional signs and mileposts in the latter years of the 19th century.\nSigns for Motorists\nThe rise of motoring after 1896 saw the pattern repeated. The larger motoring clubs, notably The Automobile Association (AA) and the Royal Scottish Automobile Club (RSAC) erected their own, idiosyncratic warning boards and direction signs on a wide scale.\nSigns to Protect Bridges\nUnder the Locomotives on Highways Act 1896, railway and canal companies started placing large diamond-shaped signs at their bridges specifying the maximum load (typically both an axle load and a maximum gross weight).\n, Devon placed by the London and South Western Railway]]\n1904 National Traffic Signs\nThe Motor Car Act 1903 required local authorities to erect signs indicating where there were prohibitions or speed limits lower than 20 mph and to warn of dangerous corners, cross roads and precipitous places. In 1904 the Local Government Board issued a circular which defined (but did not mandate the use of) three further national signs in addition to the diamond-shaped motor notices (see image).\nThese were to be set at least  from the ground and  from their reference point. They were\n* Prohibitory signs: solid red disc 18 inches in diameter\n* Speed limit signs: hollow white ring 18 inches in diameter above a plate giving the speed limit in mph\n* Caution signs: hollow red equilateral triangle with 18-inch sides\nThe red disc and the hollow triangle could have a plate beneath, giving details of the prohibition or hazard.   , Argyll. This sign is from the 1920s (it cites Roads Act 1920 rather than Road Traffic Act 1930)]]\nSpeed limit signs always specified the speed limit, which applied only to motor vehicles. Some signs stated this explicitly, as many cyclists could exceed a limit of 10 or 15 mph. The signs were only used where the limit was less than the maximum specified in the Motor Car Act, which was 20 mph. It was customary for red bands to be painted on lamp standards, tram poles, etc where the reduced speed limit was in force.\nIf a plate was attached below a caution sign, it would specify one of the three hazards (dangerous corners, cross roads and precipitous places) and sometimes an admonition, e.g. \"Drive carefully\".\nwith a pre-1921-style Caution sign]]\n1921 Report on Standardisation of Road Signs\nThe format of two-part signs with one of the 1904 shapes above a rectangular plate was used until 1964. A review of signage in 1921 by a committee under (later Sir) Henry Maybury led to the introduction below the warning triangle of rectangular plates 12\" wide by 21\" high containing a symbol and a word or two of explanation beneath.\nThe symbols were based on those which had been developed in continental Europe from 1909, with Maybury insisting that the symbol would from now on \"be regarded as the principal means of indicating the nature of the danger\".\nSix symbols were defined (plus the mirror image for the corner).\ncatalogue of 1930]]\nThe least intuitive was the 'flaming torch of knowledge', which was used for School. It was superseded by a silhouette of children in 1957.\n, Devon]]\nAnother significant change was the introduction of name boards at the entry to towns and villages. These could be combined with the old Caution signs, as at Freshford, Somerset., Somerset combining a Caution triangle with the name of the village and SLOW]]\nIn the late 1920s, motorists needed to understand both the new, standardised and the old Caution signs. The other types of 1904 sign remained in use: white ring for a reduced speed limit; red disc for prohibition; white diamond for motor notices (weight limits on bridges).\n1930 Memorandum No. 291 (Roads)\nIn 1930 the Minister of Transport issued this circular advising local authorities to issue the following additional caution signs:\n* road junctions (T-junction and side roads to the left and right), North Yorkshire]]\n* level crossings without gates (a 4-6-0 locomotive in steam)\n* One-way streets\n* Dead Slow sign\nand the informatory sign:\n* parking places.\nThe Dead Slow sign was the existing Cross Roads sign with new text, surmounted by a red caution triangle inside a red ring. However, this didn't change the rules at cross roads: the driver on the main road still had to \"exercise due caution\"\n1930 Road Traffic Act\nUnder the Road Traffic Act 1930 (RTA), the Government took powers to mandate the traffic signs to be used; hitherto, the signs had merely been advisory. A Departmental Committee was set up in 1931 under Sir Henry Maybury to report on the design of traffic signs.\nOne issue which they had to address was priorities at cross roads. As the 1931 Highway Code, itself another product of the RTA, explained: Cross Roads and Road Junctions No vehicle has a \"right of way\" at cross roads, but it is the duty of a driver on a minor road when approaching a major road to go dead slow and to give way to traffic on it. Nevertheless when you are driving on a major road always keep a sharp look out and drive cautiously at cross roads and road junctions.The Committee reported in 1933 (the Maybury Report). Where previously the design of signs had been published in circulars or reports, now these were mandated by regulations:\n1933 The Traffic Signs (Size, Colour and Type) Provisional Regulations\nThis introduced a new sign\n* Slow at Major Road Ahead\nThe design of signs was updated (with Corner and Double Corner replaced by Bend, which could be used for all types of bend).\nNew signs were added for:\n* Junctions other than cross roads (three types)\n* Road Narrows\n* Narrow Bridge\n* Low Bridge\n* Roundabout\n* Hospital (a Maltese cross was used)\n* No Through Road\n* No Entry (a small rectangular white-on-red text sign)\n* Parking places (this sign was used where parking at the kerb was permitted; elsewhere parking was prohibited on the highway)\nThe Corner and Double Corner were no longer allowed to be placed. They were required to be removed under the 1950 Regulations. Some did survive, attached to houses or in obscure or [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/246880 remote locations]., Lancashire]]\nRed Rings\nA red ring was introduced with a plate beneath. This was used:\n* to restrict the use of the highway in accordance with a traffic order or regulation, e.g. a speed limit;\n* to give mandatory instructions, e.g. Turn Left.\nFor restrictions, the text on the plate cited the order, regulation or bye-law which imposed the restriction and gave its gist. These signs were required to be removed when the 1950 Regulations simplified the text and moved restrictions which applied to all vehicles back to using a red disc\nMore Signs and a Handbook\nFurther signs were added in 1934\n* Hump-back Bridge\n* Belisha beacons\nin 1935:\n* Halt at Major Road Ahead\n* a 30 mph speed limit in built-up areas with a new style of Speed Limit and End of Speed Limit sign.\nand 1936:\n* cattle, sheep and other animals (text only)\nHalt at Major Road Ahead finally placed an obligation on the driver on the minor road to come to a stop before entering or crossing the main road. But the need for caution by the driver on the main road remained: some side roads might not have HALT signs.\nIn 1934, the Road Traffic Acts and Regulations handbook was published. This also clarified direction and distance signage, which remained in that form until 1964. All signs were mounted on posts painted in black and white stripes, and their reverse sides were finished black, green, or more rarely (usually after repainting) white. Orders were mainly landscape and warnings always portrait. The lettering and symbols were black on a white background, except for orders (like 'TURN LEFT') which were white on blue.  The sizes which had been defined in previous circulars but which had only been advisory were now prescribed.\nThis was the end of non-standard permanent signs being erected by motoring clubs, such as the black and yellow vitreous enamel AA signs (although they continued to place temporary direction signs). While the RSAC had ceased erecting signs, the Royal Automobile Club (RAC) had begun to do so to RTA specifications (save for the inclusion of the RAC badge). It was very active in this respect in the late-1930s.\n1935 Highway Code\nA new edition of The Highway Code was published in 1935. This included Supplementary Notes which set out, among other things, the most important traffic signs:\n[section (vi) of Appendix to 1936 Highway Code]\nNote the head of the Halt and Slow at Major Road Ahead signs: a combination of the red ring of a prohibition with the red triangle of a warning.\nThe Supplementary Notes also showed the new signs for use in built-up areas:\n[section (xv) of Appendix to 1936 Highway Code]\nThe 30 mph speed limit sign was the first sign with a symbol inside its border. This was to become standard for speed limits after 1960 and for all red-bordered signs after 1963. For now, it was the only speed  limit for which this design was used. It was cancelled by the \"end of speed limit\". This consisted of a diagonal black slash which cancelled a white disc, an echo, perhaps, of how old white-ring speed limits were cancelled.\nWorld War II\nAs part of its anti-invasion preparations during World War II, the British government instructed all navigational signposts and railway station signs to be removed, so as not to aid potential enemy ground movements. After the war ended, larger motoring associations embarked upon a programme to erect temporary road signs. These temporary signs, which were not required to conform to the standardisation laid down by the government, usually displayed the motoring association’s logo and colour-scheme.\n, in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire]]\nPost-War Changes\n1944 Report of the Departmental Committee on Traffic Signs\nIn February 1943, the Minister of War Transport appointed a Committee to review the system of road traffic signs and make recommendations. It reported in December 1944 but the report was not published until 1946.\nMost of its recommendations were not given effect until the Traffic Signs Regulations of 1950. One recommendation which had to wait longer was for a new Tram Pinch sign. This was not given effect until the 1957 Regulations, when few trams remained.\n1946 Highway Code\nA new edition of The Highway Code was published in September 1946. This showed signs with changes as recommended in the 1944 Report, e.g. the inverted triangle in the ring for the Halt and Slow at Major Road Ahead signs.\n[Signs from 1946 Highway Code]\nHowever, the changes themselves were not given legal effect until the 1950 Traffic Signs Regulations.\n1950 Traffic Signs Regulations\n[https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1950/953/pdfs/uksi_19500953_en.pdf The Traffic Signs (Size, Colour and Type) Regulations, 1950] largely implemented the recommendations of the 1944 Report of the Departmental Committee on Traffic Signs.\nSchedule I listed the signs which were to be placed henceforth; Schedule II listed the old signs which could be retained (most of those from the 1921 standardisation and later, but excluding Corner and Double Corner from 1921, Slow at Major Road Ahead from 1933 and Halt at Major Road Ahead from 1935).\nNew signs were added for:\n* Children (with the flaming torch of knowledge)\n* Car park (white \"P\" on blue background)\n* Caution Deep Ford (red text on white background)\n* Road Works Ahead (white text on red background)\n* No Right Turn (black text on rectangulr board beneath red disc)\n* Speed limit 15 mph (black text beneath red ring)\n* Keep Left (for use on bollards)\nSteep hills now had the gradient specified, e.g. 1 IN 5.\n, North Yorkshire. ]]\nThe locomotive depicted in 'CROSSING NO GATES' became more toy-like (0-6-0 instead of 4-6-0). Orders were now black on white, save for 'NO WAITING', which was black on yellow in a red ring. Some of these changes were part of an attempt to reflect European standards.\nSchedule III of the 1950 Regulations was concerned the text on such plates simplified to \"SPEED LIMIT 15 M.P.H\", \"WEIGHT LIMIT 10 TONS\" or whatever. The 1950 regulations also moved restrictions which applied to all vehicles back to using a red disc. Red rings remained for\n[images from 1954 Highway Code of red disc-type signs and their cancellation]\n1957 Traffic Signs Regulations\nThe 1957 Regulations made design changes to many signs.\nIn the 1957 regulations  the torch symbol for School became a schoolboy and girl marching off a kerb. Children were represented as a boy and girl playing handball on a kerb's edge.\n, Somerset. The triangle's fixings are for a T-bar post and antedate the circular pole and the School sign.]]\n1958-1960 Reform of Speed Limit Signs\nManufacture of Traffic Signs\nEarly road signs were usually cast iron, but this was increasingly displaced by cast aluminium in the 1930s. Cast signs were designed to be maintained by being repainted with the raised lettering and symbol easily picked out by an untrained hand. From the 1930s, this sort of sign could be given an element of night use by the inclusion of glass reflectors. An alternative to casting and painting was vitreous enamelled sheet iron or steel. In the 1950s cast signs were quickly displaced by sheet metal (usually aluminium) coated with adhesive plastics; these could be made reflective, famously by Scotchlite. Such signs had become almost universal by the reforms of the early 1960s.\nDirection Signs to 1963\nPre-Worboys direction signs can occasionally be seen.. Only a handful of these pre-1963 signs still exist.]]\n1960s Reforms\nThe major reform of UK road signage to better reflect European practice happened in two stages. The first was associated with the first motorway construction project and the development of a signage system for it by the Anderson Committee of 1957. Although it was additional to the existing signage, it set several benchmarks that were developed under the Worboys Committee of 1963 that was largely responsible for the road signage system effected from 1964, which is still current. Until Worboys, the most notable differences between European and UK signs was the use of symbols without text wherever possible, thereby increasing the internationalism of their meaning, and with their combined nature, such as warning signs having the symbol inside the triangle instead of on a separate information plate, on the continent. The Worboys Committee recommended that such practices were adopted in the UK and the 'New Traffic Signs' of 1964 were part of the most comprehensive reformation of the UK streetscape ever. Unlike previous government efforts to regulate signage, which tended to be cumulative, Worboys argued a modernist position of starting from a clean slate, with all previous signs being deemed obsolete, illegal even, therefore subject to total and systematic replacement. As a result, local authorities were charged with massive resignage programmes. Order and Prohibition signs were almost all replaced within a couple of years, with the warning and direction signs taking a longer amount of time. Few pre-1964 warning signs survived more than about ten years and while direction signs were similarly replaced more have survived as they were not deemed as essential.\nThe system currently in use was mainly developed in the late 1950s and the early 1960s, with additional colour-coding introduced in the mid-1980s. There were three major steps in the development of the system.\n* The Anderson Committee established the motorway signing system.\n* The Worboys Committee reformed signing for existing all-purpose roads.\n* The Guildford Rules introduced features to indicate different categories of route.\n1957-1962: Anderson Committee\nIn 1957, a government committee was formed to design signs for the new motorway network. A system was needed that could be easily read at high speed. Colin Anderson, chairman of P&O, was appointed chairman; T. G. Usborne, of the Ministry of Transport, had charge of proceedings. Two graphic designers were commissioned to design the system of signage: Jock Kinneir and his assistant (and later business partner) Margaret Calvert. The new signs were first used on the Preston bypass in 1958. These were the signs allocated to motorways by the Anderson Committee in 1962. These would later be replaced in 1975.\n1963: Worboys Committee\nThe UK government formed another committee in 1963 to review signage on all British roads. It was chaired by Sir Walter Worboys of Imperial Chemical Industries. The result was a document that defined traffic signing in Britain, the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions (TSRGD). It was first introduced on 1 January 1965 but has been updated many times since. It is comparable with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices in the United States. The TSRGD is a Statutory Instrument that prescribes the sign faces and permitted variants that may be used on UK roads.\nThe TSRGD is supported by the Traffic Signs Manual (TSM), which consists of eight separately-published chapters which provide \"the codes to be followed in the use, siting, and illumination of signs both on all-purpose roads and motorways. It also covers temporary signs for use in connection with road works, in an emergency by the police, and temporary route signing by motoring organisations and highway authorities.\"\n1994: Guildford Rules\nTo eliminate sign clutter in the mid-1980s, a colour-coding system was developed to indicate different route types on a single sign. The system, also adopted in Ireland, became known as Guildford Rules, after trials in Guildford, Surrey. In July 1994, the system was officially adopted across the United Kingdom by Local Transport Note (LTN) 1/94, The Design and Use of Directional Informatory Signs. This LTN superseded designs laid out in the 1981 TSRGD and Circular Roads 7/75.\nAmong the changes blue bordered 'local direction signs' were eliminated, merged with the black bordered non-primary route sign. This was due to years of issues with inconsistent use of blue-bordered signs and a lack of consensus as to the difference between a 'local direction' and a 'non-primary route'. The inclusion of warning and regulatory signs on direction signs was expanded to more directional signs and improvement instructions on incorporating them onto direction signs. A list of regional destinations and primary destinations was provided to improve consistency.\nLTN 1/94 required that any pre-Worboys (pre-1964) directional signs were to be replaced as soon as possible, and no later than 1 January 2005. Local direction signs with blue borders were to be replaced by 1 January 2015, and all other changes having no specific deadline for change, aside from a in-theory 2015 goal; owing to the general life span of a traffic sign dating to the 1980s and early 1990s having lapsed by that point.\nRevised lists of primary destinations for England and Scotland were released in March 2012. The Guildford Rules are still referred to for guidance on direction sign implementation, as the Department for Transport has not published Chapter 2 'Informatory signs' for the Traffic Signs Manual, covering direction signs as of June 2025.\nDesign\nin Swindon incorporating mini-roundabouts into signage. (The correct method, introduced in the 1994 TSRGD, is to use a black disc with a central white dot for each mini-roundabout.) This peculiarity is common in Wiltshire.]]\nDetailed guidelines govern road signs in the United Kingdom. The basic units of measurement used by sign designers and typographers are the 'x-height' (the height of the lower case letter 'x') and the 'stroke width' (sw) (4 sw = 1 x-height). The sizes of borders, symbols and arrows and the spacing and layout of the sign face are expressed in sw, so that all the elements remain in proportion. The x-height of a sign is dictated mainly by the speed of traffic approaching it; hence  x-heights are common on motorways, whereas parking signs are mostly at  or  x-height.\nShape\nAlmost all signs have rounded corners.\nFile:Traffic-signs-manual-chapter-3-diagram 602 (2008).svg|\nFile:Traffic signs manual-chapter-4-diagram 557 (2008).svg|\nFile:Traffic signs manual-chapter-4-diagram 557x1 (2008).svg|\nFile:Traffic-signs-manual-chapter-3-diagram 601-1 (2008).svg|\nFile:Traffic-signs-manual-chapter-3-diagram 608 (2008).svg|\nUnits of measurement\nThe United Kingdom uses mostly imperial units on road signs for distance measurements and speed limits. Vehicle weight limits are signed only in metric (TSRGD 1981) but older signs with height, width and length restrictions may show metric units in addition to imperial. For distances only miles and yards are used. From March 2015, all new height, width and length restrictions must have dual metric-imperial units.\nWhilst yards are used on signs, the DfT's TSM (Traffic Signs Manual) generally places temporary road work distance signs at their respective places in metres (within an allowed 10% tolerance), meaning a temporary road sign indicating  actually indicates .\nColours\nThree colour combinations are used on Worboys direction signs depending upon the category of the route. All roads are categorised as either motorways (white on blue), primary routes (white on dark green with yellow route numbers), or non-primary routes (black on white).\nTSRGD 1994 also prescribed a system of white-on-brown direction signs for tourist and recreational attractions. TSRGD 2002 updated this and introduced a system of black-on-yellow signs for roadworks. TSRGD 2016 is the current version in force.\nOn Advance Direction Signs, as introduced under the Guildford Rules, the background colour indicates the category of route on which it is located. On all directional signs, destination names are placed on the colour appropriate to the category of route used from that junction. A panel of one colour on a different colour of background, therefore, indicates a change of route status. A smaller area of colour, called a patch, surrounds a bracketed route number (but not its associated destination) to indicate a higher status route that is joined some distance away. A patch may only be coloured blue or green.\nSigns indicating a temporary change, such as roadworks or route diversions, are denoted with a yellow background. Usually, these signs use a simple black on yellow colour code, more complex signage use the conventional signs superimposed onto a yellow background.\nIn some areas, such as the Dartmoor National Park, additional signs and colours are used to distinguish road conditions. In addition to the national colour schemes, the park also uses white signs with a light blue border and text to denote routes suitable for medium-sized vehicles and white signs with a brown border and text for routes suitable for cars and small vehicles only. The park also uses fingerpost signs for routes suitable for local traffic only. These routes are publicised in park leaflets and other media.\nFor ease of reference, the main colour-coding rules may be summarised as below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Sign background\n! scope=\"col\" | Border\n! scope=\"col\" | Lettering\n! scope=\"col\" | Usage\n! scope=\"col\" | Ruleset\n|-\n| Blue || White || White ||  || Anderson\n|-\n| Green || White || White (with yellow route numbers) ||  || Worboys\n|-\n| White || Black || Black ||   || Worboys\n|-\n| White || Black || Black ||  ||\n|-\n| White || Blue || Black ||  || Worboys, now defunct and replaced by above\n|-\n| Brown || White || White || ||\n|-\n| Black || White || White ||  ||\n|-\n| White || Red || Black || ||\n|-\n| Yellow || Black || Black ||  || Guildford\n|}\nThe colour-coding for panels on signs may be summarised as below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Panel background\n! scope=\"col\" | Border\n! scope=\"col\" | Lettering\n! scope=\"col\" | Usage\n! scope=\"col\" | Ruleset\n|-\n| Blue || White || White || || Guildford\n|-\n| Green || White || White || || Guildford\n|-\n| Brown || White || White || || Guildford\n|-\n| White || Red || Black || || Guildford\n|}\nTypefaces\nTwo typefaces are specified for British road signs: Transport and Motorway.\nTransport is a mixed-case font and is used for all text on fixed permanent signs except route numbers on motorway signs. It is used in two weights: Transport Medium (for light text on dark backgrounds) and Transport Heavy (for dark text on light backgrounds).\nMotorway has a limited character set consisting of just numbers and a few letters and symbols needed to show route numbers; it has elongated characters and is designed to add emphasis to route numbers on motorways. Motorway is used to sign all route numbers on motorways themselves, and may also be used on non-motorway roads to sign directions in which motorway regulations apply immediately (such as motorway slip roads). Motorway Permanent is light characters on a dark background; Motorway Temporary is dark on light.\nTransport Medium and Motorway Permanent were developed for the Anderson Committee and appeared on the first motorway signs. The other two typefaces are similar but have additional stroke width in the letters to compensate for light backgrounds. These typefaces are the only ones permitted on road signs in the UK. Although signs containing other typefaces do appear occasionally in some places, they are explicitly forbidden in government guidelines and are technically illegal.\nLanguage\nnear Menai Bridge.]]\nBilingual signs are used in Wales. Welsh highway authorities, until 2016, could choose whether the signs in their area were \"English-priority\" or \"Welsh-priority\", and the language having priority in each highway authority's area appeared first on signs. Most of south Wales used English-priority while western, mid, and most of northern Wales were Welsh-priority. New regulations that came into force in 2016 mandate all signs to be in Welsh first, with the existing \"English-priority\" signage being replaced only when they otherwise would. Bilingual signs were permitted by special authorisation after 1965, and in 1972 the Bowen Committee recommended that they should be provided systematically throughout Wales.\nA small number of multilingual signs exist in the UK on major roads that leave major ports (such as the Port of Dover). They give the UK standard speed limits and remind drivers to drive on the left, in English, French, and German. Multilingual 'no stopping' signs exist in several locations on the M25.\nAnother example of multilingual signs in the UK are for Escape Lanes (or Runaway truck ramps) warning not to block the escape lane in English, French, German and Spanish.\nIn the Scottish Highlands and Islands, many road signs have Scottish Gaelic in green or orange, in addition to English in black. This is part of the Gaelic language revival encouraged by many, including the Scottish Government and Bòrd na Gàidhlig.\nRetroreflection\nRoad signs in the UK must be retroreflective in order for drivers to read them at night. There are three commonly used grades of materials used:\n*Class 1 (engineering grade) is a low-performance glass bead product, it was the first reflective material used on the UK network and invented by 3M. Today in the UK it is used only for street nameplates and parking signs.\n*Class 2 (high-intensity) is generally a microprismatic product which uses truncated cube corners to return light to the driver. It is commonly used for directional signs or less important regulatory signs. There are also high-intensity glass bead products that meet this class.\n*Class 3 (diamond grade) is a high end microprismatic product for important signs, those on high-speed roads and in areas of ambient lighting where a driver may be distracted by the light clutter. Class 3 can be divided into two divisions; 3A for long distance and 3B for short distance. Currently, the only product that performs to these levels is Diamond Grade DG3.\nCategorisation\nWarning signs\nThe importance of a warning sign is emphasised by the red border around its edge and the triangular shape. Some warning signs do not have a red border like sharp deviation. The priority of traffic through the junction is indicated by the broader line. Examples below exclude low bridges, railway and tramway level crossings, bus and pedal cycle facilities and road works.\nFile:UK traffic sign 501.svg|STOP or GIVE WAY ahead\nFile:UK traffic sign

However, if the bridge is an arch over the road, warning signs are used as the height varies across the width of the carriageway.

Except on the main carriageway of a motorway, coloured panels are used to indicate routes from the junction being signed that have a different status. A direction sign (DS) should always be a single colour indicating the status of the road to be joined, although there are a few rare exceptions to this rule.\nThe Heavy and Medium typefaces were designed to compensate for the optical illusion that makes dark lines on pale backgrounds appear narrower than pale lines on dark backgrounds. Hence destinations are written in mixed case white Transport Medium on green and blue backgrounds, and in black Transport Heavy on white backgrounds. Route numbers are coloured yellow when placed directly on a green background. Some signs logically show the closest destination on the route first (i.e., on top), while others show the most distant settlement first. On a roundabout DS, the route locations are usually listed with the closest destination at the bottom and the furthest away at the top when going straight ahead, and likewise going left and right. However, many left-right signs more logically indicate the closest destination at the top with further afield destinations listed in descending order.\nDestinations and roads which cannot be directly accessed on a driver's current actual route but can be accessed via an artery route of that carriageway, are displayed in brackets.\nAll types of ADS (but not DS) may optionally have the junction name at the top of the sign in capital letters in a separate panel.\nA route confirmatory sign is placed either after a junction where distances were not shown on the ADS or DS or is placed on an overhead information sign but does not show distances to the destinations along that route.\nFile:UK traffic sign 2930.svg|End of motorway regulations, including the national speed limit in 1 mile\nFile:UK traffic sign 2901.svg|Start of motorway regulations, including the national speed limit\nFile:UK traffic sign 2910.svg|Number of route reached from a motorway exit road\nFile:UK traffic sign 2918.svg| to the next motorway service area\nFile:UK traffic sign 2912.svg|Junction ahead with another motorway\nFile:UK traffic sign 2932.svg|Entrance to motorway service area, or similar facility within the length of a motorway where motorway regulations cease to apply\nFile:UK traffic sign 2903.svg|Motorway junction ahead, displaying the route number and destination reached by taking this route\nFile:UK traffic sign 2911.svg|Route number of the motorway with destinations and distances to places along or reached from that route\nFile:UK traffic sign 2902.svg|Direction to a motorway at the junction shown, indicating route number and destination reached\nFile:UK traffic sign 2921.svg|Entrance to a motorway service area\nFile:UK traffic sign 2917V.svg|Availability of motorway service areas ahead with distances\nFile:UK traffic sign 2917.svg|Availability of motorway service areas ahead with distances and names of operators\nFile:UK traffic sign 2919.3 (Unbranded).svg|Approach sign to motorway service area listing operator and six franchises available at the stop.\nFile:UK traffic sign 2919.3 (Branded).svg|Approach sign to motorway service area listing operator and six franchises available at the stop.

These mark diversionary routes in the event that the road ahead is closed for any reasons. Motorists can navigate following the symbol and can find their way back to the original road at a junction above the closure. The four symbols may be a solid shape or just outlines. They are most commonly placed on directional signs, following the route number (e.g. A 25) but may be free standing.\nMotorway exits have trigger signs that are normally covered. In the event of a closure, the sign is uncovered and will say, for instance, \"To rejoin M6 follow (symbol)\". Following the symbol will allow rejoining at a later junction.\nOn minor roads a simple black on yellow sign with an arrow and the word Diversion is used, as in the last sign below.\nFile:EDR Symbol - Solid Circle.svg|Solid circle - Emergency diversion route for motorway and other main road traffic\nFile:EDR Symbol - Solid Triangle.svg|Solid triangle - Emergency diversion route for motorway and other main road traffic\nFile:EDR Symbol - Hollow Square.svg|Hollow square - Emergency diversion route for motorway and other main road traffic\nFile:EDR Symbol - Hollow Diamond.svg|Hollow diamond - Emergency diversion route for motorway and other main road traffic\nFile:UK traffic sign 2716.svg|Diversion trigger sign - Main road closed, follow diversion to arrive at the same location\nFile:UK traffic sign 2704V.svg|For triangle diversion, turn right\nFile:UK traffic sign 2702L.svg|Diversion sign on minor roads or for road works starting to left.\nInformation signs\nInformational signs are usually rectangular and generally blue with white text.\nFile:UK traffic sign 810-L.svg|One-way traffic\nFile:UK traffic sign 611.svg|Pass either side to reach the same destination (often incorrectly used to mean pass either side regardless of destination)\nFile:UK traffic sign 811.svg|Traffic has priority over vehicles coming from the opposite direction\nFile:UK traffic sign 816.svg|No through road\nFile:UK traffic sign 820V2.svg|Unsuitable for heavy goods vehicles\nFile:UK traffic sign 820V4.svg|Unsuitable for long vehicles\nFile:UK traffic sign 820.1.svg|No hard shoulder for\nFile:UK traffic sign 818.4.svg|Location of weight restriction ahead with indication of an alternative route (may show a different restriction or that the restriction is gross weight rather than unladen weight)\nFile:UK traffic sign 822.svg|Passing place on a narrow road\nRoadworks and temporary signs\nRoadworks are normally signalled with a triangular, red-bordered warning format is used to indicate that there are works ahead.

They can be fixed to a signpost, wall, lamp column or building. The text can be in many different fonts but normally either the Transport typeface used on road signs or the serif font designed by David Kindersley. In many areas, the sign will also show the name of the local authority, its coat of arms, or part of the street’s postcode.\nLocation identifiers\nNumbered location markers of one type or another are used to identify specific locations along a road. Historically, milestones were used, but since the early 20th century they fell into disuse. However, for administrative and maintenance purposes, distance marker posts and driver location signs have been erected on motorways and certain dual carriageways.\nThe numbers on distance marker posts are embedded into emergency roadside telephone numbers and are used by the emergency services to pinpoint incidents.\nThe advent of the mobile phone meant that drivers were not accessing location information embedded into motorway emergency telephone systems, and since 2007 driver location signs have been erected on many motorways. These contain important information about the location and carriageway direction.\nTraffic lights\nFile:UK traffic signal - Standard Aspects.svg|Standard traffic light, with three lamps\nFile:UK traffic signal -

These regulations do not extend to Northern Ireland. Traffic signs in Northern Ireland are prescribed by The Traffic Signs Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1997 and are administered by the Northern Ireland Assembly.\nNorthern Ireland signs are broadly the same  those in Great Britain, although changes made in Great Britain are often not made in Northern Ireland at the same time. One example is the series of bends ahead sign, which was removed from TSRGD in 1975 but only removed from the Northern Ireland regulations in 1979.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Country\n! Drives on...\n! Speed units\n! Warning sign style\n|-\n! Northern Ireland\n| style=\"background: #ECFFC0;\" | left\n| style=\"background: #ECFFC0;\" | mph\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n|}\nCrown dependencies\nThe designs of road signs as prescribed in the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions (TSRGD) do not extend to other territories that come under the jurisdiction of the Crown. Road signs in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are under the jurisdiction of their local legislatures. Although the policy in these territories is to align their road signs with those prescribed in the TSRGD, small variations may be seen.\nIsle of Man\nThe Tynwald (Isle of Man Parliament), through its Traffic Signs (Application) Regulations 2003, explicitly included Part I of the TSRGD into Manx law, but not the other parts of that legislation. One of the consequences of this partial incorporation is that while in England and Wales speed limit signs had to appear on both sides of a carriageway until 2016, this was not necessary for the Isle of Man. Likewise, an all-way stop is permissible in the Isle of Man, whilst it has been prohibited in Great Britain since 2002.\nThe use of the derestricted sign differs according to jurisdiction: in the Isle of Man it means no speed limit applies, whereas in Jersey it denotes a  speed limit, which is the highest permitted speed on the island.\nChannel Islands\nGuernsey and Jersey have a unique sign \"Filter in turn\", which is a give way without priority. It is similar to the all-way stops found elsewhere in the world, although there is no requirement to halt.\nJersey\nIn Jersey, road signs and markings are regulated by the Traffic Signs (Jersey) Order 1968.\nThe standard bus stop road marking (Diagram 1025) is painted white on Jersey roads, and a unique smaller bus stop marking is found at most stops, which lacks the stop cage.\nBy Article 18, the Minister for Infrastructure may cause a yellow line to be placed transverse across a minor road. This indicates a 'give way' rule, as normally indicated by double white dashed lines elsewhere. The standard give way triangle (Diagram 1023) is painted yellow, even at approaches to white give way lines at roundabouts.\nParking signage is considerably different. Unloading bays (Diagram 1018J) allow loading and unloading of goods and are painted yellow with yellow upright signs. Otherwise parking signs indicate 'paycard' or 'Disc' limit restrictions. A single yellow line (Diagram 1017) indicates a 24-hour waiting restriction.\nAt the end of all one-way roads, the marking 'NO ENTRY' is placed to ban entry for vehicles.\nThe Z-bend sign (Diagram 514) is prescribed and still used. The end of a cycle track can be indicated by a blue cycle track sign with a red stripe.\nIn Jersey, traffic signals follow the French pattern, omitting the red-amber phase.\nIn Jersey, there are less onerous requirements for the signage of speed limits than the UK. Repeater signs are never used for , and are sometimes used for  where there are street lights (which would not be necessary in the UK). Furthermore, there is no requirement that speed limit signs appear on both sides of the carriageway (consequently they often only appear on one).\nGuernsey\n]]\nWeight restriction signs in Guernsey use hundredweight (\"cwt\") as a unit rather than the tonne, although one cwt was redefined as exactly 50.8023&nbsp;kg in 1991.\nGuernsey devolves road markings and signs to Alderney and Sark. Sark does not permit road transport, aside from cycles and farm vehicles. Alderney has some different road markings, but the signs are broadly the same as Guernsey.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Some signs are in Turkish as well as English and Greek.\nAnguilla\nAnguilla mostly uses the same road signs as the United Kingdom with minor differences. Anguilla's roads occasionally cross large dish drains requiring a vehicle to slow down to cross. Because of this, the territory has its own unique dip sign.\nAscension Island\nAscension Island mainly uses signs similar to the UK's, but the yellow diagonal signs common to the United States are also found on the island.\nBermuda\nBermuda mostly uses the same style as the United Kingdom, with some exceptions. Speed limit signs are in kilometres per hour and occasionally miles per hour, and all limit signs have this marked. Longer distances are typically in kilometres, however shorter distances are signed in yards. Height and width sign restrictions are in both imperial units and metric. No entry signs have \"NO ENTRY\" written in black down the centre as was often used in the UK prior to 1965. Goods vehicles are prohibited by class rather than weight: a list of prohibited vehicle classes will usually accompany a generic \"no lorries\" sign. Bermuda still uses the Z-bend sign, phased out in the UK since 1975.\nBritish Indian Ocean Territory\nThe British Indian Ocean Territory's road signs are modelled on those of the United States' Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.\nCayman Islands\nThe road signs of the Cayman Islands are similar to the UK's; the only main difference is some signs have allowable alternatives from the United States' Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, mainly for parking restriction signs. The warning sign for dead ends is one of the only signs to follow the United States standard in the Road Code, although other US-influenced signs are listed for use near schools.\nIn practice, the Transport typeface is not used and signs are written in all caps. Pedestrian crossings are often marked with a US-style sign instead of a Belisha beacon.\nFalkland Islands\nThe Falkland Islands' road signs are similar to the UK. There is an additional road sign used in the Falklands to denote a minefield.\nGibraltar\nThe road signs of Gibraltar are similar to the UK, with some signs being reversed to reflect driving on the opposite side of the road. There are some warning signs specific to Gibraltar, mainly to do with the unique wildlife of the territory. Speed limits and distances are in metric, in keeping with the rest of the Iberian Peninsula. However, height and width clearance warning and regulatory signs are both in imperial and metric.\nMontserrat\nThe road signs of Montserrat are similar to those of the UK. No entry signs have \"NO ENTRY\" written in red down the centre, similar to the design used in the Bahamas.\nPitcairn Island\nRoad transport in Pitcairn is primarily by quad bike. Signs are modelled on those used in New Zealand, although they are not kept in step with New Zealand updates. Pitcairn uses a unique slow down sign seen in neither the UK nor New Zealand &ndash; a red octagon with \"SLOW DOWN\" in white.\nSaint Helena\nThe road signs on Saint Helena are similar to the UK's.\nSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands\nSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands inherited the traffic regulations of the Falkland Islands when it was made a separate territory in 1985. There are very few roads on the island and they are all gravel and unmarked.\nTurks and Caicos Islands\nThe lack of road signs and official street names in the Turks and Caicos Islands was blamed for emergency vehicles not reaching their destination promptly, the government has since embarked on a programme of labelling roads and installing signs. Roads are labelled in a similar way to the United States and Canada. Road signs are similar to those of the UK, although older MUTCD-influenced signs, including US-style speed limit signs, have not been actively replaced and are still seen.\nBrown signs are sometimes erroneously used instead of green to denote primary routes. Officially, green is used for primary routes and white for local routes, as in the UK. There are no traffic lights in the Turks and Caicos Islands, most intersections are roundabouts.\nVirgin Islands\nThe road signs of the Virgin Islands are similar in design to those used in the United States. The BVI drivers manual lists British-influenced signage with occasional differences, but in reality, all signs installed follow the United States' Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices developed by the FHWA.\nIn 2018, new legislation was introduced in the Virgin Islands requiring that speed limits be labelled in both mph and km/h.\nWarning sign style\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
