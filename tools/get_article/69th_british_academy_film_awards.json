For the eleventh time, Stephen Fry acted as the host. The ceremony commenced with a segment commemorating the year in film, which was accompanied by the song \"Heroes\" by David Bowie, who had died the previous month. Highlighting that the ceremony was being held on Valentine's Day, the ceremony showed a kiss cam where random celebrities such as Dame Maggie Smith and Leonardo DiCaprio were persuaded by Fry to kiss each other. Fry also received a number of negative comments after he said of Best Costume Design winner Jenny Beavan (Mad Max: Fury Road) as \"Only one of the great cinematic costume designers would come to an awards ceremony dressed as a bag lady\". He subsequently deleted his Twitter account following criticism of his joke.\nA number of presenters referred to the lack of diversity at the Academy Awards. Rebel Wilson and Sacha Baron Cohen both made jokes referring to the controversy. Sidney Poitier was not present to collect his fellowship due to ill health. Jamie Foxx and Poitier's daughter, Sydney Tamiia Poitier, presented the award to him in person at his home in Los Angeles. Noel Clarke, Lulu, and Oprah Winfrey paid tribute to him in a filmed segment.\nThe In Memoriam section featured Alan Rickman, Melissa Mathison, Andrew Lesnie, Maureen O'Hara, Gayle Griffiths, Haskell Wexler, Colin Welland, James Horner, David Bowie, Ron Moody, June Randall, Julie Harris, Frank Finlay, Philip French, Vilmos Zsigmond, Albert Maysles, Richard Johnson, Wes Craven, Jacques Rivette, Penelope Houston, Tommie Manderson, Christopher Wood, Saeed Jaffrey, Sheila Sim and Sir Christopher Lee.\nStatistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Films that received multiple nominations\n! style=\"background:;| Nominations\n! style=\"background:;| Film\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 9\n| Bridge of Spies\n|-\n| Carol\n|-\n| 8\n| The Revenant\n|-\n| 7\n| Mad Max: Fury Road\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 6\n| Brooklyn\n|-\n| The Martian\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 5\n| The Big Short\n|-\n| The Danish Girl\n|-\n| Ex Machina\n|-\n| 4\n| Star Wars: The Force Awakens\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 3\n| The Hateful Eight\n|-\n| Sicario\n|-\n| Spotlight\n|-\n| Steve Jobs\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 2\n| Amy\n|-\n| Inside Out\n|-\n| Room\n|-\n| Theeb\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Films that received multiple awards\n! style=\"background:;| Awards\n! style=\"background:;| Film\n|-\n| 5\n| The Revenant\n|-\n| 4\n| Mad Max: Fury Road\n|}\nIn Memoriam\n* Alan Rickman\n* Melissa Mathison\n* Andrew Lesnie\n* Maureen O'Hara\n* Omar Sharif\n* Gayle Griffiths\n* Haskell Wexler\n* Colin Welland\n* James Horner\n* David Bowie\n* Ron Moody\n* June Randall\n* Julie Harris\n* Frank Finlay\n* Philip French\n* Vilmos Zsigmond\n* Albert Maysles\n* Richard Johnson\n* Wes Craven\n* Jacques Rivette\n* Penelope Houston\n* Tommie Manderson\n* Christopher Wood\n* Saeed Jaffrey\n* Sheila Sim\n* Christopher Lee\nSee also\n* 5th AACTA International Awards\n* 88th Academy Awards\n* 41st César Awards\n* 21st Critics' Choice Awards\n* 68th Directors Guild of America Awards\n* 29th European Film Awards\n* 73rd Golden Globe Awards\n* 36th Golden Raspberry Awards\n* 30th Goya Awards\n* 31st Independent Spirit Awards\n* 21st Lumière Awards\n* 6th Magritte Awards\n* 3rd Platino Awards\n* 27th Producers Guild of America Awards\n* 20th Satellite Awards\n* 42nd Saturn Awards\n* 22nd Screen Actors Guild Awards\n* 68th Writers Guild of America Awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
