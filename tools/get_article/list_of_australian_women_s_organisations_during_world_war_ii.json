Members of these organisations wore uniforms that were similar to those of the Australian military, adopted military-style ranks and regularly met for training sessions. The organisations pre-dated the establishment of women's branches of the military, which began to be formed in mid-1940.\nOfficial\n*Australian Women's Army Service\n*Australian Women's Land Army\n*Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force\n*Royal Australian Naval Nursing Service\n*Women's Royal Australian Naval Service\nVolunteer\nduring a 1941 parade at the Melbourne Cricket Ground]]\n*Australian Women's Legion\n*Red Cross Link\n*Women's Air Training Corps\n*Women's Australian National Services\n*Women's Auxiliary Service (Burma)\n*Women's Auxiliary Transport Service\n*Women's Emergency Signalling Corps\n*Women's Flying Club\n*Women's National Emergency Legion.\n*Women's Reserve Emergency Naval Service\n*Women's Reserve Emergency Naval Service, Social Service Institute\n*Women's Transport Corps\n*Women's Cavalry Corps\nSee also\n* Australian women during World War II\nReferences\nCitations\nWorks consulted\n*\n*"
