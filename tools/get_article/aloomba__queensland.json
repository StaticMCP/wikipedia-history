It is bounded to the north by the Mulgrave River which then passes through the west of the locality. The Bruce Highway passes through the west of the locality but not through the town which is about  east of the highway but about  away by road. The North Coast railway line enters the locality from the south immediately to the west of the highway but then veers to the east in order to pass through the town, after which the railway veers back towards the highway but does not rejoin it within the locality.\nThe mountainous western part of the locality is within the Malbon Thompson Forest Reserve. The remainder is relatively flat freehold land used predominantly for farming, particularly growing sugarcane. There is a network of cane tramways to deliver the harvested sugarcane to the Mulgrave Sugar Mill in Gordonvale.\nHistory\nThe town name is a corruption of the Yidinji word \"Ngalumba\", indicating hard milkwood tree (Alstonia muelleriana).\nAloomba Provisional School opened on 15 May 1899, becoming Aloomba State School on 1 January 1909.\nOn 20 April 1916, the Cane Beetles March commenced at Mooliba (now Mirriwinni).
