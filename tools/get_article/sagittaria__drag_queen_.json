Her drag name was directly inspired by Aquaria, winner of the tenth season of the American series ''RuPaul's Drag Race'', who named herself after her astrological sign, Aquarius. However, although Sagittaria's name is derived from the Sagittarius sign, her actual sign is Cancer. During her run on Drag Race, she won one challenge (improv comedy) and placed in the bottom twice, winning lip-syncs against Dovima Nurmi (whom she was previously roommates with) and Pupi Poisson, and eventually positioned herself as one of the three season finalists. The winner of the season was Carmen Farala, and Sagittaria placed as the co-runner up alongside Killer Queen.\nAfter the end of the broadcast of the season, Sagittaria was part of the national tour of the Gran Hotel de las Reinas alongside her fellow contestants of the program, as well as host Supremme de Luxe. In 2022, she was part of the cast of the documentary Tacones sobre ruedas (\"Heels on Wheels\"), directed by Pau Canivell. On June 24, 2023, she performed at the LGBT Pride event in León. That same month, she participated in a photoshoot collaboration to demand LGBT rights along with a large number of fellow contestants from Drag Race España and ''RuPaul's Drag Race UK contestant Choriza May.\nShe cites her fashion influences to be the hairstyles of the 1950s, the fashion of the 1960s, Mugler, and Versace. Musically, her influences are Lady Gaga, Madonna and Kylie Minogue.\nFilmography\nTelevision\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Title\n!
