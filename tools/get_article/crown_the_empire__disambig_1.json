The band comprises vocalist Andrew \"Andy Leo\" Rockhold (born 1994), guitarist Brandon Hoover (born 1993), and bassist Hayden Tree (born 1993). They are currently signed to  Rise Records and have released five studio albums. Their most recent studio album, Dogma, was released on April 28, 2023.\nHistory\nFormation and Limitless EP (2010–2011)\nCrown the Empire was formed in May 2010, when \"Brandon [Hoover] and Austin decided to start jamming together\" during their time at Colleyville Heritage High School. The initial line-up consisted of lead vocalist Andrew \"Andy Leo\" Rockhold (then Velasquez), rhythm guitarist/backing vocalist Hayden Tree, lead guitarist/backing vocalist Brandon Hoover, bassist Devin Detar, drummer Alex Massey and keyboardist Austin Duncan. The band's ultimate goal was to \"be heavier than most bands in their area,\" while \"bringing huge, poppy choruses to a genre that can become pretty stale.\" Crown the Empire played their first show at Compass Church in Colleyville, Texas, on July 10, 2010. During their formative years, the band experienced a number of lineup changes: In late 2010, Detar was replaced by Brandon Shroyer and in early 2011, the band fired their drummer Alex Massey. After some months of auditioning drummers, Brent Taddie was announced as the band's new drummer on June 6, 2011. Five days later, the band uploaded a video asking their fans for vocal covers with a focus on harsh vocals. The winner of this contest was announced on June 30 as Zac Johnson, who was invited to join Crown the Empire, performing harsh vocals at their live shows. Around October 2011, bassist Brandon Shroyer decided to leave the band, which resulted in the guitarists switching instruments. Brandon Hoover switched from lead to rhythm guitar, Hayden Tree took over Shroyer's position on bass and Bennett \"Benn Suede\" Vogelman joined Crown the Empire as their new lead guitarist.\nThis line-up, with the exception of Johnson, would go on to record their first EP, Limitless, which was released on iTunes on November 29, 2011. On December 5, 2011, the band released a behind-the-scenes look at the filming for the music video for \"Voices\". During the video the band announced the release date for the music video to be December 11. Also in December, they released a cover of the classic holiday song \"Let It Snow\" and an acoustic performance of \"Wake Me Up\".\nIntroduction of Escamilla, signing to Rise Records and The Fallout (2012–2013)\nBy February 2012, Johnson had left the band and they would enlist the help of their manager Brendan Barone to perform harsh vocals. In March, Crown the Empire performed a short tour with A Skylit Drive and appeared at the Never Say Never Music Festival. They also teased a big announcement, which turned out to be their signing to Rise Records. Along with the announcement video, the band released a free cover of the song \"Moves Like Jagger\" in appreciation of the support from their fans.\nHaving performed with the band since June 2, 2012, the band officially announced the addition of harsh vocalist David Escamilla on August 26, 2012. Along with the news of Escamilla joining the band, they announced that they would be heading into the studio with Joey Sturgis to begin recording their debut album. On September 7, the band released the music video for \"Johnny Ringo\". Around this time, Hayden Tree was let go because the band felt he didn't focus on the craft enough. After touring Europe for the first time with Pierce the Veil, the band asked Tree to come back.\nOn October 23, the band announced the name and release date of their debut album, The Fallout, which was released on November 20 through Rise Records.
