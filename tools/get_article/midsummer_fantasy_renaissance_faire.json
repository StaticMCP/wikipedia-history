The wheel crushes ice into a cup when someone walks in it, after which people have to turn a crank to make the ice move down the conveyor belt. Once the ice is at the end of the conveyor, people then chose a flavor for their slushie. GreenWolf said he was inspired when he was performing as a magician and saw similar hamster wheels in being used Eastern and Southern regions of the United States.\nSetting and plot\nThe Midsummer Fantasy Renaissance Faire is set in the fictional Kingdom of Cuulayne. Midsummer has a different story every year, the 13th faire in particular followed a \"Call of the Vanguard\" story, where a warrior goes on a quest to join a group that protects mages.\nAttractions\nPeople at Midsummer can watch flaming jugglers, music shows, magic shows, and live combat. There are also several food and artisan vendors, the latter selling both fantasy and historically themed items. There is an onsite Proving Ground, where people can participate in axe throwing, archery, and knife throwing activities.\nAs of 2018, there are more than 100 in-costume characters at Midsummer.\nReferences"
