The film stars Brian Blessed (who also co-directed the film, along with Tony Rotherham) in the title role. Apart from  Peter Brook's King Lear in 1971, it is the only feature-length film adaptation to preserve Shakespeare's verse. Yvonne Griggs, in ''Shakespeare's King Lear: A close study of the relationship between text and film'' (2009), characterised it as \"a very stilted costume drama\".\nCast\n* Hildegarde Neil as the Fool\n* Phillipa Peak as Cordelia - King's good daughter\n* Paul Curran as King of France - Cordelia's husband\n* Claire Laurie as Regan - King's vengeful daughter\n* Graham McTavish as Duke of Albany - Regan's husband\n* Caroline Lennon as Goneril - King's vengeful daughter\n* Mark Denny as Duke of Cornwall - Goneril's husband\n* Robert Whelan as Earl of Glouster - Blinded by Cornwell\n* Jason Riddington as Edmund - Glouster's evil bastard son\n* Mark Burgess as Edgar - Glouster's legitimate son\n* Iain Stuart Robertson as Earl of Kent - King's servant\n}}\nSee also\n* List of historical drama films\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
