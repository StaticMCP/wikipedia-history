      "text": "# Best Comeback Athlete ESPY Award\n\nThe Best Comeback Athlete ESPY Award has been presented annually since 1993 to the sportsperson, irrespective of gender, contesting a team sport professionally under the auspices of one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada or an individual sport on either an amateur or professional basis primarily in the United States or internationally under the auspices of a sport governing body adjudged to have made the most significant, profound, or impressive comeback from serious illness, injury, personal or familial hardship, retirement, or significant loss of form.\nBetween 1993 and 2004, the award voting panel comprised variously fans; sportswriters and broadcasters, sports executives, and retired sportspersons, termed collectively experts; and ESPN personalities, but balloting thereafter has been exclusively by fans over the Internet from amongst choices selected by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee.\nThrough the 2001 iteration of the ESPY Awards, ceremonies were conducted in February of each year to honor achievements over the previous calendar year; awards presented thereafter are conferred in June and reflect performance from the June previous. The award wasn't awarded in 2020 or 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nList of winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"white-space: nowrap;\"\n!Year\n!Sportsperson\n!Nationality\n!Team\n!Competition,federation,or league\n!Sport\n|-\n|1993\n|Dave Winfield\n|\n|Toronto Blue Jays\n|Major League Baseball\n|Baseball\n|-\n|1994\n|Mario Lemieux\n|\n|Pittsburgh Penguins\n|National Hockey League\n|Ice hockey\n|-\n|1995\n|Dan Marino\n|\n|Miami Dolphins\n|National Football League\n|American football\n|-\n|1996\n|Michael Jordan\n|\n|Chicago Bulls\n|National Basketball Association\n|Basketball\n|-\n|1997\n|Evander Holyfield\n|\n|\n|\n|Boxing(Heavyweight)\n|-\n|1998\n|Roger Clemens\n|\n|Toronto Blue Jays\n|Major League Baseball\n|Baseball\n|-\n|1999\n|Eric Davis\n|\n|Baltimore Orioles\n|Major League Baseball\n|Baseball\n|-\n|2000\n|Lance Armstrong\n|\n|US Postal\n|UCI ProTour\n|Road bicycle racing\n|-\n|2001\n|Andrés Galarraga\n|\n|Atlanta Braves\n|Major League Baseball\n|Baseball\n|-\n|2002\n|Jennifer Capriati\n|\n|\n|WTA Tour\n|Tennis\n|-\n|2003\n|Tommy Maddox\n|\n|Pittsburgh Steelers\n|National Football League\n|American football\n|-\n|2004\n|Bethany Hamilton\n|\n|Surfing\n|\n|Surfing\n|-\n|2005\n|Mark Fields\n|\n|Carolina Panthers\n|National Football League\n|American football\n|-\n|2006\n|Tedy Bruschi\n|\n|New England Patriots\n|National Football League\n|American football\n|-\n|2007\n| colspan=5 align=center|No award given\n|-\n|2008\n|Josh Hamilton\n|\n|Cincinnati Reds, Texas Rangers\n|Major League Baseball\n|Baseball\n|-\n|2009\n|Dara Torres\n|\n|\n|\n|Swimming\n|-\n|2010\n|Kim Clijsters\n|\n|\n|WTA Tour\n|Tennis\n|-\n|2011\n|Mark Herzlich\n|\n| Boston College Eagles\n| NCAA (Division I FBS)\n|American football\n|-\n|2012\n|Matthew Stafford\n|\n| Detroit Lions\n| National Football League (NFL)\n|American football\n|-\n| 2013\n| Adrian Peterson\n|\n| Minnesota Vikings\n| National Football League (NFL)\n| American football\n|-\n| 2014\n| Russell Westbrook\n|\n| Oklahoma City Thunder\n| National Basketball Association (NBA)\n| Basketball\n|-\n| 2015\n| Rob Gronkowski\n|\n| New England Patriots\n| National Football League (NFL)\n| American football\n|-\n| 2016\n| Eric Berry\n|\n| Kansas City Chiefs\n| National Football League (NFL)\n| American football\n|-\n| 2017\n| Jordy Nelson\n|\n| Green Bay Packers\n| National Football League (NFL)\n| American football\n|-\n|2018\n| colspan=5 align=center|Not awarded\n|-\n| 2019\n| St. Louis Blues\n|\n| St. Louis Blues\n| National Hockey League (NHL)\n| Ice hockey\n|-\n| 2020\n| rowspan=2 colspan=5 style=\"text-align: center;\" | Not awarded due to the COVID-19 pandemic\n|-\n| 2021\n|-\n| 2022\n| Klay Thompson\n|\n| Golden State Warriors\n| National Basketball Association (NBA)\n| Basketball\n|-\n| 2023\n| Jamal Murray\n|\n| Denver Nuggets\n| National Basketball Association (NBA)\n| Basketball\n|-\n| 2024\n| Simone Biles\n|\n|\n|\n| Gymnastics\n|-\n| 2025\n| Sunisa Lee\n|\n|\n|\n| Gymnastics\n|}\nSee also\n*ATP Comeback Player of the Year Award\n*Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy (National Hockey League)\n*MLB Comeback Player of the Year Award, The Sporting News Comeback Player of the Year Award\n*MLS Comeback Player of the Year Award\n*NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award\n*WTA Comeback Player of the Year Award\nNotes\nReferences\n*"
