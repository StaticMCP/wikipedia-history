The archive is primarily serving municipalities of Požarevac, Žagubica, Kučevo, Golubac, Malo Crniće, Petrovac, and Veliko Gradište. The Historical Archives of Požarevac were established as an archival center in 1948, by the then City People's Committee of Požarevac. The archives hold and preserve 554 archival collections and funds amounting to about 5,000 linear meters of records, covering the period from the late 18th to the late 20th century.\nSee also\n* List of archives in Serbia\n* State Archives of Serbia\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://arhivpozarevac.org.rs/ Official website]"
