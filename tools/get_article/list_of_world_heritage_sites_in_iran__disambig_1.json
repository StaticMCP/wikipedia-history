Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Iran accepted the convention on 26 February 1975, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. , Iran has twenty-nine World Heritage Sites.\nThe first three sites in Iran, Meidan Naghshe Jahan, Isfahan, Persepolis and Tchogha Zanbil, were inscribed on the list at the 3rd Session of the World Heritage Committee, held in Cairo and Luxor, Egypt in 1979. They remained the Islamic Republic's only listed properties until 2003, when Takht-e Soleyman was added to the list. The latest addition was The Prehistoric Sites of the Khorramabad Valley, inscribed in 2025. In addition to its inscribed sites, Iran also lists 58 properties on its tentative list.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\"| Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\"| Location (province\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Armenian Monastic Ensembles of Iran\n|\n|West Azerbaijan province\n| 1262; ii, iii, vi (cultural)\n| align=\"center\" |2008\n|In Iran's northwest, the Armenian Monastic Ensembles, including St Thaddeus, St Stepanos, and the Chapel of Dzordzor, reflect Armenian Christian architectural brilliance since the 7th century.
