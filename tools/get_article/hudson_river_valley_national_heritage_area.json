It is one of 62 National Heritage Areas in the United States. It provides a unified promotional framework for a select number of the area's tourist attractions, with concentration on the area's architecture, history, landscape, artistic heritage and environment, as well as interpretation of the area's historical significance in the American Revolution, the Industrial Revolution and its continuing history through the present day. As of mid-2024, legislative efforts are underway to expand the boundaries of the Maurice D. Hinchey Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area to include Saratoga and Washington Counties. This proposal aims to recognize and preserve the historical and cultural significance of these additional regions within the heritage area.\nHistory\nThe Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area was designated in 1996.\nThe designated area includes Albany, Rensselaer, Columbia, Greene, Ulster, Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Westchester and Rockland counties, as well as the village of Waterford in Saratoga County.\nDesignated sites\nDesignated sites are organized by 3 themes: Freedom and Dignity, Nature and Culture and Corridor of Commerce.
