It reached number two on the Billboard charts, despite there being no US singles released from the album. (\"En El Agua\" was released as a B-side in the US but as an A-side in Great Britain).\nReception\n}}\nIn his Allmusic review, critic Bruce Eder called the album \"...a beautiful if relatively low-key selection of a dozen songs, mostly traditional tunes adapted by the group\" despite noting that the liveliest songs were misplaced on the album's track sequence.\"\nReissues\n* Make Way was reissued in 1992 on CD by Capitol with ''Goin' Places.\n*In 1997, all of the tracks from Make Way were included in The Guard Years 10-CD box set issued by Bear Family Records.\n* Make Way'' was reissued in 2001 by Collectors' Choice Music with ''Goin' Places''.
