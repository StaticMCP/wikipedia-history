However other USAAF support commands (Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); Air Transport Command (ATC); or Troop Carrier Command) had a significant number of airfields.\nIt is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as U.S. Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor Airfields in Idaho\n* Gowen Field, Boise\nAssigned to Second Air Force\n: 40th Air Base Squadron/40th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron, June 1941-1 April 1944 (See 212th AAFBU)\n: 42nd Bombardment Group (Medium), 3 June 1941-18 January 1942\n: 303rd Bombardment Group (Heavy), 11 February 1942-17 June 1942\n: 306th Bombardment Group (Heavy), 1 March 1942-6 April 1942\n: 308th Bombardment Group (Heavy), 15 April 1942-20 June 1942\n: Hq and Hq Sq, 15th Bombardment Wing, 23 June 1942-14 November 1942\n: 29th Bombardment Group (Heavy), 25 June 1942-1 April 1944 (See 212th AAFBU)\n: 96th Bombardment Group (Heavy), 6 August 1942-14 August 1942\n: 99th Bombardment Group (Heavy), 28 August 1942-30 September 1942\n: 100th Bombardment Group (Heavy), 28 August 1942-1 November 1942\n: 381st Bombardment Group (Heavy), 3 November 1942-1 December 1942\n: 384th Bombardment Group (Heavy), 1 December 1942-2 January 1943\n: 388th Bombardment Group (Heavy), 24 December 1942-1 February 1943\n: 393rd Bombardment Group (Heavy), 3 March 1943-3 April 1943\n: 445th Bombardment Group (Heavy), 1 April 1943-8 June 1943\n: 399th Bombardment Group (Heavy), 10 April 1943-27 April 1943\n: 448th Bombardment Group (Heavy), 1 May 1943-3 July 1943\n: 450th Bombardment Group (Heavy), 1 May 1943-21 May 1943\n: Hq and Hq Sq, 15th Bombardment Operational Training Wing, July 1943-May 1944\n: 456th Bombardment Group (Heavy), 14 July 1943-30 July 1943\n: 458th Bombardment Group (Heavy), 28 July 1943-11 September 1943\n: 461st Bombardment Group (Heavy), 29 July 1943-11 September 1943\n: 464th Bombardment Group (Heavy), 22 August 1943-2 October 1943\n: 500th Bombardment Group (Very Heavy), 20 November 1943-12 January 1944\n: 210th Army Air Force Base Unit (Hq, Combat Crew Training Wing), 1 April 1944-May 1944\n: 212th Army Air Force Base Unit (Combat Crew Training Station, Heavy), 1 April 1944-15 February 1945\nAssigned to Fourth Air Force:\n: 425th Army Air Force Base Unit (Combat Crew Training Station, Heavy), 15 February 1945-1 March 1946\n: Now: Boise Airport and  Gowen Field Air National Guard Base\n* Mountain Home Army Air Field, Mountain Home\nAssigned to Second Air Force:\n: 396th Bombardment Group (Heavy), 16 Feb 43-10 Apr 43\n: 470th Bombardment Group (Heavy), 1 May 43-5 Jan 44\n: 20th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron, 6 July 1943-1 April 1944 (See 213th AAFBU)\n: 490th Bombardment Group (Heavy), 4 December 1943-10 April 1944\n: 494th Bombardment Group (Heavy), 15 April 1944-1 June 1944\n: 213th Army Air Force Base Unit (Combat Crew Training Station, Heavy), 1 April 1944-15 February 1945\nAssigned to Fourth Air Force:\n: 426th Army Air Force Base Unit (Combat Crew Training Station, Heavy), 15 February 1945-20 October 1945\n: Now:   Mountain Home Air Force Base\n* Pocatello AAF, Pocatello\nAssigned to Second Air Force:\n: 382nd Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron, 30 October 1942-1 April 1944(See 265th AAFBU)\n: 96th Bombardment Group (Heavy), 30 October 1942-3 January 1943\n: 19th Bombardment Group (Heavy), 9 December 1942-1 January 1943\n: 382nd Bombardment Group (Heavy), 5 April 1943-6 December 1943\n: 453rd Bombardment Group (Heavy), 29 July 1943-30 September 1943\n: 464th Bombardment Group (Heavy), 2 October 1943-9 February 1944\n: 476th Fighter Group (Single Engine), 26 March 1944-1 April 1944 (See 265th AAFBU)\n: 265th Army Air Force Base Unit (Operational Training Unit, Fighter), 1 April 1944-15 November 1944\n: 508th Fighter Group (Single Engine), 25 October 1944-15 November 1944\n: Now: Pocatello Regional Airport\nReferences\n* Maurer, Maurer (1983).
