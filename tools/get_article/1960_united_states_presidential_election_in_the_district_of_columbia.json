Kennedy opted against competing in the D.C. primary was that he believed that Hubert Humphrey, a civil rights stalwart, would have a strong advantage with the district's predominantly African American electorate. Kennedy also viewed the District's primary as too inconsequential to allot resources to, as it had very few delegates to offer.\nHumphrey was challenged by Wayne Morse of Oregon, who saw the D.C. primary as a warm-up for the Oregon primary to be held later that month.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | District of Columbia  Democratic Presidential Primary Results – 1960\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic\n| Hubert Humphrey\n| align=\"right\" | 8,239\n| align=\"right\" | 57.4%\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic\n| Wayne Morse\n| align=\"right\" | 6,127\n| align=\"right\" | 42.6%\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Totals\n| align=\"right\" | 14,366\n| align=\"right\" | 100.00%\n|}\nRepublican primary\nNo candidates ran in the Republican primary, resulting in all votes being awarded to unbound delegates.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | District of Columbia Republican Presidential Primary Results – 1960\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#E81B23; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Republican\n| Unpledged delegates\n| align=\"right\" | 9,468\n| align=\"right\" | 100%\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#E9E9E9\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Totals\n| align=\"right\" | 9,468\n| align=\"right\" | 100.00%\n|}\nReferences"
