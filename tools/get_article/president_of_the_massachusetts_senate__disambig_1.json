      "text": "# President of the Massachusetts Senate__disambig_1\n\nThe president of the Massachusetts Senate is the presiding officer.  Unlike the United States Congress, in which the vice president of the United States is the ex officio president of the United States Senate, in Massachusetts, the president of the Senate is elected from and by the senators. The president, therefore, typically comes from the majority party, and the president is then the de facto leader of that party.\nThe current president of the Massachusetts Senate, since July 26, 2018, is Karen Spilka, a Democrat from Ashland. Democrats have had a majority in the Senate since 1959. Notable former presidents of the Massachusetts Senate include U.S. president Calvin Coolidge.\nList of presidents of the Massachusetts Senate\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|-\n! # !!
