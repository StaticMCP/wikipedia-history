It is a place of pilgrimage because the Krishna River, which considered sacred by Hindus, has its origin here along with five of its tributaries. The British colonial rulers developed the town as a hill station, and it served as the summer capital of the Bombay Presidency during the colonial rule.\nGeography\nMahabaleshwar is located on the mountainous Sahyadri range of the Western Ghats that run north to south along the western coast of India. The coordinates of the town are . Mahabaleshwar is a vast plateau measuring , bound by valleys on all sides. It reaches a height of  at its highest peak above sea level, known as Wilson/Sunrise Point. The town is about  southwest of Pune and  from Mumbai.\nMahabaleshwar comprises three villages: Malcolm Peth, Old \"Kshetra\" Mahabaleshwar, and part of the Shindola village. The Mahabaleshwar region is the source of the Krishna River, that flows east across Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh towards the Bay of Bengal. Three tributaries of Krishna, namely Koyna, Venna (Veni), and Gayatri, also have their source in Mahabaleshwar region. A fourth river, the Savitri, also has its source in the region, but flows Westward via Mahad, to the Arabian Sea.\nThe area's climate is suitable for the cultivation of strawberries; Mahabaleshwar strawberry contributes to about 85 percent of the total strawberry production in the country. It also received the Geographical Indication (GI) tag in 2010.\nPanoramic view of Mahabaleshwar\nClimate\nMahabaleshwar has a borderline tropical monsoon/humid subtropical climate (Köppen Am/Cwa). Very heavy rainfall is a normal occurrence during the monsoons. During July, 10–12 days of continuous rains, with  each day, occur each year. There were reports of ice and ground frost formation around Venna Lake in 2018. On August 7, 2019, Mahabaleshwar recorded  of rain in 24 hours, causing landslides. Mahabaleshwar has been described as the \"New Candidate for the wettest place in the world\", the title currently held by Cherrapunji.\n|source 2=Government of Maharashtra\n|date=May 2012\n}}\nHistory\nOn the outskirts of Mahabaleshwar, towards Panchgani.\nLegend says that a Yadava ruler from 13th century built a small temple and water tank at the source of the river Krishna. The Valley of Jawali, the area around Mahabaleshwar, was ruled by the More (clan) who were vassals of the Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur.\nIn 1656, the founder of Maratha empire, Chhatrapati Shivaji, killed the then ruler of Valley of Jawali, Chandrarao More, and seized the area. Around that time Shivaji also built a hill fort near Mahabaleshwar called Pratapgad fort.\nBritish colonial era\nIn 1819, after the demise of the Maratha empire, the British ceded the hills around Mahabaleshwar to the vassal state of Satara. Colonel Lodwick (Later General Sir Lodwick) after climbing the mountains near Mahabaleshwar, recommended the place as a sanatorium for the British forces to governor Sir John Malcolm of Bombay presidency. The Raja of Satara was granted other villages in exchange for the British getting Mahabaleshwar in 1828. In old records Mahabaleshwar was even called Malcolm Peth after the governor.\nMahabaleshwar started gaining prominence when British officials of the Bombay presidency such as Sir Mountstuart Elphinstone, Arthur Malet (for whom the seat at \"Point Arthur\" is named), Carnac, and many others became regular visitors.\nVenna Lake was constructed in 1842 to collect water from perennial springs; the Venna River flows from this lake. Bartley Frere, the commissioner of Satara in the 1850s, built the road from Satara to Mahabaleshwar. In the mid 1800s, Mahabaleshwar was made into the summer capital of the Bombay presidency. Government spending led to rapid development of the area.\nColonial officials spent part of their year in the area. Their wives spent a longer period of the year in the area to be with their children in local boarding schools in Mahabaleshwar and nearby Panchgani. The British rulers wanted to recreate the English landscape in the hill stations and to that end, European flora such as strawberries were introduced in Mahabaleshwar, and amenities such as libraries, theatres, boating lakes, and sports grounds were constructed.\nAdded to the scores of magnificent scenic \"points\", the perennial springs, streams, and waterfalls of Mahabaleshwar plateau, with its year round superb climate, drew the English and others to Mahabaleshwar. By the end of the 19th century, it had become an attractive popular hill station of world renown. Raj Bhavan, the summer residence of the Governor of Maharashtra, is also located here. An older building named \"The Terraces\" was purchased in 1884 and rechristened as Giri Darshan in 1886.\n\"Babington House\", is a colonial-style bungalow built in the shape of a cross with a deep veranda, elaborate metal work railing and extensive outhouses. It was formerly one of the country seats of the Dubash family, a Parsi ship chandler dynasty from Bombay, before they sold it to the Rahejas in the early 1970s. It contains a central dining room with a 24-seater table and a library pavilion with 1st edition books collected by the Dubash family, notably Jamsetjee \"Jimmy\" Kavasjee Dubash, a bibliophile and art collector.\nDemographics\nIndia census, Mahabaleshwar had a population of 12,737. Males constituted 55% of the population and females 45%.
