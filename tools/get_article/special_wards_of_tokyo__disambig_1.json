They are city-level wards: primary subdivisions of a prefecture with municipal autonomy. Together, they cover  and, as of 2024, house roughly 9.8 million residents, yielding a density of about . Similar ward systems are legally possible in other prefectures, but none have been established.\nTokyo's 23 special wards unite with 39 ordinary municipalities (cities, towns and villages) to their west to form Tokyo Metropolitan Prefecture. Without the ordinary municipalities the special wards account for what was the core Tokyo City, before this was abolished in 1943 under the Tōjō Cabinet. It was four years later, during the Occupation of Japan, that autonomy was restored to Tokyo City by means of the special wards, each being given a directly elected mayor and assembly like all other cities, towns and villages in Japan.\nIn Japanese the 23 are collectively also known as , , or less formally the  or just  if the context makes obvious that this does not refer to the whole prefecture. Most of Tokyo's prominent infrastructures are located within the special wards. Today, all wards refer to themselves as a city in English, but the Japanese designation of  remains unchanged. They are a group of 23 municipalities; there is no associated single government body separate from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, which governs all 62 municipalities of Tokyo, not just the special wards.\nAnalogues in other countries\nAnalogues exist in historic and contemporary Chinese and Korean administration: \"Special wards\" are city-independent wards, analogously, \"special cities/special cities\" (teukbyeol-si/tokubetsu-shi) are province-/prefecture-independent cities and were intended to be introduced under SCAP in Japan, too; but in Japan, implementation was stalled, and in 1956 special cities were replaced in the Local Autonomy Law with designated major cities which gain additional autonomy, but remain part of prefectures. In everyday English, Tokyo as a whole is also referred to as a city even though it contains 62 cities, towns, villages and special wards. The closest English equivalents for the special wards would be the London boroughs or New York City boroughs if Greater London and New York City had been abolished in the same way as Tokyo City, making the boroughs top-level divisions of England or New York state.\nDifferences from other municipalities\nAlthough special wards are autonomous from the Tokyo metropolitan government, they also function as a single urban entity in respect to certain public services, including water supply, sewage disposal, and fire services. These services are handled by the Tokyo metropolitan government, whereas cities would normally provide these services themselves. This situation is very similar to Brazil's Federal District and its 35 administrative regions, but with local elections. To finance the joint public services it provides to the 23 wards, the metropolitan government levies some of the taxes that would normally be levied by city governments, and also makes transfer payments to wards that cannot finance their own local administration.\nWaste disposal is handled by each ward under direction of the metropolitan government. For example, plastics were generally handled as non-burnable waste until the metropolitan government announced a plan to halt burying of plastic waste by 2010; as a result, about half of the special wards now treat plastics as burnable waste, while the other half mandate recycling of either all or some plastics.\nUnlike other municipalities (including the municipalities of western Tokyo), special wards were initially not considered to be local public entities for purposes of the Constitution of Japan. This means that they had no constitutional right to pass their own legislation, or to hold direct elections for mayors and councilors. While these authorities were granted by statute during the US-led occupation and again in 1975, they could be unilaterally revoked by the National Diet; similar measures against other municipalities would require a constitutional amendment. The denial of elected mayors to the special wards was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in the 1963 decision Japan v. Kobayashi et al. (also known as Tokyo Ward Autonomy Case).\nIn 1998, the National Diet passed a revision of the Local Autonomy Law (effective in the year 2000) that implemented the conclusions of the Final Report on the Tokyo Ward System Reform increasing their fiscal autonomy and established the wards as basic local public entities.\nHistory\nThe word \"special\" distinguishes them from the  of other major Japanese cities. Before 1943, the wards of Tokyo City were no different from the wards of Osaka or Kyoto. These original wards numbered 15 in 1889. Large areas from five surrounding districts were merged into the city in 1932 and organized in 20 new wards, bringing the total to 35; the expanded city was also referred to as . By this merger, together with smaller ones in 1920 and 1936, Tokyo City came to expand to the current city area.\n1943–1947\nOn March 15, 1943, as part of wartime totalitarian tightening of controls, Tokyo's local autonomy (elected council and mayor) under the Imperial municipal code was eliminated by the Tōjō cabinet and the Tokyo city government and (Home ministry appointed) prefectural government merged into a single (appointed) prefectural government; the wards were placed under the direct control of the prefecture.\n1947–2000\nThe 35 wards of the former city were integrated into 22 on March 15, 1947, just before the legal definition of special wards was given by the Local Autonomy Law, enforced on May 3 the same year. The 23rd ward, Nerima, was formed on August 1, 1947, when Itabashi was split again. The postwar reorganization under the US-led occupation authorities democratized the prefectural administrations but did not include the reinstitution of Tokyo City. Seiichirō Yasui, a former Home Ministry bureaucrat and appointed governor, won the first Tokyo gubernatorial election against Daikichirō Tagawa, a former Christian Socialist member of the Imperial Diet, former vice mayor of Tokyo city and advocate of Tokyo city's local autonomy.\nSince the 1970s, the special wards of Tokyo have exercised a considerably higher degree of autonomy than the administrative wards of cities (that unlike Tokyo City retained their elected mayors and assemblies) but still less than other municipalities in Tokyo or the rest of the country, making them less independent than cities, towns or villages, but more independent than city subdivisions. Today, each special ward has its own elected  and .\n2000–present\nIn 2000, the National Diet designated the special wards as , giving them a legal status similar to cities.\nThe wards vary greatly in area (from 10 to 60&nbsp;km2) and population (from less than 40,000 to 830,000), and some are expanding as artificial islands are built. Setagaya has the most people, while neighboring Ōta has the largest area.\nThe total population census of the 23 special wards had fallen under 8 million as the postwar economic boom moved people out to suburbs, and then rose as Japan's lengthy stagnation took its toll and property values drastically changed, making residential inner areas up to 10 times less costly than during peak values. Its population was 8,949,447 as of October 1, 2010, about two-thirds of the population of Tokyo and a quarter of the population of the Greater Tokyo Area.\nThe Mori Memorial Foundation put forth a proposal in 1999 to consolidate the 23 wards into six larger cities for efficiency purposes, and an agreement was reached between the metropolitan and special ward governments in 2006 to consider realignment of the wards, but there has been minimal further movement to change the current special ward system.\nIn other prefectures\nSpecial wards do not currently exist outside Tokyo; however, several Osaka area politicians, led by Governor Tōru Hashimoto, are backing an Osaka Metropolis plan under which the city of Osaka would be replaced by special wards, consolidating many government functions at the prefectural level and devolving other functions to more localized governments. Under a new 2012 law, – sometimes informally called \"Osaka Metropolis plan law\", but not specifically referring to Osaka – major cities and their surrounding municipalities in prefectures other than Tokyo may be replaced with special wards with similar functions if approved by the involved municipal and prefectural governments and ultimately the citizens of the dissolving municipalities in a referendum. Prerequisite is a population of at least 2 million in the dissolving municipalities; three cities (Yokohama, Nagoya and Osaka) meet this requirement on their own, seven other major city areas can set up special wards if a designated city is joined by neighboring municipalities. However,  where special wards are set up cannot style themselves  as the Local Autonomy Law only allows Tokyo with that status. In Osaka, a 2015 referendum to replace the city with five special wards was defeated narrowly.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Postwar local government structure of Japan\n|-\n! Level !! Executive !!

It is next to Roppongi, Nagatachō, and Aoyama.\n; Akihabara: A densely arranged shopping district popular for electronics, anime culture, amusement arcades, and otaku goods.\n; Aoyama: A neighborhood of Tokyo adjacent to Omotesando with parks, trendy cafes, and international restaurants.\n; Asakusa: A cultural center of Tokyo, famous for the Sensō-ji Buddhist temple, and several traditional shopping streets. For most of the twentieth century, Asakusa was the main entertainment district in Tokyo, with large theaters, cinemas, an amusement park and a red light district. The area was heavily damaged by US bombing raids during World War II, and has now been rivaled by newer districts in the west of the city as entertainment and commercial centers.\n; Ginza and Yūrakuchō: Major shopping and entertainment district with historic department stores, upscale shops selling brand-name goods, and movie theaters. This area is part of the original city center in the wards of Chuo and Chiyoda (as opposed to the new centers in Shinjuku, Ikebukuro, and Shibuya).\n; Harajuku: Known internationally for its role in Japanese street fashion.\n; Ikebukuro: The busiest interchange in north central Tokyo, featuring Sunshine City and various shopping destinations.\n; Jinbōchō: Often referred to as \"Book Town,\" Tokyo's center of used-book stores and publishing houses, and a popular antique and curio shopping area.\n; Kasumigaseki: Home to most of the executive offices of the national government, as well as the Tokyo Metropolitan Police.\n; Marunouchi and Ōtemachi: As one of the main financial and business districts of Tokyo, Marunouchi includes the headquarters of many banks, trading companies, and other major corporations. The area is seeing a major redevelopment in the near future with plans for new buildings and skyscrapers for shopping and entertainment constructed on the Marunouchi side of Tokyo Station. This area is part of the original city center in the wards of Chuo and Chiyoda (as opposed to the new centers in Shinjuku, Ikebukuro, and Shibuya).\n; Nagatachō: The political heart of Tokyo and the nation. It is the location of the National Diet (parliament), government ministries, and party headquarters.\n; Odaiba: A large, reclaimed, waterfront area that has become one of Tokyo's most popular shopping and entertainment districts. It resides on a man-made island.\n; Omotesandō: Known for upscale shopping, fashion, and design.\n; Roppongi: Home to the rich Roppongi Hills area, Mori Tower, an active night club scene, and a relatively large presence of Western tourists and expatriates.\n; Ryōgoku: The heart of the sumo world. Home to the Ryōgoku Kokugikan and many sumo stables.\n; Shibuya: A long-time center of shopping, fashion, nightlife, and youth culture. Shibuya is a famous and popular location for photographers and tourists.\n; Shinagawa:In addition to the major hotels on the west side of Shinagawa Station, the former \"sleepy east side of the station\" has been redeveloped as a major center for business. Shinagawa station is in Minato-ku, not in Shinagawa-ku.\n; Shinbashi: A traditional Shitamachi district. Revitalization of it being the gateway to Odaiba and the Shiodome Shiosite complex of high-rise buildings began in 2016, and was completed in 2018.\n; Shinjuku: Location of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, and a major secondary center of Tokyo (fukutoshin), as opposed to the original center in Marunouchi and Ginza. The area is known for its concentration of skyscrapers and shopping areas. Major department stores, electronics stores and hotels are located here. On the east side of Shinjuku Station, Kabukichō is known for its many bars and nightclubs. Shinjuku Station moves an estimated three million passengers a day, which makes it the busiest rail station in the world.\n; Ueno: Ueno is known for its parks, department stores, and large concentration of cultural institutions. Ueno Zoo and Ueno Park are located here. Ueno Station is a major transportation hub serving commuters to and from areas north and east of Tokyo. In the spring, the area is a popular locale to view cherry blossoms.\nSee also\n* Administrative division\n* Capital of Japan\n* List of cities in Japan\n* Special cities of Japan\n* Urban area\n* Wards of Japan\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*  - [https://www.toshiseibi.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/keikaku_chousa_singikai/ayumi_english.html From The Changing Face of Tokyo: From Edo to Today, and into the Future].
