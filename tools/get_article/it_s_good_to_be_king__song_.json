It peaked at No. 68 on the Billboard Hot 100, and No. 6 on the Billboard'' Mainstream Rock chart.\nReview\nOn AllMusic, reviewer Matthew Greenwald wrote about the song, \"One if [sic] the most self-effacing and personal songs to reach the Top Ten charts in the 1990s, \"It's Good to Be King\" deals with the phenomenon of rock & roll stardom.\" He described the song's melody as \"elegant and folk-rock-ish\", and \"buttressed\" by a Michael Kamen string arrangement that he described as \"absolutely stunning\".\nPersonnel\n* Tom Petty – lead & harmony vocals, electric guitar\n* Mike Campbell – electric & bass guitar\n* Benmont Tench – piano\n* Howie Epstein – harmony vocals\n* Steve Ferrone – drums\nAdditional musicians\n* Lenny Castro – percussion\n* Michael Kamen – orchestration, conductor\nReferences"
