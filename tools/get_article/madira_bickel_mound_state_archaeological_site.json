It is located on Bayshore Drive, west of U.S. 19, a mile south of I-275. On August 12, 1970, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. It is also a Florida State Park.\nThe  site was the first Native American location in Florida to be designated as a State Archaeological Site.\nHistory\nArchaeological excavations have established that indigenous occupation reaches back 2,000 years, and across three distinct periods: Manasota, Weedon Island, and Safety Harbor cultures. The people constructed a massive earthwork temple/ceremonial mound from shells, sand and detritus.  It is still  high, with a base nearly 100 by .\nScholars believe that the mound site continued to be of great ceremonial importance to the historic Tocobaga Indians of the surrounding area, who coalesced as a people before European encounter in the late sixteenth century. They survived into the eighteenth century but disappeared as a tribe due to infectious diseases and warfare.\nThe site is named for Madira Bickel of Sarasota. She and her husband, Karl, purchased the land around the main mound and donated it to the state in 1948.\nThe mounds\nThe point of greatest interest at the site is the  high temple/ceremonial mound. Composed of shells (obtained from a midden to the west), sand, and detritus, the mound's base is  by . To more easily reach the top, the Tocobaga constructed a curved  wide ramp on the western side.\nThe state park has graduated stairways for access, and at the top, has cleared an area (protected by a fence) for overlooking the park. Over the centuries, the mound has become covered with vegetation, including tall trees.\nAlso in the park are the remains of the Prine Burial Mound, which is circular, about  wide, and about  high at the center. It was used through the three major archaeological cultures described above, from 800-1500 AD. Since settlement and development, much of the mound's contents have been disturbed.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.floridastateparks.org/parks-and-trails/madira-bickel-mound-state-archaeological-site Madira Bickel Mounds State Archaeological Site] at [https://www.floridastateparks.org Florida State Parks]\n* [http://www.flheritage.com/facts/reports/places/Counties/Manatee.cfm Manatee County listings],  Florida's Office of Cultural and Historical Programs\n* [http://www.manatee.k12.fl.us/sites/mclt/mclandt/archaeology/indianmounds/resources/madirabickeltemplemound.html \"Madira Bickel Temple Mound Site\"], School District of Manatee County\n* [http://fcit.usf.edu/Florida/photos/native/bickel/bickel.htm Madira Bickel Mound Photograph Gallery], Florida Center for Instructional Technology, University of South Florida"
