      "text": "# There Is Some Fun Going Forward\n\nThere is Some Fun Going Forward is the only sampler album released by John Peel's Dandelion Records label, and was marketed by Polydor. As one might expect from Peel, the artists featured were not necessarily mainstream, and in fact, the only artists featured who enjoyed chart success are Clifford T. Ward and Medicine Head. The sleeve featured a photo of Peel in the bath with a naked (or at least visibly topless) woman. It was re-released in 1995 by See For Miles as a CD with extra tracks.\nTrack listing\nSide One\nSide Two\nExtra tracks on CD rerelease\nReferences\n*[http://www.trevormidgley.com/Dandelion.html Full discography with rereleases]\n*[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0000086S9 Amazon listing]\n*[http://www.bsnpubs.com/elektra/dandelion.html Elektra connection]\n\n---\n\n## There is Some Fun Going Forward\n\n#REDIRECT There Is Some Fun Going Forward"
