The team was led by tennis star William Clothier and won its first game against the Bala Cricket Club on January 5. Though two losses followed, including a rematch with Bala, the team was able to claim the city championship when it defeated Penn in mid-February. The team ended its largely successful season with a loss to Cornell at the end of the month.\nWhile there was enough support for the program to continue, the West Park Ice Palace burned down after the season. Without a nearby rink, the team would have been forced to travel to New York City to play games and the athletic department could not afford those travel costs. The hockey team was mothballed afterwards and remains dormant more than 120 years later.\nThe team did not have a head coach but Nathan H. Mannakee served as team manager.\nRoster\nStandings\nSchedule and results\n|-\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season'''\nReferences"
