All books published in the series are derived from recent doctoral (D.Phil) theses submitted at the  University of Oxford.\nSince the series received its current name in 1965, over 250 titles have been published. Works are selected by a committee drawn from the university's History Faculty. About 10 percent of theses drawn to their attention are chosen for publication, resulting in 6 to 8 books being published per annum.\nCommittee\nThe Oxford Historical Monographs Committee is the series' editorial board and is composed of postholders in the History Faculty at the University of Oxford. It meets four times each year to consider examiners' reports and conduct other business. The committee is intended to represent as wide a range of period and thematic interests as possible. The current (2024) composition of the committee is:\n* David Parrott (New College; chair)\n* Paul Betts (St Antony's College)\n* Faisal Devji (St Antony's College)\n* Perry Gauci (Lincoln College)\n* Katherine Lebow (Christ Church)\n* James McDougall (Trinity College)\n* Richard Reid (St Cross College)\n* Hannah Skoda (St John's College)\n* Julia Smith (All Souls College)\n* William Whyte (St John's College)\nList of publications\nBelow is a list of all Oxford Historical Monographs publications in the Oxford University Press catalogue.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
