It is one of the species of Haworthiopsis that is commonly cultivated as an ornamental.\nDescription\nIt is a perennial succulent, with stems growing to  in height, with a basal rosette of white-spotted fleshy leaves arranged in a spiral pattern, and racemes of tubular pinkish-white flowers in spring. The plant spreads to form a mat, by means of freely-produced offsets, also a convenient means of propagation.\nIt is frequently confused with Haworthiopsis coarctata – a closely related species which occurs just to the west of this species' natural range and looks very similar. However H.&nbsp;reinwardtii has larger, flatter and whiter tubercles on its leaves (those of H. coarctata are smaller, smoother and rounder). H.&nbsp;reinwardtii also has thinner, narrower leaves.\nVarieties\nThis variable species has a large number of recognised varieties, some of which are depicted below:\nFile:Haworthia reinwardtii var chalumna - Robertson RSA.jpg|The Chalumnensis variety (\"chalumna\")\nFile:Haworthia reinwardtii var wesleyensis - Robertson RSA.jpg|The Wesleyensis variety\nFile:Haworthia reinwardtii forma kaffirdriftensis Cacti.jpg|The Kaffirdriftensis variety\nFile:Haworthia reinwardtii forma zebrina 2.jpg|The Zebrina variety\nFile:Haworthia reinwardtii var olivacea 2.jpg|The Olivacea variety\nCultivation\nH. reinwardtii requires very well-drained soil and some exposure to sun. It does not tolerate prolonged exposure to temperatures below , so in temperate regions it must be grown under glass with heat. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\nReferences\n}}\n*(Salm-Dyck) Haw., Saxifrag. Enum. 2: 53 (1821)."
