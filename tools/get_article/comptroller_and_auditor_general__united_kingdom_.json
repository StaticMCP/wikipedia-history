The C&AG is an officer of the House of Commons who is the head of the National Audit Office, the body that scrutinises central government expenditure.\nUnder the Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011 the C&AG is appointed by the monarch by letters patent upon an address of the House of Commons presented by the Prime Minister with the agreement of the Chair of the Public Accounts Committee. The C&AG can be removed from office, also by the monarch, only upon an address of both Houses of Parliament.\nThe full title of the office is ''Comptroller General of the Receipt and Issue of His Majesty's Exchequer and Auditor General of Public Accounts''.\nThe current C&AG is Gareth Davies (not the MP).\nHistory\nThe office of C&AG was created by the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866, which combined the functions of the Comptroller General of the Exchequer, who had authorised the issue of public moneys from the Treasury to other government departments, with those of the Commissioners of Audit, who had presented the government accounts to the Treasury). Under the terms of the Act the C&AG continued to authorise the issue of money to departments, but was also given the new task of examining departmental accounts and reporting the results to Parliament. The role has since been replicated in many Commonwealth and foreign countries.\nList of comptrollers and auditors general\n* 1867 - Sir William Dunbar, 7th Baronet\n* 1888 - Sir Charles Lister Ryan\n* 1896 - Richard Mills\n* 1900 - Douglas Close  Richmond\n* 1904 - Sir John Arrow Kempe\n* 1911 - Sir Henry James Gibson\n* 1921 - Sir Malcolm Graham Ramsay\n* 1931 - Sir Gilbert Charles Upcott\n* 1946 - Sir Frank Newton Tribe\n* 1958 - Sir Edmund Compton\n* 1966 - Sir Bruce Fraser\n* 1971 - Sir David Pitblado\n* 1976 - Sir Douglas Henley\n* 1981 - Sir Gordon Downey\n* 1988 - Sir John Bourn\n* 2008 - Tim Burr\n* 2009 - Sir Amyas Morse\n* 2019 - Gareth Davies\nDevolved administrations\nWales\nThe Auditor General for Wales is the public official in charge of Audit Wales, the body responsible for auditing the Welsh Government and £20 billion of taxpayers' money each year.
