Selover reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \"Despite the tremendous sweep of the maneuvers during the first year, Korea has never been a \"pretty\" war and has always been seriously under-represented in wargaming. This alone makes MacArthur's War'' almost a \"must\". That the game is a darn good simulation, is easy to learn, and gives you a real feeling for the capabilities and operational limitations of both sides is just an added bonus.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
