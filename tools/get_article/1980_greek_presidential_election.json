Karamanlis resigned as prime minister to stand for the presidency, being succeeded as prime minister by Georgios Rallis.\nSeveral candidates were put forward by minor parties alongside Karamanlis, including Georgios Mylonas (KODISO), Leonidas Kyrkos (KKE Interior), Ioannis Zigdis (EDIK), Stelios Papathemelis, Ilias Iliou and Faidon Vegleris (United Democratic Left). Karamanlis received 179 votes and 180 votes in the first and second ballot respectively, and was elected on the third ballot with 183 votes, i.e., the 175 MPs of New Democracy as well as eight independent MPs and MPs from minor parties.\nResults\n|party4=United Democratic Left|votes4=1|votes4_2=1|votes4_3=1\n|cand5=Nikitas Venizelos|party5=Union of the Democratic Centre|votes5=3\n|cand6=Ilias Iliou|party6=United Democratic Left|votes6=1\n|cand7=Stelios Papathemelis|party7=Independent|votes7_2=1\n|cand8=|party8=Union of the Democratic Centre|votes8=–|votes8_2=–|votes8_3=4\n|invalid=15|invalid2=13|invalid3=12\n|electorate=300|electorate2=300|electorate3=300\n}}\nReferences"
