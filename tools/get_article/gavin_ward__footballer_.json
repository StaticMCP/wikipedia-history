He notably played Premier League football for Leicester City as well as playing for Aston Villa, Shrewsbury Town, West Bromwich Albion, Cardiff City, Bradford City, Bolton Wanderers, Burnley, Stoke City, Walsall, Coventry City, Barnsley, Preston North End, Tranmere Rovers, Chester City, Wrexham, Hednesford Town and Gainsborough Trinity.\nPlaying career\nWard was born in Sutton Coldfield and began his career with Aston Villa before moving on to Shrewsbury Town. He failed to make an appearance for either club and left for West Bromwich Albion where he made his professional debut in a League Cup match against Bradford City. He then moved to Cardiff City where he finally found regular football becoming a regular in the 1991–92 season and helped the \"Bluebirds\" win the Division Three title in 1992–93.\nHe made over 60 league and cup appearances for Cardiff in four seasons before moving to Leicester City for a transfer fee of £175,000 in 1993 where he help them to win promotion to the Premier League in 1994. After leaving Leicester he had a short spell at Bradford City before Bolton Wanderers paid £300,000 for his services in 1996, allowing Ward to again taste top-flight action. He spent three seasons at the Reebok Stadium acting as back-up to Keith Branagan. He spent the first half of the 1998–99 season on loan at Burnley before joining Stoke City on a permanent basis in March 1998. He instantly established himself as first choice at the Britannia Stadium and he played in all 60 of the club's fixtures during a hectic 1999–2000 season which saw Stoke win the Football League Trophy and reach the play-offs as Stoke lost controversially to Gillingham. He was second choice at Stoke in 2000–01 and 2001–02 and joined Walsall in the summer of 2002.\nAfter spells at Walsall, Coventry City, Barnsley and Preston North End he joined Tranmere Rovers in June 2006. Ward made a bright start to the 2006–07, even managing to score a goal, which came from a free kick just outside his box in the 9th minute against Leyton Orient on 2 September 2006.\nHe was released by Tranmere in May 2007 and made the short journey to Chester, where he was backup and coach to John Danby. Ward's only competitive appearance for Chester was as a half-time substitute for the injured Danby against Crewe Alexandra in the Football League Trophy on 4 September 2007, with Chester going on to win a penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 draw. On 8 January 2008, Ward moved to arch-rivals Wrexham on a free transfer. He played in over 50 matches for the club before being released at the end of the 2008–09 season. Ward went on to play for Hednesford Town during the 2008–09 season.\nCoaching career\ngame in January 2010.]]\nFollowing the appointment of Brian Little as manager of Gainsborough Trinity, Ward was appointed Assistant Manager, as well as signing on as the club's reserve goalkeeper.\nWard retired from playing at the end of the 2010–11 season. On 18 July 2011, he left his post at Gainsborough to become Goalkeeping Coach at Shrewsbury Town. He was registered as a player after second-choice goalkeeper Joe Anyon picked up an injury in October 2012, with Ward taking his place on the bench.\nOn 4 July 2013, Ward agreed to be Goalkeeping Coach at Nottingham Forest.\nOn 27 September 2024, Ward agreed to be interim Goalkeeping Coach at Cardiff City following an eight-year stint at Queens Park Rangers.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|League Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Other\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|Aston Villa\n|1987–88\n|Second Division\n|0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0\n|-\n|Shrewsbury Town\n|1988–89\n|Second Division\n|0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0\n|-\n||West Bromwich Albion\n|1989–90\n|Second Division\n|0||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||1||0\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|Cardiff City\n|1989–90\n|Third Division\n|2||0||0||0||0||0||2||0||4||0\n|-\n|1990–91\n|Fourth Division\n|1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0\n|-\n|1991–92\n|Fourth Division\n|24||0||0||0||0||0||2||0||26||0\n|-\n|1992–93\n|Third Division\n|32||0||1||0||0||0||3||0||35||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!59!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!7!!0!!67!!0\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Leicester City\n|1993–94\n|First Division\n|32||0||0||0||3||0||4||0||39||0\n|-\n|1994–95\n|Premier League\n|6||0||1||0||0||0||0||0||7||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!38!!0!!1!!0!!3!!0!!4!!0!!45!!0\n|-\n|Bradford City\n|1995–96\n|Second Division\n|36||0||3||0||6||0||1||0||46||0\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Bolton Wanderers\n|1995–96\n|Premier League\n|5||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||5||0\n|-\n|1996–97\n|First Division\n|11||0||3||0||1||0||0||0||15||0\n|-\n|1997–98\n|Premier League\n|6||0||1||0||1||0||0||0||8||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!22!!0!!4!!0!!2!!0!!0!!0!!28!!0\n|-\n|Burnley (loan)\n|1998–99\n|Second Division\n|17||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||17||0\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|Stoke City\n|1998–99\n|Second Division\n|6||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||6||0\n|-\n|1999–2000\n|Second Division\n|46||0||1||0||4||0||9||0||60||0\n|-\n|2000–01\n|Second Division\n|17||0||0||0||3||0||2||0||22||0\n|-\n|2001–02\n|Second Division\n|10||0||1||0||0||0||1||0||12||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!79!!0!!2!!0!!7!!0!!12!!0!!100!!0\n|-\n|Walsall\n|2002–03\n|First Division\n|7||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||7||0\n|-\n|Coventry City\n|2003–04\n|First Division\n|12||0||3||0||0||0||0||0||15||0\n|-\n|Barnsley (loan)\n|2003–04\n|Second Division\n|1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Preston North End\n|2004–05\n|Championship\n|7||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||8||0\n|-\n|2005–06\n|Championship\n|0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0\n|-\n|Tranmere Rovers\n|2006–07\n|League One\n|38||1||1||0||1||0||0||0||41||1\n|-\n|Chester City\n|2007–08\n|League One\n|0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0||1||0\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Wrexham\n|2007–08\n|League Two\n|22||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||22||0\n|-\n|2008–09\n|Conference Premier\n|32||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||3||0||35||0\n|-\n!colspan=2|Total\n!54!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!3!!0!!57!!0\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|Career Total\n!370!!1!!15!!0!!21!!0!!28!!0!!434!!1\n|}\n:A.&nbsp; The \"Other\" column constitutes appearances and goals in the Anglo-Italian Cup, Football League play-offs and Football League Trophy.\nHonours\nCardiff City\n*Football League Third Division: 1992–93\n[[Welsh Cup winner] 1992-93]]\nBolton Wanderers\n*Football League First Division: 1996–97\nLeicester City\n*Football League First Division play-offs: 1994\nStoke City\n*Football League Trophy: 1999–2000\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
