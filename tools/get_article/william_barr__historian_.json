He has published 16 books, including translations from French, German, and Russian. In 2006, William Barr received a Lifetime Achievement Award for his contributions to the recorded history of the Canadian North from the Canadian Historical Association.\nMost of the titles of his works show that William Barr is an admirer of Russian Arctic explorers.
