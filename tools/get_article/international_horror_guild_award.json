Nomination suggestions were accepted from the public. The annual awards were usually announced during a special presentation at a convention or other event, and IHG Award presentations have been held at the World Fantasy Convention, the World Horror Convention and Dragon*Con.\nOriginally in the form of a \"winged dog gargoyle\" figure on a base, in 2002 the IHG Award was redesigned as a black, tombstone-shaped and free-standing plaque. The Living Legend Award had the same design, but in clear acrylic.\nPresentations\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Award year\n! Presentation date\n! Event\n! City\n! Location\n!
