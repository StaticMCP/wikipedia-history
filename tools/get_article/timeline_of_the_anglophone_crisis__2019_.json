In Mbelenka, Lebialem, three gendarmes were wounded in a separatist attack. In Widikum, Momo Division, an Ambazonian general was killed when security forces raided a separatist camp. Government forces claimed that 17 separatists were killed during the raid, while the separatists claimed that the general was the sole loss.

In Bole-Bakundu, Mbonge, at least 15 civilians were killed when the army moved against separatists, most of whom managed to escape. In Widikum, separatists attacked a military brigade, wounding five soldiers.

The separatists claimed to have killed more soldiers.\n*On February 11, Youth Day celebrations had negligible turnout in the Anglophone regions, the Interim Government of Ambazonia having declared a lockdown in advance. In Bamenda, the Governor of Northwest Region, Adolph Lele l’Afrique, was escorted by soldiers to attend a small celebration. The military escort came under fire while driving to the ceremony, possibly resulting in casualties. The celebrations were boycotted in most major cities in the Anglophone regions, including Buea, Kumbo, Belo, Ndop, Ndu, Wum, Muyuka, Mamfe, Tombem, Mundemba and Lebialem, while there was a comparatively significant turnout in Nkambe. In Kumba, unidentified arsonists put a hospital on fire, leading to the death of at least four people.

However, the Ambazonia Self-Defence Council, the armed wing of the Interim Government, declared that the SCLC had no authority to call off the lockdown.

He was released shortly afterwards, and the SDF claimed that the whole affair owed to a \"misunderstanding\" that was quickly solved.  The next day, a video of John Fru Ndi conversing with his captors surfaced online, shedding light upon the purpose of the abduction. In the video, the gunmen asked the SDF leader to withdraw all SDF legislators from the National Assembly and the senate. Fru Ndi replied that he would not, stating that it would be counterproductive to boycott the only forum where they could talk to President Biya. Fru Ndi had travelled to Kumbo to attend the funeral of Joseph Banadzem, the Parliamentary group leader of the SDF. Local separatist fighters had consented to the funeral taking place, provided that no Francophone Cameroonians attended it. In Yaoundé, the ten detained members of the Interim Government of Ambazonia announced that they would start boycotting court sessions.\n*On April 30, the Divisional Officer of Ndu threatened to dismiss civil servants who had fled from the town.

The document expressed appreciation of the job the Sako-led cabinet had done since February 2018, but stressed that infighting had rendered it unfit to continue; the caretaker cabinet has lost the ability to reconcile our people and, in doing so, has imperiled  the identity  and mission of the interim government to complete the decolonization of Southern Cameroons through advancing  our collective  national interests. The Sako-led cabinet refused to step down, triggering the Ambazonian leadership crisis.\n*On May 4, Cameroonian soldiers killed two civilians in Wowo village, Ndu. The army later claimed they had been mistaken for separatist fighters.\n*On May 5, following appeals by the European Union Parliament, it was announced that the Anglophone Crisis would be debated at the United Nations Security Council. The original proposal was for a formal debate to be held; however, due to objections from non-permanent member South Africa, there would only be informal talks. South Africa and other African countries opposed in principle the involvement of the UN in the Anglophone Crisis, preferring that the African Union should handle it instead. In Bakassi, it was reported that Cameroonian gendarmes had destroyed the fishing community of Abana. According to locals who escaped, at least 40 people had been killed. The authorities denied that gendarmes had been involved, and blamed a local militia. According to the state government, Cameroonian soldiers subsequently moved into Abana and arrested 15 people suspected of having participated in the killings. In Ndu, Cameroonian soldiers invaded separatist bases in the villages of Ntamruh and Ntayi, but the separatists had already withdrawn. The soldiers subsequently burned down 42 houses and killed at least seven people. 400 cows were also missing after the attack.\n*On May 6, a video emerged online where three women had been tortured by separatist fighters in Bamenda, apparently for taking part in Labour Day celebrations on May 1.

The separatists had previously announced that there would be a lockdown on National Day on May 20.\n*On May 9, Cameroonian Prime Minister Joseph Ngute embarked on a trip to the Anglophone regions.

While separatists claimed responsibility, reports indicated a technical fault.\n*On May 14, an informal discussion was held at the UN Security Council. While France, Belgium, Equatorial Guinea and the Ivory Coast expressed support for the peace efforts of the Cameroonian government, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, South Africa, India, Russia, Poland, Kuwait, Peru and the Dominican Republic criticized it for not doing enough and for violating human rights. China took a position of neutrality.\n*On May 15, separatist fighters killed at least two government soldiers in Bamenda. Cameroonian soldiers responded with a crackdown, burning several houses, a church and health centre in the process. The owners of those houses were offered compensation by the Cameroonian government.

Due to concerns about the Archbishop's safety, he had to spend a night with his captors and was only able to return to Bamenda the following day. He had spent a total of 12 hours with the separatists.

Unlike the first incident, this time Fru Ndi was subjected to beating, insults and rough treatment. The separatists demanded that he declare on video that he would recall all SDF senators and mayors within 24 hours. Fru Ndi refused to do so at gunpoint, and instead promised to discuss things with the politicians and get back to the separatists. The abductors complained that he had never visited them before, to which he replied that he had never been invited. In the end, he was forced to be photographed with the Ambazonian flag, before being driven back to his home at night.

Security forces moved in to regain control, firing shots in the air and using tear gas on the inmates. Several prisoners were injured in the quelling of the riot, which was also broadcast live on Facebook by participants. Following the incident, Amnesty International called on Cameroon to improve the prison conditions in Kondengui, and to allow an independent investigation of the crackdown on the riot. More than 100 inmates were moved to undisclosed locations for detention, and there were speculations that some had been killed during the riot.

The amount of respect for these lockdowns was expected to reveal which government held the most influence on the ground.\n*On August 15, at least seven soldiers from the Rapid Intervention Battalion were injured when their vehicle skidded off the road in Kumba. The soldiers sustained anything from minor and life-threatening injuries, and were promptly transported to a hospital. Separatists claimed responsibility for the incident, claiming that the vehicle had hit an improvised explosive device; however, the Cameroonian Army claimed it was simply a road accident. Separatist fighters had attacked the vehicle when it passed through Muyuka earlier the same day. Outside Bali, a police officer was mortally wounded in a separatist ambush, and died later in a hospital. A soldier was also killed in Muyuka.
