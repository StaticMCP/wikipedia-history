In 2022, they signed to Universal Music Group Nashville, and released their major label debut, ''Lover's Game (2023). Their collaboration with Zach Bryan on the song \"Hey Driver\" made the top 20 on the Billboard'' Hot 100.\nIn 2023, the War and Treaty became the first Black duo to be nominated for the Country Music Association Award for Duo of the Year; along with being the first Black duo to be nominated for the Academy of Country Music Award for Duo of the Year. The duo was nominated for \"Vocal Duo of the Year\" for the CMA Awards in 2024 and received an Emmy for their work with the NFL's Tennessee Titans in 2025.\nThey have received two nominations for the 66th Annual Grammy Awards including Best New Artist. An upcoming biopic based on the group’s life is set to be released.\nCareer\nIn 2016, Michael Trotter Jr. and Tanya Blount released the duet album Love Affair as Trotter & Blount. In 2017, the War and Treaty released the EP Down to the River, said to be a mix of \"blues, gospel, soul, bluegrass, and country\" and commended by Estey as \"a splendidly made immediate classic about conflict and redemption.\" According to Estey, \"the two can sensually help heal the wounds from those confessional blasts with a sweet ballad like \"Till The Mornin’\"—they truly live up to the dynamic tension of their moniker.\"\nIn 2018, Rolling Stone reported that the War and Treaty's debut album Healing Tide would be released on August 10, 2018, saying that the lead single is a 'joyfully relentless title track, reminiscent of classic Ike and Tina Turner rock-infused soul'. On September 25, 2020, the War and Treaty released a second album, Hearts Town, on Rounder Records. On April 18, 2021, the duo joined Dierks Bentley for a performance of U2's \"Pride (In the Name of Love)\" at the 56th Academy of Country Music Awards.\nThe duo signed a major label deal with Mercury Nashville Records/UMG Nashville in May 2022. They performed a cover of \"It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)\" alongside the Brothers Osborne at the 56th Annual Country Music Association Awards on November 9, 2022, and as a surprise, released their second EP Blank Page on the same day. The War and Treaty's major label debut album ''Lover's Gamecame out on March 10, 2023. The duo collaborated with Zach Bryan on the track \"Hey, Driver\" on his self-titled fourth studio album. The song debuted at number 14 on the Billboard'' Hot 100, marking the duo's first appearance on the chart.\nPersonal\nFrom 2003 to 2007, Michael served in the United States Army. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division. He served in Iraq and Germany and was a private first class.\nDuring deployment, his unit stayed at a private palace of Saddam Hussein which had a piano in the basement. Michael learned how to play piano when his company commander, Captain Robert Scheetz, encouraged him to do so, knowing that he had a passion for singing. Scheetz was killed on a mission shortly afterwards. Michael wrote his first song in Scheetz's honor and sang it at his memorial. He began performing at the services of other fallen soldiers. The duo performed and endorsed Kamala Harris for president on Saturday, November 2, 2024, at a campaign rally in Charlotte, North Carolina.\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n|+ List of albums, with selected chart positions\n|-\n!
