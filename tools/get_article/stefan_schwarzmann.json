Schwarzmann joined Helloween as a replacement for departing drummer Mark Cross in 2003. Although Stefan got on well with the members of the band, he had other musical preferences. As a result, he chose to leave Helloween after the Rabbits on the Run Tour in early 2005.\nIn 2012, Schwarzmann and guitarist Mille Petrozza were contracted to record the album Revolution with Lacrimosa.\nEquipment\nSchwarzmann currently endorses Pearl drums, Aquarian drumheads, Wincent drumsticks, and Paiste cymbals:\n* Signature 18\" heavy china\n* Signature 14\" sound edge hi-hats\n* Signature 19\" full crash\n* Signature 20\" full crash\n* 2002 20\" crash\n* Signature Dark Energy Mark l 20\" dark dry ride\n* 2002 14\" sound edge hi-hats\n* 2002 20\" novo china\n* Signature reflector 22\" heavy full rash\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
