In the , Amamoor Creek had a population of 56 people.\nGeography\nThe locality is roughly bounded to the south by the Amamoor Range, to the west by the Coast Range, and to the north by an unnamed ridgeline and the Ward Range.\nAmamoor Creek has the following peaks along its northern boundary (from west to east):\n* Tewoo Rock ()\n* Mount Tewoo ()\n* Mount Wilwarrel ()\n*Little Baldy ()\nMost of the east of the locality is within the Amamoor State Forest (). The west of the locality is within Wrattens National Park (). The land use in the middle of the locality is predominantly grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nAmamoor Creek was named and bounded on 1 December 2000. Amamoor was the name of a pastoral run in the rea held by J.D. McTaggart in the late 1850s.\nAmamoor State Forest was declared on 1 January 1980 under the Forestry Act 1959.\nIn January 1982 the Webb Brothers (Fabian, Marius and Berard) won a Golden Guitar Award at the Tamworth Country Music Festival for their song \"Who put the Roo in the Stew?\", a reference to a recent scandal in which kangaroo meat had been found in hamburger mince exported from Australia. Their family-owned pastoral property Thornside was approaching its 100th anniversary of its establishment by their grandfather George and they decided to celebrate the occasion by hosting a country music event at their property to raise money for the Gympie Apex Club, a local community group. With the help of the Apex Club, local volunteers and the radio station 4QR (then a country music station), the first Gympie Music Muster was held on  24–26 September 1982 on 25 hectares of creek flats at Thornside. It attracted 6,000 people and raised $15,000 for local charities. After three years, the growing number of people attending (many of them camping on-site) made it necessary to find a new location near the Amamoor State Forest. A decision was also made to hold the event in August for better weather. The popularity of the event attracted many top country music performers. The event was held annually until 2019 after which it was cancelled in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID pandemic.\nWrattens National Park was gazetted in 2009.\nDemographics\nIn the  Amamoor Creek had a population of 56 people.\nIn the , Amamoor Creek had a population of 56 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Amamoor Creek.
