Initial government reports claimed that this convoy was doing a routine patrol of the area at the time and only approached the house after being fired upon, but after the battle, authorities admitted that the arrest was a pre-planned military operation done in response to a U.S. extradition request. Four people, including Ovidio, were found inside at 3:00 PM local time.\nBattle\nAround 700 cartel gunmen began to attack civilian, government and military targets around the city, despite orders from Ovidio sent at security forces' request. Massive towers of smoke could be seen rising from burning cars and vehicles. The cartels were well-equipped, with improvised armored vehicles, bulletproof vests, .50 caliber () rifles, rocket launchers, grenade launchers and heavy machine guns.\n56 prisoners in the city's prison rioted, took weapons from guards, and escaped in what The Daily Beast said \"appeared to be a planned attack\".\nIn the end, Ovidio was released after the cartel took eight servicemen as hostages, including one captured from local barracks in front of his children.\nAftermath\nPresident Andrés Manuel López Obrador defended the decision to release Ovidio, arguing it prevented further loss of life, insisting that he wanted to pacify the country and did not want more massacres, and arguing that the capture of one drug smuggler could not be more valuable than the lives of innocent civilians. While admitting that the security forces underestimated the Cartel's manpower and ability to respond, López Obrador also clarified that criminal processes against Ovidio were still ongoing, sending 8,000 troops and police reinforcements to restore peace in Culiacán.\nPolice officer Eduardo Triana Sandoval was ambushed at a strip mall and assassinated on 8 November 2019. Many media outlets claimed that he took part in Ovidio's arrest, however Cristóbal Castañeda Camarillo, head of Sinaloa State Police, stated he only took part in subsequent \"containment actions\".\nFollowing another operation in Culiacán on 5 January 2023, Guzmán López was successfully recaptured by Mexican authorities and transferred to a maximum security prison in Almoloya de Juárez, resulting in the 2023 Sinaloa unrest.\nReferences"
