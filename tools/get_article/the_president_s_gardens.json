      "text": "# The President's Gardens\n\n'The President's Gardens' is a novel written by the Iraqi author Muhsin al-Ramli. It was longlisted for the International Prize for Arabic Fiction (IPAF), known as the \"Arabic Booker\", in 2013. Set during the last fifty years of Iraqi history, this novel tells the story of three friends, exploring how ordinary people have been affected by historic events such as wars, the blockade of Iraq and the invasion of Kuwait. It examines the gap between the lifestyle of those in power and ordinary citizens. During the chaos of occupation, one of them loses his life, like so many caught between loyalists of the old and new regimes. ''The President's Gardens helps the reader understand the complexities of the successive tragedies besetting the ‘land between two rivers’. The gripping story is told with humanity, and life is somehow the victor despite all the obstacles.\nIt is followed up by Daughter of the Tigris (2019).\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140401032926/http://arabicfiction.org/news.219.html Interview with the author]\n* [http://www.arabicfiction.org/ IPAF]\n* [http://arablit.wordpress.com/2012/12/06/longlist-announced-for-2013-international-prize-for-arabic-fiction/longlist-announced-for-2013-international-prize-for-arabic-fiction/ Longlist Announced for 2013 International Prize for Arabic Fiction]\n* [http://arablit.wordpress.com/2012/12/10/looking-at-the-2013-longlist-muhsin-al-ramlis-the-presidents-gardens/#more-12591 Looking at the 2013 Longlist: Muhsin al-Ramli’s ‘The President’s Gardens’]\n* [http://www.aljazeera.net/news/pages/c74906bc-ec4a-48ac-82ce-9e507803b90c About The President’s Gardens'' in Aljazeera.net]"
