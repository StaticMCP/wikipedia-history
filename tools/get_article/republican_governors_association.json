Its primary objective is to help elect and support Republican governors.\nThe RGA's Executive Committee for 2024 includes Governors Eric Holcomb of Indiana, Greg Abbott of Texas, Greg Gianforte of Montana, Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas, Tate Reeves of Mississippi, Henry McMaster of South Carolina, Kristi Noem of South Dakota, Kim Reynolds of Iowa, and Glenn Youngkin of Virginia. In November of that year, Governor Brian Kemp of Georgia was elected Chairman, Governor Greg Gianforte of Montana was elected Vice Chairman, and Governor Henry McMaster of South Carolina was elected Policy Chairman.\nIts Democratic counterpart is the Democratic Governors Association. The RGA is not directly affiliated with the non-partisan National Governors Association.\nList of current Republican governors\nAll of the following states are members of the Republican Governors Association:\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!width=150px|Current governor\n!width=100px|State\n!Past\n!Took office\n!Current term\n|-\n|Kay Ivey\n| Alabama\n|List\n|2017\n|Second term (term-limited in 2026)\n|-\n|Mike Dunleavy\n| Alaska\n|List\n|2018\n|Second term (term-limited in 2026)\n|-\n|Sarah Huckabee Sanders\n| Arkansas\n|List\n|2023\n|First term\n|-\n|Ron DeSantis\n| Florida\n|List\n|2019\n|Second term (term-limited in 2026)\n|-\n|Brian Kemp\n| Georgia\n|List\n|2019\n|Second term (term-limited in 2026)\n|-\n|Brad Little\n| Idaho\n|List\n|2019\n|Second term\n|-\n|Mike Braun\n| Indiana\n|List\n|2025\n|First term\n|-\n|Kim Reynolds\n| Iowa\n|List\n|2017\n|Second term (elected to first full term in 2018)\n|-\n|Jeff Landry\n| Louisiana\n|List\n|2024\n|First term\n|-\n|Tate Reeves\n| Mississippi\n|List\n|2020\n|Second term (term-limited in 2027)\n|-\n|Mike Kehoe\n| Missouri\n|List\n|2025\n|First term\n|-\n|Greg Gianforte\n| Montana\n|List\n|2021\n|First term\n|-\n|Jim Pillen\n| Nebraska\n|List\n|2023\n|First term\n|-\n|Joe Lombardo\n| Nevada\n|List\n|2023\n|First term\n|-\n|Kelly Ayotte\n| New Hampshire}}\n|List\n|2025\n|First term (two-year term)\n|-\n|Kelly Armstrong\n| North Dakota\n|List\n|2024\n|First term\n|-\n|Mike DeWine\n| Ohio\n|List\n|2019\n|Second term (term-limited in 2026)\n|-\n|Kevin Stitt\n| Oklahoma\n|List\n|2019\n|Second term (term-limited in 2026)\n|-\n|Henry McMaster\n| South Carolina\n|List\n|2017\n|Second term (elected to first full term in 2018; term-limited in 2026)\n|-\n|Larry Rhoden\n| South Dakota\n|List\n|2025\n|First term\n|-\n|Bill Lee\n| Tennessee\n|List\n|2019\n|Second term (term-limited in 2026)\n|-\n|Greg Abbott\n| Texas\n|List\n|2015\n|Third term\n|-\n|Spencer Cox\n| Utah\n|List\n|2021\n|Second term\n|-\n|Phil Scott\n| Vermont\n|List\n|2017\n|Fifth term (two-year term)\n|-\n|Glenn Youngkin\n| Virginia\n|List\n|2022\n|First term (term-limited in 2025)\n|-\n|Patrick Morrisey\n| West Virginia\n|List\n|2025\n|First term\n|-\n|Mark Gordon\n| Wyoming\n|List\n|2019\n|Second term (term-limited in 2026)\n|}\nIn addition to governors of U.S. states, the RGA also offers membership to Republican governors of U.S. territories.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Current governor\n!Territory\n!Past\n!Took office\n!Current term\n|-\n|\n| American Samoa\n|List\n|2025\n|First term\n|-\n|\n| Puerto Rico\n|List\n|2025\n|First term\n|}\nList of RGA chairs\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Term\n!Chair\n!State\n|-\n|1963–1966\n|Robert E.

The elections were held on November 6, 2018, with Republicans losing a net of 7 governorships.\nIn 2017, it sponsored a website The Free Telegraph to promote issues from the perspective of Republicans.\n2020\nIn the 2020 election cycle, 11 states and two territories held elections for governors. The elections were held on November 3, 2020, with Republicans gaining a net of one governorship, Montana, for state elections. This marked the first time Montana elected a Republican governor in 16 years.  Former Governor Wanda Vázquez Garced, who was a member of the Republican Governors Association, lost reelection in Puerto Rico, meaning a net loss of one Republican governor for territorial elections.\n2022\n36 gubernatorial races occurred during the 2022 election cycle. The elections were held on November 8, 2022, with Republicans losing a net of 2 governorships and lost all territorial governorships.\n2023\n3 gubernatorial races occurred during the 2023 election cycle including Louisiana where Republican Jeff Landry was elected to succeed term-limited Democrat John Bel Edwards and took office in January 2024.\nFundraising\nIn the 18 months ending June 30, 2010, the RGA raised $58 million, while its counterpart DGA raised $40 million. \"Unlike the national political parties and federal candidates, the governors' associations can take in unlimited amounts from corporations,\" according to Bloomberg, which notes that the RGA recently received $1 million from Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, the parent corporation of Fox News, and $500,000 from WellPoint (now Anthem).\nIn 2018, the Republican Governors Association announced that $63.2 million was raised in all of 2017, including $27.2 million raised in the final six months of the year, setting a new fundraising record that significantly eclipses the $52.5 million raised in 2013, the last comparable year.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.opensecrets.org/527s/527cmtedetail_contribs.php?ein=113655877 Contributors] and [http://www.opensecrets.org/527s/527cmtedetail_expends.php?ein=113655877 Expenditures] at OpenSecrets"
