The attack was repelled and the attackers were forced to retreat.\nHistory\nPreviously, in 1718, Cossack raiders sacked several Chechen villages, as a response to which the princes Aidemir Bardykhanov and Musal Chopalov invaded Cossack villages and attacked Russian Terek fortifications. Combined with the attack on Terki 3 years later in 1721, these incidents were the main reasons for the two major Russian campaigns against the Chechens and Kumyks.\nIn February 1721, the two princes of Endirey, Aidemir Bardykhanov and Musal Chopalov, with an army numbering 4,600 fighters, made up of 1,200 infantry and 3,400 cavalry, launched an attack on the Terki fortress. However the garrison along with Greben Cossack fighters repelled the North Caucasians, only suffering 11 killed and 21 wounded. With heavy losses, the two princes retreated, ending the battle of Terki in a victory for the Russian Empire.\nSee also\n* Aidemir Bardykhanov — One of the leaders of the attack\n* Insurgency in Chechnya (1722) — Series of Russian punitive campaigns against the Chechens and Kumyks\nReferences"
