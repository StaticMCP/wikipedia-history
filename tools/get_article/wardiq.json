Certain accounts from the Issa suggest that they initially belonged to the Habr Je'lo, a sub-clan of the Isaaq, prior to being adopted by the Issa. Traditions also link the Wardiq with the narratives involving the ancient Harla people.\nThe Issa clan possesses the esteemed title of Ughaz, which is exclusively conferred upon members of the Wardiq.\nSee also\n* Issa\n* Sheekhal\nReferences"
