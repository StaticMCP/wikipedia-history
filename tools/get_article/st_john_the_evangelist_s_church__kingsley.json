It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Frodsham, the archdeaconry of Chester,  and the diocese of Chester.  Its benefice is united with those of Christ Church, Crowton, and St&nbsp;John the Evangelist, Norley.  The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade&nbsp;II listed building.  It was a Commissioners' church, having received a grant towards its construction from the Church Building Commission.\nHistory\nThe church was built in 1849–50 to a design by George Gilbert Scott.  A grant of £150 () was given towards its construction by the Church Building Commission.\nArchitecture\nSt John's is constructed in red sandstone rubble, and has grey slate roofs.  Its architectural style is that of the late 13th&nbsp;century.  The plan consists of a nave with a south porch and a short north aisle, a chancel with a north sacristy, and a west tower with a spire.  The tower is embraced by two chambers that are not part of the aisle.  The tower rises for a single stage above the nave; it has angle buttresses, triangular bell openings with tracery consisting of three circles, and a corbel table.  The spire is splay-footed, with lucarnes on the cardinal sides, and clock faces on three of the oblique sides.  The windows are lancets containing Geometric tracery.\nInside the church is a timber three-bay arcade.  At the west end is a baptistry with an octagonal font.  The reredos is in stone with polished granite columns.  The wrought iron screen is dated 1913.  The stained glass in the east window, dating from 1880, is by Clayton and Bell.  The church has an electronic organ that replaced a former pipe organ made by Harrison & Harrison.\nSee also\n*List of new churches by George Gilbert Scott in Northern England\n*Listed buildings in Kingsley, Cheshire\nReferences"
