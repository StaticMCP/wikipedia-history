The ship was an armed Japanese trading vessel, dispatched by Tokugawa Ieyasu to establish trade relations with Cambodia. Its crew consisted of 16 Chinese, 31 Japanese, a Portuguese merchant (João Mendes), and a black crew member. Following a storm, the vessel drifted into Korean waters. The Korean navy, still on high alert after the Imjin War, viewed the ship's presence as a threat. When initial efforts to communicate and requests of a peaceful surrender with the crew failed, tensions escalated, leading to the deployment of Korean warships.\nBattle\nThe engagement began on June 4 or June 14, 1604, with 25 Korean warships, led by commander Shin Yeo-ryang, surrounding the Japanese vessel. Korean ships, primarily , launched an attack involving fire arrows and artillery bombardment. Despite their size and firepower, the Japanese crew resisted fiercely, relying on muskets and melee combat. However, the superior Korean navy gradually overwhelmed the enemy. After more than 24 hours of fighting, Korean sailors boarded the Japanese ship, subdued the crew, and captured the vessel and most of its crew.\nAftermath\nSurviving crew members were taken prisoner and later interrogated. Recognizing the Chinese ownership of the ship, the Korean government repatriated the survivors to China, earning commendation and a reward from the Ming court.\nReferences\nSources\n*"
