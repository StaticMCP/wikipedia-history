The remaining nominations were announced on January 3, 2024, with Killers of the Flower Moon and Poor Things leading the nominations with eleven each, followed by Oppenheimer with nine.\nAs part of the annual awards highlighting the best in film, the SFCS added a new award to specifically honor the outstanding work of a person with local ties to the region called the John Hartl Pacific Northwest Spotlight Award. The award is named in honor of John Hartl, the late Seattle Times film critic whose legacy remains \"a beacon in the region and beyond when it comes to writing about film\". The SFCS Board will present the award annually to acknowledge an exceptional body of work, rather than a single film or performance, that represents the Pacific Northwest. This year, the inaugural award was presented to Lily Gladstone.\nWinners and nominees\n, Best Director winner]]\n, Best Actor in a Leading Role winner]]\n, Best Actress in a Leading Role winner and John Hartl Pacific Northwest Spotlight Award recipient]]\n, Best Actress in a Supporting Role winner]]\n, Best Original Score winner]]\n, Best Visual Effects co-winner]]\n, Achievement in Pacific Northwest Filmmaking winner]]\nWinners are listed first and highlighted in bold\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n'Past Lives (A24)'\n* American Fiction (Amazon MGM Studios)\n* Barbie (Warner Bros.
