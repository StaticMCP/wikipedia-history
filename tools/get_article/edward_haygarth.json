He was educated at Lancing College, where he played for both the college cricket and football teams. After completing his education, he came to Reading to train as a solicitor. He played club football as a full back for Reading and Swifts. He was an important figure in the early history of Reading. Haygarth likely played in the club's first ever match and was recorded as the club's first goalscorer, in addition to scoring the club's first hat-trick and captaining the club. He was later inducted into the Reading F.C. Hall of Fame, with contributions to the early history of Reading were recognised on the club's 150th anniversary, when a hospitality suite at the Madejski Stadium was rebranded as the Haygarth Lounge. He was capped once for England against Scotland at The Oval in 1875.\nIn the same year that he played football for England, Haygarth played first-class cricket for Hampshire against Sussex at Winchester. He later moved back to Cirencester, where he established a legal practice. He made two further first-class appearances for Gloucestershire in 1883, against Surrey and Yorkshire. He later lectured on agricultural law at the Royal Agricultural College. He later served as secretary of the college. Haygarth died in April 1915, at Siddington Manor in Siddington, Gloucestershire. Amongst members of his family, both his brother, John, and cousin, Arthur Haygarth, played first-class cricket.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
