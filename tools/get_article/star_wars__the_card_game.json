      "text": "# Star Wars: The Card Game\n\nStar Wars: The Card Game  is a Living Card Game (LCG) produced by Fantasy Flight Games published from 2012 to 2018. It is a two-player card game set in the Star Wars universe. It puts one player in command of the light side of the Force (with the affiliations Jedi, Rebel Alliance, and Smugglers And Spies making up the light side), and one player in command of the dark side of the Force (made up of Sith, Imperial Navy, and Scum And Villainy affiliations). The Balance of the Force expansion allows multi-player games. The game is set within the time-frame of the original Star Wars trilogy.\nEach player has a deck of objective cards representing various missions plus a deck of player cards of units (characters, vehicles, droids and creatures), events, enhancements and fates. Each objective is linked to a set of five player cards. Deck construction consists of choosing which objectives are to go into your objective deck, then adding each of those objective's set of five player cards to your player deck. Game play consists of deploying cards to your tableau, attacking your opponent's objectives, defending your own objectives, and committing cards to the Force Struggle.\nThe dark side player wins if the Death Star dial reaches 12, with this dial increasing by one on each dark side turn, effectively putting a timer on the game. It may also be increased by winning the Force struggle, destroying light side objectives, and via card effects. The light side player wins by destroying three dark side objectives before the Death Star dial reaches 12.\nExpansions\nCycles\nLike other Living Card Games, each card cycle consists of six packs of pre-determined cards—referred to as “force packs”—that focus on a particular theme or setting from within the Star Wars universe, including story elements that have only made an appearance in the formerly canon expanded universe now known as “Star Wars Legends.” Each force pack increases players' deck-building options with sixty cards (ten cohesive objective sets with six cards in each objective set). Deluxe expansions, released between each card cycle, add a larger volume of cards to the game than an individual force pack and primarily focus on two different factions in the game, one from the light side and one from the dark side,.\nOn January 10, 2018, Fantasy Flight Games announced that the release of the final force pack of the Alliances cycle, the sixth card cycle of the game, would mark the end of additional content for the game.\nHoth\nThe Hoth cycle invokes a powerful sense of location, and create a sense that the players are fighting over a specific place—in this case, Hoth. The light side player is asked to establish and defend Echo base. On the flip side, the dark side player has extra incentive to go after specific light side objectives to drive the Rebels from Hoth.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+\n|-\n!

Its balance has implications that reach far beyond damaging dark side objectives or advancing the Death Star dial. The cycle turned out to be a huge boost for light side play as it provided many answers against the dominant Sith decks. By the end of the cycle, several cards were either \"errataed\" or put on a restricted list due to the growing dominance of mainly Jedi decks.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+\n|-\n!
