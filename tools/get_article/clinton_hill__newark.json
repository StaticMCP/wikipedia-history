Philip was a well-to-do commission merchant and broker who worked in the Wall Street area and lived near fashionable Washington Square in the 1840s.  As commercialization and immigration overtook such Dutch and English Old New York Protestant neighborhoods, wealthy families moved further uptown into free-standing mansions or townhouses made of newly discovered chocolate sandstone (Brownstone) from Paterson, New Jersey.\nOthers were influenced by writers like Andrew Jackson Downing and Davis who advocated villa living in semi-rural areas in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Staten Island, and the Orange area of New Jersey, where Llewellyn Park was created in West Orange.  Tillinghast also joined the land speculators during this era to establish a suburban enclave of wealthy families in what was then Clinton Township.  His home, thought to be called Hawthorn Hill, was located in this area with green spaces and punctuated by churches such as St. Andrews Episcopal and First Presbyterian on Clinton Ave. to serve the WASP (white Anglo-Saxon Protestant) population that inhabited the new neighborhood.  Philip was ruined in the Panic of 1873.\nA daughter, Mary Elizabeth Tillinghast, was a famous embroidery and stained glass window artist (Grace Church, New-York Historical Society, St. Vincent's Hospital chapel) who had been a partner of John La Farge before going on her own.  She moved back to NYC after Philip died in 1879, and lived at 3 N. Washington Square, near her old house.  When she died in 1912, her studio was taken by Edward Hopper.\nGradually, immigration spread out from Newark and surrounded this enclave, whose inhabitants  moved further westward to West Orange (and St. Mark Episcopal church and 'new' Presbyterian church on Main Street). Left behind were mostly lower middle-class Ukrainian-Americans and Jewish-Americans. Now it is mostly African-American.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*http://www.newarkhistory.com/clintonave.html\n*Map:"
