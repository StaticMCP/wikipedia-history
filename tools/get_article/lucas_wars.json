      "text": "# Lucas Wars\n\nLucas Wars (originally Les Guerres de Lucas) is a graphic novel written by Laurent Hopman and illustrated by Renaud Roche, first released in France in 2023, about the makings of the first episode of the Star Wars saga.\nSynopsis\nLucas Wars tells the story of George Lucas, who overcame obstacles to create and direct the first Star Wars film in 1977.\nRelease\nBefore its release, the rights to Lucas Wars had already been purchased for publication in 15 countries.\nThe French edition Les Guerres de Lucas was published on 4 October 2023 by Deman Éditions.\nThe English translation Lucas Wars was released in September 2025.\nIn October 2025, Les Guerres de Lucas - Épisode 2 (Lucas Wars - Episode 2) was released in France. It tells the story of the production of The Empire Strikes Back and the creation of Indiana Jones.\nCritical reception\nThe magazine Le Point praises it as a fast-paced, sensitive graphic novel, a credible and sensitive portrait of George Lucas, and appreciates the important presence of two Star Wars heroes who are too rarely celebrated: Marcia Lucas, unofficial consultant to her husband, and the visionary producer Alan Ladd.\nThe website Culture Tops appreciated the work and felt the story was almost as exciting as Star Wars itself\nThe comic book website Actua BD highlighted the significant research as well as a successful drawing by Renaud Roche. They felt it was a graphic novel accessible to fans as well as to neophytes of the Star Wars universe, the authors having succeeded in maintaining the right balance between homage to the saga, biography of the director and discovery of the underside of cinema.\nThe cultural webzine Benzine highlighted the choice of the title of the book, perfectly adapted to what George Lucas had to face, and the beautiful cover. However, they would have liked the authors to feature more of the innovations in Star Wars, like the very first use of computer-assisted cameras.\nAwards\n* France Info Prize - News and Reporting Comic Book Award (2024)\n* Fnac France Inter - BD Award (2024)\n* Prix des Libraires Canal BD - Special mention Pass Culture (2024)\nReferences"
