The number and size of the routing transmissions make the network unusable for any but the smallest networks.\nThe conventional solution is to use a distance-vector routing protocol such as AODV, which usually transmits no data about routing.  However, distance-vector routing requires more time to establish a connection, and the routes are less optimized than a link-state router.\nTBRPF transmits only the differences between the previous network state and the current network state.  Therefore, routing messages are smaller, and can therefore be sent more frequently.  This means that nodes' routing tables are more up-to-date.\nTBRPF is controlled under a US patent filed in December 2000 and assigned to SRI International (Patent ID 6845091, issued January 18, 2005).\nFurther reading\n* B.
