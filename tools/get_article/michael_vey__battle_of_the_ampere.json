It was published on September 17, 2013 by Simon Pulse/Mercury Ink. The first book in the series, Michael Vey: The Prisoner of Cell 25, was #1 on the New York Times Best Seller list.\nPlot summary\nFollowing where the previous book left off, Michael is held by a tribe of natives. During this time, he meets a new Glow, Tessa, who escaped from Hatch years prior, who is able to increase the powers of the other electric children. Michael and Tessa depart with a group of the natives to meet Jaime, the Electroclan's guide. Upon meeting Jaime, they travel to a camp, but are ambushed by Elgen guards. Michael uses a security turret to kill the guards and escape, destroying the camp. At the same time, the Peruvian army massacres the tribe for harboring terrorists.\nMeanwhile, Taylor and the rest of the Electroclan have been captured by the Peruvian authorities for destroying the Elgen's power plant. While being interrogated, Taylor inadvertently tells the Elgen about the Voice that has been helping them. Ostin leads an escape attempt, but the group is quickly recaptured by the Elgen and the Peruvian army.\nAboard the Elgen flagship, the Ampere, the board of Elgen deposes of Hatch, only for Hatch and his loyal electric children to rebel and take over the board. Hatch reveals his plan to take over the island of Tuvalu as a base of operations to develop EMP weapons.\nMichael, Tessa, and Jaime set a trap to disrupt the convoy carrying the rest of the Electroclan. They succeed, and Michael rescues everybody except Taylor and Jack, who were taken by an Elgen bounty hunter. The Electroclan rescues them, but Wade is killed by a stray Elgen Guard. After an improvised memorial service, they meet up with Jaime in a hotel.\nJaime takes the Electroclan to a safe house, where he and the voice explain Hatch's plan to take over Tuvalu. They determine the best course of action is to destroy the Elgen's flagship, the Ampere. However, Ian, Zeus, Abigail, and Tessa, who are tired of running, decide to leave. Michael, Taylor, Ostin, McKenna, and Jack attack the Ampere but are cornered in the ship's engine room. As they prepare to detonate the bomb manually, the Elgen's battleship Watt explodes and Tessa, Zeus, Abigail, and Ian return. The Ampere is then blown up while everyone escapes.\nDuring a celebration for the mission's success, Taylor and Michael award Wade the Electroclan Medal of Valor to commemorate his sacrifice and to ease a grieving Jack. The voice allows Michael and Ostin to talk to their parents. The joy is cut short when it is revealed that Hatch escaped the ship before it blew and has kidnapped a child prodigy in China, known as Jade Dragon, who has figured out how to fix the MEI machine and create more electric children.\nSequel\nThe sequel of this book, Michael Vey: Hunt for Jade Dragon was published on September 16, 2014.\nCharacters\n* Michael Vey is the protagonist of the series.
