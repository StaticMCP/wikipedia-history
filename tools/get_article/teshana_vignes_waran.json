She was originally Malaysian and became naturalized French on 21 August 2013 after living in France for over 9 years  together with her sister Sashina Vignes Waran at that time also a professional badminton player.\nBiography\nYouth\nTeshana Vignes Waran comes from a family of Indian descent and Hindu religion. Born and raised in Malaysia, in a region where badminton is controlled by the Buddhist community, Teshana Vignes Waran and her sister, Sashina, who is a year older, were educated with the idea that moving to Europe would give them more opportunities for success in their discipline. Their mother Ms. Shanta Vignes Waran, an ex-banker in Kuala Lumpur founded the Oncourt Sports International Badminton Academy at the Selayang Mall Badminton Centre in 1999 when she noticed a deep interest and craving from her children to play badminton when they were eight years old.\nAchievements\nBWF International Challenge/Series\n''Women's doubles\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n!
