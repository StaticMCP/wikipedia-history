After loan spells with Fulham and Newcastle United he joined Birmingham City in search of regular first team football. He then played for Sunderland and had a short spell in the United States playing indoor football with the Dallas Sidekicks. He returned to England and played for Stoke City, Blackburn Rovers and ended his career with Halifax Town.\nClub career\nGayle was born in Toxteth and joined the youth ranks at local side Liverpool in 1974. He signed a professional contract with the club in 1977, becoming the first black player to play for Liverpool, which was seen as a \"victory\" for the black community in Liverpool.\n}}\nHis finest hour for Liverpool came in the 1980–81 European Cup semi-final second leg away at Bayern Munich when he came on as an early substitute to help Liverpool draw 1–1 and progress to the final on the away goals rule. Although he was a non-playing substitute in the final, he was rewarded with a winner's medal. After loan spells at Fulham and Newcastle United he left Anfield after making just five appearances. While at Newcastle he became the first Black player to represent them in the Football League when he made his debut against Cambridge United on 27 November 1982.\nGayle joined Birmingham City where he played in the 1982–83 season scoring once against West Ham and then he hit 10 in 45 during the 1983–84 campaign. Gayle then signed for Len Ashurst's Sunderland, where he became a popular player playing in two seasons before moving to the United States to play for Dallas Sidekicks in the Major Indoor Soccer League. He returned to England in April 1987 to play for Stoke City, playing six matches at the end of the 1986–87 season, scoring twice in a 3–2 defeat against Bradford City.\nHe then spent five years at Blackburn Rovers, where he was that club's first black player, the third club where he had achieved this milestone. He signed for them in 1987 and was a regular striker in their quest for top-flight football after an absence of more than 20 years.\nHe scored a total of 23 goals in the 1988-89 season, but Blackburn missed out on promotion with a playoff final defeat.\nHowever, by the time Blackburn were promoted to the newly created Premier League in 1992, Gayle had fallen down the pecking order in favour of expensive new signings Mike Newell and David Speedie, and with the arrival of national record signing Alan Shearer that summer, it was clear that Blackburn manager Kenny Dalglish felt that Gayle was surplus to requirements at Ewood Park.\nGayle joined Halifax Town in the newly renamed Division Three but managed just five league appearances as they were relegated to the Football Conference. After leaving Halifax he had a brief trial at Carlisle United, before retiring from football.\nInternational career\nAs an over age player, he helped England win the 1984 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship, in which he scored a goal in the final against Spain.\nPersonal life\nGayle was born to a father from Sierra Leone and a mother from Ghana. In August 2016, it was reported that Gayle had turned down a nomination for an MBE for his work with \"Show Racism the Red Card\", saying it would be \"a betrayal to all of the Africans who have lost their lives, or who have suffered as a result of Empire.\"\nHe released his autobiography in October 2016 titled 61 Minutes in Munich.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Club\n!rowspan=2|Season\n!colspan=3|League\n!colspan=2|FA Cup\n!colspan=2|League Cup\n!colspan=2|Other\n!colspan=2|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|Liverpool\n|1979–80\n|First Division\n|0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0\n|-\n|1980–81\n|First Division\n|4||1||0||0||0||0||1||0||5||1\n|-\n|1981–82\n|First Division\n|0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0\n|-\n|1982–83\n|First Division\n|0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0\n|-\n!colspan=2|Total\n!4!!1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!1!!0!!5!!1\n|-\n|Fulham (loan)\n|1979–80\n|Second Division\n|14||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||14||0\n|-\n|Newcastle United (loan)\n|1982–83\n|Second Division\n|8||2||0||0||0||0||0||0||8||2\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Birmingham City\n|1982–83\n|First Division\n|13||1||1||0||0||0||0||0||14||1\n|-\n|1983–84\n|First Division\n|33||8||4||0||8||2||0||0||45||10\n|-\n!colspan=2|Total\n!46!!9!!5!!0!!8!!2!!0!!0!!59!!11\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Sunderland\n|1984–85\n|First Division\n|25||2||1||0||7||1||0||0||33||3\n|-\n|1985–86\n|Second Division\n|23||2||2||0||1||0||2||0||28||2\n|-\n!colspan=2|Total\n!48!!4!!3!!0!!8!!1!!2!!0!!61!!5\n|-\n|Dallas Sidekicks\n|1986–87\n|MISL\n|30||6||0||0||0||0||0||0||30||6\n|-\n|Stoke City\n|1986–87\n|Second Division\n|6||2||0||0||0||0||0||0||6||2\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\"|Blackburn Rovers\n|1987–88\n|Second Division\n|13||1||0||0||1||0||2||0||16||1\n|-\n|1988–89\n|Second Division\n|45||19||3||0||4||1||6||3||58||23\n|-\n|1989–90\n|Second Division\n|30||5||2||0||1||0||3||1||36||6\n|-\n|1990–91\n|Second Division\n|24||4||2||0||1||0||0||0||27||4\n|-\n|1991–92\n|Second Division\n|4||0||0||0||2||0||1||0||7||0\n|-\n!colspan=2|Total\n!116!!29!!7!!0!!9!!1!!12!!4!!144!!34\n|-\n|Halifax Town\n|1992–93\n|Third Division\n|5||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||5||0\n|-\n!colspan=3|Career total\n!277!!53!!15!!0!!25!!4!!15!!3!!332!!61\n|}\nHonours\nLiverpool\n* European Cup winner: 1980–81\nSunderland\n* Football League Cup runner-up: 1984–85\nEngland under-21\n* 1984 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.liverpoolfc.com/info/howard-gayle Profile] at the Liverpool F.C. website\n*\n* [http://www.thisisanfield.com/columnists/2007/04/forgotten-heroes-howard-gayle/ Thisisanfield.com Forgotten Heroes]\n* [http://www.lfchistory.net/Players/Player/Profile/304 Profile] at [http://www.lfchistory.net LFCHistory.net]\n* [http://www.talksport.co.uk/radio/richard-keys-and-andy-gray/120515/howard-gayle-blackburn-liverpool-and-sunderland-172117 Interview with Gayle on Talksport]\n}}"
