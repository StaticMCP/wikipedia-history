The Award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. The Finnish Academy Awards submission is selected by an expert jury which is chosen by the Finnish Film Foundation.\nAs of 2025, Finland was nominated only once for The Man Without a Past (2002) by Aki Kaurismäki, even-tough the filmmaker boycotted the ceremony as a protest over the U.S. involvement in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nSubmissions\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award. Below is a list of the films that have been submitted by Finland for review by the academy for the award by the year of the submission and the respective Academy Award ceremony.\nAll films listed below were accepted by AMPAS, although two films — Drifting Clouds and Lights in the Dusk — which were withdrawn by their director Aki Kaurismäki after the films were sent to Hollywood in both 1996 and 2006. According to Mark Johnson, the chairman of the academy's foreign-language committee, he was told by the Finnish selection committee that Kaurismäki does not like film competitions.\nAll films were in Finnish except for their 2000 submission Seven Songs from the Tundra which was in Nenets and 2011 submission Le Havre which was in French. While 2003 and 2005 submissions were half in Swedish (also an official language of Finland), and the 1973 submission was in a Finnish dialect native to the Northern part of the country. The 2015 submission was in Estonian.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n! Year(Ceremony) !! Film title used in nomination !!
