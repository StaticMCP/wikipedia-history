It was created by the French sculptor Aimé-Jules Dalou and unveiled in 1890.\nHistory\nIn 1884, a group of leading artists, critics, writers and politicians proposed the creation of a monument that would honor Delacroix. To create the monument, they chose the well-known French sculptor Aimé-Jules Dalou.\nDescription\nThe monument is an allegorical display of four figures.  At the bottom Apollo, God of Poetry and Music, applauds as a winged old man, representing Time, lifts up a woman, representing Fame, to present a wreath of renown and immortality to the fourth figure, Delacroix.\nReferences"
