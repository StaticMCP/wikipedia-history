The song is the duo's sixth single release overall, and the second from their second studio album Just Feels Good. Both members of the duo wrote the song with David Lee Murphy and Brett James.\nContent\nThe duet is an exchange between both members of the group (Keifer and Shawna Thompson), in which both of them sing that they are trying to think about their worldly problems, but can only focus on each other at the moment.\nCritical reception\nGiving it 3.5 out of 5 stars, Billy Dukes of Taste of Country said that \"What the song lacks in creativity, the couple more than make up for in delivery.\" It received 4 out of 5 stars from Bobby Peacock of Roughstock, who said that \"the production is very energetic, with a heavy beat and searing guitar solos, and both members of the duo are in as fine voice as ever\" but said that it was \"lyrically thin\".\nMusic video\nThe music video was directed by Chris Hicky and premiered in July 2013.\nChart performance\nThe song has sold 165,000 copies in the US as of April 2014.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (2013–2014)\n!align=\"center\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2013)\n!scope=\"col\"|Position\n|-\n| US Country Airplay (Billboard)\n| align=\"center\" | 100\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2014)\n!scope=\"col\"|Position\n|-\n| US Country Airplay (Billboard)\n| align=\"center\" | 36\n|-\n| US Hot Country Songs (Billboard)\n| align=\"center\" | 57\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
