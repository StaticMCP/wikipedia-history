In 1990 it suffered a split when some members left to form the National Republican Party. The party contested the 1992 general elections, but received just 0.4% of the vote and failed to win a seat.\nThe URP did not contest any further elections until 2015, when, still led by Bandhu, it received just 432 votes (0.11%), again failing to win a seat.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.urpguyana.com/ Official website]"
