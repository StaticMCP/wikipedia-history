It is one of several high schools in the Williamson County Schools district.\nHistory\nThe school opened in 2004, initially with only a freshman and sophomore class. The junior class was added in the second year and the senior class in the third. The first class of seniors graduated on May 26, 2007. The second class, which was the first to complete all 4 years at Independence, graduated May 24, 2008. The school once had approximately 2000 students, but after the creation of nearby high schools, student enrollment has decreased significantly.\nAdministration\nMarilyn Webb was the first principal of Independence High from 2004 to 2008.
