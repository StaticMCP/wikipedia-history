In their eighth season under head coach Volney Ashford, the Vikings compiled a perfect 12–0 record (4–0 against MCAU teams), won the MCAU championship and two bowl games, and outscored all opponents by a total of 372 to 98.\nIn the final Litkenhous Ratings released in mid-December, Missouri Valley was ranked at No. 136 out of 500 college football teams.\nThe season was part of a 41-game winning streak (1941–1942, 1946–1948) that still ranks as the fifth longest in college football history. Coach Ashford, who led the team during the streak, was later inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.\nSchedule\n}}\n|October 2|||||Marshall, MO|W 32-6||\n|October 10|||||Marshall, MO|W 34-12||\n|October 17||at|||Fayette, MO|W 27-14||\n|October 24||at|||Warrensburg, MO|W 21-6||\n|October 31|||||Marshall, MO|W 33-7||\n|November 7||at|||Tarkio, MO|W 60-6||\n|November 14|||||Marshall, MO|W 31-0||\n|November 21||vs|||Kansas City, MO|W 21-7||\n|November 27|||||Marshall, MO|W 39-7||\n|December 13||at|||Abilene, TX (Boy's Ranch Bowl)|W 20-13||\n|January 1, 1948|1:00 p.m.|vs|West Chester|Phillips Field|Tampa, FL (Cigar Bowl)|W 26-7|10,000|\n}}\nNotes\nReferences"
