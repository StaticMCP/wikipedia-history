It is located not far from the Lion's Mound. The memorial commemorates soldiers of the King's German Legion (KGL), primarily drawn from the Kingdom of Hanover, who were killed during the 1815 battle. Amongst those killed during the fighting was Christian Friedrich Wilhelm von Ompteda.\nThe Legion had been formed following the French Invasion of Hanover in 1803. The KGL participated in numerous British military campaigns, notably during the Peninsular War. At Waterloo men from the KGL notably defended the strategic farmhouse at La Haye Sainte. Distinctly separate units of the revived Hanoverian Army also took part in the Waterloo campaign. The monument was made out of limestone.\nSee also\n*Gordon Monument, a nearby monument commemorating the British officer Alexander Gordon\n*Waterloo Column, a memorial in Hanover\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*"
