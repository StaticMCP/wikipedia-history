He was a company director and was involved in several businesses.\nOn 10 April 1877, he married Maggie Frame (died 1901) and had one son and three daughters. White died in Bundaberg in June 1922 and was buried in the Bundaberg Cemetery.\nPublic life\nWhite, representing the Ministerialists, won the 1903 by-election for the seat of Musgrave in the Queensland Assembly, replacing William O'Connell who had died in March of that year. He only held the seat until the next year at the 1904 state election when he was defeated by Labour's Charles Nielson.\nIn 1907, White won back the seat against Nielson. He remained a member of Musgrave until 1915 when he was once again beaten, this time by Thomas Armfield of the Labor Party. He stood again at the 1918 state election but was once again defeated. During his time in the parliament, he was the Secretary for Agriculture and Stock in 1912–1915.\nReferences"
