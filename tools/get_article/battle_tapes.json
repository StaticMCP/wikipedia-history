The band consists of Josh Boardman (vocals, guitar, synthesizer), Riley Mackin (keyboards, programming, vocals), Josh D'Elia (bass guitar, backup vocals) and Pete Kraynak (drums, percussion). Battle Tapes is known for its live performances, fully sequenced lighting and visuals and integrating electro and indie influences into its music and image.\nTo date, Battle Tapes has released four EPs: Sleepwalker (2011), Sweatshop Boys (2012), Solid Gold (2016), and Form (2017). They released their first studio album Polygon on November 20, 2015. They have released several singles: Valkyrie (Radio Edit) (2015), No Good (2017), Weight of the World (2019), If Only (2022), In Too Deep (2022), One Night in Burbank (2023), and Brand New (2023). Their second studio album Texture was released on May 5, 2023.\nBattle Tapes gained increased popularity in 2013, when their song \"Feel the Same\" from the Sweatshop Boys EP was featured in Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto V, on the in-game radio station Radio Mirror Park. The band also gained additional popularity in 2018, when several of their songs were featured in the Rooster Teeth web series Gen:Lock, with \"Belgrade\" used as its main theme.\nBattle Tapes made their festival debut in 2014, performing at The Sunset Strip Music Festival in Los Angeles, as well as SXSW in Austin, Texas. In early 2015, Battle Tapes announced they would be playing at the BottleRock Napa Valley Festival in May later that year.\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Title\n!Details\n|-\n|Polygon\n|\n* Released: November 20, 2015\n|-\n|Texture\n|\n* Released: May 5, 2023\n|}\nExtended plays (EP)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Title\n!Details\n|-\n|Sleepwalker\n|\n* Released: May 12, 2011\n|-\n|Sweatshop Boys\n|\n* Released: April 13, 2012\n|-\n|Solid Gold (feat.
