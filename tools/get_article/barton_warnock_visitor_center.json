The center was built in 1982 by the Lajitas Foundation and was known as the Lajitas Museum Desert Gardens. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department purchased the center in October 1990 and named it after Barton Holland Warnock (1911–1998), an American botanist and leading authority on flora of the Trans-Pecos area and northern Chihuahuan Desert. The center serves as the eastern visitor center for the Big Bend Ranch State Park and interprets the archaeological, historical, and natural history of the Big Bend region.\nSee also\n* List of Texas state parks\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://tpwd.texas.gov/state-parks/barton-warnock Barton Warnock Visitor Center]"
