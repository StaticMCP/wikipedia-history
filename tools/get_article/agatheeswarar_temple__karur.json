Vaali brought a Kashilingam from Kashi. However, before he reached there, Agasthya had already built a Shiva lingam with sand and consecrated it. As a result, Vaali ended up consecrating his lingam across the river at Ayalur (Sriramasamuthiram) where the temple is known as Valeeswarar temple.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* https://karur.nic.in/tourism/places-of-interest/\n* https://www.dinamalar.com/news/tamil-nadu-district-news-karur/news/1567133\n* :ta:திருமுக்கூடலூர் அகத்தீசுவரர் கோயில்\n* https://lightuptemples.com/temple-detail/sri-agasthiswarar-anjanakshi-temple-karur/827"
