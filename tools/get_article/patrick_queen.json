He played college football for the LSU Tigers and was selected 28th overall by the Baltimore Ravens in the 2020 NFL draft.\nEarly life\nBorn to Dwayne and Mary Sue Queen, Queen grew up in Ventress, Louisiana, as the youngest (and only son) out of four children.\nHe played football in middle school at False River Academy before moving on to high school. He later attended Livonia High School, where he played on the football team as both a linebacker and running back. Queen was a member of Livonia High School's 2014 state championship football team.  As a senior in 2016, he rushed for 1,487 yards and 19 touchdowns on offense and had 66 tackles, seven tackles for losses, and six passes broken up on defense. Queen participated in the 2014 National Combine, and received first team honors as a cornerback.\nDespite his four-star prospect rating, Queen had relatively few offers from Power Five conference schools, particularly the Southeastern Conference, where he had long been interested in playing. Queen's early offers came from smaller schools Tulane, Louisiana, Louisiana–Monroe, Colorado State, McNeese State, Louisiana Tech, and South Florida before receiving offers from Nebraska, Indiana, and his preferred destination of LSU, where he committed without any additional school visits on February 28, 2016. Queen became the first player from Livonia to receive a scholarship from LSU. Queen's recruiting profile was complex, as each major sports recruiting website listed him at a different position. 247Sports, which listed him as a versatile athlete, ranked him as the 17th best ATH in the country, and the 12th best player from Louisiana. Rivals, which listed him as an outside linebacker, ranked him as the 13th best OLB in his class and 8th best recruit from Louisiana. ESPN.com, which listed him as a running back, ranked him the 30th best RB in the country and the 14th best recruit from Louisiana.\nCollege career\nQueen made six tackles in 12 games played as a true freshman. He finished his sophomore season with 40 tackles, 5.0 tackles for loss and a sack. Queen entered his junior year on the watchlist for the Butkus Award. Queen finished the regular season with 69 tackles (eight for a loss), 2.5 sacks, three pass deflections, two breakups, an interception and a fumble recovery. Queen was named the Defensive MVP of the 2020 National Championship Game after making eight tackles with 2.5 for a loss and a combined sack against Clemson. Following the end of the season Queen announced that he would forgo his senior season to enter the 2020 NFL draft.\nStatistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Team\n! colspan=\"2\"| Games\n! colspan=\"4\"| Tackles\n! colspan=\"4\"| Interceptions\n! colspan=\"3\"| Fumbles\n|-\n!
