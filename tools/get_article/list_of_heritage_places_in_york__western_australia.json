Part of the large underground tank system which provided water for the house and bakery still remains.\nThe bakehouse, covered well and outbuilding stand apart to the rear of the house. The original store was in the two south-east rooms, originally one large room with its own fireplace. The uneven floor levels throughout the house indicate consideration additions over the years. Most of the roof shingles are still in place under the corrugated iron and many convict marked bricks have been found. Most of the original bricks were baked in a kiln slightly to the south-west.\nThere is no damp course in the original building.\nThe present bathroom was once the pantry and the two outside rooms are a later addition showing signs of a damp course.

It is also the location of one of the earliest schooling sites. This school certainly pre-dated the present house and was conducted by Mr George Pope.\nThe small brick and stone Edwardian house was built on part of the block originally consisting of 29 Avon Terrace, by some members of the family who owned 29 Avon Terrace. The block was subdivided from the larger block and in 1911 a large room of brick was built close to the adjoining house. It had an ornate side door, which has now been converted to a window. A brick and stone house with brick quoins. The building has a characteristic high pitched corrugated iron roof, decorative verandah at the front, decorated gable and window canopy.\nBy 1919 three more stone rooms had been added to the large brick room, adjoined by a small passageway. A front and back verandah was added (iron lace decorating the front). Much later the back verandah was converted to a bathroom and laundry. Missing is a large curved awning from the front window of the brick room. In 1992 it was thought to be causing cracking in that wall and was removed.\n|31\n|Avon Tce\n|Municipal Inventory Adopted 31 Dec 1995 (Shire of York),\nRegister of the National Estate Registered 21 Mar 1978,\nClassified by the National Trust Classified 05 Mar 1985,\n|\n|-\n|2854\n|Davies Buildings\n|Constructed from 1908.\n|96-102\n|Avon Tce\n|Classified by the National Trust Classified 05 Mar 1985,\nRegister of the National Estate Registered 21 Mar 1978,\nShire register - 31 Dec 1995\n|\n|-\n|5972\n|Top of the World Hill\n|This site offers the first view of the Avon Valley on the road from Perth.\n|\n|Great Southern Hwy\n|Shire register - 31 Dec 1995\n|\n|-\n|5990\n|House\n|Constructed from 1859.
