The award, which had been named after Yeşilçam Street in the Beyoğlu district of Istanbul where many film studios were based during the 1950s-1970s, was discontinued following the announcement by the Alliance of Cinema Labor Unions' Yeşilçam Film Academy (YEFA) intention to start issuing their own Yeşilçam Academy Award in protest against TÜRSAK's disregard of their suggestions to give the awards a more professional structure.\nAwards\n{| align=\"right\" class=\"toccolours\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\"\n|- style=\"background: #e0e0e0\"\n!
