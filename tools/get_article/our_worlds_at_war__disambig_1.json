OWAW was a crossover storyline that spanned several different books, including several books starring Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, and a number of supporting characters and books. Creators involved in the crossover included writers Jeph Loeb, Joe Casey, Mark Schultz, Joe Kelly, Phil Jimenez, and Peter David, and artists that included Mike Wieringo, Ed McGuinness, Doug Mahnke, Ron Garney, and Leonard Kirk.\nPlot\nThe Our Worlds at War storyline involves the heroes battling Imperiex, a cosmic entity who represents entropy and threatens to destroy the universe.\nThanks to the sacrifice of Strange Visitor and General Rock, Earth's forces crack Imperiex's armor, releasing his energy. However, Brainiac-13 appears with Warworld and absorbs the energy, vowing to use it to rule everything.\nIn a desperate gambit, Superman dives into the Sun, gaining a massive power boost. Realizing that Warworld cannot be destroyed without releasing Imperiex and triggering another Big Bang, Superman and Martian Manhunter transport Imperiex and Brainiac back in time to the Big Bang, destroying them both.\nSeveral heroes are killed or presumed dead during the conflict, including Hippolyta, Sam Lane, Aquaman, Maxima, Massacre, Jonathan and Martha Kent, and Strange Visitor. Hippolyta, Aquaman, Sam Lane, and the Kents are later revealed to have survived.\nCharacters\n* The Flash\n* Superman\n* Krypto\n* Wonder Woman (Diana Prince, Hippolyta)\n* Green Lantern (Kyle Rayner)\n* Martian Manhunter\n* Aquaman\n* The Justice League of America\n* Young Justice\n* Superboy\n* Supergirl\n* Imperiex\n* Brainiac 13\n* Darkseid\n* Grayven\n* Doomsday\n* Lex Luthor\n* Suicide Squad\n* Manchester Black\n* Strange Visitor\n* Lois Lane\n* Lena Luthor\n* Sam Lane\nPublications\nThe story ran through the following issues:\n* Action Comics #780-782\n* Adventures of Superman #593-596\n* Batman #593-594\n* Batman: Our Worlds at War #1\n* Flash: Our Worlds at War #1\n* Green Lantern: Our Worlds at War #1\n* Harley Quinn: Our Worlds at War #1\n* Impulse #77\n* JLA: Our Worlds at War #1\n* JSA: Our Worlds at War #1\n* Nightwing: Our Worlds at War #1\n* Superboy #89-91\n* Supergirl #59-61\n* Superman #171-173\n* Superman: Our Worlds at War Secret Files and Origins #1\n* Superman: The Man of Steel #115-117\n* Wonder Woman #171-173\n* Wonder Woman: Our Worlds at War #1\n* ''World's Finest Comics: Our Worlds at War #1\n* Young Justice #35-36\n* Young Justice: Our Worlds at War #1\n* Superman/Batman #64, #68-71 (a brief new direction of the Superman/Batman series at the start of 2010 that featured a story that took place in the aftermath of Our Worlds at War with #64 acting as a prologue and #68 through #71 being the story proper complete with the trade dress banner).\nCollected editions\nThe story has been collected into trade paperbacks:\n* SUPERMAN: OUR WORLDS AT WAR VOL. 1 | 256pg. | Color | Softcover |\n* SUPERMAN: OUR WORLDS AT WAR VOL. 2 | 247pg. | Color | Softcover |\n* SUPERMAN: OUR WORLDS AT WAR THE COMPLETE EDITION'' | 512pg. | Color | Softcover |\nReferences"
