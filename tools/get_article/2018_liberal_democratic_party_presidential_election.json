Incumbent president Shinzo Abe was running for his re-election after a rule change in 2017 that allowed him to run for a third term.\nAbe's subsequent victory led to him staying as prime minister for just under two years. In this time, on 22 November 2019, he broke the record for the nation's longest-serving prime ministership previously held by Taro Katsura, who had served three times between 1901 and 1913. He also served the longest uninterrupted term by 24 August 2020, ahead of Eisaku Satō's 2,797 days, before resigning four days later.\nBackground\nScandals\nIn March 2018, it was revealed that the Finance Ministry (with finance minister Tarō Asō at its head) had falsified documents presented to the parliament in relation to the Moritomo Gakuen scandal, to remove 14 passages implicating Abe. It has been suggested that the scandal could cost Abe his seat as the Liberal Democratic Party's leader. A Kyodo poll showed the Japanese government popularity's has fallen as low as 30% from 44% in February.\nCandidates\nNominated\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:150px;\" | Candidate(s)\n!
