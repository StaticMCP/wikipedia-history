His mother was Amelia, daughter of John Warburton.\nMilitary service\nOn 24 April 1793, Elphinstone was appointed a second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers. He was present for the expedition that took the Cape of Good Hope in 1795, and was promoted to lieutenant on 5 February 1796 and captain on 1 July 1800. Elphinstone commanded the engineers in Sir David Baird's Indian army sent to help expel the French from Egypt in 1801. Sent on a mission to Brazil in 1806, he was the commanding engineer at the Battle of Montevideo in 1807, under the overall command of John Whitelocke. He was posted to Portugal in 1808, commanding the Royal Engineers of the Peninsular army.\nHe saw his first service in the Peninsular War at the Battle of Roliça, where he was badly wounded and subsequently left the theatre. On 1 January 1812, he was breveted major and returned to the Peninsula, where he served until the end of the war. Promoted regimental lieutenant-colonel on 21 July 1813, after the battles of Nivelle and the Nive, Elphinstone commanded the engineers at the crossing of the Adour and the siege and battle of Bayonne.\nAfter the war, the Peninsular commanders were honoured, and Elphinstone was no exception. He was created 1st Baronet of Elphinstone, of Sowerby in the County of Cumberland, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 25 May 1816, and nominated a Companion of the Order of the Bath. He saw no further active service, but was promoted regimental colonel on 2 December 1824 and major-general on 10 January 1837.\nFamily\nElphinstone married his first cousin Frances Warburton (daughter of John Warburton, junior, and niece of John Clater Aldridge) on 14 February 1803.
