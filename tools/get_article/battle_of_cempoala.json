When Velázquez heard about this, he was furious. He decided to send Pánfilo de Narváez to regain control of the expedition. On 5 March, Narváez departed for Mexico.\nVoyage\nThe voyage was chaotic from the start. Heavy storms sank 6 of the 19 ships, killing about 50 men. Several of the ships split up and Narváez didn’t land until 22 April, at which point Cortés had already found extravagant lodging in Tenochtitlan. López Ayllón de la Audiencia de Santo Domingo, the representative for the King of Spain, arrived early.\nPlanning\nImmediately after landing, Narváez attacked a small coastal garrison led by Gonzalo de Sandoval. Narváez's attack failed, causing him to lose several prisoners, which were sent to Cortes to warn him of the danger. In mid-May, Cortés left Tenochtitlan to deal with Narváez. Narváez took advantage of his numerical superiority and captured the city of Cempoala, making it his base of operations. He took as hostages the eight Cempolan noblewomen that had married Spanish men in Cortés' company, and allowed his men to mistreat the local population. Xicomecoatl, the ruler of the city and an ally to Cortés, threatened Narváez with calling Cortés, but he was forced into obedience.\nFor his part, after trading messengers with Narváez and ultimately resolving to free Cempoala by force, Cortés sent a soldier to contact their Chinantec allies for help. He returned with 200 warriors armed with long pikes, needed to counter Narváez's cavalry, and the promise that 2,000 more warriors would follow later.\nBattle\n]]\nOn 27 May, Cortés, Sandoval, and fellow conquistador captains launched a surprise attack on Narváez's forces in the middle of the night with 266 soldiers and 200 native auxiliary troops. Due to heavy rainfall and superior numbers, Cortés's forces quickly captured his opponent's cavalry and artillery. Narváez's forces retreated to the main temple of Cempoala, but attempted to flee as opposing Spanish-native forces prepared to surround it. In the ensuing chaos, Narváez was hit by a pike in the eye, wounding him badly and allowing him to be captured.\nDuring the battle, Xicomecoatl took refuge in Narváez's house, where he was stabbed by one of Narváez's soldiers and badly wounded. After the battle, Cortés, upon being notified of his ally’s wounds, ordered him to be freed and taken to his room for his wounds to be cured.\nAftermath\nNarváez was taken prisoner for two years as most of his former troops aligned with Cortés due to the allure of Tenochtitlan's riches. The most immediate fratricidal threat to Cortés' campaign was thwarted, marking a pivotal Cortesian victory in the course of the Spanish-Aztec War. Velázquez, instead of eliminating Cortés as he had planned, essentially replenished and reinforced the army of his nemesis.\n1,500 more of the Chinantec warriors summoned by Cortés arrived late and did not partake in the battle. They would be employed instead to watch over Narváez's contingent. It is believed the initial 200 did fight, however.\nSmallpox outbreak\nSeveral of Narváez's soldiers had smallpox and during the battle it spread to some of Cortés's forces, many of whom went to Tenochtitlan, spreading smallpox to the Native Americans. The subsequent pandemic killed millions of Native Americans, possibly even 90% of the indigenous population.\nReferences"
