It is the second full-length release by the current seven-piece incarnation of the band and featured new compositions never before released by the band on record.\nReception\n}}\nThe album has received positive reviews. John Kelman, writing for All About Jazz, praises the new lineup, noting \"… with the triple drum set arrangements, twin guitars, reeds and woodwinds, and bass and stick, all played by top- drawer musicians capable of respecting every song's formal construction while, at the same time, introducing interpretive variations and impressive solos, this is no tribute band; this is a Crimson… bringing the music firmly into the 21st Century.\"\nRegarding the new compositions, Dom Lawson writes for Prog magazine, \"Part wholesale reinvention, part meticulous refinement, the… new material crackles and pops with exuberance and the infectious thump of hearts buoyed by fresh adrenalin.\"\nTrack listing\nDisc one\nDisc two\nPersonnel\nKing Crimson\n:Front Line\n* Pat Mastelotto – drums, electronic percussion\n* Bill Rieflin – drums, electronic percussion, keyboards\n* Gavin Harrison – drums, electronic percussion\n:Back Line\n* Mel Collins – saxophones, flutes\n* Tony Levin – basses, Chapman Stick, backing vocals\n* Jakko Jakszyk – guitar, lead vocals\n* Robert Fripp – guitar, guitar synth, keyboard\nProduction\n* Trevor Wilkens – audio recorder\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://papabear.com/tours/crim15/crim15_18.htm Tony Levin's diary entry for the Toronto shows]"
