She graduated with a doctorate in veterinary medicine from Texas A&M in 1980. She earned a PhD in reproductive physiology from University of Maryland in 1989.\nOriginally a veterinarian, Howard later became an expert in animal breeding, receiving the nickname \"Sperm Queen\".” She used common human infertility treatments, like artificial insemination and In vitro fertilisation, and was a pioneer in electroejaculation techniques.\nIn 1980, she began working at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Washington, D.C. She oversaw the black-footed ferret breeding program at The National Zoo.  With her aid more than 500 kits were born and 150 artificial inseminations were performed.\nIn 1992, alongside the Nashville Zoo President Rick Schwartz, she conducted the first successful clouded leopard artificial insemination. \"If we lose this species,\" Howard says of the clouded leopards, \"that means we probably lose other species in the forest. We may lose the forest all together. It may affect the human race eventually. I think most people want to just see these animals and want their future generations to see these animals. They are unique and nothing's going to replace a clouded leopard.\"\"\nFrom 1998 to 2000, Howard surveyed giant pandas in China. This study helped identify the causes of poor reproduction, which led to a rise in the population of giant pandas in breeding centers and zoos over the next ten years. “I’m not an emotional person,” she once told a reporter. “But it’s pretty cool when you realize you’re putting these animals back where they should be.”\nHoward oversaw the project to artificially inseminate the National Zoo’s female panda, Mei Xiang, and produced the first surviving cub, Tai Shan, in 2005.\nShe died from cancer on March 5, 2011, in Washington D.C.\nHoward was a pioneering reproductive physiologist known for her groundbreaking work in the conservation of endangered species. As a researcher at the Smithsonian's National Zoo, she adapted human infertility treatments to help breed endangered animals, making significant contributions to the field of theriogenology—the study of animal reproduction.\nEarly life and education\nHoward was born in 1952 and developed an early interest in biology and animal science. She pursued higher education in the United States, earning her Ph.D. from the University of Maryland, College Park. Her academic and research pursuits set the stage for a career dedicated to animal conservation and reproductive science.\nCareer and innovations\nHoward began her career at the Smithsonian's National Zoo, where she quickly became a leading figure in the zoo's reproductive physiology program. She focused on using artificial insemination and other reproductive technologies to breed endangered species, adapting techniques initially developed for human infertility treatments.\nOne of Howard's most notable achievements was the first successful artificial insemination of a clouded leopard in 1992. This milestone was crucial for the conservation of this endangered species, showcasing the potential of assisted reproductive technologies in wildlife conservation.\nIn addition to her work with clouded leopards, Howard was instrumental in the black-footed ferret breeding program at the National Zoo. During the 1980s, the black-footed ferret population had dwindled to just 18 individuals. Under her supervision, over 500 ferret kits were born, significantly contributing to the recovery of the species from the brink of extinction.\nHoward's expertise was also pivotal in the birth of Tai Shan, the first surviving giant panda cub born at the National Zoo. In 2005, she performed the artificial insemination of the panda Mei Xiang, leading to this significant achievement in panda conservation.\nImpact on society\nThe techniques and protocols developed by Howard have had a profound and lasting impact on wildlife conservation. Her work has helped increase the populations of several endangered species and has provided a foundation for future conservation efforts. The methodologies she pioneered continue to be used in breeding programs worldwide, demonstrating the enduring value of her contributions.\nHoward's influence extends beyond her immediate achievements. She was a mentor and inspiration to many in the field of reproductive physiology, training the next generation of scientists who continue to advance conservation science. Her pioneering spirit and dedication to preserving biodiversity have left a lasting legacy.\nRecognition and legacy\nDespite her significant contributions to animal conservation, Howard's work is not widely recognized. She died in 2011 from melanoma, but her legacy lives on through the ongoing efforts of the scientists and conservationists she inspired. Howard's work remains highly influential, highlighting the critical role of scientific innovation in preserving endangered species and maintaining ecological balance.\nAwards and recognitions\n* Research Career Award (SERCA) from the National Institutes of Health\n* Ulysses S.
