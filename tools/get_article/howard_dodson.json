His parents worked blue-collar jobs in construction and textiles. He attended West Chester State College (now West Chester University), and then earned a master's degree in history and political science at Villanova. In 1964, he joined the Peace Corps and spent two years in Ecuador. In 1968, believing he had responsibilities in the United States during the civil rights movement, he returned, stopping in Puerto Rico for a period of reflection and then going to Berkeley to study slavery in the Western Hemisphere.  From 1974 to 1979, he worked as the executive director of the Atlanta-based Institute of the Black World, in addition to teaching classes at Emory University. Dodson was later a consultant to the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) until 1984.\nDodson took on the directorship of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in 1984 and had a successful tenure, during which he increased the center's holdings of historical artifacts—many of them rare and irreplaceable—from 5 to 10 million, curated numerous displays and exhibitions, and raised millions of dollars in support. One high point was his intimate involvement in the African Burial Ground project, through which the remains of hundreds of former slaves buried in Manhattan during the 17th and 18th centuries were exhumed and reburied.\nAfter retirement from the Schomburg Center in 2010, Dodson took on a position as director of Howard University's library system, which includes the undergraduate and graduate libraries, and the Moorland-Spingarn Research Center (MSRC).\nPublished works\n* 1984: Censorship and Black America, An Exhibition in the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture : July 19-October 15, 1984.
