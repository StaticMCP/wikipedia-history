The townships are Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, and Jackson.\nMonument\nA monument at the rural intersection of Maples and Sampson roads in Monroe Township was constructed to mark the point and opened on September 22, 1917. The ceremony included a speech by Congressman Louis W. Fairfield. A flagpole was once part of the site. There were also proposals to include a cannon.\nThe Four Presidents Corners Historical Society raised funds to restore the Four Presidents Corners Monument for the centennial of its dedication, with the work conducted in 2015. The name is used for the neighborhood around the monument.\nWhile there are numerous quadripoints in the United States—for example, three Indiana county quadripoints (Starke/Marshall/Pulaski/Fulton; Porter/LaPorte/Jasper/Starke; DeKalb/LaGrange/Noble/Steuben)—none are named for presidents and memorialized such as this one.\nSee also\n*Four Corners (disambiguation)\n*Four Corners Monument\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://sites.rootsweb.com/~infpchs/corners.htm Four Presidents Corners]"
