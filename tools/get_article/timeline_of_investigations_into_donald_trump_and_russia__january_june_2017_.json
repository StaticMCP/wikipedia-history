Following the timeline of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections before and after July 2016 up until election day November 8 and the post-election transition, this article begins with Donald Trump and Mike Pence being sworn into office on January 20, 2017, and is followed by the second half of 2017. The investigations continued in the first and second halves of 2018, the first and second halves of 2019, 2020, and 2021.\nPost-election transition, starting November 8, 2016\nJanuary–June 2017 – Trump administration\nJanuary\n* January:\n** For two days in early January 2017, in a gathering George Nader attended and brokered, Joel Zamel and General Ahmed Al-Assiri met with Michael Flynn and other members of the Trump transition team in New York. Steve Bannon was involved as well. In October 2018, the meeting came under the Mueller investigation's scrutiny.\n** White House Counsel Donald McGahn tells Trump he believes that Flynn had misled the FBI and lied to Vice President Pence, and should be fired.\n** McGahn researches the Logan Act and federal laws related to lying to federal investigators. Records turned over to the Mueller investigation show McGahn believes Flynn violated one or more of those laws.\n* January 20:\n** Trump and Pence take office.\n** While seated at Trump's inauguration speech, Flynn texts Alex Copson, chairman of ACU Strategic Partners, that Russian sanctions blocking a private Russian-backed plan to build nuclear plants in the Middle East will now be \"ripped up\". An associate of Copson later denies the allegation.\n** Sergei Millian, Source D in the Steele dossier, attends VIP inauguration events. He also arranges to meet with Papadopoulos at the Washington, D.C., restaurant Russia House. Millian brings Moroccan American music producer Aziz Choukri to the meeting. Papadopoulos later claims Choukri accused Millian of working for the FBI, but in a separate interview Choukri denies the accusation occurred.\n** Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer involved in the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, and Rinat Akhmetshin, another participant in that meeting, attend the Liberty Ball at the Library of Congress hosted by Representative Dana Rohrabacher's campaign committee. Akhmetshin later claims he received tickets from event organizers, but Rohrabacher's office claims the campaign has no record of such an invitation or of ticket purchases by the two. Ukrainian oligarch Serhiy Lyovochkin attends using tickets acquired for him by Sam Patten and Kilimnik. Ukrainian lawmaker Serhiy Kivalov attends the event, but refuses later to tell reporters how he obtained the tickets he displayed on Twitter. Ukrainian lawmaker Borislav Bereza attends using tickets he says he received from someone \"connected to Illinois.\" Ticket sales are counted as donations to Rohrabacher's campaign.

After being cautioned about making false statements, Papadopoulos repeatedly lies to the investigators, telling them he only met Mifsud in February 2016 before he joined the Trump campaign and denying he tried to help Russians set up meetings with the campaign. In October 2017 he will plead guilty to making omissions and false statements during the interview.
