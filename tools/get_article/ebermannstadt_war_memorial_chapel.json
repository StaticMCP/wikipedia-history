It was to be a chapel in thanksgiving and in honor of God. The chapel was completed after Peter Martin's death by his brother Georg, with the help of his siblings and nephews. It is still privately owned today and is maintained by descendants of the founder.\nThe chapel was consecrated on May 31, 1931 by the then parish priest Weber.\nPeter Martin was buried in the Ebermannstadt cemetery, together with his siblings Georg and Anna, among others. The gravestone is still preserved today.\nBuilding\nThe Bavarian State Office for the Preservation of Monuments lists the field chapel under the number D-4-74-121-61. The chapel is a \"small hall building closed on three sides with a gabled roof and ridge turret, partially plastered solid construction on a high limestone ashlar base, neo-Gothic, after 1915; at the same time a brick forecourt base with cast-iron enclosure\".\nThe bell was melted down for war purposes during the Second World War.\nInterior decoration\nThe four stained glass windows in the chapel are each decorated with symbols for faith, hope, love and peace.\nThe Holy Trinity is depicted on the altar, created by the sculptor Bauer-Bamberg.\nReferences"
