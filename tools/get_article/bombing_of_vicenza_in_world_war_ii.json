In addition to homes and public buildings, many landmarks suffered serious damage: among them the Cathedral, the churches of San Gaetano and Santa Corona, the Basilica Palladiana, the Arco delle Scalette, the Palazzo Valmarana and several other churches (such as the Basilica of Saints Felice and Fortunato) and historic palaces (such as the Ca’ d’Oro). The Verdi and Eretenio theatres were destroyed and never rebuilt.\nCasualties among the civilian population from the air raids numbered about one thousand victims (other sources claim that there were 2,000 deaths).\nReferences"
