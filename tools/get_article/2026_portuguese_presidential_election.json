The incumbent president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa (president since 2016, supported by PSD), is constitutionally barred from running for a third consecutive term.\nSeveral personalities declared their candidacy, including the former coordinator of the COVID-19 Vaccination Task Force Henrique Gouveia e Melo and former Social Democratic Party (PSD) leader Luís Marques Mendes. The Socialist Party (PS) officially supports former party leader António José Seguro. André Ventura, the leader of Chega, played with the idea of being a candidate, until committing in September 2025. Other personalities, like both MEPs João Cotrim Figueiredo (IL) and Catarina Martins (BE), also announced their candidacies, as well as former MP António Filipe (PCP) and MP Jorge Pinto (L). Almost 40 candidates have, so far, expressed their intention to be on the Presidential ballot.\nBackground\nMarcelo Rebelo de Sousa was re-elected in January 2021 with nearly 61 percent of the votes in the first round. He took the oath of office on March 9, 2021, and continued the period of cohabitation with Socialist Party Prime Minister António Costa, which lasted until April 2024. This cohabitation ended after the March 2024 elections, which saw Luís Montenegro, from the Social Democratic Party (the same party as the President), nominated as prime minister.\nIn Portugal, the president serves as the head of state with primarily ceremonial duties, though the president holds some political influence and can dissolve Parliament during a crisis. The president also resides at the Belém Palace in Lisbon. Since the Carnation Revolution, all Portuguese presidents have been re-elected for a second term and never tried a third, with one exception: Mário Soares (PS), who sought a non-consecutive third term in the 2006 presidential election but lost. Thus, every president since 1976 has served exactly two terms.\nBy the end of his 10 years in office, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa saw a very strong drop in his popularity according to polling.\nElectoral system\nTo stand for election, candidates must be of Portuguese origin and over 35 years old, gather 7,500 signatures of support one month before the election, and submit them to the Constitutional Court of Portugal. Then, the Constitutional Court has to certify if the candidacies submitted meet the requirements to appear on the ballot.\nA candidate must receive a majority of votes (50% plus one vote) to be elected. If no candidate achieves a majority in the first round, a runoff election (i.e., second round, held between the two candidates who receive the most votes in the first round) has to be held. The highest number of candidacies ever accepted was ten, in 2016. Since the Carnation Revolution, there has only ever been a single runoff election, in the 1986 Portuguese presidential election, when Diogo Freitas do Amaral (46.31% of votes in the first round and 48.82% in the second) lost to Mário Soares (25.43% in the first round and 51.18% in the second).\nCandidates\nDeclared\nThis section only includes the candidates who have received the support of any party represented in the Assembly of the Republic, who have appeared as an option in opinion polling or whose candidacy has received coverage by more than two nationwide TV channels or newspapers.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | Candidate\n!

However, this format was challenged, as the three main broadcasters were accused of forcing an exclusivity agreement so that the debates only take place on these three channels. CMTV filed a complaint against RTP, SIC and TVI, with the Electoral Commission (CNE) accusing the networks of an \"anti-competitive matrix\". The channels denied such agreement, but the media regulator ruled in favour of CMTV and advised for the debate format to include the plaintiff. Despite this advise, the 3 channels decided to not change the format.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ 2026 Portuguese presidential election debates\n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\"| Date\n! rowspan=\"4\"| Time\n! rowspan=\"4\"| Organisers\n! rowspan=\"4\"| Moderator(s)\n! colspan=\"10\"|    &nbsp;}}   &nbsp;}}\n|-\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Audience\n! rowspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:40px;\" |\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:40px;\" |\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:40px;\" |\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:40px;\" |\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:40px;\" |\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:40px;\" |\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:40px;\" |\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:40px;\" |\n|-\n! style=\"background:#777777;\"|\n! style=\"background:;\"|\n! style=\"background:;\"|\n! style=\"background:#202056;\"|\n! style=\"background:#00ADEF;\"|\n! style=\"background:;\"|\n! style=\"background:;\" |\n! style=\"background:;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap;
