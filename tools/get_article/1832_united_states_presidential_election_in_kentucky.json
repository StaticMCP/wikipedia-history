Voters chose 15 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nKentucky voted for the National Republican candidate, Henry Clay, over the Democratic Party candidate, Andrew Jackson. Clay won Kentucky by a margin of 8.98%. His victory was likely influenced by the home state advantage he received from his native state. Kentucky and South Carolina were the only two states Jackson lost in 1832 that he had won in the previous cycle.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1832 United States presidential election in Kentucky\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n!  width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | National Republican\n| Henry Clay\n| align=\"right\" | 43,449\n| align=\"right\" | 54.49%\n| align=\"right\" | 15\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic\n| Andrew Jackson (incumbent)\n| align=\"right\" | 36,292\n| align=\"right\" | 45.51%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Totals\n| align=\"right\" | 79,741\n| align=\"right\" | 100.0%\n| align=\"right\" | 15\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Kentucky\nReferences"
