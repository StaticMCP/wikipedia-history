Lake Warren is divided into three stages: Warren I , Warren II , and Warren III , each defined by the relative elevation above sea level.\nOrigin\nLake Warren followed Lake Wayne.  It covered the basin of Lake Erie, part of Lake Huron, including Saginaw Bay and the lowland, which separates Lake Huron from Lake Erie. It included a part of the Lake Ontario basin and the lowland between Lakes Ontario and Erie.\nLake Warren included the Saginaw basin and the Huron-Erie basin.  Its outlet was through the Grand River to Lake Chicago. The beach stands at  above sea level west of the hinge line, unaffected by the isostatic rebound.  It is marginally above the outlet, at . Lake Warren was preceded by a lower stage, which had its outlet through the Mohawk valley.\nLake Warren came into existence when its waters were raised from Lake Wayne by an advancing ice front.  The ice both compacted the area where the melt water could be held, raising the water level, while blocking the lower outlet from Lake Wayne.\nSize\nLake Warren was about half the size of the present day Lake Erie, lying in the southern half of the basin.\nBeach\nThe beach rises to the north of the Grand River outlet at  per mile until it reaches  near Gladwin. It is also nearly  on the point of the \"Thumb\" in Huron county north of Bad Axe. The beach is horizontal from Lenox, in St. Clair county, around the west end of Lake Erie, then along the south shore through Ohio to the Pennsylvania line, a distance of . Between there and Batavia, New York, it rises  in the next .\nThe beach marks a lake level which lasted a considerable period of time, shorter than either the Arkona or the Lake Whittlesey durations. The delta deposits are not as extensive as Lake Arkona. Its shore deposits vary, where the lakebed was till or gravelly material, a gravelly beach was formed.  Where the lakebed was sandy it is a sandy ridge.\nLakes Warren and Wayne\nThe relatively strong but discontinuous multiple sand and gravel beach ridges occurring as close as 40 feet and as much as 100 feet below the Whittlesey strand line in western New York (between  are correlated with Glacial Lake Warren. These ridges occur at the foot of the Allegheny Plateau. They are frequently associated with deltas. The ridges are well developed in a few areas well beyond the Plateau in the Lakes Erie and Ontario lowlands. In many cases, the ridges and deltas are underlain by silts of Lake Whittlesey lakebed.\nSee also\nProglacial lakes of the Lake Erie Basin\n*Lake Maumee\n*Lake Arkona\n*Lake Wayne\n*Lake Whittlesey\n*Lake Warren\n*Lake Grassmere\n*Early Lake Algonquin\n*Lake Lundy and Dana\n*Early Lake Erie\n*Lake Erie\nReferences\n* Strand Lines and Chronology of the Glacial Great Lakes in Northwestern New York; Parker E.
