Activists in the state began working towards women's rights in the early 1850s, when two women's rights conventions discussed women's suffrage. A statewide group, the Pennsylvania Woman Suffrage Association (PWSA), was formed in 1869. Other regional groups were formed throughout the state over the years. Suffragists in Pittsburgh created the \"Pittsburgh Plan\" in 1911. In 1915, a campaign to influence voters to support women's suffrage on the November 2 referendum took place. Despite these efforts, the referendum failed. On June 24, 1919, Pennsylvania became the seventh state to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment. Pennsylvania women voted for the first time on November 2, 1920.\n19th century\n'' periodical, November 1895]]\n1850s\n1852\n* First state women's rights convention is held in West Chester.\n1854\n* The Fifth National Women's Rights Convention is held in Philadelphia.\n1860s\n1866\n* The Equal Rights Association formed in Philadelphia was created to support African American and women's suffrage.\n1869\n* December 22: The Pennsylvania Woman Suffrage Association (PWSA) was formed.\n1870s\n1871\n* Caroline Burnham Kilgore attempts to vote in Philadelphia, is denied and takes her case to court.\n1872\n* The Citizen's Suffrage Association is formed in Philadelphia where it affiliates with the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA).\n1876\n* Suffragists are denied a booth at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, but still manage to take the stage in front of an audience of 150,000 onlookers at Independence Square.
