      "text": "# Scars of War, Wounds of Peace\n\nScars of War, Wounds of Peace: The Israeli–Arab Tragedy is a book by historian and former Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, which examines the history of the Arab–Israeli conflict.\nThe book is notable for the challenges it offers to many of Israel's founding myths and also for its severe appraisals of Israeli policies over the half century before its publication. According to Ian Black, the point the book makes is that \"the Palestine conflict is a tragedy, not a crime, though crimes have been committed by both sides\".\nReferences\nPublication history\n* Ben-Ami, Shlomo (2005).
