The result was a victory for former president Leonel Fernández, who defeated incumbent Hipólito Mejía. Voter turnout was 72.8%.\nCandidates\n*Hipólito Mejía, serving president (2000-2004), representing the Dominican Revolutionary Party seeking immediate re-election.\n*Leonel Fernández, president from 1996 to 2000, representing the Dominican Liberation Party seeking a second (non-consecutive) term.\n*Eduardo Estrella of the Social Christian Reformist Party, a former senator and advisor to ex-president Joaquín Balaguer.\nOpinion polls in the run-up to election day showed Fernández leading with 54%, Mejía on 27%, and Estrella on 14%. In the previous weeks, however, Mejía had been gaining support while Fernández's numbers had been falling and, as a result, at one point it seemed possible that a second round run-off vote would have to be held between the two top candidates. Fernández's final result, in excess of 50%, meant that the second round was not necessary.\nOverseas voting\nThe Dominican Republic introduced legislation in 1997 to enable Dominican citizens residing abroad to vote in presidential elections. This was the first time the provisions of that law were put into practice, with some 52,500 registered overseas voters eligible to vote at polling stations set up in several American cities including Miami and New York, as well as Montréal, Caracas, Madrid and Barcelona.\nElectoral officials noted that 52,500 was only a fraction of the overseas voters actually eligible to vote (one million Dominicans are estimated to live in the United States alone), but that the take-up rate was hampered by a lack of information regarding the necessary formalities and by bureaucratic hurdles (particularly, the requirement that up-to-date national ID cards be presented).\nResults\n|party6=Independent Revolutionary Party|votes6=3994\n|cand7=Héctor Rafael Peguero Méndez|party7=Christian People's Party|votes7=3383\n|cand8=Raúl Pérez Peña|party8=Party for Authentic Democracy|votes8=1834\n|cand9=Ramón Emilio Concepción|party9=National Solidarity Movement|votes9=1450\n|cand10=Carlos Manuel Bencosme|party10=Dominican Social Alliance|votes10=1043\n|cand11=Ramón Nelson Didiez Nadal|party11=People's Democratic Party|votes11=772\n|invalid=43150\n|electorate=5020703\n|source=[http://resultadoselectorales.jce.gob.do/boletines/2004/Boletines2004/Boletines/B10.html JCE]\n}}\nReferences"
