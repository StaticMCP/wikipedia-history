      "text": "# History and culture of Thrippunithura\n\nThere are many stories that describe the origin of the word Thripunithura. Some latter day Sanskrit enthusiasts ascribe the origin of the name to \"Poorna Veda Puri\" - the town of Vedas in its entirety. Another possible origin to name comes from the meaning \"the land on the shores of Poorna river\".\nOther stories play on the pun of \"Pooni\" or \"Pooneeram\" which means quiver. One of them relates that Arjuna - one of Pandavas - who once visited Lord Vishnu was given an idol and Arjuna carried it in his \"pooni\" (quiver). While searching for a place to install it, he met Lord Ganapati and sought help. Ganapati found this place and the idol was installed. Another story of the same variety is as follows. At the end of Dvapara Yuga, the period of Lord Krishna, the Lord himself presented an idol to Arjuna, one of the Pandavas, and asked him to install it in a proper place. He kept the idol in a bag used to keep arrows, which was called Pooneeram in local language. When he reached the place, he shouted Pooneeram Thura means 'open the bag' in local language. Thus the name Poonithura has come, according to this story.\nWhen the Kings of erstwhile cochin Dynasty made this place their capital, the area where the palaces and the fort are constructed came to known as Thiru Poonithura as the word \"Thiru\" shows respect. It became Thripunithura\nBigger Temples\ned elephants during Sree Poornathrayesa temple]]\nSree Poornathrayesa Temple\nThripunithura is also known as the Land of temples.

Saint Mary's Jacobite Syrian Church (Nadamel Pally) is the oldest Christian Church in Thrippunithura. The Church was established in A.D. 1175. It is believed that a prominent Landlord of the region, namely Valamthuruthy Bhattathirippad donated a huge stretch of land to the local Christian families for the purpose building a Church. The Church came to be known as Nadamel Church as it was required to climb stairs (Nada in Malayalam) to reach the building. Following the arrival of European stream of Christianity, professed by the Portuguese, a split occurred in the parish and resulted in the formation of Saint Mary's Forane Church. Many other prominent Churches stand in the peripherals of Thrippunithura town.

One of the three Ayurveda colleges in Kerala is located at Puthiyakaavu near Tripunithura town. It also has attached hospital to it.\nOne of the famous celebration \"Atha Chamayam\" takes place in this town during Onam festival.\nHistory of Poornathrayesa Temple\nAccording to local folklore, it is said that Arjuna and Krishna requested Lord Ganesha to go ahead of them and select an appropriate place for the idol to be consecrated. Lord Ganesha travelled far and wide and finally reached a divine place which was the seat of the Vedas in its entirety[3] known as 'Poorna Veda Puri' which later became Tripunithura. Lord Ganesha was so pleased with the place that He chose a holy spot and seated there Himself. When Arjuna reached Tripunithura, he saw that Lord Ganesha has seated himself down in the place where he was to keep Lord Vishnu's idol. He requested Lord Ganesha to kindly move from there so that he may install the idol there.  Lord Ganesha said that He could not move from there. As he could not place the idol anywhere on the ground other than at the appointed spot, Arjuna had no other choice and it is said that he gave Lord Ganesha a kick which caused Lord Ganesha to turn southwards and placed the idol there. The Poornathrayesa Temple is the only temple where Lord Ganesha faces southwards. All other temples traditionally have the idols facing the east and/or the west. This temple grew into the beautiful and magnificent Sree Poornathrayesa Temple we see today.\nReferences"
