It is located at the southwest corner of Suffolk County Route&nbsp;14 (Indian Head Road) and NY 25A (Main Street) in Kings Park, New York.\nHistory\nOriginally known as St. Johnsland station when it was built by Charles Hallett of Riverhead for the Smithtown and Port Jefferson Railroad between November and December 1872, it was renamed Kings Park station in June 1891. The Kings Park area was the site of a major derailment on February 16, 1947, but there were no casualties. The station was rebuilt in 1948 with an attached freight storage area, and rebuilt again during the 1990s. Kings Park station also had a spur called the Kings Park Psychiatric Center Spur to the former Kings Park Psychiatric Center, which was originally built in 1896, and officially decommissioned in 1971, although trains were used to bring coal to the hospital until 1987. Today the right-of-way serves as the Kings Park Hike and Bike Trail, which leads to the Nissequogue River State Park.\nStation layout\nThis station has two high-level side platforms, each 12 cars long. On either side of the station, the tracks merge into a single track.\n{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=50|M\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=100|Mezzanine\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=675|Connection between platforms\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" rowspan=5 valign=top|PPlatform level\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Platform A, side platform\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Track 1\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|←  toward , , , , or  ()  toward  () →\n|-\n|Track 2\n|←  limited service →\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Platform B, side platform\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Ground level\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Exit/entrance and parking\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://arrts-arrchives.com/sthosp1.html Kings Park State Hospital Spur (Arrt's Arrchives)]\n*[http://trainsarefun.com/lirr/kingspark/kingspark.htm Kings Park Station History (Steve Lynch's LIRR Maps, Photos, Charts, etc.)] (TrainsAreFun.com)\n*[https://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=40.883823,-73.253682&spn=0.003885,0.013658&z=17&layer=c&cbll=40.883888,-73.253691&panoid=JThYRs1Tv-ovU9GnWk4_Lw&cbp=12,260.26,,0,-2.78 Station from Indian Head Road from Google Maps Street View]\n*[http://thelirrtoday.blogspot.com/2013/05/interlocking-walkthrough-fox.html FOX Interlocking (The LIRR Today)]"
