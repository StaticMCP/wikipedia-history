It recognized the best recordings, compositions, and artists of the eligibility year, running from September 1, 2020, to September 30, 2021. The nominations were revealed via a virtual livestream on November 23, 2021. The performers for the ceremony were announced on March 15, 24, and 30, 2022. South African comedian Trevor Noah, who hosted the previous ceremony in 2021, returned as host. The ceremony's location marked the first time the Recording Academy switched host cities for a single ceremony. This also makes it the first Grammy Awards ceremony not to be held in either New York City or Los Angeles since the 15th Grammy Awards in 1973 when it was held at the Tennessee Theatre in Nashville, Tennessee. It marked the first time the telecast took place in Las Vegas.\nJon Batiste received the most nominations with eleven, followed by Doja Cat, H.E.R., and Justin Bieber with eight each. Batiste received the most awards with five, and won Album of the Year for We Are. Silk Sonic won Record of the Year and Song of the Year for \"Leave the Door Open\", and Olivia Rodrigo won Best New Artist. The ceremony was originally scheduled for January 31, 2022, at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles; however, on January 5, 2022, the Recording Academy postponed the ceremony indefinitely due to health and safety concerns related to the COVID-19 Omicron variant. On January 18, 2022, the ceremony was rescheduled to April 3, 2022, and its location was moved to the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, due to resultant scheduling conflicts with the Crypto.com Arena.\nBackground\nThe nominations were announced during a virtual livestream on November 23, 2021, by Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr., alongside Jon Batiste, Billie Eilish, Finneas O'Connell, H.E.R., BTS, Måneskin, Tayla Parx, Carly Pearce, comedian Nate Bargatze, Recording Academy chair Tammy Hurt, and CBS Mornings anchor Gayle King.

Prior to the performance, a short video of Volodymyr Zelenskyy concerning the circumstances of warfare and military activity in Ukraine was played. Zelenskyy's appearance was seen by some as a way to make up for the rejection of the similar idea during the 94th Academy Awards the week before.\nIn Memoriam\nThe In Memoriam segment was introduced by host Trevor Noah, with Cynthia Erivo, Ben Platt, Leslie Odom Jr., and Rachel Zegler performing multiple songs by American composer Stephen Sondheim during the segment, including \"Somewhere\" (from West Side Story), \"Send in the Clowns\" (from A Little Night Music), and \"Not a Day Goes By\" (from Merrily We Roll Along).\n*Taylor Hawkins\n*Marilyn Bergman\n*Virgil Abloh\n*Gary Brooker\n*Walter Yetnikoff\n*Sarah Dash\n*Ken Kragen\n*Dottie Dodgion\n*Paddy Moloney\n*Jim Steinman\n*Biz Markie\n*Marília Mendonça\n*Clarence McDonald\n*Rusty Young\n*Connie Bradley\n*Stonewall Jackson\n*Roger Hawkins\n*Betty Davis\n*George Wein\n*Johnny Ventura\n*Lisa Roy\n*Charlie Watts\n*Wanda Young\n*Meat Loaf\n*Al Schlesinger\n*Lee \"Scratch\" Perry\n*Don Everly\n*Robbie Shakespeare\n*Michael Lang\n*Ronnie Spector\n*Ralph Emery\n*Young Dolph\n*Nanci Griffith\n*Jesse D\n*Mark Lanegan\n*Shock G\n*Vicente Fernández\n*Jeremy Lubbock\n*Tom Parker\n*Dusty Hill\n*Ethel Gabriel\n*Lloyd Price\n*Al Schmitt\n*Ron Tutt\n*Joe Simon\n*Malcolm Cecil\n*Jon Lind\n*Greg Tate\n*Elliot Mazer\n*Bobbie Nelson\n*B.
