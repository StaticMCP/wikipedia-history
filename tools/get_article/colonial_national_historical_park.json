It protects and interprets several sites relating to the Colony of Virginia and the history of the United States more broadly. These range from the site of the first English settlement at Jamestown, to the battlefields of Yorktown where the British Army was defeated in the American Revolutionary War. Over 3 million people visit the park each year.\nUnits\nColonial Parkway\nThe park includes the Colonial Parkway, a scenic  parkway linking the three points of Virginia's Historic Triangle: Jamestown and Yorktown and running through the historic district of Colonial Williamsburg. The Colonial Parkway is located in James City County, York County, and the city of Williamsburg.\nJamestown\nThe park includes the original site of Jamestown, known in modern times as Historic Jamestowne in James City County at the southern end of the Colonial Parkway. It encompasses the area of Jamestown Island, including the Jamestown Glasshouse. Adjacent to it is the Commonwealth of Virginia's complementary attraction known as Jamestown Settlement.\nYorktown Battlefield\nThe park operates the Yorktown Battlefield at the eastern end of the Colonial Parkway in York County at Yorktown. The Thomas Nelson House was built around 1724 and served as Cornwallis's headquarters during the final battle of the Revolutionary War.\nThe battlefield was the site of the British defeat. Both the house and the historic siege earthworks were restored in 1976. The Moore House is where surrender negotiations took place in 1781, located in the eastern part of the park.\nNearby are the state-operated American Revolution Museum at Yorktown and the Yorktown Riverwalk Landing area.\nGreen Spring Plantation\nWilliam Berkeley held the colonial governorship during the longest periods of any individual. He used his Green Spring Plantation as an experimental farm to develop sources of income for the colony other than cultivated tobacco and traded furs.\nCape Henry Memorial\nThe Cape Henry Memorial is at the site of the landing of Captain Christopher Newport and the Jamestown colonists in 1607. It is located in the city of Virginia Beach, Virginia at Cape Henry. It open to the public and is located off U.S. Route 60 on the Navy's Joint Expeditionary Base East.\nAdministrative history\nColonial National Monument was authorized on July 3, 1930. It was established on December 30, 1930. On June 5, 1936, it was redesignated a National Historical Park. The cemetery at Yorktown was transferred from the War Department to the National Park Service on August 10, 1933.\nJamestown National Historic Site is co-owned by the National Park Service and Preservation Virginia (formerly known as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities) and administered by the NPS, and was designated on December 18, 1940. Preservation Virginia owns  containing the remains of the original 1607 fort. The National Park Service owns the remaining  of the island which contains the archeological remains of the expanded town and its island plantation sites.\nAs with all historical areas administered by the National Park Service, Colonial National Historical Park and Jamestown National Historic Site are listed on the National Register of Historic Places of the U.S. Department of the Interior.\nSee also\n*Island Drive, a historic road within the park.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*Official NPS website: [https://www.nps.gov/colo/index.htm Colonial National Historical Park]\n**[https://www.nps.gov/came/index.htm Cape Henry Memorial]\n**[https://web.archive.org/web/20021020022347/http://www.nps.gov/colo/grnspg/gs_pg1.html Green Spring Plantation]\n**[http://www.historicgreenspring.org Friends of Green Spring] a large interactive web site with streaming video and essays (\"The voices of Green Spring\")\n**[https://www.nps.gov/jame/index.htm Jamestown National Historic Site]\n**[https://www.nps.gov/york/index.htm Yorktown Battlefield]\n**[https://www.nps.gov/york/index.htm Yorktown National Cemetery]\n**[http://freepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~cemeteryproject/Cemeteries/Virginia/Yorktown/Yorkinfo.html Yorktown National Cemetery - a roster and photo of burials]\n**[http://www.britishbattles.com/battle-yorktown.htm More information on the Battle of Yorktown]"
