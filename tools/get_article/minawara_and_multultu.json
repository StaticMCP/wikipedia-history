      "text": "# Minawara and Multultu\n\nIn Aboriginal mythology, Minawara and Multultu were the legendary ancestors of the  Nambutji tribe. They were a kangaroo that appear to have an human body, beside the body of human the rest are still kangaroo body part. They are part of a tribe that lives peacefully in their village, but until the Deities give their tribe a divine punishment because someone violated a sacred oath in the village. It causes the Deities fulled by anger and sent the Great Flood to sweep away their village. Minawara and Multultu were tossed here and there, carried by the waves that slaughterer their entire families, their memories and the place where they grew up. To the point where it finally stopped. They stopped with a pile of debris carried away by the Great Flood. They begin their long journey into the void, without direction or any kind of clues of where they should go or do. They been walking nonstop, no food neither drink, just them and their unbreakable determination to keep going. Along the way, they little by little lose their worldliness. Their noses are damaged because they are blocked too much by sand or anything else on their way. Their eyes no longer able to see anymore, because they don't even blink to stay awake, because they don't know when disaster will strike again. Their lungs and all their internal organs were destroyed. their bones are as hard as stone, their skin is as rough as trees that are thousands of years old, and various other things. However, none of the obstacles that occurred stopped them from continuing to move forward.\nReaching a point where determination alone could no longer sustain their lives, they continued their journey with unwavering resolve. However, they could not deceive their own bodies. Minawara and Multultu were unaware that their end was truly near, as their bodies had reached their limits. Minawara, as the elder sibling with a more mature and wise nature, sensed an instinct: that it was time to cease their aimless wandering. Minawara felt that this instinct should not be ignored. Finally, Minara stopped walking, embraced Multultu tightly, and took her last breath, officially ending their journey into the void. Until, Dream Time An era(?), an entity(?) that defies explanation and understanding by thought, the only way to describe it is by saying that Dream Time is the foundation of all Aboriginal mythology, as \"something\" that serves as a vessel for the madness contained within it. Minawara and Multultu suddenly found themselves in an empty place, with nothing around them—only them and a formless entity in front of them. The entity introduced itself as \"Dreamtime\" and offered them a choice: to end their journey here or to begin a new life as a new, better, wiser, and stronger Minawara and Multultu.\nMinawara and Multultu chose to start a new life, asking for the strength to become more powerful so they could protect each other. Dreamtime acknowledged them and granted them power, not because they asked for it, but because they deserved it. Minawara was given the ability to alter fate, while Multultu was granted the power to manipulate time at will. Their powers were like Yin and Yang from Chinese mythology. With Minawara's cleverness, Minawara created a unique power by altering it own fate. Minawara developed a force that allowed itself to unite with Multultu, becoming a single entity so profound that even Dreamtime was shaken by its presence. Eventually, they were appointed as the guardians of Dreamtime. When they merged, they were known as Minultu. Minultu is an entity that transcends thought, something that cannot be explained by logic. Minultu is depicted as a kangaroo with a human body, possessing wings that are black and white; although some also describe them as red and blue. Minultu is portrayed as wise, decisive, and responsible. Bearing the role of guardian with the power to overturn the order of the world, Minawara and Multultu stand on the side of good. With the titles: the Guardian of Dream Time and the Guide to the Dream Time.\nReferences"
