Winners are listed in bold and series' networks are in parentheses.\nThe top shows of the night were The Mary Tyler Moore Show, and Upstairs, Downstairs which won its second straight Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series. M*A*S*H led all shows with nine major nominations heading into the ceremony, but only won one award. The Mary Tyler Moore Show led all shows with five major wins. Upstairs, Downstairs became the first non-American drama to win the outstanding drama award twice and was the third win in five years for a British produced drama.\nThis is the 1st ceremony where one network received all the nominations in a Series category. It would not happen again until the\n39th Primetime Emmy Awards.\nWinners and nominees\nNote: Winners are indicated in bold type.\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'The Mary Tyler Moore Show (CBS)'\n** All in the Family (CBS)\n** M*A*S*H (CBS)\n** Rhoda (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'Upstairs, Downstairs (PBS)'\n** Kojak (CBS)\n** Police Story (NBC)\n** The Streets of San Francisco (ABC)\n** The Waltons (CBS)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'The Carol Burnett Show (CBS)'\n** Cher (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'An Evening with John Denver (ABC)'\n** Lily (ABC)\n** Shirley MacLaine: If They Could See Me Now (CBS)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'The Law (NBC)'\n** Love Among the Ruins (ABC)\n** The Missiles of October (ABC)\n** QB VII (ABC)\n** Queen of the Stardust Ballroom (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'Benjamin Franklin (CBS)'\n** Columbo (NBC)\n** McCloud (NBC)\n|}\nActing\nLead performances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Tony Randall as Felix Unger in The Odd Couple (ABC)'\n** Jack Albertson as Ed Brown in Chico and the Man (NBC)\n** Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce in M*A*S*H (CBS)\n** Jack Klugman as Oscar Madison in The Odd Couple (ABC)\n** Carroll O'Connor as Archie Bunker in All in the Family (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Valerie Harper as Rhoda Morgenstern in Rhoda'' (CBS) (Episode: \"Rhoda's Wedding\")'\n** Mary Tyler Moore as Mary Richards in The Mary Tyler Moore Show (CBS)\n** Jean Stapleton as Edith Bunker in All in the Family (CBS)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'Robert Blake as Tony Baretta in Baretta (ABC)'\n** Karl Malden as Detective Lt.
