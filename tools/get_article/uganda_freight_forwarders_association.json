The association embarked on the East African Harmonized Curriculum Training Program that has been the work of the Eastern Africa Revenue Authorities (EARAs) and the Federation of East African Freight Forwarders Associations (FEAFFA). The result of this project will be a mandatory practicing certificate known as the East African Customs and Freight Forwarding Practicing Certificate (EACFFPC) for all customs agents in the region.\nSee also\n* Transport in Uganda\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ugandafreightforwarders.com UEFA Website]"
