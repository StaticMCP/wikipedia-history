It was built in the early 1920s, and is a one-story, frame structure with wood shingles in the Colonial Revival style. It sits on a concrete foundation and has a gable roof and large, square brick central chimney. The front facade features a central pedimented portico with four square columns and two square pilasters.\nThe Harmon School was originally built to be used exclusively for students of the Nanticoke Indian Association until after a new public school was constructed in the 1920s. This was to accommodate all students of color (minority students) at a time of racial segregation in the state. When African American teachers and students became part of the new school, Nanticoke Indian Association parents withdrew their children and established the Indian Mission School for their separate education.\nLater the Nanticoke Indian Association adapted the Harmon School to serve as its Nanticoke Indian Museum. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\nFile:Harmon School 2 Millsboro Sussex Co DE.JPG\nReferences"
