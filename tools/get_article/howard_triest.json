He is most noted for serving as an interpreter on the Allied psychiatrist team during the Nuremberg trials.\nEarly and personal life\nTriest was born in Munich on March 29, 1923, to Ly/Lina (Westheimer) and Berthold Triest, the older of two children. His father was a businessman. After the Nazis came to power and antisemitism grew in Germany the Triests, a Jewish family, departed for Luxembourg on August 31, 1939, a day before the invasion of Poland. Attempting to travel to the United States, they could only afford to send Howie. His younger sister, Margot, went to Switzerland before moving to the United States. Ly and Berthold Triest, who were supposed to leave for the United States from Rotterdam the day Hitler invaded the Netherlands, were transferred to a French prison camp and eventually died either at or en route to Auschwitz.\nTriest eventually married Anita Triest. The couple had two sons.\nArrival in the United States and wartime service\nTriest arrived in New York in 1940, where he went to work at a tool factory. He attempted to enlist in the army several times but was denied on account of not being a United States citizen. He eventually succeeded in 1943 and obtained his citizenship shortly afterwards. He was posted to Europe, landing on Omaha Beach two days after D-Day as a machine gunner. He was eventually transferred to military intelligence owing to his knowledge of German.\nAfter his discharge in the summer of 1945, Triest joined the Department of War, where he was sent to Nuremberg as an interpreter, working for Leon Goldensohn and Douglas Kelley. He later interacted with and interpreted between psychiatrists and several top Nazi officials, including Hermann Göring, Rudolf Hess and Julius Streicher.\nDeath and legacy\nTriest died in Oak Park Michigan on May 11, 2016, at the age of 93. Triest later became the subject of a 2006 documentary Journey to Justice and the 2012 book Inside Nuremberg Prison by Helen Fry. He was portrayed by Leo Woodall in the 2025 film Nuremberg.\nReferences"
