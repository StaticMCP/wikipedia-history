It marked the end of the federalist revolt in Normandy and in Brittany.\nPrelude\nSince spring 1793 the National Convention had been split by rivalry between the Montagnards and Girondins, reaching the point of no return on 2 June, when the Montagnards (under pressure from the sans-culottes of Paris) voted for the arrest of the 29 Girondin deputies, who fled Paris and tried to start an uprising against the convention. Most of the departments simply sent a written anti-Montagnard protest to Paris, with only the Mediterranean coast, parts of Calvados (Caen) and Eure in Normandy (the rest of Normandy procrastinated or opted for a wait-and-see approach) and the areas around Lyon and Bordeaux opting for open revolt.\nThe Girondins placed Georges Félix de Wimpffen and Joseph de Puisaye in command of their forces. In early July their expedition set out from Caen for Paris, accusing the latter of being under the sans-culottes' control. Wimpffen was not with the small force (there were few volunteers since the harvest was imminent), mainly consisting of Bretons,  leaving it under Puisaye's command. It passed via Eure's main town of Évreux - Puisaye had commanded that town's National Guard and still had some support there. The force then headed for Vernon, Eure, a town of 4,500 people on the Seine, to cut off Paris' food supply. On 13 July Puisaye stopped in his nearby castle of Ménilles but ordered the army to continue. The inhabitants of Vernon were worried by the federalist advance, even more so as they had few troops or supplies to defend the town. Before the assault the federalists decided to stop off at the château de Brécourt 8 kilometres from Vernon.\nCourse\nThe château de Brécourt in 2018.\nHours passed and Vernon's inhabitants still did not see the enemy arrive, so instead went out to meet them. Arriving at the château de Brécourt, they fired their two perriers (their only artillery), sowing panic among the surprised federalists, who scattered and fled, withdrawing to Évreux then Lisieux.\nHistorians are astonished by how quickly the federalists were routed, especially as the inhabitants of Vernon only attacked with small forces. Puisaye's force may have been drunk after pillaging the château's wine cellars - Michel de Decker writes that the battlefield was full not of corpses but empty bottles.\nOn 14 April the Convention troops entered Pacy-sur-Eure, abandoning it on 15 April then reoccupying it on 16 April. The federalist force retired towards Bayeux.}}\nResults\nThe battle marked the end of the federalist revolt in Normandy, with the defeated troops scattering. Puisaye and others went into hiding, whilst Wimpffen and others retired to their estates and some of their former soldiers even joined the convention's forces, which advanced into an already peaceful Normandy against no resistance. This showed the lack of popular support for the federalist movement in Normandy and so on 2 August 1793 the revolts headquarters of Caen opened its gates. In the following months the popular societies and local administrations were purged of federalist sympathisers, with all blame placed on the Girondin deputies and moderation shown towards the other inhabitants of the province.\nReferences\nBibliography (in French)\n*\n* Michel de Decker, « Brécourt 1793.
