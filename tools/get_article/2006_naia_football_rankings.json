Once the regular season was complete, the NAIA sponsored a 16-team playoff to determine the year's national champion. A final poll was then taken after completion of the 2006 NAIA Football National Championship.\nPoll release dates\nThe poll release dates were:\n* August 16, 2006 (Preseason)\n* September 11, 2006\n* September 18, 2006\n* September 25, 2006\n* October 2, 2006\n* October 9, 2006\n* October 16, 2006\n* October 23, 2006\n* October 30, 2006\n* November 6, 2006\n* November 12, 2006 (Final)\n* January

the #1 ranking in the various weekly polls has been held by only a select group of teams. Through the postseason poll of the 2006 season, the teams and the number of times they have held the #1 weekly ranking are shown below. The number of times a team has been ranked #1 in the postseason poll (the national champion) is shown in parentheses.\nIn 1999, the results of a postseason poll, if one was conducted, are not known. Therefore, an additional poll has been presumed, and the #1 postseason ranking has been credited to the postseason tournament champion, the Northwestern Oklahoma State Rangers.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:40%;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#4169E1; color:white;\" |Team\n!style=\"background:#4169E1; color:white;\" |Total #1 Rankings\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||40 (4)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||23 (2)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|Sioux Falls (SD)||17 (1)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||12 (1)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||3\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|Saint Francis (IN)||3\n|}\nReferences"
