Founded in 1988, the museum displays historical photographs and artifacts from Encinitas and the entire San Dieguito area. San Dieguito historically comprises seven communities: Cardiff-by-the-Sea, Del Mar, Encinitas, Leucadia, Olivenhain, Rancho Santa Fe, and Solana Beach in the North County area of San Diego County and their adjacent areas, including parts of southern Carlsbad and northwestern San Diego. The museum is a nonprofit organization, primarily staffed by volunteers with limited paid staff.\nIt is supported by contributions from its members and the wider community at large.\nIn 1993, the museum published San Dieguito Heritage by Maura Wiegand (). In 1998, the museum received a $5,000 challenge grant from the Thomas C. Ackerman Foundation.[http://ackermanfoundation.org/index.php?id=38 Ackerman Foundation] In 2007, the Rotarians helped the museum improve its new location.[http://www.rotariansatwork.org/project5.html Rotarians At Work] The museum regularly provides visiting third-grade school groups with a special local history tour geared to their state-mandated curriculum. Several special events, including an old-fashioned community barbecue, are held during the year.\nHistory\nIn May 2008, the museum opened a ground-breaking new exhibit on skateboarding in the San Dieguito area. It was the first exhibit of its kind in southern California.  The most recent exhibit is the Bumann Ranch Exhibit.  It will celebrate the placement of the Bumann Ranch on the National Register of Historic Places and the contributions of the Bumanns to record and preserve the history of the Colony of Olivenhain in the San Dieguito region.\nPicture gallery\nImage:SanDieguitoHerit2.jpg\nImage:SanDieguitoHerit3.jpg\nImage:San Diego 006.jpg\nImage:San Diego 005.jpg\nHistoric Encinitas Photo Slide Show\n[http://californiacoastalimages.com/Historic_Encinitas_Photo_Slideshow/index.html Historic Encinitas Photo Slide Show]\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.sdheritage.org/ Official website]"
