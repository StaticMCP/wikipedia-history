Soon afterwards he quit the game and relocated to London. He had also played as a guest for Cowlairs in one competitive fixture: the final of the 1888 Glasgow Exhibition Cup, and scored in that victory too.\nStewart made two appearances for Scotland, in British Home Championship fixtures against Wales and Ireland. He featured once for the English amateur team Corinthian.\nNotes\nReferences"
