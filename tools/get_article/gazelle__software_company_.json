The new firm originally focused on printed circuit board exportation prior to game development. Cave co-founder Tsuneki Ikeda refused to join the company. According to Uemura, his former Toaplan CEO sold the company's IPs to both Gazelle and Raizing but doubted about the procedure's overall legality. During its existence, Gazelle developed three arcade titles for Banpresto, utilizing Atlus's chipset and platform: Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon, Air Gallet, and Quiz Bishōjo Senshi Sailor Moon: Chiryoku Tairyoku Toki no Un. The company also ported three Toaplan titles to fifth generation game consoles, among other projects. Prior to ceasing game development and closure, many of the company's staff later joined Cave and Raizing.\n* Published by Banpresto\n* Based upon Naoko Takeuchi's Sailor Moon shōjo manga and anime series\n}}\n}}\nNotes\nReferences"
