Established in 1996, the company is headquartered in Plano, Texas. With its commitment to leveraging remote work technology and a distributed workforce, Working Solutions offers scalable and flexible support across various industries. The organization’s mission focuses on delivering exceptional customer experiences through innovative service models and an engaged, professional remote team.\nHistory\nWorking Solutions was founded in 1996 by Kim Houlne with the vision of creating a flexible and efficient workforce solution for businesses. The company pioneered the concept of a remote workforce, harnessing technology to break free from the traditional brick-and-mortar call center model.\nOver the years, key milestones have defined Working Solutions’ evolution. These include the adoption of advanced cloud-based systems, expansion into new industries, and onboarding hundreds of thousands customer service professionals across North America. The company has also received recognition for its contributions to the remote work economy and has established itself as a leader in the gig work sector.\nServices\nWorking Solutions provides a diverse array of services aimed at meeting the customer service demands of its clients. These include, but are not limited to:\n* Business Process Outsourcing\n* Call center solutions\n* Sales support\n* Technical support\nThe company serves a broad range of industries, including retail, healthcare, financial services, and travel. Working Solutions distinguishes itself through its tailored approach, ensuring every client receives solutions customized to their specific needs. Its use of skilled independent contractors enables a cost-effective, responsive, and high-quality service model.\nBusiness Model\nWorking Solutions operates a business model focused on delivering flexible, scalable customer experience (CX) solutions through a network of independent contractor agents, often referred to as PROs. These professionals—located throughout the United States and Canada—work remotely as independent contractors, enabling the company to align its workforce dynamically with client needs. Instead of maintaining a centralized, brick-and-mortar operation, Working Solutions is structured as an entirely virtual contact center, distinguishing itself within the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry.\nThe company's approach leverages the gig economy by offering remote, on-demand opportunities for agents who set their own schedules—providing autonomy, work-life balance, and access to a wide talent pool. This distributed workforce model enables rapid scaling to handle seasonal peaks, unexpected increases in customer demand, or crisis events. For example, Working Solutions has deployed hundreds of agents within days to address urgent client needs during periods of disruption or rapid growth.\nKey features of the business model include:\n* On-Demand Contact Center Services: Working Solutions specializes in providing contact center outsourcing that can scale up or down in real time. This enables clients to manage volume surges, such as product launches or busy seasons, without compromising service quality or customer satisfaction.\n* Blended Technology and Human Expertise: The company incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) to automate routine tasks and support data-driven decision making. At the same time, skilled agents—“intelligent agents” (IA)—are assigned to more complex, nuanced customer interactions, combining efficiency with human empathy.\n* Customization and Brand Alignment: Services are tailored to match each client’s brand voice and operational goals. Agents are trained to provide support that reflects the client’s standards and priorities, ensuring a high level of customer satisfaction.\n* Advanced Analytics: Real-time monitoring and analytics are employed to track key performance metrics, detect trends, and optimize operations.\nThis model allows Working Solutions to deliver responsive, personalized, and cost-effective solutions across a variety of industries, including retail, travel, financial services, healthcare, and technology. According to third-party reviews on Glassdoor and Indeed, agents highlight the flexibility of remote work and the breadth of industries as advantages of the company’s model, though overall experiences vary.\nWhile the gig economy approach offers notable benefits such as flexibility and access to remote work, it should be noted that  it has also been subject to wider industry scrutiny and debate  independent contractors, including those working with companies like Working Solutions, typically do not receive traditional employment benefits such as health insurance, paid time off, or retirement contributions. This lack of guaranteed benefits can create challenges related to financial security and access to healthcare, especially for those who rely on gig work as their primary source of income.\nIncome variability is another concern frequently cited by both industry analysts and gig economy participants. Independent contractors often face fluctuations in available assignments, which can result in unpredictable earnings from month to month. Additionally, as independent contractors, workers are responsible for their own taxes, equipment costs, and professional development, which can further impact their take-home pay and overall job satisfaction.\nAdvocates of the gig economy highlight its potential for increased autonomy and opportunities for supplementary income. Critics, however, argue that the model can leave workers with fewer legal protections and long-term career stability compared to traditional employment arrangements. Industry observers continue to debate the balance between flexibility and worker stability as the gig economy expands within customer service and other sectors.\nCorporate Culture\nThe corporate culture at Working Solutions reflects its core values of innovation, flexibility, and inclusivity. The organization emphasizes work-life balance, specifically through remote work opportunities, allowing team members to achieve both professional and personal excellence.\nCommitted to diversity and inclusion, the company fosters a culture where people from all backgrounds feel welcomed and valued. Employee engagement initiatives and satisfaction levels are actively monitored and enhanced, contributing to a supportive and empowering work environment.\nImpact and Recognition\nWorking Solutions has contributed significantly to the customer experience industry and has helped shape the evolving landscape of remote and gig work. The company has been recognized by multiple independent organizations and media outlets for its business practices, leadership, and commitment to flexible, distributed work opportunities.\nIndustry Accolades and Media Mentions\n* BPO of the Year 2025 at Customer Contact Week (CCW): Recognized for excellence in customer experience innovation and complex support delivery.\n* FlexJobs Top Remote Companies: Working Solutions was named the #1 company for remote jobs on FlexJobs’ Top 100 list for 2024 and 2025, highlighting its leadership in the remote work industry.\n* Honored for Exceptional Customer Service: Recognized for outstanding customer service performance in 2023.\n* HFS Research Hot Vendor: Selected by HFS Research as a “Hot Vendor” for customer experience, reflecting innovation and high performance in the BPO sector.\n* Leadership Recognition: Founder Kim Houlne was named one of \"The 10 Most Powerful Women to Watch in Outsourcing Industry\" in 2022 by The Women Achiever, recognizing her influence and leadership within the sector.\n* Thought Leadership: Company leaders such as Tamara Schroer, Vice President of Education and Development, have been featured in industry interviews and professional development articles, contributing expertise on remote work practices and customer support training.\nEmployee and Contractor Feedback\nIndependent third-party platforms provide additional insights into Working Solutions’ culture and work environment:\n* Indeed: Employees have commented on the company's positive work-life balance, flexible scheduling, and remote work options. Reviews also mention commission-based compensation and the importance of self-management.\n* Glassdoor: The company maintains a rating of 3.9 out of 5 stars based on over 1,100 reviews, with many reviewers appreciating flexibility, supportive staff, and the variety of client programs. Some note challenges of working as an independent contractor and variability in available assignments.\nClient Results\nWorking Solutions’ case studies demonstrate successful partnerships across a range of industries, highlighting adaptability and performance in efficiency, operational effectiveness, and improved customer satisfaction. These outcomes reinforce its role as a client-focused outsourcing provider.\nControversy and Criticism\n3rd Party Scammers\nWorking Solutions has faced challenges related to third-party scammers who have impersonated the company to defraud job seekers. In these cases, unauthorized individuals have used Working Solutions' name, logo, and branding to offer fraudulent job opportunities, often requesting sensitive personal information or upfront payments from applicants. These scams have been reported across various channels, including email, social media, and websites designed to look similar to Working Solutions’ official platforms.\nThe company has responded by issuing public warnings on its website and social media, clearly stating that it never asks candidates for payment during the recruitment process and only communicates hiring decisions through verified channels. Working Solutions provides guidelines to help job seekers identify legitimate offers and encourages verification of any suspicious communications. Additionally, the company works to educate potential applicants about common scam tactics and offers resources for reporting fraudulent activity. Through these actions, Working Solutions aims to protect job seekers and maintain trust in its brand by promoting transparency and safety throughout its recruitment practices.\nCritiques of the Gig Worker Model\nDespite offering flexibility and access to remote work, the gig work model has been subject to wider industry scrutiny and debate. Independent contractors, including those working with companies like Working Solutions, typically do not receive traditional employment benefits such as health insurance, paid time off, or retirement contributions. This lack of guaranteed benefits can create challenges related to financial security and access to healthcare, especially for those who rely on gig work as their primary source of income.\nIncome variability is another concern frequently cited by both industry analysts and gig economy participants.
