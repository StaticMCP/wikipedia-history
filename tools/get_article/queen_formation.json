It preserves fossils dating back to the late Guadalupian Epoch of the Permian period.\nDescription\nThe formation consists of up to  of mostly sandstone, with some interbedded dolomite and anhydrite. It rests on the San Andres Formation, from which it is separated by an erosional surface showing karst features. The Queen Formation is overlain by the Seven Rivers Formation. The Queen Formation is part of the Artesia Group, which is interpreted as a sequence of shelf rocks of the Capitan reef.\nHistory of investigation\nThe unit was first named as the Queen sandstone of the upper San Andres Formation by Grant Blanchard and Morgan Davis in 1929. In 1937, W.B. Lang assigned the Seven Rivers Member to the (now abandoned) Chalk Bluff Formation. The unit was promoted to formation rank and assigned to the Whitehorse Group by Ronald DeFord and Russell Lloyd in 1940. The formation was assigned to the Artesia Group by D.B. Tait and coinvestigators in 1962.\nSee also\n* List of fossiliferous stratigraphic units in New Mexico\n* Paleontology in New Mexico\n\"\nFootnotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
