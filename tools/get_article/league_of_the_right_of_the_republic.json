The merger was decided when it became apparent that the merger between the League of Polish Families and the Self-Defense of the Polish Republic called League and Self-Defense would not take place. The coalition disbanded however very quickly after the elections.\nWell-known politicians\n*Marek Jurek, former Sejm's Speaker (Right of the Republic)\n*Roman Giertych, former Minister of Education (League of Polish Families)\n*Janusz Korwin-Mikke, (Real Politics Union)"
