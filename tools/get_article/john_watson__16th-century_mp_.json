There is no record of a marriage or children; however, his life is obscure, and it is possible that it was not the same John Watson who served for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Morpeth and Berwick-upon-Tweed.\nEducation\nWatson was educated at Lincoln's Inn, London.\nCareer\nHe was a Member (MP) of the Parliament of England for Berwick-upon-Tweed in 1547, Morpeth in October 1553, and Newcastle-upon-Tyne in November 1554.\nReferences"
