The Teutonic Knights, along with some crusaders, defeated the Old Prussians, which allowed them to continue further fortress constructions in the region of Sirgune. According to the chronicle, Swantopolk the Great had planned for the Prussian attack, and when they met their enemy at Sirgune, he set up roadblocks on the undergrowths behind the Prussians, and when the Prussians retreated, the crusaders destroyed them.\nReferences\n;Citations\n;Bibliography\n*\n*"
