This treaty included a land grant of farmable coastal land from Charles the Simple to Rollo in return for his fealty and protection against other Viking groups that had been regularly raiding the northern coastline. This treaty effectively changed how mainland Europe knew to resolve ongoing raids from the Vikings.\nHistory Before the Treaty\nCarolingian Ascension\nVikings had been raiding and plundering French lands since the age of Charlemagne. King after king among the Carolingian dynasty had tried but ultimately failed to stop these Viking incursions throughout the dynasties reign. Upon Louis the Pious death, his son Charles II the Bald took over. Charles II had immediately been thrust into a war against his brother Lothair. Lothair, who was the emperor at the time, ordered his Danish vassal to raid and plunder specific sites in Charles’ kingdom. Eventually, the Vikings became accustomed to easily obtained riches and could not be controlled resulting in them plundering whatever they wanted to, at any time they want. It got to a point where the Vikings had more of a say than the Danish King himself on where and when to raid. They hit modern day Normandy and Brittany in devastating fashion. The most important raid that occurred during his reign was when the famous Viking Ragnar attacked Paris. Charles tried to stop this plundering by force but, like his family before him, was not successful. He then opted for an approach to pay the Vikings off, but this only made the Vikings thirstier for plunder.\nAfter Charles II the Bald died in 877, there were 6 more rulers that had to deal with the Vikings up to the Treaty of Saint Claire sur Epte, with the last being Charles the Simple. The five rulers before him; Louis the Stammerer, Louis III, Carloman II, Odo of Paris, and Charles the Fat, had not done anything more significant than their predecessors to thwart these Vikings. Throughout the times of these six kings, the counts and dukes under the kingdom in West Frankia started to fortify their own lands heavily to counter these Viking attacks. Eventually, the Vikings raids would become much harder to accomplish as these smaller feudal lords protected their land well. Nonetheless, it has still been hundreds of years of Viking invasion and permanent settlements were bound to happen. In one case, a Viking leader named Rollo, who brought thousands of Vikings to raid, plunder, and settle had enacted a permanent settlement along the Seine River in the year 900. Just two years before this in 898, a new king had been crowned called Charles the Simple. Although a bit worrisome, the permanent Viking settlement was relatively peaceful and did not pose a real threat to Charles. It was until 911 when raiding resumed from Rollo that caused the real concern of the Viking threat again, but this time things were different. Charles and Rollo would face each other in battle near Chartres resulting in a close Viking defeat. Though weakened, the Vikings were still a formidable force, which resulted in a very unusual proposal by King Charles. Charles proposed that Rollo be baptized and granted land from the Seine River to the sea, along with protecting the kingdom from further Viking raids. This treaty would go on to be known as the famous Treaty of Saint Clair Sur-Epte.\nRollo's Exile from Denmark\nAs a young man, Rollo grew up in the Scandinavian region where he and his brother Gurim would become fighters. The story goes that Rollo and Gurim were having disagreements with the king of Denmark (called Dacia by Dudo of Saint-Quentin by mistake) and gathers up a group of men to confront the King of Denmark. Rollo makes a call to these men by saying that they must grow into becoming great men and that they need to imitate their fathers and grandfathers. He also says that the King is trying to step over them and attack the monarchy that they need to be ready and fight them and keep them at away from the land that the King rules over like enemies. From that point on Rollo, Gurim, and the men under them went to war with the King of Denmark. The war between the King and his men and Rollo, Gurim, and their men last over a year in which the King sends a message of peace to Rollo in which he says that we should not be at war with each other and that we should be able to hold each other with high regard and respect. The King says that we should allow the republic to be at rest so that he can hold what he believes is his and what his father fought for to keep. Rollo and his men like the sound of this idea so they agree to meet with the King for some sort of peace conference where they would exchange gifts and create an alliance. The King of Denmark breaks that agreement and sets up an attack on Rollo and his men during the night, upon their arrival. This ambush leads Rollo and his men to fall back into the local town near the King where they regroup and fight back. Rollo lost many men including his brother during the attack. After the attack from the King, he gathered what men he could and went to the island of Scania with six boats.\nFrom Sieging to Settling\nStarting from primitive tribes that formed small bands for hunting and food gathering. The Vikings evolved over time into a large group of roving bandits that sailed the coast of Europe and at the expense of the society in which they faced, gained substantial rewards from the act of plundering. While sailing through Frankish territory, it reached many notable cities during the height of their large-scale pillaging including Paris in 845 and 885. The outcome of Viking invasion ended in the often case of bribery on behalf of the Franks with valuables such as silver. Over time, demand for the loot gained from the plunders increased among the Viking tribes and this caused many to settle to ward off other Vikings as well as increase profits. On top of this, there was concern for overpopulation, political persecution, and conquest incentives that drove up the number of Viking migrants out of their native land.\nThe Treaty\nRollo in June 911 unsuccessfully laid siege to Chartres. He was defeated in battle on 20 July 911. In the aftermath of this conflict, Charles the Simple decided to negotiate a treaty with Rollo.\nThe Viking warlord Rollo laid siege on Chartres before Charles the Simple offered to make a peace deal. The proceedings were rocky; Rollo was originally offered Flanders, a stoney section of West-Frankia along the northern coast. Rollo denied this offer advocating for arable land. Charles’ changed quickly and Rollo became the first Duke of the land east of the Epte river while still being along the northern coast, which was far more farmable than Flanders. This land later became known as Normandy.\nCharles the Simple did not draw the short stick in this treaty. Rather, he benefited from having an alliance with Rollo, a successful warlord. King Charles gave this land to Rollo under the assumption that Rollo would become baptized and fend off other Vikings who had been continually battering the northern coastline of West Frankia; allowing Charles to focus on the conflicts that he was facing with nobles. While Charles was able to keep peace with the nobles for a while, he was only able to set back his deposition –not avoid it entirely –which occurred in 923.\nFormation of Normandy\nWith Norse bands of settlers, composed of non-aristocratic lineages, there came multiple communities formed and a new political ethos that was not Frankish. The Norsemen (\"Northmen\") came to be known as Normans in French. This identity formation was partly possible because the Norse were adapting indigenous culture, speaking French, renouncing paganism and converting to Christianity, and intermarrying with the local population.\nThe title of Duchy of Normandy was a role without precedent. The Scandinavian Rollo was an outsider among the Franks and his actions needed to be strategic to maintain the political power of this new position. The Treaty of Saint-Clair-Sur-Epte may have been another Carolingian tactic to ease Viking attacks and as author Letty ten Clair argues, possibly meant to be temporary. However, by choosing to assimilate and reinvent their cultural identity the Vikings and Rollo’s descendants created a greater succession than when events like this treaty had occurred before. Vikings were defined by their \"heathenism\" and their Paganism to distinguish them between the Natives and the invading Vikings. The Treaty of Saint-Clair-Sur-Epte granted the duchy to Rollo if he was baptized as a Christian abandoning his previous religion. Rollo understood that Franks would have animosity towards him, especially for his religion. Ademar of Chabannes wrote of Rollo as simultaneously beheading his captives in the name of his Pagan gods and donating to the established Christian churches in the name of  God. One of the most memorable accounts of the meeting of Rollo and Charles the Simple in 911 was Rollo being asked to bend down to kiss Charles’s foot. Rollo instead had one of his men do the task who knocked down Charles during the gesture. Author Alice Taylor argues, when Dudo wrote his account of the event, he instead exaggerated respectful gestures he described Rollo enacting towards Charles the Simple to create an image of submission. Although this account was likely exaggerated Rollo’s descendants did understand the importance of cultural assimilation by phasing out Pagan practices in favor of Christian ones, such as Rollo’s grandson William restoring Frankish monasteries.\nThe territory covered by the treaty corresponds to the northern part of today's Upper Normandy down to the Seine.The treaty allowed these new settlements, but not all Vikings were welcome. With the death of Alan I, King of Brittany, another group of Vikings occupying Brittany faced their own dispute. Around 937, Alan I's grandson Alan II returned from England to expel those Vikings from Brittany in a war that concluded in 939. During this period the Cotentin Peninsula was lost by Brittany and gained by Normandy.\nThere would be a convergence between Franks and Normans within a few generations. Political marriages played an important role in cultivating alliances and cohesion. While the Normans did adapt, adopt, and assimilate to Christianity, they did not necessarily adopt indigenous administration. Rather, the Normans \"adhered longer than the Franks around themto older forms of social organization\" that the Franks were abandoning. Ultimately the Treaty was long lasting as descendants continued to assimilate and the idea of submission to Carolingian ideals was already in place. The cultural integration and assimilation by the Scandinavians allowed Normandy to create its own cultural identity that ultimately marks the Treaty of Saint-Clair-Sur-Epte as the influential moment that started the evolution of Normandy’s power. With a strong national identity Normandy went on to conquer other nations within generations of Rollo’s first Ducal ruling.\nFrom Medieval to Modern\nOne reputable source on the Treaty of Saint Clair sur Epte is the Gesta Normannorum written by Dudo of Saint Quentin. His work was compiled of flowery poetry and stories glorifying the greatness of the Normans. Dudo’s accounts are rarely trusted as law but are imperative to understanding the cultural significance of this treaty between Rollo and Charles the Simple. Hired to write a narrative history for the Norman Dukedom, Dudo’s history helps modern historians understand the role of social relations and culture, giving key insights that modern historians have gone on to debate throughout history. These issues include, but cannot be limited to, the role of religion, military power, political power, and cultural values within Normandy, as well as West Frankia, and Europe as a whole.\nSee also\n*List of treaties\n*Saint-Clair-sur-Epte\nReferences"
