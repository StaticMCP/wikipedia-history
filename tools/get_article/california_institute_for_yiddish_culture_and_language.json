The institute owes its establishment to Miriam Koral, who is the Founding Director, and who, as a Yiddish instructor at UCLA and native Yiddish speaker, created the center and community that brings world-renowned Yiddish authors, playwrights, musicians, poets, artists and others to the Los Angeles area.\nSee also\n* Yiddishkeit\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://yiddishinstitute.org California Institute for Yiddish Culture and Language]"
