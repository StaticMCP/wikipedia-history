It features the thirteenth largest natural bridge in the world, carved from the white Permian sandstone of the Cedar Mesa Formation that gives White Canyon its name.\nThe three bridges in the park are named Kachina, Owachomo, and Sipapu (the largest), which are all Hopi names. A natural bridge is formed through erosion by water flowing in the stream bed of the canyon.  During periods of flash floods, particularly, the stream undercuts the walls of rock that separate the meanders (or \"goosenecks\") of the stream until the rock wall within the meander is undercut and the meander is cut off and the new stream bed then flows underneath the bridge. Eventually, as erosion and gravity enlarge the bridge's opening, the bridge collapses under its own weight. There is evidence of at least two collapsed natural bridges within the Monument.\nHistory\nHumans have lived in the area around Natural Bridges since as early as 7500 BCE, as shown by rock art and stone tools found at nearby sites. Around 700 CE ancestors of modern Puebloan people moved to the site, constructing stone and mortar buildings and granaries. These structures share similarities with those found in Mesa Verde National Park, which can be seen distantly, to the east, from the Bears Ears on the park's eastern border. Like the people of Mesa Verde, the residents of Natural Bridges seem to have left the region around the year 1270.\nEuropeans first visited the area in 1883 when gold prospector, Cass Hite followed White Canyon upstream, from the Colorado River, and found the bridges near the junction of White and Armstrong canyons. In 1904, the National Geographic Magazine publicized the bridges and the area was designated a National Monument on April 16, 1908, by President Theodore Roosevelt. It is Utah's first National Monument.\nThe Monument was nearly inaccessible for many decades as reflected by the visitor log kept by the Monument's superintendents. Reaching the site from Blanding, Utah, the nearest settlement would take a three-day horseback ride. The park received little visitation until after the uranium boom of the 1950s, which resulted in the creation of new roads in the area, including modern-day Utah State Route 95, which was paved in 1976.\nGeology\nLocated within the Colorado Plateau, the monument has three distinct bridges in White and Armstrong Canyons. These canyons were formed when the Colorado River eroded the Permian Cedar Mesa Sandstone.  The Sipapu, Kachina, and Owachoma bridges were formed through rock decay, weathering and erosion, as water cut through narrow canyon walls. The monument is also the location of significant Biological soil crust. In places, Desert varnish darkens the lighter White Cedar Mesa Sandstone. The Monument's elevation ranges up to .\nAttractions\nThe main attractions are the natural bridges, accessible from the Bridge View Drive, which winds along the park and goes by all three bridges, and by hiking trails leading down to the bases of the bridges. There is also a campground and picnic areas and a visitor center within the park. Electricity in the park comes entirely from a large solar array near the visitor center.\nIn 2007, the International Dark-Sky Association named Natural Bridges the first International Dark-Sky Park, which is a designation that recognizes not only that the park has some of the darkest and clearest skies in all of the United States, but also that the park has made every effort to conserve the natural dark as a resource worthy of protection. , Natural Bridges has the only night sky monitored by the NPS Night Sky Team that rates a Class 2 on the Bortle Dark-Sky Scale, giving it the darkest sky ever assessed.\nHorsecollar Ruin is an Ancestral Puebloan ruin visible from an overlook a short hike from Bridge View Drive. The site was abandoned more than 700 years ago but is in a remarkable state of preservation, including an undisturbed rectangular kiva with the original roof and interior, and two granaries with unusual oval-shaped doors whose shape resembles horse collars (hence the site's name).\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!

The Monument's pygmy rattlesnakes have been the subject of occasional study; several lizard species common to southern Utah are abundant. In May 2006, KSL Newsradio reported a case of plague found in dead field mice and chipmunks at Natural Bridges.\nNative plant species include willow, cottonwood, Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, pinyon pine, juniper, grasses, annuals, and perennials such as asters, penstemons, buckwheats, and Indian paintbrush, and various shrubs such as dwarf oaks, bayberry, manzanita, buffaloberry, rabbitbrush, black brush, brittle brush, Apache's plume, sage, yucca, and Mormon tea. Invasive species include tumbleweeds, certain thistles, dandelions, and tamarisk.\nMuch of the Monument's ground is covered in communities of cryptobiotic soil crusts, which prevents soil erosion and promotes the retention of soil nutrients.\nClimate\nNatural Bridges National Monument has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSk) with cold winters and hot summers.\n}}\nSee also\n*List of national monuments of the United States\n*Arches National Park\n*Dark Canyon Wilderness\n*Glen Canyon National Recreation Area\n*Manti-La Sal National Forest\n*Muley Point\n*Rainbow Bridge National Monument\n*Bears Ears National Monument\n*Hite, Utah\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n* by the National Park Service\n*[http://www.americansouthwest.net/utah/natural_bridges/national_monument.html Information] by AmericanSouthwest.net"
