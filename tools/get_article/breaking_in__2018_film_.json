The film follows a mother who must protect her children after the mansion of her recently deceased father is invaded by burglars.\nPrincipal photography began in July 2017 in Southern California. The film was released in the United States on May 11, 2018. It grossed over $51 million and received mixed reviews, with critics praising Union's performance but describing the film as having \"thinly sketched characters and a slapdash plot.\"\nPlot\nAfter her father Isaac's murder, Shaun Russell travels with her two children, Jasmine and Glover, to the house where she grew up. Shaun intends to settle Isaac's estate and sell the remotely located house, which has multiple security features, including a hand-held remote monitor. When they arrive, the security system is offline, but Jasmine reactivates it.\nUnknown to the family, four offenders – Peter, Sam, Duncan, and crime boss Eddie – were already in the house burglarizing it. Jasmine and Glover are taken hostage while Shaun is locked outside and escapes an ambush from Peter. Duncan, the most mentally unstable member of the group suggests torturing the children for the location of the safe but is objected by Eddie and Sam. Peter eventually chases Shaun into the woods and gets knocked out by her. She leaves him bound and gagged, and uses the intercom to call the house. Eddie tells her they only came for the safe and the $4 million inside; Isaac was under investigation by both the FBI and the District Attorney and liquidated his assets. The offenders have only ninety minutes from when they sever the phone lines before the security company contacts authorities, so they want to find it and leave quickly.\nConcealed in the trees, Shaun sees Maggie, the realtor, arrive with paperwork for the house sale. Eddie greets her at the door, explaining Shaun had gone to town, and attempts to invite her in. Maggie notices Shaun's purse on a table, realizes something is wrong and politely declines. When Maggie turns to leave, Duncan ambushes her and slits her throat, which outrages Eddie, as it means Shaun will not be as controllable.\nShaun finds her way into the house, and gives instructions to Jasmine. When Eddie and Duncan next threaten the children, Jasmine leads them to the safe, which Shaun believes only Peter knows how to open. Shaun returns with Peter, a knife at his throat, demanding her family's release. Eddie shoots Peter dead, and Shaun flees to the woods. Peter had a flash drive containing computer code on a necklace, which is all they needed to crack the safe. With all the money in a bag, Eddie intends to burn the house down with the children in it to cover their escape. Shaun creates a distraction by playing music with the portable hand-held security remote.\nDuncan and Sam find Shaun on the roof during another rescue attempt. She hears a gunshot go off inside the house jumps, and pushes Sam off to his death, saving herself with the rope she tied to the roof. Shaun takes Sam's truck keys from his pocket. Meanwhile, Jasmine frees herself and Glover, having cut through their bonds with a shard of glass from a broken lamp. The children escape the house and join their mother with Eddie in pursuit. Using Sam's truck, Shaun mows down Duncan while trying to drive away. However, Eddie blows out the truck tires, causing it to crash and foiling their escape.\nShaun and the kids lock themselves in the house, thinking it is all over until they discover the bag of money is still inside. Shaun's husband Justin arrives and Eddie attacks him, which convinces Shaun to unlock the door. He finds Shaun with the bag, doused in gasoline and holding a lighter. If he kills her, the lighter will ignite the bag. Eddie unloads his gun and Shaun lets him take the bag. However, Duncan appears and stabs Eddie to death, but instead of fleeing with the money, he goes after Shaun and threatens her and Jasmine. Jasmine arrives to help her mom, but Duncan overpowers her. He then prevents Shaun from taking his gun and demands if she has something to say. Shaun replies that he \"broke into the wrong house\", before swiping Duncan's knife from his pocket and using it to stab him to death.\nAs the police approach, Shaun goes outside to hold Justin and her kids close.\nCast\n* Gabrielle Union as Shaun Russell, the main character who tries to save her kids from criminals.\n* Billy Burke as Eddie, the crime boss behind stealing the money.\n* Richard Cabral as Duncan, one of the intruders.\n* Ajiona Alexus as Jasmine Russell, the teenage daughter of Shaun Russell and the older sister of her brother, Glover.\n* Levi Meaden as Sam\n* Seth Carr as Glover Russell, the younger brother of Jasmine and son of Shaun.\n* Mark Furze as Peter\n* Jason George as Justin Russell, the husband of Shaun and the father of Jasmine and Glover.\n* Christa Miller as Maggie Harris\n* Damien Leake as Isaac, Shaun's deceased father\nProduction\nPrincipal photography on Breaking In began July 2017 in Los Angeles and Malibu, California.\nUniversal Pictures released the first official trailer for the film on January 11, 2018.\nReception\nBox office\nBreaking In grossed $46.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $4.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $51.1 million, against a production budget of $6 million.
