It came into operation on 31 July 1957.\nThe Act made provisions for the nation of Federation of Malaya (formerly the Protected States of Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Perak, Perlis, Selangor, and Terengganu) and the Settlements of Penang and Malacca to gain an independent sovereign country within and become a member of the Commonwealth of Nations on 31 August 1957; prior to this, Federation of Malaya (formerly Malay States) had been a fully self-governing British colony.\nHistory\nThe Malayan Union came into being in 1946. It was established by British Malaya and comprised the Federated Malay States (Perak, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang), the Unfederated Malay States (Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, Terengganu, Johor) and the Straits Settlements of Penang and Malacca. In a series of agreements between the British and the Malayan Union, the Malayan Union was superseded by the Federation of Malaya on 1 February 1948.\nAfter extensive work to stabilize the political situation and reduce racial tensions, the British government finally ceded full autonomy to the Federation of Malaya on 31 August 1957, and the country achieved independence, led by the inaugural prime minister Tunku Abdul Rahman, who remained in office until 1970.\nSee also\n*Hari Merdeka (Independence Day)\n*Malayan Declaration of Independence\n*United Nations Security Council Resolution 125\nReferences\nExternal links\n* The UK Statute Law Database: [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/5-6/60/contents Federation of Malaya Independence Act 1957]\n*Chronological table of the statutes; HMSO, London. 1993."
