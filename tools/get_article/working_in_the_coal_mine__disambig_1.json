It was an international hit for Lee Dorsey in 1966, and has been recorded by other musicians including Devo in 1981.\nLee Dorsey original version\nAfter Toussaint returned to New Orleans from the U.S. Army, in which he served from 1963 to 1965.  He then he formed a production company, Sansu (also known as \"Tou-Sea Productions\"), with partner Marshall Sehorn.  He produced a number of singles performed by Lee Dorsey in 1965 and 1966, including \"Ride Your Pony\" and \"Working in the Coal Mine\".\nWritten, arranged and produced by Toussaint, the song concerns the suffering of a man who rises before 5 o'clock each morning in order to work in a coal mine.  He worked five days a week, where the conditions were very harsh and dangerous, but which offered the only prospect of paid employment. The singer repeatedly asked the Lord, \"How long can this go on?\" and complains that when the weekend arrives, he's too exhausted to have any fun. In the instrumental section, as in the song's fade, he says: \"Lord, I'm so tired / How long can this go on?\"   The song features the sound of a pickaxe clinking, as if the musicians were working in a mine.  Says producer Allen Toussaint \"There wasn’t as much percussion as you might think on there. It was a certain drummer and we had my brother hit the mic' stand with a drum stick for the pick sound. Those were the two percussion instruments.\"\nThe recording took place at Cosimo Matassa's Governor Nichols Street studio in the French Quarter of New Orleans. Musicians included guitarist Roy Montrell, drummer Albert \"June\" Gardner, and bassist Walter Payton.\nIt was a hit for Lee Dorsey, released on Amy Records (catalogue number 958), and entered the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 on July 23, 1966, eventually peaking at #8, while reaching #5 on the Billboard R&B chart.  It also reached #8 on the UK Singles Chart.\nToussaint said that neither he nor Dorsey had ever been down a coal mine: \"We didn’t know anything about a coal mine\".  He said of Dorsey:\n\"He was very good to work with. Very inspiring because he had such a happiness about him. He loved what he was doing when he was singing. He was a body and fender man when he wasn’t singing and even at his peak, when he would come off the road at the end of a successful tour, he would go and get into his grease clothes, his dirty work gear and go and work on cars. Straightening out fenders and painting bodywork. But really it was his finest hour when he was singing. He was a very good person for me to work with and he totally trusted me every step of the way.\"\nOver time, Dorsey's version of \"Working in the Coal Mine\" has been featured in many movies and television programs, including Where the Action Is (1966), ''Everybody's All-American (1988), Moonlighting (1988), Waiting for the Light (1990), Married... with Children (1990), The Wonder Years (1990), The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1993), Casino (1995), Secret Diary of a Call Girl (2010), Muppets Most Wanted (2014), The Simpsons (2019) and The Conners (2019).\nChart history\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1966–1967)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|U.S. Billboard Hot 100\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|-\n|US (Billboard) Best Selling Rhythm & Blues Singles\n|align=\"center\"|5\n|-\n|UK Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|}\nDevo version\n| writer        = Allen Toussaint\n| producer      = Robert Margouleff\n| prev_title    = Beautiful World\n| prev_year     = 1981\n| next_title    = Peek-a-Boo!\n| next_year     = 1982\n}}\nIn 1981, a Devo cover version was included as a bonus 7\" single packaged with their album New Traditionalists.
