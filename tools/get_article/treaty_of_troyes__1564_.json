When the French attacked, they were able to surprise the English at the critical strongpoint of Fort Nieulay and the sluice gates, which could have flooded the attackers, remained unopened. Thus Calais was regained by the French.\nIn spite of this, Elizabeth I, Mary's sister and successor, revived the English claim on Calais and took the French port of Le Havre in 1562 with support of the Huguenots, but the French troops ejected the English troops from France, and subsequently in 1564, an agreement was reached between England and France under which France paid England 120,000 crowns in return for English recognition of French control over Calais. This was likely done to gain France's support for the Dutch Revolt against Spain.\nReferences"
