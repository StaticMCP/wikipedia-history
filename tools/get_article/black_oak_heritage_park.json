It's unclear why the security were posted, but its assumed they were posted on behalf of the Windsor Port Authority to prevent dumping until the adjacent north woodlot could be cleared to make way for the Gordie Howe International Bridge.\nSecurity teams were no longer present beginning in April 2015.\n2014-2015 - Woodlot directly north of the park was cleared to make way for a new international bridge crossing.
