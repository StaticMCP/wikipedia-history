Distinguished by its exclusive practice of the Rite Opératif de Salomon, OITAR represents a unique approach to Masonic tradition that emphasizes spiritual development, symbolic work, and oral transmission of knowledge. As of 2023, the order comprises approximately 90 lodges organized into 11 territories, with a membership of nearly 2,000 Freemasons.\nHistory\nOrigins and Foundation\nThe genesis of OITAR can be traced to a profound reflection on Masonic practices initiated by Jacques de La Personne in the early 1970s. As the assistant grand orator of the council of order (1970-1971) and president of the ritual commission of the Grand Orient de France, La Personne became increasingly concerned about the simplification of Masonic ritualism, particularly in the practice of the French Rite through what was known as the \"cahiers bleus\".\nThis observation led La Personne to conduct extensive research in the Grand Orient's archives in Paris, where he studied historical documents relating to the ancient forms of the French Rite. These forms were directly descended from the \"Premiere Grand Lodge\" rite practiced by the Grand Lodge from London during the formative period of speculative Freemasonry (1717-1723).\nDevelopment of the Operative Rite of Solomon\nThe creation of OITAR was intrinsically linked to the development of the Rite Opératif de Salomon. In 1971, La Personne obtained permission from the Council of the Order to establish a new lodge within the Grand Orient de France called \"Les Hommes\" to experiment with this emerging ritual format. This lodge became a focal point for Masonic innovation, attracting members of the \"Ateliers Planètes\" and notable Masonic authors such as Daniel Béresniak.\nThe constraints of operating within the Grand Orient's framework soon became apparent. On December 24, 1974, nine brothers received a constitutive patent from the Grand Orient lodge \"Les Hommes\" and established the independent lodge \"Les Fondateurs,\" which would become OITAR's Mother Lodge with the designation \"No. 1.\" This development marked the beginning of OITAR as an independent Masonic Order, dedicated to preserving and developing the Operative Rite of Solomon.\nOrganizational Structure\nSovereign Lodges\nAt the foundation of OITAR's structure lies the sovereign lodge, operating with considerable autonomy while adhering to the Operative Rite of Solomon. Each lodge maintains complete authority over its internal affairs, including all decisions regarding initiation and affiliation. The lodges independently manage their work scheduling, quality control, and the reception of visiting Freemasons. Financial management and internal evaluation processes remain under the direct control of individual lodges, ensuring their sovereignty while maintaining adherence to the ritual standards of the order.\nTerritorial Organization\nThe order functions through a system of 11 territories, each under the administration of a Territorial Grand Master. These territorial bodies provide essential administrative support and ensure ritual consistency across their jurisdictions, while carefully respecting the fundamental sovereignty of individual lodges. A specialized administrative structure, known as the \"Territory of the Sextant,\" encompasses isolated lodges, including those operating in overseas territories and international jurisdictions, providing them with necessary support while maintaining their connection to the broader order.\nUniversal Supreme Council\nThe Universal Supreme Council stands as the ultimate guardian of the Rite Opératif de Salomon and determines the order's general orientation. Under the leadership of the Sovereign Grand Commander, who serves a nine-year term, the council fulfills crucial functions in the governance of the order. It maintains responsibility for issuing patents and diplomas, administering all nine degrees of the rite, and maintaining relationships with other Masonic bodies. The council also oversees the ongoing development and preservation of the ritual, ensuring its integrity while allowing for thoughtful evolution in response to the needs of the order.\nThe Rite Opératif de Salomon\nStructure and Degrees\nThe Rite Opératif de Salomon consists of nine degrees organized into three distinct orders, representing a progressive path of Masonic development. This structured system reflects the order's commitment to comprehensive spiritual and philosophical advancement.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto; text-align: center; background: #FFFFFF; border: 2px solid #36454F;\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background: #000080; color: white; font-size: 120%;\" | Structure of the Operative Order of Temple Builders\n|-\n! style=\"background: #4169E1; color: white;\" | Order Level\n! style=\"background: #4169E1; color: white;\" | Classification\n! style=\"background: #4169E1; color: white;\" | Degrees\n|-\n| style=\"background: #B0C4DE;\" | First Order(Operative Path - Five Degrees)\n| style=\"background: #B0C4DE;\" | Craft Degrees\n| style=\"background: #B0C4DE;\" |\n* 1.

The journey from Apprentice through the Sacerdotal Order represents both a personal transformation and a deepening engagement with Masonic symbolism and philosophy.\nPhilosophical Foundation\nThe philosophical underpinning of the rite draws from a rich tapestry of symbolic traditions. The Compagnonnage tradition provides a foundation in operative masonry, while biblical narratives, particularly the construction of Solomon's Temple, offer spiritual context. Additional depth comes from alchemical symbolism, ancient mystery traditions, Greek and Roman mythology, and elements of Pharaonic Egyptian symbolism. This diverse philosophical heritage creates a unique synthetic approach to Masonic spirituality and self-development.\nRitual Characteristics\nThe Rite Opératif de Salomon distinguishes itself through several distinctive characteristics in its ritual practice. The emphasis on oral transmission of knowledge stands as a central feature, with written supports prohibited during lodge discussions. This oral tradition reinforces the personal and experiential nature of Masonic knowledge. The requirement for unanimity in voting at the master's degree ensures thorough consideration and consensus in decision-making. The integration of operative and speculative elements creates a holistic approach to Masonic work, while the focus on personal transformation through symbolic work remains paramount throughout all degrees.\nPrinciples and Philosophy\nCore Values\nOITAR embraces traditional Masonic values while incorporating distinctive elements into its philosophical framework. The fundamental principles of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, shared with French Republican values, form the foundation of the order's ethical structure. These are complemented by the additional virtues of Friendship and Equity, along with Fidelity, Loyalty, and Obedience. The French conception of secularism, or Laïcité, plays a crucial role in the order's approach to spiritual matters.\nSpiritual Approach\nWorking \"To the Glory of the Grand Architect of the Universe,\" OITAR maintains an adogmatic approach to spirituality. The Grand Architect serves as a symbol of the absolute, infinite, and perfection, rather than requiring specific religious beliefs. This approach allows members to interpret this concept according to their personal philosophical orientations while maintaining a shared framework for spiritual exploration and development.\nSocial Engagement\nThe order encourages active social engagement while maintaining strict neutrality in political and religious matters. Members are encouraged to promote inalienable human rights and combat ignorance, intolerance, and fanaticism through their individual efforts. Engagement in humanitarian and charitable works forms an important aspect of members' external activities, as does contribution to social progress and human advancement. This social dimension complements the internal spiritual work of the order.\nInternational Presence\nOITAR maintains a significant international presence through a network of territories and lodges across multiple jurisdictions. As of 2023, the order operates through thirteen distinct territories spanning Europe, North America, and the Indian Ocean.\nDevelopment and Expansion\nOITAR's international expansion has followed a deliberate pattern of growth, beginning with its establishment in France in 1974. The first international expansion occurred in the 1980s with the establishment of lodges in French overseas territories. The 1990s saw further expansion into Quebec, strengthening the order's presence in North America. The most recent significant expansion was into Belgium in 2013, marking OITAR's growing influence in European Masonry.\nEach territory maintains significant autonomy while adhering to the core principles and practices of the Operative Rite of Solomon. This structure allows for cultural adaptation while preserving the essential characteristics of OITAR's Masonic tradition.\nFuture Development\nThe order continues to evaluate opportunities for expansion, particularly in French-speaking regions where cultural and linguistic ties facilitate the transmission of its ritual and philosophical traditions. The Territoire du Sextant plays a crucial role in this development, serving as an incubator for new lodges in regions where OITAR does not yet have an established territorial structure.\nSee also\n* Grand Orient de France\n* French Rite\n* List of Masonic Rites\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
