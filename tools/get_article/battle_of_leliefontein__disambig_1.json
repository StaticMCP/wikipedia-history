Three members of the Royal Canadian Dragoons were awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions during the battle.\nBackground\nIn November 1900, a British force advanced from Belfast towards the Komati River to push the Boer soldiers out of the area. The British force also included the second Canadian contingent to arrive in South Africa, including members of the Royal Canadian Dragoons, the 2nd Canadian Mounted Rifles and \"D\" Battery of the Canadian Field Artillery.\nLed by Major-General Horace Smith-Dorrien, the force arrived at the river on 6 November and drove the Boers from their positions. However, as resistance was stronger than expected, and because Smith-Dorrien had expected the Boers to be reinforced, he ordered his forces to set up camp at Leliefontein for the night, before beginning a withdrawal back to Belfast the following morning.\nThe Boers that withdrew from their positions in Komati later reconsolidated with reinforcements, having expected the British force to pursue them. The Boer force included the Ermelo Commando and  Carolina Commando. The Boers originally planned to intercept an advancing British force at a road south of the river. However, after the Boers realized that the British-Canadian force was not pursuing them and was withdrawing from the area, they advanced to attack the rear of the British-Canadian column.\nBattle\nof the Royal Canadian Dragoons, 1900. Lessard was tasked with covering the withdrawal of the British-Canadian force.]]\nA force led by Lieutenant-Colonel François-Louis Lessard, which included 90–100 men from the Royal Canadian Dragoons, two 12-pounder field guns from \"D\" Battery of the Canadian Field Artillery, and a horse-drawn M1895 Colt-Browning machine gun, was tasked with covering the larger force's withdrawal as its rearguard. The dragoons were deployed in a  line behind the withdrawing British column, with the horse-drawn machine gun at its centre.\nThroughout the morning, Boer forces assaulted the Canadian rearguard positions. At one point during the engagement, 200 mounted Boers charged the Canadian's positions in an attempt to break their line. A handful of Royal Canadian Dragoons repulsed the mounted charge, with assistance from the left section of D Battery under the command of Lieutenant Edward Morrison. The mounted charge almost captured a field gun, but a hastily organized ambush conducted by 12 men led by Lieutenant Richard Turner prevented the field gun's capture. Although Morrison was injured, the dragoons, assisted by the machine gun on their left flank, repelled the Boer assault.\nBoers then assaulted the position where the horse-drawn machine gun carriage was placed and eventually captured the position. However, Sergeant Edward Holland took the machine gun off its carriage and carried it away to prevent its capture, burning his hand on the gun's barrel in the process. During this fighting, machine gun fire killed two of the local Boer commanders, General Joachim Christoffel Fourie, and Kommandant Hendrik Frederik Prinsloo. Boer General Johann Grobler was also wounded during the engagement.\nDragoons under Lieutenant Hampden Cockburn defended their positions until the rest of the rearguard withdrew further behind them. However, as a result of the action, the dragoons under Holland's command were all captured, killed, or wounded; with Holland being captured and also sustaining injuries. Boer assaults on the Canadian positions persisted, although lacking the organization and momentum of earlier assaults due to the loss of the commanders. The two 12-pound field guns were used to fight a rearguard action until the Canadian soldiers reached the high ground, after which the Boers halted their attack.\nAftermath\n's Victoria Cross. Cockburn was one of three Royal Canadian Dragoons awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions at Leliefontein.]]\nAfter the battle, Smith-Dorrien wrote a letter to the British Chief of Staff, commending the successful rearguard action by the Royal Canadian Dragoons as well as Lessard's leadership.\nIn addition to commending Lessard, Smith-Dorrien also recommended to the Chief of Staff awarding the Victoria Cross to four members of the Royal Canadian Dragoons, and another military decoration to Lieutenant Morrison.\nThree members of the Royal Canadian Dragoons, including Sergeant Holland, Lieutenant Turner, and Lieutenant Cockburn were awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions at Leliefontein. The Royal Canadian Dragoons remains the only Canadian unit where three of its members were awarded the Victoria Cross in a single day. Private W. A. Knisley of the Royal Canadian Dragoons was also recommended for a Victoria Cross by Smith-Dorrien, although Knisley was not awarded the decoration. Lieutenant Morrison was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his actions during the engagement.\nThe two field guns that were involved in the battle are presently held by the Canadian War Museum.\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Greenhous, Brerton (1983).
