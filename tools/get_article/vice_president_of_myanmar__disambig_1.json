The offices were established by the 2008 Myanmar constitution and rank directly below the president. The offices came into effect on 30 March 2011, when the new government assumed de jure power and essentially function in the same manner as any other deputy head of state. There are two vice-presidential posts in the government, but no distinction is officially made between them. It can be assumed that the posts follow the order of seniority, much like the ones practised by the Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China.\nList of officeholders\nVice-presidents in Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma\nThe position of vice president of Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma was created in 1985 by two changes in the Constitution of Burma and in the basic law of the Burma Socialist Programme Party.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=2|\n! rowspan=2| Portrait\n! rowspan=2| Name\n! colspan=3| Term of office\n! rowspan=2| Political party\n! rowspan=2| President(s)\n! rowspan=2| Notes\n|-\n!
