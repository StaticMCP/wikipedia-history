It was established in 1951 by the second president of the Italian Republic, Luigi Einaudi.\nThe highest-ranking honour of the Republic, it is awarded for \"merit acquired by the nation\" in the fields of science, literature, arts, economy, public service, and social, philanthropic and humanitarian activities and for long and conspicuous service in civilian and military careers.\nThe order effectively replaced national orders such as the Civil Order of Savoy (1831), the Order of the Crown of Italy (1868), the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus (1572) and the Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation (1362).\nGrades\nInvestiture takes place twice a year – on 2 June, the anniversary of the foundation of the Republic, and on 27 December, the anniversary of the promulgation of the Italian Constitution. However, those awards on Presidential , related to termination of service or granted to foreigners, may be made at any time.\nThe badge, modified in 2001, bears the inscription  encircling the national coat of arms on the obverse and the Latin  (for the union of the country) and  (for the liberty of the citizens) encircling the head of Italia turrita on the reverse. The six degrees with corresponding ribbons are as follows (with numbers to 2 June 2020):\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n!Ribbon(1951–2001) !! Ribbon(since 2001) !!

Except in exceptional circumstances, no one can be awarded for the first time a rank higher than Knight. The minimum age requirement is normally 35.\nThe Knight Grand Cross with Collar is awarded only to heads of state.\nRecipients\nGrand Cross with Collar\n* Presidency of Luigi Einaudi (12 May 1948 – 11 May 1955):\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Date\n!Recipient\n|-\n|28 December 1952 ||  – King Paul I (1947–1964)\n|-\n|11 March 1953 ||  – President Getúlio Vargas (1930–1945; 1951–1954)\n|-\n|30 May 1953 ||  – Prince Rainier III (1949–2005)\n|-\n|16 July 1953 ||  – President Camille Chamoun (1952–1958)\n|-\n|6 October 1953 ||  Venezuela – President Marcos Pérez Jiménez (1953–1958)\n|-\n|16 November 1953 ||  – President Juan Domingo Perón (1946–1955; 1973–1974)\n|-\n|31 December 1953 ||  – President Theodor Heuss (1949–1959)\n|-\n|13 February 1954 ||  – President Paul Magloire (1950–1956)\n|-\n|31 July 1954 ||  – President Rafael Trujillo (1930–1938; 1942–1952)\n|-\n|6 September 1954 ||  – President Carlos Ibanez del Campo (1927–1931; 1952–1958)\n|-\n|17 November 1954 ||  Sovereign Order of Malta – Lieutenant Grand Master Fra' Antonio Hercolani Fava Simonetti (1951–1955)\n|-\n|6 December 1954 ||  – President René Coty (1954–1959)\n|-\n|12 February 1955 ||  – President Óscar Osorio (1950–1956)\n|}\n* Presidency of Giovanni Gronchi (11 May 1955 – 11 May 1962):\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Date\n!Recipient\n|-\n|11 May 1955 ||  – Former President Luigi Einaudi (1948–1955)\n|-\n|21 October 1955 ||  – Emperor Haile Selassie (1930–1974)\n|-\n|16 January 1956 ||  – President Juscelino Kubitschek (1956–1961)\n|-\n|5 June 1956 ||  – Former President Enrico De Nicola (1946–1948)\n|-\n|20 September 1956 ||  – President William Tubman (1944–1971)\n|-\n|15 November 1956 ||  – President Manuel Prado Ugarteche (1939–1945; 1956–1962)\n|-\n|18 January 1957 ||  – President José Figueres Ferrer (1948–1949; 1953–1958; 1970–1974)\n|-\n|6 March 1957 ||  Order of Malta – Lieutenant Grand Master Fra' Ernesto Paternò Castello di Carcaci (1955–1962)\n|-\n|11 March 1957 ||  — President Seán T.
