      "text": "# Next Syrian presidential election\n\nA presidential election in Syria is planned to take place within five years of the fall of the Assad regime in December 2024. Until then, Syria will be governed by a transitional government led by President Ahmed al-Sharaa.\nBackground\nIn May 2021, Ba'athist Syria under Bashar al-Assad conducted its final presidential election, which he won by a landslide with over 95% of the popular vote. The election was widely dismissed internationally as an illegitimate sham election marked by substantial electoral fraud. Assad ultimately did not complete his term; his government collapsed on 8 December 2024 following renewed Syrian opposition offensives led by Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham amid the Syrian civil war.\nIn March 2025, Ahmed al-Sharaa ratified an interim constitution for the transitional period, establishing Syria as a presidential republic without a prime minister and setting a five-year transition period.\nDate of the election\nShortly after the fall of the Assad regime, Hadi al-Bahra, president of the Syrian National Coalition, said that an 18-month transitional period was needed to establish \"a safe, neutral, and quiet environment\" for free elections, as outlined in the UNSC Resolution 2254. However, the newly declared president of Syria, Ahmed al-Sharaa, stated that elections would need at least four to five years to take place, citing the need to first re-establish the infrastructure for elections by holding a comprehensive population census and drafting a constitution, which he estimated \"may take two or three years.\"\nIn a meeting with al-Sharaa, French foreign minister Jean-Noël Barrot and German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock urged Syria's new leadership to avoid undue delays in holding elections.\nReferences"
