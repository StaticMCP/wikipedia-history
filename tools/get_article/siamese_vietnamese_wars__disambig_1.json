Several of the wars took place in modern-day Cambodia.\nThe political, dynastic, and military decline of the Khmer Empire after the 15th century, known as the Post-Angkor Period, left a power vacuum in the Mekong floodplains of central Indochina. United under strong dynastic rule, both Siam to the west and Vietnam to the east sought to achieve hegemony in the lowland region and the Lao mountains. The Siamese introduced — and Vietnam soon followed — the hostage system for Cambodian royals, who were relocated to their courts, actively undermining royal affairs and shaping future Cambodian policies. Eventually, territory was annexed by both powers, who conceived, maintained and supported their favorable Cambodian puppet kings. Actual combat mainly took place on Cambodian territory or on occupied lands. The 19th-century establishment of French Indochina put an end to Vietnamese sovereignty and to Siamese policies of regional expansion. Subsequent clashes of the two countries were not caused by regional rivalry, but must be viewed in the context of the 20th-century imperial policies of foreign great powers and the Cold War.\nPrelude\nThe roots of the conflict started at the beginning of the 14th century, when Tai people busily expanded their states and came to clash with established Vietnamese state in the east. During the latter centuries, as the Vietnamese expanding southward to the lower Mekong, they came to conflict with Cambodia and the Siamese state.\nList of Siamese-Vietnamese wars\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; width=95%\n|-\n! width=5% | No.\n! width=20% | Name\n! width=20% | Results\n! width=50% | Notes\n|-\n| 1\n| Sukhothai-Vietnamese War (1313)\n| Vietnamese victory\n| The Kingdom of Sukhothai attacked Kingdom of Champa, a vassal state of kingdom of Đại Việt from the mountains but was repulsed.\n|-\n| 2\n| Siamese–Vietnamese War (1717)\n| Siamese victory\n| Two large Siamese forces invade Cambodia in an effort to help Prea Srey Thomea regain the throne.

The Second Siamese army captures the Cambodian capital of Udong where the Vietnamese supported Cambodian king switches allegiance to Siam. Vietnam loses sovereignty over Cambodia but annexes several border provinces of Cambodia.\n|-\n| 3\n| Siamese–Vietnamese War (1771–1773)\n| Siamese victory\n|In 1769, King Taksin of Siam invaded and occupied portions of Cambodia. The following year a proxy war between Vietnam and Siam erupted in Cambodia when the Nguyễn Lords responded by attacking Siamese cities. At the outset of the war, Taksin advanced through Cambodia and placed Ang Non II on the Cambodian throne. The Vietnamese responded by recapturing the Cambodian capital and installing Outey II as their preferred monarch. In 1773, the Vietnamese made peace with the Siamese in order to deal with the Tây Sơn rebellion, which was a result of the war with Siam. Two years later Ang Non II was proclaimed the ruler of Cambodia.\n|-\n| 4\n| Siamese–Vietnamese War (1785)\n| Vietnamese victory\n| First Siamese invasion of Southern Vietnam  Decisive victory of the Tây Sơn force\n|-\n| 5\n| Cambodian rebellion (1811–12)\n| Vietnamese victory\n| Vietnamese forces restore Ang Chan to the Cambodian throne\n|-\n| 6\n| Vietnamese intervention in Lao rebellion (1826–1828)\n| Siamese victory\n| Vietnamese supported Anouvong to revolt against Siam but failed\n|-\n| 7\n| Lê Văn Khôi revolt (1833–1835) and Siamese–Vietnamese War (1831–1834)\n| Vietnamese victory\n| Second Siamese invasion of Southern Vietnam  Siam supports the revolt.
