Richardson, a World War II veteran who made his living in Connecticut's insurance industry, volunteered numerous hours of his time to find, measure and catalog large and interesting trees for the Notable Tree Survey of the Connecticut Botanical Society, which resulted in the publication of Glenn Dreyer's book, \"Connecticut's Notable Trees,\" in 1989. Richardson mapped out the trees in Hartford's Bushnell Park, Institute of Living, Elizabeth Park and Cedar Hill Cemetery. Over the years, Richardson also led numerous tree tours throughout the state of Connecticut.\nOn November 15, 2018, the Connecticut Forest and Park Association presented Richardson with an Official Statement issued by Governor Dannel Malloy, honoring Richardson's years of service to the trees of Connecticut.\nin Hartford, Connecticut (May 2015).]]\n, West Hartford, Connecticut (June 2013).]]\n(May 2015).]]\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://oak.conncoll.edu:8080/notabletrees/index.jsp Connecticut's Notable Trees]\n*[https://www.ctwoodlands.org/ Connecticut Forest & Park Association (CFPA)]\n*[http://elizabethparkct.org/gardens/trees-of-elizabeth-park Elizabeth Park Conservancy, \"Trees of Elizabeth Park Tree Trail\" video featuring Ed Richardson]\n*[https://loe.org/content/2012-09-07/trees.mp3 Living on Earth, PRI's Environmental News Magazine; Air Date: September 7, 2012; Segment: Bagging Big Trees (Bobby Bascomb)]"
