Haszard had taken over from his predecessor, Arthur Peters, following his death in January 1908.\nHaszard resigned as Premier in 1911 following appointment to the province's Supreme Court, and he was succeeded as Premier by H. James Palmer. Due to his designation as Premier, Palmer ran in a by-election in his district of 3rd Queens; traditionally, the Opposition does not run a candidate in these triggered by-elections, but the Conservatives did in the December, 1911 by-election and defeated Palmer in his own district.\nThe opposition Conservatives, led by John A. Mathieson, gained five seats in this election.\nParty Standings\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Party Leader\n!colspan=\"2\"|Seats\n!colspan=\"2\"|Popular Vote\n|-\n!1904\n!Elected\n!#\n!%\n|Liberal\n|Francis Haszard\n| align=right|22\n! align=right|17\n| align=right|15,488\n| align=right|51.6%\n|\n|John A.

This was a holdover from when the Island had a bicameral legislature, the General Assembly and the Legislative Council.\nIn 1893, the Legislative Council was abolished and had its membership merged with the Assembly, though the two titles remained separate and were elected by different electoral franchises. Assembleymen were elected by all eligible voters of within a district, while Councillors were only elected by landowners within a district.\nKings\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
