The intention of this offensive was not clear to the Russians, so they subsequently had to spread their main forces out to cover possible attack directions. One of these forces was the troops under  positioned at Oposhnya (Opishnia) on the river Vorskla to block any attempt by the Swedes to cross the river.\nBattle\nCharles intended to surprise Schaumburg and his 6,000 cavalry and force them off the location. He led 2,000–2,500 cavalry for this task and managed to catch the Russians completely off guard while they were having dinner. Charles immediately charged with his men and swept the Russian forces out of the town followed by a hot pursuit on foot. During the battle, Russian generals Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov and Karl Evald von Rönne also showed up.\nAftermath\nIn this action the Russians lost more than 450 men, the Swedes only 19. Perhaps more importantly however, the Swedes could now cross the river Vorskla. The offensive continued for a while and Charles reached Krasnokutsk where he forced another Russian army on the run.\nReferences"
