It is approximately 5 miles south east of the town of Frodsham.\nThe village is home to two primary schools &ndash; Kingsley St John's Church of England Primary School and Kingsley Community Primary School.\nHistory\nKingsley is first listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Chingeslie in the Roelau Hundred. The village is listed as having been held from Earl Hugh d'Avranches by a Saxon named Dunning. It has land for two ploughs, and home to five serfs, one villein, and three bordars. It also mentioned one and a half fisheries, four hays for roe deer, and a hawk's eyrie. The earl brought the woodland of one league long and one league wide into his forest. The forest mentioned was the ancient forest of Mara and Mondrem which was greatly reduced in size subsequently and is now known as Delamere Forest.\nIn 1260, the village was listed as Kingisleg. The name of the village ultimately derives from \"king's lea\" &ndash; the meadow of the king.\nThe village was for a long time known for its independence, as shown in its early Quaker meeting house, as well as its siding with the Parliamentarians during the English Civil War.\nGovernance\nKingsley was a township in Frodsham ancient parish. It was made a separate civil parish in 1866, having been made a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1853. It was originally in Eddisbury Hundred, and after the reforms of the 19th century, became part of Runcorn Rural District. It was also in Runcorn Poor Law Union and Runcorn Sanitary District until 1974, and in the borough of Vale Royal from 1974 to 2009.\nAn electoral ward in the same name exists. This stretches from Sutton in the north to Norley in the south. The total population of this ward taken at the 2011 Census was 4,222.\nReligion\nUntil the 19th century, the local parish church was that of St Laurence, at Overton in nearby Frodsham. In 1851 the red sandstone Anglican Church of St John the Evangelist was consecrated, having been built to a design of George Gilbert Scott, and in 1853 it became the village's parish church.\nThe current Methodist chapel, Hurst Methodist Chapel, was built in 1871. Between 1864 and 1967 there was a second Methodist chapel, Brookside Methodist Chapel.\nDemography\nPopulation\n* 1801: 661\n* 1851: 1067\n* 1901: 1066\n* 1951: 1503\n* 2001: 2026\n* 2011: 1986\nNotable residents\n*Paula Radcliffe\n*Bob Carolgees\n*Emily Speed\n*Luke Browning\nTransport\nThe nearest railway station is 3 miles away at Acton Bridge on the West Coast mainline for trains to Liverpool and Birmingham and links, via Runcorn and Crewe to intercity services.
