James Madison and William & Mary had claimed two titles, while College of Charleston, Delaware, and Towson each had one.  Former member East Carolina won 7 titles during their tenure in the conference.\nThe 2020 Tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and so no champion was crowned.\nSeeding and format\nThe CAA Tournament operates under a double-elimination format.\nTournament\n| RD1-score1=6\n| RD1-seed2=5\n| RD1-team2=\n| RD1-score2=5\n| RD1-seed3=3\n| RD1-team3=\n| RD1-score3=7\n| RD1-seed4=6\n| RD1-team4=\n| RD1-score4=3\n| RD1-seed5=5\n| RD1-team5=Towson\n| RD1-score5=3\n| RD1-seed6=6\n| RD1-team6=William & Mary\n| RD1-score6=7\n| RD2-seed1=1\n| RD2-team1=\n| RD2-score1=10\n| RD2-seed2=4\n| RD2-team2=\n| RD2-score2=3\n| RD2-seed3=2\n| RD2-team3=\n| RD2-score3=2\n| RD2-seed4=3\n| RD2-team4=Elon\n| RD2-score4=0\n| RD2-seed5=6\n| RD2-team5=William & Mary\n| RD2-score5=3\n| RD2-seed6=4\n| RD2-team6=College of Charleston\n| RD2-score6=8\n| RD3-seed1=1\n| RD3-team1=Northeastern\n| RD3-score1=4\n| RD3-seed2=2\n| RD3-team2=UNC Wilmington\n| RD3-score2=8\n| RD3-seed3=4\n| RD3-team3=College of Charleston\n| RD3-score3=6\n| RD3-seed4=3\n| RD3-team4=Elon\n| RD3-score4=2\n| RD4-seed1=4\n| RD4-team1=College of Charleston\n| RD4-score1=1\n| RD4-seed2=1\n| RD4-team2=Northeastern\n| RD4-score2=5\n| RD5-seed1=2\n| RD5-team1=UNC Wilmington\n| RD5-score1-1=5\n| RD5-score1-2=10\n| RD5-seed2=1\n| RD5-team2=Northeastern\n| RD5-score2-1=7\n| RD5-score2-2=11'''\n}}\nReferences"
