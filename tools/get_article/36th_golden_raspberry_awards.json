Razzies co-founder John J. B. Wilson has stated that the intent of the awards is \"to be funny.\". The satirical ten-category Golden Raspberry Awards, commonly known as the Razzies, were presented during the ceremony. The nominations were revealed on January 13, 2016. The ceremony was held on February 27, 2016, beginning at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. PST at the Palace Theater in Los Angeles, California.\nCeremony\nFifty Shades of Grey received the most awards, winning Worst Picture, Worst Actor, Worst Actress, Worst Screen Combo and Worst Screenplay. Fantastic Four tied for Worst Picture, also receiving Worst Director and Worst Remake, Rip-off or Sequel. Eddie Redmayne received Worst Supporting Actor for Jupiter Ascending, while Kaley Cuoco received Worst Supporting Actress for Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip and The Wedding Ringer. The Razzie Redeemer Award, given to former Razzie winners and nominees for quality work in film, was given to Sylvester Stallone for his Oscar-nominated role in Creed after receiving seven Razzie awards in the past. The winners were announced via parody sketches; one of them was performed by an impersonation of Donald Trump, who won Worst Supporting Actor at the 11th Golden Raspberry Awards in 1990. None of the winners or nominees attended the ceremony. Per tradition, the nominations announcement and the ceremony took place one day before their corresponding 88th Academy Awards ceremony. The Razzie Redeemer Award winner was decided through a public vote on Rotten Tomatoes, while the 943 members of the Golden Raspberry Foundation voted to determine the winners for the other categories. Membership is open to the public for a membership fee.\nWinners and nominees\n, Worst Picture and Worst Remake, Rip-off or Sequel co-winner]]\n, Worst Picture and Worst Remake, Rip-off or Sequel co-winner]]\n, Worst Picture co-winner]]\n, Worst Picture co-winner]]\n, Worst Picture co-winner]]\n, Worst Director winner]]\n, Worst Actor winner and Worst Screen Combo co-winner]]\n, Worst Actress winner and Worst Screen Combo co-winner]]\n, Worst Supporting Actor winner]]\n, Worst Supporting Actress winner]]\n, Razzie Redeemer Award winner]]\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n* 'Fantastic Four (20th Century Fox) – Simon Kinberg, Matthew Vaughn, Hutch Parker, Robert Kulzer, Gregory Goodman\n* Fifty Shades of Grey (Universal/Focus Features) – Michael De Luca, Dana Brunetti, E.
