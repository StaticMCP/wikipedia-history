Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Angola accepted the convention on November 7, 1991, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As of 2023, Angola has only one World Heritage Site.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (province)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Mbanza Kongo, Vestiges of the Capital of the former Kingdom of Kongo\n|\n| Zaire Province\n| 2017\n| 1511; iii, iv (cultural)\n|The town of Mbanza Kongo, located on a plateau at an altitude of 570 m, was the political and spiritual capital of the Kingdom of Kongo, one of the largest constituted states in Southern Africa from the 14th to 19th centuries. The historical area grew around the royal residence, the customary court and the holy tree, as well as the royal funeral places. When the Portuguese arrived in the 15th century they added stone buildings constructed in accordance with European methods to the existing urban conurbation built in local materials. Mbanza Kongo illustrates, more than anywhere in sub-Saharan Africa, the profound changes caused by the introduction of Christianity and the arrival of the Portuguese into Central Africa.\n|-\n|}\nTentative List\nIn addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. , Angola has listed three properties on its tentative list.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (governorate)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" | UNESCO criteria\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Kwanza Corridor-Cultural Landscape\n|\n|Bengo Province, Cuanza Norte Province, Malanje Province\n| align=\"center\" |2017\n| iii, v, vi, vii (mixed)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Archaeological site of Tchitundu-Hulu\n|\n|Namibe Province\n| align=\"center\" |2017\n| iii, v (cultural\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Cuito Canavale, site of liberation and independence\n|\n|Cuando Cubango Province\n| align=\"center\" |2017\n| iii, vi (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#D0E7FF;\"|Okavango Delta (Cubango-Okavango-Cuando-Zambezi catchments)\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\" |2025\n| vii, ix, x (natural)\n| This site covers protected areas (including Luengue-Luiana and Mavinga national oarks) around rivers that feed into the Okavango Delta, one of the largest inland delta systems in the world.
