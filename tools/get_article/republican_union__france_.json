The party's electoral lists also included notable activists and intellectuals like Louis Blanc (elected with 216,000 votes), Victor Hugo, Giuseppe Garibaldi, Edgar Quinet, Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau, Émile Littré, Charles Floquet, Georges Clemenceau, Arthur Ranc and Gustave Courbet.\nInitially on the extreme left of the Parliament of France, the group became close to the Opportunist Republicans of Jules Ferry in the late 1870s, causing a split of the far-left radicals led by Clemenceu. During the Gambetta government (1881–1882), René Goblet also broke away from the group to form the Radical Left.\nAfter the 1885 legislative election, the Republican Union's popularity decreased while the Opportunists to their right increased their votes. In 1894, one of the last prominent members of the group, Gustave Isambert, renamed the Republican Union as the Progressive Union and with an handful of deputies and senators continued to pursue Gambetta's goals. However, changes in the political system led to a need for a big party of all liberals and when the Democratic Republican Alliance was created in 1901 the Opportunists and the Progressive Union merged into it.\nElectoral history\nPresidential elections\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Election year\n!Candidate\n!No. of first round votes\n!% of 1st round vote\n!No. of second round votes\n!% of 2nd round vote\n!Won/Loss\n|-\n!1873\n|Jules Grévy\n|1\n|0.2%\n|colspan=2 bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|\n|Loss\n|-\n!1879\n|Léon Gambetta\n|5\n|0.7%\n|colspan=2 bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|\n|Loss\n|-\n!1885\n|Henri Brisson\n|68\n|11.8%\n|colspan=2 bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|\n|Loss\n|-\n!1887\n|Henri Brisson\n|26\n|3.0%\n|colspan=2 bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|\n|Loss\n|-\n!1894\n|Henri Brisson\n|195\n|23.1%\n|colspan=2 bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|\n|Loss\n|-\n!1894\n|Henri Brisson\n|195\n|43.0%\n|361\n|45.2%\n|Loss\n|}\nLegislative elections\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n|colspan=6|Chamber of Deputies\n|-\n!Election year\n!No. ofoverall votes\n!% ofoverall vote\n!No. ofoverall seats won\n!+/–\n!Leader\n|-\n!1871\n|Unknown (5th)\n|6.0%\n|}}\n|\n|\n|-\n!1876\n|1,359,435 (2nd)\n|18.4%\n|}}\n| 60}}\n|\n|-\n!1877\n|4,860,481 (1st)\n|60.0%\n|}}\n| 205}}\n|\n|-\n!1881\n|2,678,678 (1st)\n|37.3%\n|}}\n| 109}}\n|\n|-\n!1885\n|1,125,989 (2nd)\n|14.2%\n|}}\n| 121}}\n|\n|-\n!1889\n|2,974,565 (1st)\n|37.4%\n|}}\n| 133}}\n|\n|}\n*\nSee also\n* Democratic Republican Alliance\n* Sinistrisme\nReferences"
