The treaty ended the Anglo-Turkish War. The Porte (the Ottoman government) restored extensive British commercial and legal privileges in the empire. Britain promised to protect the integrity of the Ottoman Empire against the French threat, both with its own fleet and through weapons supplies to Constantinople. The treaty affirmed the principle that no warships of any power should enter the straits of the Dardanelles and the Bosporus. The treaty anticipated the London Straits Convention of 1841, by which the other major powers committed themselves to this same principle.\nNotes\nExternal links\n*[https://www.britannica.com/event/Treaty-of-Canak Treaty of Çanak] Encyclopædia Britannica\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20041015205313/http://www.bartleby.com/67/811.html The Encyclopedia of World History (2001)]"
