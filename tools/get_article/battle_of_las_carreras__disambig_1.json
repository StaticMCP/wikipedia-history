A force of 800 Dominican troops, a portion of the Army of the South, led by General Pedro Santana, defeated an outnumbering force of 10,000 troops of the Haitian Army led by Faustin Soulouque.\nBattle\nThe battle opened with a cannon barrage and devolved into hand-to-hand combat. As the remnants of the Haitian army retreated along the southern coastal road, they were under fire from a small Dominican squadron.
