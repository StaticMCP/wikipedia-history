The show also includes a series of large-scale events on the waters of the Neva River, such as rowing and motorboat races and a massive battle with pirates culminating in the appearance of a tall ship sporting spectacular scarlet sails.\nHistory\nThis tradition began in 1968, when several Leningrad schools united to celebrate at the end of the school year in connection with the symbolism of the popular 1923 romantic novel Scarlet Sails by Alexander Grin. During the first celebration, a brigantine with scarlet sails sailed along the English Embankment and the Admiralty Embankment towards the Winter Palace. The 1961 release of the film Scarlet Sails boosted the popularity both of the book and of the tradition.\nThe show has become the main part of the annual White Nights Festival celebration.\nIn 2010, public attendance grew to 3 million, with entertainers including such stars as the Cirque du Soleil, Mariinsky Ballet and Antonio Banderas.\n2020-21 saw virtual celebrations in view of COVID-19 pandemic. This celebration has returned since 2022.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.5-tv.ru/parusa/en/ Official site]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_ortCwVgtukBXQRAaL0cEd6EiewmTjNx Youtube channel]\n*2007 Scarlet Sails celebration in St. Petersburg: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vszbkuc0ffI part 1], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4bFs0hgiRk part 2], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ3Wv0xscJQ part 3], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPqMpURgJ68 part 4]"
