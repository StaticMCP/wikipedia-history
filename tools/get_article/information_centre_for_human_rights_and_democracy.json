It is run single-handedly by Frank Lu Siqing.\nA municipal court document obtained by Lu claims his information center was \"registered in Hong Kong by foreign hostile element Frank Lu Siqing.\"\nLu may be able to continue his operations legally as Hong Kong is governed under the one country, two systems policy.\nLu has been imprisoned in mainland China twice, first in 1981 for calling for freedom of speech and again in 1989 for supporting the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement.\nQuote\nExternal links\n*[http://www.hkhkhk.com Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy]—Chinese and English versions available\n*[https://www.hongkongfp.com/tag/information-center-for-human-rights-and-democracy/ Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy HKFP ]"
