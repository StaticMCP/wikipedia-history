Voters chose four representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nMississippi voted for the Whig candidate, William Henry Harrison, over Democratic candidate Martin Van Buren. Harrison won Mississippi by a margin of 6.86%. As of 2024, this is the only presidential election in American history in which Mississippi has voted for a different candidate than Alabama. This would also be the last time a Democrat (or Democratic splinter) candidate lost Mississippi until 1872.\nResults\n}}\nReferences"
