Frank summarized the message of his book: \"Bad government is the natural product of rule by those who believe government is bad.\" [https://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/08012008/profile3.html] Frank argues that certain elements of the Republican Party intentionally dismantled the government by many means, including turning public policy into a private-sector feeding frenzy. Frank describes the state of the federal government of the United States as analogous to a large group of privatized pigs feeding at the public trough, which was brought on by the privatization schemes engineered by the Republicans. This book follows Frank's New York Times bestseller, ''What's the Matter with Kansas?''\nExternal links\n*[http://tcfrank.com/books/the-wrecking-crew/ Thomas Frank's page for The Wrecking Crew]\n*[http://us.macmillan.com/author/thomasfrank Thomas Frank Publisher's webpage] (Henry Holt and Co.)\n*[http://us.macmillan.com/thewreckingcrew The Wrecking Crew's Publisher's webpage] (Henry Holt and Co.)\n*[https://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/08012008/profile3.html Bill Moyers interview with Thomas Frank]\n*[http://www.salon.com/books/int/2008/08/07/thomas_frank/index.html Salon.com Thomas Frank interview] \"Thomas Frank on the Bush administration: Sabotage by design\"\n*[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93253890 NPR Thomas Frank interview] \"Thomas Frank's Indictment of Conservatism\"\n*[http://www.democracynow.org/2008/8/8/the_wrecking_crew_thomas_frank_on Democracy Now Thomas Frank interview]\n*[http://www.nypost.com/seven/08032008/postopinion/opedcolumnists/the_right_way_122748.htm New York Post book review]\n*[http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2008808020401 Louisville Kentucky Courier-Journal book review] \"The Right in power\""
