The archives are primarily serving municipalities of Negotin, Kladovo, Majdanpek, and Bor. The Historical Archives in Negotin were established on March 8, 1952, as the City State Archives by the decision of the People's Committee of Negotin and they were renamed several times over the following years. They finally reintroduced the name of the Historical Archives of Negotin in 1996 when they expanded its territorial jurisdiction by incorporating the archival department in Bor.\nSee also\n* List of archives in Serbia\n* State Archives of Serbia\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.arhivnegotin.org.rs/ Official website]"
