It is a roughly rectangular two-story structure, built out of local stone, with a flat roof surrounded by a low parapet.  Its main facade faces west toward the Stone County Courthouse, with plate glass windows topped by awnings on the first floor, and four sash windows on the second.  The main entrance is in an angle at the street corner, with the building corner supported by a square stone post.  Built in 1924, it is believed to be the largest commercial building in Stone County.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Stone County, Arkansas\nReferences"
