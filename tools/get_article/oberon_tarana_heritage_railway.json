Opened on 3 October 1923, the line was lightly constructed, and included steep grades (1 in 25 or 4 %) and tight curves. It was operated by lightweight locomotives, mainly 19 class steam locomotives, and then 49 class diesels. It transported local seasonal vegetables, timber and livestock. Passenger services ceased in 1971, and freight services in 1979, with the line effectively closing then.\nRestoration\nThe restoration of the line is being undertaken in three stages, per the Railway's 15-year plan from 2020 to 2035:\n* Stage 1: Oberon to Hazelgrove\n* Stage 2: Hazelgrove to Carlwood\n* Stage 3: Carlwood to Tarana\nRolling stock\nIn May 2010, end platform carriages CBA850 and HLF854 were acquired on loan from the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum, as well as railmotor CPH13 from the Canberra Railway Museum. In May 2010,  locomotives 7307 and 7321 were purchased from Patrick Portlink.\nReferences\n*"
