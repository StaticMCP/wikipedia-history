It was active from 2009 to 2015, when the death of the organiser Peter Hartey led to its closure.  The 2015 event closed before the results were announced but anthologies drawn from the submission were published.\nThe name of the Poetry Prize was changed from MAG Poetry Prize to Poetic Republic Poetry Prize for the 2012 event.\nThe Poetry Prize 2012 and the Poetry Prize 2011 were supported by Arts Council England.\nThe Poetry Prize 2009 launched with no fixed prize fund. The prize fund accumulated in proportion to the number of entries. In 2011 this system was replaced by a guaranteed prize fund. The first three years of the Poetry Prize supported Mines Advisory Group with a donation of £1 per entry.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! 2015\n! Michele Crawford\n! \"The Zoo\"\n!
