The committee's mandate was to \"prepare an options paper describing 'the minimum constitutional changes necessary to achieve a viable Federal Republic of Australia, maintaining the effect of our current conventions and principles of government'.\" The committee was asked to consider issues such as\n* a name for a new elected head of state;\n* the method of selection for the head of state;\n* what powers he or she should possess;\n* the constitutional amendments and legal changes required to replace the Queen of Australia and Her Representative, the Governor-General of Australia by an elected head of state.\nRepublic Advisory Committee membership\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Part of Volume II was concerned with the international experience in moving from monarchical to republican headships of state. Six international reports were commissioned from local experts; four of the countries were former Commonwealth monarchies, while two had experienced their own regime change when their own monarchies (the Hohenzollerns in Germany, the Habsburgs in Austria) were replaced by republics.\nReports commissioned by the Republic Advisory Committee\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
