It is a Mission/Spanish revival style church built out of native fieldstone in 1930 to a design by Thompson, Sanders & Ginocchio.  It is an architecturally distinctive example of the work of Arkansas architect Charles L. Thompson, with transepts located near the front of the building (instead of the more traditional rear), and the angled parapet leading to the open belltower.  The building is now used by the parish as an academic facilities.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Sebastian County, Arkansas\nReferences\nExternal links"
