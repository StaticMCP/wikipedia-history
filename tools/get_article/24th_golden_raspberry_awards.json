Tied for second most-nominated, with eight each, were the Mike Myers holiday film The Cat in the Hat and From Justin to Kelly, a remake of Where the Boys Are inspired by the television series American Idol.\nAs with Bill Cosby on the 8th Golden Raspberry Awards and Tom Selleck on the 13th Golden Raspberry Awards, respectively, Ben Affleck did not attend the ceremony, but was quoted by the Associated Press as saying that he felt \"stiffed\" by the Golden Raspberry Awards committee, who did not send the prize out to him. Razzies founder John Wilson delivered the trophy to the studios of Larry King Live but Affleck was unimpressed and left it behind. Wilson retrieved the trophy and auctioned it on eBay. The trophy sold for $1700 which Wilson used to pay for the Ivar Theater for the 25th Golden Raspberry Awards the next year. Affleck went on to win the first Razzie Reedemer Award in 2014.\nWinners and nominees\n, Worst Actor winner and Worst Screen Couple co-winner]]\n, Worst Actress winner and Worst Screen Couple co-winner]]\n, Worst Supporting Actor winner]]\n, Worst Supporting Actress winner]]\n, Governor's Award for Distinguished Under-Achievement in Choreography winner]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
