It was founded in 2022 in Cincinnati, Ohio. The tournament is televised by the Golf Channel.\nAlly Ewing won the inaugural event with a final round 66 that included five straight birdies on the back-nine. It was the first time in over 30 years that an LPGA Tour event was played in southwest Ohio. The tournament increased its purse from $1.75 million to $2.0 million on May 16, 2023.\nMinjee Lee won the 2023 tournament by shooting a −16 and beating Charley Hull in a playoff.\nThe Kenwood Country Club has dropped as host for the 2024 tournament as ongoing course improvements have started. TPC River's Bend in Hamilton Township, Warren County, Ohio was selected as the tournament's 2024 venue.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year || Date || Champion || Country || Winning score || To par || Marginof victory || Purse ($) || Winner'sshare ($)\n|-\n| 2025 || Sep 14 || Charley Hull ||  || align=right|68-65-67-68=268 || align=center|–20 || 1 stroke || align=center|2,000,000 || align=center|300,000\n|-\n| 2024 || Sep 22 || Lydia Ko ||  || style=\"text-align: right; background: #ACE1AF\"| 67-66-69-63=265 || style=\"text-align: center; background: #ACE1AF\"|−23 || 5 strokes || align=center|2,000,000 || align=center|300,000\n|-\n| 2023 || Sep 10 || Minjee Lee ||  || align=right| 67-69-65-71=272 || align=center|−16 || Playoff || align=center|2,000,000 || align=center|300,000\n|-\n| 2022 || Sep 11 || Ally Ewing  ||  || align=right|69-64-67-66=266 || align=center|−22 || 1 stroke || align=center|1,750,000 || align=center|262,500\n|}\nTournament records\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Year||Player||Score||To par||Round\n|-\n|2022 || align=left|Lee Jeong-eun || 63 || −9 || 2nd\n|-\n|2023 || align=left|Nasa Hataoka || 63 || –9 || 2nd\n|-\n|2024 || align=left|Lydia Ko || 63 || –9 || 4th\n|-\n|2025 || align=left|Chanettee Wannasaen || 63 || −9 || 1st\n|}\nSource:\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.lpga.com/tournaments/kroger-queen-city-championship/overview Coverage on the LPGA Tour's official site]\n* [https://www.riversbendcc.com/ TPC River's Bend]"
