Since its release in 12-inch triple LP format, it has not been reissued and is considered a limited edition. The album chronicles 40 songs from Wonder's first Motown period, which precedes the classic period of his critically acclaimed albums.\nOverview\nBetween 1963 and the end of 1971, Wonder placed over 25 songs on Billboard Hot 100. Twenty-four of those — including \"Fingertips, Pt. 2\", \"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\", \"I Was Made to Love Her\", \"For Once in My Life\", \"My Cherie Amour\", and \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours\" — appear on Looking Back. In his early years, Wonder was often produced by Clarence Paul and/or William Stevenson and later by Henry Cosby. In 1970, Wonder started producing himself, beginning with Signed, Sealed & Delivered. Most of his singles were written by Wonder himself in tandem with a variety of others, or by Ron Miller.\nThis triple-album LP contains every major Wonder hit and many other singles from 1962–1971. A compilation which included material from this period was not again released until At the Close of a Century (1999). This compilation marks the first release of Stevie Wonder's 1967 original recording of \"Until You Come Back To Me (That's What I'm Gonna Do),\" which was a 1973 hit for Aretha Franklin.\nCritical reception\nIn a contemporary review, Russell Gersten of The Village Voice wrote that, although it suffers from some poorly chosen material and omissions, the album is ultimately an \"essential record\" that \"requires a bit more imagination and knowledge to appreciate than most anthologies, but the raw ingredients are there. Wonder worked in an era of excesses, and his fight to find meaning is—in its own modest way—uplifting.\" The newspaper's Robert Christgau shared a similar sentiment and said that Looking Back is at the same time \"flawed, long overdue, and essential.\" He later included it in his \"basic record library\" of 1970s albums, published in ''Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies.\nIn a retrospective review for AllMusic, writer Rob Bowman gave Looking Back'' five stars and said that Wonder's songs from the 1960s were unique from most other Motown artists because he had a hand in writing them and his producers rarely collaborated with acts such as the Temptations or the Supremes. J. D. Considine, writing in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (1992), gave the album four-and-a-half out of five stars and felt that it is a significantly better compilation than Greatest Hits Vol. 2 (1971) because of how it highlights both his studio albums up to that point and several non-LP singles.\nTrack listing\nSide one\n# \"Thank You (For Loving Me All the Way)\" – 2:30\n# \"Contract on Love\" – 2:02\n# \"Fingertips - Part 2\" – 2:52\n# \"Workout Stevie, Workout\" – 2:40\n# \"Castles in the Sand\" – 2:10\n# \"Hey Harmonica Man\" – 2:35\n# \"High Heel Sneakers\" – 2:58\nSide two\n# \"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\" – 2:53\n# \"Nothing's Too Good for My Baby\" – 2:38\n# \"Blowin' in the Wind\" – 3:45\n# \"Ain't That Asking for Trouble\" – 2:47\n# \"I'd Cry\" – 2:22\n# \"A Place in the Sun\" – 2:52\n# \"Sylvia\" – 2:33\nSide three\n# \"Down to Earth\" – 2:48\n# \"Thank You Love\" – 2:50\n# \"Hey Love\" – 2:44\n# \"Travelin' Man\" – 2:54\n# \"Until You Come Back to Me (That's What I'm Gonna Do)\" – 3:06\n# \"I Was Made to Love Her\" – 2:35\n# \"I'm Wondering\" – 2:52\nSide four\n# \"Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-Da-Day\" – (2:44)\n# \"You Met Your Match\" – (2:36)\n# \"I'd Be a Fool Right Now\" (New 1977 mix) – (2:53)\n# \"Alfie\" – (2:58)\n# \"More Than a Dream\" – (3:20)\n# \"For Once in My Life\" – (2:16)\nSide five\n# \"Angie Girl\" – 2:56\n# \"My Cherie Amour\" – 2:54\n# \"I Don't Know Why (I Love You)\" – 2:43\n# \"If I Ruled The World\" – 3:31\n# \"Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday\" – 2:57\n# \"Never Had a Dream Come True\" – 2:59\n# \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours\" – 2:46\nSide six\n# \"Heaven Help Us All\" – 2:59\n# \"I Gotta Have a Song\" – 2:32\n# \"Never Dreamed You'd Leave in Summer\" – 2:56\n# \"If You Really Love Me\" – 2:53\n# \"Something Out of the Blue\" – 2:58\n# \"Do Yourself a Favor\" – 5:58\nPersonnel\n*Stevie Wonder vocals, piano, harmonica, keyboards, clavinet, drums, bongos, percussion\n*The Andantes background vocals\n*Syreeta Wright vocals\n*Marvin Gaye drums\n*Larry Moses bass\n*The Funk Brothers instrumentation\nProduction\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Producer\n!Side one\n!Side two\n!Side three\n!Side four\n!Side five\n!Side six\n|-\n|Henry Cosby\n|\n|1, 2, 4, 5, 7\n|1, 2, 6, 7\n|1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n|1, 2, 4, 6\n|\n|-\n|Clarence Paul\n|1, 4\n|3, 4, 6\n|1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Stevie Wonder\n|\n|\n|\n|2\n|3, 7\n|2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n|-\n|William Stevenson\n|1\n|1, 2\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Hal Davis\n|5, 6\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Berry Gordy\n|3, 7\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Ron Miller\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1\n|-\n|Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier\n|2\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Johnny Bristol\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|5\n|\n|}\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Title\n!Information\n|-\n|Looking Back\n|\n*US Pop Albums (1977) #34\n*US Top R&B Albums #15\n|-\n|\"Castles in the Sand\"\n|\n*US Pop Singles #52\n*US Black Singles #52\n|-\n|\"Nothing's Too Good for My Baby\"\n|\n*US Pop Singles #20\n*US Black Singles #4\n|}\nCertifications\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n*"
