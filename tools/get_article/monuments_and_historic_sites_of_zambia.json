According to ICOMOS (see references), the NHCC's profile report, it lists over 4000 heritage sites in Zambia, including:\n* historic/architectural/buildings (over 384 sites)\n* historic sites (over 180 sites)\n* anthropological sites (over 189 sites)\n* engineering industrial structures (over 62 sites)\n* archaeological sites (over 2000 sites)\n* geomorphological sites, geophysical sites, palaeontological, ecology and other sites.\nHowever, only about 35% of the country's land area has been adequately surveyed for cultural heritage and, due to a shortage of funds, the condition of most of the listed sites is not known, however, the Commission with the assistance from Government has been making strides to ensure more sites are surveyed and opened to the public. So far out of the 4,000 cultural and natural heritage sites, 101 are declared National Monuments.\nUnder the National Heritage Conservation Commission Act of 1989, Section 27, heritage sites can be declared as 'National Monuments' by the Minister, and they then become protected and regulated by the details of the Act. They are listed below, grouped under various headings for ease of reference (these are not headings used in the Act).\nNHCC Declared National Monuments\nPrehistoric Monuments\n# Ayrshire Farm Rock Engravings, Lusaka\n# Chifubwa Stream Cave 6.4&nbsp;km from Solwezi at 12°13' S 26°25' E.\n# Gwisho Hot-Springs, Lochinvar National Park, Monze: Late Stone Age human skeletons from about 4,000 years ago.\n# Ing-ombe Ilede, Lusitu, is an archaeological site near the town of Siavonga, at 16°11' S 28°19' E.\n# Kalemba Rock Shelter, Chadiza District, with many rock paintings, at 14°7' S 32°30' E.\n# Kalundu Mound, Kalomo, site of a village from at least the ninth century until the twelfth century.\n# Kasamba Stream Grinding Grooves, Samfya — Iron Age site 1.6&nbsp;km south of boma where axes and iron implements were sharpened, at 11°20' S 29°33' E.\n# Kundabwika Rock Painting —  near Kundabwika Falls, 96&nbsp;km north-west of Mporokoso at 9°13' S 29°19' E.\n#Leopards Hill Cave, Lusaka District.\n# Libala Limestone, Lusaka next to Lusaka Primary School along Chilimbulu road.\n# Makwe Rock Shelter, Katete: Late Stone Age site which yielded many tools, (6000 years old) 3.2&nbsp;km S of Kondwelani School, at 14°24' S, 31°56' E\n# Maramba Quarry Site, Livingstone — first stratified site of the Middle Pleistocene Hope Fountain Culture in Southern Africa, north side of town.\n# Mkomo Rock Shelter —  Iron Age rock shelter and paintings, 64&nbsp;km west of Chipata at 13°54' S 32°12' E.\n# Mumbwa Caves — in Central Province these caves contain burial sites and evidence of iron smelting and  are the site of the Kaonde people's Musaka Jikubi Ceremony. 14°59' S 27°02' E.\n# Munwa Stream Rock Engravings —  in Mwense district at 10°29' S 28°40' E.\n# Mwela Rock Paintings, Kasama, 4.8&nbsp;km from centre, north of the Kasama-Isoka road at  10°10' S 31°13' E.\n# Nachikufu Cave, Mpika District  — 18,000-year-old rock paintings in a cave at 12°15' S 31°10' E.\n# Nachitalo Hill, Mkushi District — rock art 55&nbsp;km south of Ndola near Msofu mission at 13°32' S 28°59' E.\n# Nsalu Cave & Rock Painting, Serenje District —  12,000-year-old rock paintings 30&nbsp;km north of Kanona at 12°40 ' S 30°45' E.\n# Nyambwezu Rock Shelter, Mwinilunga District, at Nyambwezu Falls, with paintings similar to Chifubwa Stream Cave, probably about 3,000 years old, at 12°00' 25°10' E.\n# Rocklands Farm Rock Paintings 16.km SE of Chipata, two groups of rock paintings on the west side of Katotola Kopje.\n# Sebanzi Hill, Lochinvar National Park, Monze: 2.7&nbsp;km WSW of the ranch House, the site of a large Iron Age Village, apparently occupied by the ancestors of the Tonga tribe from about A.D. 1100.\n# Sutherland's Farm Site, Livingstone, including two former terraces of the Maramba River, the lower of which contains a home and workshop site of the Great Handaxe Culture.\n# Thandwe Rock Shelter, Chipata District, rock paintings, at 13°49' S 32°28' E\n# Twickenham Road Archaeological Site, Twickenham Road, Olympia Park, Lusaka.\n# Twin Rivers Kopje, 24&nbsp;km south-west of Lusaka.\n# Victoria Falls Trust Area Archaeological Sites, Livingstone — 5.6&nbsp;km west of town on north side of Sesheke road, Early to Later Stone Age sites which are the key for determining the Stone Age cultural sequence in the Upper Zambezi Valley\n# Zawi Hill Rock Paintings, 32&nbsp;km north of Chipata near Kamukwe Village.\nMonuments From The Colonial Era\n# Administrator's House, Kalomo — capital of North-Western Rhodesia, up to 1911.\n# Castle Hotel, Lundazi, built 1956.\n# Livingstone Memorial, Chitambo District — built in 1902 to mark the site where David Livingstone died in 1873.\n# Fort Elwes — fort with stone walls on the Congo Pedicle border north of Mkushi.\n# Fort Monze —  1890s, one of the earliest colonial police posts, 12&nbsp;km SSW of Monze.\n# Fort Young 21&nbsp;km SSE of Chipata on the Nsadzu-Mpezeni road at 13°50' S 32°40' E.\n# Mpongwe Fortified Camp, Mpongwe, consisting of a raised bank and double ditch constructed during a period of raiding into the area by the neighbours of the Lima people, probably about 1870 at 13°31' S 28°9' E.\n# Niamkolo Church, Mpulungu — the oldest surviving church building in Zambia, dating from 1895, near Mpulungu on Lake Tanganyika.\n# Nkala Old Boma —  built in 1901 as a fortified police camp, at the top of Kapilika Nakalomwe Hill just outside Kafue National Park.\n# Old Drift, Livingstone — the first colonial settlement dating from the 1890s, next to a good river crossing point;
