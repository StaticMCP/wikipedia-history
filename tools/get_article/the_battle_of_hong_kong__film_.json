The 1942 film was produced by the Japanese Dai Nippon Film Company, was directed by Shigeo Tanaka (田中重雄 Tanaka Shigeo) and featured an all-Japanese cast, but some Hong Kong film personalities were also involved in its making.\nAn anti-British propaganda film, The Battle of Hong Kong depicts Britons in Hong Kong as being in a state of \"spiritual degeneracy\" and inaccurately portrays them as discriminating against Japanese Hong Kongers prior to the outbreak of the Pacific War. This film is now lost.\nSee also\n* List of Hong Kong films\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
