A narrow white stripe runs from under the eye, at the corner of the mouth, to the base of the arm. The ventral surface is cream or yellowish, with golden reflections on the thighs and groin area. The male throat is speckled with a darker color. The skin is granular in the belly and femoral region, but smooth elsewhere.\nThe iris of the eye is golden, the eardrum is distinct, the vomerine teeth are absent, and there is a strong pectoral fold. There are disks on the fingers and toes, the fingers are slightly webbed, and the fringed fingers are about three-quarters of a palm. There is an inner but not outer metatarsal tubercle, and the second finger is longer than the first.\nEcology and behaviour\nMost abundant in grassland or marshy areas, but also occurs along permanent or semi-permanent streams, billabongs and floodplains. Breeding starts with summer rains and 10-24 eggs are laid on submerged vegetation in temporary pools. Males call from around the breeding site from elevated positions. The call is a \"wree-e-eck pippip\" with the second part of the call starting before the first part finishes. Tadpole metamorphosis takes 70 to 80 days.\nSimilar species\nThe northern dwarf tree frog is a member of the Litoria fallax complex, which includes also includes the eastern dwarf tree frog (L. fallax), Cooloola tree frog (L. cooloolensis) and Olongburra frog (L. olongburensis). All these species are similar in appearance (small,\nfile:Fogg Dam Nature Reserve- TREE FROGS, crop.jpg|At Fogg Dam, Northern Territory\nfile:Litoria bicolor.jpg|In rainforest at Kuranda, Queensland\nReferences"
