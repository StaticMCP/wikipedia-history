L. Davies excavated the site for the Department of the Environment.\nHe found traces of three rectangular buildings just inside the innermost west rampart.\nOf these successive timber buildings, the earliest may have been pre-Roman.\nThe second was occupied from the late first century AD to the mid second century AD, then burned down.\nAfter this the site was covered in a layer of Lias limestone rubble, then a third rectangular building was erected,  wide and at least  long, with a porch and doorway in the south west corner.\nThe third building seems to have been occupied until the late third century or the fourth century AD.\nThe defensive walls are now covered in thick vegetation.\nThe fort is scheduled as an ancient monument by the Ministry of Public Building and Works.\nNotes\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*|url=https://www.valeofglamorgan.gov.uk/files/Living/Planning/Policy/County_Treasures/Rhoose.pdf\n|title= Porthkerry – The Bulwarks|work=Vale of Glamorgan County Treasures - Rhoose|publisher=Vale of Glamorgan Council |date=2007|accessdate=2016-04-05}}\n*\n*|url=http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/img_fullsize/113907.jpg\n|title=The Bulwarks Camp Portkerry|publisher=Ministry of Public Building and Works|accessdate=2016-04-05}}\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
