The film was based on the 1933 Agatha Christie novel Lord Edgware Dies.\nTrevor reprised his role as Hercule Poirot for a third time, having previously played him in Alibi and Black Coffee, both released in 1931. Like them, it was filmed at Twickenham Film Studios. While the two earlier films are now lost, this production still survives.\nDuring Julius Hagen's tenure at Twickenham, the studios had specialised in production of murder mysteries as quota quickies. Although Hagen undoubtedly had ambitions for this film to be a more prestigious production, with a larger budget, the similarities to the studio's more routine output led most cinemas to show it as a second feature. The film's sets were designed by the art director James Carter.\nSynopsis\nHercule Poirot is hired by Lady Edgware an American actress who wants him to arrange a divorce from her aristocratic husband. In fact it turns out that Lord Edgware has already agreed to a divorce, only for him to be murdered the same night.\nCast\n* Austin Trevor as Hercule Poirot\n* Jane Carr as Lady Edgware\n* Richard Cooper as Captain Hastings\n* John Turnbull as Inspector Japp\n* Michael Shepley as Captain Roland Marsh\n* Leslie Perrins as Bryan Martin\n* C.
