Jerome says:\nThose books are known as the Books of Reigns in the New English Translation of the Septuagint.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.beblia.com/pages/main.aspx?Language=GreekModernFPB&Book=9&Chapter=1 Full text of the Books of the Kingdoms in modern Greek]\n\n---\n\n## Books of the kingdoms\n\n#REDIRECT Books of the Kingdoms"
