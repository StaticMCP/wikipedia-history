Incumbent Democratic Lieutenant Governor Bethany Hall-Long is term-limited and cannot seek re-election to a third term in office; she instead unsuccessfully ran for governor. The Democratic primary was held on September 10, in which state senator Kyle Evans Gay won the nomination. As Ruth Briggs King was the only Republican candidate who qualified, the Republican primary was cancelled.\nDemocratic primary\nCandidates\nNominee\n*Kyle Evans Gay, state senator from the 5th district\nEliminated in primary\n*Debbie Harrington, 2nd vice chair of the Delaware Democratic Party\n*Sherry Dorsey Walker, state representative from the 3rd district\nFailed to file\n*David Lamar Williams Jr., contract specialist and candidate for governor in 2020\nEndorsements\n}}\nPolling\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;\"\n|- valign=bottom\n!
