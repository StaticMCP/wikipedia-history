The term of the federal president is four years. The post was established in March 1994.\nThe election of the federal president consists of several activities. In electing the president and two vice-presidents of the Federation, at least one-third of the delegates of the respective Bosniak, Croat or Serb caucuses in the House of Peoples may nominate the president, and two vice-presidents of the Federation. After that, the House of Representatives needs to approve the president and vice-presidents, and after that, the House of Peoples has to confirm the decision of the House of Representatives by the majority of votes of all three caucuses.\nThe president can be dismissed from office after Federal Constitutional Court approves the request from the Parliament of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Before the request was sent, two-thirds of Parliament need to vote for it.\nList of presidents\nSee also\n*Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina\n*President of Republika Srpska\nReferences"
