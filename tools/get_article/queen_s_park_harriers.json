The club are one of nine London clubs that compete in the annual Summer League, an event that takes place across several London parks over the course of the summer months as well as several cross country championships in North London and Middlesex. It also organises the annual Liddiard Trophy Cross Country event.\nHistory\nThe roots of Queen's Park Harriers can be traced back to a group of students from St. Judes Institute, Queen's Park who formed a sports club including both athletics and football in 1884.  In 1886, the sports club merged with Christchurch Rangers to form Queens Park Rangers F.C., and in the following year \"Queen's Park Harriers\" was formed from those original members who wished to focus on athletics.Founded in 1887, the Queen's Park Harriers commenced its activities from the St Jude's Institute, Queens Park.  The club is the result of a division of the members of the Institute, one half forming themselves into the Harriers, whilst the remainder formed a football section which has since evolved into the now famous Queen's Park Rangers F.C.The club run in red and white horizontally stripped vests, known as \"The Danebury Hoops\", named after the racing colours of jockey and horse trainer Tom Cannon Sr.\nIn 1889, the club amalgamated with another local athletics club, West London Harriers, before merging with North London Harriers in 1897.\nAmalgamation of the North London and Queen's Park Harriers\nThe above popular cross-country packs have amalgamated, and in future will be known as the Queen's Park Harriers.  The colours will be changed for Tom Cannon's \"Danebury Hoops\" (red and white).From formation, as well as being an athletics club, Q.P.H. would also organise social events for its members including \"Smoking Concerts\".\nAfter the death of Mr E. J. Liddiard in 1946, the longest serving founding member of the club, the annual Liddiard Trophy Cross Country race was inaugurated on March 20, 1948 and continues to be run by club members at the local Fryent Country Park.\nIn 2021, the club was commended by England Athletics for their role in helping members of the local community stay active during the Covid pandemic lockdown stating:Queen's Park Harriers, based in north west London, have been a shining example over the last 12-months of harnessing the sport's strong community spirit, particularly during this challenging time.As of the 2024 event, long standing member William (Bill) O'Connor is one of only 6 remaining London Marathon 'Ever Presents', having run in all 44 events, starting with the 1981 event in a time of 02:35:52, at the age of 35.\nLeagues / Events\nThe club members compete in events throughout the year, focusing on road and track events in the spring and summer months, and cross country in the winter.\nThe events include, but are not limited to:\n* Summer League\n* Chiltern Cross Country League\n* North London Cross Country Championships\n* SEAA Masters Cross Country Championships\n* Middlesex County Cross Country Championships\n* Middlesex County Veterans Cross Country Championships\n* Southern Counties Cross Country Championships\nAssociated Clubs\nQueen's Park Harriers also includes a club for junior athletes (ages 7 to 16).\nThe junior club competes in the following leagues:\n* North West London Young Athletes Cross Country League\n* Middlesex Young Athletes League\nNotable Athletes\nOlympians\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=150|Athlete\n!width=200|Events\n!width=150|Games\n!width=200|Medals/Ref\n|-\n|Fred Carter || 10 miles walk || 1908||\n|-\n|Charles Dowson || 3 km walk / 10 km walk || 1920||\n|-\n|Eddie Toms || 4 x 400m relay||1924 ||\n|-\n|Mike Lindsay ||Shot Put / Discus || 1960, 1964||\n|-\n|Alan Lerwill ||Long Jump || 1968, 1972||\n|-\n|Pete Tancred ||Discus ||1976||\n|}\nCommonwealth Games\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=150|Athlete\n!width=200|Events\n!width=150|Games\n!width=200|Medals/Ref\n|-\n|Peter Browne || 800m || 1974 ||\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.thesummerleague.uk/ Summer League]\n*[https://www.chilternccl.co.uk/ Chiltern Cross Country League]\n*[http://www.british-athletics.co.uk/nwll/ North West London Young Athletes Cross Country League]\n*[https://www.myal.org.uk/ Middlesex Young Athletes League]"
