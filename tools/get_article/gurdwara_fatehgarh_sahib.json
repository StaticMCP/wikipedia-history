The gurdwara marks the 1710 conquest of the city by the Sikhs under the leadership of Banda Singh Bahadur. Sikhs captured the area and razed the fort built by Ferozshah Tughlaq to the ground.\nHistory\nTo commemorate the martyrdom of younger sons of Guru Gobind Singh, who were bricked-up alive in 1705 by Wazir Khan, the governor or fauzdar of Sirhind, a magnificent gurdwara was constructed.\nIt is the location where two youngest sons of Guru Gobind Singh Ji – 7 year old Fateh Singh and 9 year old Zorawar Singh – were betrayed by their cook and servant Gangu to the Mughal army, seized, asked to convert to Islam and when they refused they were buried alive under the orders of Wazir Khan. Their martyrdom on 9 December 1705 has been remembered by the Sikhs by naming the site as Fatehgarh after the youngest boy killed, and by building a large Gurdwara in 1843. The town is also the location where the Sikhs took revenge by capturing it from Wazir Khan in 1710 and killing him. However, the Sikh militia was defeated again few years later and the town remained in the control of Muslim rulers, including later an appointee of Ahmed Shah Durrani till 1764, when Khalsa recaptured it by defeating and killing the appointee Zain Khan.\nOther major Sikh Gurdwaras in the complex:\n*Bhora Sahib: the underground location within Fatehgarh Sahib Gurdwara where the two sons were buried alive.
