It was released in September 1984 and features nine tracks from the film, albeit with treatment and editing. The album spent over two years on the Billboard 200 chart. It was their first album to be distributed by EMI outside North America.\nLimited pressings of the original LP version featured a full-colour picture book wrapped around the album jacket; standard versions had many of the pictures (printed in black and white) and captions on the album's inner sleeve. The CD release of the album includes the full-colour book, but it rearranges the layout to conform to the dimensions of a square CD booklet (compared to the vertically oriented rectangular shape of the LP book). In 1999, a 16-track re-release—with content and sound closely matching those of the film—coincided with the 15th anniversary of the concert filming. An expanded 40th anniversary edition was released by Rhino Records in August 2023, marking the first official release of the complete concert recording, alongside a theatrical re-release of the film by A24. A tribute album, ''Everyone's Getting Involved: A Tribute to Talking Heads' Stop Making Sense, was released by A24 Music on May 17, 2024, featuring artists such as Paramore, Miley Cyrus, Lorde, The National, Girl In Red, Blondshell and BadBadNotGood.\nThe album was ranked number 345 on Rolling Stone'' magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In 2000, it was voted number 394 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. In 2012, Slant Magazine listed the album at No. 61 on its list of \"Best Albums of the 1980s\".\nBackground and recording\nFrantz stated in the liner notes of Once in a Lifetime: The Best of Talking Heads, \"When [\"Slippery People\"] was originally recorded on Speaking in Tongues, it had a funky and compact sound. This Stop Making Sense version is funky and big as a house. (Or should I say church?)\"\nReception\n| rev2 = The Austin Chronicle\n| rev2score =\n| rev3 = Chicago Tribune\n| rev3score =\n| rev4 = Mojo\n| rev4score =\n| rev5 = Q\n| rev5score =\n| rev6 = Rolling Stone\n| rev6score =\n| rev7 = The Rolling Stone Album Guide\n| rev7score =\n| rev8 = Spin Alternative Record Guide\n| rev8score = 7/10\n| rev9 = Uncut\n| rev9score = 9/10\n| rev10 = The Village Voice\n| rev10score = B+\n}}\n\"A bona fide classic,\" opined Neil Jeffries in a five-star review of the reissue for Empire, \"a perfectly measured snapshot of a widely loved and respected band playing at the height of their powers&nbsp;... No other band could do this. No other music movie soundtrack sounds this good.\" \"A timely reminder of the achievements of perhaps the most underrated band of the post-punk age,\" concurred Q. \"From its stripped-down intro&nbsp;... to the nine-piece finale, Stop Making Sense remains heady, stirring stuff.\"\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by David Byrne, Chris Frantz, Jerry Harrison, Tina Weymouth except as noted.\nSide one\n# \"Psycho Killer\" (Byrne, Frantz, Weymouth) – 4:28\n# \"Swamp\" – 3:50 (LP) 4:28 (cassette, CD)\n# \"Slippery People\" – 3:35 (LP) 4:13 (different mix; cassette, CD)\n# \"Burning Down the House\" – 4:14\n# \"Girlfriend Is Better\" (Byrne) – 3:32 (LP) 5:07 (cassette, CD)\nSide two\n# \"Once in a Lifetime\" (Byrne, Brian Eno, Frantz, Harrison, Weymouth) – 4:34 (LP) 5:34 (cassette, CD)\n# \"What a Day That Was\" (Byrne) – 5:08 (LP) 6:30 (cassette, CD)\n# \"Life During Wartime\" – 4:52 (LP) 5:52 (cassette, CD)\n# \"Take Me to the River\" (Al Green, Teenie Hodges) – 6:00\nFilm/Special New Edition Soundtrack\nBonus live tracks \"Heaven\" and \"This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)\" were available as B-sides on various US 7-inch and UK 12-inch singles during the album's original release.
