It is also very different from any other Romanian film we have seen. Romanian films in English are also Oh, Ramona and The Perfect Escape , but those films didn't  have only Romanian actors in the cast. Unfortunately, numerous problems inherent to the script, the direction and the technical aspects do not allow the film to become truly relevant in the Romanian history of film, of which, spoken in English or not, it is still a part. Maybe sometimes it's better to learn the rules before breaking them.\", commented a very mixed review at CineMagia (Romania).\nPalindrom found that, \"perhaps also to mark a specific and radical difference from the long line of \"miserabilist\" films that stubbornly show an ugly Romania. Having personally gone through the Hollywood school, Sabina Lisievici knows that the beauty of  images, the pure aesthetics, has its part in the success of any film, regardless of its theme.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
