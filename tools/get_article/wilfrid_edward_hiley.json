Beginning in 1908 he worked as a Demonstrator in the Experimental Garden of the Oxford Gardens. He received his M.A. from Queen's College, Oxford and later served on the University of Oxford's Board of the Faculty of Natural Sciences. He began his career as a botanist in the University of Oxford's School of Forestry. In 1919 his first book The Fungal Diseases of the Common Larch was published. Robert Scott Troup with Hiley as assistant gave a course in silviculture with excursions. In 1920 Hiley became a member of the Association of Economic Biologists (renamed in 1934 the Association of Applied Biologists).\nFrom 1926 to 1930 he was a lecturer in Forestry Economics at the Imperial Forestry Institute, Oxford (which in 1939 was renamed the Commonwealth Forestry Institute, Oxford). In 1931, after a visit to the United States to advise on the taxation of woodlands, he resigned from the Imperial Forestry Institute and became the manager of the 2000 acres of Dartington Hall woodlands. He retained the post of manager until his death in 1961. In 1947 he became the chair of Dartington Hall Woodlands Limited, upon its inception.\nIn forestry, the forest rotation, as used in Faustmann's formula, is the planned, approximate felling age of stands or trees. Hiley published a formula useful in estimating the effects of property tax on financial returns from forest rotation.\nHiley was often consulted for advice on forestry management. From 1923 to 1946 he edited the Quarterly Journal of Forestry of the Royal Forestry Society (RFS). He was elected in 1950 the president of the RFS, which awarded him its gold medal in 1961. He was also awarded the gold medal of the Society of Foresters of Great Britain, of which he was a Fellow. In 1956 he was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).\nSelected publications\nArticles\n*\n*  (letter to the editor)\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nBooks and monographs\n*\n* with Norman Cunliffe:\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n**\n*\n*\n*  (book completed by Leonard K.
