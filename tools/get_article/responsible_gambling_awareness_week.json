Both Tim Costello, Chairman for the National Churches Gambling Taskforce, and Dr Charles Livingstone, Senior Lecturer in the School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine at Monash University have criticised the week for involving rather than opposing the gambling industry. In 2013, Dr Livingstone pointed out that Responsible Gambling Awareness Week website had provided links that took a user directly to the websites for Tabcorp, Tatts Group and Crown Resorts.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://spreesports.com/ Sports Toto]\n*[https://safetotosite.net/ Topical Sport]"
