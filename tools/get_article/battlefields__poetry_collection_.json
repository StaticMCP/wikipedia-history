These pages, as might be expected, have the wistfulness of an aftermath garnered at eventide and tinged with the light of sunset...Her ear has never been dulled to \"the still, sad music of humanity\" by the glitter and clatter of this swiftly-moving age.\"\n''The Cambridge Guide to Women's Writing in English'' noted that the collection \"maintains earlier ambivalences towards warfare, but the balance here is less towards praising the heroism of war's soldiers (\"For Anzac (1939)\") and more toward attacking those addressed in \"To the War-Mongers\"...In a wider sense, however, Gilmore engages with other social and political battlefields.\"\nNotes\n* Dedication: To Hugh McCrae and Raynor Hoff\nReferences"
