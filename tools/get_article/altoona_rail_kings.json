In 1996, the Rail Kings finished 36-42. In 1997, they finished 22-14 in the Northern Division's first half, and 14-22 in the second. The Rail Kings were a formidable opponent during their time in Altoona, finishing second and third place in their respective leagues. They did make the playoffs, losing in two straight games to the Anderson Lawmen.\nWhen the Pittsburgh Pirates-affiliated AA franchise was awarded to Altoona, the Rail Kings relocated to Huntington, West Virginia, for the 1998 season—playing at the St. Cloud Commons, they retained the Rail King name but redesigned their logo to feature a crowned H rather than an A.\nThe Kings remained in the Heartland League. The Huntington Rail Kings did not finish the 1998 season, closing due to poor attendance. The Altoona Curve arrived in Altoona in 1999.\nToday, the Rail Kings name lives on at Blair County Ballpark, where the best seats are designated \"Rail King.\" The Rail Kings' mascot was R.K. Two other names considered for the team were used later by affiliated teams: the Spikes, now used by State College, and the Curve, used by the current AA team.\nPlayers for the initial season included:\n*Jeff Andrews\n*Eric Burroughs\n*Mike Cacciotti\n*Peter Dallas\n*Howard Hill\n*Mark Hilyard\n*Anthony Iasparro\n*Karun Jackson\n*Farley Love\n*Travis Maxwell\n*Carlos Mirabal\n*Tim Mitchell\n*Paul Neatrour\n*Manny Perez\n*Billy Reed\n*Stanley Scales\n*Ray Schmittle\n*Anthony Sharer\n*John Smith\n*Doug Smyly\n*Tony Webster\n*Eric Yelding\n*Tommy Seasoltz (batboy)\nManagement included:\n*Owner/President: Eric Reichert\n*General Manager: Mike Richmond\n*Director of Media Relations: Dave Shannon\n*Director of Sales and Marketing: Shawn McIntire\n*Account Executive: Eddie Depp\n*Manager: Tommy Hearn\n*Coach: Michael Richmond\n*Athletic trainer:Bryant Musselman\nReferences"
