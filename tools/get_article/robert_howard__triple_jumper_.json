Howard (November 26, 1975 – August 14, 2004) was an American triple and long jumper, a nine-time NCAA collegiate champion, and murderer.\nCollegiate career\nIn choosing a college, Howard elected to follow in the lengthy horizontal jumping tradition at the University of Arkansas, where he would follow in the footsteps of such luminary jumpers as Mike Conley, Sr., Edrick Floreal, Jérôme Romain, Brian Wellman and Erick Walder.\nPutting his own stamp on the track program, Howard won nine individual collegiate championships while jumping for Arkansas:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n!

In 1997, he was named Collegiate Athlete of the Year by Track and Field News magazine for winning all four jumps in the two NCAA championship competitions.\nAll of Howard's personal records were set while he was a collegian:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n!

He finished seventh in 1996 and eighth in 2000.  He won the triple jump competition at the 2000 Olympic Trials with a leap of 55-9 (16.99).  His best finish in USATF competitions was a second in the triple jump in 2001.\nAdmitted to medical school in 1999, Howard worked in his jumping around his schooling, studying at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences to be a neurosurgeon.  He had deferred his medical studies for one year to train for the 2000 Olympics and again for the 2004 Olympics.  He finished fifth in the 2004 Olympic Trials, falling short in his attempt to make the Olympic team for the third time.\nRankings\nDuring his career, Howard was ranked among the top jumpers in the US by Track and Field News.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n!

Police found Mitchell dead in the couple's bed with dozens of stab wounds to the head and torso.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.usatf.org/athletes/bios/TrackAndFieldArchive/2002/Howard_Robert.asp Robert Howard] at USATF\n*\n*\n*\n* [http://www.usatf.org/events/2004/OlympicTrials-TF/results/fullResults.asp 2004 Olympic Trial results]\n* [http://www.hogwired.com/pdf2/103362.pdf?ATCLID=801339&SPSID=30837&SPID=2430&DB_OEM_ID=6100 Razorback Track & Field Media Guide]"
