The song was released in November 1978 as the third and final single from their album Entertainers... On and Off the Record.\nContent\nWritten by group members Don Reid and Harold Reid, the song is an uptempo recollection on various details in the life of the eponymous Shirley Jean Berrell, a woman whom the narrator knows. At the end of the song, the narrator then reveals the one detail that he does not know about her: \"where she is right now\".\nCritical reception\nCashbox published a positive review of the song, which stated that \"This song...is tailor made for the group. The foursome lightheartedly carry a listener down memory lane again and their vocal harmonizing never sounded better.\"\nChart performance\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1978-1979)\n!align=\"center\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Canadian RPM Country Tracks\n|align=\"center\"|7\n|}\nReferences"
