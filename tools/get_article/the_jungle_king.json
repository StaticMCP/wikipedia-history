Diane Eskenazi, the founder of Golden Films, was the producer, director and storywriter for the film, as was the case for other animated films made by Golden Films.\nIt was originally released on VHS in 1994, and was most likely released to cash in on the success of Disney's The Lion King, as it was released the same year as Disney's film. The film later saw a DVD release in 2003. This animated feature was released as part of Golden Films' Enchanted Tales collection of films. The style of the film is reminiscent of the cartoons and animated films of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.\nPlot\nTaking place in a jungle, the film is about an anthropomorphic lion named King Maximilian III, a grumpy, selfish and obnoxious king who rules the main part of the jungle in an unpopular monarchy. He constantly makes preposterous laws and oppresses his subjects, though he is oblivious to how much he is hated by the angry animal citizens, due to how his main servants, the hyena Chancellor (with his dancing parrot assistant, Ricardo) and gorilla General Glump, constantly flatter and cajole towards him. One of the few cases where Max is astute to political problems is when he inspects his troops on parade and remarks how undisciplined they are. Meanwhile, Max's twin brother, Irwin, who is kind, timid and friendly, wants to write and illustrate a book about jungle birds, but has made little progress, only having finished illustrating his pet bird, Daphne.\nOne day, Max falls in love with a young lioness named Leonette and demands to marry her, despite the fact that she hates him as much as the rest of his subjects, even though the rest of her family are encouraging it in order to improve their lot in life. Unfortunately, the Chancellor is also in love with her and plots to take the throne. To this end, he has been doing covert work in another part of the continent that is ruled by Emperor Raj, a tiger. Raj is also autocratic, but seems to be antithetical to Max. Raj is aware of issues and has a well-trained military, but rules over a smaller and poorer kingdom than Max's. They plot to remove King Max and attack his army while they are leaderless. As a result, the Chancellor would become king and Raj would get more land. The next day, Chancellor tricks Max into bathing in the river, where Ricardo gets the attention of humans who then capture Max for the zoo.\nUpon learning of Max's capture and the Chancellor's betrayal, General Glump seeks out Irwin and asks for his help. Using his likeness, Irwin poses as Max and manages to fool the Chancellor. During his ruse, he also repeals all of Max's ludicrous laws, thus winning the hearts of the animal citizens, including Leonette. Irwin himself falls in love with her, but she finds out that Irwin is not really the king and rejects him for his lies. The Chancellor also learns of the deception and advises Raj to attack anyway since Irwin does not know how to lead an army. Raj agrees to this, but secretly plans to betray the Chancellor out of distrust.\nHaving a change of heart of his friendship to the Chancellor, Ricardo seeks out General Glump. Glump manages to save Max from hunter's camp and they both return to find the kingdom under attack by Emperor Raj and his army. The Chancellor runs away after being betrayed and invades Leonette's home where he kidnaps her. The soldiers quickly fall into disarray due to Irwin's ineptitude, but the citizens join the fight to repay his kindness. Upon which, Max realizes how unpopular he was before. Soon enough, Max and Irwin get together and team up to fight back, forcing Raj's army into retreat. Once Raj has been defeated, Irwin rescues Leonette and confronts the Chancellor, who runs away for good after being kicked by the angry Leonette.\nThe next day, Max bestows medals on those who defended his kingdom. He even offers to share the monarchy with Irwin remarking how a good leader recognizes his wrongdoing. Irwin says all he wants is to go back to his old life and be with Leonette, who has reconciled with him. Max gives his blessing for Irwin and Leonette to marry. Together they return to the jungle to get his book finished, alongside Ricardo and Daphne, who have also fallen in love.\nVoice cast\n*Irene Cara as Leonette\n*Cam Clarke as Ricardo the dancing Parrot and Emperor Raj\n*Townsend Coleman (additional voices)\nSee also\n*The Lion King\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
