He served in several conflicts, including the Spanish–American War and World War I, and he received the Distinguished Service Medal for his efforts in the latter conflict.\nBiography\nEdwards was born in Chesterfield, Massachusetts, on December 2, 1871. He graduated 40th in a class of 54 from the United States Military Academy (USMA), from which he entered in June 1890, in 1894 and was commissioned into the 11th Infantry Regiment. Many of his classmates at the academy became general officers before, during, or after World War I. These included Butler Ames, George H. Estes, Hamilton S. Hawkins III, Samuel Hof, Ora E. Hunt, John W. Joyes, Paul B. Malone, Francis L. Parker, Frank Parker, George Vidmer, Briant H. Wells, Pegram Whitworth and Clarence C. Williams.\nAfter serving in the 11th Infantry, Edwards served, in succeeding order, in the 6th, 28th, 23rd, and 5th Infantry Regiments. Edwards served in the Puerto Rican Campaign during the Spanish–American War. After serving as an aide-de-camp to Jacob H. Smith during the Philippine–American War, he participated in the Second Occupation of Cuba between 1906 and 1909. Edwards became a distinguished graduate of the Army School of the Line in 1910, and he graduated from the Army Staff College the following year. After serving as an instructor for the college, Edwards left in 1912 to teach a course for the French Army. After returning, he served in Panama as an intelligence officer and chief of staff.\nEdwards was promoted to the rank of brigadier general on August 8, 1918. He went to France because of World War I and organized and commanded the Machine Gun Training Center, receiving the Army Distinguished Service Medal for his work. The model's citation reads as follows:\nWith the war over, and after returning to the U.S., Edwards reverted to his permanent rank of colonel and became a student at the General Staff College. He also worked in the intelligence division of the United States Department of War's general staff.\nEdwards died, at the young age of 51, on February 25, 1921.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
