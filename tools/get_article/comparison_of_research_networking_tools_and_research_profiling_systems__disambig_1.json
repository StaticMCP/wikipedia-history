Research networking tools (RN tools) serve as knowledge management systems for the research enterprise. RN tools connect institution-level/enterprise systems, national research networks, publicly available research data (e.g., grants and publications), and restricted/proprietary data by harvesting information from disparate sources into compiled profiles for faculty, investigators, scholars, clinicians, community partners and facilities. RN tools facilitate collaboration and team science to address research challenges through the rapid discovery and recommendation of researchers, expertise and resources.\nUse\nRN tools differ from search engines like Google in that RN tools access information in databases and other data not limited to web pages. They also differ from social networking systems in that they represent a compendium of data ingested from authoritative and verifiable sources rather than predominantly individually-posted information, making RN tools more reliable.  Yet, RN tools have sufficient flexibility to allow for profile editing.  RN tools provide resources to bolster human connections: they can make non-intuitive matches, do not depend on serendipity and do not have a propensity to return only to previously identified collaborations/collaborators. RN tools generally have associated analytical capabilities that enable evaluation of collaboration and cross-disciplinary research/scholarly activity, especially over time.\nRN tools and research profiling systems can help researchers gain recognition. Active promotion of scholarship is an aspect of the publication cycle. Commercial and non-profit services help researchers increase visibility and recognition. Digital researcher services enhance discoverability, shareability and citability of scholarship. According to Shanks and Arlitsch, digital researcher services fall into three categories:\n* Author/Researcher Identification—these services provide infrastructure that may be used in the other two categories, such as unique identifiers and name disambiguation.\n* Academic and Professional Networking—most succinctly described as \"social networking for academics,\" these services focus on connecting users based on research interest, affiliation, geography or other variables.\n* Reference and Citation Management—these tools and services include some of the functionality and features of other categories, although their primary focus is on management of citations that a researcher compiles for use within a publication or for sharing with other researchers.\nImportantly, data harvested into RN tools can be repurposed, especially if available as Linked Open Data (RDF triples). These RN tools enhance research support activities by providing data for customized, web pages, CV/biosketch generation and data tables for grant proposals.\nGeneral\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: smaller; text-align: center; width: auto;\"\n|+General\n|-\n! style=\"width: 12em\"|Research Networking Tool\n!

Symplectic Elements\n|  Clients have the ability to integrate with existing web profile management systems, export data for business intelligence solutions and easily submit research outcomes for various government assessment exercises. This includes HR, publications, teaching activities, grants, institutional repositories, and any other system providing or consuming research data.\n|  Elements integrates with a variety of external systems including: Altmetric, figshare, ORCID, SHERPA/RoMEO (licensing information), DOAJ (licensing information)\n|  Elements can be linked to all major open repository technologies and an open source is also available.\n|  Elements public profiling tool, Discovery Module, can be integrated with Direct2Expert.\n|-\n! VIVO\n|  Data can be ingested from a wide variety of local sources (including HR, grants, course databases, institutional repositories, membership rosters, research interests, and many others) to reflect a complete view of the institution's priorities and efforts.\n|  see mini-grants; eagle-i; Drupal; many others - any tool that can consume open linked data.  Other ongoing collaborations with Wellspring (maintaining VIVO profiles with a focus upon tech transfer and also as a 3rd party implementation service provider) and with Symplectic.\n|  VIVO collaborates with eagle-I on research resources.  Future plans include adding many additional data types which are meaningful in the academic research setting.  VIVO data are structured using a comprehensive ontology designed for local extension and major ontology \"plugins\" such as BIBO and eagle-i.\n|  VIVO Consortium received $12.2M NIH ARRA U24 award in 2009 to fully develop software and create national system of federated research expertise directories/research networking systems; All other semantic web-compliant software platforms can be integrated into the consortium (example: Harvard Profiles).

Active networking means that the user can enter connections to the network by entering colleagues' names.  Passive networking means that the software infers network connections from a user's publication co-authors and builds a network from these names.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: smaller; text-align: center; width: auto;\"\n|+User facilities and social graph\n|-\n! style=\"width: 12em\"|Research Networking Tool\n!
