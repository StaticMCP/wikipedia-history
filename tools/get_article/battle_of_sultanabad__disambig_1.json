In the resulting battle, the Russians were surrounded and routed.\nThe Persians, numerically superior, were led by Abbas Mirza and fought the Russians. A Persian offensive into Georgia, with Persia's British and French-trained Nezam-e Jadid infantry, initiated the battle. The Persians had also obtained European cannons from the French.\nThe Persians won the battle by moving faster than the Russians and by attacking them near their camp with the reformed European-style infantry. However, the Battle of Aslanduz and the Siege of Lankaran followed soon after, shifting the momentum of the war firmly in Russia's favor.\nThe battle is considered the most shameful page of the war for the Russians\nSee also\n* Battle of Aslanduz\n* Siege of Lankaran\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n* Roxane Farmanfarmiaian (editor).
