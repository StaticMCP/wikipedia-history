On March 7, 2000, Texas Governor George W. Bush won the 2000 Republican nomination for President of the United States, and became the presumptive nominee. On July 25, 2000, former Secretary of Defense Richard B. Cheney was chosen as his running mate. Bush initially wanted Cheney to only find him a running mate. However, as they were running out of time, Bush changed his mind to make Cheney his running mate.\nThe Bush–Cheney ticket would go on to defeat the Democratic tickets of Gore–Lieberman in 2000 and Kerry–Edwards in 2004 in both close elections.\nSelection process\nBush had initially chosen Dick Cheney to lead the search for his vice presidential running mate. In 1992, Bush had supported Cheney as a replacement for Dan Quayle on his father's ultimately unsuccessful national ticket. After more than three months of extensive research, Cheney recommended John Danforth to be the nominee, as the other choices' strengths were offset by liberal stances. Bush heavily considered Danforth. However, Danforth, who wanted to continue living mainly in Missouri, formally declined to run as vice president on July 11, 2000; nevertheless Danforth would eventually be appointed to the Bush Administration as a special envoy to Sudan on September 6, 2001. Bush ultimately asked Cheney himself to be the nominee. It was acknowledged in a July 28, 2000 New York Times article that the decision to select Cheney as Bush's Vice Presidential nominee was in fact secretly made \"weeks\" before it was formally announced on July 25, 2000.\nAccording to the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the presidential electors from Texas (in the United States Electoral College) could not vote for candidates for president and vice president who were both from Texas. On July 21, 2000, Cheney changed his voter registration from Texas to Teton County, Wyoming, which, combined with other actions, ultimately allowed the Texas electors to vote for both Bush and Cheney.\nBy picking Cheney, Bush had a running mate who had years of experience as well as an extensive foreign policy expertise. After Cheney, who was serving as CEO of Halliburton, reported his findings back to Bush, Bush surprised pundits by asking Cheney himself to be his running mate. Bush told supporters that regional considerations would have less bearing on his decision than the candidate's ability to take over the office of the presidency. At the selection announcement, Bush said that Cheney, who had worked under all five presidential administrations between 1969 and 1993, was qualified, respected and shared his vision for America.\nThere was a short-lived movement to draft Elizabeth Dole, but that effort did not move forward.\nShortlist\nFile: Dick Cheney (cropped).jpg|\nFile:John danforth (cropped).JPG|\nFile:McCain2 (1).jpg|\nFile:George Pataki 2004 (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Tom Ridge (cropped).jpg|\nMedia speculation on possible running mates\nFile: Colin Powell official Secretary of State photo (cropped).jpg|}}\nFile:Elizabeth Dole official photo.jpg|\nFile:Christine Todd Whitman 412-APD-A5-EPA13a (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Kasich 00.gif|\nFile:George Voinovich official portrait (1).jpg|\nFile:J.
