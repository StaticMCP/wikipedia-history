It was created in 1841, upon the establishment of the Province of Canada by the union of Upper Canada and Lower Canada. Kingston was represented by one member in the Legislative Assembly.  It was abolished in 1867, upon the creation of Canada and the province of Ontario.\nBoundaries\nKingston electoral district was primarily centred on the town of Kingston, Canada West (now Ontario). It was located on the north shore of Lake Ontario, at the beginning of the Saint Lawrence River.\nThe Union Act, 1840 had merged the two provinces of Upper Canada and Lower Canada into the Province of Canada, with a single Parliament.  The separate parliaments of Lower Canada and Upper Canada were abolished.  The Union Act provided that the town of Kingston would constitute one electoral district in the Legislative Assembly of the new Parliament, but gave the Governor General of the Province of Canada the power to draw the boundaries for the electoral district.\nThe first Governor General of the Province of Canada, Lord Sydenham, issued a proclamation shortly after the formation of the Province of Canada in early 1841, establishing the boundaries for the electoral district:\nMembers of the Legislative Assembly\nKingston was represented by one member in the Legislative Assembly.
