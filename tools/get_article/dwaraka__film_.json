A critic from The Times of India rated the film two and a half out of five and wrote that \"Dwaraka has an interesting plotline and a tiringly erratic screenplay. It is almost engaging. You’ll want to see what happens of this thief who is given such a position of power. But only if you can sit through the two and a half hour of randomness\". Suhas Yellapantula from The New Indian Express stated \"For all its flaws, Dwaraka veers away from the infamous Telugu template and offers something for the viewers to think about. For this alone, it can be worth a watch\". Varaprasad Makireddy from Samayam Telugu rated the film three out of five stars and opined, \"In terms of story, there is no variety but the story is impressive. Thief Sheenu.. The sequence of becoming Baba.. The stunts performed by Baba.. Superstitious devotion.. The media frenzy.. The movie moves smartly with these scenes\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
