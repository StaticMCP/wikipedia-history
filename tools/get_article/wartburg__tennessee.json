The population was 918 at the 2010 census.\nHistory\nIn 1805, the Cherokee ceded what is now Morgan County to the United States by signing the Third Treaty of Tellico.  The first settlers arrived in the area shortly thereafter.\nWartburg was founded in the mid-1840s by Georg Friedrich Gerding (later anglicized as George Frederick), a land speculator who bought up large tracts of land in what is now Morgan County and organized the East Tennessee Colonization Company with plans to establish a series of German colonies in the Cumberland region.\n: Born in Germany in 1800, he became a successful businessman after moving to New York. He was decorated by Belgium King Leopold I for establishing the first ship line between Antwerp and New York. He was U.S. Consul to Baden-Baden 1845-47. Acquiring 300,000 acres of land, he established the East Tennessee Land Colonization Co. for Swiss, German, and French immigrants. In 1844, he founded Wartburg, and gave land for the town square, a church, and a cemetery. He died in 1884.\nGerman and Swiss immigrants, seeking to escape poor economic conditions in their home counties, arrived at the site by traveling from New Orleans up the Mississippi and Cumberland rivers to Nashville, and then by ox cart to the Cumberland Plateau.  The first of these settlers arrived in the area in 1845, and new groups of immigrants would continue trickling in until 1855.\nThe new settlement, which had already been platted by East Tennessee Colonization Company agent Friedrich Guenther, was named after Wartburg Castle in Germany.\n: “The city was named after the German Wartburg, where Martin Luther translated the New Testament and parts of the Old Testament into German.”\nThe first six streets were initially named for European cities, but the names were changed within a few years to Rose, Church, Maidenland (now Maiden), Kingston, Mill, and Cumberland.  As most immigrants lived on farms outside the town, Wartburg grew slowly.  By 1850, the town consisted of Gerding's house and store, a church and school building, a doctor's office, and a few small houses.  Early residents included a number of professionals trained in Europe, including architect Carl Rothe, musician Gustav Knabe, painter George Dury, and physicians Rudolf Knaffl and F. A. Sienknecht. Gerding and the retired German officer Friedrich Karl Georg Freiherr von Forstner (1800–1861), who arrived with his family in 1847 and bought 1,500 acres, were the largest landowners.\nWhile Morgan County was generally pro-Union during the Civil War, Wartburg was bitterly divided over the secession issue.  Gerding, the city's founder, supported the Confederacy.  John Wilken, a prominent Lutheran pastor in the city, supported the Union.  F.A. Sienknecht supported the Union, though two of his sons fought for the Confederacy.  On January 2, 1862, a Confederate cavalry unit under Colonel J.W. White clashed with the Union Home Guard near Wartburg.  In late March 1862, Confederate General Kirby Smith reported that all Confederate citizens had been expelled from the Wartburg area.  In June 1863, Union General William P. Sanders marched through Wartburg and captured 104 Confederate soldiers in the vicinity.\nIn 1870, Morgan County elected to move its county seat from the now-defunct town of Montgomery, which had a population of just 50 residents and had been economically overshadowed by Wartburg.  A new courthouse, consisting of a simple frame structure, was completed in 1871.  The current Richardsonian Romanesque-style courthouse was built in 1904.\nBy the early 20th century, Wartburg had grown modestly, reporting a population of about 500 in 1920. At this time, the city included a bank, school, newspaper, four general stores, a clothing store, a hardware store, and a billiard hall.  In 1968, Wartburg voted to incorporate, and elected Roy McNeal as its mayor.\nGeography\non the left]]\nWartburg is situated amidst the Crab Orchard Mountains, a sub-range of the Cumberland Mountains, near the eastern edge of the Cumberland Plateau.  Bird Mountain dominates the area east of Wartburg, rising from its base at the edge of the city and stretching for some  to its  summit at Frozen Head State Park.  The Emory River, its source near the summit of Bird, flows westwardly along the mountain's northern base, passing just north of Wartburg, and turning south before dropping off the plateau and emptying into the Watts Bar Lake impoundment of the Tennessee River.  The Obed River flows eastwardly from Cumberland County through a scenic gorge before emptying into the Emory just west of Wartburg.\nWartburg is situated around the junction of U.S. Route 27, which connects the city to Kentucky to the north and Harriman and Interstate 40 to the south, and State Route 62, which connects Wartburg to Oak Ridge to the east and the rural areas of Morgan County and Fentress County to the west.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.\nDemographics\n}}\n2020 census\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+Wartburg racial composition\n!scope=\"col\"| Race\n!scope=\"col\"| Number\n!scope=\"col\"| Percentage\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| White (non-Hispanic)\n| 748\n| 88.21%\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Black or African American (non-Hispanic)\n| 12\n| 1.42%\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Native American\n| 7\n| 0.83%\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Asian\n| 10\n| 1.18%\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Other/Mixed\n| 29\n| 3.42%\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Hispanic or Latino\n| 42\n| 4.95%\n|}\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 848 people, 377 households, and 218 families residing in the city.\n2000 census\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 890 people, 363 households, and 197 families residing in the city.
