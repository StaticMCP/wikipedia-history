Peaks in Tololing include Point 5140 and Point 4875, 4590.\nBattle\nUnits under the command of Maj Gen Mohinder Puri of the 8 Mountain Division were tasked with recapturing the positions held by the infiltrators. The battle lasted 32 days. Initially only units from the 121 Independent Infantry brigade under the command of Brig. O.P. Nandrajog was sent to evict the intruders. The strength of the infiltrators of Tololing was under-estimated grossly.\nCol Kushal Thakur was tasked with heading the attack. Later, 1 Naga and Garhwal battalions were also attached to the forces.\nThe forces began the assault on 22 May. The initial assault was heavily resisted by the Pakistani forces. Pakistani forces were very well entrenched and fortified on the hill. On 30 May, the Indian forces approached the ridge very slowly and eventually a company led by Major Rajesh Adhikari approached the peak. In the resulting gunfight, Maj Adhikari was killed-in-action by Pakistani sniper. The 2inC of 18 Grenadiers, Lt Col Vishwanathan was also KIA.\nOn 28 May, a Mi-17 helicopter aiding the attack on Tololing peak was shot down by a SAM. All 4 crew members were killed. This attack severely affected the moral of the Indian forces.\nBetween 2 June and 11 June, the Pakistani and Indian forces remained at stalemate as Indian forces made several attempts to recover Maj Adhikari's body. Kushal Thakur worked hard to resupply the positions and recover the bodies of the killed soldiers. In this period several other units were brought to help with the attack. 2 Rajputana rifles was eventually brought in for assistance and a final assault was planned.\nOn 2 July, the final assault began. Under the guise of heavy artillery fire, the Indian forces assaulted the Pakistani forces from front and one company under the command of Major Vivek Gupta flanked the enemy positions. In the resulting assault, Maj Gupta was killed in action. By 7 July, all enemy positions were abandoned by Pakistani forces and the Indian companies recaptured Tololing.\nAftermath\nMajor Rajesh Adhikari, Major Vivek Gupta ( Posthumously)and Havildar Digendra Kumar were awarded the Maha Vir Chakra  India's second highest war time military honour for their daring actions on the peak. Col Ravindranath and Captain Vijayant Thapar were awarded Vir Chakra.\nFrom Pakistan's side, Major Abdul Wahab was awarded the Sitara-e-Jurat, Pakistan's third highest military honour as Major Abdul Wahab was killed defending the captured peak.\nIn popular culture\nTurning Point at Tololing, a feature documentary hosted by Maj Gen G. D. Bakshi, aired on the Indian television channel Epic TV. It details the political and military background and course of the battle.\nSee also\n* Battle of Tiger Hill\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081208104328/http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/MONITOR/ISSUE3-6/lns.html Bharat Rakshak]"
