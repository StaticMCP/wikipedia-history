Illinois Outstanding Service Award\n11. Illinois Distinguished Service Award\nIllinois Military Medal of Valor\nThe Illinois Military Medal of Valor was established by the Adjutant General of Illinois on 1 May 1978. The Illinois Military Medal of Valor is awarded to those members of the Illinois\nNational Guard who distinguish themselves by a conspicuous act of courage and valor. The act may have been performed either in a military or non-military status.\nThe deed or act performed must be one that displays personal bravery or self-sacrifice above and beyond the call of duty so conspicuous as to clearly distinguish the individual for\ngallantry above the individual's comrades, and must involve personal risk of life or performance of more than ordinarily hazardous service. Incontestable proof of the act or deed is required. Each recommendation for the award of this decoration will be considered on the standard of extraordinary effort.\nThe decoration consists of a medal set that is silver. The front has the State of Illinois, polished smoothly and with a “V” centered thereon, placed upon a muted field that is encircled\nby a rope-like border. The reverse side is plain. An appropriate ribbon is authorized for issue to each individual receiving the award of a medal for wear on the military uniform.

Second and subsequent awards are denoted by oak leaf clusters.\nIllinois Military Distinguished Service Medal\nThe Illinois Military Distinguished Service Medal was established by the Adjutant General of Illinois on 21 April 1937.

The award depicts the head of Abraham Lincoln in profile and facing left, encircled by a border formed of two concentric\ncircles, the innermost being studded with 13 equally-spaced stars. Within this border is the inscription “Distinguished Service” (above) and “State of Illinois” (below). On the reverse\nside is a completely closed laurel wreath near the edge, within which are the words “Awarded to:” (above) with space for the individual's name to be imprinted below.

The ribbon is golden yellow (3/8”), navy blue (5/8”), and golden yellow (3/8”).

The Illinois Military Medal of Merit may be awarded to persons who distinguish themselves by exceptionally meritorious service to the State of Illinois.\nSuperior performance of duty alone will not justify the award of this decoration. The service performed must be clearly outstanding and unmistakably exceptional when compared to the achievement of individuals of like rank and responsibilities.\nThe decoration consists of a medal set that is bronze.
