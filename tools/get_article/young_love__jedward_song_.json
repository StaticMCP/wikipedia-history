It was released as a digital download on 15 June 2012.\nThe song is written by Lars Halvor Jensen and Tim McEwan of Danish songwriting and production house Deekay and Los Angeles-based songwriter Jess Cates.\nBackground\nThe song was first previewed in April 2012 via the JedwardTV YouTube channel, with a 42-second excerpt of the song. On 11 June, the song was officially confirmed as a single with an international, digital-only release date of 15 June 2012.
