      "text": "# List of Silver Slugger Award winners at pitcher\n\nThe Silver Slugger Award is awarded annually to the best offensive player at each position in both the American League (AL) and the National League (NL), as determined by the coaches and managers of Major League Baseball (MLB). These voters consider several offensive categories in selecting the winners, including batting average, slugging percentage, and on-base percentage, in addition to \"coaches' and managers' general impressions of a player's overall offensive value\". Managers and coaches are not permitted to vote for players on their own team. The Silver Slugger was first awarded in 1980 and is given by Hillerich & Bradsby, the manufacturer of Louisville Slugger bats. The award is a bat-shaped trophy, 3&nbsp;feet (91&nbsp;cm) tall, engraved with the names of each of the winners from the league and plated with sterling silver.\nOnly National League pitchers ever received a Silver Slugger Award; from the Silver Slugger Award's inception until 2019, and in 2021, a designated hitter generally took the place of the pitcher in the batting order in the National League. A Silver Slugger Award for designated hitters was given only in the American League during that time.\nMike Hampton has won the most Silver Sluggers as a pitcher, earning five consecutive awards with four different teams from 1999 to 2003. Tom Glavine is a four-time winner (1991, 1995–1996, 1998) with the Atlanta Braves. Rick Rhoden (1984–1986), Don Robinson (1982, 1989–1990), and Carlos Zambrano (2006, 2008–2009) each own three Silver Sluggers. Two-time winners include the inaugural winner, Bob Forsch (1980, 1987), Fernando Valenzuela (1981, 1983), who won the Cy Young Award, the Rookie of the Year Award, and the Silver Slugger in his first full major league season, and Madison Bumgarner (2014–2015).\nHampton has hit the most home runs in a pitcher's Silver Slugger-winning season, with seven in 2001. He is tied with Robinson as the leader in runs batted in, with 16 (Hampton, 2001; Robinson, 1982). Zack Greinke leads all Silver Slugger-winning pitchers in on-base percentage with a .409 clip set in 2013. Orel Hershiser leads winning pitchers in batting average, with the .356 mark he set in 1993. Micah Owings is the slugging percentage leader among winners (.683 in 2007).\nIn 2020, the use of the designated hitter was temporarily expanded to both leagues, and no Silver Slugger Award for a pitcher was given. In 2022, the use of the designated hitter was permanently allowed in both leagues, and the Silver Slugger Award for pitchers was retired. Max Fried was the final pitcher to win a Silver Slugger Award in 2021.\nKey\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n| Year\n| Links to the corresponding Major League Baseball season\n|-\n| AVG\n| Batting average\n|-\n| OBP\n| On-base percentage\n|-\n| SLG\n| Slugging percentage\n|-\n| HR\n| Home runs\n|-\n| RBI\n| Runs batted in\n|-\n| Ref\n| References\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#bbeeff\"| *\n| Winner of the most Silver Sluggers in Major League Baseball as a pitcher\n|-\n| †\n| Member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum\n|}\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!
