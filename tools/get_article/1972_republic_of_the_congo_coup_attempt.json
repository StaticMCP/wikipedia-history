The coup was led by Ange Diawara, along with other Politburo members including Claude-Ernest Ndalla and Jean-Baptiste Ikoko. Joachim Yhombi-Opango was instrumental in ending the coup. The musician Franklin Boukaka was killed in the coup, as was former Minister Élie Théophile Itsihou.\nAfter more than a year of evading capture, Diawara was captured in Kinshasa. He was extradited by the Zairian authorities in April 1973 and executed along with other conspirators shortly afterwards. The bodies of Diawara and Ikoko were publicly exhibited in the Stade de la Révolution.\nReferences"
