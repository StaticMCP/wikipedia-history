The crew had taken to the rigging when the vessel was wrecked. The one remaining survivor was soon seen to be washed away. The tug Derwent put out from Workington, towing a harbour boat with four men aboard, but the boat capsized, and one man was also lost. The vessel was the schooner Margaret of Ramsey, Isle of Man. The bodies of the two crew, William Cowle and William Kennish, and the Master, Robert Christian, were found washed up on the beach. James Henry Christian, aged 13, the Master's son, was found later.\nIt was following this wreck and loss of life, that requests were made to the RNLI for the provision of a lifeboat at Workington, which was agreed. A lifeboat house and slipway were constructed at a cost of £395.\nThe lifeboat, a 34-foot self-righting 'pulling and sailing' (P&S) lifeboat, one with oars and sails, was pulled on its carriage, drawn by eight horses, through the town in a grand procession. At a ceremony at the shore, south of the pier, the lifeboat was named the Dodo (ON 79) in accordance with the wishes of the donor, the late Miss Harrison of London. Accepted by the District Inspector of Life-boats, Lt. Tipping, RN, the boat was handed over to the care of the local RNLI committee.\nIn 1891, the lifeboat house was relocated to the beach south of John's Pier. A replacement boat was placed on service in 1899, unusually, being older than the first boat, although of identical design and size. Previously named Theodore and Herbert (ON 33) at , the boat was renamed Dodo at Workington. In 1902, the boat returned to its original name. Three years later, it is believed that works on the piers at Workington forced the closure of the lifeboat station in 1905.\nBy 1948, the nearest lifeboat station at Maryport was beginning to suffer from silting of the harbour. In order to maintain a lifeboat service on the Solway coast, the Workington station was re-established. Maryport Lifeboat Station closed in 1949. In what would be her last assignment, already now 26-years-old, a 45-foot Watson non-self-righting lifeboat named The Brothers (ON 671) was placed at Workington, serving for 4 years until her retirement. She was replaced in February 1952 for just one year, by the former  lifeboat, a slightly larger 45-foot 6in Watson non-self-righting lifeboat, named N. T. (ON 701), which was already 25-years-old when she arrived at Workington. The requested names of the donors, Eliza Norman and M. E. Thompson, were inscribed on a plaque inside the boat.\nIn March 1953, Workington received the Manchester and Salford XXIX (ON 841), a 10-year-old 46-foot Watson-class non-self-righting lifeboat, which had previously served at .\nAt 21:25 on the 27 January 1974, the relief lifeboat City of Edinburgh (ON 802) was launched in extremely rough conditions, to the fishing vessel Kia Ora, broken down off Hestan Island, in Auchencairn Bay, and dragging her anchor. In the very poor conditions, the lifeboat was brought alongside, and at the second attempt, six men and a 10-year-old boy were recovered. Coxswain Albert Brown was awarded the RNLI Bronze Medal, the first and only such award for gallantry at Workington.\nIn 1990, the  lifeboat Douglas Currie (ON 1021) was placed on service for two years. The lifeboat was 17-years-old at this time, having previously served at four other lifeboat stations in Scotland. At the same time, a two-year-old relatively new carriage-launched  lifeboat from the relief fleet was placed at Workington, on trial from 4 July 1990 until 3 January 1991, to evaluate shore launches and recovery.\nShore launching was clearly not suited to the geography at Workington. On 8 June 1992, the station would receive a  lifeboat from the relief fleet, 47-028 Sir John Fisher (ON 1141), funded by a gift from the Sir John Fisher Foundation, and the bequests of Frances Elizabeth Jackson and Mabel Annie Young. To accommodate the boat, a new boathouse was constructed on the quay at the Prince of Wales Dock, with a workshop, drying room, shower/toilet facilities, a fuel storage tank and crew-room. In a unique method of launching an All-weather lifeboat in the UK, the boat is set on a rail carriage in the boathouse. At time of launch, the boat is rolled out of the boathouse, and then a special launch davit system picks up the boat, which is then lowered into the water.\nAt a coastal review in 2004, it was decided to also place an Inshore lifeboat at Workington. Following a brief period with the relief lifeboat Spirit of RAOC (D-461), the  lifeboat The Shannock (D-629) was placed on service on 12 August 2004.\nOn 7 December 2011, the fishing vessel George Lou-N suffered engine problems, and was being smashed against the North Pier, in very rough conditions and a force 10 gale, and with a severely injured man on board. At great personal risk, RNLI divisional maintenance manager Andrew Philip Rodgers jumped onto the vessel from the Pier to assist, and the lifeboat Sir John Fisher (ON 1141) managed to get a tow established. The vessel was brought into the harbour without damage, and the man's life was saved. Coxswain John Stobbart and Mr Rodgers were both accorded the 'Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum'.\nIn 2017, Workington would receive a new £2.2 million  lifeboat. Named 13-19 Dorothy May White (ON 1326), it would be the first brand new lifeboat assigned to the station for 131 years, since the very first boat, Dodo (ON 79), in 1886.\nAt a ceremony in February 2025, 24 members of the Workington lifeboat crew, all with over 5-years frontline service, were awarded the King's Coronation Medal by Alexander Scott, Lord Lieutenant for Cumbria.\nStation honours\nThe following are awards made at Workington.\n*RNLI Bronze Medal\n::Albert Brown, Coxswain – 1974\n*The Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum\n::John Stobbart, Coxswain – 2001\n::John Stobbart, Coxswain – 2012\n::Andrew Philip Rodgers, Divisional Maintenance Manager – 2012\n*British Empire Medal\n::Robert McLaughlin – 1990QBH\n::John Stobbart, Coxswain – 2020QBH\nWorkington lifeboats\nPulling and Sailing (P&S) lifeboats\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!
