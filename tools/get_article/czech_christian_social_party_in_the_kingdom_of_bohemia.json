The party was founded in 1910 as merger of three political parties: the Catholic National Party in the Kingdom of Bohemia, the Christian Social Party in Bohemia, and the Christian Social People's Party in Bohemia under the name Party of Catholic People. The party was inspired by the Centre Party in Germany and Christian Social Party in Austria.\nThe party cooperated with its older counterpart, the Moravian-Silesian Christian Social Party in Moravia.\nReferences"
