The aircraft was an 85% scale replica of the original Ryan STA and when it was available was supplied as a kit for amateur construction.\nDesign and development\nThe aircraft featured a wire-braced and strut-braced low-wing, two seats in separate tandem open cockpits with windshields, fixed conventional landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration.\nThe aircraft fuselage was made from welded steel tubing, while the wings had wooden spars and ribs covered in doped aircraft fabric. Several prefabricated components were supplied as part of the kit, including the fuselage frame, landing gear, engine mount and tail assembly. The manufacturer rated the STA kit as suitable for beginners and estimated the construction time from the supplied kit as 1500&nbsp;hours. The kit could be completed to represent an STA, a military PT-16 or a PT-20.\nThe aircraft's  span wing had an area of . The cockpit width was  and the standard engine used was the  CAM 100 powerplant. It had a typical empty weight of  and a gross weight of , giving a useful load of . With full fuel of  the payload for pilot, passenger and baggage was .\nOperational history\nIn January 2014 no examples remained registered in the United States with the Federal Aviation Administration. Although one aircraft had been registered in 1997, it was listed as destroyed and deregistered in 2002. It is likely that no examples exist today.\nSpecifications (STA)\n|more general=\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=CAM 100\n|eng1 type= four cylinder four stroke aircraft engine\n|eng1 kw=\n|eng1 hp=100\n|prop blade number=2\n|prop name=fixed pitch wooden\n|prop dia m=\n|prop dia ft=\n|prop dia in=\n|prop note=\n|perfhide=\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=125\n|max speed kts=\n|max speed note=\n|cruise speed kmh=\n|cruise speed mph=110\n|cruise speed kts=\n|cruise speed note=\n|stall speed kmh=\n|stall speed mph=53\n|stall speed kts=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|never exceed speed mph=\n|never exceed speed kts=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|range km=\n|range miles=490\n|range nmi=\n|range note=\n|endurance=\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling ft=16300\n|ceiling note=\n|g limits=\n|roll rate=\n|glide ratio=\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate ftmin=930\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|sink rate ms=\n|sink rate ftmin=\n|sink rate note=\n|lift to drag=\n|wing loading kg/m2=\n|wing loading lb/sqft=11.3\n|wing loading note=\n|power/mass=\n|thrust/weight=\n|more performance=\n|avionics=\n}}\nReferences"
