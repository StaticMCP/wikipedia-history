In that capacity, in support of FEMA operations across the United States, the 64 Air Expeditionary Group (AEG) led Air Force doctors, nurses, medics and general purpose staff augmenting the civilian work force in hospitals along the west coast of California to reduce the patient load on civilian providers battling COVID-19.  As the number of United States citizens with COVID-19 declined, the group transitioned to establishing Air Force-led COVID-19 Community Vaccination Center (CVC) sites.\n- 64th EMDOS located in Houston, Texas at Reliant Stadium (operational February 2021 to May 2021).\n- Detachment 1 located in Detroit, Michigan at Ford Field (operational March 2021 to May 2021).\n- Detachment 2 located in Gary, Indiana at Theodore Roosevelt Park (operational April 2021 to June 2021).\n- Detachment 3 located in Saint Paul, Minnesota at The State Fair (operational April 2021 to June 2021).\n- Detachment 4 located in Grand Rapids, Michigan at DeVos Place (operational April 2021 to June 2021).\nPrior to supporting FEMA during the COVID-19 pandemic, the last activation was in direct support of the 379th Air Expeditionary Wing at Eskan Village, near Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. It was inactivated in 2014.\nThe group was first activated in December 1940 as the 64th Transport Group, a year before the Attack on Pearl Harbor. During the Second World War it fought primarily with Twelfth Air Force, earning a Distinguished Unit Citation.\nHistory\nThe 64th Air Expeditionary Group is a provisional unit and uses the emblem of the inactive 64th Flying Training Wing.\nWorld War II\nConstituted as the 64th Transport Group on 20 November 1940. Activated on 4 December 1940. Used Douglas C-47s for training and flying transport missions in the US.\nRedesignated 64th Troop Carrier Group in July 1942. Moved to England in August 1942 and received additional training. Became part of Twelfth Air Force. Moved to the Mediterranean theater, November–December 1942. Flew first mission on 11 November, landing paratroops at Maison Blanche Airport. Dropped paratroops to capture airfields during the battle for Tunisia. Released paratroops near Gela and Catania when the Allies invaded Sicily in July 1943. Dropped paratroops near Avellino during the invasion of Italy in September 1943 to destroy a bridge on the enemy's supply line to Salerno. Participated in the assault on southern France in August 1944 by releasing gliders and paratroops in the battle zone. Supported the partisans in northern Italy early in 1945 by dropping paratroops, supplies, and propaganda leaflets behind enemy lines.\nWhen not engaged in airborne combat operations, the group continually transported men and supplies to the front lines and evacuated wounded personnel.\nMost of the group was on detached service in the China Burma India Theater from April–June 1944, while a skeletal remnant remained in Sicily. With its squadrons operating from separate bases in India, the group aided the Allied offensive in Burma. It was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation for flying unarmed over rugged enemy territory to carry food, clothing, medical supplies, guns, ammunition, and mules to the combat zone and to evacuate wounded personnel.\nThe group moved to Trinidad in June 1945. Assigned to Air Transport Command. Inactivated on 31 July 1945.\nActivated in the United States on 19 May 1947. Not manned during 1947–1948. Inactivated on 10 September 1948.\nCold War\nThe 64th performed airlift and airdrop/airlanding of troops and cargo, routinely and during frequent maneuvers, 1952–1953. It began phasing down for inactivation in mid-October 1953, at which time tactical operations passed to 63d Troop Carrier Wing. In February 1954, however, the wing began building up again in preparation for an overseas movement, but was inactivated instead.\nFlying training\nFrom the implementation of the Objective Wing organization until 1997, the group served as the flying arm of the 64th Flying Training Wing.\nExpeditionary operations\nThe 64 AEG/AEW operated out of Camp Snoopy at Doha International Airport, Qatar from 1996 until 2004.\nIn 2005, the group was activated for defense of personnel and assets in Southwest Asia. It provided force protection and support services for the installation in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia known as Eskan Village, replacing the former 320th Air Expeditionary Group.  The group was made up of about 300 security forces, support airmen, and civilians in two squadrons: the 64th Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron and the 64th Expeditionary Support Squadron. Their mission was to stand guard, provide integrated defense, emergency response, and combat support for the base, which houses military and host-nation tenant agencies. Most days the airmen fought the Global War on Terrorism in extreme temperatures of more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIn April 2020, the group was reactivated under the leadership of Air Force Colonel Adrian Byers.  The AEG responded to the COVID-19 Pandemic, performing medical duties in support of the New York Health and Hospital Systems fight against COVID-19.  The leadership cell functioned out of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, NJ with forward presence stationed at the Jacob Javits Convention Center in New York under the leadership of Deputy Commander, Lt Col Curt Hasse. The COVID response mission ended and the 64 AEG was once again inactivated in July 2021.\nLineage\nGroup\n* Constituted as the 64th Transport Group on 20 November 1940\n: Activated on 4 December 1940\n* Redesignated: 64th Troop Carrier Group on 1 July 1942\n: Inactivated 31 July 1945\n* Activated on 19 May 1947\n: Inactivated on 10 September 1948\n* Redesignated: 64th Troop Carrier Group, Medium on 3 July 1952\n: Activated on 14 July 1952\n: Inactivated on 21 July 1954\n* Redesignated 64th Military Airlift Group on 31 July 1985\n* Redesignated: 64th Operations Group on 1 May 1991\n: Activated on 15 May 1991\n: Inactivated on 30 September 1997\n* Redesignated as 64th Air Expeditionary Group, converted to provisional status and assigned to Air Combat Command to activate or inactivate as needed on 4 December 2001\n:: Activated December 2001\n:: Inactivated unknown\n:: Activated 2005\n:: Inactivated 1 May 2014\n:: Activated April 2020\n:: Inactivated July 2020\n:: Activated 23 Dec 2020\nAssignments\n* Fourth Air Force, 4 December 1940\n* 50th Transport Wing, 31 March 1942\n* 51st Transport Wing (later 51st Troop Carrier Wing), 1 June 1942\n* Eighth Air Force, 18 August 1942\n* 51st Troop Carrier Wing, 1 September 1942\n* Twelfth Air Force, 4 September 1942\n* 51st Troop Carrier Wing, 25 October 1942\n* 52d Troop Carrier Wing, 15 June 1943\n* 51st Troop Carrier Wing, 11 July 1943 (air echelon attached to Tenth Air Force, c. 7 April – c. 15 June 1944)\n* Air Transport Command, 25 May 1945 – 31 July 1945\n* Tactical Air Command, 19 May 1947 – 10 September 1948\n* 64th Troop Carrier Wing, 14 July 1952 – 21 July 1954 (attached to 443d Troop Carrier Wing, 19 July – 16 October 1952; 63d Troop Carrier Wing, 15 October 1953 – 15 February 1954)\n* 64 Flying Training Wing, 15 May 1991 – 1 April 1997\n* Air Combat Command to activate or inactivate any time after 4 December 2001\n:: December 2001 – unknown\n:: 379th Air Expeditionary Wing, 23 September 2005 – 1 May 2014\n* Air Force Northern, Northern Command, 23 Dec 2020 - 17 May 2021\nStations\n* Duncan Field, Texas, 4 December 1940\n* March Field, California, c. 13 July 1941;\n* Hamilton Field, California, c. 1 February 1942\n* Westover Field, Massachusetts, c. 8 June – 31 July 1942;\n* RAF Ramsbury, England, August–November 1942\n* Blida Airfield, Algeria, December 1942\n* Kairouan Airfield, Tunisia, 28 June 1943\n* El Djem Airfield, Tunisia, 26 July 1943\n* Comiso Airfield, Sicily, 29 August 1943\n* Ciampino Airfield, Italy, 10 July 1944\n* Rosignano Airfield, Italy, 10 January – 23 May 1945\n* Waller Field, Trinidad, 4 June – 31 July 1945\n* Langley Field (later Langley Air Force Base), Virginia, 19 May 1947 – 10 September 1948\n* Donaldson Air Force Base, South Carolina, 14 July 1952 – 21 July 1954\n* Reese Air Force Base, Texas 15 May 1991 – 1 April 1997\n* Doha International Air Base, Qatar (1997–2005)\n* Eskan Village, Saudi Arabia, 23 September 2005 – 1 May 2014\n* Travis Air Force Base, California 23 Dec 2020 - 17 May 2021\nComponents\nSquadrons\n* 16th Transport Squadron (later 16th Troop Carrier Squadron): 4 December 1940 – 31 July 1945, 19 May 1947 – 10 September 1948\n* 17th Transport Squadron (later 17th Troop Carrier Squadron): 4 December 1940 – 31 July 1945, 19 May 1947 – 10 September 1948, 14 July 1952 – 21 July 1954\n* 18th Transport Squadron (later 18th Troop Carrier Squadron): 4 December 1940 – 31 July 1945\n* 33d Flying Training Squadron: 15 December 1991 – 1 October 1992\n* 35th Transport Squadron (later 35th Troop Carrier Squadron, 35th Flying Training Squadron): 4 December 1940 – 31 July 1945, 19 May 1947 – 10 September 1948, 15 December 1991 – 31 July 1996\n* 52d Flying Training Squadron: 15 December 1991 – 1 April 1997\n* 54th Transport Squadron (later 54th Flying Training) Squadron: 1–11 June 1942; 15 December 1991 – 1 April 1997\n* 64th Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron 23 September 2005 – 1 May 2014\n* 64th Expeditionary Support Squadron 23 September 2005 – 1 May 2014\n* T-1A Flying Training Squadron, Provisional, attached 15 December 1991 – 1 October 1992\n* 64th Expeditionary Medical Operations Squadron, 18 Feb 2021 - May 2021\n* 64th AEG Detachment 1,2,3,4 18 Mar 2021 - May 2021\nAircraft\n* Douglas C-47 Skytrain, 1940–1945\n* C-82 Packet (1952–1953)\n* C-119 Flying Boxcar (1953–1954)\n* T-37 Tweet (1991–1997)\n* T-38 Talon (1991–1997)\n* T-1 Jayhawk (1992–1997)\nReferences\nNotes\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.afcent.af.mil/Units/379thAirExpeditionaryWing.aspx Photo gallery]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061004214326/http://www.zianet.com/jpage/airforce/ Joe's USAF Blue Book]\n* [https://www.afcent.af.mil/Units/379thAirExpeditionaryWing.aspx 64th AEG welcomes new commander]\n*\n}}"
