After the handover of Taiwan to China in 1945, the building was taken over by the China Merchants Bureau. The building was renovated in 2003 and opened as the YM Oceanic Culture and Art Museum in 2004.\nTransportation\nThe museum is accessible from Keelung Station of the Taiwan Railways.\nSee also\n* List of museums in Taiwan\n* YM Museum of Marine Exploration Kaohsiung\n* Yang Ming Marine Transport Corporation\n* Maritime industries of Taiwan\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
