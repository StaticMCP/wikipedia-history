It used the .iob extension for its objects. Imagine was a derivative of the software TurboSilver, which was also for the Amiga and written by Impulse.\nCAD-Technologies continued the distribution of the Amiga version. Starting with version 5.1, new updates were available for free for current customers as part of the Amiga Constant Upgrade Program (ACUP) up until presumed Imagine 6.0 release.\nVersions\nAmiga\n* 1990 - Imagine\n* 1992 - Imagine 2.0\n* 1993 - Imagine 2.9\n* 1994 - Imagine 3.0\n* 1995 - Imagine 3.1\n* 1995 - Imagine 3.2\n* 1995 - Imagine 3.3\n* 1995 - Imagine 4.0\n* 1996 - Imagine 5.0\n* 1998 - Imagine 5.1 and 5.1a (first ACUP release)\n*1998 - Imagine 5.13\n* 2000 - Imagine 5.17\n* 2006 - Imagine 5.19 (last public release)\nMS-DOS\n* 1993 - Imagine 2.0\n* 1994 - Imagine 3.0\n* 1995 - Imagine 4.0\nWindows\n*1996 - Imagine 1.0\n*1997 - Imagine 1.3.4 (first CUP release)\n*1999 - Imagine 1.9\n* 1999 - Imagine 2.0\n*1999 - Imagine 2.1.2\n*2000 - Imagine 2.1.3\n*2000 - Imagine 2.1.4 (no bones)\n*2002 - Imagine 2.1.5\n*2002 - Imagine 2.1.6 (additional effects (*.ifx files))\n*2002 - Imagine 2.1.7\n*2002 - Imagine 2.1.8 (additional effect (FireRing.ifx file))\n*2004 - Imagine 2.1.9 (last public release, added Volumetric)\nSee also\n*Sculpt 3D\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.pygott.demon.co.uk/prog.htm Program for reading IOB files]\n*[http://aminet.net/pix/imagi Aminet Imagine traces]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160409184453/http://www.imagine3d.org/ Imagine 3D fan site]"
