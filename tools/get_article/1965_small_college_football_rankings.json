Separate rankings were published by the Associated Press (AP) and the United Press International (UPI). The AP rankings were selected by a board of sports writers, and the UPI rankings were selected by a board of small-college coaches.\nThe 1965 North Dakota State Bison football team (11–0) was rated as the small-college champion by both the AP and UPI. Middle Tennessee State (10–0) was rated No. 2 by the AP and No. 3 by the UPI.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\"
