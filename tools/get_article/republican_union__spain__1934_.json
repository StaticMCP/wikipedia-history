It formed a governing coalition with Manuel Azaña's Republican Left. Though it participated in all republican governments during the Spanish Civil War, it played a minor role starting under Largo Caballero's government.\nIn exile in Mexico, it was the main support of the Republican government-in-exile until it was dissolved in 1959 to found the Spanish Democratic Republican Action along with the Republican Left.\nSee also\n* Republican Union (Spain, 1893)\n* Republican Union (Spain, 1903)\nFurther reading\n*Nigel Townson.
