Its main stadium – formerly known as QEII Stadium, and later ANZ Stadium under a naming rights agreement with ANZ – accommodates 48,500 spectators, while its smaller State Athletics Facility accommodates 2,100 spectators. Both stadiums feature Rekortan running tracks and natural grass fields. The Queensland Academy of Sport, Queensland State Netball Centre, and a complex of beach volleyball courts are also housed at the facility. QSAC is owned by the Queensland Government, and its main stadium and State Athletics Facility are operated through its agency, Stadiums Queensland.\nAs a track and field venue, the main stadium hosted competitions at the 1982 Commonwealth Games, 2001 Goodwill Games, and eleven editions of the Australian Athletics Championships; most recently its 2022–23 edition. It is currently planned to be renovated to host competitions at the 2032 Summer Olympics. As a rugby league venue, the main stadium was home to the Brisbane Broncos from 1993 to 2003, when the club left Lang Park and subsequently returned following its redevelopment. During this tenure, it hosted the 1994 World Club Challenge and the only Super League Grand Final in 1997, amid the Super League war. The main stadium has also hosted numerous concerts, occasional soccer matches, and a semi-final of the 1999 Davis Cup in tennis.\nHistory\nThe facility opened in 1975, providing a synthetic running track for athletics competitions that was unaffected by wet weather, the first in Queensland. It was officially named Queen Elizabeth II Jubilee Sports Centre by the Queen in 1977 to mark her Silver Jubilee. It was constructed in close proximity to both the Queen Elizabeth II Jubilee Hospital and Griffith University campus, which provided athlete accommodation.\nOriginally, the section of the stadium covered by roofing was intended to be the only permanent seating facility. The remainder of the stadium seating was built as \"temporary\" seating and was intended to be removed after the Commonwealth Games had finished. Public opinion resulted in the unroofed temporary seating being retained as permanent.\nThe stadium was named ANZ Stadium from 1993 to 2003 when it was the home of the Brisbane Broncos rugby league football team. The stadium currently has a capacity of 48,500 people, although the record crowd is 58,912, set during the 1997 Super League Grand Final which saw the Broncos defeat the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks 26–8. The capacity can be increased to 60,000 with the use of extra temporary seating in front of the Eastern and Western grandstands. These were removed when the running track was relaid for the 2001 Goodwill Games.\nIn 1999, ANZ Stadium hosted eventual champions Australia in their Davis Cup Semi-Final win over Russia 4–1. Temporary grass courts were erected up one end of the field and temporary stands on 3 sides. The crowd capacity for this event was 10, 600. 1999 Australian Open Champion and Russian Davis Cup player Yevgeny Kafelnikov described the court \"like playing on a potato field\" and \"that court is just not acceptable for this kind of event.\"\nIn 2002, ownership transferred to the Queensland Government Major Sports Facilities Authority and the venue was given its present name.\nWhile the athletics facilities are well utilised, the stands at the stadium have largely stood empty and unused since the Broncos returned to a redeveloped Lang Park in 2003.\nshow being played at the QSAC on 25 November 2009]]\nThe stadium has hosted a number of events, including:\n*11 editions of the Australian Championships in Athletics, the most of any existing venue\n*1982 – 1982 Commonwealth Games\n*1985 – Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band – 31 March 1985\n*1986 – Dire Straits, Brothers-in-Arms tour – 27 March 1986\n*1986 – World Junior Squash Championships\n*1986 - Pope John Paul II, Mass - 25 November 1986\n*1993 – U2 with Big Audio Dynamite II and Kim Salmon and the Surrealists – 20 November 1993\n*1993 – Madonna – 24 November 1993\n*1994 – 1994 Rugby League World Club Challenge\n*1995 – The Rolling Stones – 12 April 1995\n*1995 – The Eagles – 24 November 1995\n*1996 – Michael Jackson HIStory World Tour, 40,000 people – 19 November 1996\n*1997 – 1997 Super League Grand Final\n*1998 – U2 with Sidewinder – 25 February 1998\n*1999 – 1999 Davis Cup Semi-Final tie vs. Russia\n*2001 – Goodwill Games\n*2001/2002 – State of Origin series games\n*2002 – An assignment on the third season of The Mole, filmed in early 2002, where the contestants had to draw an animal using the painting machines normally used to mark the playing fields.\n*2006 – U2 with Kanye West – 7 November 2006\n*2009 – Pearl Jam with Relentless7 – 25 November 2009\n*2010 – AC/DC with Wolfmother – 25 and 27 February 2010\n*2010–2011 – This venue served as an evacuation centre for residents affected by the 2010–2011 Queensland floods\n*2014 – Matildas vs Brazil – 6 and 9 April 2014\n*2014 – 2014 FFA Cup round of 16 match between Olympic FC and Central Coast Mariners – 16 September 2014\n*2015 – AC/DC with The Hives – 12 and 14 November 2015\n*2017 – Guns N' Roses with Rose Tattoo – 7 February 2017\n*2018 – International friendly football match between South Korea and Uzbekistan – 20 November 2018\n*2019 – Eminem with Hilltop Hoods – 20 February 2019\nThe stadium is still actively used by athletes at a local, State and National level. Many local clubs such as Thompson Estate and Eastern Suburbs Athletics use it regularly for training.\nThe stadium has also permitted students of the neighbouring Griffith University (Nathan campus) to use its expansive carpark, free of charge. This is due to the relatively low availability of parking as well as the cost of parking on the campus (there is no free parking). Students who don't mind the ten-minute walk from the stadium take advantage of the large carpark.\nIn April 2023, a Right to Information application by Brisbane Times revealed plans for QSAC to be modified to become a temporary home for the Brisbane Lions AFL club while their home stadium, the Gabba, is demolished and rebuilt for the 2032 Summer Olympics.\nIt is planned that the athletics events at the 2032 Brisbane Olympics will be held at the stadium.\nNotable Rugby League Games\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
