      "text": "# Draft:Decibel (audio software)\n\nDecibel is an audio analysis plug-in developed by Process.Audio, designed for real-time metering, loudness monitoring, and spectral analysis in music production, broadcasting, and post-production. It provides detailed visual feedback on loudness units (LUFS), true peak, phase correlation, stereo balance, and dynamic range.\nOverview\nDecibel was introduced by Process.Audio as a next-generation metering suite aimed at bridging visual analysis with creative workflow. Unlike traditional metering tools, Decibel integrates multiple metering standards—including ITU-R BS.1770, EBU R128, and ATSC A/85—and displays comprehensive loudness and spectral data through an interactive graphical interface.\nThe software allows customization of meter layouts, colors, and targets, enabling engineers to adapt displays for mastering, mixing, and broadcast compliance. It supports major digital audio workstations (DAWs) such as Pro Tools, Logic Pro, Ableton Live, Cubase, and Studio One, operating as an AAX, VST, or AU plug-in.\nFeatures\n* Loudness and Peak Metering: Displays integrated, short-term, and momentary LUFS values alongside True Peak readings.\n* Spectral and Dynamic Analysis: Provides frequency spectrum visualization and crest-factor monitoring.\n* Phase and Stereo Tools: Includes a real-time phase scope and stereo balance meter.\n* Mobile Companion App: Syncs wirelessly with the Decibel Remote app for iOS and Android, allowing external device monitoring.\n* Multi-standard Compliance: Supports professional broadcast standards (EBU R128, ATSC A/85, and ITU BS.1770)\nReception and Use\nDecibel has been featured by professional audio publications and platforms such as Production Expert, Mixdown Magazine, and Gearspace, where it has been praised for its detailed visual interface, customizable layout, and efficient system performance. It is used by audio engineers and mastering professionals for mix consistency, streaming platform optimization, and broadcast loudness verification.\nReferences"
