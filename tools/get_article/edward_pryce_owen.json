He was the only son of Archdeacon Hugh Owen (1761–1827) by his wife Harriett née Jeffreys. He was the twenty-fifth in male descent from Edwin of Tegeingl, founder of the noble tribe of Powis. He was educated at St. John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a B.A. in 1810 and an M.A in 1816. After officiating for some time at Park Street Chapel, Grosvenor Square, London, he became vicar of Wellington, and rector of Eyton upon the Weald Moors, Shropshire, holding these livings from 27 February 1823 (Foster, Index Eccles.) till 1840. While travelling in France and Belgium, and (in 1840) in Italy, the Levant, Germany, and Switzerland, he made numerous drawings, from which he afterwards produced etchings and pictures in oils.\nHe contributed several plates to the ‘History of Shrewsbury,’ 1825, by Hugh Owen (his father) and J. B. Blakeway, and issued the following: 'Etchings of Ancient Buildings in Shrewsbury’ (with letterpress), Nos. 1 and 2 only, London, 1820–1, fol., ‘Etchings’ (portrait and forty-five plates), London, 1826, royal fol.; privately printed, and‘The Book of Etchings,’ vol. i. 1842; vol. ii. 1855.\nIn the latter part of his life Owen lived at Bettws Hall, Montgomeryshire.
