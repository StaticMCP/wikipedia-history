In 1697, he was raised to Prince of Schwarzburg.\nLife\nAnton Günther II was a son of Count Anton Günther I and his wife Countess Palatine Mary Magdalene of Birkenfeld.  In 1666 he succeeded his father, jointly with his older brother Christian William I.  In 1681, the brothers divided their inheritance, with Anton Günther II receiving the districts Ebeleben, Schernberg, Keula, and Arnstadt and thus founding a short-lived cadet line.  In 1697, the brothers were raised to Imperial Princes, but Anton Günther II refrained from using this title until 1709.\nAnton Günther II extensively renovated his residence in Arnstadt.  He was a major patron of music and an avid collector of antiques and objets d'art.  During his rule, Arnstadt became an important cultural center.  In 1702, he invited Johann Sebastian Bach, who was 17 years old at the time, to become court organist in Arnstadt.\nIn 1684, he married Augusta Dorothea (1666-1751), the daughter of Duke Anthony Ulrich of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel.  Their marriage remained childless and after his death, Arnstadt fell back to his brother Christian William.\nSee also\n* House of Schwarzburg\n* Schwarzburg-Sondershausen\nReferences\n* Friedrich Apfelstedt, Börner, and Donhof: Heimathskunde für die Bewohner des Fürstenthums Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, part 3: Geschichte des Fürstlich-Schwarzburgischen Hauses, 1856, reprinted May 1998\n* Friedrich Apfelstedt: Das Haus Kevernburg-Schwarzburg von seinem Ursprunge bis auf unsere Zeit,"
