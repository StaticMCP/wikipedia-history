It was proposed by the conductor Rafael Kubelík and members of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra as a part of the Prague Spring International Music Festival. The first competition took place in May, 1947. In 1957, the Prague Spring International Music Competition became one of the founding members of the World Federation of International Music Competitions.\nThe city hosts competitions that cater to different ages such as the Concertino Praga which focuses on young musicians up to 16 years.  In addition to youth competitions the country hosts the International competition of blind & partially sighted performers and composers which is held in Prague for young blind and partially sighted artists.  Also, all types of music are celebrating by Prague from the Beethoven's Hradec International Music Competition to the František Gregor International Double Bass Competition which is held in one to four-year cycles in the Moravian town of Kroměříž.  Some of the competitions, such as the Antonín Dvořák International Vocal Competition Karlovy Vary, was formerly only open to artists from Socialist bloc. Since 1989, after the collapse of the Eastern communist states, the competition is open without restrictions.\nOne of the latest international music events to be founded in the country is the International Bohuslav Martinů Festival and Choir Competition which started in 1999.  As of 2009, Czech Republic hosts more than fifty international music competitions.\nList of international music competitions in the Czech Republic\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n|width=\"200pt\" bgcolor=\"#ffdf9f\"|Competition\n|bgcolor=\"#ffdf9f\" width=5% |Founded\n|bgcolor=\"#ffdf9f\" class=unsortable|Main characteristics\n|-\n|width=\"200pt\"; bgcolor=\"#FFFACD\" valign=\"top\" |Prague Spring International Music CompetitionFounding member of the World Federation of International Music Competitions\n|1947\n|Founded in 1947, the Prague Spring International Music Competition is the oldest competitions in the Czech Republic.
