They had originally been planned for 2013 following constitutional changes expected to be passed after the compromise reached after the indirect 2011 election. However, on 6 July 2012, the Constitutional Court ruled that the presidential term could not be cut short in this way.\nFormer prime minister Hashim Thaçi was elected after a third round of voting, defeating Rafet Rama.\nElectoral system\nIn order to be elected, a candidate was required to receive at least 80 votes in the first two rounds of voting, equivalent to two-thirds of the 120 members of the Assembly. In the third round, the requirement was reduced to a simple majority of 60 votes.\nResults\nReferences"
