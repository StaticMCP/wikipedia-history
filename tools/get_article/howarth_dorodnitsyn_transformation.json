The transformation was first used by Anatoly Dorodnitsyn in 1942 and later by Leslie Howarth in 1948. The transformation of y coordinate (usually taken as the coordinate normal to the predominant flow direction) to \\eta is given by\n:\\eta = \\int_0^y \\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_\\infty} \\ dy,\nwhere \\rho is the density and \\rho_\\infty is the density at infinity. The transformation is extensively used in boundary layer theory and other gas dynamics problems.\nStewartson–Illingworth transformation\nKeith Stewartson and C. R. Illingworth, independently introduced in 1949, a transformation that extends the Howarth–Dorodnitsyn transformation to compressible flows. The transformation reads as\n:\\xi = \\int_0^x \\frac{c}{c_\\infty}\\frac{p}{p_\\infty} \\ dx,\n:\\eta = \\int_0^y \\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_\\infty} \\ dy,\nwhere x is the streamwise coordinate, y is the normal coordinate, c denotes the sound speed and p denotes the pressure. For ideal gas, the transformation is defined as\n:\\xi = \\int_0^x \\left(\\frac{c}{c_\\infty}\\right)^{(3\\gamma-1)/(\\gamma-1)} \\ dx,\n:\\eta = \\int_0^y \\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_\\infty} \\ dy,\nwhere \\gamma is the specific heat ratio.\nReferences"
