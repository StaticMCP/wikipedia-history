after filming the Giant series.\nThe first script reading was held on August 24, 2021. On November 9, 2021, the production company released site images from the series.\nInitially, actress Lee Deok-hee had been cast for the role of Queen Shinui, but this apparently was changed. In this drama, she portrays a mother-and-child relationship with Um Hyo-sup, again following Stranger.\nOn November 28, 2021, a report was confirmed that actor Ye Ji-won had tested positive for COVID-19 on November 27, and that filming would continue as scheduled except for her appearance.\nOn January 20, 2022, KBS released an apology for a horse's death on the set during filming of the seventh episode, when a scene was filmed showing the horse and its rider falling down. The horse's hind leg had been tied up with a wire, causing the horse to flip in the air and land on its neck. While the actor also sustained injuries, the horse died a week after the incident. KBS decided not to air two of the latest episodes originally set for release on January 22 and January 23, potentially due to the controversy.\nViewership\n| color1 = #A31A1C\n| color2 = #723A37\n| color3 = #415A52\n| color4 = #3F4555\n| legend1         = Ep. 1–8\n| legend2         = Ep. 9–16\n| legend3         = Ep. 17–24\n| legend4         = Ep. 25–32\n| season_title    = Episodes\n| width           = 800\n| height          = 200\n| country         = South Korea\n| -\n| 1.536\n| 1.536\n| 1.458\n| 1.544\n| 1.508\n| 1.156\n| 1.299\n|1.815\n| -\n|1.734\n|1.744\n|1.896\n|2.048\n| 1.297\n| 1.544\n|1.480\n| 1.626\n| -\n| 1.530\n|1.578\n|1.589\n|1.617\n|1.600\n|1.612\n|1.593\n|1.691\n| -\n|1.527\n|1.815\n|1.508\n|1.780\n|1.586\n|1.843\n|1.768\n|1.796\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto\"\n|+ Average TV viewership ratings\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"3\" |\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"3\" | Original broadcast date\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Average audience share\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | Nielsen Korea\n! scope=\"col\"| TNmS\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:7em\" | Nationwide\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:7em\" | Seoul\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:7em\" | Nationwide\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 1\n| December 11, 2021\n| 8.7%\n| 7.8%\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |  2\n| December 12, 2021\n|\n|\n| 8.6%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 3\n| December 18, 2021\n| 8.8%\n| 8.0%\n|9.2%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 4\n| December 19, 2021\n| 9.2%\n| 8.2%\n| 8.4%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 5\n| December 25, 2021\n| 8.7%\n| 8.2%\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 6\n| December 26, 2021\n|\n|\n|6.2%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 7\n| January 1, 2022\n| 7.4%\n| 6.6%\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 8\n| January 2, 2022\n|10.2%\n|9.3%\n|7.2%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 9\n| January 8, 2022\n|10.0%\n|9.2%\n|8.2%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 10\n| January 9, 2022\n|\n|8.9%\n|7.5%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 11\n| January 15, 2022\n|\n|\n|7.7%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 12\n| January 16, 2022\n| 11.2%\n|\n| 8.4%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 13\n| February 26, 2022|name=\"ext\"}}\n| 8.0%\n| 7.0%\n| 6.8%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 14\n| February 27, 2022\n| 9.0%\n| 8.4%\n| 8.5%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 15\n| March 5, 2022\n| 8.9%\n| 8.1%\n| 7.0%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 16\n| March 6, 2022\n|9.5%\n|8.8%\n|8.4%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 17\n| March 12, 2022\n|9.0%\n|8.1%\n|8.4%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 18\n| March 13, 2022\n|9.7%\n|9.4%\n| 8.5%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 19\n| March 19, 2022\n|9.9%\n|8.6%\n|8.7%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 20\n| March 20, 2022\n|9.9%\n|8.7%\n|9.0%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 21\n| March 26, 2022\n|9.5%\n|8.9%\n| 9.4%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 22\n| March 27, 2022\n|10.0%\n|9.1%\n|9.4%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 23\n| April 2, 2022\n| 10.1%\n| 9.1%\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 24\n| April 3, 2022\n| 10.7%\n| 9.8%\n| 9.2%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 25\n| April 9, 2022\n| 9.5%\n| 8.1%\n|rowspan=2\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 26\n| April 10, 2022\n| 11.5%\n| 10.1%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 27\n| April 16, 2022\n| 9.3%\n| 8.4%\n| 8.3%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 28\n| April 17, 2022\n|\n| 10.5%\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 29\n| April 23, 2022\n| 10.2%\n| 9.1%\n| 8.4%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 30\n| April 24, 2022\n| 11.3%\n| 9.9%\n| 9.8%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 31\n| April 30, 2022\n| 10.7%\n| 10.0%\n| 9.1%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 32\n| May 1, 2022\n| 11.5%\n| 10.4%\n| 9.0%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | Average\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" |\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"font-size:85%\" |\n* In the table above, the  represent the lowest ratings and the  represent the highest ratings.\n|}\nAwards and nominations\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+ Name of the award ceremony, year presented, category, nominee of the award, and the result of the nomination\n! scope=\"col\" | Award ceremony\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"  rowspan=\"2\" | APAN Star Awards\n| style=\"text-align:center\" rowspan=\"2\" | 2022\n| Top Excellence Award, Actor in a Serial Drama\n| Joo Sang-wook\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center\" rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n| Top Excellence Award, Actress in a Serial Drama\n| Park Jin-hee\n|\n|-\n|}\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
