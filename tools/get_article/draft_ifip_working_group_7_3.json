IFIP WG 7.3 was established in 1973, and focuses on using analytical models for improving the analysis and optimization of the performance and costs of data processing systems. The flagship conference of IFIP WG 7.3 is the Performance conference.\nThe scope of IFIP WG 7.3 is:\n* optimized allocation of resources (such as memory, telecommunication lines, computer power, and points of concentration and switching), in distributed information processing systems;\n* analyses of throughput and response time;\n* analyses of reliability in the presence of failures of hardware, software or telecommunications;\n* analyses of CPU main memory and I/O channel scheduling and allocating procedures;\n* analyses of storage systems including memory hierarchies and geographically distributed data bases;\n* comparison with simulations and with performance indices measured experimentally.\nPerformance conference\nThe flagship conference of IFIP WG 7.3 is Performance, the International Symposium on Computer Performance, Modeling, Measurements and Evaluation. The conference used to follow a cycle of 18-months, but this was later adapted to a frequency of one conference per year. The 43rd edition was held in Amsterdam in 2025. In 2024, the conference was joined with SIGMETRICS, the flagship conference of the ACM special interest group for the community on computer systems performance evaluation. These two conferences join approximately once every three years, and 2024 was the 16th edition.\nThe following list contains some locations of Performance conferences:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Location\n!Country\n|-\n|2025\n|Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)\n|Netherlands\n|-\n|2024\n|San Servolo Congress Center\n|Italy\n|-\n|2023\n|Northwestern University\n|USA\n|-\n|2022\n|Indian Institute of Technology Bombay\n|India\n|-\n|2021\n|Politecnico di Milano (fully virtual)\n|Italy\n|-\n|2020\n|Politecnico di Milano (fully virtual)\n|Italy\n|}\nNotable members (past & present)\nIFIP WG 7.3 has (had) notable members, of which some are a subject of Wikipedia articles:\n* Ian F.
