It was released on June 6, 2025, via a partnership between Big Loud and her own imprint, Pigasus.\nBackground\nWhitters wrote or co-wrote all but two of the 16 songs on Corn Queen, and Whitters' husband and longtime collaborator, Jake Gear, produced the album. The album's title is inspired by a nickname Whitters received from her fans, which derives from her upbringing in Iowa. Reflecting on the duality of the title, Whitters said: \"Corn is this simple, humble crop, and 'queen' implies royalty passed down through blood. I come from a long line of blue-collar farmers and construction workers. I've been out here for over a decade brushing my teeth in truck stop bathrooms, sleeping on hotel floors, driving myself from gig to gig. It's not glamorous, but I'm proud of it. I like the idea of a queen with little grit and elbow grease.\" Its cover artwork features a bust of Whitters made out of butter.\nCorn Queen was announced on April 4, 2025, and preceded by the release of four promotional singles — \"Casseroles\", \"Prodigal Daughter\", \"High on the Hog\", and \"High on a Heartbreak\". It features collaborations with Molly Tuttle, Charles Wesley Godwin, and The Wilder Blue.\nTrack listing\n| length2         = 3:26\n| title3          = Shotgun Wedding Baby\n| writer3         =\n| length3         = 3:00\n| title4          = Helluva Heart\n| writer4         =\n| length4         = 3:19\n| title5          = High on a Heartbreak\n| writer5         =\n| length5         = 3:44\n| title6          = It'll Do\n| writer6         =\n| length6         = 4:00\n| title7          = Hearsay\n| writer7         =\n| length7         = 3:09\n| title8          = Anything Like Me\n| writer8         =\n| length8         = 3:30\n| title9          = I Don't Want You\n| note9           = featuring Charles Wesley Godwin\n| writer9         =\n| length9         = 3:19\n| title10         = The Nail\n| writer10        =\n| length10        = 3:52\n| title11         = Casseroles\n| writer11        =\n| length11        = 3:40\n| title12         = Wagon\n| writer12        =\n| length12        = 3:34\n| title13         = Wholesome\n| writer13        =\n| length13        = 0:20\n| title14         = White Limousine\n| writer14        =\n| length14        = 4:12\n| title15         = Corn Queen\n| writer15        =\n| length15        = 3:20\n| title16         = DanceMor\n| note16          = featuring The Wilder Blue\n| writer16        =\n| length16        = 3:31\n| total_length    =\n}}\nReferences"
