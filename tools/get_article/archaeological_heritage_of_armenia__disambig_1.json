From that moment the Lower Paleolithic (Old Stone Age) culture began.\nPaleolithic Armenia\nThe diverse landscape of the Armenian Highland was exceptionally favorable for the habitation of hominids of the Paleolithic Homo species. Here the necessary raw materials for the creation of stone tools were available: andesite, dacite, obsidian, as well as a\nrich variety of hunting animals and vegetable food, including wide\nvariety of poaceae family plants, countless fresh springs, rivers and\ncreeks, which fulfilled the demand for drinking water anywhere in\nthe Highland.\nIn the last decades, several dozen sites of the Early Old Stone\nAge (Black Cross, Kurtan, etc.), and ancient assemblages of stone\ntools (Oldowan and Acheulian type of choppers, sharp edges tools,\nmassive hand cutters with bilateral finishing) have been discovered\nin the north of Armenia. The results of uranium-lead isotope decomposition\nindicate, that the absolute age of the early Acheulian\ncultural layers is 1,85-1,77 Myr. These are the oldest evidences of\nthe existence of Homo erectus in the Eurasian vast region.\nIn the late Acheulian (500-300 thousand years before present,\nhereinafter - Thyr) Armenia, tools (bifaces), hand axes, were found,\nmade of double-sided pieces of obsidian and dacite, leaf-shaped,\nwith sharp, symmetrical edges, the thick part of the base of the\ntools adapted to the human palm. To the North of Armenia, in the\nfoothills of the volcanic Javahk mountain range, around 30 ancient\nsites of the Old Stone Age were discovered: Blagodarnoe, Noramut,\netc., in one of which a cultural layer was uncovered, which\ncontained not only bifaces, but also the entire collection of their\npreparatory materials: cores, flakes, blades and other small items,\nthat testify the complete cycle of tool making at the site. The regular\nshapes, fine transverse section and careful finishing of the cutting\nedges of the Acheulian hand-axes made of dacite, indicate, that\ntheir main group dates back to the Late Acheulian epoch (500-250\nThyr).\nLate Acheulian finds were also discovered in the Hrazdan river\nvalley (Arzni, Nurnus, Satani Dar, Erkar Blur, Gutanasar, Jraber, Hatis, etc.), on the southwestern slopes of Artin\nMountain and the Aragats massif (Satani Dar,\nDashtadem).\nThe number of tools made by the Neanderthals,\nthe most advanced of the hominids found in\nthe Late Acheulian and Middle Paleolithic (250-40\nThyr) Armenia, reaches to thousands. In the middle\nphase of the Lower Paleolithic period, the Neanderthals\nlived in caves near rivers (Yerevan 1, Lusakert\n1–2, Arzni, Hovk, Kalavan, Aghitu, etc.) and in\nhigh plateaus (southern slopes of Aragats: Dashtadem,\nArteni, Syunik –at the foot of Amulsar and\nelsewhere). The Expedition of the Research Center\nof Historical and Cultural Heritage discovered\nlate Acheulian bifaces in 2012–2021, in the south\nof the Republic of Armenia, in Syunik region, at\nthe headwaters of Vorotan, on a plateau 2200–2300\nm above the sea level. Throughout the whole 5&nbsp;km\nlong and 2–3&nbsp;km wide upland area there are tens of\nthousands of obsidian cores, tools, rubble and fragments\ntypical of the Late Acheulian, Middle and\nUpper Palaeolithic era.\nArmenia is one of those places where in 120-\n100 Thyr inhabitation processes took place (Nor\nGeghi 1, Aghavnatun, Bagratashen). In the Late\nStone Age, 60-40 Thyr a number of caves were inhabited\n(Yerevan 1, Lusakert, Barozh). During the\nlast (Vyrumyan) glacial period, there were harsh\nclimatic conditions in the Armenian Highland, as a\nresult of which the traces of human-Homo Sapiens\nactivities are small in number (Aghitu - 35-24 Thyr\nand Kalavan 1 - 18-16 Thyr).\nNeolithic and Chalcolithic (Aeneolitic) Periods in Armenia\nIn 12 thousand years before present, after the\nend of the (Vyurmyan) Ice Age and the melting of\nthe glaciers along the eastern coast of the Mediterranean\n- in the Levant, on the slopes of the Eastern\nTaurus Mountains and in the northern Mesopotamia,\nwhich were rich in hunting animals and poaceae\nfamily plants, the hunter-gatherer groups began\nto cultivate these plants and tame animals. The\nterritory stretching from Eastern Taurus up to the\nGreater Caucasus Range, which separates the Middle East from the Eurasian Steppe, is an environment of sharp\nrelief variations, cut by high mountain ranges. At its center the\nArmenian Highland is located, the favorable climatic conditions\nof which enabled the local inhabitants to continue their hunting\nand gathering lifestyle, at the same time being engaged in animal\nhusbandry and food cultivation.\nThe presence of exceptionally rich resources of obsidian in\nthe Highland predetermined the culture of Armenia in the Neolithic\nperiod (New Stone Age). The obsidian in Arteni, Hatis and\nNemrut mountains, in the Vorotan river basin, Kotayk plateau\nand in other mines was not only processed in the local area,\nbut was also exported in large quantities to neighboring regions,\nparticularly to south-west Asia. A huge number of artifacts were\nmade from obsidian: agricultural and production tools, ritual\nobjects, weapons and jewelry. In Mesopotamia and in other\nvalley regions, the bartering of highly demanded obsidian and\nprimitive trade facilitated the accumulation of wealth and economic\nstratification among communities and later among larger\nsocial units. One of the important routes was the movement of\nthe Syunik obsidian from the ancient site of Godedzor to the\nbasin of Lake Urmia and to other valley regions of the Ubaid\nculture.\nAbout 7000 years BC a groups of settlements were formed\nin the Ararat valley, near the left-bank tributaries of the Araks River. Among them are the monuments Aratashen, Masis Blur (hill) and Aknashen, which were investigated within the framework of international archeological programs. These sites, especially Aknashen, are connected with the Shulaveri–Shomu culture that flourished in South Caucasus from about 6000 BC onward.\nThese late Neolithic villages consisted of densely built clusters\nof houses and of other structures. The majority of buildings\nbuilt of clay and mud (unfired) bricks had a round or oval floorplan.\nThe inhabitants cultivated several types of wheat, barley\nand lentils, raised sheep, goats and cattle, were engaged in hunting\nand fishing.\nThe excavations resulted in the discovery of a large number\nof artefacts skillfully made from obsidian, river stone, bone, antler\nand shell, which were used for processing wood and fur and\nsewing clothes from wool and leather.\nTwo important productions were introduced into Armenia's\nlate Neolithic economy: pottery and copper mining. The latter\nwas one of the first steps of mankind in metal processing. In the\n6th millennium BC collections, the local rough products dominated.\nHigh-quality, colorful vessels were also found, belonging\nto the Halaf style and were probably imported from Northern Mesopotamia. The jewelries, mainly beads, were also made\nof copper and became the first metal artefacts known to us\n(Choyunyu tepesi). Copper jewelries and artistic pottery led\nto the development of a new type of long-distance trade. Specialized\ncraft centers now became important raw material\nsupplying regions.\nThe Chalcolithic (also Eneolithic) period\nThe Chalcolithic (or Eneolithic) period in South-West Asia began in 5500-5200 BC and lasted for about two millennia until 3500 BC. It is characterized by the development of coppersmithing, although stone tools were still dominant in the economy.\nIn the last four decades, many Chalcolithic\nsettlements were discovered throughout the territory of modern\nArmenia. Four of which- Adablur and Teghut in the Ararat\nValley, Areni-1 in Vayots Dzor, Godedzor in Syunik, have\nbeen partially excavated. All of them date back to 4500-3400\nBC.\nTeghut was a small herders’ village involved in animal\nhusbandry, consisting of semi-earthen, round floorplan huts.\nHigh quality pottery, as well as copper tools imported from\nother places, were found here. Adablur was obviously bigger.\nThis settlement consisted of large, multi-room complexes that\nstretched along the streets. Remains of workshops and clay\nsculptures were found here.\nThe dry environment and stable temperature of the Areni-\n1 cave in the Arpa river gorge created excellent conditions\nfor the preservation of organic materials. Grain, fruit, cloth,\nleather and even grass, that were usually not preserved elsewhere,\nled us into an unknown world of artifacts, created\nduring the Chalcolithic period. Unique is the oldest known\nwinepress in the world, dating back to 4000 BC and the ancient\nleather shoe dating back to 3600 BC, found in the depth\nof the Areni cave.\nGodedzor is located in an area of high mountain, alpine\npastures. It was an important checkpoint and exchange center\nfor mobile herdsman. Here, was accumulated the obsidian,\nbrought from the mines located on the distance of two or three\ndays’ walk, and was then exported. The signs on the seals that\nwere put on clay, testify the existence of private, most likely\nfamily property marking tradition.\nArmenia in the Early Bronze Age (3500-2400 BC)\nIn the middle of the IV millennium BC, a unique culture was\nformed in Armenia, as well as some adjacent areas, which became known in archaeology as the Kura–Araxes culture. The earliest evidence for this culture is found on the Ararat plain. It survived for more than a millennium and, developing, covered a vast territory extending from the\nNorth Caucasus (Chechnya) to Israel (Dead Sea), from Eastern\nAsia Minor (Amid) to Central Iran (Godin Tepe) having the Armenian\nHighland at its core -particularly the Ararat valley and\nthe foothills near it.\nThe Armenian civilization, attested in the\nterritories of 12 modern states, is known to the scientific world\nunder various names. Among which, the most widespread are\nthe denominations Kur-Araks (Kura–Araxes) and Shengavit. This civilization is\ncharacterized by an agricultural sedentary economy, with more\nthan a thousand settlements densely covering the fertile riverside\nvalleys, high plateaus and high mountain zones of the Armenian\nHighland and neighbouring regions.\nThe Early Bronze Age artificial\nhill-settlements were characterized by multiple cultural layers,\nwhich in some places spread to tens of meters (Mokhrablur\nof Nakhijevan, Norsun-Tepe).\nThe economy was based on irrigated agriculture and cattle\nraising. Probably, it was at this period, that the huge irrigation\nsystems built on the slopes of Aragats and Geghama mountains\nwere formed and at the sources of canals, artificial water pools\nand springs, huge dragon stones (vishapakar) made from onepiece\nbasalt, typical of Armenian culture, were erected. Extremely\nplentiful were the flint inserts for sickles, work tools made of\nbone, obsidian and river stones.\nAnother prerequisite for unprecedented\neconomic development was copper production. A large\nnumber of weapon and tools made of arsenical bronze are attested\nby both the finds treasures near Yerevan and the stone and\nclay molds found in various ancient sites of Shengavit civilization\n(Shengavit, Margahovit, etc.). In the Shengavit ancient site,\nweight standards, similar to those used in the Levant, were found,\nwhich testify the Armenia's involvement in the newly formed international\ntrade relations in the Early Bronze Age.\nDiverse types of weapons are found: arrows, daggers, battle\naxes, spears and other weapons made of obsidian, flint, bone and\nbronze.\nMudbrick architecture was characteristic of this culture. The\nmudbrick made from sandy clay, with the help of mold forms\nand dried in the sun, was the main building material from which walls, temples, residential and economic buildings, hydro-engineering\nstructures were built. The foundations of the houses were\nmade of river stones, cracked or unprocessed basalt (Shengavit,\nHarich, Karaz, Amiranisgora, etc.), on which mudbrick walls\nwere raised. Round buildings with a diameter of 4–10 m and rectangular\nfloorplan were widespread. The latter had a flat, log roof,\nand the buildings with round floorplan had primitive roofs of\n“hazarashen” type, covered with clay mudbricks with reed, with\na skylights hole in the centre of the roof, that solved the issues of\nlight and ventilation of the house (Shengavit, Mokhrablur).\nThe\nfloors were of rammed earth. There were also plaster covered,\nup to 10&nbsp;cm thick (Shengavit) and red painted (Garakepek-Tepe)\nfloors. There are found samples of attempts to enliven the monotonous\nclay walls with decoration and with shaped arrangement of\nbricks of different color and to enlighten the monotonous appearance\nof the walls with various colors (Shengavit, Mokhrablur in\nNakhijevan, Yanik-tepe, etc.).\nAmong the settlements with an area of 1-10 ha, the central\nones were surrounded by fortified walls built of stone (Shengavit,\nGarni, Persi, Khorenia-Javakhk) and of mud-brick (Mokhrablur,\nGoy-tepe, Gudaberteke), with artificial puddles (Norabats,\nKvatskhelebi, Khizannat-gora). Noteworthy is the fortified wall\nof Shengavit with its stone foundations, reinforced with rectangular\nmasonry walls and a tiled secret passage leading to Hrazdan\nriver. The central urban areas, which are characterized by dense\nconstruction (Shengavit, Mokhrablur, etc.), were surrounded by\nsatellite-residences.\nThe bearers of the Shengavit culture had a complex religious\nsystem. In the central part of the Mokhrablur settlement, in the III\nconstruction horizon, a volume-spatial creation was uncovered: a\nstructure-tower with a rectangular plan (7,4x5,5 m) constructed\nwith hard tuff, in the eastern part of which a 3,9 m long one-piece\nbasalt altar was placed. Near this stone structure, clay buildings\nand ash pits were uncovered, in which the ashes of the sacred\nhearths had been accumulated.\nMany tufa idols, clay hearths were excavated in the Shengavit\nsettlement.\nIn 2012 year a complex cult system was excavated-a\nroom with a rectangular plan, designed specifically for ritual ceremonies,\ninside which a clay altar was uncovered decorated with\nrelief ornaments on its front. A statue of an idol was affixed into\nthe altar and goblets for libation were placed in front of the heart.\nTo the right from the stairs leading to the semisubterranean room\nof the shrine, two clay–packed basins were found, in which the\nashes from the sacred fire were kept. A phallic pendant-idol was\nfound in the shrine, which was probably the identifying symbol\nof the priestess. The adjacent room of the complex reflects household\nactivities.\nA similar cultic complex was found at the ancient\nsite of Pulur (Sakyol). (This location was later flooded by the Keban Dam). Inside the religious structures, in front of the altars, terracotta\ncult hearths were located, which were unique to the Shengavit\nculture, with a diameter of up to one meter, the edges of the inner\nspace resembled a ship bow divided into three parts, the upper\nplatforms were red-painted and decorated with geometric figures.\nStatuette of women and men, as well as of worship animals,\nsuch as horses, bulls and rams were found near these hearths.\nThe horseshoe-shaped mobile shrines with ram protomes, threelegged\npedestals, phallus-shaped pendant figures were also of religious\nnature.\nOne of the inseparable spheres of religious practice was the\nburial ritual. Outside the settlements, special burial grounds were\nformed in their immediate vicinity. Both individual tombs with\nearthen and tiled walls, as well as wide ancestral tombs with stone\nwalls were revealed, in which the deceased (Joghaz) of the upper-class family were sequentially buried. In the final stage of this\ncivilization, collective burials were performed, in which human\nsacrifices were also performed. These tombs contain numerous\nartifacts, that indications of social stratification: gold and silver\njewelry, bronze tools and weapons, imported valuable items.\nEarly city-type settlements, temples, fortified walls, advanced\ncraftsmanship-metallurgy, stonework/masonry, pottery,\ntextile production, wine and beer production, transport, unified\nweight system, ritually formed system, elite tombs and other features\ntestify the high level of development of the Shengavit civilization.\nArmenia in the Middle Bronze Age (2400/2300-1500 BC)\nAt the depth of the Shengavit civilization, a new, early burial mound\nculture was formed, which yet preserved separate pottery traditions. In\nthe middle of the 3rd millennium BC major changes took place in the socio-\ncultural, as well as political life of Armenia. The Shengavit social-cultural\nwholeness, that was experiencing a deep economic crisis, finally collapsed.\nIndo-European tribes settled in the central and northern regions of\nthe Armenian Highland. As a result of the fusion of newcomers and locals,\narchaeological cultures of early burial mounds, Treghk-Vanadzor, Karmir\nBerd, Sevan-Artsakh and Karmir Vank were formed. Acting as a group of\nrelated cultures, they occupied almost the entire territory of the Armenian\nHighland-the range of the basins of Urmia, Vana and Sevan lakes and the\nneighbouring areas, up to the Great Caucasus mountain range. In contrast\nto the Shengavit civilization, the economy of the Middle Bronze Age was\ndominated by animal husbandry. This is witnessed not only by the osteological\nmaterials, but also by the abundance of burial grounds, which\nmake up 70% of the monuments known to us. The earliest samples of\ndomestic horse sacrifice are attested (Nerkin Naver, 23rd-21st centuries\nBC).\nTrophy also played an important role in the economy of the Middle\nBronze Age. After successful wars, huge funds were accumulated in the\nhands of the leader-kings and councils, which became the basis for the\nflourishing of art and crafts. In the “Palace” workshops, skilled craftsmen\nprepared exceptional pieces of art. Armenia was involved in the international\ntrade network, the evidence of which is the similarity of luxury items,\nweapons, and precious metalware with archaeological artifacts found in the\ncenter of Southwest Asia.\nIn architectural forms dominant were the constructions with rectangular\nfloorplan (Yerkaruk Blur, Metsamor, Ashtarak fort). Immense burial\nmounds appeared intended for individual burials, consisting of a stone armour,\nwith cromlech lined around its perimeter and with earthen, rockhewn\nor stone-covered burial cells with rectangular, sometimes rounded\ncorners, dug in the central part. The deceased were laid in the grave with\ntheir limbs bent, men lying on their right, women on their left. Deceased\nmembers of the elite were cremated. This ritual, as in the Hittite kingdom,\nwas the monopoly of the council of elders and priests. The diameter of\nroyal tombs reached 50 m, with depth of 7 m and with the area of the tomb\nhalls of 150 square meters.\nIn the Middle Bronze Age, the cremation ritual specific to the elite of\nArmenia, the huge sizes of tombs, the luxurious as well as gold and silver\ndishes, imported items, human sacrifices matched with the Hittite and Mesopotamian royal tombs. Such tombs were excavated in Treghk, Martkopi, Alazani\nValley, Javahkq, Aruch, Mayisyan, Karashamb, Vanadzor, Nerkin Naver, Gorayk and\nelsewhere.\nExceptional is the Zorats karer (Karahunj) monument near the city of Sisian. The\nstone path of circular and straight lined menhirs (upright standing stones) stretches for\nhundreds of meters. Some scientists believe, that it was once an ancient observatory.\nThe cultural heritage of the Middle Bronze Age of Armenia, the exquisite masterpieces\nof applied art and artistic metalwork (toreutics) are among the brightest pages\nof the centuries-old creativity of the Armenian people, when the tribal creative spirit\nbursts with indescribable power, creating masterpieces of art inspired with barbaric\ngrandeur (gold cups covered with precious stones, and doule-layers of Treghk, with\nheraldically positioned lion sculptures of Vanadzor, silver, episodic decorated cups of\nKarashamb and Koruktash with ancient sayings of Indo-European mythology depicted\nson them). There was a great variety of jewels and luxury items: dressers, necklaces,\nbeads, cufflinks, mirrors and others, made of gold, silver, bronze, semi-precious stones (cornelion, jasper, jet stone, onyx, obsidian,\namethyst, etc.), multicolor glasses and\ntinglazed pottery.\nIn the applied art, noteworthy was the multicolor\nand single-color pottery, the ornamentation\nof which almost resembled to painting,\nwith its play of colors and expressiveness (Nerkin\nNaver, Treghq, Getashen, Elar, Aparan,\nAruch, etc.). Vessels with black polished, relief\nzones and dotted decorations are also highly\nvaluable artistic pieces, which together with\ncolorful pottery formed the festive tableware.\nArmenia in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages (1500-900 BC)\nAs a result of the evolutionary development of the Middle\nBronze Age, the unified culture of the Late Bronze Age was formed\nin Armenia. It was characterized with the wide spread of cities, fortifications,\nmonumental architecture, with the formation of the class\nof kings and princes at the highest level of society, of the aristocracy\nsurrounding them and the class of professional warriors, as\nwell as with the appearance of the first samples of the earliest written\nmonuments (Verin Naver, Shamiram, Utik). In the Armenian\nHighland and also in Kakheti (Georgia), i.e., in the whole area of\nMiddle Bronze Age, that includes colored pottery, a uniform culture\nof the Late Bronze Age was established-weapons, jewelries,\ntools and household items were copied with exceptional similarity\nin monuments placed hundreds of kilometers far. Particularly powerful\ncenters were formed in Aragatsotn (Verin Naver, Metsamor\nOshakan, Ujan, Shamiram), in Sevan Lake Basin (Lchashen), in Artsakh (Arajadzor), in Utik (Khanlar), in Gugark (Vanadzor, Lori\nBerd), in Shirak (Horom, Harich, Artik), in Upper Armenia (Bardzr\nHayk) and elsewhere. As a result of the merger of the tribes and\ntribal unions of the Armenian Highland, in which dominant was\nthe Indo-European ethnic element, the first powerful state formations\nwere created: Etiuni, Hayasa, Mitani, Armenia-Shubria, etc.\nIn this period, ends the first stage of formation of the Armenian\ncivilization.\nArmenia is one of those regions of the ancient world, where\nthe principles of fortifications originated and were formatted. The\nprinciple of building strong fortified wall chains in order to protect\nthe settlements from external danger and to control the approach\nroutes, was launched in Armenia in the Early Bronze Age, was\ndeveloped in the Middle Bronze Age (Ashtarak Fortress), but was\nfinally formed and widely used in the Late Bronze Age, laying\nthe foundation for the culture of the so-called “Cyclopean” castles\nor forts, highly typical to the Armenian culture. They had 3-7\nrows of surrounding fortified walls and occupied an area of 40-60\nhectares, and in some separate cases- more than 100 hectares of\narea (Motkan Fortress). Almost the entire territory of the Armenian\nHighland was densely covered with forts (several hundred\nof forts are known), which were built in places difficult to access:\non the high slopes of mountains, on the conical tops of hills, on\npromontories surrounded on three sides by steep gorges. Among\nthe characteristic features of the forts were the maximum use of\nthe opportunities of its relief, the strengthening of walls and entrances\nwith rectangular masonry, the establishment of seven rows\nof walls on the road leading to the fort. The preserved height of the\nwalls reaches to 7 m (Tghit), the thickness is 3–6 m (Motkan fort,\nTsitsernakaberd, etc.).\nTemple complexes were excavated in Dvin, Metsamor\nand Gegharot. In the sanctuaries of Dvin, terracotta rectangular\nboard-altars, decorated with animals and geometric relief figures,\nwere discovered, in front of which unquenchable fire was lit. The\nhuman-shaped sculptures of various sizes in the adoration position\nuncovered in Metsamor Cathedral, symbolized the trinity of father,\nmother and son.\nThe tombs of the elite had stone-earthen tombs up to 50 m in\ndiameter and 2 m in height, in the central part of which were half\nground-dug tomb halls, with a rectangular floorplan, built of tufa\nand basalt giant stones with flattened fronts. They had both straight\nlined walls and log-slab comlex roofs (Lchashen, Verin Naver,\nZorats Karer), as well as walls gradually narrowing upwards and\nstructures covered with one-piece slabs (Verin Naver, Shamiram). The walls of the tombhalls were covered with carpets, rugs and\nexpensive animal furs. Specially brought river stones were used\nto form the cromlechs, from which started the tomb entrances,\nthat sloped down to the tomb hall (dramos). The sizes of the\ntombs, the richness and multi-functionality of the funerary offerings\n(weapons, tools, symbols of power), ritual objects, jewelries,\nhousehold and cult objects, chariots, carts and catafalques,\nhuman, bird, domestic and wild animal, including lion (Verin\nNaver) large number sacrifices testify the burials of kings and\nsupreme priests at this sites.\nIn the royal tomb (16th-15th centuries BC), excavated in Verin\nNaver, in 2012, were found items imported from Babylon\n(glazed clay beads), Persian Gulf (sea snails from the Persian\nGulf), China (jade), medallions (bitum) with engraved portraits\nof leader-kings covered with gold plate and cufflinks with images\nof argali and trees of life. These items have strong resemblance\nto the samples of Middle Elamite art.\nUnique is the round bronze sculpture belonging to the middle\nof the II millennium BC. The realism, that was characteristic\nof the ancient art of Armenia of this era reached to an admirable\nexpressiveness. Metal-plastic samples were made of melted\nbronze with high fluidity, in wax molds, which implied that each\nof them was unique and unrepeatable. Bronze sculpture is characterized\nwith a highly specific thematic repertoire. It represents\nanthropomorphic deities, mythological heroes, worshiped animals\n(bull, goat, deer) and birds (golden eagle, dove, etc.). These\nstatues were attached to crosiers, coats of arms (shtandart) and\nchariots. Noteworthy are the group of sculptures with mythological\nplots, the compositions of which are characterized with\nrhythmic balance. Notable are the scale models of two-wheeled\nchariots, in which the position of the torsos of the warriors give\nus the sense of the galloping style of the chariots.\nThe sculpture of a bearded soldier is unique in the metalwork\nof Lori Fortress. The sculpture of this hero with swastikas\n(Armenian eternity sign) on his thighs, broad-shoulder, narrow-\nback and powerful thighs seemed to foreshow the foundations\nof masculine beauty, that later became canonical in Greek\nart. The sculpture of a hero in Shirakavan, with chained fearsome\nwild beast (lion) depicts the characters of the hero and the\nbeast endowed with tremendous strength. Most likely, it is the\nprototype of the lion-shaped Mher - one of the favorite heroes of\nthe Armenian epic poetry.\nIn the Early Iron Age, metalwork was of smaller size. There\nwere found miniatures of battle idols, figurines of women and men, as well as of dogs, goats, horses, deer and birds, which characterize\nthe peculiarities of the heroes: strength, elegance, fierce\nnature, athletic figure, etc. (Paravakar, Ayrum, Artsvakar).\nA special field of art is the iconography of bronze belts.\nAmong the hundreds of belts found in Armenia, the examples\nof Lchashen, Stepanavan and Astgh hill are the most noticeable\nones. Broad bronze plates depict (with carvings) sacred conception,\nmythological and domestic, battle and hunting scenes. The\ncentral plot is surrounded by two-three rows of edgeband with\nfir-shape or “running” gyre decorations. Carved figures have solemn-\nstatic or pronounced plastic mobility. Along with realistic\nfigures, there are also numerous figures of people and animals of\nfantastic shape. Depictions of deer, goat, bird, celestial luminary,\nlion-faced men and horned horses (unicorns) were particularly\nwidespread. The chariot battle scenes give an idea of the structure\nof the Armenian armed forces of that period, which consisted of\nheavily weaponed infantry, armed with long spears and rectangular,\nlarge shields, of light cavalry, vanguard and rearguard regiments.\nThe personal seals of the kings and rulers of Mesopotamia\nfound in the tombs of the elite (Metsamor) testify, that the Armenian\narmies fought successful battles in the territory of the most\npowerful states, bringing rich booty from there.\nArmenia in the Achaemenid and Hellenistic periods\nAt the beginning of the 6th century BC, in the Middle East,\nthe kingdoms of new Assyria, Babylon, Egypt and Van were\ndestroyed. The vast polity called Urartu or Armina, (mentioned\nin the Behistun trilingual inscription of Darius the Great) which\nstretched from Anti-Taurus mountains to the Caspian Sea, from\nMesopotamia to the banks of the Kur River, belonged to the\nArmenian Yervandean (Orontid) dynasty. Armenia is mentioned\nin the works of the 6th century Greek historian Hecataeus of\nMiletus, Herodotus, Xenophon, Polybius, Strabo and of others.\nArmenia became the full political and cultural heir of the\nKingdom of Van.  After 5 bloody battles, Armenia got under the\ncontrol of Achaemenid Persian Empire. Darius the Great formed\nthe 13th and 18th satrapies in Armenia. The Royal road built by\nDarius the Great passed though Armenia and connected Persia\nwith the Mediterranean. The Yervandean (Orontid) kings had an\nimportant role in Achaemenid Persia and had a semi-independent\nstatus.\nIn Yervandean Armenia, several spheres flourish, among\nthem the artistic metalwork, the best examples of which were found near the Erebuni fortress, in Armavir, Van, Yerznka and\nelsewhere, as well as the glyptic (hardstone carving) and the so-called apadana architecture (Erebuni).\nIn the decisive Battle of Gaugamela (331) by Alexander the\nGreat's eastern campaign, the Armenian troops fighting on the\nright wing of Darius III army, severely pressured the Macedonians.\nAfter the collapse of the Achaemenid Empire and the establishment\nof the Seleucid Empire, Armenia was gradually included\nin the Hellenistic civilization. Armenia was independent\nduring the time of Alexander and his Diadochi.\nIn 201, another Yervandean dynasty member, Artashes\nI (201-163 BC), took the throne from Yervand, the king of\nthe Greater Armenia. In 189 BC, Artashes declared Armenia\nas an independent country and reunited the borders\nof Yervandean Armenia, bringing back the lost provinces.\nIn Strabo's Geography it is testified, that at that\ntime everyone in Armenia spoke Armenian. Aramaic\nwas also used by the elite, in which the boundary stones\nof Artashes I are recorded. During the reign of the Artaxiad\ndynasty, urban development flourished in Armenia.\nAlong with the ancient cities of Van, Armavir, Erebuni, the\nArmenian kings founded dozens of other cities, which they\nnamed after themselves: Samosat, Arsamea, Arshamashat,\nYervandashat, Tigranakert and Artashat. The latter, according\nto Plutarch's testimony, was built by the advice of the Carthage\nmilitary commander Hannibal. These were some of the populous\nand prosperous cities on the Silk Road, an international trade\nroute that stretched from China and India to the Mediterranean,\nattested by a number of Greco-Roman historians. Local, eastern\nand western cultures were reflected in them, as attested by the\nresults of the excavations. Various crafts flourished. Armenia imported\ngoods and exported agricultural and handicraft products,\nminerals, as attested by the Roman historian Pliny the Elder. The\nmasters of Armenia were especially skilled in artistic metalwork.\nThis is evidenced by the highly artistic jewelry found in Van, Armavir,\nArtashat, and Lori fortress: bracelets ending with animal\nheads, brooches, precious metal dishes.
