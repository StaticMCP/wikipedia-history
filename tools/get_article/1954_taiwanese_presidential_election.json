The vote took place at the Chung-Shan Hall in Taipei. Incumbent President Chiang Kai-shek was re-elected for the second term. The premier Chen Cheng was elected to be the Vice-President.

According to the Temporary Provisions against the Communist Rebellion, the term of the delegates who were elected during the 1947 Chinese National Assembly election was extended indefinitely until \"re-election is possible in their original electoral district\". In total, there were 1,578 delegates reported to the secretariat to attend this second session of the first National Assembly.\nThe 1947 National Assembly election elected 2,961 delegates for the 3,045 seats of the National Assembly. About half of them did not flee to Taiwan with the government. The 1,578 delegates reported to this session barely passed the 50% requirement (1,523) of the National Assembly to hold a valid meeting.\nResults\nPresident\nVice-president\nSee also\n*History of Republic of China\n*President of the Republic of China\n*Vice President of the Republic of China\nReferences"
