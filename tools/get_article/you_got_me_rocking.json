The song was written by Jagger/Richards and produced by Don Was and the Glimmer Twins. It was released as a single in the UK in September 1994 by Rolling Stones Records/Virgin Records, where it reached  23 on the UK Singles Chart. It was also released as a single in the United States, reaching number 13 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart in 1995. A recording from the 1997–1998 Bridges to Babylon Tour opened the 1998 live album No Security. It was also included on the Stones' 2002 career retrospective, Forty Licks.\nBackground and composition\nBegun early in 1993, \"You Got Me Rocking\" was initially a blues flavoured number; bootlegs have Jagger and Richards working the song as a slower, blues flavoured ramble, with Jagger shouting the hook \"you got me rocking\". Changed to a straightforward rocker in the vein of \"Start Me Up\", the song quickly evolved as Richards made the transition from piano to guitar. The lyrics moved to a more upbeat tone, as singer Mick Jagger presents redemption from a series of career ending instances of various professionals:\nThe lyrics can be interpreted as an answer to the Rolling Stones' critics, who often deride the band for their advancing age. Recording on \"You Got Me Rocking\" lasted from mid-summer to early winter 1993, when final touches were put on.\nCritical reception\nLarry Flick from Billboard magazine wrote, \"The Stones' signature sound is contorted into a rave-spiced disco twirler, thanks to imaginative touch of U.K. producer Paul Oakenfold, who enhances the hook and Mick Jagger's vocal with an urgent bassline and sparkling synths. Already sparking airplay on import, this festive single wisely acknowledges youth-oriented trends at street level, which should help Virgin entice widespread top 40 and crossover programmer support.\"\nLive performances\n\"You Got Me Rocking\" is notable as one of the few latter-day songs from the band's career to remain on their setlist long after being released. The song was performed some 50 times during the 2005–2006 A Bigger Bang Tour.\nB-side\nThe B-side is the little-known \"Jump on Top of Me\", which also appears on the soundtrack to Prêt-à-Porter. \"You Got Me Rocking\" appeared on the soundtrack to The Replacements in 2000.\nTrack listings\n* 7-inch VS1518\n#\"You Got Me Rocking\"\n#\"Jump on Top of Me\"\n* Cassette VSC1518\n#\"You Got Me Rocking\"\n#\"Jump on Top of Me\"\n* CD VSCDE1518\n#\"You Got Me Rocking\"\n#\"Jump on Top of Me\"\n* CD VSCDT1518\n#\"You Got Me Rocking\"\n#\"Jump on Top of Me\"\n#\"You Got Me Rocking\" (Perfecto Mix)\n#\"You Got Me Rocking\" (Sexy Disco Dub Mix)\n* CD VSCDG1518 - digipak\n#\"You Got Me Rocking\"\n#\"Jump on Top of Me\"\n#\"You Got Me Rocking\" (Perfecto Mix)\n#\"You Got Me Rocking\" (Sexy Disco Dub Mix)\nPersonnel\nThe Rolling Stones\n* Mick Jagger – lead and backing vocals, maracas\n* Keith Richards – electric guitar, \"mystery guitar\", backing vocals\n* Ronnie Wood – slide guitar\n* Charlie Watts – drums\nAdditional Performers\n* Darryl Jones – bass\n* Chuck Leavell – piano\n* Bernard Fowler, Ivan Neville – backing vocals\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1994)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|Australia (ARIA)\n|align=\"center\"|64\n|-\n|\n|-\n|Iceland (Íslenski Listinn Topp 40)\n|align=\"center\"|10\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|UK Airplay (Music Week)\n|align=\"center\"|21\n|-\n|UK Dance (Music Week)\n|align=\"center\"|6\n|-\n|UK Club Chart (Music Week)\n|align=\"center\"|4\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Chart (1994)\n!Position\n|-\n|US Album Rock Tracks (Billboard)\n|align=\"center\"|32\n|}\nRelease history\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Region\n!scope=\"col\"|Date\n!scope=\"col\"|Format(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|Label(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|United Kingdom\n|26 September 1994\n|\n|rowspan=\"3\"|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia\n|17 October 1994\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Japan\n|2 November 1994\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|}\nReferences"
