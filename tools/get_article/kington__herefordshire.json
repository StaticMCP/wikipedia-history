The parish had a population of 3,240.\nGeography\nKington is  from the border with Wales, and lies on the western side of Offa's Dyke. The town is in the shadow of Hergest Ridge, and on the River Arrow, where it is crossed by the A44 road. It is  northwest of Hereford, the county town. Nearby towns include Presteigne, Builth Wells, Knighton and Leominster. The centre of the town is situated at  above sea level. The civil parish covers an area of .\nHistory\nThe name Kington is derived from 'King's-ton', being Anglo-Saxon for \"King's Town\", similar to other nearby towns such as Presteigne meaning \"Priest's Town\" and Knighton being \"Knight's Town\".\nThe land on which Kington is sited was held by Anglo-Saxons in 1066, but devastated. After the Norman Conquest Kington then passed to the Crown on the downfall in 1075 of Roger de Breteuil, 2nd Earl of Hereford. Before 1121, King Henry I gave Kington to Adam de Port, who founded a new Marcher barony in this part of the early Welsh Marches. Kington seems to have been a quiet barony and was associated with the office of sheriff of Hereford. In 1172, Adam de Port, probably the great-grandson of Henry Port, rebelled and fled the country. He returned in 1174 with a Scottish army, only to flee from the resulting Battle of Alnwick to the great mirth of the Norman court. With this his barony of Kington was taken by the Crown and became an appurtenance of the office of Sheriff of Hereford, finally being granted to William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber in 1203 for £100. The castle then saw action in the Braose Wars against King John, and is likely to have been destroyed by royal forces in August 1216. Within a few years a new fortress was commenced and the nearby Huntington Castle and Kington Castle were abandoned. All that remains of Kington Castle today is a great outcrop of rock topped by a few fragmentary earthworks. The old town clustered around the castle and Norman church on top of a defensive hill above the River Arrow.\n, situated on higher ground above the town centre]]\n‘Chingtune' was recorded in the Domesday Book in 1086, the name meaning 'king's town or manor', high on the hill above the town where St. Mary's Church now stands. The new Kington, called Kyneton in the Fields, was laid out between 1175 and 1230 on land bordering the River Arrow and possibly designated as part of the Saxon open-field system.\nSituated on the direct route the drovers took from Hergest Ridge and with eight annual fairs, Kington grew in importance as a market town, and there is still a thriving livestock market on Thursdays. The town retains the medieval grid pattern of streets and back lanes.\nIn the chapel of St. Mary's Church, there is the alabaster tomb of Sir Thomas Vaughan of nearby Hergest Court, slain at the Battle of Banbury in 1469, and his wife, Elen Gethin. The ghost of Sir Thomas, and also that of the Black Dog of Hergest, are said to haunt the area around Hergest Ridge. The Black Dog's sighting reputedly presages death.\nGovernance\n]]\nAn electoral ward in the name of Kington Town exists. This ward had a population taken at the Kington Parish of 3,240. The former Kington Town Hall was completed in 1820.\nPopulation\nCensus data is as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Population !!

The nearest met office weather station is Lyonshall, around  to the east of the town.\nThe absolute maximum temperature recorded is  during August 1990.\nIn an average year however, the warmest day should record ,\nwith a total of 7.7 days reporting a value of  or above.\nThe absolute minimum temperature is ,\nreported in December 1981. Typically 44 nights should record an air frost.\nRainfall averages around  a year, with over  falling on 136 days. All averages refer to the period 1971 to 2000.\n, 1971–2000, extremes 1960–2007\n|collapsed =\n|metric first = y\n|single line = y\n|Jan record high C = 14.1\n|Feb record high C = 16.8\n|Mar record high C = 21.1\n|Apr record high C = 24.0\n|May record high C = 25.5\n|Jun record high C = 31.2\n|Jul record high C = 33.0\n|Aug record high C = 33.5\n|Sep record high C = 25.8\n|Oct record high C = 21.5\n|Nov record high C = 16.6\n|Dec record high C = 14.4\n|year record high C = 33.5\n|Jan high C = 6.4\n|Feb high C = 6.7\n|Mar high C = 9.4\n|Apr high C = 11.9\n|May high C = 15.5\n|Jun high C = 18.3\n|Jul high C = 20.9\n|Aug high C = 20.4\n|Sep high C = 17.2\n|Oct high C = 13.1\n|Nov high C = 9.4\n|Dec high C = 7.3\n|year high C = 13.1\n|Jan low C = 1.1\n|Feb low C = 1.0\n|Mar low C = 2.6\n|Apr low C = 3.9\n|May low C = 6.5\n|Jun low C = 9.3\n|Jul low C = 11.5\n|Aug low C = 11.1\n|Sep low C = 9.0\n|Oct low C = 6.3\n|Nov low C = 3.5\n|Dec low C = 2.0\n|year low C = 5.7\n|Jan record low C = −15.8\n|Feb record low C = −12.8\n|Mar record low C = -10.6\n|Apr record low C = −4.2\n|May record low C = -2.2\n|Jun record low C = 0.8\n|Jul record low C = 2.2\n|Aug record low C = 3.3\n|Sep record low C = -0.6\n|Oct record low C = −4.2\n|Nov record low C = −7.2\n|Dec record low C = −16.5\n|year record low C = −16.5\n|Jan precipitation mm = 91.8\n|Feb precipitation mm = 68.0\n|Mar precipitation mm = 68.0\n|Apr precipitation mm = 58.6\n|May precipitation mm = 55.2\n|Jun precipitation mm = 59.2\n|Jul precipitation mm = 46.6\n|Aug precipitation mm = 62.8\n|Sep precipitation mm = 74.9\n|Oct precipitation mm = 81.9\n|Nov precipitation mm = 80.3\n|Dec precipitation mm = 98.5\n|year precipitation mm =\n|source 1 = Met Office\n|source 2 = KNMI\n|date=March 2011\n}}\nEconomy\nIn the 13th century the new medieval town was formed at the foot of the hill and became primarily a wool-trading market town on an important drovers' road. Its location and historic character is the reason why so many waymarked long-distance footpaths pass through Kington today, including the Mortimer Trail, the Herefordshire Trail and the Offa's Dyke Path. The Black and White Village Trail follows the half-timbered cottages and houses in local Herefordshire villages.\nIn the 1870s, an assessment was thus: \"The trade of the town is chiefly with the agriculturists of the adjoining county of Radnor. There are two banking establishments, viz., the head offices of the Kington and Radnorshire bank (Messrs. Davies, Banks, & Davies), established in 1808, and a branch of the Midland Banking Company, Limited. There is an extensive iron foundry, nail, and agricultural implement manufactory carried on by Messrs. James. Meredith & Co., and the building and tanning trades are well represented. There are also some extensive corn mills and malt-houses. About four miles west of the town are the Old Radnor lime rocks, which are celebrated for their superior quality for building and for agricultural purposes. The market day is Tuesday, considerable business being transacted on that day in eggs, butter, poultry, &c., and is the mart to which the Welsh send their produce, to meet dealers who frequent this town from all quarters.\"\nDuring the Second World War, the large Kington Camp was constructed close to the town by the War Office. It was first used by the British as a re-grouping point after Dunkirk, housing returned soldiers in often poor conditions. In 1943-4, Wimpeys built two US General Hospitals to cater for predicted wounded from the European campaigns. Each employed 500 US military and administrative personnel and 50 local people. There were administrative buildings, labs, operating theatres and dental clinics as well as personnel quarters, chapels, rehabilitation wards, cinemas, mess halls, warehouses, and laboratories. Between 1944–1945 there were 13,000 patients. After the war buildings were used by the Polish Resettlement Corps (many of the Poles who had fought alongside Western allies did not wish to return to a newly communist dominated Poland). Many of the buildings at the Camp remain standing, although two-thirds have disappeared since the Second World War. Some are used by local businesses.\nThe Kington economy has suffered along with the fortunes of the farming industry in the area. Its rural location and lack of good transport connections means local unemployment has been high for many decades, with low pay rates and many part-time occupations in small businesses including farming and the retail and service sectors. There is a small tourist industry, though concentrated in the summer months, but it maintains the air of an unspoilt town on the borders.  There is a traditional livestock market, situated off Duke Street, on a Thursday, where farmers bring their stock to market.  There is currently a weekly food and crafts market every Friday and also a W.I market in Bridge Street on Friday morning, home cooked goods are sold.\nThe High Street has a number of resilient and interesting independent shops.\nKington Connected (KC3)\nKC3 was begun in 1993, when BT Group, Apple, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Rural Development Commission chose Kington to host a pilot study into the effect that IT and sophisticated telecommunications might have on small communities. Fifteen ISDN lines were installed for digital data transmission and KC3 became a remote office and payroll service for companies including ICI and banks, with remote work. There was also significant support to local businesses and schools. In 2006, KC3 split the commercial side from the community and voluntary side. The community and voluntary side ceased trading in March 2007 and Marches Access Point was formed to continue to provide computer access, resource centre and training opportunities. The commercial side of KC3 became KC3.net and in 2009 there was a further management buyout by V8 media which signalled the end of KC3.net in Kington.\nThe project was featured in an episode of The Net in June 1994.\nEducation\nThe town has a primary school and a combined secondary school and sixth form — the Lady Hawkins' School. Sir Francis Drake's cousin Sir John Hawkins married, and in her will, Lady Hawkins left £800 to the town to establish the school. The school is unique in having special permission from the Royal Navy to fly the White Ensign on its foundress day.  Notable former students include singer Ellie Goulding and actor Jessica Raine.\nTransport\nThe A44 road heads around the town on a bypass; it previously went through the town centre.\nBus services run to Newtown, Powys, Llandrindod Wells, Knighton, Presteigne, Leominster and Hereford. The town has its own bus company, Sargeants Brothers, which was founded in the 1920s, and today provides bus services to Hereford and Mid Wales. The bus depot is on Mill Street.\nThe Kington Tramway opened in 1820 and ran until taken over by the railways.\nThe Leominster and Kington Railway received royal assent in July 1854, and the 13 miles and 25 chain length opened to Kington in August 1857. Leased to the Great Western Railway from 1862, it was later amalgamated with it. When the Kington and Eardisley Railway replaced the tramway in 1875, it built a new through station at Kington, which it jointly owned with the Leominster and Kington Railway. The old station, slightly to the south, became the goods depot.\nTraffic rose during World War II, with the US Army hospital camp at Hergest. Decline set in after the war, and it closed to passengers on 5 February 1955. Freight traffic ceased in 1964, after which the track was taken up and the line abandoned.\nToday the nearest station is Knighton on the Heart of Wales Line, though Leominster is quicker to drive to and has more frequent services, being on the Welsh Marches Line. Bus services mostly connect with Hereford railway station, as well with Llandrindod railway station.\nShobdon Aerodrome is located close to the town.\nMedia\nLocal news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Sutton Coldfield TV transmitter and the local relay transmitter.\nLocal radio station are BBC Hereford and Worcester, Sunshine Radio, Capital Mid-Counties, Greatest Hits Radio Herefordshire & Worcestershire, and Hits Radio Herefordshire & Worcestershire.\nThe town is served by the local newspaper, Hereford Times.\nSport\nKington Golf Club, at  above sea level on Bradnor Hill, is the highest 18-hole golf club in England. The course opened in 1926 and was designed by Cecil Hutchison, who was also involved in the design of Pulborough. The course is of 6,000 yards and has no bunkers.\nKington Town F.C. play in the West Midlands (Regional) League.\nKington has also been the host town for the Marin Rough (cycle) Ride since 2003.\nTourism\nKington Museum is open April to September inclusive, and is on Mill Street in the town centre. Near the town is Hergest Croft Gardens, part of the Hergest Estate, which is open to the public March to October. In June, for several weeks, is the annual Kington Festival in the town.\nYe Olde Tavern is a late 18th/early 19th century Grade II listed public house at 22 Victoria Rd. It is on the Campaign for Real Ale's National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors.\nThe Burton Hotel is a hotel and health centre, on Mill Street. The town also has a Youth Hostel on Victoria Road, which is open from late March to late October.\nTwinning\nKington has been twinned with the commune of Marines in northern France since 1979. The two places are of a similar population. In Marines there is a residential side-street called \"Place Kington\", whilst in Kington there is a covered space by the market hall called \"Place-de-Marines\".\nNotable people\n*Singer Ellie Goulding, Olympic Equestrian Leslie Law and actress Jessica Raine attended Lady Hawkins' School in the town.\n*Stephen Kemble, of the acting family, the Kemble family, born here in 1758\n*Chris Menges Cinematographer and film director.
