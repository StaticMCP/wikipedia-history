Minority shareholders of Monumental include Laurene Powell Jobs, the Qatar Investment Authority, Jeffrey Skoll, Sheila Johnson, and Mark Lerner.\nIn December 2023, Leonsis announced a non-binding partnership with Virginia governor Glenn Youngkin to move the Capitals and Wizards to a planned arena in Potomac Yard in Alexandria, Virginia, by 2028. The structure would be part of an arts and entertainment district at the site, which would include a practice facility, restaurants, an esports venue, concert hall, and a new headquarters for Monumental. In March 2024, after officials in Alexandria announced that the $2 billion entertainment and sports complex plans were scrapped, Washington D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser announced a new deal to keep the Capitals and Wizards in the District until 2050. Monumental was valued by CNBC at $7.84 billion in July 2025.\nBrands and properties\nhosting a Washington Capitals game, both owned and operated by Monumental]]\n* Washington Capitals, National Hockey League (NHL) team\n** MedStar Capitals Iceplex, practice facility\n** [https://www.nhl.com/capitals/esports/ Caps Gaming], esports organization\n* Washington Wizards, National Basketball Association (NBA) team\n** Capital City Go-Go, NBA G League team\n** [https://wizardsdg.nba.com/ Wizards District Gaming], NBA 2K League team\n* Washington Mystics, Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) team\n* Washington Valor, defunct Arena Football League (AFL) team\n* Baltimore Brigade, defunct AFL team\n* Capital One Arena, home arena of the Capitals and Wizards\n** [https://www.districtedc.com/ District E], esports venue\n** Guy Fieri's DC Kitchen + Bar, restaurant\n* EagleBank Arena, arena at George Mason University\n* Monumental Sports Network, regional sports network\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n}}"
