The office of King's Representative is established by the Constitution of the Cook Islands. They are appointed by the King for a term of three years, and may be reappointed.  When the Cook Islands has a queen regnant, the viceroy is titled '''queen's representative'''.\nThe king's representative fills the role normally filled by a governor-general in the Westminster system of a Commonwealth realm, being both a representative of the monarch and the titular head of executive government. They appoint the prime minister and Cabinet and chair the Cook Islands Executive Council. In performing their duties, they must act on advice.\nOriginally these duties were performed by the high commissioner of New Zealand to the Cook Islands, but in 1982 these powers were repatriated. The governor-general of New Zealand still represents the king in matters pertaining to the entire realm.\nFollowing the death of Elizabeth II, the office formally became known as \"King's Representative\".\nIn August 2025, Tom Marsters was reappointed as the representative for a fifth three-year term.\nList of sovereign's representatives in the Cook Islands\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |№\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Portrait\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Name\n! colspan=\"3\" |Term of office\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Monarch\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Prime Minister\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Took office\n! scope=\"col\" | Left office\n!Length of office\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |1\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Sir Gaven Donne(1914–2010)\n| rowspan=\"3\" |1982\n| rowspan=\"3\" |18 September 1984\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2 years, 258 days\n| rowspan=\"17\" |Elizabeth II\n|Sir Tom Davis\n|-\n|Geoffrey Henry\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Sir Tom Davis\n|-\n!2\n|\n|Sir Graham Speight(1921–2008)Acting\n|18 September 1984\n|19 December 1984\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |3\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Sir Tangaroa Tangaroa(1921–2009)\n| rowspan=\"3\" |19 December 1984\n| rowspan=\"3\" |19 December 1990\n| rowspan=\"3\" |6 years, 1 day\n|-\n|Pupuke Robati\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Sir Geoffrey Henry\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |4\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Sir Apenera Pera Short(1916–2011)\n| rowspan=\"3\" |19 December 1990\n| rowspan=\"3\" |14 November 2000\n| rowspan=\"3\" |9 years, 327 days\n|-\n|Joe Williams\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | Sir Terepai Maoate\n|-\n!5\n|\n|Laurence Greig(born 1929)Acting\n|14 November 2000\n|9 February 2001\n|88 days\n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\" |6\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Sir Frederick Tutu Goodwin(born 1940)\n| rowspan=\"4\" |9 February 2001\n| rowspan=\"4\" |27 July 2013\n| rowspan=\"4\" |12 years, 169 days\n|-\n|Robert Woonton\n|-\n|Jim Marurai\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Henry Puna\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |7\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Sir Tom Marsters(born 1945)\n| rowspan=\"3\" |27 July 2013\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Incumbent\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Mark Brown\n|-\n|Charles III\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* Monarchy in the Cook Islands\nReferences"
