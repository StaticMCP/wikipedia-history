Two years ago they sent their company of the National Guard but didn't think they would actually go to battle. They first get sanguine letters about their training and being stationed in the Philippines without a thought to the possibility of combat. Then the Japanese invade the Philippines. Over winter 1942, one by one, many of the parents get telegrams from the government saying their children have died. People start joining the war effort with bravado, but then slack off, taking days off work and wasting resources, until May 6, 1942, when Corregidor falls and the rest of the company is taken prisoner by the Japanese.\nThe town then rallies, and more and more people go to work for war industries, go without luxuries to supply more materiel, and buy bonds. The next time that their company goes of to the front, they will have more planes, more tires, and better equipment, and they won't have to surrender.\nSee also\n* List of Allied propaganda films of World War II\n*United States home front during World War II\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* [https://catalog.archives.gov/id/38663 ''It's Everybody's War''] at the National Archives and Records Administration"
