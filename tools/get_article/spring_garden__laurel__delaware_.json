It is an L-shaped, brick-and-frame dwelling built in three sections over a 100-year period. The large brick main core was built about 1782, and is a -story, double-pile, center-hall plan structure with a three-bay facade in the Federal style.  The interior has Georgian style details.  It has a summer kitchen addition built about 1860, and it is a -story, single-pile structure added to the rear of the main core. About 1880, a large, two-story, frame addition was built onto the west gable end of the original brick section. It is in the Victorian Gothic style.\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.\nReferences"
