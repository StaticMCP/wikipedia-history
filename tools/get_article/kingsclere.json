St. Mary's church has C12 origins. It is cruciform and has Norman style with various Romanesque features. The Victorians re-faced the flint exterior, and made other alterations. The present church replaced an earlier Saxon minster on the same site.\nGeography\nKingsclere is approximately equidistant  from the towns of Basingstoke and Newbury on the A339 road.\nHistory\nshield.]]\nKingsclere can trace back its history to a place identified as belonging to King Alfred in his will between 872 and 888, the 'clere' possibly meaning 'bright' or 'clearing'.\nKingsclere formed part of the ancient demesne of the Crown.\nIn his will King Alfred left Kingsclere for life to his second daughter, Ethelgiva, Abbess of Shaftesbury,\nand there are other mentions of it in Saxon charters. In 931 King Athelstan at a Witenagemot at Colchester granted 10 hides of land at Clere to Abbot Aelfric, and in 943 King Edmund bestowed 15 hides of land at Clere on the 'religious woman Aelfswith'.\nWhile sixteen years later King Edgar gave his thegn Aelfwine 10 hides of land at West Clere.\nLocal legend asserts that King John was troubled by a bedbug during a night in a Kingsclere inn, when prevented by fog from reaching his lodge at Freemantle Park on Cottington's hill.  He ordained that the church should erect and evermore maintain upon its tower a representation of the creature that had disturbed his sleep. It is recorded that King John stayed at Freemantle Park on 8 and 9 September 1204\nThe 'Kingsclere Massacre'\nOn 5 October 1944, 10 American soldiers belonging to a US Army engineering support group based at Sydmonton Court nearby, broke bounds to visit The Swan public house, but were ordered back by two MPs. On their return to base, the soldiers broke into the armoury, then returned to the village and laid siege to The Crown public house, where the two MPs were drinking. Both MPs were killed, as was the pub landlady.\nFairs\nIn 1218, the king ordered that the market which had been held in Kingsclere on Sundays should in the future be held on Saturdays. Warner, writing in the 18th century, mentions a well-frequented market on Tuesdays, and fairs the first Tuesday in April and the first Tuesday after 10 October. In 1848 the market was still held on Tuesdays, but had fallen very much into disuse, only a few farmers meeting at the Swan Inn with samples, and it probably ceased altogether about 1850. The fairs continued () to be held—on Whit Tuesday for pleasure on Ashford Hill and the Tuesday after Old Michaelmas Day for hiring servants and pleasure in the market place.\nInns\nThe former Falcon Inn, in Swan street, one of the oldest in Hampshire, is especially interesting as being at one time in the possession of William Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury, who in 1510 gave it to Winchester College upon trust for the maintenance and support of the scholars upon its foundation.\nThe original 'Crowne' Inn is mentioned in the parish register in 1611 and the 'Golden Faucon' in 1628. The modern Crown Inn was built in 1853 and the Swan Inn dates back to well before 1848.  Its sign proclaims it a 15th C. Rooming Inn.\nIn popular culture\nThe nearby Watership Down is the setting for the 1972 novel of the same name by Richard Adams.\nWatership Down was also the site of the 1982 World Field Archery Championship put on by the Overton Black Arrows archery club from the nearby village of Overton.\nThe actress Lavinia Fenton, most famous for her role as the first Polly Peachum in John Gay's The Beggar's Opera, was lover and then wife of Charles Powlett, 3rd Duke of Bolton of the parish. Their eldest son, Rev. Charles Powlett, was briefly vicar of Kingsclere.\nPeople from and associated with Kingsclere\n.]]\n*Edith of Wessex ( – 18 December 1075)  Queen Edith, widow of Edward the Confessor.\n*Rosamund Clifford, the fair Rosamund, (before 1150 – ), a royal mistress, stayed at the royal residence at Tidgrove, on the southern side of the parish.\n*John de Lancelevy, lord of the manor of Hannington.\n*Peter Fitz Herbert, lord of the manors of North Oakley and Wolverton, held the church after Hyde Abbey.\n*Ranulf de Broc (sometimes Rannulf de Broc; died around 1179), and his son-in-law Stephen of Thornham (died ), possessors of the manor of Frobury (Frollebury).\n*Walter de Coutances, Walter of Rouen (died 1207), Anglo-Norman bishop of Lincoln and archbishop of Rouen.\n*King John (died 1216).\n*Richard of Cornwall, encaustic tiles bearing his symbols used to be in the chancel aisle.\n*William Melton (died 1340), 43rd Archbishop of York (1317–1340), held the manor of Kingsclere.
