The series was initially created as a trilogy set in medias res (partway through the plot) that was later expanded into a trilogy of trilogies, known as the \"Skywalker Saga\".\nThe original 1977 film Star Wars (later subtitled A New Hope) was followed by the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983); these films form the original trilogy. Beginning twenty-two years later, the prequel trilogy was released, consisting of Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999), Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002), and Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005). Then, after creator George Lucas sold Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012, a sequel trilogy consisting of Episodes VII through IX was released, namely Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015), Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017), and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019).\nThe first three spin-off films produced were the made-for-television Star Wars Holiday Special (1978), The Ewok Adventure (1984) and Ewoks: The Battle for Endor (1985). Following Disney's 2012 acquisition of the franchise, these earlier films were dropped from the official canon, but the theatrical animated film Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008) and its television series continuation retain their canonical status. Two standalone films were produced and released between the sequel trilogy films: Rogue One (2016) and Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018), both set between the original and prequel trilogies. A years long hiatus began in late 2019, during which numerous films were announced and often shelved. The Mandalorian and Grogu, a continuation of the similarly titled television series, is being directed by Jon Favreau and is planned for release in May 2026.\nThe combined box office revenue of the films amounts to over US$10 billion, and it is currently the third-highest-grossing film franchise. The major live-action releases (including all of the films of the Skywalker Saga) were nominated for Academy Awards. The original film was nominated for most of the major categories, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor for Alec Guinness (who played Obi-Wan Kenobi), while all theatrical live-action films have been nominated for particular categories. Several official Star Wars television series have also been released, all now on Disney+.\nSkywalker Saga\nThe main Star Wars film series is a trilogy of subtrilogies; as it neared completion, Lucasfilm began to refer to it as the \"Skywalker Saga\". It was released beginning with the original trilogy (Episodes IV, V, and VI, 1977–1983), followed by the prequel trilogy (Episodes I, II, and III, 1999–2005) and the sequel trilogy (Episodes VII, VIII, and IX, 2015–2019). The first film released, Star Wars (1977), is the fourth film chronologically and was later subtitled Episode IV – A New Hope in 1981. The saga begins chronologically with Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999) and concludes with Episode IX – The Rise of Skywalker (2019).\nThe story follows each generation of the Force-sensitive Skywalker family and their struggle against Palpatine, an evil Sith Lord known as Darth Sidious. The prequel trilogy focuses on Anakin Skywalker's time as a Jedi under Obi-Wan Kenobi, marriage to Padmé Amidala, and fall to the dark side as Darth Vader. The original trilogy follows Anakin and Padmé's children Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia, who join forces with Han Solo and the Rebel Alliance against Vader and Palpatine's Empire. The sequel trilogy features Kylo Ren (Ben Solo)—Leia and Han's son—who fell to the dark side and seeks to rule First Order with Rey, Palpatine's granddaughter and the Skywalkers' last Jedi apprentice.\nEach episodic film begins with an opening crawl, accompanied by the main Star Wars theme by John Williams, who composed each film's score. Following their initial theatrical releases, franchise creator George Lucas made multiple rounds of retroactive changes to the films of the original trilogy (and to a lesser extent, the prequels).\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable sticky-header-multi\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Film\n! scope=\"col\" | U.S. release date\n! scope=\"col\" | Director\n! scope=\"col\" | Screenwriter(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Story by\n! scope=\"col\" | Producer(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | }}\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" style=\"background-color:#ccccff;\" | Prequel trilogy\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Episode I – The Phantom Menace\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|\n| rowspan=\"3\" | George Lucas\n| George Lucas\n| rowspan=\"3\" | George Lucas\n| rowspan=\"3\" | Rick McCallum\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Episode II – Attack of the Clones\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|\n| George Lucas and Jonathan Hales\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Episode III – Revenge of the Sith\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|\n| George Lucas\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" style=\"background-color:#ccccff;\" | Original trilogy\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Episode IV – A New Hope\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|\n| colspan=\"2\" | George Lucas\n| rowspan=\"3\"| George Lucas\n| rowspan=\"2 | Gary Kurtz\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|\n| Irvin Kershner\n| Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Episode VI – Return of the Jedi\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|\n| Richard Marquand\n| Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas\n| Howard Kazanjian\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" style=\"background-color:#ccccff;\" | Sequel trilogy\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Episode VII – The Force Awakens\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|\n| J.

The first films set outside the main episodic series were the Ewok spin-off films Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure (1984) and Ewoks: The Battle for Endor (1985), the first of which was screened internationally after being produced for television.\nAfter the conclusion of his then-six-episode saga in 2005, Lucas returned to spin-offs in the form of television series.\nAn animated film, The Clone Wars (2008), was released as a pilot to a TV series of the same name. An anthology series set between the main episodes entered development in parallel to the production of the sequel trilogy, described by Disney chief financial officer (CFO) Jay Rasulo as origin stories. The first entry, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016), tells the story of the rebels who steal the Death Star plans directly before Episode IV. Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018) focuses on Han's backstory, also featuring Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian.\nAnimated film\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" border=\"1\" width=99%\n|+\n!

The film and series exist in the same level of canon as the episodic and anthology films.\nLive-action films\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Film\n! scope=\"col\" | U.S. release date\n! scope=\"col\" | Director\n! scope=\"col\" | Screenwriter(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Story by\n! scope=\"col\" | Producer(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | }}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|\n| Gareth Edwards\n| Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy\n| John Knoll and Gary Whitta\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Kathleen Kennedy, Allison Shearmur, and Simon Emanuel\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Solo: A Star Wars Story\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|\n| Ron Howard\n| colspan=\"2\"| Jonathan Kasdan and Lawrence Kasdan\n|\n|}\nBefore selling Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012, and parallel to his development of a sequel trilogy, George Lucas and original trilogy  Lawrence Kasdan started development on a standalone film about a young Han Solo. In February 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger made public the development of a Kasdan film and Entertainment Weekly reported that it would focus on Han Solo. Disney CFO Jay Rasulo has described the standalone films as origin stories. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy confirmed that there was \"no attempt being made to carry characters (from the standalone films) in and out of the saga episodes.\" The standalone films are subtitled \"A Star Wars Story\".\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)\nRogue One is set directly before Episode IV: A New Hope and focuses on the eponymous group of rebels who obtain the plans to the Death Star. Its laser was developed by scientist Galen Erso (played by Mads Mikkelsen) after the Empire forcibly abducted him, separating him from his daughter Jyn. Galen secretly sends a defecting Imperial pilot, Bodhi Rook, to deliver a message warning of the weapon's existence and revealing its weakness to his rebel friend Saw Gerrera. Under the false promise of her father's liberation, Jyn agrees to help Rebel Alliance intelligence officer Cassian Andor and his droid  retrieve the message from Saw, now the paranoid leader of an extremist cell of rebels.\nThe idea for the movie came from John Knoll, the chief creative officer of Industrial Light & Magic. In May 2014, Lucasfilm announced Gareth Edwards as the director of an anthology film, with Gary Whitta writing the first draft for a release on December 16, 2016. The film's title was revealed to be Rogue One, with Chris Weitz rewriting the script, and Felicity Jones in the starring role. Ben Mendelsohn and Diego Luna also play new characters, with James Earl Jones returning to voice Darth Vader. Edwards stated, \"It comes down to a group of individuals who don't have magical powers that have to somehow bring hope to the galaxy.\" The film was the first to feature characters introduced in animated Star Wars TV series, namely The Clone Wars Saw Gerrera, portrayed by Forest Whitaker in the film. The movie received generally positive reviews, with its performances, action sequences, soundtrack, visual effects and darker tone being praised. The film grossed over million worldwide within a week of its release.\nSolo: A Star Wars Story (2018)\nEpisodes V–VII and Solo, and Alden Ehrenreich, who plays young Han Solo\n| align             =\n| direction         =\n| alt1              =\n| caption1          =\n| caption2          =\n}}\nSolo, the second anthology film, focuses on Han Solo about 10 years before A New Hope. After an escape attempt from his Imperial-occupied home planet of Corellia goes wrong, a young Han vows to return to rescue his girlfriend Qi'ra. Han \"Solo\" joins the Imperial Academy; however, he is expelled for his reckless behavior. Han and his newfound Wookiee friend Chewbacca resort to a criminal life, mentored by veteran smuggler Tobias Beckett. After angering gangster Dryden Vos, for whom Qi'ra now works, Han and his company's lives depend on pulling a heist for him. Without a ship to travel, they hire Lando Calrissian, the captain and owner of the Millennium Falcon. A twist ending acknowledges Maul's survival of The Phantom Menace, as previously explored by animated series.\nBefore selling Lucasfilm to Disney, George Lucas had hired Star Wars original trilogy veteran Lawrence Kasdan to write a film about a young Han Solo. The film stars Alden Ehrenreich as a young Han Solo, Joonas Suotamo as Chewbacca (after serving as a double for the character in The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi), Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian, Emilia Clarke as Qi'ra, and Woody Harrelson as Beckett. Lucasfilm originally hired Phil Lord and Christopher Miller to direct, although they later left their position and were fired during principal photography, and replaced by Ron Howard.\nFuture\nIn mid-2018, Lucasfilm confirmed that multiple anthology films were in development, with their release following a hiatus after 2019's The Rise of Skywalker. Various release dates were delayed or scrapped, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2023&nbsp;Writers Guild of America strike. In May 2023, Kennedy said future Star Wars films would come out \"when they're ready\", citing the 3-to-4-year interim of more recent James Bond films. A December 2027 date has been reported with no known cancellation.\nIn May 2020, Taika Waititi was officially announced to write and direct a live-action Star Wars film. Three further live-action films were officially announced at April 2023's Star Wars Celebration, to be helmed by Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, Dave Filoni, and James Mangold. Kennedy said upcoming films would include the trademark opening crawl. In January 2024, a Mandalorian film from Jon Favreau was announced.\nAdditionally, Kennedy stated in May 2022 that \"There's a couple of [filmmakers] that we've been in conversation with ... that I'm hoping will\" oversee future films in the way that Favreau and Filoni have done for Star Wars television series.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Film(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | U.S. release date\n! scope=\"col\" | Director\n! scope=\"col\" | Screenwriter(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Producer(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Status\n! scope=\"col\" | }}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | The Mandalorian and Grogu\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|\n| Jon Favreau\n| Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni\n| Kathleen Kennedy, Dave Filoni, Jon Favreau & Ian Bryce\n| Post-production\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Star Wars: Starfighter\n| style=\"text-align:left\"|\n| Shawn Levy\n| Jonathan Tropper\n| Kathleen Kennedy & Shawn Levy\n| rowspan=\"1\" |Filming\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Untitled Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy film\n| rowspan=\"5\"\n| Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy\n| George Nolfi\n| Kathleen Kennedy\n| rowspan=\"5\" | In development\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Untitled Dave Filoni film\n| colspan=\"2\" | Dave Filoni\n| Kathleen Kennedy & Jon Favreau\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Untitled James Mangold film\n| James Mangold\n| James Mangold & Beau Willimon\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Kathleen Kennedy\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Untitled Taika Waititi film\n| Taika Waititi\n| Taika Waititi & Tony McNamara\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Untitled Simon Kinberg trilogy\n|\n| Simon Kinberg\n| Kathleen Kennedy & Simon Kinberg\n|\n|}\nThe Mandalorian and Grogu (2026)\nIn 2019, then–Walt Disney Studios CCO Alan Horn stated that if The Mandalorian was successful, a feature film spin-off would be considered. A fourth season of the TV series was written from May 2022 to February 2023. Pre-production occurred in April 2023. Filming for the season was scheduled to begin in September, but was delayed due to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes. In January 2024, it was announced that series creator Jon Favreau would write and direct a theatrical film based on the series (separate from Filoni's upcoming film), titled The Mandalorian and Grogu. Filming was expected to begin later in 2024 as the first Star Wars film to enter production since The Rise of Skywalker. In February 2024, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced that the film is aiming for a 2026 release, although specifics were not given at the time. In April 2024, it was announced that the film would be released on May 22, 2026.\nStar Wars: Starfighter (2027)\nIn November 2022, Deadline Hollywood reported that Shawn Levy was in talks to direct a Star Wars film, following his work on Deadpool & Wolverine (2024) and the fifth and final season of Stranger Things. In September 2023, Levy revealed that development had begun but had stalled due to the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike. In July 2024, it was reported that Jonathan Tropper (who wrote Levy's The Adam Project) would write the film's screenplay. In January 2025, Ryan Gosling entered talks to star in the film. It was also reported that Gosling's interest in the project accelerated it to become the next Star Wars film to enter production after The Mandalorian and Grogu. In February 2025, Kathleen Kennedy acknowledged the film's existence and development status, confirming it would be released after The Mandalorian and Grogu. Kennedy also revealed that the film will take place \"five to six years\" after The Rise of Skywalker. In August 2025, it was reported that Matt Smith was cast as the film's villain. Principal photography began in the United Kingdom on August 28, 2025, and Flynn Gray, Aaron Pierre, Simon Bird, Jamael Westman, Daniel Ings, and Amy Adams were announced as cast members.\nUntitled Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy film (TBA)\nIn October 2022, The Hollywood Reporter reported that after a two-week writers' room in July (which included Patrick Somerville, Rayna McClendon, Andy Greenwald, and maybe Dave Filoni), Damon Lindelof and Justin Britt-Gibson were  a Star Wars film, with Ms.&nbsp;Marvel director Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy attached as director. THR reported that according to its sources, \"the project is intended as a stand-alone but in success could lead to more movies\", taking place after the sequel trilogy and possibly featuring some of its characters. In March 2023, it was reported that Lindelof and Britt-Gibson had left the project in mid-February and that Steven Knight was hired to replace them as screenwriter. Filming was reportedly set to begin in February 2024. At April 2023's Star Wars Celebration, Kennedy officially announced a Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy-directed movie, with Daisy Ridley returning as Rey as she constructs a new Jedi Order 15 years after the events of The Rise of Skywalker. She reportedly may be a supporting character in the vein of Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker in the original and sequel trilogies, respectively. Steven Knight departed the project by October 2024 with filming not expected to start until late 2025. In January 2025, George Nolfi had been hired to write the screenplay.\nUntitled Dave Filoni film (TBA)\nIn December 2020, it was revealed that The Mandalorian and its related series were planned to culminate in a \"climactic story event\". At Star Wars Celebration in 2023, it was announced that Dave Filoni would make his live-action feature directorial debut with a film set in the New Republic era, connecting storylines that began with The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, Ahsoka, and Skeleton Crew.\nUntitled James Mangold film (TBA)\nIn April 2023, during Star Wars Celebration Europe IV, Lucasfilm announced that James Mangold would write and direct a Star Wars film whose story \"will go back to the dawn of the Jedi\" and explore the origins of The Force, set around 25,000 years before the events of A New Hope. It is set to be the start of a new era set within Star Wars timeline, dubbed Dawn of the Jedi. The film has been described as a \"Cecil B. DeMille-style biblical epic.\", with Mangold citing The Ten Commandments as a major inspiration for the film. Mangold was offered the project during production of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. Mangold confirmed shortly afterwards that he had begun developing the film alongside his screenplay for the DC Universe Swamp Thing film, and was uncertain which project would move forward first following his Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown. In April 2024, it was reported that Beau Willimon (who had written episodes of Andor) would co-write the film alongside Mangold. During an interview in May 2024, producer Simon Emanuel seemingly revealed the film's title, Jedi Prime.\nIn September 2023, David S. Goyer revealed that he had written a treatment for an unproduced Star Wars film about the origins of the Jedi Order.\nUntitled Taika Waititi film (TBA)\nOn May 4, 2020, Taika Waititi (who directed the first-season finale of The Mandalorian and voiced IG-11) was officially announced to direct a Star Wars film from a screenplay he was  with Krysty Wilson-Cairns. As of May 2022, his film was expected to be released before Rogue Squadron (originally scheduled for December 2023 prior to its delay), with Kennedy asserting that Waititi's film may be released in late 2023. In June 2022, Waititi agreed with Kennedy's view that the films should move into new territory instead of origin stories, and stated he would continue writing the project while filming other projects. The movie was reportedly expected to be shot in Los Angeles. By March 2023, Waititi was also likely to appear in the film. The next month, Kennedy stated that Waititi was now writing the film alone. In early May, Deadline Hollywood reported that Waititi may begin filming the project in 2024. In September 2023, amidst rumors of the film's cancellation, it was revealed that it was still in development and that Waititi would resume writing the script after the conclusion of the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike. In February 2025, Kathleen Kennedy revealed that Waititi was still working on the script with a new co-writer. In April 2025, Kennedy revealed that Tony McNamara was Watiti's new co-writer.\nLando (TBA)\nIn 2018, while promoting Solo, Kathleen Kennedy expressed interest in making a spin-off film focusing on Lando Calrissian. Though it was specified that a project of that sort was not a priority at Lucasfilm. Around the same time, Donald Glover expressed similar interest in a Lando-centric film, suggesting it could take inspiration from the Steven Spielberg film Catch Me If You Can. At Disney Investor Day 2020, a Lando series was announced to be in development for Disney+, with Justin Simien acting as showrunner. In 2023, it was revealed that Simien would be replaced as showrunner by Donald Glover and his brother Stephen. Nearly two months later, Stephen Glover stated in an interview that the project was being redeveloped as a feature film. Donald Glover confirmed his involvement as a writer on the film in September 2024.\nRogue Squadron (TBA)\nOn December 10, 2020, during Disney Investor Day, Wonder Woman (2017) director Patty Jenkins was announced as the director of a film titled Rogue Squadron, initially set to be released on December 22, 2023. According to the official Star Wars website, the film would \"introduce a new generation of starfighter pilots as they earn their wings and risk their lives in a boundary-pushing, high-speed thrill-ride, and move the saga into the future era of the galaxy.\" According to Jenkins, the film would be an original story \"with great influence from the games and the books\". A script was being worked on as of December 2020, at which time, Wonder Woman&nbsp;3 story was still being worked on. Matthew Robinson was hired to write Rogue Squadron in May 2021; late the next month, Jenkins revealed that the script was almost finished. On November&nbsp;8, the film's production was delayed from 2022 due to Jenkins' busy schedule. A month later, Jenkins had left her planned Cleopatra film as director in order to focus on Rogue Squadron and Wonder Woman&nbsp;3. Disney announced in April 2022 that the film was still set to be released in December 2023. Kathleen Kennedy stated in May that the film has been \"pushed off to the side for the moment\", with the script still being worked on and Waititi's film expected to be released first. On September 15, 2022, the film was confirmed to be taken off from Disney's release schedule, although in December Jenkins said she was actively working on it amid the apparent cancellation of Wonder Woman&nbsp;3. In April 2023, Kennedy said the project could still happen either as a film or a television series. On March 13, 2024, Jenkins stated that she had signed a new contract with Lucasfilm to write and direct Rogue Squadron.\nOther future films\nIn January 2024, it was reported that the fourth season of The Mandalorian would be reworked into theatrical sequel films if The Mandalorian and Grogu (2026) was a box-office success.\nIn November 2024, Simon Kinberg was reported to be writing and producing a new Star Wars trilogy with Kathleen Kennedy also to help produce the films. In March 2025, Kathleen Kennedy confirmed the trilogy was in development and revealed Lucasfilm was expecting completed drafts by June 2025. Kennedy also referred to Kinberg's trilogy as \"the next saga\".\nProduced for television\nThe first spin-off film (also the first sequel to be released) was a holiday TV special aired in 1978. Two live-action TV films created in the mid-1980s feature the Ewoks.\nStar Wars Holiday Special (1978)\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" border=\"1\"\n! Film !!

Stars of the original film and archive footage from the original Star Wars film appeared alongside celebrity guest stars in plot-related skits, musical numbers, and an animated segment, all loosely tied together by the premise of Chewbacca's family waiting for his arrival for the \"Life Day\" celebration on his home planet, Kashyyyk. The special is notorious for its extremely negative reception and was aired only once. Only the 11-minute animated sequence, which features the debut of bounty hunter Boba Fett, was positively received.\nEwok films\nThe Ewoks from Return of the Jedi were featured in two spin-off television films, The Ewok Adventure and Ewoks: The Battle for Endor. Both aired on ABC on the Thanksgiving weekends of 1984 and 1985, respectively, with at least the first also being given a limited international theatrical release. Warwick Davis reprised his debut role as the main Ewok, Wicket, in both. They are set between the events of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Both films were released on VHS, LaserDisc, and on a double-feature DVD. Although based on stories written by George Lucas, they do not bear Star Wars in their titles, and were considered to exist in a lower level of canon than the episodic films. Following Disney's acquisition of the franchise, they were excluded from the canon. The Battle for Endor would be the last live-action Star Wars television project produced by Lucasfilm until 2019's The Mandalorian.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" border=\"1\"\n!

While trying to repair their ship, the castaway family is split, when a giant creature known as the Gorax kidnaps the parents. Taking pity on the kids, a group of native Ewoks led by Wicket decides to help little Cindel Towani and her older brother Mace, rescue their parents.

The project was redeveloped as Rebel Moon (2023).\nSpin-off films centered on Boba Fett and Yoda\nIn early 2013, Bob Iger announced the development of spin-off films focusing on Han Solo, Boba Fett, and Yoda. Simon Kinberg was announced to be the screenwriter of the Boba Fett film shortly afterward. In mid-2014, Josh Trank was officially announced as the director of an undisclosed spin-off film, but had left the project a year later due to creative differences, causing a teaser for the film to be scrapped from Star Wars Celebration. Though it was later revealed that Trank was removed from the project following behind the scenes issues on Fantastic Four. In May 2020, Trank confirmed that his planned Star Wars film was the Boba Fett film. In May 2018, it was reported that James Mangold would direct the Boba Fett movie, with Kinberg still attached as screenwriter. Five months later, the film was announced to be cancelled, with Lucasfilm instead focusing their attention on The Mandalorian, which utilized a similar character to Fett. Mangold confirmed his brief involvement in 2023, revealing he wrote a \"borderline R-rated\" script. He cited the poor commercial performance of Solo as the main reason for the film's cancellation.\nObi-Wan: A Star Wars Story\nIn 2017, it was announced that an anthology film focused on Obi-Wan Kenobi was in development with Stephen Daldry set as director and writer. In May 2018, the film was reportedly titled Obi-Wan: A Star Wars Story, with a plot involving Kenobi protecting a young Luke Skywalker on the planet Tatooine during tensions between local farmers and Tusken Raiders. Production on the film was expected to take place in Northern Ireland under the working title Joshua Tree in 2019. The film was cancelled in 2018, later being re-developed as a TV series for Disney+, which aired in 2022.\nPotential sequels to Rogue One and Solo\nRogue One and Solo actors Felicity Jones, Alden Ehrenreich and Emilia Clarke all stated that their contracts also included future installments. Solo director Ron Howard said that while no sequel was in development, it was up to the fans to decide. Although critics noted that Solo left room open for sequels, in 2022, Howard confirmed that the studio had no plans to make one.\nUntitled Jabba the Hutt film\nIn August 2017, it was rumored that a film focused on Jabba the Hutt was in the works. In June 2018, a rumor circulated that a movie taking place in Mos Eisley was in the works as well. In September 2023, David S. Goyer confirmed that he had written a script treatment for an unproduced Jabba-centric film that was intended to be directed by Guillermo del Toro. It was also revealed that this was the same project as the rumored Mos Eisley film, with Alden Ehrenreich expected to reprise his role as Han Solo. The film was cancelled due to Solos poor commercial performance.\nUntitled D. B. Weiss and David Benioff series\nIn 2018, Lucasfilm announced that Game of Thrones showrunners D.&nbsp;B. Weiss and David Benioff would develop a series of Star Wars films, often believed to be a trilogy. In 2019, Kathleen Kennedy revealed the studio's intention of planning the next decade of films, with Weiss, Benioff, and Rian Johnson working together to map out the franchise's future. A month later, Bob Iger announced that the first Star Wars film released after a brief hiatus following the release of The Rise of Skywalker would be directed by Weiss & Benioff, set to be released in 2022. In October 2019, it was revealed that Weiss & Benioff had departed their trilogy after making an overall deal with Netflix. Though Kathleen Kennedy expressed interest in working with the duo in the future. Weiss & Benioff's films would have focused on the origins of the Jedi.\nUntitled Knights of the Old Republic film\nIn April 2019, Kathleen Kennedy was asked by MTV News about a potential Knights of the Old Republic adaption and stated, \"Yes, we are developing something to look at. Right now, I have no idea where things might fall.\" The following month, BuzzFeed News reported that Laeta Kalogridis had been hired in the spring of 2018 to write a film based on the 2003 video game, and that she was close to completing the first script of a potential trilogy.\nUntitled Kevin Feige film\nIn September 2019, Marvel Cinematic Universe producer Kevin Feige reportedly began developing a Star Wars film with Kennedy; Michael Waldron was later announced to write the screenplay.}}}} In May 2022, Waldron confirmed the project was moving forward and that it would more or less stand alone, however in a separate interview the same month Kennedy denied that the film was in active development. By March 2023, the film was confirmed to no longer be in development. Contrary to earlier comments, Kennedy clarified the following month that the project was more something conflated through the media, that \"nothing ever got developed. We never discussed an idea... If [Feige] did come up with something, I would be all ears. But, that's never really happened, so it's not an abandoned project. It just never really happened.\" In May 2023, Anthony and Joe Russo (who collaborated with Feige on multiple films set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe) revealed that they had conversations with Feige about potentially directing the film.\nUntitled J. D. Dillard and Matt Owens film\nJ. D. Dillard and Luke Cage writer Matt Owens were reportedly involved in the early stages of developing a Star Wars film in February 2020, which may have taken place on the Sith planet Exegol. In November 2022, Dillard announced that he was no longer involved in the project, which was purportedly to take inspiration from the Star Wars: TIE Fighter video game.\nUntitled Rian Johnson trilogy\nRian Johnson, the writer/director of The Last Jedi (2017), was confirmed to write and direct the first film of a new trilogy he was outlining as of early 2019 with Ram Bergman producing alongside Kennedy. It was said to differ from the Skywalker-focused films in favor of focusing on new characters and possibly a different era than the main film franchise. The project was considered to have been \"back-burnered\" by May 2022 due to Johnson's involvement with other projects, including the Knives Out franchise. Johnson indicated that he would make at least one more film in that series following Glass Onion before returning to Star Wars. In May 2025, Johnson stated that if he makes \"another Star Wars, [he will] be the happiest person. In July 2025, Johnson admitted that his Star Wars trilogy never got off the ground.\nThe Hunt for Ben Solo\nIn October 2025, Adam Driver revealed that he had been developing a film set after the events of The Rise of Skywalker entitled The Hunt for Ben Solo (operating under the code name Quiet Leaves). The film would have been directed by Steven Soderbergh, with Scott Z. Burns writing the script (based on a story outline by Soderbergh and Rebecca Blunt). While Lucasfilm loved the idea, when they presented the screenplay to Disney, Bob Iger and Alan Bergman said no because, according to Driver, \"They didn't see how Ben Solo was alive. And that was that.\" The Hunt for Ben Solo marked the first time that a project that was fully written out and approved by Lucasfilm was cancelled by Disney.\nUntitled David Fincher film\nOn October 23, 2025, it was reported by Jeff Sneider that David Fincher had pitched a Star Wars film set after the events of The Rise of Skywalker and centered on a pre-existing character, but that the film did not enter production due to Lucasfilm not granting Fincher final cut privilege. Two days later The Playlist said that the report was inaccurate and that the film would instead been set between The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker and that the pitch didn't progress past \"a few phone calls\". Fincher had previously been considered to direct The Force Awakens.\nDocumentaries\nDocumentary films about Star Wars released by Lucasfilm include:\n* The Making of Star Wars (1977)\n* SP FX: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\n* Classic Creatures: Return of the Jedi (1983)\n* From Star Wars to Jedi: The Making of a Saga (1983)\n* ''The Beginning: Making 'Episode I' (2001)\n* From Puppets to Pixels: Digital Characters in 'Episode II' (2002)\n* The Story of Star Wars (2004)\n* Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy (2004)\n* Star Wars: Heroes & Villains (2005)\n* Within a Minute: The Making of Episode III (2005)\n* Star Wars: The Legacy Revealed (2007)\n* Secrets of the Force Awakens: A Cinematic Journey (2016)\n* The Force of Sound (2018)\n* The Director and the Jedi (2018)\n* The Skywalker Legacy (2020)\n* Under the Helmet: The Legacy of Boba Fett (2021)\n* Obi-Wan Kenobi: A Jedi's Return (2022)\nSee also\n* List of Star Wars television series\n* List of Star Wars cast members\n* List of Star Wars characters\nParodies\n* Hardware Wars (1978)\n* Spaceballs (1987)\n* Thumb Wars (1999)\n* Robot Chicken: Star Wars (2007)\n* Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family Guy Trilogy (2010)\n* The Lego Movie (2014)\n* Phineas and Ferb: Star Wars'' (2014)\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
