Published by Image Comics, the series is a sequel to The Secret Service by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons, the second comic series in the Kingsman franchise by Millar, Gibbons, and Matthew Vaughn. Set in the Millarworld, the series chronicles the continued missions of Agent Galahad of Kingsman (originally named Gary London of MI6 in the previous series, renamed Gary \"Eggsy\" Unwin in this installment after his cinematic counterpart), as he faces off against the terrorist group the Red Diamond along with South African Secret Service (SASS) agent Kwaito.\nThe series, originally published between September 6, 2017 and February 7, 2018, was collected as a graphic novel on April 4, 2018, was followed by Big Game in 2023, and was republished as an omnibus by Dark Horse Comics in 2024.\nPremise\nWorking-class super-spy Eggsy follows in his deceased mentor's footsteps, but is still rough around the edges for a Kingsman agent. Following an interrupted date with Emma Watson and hot on the heels of a rescue mission to save Prince Philip that culminated in Eggsy sucker punching the 95-year-old, leading to his suspension, he embarks on a mission to stop an international terror plot led by Red Diamond in a story that starts where James Bond draws the line, in Eggsy teaming up with South African Secret Service (SASS) agent Kwaito.\nReception\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!
