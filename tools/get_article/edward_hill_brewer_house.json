It is located at 240 Trismen Terrace and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 22, 1982.\nHistory\nIn 1895, the Brewer family first visited Winter Park, searching for a warmer climate to escape New York's winters. In 1898, Edward Brewer, an industrialist, bought forty acres of land to construct a house. Construction began in 1899. He named the house \"The Palms\" and frequently entertained the community there. In 1923, Brewer renovated the house to more closely his resemble his Colonial Revival mansion in New York.
