On Rotten Tomatoes, \"Red Dirt\" garnered an 86% rating, with an average score of 7.56/10 based on 7 reviews.\nMatt Fowler of IGN gave \"Red Dirt\" a 7.8/10.0 rating, stating; \"Fear the Walking Dead may be suffering a little from the slight inertia of delivering a solely ranch-centric episode, but it's still burning through story at a decent pace. It's a good mix, and this chapter basically jumped us forward in a big way regarding Madison's rise to the role of de facto leader - with her pulling Troy's strings and each of her kids now also paired up with an Otto. She's going to trick people into fighting for this land for their own good. Because she knows that there's worse out there.\"\nRatings\n\"Red Dirt\" was seen by 2.19 million viewers in the United States on its original air date, below the previous episodes rating of 2.50 million.\nReferences"
