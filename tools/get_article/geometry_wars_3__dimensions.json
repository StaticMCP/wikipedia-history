The player (center) must avoid contact with enemies, while slowly firing on the boss and depleting its health.]] The player pilots a claw-shaped ship that can shoot independently of where it is pointing. The primary objective is to destroy a variety of enemy shapes which attempt to destroy the ship. Depending on the game mode, extra lives and extra supers can be collected upon achieving a certain number of points. Supers can be chosen before the game starts, and are expendable powerups that have extreme effects on the game, such as turrets that shoot enemies and a massive wave of bullets. In addition, several 'drones' may be selected to accompany the player to perform tasks, such as collecting geoms or firing on enemies.\nCrucial to effective play is the score multiplier, which can be increased by collecting small green diamonds called \"geoms\". Skilled players may get the multiplier into the ten-thousands on occasions.\nDevelopment\nThe game was developed by Sierra Entertainment and Lucid Games for the Xbox One, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4. It is the first game published by Sierra since May 6, 2009 when they released Zombie Wranglers.\nRelease\nThe game was released worldwide on November 25, 2014 for PC, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 and November 26 for the Xbox 360 and Xbox One.

He stated that \"Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions improves as much as possible while still staying true to the core of the franchise. That old game is still there, it's just unspeakably better now. It may have been past installments in the series that were billed as evolution, but Dimensions is where Geometry Wars truly evolved\".\nChristian Donlan from Eurogamer was more reserved in his praise, feeling the game wasn't up to par with its predecessors: \"I'm not sure if Lucid really gets the mentality behind this series, and that makes for a perfectly serviceable shooter when the lineage requires something more\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
