The series aired in syndication for one season from October 3, 1998 to May 22, 1999.\nThe series serves as a prequel to the games, following the original Kung Lao (Paolo Montalban) as he protects Earthrealm with the help of bodyguard Siro (Daniel Bernhardt) and former thief Taja (Kristanna Loken). The show also features game characters such as Kitana, Raiden and Sub-Zero. It was one of the first live action shows based on a video game to air on United States television, preceded only by the live action segments of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!.\nSummary\nMany centuries ago, Earth was an enchanting and desirable planet. Powerful and rich with natural resources, the vicious megalomaniac Shao Kahn wanted Earth as part of his growing collection of conquered realms known as Outworld. To protect Earth, Mortal Kombat was created: a tournament in which the fate of the planet is decided in battles between competitors from Earthrealm and Outworld. Five hundred years in the past, the monk warrior Kung Lao defeated Shao Kahn's sorcerer, Shang Tsung. When Kung Lao spared his life, Shao imprisoned Shang in the cobalt mines.\nKung Lao now had to train the next generation of warriors, who would give their lives to save Earth. Kung Lao created a partnership and friendship between two warriors: Siro, a former bodyguard, and Taja, an ex-thief. In the mysterious city of Zhuzin, Kung Lao and his new friends are guided and watched over by the thunder god Raiden. The three now battle various evils of both Outworld and Earthrealm, including an imprisoned Shang Tsung, who swore eternal revenge on Kung Lao for his humiliating defeat, and the sultry and seductive Vorpax, who is also imprisoned in the mines and has an agenda of her own.\nCast\nMain\n* Paolo Montalban as Kung Lao\n* Daniel Bernhardt as Siro\n* Kristanna Loken as Taja\n* Tracy Douglas as Vorpax\n* Bruce Locke as Shang Tsung\n* Jeffrey Meek as Raiden and Shao Kahn\nRecurring\nGame characters\nNotable guest appearances\nWith Conquest immediately following TNT's top-rated program, WCW Monday Nitro, WCW wrestlers Meng and Wrath filmed separate appearances. Former QVC model Dorian John played the barmaid Magda in the episodes \"Twisted Truth\" and \"Quan Chi\".\nProduction and release\nMortal Kombat: Conquest was produced by Threshold Entertainment (who produced the Mortal Kombat film series) in association with New Line Television (television arm of the films' distributor). Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution distributed the series. The program was filmed at Disney-MGM Studios in Orlando, Florida. The Warner Bros. unit (eventual holder of the Mortal Kombat property), as New Line's corporate sibling-turned-parent, syndicated the series until it was later picked up by TNT, which aired the remaining new episodes in addition to broadcasting repeats of the first-run syndication run. With a lucrative timeslot following WCW Monday Nitro, Conquest was very popular, but according to the show's developer, Joshua Wexler, this resulted in higher budget costs for the show than anticipated. The cancellation was not announced at first, and rumors of a second season circulated. However, TNT pulled the plug on the show, leaving it with a cliffhanger ending. The ending was planned to have been resolved in the second season, which would have summed up the series and corresponded with the MK timeline.\nEpisodes\n|country         = US\n|episodes        =\n|ProdCode        = 1\n|ShortSummary    = After defeating Shang Tsung in Mortal Kombat, Kung Lao must learn that victory is not the end but only the beginning.\n|LineColor       = 50A6C2\n}}\n|ProdCode        = 2\n|ShortSummary    = After barely managing to escape execution, Kung Lao rushes with Siro and Taja to save his love from a new deadly enemy: Scorpion.\n|LineColor       = 50A6C2\n}}\n|ProdCode        = 3\n|ShortSummary    = Kung Lao and his friends find themselves attacked by the Lin Kuei and their most powerful fighter, Sub-Zero.\n|LineColor       = 50A6C2\n}}\n|ProdCode        = 4\n|ShortSummary    = Due to Shang Tsung's sorcery, Siro and Taja are rapidly aging and it's up to Kung Lao not only to find a cure for them, but also fight the sorcerer.
