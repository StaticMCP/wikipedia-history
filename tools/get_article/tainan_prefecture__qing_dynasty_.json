      "text": "# Tainan Prefecture (Qing dynasty)\n\nTainan Prefecture () was a prefecture of Taiwan under Qing rule. The prefecture was established by the Qing dynasty government in 1887, when Fokien-Taiwan Province was established. The prefecture included the districts/counties of Anping, Kagi, Fengshan, and Hengchun, and the sub-prefecture of Penghu.\nThe island was previously governed as Taiwan Prefecture, with its capital at Taiwan-fu in the south. With the reorganization beginning in 1885, Taiwan-fu was moved north to a new location in the center of the island, outside of the boundaries of the new Tainan Prefecture. Thus the southern city formerly called Taiwan-fu was renamed Tainan-fu. This is the name origin of modern-day Tainan.\nSee also\n* Zhou (country subdivision)\n* Taiwan under Qing rule\n* Tainan\n* Tainan Prefecture\n* Taiwan Prefecture (1887–1895)\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
