It was consecrated on 14 May 1933 under the title of \"Christ the King\". Then it was attended by a French priest in the Foreign Missions of Paris, Louis Vallet (1869–1945), who devoted his life to parishioners and was subsequently buried there.\nWhen the Apostolic Vicariate of Nha Trang was erected in 1957 through Crescit Laetissimo by Pope Pius XII and the Diocese of Nha Trang created in 1960, with Paul Raymond Marie Marcel Piquet from the Foreign Missions as the first bishop, the church was chosen as the cathedral.\nThe Cathedral, very well located in the upper part of this coastal city next to the Nha Trang Station, has a remarkable amount of stained glass windows depicting saints, including several French saints, such as St. Joan of Arc and St. John Vianney, and episodes from the life of Jesus.\nArchbishop Colomban Dreyer – the Apostolic Delegate to Indochina – blessed the Cathedral's bell, the gift from a catholic in Saigon, on 29 July 1934. The bell tower was completed on 3 December 1935.\nGallery\nFile:Ntct3.jpg|Front view\nFile: Entrance of Nha Trang Cathedral.jpg|Main entrance\nFile:Nha Trang Cathedral.jpg|Side\nFile:Mặt tiền Nhà thờ Núi.JPG|Façade\nFile:Mặt bên Nhà thờ núi 2.JPG|Side\nFile:Nha Trang Cathedral, Inside Front.JPG|Apse\nFile:Nha Trang Cathedral, Back Inside.jpg|Choir loft\nFile:Christ the King Cathedral Nha Trang.JPG|Side view of the church from Our Lady Square\nFile:Một buổi lễ bên trong nhà thờ.JPG|A Mass at the Cathedral\nFile:Cửa vòm.JPG|Arched door architecture in the hallway\nFile:Father Vallet Tomb.JPG|The grave of Fr.
