The first debris mitigation standards were expected in 2008, with more International Standards, technical specifications or technical reports expected to be published through to 2011–2012.\nSee also\n*Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink?func=ll&objId=5119704&objAction=browse&sort=name The ODCWG's public folder] on the ISO website."
