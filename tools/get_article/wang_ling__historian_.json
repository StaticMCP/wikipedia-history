He was known for his collaboration with Joseph Needham on the history of science and technology in China.\nBiography\nWang Ling was born in Nantong, China, and graduated in history from National Central University (Nanjing University), which had moved from Nanjing to Chongqing during the Sino-Japanese war.  In 1943, while working as a junior researcher at the Academia Sinica's Institute of History and Philology in Lizhuang, Wang met Needham, a British biochemist who had been sent by the Royal Society and British Government to head the Sino-British Science Cooperation Office, whose mission was to assist the universities of China.\nNeedham had already conceived a plan for a book on the history of Chinese scientific and technological achievement, which was generally little known and appreciated in the West at that time, and recruited Wang as his chief researcher and first collaborator on the project.  Science and Civilisation in China subsequently grew to many volumes and changed educated and popular views of China in the West; it is regarded as one of the world's pre-eminent investigations of Chinese civilisation.\nFrom 1948 to 1958 Wang worked on the project with Needham at Cambridge University, along the way obtaining his doctorate at Trinity College, Cambridge on the history of Chinese mathematics in the Han Dynasty. In 1958 he left Cambridge to take up a position as lecturer in Chinese at Canberra University College, later the faculty of Asian studies at the Australian National University.\nHe was a professorial fellow at the Department of Far Eastern History in the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies (RSPAS) at Australian National University from 1963 to 1983.  In 1992 Wang Ling returned to Nantong, where he lived until his death in June 1994.\nPublications\n*1954. Science and Civilisation in China. Vol. 1. Introductory Orientations.
