Reunited with her debut record label Decca, the album is Lulu's first in a decade and the first of her career in which she co-wrote all of the original songs. In addition, two covers are featured: Jimi Hendrix's \"Angel\", in the style of Rod Stewart's hit version, and the traditional American folk song \"Wayfaring Stranger\". A digital only deluxe edition also includes new recordings of three songs from Lulu's career.\nThe album was preceded by the lead single, \"Faith in You\". Lulu promoted the release with several television appearances including a live performance on the BBC's The One Show. In May 2015, Lulu embarked on her first solo UK and Ireland tour in over ten years in support of the album. The second single, \"Cry\", was released to radio on 14 August 2015. A new version, recorded with the Military Wives choirs, was released on 26 February 2016 with all proceeds going to the Military Wives Choir Foundation.\nCritical reception\n|rev3 = The Guardian\n|rev3score =\n|rev4 = The Telegraph\n|rev4score =\n}}\nMaking Life Rhyme has generally received positive reviews from music critics. Neil McCormick of The Telegraph gave the album four stars and wrote \"Making Life Rhyme is the best thing Lulu has done since the early Seventies\".\nThe Guardian gave the album a three star rating, adding \"There's little in the way of surprises but this is a solidly enjoyable collection\".\nThe online music guide AllMusic praised the album, giving it a four star review, with Stephen Thomas Erlewine commenting: \"Arriving ten years after Lulu's impressive 2004 comeback Back on Track, 2015's Making Life Rhyme is every bit that record's equal and perhaps it's better in some ways\". He concluded that the record \"ranks among her very best\".\nTrack listing\n| length1         = 3:48\n| title2          = Every Single Day\n| writer2         =\n| length2         = 3:19\n| title3          = The Answer Is Love\n| writer3         =\n| length3         = 3:34\n| title4          = Cry\n| writer4         =\n| length4         = 4:08\n| title5          = Poison Kiss\n| writer5         =\n| length5         = 3:28\n| title6          = Hypnotised\n| writer6         =\n| length6         = 3:35\n| title7          = Heaven Help\n| writer7         =\n| length7         = 3:42\n| title8          = Make Life Rhyme\n| writer8         =\n| length8         = 3:20\n| title9          = Angel\n| writer9         = Jimi Hendrix\n| length9         = 3:32\n| title10         = Messed Up World\n| writer10        =\n| length10        = 4:00\n| title11         = Wayfaring Stranger\n| writer11        = Traditional\n| length11        = 2:09\n}}\n| length13        = 4:40\n| title14         = I Don't Wanna Fight\n| note14          = 2015 version\n| writer14        =\n| length14        = 4:42\n}}\nCharts\nMaking Life Rhyme peaked at number 35 on the UK Albums Chart during the week starting 25 April 2015, but by the following week had dropped out of the top 100.\nReferences"
