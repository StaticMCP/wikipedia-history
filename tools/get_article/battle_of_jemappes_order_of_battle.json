Though the Austrians were outnumbered three-to-one, the victory greatly encouraged the population of the young First French Republic and lead to the evacuation of Austrian forces from the Austrian Netherlands.  Note: all units have their names as they are translated in English.\nArmy of the Ardennes\nThe Army of the Ardennes is led by Divisional General Charles-François du Périer Dumouriez.  Dumouriez gave his army the private name of the 'Army of Belgium' (Armée de la Belgique), however this was never officially recognised or adopted.  Note: all cavalry regiments have 3 x squadrons unless otherwise noted.  All line infantry regiments have 2 x battalions unless other wise noted.\n* Army of the Ardennes, commanded by Divisional General Charles-François du Périer Dumouriez\n** Reserve, commanded by Maréchal de Camp Louis-Charles de La Motte-Ango, Vicomte de Flers\n*** 2 x Squadrons, Gendarmerie Nationale\n*** 2nd–5th (at least) plus more?
