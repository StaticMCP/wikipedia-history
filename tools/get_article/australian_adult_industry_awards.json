Since its inception in 2001 the AAIA has been owned and operated by sex expert Maxine Fensom. Fensom is well known in the adult industry for founding a number of strip clubs, strippers’ agencies, themed events, and adult online stores. She is also the founder and owner of the national Miss Erotica and Miss Dream Girl pageants.\nIn 2004, the organisers of the awards became a partner of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) to encourage 16,000 sex workers to declare their income. As part of the effort, the ATO sponsored the event.\nJohn Lark won the lifetime achievement award in 2006 for his contribution to the industry as a producer of 20 films featuring Australian stars, including Alice Springs and Kelly Blue.\nReferences"
