Although most of the popular suggestions made it in the game, some of the ideas could not be implemented in Starpoint Gemini 2. The feature requests not suitable for Starpoint Gemini 2 were kept on a wishlist and became the base of the new spin-off title Starpoint Gemini Warlords.

The game was scheduled to stay approximately 6 to 12 months in Steam Early Access and was finished and released after 11 months. It was released for Windows via Steam on 23 May 2017 and for Xbox One on 9 February 2018.\nFeatures\nStarpoint Gemini Warlords is a role-playing space sim with a 4X layer. Players can captain various space ships ranging from gunships to carriers and give orders to war fleets on the strategy map. The game takes place in the Gemini System and features pre-scripted story missions (Campaign) and a free roam mode (Conquest).\nRelease\nStarpoint Gemini Warlords was released on May 23, 2017, on Steam and GoG in two versions - Standard and Deluxe Edition. Deluxe Edition includes 160 page full color Artbook, Original Game Soundtrack composed by Nikola Nikita Jeremić, selection of wallpapers and Twitch Overlays.\nReception\nThe game received mixed to positive reviews and currently holds an aggregated score of 73 on Metacritic, based on 11 reviews, and a score of 70% on Gamerankings, based on 6 reviews.\n|GR = (PC) 70/100\n}}\nSales\nThe game sold more than 200,000 copies.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
