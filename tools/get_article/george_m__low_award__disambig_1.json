NASA characterizes it as a \"premier award\". NASA's chief of safety and mission assurance, Terrence Wilcutt, called it \"our recognition for their management's leadership and employee commitment to the highest standards in performance.\"\nThe award was named after George M. Low, a NASA leader and former administrator who spearheaded efforts to improve quality and mitigate risk after the disastrous Apollo 1 fire. He provided management and direction for the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and advanced crewed missions programs.\nRecipients\n* 2012 - URS Federal Services; ATA Engineering, Inc.\n* 2011 - Sierra Lobo, Inc.; Teledyne Brown Engineering\n* 2010 - Analytical Mechanics Associates, Inc.; Neptec Design Group; Jacobs Technology, Inc.; ATK Aerospace Systems\n* 2009 - United Space Alliance; Applied Geo Technologies\n* 2008 - ARES Corporation; Oceaneering International\n* 2007 - ASRC Aerospace Corporation; Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne; Sierra Lobo; Lockheed Martin\n* 2006 - Teledyne Brown Engineering; Barrios Technologies\n* 2005 - SGT Inc; ATK Thiokol; QSS Group, Inc.; BTAS, Inc\n* 2004 - BTAS, Inc.
