Still, this feature  [...] impresses, bringing a distinctively gritty flavour to its vision of lives on the fringes of working class Cairo\". Ali Benzekri from International Cinephile Society praised Mansour's \"deliberate sobriety that grounds the film in an extreme realism\" as well as Essam Omar's performance, that \"places him firmly in the conversation about the future of Egyptian cinema, particularly for up-and-coming actors. His ability to convey profound emotional depth without relying heavily on dialogue speaks volumes about his range and presence on screen\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
