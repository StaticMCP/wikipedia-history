According to Dahl, the battle began when they were attacked by a large group of German Luftwaffe aircraft, mostly Messerschmitt Bf 109s and Bf 110s along with some Junkers Ju 87s and Junkers Ju 88s. According to the citizens of Athens the Germans had 200 planes; according to Dahl, they had 152 bombers and fighters.\nIn the resulting battle four RAF pilots were shot down and killed, including the famous Marmaduke \"Pat\" Pattle and the Irish RAF pilot [http://surfcity.kund.dalnet.se/commonwealth_woods.htm William \"Timber\" Woods], and one pilot lost his Hawker Hurricane but was able to escape. Dahl states that Greek observers counted 22 German aircraft shot down, although another source states that the Germans lost eight aircraft. Dahl escaped from Greece with the remnants of his squadron. Dahl's close friend, David Coke, was credited with shooting down one Junker.\nReferences"
