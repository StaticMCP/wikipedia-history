DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award winner]]\nJimmy Fallon opened the ceremony with a long homage to La La Land, with cameos from Nicole Kidman, Amy Adams, Ryan Reynolds, Tina Fey, Justin Timberlake, and others. His opening speech was marred by a brief delay after his teleprompter broke.\nMeryl Streep, recipient of the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award, used her acceptance speech to criticize, without stating names, President-elect Donald Trump's alleged imitation of disabled New York Times journalist Serge F. Kovaleski, stating: \"Disrespect invites disrespect. Violence incites violence. When powerful people use their position to bully we all lose.\" On the subject of diversity in Hollywood, Streep said, \"Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners, and if we kick them all out, you'll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts.\"\n* Ben Affleck, Sienna Miller and Zoe Saldana with Best Director – Motion Picture\n* Casey Affleck introduced Manchester by the Sea\n* Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant with Best Television Series – Comedy or Musical and Best Actress in a Television Series – Comedy or Musical\n* Kristen Bell and Cuba Gooding Jr. with Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film\n* Annette Bening introduced 20th Century Women\n* Matt Bomer and Naomi Campbell with Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film\n* Pierce Brosnan introduced Sing Street\n* Steve Carell and Kristen Wiig with Best Animated Feature Film\n* Jessica Chastain and Eddie Redmayne with Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy\n* Priyanka Chopra and Jeffrey Dean Morgan with Best Actor in a Television Series – Drama\n* Matt Damon with Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy\n* Viola Davis with Cecil B.

Donald Trump responded to Streep's comments on Twitter, describing her as \"one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood\" and a \"Hillary flunky\", and stating, \"For the 100th time, I never 'mocked' a disabled reporter (would never do that) but simply showed him 'groveling' when he totally changed a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad. Just more very dishonest media!\"\nLorenzo Soria, president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) which runs the annual Golden Globes ceremony, wrote on Twitter on January 10: \"As an organisation of journalists, the HFPA stands by your defence of free expression and we reject any calls for censorship\". Dana White, president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, responded to Streep's reference to mixed martial arts (MMA), defending the sport as an art, and saying that \"the last thing I expect is for an uppity 80-year-old lady to be in our demographic and love mixed martial arts\". Scott Coker, president of Bellator MMA, also defended MMA as an art, and highlighted the sport's diversity; he invited Streep to attend an event.\nTom Hiddleston received backlash on social media for mentioning that Sudanese medical workers had \"binge-watched\" The Night Manager, while accepting the award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film. He apologized after the ceremony for his \"inelegantly expressed\" remarks.\nRichard Lawson, reviewing the ceremony in Vanity Fair, stated that Jimmy Fallon's opening homage to La La Land began as \"a fun, starry sampling of this year's nominees\", but had \"worn out its welcome\" before the end. Lawson described Fallon as an \"oddly tone-deaf\" host, and criticized his opening speech: \"The jokes were stale and wheezy and Fallon's lovable-cute shtick was more wearying than it was charming.\" He praised Kristen Wiig and Steve Carell's introduction of the Best Animated Feature Film award as \"hilarious [...] weird, inspired, clever without smirking\".\nThe Guardians film critic Peter Bradshaw expressed disappointment that La La Lands success \"shut out a lot of contenders that are now in danger of being forgotten and losing momentum\", particularly highlighting Nocturnal Animals and Moonlight. He praised Isabelle Huppert's win for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, calling it \"the most extraordinary award\".\nRatings\nThe ceremony averaged a Nielsen 5.6 ratings/18 share, and was watched by 20.02 million viewers. The ratings was an eight percent increase from the previous year's ceremony's viewership of 18.5 million, becoming the third highest in a decade.\nIn Memoriam\nNo \"In Memoriam\" section was broadcast on television during the ceremony. The HFPA included a slideshow on their website including the following names:\n* Pat Harrington Jr.\n* David Bowie\n* Alan Rickman\n* George Kennedy\n* Larry Drake\n* Ken Howard\n* Garry Shandling\n* Earl Hamner Jr.\n* Patty Duke\n* Ronit Elkabetz\n* Prince\n* Muhammad Ali\n* Christina Grimmie\n* Theresa Saldana\n* Peter Shaffer\n* Anton Yelchin\n* Michael Cimino\n* Abbas Kiarostami\n* Hector Babenco\n* Garry Marshall\n* Fyvush Finkel\n* Arthur Hiller\n* Gene Wilder\n* Hugh O'Brian\n* Curtis Hanson\n* Robert Vaughn\n* Alan Thicke\n* Zsa Zsa Gabor\n* George Michael\n* Carrie Fisher\n* Debbie Reynolds\nSee also\n* 22nd Critics' Choice Awards\n* 23rd Screen Actors Guild Awards\n* 37th Golden Raspberry Awards\n* 70th British Academy Film Awards\n* 89th Academy Awards\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
