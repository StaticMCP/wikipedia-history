      "text": "# Ghanteswari Temple\n\nMaa Ghanteshwari temple is a temple located in Chiplima which is 30&nbsp;km from Sambalpur city via NH 6 in Odisha, India as of now. A bridge is constructed (called Chaurpur bridge) at Mundoghat a strategically important place between Sambalpur and Chiplima. As of December 2018, it is fully functional. It has halved the distance between Maa Ghanteswari Temple and Sambalpur.\nAs the name suggests there are bells everywhere. People offer bells to the goddess Ghanteswari or the Deity of Bells, after fulfillment of their wishes. Many pilgrims from across the state visit the temple. It is known as the 'lighthouse without light', built by the early sailors, for whom the bells served as warning against heavy winds. The special significance of this place lies in the great number of small bells hanging all around.\nMaa Ghanteshwari Temple is situated  southwest of the district capital Sambalpur on the bank of Mahanadi River. The Chipilima Hydro Powerplant (CHEP) is located near the temple on the same river bank.\nSee also\n* List of Hindu temples in India\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://travel.sulekha.com/sambalpur-attractions.htm  Sambalpur Attractions, Ghanteshwari Temple.] Sulekha.com\n* [http://family.webshots.com/photo/2958237930032214551UkLZPt  Photo of accumulated bells at the entrance to Ganteswari]"
