In the 1930s she was Guide Commissioner for Camping.

Each team provided on-the-ground support in Europe after World War II, including Bergen-Belsen displaced persons camp.\nWard agreed to be temporary chair of the GIS committee until “a more suitable person was found”. She held the position for 12 years, the entire duration of the organisation's existence. In this role she organised training, test camps and lectures for prospective recruits. She also oversaw a significant fundraising effort to equip teams and train volunteer leaders, with Girl Guides in the UK and across the Commonwealth raising £168,890 (equivalent to £4,600,000 in 2023) towards GIS's relief work.\nWard first travelled to the British occupation zone in Germany in November 1945, making an annual tour of every GIS team in Europe for the subsequent five years.\nAwards and honours\n* 1928 – Silver Fish Award\n* 1948 – OBE for her work with GIS\n* 1997 – two stained glass windows were dedicated to Ward in the main hall of Tŷ Clwyd, Girlguiding Clwyd's County House in Llanfair Talhaiarn where “the rays of light stream through to inspire the next generation of Rainbows, Brownies) and Guides.”\n* 2017 – Ward's outstanding commitment to Guiding in Wales and the GIS was recognised in the Welsh Year of Legends\nPersonal life\nRosa Cliff Ward was born in Dunga Gali, Bengal, India to father Brigadier General Thomas Ward and mother Jeanette Octavia.
