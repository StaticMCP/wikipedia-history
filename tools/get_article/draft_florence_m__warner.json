Warner\n\nFlorence Maude Warner (December 15, 1878, South Dakota – June 2, 1926, Chicago) was a North-American inventor and businesswoman who developed a pioneer color photography process.\nBiography\nWarner established a working partnership with inventor John H. Powrie in her youth, an association that lasted until her death. The two initially conducted experiments at Warner’s home in Milwaukee. In 1907, Warner, her mother, Mary Warner, and Powrie went to London to take part in the first annual exhibition of the Society of Color Photographers, where they presented the results of their Warner-Powrie process.\nIn the 1910s, their experiments with color photography continued in partnership with the Edison Laboratories in New Jersey, with the aim of developing a color film for cinematography and photography. A fire and the disruption of chemical supplies caused by World War I halted the work at Warner’s laboratory, but in 1920 the experiments were resumed in New York, where she founded Warner Research. Her partnership with Powrie and her role as director of Warner Research continued until her death, after a brief illness, in Chicago in 1926. Warner was buried in New York.\nThe Warner-Powrie Process\nThe Warner-Powrie process was publicly announced for the first time in The British Journal of Photography in 1907. The method used a “Florence” chromatic plate, which consisted of a screen made up of fine green, red, and blue lines printed on a glass plate, which was then coated with panchromatic emulsion and exposed.\nAt a time when numerous inventors and photographers were dedicated to developing and improving color photography, the Warner-Powrie method was considered promising. According to the editors of Photo-Era: The American Journal of Photography, the process represented a major advancement in color photography because it was simpler than Autochrome—another color photography process created around the same time that became the most popular among the various methods in development. In addition to requiring only one negative, the Warner-Powrie method allowed for the production of multiple positives. It also made it possible to print on paper, rather than only on glass plates as was the case with Autochrome. For Edward John Wall, a leading color photography expert of the time who saw the results of Warner and Powrie’s method at the Society of Color Photographers exhibition in London, the process represented the future of color photography—if it could be marketed at affordable prices. However, despite the good results achieved and the positive reception among photography experts, the Warner-Powrie process was never commercialized.\n----\nReferences"
