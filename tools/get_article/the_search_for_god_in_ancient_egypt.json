      "text": "# The Search for God in Ancient Egypt\n\nThe Search for God in Ancient Egypt () is a 1984 book by the German egyptologist Jan Assmann. It is a study of ancient Egyptian theology, relying on a wide range of sources.\nThe book had significant influence on subsequent academic study of Egyptian religion and theology. A revised version was published in English translation by David Lorton in 2001. Kasia Szpakowska wrote in Electronic Antiquity in 2003 that the English translation is \"masterful\" and although \"it is not a beginner's book, it should be read by anyone seriously interested in Egyptian religion or the study of religions in general\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9780801487293/the-search-for-god-in-ancient-egypt/#bookTabs=1 Cornell University Press]"
