      "text": "# The Time Warp of Dr. Brain\n\n|genre = Educational, puzzle\n|modes = Single-player\n|platforms = Macintosh, Windows, Windows 3.x\n}}\nThe Time Warp of Dr. Brain is the fourth installment of the educational game series Dr. Brain by Sierra On-Line. The game's structure is similar to its predecessor, The Lost Mind of Dr. Brain: the player must complete several puzzles which appeal to a specific part of the brain; however, this game also adds a time-period based theme to each puzzle and the game's theme overall is time travel.\nGameplay\nLike the previous titles, The Time Warp of Dr. Brain is a simple point-and-click. The objective of the game is to successfully complete a set of 10 puzzles. Throughout the game, Dr. Brain poses as an advisor to the player, constantly passing witty comments and suggestions. There are three difficulty levels: novice, expert, and genius, with each level containing its own set of predetermined puzzles. Each level has a set of 20 sub-games. Each game can be completed at the player's choosing, and the difficulty levels can be alternated between at any time; completion of each puzzle is based on the score accrued. A total of approximately 12000 points is needed to finish one of the games, with a win in novice, expert, and genius levels granting 250, 1000, and 2250 points, respectively.\nAt the start of the game is a mini-game similar to the video-game Space Invaders. This serves as the main menu of the game. The player must shoot the appropriate spaceship to choose options.\nReception\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
