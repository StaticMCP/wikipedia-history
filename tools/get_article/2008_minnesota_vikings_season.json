They won their 17th NFC North division title with a 10–6 record, the first time since 2000 that they made the playoffs with a winning record; however, they finished behind the New York Giants and Carolina Panthers and had to play in the wild card round of the playoffs. They were paired with Childress's former team, the Philadelphia Eagles, who won 26–14. Second-year running back Adrian Peterson led the league in rushing with 1,760 yards.\nOffseason\nPlayer and personnel moves\nReleases and injuries\nOn February 11, it was announced that defensive end Kenechi Udeze had been diagnosed by doctors with a form of leukemia. KMSP-TV also reported that Udeze was at Fairview Southdale Hospital undergoing tests and that he had been at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester the week before. Udeze was expected to be out for the 2008 season, but returned for one game against the Green Bay Packers on November 9 before ultimately retiring from professional football on July 29, 2009.\nOn February 20, the team released free safety Dwight Smith after two somewhat controversial seasons with the Vikings in which Smith had several run-ins with the law. He was due to receive $2.5&nbsp;million and a $500,000 roster bonus this season.\nOn February 27, the team released backup quarterback Kelly Holcomb.\nOn February 29, the team traded wide receiver Troy Williamson to the Jacksonville Jaguars for a sixth-round pick in the 2008 draft\nand linebacker Dontarrious Thomas left the team to join the San Francisco 49ers.\nOn March 1, the Vikings' former defensive tackle Spencer Johnson joined the Buffalo Bills.\nOn March 3, free agent running back Mewelde Moore left the team to join the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nOn March 7, safety Tank Williams joined the New England Patriots and fullback Tony Richardson joined the New York Jets.\nSignings and extensions\nOn February 29, the team signed safety Madieu Williams, formerly of the Cincinnati Bengals, and fullback Thomas Tapeh, formerly of the Philadelphia Eagles.\nOn March 1, the team signed wide receiver Bernard Berrian, formerly of the Chicago Bears.\nOn March 4, running back and special teams specialist Maurice Hicks, formerly of the San Francisco 49ers, signed a three-year contract to join the team.\nOn March 14, the team signed linebacker and special-teams standout Derrick Pope, formerly of the Miami Dolphins.\nOn March 17, the Vikings signed former Seattle Seahawks defensive tackle Ellis Wyms, and re-signed wide receiver Robert Ferguson; all to one-year contracts.\nOn March 20 and March 21, Houston Texans safety Michael Boulware and former Green Bay Packers career backup defensive tackle Kenderick Allen to one-year contracts.\nOn March 24, restricted free agent linebacker Heath Farwell was re-resigned to a one-year contract. Also, on the next day, the team signed former Kansas City Chiefs cornerback Benny Sapp to a one-year contract.\nOn April 8, former Vikings backup quarterback Gus Frerotte rejoined the team on a one-year contract.\nOn April 23, Kansas City Chiefs defensive end Jared Allen signed a six-year contract with the Vikings in a trade that gave the Chiefs the Vikings' 2008 first-round draft pick and both third-round picks. The trade may also involve the swapping of 2008 sixth round draft picks with Kansas City.\nOn July 22, the Vikings signed their fifth-round pick, defensive tackle Letroy Guion, and their seventh-round pick, wide receiver Jaymar Johnson.}}\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|7\n!209\n|colspan=\"4\"|Traded to the Green Bay Packers\n|From Rams\n|-\n!226\n|colspan=\"4\"|Traded to the New York Jets\n|\n|}\nNotes:\nAll selections were moved up one overall position as the New England Patriots forfeited their first-round pick (originally 31st overall) due to the \"Spygate scandal\".\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Notable undrafted free agents\n!style=\"background:#3b0160;color:#ffc322\"|Name\n!style=\"background:#3b0160;color:#ffc322\"|Position\n!style=\"background:#3b0160;color:#ffc322\"|College\n|-\n|Husain Abdullah\n|S\n|Washington State\n|-\n|Stephen Hauschka\n|K\n|NC State\n|-\n|Erin Henderson\n|LB\n|Maryland\n|-\n|Darius Reynaud\n|WR\n|West Virginia\n|}\nTraining camp\n.]]\nOn May 27, Erasmus James was traded to the Washington Redskins for a conditional 2009 NFL draft pick.\nOn June 27, the Vikings signed a one-day contract with seven-season member Robert Griffith so he could ceremonially retire as a member of the team.\nOn July 16, Jay Glazer reported that the Green Bay Packers had filed tampering charges against the Vikings for allegedly inappropriately contacting Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre.\nOn August 4, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell ruled that contact between the Vikings and Brett Favre over the summer did not violate league tampering rules, as the Packers alleged, mostly because Favre was retired at the time.\nStaff\nRoster\n|Running Backs=\n|Wide Receivers=\n|Tight Ends=\n|Offensive Linemen=\n|Defensive Linemen=\n|Linebackers=\n|Defensive Backs=\n|Special Teams=\n|Reserve Lists=\n|Practice Squad=\n}}\nPreseason\nSchedule\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

After a scoreless first quarter, the Vikings attacked first with kicker Ryan Longwell getting a 37-yard field goal. The Packers responded with quarterback Aaron Rodgers completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to fullback Korey Hall, along with kicker Mason Crosby getting a 42-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Vikes tried to catch up as Longwell got a 27-yard field goal, but Green Bay replied with cornerback Will Blackmon returning a punt 76 yards for a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, Minnesota tried to rally as quarterback Tarvaris Jackson completed a 23-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Sidney Rice (with a failed two-point conversion), yet the Packers responded with Rodgers getting a 1-yard touchdown run. The Vikes replied with a 3-yard touchdown run from running back Adrian Peterson, but their final rally ended in an interception.\nWith the loss, not only did the Vikings begin their season at 0–1, but head coach Brad Childress fell to 0–5 against the Packers in his coaching career.

In the second quarter, Minnesota increased their lead with former Packer Ryan Longwell kicking a 54-yard field goal, along with the Vikings picking up back-to-back safeties: first Aaron Rodgers gave away an intentional grounding penalty in his own endzone, before Vikings defensive end Jared Allen sacked Rodgers in his own endzone for the second.

In the first quarter, Chicago struck first, with quarterback Kyle Orton completing a 65-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Devin Hester. The Vikings responded in the second quarter with Longwell getting a 23-yard field goal. Later in the quarter, the Vikings defense came up big with a goal-line stand. Defensive end Jared Allen made the key tackle just an inch short of the end zone on fourth-and-goal. On the very next play, Frerotte ran a play-action fake from his own endzone and found former Bear Bernard Berrian for a 99-yard touchdown pass. This tied an NFL record for the longest pass from scrimmage and it was the first-ever longest offensive touchdown play in franchise history. It was also the 11th time in NFL history that a 99-yard play was made. Then, with 1:09 left until halftime, Frerotte found tight end Jim Kleinsasser for a 21-yard gain to just inside the one-yard line. The play was originally ruled a touchdown, but was officially reviewed and it was determined that he was just short of the goal line. On the next play however, Frerotte got the touchdown on a 1-yard quarterback sneak with 44 seconds left until the half.\nIn the third quarter, both teams traded blows. The Bears answered a 2-yard touchdown pass from Orton to running back Matt Forté, while Minnesota answered with a 21-yard touchdown run from Taylor. In the fourth quarter, the Vikes pulled away as Peterson got a 1-yard touchdown run, while Longwell nailed a 27-yard field goal.\nWith the win, the Vikings improved to 7–5 and took first place in the NFC North for the first time since early in the 2007 season.\nWeek 14: at Detroit Lions\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week 14: Minnesota Vikings at Detroit Lions&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=December 7\n|time=1:00&nbsp;p.m.\n|road=Vikings\n|R1=0 |R2=3 |R3=7 |R4=10\n|home=Lions\n|H1=3 |H2=3 |H3=7 |H4=3\n|stadium=Ford Field, Detroit, Michigan\n|attendance=50,444\n|weather=None (indoor stadium)\n|referee=Jerome Boger\n|TV=Fox\n|TVAnnouncers=Sam Rosen, Tim Ryan and Chris Myers\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/games/vikings-at-lions-2008-reg-14 Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/29723/DET_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\nFirst quarter\n*DET – Jason Hanson 25-yard field goal, 1:01.
