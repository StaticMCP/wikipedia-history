The Rainbow Warriors played their final home games at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu as members of the Mountain West Conference. They were led by first-year head coach Todd Graham.\nOn August 10, 2020, the Mountain West Conference suspended all fall sports competitions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This decision was later reversed on September 24, with all 12 teams playing an eight-game, conference-only schedule starting on October 24.\nThe Rainbow Warriors ended their season with a winning record for the third year in a row, also claiming the New Mexico Bowl over Houston. Graham also became the first Hawaii coach since Bob Wagner in 1987 to win his debut; the last five had lost their debuts, all by 20 points or more.\nPreseason\nAward watch lists\nListed in the order that they were released\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Doak Walker Award\n|Miles Reed\n|align=center|RB\n|align=center|JR\n|-\n|Fred Biletnikoff Award\n|Jared Smart\n|align=center|WR\n|align=center|SR\n|-\n|Outland Trophy\n|Ilm Manning\n|align=center|OL\n|align=center|JR\n|-\n|Rimington Trophy\n|Taaga Tuulima\n|align=center|C\n|align=center|SR\n|-\n|Wuerffel Trophy\n|Hekili Keliliki\n|align=center|RB\n|align=center|JR\n|-\n|Burlsworth Trophy\n|Taaga Tuulima\n|align=center|C\n|align=center|SR\n|-\n|}\nMountain West media days\nThe Mountain West media days was initially set to be virtually held on the days of July 27–29, but were later postponed by the conference.\nMedia poll\nThe preseason poll was released on July 21, 2020. Hawaii was initially picked to finish third in the West Division. The divisions were later suspended for the 2020 season.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"display: inline-table;\"\n|+West\n|- align=\"center\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 1 || San Diego State || 122 (19)\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2 || Nevada || 100 (2)\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 3 || Hawaii || 74\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 4 || Fresno State || 73\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 5 || San Jose State || 43\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 6 || UNLV || 29\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"display: inline-table;\"\n|+Mountain\n|- align=\"center\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 1 || Boise State || 125 (20)\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2 || Wyoming || 90 (1)\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 3 || Air Force || 86\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 4 || Utah State || 60\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 5 || Colorado State || 59\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 6 || New Mexico || 21\n|}\nPreseason All-Mountain West Team\nThe Rainbow Warriors only had one player selected to the preseason All–Mountain West Team.\nOffense\nIlm Manning – OL\nSchedule\nHawaii had its first four games against Arizona, UCLA, Fordham and Oregon canceled before the start of the 2020 season. Each cancellation, related to the COVID-19 pandemic, was due to individual conferences attempting to reduce spread of the virus through travel restrictions. Robert Morris later replaced Fordham on the schedule, announced on July 13, 2020.\nThe entire season was suspended by the Mountain West Conference on August 10, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the decision was reversed on September 24, with the conference announcing each team would play an eight-game, conference-only schedule. The new schedule was released by the Mountain West on October 1, 2020. Hawaii played seven of their original conference opponents, with the only change being Wyoming replacing Air Force on the schedule. Hawaii Athletics also announced that home games would be held without fans, in accordance with government regulations.\nThe game scheduled for December 5 with San Jose State was moved to Aloha Stadium after new COVID-19 restrictions were released in Santa Clara County, where CEFCU Stadium is located. Hawaii played as the designated road team in their new all-white road uniforms, which debuted against Fresno State.\n|\n| homecoming =\n| time = 3:45 p.m.\n| w/l = l\n| away = y\n| rank =\n| opponent = Wyoming\n| gamename = Paniolo Trophy Game\n| site_stadium = War Memorial Stadium\n| site_cityst = Laramie, WY\n| tv = FS1\n| score = 7–31\n| overtime =\n| attend = 6,232\n}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| homecoming =\n| time = 10:30 a.m.\n| w/l = W\n| nonconf = y\n| neutral = y\n| rank =\n| opponent = Houston\n| opprank =\n| gamename = New Mexico Bowl\n| site_stadium = Toyota Stadium\n| site_cityst = Frisco, TX\n| tv = ESPN\n| score = 28–14\n| overtime =\n| attend = 2,060\n}}\n}}\nRoster\ni|last=Akina|class=SR|rs=}}\nuanu-Kuhiiki|class=SR|rs=y}}\n|defensive_players=\ni|last=Mashima|class=JR|rs=y}}\nole|class=FR|rs=y}}\nala|class=JR|rs=y|link=y|dab=Blessman Ta'ala}}\nole|class=FR|rs=y}}\nala|class=FR|rs=}}\n|special_teams_players=\neo|last=Rezentes|class=FR|rs=}}\n}}\n)  Associate head coach/defensive coordinator/outside linebackers\n* G.
