In total, the city has designated more than 1500 structures or other properties as historical landmarks.\nThe Historical Landmarks listed here are located in the La Jolla and Torrey Pines areas. Four of the properties have also received recognition at the federal level by inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places and one—the George H. Scripps Memorial Marine Biological Laboratory—by designation as a National Historic Landmark.\nLa Jolla branch of the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, incorporating the 1915 Gill-designed Ellen Browning Scripps residence (not visible in this view)]]\nThe sites designated as landmarks include numerous structures designed by early Modern architect Irving J. Gill.  Also included is the Torrey Pines Area and several sites connected to La Jolla's long association with scientific research, including the George H. Scripps Memorial Marine Biological Laboratory and the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.\nListing\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:98%\"\n!  width=1% | SDHL #\n!  width=\"18%\" |Landmark name\n!  width=\"11%\" |Image\n!  width=\"4%\"  |Address\n!  width=\"12%\" |Designation Date\n!  width=\"41%\" |Description\n|-\n| | 10\n| Torrey Pines Area\n|\n| Torrey Pines State Reserve\n| 11/21/1969\n| Coastal park remains one of the wildest stretches of land (8&nbsp;km²) on the Southern California coast; consists of a plateau with cliffs that overlook Torrey Pines State Beach, and a lagoon used by migrating seabirds\n|-\n| | 79\n| La Jolla Woman's Club\n|\n| 715 Silverado St.\n| 3/2/1973\n| Clubhouse building designed by Irving Gill and built in 1914\n|-\n| | 84\n| Green Dragon Colony site\n|\n|  1258-1274 Prospect St.\n| 7/6/1973\n| Group of 12 coastal cottages built by German immigrant Anna Held Heinrich; became an artists colony; the remaining four cottages were demolished in 1991\n|-\n| | 86\n| La Jolla Recreational Center\n|\n| 615 Prospect St.\n| 9/7/1973\n| Built in 1915 by Ellen Browning-Scripps and dedicated that same year to the City of San Diego for the children of La Jolla; designed by Irving Gill\n|-\n| | 101\n| Red Roost and Red Rest\n|\n| 1187 and 1179 Coast Blvd.\n| 1/3/1975\n| Built in 1894, oldest surviving examples of late-Victorian beach cottage architecture; also known as the Neptune and Cove Tea Room; vacant since the 1980s and subject of controversy over \"demolition by neglect\"; Red Rest burned in November 2020.\n|-\n| | 102\n| Tyrolean Terrace Colony\n|\n| 1290-1298 Prospect St.\n| 2/7/1975\n| Built in 1911; demolished in 1975 to make room for Coast Walk Shopping Center\n|-\n| | 108\n| Pottery Canyon Park\n|\n| 2725 Torrey Pines Rd.\n| 2/6/1976\n| Five small structures; three built on park land in 1928, other two on private land\n|-\n| | 117\n| El Pueblo Ribera\n|\n| 230-248 Gravilla St.; 231-309 Playa del Sur\n| 2/4/1977\n| Pueblo Revival structures built in 1923, designed by architect Rudolph Schindler\n|-\n| | 119\n| George H.
