Its natural habitat is tropical moist lowland forests.\nDescription and taxonomy\nEBird describes the bird as \"A small kingfisher of lowland and foothill forest. Deep blue above with bright orange underparts, an orange spot between the bill and eye, a white throat and patch behind the cheek, and a bright red bill and legs. Blue upperparts can be dark or pale. Somewhat similar to Philippine Dwarf-Kingfisher, especially from the front or below, but Dimorphic has bright blue head and back. Voice includes various high-pitched chips, trills, and squeaks.\"\nThis species was formerly considered as one of the 15 recognised subspecies of what was then known as the variable dwarf kingfisher (Ceyx lepidus or Alcedo lepidus). A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2013 found that most of the insular subspecies had substantially diverged from one another. The variable dwarf kingfisher was therefore split and 12 of the subspecies, including the dimorphic dwarf kingfisher, were promoted to species status. At the same time the name of the variable dwarf kingfisher was changed to the Moluccan dwarf kingfisher.\nEcology and behavior\nIt is presumed to feed on invertebrates, small reptiles and fish. Typically observed alone or as a pair.\nNot much is known about their breeding habits. In 2024, a nest was observed on Panay built on the side of a clay cliff. Clutch size was 4 and took 21 days to fledge.\nHabitat and conservation status\nIts natural habitat is tropical moist lowland forests. To be precise, it inhabits islands such as Negros, Cebu, Camiguin Sur, Mindanao and many other small islands in the central and southern Philippines\nIUCN has assessed this bird as least-concern species but the population is decreasing. This species' main threat is habitat loss with wholesale clearance of forest habitats as a result of logging, agricultural conversion and mining activities occurring within the range.\nReferences"
