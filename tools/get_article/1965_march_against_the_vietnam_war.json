It was co-sponsored by Women's Strike for Peace. 12,000-20,000 attended, including Joan Baez, Judy Collins, and Phil Ochs. The host was I. F. Stone.\nSenator Ernest Gruening of Alaska, a World War I veteran and one of the two senators who voted against the Tonkin Gulf Resolution that gave credence to the direct combat role of the U.S. in the Vietnam War and allowed bombing of Vietnam without prior Congressional approval, spoke.\nAfter the speeches and music the crowd started to move toward the Capitol, down the National Mall from the Washington Monument.  Baez and others intercepted the impromptu march.\nSee also\n*United States in the Vietnam War\nReferences"
