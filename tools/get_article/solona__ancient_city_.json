Unfortunately this inscription, which was found at Ariminum (modern Rimini), affords no clue to the site of Solona: it is placed by Cluver at a place called Città del Sole (in the comune of Castrocaro Terme e Terra del Sole) about 8 km southwest of Forlì; but Smith claims that this site would seem too close to the latter, the then important town of Forum Livii.
