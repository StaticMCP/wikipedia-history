It is presented by the Department of Chemistry to a graduating student who records the strongest overall performance in organic chemistry, and is named in honour of Professor Oluwole Babafemi Familoni, an organic chemist and long serving member of the university's academic staff.\nIn a 2025 feature on UNILAG alumnus Mubarak Ayinla, the Nigerian newspaper The Guardian referred to the prize as the \"prestigious Professor Oluwole Familoni Award for the Best Graduating Student in Organic Chemistry\", highlighting it as a marker of high academic achievement in organic chemistry within the university context.\nBackground\nThe award is named for Oluwole Babafemi Familoni, a Nigerian professor of organic chemistry who has spent much of his career at the University of Lagos. He obtained his B.Sc. (Hons) in Chemistry in 1981, followed by an M.Phil. and Ph.D. in Organic Chemistry from UNILAG in 1986 and 1990 respectively. His research has focused on organic synthesis, especially heterocyclic compounds and bioactive natural products, including work on sulfur containing heterocycles and plant derived molecules.\nFamiloni has held a series of senior academic and administrative positions at the University of Lagos, including Head of the Department of Chemistry, Dean of the Faculty of Science and Deputy Vice Chancellor (Academic and Research). Outside the university he has taken on broader professional roles, such as serving on the executive board of Commonwealth Chemistry and participating in advisory and governance bodies in the chemical sciences.\nWithin UNILAG, the Professor Oluwole Familoni Award forms part of a wider pattern of faculty and departmental prizes that recognise strong student performance in specific disciplines. In this internal system, it is the prize that highlights excellence in organic chemistry among graduating students in the Department of Chemistry at undergraduate level.\nCriteria and selection\nPublic descriptions of the Professor Oluwole Familoni Award characterise it as a prize for the best graduating student in organic chemistry at the University of Lagos. In practice, this refers to a graduating chemistry student whose undergraduate record shows the highest overall level of achievement in organic chemistry, based on performance across a sequence of upper level lecture and laboratory modules in the subject.\nThe emphasis is on sustained academic performance rather than a single examination or project. Staff in the Department of Chemistry review cumulative grades in advanced organic chemistry and closely related coursework, together with evidence from practical work in departmental teaching laboratories, when deciding on the recipient for a particular graduating cohort.\nNotable recipients\nOne documented recipient of the award is Mubarak Ayinla, a University of Lagos alumnus who completed a B.Sc. in Chemistry (Pure and Applied) with First Class Honours. In its 2025 profile on his career, The Guardian reported that he had distinguished himself at UNILAG by winning \"the prestigious Professor Oluwole Familoni Award for the Best Graduating Student in Organic Chemistry\". His site lists the award among his University of Lagos honours, describing it as the prize for \"Best Graduating Student in Organic Chemistry\" in 2018.\nAfter completing his undergraduate degree, Ayinla went on to earn a Ph.D. in organic chemistry from the University of Massachusetts Lowell. At UMass Lowell he has been described as conducting research at the intersection of dynamic covalent chemistry, materials science and chemical microbiology, including work on self healing organic gels, modified bacterial metabolites aimed at overcoming antibiotic resistance and materials for environmental remediation. Nigerian and international coverage of his career has cited the Professor Oluwole Familoni Award as one of several indicators of his strong undergraduate performance in organic chemistry at UNILAG.\nImpact\nThe Professor Oluwole Familoni Award forms part of the internal system of prizes and honours used by the University of Lagos to recognise top graduating students in the sciences. Within that system, it functions as a subject specific indicator of outstanding performance in organic chemistry at undergraduate level, rather than as a stand alone national or professional society distinction.\nMedia references to the prize have appeared mainly in profiles of individual recipients. In the Guardian feature on Mubarak Ayinla, for example, the award is mentioned as one of the key markers of his academic record at UNILAG and as an early sign of his later trajectory as a researcher in organic chemistry. By drawing attention to undergraduate performance in a particular area, the award is intended within the Department of Chemistry to encourage strong engagement with advanced organic chemistry and to signal students who may be well placed to pursue postgraduate study or research careers in the field.\nSee also\n* Oluwole Babafemi Familoni\n* University of Lagos\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://unilag.edu.ng/ University of Lagos official website]"
