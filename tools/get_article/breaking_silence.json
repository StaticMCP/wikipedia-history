They took on a second mortgage to fund the album, as major record labels were no longer interested in Ian's work. \"I thought I was only going to get one more chance to record, so I wanted to make it count\", Ian said. It was her first album in seven years.\nThe album contains political songs such as \"His Hands\" (about spousal abuse) and \"Tattoo\" (about the Holocaust). The title track, \"Breaking Silence\", is about incest. It also includes Ian's version of \"Some People's Lives\", previously recorded as the title track of Bette Midler's 1990 album. The album was nominated for a Grammy, making it Ian's seventh nomination.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n*Janis Ian – acoustic and electric guitar, piano, vocals\n*Jim Brock – drums, percussion\n*Jim Hoke – harmonica\n*Chad Watson – bass\n*Dann Huff – electric guitar\nProduction\n*Jeff Balding – producer, lead engineer, mix engineer\n*Doug Sax – mastering\n*Lisa Powers – photography\n*Jerry Joyner – design\n*Virginia Team – art direction\nAssistants\n*Steve Bishir – assistant engineer\n*Patrick Kelly – assistant engineer, overdubs\n*Greg Parker – assistant engineer\n*John David Parker – assistant engineer\n*Christopher Rich – assistant engineer\n*Toby Seay – assistant engineer\n*Carry Summers – assistant engineer, overdubs\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
