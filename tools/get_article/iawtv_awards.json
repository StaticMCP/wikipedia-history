The poor reception of the event, and the surrounding controversy, resulted in a two-year hiatus for the Streamy Awards, and the subsequent creation of the IAWTV Awards. The two awards ceremonies are both still running, though as completely separate entities.\n2011–present\nSince its inception in 2011, the IAWTV has held award ceremonies annually (with the exception of 2016, 2019 and 2020), presenting awards to web series creators and talent in more than two dozen categories, covering multiple genres. Notable IAWTV winners include Felicia Day, Julia Stiles and Milo Ventimiglia, as well as the critically acclaimed web series The Guild, Blue, Anyone But Me, Husbands, Leap Year, and Whatever, Linda.\nBetween 2012 and 2015, the IAWTV Awards were held in Las Vegas. After a hiatus in 2016, the 2017 and 2018 ceremonies took place in Los Angeles. A further hiatus in 2019 and 2020 (with the hiatus in 2020 attributed to the global pandemic) will end with a planned virtual ceremony for the 2021 IAWTV Awards.\nAwards ceremonies\nFor the full list of winners from each ceremony, visit the [https://iawtvawards.lyberspace.com/ official IAWTV website] for archives.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"width:180px;\" |Ceremony\n! style=\"width:110px;\" |Date\n! style=\"width:80px;\" |Time\n! style=\"width:350px;\" |Best Web Series\n! style=\"width:250px;\" |Best Director\n! style=\"width:250px;\" |Best Female Performance\n! style=\"width:250px;\" |Best Male Performance\n|-\n|1st annual IAWTV Awards\n|January 12, 2012\n| rowspan=\"6\" |8:00&nbsp;p.m.\n|The Guild RCVR\n|Sean Becker – The Guild Chris Preksta – The Mercury Men\n|Felicia Day – The Guild Rachael Hip-Flores – Anyone But Me\n|Jeff Lewis – The Jeff Lewis 5-Minute Comedy Hour Daniel Bonjour – RCVR\n|-\n|2nd annual IAWTV Awards\n|January 8, 2013\n|Squaresville Leap Year\n|Sean Becker –  My Gimpy Life Tina Cesa Ward – Anyone But Me\n|Teal Sherer Teal – My Gimpy Life Julia Stiles – Blue\n|Jeff Lewis – The Jeff Lewis 5-Minute Comedy Hour  Xander Berkeley – The Booth at the End\n|-\n|3rd annual IAWTV Awards\n|January 7, 2014\n|Husbands Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome\n|Scott Brown – Destroy the Alpha Gammas  Rodrigo Garcia – Blue\n|Hannah Spear – Versus Valerie Julia Stiles – Blue\n|Brad Bell – Husbands Milo Ventimiglia – Chosen\n|-\n|4th annual IAWTV Awards\n|April 15, 2015\n|TIE: Honest Trailers & Real Housewives of Horror Whatever, Linda\n|Sean Becker – Hench Matt Eastman – Whatever, Linda\n|Zoe Chao – God Particles  Lindsey Middleton – Vanessa’s Story\n|Matthew Werkmeister – Chris & Josh Shaun Blaney – The Web Series\n|-\n|5th annual IAWTV Awards\n|October 4, 2017\n|Bruce Jade of Death\n|Tony Rogers – Bruce TIE: Erin Good – Jade of Death & Luke Eve – High Life\n|Rachel Reyes – Say Hello  Odessa Young – High Life\n|Chase Anthony – A Whole New Irving Ryan Hellquist – L.A.
