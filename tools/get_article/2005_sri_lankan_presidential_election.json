This was the 5th Presidential election held in the country's history, and the Nominations were accepted on 7 September 2005. Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa of the governing United People's Freedom Alliance was narrowly elected, defeating the United National Party's Ranil Wickremesinghe, receiving 50.29% of the vote. This was Wikcremesinghe's second of the three unsuccessful bids for the Presidency.\nPresidential term controversy\nThen-Incumbent President Chandrika Kumaratunga was constitutionally barred from running for a third term in office.\nThe 3rd Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka stated that if a President was re-elected for a second term via an Early Presidential election, his second term starts on the next date corresponding to the beginning of his first term. Therefore Chandrika Kumaratunga's second term would have started on 12 November 2000, as the last election was held on 21 December 1999. Despite this, Kumaratunga was inaugurated for a second term on 22 December 1999, just hours after the election results were declared. With that, A Controversary on when should the next Presidential election should take place raised.\nAccording to the Constitution, If her Second term started on 12 November 2000, her term would be ended on 12 November 2006, therefore the Presidential election should take place between 12 September and 12 October 2006. Since Kumaratunga was inaugurated for a second term on 22 December 1999, the public argued that the next Presidential election should take place between 22 October and 22 November 2005. Since Kumaratunga had called the 1999 election one year ahead of schedule; she argued that the extra year should be appended to her second term. She even stated that she had a secret Swearing-in ceremony on 12 November 2000 to officially start her second term in office.\nChandrika Kumaratunga sought the opinion of the Supreme Court regarding the correct date for the 2005 presidential election, following a dispute over the length of her term. The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka rejected her claims on 30 August 2005, and stated that the election should take place between 22 October and 22 November 2005, recognizing that her second term started on 22 December 1999.\nCampaign\nNominations were accepted from 9.00am to 11.00am IST, on 7 September 2005, and the Date of the election scheduled for 17 November, was announced by the Gazette Extraordinary No.1411/1, on 19 September 2005.\nPrime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa quickly emerged as the candidate for the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and Ranil Wickremesinghe for the United National Party. Both candidates tried to round up the support of minor parties. Rajapaksa needed to re-assemble the alliance with the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna that existed at the parliamentary level (the United People's Freedom Alliance). After he agreed to reject federalism and renegotiate the ceasefire with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the JVP and the Jathika Hela Urumaya endorsed him.\nAfter that, Wickremesinghe's only hope of victory was through the support of the island's ethnic minorities, given his generally more conciliatory stance on the ethnic issue. He secured the endorsement of the main Muslim party, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, and the Ceylon Workers' Congress representing the estate Tamils. He could not, however, obtain the backing of the main Sri Lankan Tamil party, the Tamil National Alliance. Any hopes for Wickremesinghe's victory were effectively dashed when the LTTE ordered Tamil voters, most of whom would likely have voted for him, to boycott the polls.\nEconomic issues also worked to Rajapaksa's favor. Sri Lanka had enjoyed strong growth under Wickremesinghe's free-market policies when he was Prime Minister from 2001 to 2004, but he had also pursued controversial privatizations which Rajapaksa promised to halt. Rajapaksa also promised a policy of economic nationalism.\nRajapaksa managed to narrowly win the election, winning 50.29% of the votes, after a heated campaign with Wickremesinghe. He was inaugurated as the 6th President of Sri Lanka at the Presidential Secretariat, Colombo, on 19 November 2005.\nResults\nBy district\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Districts won by Rajapaksa\n|-\n|Districts won by Wickremesinghe\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:100%; style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ Summary of the 2005 Sri Lankan presidential election by electoral district\n|-\n!rowspan=3|District\n!rowspan=3|Province\n!colspan=2|Rajapaksa\n!colspan=2|Wickremesinghe\n!colspan=2|Others\n!rowspan=3|Turnout\n|-\n! colspan=2 style=\"background:\"| !! colspan=2 style=\"background:\"|  !! colspan=2|\n|-\n!
