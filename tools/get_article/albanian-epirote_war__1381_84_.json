During the war, Thomas would be given the nickname \"Albanian-slayer\", due to the cruelty he displayed towards Albanian prisoners.\nPrelude\nIn 1381, Thomas, after having successfully repulsed repeated Albanian attacks, passed to the offensive. He sought assistance first from his Frankish neighbors and then turned to the Ottomans for support. The Ottomans promptly responded by dispatching an auxiliary force to aid him. In return for their help in his fight against Arta, he allowed the Ottomans to seize Dryinoupolis.\nWar\nIn 1381, Thomas II Preljubović, accompanied by Ottoman auxiliary forces, launched an invasion of the Despotate of Arta. He managed to expand his control in Dryinopolis, Velas,  Boursina, Krezounista, Dragomi and Vagenetia and most of the land previously under the control of the Malakasioi tribe. As such the Albanian pressure against Ioannina seized. The Albanians, in particular the Mazreku of the Kalamas area, held firm against him.\nOn 5 May of 1382 the Ottoman commander, Shahin Pasha, returned and captured the fortress of Revnikon, not far to the south-west of Konitsa. Thomas was then able to enforce the submission of the Zenevesaioi and the lands of the Malakassaioi up as far as Katounai.\nMeanwhile Gjin Boua Spata, perhaps being afraid that Thomas’s Ottoman allies might be turned loose on his own Despotate advanced to a place called Aroula, south of Ioannina and from there he sent forward his Italian son-in-law, Marchesano, as his ambassador and finally a marriage alliance was to be arranged. Gjin Spata was to be offered the hand in marriage of Thomas’s sister Helena, thus securing a lasting peace between the Despotates of Arta and Ioannina.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*"
