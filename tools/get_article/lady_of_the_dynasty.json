His favorite Consort Wu senses this, and selects Yuhuan as the wife of her son, Li Mao. Yuhuan marries into the imperial family, and gradually falls in love with the gentle, kindhearted Li Mao. She is distinctly unique from the other royals and consorts, due to her attraction to the arts. Yuhuan enjoys the affection of her new husband until there is a rebellion against the Crown Prince. However, the plan is revealed and Consort Wu is behind the plot. Consort Wu commits suicide in front of the Emperor and Yuhuan. After her death, Li Mao realizes that the Emperor is enamored with his wife- Yuhuan. Li Mao poisons the pregnant Yuhuan and sents her to a convent.\nEventually, the Emperor's servant Gao Lishi brings her back to the palace. Yuhuan rejects the Emperor's affections, and in anger, the Emperor announces that Yuhuan is now his new consort. With the advice of Consort Mei, Yuhuan forgives Li Mao and gives up being a nun at the convent. She reluctantly accepts the Emperor's feelings and is given the honorable title of Guifei (First rank consort). The Emperor desperately tries to gain Yuhuan's love, and he sends her gifts, such as hand picked lychees from Chang'an. He planted lychee trees in her yard, and she reciprocates his feelings. That night, the Emperor tells her about his three uncles, who were poisoned in their sleep. One of them was a previous Emperor, and as a child he suffered from nightmares.\nSoon, there are rebellions in Chang'an started by An Lushan. Li Mao returns to the Palace and the Emperor gives him a sword as an apology for what he did to Yuhuan. Father and son forgive each other for their respective actions, and Li Mao fights against An Lushan's army. However, Li Mao is killed in battle, and the major city Luoyang has been captured. Consort Mei also committed suicide by diving into a well. The Emperor and Yuhuan were forced to flee from Chang'an but he swore he would let her be safe. The Emperor's army had blamed the rebellions on Yuhuan's cousin Yang Guozhong who's also a corrupt official. The army wants Yuhuan to die or else they will rebel. Even though Yang Guozhong is executed, the army wants the whole Yang family to perish despite the Emperor's refusal. Yuhuan, who overheard this, decided to persuade the army to not rebel. After having intercourse with the Emperor one last time, Yuhuan consumes poison and strangles herself.\nCast\n*Fan Bingbing as Yang Guifei\n*Leon Lai as Emperor Xuanzong of Tang\n*Wu Chun as Li Mao, Prince of Shou\n*Joan Chen as Consort Wu\n*Wu Gang as Gao Lishi\n*Ning Jing as Consort Mei\n*Jin Hao\n*Chen Baoguo\n*Wen Zhang as General\n*Qin Yi\n*Tu Honggang\n*Wu Yue\n*Christian Frix as Ren Tao\nProduction\nIn March 2009, Yang Guifei officially announced, then the production companies included a British company.
