It is a member of the Milton Keynes Heritage Association and the Association of Independent Museums.\nHistory\nFollowing an Act of Parliament passed on 30 June 1747 (21 George 2 c.12, known as Lord Cobham's Act), the original prison building was erected in 1748. The bulk of funding was from Richard Temple, fourth baronet of Stowe (1675–1749), who had been previously MP for Buckingham.\nIt was built in the Gothic style.\nOne of the prisoners jailed here was the prize fighter Simon Byrne. He was tried at the Buckingham Assizes in 1830 for the manslaughter of another prize fighter, Alexander M'Kay.\nThe rounded front of the building was added in 1839, designed by George Gilbert Scott, a local architect. This provided accommodation for the jailer and became known as the Keeper's Lodge.\nFor around 60 years, the Old Gaol acted as the police station for Buckingham, until a new police station was built a short distance away on Moreton Road. In 1891 it became a fire station, and the C Company of the 1st Bucks Rifles rented part of the building for their armoury from 1892 until 1926. In 1907, public toilets were installed.\nIn the 1950s, it became an antiques shop and café. In 1974, the Aylesbury Vale District Council took over responsibility for the building. Buckingham Heritage Trust was formed in 1985 to save the building and it opened as a museum in 1993, together with a tourist information centre. The Old Gaol Museum obtained finance from the Heritage Lottery Fund to add a glass roof over the original prisoners' exercise yard in 2000.\nMuseum\nThe museum is open to the public and tells the story of Buckingham and rural life, including the Flora Thompson Collection (author of Lark Rise to Candleford) and Buckinghamshire Military Trust exhibits. A number of the original cells form part of the museum exhibits.\nThe Buckinghamshire Military Museum Trust is based at the museum, and houses its collections there. In addition to arms, regalia, and other military memorabilia, the Buckinghamshire Military Museum Trust also holds a small collection of military musical instruments, including early examples of rope-tensioned side drums.\nGallery\nImage:Buckingham OldCountyGaol01.JPG|Rear view of the Old Gaol.\nImage:Buckingham OldCountyGaol03.JPG|Cells in the jail.\nImage:Buckingham OldCountyGaol04.JPG|Cell door in the jail.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.visitbuckinghamshire.org/attraction/buckingham-old-gaol Visit Buckinghamshire listing]\n* [http://www.visitsoutheastengland.com/site/things-to-do/buckingham-old-gaol-museum-p56243 The Beautiful South information]"
