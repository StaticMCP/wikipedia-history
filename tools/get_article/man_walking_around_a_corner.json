It was taken on the corner of Rue Bochart-de-Saron and Avenue Trudaine in the 9th arrondissement of Paris. Pictures from the film were sent in a letter dated 18 August 1887 to his wife. According to David Wilkinson's 2015 documentary The First Film indeed, the work is not a film, but a series of photographs, 16 in total, each taken from one of the 16 lenses from Le Prince's camera. Le Prince went on to develop the one-lens camera, and on 14 October 1888 he finally made the world's first moving image. The total result of the work lasts less than two seconds.\nSee also\n* 1887 in film\n* Brighton School (filmmaking)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n\n---\n\n## Man Walking Around A Corner\n\n#REDIRECT Man Walking Around a Corner"
