Howard played in one game for the St. Louis Cardinals on April 18, 1918.\nHe began his professional career with the Gettysburg Patriots of the Blue Ridge League in 1915.  Undoubtedly his best season in the minor leagues came during the 1917 season with the Hagerstown Terriers, also of the Blue Ridge League.  He pitched 266 innings while accumulating a record of 25 wins and 10 losses.  He accumulated 166 strikeouts, 8 shutouts, and an earned run average of 1.39, all season highs for the 1917 Blue Ridge League.  His 25 wins tied the all-time seasonal mark for the Blue Ridge League.  His pitching was a key component to Hagerstown's capture of the league title that year.\nAfter his one-game appearance in the majors, the collapse of the Blue Ridge League in 1918 force Howard to move to Milwaukee to play baseball.  He played in Milwaukee for parts of four seasons.  His spent the last two seasons of his professional career with the Newark Bears of the International League in 1927 and 1928.\nReferences\nExternal links\nFurther reading\n*Johnson, Lloyd and Wolff, Miles, editors: Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball.
