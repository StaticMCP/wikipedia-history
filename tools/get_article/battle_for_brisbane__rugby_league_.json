The first meeting at Brisbane's ANZ Stadium came on the night the Super League war broke out in 1995. The long-awaited clash between Brisbane's two teams ended up a bit of a non-event, with the Broncos having a glut of possession to race out to an early 12–0 lead, extending it further in the second half. The Crushers lack of penetration in attack was their ultimate downfall, as they were held scoreless in just their fourth competition fixture.\nThe second match between the teams came over a year later in the 1996 ARL season, with the Broncos again winners, in front of a then competition record crowd of 34,263 at Suncorp Stadium. The Crushers would take an 8–6 lead into halftime, before the Broncos overwhelmed the Crushers in the final ten minutes with three tries.\nDue to the split caused by the Super League war, the two teams would not meet again before the Crushers' ultimate demise in December 1997.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"  text-align:center;\" width=100%\n|-\n!width=2%|Game\n!width=25%|Home\n!width=4%|Score\n!width=25%|Away\n!width=14%|Date\n!width=20%|Venue\n!width=10%|Crowd\n|-\n|1\n|align=left |  Brisbane Broncos\n|32–0\n|align=left |  South Queensland Crushers\n|\n|QE II\n|49,607\n|-\n|2\n|align=left |  South Queensland Crushers\n|8–28\n|align=left |  Brisbane Broncos\n|\n|Lang Park\n|34,263\n|-\n|}\nBroncos vs Dolphins\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center; background:#f5faff;\"  style=\"background:#c1d8ff;\"\n!
