The war began when the Banten Sultanate attacked Batavia, the capital city of the Dutch East Indies in present-day Indonesia. The war ended with numerous victories on the Banten side. The Dutch suffered heavy losses, with many of their strategic lodges destroyed and their gold and weapons seized.\nBackground\nThe Dutch conquered the Banten city of Jayakarta on 29 May 1619. On 30 May, the Dutch began rebuilding the city, renaming it \"Batavia\".\nWhen Ageng Tirtayasa of Banten was crowned Sultan of Banten in 1651, he worked to modernize the state and strengthen relations with the Danish East Indies and the Cirebon Sultanate. He also started to build irrigation at Pontang for the supplies of his forces in the ambush of Dutch ships.\nSultan Ageng opposed the VOC's goal of ruling the north coast of Java and blockade Chinese and Persian traders coming to Java, limiting the trade activity of the Banten Sultanate. To prevent the VOC from achieving economic dominance in the region, Sultan Ageng declared war on the Dutch.\nAction at Angke-Tangerang\nIn 1655, Bantenese forces ambushed VOC ships that sailed in Angke-Tangerang. The forces also infiltrated and attacked the VOC's sugarcane factory. In the aftermath of the attacks, the VOC closed their office and lodges and the Bantenese prepared their forces to launch further military action upon the VOC.\nWar\nSack on Batavia (1656)\nIn 1656, Bantenese forces launched action on Batavia, engaging in substantial robbery and rapture, mass killings of the civilians and VOC officials, burning, plundering, and attacking many VOC farms. Banten troops ambushed VOC troops who were conducting night patrols and killed their commander. The Banten forces hijacked VOC ships when they sailed into Batavia from Malacca City, however, the VOC was worried by the Banten forces after massive damage on Batavia.\nBattle of Angke\nTo distract the VOC, the troops led by Ngabehi and Prayakarti got a mission to attack the villages and burn much of their sugarcane. Another troop, led by Senopati, moved into the enemy positions and encircled them with Demang Narapraksa and Demang Wirapraksa, who silently infiltrated the VOC positions and slowly started the sieges.\nThe forces led by Ngabehi and Prayakarti were silently successful in burning and attacking numerous villages and sugarcane fields. The forces led by Senopati moved to the east and slowly encircled the VOC forces, making sure VOC movement was slowed.\nThe forces led by Narapaksa and Wirapaksa attacked the VOC forces and inflicted heavy losses. While the Banten forces were successful, Bantenese commander Prayakarti was killed in the action.\nBattle of Pontang\nPrince Bagus and his forces launched naval actions at Pontang, aiming to ambush the VOC ships by hiding between Dua islands. When the VOC fleets came into the islands, the Banten forces launched their attacks and easily defeated the VOC fleets, capturing many of their weapons.\nBalukbuk incidents\nThe Sarantaka and Sacantaka fleets placed many traps to destroy VOC junks in Balukbuk. When the VOC ships came into Balukbuk, the Banten unexpectedly attacked and stormed the junks. The VOC fleets and troops were trapped by this attack. In the end, many of the VOC forces were massacred in their ships by the Banten forces.\nAmbush on Tanjung Barangrang\nPrince Bagus and his forces also launched naval action at Tanjung Barangrang to defeat the VOC junks from Malacca. Prince Bagus and his forces easily defeated the VOC fleets and most of the VOC crews were massacred or captured by Bantenese forces.\nAmbush on Gosong Busang\nKyai Haji Abbas troops conducted naval attacks at Gosong Busang, aiming to defeat the VOC junks. The forces were also able to capture most of their weapons and their flag, as well as treasure and canons.\nBattle of Karawang\nThe forces led by Rangga Natajiwa and Wirapana successfully defeated the VOC forces at Karawang. These forces also stormed many of the VOC outposts, causing the VOC to retreat in other places.\nAmbush on Port Ratu\nThe forces led by Saranurbaya launched naval actions at Port Ratu and successfully defeated the VOC fleets. The ambush affected the economy of the VOC, but Saranurbaya suffered heavy wounds and died five days later.\nSiege of Surosowan\nOn the Gulf of Banten, in the front of Surosowan town, the 11 warships of the VOC came and started to besiege the Banten forces from the Lima islands to the Dua islands. In Surosowan, the Banten forces with their strong cannon troops started to fire on many VOC ships, and thus occurred the major naval actions.\nA few of the Banten cannons were hitting their targets and causing heavy damage, such as Si Jaka Pekik and Si Muntab. The Si Kalantaka had success in shelling and putting fire to the VOC ships. Many of the VOC ships retreated because of the heavy losses and damage.\nBattle of Tangerang\nThe next day, the forces led by Arya Mangunjaya were marched from Surosowan to Tangerang, along with many wounded soldiers, POW, and many Dutch weapons and cannons which were captured by Banten forces. The battle continued in the following days, many of the troops on both sides were heavily wounded and retreated to their bases.\nWith the bravery of Arya Mangunjaya, his forces continued the attacks and penetrated the VOC troops into the border in the West Batavia. Many of the VOC officials and the military staff of Batavia retreated because of the attacks and the Banten forces successfully captured West Batavia.\nAftermath\nAt the end of war, VOC suffered humiliating and heavy losses. To end the conflict, the VOC decided to offer a peace agreement to Ageng Tirtayasa of Banten, but Sultan Ageng refused to make peace with the VOC. To persuade the Sultans to make peace with the VOC, they called the Sultan of Jambi (an ally of Banten) to help the VOC. Sultan Jambi agreed to the VOC and giving their ambassadors to Banten, and with that, the Sultan Ageng finally agreed to make peace with the VOC and ended the war.\nReferences\nCitations\n*\n*\n*"
