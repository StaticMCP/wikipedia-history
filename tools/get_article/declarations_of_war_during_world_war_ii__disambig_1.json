The declaration is usually the act of delivering a performative speech or the presentation of a signed document by an authorized party of a national government in order to create a state of war between two or more sovereign states. The official international protocol for declaring war was defined in The Hague Peace Conference of 1907 (or Hague II). For the diplomatic maneuvering behind these events, which led to hostilities between nations during World War II, see Diplomatic history of World War II.\nList of war declarations\nBelow is a table showing the outbreak of wars between nations which occurred during World War II. Indicated are the dates (during the immediate build-up to, or during the course of, World War II), from which a de facto state of war existed between nations. The table shows both the \"Initiator Nation(s)\" and the nation at which the aggression was aimed, or \"Targeted Nation(s)\". Events listed include those in which there were simple diplomatic breaking of relations that did not involve any physical attack, as well as those involving overt declarations or acts of aggression. In rare cases, war between two nations occurred twice, with an intermittent period of peace. The list here does not include peace treaties or periods of any armistice.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|colspan=2| Key to type (fourth column):\n|-\n|style=text-align:center| A || Attack without prior, formal declaration of war;\n|-\n|style=text-align:center| C || Declaration and/or attack without standard, formal procedure, sometimes preceded by a casus belli thus fait accompli;\n|-\n|style=text-align:center| U || State of war arrived at through use of ultimatum;\n|-\n|style=text-align:center| W || Formal declaration of war made.\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n|+Outbreaks of war between nations during World War II\n|-\n!Date!!Initiator nation(s)!!Targeted nation(s)!!Type!!Notes/comments!!Document/event\n|-\n|1939-09-01 ||  Germany ||  Poland || A || German attack began at 4:44 a.m., Berlin and Warsaw time.

Tonga was not a British dominion, instead, as part of the British Commonwealth (a protected state of the UK and the British Empire) declared war separately, alongside Britain (since it administers their foreign affairs). || British declaration\n|-\n|1939-09-03 ||  France Morocco Tunisia ||  Germany || U || The French ultimatum to Germany expired a few hours after the British ultimatum, at 17:00. || French declaration\n|-\n|1939-09-04 ||  Nepal ||  Germany || W || || Declaration\n|-\n|1939-09-06 ||  South Africa ||  Germany || W || || Declaration\n|-\n|1939-09-10 ||  Bahrain Oman ||  Germany || W || Canada's declaration several days after that of the United Kingdom is seen as a watershed moment in Canadian home rule and sovereignty.As for Bahrain, given its status as a protected state of the United Kingdom, it was technically at war as of Britain's declaration, this is an acknowledgement of the declaration of war by Britain (due to coercion by an advisor),Oman, under British influence, is coerced to participate in the war effort. || Bahrainian declarationCanadian declarationMuscatian and Omanian declaration\n|-\n|1939-09-17 ||  ||  Poland || A || || Invasion\n|-\n|1939-11-09 ||  Kuwait ||  Germany || W || || Declaration\n|-\n|1939-11-30 ||  ||  || A || || Invasion\n|-\n|1940-04-09 ||  Germany ||  || A || || Invasion of DenmarkInvasion of Norway\n|-\n|1940-04-12 ||  United Kingdom ||  || A || || Invasion\n|-\n|1940-05-10 ||  Germany ||  || A/W || Date of the German offensive in the West, W from Belgium, Luxemburg and the Netherlands. || BelgiumLuxembourgNetherlands\n|-\n|1940-05-10 ||  ||  Iceland || A || || Invasion\n|-\n|1940-06-10 ||  Italy ||  France || W || || Declaration\n|-\n|1940-06-10 ||  ||  Italy || W || || Declaration\n|-\n|1940-06-11 ||  South Africa France ||  Italy || W || || South African declarationAustralian declarationNew Zealand's declarationFrench declaration\n|-\n|1940-07-03 ||  ||  Vichy France || A || Vichy France cuts off diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom on 8 July 1940. || Attack\n|-\n|1940-09-09 ||  Italy ||  Egypt || A || Egypt never formally declared war on Italy. || Invasion\n|-\n|1940-09-22 ||  ||  Vichy France || A || Japanese troops occupy French Indochina. || Invasion\n|-\n|1940-09-23 ||  Free France ||  Vichy France || A || || Invasion\n|-\n|1940-10-?? ||  ||  Vichy France || A || || Franco-Thai War\n|-\n|1940-10-28 ||  ||  Greece || U || Italy invades Greece. || Invasion\n|-\n|1940-10-27 ||  Free France ||  Vichy France || A || Free French Equatorial Africa invades Vichy French Gabon. || Invasion\n|-\n|1940-11-23 ||  Belgium (in-exile) ||  || W || || Declaration\n|-\n|1941-02-05 ||  Free France ||  Italy || A || || Invasion\n|-\n|1941-04-06 ||  Germany ||  Greece || W || || Invasion\n|-\n|1941-04-06 ||  Germany Italy ||  Yugoslavia || A || || Invasion\n|-\n|1941-04-07 ||  Yugoslavia ||  Hungary || A || After the German invasion, bombing of Hungarian locations. || Invasion\n|-\n|1941-04-14 ||  Germany ||  Egypt || A || Egypt did not formally declare war until 1945. || Invasion\n|-\n|1941-05-02 ||  United Kingdom ||  Iraq || A || || Invasion\n|-\n|1941-06-08 ||  Free France ||  Germany || A ||  || Invasion\n|-\n|1941-06-22 ||  Germany Italy ||  || W || A timed declaration of war was given by Germany at the time of the attack. || Invasion\n|-\n|1941-06-22/24 ||  Romania ||  || A || On June 22, Romanian leader Ion Antonescu declared a \"holy war\" to reclaim ancestral lands and against Bolshevism in an appeal to the nation.
