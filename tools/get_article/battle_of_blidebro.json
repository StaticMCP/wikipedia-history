The battle ended in a Danish–German victory and it is estimated that 350 Swedes were killed in the initial action.\nBackground\nIn 1340, Valdemar IV of Denmark became king of a Denmark that was mortgaged to foreign powers, and Valdemar now set about to reunite Denmark.\nThe following year, 1341, Copenhagen and its surrounding areas were sold to Valdemar's enemy, Magnus Eriksson of Sweden, for 7,000 silver marks. In early Summer of 1342, Valdemar began besieging the Swedish fortification, however, the besieged enjoyed reinforcements of boats and manpower from both Magnus Eriksson and the German count, Markvard Stove.\nBattle\nHowever, now the knight, Frederick of Lochen, together with ships from the Hanseatic League, tried his luck in attacking the Swedish and Holstenian reinforcements at Blidebro on 26 June 1342. It became a bloody and tough battle. The battle ended in a complete Danish victory and the first major victory for Valdemar IV. Of the Swedish troops, it is said that 350 were left on the battlefield, including many chieftains, while the rest of the force deserted or fled to Vordingborg.\nAftermath\nBecause of his complete victory, Frederick of Lochen did not dare to stay in Denmark and left for Germany with gifts. However, this cannot have been immediately after the battle, since he is mentioned being in Kalundborg on 10 August 1342.\nPlace\nIt seems that the battle started at Refshalegrunden (near present-day Trekroner Fort) and thereafter drawn to the water between Zealand and Amager. However, it is uncertain weather the battle took place at land or at sea.\nLegacy\nThe battle is later remembered in Copenhagen's Church of Our Lady's obituary as the Battle of Blidebro.\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*\n*"
