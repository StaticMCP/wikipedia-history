Nowadays, the museum is managed by the Ocalić od Zapomnienia (Save from Forgetting) foundation. The charity collects exhibits in the field of paper making, printing and bookbinding history.\nAmong the museum pieces, there can be found such exhibits as a  shearing paper cutter, tools for punching, a bathtub for paper making or metal as well as timber sorts of typesetting and a type-setter cabinet. Besides, visitors have a chance to see a collection of book bindings, ex libris, and woodcuts by Zygfryd Gardzielski as well as the whole  book production cycle. The collection was created on the basis of Ryszrd Uljanski's collections.\nIn its current localization, the museum has existed since 19 November 2007.\nIn the ‘Paper Maker’s House’ (building no 7), which is located in the area of the Łódź Wooden Architecture Skansen, there are two workshops established: a workshop of paper making and typography.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://papiernictwohistoryczne.pl/muzeum/ Homepage]"
