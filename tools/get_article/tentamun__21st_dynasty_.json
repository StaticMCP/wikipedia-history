      "text": "# Tentamun (21st dynasty)\n\nTentamun (\"she of Amun\") was an ancient Egyptian queen. She is likely to have been the daughter of Ramesses IX, the third last ruler of the 20th Dynasty. Her mother may have been another Tentamun, who was the mother of Ramesses's other daughter, Duathathor-Henttawy.\nIn the Story of Wenamun she is mentioned together with a Nesubanebded as residing in Tanis. Both are described as \"organizers of the land\". From this it is surmised that she was the wife of king Smendes, the first king of the 21st Dynasty.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Aidan Dodson & Dyan Hilton: The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt.
