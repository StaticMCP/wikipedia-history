      "text": "# Jinggouzi culture\n\nThe Jinggouzi culture was a culture of Inner Mongolia and Greater Chifeng area, from 1300 BCE to 1000 BCE. It succeeded the Upper Xiajiadian culture, and preceded the establishment of the Yan territory by the Han dynasty.\nAncient samples of the Jinggouzi site situated to the northwest of the Liao civilization were assigned to Haplogroup C-M217. Northern nomads from Jinggouzi might have entered the West Liao River valley, but these Jinggouzi people (closely related to Xianbei and Oroqen) were culturally and genetically distinct from the original people of the West Liao River valley, who carried the characteristic Haplogroup N-M231 lineage. The Jinggouzi people may have been associated with the Donghu.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*"
