The plant of this variety flowers freely and the blooms are white and have yellow centres. The dry matter content of this variety is high and the texture is light and floury. This variety is said to be one of the best for mashing.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## British queen potato\n\n#REDIRECT British Queen potato"
