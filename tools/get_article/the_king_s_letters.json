Up to this point, the  Joseon dynastic kingdom has been using Chinese characters.\nSejong calls upon a Buddhist monk, Shinmi, and his fellow monks to develop a new alphabet. The monks have unique insights due to their knowledge of Sanskrit and other languages that use phonetic writing systems. Sejong promises to build a Buddhist temple if the monks accomplish the task. Queen Soheon is secretly a Buddhist and welcomes the monks to the palace. Due to the tensions between Buddhists and the dominant Confucians, the servants are sworn to secrecy and the monks are disguised as court eunuchs.\nThe difficult project worsens Sejong's fragile health, as he suffers from diabetes. He loses sight in his right eye and is urged by his doctors to avoid stress. The king relocates to a health spa in the mountains. In the remote location, he simultaneously receives eye treatments and the monks continue to work in total secrecy. They soon complete the writing system, now known as the Hangul or Chosŏn'gŭl.\nThe king returns to the palace and contends with the power struggle between Buddhists and Confucians. Both groups want credit for the writing system's creation within a published manual. The Buddhists expect Sejong to hold up his end of their deal. The Confucians are desperate to keep their power and remain on good terms with China. The king gives in to the Confucians and sends the Buddhist monks away.\nIn order to reunite the Sejong and Shinmi, the queen starves herself to death. Sejong is grief-stricken and decides to fulfill his wife's final wishes. Shinmi is recalled to the royal palace and there is a reconciliation. The king builds the promised Buddhist temple and Shinmi leads a funeral for the late Queen Soheon.\nKing Sejong notes he has been king for thirty years and will leave only one book as his legacy. Shinmi replies with an allegory that suggests Sejong's one book will have an incalculable effect upon Korean society.\nCast\n*Song Kang-ho as King Sejong the Great\n*Park Hae-il as Buddhist monk Shinmi\n*Jeon Mi-seon as Queen Soheon\n*Choi Deok-moon as Jung In-ji\n*Nam Moon-chul as Choe Man-ri\n*Jung Hae-kyun as Go Yak-hae\n*Jung In-kyum as Kim Moon\n*Kim Joon-hak as King Munjong\n*Cha Rae-hyung as Grand Prince Suyang\n*Yoon Jung-il as\n*Tang Jun-sang as Hak-jo\n*Keum Sae-rok as Lee Jin-ah\n*Im Sung-jae as Hak-yul\n*Oh Hyun-kyung as Noh-seung\n*Park Dong-hyuk as Jung Chang-son\n*Song Sang-eun as Pyung-nyu\nSee also\n*Forbidden Dream\n*Hunminjeongeum\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*"
