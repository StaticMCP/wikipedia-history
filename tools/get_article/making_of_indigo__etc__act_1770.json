Many acts of parliament, however, contained time-limited sunset clauses, requiring legislation to revive enactments that had expired or to continue enactments that would otherwise expire.\nProvisions\nContinued enactments\nSection 1 of the act continued the Importation of Indigo Act 1747 (21 Geo. 2. c. 30), as continued by the Making of Indigo Act 1755 (28 Geo. 2. c. 25) and as amended and continued by the Continuance etc. of Acts Act 1763 (3 Geo. 3. c. 25), from the expiration of the act until the end of the next session of parliament after 25 March 1777.\nSection 2 of the act extended the provisions of the Importation (No. 3) Act 1765 (5 Geo. 3. c. 10), providing that until the end of the next session of parliament after 2 years from 1 August 1770, every collector, comptroller, and other officer of his Majesty's customs in the British colonies shall be entitled to demand and receive fees as were generally and usually accustomed to be demanded before the 29 September 1764, with penalties for exacting greater fees including forfeiture of fifty pounds (one moiety to his Majesty and the other to the prosecutor) and incapacity of executing any office in the customs or navy for the first offence, and for the second offence, forfeiture of place or office and incapacity of employment in customs or navy.\nSubsequent developments\nSo much of the act as relates to the Importation (No. 3) Act 1765 (5 Geo. 3. c. 10) was continued from the expiration of the enactment until the end of the next session of parliament after 1 August 1774 by section 6 of the Continuance of Certain Laws Act 1772 (12 Geo. 3. c. 56).\nSo much of the act \"as relates to the regulating the Fees of the Officers of the Customs in America, and for extending the same to the Naval Officers there\", was continued from the expiration of that enactment to the end of the next session of parliament after 29 September 1778 by section 12 of the Continuance of Laws, etc. Act 1774 (14 Geo. 3. c. 86).\nSo much of the act \"as relates to the regulating the Fees of the Officers of the Customs in America, and for extending the same to the Naval Officers there\", was continued from the expiration of that enactment to the end of the next session of parliament after 1 August 1782 by section 5 of the Continuance of Laws Act 1779 (19 Geo. 3. c. 22).\nSo much of the act \"as relates to the regulating the Fees of the Officers of the Customs in America, and for extending the same to the Naval Officers there\", was continued from the expiration of that enactment to the end of the next session of parliament after 1 August 1786 by section 1 of the Continuance of Laws Act 1783 (23 Geo. 3. c. 6).\nThe whole act was repealed by section 1 of, and the schedule to, the Statute Law Revision Act 1867 (30 & 31 Vict. c. 59).\nNotes\nReferences"
