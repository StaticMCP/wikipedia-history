The Labor government was re-elected to its third term in office, having been in power since the 1915 election. It was Ted Theodore's first election as premier, following his election in 1919 to succeed T. J. Ryan as Labor leader.\nDuring the previous term, the Queensland Country Party, had re-emerged from the National bloc, taking half of the Country Party's parliamentary seats with it. A Labor member, Alfred James, switched to the party, and the Maranoa by-election in 1919 saw them gain a seat at the expense of Labor. An additional party, the Northern Country Party, also formed during this time to represent the interests of North Queensland farmers and canegrowers. To avoid three-cornered contests with Labor, the three parties agreed upon a division of seats between themselves.\nKey dates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Date\n!
