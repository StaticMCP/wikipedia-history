In 1894 and 1895, Toledo teams played exclusively as members of the Class A (highest minor league level) Western League. Toledo was known as the \"Swamp Angels\" in 1895, before the team relocated as the result of Blue laws. The Western League evolved to become today's American League in 1901. The team hosted minor league home games at both Whitestocking Park and Ewing Street Park.\nHistory\nMinor league baseball began in Toledo with the 1883 Toledo Blue Stockings, who played the season as members of the Northwestern League, before becoming a major league franchise in the American Association in 1884. The White Stockings were immediately preceded in minor league play by the 1892 Toledo Black Pirates, who played the season in Western League.\nIn 1894, the Toledo \"White Stockings\" became a member of the reformed eight-team Class A level Western League. After not playing in 1893, the Western League was reformed in 1894 under new league president Ban Johnson and under Johnson it evolved to become today's American League in 1901. In 1894, Toledo was joined by the Detroit Creams, Grand Rapids Rippers, Indianapolis Hoosiers Kansas City Cowboys, Milwaukee Brewers, Minneapolis Millers and Sioux City Cornhuskers in league play. The Toledo franchise was owned and managed by Denny Long.\nIn their first season of play, the 1894 Toledo White Stockings placed second in the 1894 Western League, which had no playoffs in the era. Playing under owner/manager Denny Long, Toledo ended the season with a 67–55 record and finished 5.5 games behind the first place Sioux City Cornhuskers in the final Western League standings.\nIn 1895, the Toledo Swamp Angels continued play in the Western League, before the franchise relocated during the season. Some references have the team continuing under the \"White Stockings\" nickname in 1895.\nDuring the 1895 season, Common Pleas Court Judge Charles Pratt issued a temporary restraining order before the first scheduled Sunday game prohibiting the White Stockings from playing baseball on Sunday. The injunction was later made permanent. No Sunday games had been scheduled by Toledo in 1894, but there were Sunday games scheduled in 1895. The Toledo franchise relocated during the season as a result.\nOn June 30, 1895, Toledo had a 23–28 record when the team relocated to become the Terre Haute Hottentots. Toledo had blue laws in the era, which prohibited work on Sundays. As a result, ownership was forced to seek alternatives for games scheduled on Sundays after the blue laws were supported by the court action prohibiting Toledo from playing Sunday professional baseball games. The loss of potential revenue forced the team moved to Terre Haute. The Toledo/Terre Haute team finished seventh in the standings, playing the season under managers Denny Long and William Schneider. The combined team ended the season with a final record of 52–72 and finished 27.0 games behind the first place Indianapolis Hoosiers in the final standings.\nNotably, Toledo player Bob Gilks had six hits in a game in both the 1894 and 1895 seasons.\nIn 1896, Toledo resumed minor league play, as the Toledo Mud Hens began play as members of the Interstate League. The \"Mud Hens\" continue minor league play today.\nThe ballpark\nThe Toledo White Stockings played minor league home games at Whitestocking Park. The ballpark was located on LaGrange Street between Hudson Street & Pearl Street.\nToledo was noted to have played select home minor league games at Ewing Street Park. Ewing Street Park was located near the abandoned Olympic Park, which had hosted the Toledo Black Sox in 1892. Ewing street Park was noted to have twice the capacity of Whitestocking Park. Ewing Park was located on Ewing Street between Dorr Street & Pinewood Avenue.\nTimeline\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size: 95%;\"\n! Year(s) !! # Yrs.  !! Team !! Level !!
