Led by the late Carol Shields, a group of respected BC writers met with the current Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia, the Honourable Iona Campagnolo to initiate a special provincial literary arts award. Inspired by Shields, this meeting resulted in the establishment of the Lieutenant Governor’s Award for Literary Excellence.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+Award winners\n!Year\n!Winner\n!Ref.\n|-\n|2004\n|\n|\n|-\n|2005\n|\n|\n|-\n|2006\n|\n|\n|-\n|2007\n|\n|\n|-\n|2008\n|\n|\n|-\n|2009\n|\n|\n|-\n|2010\n|\n|\n|-\n|2011\n|\n|\n|-\n|2012\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2013\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|2014\n|\n|\n|-\n|2015\n|\n|\n|-\n|2016\n|\n|\n|-\n|2017\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2020\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|2021\n|\n|\n|-\n|2022\n|\n|\n|-\n|2023\n|\n|\n|-\n|2024\n|Keith Maillard\n|\n|}\nReferences\nSources\n*[http://www.bcbookprizes.ca/about/details/lieutenant-governors-award-for-literary-excellence Lieutenant Governor's Award for Literary Excellence] , official website\n*[http://www.bcbookprizes.ca/index.php BC Book Prizes]"
