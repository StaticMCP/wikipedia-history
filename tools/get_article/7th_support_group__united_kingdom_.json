The pivot group, and later the support group, controlled the division's motorised infantry, field artillery, anti-tank guns, and light anti-aircraft guns. While the artillery would provide support for the tanks on an attack, the infantry were intended to protect the division's base or occupy territory captured by the tanks and not supplement them. Towards the end of Operation Crusader, the support group joined the 1st Armoured Division for a couple of weeks before reverting to the command of the 7th Armoured Division. The 7th Support Group was abolished in February 1942, after Crusader came to an end, following a reorganization of the British armoured forces in North Africa.\nCommanders\n* Lieutenant-Colonel E. S. B. Williams (acting), from 22 January 1940\n* Brigadier William Gott - initially the acting commander from 31 January 1940. Gott was then promoted from Lieutenant-Colonel to Brigadier, to officially become the formation's commander from 16 February 1940.\n* Brigadier John Campbell - Took command on 12 September 1941.
