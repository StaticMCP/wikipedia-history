Dissatisfied with his father's decision Muhammad Shah arrived at the Dogra camp at Suru, during Zorwar Singh's Ladakh campaign and sought help from him against his father. Muhammed Shah was provided refuge and was placed under the protection of Maharaja.\nInvasion\nIn the year 1840, Zorawar Singh gathered an army of 15,000 for his Baltistan campaign. Ahmed Shah was joined by Baltis and discontented Ladakhis, and destroyed the bridge over Indus river that connected Baltistan to the Dogra territory. Zorawar Singh moved downwards the riverbank for 25 days capturing Khatakchau and Khapolor. Mian Nidhan Singh was dispatched into Baltistan with 5,000 men to collect resources by raiding towns. Nidhan Singh and his men were surrounded by thousands of Baltis and Ladakhis when they advanced 15 miles into the Balti territory. Mian Nidhan Singh was killed and only 400 soldiers returned back to the camp.\nZorawar Singh fell into delusion whether to retreat back or continue his invasion and remained at the bank of Indus ahe couldn't cross indus with such a large army. One night Mehta Basti Ram along with some men cut down trees and built a temporary bridge over icy Indus. While the Dogras were crossing Indus, a group of Baltis under Ghulam Hussian and Wazir Sultan Beg attacked them at Wanko pass. After a fierce battle Ghulam Hussain was killed and Wazir Sultan beg retreated with casualties of 2000 men dead and 1000 wounded, while dogras lost 250 men and 150 wounded. Zorawar Singh awarded Mehta Basti Ram with 500 Rupees uand a air of gold bangles. He awarded the soldiers ranging from 40 to 100 rupees based on their contribution.\nZorawar Singh chased the retreating Baltis for 9 miles and slaughtered them along with Sultan Beg at Thano Kun. He encamped at Marwan to reorganize his troops and plan his next move. Zorawar Singh advanced to Skardu and laid a siege on the fort of Skardu. Zorawar Singh built a fort next to Skardu fort and named it 'Dogra fort' to get shelter in nights. After fifteen days of firing Ahmed Shah surrender the fort to Zorawar Singh.\nNext Zorawar Singh sent Wazir Lakhapat Rai to conquer Dardistan, where he laid a siege on the fort of Astore and prisoned the Dard Raja.\nAftermath\nAhmed Shah and his son Muhammad Ali were taken prisoners and Muhammed Shah was coronated as the Raja of Skardu under Dogra suizerty. Muhammad Shah promised to pay 7,000 rupees as annual tribute to Dogras.\nSee also\n* Dogra invasion of Ladakh\nReferences"
