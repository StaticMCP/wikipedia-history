K. Prakash and starring Jayasurya, Kunchacko Boban and Indrajith Sukumaran in lead title roles, alongside Samvrutha Sunil, Sandhya, Ann Augustine, Jagathy Sreekumar, Suraj Venjaramoodu and Salim Kumar in supporting roles. In the film, three estranged brothers, who are also princes in a royal family, set out on a journey in search of a treasure. However, a mysterious revelation sorts out all the conflict between them.\nPlot\nShankar alias Shanku, Ram and Bhaskar alias Bhasi are three cousins from a royal family who always fought with each other since childhood. None of them allows others to prosper and creates trouble for each other in whatever they do. Their parents have taken money from a money lender called Dinakaran who has given the money on the lease of the palace. When the debts increase, the three realise that they cannot repay the money and get back to the palace. So they try to steal the papers from Dinakaran's house with the help of his daughters, who are their girlfriends. But Dinakaran catches them and hands them over to the police.\nIn the police lockup, they happen to hear from a blind man that there is a treasure hidden somewhere in Naga Halli, Mysore forest which belonged to their family. He says that this was hidden by Tipu Sultan centuries back. He can help them if they promise to give him a portion of it. But that night, his illness becomes worse and he dies on his way to the hospital, but he hands the three a map of the treasure before he leaves the cell.\nThe three kings leave for Mysore to find the treasure. Each of them takes a different route and tries to be there first and make the treasure their own, but ultimately they have to join hands because each of them has only one portion of the map which they split while having a fight in the police lockup. Finally, they find the treasure but it turns out that everything was a forged play and they were part of a reality show which a popular channel organized. They all end up humiliated because cameras were following them every moment and caught all their fights on camera and broadcast them.\nBut during one of the fights they had inside the cave, it turns out that the three kings misplaced the gold idol kept by the channel and took the real golden idol itself. This makes them all rich and they take back the palace from the money lender. The three kings marry their girlfriends and they have three children. In the final scene, it is shown that their three children are fighting each other just as fathers once did, showing that the legacy continues.\nCast\n* Sandhya as Manju, Bhasi's girlfriend\n* Ann Augustine as Ranju, Ram's girlfriend\n* Suraj Venjaramoodu as Achuvettil Achankunju\n* Salim Kumar as K.
