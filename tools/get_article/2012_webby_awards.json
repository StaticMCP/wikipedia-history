Winners were selected from among roughly 10,000 entries and voting by the public for the People's Choice Award was available prior to April 26. The awards ceremony was streamed live in HD on its website.\nNewly added to this ceremony were awards for the categories \"Mobile Advertising,\" \"Corporate Social Responsibility,\" and \"Best Meme.\" The \"Best Meme\" Category represented the first time that there would be no individual credit and no award recipient apart from the meme itself.\nNominees and winners\n:(from http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current.php?season=16)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
