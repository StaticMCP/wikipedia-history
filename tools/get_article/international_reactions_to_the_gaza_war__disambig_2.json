In February 2024, thousands of artists and cultural workers, including Jesse Darling, Joanna Piotrowska, Nan Goldin, Michael Rakowitz and Leila Sansour, signed a petition calling for Israel to be excluded from the Venice Biennale. 400 celebrities, including British actress Helen Mirren, British singer Boy George, American musician Gene Simmons, American producer Scooter Braun, and American actresses Julianna Margulies and Emmy Rossum signed a letter supporting Israel's participation in the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest. More than 2,400 musicians and artists from Finland, Iceland and Sweden, including Karin Dreijer, First Aid Kit, Eric Saade and Malena Ernman, signed an open letter calling for Israel to be excluded from the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest.\nReligious organizations\nChristian\naltar]]\n* The Holy See called for an immediate ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages, and condemned Hamas' attacks while stating that criminal responsibility for terrorist acts \"can never be attributed to an entire nation or people\". It expressed support for a two-state solution with a special status for Jerusalem.\n*The World Council of Churches, representing the majority of the world's Christian denominations, called for \"an immediate cessation of this deadly violence, for Hamas to cease their attacks and ask[ed] both parties for de-escalation of the situation\".\n* The Eastern Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Bartholomew released a message stating \"Our thoughts and prayers are particularly with the civilians... and especially with all the innocent children, who deserve to get raised in a truly \"Promised Land\" of peace and prosperity\".\n* The Catholic Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem called on the international community and religious leaders \"to make every effort in helping to de-escalate the situation, restore calm and work to guarantee the fundamental rights of people in the region\" and supported the maintenance of the \"Status Quo\" with regard to all the Holy Places in the Holy Land, especially in Jerusalem, as well as the \"urgent need to find a lasting and comprehensive solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in this land.\"\n* The Secretary General of the Anglican Communion Bishop Anthony Poggo expressed pain for the people of the region and prayer for the safety of civilians and the cessation of violence. He also offered prayers for Primate Hosam Naoum of the Episcopal Church in Jerusalem and the Middle East.\n* The Nigerian Christian Pilgrim Commission announced it was suspending pilgrimages to Israel.\n*The First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints issued a statement about Middle East violence saying it affirmed that God \"calls upon all of us to love our neighbors as ourselves, and we pray for a peaceful resolution of all conflicts\". LDS President Russell M. Nelson also called for peace.\n* The National Council of Churches in the Philippines called the conflict a \"lopsided\" war in favor of Israel. It urged Israel's response against Hamas' attack to be scrutinized for violation of international humanitarian law and called for a \"just peace\".\n*  On behalf of Quakerism, the Friends World Committee for Consultation (in collaboration with QUNO, FCNL, and Britain Yearly Meeting, among others) called for \"a ceasefire in Israel-Palestine\" and emphasized action towards peace. This position references the Quaker opposition to violence of any kind. The FWCC claimed that Quakers have \"been present in the [Gaza] region for more than 150 years, doing educational, peace, humanitarian and human rights work\", including the American Friends Service Committee and Ramallah Friends School.\nJewish\n* Ephraim Mirvis, the chief rabbi of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth, stated \"the death of any innocent person is a tragedy,\" supported Israel to \"do whatever it can to guarantee the survival of the state of Israel and the Jewish people,\" and called Hamas an \"existential threat\". Mirvis also rejected the accusations of genocide levied against Israel.\n* Riccardo Di Segni, the chief rabbi of Rome, stated that \"Whoever does evil must be defeated, as happened with the Nazis in 1945,\" and criticized the Catholic and other churches' response for being \"a jumble of political and religious declarations that have left us confused and offended .\"\n* In response to a letter by mufti Nazirudin Mohd Nasir of Singapore, chief rabbi Mordechai Abergel called for peaceful coexistence and solidarity.\nMuslim\n* The Al-Azhar Al-Sharif mosque in Cairo, regarded as Sunni Islam's foremost seat of religious learning, issued a statement saying that it stood \"fast with full support to the free people of Palestine, who have come to revive our self-confidence, lifeline, and a long-lost sense of aliveness\". It also criticised the international community's \"double standards when it comes to the Palestinian cause\".\n* Muhammadiyah urged the UN Security Council \"to immediately take political and diplomatic steps involving related parties, especially Israel-Palestine, to stop the war, carry out a ceasefire and carry out peace negotiations\" and affirmed its position in supporting the Palestinian cause. It also asked the Indonesian government to be more proactive in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n* Nahdlatul Ulama called for the conflict and violence \"to be stopped immediately with all efforts\" and urged the UN Security Council not to use \"the veto right to defend one party in this prolonged humanitarian tragedy\".\nStudent organizations\nat the University of California, Berkeley, 25 October 2023]]\nin April 2024]]\n*A coalition of 34 student organizations from Harvard University issued a statement stating the conflict \"did not occur in a vacuum\", and that Israel's \"apartheid regime is the only one to blame. Israeli violence has structured every aspect of Palestinian existence for 75 years.\" The statement was signed by Palestinian and Muslim support groups as well as others including the African American Resistance Organization and the Harvard Jews for Liberation. However several of the organisations such as Amnesty International at Harvard, Harvard College Act on a Dream, the Harvard Undergraduate Nepali Student Association, the Harvard Islamic Society and the Harvard Undergraduate Ghungroo withdrew their support for the statement and condemned the massacres of civilians by Hamas.\n* The Oxford Palestine Society said in an Instagram post that \"the offensive launched from Gaza can only be understood in the context of Israel's ongoing, decades long, military occupation and colonisation of Palestinian land and imposition of a system of oppression that meets the legal definition of apartheid.\" They also urged students to support the \"movement for a free Palestine\" and join a scheduled protest on 12 October. In contrast, the Oxford Israel Society said it \"unequivocally condemns\" the recent conflict and \"the massacre and hostage taking committed by Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists\" and called on Oxford University and other colleges to condemn the Palestinian attacks.\n*Islami Jamiat Talaba, Pakistan's largest student organization, organized a rally at Karachi University in support of Palestine that was attended by hundreds of students on 10 October, during which a 200-foot Palestinian flag was unfurled by the protesters.\n* Students at Cornell University wrote spraypainted messages related to the conflict on the Ithaca, New York campus, including \"Israel is Fascist\" and \"Free Palestine.\" The slogans were subsequently removed by the university.\n* On 12 October, a protest at Columbia University in New York City saw the attendance of pro-Palestinian demonstrators. Since November 2023, Jewish Voice for Peace's chapter at Columbia University has been under suspension. The university stated that both the JVP chapter and Students for Justice in Palestine had breached university policies, engaging in \"threatening rhetoric and intimidation\", leading to the suspension of the clubs.\n* Al-Azhar University issued a statement calling \"on the free people of the world, international organizations and institutions to take immediate action to break the siege of Gaza hospitals.\" It also emphasized that silence against the crimes of the occupying-regime is considered a stain on the forehead of humanity and the world community.\nSports organizations\nwith Israeli athletes in the Olympic village in Paris, 24 July 2024]]\nPalestinian sports organizations and sports organizations from Arab countries have called for sanctions to be imposed against Israel and to prevent its participation in the 2024 Summer Olympics due to the Gaza war. The calls from the organizations have been prompted by concerns about the war's impact on Palestinian athletes and sports facilities. In November 2023, Russia accused the International Olympic Committee of having double standards by not sanctioning Israel due to its military actions in Gaza and occupation of Palestine, as Palestine is also an IOC member. In January 2024, over 300 Palestinian sports clubs called for Israel to be barred from the 2024 Olympics after Israeli airstrikes had killed Palestine's Olympic football team coach, and damaged the headquarters of the Palestine Olympic Committee in Gaza. In February 2024, several left-wing French lawmakers sent a letter to the IOC proposing to sanction Israeli athletes while only allowing them to participate under the Individual Neutral Athlete label. The IOC has cautioned athletes against boycotting or discriminating others, stating that immediate action will follow any discriminatory behavior such as the case of Algerian judoka Fethi Nourine, who received a ten-year ban following his refusal to fight Tohar Butbul, an Israeli in 2020. The IOC also stated that athletes are not to be held accountable for their government's actions. Due to the continuation of the Israeli-Palestinian war, France asked the United States for help in securing the Olympic Games. In March 2024, IOC President Thomas Bach made it clear there was no issue regarding Israel participating at the 2024 Summer Olympics and cautioned athletes against boycotts and discrimination.\nOn 8 October 2023, UEFA cancelled all of its scheduled football matches in Israel for the next two weeks, including a qualifier for the Euro 2024 tournament between Israel and Switzerland on 12 October. It also canceled the 2025 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification games between Israel and Estonia on 12 October and between Israel and Germany on 17 October, as well as the 2024 UEFA European Under-17 Championship mini tournament on 11–17 October involving Israel, Belgium, Gibraltar and Wales. UEFA held a moment of silence for all Euro 2024 qualifying matches on 17 October for both the victims of the war in Israel as well as the Swedish fans that were murdered in Brussels a day prior. Israel later played the rest of their Euro 2024 qualification matches in Hungary, while Maccabi Haifa played a Europa League match in Cyprus before heading to Serbia alongside Maccabi Tel Aviv. EuroLeague Basketball also suspended all home games for Israeli clubs, including Hapoel Tel Aviv B.C. and Maccabi Playtika Tel Aviv, with the teams sending its players to Cyprus and Greece to possibly resume the season there. All EuroLeague and EuroCup matches held a moment of silence for the victims of the attack.\nThe National Football League, National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, National Hockey League, and Major League Soccer, amongst several other North American leagues, all released statements condemning the terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians by Hamas while urging for peace for civilians in the region. Many teams in their respective leagues also released their own statements with the same message. However, there was criticism towards all the leagues and teams for not releasing statements for the Palestinian civilians that had also been killed in the conflict. All NFL teams during Week 6 held a moment of silence for the Israeli and American victims as well as those affected by the conflict, starting with a Thursday Night game between the Denver Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs. However, during the London game between the Baltimore Ravens and Tennessee Titans, the moment of silence was interrupted by some spectators chanting \"Free Palestine\".\nIn the United Kingdom, there was pressure for the English FA and the Premier League to release statements and honour the victims of the attacks by Hamas, with some noting that other tragedies, disasters, and social movements had been honoured much more quickly. Eventually the English FA honoured both the Israeli and Palestinian victims at a friendly with Australia and a UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying match with Italy. However, they did not light up Wembley Stadium in the colours of the Israeli flag, believed to be due to one of Australia's 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier opponents being Palestine. The Premier League also honoured the victims following the international break. The FA has also banned the use of the phrase \"from the river to the sea\" on any players' social media following its use by Hamza Choudhury.\nFollowing a request from the Palestinian Football Association's head Jibril Rajoub, the Algerian Football Federation offered to host \"all official and non-official matches\" of the Palestinian national team as part of its preparations for its qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup and 2027 Asian Cup. It also pledged to shoulder all associated costs. The PFA later accepted Algeria's request, though after FIFA and the AFC prevented the team from playing in Algeria, they selected Kuwait, Qatar, and other countries in the Islamic world instead. Lebanon, Palestine and Israel's neighbour to the north, were also forced to play the same 2026 World Cup and 2027 Asian Cup qualification in neutral ground due to the fear of the war's spillover to the country. Celtic F.C. was fined 17,500 euros ($19,000) by UEFA after fans displayed a flag of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine during a Champions League match against Atletico Madrid on 25 October. A number of people protested at the Paris Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Games headquarters in the suburb of Saint-Denis, waving Palestinian flags and chanting slogans condemning Israel's \"institutional involvement\" in the Games as a result of the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The demonstrators urged Olympic authorities to restrict Israel's involvement in the Paris Games.\nThe left-wing Podemos party in Spain requested the exclusion of Israel from the Olympics and called on countries to boycott the competition if Israeli continued to participate. Ione Belarra, the Podemos party's secretary general and former minister of social rights in Spain, called for Israel to be removed from the Olympics. During the 74th FIFA Congress on 17 May 2024 in Bangkok, the Palestinian Football Association called for a vote on suspending the IFA from both UEFA and FIFA, stating that the damage to football infrastructure and deaths of Palestinian footballers during the Gaza war were enough grounds to justify the action, while other supporters referred to other suspensions such as those of Apartheid South Africa from 1961 to 1991 and Russia following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The IFA responded stating that their football was halted and that many of their footballers have been killed since 7 October 2023 while calling for peace and a future friendly between the two countries. Gianni Infantino would respond to the PFA stating that FIFA would conduct its own legal review and that the information about a final decision would be forwarded to the FIFA Council meeting on 3 October 2024 while also calling for peace. It was later decided that while Israel would not be suspended, FIFA would investigate the claims by the PFA. Prior to qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the Norwegian Football Federation called for an investigation into Israel (who they were drawn against), stating that they wanted to end civilian casualties in the region.\nIndividual athletes\nBayern Munich and Morocco defender Noussair Mazraoui posted in support of Palestine on social media. Liverpool and Egypt captain Mohamed Salah appealed for humanitarian aid to be allowed into Gaza and for the \"massacres\" and the \"slaughter of innocent civilians\" to stop; Al-Ittihad's French forward Karim Benzema called the bombing of Gaza \"unjust\". In response, French interior minister Gerald Darmanin accused him of having links to the Muslim Brotherhood.\nOGC Nice suspended its Algerian defender Youcef Atal after he shared a video on Instagram from a Palestinian preacher purportedly calling for violence against Jewish people. He was later detained by French authorities and received an eight-month suspended sentence from a French court on charges of inciting hatred. 1. FSV Mainz 05 also suspended and later dismissed its Dutch forward Anwar El Ghazi after he made what the club called an \"unacceptable\" social media post about the war.\nFollowing the al-Ahli Arab Hospital explosion, Tottenham Hotspur's Israeli winger Manor Solomon purportedly blamed Palestinians for \"killing their own people and blaming Israel\" in an Instagram post. Granada's Israeli forward Shon Weissman posted social media messages in support of his country following Hamas' attack. After receiving threats in response, he was excluded from a La Liga match against Osasuna on 20 October due to security issues. Muslim American basketball player Enes Kanter said the Hamas attack was a \"barbaric\" act of terrorism that did not reflect Islamic teachings. On 12 November, he said anti-Israel protesters on college campuses were \"brainwashed\" and urged people not to get their information from TikTok.\nEgyptian swimmer Abdelrahman Sameh and Tunisian Olympic swimmer Ahmed Hafnaoui were both criticized and subjected to death threats due to their support for Palestine on social media, with American swimmer Eli Cohen telling Hafnaoui he was asking people to \"donate to terror\" after the latter posted a link to a humanitarian fundraiser for war victims. Likewise, Israel Swimming Association Chairman Miki Halika wrote to the sport's international governing body World Aquatics urging it to \"take action against swimmers who support terrorism\". Mixed-martial arts champion Khabib Nurmagomedov posted on Instagram that Israel was engaged in \"genocide\" in Gaza.\nNBA star LeBron James, XFL co-owner Dwayne Johnson, former NFL players Julian Edelman and Tom Brady, and former NBA player Amar'e Stoudemire all made posts supporting peace in Israel. Israeli–American Baltimore Orioles pitcher Dean Kremer wore a Star of David during a playoff game against the Texas Rangers, as did Houston Astros shortstop Alex Bregman. Israeli right-winger Sagiv Yehezkel was suspended from Antalyaspor and later detained by Turkish authorities after showing his bandaged wrist during a match against Trabzonspor with the message \"100 days, 7/10\" in support of hostages in Gaza on 14 January 2024, which Turkish Justice Minister Yılmaz Tunç claimed was an \"ugly action supporting Israel's massacre in Gaza\". Başakşehir ended its contract with Israeli player Eden Karzev after he re-posted a social media message with the hashtag \"BringThemHomeNow\", referring to the hostages held by Hamas.\nOther organizations\nin Basel, Switzerland, 11 May 2025]]\nOn 16 February 2024 a coalition of several U.S. unions announced a call for a ceasefire. The unions claim to represent some nine million teachers, nurses, auto workers, flight attendants and others.\nEurovision Song Contest 2024\nThe ongoing humanitarian crisis resulting from the Israeli retaliatory operations in the Gaza Strip since October 2023 led to increasing calls that the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) exclude Israel from taking part in the Eurovision Song Contest 2024, with human rights activists urging other countries to boycott the event. Despite this, Israel ultimately appeared on the list of participants released by the EBU on 5 December 2023. The EBU said in a statement: \"It is a competition for broadcasters (not governments) and the Israeli public broadcaster has participated in the Contest for 50 years. The Eurovision Song Contest remains a non-political event that unites audiences worldwide through music.\"\nThe Icelandic Association of Composers and Lyricists (FTT), which represents artists in Iceland, told its members in a statement to not participate in the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 unless Israel is removed from the competition, on the same grounds as Russia was in the last competition, due to Israel's conduct in the Gaza war. FTT also urged the Icelandic National Broadcaster (RÚV) to withdraw from the competition unless Israel is denied participation on the same grounds as Russia was due to its invasion of Ukraine.\nTransatlantic Civil Servants' Statement on Gaza\nThe Transatlantic Civil Servants' Statement on Gaza is a public letter signed by over 800 currently serving officials in the United States and Europe which states that the policies of their governments during the Israel-Gaza war could amount to \"grave violations of international law\". The signatories are civil servants from the United States, the European Union, and 11 European countries including France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The identities of the signers were not made public for fear of repercussions.\nVisits by world leaders\nNumerous heads of state and government have visited Israel, Ramallah, and Egypt for consultations.\nFile:Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv-Yafo, October 2023 (ABG 3826).jpg|Olaf Scholz and Isaac Herzog, 17 October 2023\nFile:President Joe Biden meets with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.jpg|Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu, 18 October 2023\nFile:The Prime Minister meets Mahmoud Abbas (53270944387).jpg|Rishi Sunak and Mahmoud Abbas, 20 October 2023\nFile:Isaac Herzog in Beit HaNassi, October 2023 (ABG 7050).jpg|Emmanuel Macron and Isaac Herzog, 24 October 2023\nFile:Isaac Herzog in Beit HaNassi, November 2023 (GPOHZ0 1926).jpg|Edgars Rinkēvičs and Isaac Herzog, 20 November 2023\nFile:Viaje del presidente del Gobierno a Palestina.jpg|Pedro Sánchez, Mahmoud Abbas, and Alexander De Croo, 23 November 2023\nFile:Javier Milei visit to Israel, February 2024 (GPOHZ1 4634).jpg|Javier Milei and Isaac Herzog, 6 February 2024\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Parliament President Roberta Metsola arrived in Israel on 13 October. On 17 October, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited Israel to express solidarity with the country. On his departure from Ben-Gurion airport, he was evacuated to a shelter after a rocket alarm went off. On 18 October, US President Joe Biden arrived in Israel and was received at Ben-Gurion airport by Israeli President Isaac Herzog and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. At a news conference, he said Israel did not commit the al-Ahli hospital bombing in Gaza and blamed what he called \"the other team\" for the attack. In the wake of the attack, a summit in Amman hosted by King Abdullah II that was also to be attended by Biden, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el Sisi was cancelled by the Jordanian government.\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak arrived in Israel on 19 October, in order to meet Netanyahu and offer his condolences for the civilians killed in the initial attacks. On 21 October 2023, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni visited Israel to express solidarity with the country. French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in Israel on 24 October. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala arrived in Israel on 25 October. During the visit of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, Netanyahu was asked to respect international law, and Sánchez announced that Spain was ready to recognize the State of Palestine. This triggered a harsh reaction from Israeli foreign minister Eli Cohen, who subsequently accused both prime ministers of \"giving support to terrorism\" in Israel. On 6 February 2024, Argentine president Javier Milei became the first Latin American president to visit Israel since the start of the war, where he condemned Hamas attacks and confirmed his position of moving the Argentine embassy to Jerusalem.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Serving heads of state and government that have visited Israel during the war\n!State\n!Office\n!Leader\n!Date\n!References\n|-\n| European Commission\n|President\n|Ursula von der Leyen\n|13 October 2023\n|\n|-\n| Romania\n|Prime Minister\n|Marcel Ciolacu\n|17 October 2023\n|\n|-\n| Germany\n|Chancellor\n|Olaf Scholz\n|17 October 2023\n|\n|-\n| United States\n|President\n|Joe Biden\n|18 October 2023\n|\n|-\n| United Kingdom\n|Prime Minister\n|Rishi Sunak\n|19 October 2023\n|\n|-\n| Italy\n|Prime Minister\n|Giorgia Meloni\n|21 October 2023\n|\n|-\n| Cyprus\n|President\n|Nikos Christodoulides\n|21 October 2023\n|\n|-\n|  Greece\n|Prime Minister\n|Kyriakos Mitsotakis\n|23 October 2023\n|\n|-\n| Netherlands\n|Prime Minister\n|Mark Rutte\n|23 October 2023\n|\n|-\n| France\n|President\n|Emmanuel Macron\n|24 October 2023\n|\n|-\n| Czech Republic\n|Prime Minister\n|Petr Fiala\n|25 October 2023\n|\n|-\n| Austria\n|Chancellor\n|Karl Nehammer\n|25 October 2023\n|\n|-\n| Hungary\n|President\n|Katalin Novák\n|5 November 2023\n|\n|-\n| Bulgaria\n|Prime Minister\n|Nikolai Denkov\n|6 November 2023\n|\n|-\n| Latvia\n|President\n|Edgars Rinkēvičs\n|20 November 2023\n|\n|-\n| Spain\n|Prime Minister\n|Pedro Sánchez\n|23 November 2023\n|\n|-\n| Belgium\n|Prime Minister\n|Alexander De Croo\n|23 November 2023\n|\n|-\n| Germany\n|President\n|Frank-Walter Steinmeier\n|26 November 2023\n|\n|-\n| Czech Republic\n|President\n|Petr Pavel\n|15 January 2024\n|\n|-\n| Argentina\n|President\n|Javier Milei\n|6 February 2024\n|\n|-\n| Guinea-Bissau\n|President\n| Umaro Sissoco Embaló\n|3 March 2024\n|\n|-\n| Paraguay\n|President\n| Santiago Peña\n|11 December 2024\n|\n|-\n| Greece\n|Prime Minister\n| Kyriakos Mitsotakis\n|30 March 2025\n|\n|-\n| Albania\n|Prime Minister\n| Edi Rama\n|7 April 2025\n|\n|-\n| Ecuador\n|President\n| Daniel Noboa\n|4–6 May 2025\n|\n|-\n| Argentina\n|President\n|Javier Milei\n|11 June 2025\n|\n|-\n| Fiji\n|Prime Minister\n|Sitiveni Rabuka\n|17 September 2025\n|\n|}\nDemonstrations\nDemonstrations took place in many Middle Eastern countries, such as Yemen, Jordan, Lebanon, Kuwait, Turkey, Qatar, Bahrain, Syria, Egypt, Iraq and Iran in solidarity with the Palestinian groups.

On 9 October, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said that he would not tolerate public celebrations of the Hamas attacks. The German Green Party asked for restrictions on organizations which openly support Hamas. The liberal conservative Christian Democratic Union of Germany asked for those who supported Hamas to have their German citizenship revoked. The Central Council of Jews in Germany and the Israeli ambassador both asked for actions to be taken. Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced plans to ban the pro-Palestinian group Samidoun after it was pictured handing out sweets in Berlin to celebrate Hamas' attack on 7 October. Police subsequently banned pro-Palestine demonstrations in Berlin, while French police arrested ten people in rallies in Lille and in Paris' Place de la République after the government issued a similar ban. Amnesty International called on European countries to safeguard the right to protest, saying that many countries \"are unlawfully restricting the right to protest\".\nIn the United Kingdom, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly urged Palestine supporters to stay home, saying that their protests were causing concern in the Jewish community. Citing laws prohibiting explicit support for banned organisations, authorities arrested a woman in Brighton for making a speech in support of Hamas at a protest. One rally in London drew an estimated 100,000 protestors in support of the Palestinians. 60,000 people later marched in London to protest against a rise in antisemitism from the war. At an October rally in Dublin Ireland, former justice minister Alan Shatter voiced support for Israel and denounced \"the third Reich on the streets of Dublin.\" Several landmarks, such as Taipei 101, the Sydney Opera House, the Brandenburg Gate, the White House, and the Eiffel Tower, were lit up in the colors of the Israeli flag.\nBoycott of Western companies\n's office in Goleta, California, 9 November]]\nPeople in some Muslim countries have boycotted Western businesses, especially American ones such as Starbucks, McDonald's and Coca-Cola, reflecting anger at Western governments' support for Israel. Campaigners in Derry, Northern Ireland persuaded O'Neills to remove Puma products because of the sports brand's sponsoring of the Israeli Football Association. Starbucks was targeted in Keighley, West Yorkshire, with protesters smashing the shop's windows, following the corporation's decision to sue the Starbuck Workers United union after the labour organisation posted on social media support for Palestine.\nDirect action was taken at arms factories in the United States and the United Kingdom that supplied arms to Israel, such as Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Textron, Boeing, Raytheon Technologies and Northrop Grumman. For instance, on 10 November 2023, trade unionists in Rochester, Kent, blocked the entrances to a BAE Systems factory, stating the facility manufactured military aircraft components used to bomb Gaza; and on 16 November, Palestine Action occupied a Leonardo factory in Southampton, stopping production. ZIM was barred from entering ports in Malaysia.\nStudent protesters called on Columbia University to financially divest from any company with business ties to the Israeli government, including Microsoft, Google and Amazon. NYU Alumni for Palestine called on New York University to \"terminate all vendor contracts with companies playing active roles in the military occupation in Palestine and ongoing genocide in Gaza, namely Cisco, Lockheed Martin, Caterpillar and General Electric\".\nWeapons transfers\n, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, US Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Charles Q. Brown Jr. and Israeli Chief of General Staff Herzi Halevi in Tel Aviv, Israel, 18 December 2023]]\nPresident Biden called on Congress to pass $14.3&nbsp;billion in emergency military aid to Israel. The Biden Administration caused controversy after bypassing Congress on multiple occasions to authorize arms sales to the Israeli military.\nIn December 2023, a Wall Street Journal report stated that US arms shipments to Israel since the start of the war included 15,000 bombs and 57,000 155mm artillery shells, mostly carried on C-17 military cargo planes. U.S. has also sent more than 5,000 unguided Mk82 bombs, more than 5,400 Mk84 bombs, about 1,000 small diameter GBU-39 bombs, and almost 3,000 JDAMs. It also said that some of the bloodiest Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip involved the use of large US-made bombs, such as the one that destroyed an apartment complex in the Jabalia refugee camp and killed over a hundred people.\nThe United Kingdom, Germany, France, Canada, Australia, Spain, the Netherlands and Italy also supplied arms to Israel. On 29 February 2024, the European Parliament overwhelmingly rejected an arms embargo on Israel. In May 2024, a group of 300 Australian public servants called on the government to cease weapons transfers to Israel. Serbia's state-owned arms manufacturer, Yugoimport SDPR exported weapons worth around $17.1 million to Israel, using IDF planes and civilian aircraft.\nEvacuations of foreign nationals\nOn 8 October, the Brazilian government announced a rescue operation of Brazilian nationals using an Airbus A330 of the Brazilian Air Force, accompanied by doctors and psychologists.

Notably, members of Generation Z were more likely to support Palestine and to oppose Israel than any other generation.

Furthermore, 67% of Generation Z respondents considered Jews to be oppressors, yet 69% of Generation Z respondents also stated that Israel has a right to exist. Another poll in December 2023 was conducted by More in Common which surveyed various age groups, including Generation Z When members of Generation Z were asked whether they considered Hamas to be a terrorist organisation, Generation Z respondents were the most likely to consider Hamas to be freedom fighters and the least likely to consider Hamas a terrorist organisation.\nSome research has credited the stance of Western countries' members of Generation Z to TikTok and social media trends on the platform, with Axios noting that the platform has a large amount of Palestinian content on the website. The site found that 87% of TikTok users who view #StandwithPalestine posts are under the age of 35. In comparison, only 66% of TikTok users who view #StandwithIsrael posts are under the age of 35. A trend was observed of Generation Z TikTok users sharing their conversion to Islam following the Israel-Hamas war. Lorenzo Vidino, director of the Programme on Extremism at George Washington University has attributed this trend to a desire among Generation Z to rebel against Western values. Vidino stated: \"At this point, what's more rebellious, what's more anti-Western and anti-capitalism and anti-establishment, than a conversion to Islam?\"\nAnalysis\nHugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow with the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations, analysed in January 2024, that the strong diplomatic and military support from much of the Western world (including US, UK, Germany) to Israel is \"at odds with the attitudes of Western publics which continue to shift away from Israel\". He said that during the Cold War, Israel sided with the West against the Arab countries supported by the Soviets, and Western leaders generally see Israel \"as a fellow member of the liberal democratic club\", which partially \"explains the continued strong Western support for Israel – which has now largely become reflexive\". According to Andrew Stroehlein, writing for Human Rights Watch in October 2024, most countries of the world have supported their own side of the conflict, without caring for human rights.\nSee also\n* Impacts of the Gaza war\n* Diplomatic impact of the Gaza war\n* Arms embargoes on Israel since 2023\n* List of U.S. officials who resigned over Biden's support for Israel in the Gaza war\n* Violent incidents in reaction to the Gaza war\n* Media coverage of the Gaza war\n* Gaza war protests\n* Israeli public diplomacy in the Gaza war\n* Ninth Extraordinary Session of the Islamic Summit Conference\n* Outline of the Gaza war\n* Kidnapped from Israel\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTbqPLjpzDpGdamN2LWL1a-lLCkgs0nDOmgBN3MT-U-3-t5D1gIgrc5KORsHfO9nEIuOBdCnD-5tDKX/pub Transatlantic Civil Servants' Statement on Gaza]"
