State voters chose three representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nNevada was won by General Winfield Scott Hancock (D–Pennsylvania), running with former Representative William Hayden English, with 52.40% of the popular vote, against Representative James A. Garfield (R-Ohio), running with the 10th chairman of the New York State Republican Executive Committee Chester A. Arthur, with 47.60% of the vote. This was the first time Nevada voted for a Democratic presidential candidate, with Hancock's victory being generally attributed to the fact that Garfield was viewed as weaker than Hancock on the hot-bed issue of controlling immigration from China – which both major parties promised to do and which the Nevada electorate was overwhelmingly in favor of.\nThis is the first occasion where a Republican won without the state since it was admitted to into the union. This was the first election in which a Democratic candidate carried Douglas County, Storey County, Washoe County, and White Pine County; they would not back a Democrat again until 1896.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ General Election Results\n! colspan=2|Party\n!
