      "text": "# List of Senior CLASS Award women's volleyball winners\n\nThe Senior CLASS Award is presented each year to the outstanding senior NCAA Division I Student-Athlete of the Year in women's volleyball.  The award was established in 2010 and the first award went to Ellie Blankenship of the Northern Iowa Panthers.\nSo far, no men's version of this award has been created. Three NCAA sports that are sponsored for both men and women have Senior CLASS Awards for only one sex—ice hockey and lacrosse do not have women's awards, and volleyball does not have a men's award.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Winner\n!School\n|-\n|2010\n|Ellie Blankenship\n|Northern Iowa\n|-\n|2011\n|Kanani Danielson\n|Hawaii\n|-\n|2012\n|Gina Mancuso\n|Nebraska\n|-\n|2013\n|Ariel Scott\n|Penn State\n|-\n|2014\n|Liz McMahon\n|Illinois\n|-\n|2015\n|Cassie Strickland\n|Washington\n|-\n|2016\n|Paige Tapp\n|Minnesota\n|-\n|2017\n|Haleigh Washington\n|Penn State\n|-\n|2018\n|Mikaela Foecke\n|Nebraska\n|-\n| 2019\n|\n| Stanford\n|-\n| 2020–21\n|\n| Minnesota\n|-\n| 2021\n|\n| Wisconsin\n|}\nSee also\n* List of sports awards honoring women\nFootnotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.seniorclassaward.com/volleyball/ Official site]\ncategory:College women's volleyball in the United States"
