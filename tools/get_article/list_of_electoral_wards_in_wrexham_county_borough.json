Seven of the electoral wards have two councillors. This is the second set of electoral boundaries since the council's formation, with the first set used between 1995 and 2022.\n2022 ward changes\nOn 23 June 2016, the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales was asked by the then Welsh Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Local Government to restart its boundary reviews of the 22 local authorities local government ward boundaries, with the review expected to be completed for the 2022 local elections.\nA public consultation ahead of any draft proposals was held between 15 October 2018 and 7 January 2019.\nOn 6 January 2020, the commission published its draft proposals, and held another consultation for 12 weeks between 14 January 2020 to 6 April 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Wales, the consultation was prematurely suspended on 27 March 2020, and reopened from the 1 July 2020 to 13 July 2020.\nDraft proposals\nUnder draft proposals, the LDBCW proposed a 55-member council (increase of 3), and 48 electoral wards (increase of 1), with 7 being two-councillor wards. 22 wards would be retained.\nFinal proposals\nUnder final proposals, the LDBCW proposed a 56-member council, up 1 from the draft proposal and 4 from the existing configuration. An extra ward would be added to the proposals, to a total of 49 wards, compared to the pre-existing 47 wards. 24 wards would be retained, up from the proposed 22 in the draft proposals.\nIn July 2021, the Welsh Government accepted the various ward change proposals made by the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales, with only slight modification, for Wrexham County Borough. The number of electoral wards would increase from 47 to 49. The number of councillors will increase by four, from 52 to a total of 56, giving an average of 1,801 electors per councillor. These took effect from May 2021 following the election. The changes gave a better parity of representation. The Welsh Government rejected three recommendations on the names of three wards. Twenty-four wards remained unchanged. Seven wards have two councillors, up from four wards having two councillors in 2017. The changes came into force following the passing of The County Borough of Wrexham (Electoral Arrangements) Order 2021.\nOf the other wards, and not mentioning minor boundary changes, the major changes are:\n* New wards; Acrefair North (from Plas Madoc ward and Cefn community), Bangor Is-y-Coed and Rhos.\n* Acton ward expanded to include Maesydre as Acton and Maesydre\n* Bronington ward expanded to include Hanmer as Bronington and Hanmer\n* Bryn Cefn expanded to include parts of Brynteg ward\n* Gwenfro ward expanded to include parts of New Broughton and Brynteg wards\n* Parts of Abenbury wards moved to Whitegate ward, parts of Whitegate ward (near Newton Street) moved to Smithfield ward, and parts of Smithfield ward moved to Wynnstay ward\n* Split Cefn ward (a two councillor ward) into separate East and West wards (one councillor each), as Cefn East and Cefn West.\n* Refer to the dually named Dyffryn Ceiriog/Ceiriog Valley ward by only its Welsh name, Dyffryn Ceiriog\n* Parts of Offa ward transferred to Erddig ward\n* Parts of Brynyffynnon ward transferred to Offa ward\n* Split Gwersyllt East and South (a two councillor ward) into separate East and South wards (one councillor each), as Gwersyllt East and Gwersyllt South\n* Abolish Johnstown ward, Plas Madoc ward, and Maesydre ward\n* Overton ward expanded to include Maelor South as Overton and Maelor South\n* Pant ward merged with Johnstown ward as Pant and Johnstown with two councillors.\n* Various minor boundary changes\n* Shrink the Ponciau ward, removing one of its two councillors.\n* Wards of Acton and Maesydre (merged ward), Brymbo, Pant and Johnstown (merged ward), Rhosnesni, and Rossett, become two-councillor wards.\n* Introduction of Welsh-language names used alongside English-language names for some wards.\nNo changes performed on the following wards:\nList of electoral wards\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
