He is the son of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver. He began his career playing minor roles in the early 2000s, and has since starred in the television series The Staircase (2022), American Sports Story (2024), and the third season of The White Lotus (2025).\nEarly life and family\nSchwarzenegger was born on September 18, 1993, at Providence St John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California, and raised in Los Angeles. He is the eldest son of Austrian-born bodybuilder-turned actor and politician, Arnold Schwarzenegger and journalist Maria Shriver. Schwarzenegger has two older sisters, Katherine and Christina, a younger brother, Christopher, and a younger paternal half-brother, Joseph Baena.\nHe holds dual Austrian-American citizenship, speaks English and a little German, and regularly visits Austria. He is a first cousin of Patrick Knapp Schwarzenegger.\nWhile in high school at Brentwood School, Schwarzenegger took private acting lessons with Nancy Banks. In 2012, he matriculated at the University of Southern California, and in May 2016 received his bachelor's degree from the USC Marshall School of Business, with a major in business administration and a minor in cinematic arts. He was part of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity.\nCareer\nActing\n, in 2010]]\nAt the age of 10, Schwarzenegger had a small role in the film The Benchwarmers. Throughout his childhood, he practiced acting with his father, and through his young adult years, he studied theater at USC while taking acting classes weekly at Nancy Banks Studio. At 15 years old, he started a clothing line.\nIn the following years, Schwarzenegger had supporting roles in 2012's Stuck in Love, 2013's Grown Ups 2 and 2015's Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse. His first leading role was opposite Bella Thorne in 2018's Midnight Sun, a romantic drama about a teenage girl with a rare medical condition. He starred in the 2019 horror film ''Daniel Isn't Real. In 2020, Schwarzenegger had a role in Echo Boomers'', then in 2021, he went to star in Netflix's comedy-drama coming-of-age film Moxie.\nSchwarzenegger had a role in the 2022 HBO true crime mini-series, The Staircase, alongside Colin Firth and Toni Collette. In 2023, Schwarzenegger had a recurring role in the first season of The Boys spin-off series Gen V on Prime Video, as Luke Riordan / Golden Boy, a young man with superpowers described as \"a 22-year-old big name on campus who possesses thermonuclear power and pure charisma.\" Most recently, Schwarzenegger played the role of Saxon Ratliff in season 3 of The White Lotus.\nOther ventures\nIn 2011 and 2012, Schwarzenegger interned for Academy Award-nominated producer, John Davis. Schwarzenegger went on to franchise his own Blaze Pizza locations, including one at USC while he was a student there, and one at The Grove in Los Angeles. Schwarzenegger later sold his Blaze Pizza shares and began investing in young entrepreneurs who were creating companies to meet the demand for healthier food and beverage alternatives. Schwarzenegger's other investments include electrolyte drink mix company Liquid I.V., protein coffee brand Super Coffee, and vegan chicken company Nuggs.\nIn 2020, Schwarzenegger and his mother, who is an advocate for people living with Alzheimer's, created brain nutrition and wellness brand MOSH. The company, whose name stands for Maria Owings Shriver Health, officially launched on World Alzheimer's Day. Jonathan Jarry at the Office for Science and Society pointed out the ingredients used in the MOSH bar do not conclusively improve brain health.\nPersonal life\nSchwarzenegger resides in Los Angeles, California.\nSchwarzenegger dated singer Miley Cyrus from 2014 to 2015. Since 2015, he has been in a relationship with model Abby Champion and on December 26, 2023, they announced their engagement.
