It is obstructed by ice most of the year.\nThis sea is named after Queen Victoria. Russian Arctic explorer Valentin Akkuratov claimed that a branch of the Gulf Stream reached as far north as the Queen Victoria Sea.\nGeography\nThe Queen Victoria Sea is located at 81° north latitude and 38° east longitude.  The Arctic Ocean farther north of the sea is frozen year round. The sea stretches as far west as the Sjuøyane in Svalbard and as far east as Rudolf Island in the Franz Josef Archipelago.\nThe islands of Kvitøya and Victoria Island are located at the southern limit of this Arctic sea. To the south lies the Barents Sea.\nSee also\n* List of seas\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://militera.lib.ru/prose/russian/brontman/02.html На линии огня]\n*[http://www.science-techno.ru/nt/article/zemlya-sannikova/page/3 Земля Санникова]"
