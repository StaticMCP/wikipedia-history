The club previously competed in the amateur Yorkshire Men's League before joining League One in 2025, following a successful application.\nHistory\nFormation\nGoole Vikings was founded in 2018 as an amateur club in the Yorkshire Men's League, part of the fifth tier of the British rugby league system. The club is considered the successor club to Goole RLFC which disbanded in 1902.\nThe club's first ever professional game was a pre-season friendly on Tuesday, 14 January 2025 in a 46-6 defeat to Featherstone Rovers at the Millennium Stadium, with substitute winger Callum Shaw scoring Goole's only try. One week later, in the club's first ever competitive professional match they had a stunning 10-17 victory knocking out a depleted London Broncos side from the Challenge Cup 3rd round, played at the home of Rosslyn Park F.C. in Roehampton, with tries from Tom Halliday, Thomas Minns and Mackenzie Harman.\nLeague 1\nFollowing the withdrawal of London Skolars from League 1 at the end of the 2023 season, the Rugby Football League (RFL) asked for applications for a replacement club for the 2025 season. Goole Vikings stated their intent to apply on 27 May 2024, and were placed on a three team shortlist along with Anglian Vipers (East Rugby League; Division 5) and Bedford Tigers (Southern Conference League; Division 4) on 3 July.\nOn 18 September 2024, the RFL announced Goole's application had been successful and the club would join League 1 in 2025.\nOn 1 October 2024, the club announced they had signed Scott Taylor as head coach, and Tom Halliday as their first professional player signing.\nIn January 2025, Goole pulled off a huge upset in the second round of the 2025 Challenge Cup defeating London 17-10.\n2026 squad\n|list1b=\n|list1c=\n|list1d=\n|list1e=\n|list1f=\n|list1g=\n|list1h=\n|list1i=\n|list2a=  (c)\n|list2b=\n|list2c=\n|list2d=\n|list2e=\n|list2f=\n|list2g=\n|list2h=\n|list2i=\n|list3a=\n|list3b=\n|list3c=\n|list3d=\n|list3e=\n|list3f=\n|list3g=\n|list3h=\n|list3i=\n|coach=Scott Taylor\n|assistant=Kevin Marshall\n}}\nHead coaches\n* Scott Taylor (2024–present)\nSeasons\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Season\n!colspan=10|League\n!rowspan=2|Challenge Cup\n!colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\"|Other competitions\n|-\n!
