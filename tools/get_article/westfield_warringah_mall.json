The centre was partially built on the site of 'Brookvale House', which was built by Sydney Alexander Malcolm in 1883 and was sold in 1961 to the Hooker Investment Corporation. Warringah Mall contained around 50 stores, including David Jones, Nock & Kirby, Franklins and Woolworths. Ten years later, the centre saw the opening of a new Grace Bros store which was upgraded from a homemakers store and 50 more speciality stores in 1973. The same year, a fire broke out in the original Woolworths store, killing two female workers.\nOn 13 December 1979 the Hoyts Twin Cinema complex opened with the screening of The Muppet Movie and Alien.\n1980s\nWarringah Mall was featured in the movie BMX Bandits with two young BMX experts, P.J. (Angelo D'Angelo) and Goose (James Lugton), who meet Judy (Nicole Kidman), who was working as a trolley collector. In the mid-1980s, a Target store was opened along with 20 specialty stores. To commemorate the Australian Bicentenary, Warringah Shire Council commissioned local sculptor Victor Cusack to create a central fountain for the mall. Entitled \"Pacific Family\", it was unveiled by Deputy Shire President Julie Sutton on 23 November 1988.\nThe Hoyts Twin Cinemas closed on 10 July 1989 for refurbishment which included the addition of five new screens and was scheduled to reopen by Christmas 1989. However, due to delays in construction the new Hoyts seven-screen multiplex opened on the 13 January 1990 with the premiere attraction Postcards from the Edge.\n1990s: redevelopment\nWarringah Mall was included in the sale of Hammerson's Australian property portfolio to AMP Capital in 1994.\nOn 29 May 1996 it was revealed that AMP Society has proposed $139 million three stage redevelopments of Warringah Mall. It was designed by prominent US-based architects Altoon & Porter alongside local architects Roger J. Thrum & Associates. The redevelopment proposal was to be developed around the large centre court with the open layout retained. A new air-conditioned two-level mall anchored by a newly relocated Woolworths supermarket built on the existing mall to connect to the centre court was proposed. The redevelopment also included a discount department store, a second full-line supermarket and six mini-majors and a further 133 speciality stores would be added which would boost the total number of stores to 273. The redevelopment planned to bring the total floor area from 97,300m² to 125,800m². Work on the redevelopment was expected to begin in late 1996 with completion by the first half of 1999.\nIn August 1996 Harvey Norman closed its store and relocated to its newly built 12,000m² superstore in Balgowlah. This is the same move that happened months earlier with the store at Westfield Miranda closed and relocated to the newly built Caringbah Super Centre in Taren Point.\nIn November 1996 the $139 million three stage redevelopment was approved by Warringah Shire Council and the works began in early 1997.\nThe first stage of the redevelopment was completed in March 1998 and included the opening of a new air-conditioned two-level mall anchored by a Big W discount department store on level one, a new Woolworths supermarket and liquor store on the ground level and the total number of stores to 230.\nStage two of the redevelopment was officially opened in December 1999 and included 60 new speciality stores, a new Coles supermarket on the ground level, a 700-seat Arena Cove food court alongside McDonald's, Rebel Sport and Surf Dive ‘n' Ski on level one, a new entertainment precinct on level two which included expanded Hoyts cinema complex, Galaxy World arcade, Warringah Mall Library, a community centre, Arena Terrace and Peninsula Room and as well as a new multi-storey carpark on Old Pittwater Road. This redevelopment brought the total floor area from 97,300m² to 125,800m².\n21st Century\n2000s\nThe final works of the $139 million redevelopment were completed in 2000. The old areas had a makeover which was to introduce a quality homewares precinct with the opening of Wheel & Barrow and Dick Smith Powerhouse.\nIn June 2001 the Franklins supermarket was offered for sale and closed down before the end of that year. In that same year German global discount supermarket Aldi launched in Australia and was planning to open in the space vacated by Franklins. However, due to disputes between rival supermarkets Coles and Woolworths it was rejected by AMP Capital. In 2003 Aldi opened its store outside the centre on the corner of Cross and Green Streets.\nIn March 2003 Westfield Group purchased a 25 per cent shareholding, this was increased to 50 per cent in October 2012.\nIn early 2006 JB Hi-Fi opened its store on level one.\nAMP Capital and the Westfield Group swapped interests in seven centres, including Warringah Mall which became a 50/50 joint venture between the two companies. As part of the deal, centre management transferred from AMP to Westfield with the centre rebranded Westfield Warringah Mall. In July 2014, as part of a restructure of the Westfield Group, it came under the control of the Scentre Group.\n2015–2016 Redevelopment\nIn January 2015, in preparation for the $310 million redevelopment up to ten stores were closed and relocated. Two carparks were closed and demolished in February 2015 and hoardings were erected around the centre court area. Around that time Myer began its refurbishment, shrinking from three levels to two. The store continued to trade during the refurbishment until February 2016 when it temporarily closed to allow for works to continue.\nThe $310 million redevelopment began in August 2015 with stage one of the redevelopment completed by June 2016. Westfield Warringah Mall unveiled its 1200 spaces five-level car park and a new fresh food court which was opened by My Kitchen Rules 2015 winners Will and Steve on 30 June 2016.\nStage two of the redevelopment was completed by November 2016 with the grand opening on 17 November 2016. The two-level Myer was officially opened by Australian model Jennifer Hawkins.\nThis stage two development features two new mini majors a two-level H&M, Cotton On Mega and an Anaconda store, a new two-level parallel mall linking Myer and the existing centre (built over an existing carpark) and a new refurbished centre court with a new look \"Pacific Family\" fountain and a water feature and a surfboard-inspired sculpture known as \"Whitewash\" (made from 43 chrome surfboards) by Laura Enever outside Myer. 70 new stores (including 50 fashion stores including H&M and Sephora) were added to the centre.\nFuture\n2019 redevelopment proposal\nOn 5 October 2018, plans for the $226 million redevelopment to add a new cinema, restaurants and parking were revealed. This proposal labelled as stage two of an upgrade to the centre will include a new relocated Hoyts Cinema on level 3 above the northwest restaurant precinct as part of a new dining and entertainment hub. An additional 35 food outlets including licensed premises, 15 specialty retailers, 10 small outlets and one major store will be part of the three-level centre. The existing food court on level 1 will be expanded to the south with addition of six food court outlets and the restaurant precinct on level two will feature views overlooking Brookvale Creek and the Warringah golf course. This development would add an additional 10,000sqm of extra retail space.\nThe redevelopment will add modifications to the existing Target store and a row of speciality stores from Green Street entrance to the Coles supermarket end on the ground level are also planned. The number of parking spaces will increase to a total of 5,093. This development follows the 2008 master plan of the centre. A 14-month timeline has been estimated for completion of the project. The plans for the centre had been decided in May and on 21 November 2019 it was revealed that there had been changes in the building heights. The proposed building heights have been dropped by 4.8 metres and step the design away from its southern edge with Old Pittwater Road.\n2020s\nIn March 2021, work began on modifications to the existing Target store and a row of speciality stores from Green Street entrance to the Coles supermarket end on the ground level. On 15 May 2021 Target closed its store and was replaced by Kmart discount department store which opened on 3 June 2021.\nTenants\nWestfield Warringah Mall has 131,589m² of floor space. The major retailers include David Jones, Myer, Big W, Kmart, Coles, Woolworths, Bunnings, Cotton On, H&M, TK Maxx, JB Hi-Fi, Rebel, Anaconda and Hoyts Cinema\nTransport\nWestfield Warringah Mall has bus connections to the Sydney CBD, Lower North Shore and the Northern Beaches, as well as local surrounding suburbs operated by Keolis Downer Northern Beaches. There is also a regular service to the nearby Frenchs Forest and Belrose regions operated by CDC NSW. The majority of the bus services are located on Pittwater Road and the bus interchange inside the centre.\nWestfield Warringah Mall also has multi-level car parks with 4,650 spaces.\nIncidents and accidents\n* On 29 August 1969, security guard Joseph Charles Coffman was shot and killed by an unknown assailant. It appeared that Coffman was attacked from behind with a blow to the neck, and then shot through the shoulder with what appeared to have been his own revolver. 17,000 cigarettes were found at the scene, so Coffman may have interrupted a robbery in progress. Les Howarth, a 15 year old youth of Balgowlah, accompanied Coffman on his patrol, who was asleep in the security service car at the time of the shooting. A vehicle was seen speeding away from the mall, and a stolen car was found abandoned 17kilometres away in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park. On April 13th 1970, three men Mick Zdrauko Sormaz 24, John Laurence Stout 23 and Graham Peter Bell 22 were convicted of murdering Coffman and were sentenced to life imprisonment. Police stated that Coffman had been shot with a 22 sawn-off rifle and his own 38 revolver.\n*On 2 May 2012, a man was fatally stabbed at a bus stop at around 11:40pm. He was given first aid before paramedics arrived and he was taken to the Royal North Shore Hospital. He was declared dead on arrival. A 25-year-old male had been arrested but found not guilty due to mental illness.\n* On 23 June 2015, a security guard was almost set on fire by a man who was high on ice. The security guard found the man slumped over on the stairs, unresponsive and with his eyes closed.\n* On 21 April 2016, a section of the centre was evacuated following reports of a possible bomb threat at the construction site. Access to a small parking area was restricted and the construction site was evacuated from the area at the north of the site, but shoppers were not affected.\n*On 7 January 2019, a woman was stabbed by a teenage girl while trying to break up a fight at a nail salon at around 3:00 pm. Two teenage girls, aged 14 and 13, had an altercation when the woman intervened and suffered a knife injury to her arm. Paramedics treated the woman at the scene before being taken to Royal North Shore Hospital. The 13-year-old was later charged.\n*On 22 April 2024, a 29-year old man believed to be a worker fell 3m from the awning over the walkway between two stores, landing face forward on the hard surface, breaking both his arms and hitting his head. He was taken to Royal North Shore Hospital for further treatment, the investigation is still underway to determine what had happened.\nSee also\n* List of shopping centres in Australia\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.westfield.com.au/warringahmall/ Westfield Warringah Mall Official website]"
