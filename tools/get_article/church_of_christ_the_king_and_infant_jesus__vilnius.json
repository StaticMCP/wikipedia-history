On July 10, 1993, a monument engraved with the names and codenames of the fallen Home Army soldiers was erected over the mass grave, through the efforts of the World Association of Home Army Soldiers and the Council for the Protection of Struggle and Martyrdom Sites.\nIn 2009 the church was inscribed to the Register of Cultural Heritage of Lithuania.\nGallery\nFile:Vilniaus (Pavilnio) Kristaus Karaliaus ir Šv.
