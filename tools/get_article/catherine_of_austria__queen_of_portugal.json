Currently on display in the National Museum of Ancient Art in Lisbon.]]\nAn Infanta of Castile and Archduchess of Austria, Catherine was the posthumous daughter of King Philip I and Queen Joanna of Castile. Catherine was born in Torquemada and named in honor of her maternal aunt, Catherine of Aragon. As the queen had no midwife at the time, she was assisted during childbirth by her lady-in-waiting, María de Ulloa.\nAll of her five older siblings, except Ferdinand, were born in the Habsburg Netherlands and had been put into the care of their aunt Margaret of Austria, but Joanna kept young Catherine by her side. Catherine stayed with her mother during her imprisonment at Tordesillas during her grandfather Ferdinand II of Aragon's time as regent and her elder brother Charles's reign as co-king. When the time came for her to marry, Catherine was released from the custody her mother was to endure until her death.\nQueen\nOn 10 February 1525, at the age of 18, Catherine married her first cousin, King John III of Portugal. The marriage was secured by her brother, Emperor Charles V, as a means for the Emperor to secure political stability in Iberia. They had nine children together, though only two survived past early childhood.\nCatherine was very concerned about the education of her family, accumulating a substantial library and establishing a kind of salon in the court. She brought a number of female scholars into her household, including the humanists Joana Vaz and Públia Hortênsia de Castro and the poet Luisa Sigea de Velasco. Vaz was responsible for tutoring Catherine's only surviving daughter, Princess Maria, as well as Catherine's niece, also called Maria, and a scholar in her own right.\nAfter the death of her husband in 1557, Catherine was challenged by her daughter-in-law and niece Joanna of Austria, over the role of regent for her grandchild, the infant King Sebastian. Mediation by Charles V resolved the issue in favor of his sister Catherine over his daughter Joan, who was needed in Spain in the absence of Philip II.\nCatherine then served as the regent of Portugal from 1557 until 1562. In 1562, she turned over the regency to Henry of Portugal.\nIssue\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- bgcolor=cccccc\n!Name!!Birth!!Death!!Notes\n|-\n|colspan=4|With John III, King of Portugal (married 10 February 1525)\n|-\n|Prince Afonso|| 24 February 1526||12 April 1526||Prince of Portugal (1526), died in infancy.\n|-\n|Princess Maria Manuela|| 15 October 1527|| 12 July 1545||Princess of Portugal (1527–1531).

Her line of descent became extinct within six months of her death, as the only descendant of hers that survived her, King Sebastian of Portugal, died in August 1578.\nCollector\nCatherine had one of the earliest and finest Chinese porcelain collections in Europe due to her position as Queen of Portugal. \"She acquired quantities of porcelain and exotica from Asia, which arrived regularly in Lisbon for the decoration of the Lisbon royal palace as well as for her personal use, and which served as emblems of her power. Her collection became the first kunstkammer on the Iberian Peninsula.\" She was following a tradition established earlier by the Portuguese King Manuel I of Portugal who had purchased porcelain for his wife, Maria of Castile (1482–1517), who was Catherine's aunt. Between 1511 and 1514, the Treasurer of the Spices in Lisbon \"registered a total of 692 pieces of porcelain and other exotic goods\" bought on his behalf for Maria of Castile, who was then King Manuel's second wife. Amongst other \"exotica\" in Catherine's collection were fossilized sharks' teeth, a snake's head encased in gold, heart-shaped jasper stones to stop bleeding, a coral branch used as a protector against evil spirits, bezoar stones, a unicorn's horn (a narwhal tusk) and piles of loose gems and stones such as rubies, emeralds, and diamonds.\nIn popular culture\nCatherine of Austria figures in José Saramago's 2008 novel ''The Elephant's Journey''. She also figures in Laurent Binet's 2019 novel Civilizations.\nShe was also featured in Kei Ohkubo's manga Arte, under the alias Irene at first; later, she revealed herself as Catalina, daughter to Juana of Castile. The timing was unspecified, but this fictitious arrival of Catalina at Florence could be some time between her release from custody and before her marriage; during her inner monologue, her brother, who had ordered a cardinal that was accommodating Catalina's trip to watch over her movements, was shown wearing a crown.\nAncestry\n|5= 5.
