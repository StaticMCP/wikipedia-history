The society began as a women's auxiliary of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War.\nHistory\nThe society was first incorporated on December 12, 1885, as the National Alliance of the Daughters of Veterans of the United States of America, in Massillon, Ohio. In 1900, they were endorsed by the Grand Army of the Republic at its 34th annual encampment in Chicago. The auxiliary changed their name to Daughters of Union Veterans of the Civil War at their 35th national convention in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1925. In 1944, they changed their name to Daughters of Union Veterans of the Civil War 1861–1865 at their convention in Des Moines, Iowa.\nIn the 1950s, the national organization relocated to Springfield, Illinois. In 1969, a facility was built to house their national headquarters and a Civil War museum. Located next to the Daughters of Union Veterans of the Civil War Museum is the Dr. Benjamin Franklin Stephenson Library and Research Center, housed in a 2,800-square foot American Foursquare house from 1898. The library houses a complete set of War of the Rebellion: Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies. In 2010, a memorial brick garden was dedicated at the national headquarters to honor society founders, society members, Civil War veterans, and American veterans of all wars.\nThe society supports academic scholarships and projects that preserve and maintain history and the legacy of Union soldiers of the Civil War, including maintenance of historic monuments, battlefields, sites, and cemeteries as well as volunteering with veterans and veteran hospitals.\nMembership\nMembership is based on eligibility and is limited to daughters, granddaughters, and great-granddaughters of any generation through lineal descent of a Union veteran. Members must be at least eight years old. There are approximately 4,000 members.\nNotable members\n* Denise Doring VanBuren, 45th President General of the Daughters of the American Revolution\nMuseums and memorials\n* Abraham Lincoln Statue and Park\n* Camp Harlan-Camp McKean Historic District\n* Daughters of Union Veterans Civil War Memorial\n* Grand Army of the Republic Cemetery\n* Soldiers and Sailors Monument\n* Sunfield G.
