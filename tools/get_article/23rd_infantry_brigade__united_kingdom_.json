After the outbreak of the Second World War, the brigade was redesignated as the 23rd Infantry Brigade on 20 September 1939. It was dispersed in the canal area, and became part of HQ Canal sub-Area troops. In May 1941, the brigade was re-formed to take part in the Syria-Lebanon Campaign, during June and July 1941, as part of 6th Infantry Division. In October 1941, the 6th Infantry Division was re-designated as the 70th Infantry Division. The division, including the brigade, was transported to Tobruk to relieve the 9th Australian Infantry Division. As part of the Tobruk garrison, the brigade helped to fend off Rommel's Axis forces until the siege was relieved at the end of the year during Operation Crusader.\nIn March 1942, the 70th Infantry Division arrived in India. Its brigades, including the 23rd Infantry Brigade, were assigned to the Chindits. The brigade was retrained as a long range penetration unit. The brigade did not take part in the Second Chindit Expedition. Instead, it was deployed during the Battle of Kohima behind Japanese lines, and interdicted Japanese communication and supplies.\nCommanders\n* Brigadier W. T. Brooks 1939 - 1940\n* Brigadier J. T.
