In the 6th century AD, the polity was led by a king named Ortaias. Initially an ally of the Byzantine Empire, Ortaias was opposed by Mastigas of the Mauro-Roman Kingdom and Iaudas of the Kingdom of the Aurès. It is likely that the Kingdom of Hodna was conquered or absorbed by the Byzantine Empire around 539 after the Praetorian prefect of Africa, Solomon returned land that included the kingdom's territory \"into Roman power\".\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n*\n*"
