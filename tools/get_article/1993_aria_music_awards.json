The ARIA Hall of Fame inducted: Peter Allen and Cold Chisel.\nCeremony details\nFormer Countdown host and music commentator Molly Meldrum provided one of the longest speeches in ARIA history upon accepting his Special Achievement Award. At the 1991 ceremony Gary Morris, manager for Midnight Oil, had provided a 20-minute acceptance speech. Meldrum had publicly disapproved of Morris' speech both its content and excessive length—they had also had a shouting match at the ARIAs in 1988. Music journalist, Anthony O'Grady, described Meldrum's 1993 speech, \"[he] reeled off some 50 names starting with Ronnie Burns and Ronnie's Aunt Edna [Edna is Burns' mother], ending with a dedication to his adopted son Morgan. The speech contained a classic line describing his time as a mimer in Kommotion: 'I can't mime and I can't talk properly yet'.\"\nPresenters and performers\nThe ARIA Awards ceremony was hosted by TV personality Richard Wilkins.
