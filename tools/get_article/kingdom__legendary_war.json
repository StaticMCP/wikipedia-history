Each large team then divides its members into three smaller units - a dance unit, a vocal unit, and a rap unit, based on each individual idol's specialty. The corresponding units in each group will go against each other over three rounds - dance, vocal, and rap. The winning group in each of the three rounds will earn 5,000 points, which will be evenly distributed. The awarding of points is solely based on which group won each round. A total of 15,000 points are up for grabs.\nThe second part will be back in individual groups, with a total of 25,000 points to be distributed, in the same way as the other rounds. However, for the idol group's self-evaluations, each group can only vote for two teams, instead of three in previous rounds.\n* For Part 1 of this round, 33 special judges are invited to judge the performances and each will have 1 vote. The special judges include Super Junior members Shindong & Donghae, producer and CEO of Brand New Music Rhymer, idol hitmaker Shinsadong Tiger, music critic Kim Young-dae, song production team MonoTree, choreographer Lia Kim and idol group members of BDC, Weeekly, Tri.be and Mirae.\nFinal Round - Who Is The King\nThe six boy groups will each perform a newly produced song live on the final episode. The new songs will be released digitally on May 28, 2021, at 12:00 (KST).\n*Voting for this round includes live text votes for voters living in South Korea, and through Whosfan app for overseas fans.\n*Digitals rankings will be determined via Gaon Music Chart for South Korea, and via Apple Music for overseas, from the time of release to June 1, 2021.\nRounds\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"7\" | Introduction Stage - 100 Seconds Performance (Episode 1)\n|-\n! width=\"10\" | Order\n! width=\"100\" | Artist\n! width=\"300\" | Performance name\n! width=\"300\" | Global Votes\n! width=\"300\" | Ranking\n! width=\"300\" | Points\n! width=\"300\" | Note(s)\n|-\n| 1\n| Ateez\n| Wave: Overture\n| 504,215\n| 5th\n| 0.000\n| rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:left;vertical-align:top;font-size:small\" | The performances were aired via live stream on February 23, 2021, through Mnet's YouTube channel.

Each group were notified the maximum budget for stage decoration would be ₩5 million won (approximately $4,416) per team. However, during the recording, agencies from groups who comparatively did not have an extravagant set and props that appeared to be far over the budget reportedly confronted the production team on the matter and questioned if it was due to CJ ENM investing in the other group's agency. According to the report, the production team countered by stating it was because the group's props were from their concert, but as the other groups have also had concerts with props that could've been used, their agencies continued to speak out.\nIn response, during the press conference held on April 1, CP Park Chan-wook stated: \"I apologize that an issue was raised ahead of the show's premiere. But we did not have to halt the recording due to someone's complaint. There was also no favoritism towards a certain team. I hope that the six teams and their agencies were not harmed by this issue. For round two, we had discussions with each agency about the parts that were lacking in round one. We have all negotiated and agreed on a way to bring out each team's creatives well. Starting round three, with the conditions that all six teams have agreed on, we will make sure that there are no more issues like these.\"\nSong Credits\nNames of performing members that have also contributed to the songwriting will be highlighted in bold.
