She was New Zealand's first woman professor of rheumatology.\nAcademic career\nMcQueen graduated from the University of Otago with a MB Chb in 1980, and worked as a consultant rheumatologist in New Zealand. She completed a PhD titled Investigations into the immunopathology of inflammatory arthritis at the University of Auckland in 1996. McQueen then joined the faculty of the University of Auckland, rising to full professor in 2009. She was New Zealand's first woman professor of rheumatology, and is an honorary clinical professor at the University of Otago. McQueen used magnetic resonance imaging to show the development of bone erosion in rheumatoid arthritis, and published a ten-year longitudinal study that was \"the first of its kind and identified the central importance of osteitis in the development of bone erosion in rheumatoid arthritis\". Consultant rheumatologist Nicola Dalbeth nominated her as one of the \"25 great women\" in rheumatology.\nMcQueen's lifelong hobby of tramping led to an interest in conservation, and in 2017 she published a book arguing against the use of 1080 for pest control in New Zealand forests.\nMcQueen is also a children's writer, having written two books out of a planned trilogy about the adventures of a marmot and a squirrel, Roderick and the Wizard of Endor, and Roderick and the Creeping Evil.\nSelected works\nBooks\n*\n* McQueen, F.
