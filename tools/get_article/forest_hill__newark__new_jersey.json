It is a pre-World War II neighborhood in the North Ward. It is bounded on the west by Branch Brook Park, on the south by Bloomfield Avenue (some maps place the southern limit at 2nd Avenue), and on the east by both Summer and Mt. Prospect Avenues, the neighborhood of Broadway. The neighborhood's ZIP Code is 07104.\nForest Hill is located on a ridge between the Passaic River and the valley of the Branch Brook.  It was first developed by Elias Heller, who owned a file factory in North Newark, on the Belleville border. Heller Parkway is named in his honor. From the 1870s to the 1920s, generations of wealthy Newarkers built hundreds of stately homes in the area in various styles, including Beaux-Arts, Victorian, Colonial Revival, Gothic Revival, and Spanish Revival. One such house is the Wright-Clark house, a Tudor style manor built during the early 1900s. Along with their mansions, the wealthy of Forest Hill also developed scores of social and literary clubs.  Other than the homes, landmarks include the old Tiffany factory and the Ballantine Gate. The North End branch and the Branch Brook Park branch of the Newark Public Library serve the neighborhood.\nThe neighborhood is well preserved and maintained, and few of the historic homes have been torn down, renovated into apartments, or transferred to institutional use.  The northern part of the neighborhood is part of an official historic district, containing a marker that was erected by The Newark Preservation and Landmarks Committee, a non-profit organization dedicated to the care of Newark's past history. During special times throughout the year, there are special tours made possible by several organizations such as the New Jersey Historical Society where homeowners open their homes to visitors, and the Mount Pleasant Cemetery Association. Working alongside the neighborhood, the Forest Hill Community Association provides assistance by offering a chance to volunteer, and hosting various events of engagement. This area also includes a diverse community, standing out for its calm environment.\nThe Sydenham House located on \"The Old Road to Bloomfield\" (east of Branch Brook Park) and built in 1712 is the city's oldest private residence. It was later expanded in the early 19th Century.  D.J. and Elizabeth Henderson restored it in the 1950s.\nTransportation\nThe Bloomfield Avenue, Davenport Avenue and Branch Brook Park stations of the Newark Light Rail system are all located nearby.\nNotable people\nNotable current and former residents of Forest Hill include:\n* Robert Altenkirch, President of the University of Alabama in Huntsville.\n* Peter Ballantine (1791–1883), founder of Newark's Patterson & Ballantine Brewing Company in 1840.\n* Dean Faiello (born 1959), non-doctor convicted of killing a patient during a medical procedure.\n* Maria Jeritza (1887–1982), opera singer.\n* Louis Comfort Tiffany (1848–1933), artist and designer best known for his work in stained glass.\n* William Hayes Ward (1835–1916) clergyman, editor of The Independent, a leading Abolitionist newspaper.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.fhcanewark.org/ Forest Hill Community Association]\n*[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/26/realestate/26living.html Forest Hill-related article] from The New York Times\n*[http://www.newarkhistory.com/mtprospectave.html Virtual tour of Mt.
