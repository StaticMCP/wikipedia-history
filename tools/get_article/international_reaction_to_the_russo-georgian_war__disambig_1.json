The conflict began in August 2008 in South Ossetia but spread elsewhere in Georgia. The war had a considerable humanitarian impact and affected the financial markets of Russia and Georgia.\nIn general, Georgia accused Russia of aggression, whereas Russia accused Georgia of genocide and crimes against humanity targeting Ossetians and Russian peacekeepers. Most other countries called for peace, with some demanding respect of Georgia's territorial integrity while others supported Russian intervention. The Russian invasion of its US-aligned neighbor caused Russia–United States relations to plummet for the first time since the end of the Cold War and led to heated verbal exchanges. In the next year, the new US administration chose a policy of the reset.\nNational statements\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:175px;\"| Country !!

Only immediate ceasefire, peaceful and civilized manner of negotiating will secure stability in the South Ossetian region and across the Caucasus.\"\nAfter Russian ambassador to Belarus commented on 12 August on the \"modest silence\" of Belarus, the next day President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko expressed his support for South Ossetian civilians and promised aid. The President's press service issued a statement saying, \"The Belarussian people, like all Russians, is in mourning over the victims of the tragedy and shares the concerns of those who lost relatives, their homes and their livelihoods.

An evacuation of Czech citizens from Georgia would be organized. There were five Czech UN observers in Abkhazia.\nThe Czech Foreign Ministry released a statement fully supporting Georgia's territorial integrity and indirectly blaming Russia for the crisis. However, Czech President Václav Klaus, stated that the conflict in Georgia was linked to the Kosovo precedent, which gave Russia an excuse. He said he refused \"to accept this widespread, simplified interpretation which paints the Georgians as the victims and the Russians as the villains\" and rejected comparison with 1968 Czechoslovakia saying that Subcarpathian Ruthenia was not attacked and that Czechoslovak leader Alexander Dubček could not be compared with President Saakashvili.\nIn September 2008, Prime Minister of the Czech Republic Mirek Topolánek said that NATO had erred by not offering a candidate status to Georgia and Ukraine in April 2008.\n|-\n|  || Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen condemned Russian aggression on August 9: \"We have to insist that the sovereignty of Georgia be respected.

The Riigikogu urged the international community \"to assist Georgia in every way possible\" and supported \"the accelerated accession of Georgia to NATO\".\nEstonian President Ilves said on 14 August that the Russian attack on Georgia should be considered a persuasive argument for the conferral of NATO membership to Georgia and Ukraine.

Basically, I think it backfired.\"\nAccording to the Georgian defense ministry, the Estonian government had deployed 50 servicemen to defend Georgia and ensure the Russian withdrawal.\nForeign Minister Urmas Paet commented on the Russian compliance with ceasefire agreement while traveling from Tbilisi to Gori on August 16, \"I don't see why they signed it if they don't want to implement it.\"\nEstonian Defense Minister Jaak Aaviksoo said on 13 September 2008 that the \"Russian bear\" does not change as years pass and that the West lost all hopes that they and Russia could have common values.\nIn October 2008, President Ilves cautioned the European Union against quick improvement of ties with Russia.\nIn December 2008, the Estonian defense ministry announced that Estonia was ready to receive the Georgian soldiers injured in August 2008 for the treatment.\n|-\n|  || Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb said in a statement on August 8 that he had communicated with Georgian and South Ossetian authorities on the evening of 7 August and told them to resume negotiations.

Stubb's vacation in Italy was cut short.\nOn 11 August 2008, Finnish president Tarja Halonen talked by phone with Russian president Dmitry Medvedev and urged to halt the hostilities.\n|-\n|  || French Foreign Ministry issued a statement backing Georgia's territorial integrity on August 8. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner was in communication with all sides of the conflict.\nPresident Nicolas Sarkozy's office issued a statement on 9 August saying that EU foreign ministers would hold a meeting to debate solutions, such as a prompt cessation of hostilities, \"full respect\" for Georgia's territorial integrity and restoration of the pre-war situation. France, president of the European Union, stated, \"It (the EU presidency) demands an immediate ceasefire. It welcomes the offer of the ceasefire from Georgia and expects from Russia that it will immediately accept such a ceasefire.\" France stated that Europe \"underscores that the military actions (against Georgia) could affect EU-Russian relations.\"\nOn 10 August 2008, Sarkozy announced a plan to settle the conflict. He also said that he had discussed the situation in Georgia with the officials from Georgia, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, Spain and Italy. Sarkozy was planning to talk with the leaders of Russia, Germany, Poland and the USA.\nBefore his departure for Tbilisi on 10 August, Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner labelled the South Ossetian conflict as \"massacres\" and said he would urge in a \"message of peace\" both Georgia and Russia \"to stop the fighting immediately.\" Kouchner also told Le Parisien newspaper, \"We are facing an escalation of violence [that is] unacceptable at the doors of Europe. This reminds me all too much of other recent conflicts that have torn our continent apart, particularly in the Balkans.\"\nKouchner visited Georgia on 11 August along with Finnish Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb. They both denounced the hostile actions of Russia in Georgia. Kouchner told Saakashvili in Gori \"that the war must stop\", adding he was \"not in the business of blaming people\". Kouchner was expected to bring draft ceasefire endorsed by Saakashvili to the Kremlin during that night, while President Sarkozy would visit Georgia and Russia the next day.\nAt a two-hour closed meeting of the Security Council on 11 August, France proposed a resolution calling for the ceasefire and withdrawal of the armed forces to the lines of August 6; however, Russian UN envoy Vitaly Churkin ruled out Russian approval of such plans.\nDuring the Olympic opening on 8 August in Beijing, Sarkozy told Putin that they had \"to find a way out of this crisis,\" but Putin responded, \"I can't let it happen.\" As French president Nicolas Sarkozy began to mediate between Russia and Georgia, he called Russian president Dmitry Medvedev in Moscow. Although Medvedev wished Georgian president Saakashvili to be \"fired\", Sarkozy told him, \"It's not up to you or me to designate the Georgian leader.\" Before Sarkozy's departure for Moscow, Bush asked him not to go, \"You'll arrive at the Kremlin when the Russians are firing missiles at Tbilisi.\" Sarkozy's meeting with Russian president Medvedev on 12 August was planned to take during lunchtime. When Sarkozy arrived in Moscow, Putin allegedly commented on himself and President Medvedev in presence of Sarkozy on 12 August, \"It's just like in the films – there's a good cop and a bad cop.\" Later a French presidential aide commented, \"For the first time in a major international crisis, it is the Americans who are on the touchline and it is the European Union that is being called upon to sort things out.\" Sarkozy said on 12 August, \"We do not yet have a peace deal, we have a provisional cessation of hostilities, but this is significant progress.\" After meeting with Russian president on 12 August, Sarkozy arrived in Georgia. The drafted ceasefire agreement was largely influenced by Russia's interests, not by respect towards Georgia's sovereignty. This unnerved the United States. Sarkozy declared the agreement on the ceasefire at 2 a.m. on 13 August after meeting with Saakashvili. The ceasefire agreement mentioned \"additional security measures\", which apparently enabled Russia to occupy the town of Gori on 13 August and take over Georgia's main east-west road connecting the Black Sea coast with capital Tbilisi. The United states responded by dispatching humanitarian assistance to Tbilisi. Saakashvili did not yield to Sarkozy and only signed the agreement later on 15 August after Rice had convinced him. According to Vladimir Socor, there were signs that the agreement was actually written by the Russians and Sarkozy effectively became a postman who forced the agreement on Georgia in the face of the threat of the Russian occupation of Tbilisi. According to Mark Mardell's source, the original ceasefire negotiated by Kouchner and Stubb supporting Georgia's territorial integrity was scrubbed Sarkozy and replaced with the Russian-prepared document. On 13 August, Sarkozy reported about his dealings with Medvedev and Putin to US President George Bush.\nThe French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said, \"Don't ask us who's good and who's bad here. We shouldn't make any moral judgments on this war. Stopping the war, that's what we're interested in.\"\nPresident Nicolas Sarkozy said the ceasefire agreement between Russia and Georgia would become effective after the United Nations Security Council's approval and the formation of a \"mechanism\" supervising over compliance with the agreement. The office of French President commented on Medvedev's acceptance of the ceasefire on 15 August 2008, \"His country will sign a cease-fire accord with Georgia and scrupulously respect all agreements, including a troop withdrawal.\"\nSarkozy said on August 16 that the ceasefire agreement prohibited Russian military presence in \"any major urban area\" of Georgia. But Sarkozy wrote to Saakashvili that the Russian forces had the authority for monitoring \"a few kilometres\" near South Ossetia.\nKouchner said on 17 August that international peacekeepers should be deployed to South Ossetia and that the ceasefire was not yet stable.\nSarkozy told Medvedev by phone that Russian refusal to begin \"withdrawal, without delay\" would draw \"serious consequences\" in relations with the EU. Sarkozy later stated if Russia did not \"rapidly and totally\" withdrew from Georgia, he would \"have to call an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the European Union to decide what consequences to draw.\"\nAfter the NATO meeting on 19 August, Kouchner commented on Russian withdrawal, \"We are very disappointed, because despite the promise to us, there is no withdrawal of troops. When you sign up to an agreement you have to respect it.\" He said that in case of Russian non-compliance with the agreement, a summit on the EU-Russia relationship might be convened by French President Nicolas Sarkozy.\nBernard Kouchner said on 21 August, \"We are waiting ... for the Russians to respect their word. We waited twice with dashed hopes. This time, it appears that there is at least the beginning of a fulfillment.\"\nOn 23 August, President Sarkozy approved of the Russian pullout from Georgia. He called on Russia to withdraw from Poti and Senaki, where the main Georgian air base was located. Sarkozy convened a special meeting of the EU countries in Brussels on 1 September, where EU-Russia relations and assistance for Georgia would be discussed.\nOn 27 August, Kouchner said that Russia violated international law when it recognized Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Kouchner commented about an ethnic cleansing in South Ossetia, \"I hope that didn't happen overnight. But there has already been evidence that the armies are pushing away the Ossetians who favored Georgia, and in a certain way, yes, an ethnic cleansing is taking place.\" Kouchner said that the situation was \"very dangerous\". Kouchner said, \"There are other objectives that one can suppose are the objectives of Russia, in particular Crimea, Ukraine and Moldova.\" In response, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said that Kouchner had a \"sick imagination\".\nSarkozy addressed the French diplomatic corps. Sarkozy defended the ceasefire agreement: \"When I travelled to Moscow on August 12 - in midsummer - to obtain a halt to the fighting in Georgia, wasn't the fate of tens of thousands of men, women and children hanging in the balance?\" Sarkozy declared that Russia must fully observe the ceasefire agreement and called the Russian decision to \"unilaterally\" recognise breakaway states in Georgia \"quite unacceptable\". Sarkozy further stated, \"Nobody wants to return to the time of the Cold War.\" He said, \"NATO is not an adversary but a partner of Russia. As for the European Union, it seeks to build with this country a close and positive relation. It is for Russia today to make a fundamental choice.\"\nDuring the phone conversation between French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Russian President Medvedev, Sarkozy stressed the importance of the full implementation of the six-point plan.\nOn 28 August, Kouchner commented on the agenda of an extraordinary EU meeting convened on 1 September at France's initiative, \"Sanctions are being considered.\" This marked the first time when the country warm to Russia proposed a drastic action against Russia. Kouchner further stated, \"I do not want to prejudge the issue before the EU summit on Georgia has taken place. But we will work hard with our 26 partners to draft a strong statement that signifies our refusal to accept the situation in Georgia. France does not support breaking off relations with Russia. This will have to be sorted out through negotiation. This will take time, we are not deluding ourselves.\"\nKouchner told the BBC on 31 August that France would not endorse sanctions against Russia at the EU summit in Brussels, convened by France on 1 September, \"The situation is very difficult and... we must be firm on our position in offering a line defending, of course, territorial integrity of Georgia.\" Earlier, Kouchner had threatened sanctions.\nOn 8 September 2008, Sarkozy negotiated a new agreement with Medvedev to withdraw Russian troops from Georgia within month. Sarkozy was accompanied by José Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission, and Javier Solana, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. During meeting near Moscow, Sarkozy threatened Medvedev that he would just leave and could not be able to prevent Europe from implementing sanctions against Medvedev. According to Kouchner, Sarkozy finally managed to get Medvedev's signature on the ceasefire document.\nOn 16 September 2008, French Libération newspaper refused to print condolence text for the South Ossetian victims of the war, paid for by the Russian embassy in France.\nOn 19 September 2008, Prime Minister of France François Fillon said during his meeting with Putin in Sochi that France was pleased that Russia was fulfilling its obligations under Sarkozy-Medvedev agreement. Fillon announced that the European Union would resume negotiations with Russia in October 2008 if the Russian forces completely left undisputed Georgia.\nAn article published in Newsweek pondered what could have been achieved if any other country led the EU instead of France during the ceasefire negotiations because it was the great power status of France that compelled Russia to make some concessions.\nOn 27 September 2008, Bernard Kouchner commented on the Sarkozy-Medvedev ceasefire agreement, \"As we did not want to go to war, we had to accept a compromise... Do not think I am proud of getting that document.\" He further said, \"They, the Russians, resisted us. It would have been easy for them to go for the Georgian capital and take it. They were strongly prepared... [...] We'll see if it is a trap - if they do not implement the agreements they signed.\" Kouchner also said, \"In the EU we want to maintain a dialogue with Russia.\"\nOn 10 October 2008, Kouchner visited Georgia. He noted that Russia had only \"partly\" fulfilled its obligations as Russian forces had not left Akhalgori and Perevi.\nOn 13 October 2008, Kouchner announced that Abkhaz and South Ossetian representatives were invited to attend the talks in Geneva scheduled on October 15. The Russian Foreign Ministry official said that Russia would not attend the talks without Abkhaz and Ossetians.\nOn 21 October 2008, Sarkozy said at the European Parliament that Russian \"aim was to overthrow Mr. Saakashvili\" in August 2008. He continued \"Europe should no longer be an accomplice of another Cold War\" and \"I don't believe the world needs a crisis between Europe and Russia\".\nOn 22 October 2008, French minister Jean-Pierre Jouyet said that Georgia's NATO membership was \"not in the interests of Europe or its relations with Russia.\"\nIn November 2008, Sarkozy declared at a ceremony in Paris, \"I remember the American president's call the day before our departure for Moscow: 'Don't go there, they [the Russians] want to go to Tbilisi, they're 40km away. Don't go, [just] condemn it'.\" Sarkozy further said, \"When someone had to leave for Moscow or Tbilisi, who defended human rights? Was it the President of the United States who said, ‘this is unacceptable’? Or was it France which kept up the dialogue [with Russia]? . . . We were in Moscow and, as if by chance, the ceasefire was announced.\"\nIn July 2009, Georgian town of Sachkhere awarded the title of honorary citizen to French Ambassador to Georgia Eric Fournier for his defense of the Sachkhere military training center against the Russian invaders in August 2008.\nWikiLeaks revealed in November 2010 that according to the US ambassador's report, French president Sarkozy had grabbed Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and called him a liar during negotiations in August 2008.\n|-\n|  || On 8 August, Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said that he was \"appalled by the escalation of violence\" and demanded that \"all combat has to be ceased immediately\".\nSteinmeier said on 10 August, \"We face the danger of a dangerous conflagration.\" Deputy Foreign Minister Gernot Erler accused Georgia of noncompliance with a 1992 ceasefire agreement, calling it \"a question of a violation of international law\". Although Erler conceded to South Ossetian provocation, he still endorsed Russian position.\nEckart von Klaeden, foreign policy spokesman for the Christian Democratic Union in parliament, said Russia was also responsible for the crisis.\nThe German Foreign Ministry announced that 200 German citizens had left Georgia and another 300 were remaining. Italian and Polish citizens were evacuated by their countries.\nGerman chancellor Angela Merkel urged self-control on August 8. On 11 August, German chancellor Angela Merkel conveyed her concern about the humanitarian situation in Georgia and urged to cease war.\nBrigadier General Heinz G Wagner, the German military attache in Moscow, authored an internal paper on 11 August, in which he called the Russian military action in Georgia \"appropriate\". He wrote, \"The extent of the use of military force by the Russian side appears &ndash; seen from here and despite reports to the contrary from Georgia and the picture conveyed by the media &ndash; not inappropriately high.\"\nMerkel's spokesman said on 14 August that Georgia's territorial integrity was \"sacrosanct for Germany.\"\nChancellor Angela Merkel said during her meeting with Medvedev on 15 August, \"to say that I found some of Russia's actions disproportionate and in particular think the presence of Russian troops in Georgia proper is not sensible. Russian troops should withdraw from central areas in Georgia.\" But she said, \"Both sides are probably to blame.\" She said that NATO's offer to Georgia to become alliance's member still held. Merkel saw alleged proof of Georgian atrocities provided by Russians, but she only commented that \"every war is terrible.\" Merkel also told the news conference, \"We very much want the six-point plan to be implemented very promptly so that Russian troops are no longer in Georgia, outside Abkhazia and South Ossetia.\"\nFormer Chancellor Gerhard Schröder claimed by August 16 that the conflict began with \"Georgian invasion of South Ossetia\". When asked if he thought \"the American military advisors stationed in Tbilisi encouraged Georgia to launch its attack\", he responded, \"I wouldn't go that far. But everyone knows that these US military advisors in Georgia exist &ndash; a deployment that I've never considered particularly intelligent. And it would have been strange if these experts had not had any information. Either they were extremely unprofessional or they were truly fooled, which is hard to imagine.\" He said, \"I assume that no one in the Moscow leadership has an interest in military conflicts.\" He went on to say that \"there have indeed been serious mistakes made by the West in its policy toward Russia.\" He described Saakashvili as a \"gambler\", and claimed that Russia was not pursuing annexation.\nChancellor Merkel arrived in Georgia on 17 August. She urged Russia to comply with the ceasefire agreement signed on 16 August. Merkel said, \"The cease-fire was signed by President Medvedev on Saturday and this must happen in the next few days.\" Merkel said at Georgian president's palace on 17 August, \"I expect a very fast, very prompt withdrawal of Russian troops out of Georgia.\" Merkel stated that \"this process should not drag out for weeks.\" Merkel said, \"This is an urgent matter.\" Merkel said that international peacekeepers must be promptly deployed to Georgia. She also backed Georgia's aspiration for NATO membership. Saakashvili called Merkel \"brave\".

The very scale of this cynicism is astonishing -- the attempt to turn white into black, black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims.\" Putin continued, \"They of course had to hang Saddam Hussein for destroying several Shiite villages. But the current Georgian rulers who in one hour simply wiped 10 Ossetian villages from the face of the earth, the Georgian rulers which used tanks to run over children and the elderly, which threw civilians into cellars and burnt them -- they (Georgian leaders) are players that have to be protected.\" An anonymous American official said that the United States had notified Russia in advance of the return of Georgian soldiers from Iraq.\nVladimir Putin said that the West had failed to hear the Russian warnings that \"the Georgian side was preparing aggression\" and Russian \"peacekeeping\" operation would be continued until \"its logical end\".

They brought shame upon themselves as peacekeepers. They committed crimes.\" Lavrov also said the \"only way\" to end war was resignation of Saakashvili in addition to complete Georgian retreat from South Ossetia, \"It would be best if he left. I don't think Russia will feel like talking with Mr. Saakashvili after what he did to our citizens.\" Lavrov said: \"The status quo in South Ossetia and Abkhazia is no longer possible.\"\nRussian officials accused the United States of encouraging Georgia's military action in South Ossetia.

The operations which were carried out by a reinforced Russian peacekeeping brigade have ended because the goal that we set for ourselves has been achieved. The aggressor has been punished and its armed forces are disorganized.\" After the meeting, Medvedev declared, \"Before I talk about the results that we achieved today, I would like to emphasize that our meeting is taking place within a new status quo.\" Medvedev accused Saakashvili of lying about the observance of the ceasefire for 2 days and called Saakashvili a \"lunatic\" who had \"smelled blood.\" Medvedev responded to the western calls for respecting the territorial integrity of Georgia by saying, \"Ossetians and Abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account, including what happened in the past few days.\" He criticized the West for supporting Georgia, \"International law should not permit the use of double standards.\" Sarkozy welcomed Medvedev's announcement of ending the Russian operation and said, \"A ceasefire now has to take shape. We must draw up a rapid calendar so that each side can go back to the positions of before the crisis.\" The Georgian Prime Minister in Tbilisi reacted by saying: \"We will need more evidence, everyone in this situation needs a signed binding agreement. Until that happens we are mobilised, we are prepared for everything.\" Anatoly Nogovitsyn said \"The peacekeeping measures being carried out now are meant to weaken the military potential of the aggressor to a level that will not allow him even to think about repeating his attempts to occupy.\"\nRussian Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov told BBC, \"We still have diplomatic relations with Georgia, we have millions of Georgian nationals who are Russian citizens and living happily in Russia. But we won't directly talk to Saakashvili, we won't do that. We offered him peace but not friendship.\"\nBy 13 August, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov declared, \"We understand that this current Georgian leadership is a special project of the United States. but one day the United States will have to choose between defending its prestige over a virtual project or real partnership [with Russia].\" Lavrov said, \"Bush's speech said nothing of how Georgia was armed all these years, including by the United States. We have more than once warned our partners that this is a dangerous game. Mr Bush said nothing about what had happened on August 8, when Western leaders maintained silence when Tskhinvali became a target of massive bombing. The Western political elite got excited only after the Russian leadership decided not to leave its peacekeepers to their fate, not to allow... ethnic cleansing as it had happened in Srebrenica.\"\nSergey Lavrov said on 13 August, \"Georgia - of course, not Georgia, but the Georgian leadership - gave an order which led to an act of genocide, which resulted in war crimes, ethnic cleansing. And this, of course, cannot go unanswered.\" Lavrov said, \"Upon the withdrawal of Georgian troops to their barracks, Russian troops will return to the territory of the Russian Federation. Our peacekeepers will remain in South Ossetia.\"\nRussian Defence Ministry officials said that the Russian warplanes were shot down by Ukrainian military using the Ukrainian-supplied weaponry. Ukrainian authorities denied the allegation.\nSeparatist leaders Sergei Bagapsh and Eduard Kokoity visited the Kremlin on 14 August to approve the EU-brokered peace plan. President Medvedev told Bagapsh and Kokoity that \"I'd like you to know, that we support any decision taken by the peoples of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. We will not only support them, but guarantee them in the Caucaus and in the whole world ... Right is on your side.\" Medvedev said that the UN charter and the Helsinki Act would be taken into consideration. Foreign Minister Lavrov ruled out \"useless\" preservation of Georgia's territorial integrity which would be \"a deeply human insult.\" Lavrov also stated that day that \"it is impossible to persuade the Ossetians and Abkhaz to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the Georgian state.\" He continued, \"I can assure you that we don't want the collapse of Georgia, but the de facto situation is such that neither the South Ossetians nor the Abkhaz want to live in the same state with the person who has sent his troops against them.\"\nColonel General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn said at a news conference, \"We have information that American military transport aviation say they are delivering a certain humanitarian cargo to Tbilisi airport, though they said we had bombed the airport two days ago. Let's ask them will they invite you [the media] to check whether it is humanitarian or not?\" He said about the cargo, \"It is of major concern to Russians.\" Nogovitsyn's allegations were dismissed by Americans. Nogovitsyn called Ukrainian decree limiting Russian navy movements in the Ukrainian part of the Black Sea \"nonsense\". He also said, \"we are just watching the situation. There are still snipers out there, certain groups have gotten through, and the provocations are continuing. We will settle things with everyone, and right now establishing peace is the main issue.\"\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry stated that the future actions of the United States should not \"lead to the repetition of a tragic scenario.\"\nOn 15 August, the Russian Foreign Ministry stated that Medvedev would accept the ceasefire agreement. It was not known if the document had been modified. Russian military official said that \"there's absolutely no firing\" in Georgia. He also said that humanitarian aid would be sent to Gori. Russia was waiting for Saakashvili to sign the ceasefire agreement. Anonymous official from the Russian Foreign Ministry said \"The time for conversations has passed. The time for concrete action has come.\"\nPresident Medvedev met with Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany, in Sochi. Medvedev warned, \"If our peacekeeping troops and our citizens are attacked, we will respond in the future in the same way that we have responded. Let there be no doubt about this.\" Medvedev said, \"Russia, as guarantor of security in the Caucasus and the region, will make a decision that unambiguously supports the will of these two Caucasus peoples. Unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely Ossetians and Abkhaz can live in one state with Georgians.\" Medvedev said, \"We agreed with French President Sarkozy's main principles for resolving the conflict... These principles must be accepted by the Georgian side.\" Medvedev said, \"Peace needs to re-established in the region and guaranteed and underpinned so that no one again will get idiotic ideas, and this I see as the main task of the Russian Federation.\" Medvedev further said, \"We have the impression that Saakashvili is opposed to the diplomacy of the past 15 years.\" Medvedev said that Russia was not against better relations with the West. Medvedev responded to Merkel, \"We are of course not against international peacekeepers... but the problem is that the Abkhazians and the Ossetians do not trust anyone except for Russian peacekeepers.\"\nRussian General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn said that Poland \"is exposing itself to a strike\" due to the placement of the American missile battery and that the nuclear weapons were allowed by military doctrine of Russia \"against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them.\" The Russian General Staff said by August 15, \"There is a presence of our armed forces near Gori and Senaki. We make no secret of it. They are there to defuse an enormous arsenal of weapons and military hardware which have been discovered in the vicinity of Gori and Senaki without any guard whatsoever.\"\nOn 16 August, Sergey Lavrov said that Georgian president had accepted a document which differed from the ceasefire agreement signed by Russian and French presidents. Lavrov told the reporters that the Russian military would remain in Georgia and their withdrawal was linked with \"extra security measures\" for Russian military in South Ossetia. Lavrov said on the duration of the departure of the troops, \"As much as is needed.\" Lavrov continued, \"This does not depend on us alone because we are constantly coming up against some problems on the Georgian side. Everything depends on how effectively and quickly these problems are solved.\"\nMedvedev put his signature on the ceasefire agreement negotiated by Sarkozy in Sochi.\nAnatoliy Nogovitsyn commented on the bridges destroyed in Georgia that they \"were the objects we tackled\", but denied the reports of Russia continuing military action against Georgia as \"a hoax\", further stating that \"Our work is devoted to peacekeeping problems.\" Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Andrei Nesterenko said Russian military would leave Georgia upon \"completing security operations\" to remove Georgian military ammunition and mines. Nogovitsyn said that Russian troops were preparing to withdraw from Georgia.\nAccording to the Kremlin, Medvedev told Sarkozy on 17 August that Russian military \"from tomorrow ... will begin withdrawing\". On 17 August, Anatoly Nogovitsyn commented on the Russian takeover of Enguri Dam that \"strategic facilities of this kind could be targeted in provocations and even terror attacks.\" In several hours after Nogovitsyn's statement, Medvedev announced that Russian forces would begin to pull out of Georgia the following day. Medvedev said that Georgians troops must withdraw to their permanent locations. Major General Vyacheslav Borisov said near Gori on the morning of 17 August that \"planned withdrawal\" endorsed by Medvedev had started. However, a spokesman for the Russian defence ministry soon stated that pullout had not yet started. Chairman of foreign affairs committee in the Russian parliament, Konstantin Kosachev, commented on the withdrawal of the Russian troops on 17 August that it would happen \"sooner or later\", \"But how much time it will take, it depends, definitely, on how Georgians will continue to behave.\"\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry called the statement of South Ossetian president Eduard Kokoity on the eviction of Georgians from South Ossetia \"an emotional statement made under the influence of the situation resulting from the massive armed attack organized by the Georgian leadership against South Ossetia.\"\nOn 18 August, Medvedev commented on the Georgian military action, \"We shall do our best to not let this crime go unpunished.\" He promised that attackers on the Russian citizens would \"face a crushing response\", by declaring in Kursk, \"If someone thinks they can kill our citizens, kill soldiers and officers fulfilling the role of peacekeepers, we will never allow this.\"\nRussian ambassador to NATO, Dmitry Rogozin, said that he would not ask for an extraordinary meeting of the Russia-NATO Council any more, \"We do not consider it possible to wait anymore for 'emergency assistance' that has failed to arrive for a week now.\" He said that the United States was responsible that the meeting was not held because Americans were afraid of questions, \"The American delegation did not even show up at a Preparatory Committee meeting.\"\nOn 19 August, Colonel General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn told the Interfax-AVN agency, \"We will not leave a single barrel, a single cartridge for Georgia, which initiated this bloodshed. Part of these arsenals, especially ammunition, will be destroyed and are already being destroyed. And as for the rest of the war trophies, we will use them as we please, in particular will take for ourselves part of the tanks and other armored vehicles that are in good condition.\"\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov commented on NATO's \"biased\" demands to withdraw Russian troops from Georgia, \"They blame us as if there were no requirements for the Georgian side in the six points. I mean the requirements to bring back their troops to the places where they are on a permanent basis.\" Sergey Lavrov said NATO was \"trying to make a victim of the aggressor, to absolve of guilt a criminal regime, to save a collapsed regime and is taking a course to rearm the current leaders of Georgia.\"\nThe Abkhaz parliament debated the issue of the recognition on 20 August and would ask Russia for the recognition. Speaker of upper chamber of the Russian parliament, Sergey Mironov, said that Russia would revise the status of the breakway regions, \"We have repeatedly heard the declarations of these peoples and we know the results of several referendums in South Ossetia.\" Russian representative to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, was refusing to accept a proposal for the Security Council resolution supporting Georgia's territorial integrity because \"completely different, more complex situation\" had emerged.\nRussia-NATO cooperation was frozen by August 21.\nOn 22 August, Anatoliy Nogovitsyn commented on Bush's statement on the Russian withdrawal that the secretary of the US president had to follow the Russian press-conferences more frequently.\nOn 25 August, the Russian State Duma discussed the status of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Boris Gryzlov, speaker of the Duma, claimed Georgia's military action in South Ossetia resembled the Nazi attack on the Soviet Union. The presidents of Abkhazia and South Ossetia addressed the Russian parliament. They said that they would not return to Georgia and urged Russian president Medvedev to recognize their independence.\nPresident Medvedev said that Russia could counter the threats from NATO and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said Russia could cancel some trade agreements necessary for acceding to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Sergey Mironov, the Federation Council speaker, said both Abkhazia and South Ossetia possessed all signs of statehood.\nMembers of the State Duma Vladislav Reznik and Yevgeny Alexeyevich Fyodorov dismissed the US threats of economic isolation of Russia for its actions in Georgia. Russian diplomat negotiating Russia's WTO accession threatened that Russia would hit back at the US if the latter did not support Russia's WTO membership.\nOn 26 August, President Medvedev said, \"We're not afraid of anything [including] the prospect of a Cold War. Of course we don't need that . . . Everything depends on the stance of our partners and the world community and our partners in the West.\" Medvedev commented on the aftermath of the recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, \"If they want to preserve good relations with Russia, they will understand the reason for taking such a decision and the situation will be calm.\" He claimed that \"a peaceful solution to the conflict was not in Tbilisi's plans. The Georgian leadership methodically planned for war. Saakashvili chose genocide to achieve his political ends.\"\nCNN asked Medvedev whether he would send Russian troops in other post-Soviet states and Medvedev responded, \"As to interfering in other areas, in other conflicts, of course we have no plans for such interference, and we will not do so. But Russia is an independent sovereign state and it has the right to decide what it has to do to promote its interests particularly in the areas along its borders.\" Medvedev told Al Jazeera, \"Russia does need good relations with the West – this is without any doubt. And the West needs good relations with Russia.\" Medvedev declared in a letter to the Financial Times, \"This was not a war of our choice. We have no designs on Georgian territory.\"\nAmerican military aircraft and sea vessels were ostensibly bringing humanitarian assistance to Georgia in order to send signal to Russia that it could not behave as it wished. President Medvedev told the BBC, \"What the Americans call humanitarian cargoes — of course, they are bringing in weapons. We're not trying to prevent it.\" However, such allegations were rejected by Americans.\nOn 27 August, the deputy chief of the Russian General Staff said that Russia was upholding a 1997 treaty with Ukraine regarding the Sevastopol naval base. He accused NATO of \"racketing up tension\" in the Black Sea, \"Now we have people flexing their muscles, demonstrating force ... We can only regret that.\" Russians expressed their concerns that there were more NATO ships than Russian ships in the Black Sea. The deputy chief of the Russian General Staff, Anatoliy Nogovitsyn, described at a briefing the limitations of naval entry and presence in the Black Sea set by Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits, adding, \"The convention stipulates a limited number of vessels. That is, the same state cannot deploy a certain group without any limit.\" Russian agriculture minister, Alexey Gordeyev, said that poultry and pork import to Russia would be reduced.\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in Dushanbe that Russia would withdraw from Georgia after international monitoring would have been established, \"We will be ready to make decisions, including in the United Nations...on additional increases in the number of international monitors, clarifying their mandate and possibly other steps with international participation.\" Spokesman for Vladimir Putin, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the international support of Russia's recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, \"To initiate wide support (for recognition) is not a primary goal. We're not going to twist anyone's hands to make them support (recognition).\"\nOn 28 August, Putin told CNN that the war was tragic, \"For us, it is a special tragedy, because [...] the Georgian people being a nation of ancient culture -- became, without a doubt, a part of the multinational culture of Russia\" and \"for us, there is even a tinge of a civil war\". He continued, \"We have never infringed on the sovereignty of Georgia and have no intention of doing so in the future.\" When Putin was asked whether Russia would attack other post-Soviet states, he objected, \"We have not attacked anyone. [...] We have no intention of attacking anyone, and we have no intention of going to war with anyone.\" Putin remembered his meeting with U.S. President George W. Bush during the Olympics. Putin accused U.S. President George W. Bush of staging the war in Georgia in order to get the Republican Party's 2008 U.S. presidential candidate Senator John McCain into the White House. Putin said, \"It is not just that the American side could not restrain the Georgian leadership from this criminal act. The American side in effect armed and trained the Georgian army.\" Putin further said, \"Why spend years holding difficult negotiations and looking for complicated compromises in ethnic conflicts? It's easier to arm one of the parties and push it to kill the other party, and the job is done.\" Putin said, \"U.S. citizens were indeed in the area in conflict. They were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered, and the only one who can give such orders is their leader.\" Putin responded to journalists that Russia was forced to attack Georgia in response to the death of the Russian peacekeepers. Putin said that the poultry products were tested by the Russians and 19 American companies would no longer be able to import to Russia, in addition to 29 other companies being given time to upgrade safety standards. However, Putin claimed the embargo was not linked to the war in Georgia.\nColonel-General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn said that Russian military discovered a passport belonging to the inhabitant of Texas fighting among Georgian special troops.\nPresident Medvedev asked the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation for the support, which would be a \"serious signal for those who are trying to justify the aggression.\" However, the declaration calling for the peaceful solution of the conflict and \"preserving the unity of a state and its territorial integrity\" was adopted by the summit.\nSergei Lavrov commented in Dushanbe on the possibility of sanctions being imposed on Russia, \"My friend Kouchner also said that we will soon attack Moldova and Ukraine and the Crimea ... But that is a sick imagination and probably that applies to sanctions as well. I think it is a demonstration of complete confusion.\"\nThe Kremlin released a statement reporting that there had been an earlier phone conversation between Medvedev and French president Sarkozy for about an hour. The statement said, \"The Russian side has stressed the need for Tbilisi to carry out point four of the Medvedev-Sarkozy plan, under which all Georgian troops should be returned to their original bases.\" The statement further said, \"Mr Medvedev and Mr Sarkozy also discussed additional agreements, which may in future ensure safety in the areas near the borders of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\" Sergei Lavrov said that German Chancellor Angela Merkel had not condemned Russian recognition of Georgia's separatist regions and Russian non-withdrawal from Georgia during \"constructive\" phone conversation with Medvedev a day earlier.\nPutin met with Russian journalists in Sochi on 29 August and reportedly downplayed the severity of the Western reactions. He reportedly said on the Sochi Olympics, \"Let them cancel it: we'll build one stadium instead of two;\" Putin reportedly stated on energy deals, \"We'll sell Central Asian gas to those who want it, including Asia;\" Putin reportedly commented on Russia's relations with the West, \"Don't worry, European leaders tell me that everything will be normal.\" Putin stressed that Russia could manage without the West, \"They cannot intimidate us.\"\nOn 29–30 August, President Medvedev held a phone conversation with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Medvedev in a statement asked for the deployment of European monitors to Georgia to observe \"the acts of the Georgian government.\" Vladimir Putin called on the European Union not to pay attention to proposals to hold Russia accountable for the war.\nOn 31 August, President Medvedev said that the recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia was irreversible and threatened retribution against any possible EU sanctions. Medvdev said, \"The absolute priority for us is the defense of the life and dignity of our citizens, no matter where they are located. [...] And everyone should understand that if someone launches an aggressive sortie, then he will receive a response.\" Vladimir Chizhov, Russian envoy to the EU, said that sanctions were \"highly improbable\". Russian ambassador to the UK Yuri Fedotov said that Russia did not want confrontation with the West and \"any sanctions [would] hurt the European Union first of all much more than Russia.\" Fedotov also said, \"Russia wants to be an equal partner... but the partnership should not be the kind of partnership between the horseman and horse, but of two equal individuals.\"\nBy early September, Vladimir Putin promised retribution against the NATO ships in the Black Sea. However, he did not specify the details of the retribution. Russia imposed trade sanctions on the West in apparent retaliation for the pro-Georgian stance of the West. Putin also reached agreements with Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan threatening the viability of the Nabucco pipeline.\nOn 3 September, Yuri Fedotov, Russian ambassador to the UK, stated that the Russian forces would leave the \"buffer zone\" only when international peacekeepers would be deployed in Georgia and the government of Georgia had accepted the treaty on non-use of force against South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Fedotov \"deplored\" the anti-Russian stance of the British Prime Minister and the British Foreign Secretary. He claimed to have communicated with the Foreign Office about the tensions before August 7 and that he was told that Saakashvili was \"under control\". However, Fedotov's story was denied by the Foreign Office.\nPresident Medvedev stated at the Kremlin that \"Russia is a state that has to be reckoned with from now on\" and that the \"world changed\". On 7 September 2008, Yury Luzhkov, Mayor of Moscow, said that Georgia and the United States should learn from the \"crushing\" defeat of Nazi Germany by Russia, \"Let that be a stern and appropriate reminder to those who surround Russia with their missiles and bases.\" Luzhkov further said, \"Let it be a warning to Saakashvili's regime.\"\nOn 11 September, Vladimir Putin held a three-hour meeting with journalists. He said that he met with US president Bush two times during the Olympics. During their first meeting, Bush said that \"No one wants war.\" After their second meeting in Beijing, Putin \"had the feeling\" that Bush \"wouldn't do anything about stopping the conflict.\" Putin accused the US for the conflict, \"They sent instructors who helped to mobilise the Georgian forces. Of course we had to respond.\" Putin warned Russia would retaliate against the installation of US missiles in Poland by targeting Poland. Putin said that the majority of Ukrainians didn't want NATO membership. Putin claimed that Medvedev was in charge, \"I am sorry it was his lot to have to deal with this crisis. [...] He had to give the order to send troops to these republics [South Ossetia and the other breakaway region of Abkhazia]. He had to recognise these republics, he couldn't do otherwise. These were his decisions.\" Putin said that Russia didn't intend to attack Tbilisi during the war. Putin denied that the war with Georgia was responsible for the crisis of the Russian financial markets. Putin said that he had discussed the recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia with Chinese officials on 8 August 2008. Putin also said that Russia had no \"imperial ambitions\", otherwise the Soviet Union \"would still exist today\". The Russian Foreign Ministry stated that the Ukrainian position on the war \"cannot be seen as anything other than unfriendly towards Russia\".\nOn 12 September, Dmitry Medvedev said, \"For Russia, August 8 was like September 11 for the United States. I would like to see major lessons from it for the world.\" Medvedev recounted the August 8 contact between him and George Bush. Medvedev claimed Georgian president Saakashvili was a drug-addict and was \"burdened with a host of pathologies\". Medvedev said that Russian recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia was necessary to prevent Georgian attack, \"If he takes this blood once he would try again if he was not muzzled.\" Medvedev accused Condoleezza Rice of encouraging Saakashvili, \"Rice met him and the boy changed miraculously afterwards. He started to postpone the agreement. He started preparations for war.\" Medvedev said that Georgia getting the NATO MAP would not have deterred Russia, \"I can assure you that as president I would not have wavered for a second to make the same decisions that I made back then.\" Medvedev commented on the Russia-West relations, \"I don't think this phase of confrontation will be lengthy.\" Medvedev asserted that Russia did not intend to annex South Ossetia. He voiced his displeasure over NATO's ties with Ukraine and Georgia because \"there is a major risk of separatism\".\nOn 15 September, Russian president Medvedev said that isolation of the Russian business from the international markets was a positive thing. He commented on Russia's application for membership in the World Trade Organization, which was being blocked by Georgia, by saying that \"WTO is not a carrot.\" Medvedev said that Russia was not some \"banana republic\" which could be affected by sanctions.\nOn 18 September, Medvedev said during a meeting with the new ambassadors to Russia that relations with the USA were important for Russia. He said that it was not worthy to quarrel over \"small things\". He said that Georgia's \"aggression\" was a \"challenge\" to the international community. The next day, Medvedev announced that Russia was no longer going to live behind the \"iron curtain\" instead of cooperating with other international players.\nOn 20 September, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko commented on Condoleezza Rice's speech at the Marshall Fund that Russia did not want to engage in anti-Americanism and self-isolation.\nBy late September, Russia had increased cooperation with Venezuela in retaliation to the US backing of Georgia.\nOn 6 November 2008, President Medvedev expressed his wish that the August war would not \"have any effect on Russia's relations with the European Union\" and said that \"this page needs to be turned over.\"\nFrench president Sarkozy reportedly convinced Vladimir Putin on 12 August not to follow through with his plans to depose the Georgian government and \"hang Saakashvili by the balls\". The information of this conversation between Putin and Sarkozy was made public by Sarkozy's team in November 2008 to back up the claims that the French involvement prevented the fall of Georgia. British journalist Luke Harding wrote in November 2008 that Saakashvili making fun of Putin as \"Liliputin\" before the war had probably caused Putin's desire to hang him. Dmitry Peskov, Press-Secretary of Putin, denied that Putin had threatened Saakashvili's balls.\nOn 19 December 2008, Sergey Lavrov declared that the resumption of Russia-NATO dialogue must begin with the discussion of the Georgian \"aggression\". Lavrov said on 23 December that the United States had promised Russia that NATO would never accept Georgia if the latter used force in South Ossetia and accused the US of reneging on this promise.\n|-\n| || According to Russian sources, Bandar bin Sultan told Putin in September 2008 that King Abdullah and the whole leadership of the country fully understood the actions of the Russian side in South Ossetia.\n|-\n|  || Oliver Ivanović, Serbian State Secretary of the Ministry for Kosovo and Metohija, stated on August 11, \"The question of Kosovo was didactic and inspirational for South Ossetia, so that they wanted to further strain the relations and define their position, which is understandable. Georgia has tried to solve the issue by using violence just as Serbia tried to do it in 1999.\" Countries that accept \"the violation of the international law and disregard of the sovereignty of states, as it was done in the case of Kosovo, they can expect the possibility that such a recipe will be applied in all other situations\".\nSerbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremić said on August 14 that Kosovo \"set a dangerous precedent for the solution of problems all over the world\" and \"the conflict in the Caucasus has shown the dangers of the militaristic approach to problem solving.\"\nOn 24 September 2008, Foreign Minister Jeremic said that Serbia would not recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia.\n|-\n|  || Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico claimed on August 13 that Georgia was guilty for the war and dismissed \"such a black and white perception, according to which one side is good and the others are bad.\" He called for a ceasefire.\n|-\n|  || Miguel Ángel Moratinos, Minister for Foreign Affairs, stated by August 9 that it is \"regrettable\" that the conflict in South Ossetia erupted \"during the Olympic truce\". On August 13, he called on the EU to send a message to both sides to start the \"political and diplomatic dialogue\".\n|-\n|  || Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs Carl Bildt said on August 8 that the crisis was due to provocations from the South Ossetian side and that Georgian forces were trying to restore the constitutional order. Bildt further stated, \"It is extremely important that all those involved show restraint and play their part in bringing about a political solution.\"\nOn 9 August, Bildt compared Russia's reason for going to war with Georgia to Adolf Hitler's actions, \"No state has the right to intervene militarily in the territory of another state simply because there are individuals there with a passport issued by that state or who are nationals of the state. Attempts to apply such a doctrine have plunged Europe into war in the past... And we have reason to remember how Hitler used this very doctrine little more than half a century ago to undermine and attack substantial parts of central Europe\". Bildt stated that there could be a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Paris on 11 August. Bildt told the BBC that non-rejection of Russia's claimed right to intervene in other countries could have \"devastating consequences.\"\nOn 18 August, Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt halted all exercises and military ties between Sweden and Russia, saying that \"the Russian invasion of Georgia is unacceptable and a violation of international law. The Russian action has changed the image of Russia as an international player.\"\nFollowing the Russian recognition of South Ossetia, Bildt warned that Russia opened Pandora's box impacting Russia itself and said, \"South Ossetian independence is a joke. We are talking about a smugglers' paradise of 60,000 people financed by the Russian security services. No one can seriously consider that as an independent state.\" He also said that Saakashvili had only \"made a tactical blunder that turned into a strategic disaster\".\nIn early September 2008, Swedish defense minister said that Sweden would revise its military doctrine due to the war in Georgia.\nIt emerged by October 2008 that the Russian officials were refusing to meet with Carl Bildt due to his stance on Russia.\nIn 2010, WikiLeaks revealed that Sweden wanted to expulse Russia from the Council of Europe before November 2008.\n|-\n|  || Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during his visit to Russia on August 20 accused the United States of using \"double standards\" with regard to Abkhazia and South Ossetia, stating that the West \"is ignoring for some reason the rights of the people of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.\" Assad added: \"In a situation when Georgia started the war, the position of Russia [...] was absolutely right.\"\n|-\n|  || Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said on August 8 that Turkey was alarmed by the conflict.

Ukrainian Defense Minister Yuriy Yekhanurov said that Ukrainian arms supplies to Georgia was legal since there was no international embargo against Georgia.\nOn 5 August, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine expressed its concern over recent incidents in the South Ossetian conflict zone and that the start of the conflict demonstrated ineffectiveness of the existing (Russian-dominated) peacekeeping format. Andriy Parubiy, member of the Verkhovna Rada from the Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc, suggested that Russian peacekeepers were occupying forces and therefore must be replaced with the GUAM troops.\nOn 8 August, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on all sides to cease fire immediately and to start solving the problem by negotiations. Ukraine confirmed its position of support of Georgian territorial integrity and sovereignty. Ukraine said on August 8 that Russia was \"gradually becoming a side of the conflict.\" The Foreign Ministry urged Russia to remove its military from Georgia and pressure the South Ossetian separatists to negotiations.\nPresident Viktor Yushchenko sent deputy Foreign Minister Konstantin Eliseev to Tbilisi on 8 August.

The statement also said: \"Ukraine has already been indirectly involved in this military conflict. The latest statements of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia and Russian statesmen and politicians (Dugin, Zyuganov, Luzhkov, Zatulin, etc) regarding our state and its integral part - the Crimean Peninsula - testify to exactly this.\"\nPresident Yushchenko authorized a humanitarian assistance to the civilian population of Georgia.

Tymoshenko claimed that Yushchenko's \"fight\" for reelection was to blame and that her position on Georgia was \"in line with the EU position, and is not to drag Ukraine into any conflicts.\" Supporters of Viktor Yushchenko declared that they would continue cooperation with the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc if the latter supported pro-Georgian resolution on the war. However, Tymoshenko's fraction leader Ivan Kyrylenko insisted that Georgia was the \"aggressor\".\nOn 4 September 2008, People's Deputy of Ukraine Iryna Herashchenko said that the Russian recognition of South Ossetia was a time bomb for Russia because the Parade of sovereignties in Russia was temporarily paused. She noted that South Ossetia's independence was recognized by only 4 entities: Hamas, Hezbollah, the Party of Regions and Russia.\nOn 5 September 2008, Foreign Minister Volodymyr Ohryzko accused Russia of distributing Russian passports to the residents of Crimea which could be used as a justification for military intervention.

I deplore this.\"\nBritish official said that an American-European delegation would arrive in Georgia on late 9 August to negotiate the cessation of hostilities.

There is now real danger of an all-out conflict between Russian and Georgian troops. There is also the risk of Abkhazia raising the stakes by cutting vital hydro-electricity supplies to Georgia. The UN must put pressure on Russia to pull back from the brink. If the Russians can show restraint, they will surely be well placed to offer negotiations.\"\nThe Foreign and Commonwealth Office stated on August 10, \"The offer of a ceasefire by the Georgian government is very welcome. We now look to the Russian Government to accept this offer and agree to an immediate ceasefire, in line with its international commitments to respect Georgian territorial integrity.\"\nPrime Minister Gordon Brown discussed Georgia with the French president and the UN Secretary-General. The Foreign Office called on the British citizens to evacuate from Georgia while airlines were still working.\nOn 11 August, Prime minister Gordon Brown said in a statement, \"There is no justification for continued Russian military action in Georgia, which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe. There is an immediate and pressing need to end the fighting and disengage all military forces in South Ossetia.\" He also said, \"The Georgian government has offered a ceasefire, which I urge the Russians to reciprocate without delay.\" David Cameron, leader of the Conservative Party, called Russia \"massive and dangerous bully\", and \"the only language a bully understands is when someone stands up to them\". Cameron predicted, \"If you say 'This is Russia's backyard, this is a faraway country of which we know nothing, there's not really much you can do', if you take that sort of attitude, you will have more problems with Russia further down the line.\"\nLabour MP for Rotherham Denis MacShane wrote, \"By ordering a full-scale military invasion of Georgia, [Putin] has revealed the true face of his autocratic rule.\"\nOn 12 August, British Ambassador Denis Keefe approved the announcement of the cessation of hostilities by Medvedev, adding, \"This is a beautiful place with a wonderful people. They don't deserve the suffering that has been inflicted by military operations.\"\nDavid Cameron said the Russian actions were \"completely unacceptable\". He urged the British Government to restrict visas for Russian citizens and advised several options regarding Russia. He said at his press-conference, \"The situation is clear, hundreds have been killed. Russia has used massive and disproportionate force…Countries that want international respect do not attack their neighbours. History has shown time and time again that if you leave aggression to go unchecked, you only store up graver problems for the future. Russia says it is fighting in defence of Russian citizens in South Ossetia. Who will they claim to be defending tomorrow? Russians in the Ukraine, Russians in the Baltic states who are already members of the EU and Nato? This is a dangerous doctrine with worrying echoes from the darkest chapters of European history.\" However, Downing Street later rejected the proposal to withhold entry visas from Russian nationals. Instead, the idea of \"smart sanctions\" against the separatist officials of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, installed by the Kremlin, was discussed.\nForeign Secretary David Miliband said on 12 August that the Russian forces should pull back to positions held before 7 August. Miliband said that Russian leaders must let the \"Soviet past\" go. He criticised the Russian \"19th Century forms\" of conduct and warned of consequences. He continued, \"The sight of Russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighbouring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people, rightly.\" Miliband supported the territorial integrity of Georgia.\nOn 13 August, the United Kingdom announced that joint naval exercises with Russia would no longer be held.\nForeign Secretary David Mlilband welcomed Russia's signing of the ceasefire agreement on 16 August 2008. Miliband was \"concerned\" by recent Russian actions in Georgia.\nOn 19 August, Foreign Secretary David Miliband met with Georgian president Saakashvili in Tbilisi. Miliband informed Saakashvili about NATO extraordinary meeting and condemned Russia for not pulling back from Georgia. Miliband said: \"Every day that goes by after the deadline ... is a day that the world can see that Russia is not living up to its word.\" Miliband further said: \"The world is asking Russia to live up to its commitments. With every commitment and with every failure to live up to that commitment, the international pressure will grow. A country relies on the word of its president being its bond.\"\nOn 20 August, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband stated that \"the formal process\" began that would lead Georgia's NATO membership and commented on the future of Georgia-NATO cooperation. Miliband saw Georgian internally displaced persons near Tbilisi and listened to their stories of suffering and then called for an independent investigation into \"random killings\" around Gori.\nOn 27 August 2008, Foreign Secretary David Miliband visited Ukraine and discussed the war in Georgia with Ukraine's president. Miliband's visit aimed to prevent a crisis from developing in Crimea. He gave a speech in Kiev vigorously condemning Russia, stating that Europe's relations with Russia would no longer be the same as before. He condemned Medvedev's recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, \"[Medvedev's] unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance. It is not just the end of the post-cold war period of growing geopolitical calm in and around Europe. It is also the moment when countries are required to set out where they stand on the significant issues of nationhood and international law.\" Miliband said that starting a new cold war would be a \"big responsibility\" for Russian president Medvedev. Miliband compared Russia's attack on Georgia to the invasion of Czechoslovakia. He called for Russia to \"change course\". Later, Miliband said on BBC Radio 4 that the ideas of spheres of influences were \"anathema\" from the Second World War. Miliband denied that NATO's aim was to surround Russia and that his arrival in Ukraine to \"support their democratic choices\" was a provocation towards Russia who considers its neighbours as \"enemies or vassals\".\nIn late August 2008, Gordon Brown said that the Western relationship with Russia should be revised, saying, \"When Russia has a grievance over an issue such as South Ossetia, it should act multilaterally by consent rather than unilaterally by force. My message to Russia is simple: If you want to be welcome at the top table of organisations such as the G8, OECD and WTO, you must accept that with rights come responsibilities.\"\nOn 1 September 2008, David Cameron urged EU meeting to sanction Russia harshly. He told BBC Radio 4, \"The only language a bully understands is when you stand up to them.\"\nIn early September 2008, The Daily Telegraph reported that Foreign Secretary David Miliband was insulted by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov during their phone conversation.\nMalcolm Rifkind wrote on 5 September 2008: \"However, if we are not careful, we may end up with a new Crimean War in the not too distant future. [...] A tough reaction by the West over Georgia and South Ossetia is necessary because Russia will be emboldened to repeat its behavior if it sees the West as weak.\"\nIn September 2008, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office prohibited the participation of British Army bagpipers in the International Military Music Festival \"The Kremlin Zorya\" held in Russia. Brigadier Melville Jameson of the Edinburgh Military Tattoo and Vitaly Mironov of the Kremlin Zorya Foundation accused Foreign Secretary David Miliband of \"playing politics\" in a cultural event.\nTony Brenton, the British Ambassador To Russia, said on 22 September that the entire West thought that Russian use of force was \"disproportionate\".\nOn 27 September 2008, David Miliband denied the report that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had used F-word with him. He further said, \"We have a very strong interest in Russia being engaged - especially on Iran. We don't want a weak and humiliated Russia. We've always tried to reach out to Russia.\"\nIn October 2008, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband, after being informed of BBC findings of alleged Georgian war crimes reported by Ossetians and initially calling Georgia's actions \"reckless\", he added that \"the Russian response was reckless and wrong\". Miliband noted, \"It's important that the Russian narrative cannot start with Georgian actions; it has to start with the attacks on the Georgians from the South Ossetians and that is the tit-for-tat that got out of control.\"\nWilliam Hague warned that resumption of negotiations with Russia while Russia was in violation of the ceasefire agreement \"would show Russia that aggression pays off\". Anonymous European diplomat was quoted as saying: \"If we sell Georgia like that, we will have another war and who will be responsible for that?\" In November 2008, William Hague again argued against the resumption of negotiations on the EU-Russia cooperation without any preconditions for Russia.\n|-\n|  || United States Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried said on August 7, \"It appears that the South Ossetians have instigated this uptake in violence. We have urged the Russians to urge their South Ossetian friends to pull back and show greater restraint. And we believe that the Russians&nbsp;... are trying to do just that. We're urging the Georgians to exercise restraint, but it seems the South Ossetians are the provocative party.\"\nUnited States Department of State spokesman Gonzalo Gallegos said, \"We're urging Moscow to press South Ossetia's de facto leaders to stop firing. We're urging Tbilisi to maintain restraint.\"\nJoe Biden, the head of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, said that the conflict was provoked by the South Ossetian rebels. Biden also said: \"Moscow has a particular obligation to avoid further escalation of the situation.\" Howard Berman, chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, urged the cessation of hostilities and Russian withdrawal. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen was not surprised by Russia's aggressiveness and proposed the deployment of the international peacekeepers to the region.\nWhite House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said on 8 August, \"All sides should bring an immediate end to the violence and engage in direct talks to resolve this matter peacefully.\"\nPresident of the United States George W. Bush had a conversation with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin during the Beijing Olympics. The United States had asked Russia at the UN Security Council meeting not to allow irregular fighters from Russia to enter South Ossetia. Vladimir Putin told George Bush in Beijing that \"many volunteers\" would enter South Ossetia and it would be \"very hard to maintain peace\". According to the White House spokesman Dana Perino, there was an hour-long phone conversation after the opening ceremonies between Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the national security adviser Stephen Hadley. Dana Perino said that the United States called on \"all parties, Georgians, South Ossetians and Russians to de-escalate the tension and avoid conflict.\" The US were \"working on mediation efforts to secure a cease fire and we are urging the parties to restart their dialogue.\"\nSecretary of State Condoleezza Rice urged the ceasefire and stated on 8 August, \"We call on Russia to cease attacks on Georgia by aircraft and missiles, respect Georgia's territorial integrity, and withdraw its ground combat forces from Georgian soil.\" She also said that the United States was talking with Europe and the sides of the conflict to halt the hostilities. Gonzalo Gallegos, a spokesman for the State Department, said the American delegate would be dispatched to the Caucasus \"to engage with the parties in the conflict\". Matthew Bryza, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, was being dispatched to negotiate cessation of hostilities.\nJohn McCain, the US presidential candidate, stated, \"Russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign Georgian territory. What is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between Russian and Georgian military force. The consequences for Euro-Atlantic stability and security are grave. [...] Finally, the international community needs to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in South Ossetia.\"\nBarack Obama, the US presidential candidate, said in a statement, \"I strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in Georgia, and urge an immediate end to armed conflict. Now is the time for Georgia and Russia to show restraint, and to avoid an escalation to full-scale war.\" Obama called to respect the territorial integrity of Georgia. Obama also said that \"What is clear is that Russia has invaded Georgia's sovereignty, has encroached on Georgia's sovereignty, and it is very important for us to resolve this issue as quickly as possible.\" Analysts compared the statements of both presidential candidates and extrapolated their decision-making. Both candidates were probably betting their victory on the conflict. Approval ratings of McCain rose by mid-August because McCain had tougher stance on Russia, while Obama chose to vacation on Hawaii.\nAnonymous American military official observing the Russian actions in the conflict zone prior to the war commented, \"The build-up of forces was more than expected and they moved earlier than we thought they would.\" US military officials were considering how to evacuate around 3 thousand US citizens from Georgia and the US embassy issued a warning not to travel to the conflict zones. American forces present in Georgia were not participating in the conflict. The US trainers were not participating in the conflict between Russia and Georgia. The United States Department of Defense said that Georgia had not requested an aid. The Pentagon and the United States European Command were observing the developments. The Pentagon announced on 11 August that they had been analyzing the war in Georgia in order to decide the evacuation of up to hundred American military trainers.\nThe former United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, commented on Russia's intentions, \"They have two goals. To do a creeping annexation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and, secondly, to overthrow Saakashvili, who is a tremendous thorn in their side.\" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Zalmay Khalilzad said, \"We deplore the Russian military action\".\nAccording to the State Department statement, the Russian chargé d'affairs was called by the deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte. The statement said, \"We deplore today's Russian attacks by strategic bombers and missiles, which are threatening civilian lives.\"\nOn 9 August, an anonymous senior American representative commented on Russia's actions against Georgia, \"It is simply not acceptable to reject an offer of a cease-fire and international mediation.\" Senior official commented on the possibility of military aid to Georgia, \"We are not talking about anything beyond diplomacy at this point.\" Official said that Russian woes about NATO expansion might have been behind Russia's \"disproportionate\" action in Georgia. President George W. Bush called the Russian bombings a dangerous escalation. Bush said in Beijing, \"The attacks are occurring in regions of Georgia far from the zone of conflict in South Ossetia. They mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis. [...] Georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected. We have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand-down by all troops. We call for an end to the Russian bombings, and a return by the parties to the status quo of August the 6th.\" Gordon Johndroe, White House spokesman, stated American president had talked to both Russian and Georgian presidents.\nPresidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama talked to Georgian president Saakashvili independently by phone on 9 August. McCain declared in a statement, \"Tensions and hostilities between Georgians and Ossetians are in no way justification for Russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border.\" McCain stated that this was his second talk with Saakashvili after the invasion. McCain also said, \"For many years, I have warned against Russian actions that undermine the sovereignty of its neighbors. Unfortunately, we have seen in recent days Russia demonstrate that these concerns were well-founded.\" Obama said in a statement, \"I condemn Russia's aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire. [...] Russia also must end its cyber war against Georgian government websites.\" Obama supported the idea of international peacekeepers in Georgia and that the crisis was due to the \"lack of a neutral and effective peacekeeping force operating under an appropriate UN mandate.\"\nAnonymous American official said that Russia had notified the US of deployment of the Black Sea Fleet to Abkhazia. One American official commented: \"Why that's a legitimate use of military assets is beyond me.\" Another official stated that \"There is panic in Tbilisi\", and added Russia used Tupolev Tu-22 supersonic bombers and ballistic missiles in Georgia. Anonymous American official told the CNN that the use of Russian strategic bombers outside the disputed region was \"far disproportionate\" \"response to the charge that Georgia has attacked Russian peacekeepers\" and such \"dangerous escalation\" possibly intended to punish Georgia for NATO aspirations. The official reported that Europe viewed Russia as having \"crossed a line of unacceptable behavior\" and this was \"an emerging unified view among our key allies\".\nThe impact of the Georgian withdrawal of 2,000 servicemen from Iraq on the coalition operations would not be significant, according to the US military.\nOn 10 August, Jim Jeffrey, deputy national security adviser, stated, \"We have made it clear to the Russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the Russian side continues, that this will have a significant long-term impact on U.S.-Russian relations.\"\nUS envoy to the UN, Zalmay Khalilzad, said at the fourth Security Council meeting on the war that Abkhazia participated in a \"Russian-based military offensive\" in the Kodori Gorge and this constituted a \"direct challenge to a UN Security Council-mandated mission.\" Khalilzad said, \"We believe the Security Council must take urgent action. We must condemn Russia's military assault on the sovereign state of Georgia.\" At the UN Security Council meeting, Zalmay Khalilzad accused Russia of having \"regime change\" goal in Georgia and of thwarting peace efforts. Khalilzad said that Lavrov had told Rice on the morning of 10 August \"that a democratically elected president of Georgia -- and I quote -- must go.\" Khalilzad asked Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin whether Russia sought to depose Georgia's government. Churkin admitted that a \"confidential phone call\" took place and said that high-ranking government officials sometimes \"become an obstacle.\"\nThe United States approved of the Georgian pullout from South Ossetia. Dana Perino, White House Spokesman, stated in Beijing, \"That is one of the conditions that needed to occur so that we could have a cease-fire. This, if true, could help us lead to a peaceful solution.\" Bush had spoken with the Chinese officials. The United States said that Russian response to the Georgian pullout from the conflict zone would serve as a major indicator of the actual goals of Russia in South Ossetia.\nGeorgian president Saakashvili told the German newspaper that he had \"full support\" of US president Bush, adding: \"He understands that it's not really about Georgia but in a certain sense it's also an aggression against America.\" Analyst Janusz Bugajski said that Russia wanted to see the US reaction to Russia's \"re-imperialization\".\nBill Kristol suggested in an opinion piece to \"consider the implications of our turning away from Georgia for other aspiring pro-Western governments in the neighborhood, like Ukraine's. [...] Is it not true today, as it was in the 1920s and ’30s, that delay and irresolution on the part of the democracies simply invite future threats and graver dangers?\"\nOn 10 August, Vice President Dick Cheney said in a phone conversation with Saakashvili, \"Russian aggression must not go unanswered, and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the United States, as well as the broader international community.\" The statement of Cheney's office said on 11 August, \"The vice president praised President Saakashvili for his government's restraint, offers of cease-fire, and disengagement of Georgian forces from the zone of conflict in the South Ossetian region of the country.\"\nOn 11 August, Richard Holbrooke declared that Russia deliberately provoked the war to coincide with the Olympic Games and Russia's next target would be Ukraine.\nOn 11 August, George W. Bush told NBC in Beijing, \"I was very firm with Vladimir Putin -- he and I have got a good relationship -- just like I was firm with the Russian president. I expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of Russia and that we strongly condemn, you know, bombing outside of South Ossetia. It was just interesting to me that here we are, trying to promote peace and harmony, and we're witnessing a conflict take place.\" Bush also told NBC, \"My administration has been engaged with both sides of this trying to get a ceasefire.\" Bush told Putin on 8 August that \"This violence is unacceptable\" and that all forces withdraw to the August 6 \"status quo ante.\" However, Russian military action in Georgia did not stop. On 11 August, Bush on his return trip from Beijing talked with the leaders of the United Kingdom, Lithuania, Poland and phoned Saakashvili. Bush also talked with Silvio Berlusconi and Angela Merkel on the next day.\nJohn McCain stated that \"the very existence of independent Georgia and the survival of its democratically elected government are at stake\" and warned Russia of \"long-term negative consequences\" on Russia's international standing. McCain declared that Russian action aimed at \"toppling the Democratically elected government of Georgia\" was \"unacceptable to all the Democratic countries of the world, and should draw us together in universal condemnation of Russian aggression.\" He stated: \"NATO's decision to withhold a membership action plan for Georgia might have been viewed as a green light by Russia for its attacks on Georgia, and I urge the NATO allies to revisit the decision.\" McCain concluded his remarks by saying: \"World history is often made in remote, obscure countries.\" John McCain had threatened by 11 August that the Group of Eight would exclude Russia.\nBarack Obama stated, \"No matter how this conflict started, Russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over South Ossetia and invaded another country.\" An anonymous State Department official compared the current Russian invasion to the historical invasions by the Soviet Union.\nMore than 170 American citizens were evacuated from Georgia by the United States Department of State. Although the families of American diplomats were permitted to evacuate Georgia over the weekend, the State Department stated that diplomats would not leave the country. A third evacuation convoy to Armenia was arranged on 12 August.\nUS president George W. Bush said on late 11 August, \"There's evidence that Russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city.\" George Bush expressed his concern in a statement that recent \"dramatic and brutal escalation\" by Russia \"would be inconsistent with assurances we have received from Russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo in South Ossetia that existed before fighting began on August the 6th.\" Bush said, \"It now appears that an effort may be underway to depose [Georgia's] duly elected government. Russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people. Such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century.\" Bush urged Russia to \"reverse the course it appears to be on\" and sign the EU-mediated ceasefire agreement, otherwise Russia would \"jeopardise\" its standing with the West. Bush, who had few options how to respond to Russian actions, made this statement in an hour after his arrival from Beijing. Georgian president Saakashvili had already accepted the ceasefire agreement before Bush's statement. The BBC reported that the \"strongest\" American official statement \"aimed at drawing a line in the sand\" to avert the unseating of the government of Georgia.\nSecretary of State Condoleezza Rice discussed the war with the foreign ministers of the G-8 by phone. Robert Wood, State Department spokesman, said that foreign ministers supported Georgia. The ministers urged Russia to agree to the ceasefire meanwhile expressing anxiety over the fate of civilians. Wood also said that although the U.S. would evacuate Georgian soldiers from Iraq, \"there are no discussions about the U.S. getting involved militarily.\" Russia was not invited to a phone conference of the G7. A spokesman for the State Department stated, \"We want to see the Russians stand down.\"\nZalmay Khalilzad approved Vitaly Churkin's statement that Russia did not intend to depose the government of Georgia, but warned \"there is a range of tools in the toolbox\" in case of non-cessation of hostilities by Russia.\nAs Georgian president Saakashvili was expressing his frustration with weak international reaction to the Russian advance into Georgia, western diplomats arrived in Tbilisi on August 11. Deputy US Assistant Secretary Matthew Bryza criticized Russian advances, \"What does this have to do with protecting Russian peacekeepers and passport-keepers?\" Bryza promised aid to the Georgians. Matthew Bryza said that he now knew that Russian \"railroad troops\" entered Abkhazia months ago \"to establish a supply line for a Russian invasion.\" Bryza accused Russia of lying about its actions. He accused South Ossetian peacekeepers of attacking Georgian villages. Bryza stated that Russian military did not stop attack despite Georgia's offer of ceasefire and he could not \"understand how Russia wants to be seen as a reliable supplier of natural gas to Europe, when it has made several attempts to blow up the BTC (Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan) pipeline.\" He denied American guilt for Georgian military action against South Ossetian separatists. The US Embassy in Georgia, describing a Matthew Bryza press conference on 12 August, called the war an \"incursion by one of the world's strongest powers to destroy the democratically-elected government of a smaller neighbor\".\nAmerican officials said that Russia was provoking Georgia and the United States \"have always counseled restraint to the Georgians,\" even sending Condoleezza Rice to Georgia to temper the Georgian leadership from overreacting. One State Department official said, \"We thought we had an understanding with the Russians that any response [to Georgian military action] would be South Ossetia-focused. Clearly it's not.\" Virtually no satellite spying was carried out in the region since the United States concentrated on other countries and therefore could not detect the deployment of the Russian forces to the Georgian border. American military trainers were remaining in Georgia because as American official said, \"removing them might inadvertently signal to the world that we are abandoning our ally, which we most certainly are not.\"\nAnonymous Pentagon official told the CNN that the Russian air strikes had destroyed the Georgian military command system and the Georgian authorities could not know the situation on the ground.\nOn 12 August, John McCain said in a press release, \"Georgia asked for a ceasefire, and Russia responded by bombing the Tbilisi Airport.\" He declared, \"today, we are all Georgians.\" McCain said in an interview: \"Of course we have to deal with Russia and we deal with Putin. But it has to be on a very realistic basis. And not one that there's any illusions about his ambitions.\" McCain then stated that \"Russian ambitions are to restore the old Russian Empire.\"\nCondoleezza Rice told ABC News that Russian \"military operations need to stop\". Rice stated that the United States \"stands for the territorial integrity of Georgia\" and \"so forces that arrived after August 6 need to move back to their pre-August 6th positions.\" She said that Russia damaged its prospects for integrating into international organisations and Russian actions were from \"another time\", further adding, \"We are not in 1968 and the message has been very clear to Russia that it cannot operate that way.\" Rice later said \"The Georgians have agreed to a ceasefire, the Russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will, but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored.\" U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Bryza commented in Tbilisi on possible US military intervention: \"I hope we'll never come to the question of what we do if Russia refuses to observe international law.\"\nThe State Department called the Russian invasion \"plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of Russia\".\nA naval exercise with the participation of France, the United Kingdom, the United States and Russia planned on 15–23 August in the Sea of Japan would no longer be held. A senior American official said, \"In the wake of this conflict, there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time.\"\nOn 13 August, Matthew Bryza in Tbilisi said \"incredible reports of serious violence\" had emerged from South Ossetia and he believed them.\nPresident George W. Bush declared, \"I've just met with my national security team to discuss the crisis in Georgia. [...] The United States of America stands with the democratically elected government of Georgia.\" Bush was alarmed \"about reports that Georgian citizens of all ethnic origins are not being protected.\" Bush said that after visiting France, Condoleezza Rice would visit Georgia to \"continue our efforts to rally the free world in the defense of a free Georgia.\" Bush deployed American military to Georgia to supervise a \"vigorous and ongoing\" humanitarian assistance, adding, \"We expect Russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport, including seaports, airports, roads, and airspace, remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit.\" Bush expected Russia would observe the ceasefire and further stated, \"Russia's ongoing action raise serious questions about its intentions in Georgia and the region.\" Bush said the United States had supported Russia \"to integrate into the diplomatic, political, economic, and security structures of the 21st century,\" however, Russian attack on Georgia, which was \"inconsistent with the principles of those institutions\", put these efforts \"at risk\". Bush stated, \"To begin to repair the damage to its relations with the United States, Europe, and other nations, and to begin restoring its place in the world, Russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis.\" Earlier, the deployment of mid-level official Matthew Bryza to Georgia had been criticized as a weak signal to Russia. Bush's order to deploy American military to Georgia apparently intended to counter Russia's sway in the Caucasus. A vacation on Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, earlier planned to start on 14 August, was delayed. That day, American plane Boeing C-17 Globemaster III was the first transporter to bring supplies to Tbilisi. A senior official from the Pentagon said that the goal of the humanitarian assistance was \"to show to Russia that we can come to the aid of a European ally, and that we can do it at will, whenever and wherever we want.\"\nPresident Bush did not order Rice to visit Moscow. Rice notified the Russian Foreign Minister about the humanitarian aid. Condoleezza Rice declared at the State Department, \"This is not 1968, and the invasion of Czechoslovakia, where Russia can invade its neighbor, occupy a capital, overthrow a government and get away with it. Things have changed.\" American officials stated that Russian bid for membership of the World Trade Organization would probably be reconsidered and membership of the Group of Eight would be reexamined. Rice also said that day, \"I don't think that there's any doubt that Russia has already in its actions called into question some of its desire to be integrated into these institutions.\" Rice said in the afternoon, \"Right now, the key is to remind Russia that it has an obligation to stop its military activities, remind Russia that it is not to further engage in activities that threaten the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia.\" Rice endorsed the statements by both McCain and Obama, \"I know that they are at this moment of difficult diplomacy that they are doing what they can to support the efforts of the administration.\" White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said that Rice would depart on the evening of 13 August. Before her departure for Tbilisi, Rice also stated, \"If indeed Russia is violating a ceasefire, and I have to say the reports are not encouraging about Russia's respect for the ceasefire ... that will only serve to deepen the isolation to which Russia is moving.\"\nSaakashvili's allegations of the United States taking over Georgian sea ports and airports were dismissed by the American officials. Dana Perino said that America \"had credible reports that Russia is violating the cease-fire agreement, including, as (Bush) mentioned, the bombing of vessels and the blocking of the port, which we're very concerned about.\"\nOne senior American official commented that the fifth point of the French-negotiated ceasefire agreement could be used by Russia to gain further ground in Georgia and that international recognition of Russian troops in Georgia as peacekeepers \"is absurd at this point.\" An Atlantic Council member said: \"The last thing Russia wants is a war with the West. If they came eye to eye with NATO warplanes, they would retreat.\"\nOn 14 August, Condoleezza Rice held a meeting with French president Sarkozy during the afternoon. She said, \"It is time for this crisis to be over. The Russian president has said that their military operations have halted. We would hope that he is true to his word and that those operations will halt.\" Sarkozy gave Rice the ceasefire agreement. After meeting with Sarkozy, Rice said, \"The United States of America stands strongly, as the president of France just said, for the territorial integrity of Georgia.\" She said, \"We will work very hard to see if we can bring an end to this crisis. It is long overdue. Too many innocent people have died. And Georgia, whose territorial integrity and independence and sovereignty we fully respect, must be able to get back to normal life.\" Rice was visiting Georgia in order to compel the Georgian leadership to accept the French-brokered ceasefire agreement, which would grant additional powers to Russian peacekeepers outside of South Ossetia within undisputed Georgia. Anonymous official said that some changes to the ceasefire agreement could be made. Former US ambassador to NATO Robert E. Hunter said although the European ceasefire proposal mostly stopped the hostilities, it left \"the Russians in total control,\" since \"There is nothing in here about the inviolability of Georgia's frontiers.\" According to Le Canard enchaîné newspaper, Condoleezza Rice had raised a matter with Sarkozy over the ambiguity of the ceasefire agreement regarding the territorial integrity of Georgia. Rice-Saakashvili talks in Tbilisi was attended by Saakashvili's adviser Daniel Kunin, son of Madeleine Kunin.\nSpokeswoman Dana M. Perino commented on Sergey Lavrov's remark about forgetting of Georgia's territorial integrity, \"I would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of Russia. We will ignore it.\"\nAmerican diplomat Matthew Bryza told the BBC, \"Russia, a country with 30 times the population [of Georgia] decided to roll into its much smaller neighbour and tried to roll over it. It failed to roll over Georgia, but it would never have even thought of doing this if Georgia were already a member of Nato.\"\nOn 14 August, United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said that the American endeavors to create \"an ongoing and long-term strategic dialogue with Russia\" would be reconsidered. He said, \"If Russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in Georgia, the U.S.-Russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come.\" He dismissed the possibility of the US military intervention in Georgia. Gates suggested that Russian real aim was to warn Georgia and other former Soviet states against \"daring to try to integrate with the West.\" Gates said, \"The United States spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with Russia. I see no reason to change that approach today.\" Gates said that the Defense Department \"will re-examine the entire gamut of our military-to-military activities with Russia and will make changes as necessary and appropriate, depending on Russian actions in the days ahead.\" Gates further said that Russia was \"interested in reasserting Russia's, not only Russia's great power or superpower status, but in reasserting Russia's traditional spheres of influence.\" Gates was asked whether Putin could be depended on anymore, and he responded \"‘Anymore’ is an interesting add. I have never believed that one should make national security policy on the basis of trust.\" Gates also said that day, \"This year [the clashes between Georgians and Ossetians] escalated very quickly and it seemed to me that Russians were prepared to take advantage of an opportunity and did so very aggressively.\" Gates and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff James Cartwright expressed hopes that American military in Georgia would not have to exercise the right of self-defense.\nAn anonymous US official told the Associated Press that Russia was intentionally acting to incapacitate the defeated Georgian military. Aides to President Bush accused Russian officials of lying about Russia's actions. Concerns were raised that the Russian invasion of Georgia would put the US-Russia cooperation on terrorism and nuclear disarmament at stake. President Bush visited the Central Intelligence Agency to overview the situation on the ground in Georgia. Bush said that Rice would report to him after returning from Georgia.\nOn 15 August, US president George W. Bush made a statement supporting Georgia. Bush explained the rationale behind the U.S. support of Georgia by saying that Georgia was \"a courageous democracy and \"The people of Georgia have cast their lot with the free world, and we will not cast them aside.\" Bush declared, \"A contentious relationship with Russia is not in America's interests, and a contentious relationship with America is not in Russia's interests. [...] Bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century. [...] To begin to repair its relations with the United States and Europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world, Russia must respect the freedom of its neighbors.\" Bush had made three statements regarding Russia in the Rose Garden of the White House between 11 and 15 of August since his arrival from Beijing. Bush talked with Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of Estonia, by phone. After making the statement, Bush left the White House for Texas and Condoleezza Rice was expected to arrive in Texas on early 16 August. Gordon Johndroe, White House deputy press secretary, said on Air Force One, \"We need to see where this all ends up. We are hopeful that we can continue cooperation with the Russians _ and that's across the board. But a lot of this depends on Russia, and what Russia's actions are in the near future. Right now their actions have been inconsistent ... with the fundamental principles of a Europe whole, free and at peace. So cooperation on a wide range of issues going forward depends on the actions that Russia takes.\" Bush also supported Georgia in his weekly Saturday radio address, which was released on 15 August by the White House.\nState Department official said that Rice would deliver improved version of the ceasefire agreement not allowing Russia \"to maintain a presence inside Georgia\" to Tbilisi. Rice arrived in Tbilisi on 15 August. Rice held a five-hour meeting with Georgian president Saakashvili in Tbilisi. She promised economic help instead of military one. During the meeting between Rice and Saakashvili, Russian armoured vehicles pushed towards Tbilisi. Georgian president Saakashvili was compelled to agree to the ceasefire agreement, which was hazy about the Russian withdrawal to prewar positions. Rice said, \"Our most urgent task today is the immediate and orderly withdrawal of Russian armed forces and the return of those forces to Russia. With this signature by Georgia, this must take place - and take place now.\" Rice said that international monitors and peacekeepers should enter Georgia. Rice said at the uncompleted presidential palace that the \"free world\" would discuss how to bring \"profound implications\" upon Russia at the same time as nine Russian armoured personnel carriers were advancing towards Tbilisi. She stated, \"You can't be a responsible member of institutions that are democratic and underscore democratic values and on the other hand act in this way against one of your neighbours.\" Rice said she had been informed that Russian president Medvedev would accept the same ceasefire agreement that Saakashvili had signed. Saakashvili called Russians \"barbarians\" as he stood alongside Rice. After leaving Georgia, Rice then visited president George Bush at Crawford in Texas.\nOn 16 August, John McCain accused Russia of attempting to sabotage energy delivery routes and said that America should not be reliant on foreign supplies.\nBush stated in Crawford that \"Russia has put its aspirations at risk.\" Bush welcomed the ceasefire agreement on 16 August as \"hopeful step\" and declared, \"Now Russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces, and of course end military operations. [...] Georgia's borders should command the same respect as every other nation's. There's no room for debate on this matter.\" National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe stated that Bush spoke with the Prime Minister of Canada and President of Latvia.\nCondoleezza Rice said, \"From my point of view and I am in contact with the French the Russians are perhaps already not honouring their word.\" Rice stated that the ceasefire agreement only allowed original Russian peacekeepers stationed in the conflict zone before 7 August to monitor defined parts of the conflict zone. According to Rice, French president Sarkozy was told by his counterpart that Russia would pull out as soon as the ceasefire was signed by Georgian president Saakashvili. Robert Gates stated that the ceasefire agreement was still working, \"There don't seem to be any aggressive Russian actions occurring.\"\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on 16 August that the Russian invasion of Georgia fueled support for the acquisitions of the modern weapons, such as planes, by the United States.\nFormer diplomat Richard Holbrooke had commented on the Russian compliance with ceasefire by 17 August, \"If they violate their own agreement, that has even more serious consequences. Each hour, each day, is a test.\"\nOn 17 August, Robert Gates said, \"I think that there is a real concern that Russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future, and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance.\" He added that the US would \"e-evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with Russia.\" Gates said that Putin \"clearly, as far as I'm concerned, has the upper hand right now\" and had \"his hand on the steering wheel\". He commented on the disputed regions that \"no one should try and force them back into a full relationship with Georgia\". Gates called the Russian nuclear threat against Poland \"empty rhetoric\" and said: \"The truth of the matter is, Russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody. The Poles know that. We know it.\"\nCondoleezza Rice said, \"Well, I just know that the Russian president said several days ago Russian military operations would stop. They didn't. This time I hope he means it. You know the word of the Russian president needs to be upheld by his forces.\" Rice made a lengthy comment on Medvedev's announcement of the withdrawal and also said: \"If Russia thought it was going to be able to bring down the Georgia state, bring down the democratic institutions, it has failed. [...] If the Russians intended this as intimidation, they have done nothing but harden the attitudes of the small states around them. I think the Russians have made a significant mistake here.\" Rice also said that \"people are going to begin to wonder if Russia can be trusted.\" Before leaving for NATO meeting in Brussels, Rice said, \"Russia's reputation as a potential partner in international institutions, diplomatic, political, security, economic, is frankly, in tatters. Russia will pay a price. We will look seriously with our allies and bilaterally at the consequences of this Russian action ... Georgia will rebuild, Russia's reputation may not be rebuilt.\" George Bush did not make any statement regarding Georgia on 17 August.\nTwo Congressmen Allyson Schwartz and Bill Shuster said they would propose a resolution that Russia must be stripped of the right to host 2014 Winter Olympics for Russian military invasion of Georgia before the opening of the Beijing Olympics. An ex-envoy to the United Nations, John R. Bolton, stated that the US government failed to cope with the invasion properly and Russia should not get away even in case of pullout from Georgia. An ex-functionary from the White House stated: \"The United States is not going to go to war with Russia over the borders of South Ossetia and so the tools available to us are largely diplomatic. For all those critics who claim the Administration has not relied sufficiently on diplomacy, this is what it looks like when there are few good military options and one has to rely primarily on diplomacy.\"\nAmerican officials stated that impartial international peacekeepers should be put in place of the Russian peacekeepers in the conflict zones of Georgia. Deputy national security adviser James Franklin Jeffrey had told reporters by 17 August that after President Bush was told of Russia having used two SS-21s in Georgia, Bush \"immediately\" discussed the matter with Vladimir Putin in Beijing on 8 August.\nBy 18 August, White House spokesman Gordon D. Johndroe urged Russia to respect its commitment to withdrawal: \"If it rolled in after Aug. 6, it needs to roll out.\"\nOn 18 August, Condoleezza Rice said en route to the NATO gathering that Georgia's NATO membership wouldn't be on the agenda of the meeting. Rice said that Russia was oppressing its neighbours by \"using the one tool that it has always used when it wished to deliver a message.\" Rice said, \"I think the very fact of the alliance meeting and considering what steps it will take to assist Georgia will send a very clear message.\" Rice said: \"We have to deny Russian strategic objectives, which are clearly to undermine Georgia's democracy, to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy Georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the Georgian state.\" Rice said that the NATO meeting would confirm to the Eastern European members that they were \"now out of Russia's reach.\" Rice said, \"The effort to somehow assert Russian power or influence by military means is something we've been seeing for a while.\" Rice also called Russian deployment of strategic bomber patrols off the coast of Alaska since Kosovo's recognition a \"very dangerous game\". One anonymous administration official said that Vice President Dick Cheney's office had been considering to increase military assistance to Georgia before August 2008, while Rice was opposed to such move. Anonymous official said, \"But now Russia's actions have turned even the doves into hawks.\" Official said that although Georgia's military capabilities were not a match for Russia, \"we can help them better defend themselves.\"\nOn 19 August, Condoleezza Rice stated after the meeting of the NATO council, \"It is time for the Russian President to keep his word to withdraw Russian forces from Georgia, back to the August 6/7 status quo ante and to return, in fact, all forces that were not in South Ossetia at the time of that – of the outbreak of that conflict. That means that Russian peacekeepers “who were there” are one thing, but those who reinforced in some way into the zone of conflict should also return to the status quo ante. [...] it's quite clear that Russia has become a party to this conflict.\" Rice further stated, \"So the United States doesn't seek to isolate Russia. The behavior of Russia in this most recent crisis is isolating Russia from the principles of cooperation among nations of the communities of states when you start invading small neighbors, bombing civilian infrastructure, going into villages and wreaked havoc and wanton destruction of this infrastructure. That's what isolates Russia.\" Rice approved the NATO statement. Rice said in an interview with CBS News that Russia would be the \"outlaw\" of the conflict.\nA spokesman for the National Security Council, Gordon Johndroe, urged Russia to quickly withdraw from Georgia, \"It didn't take them really three or four days to get into Georgia, and it really shouldn't take them three or four days to get out.\"\nAfter his visit to Georgia on 18 August, Senator Joe Biden announced proposal to give $1 billion aid to Georgia and that there would be grave consequences for Russia's actions. He announced on 20 August that the Jackson–Vanik amendment would no longer be repealed.\nCondoleezza Rice was expected to sign an agreement with Poland on 20 August to install anti-missile shield in Poland. Similar military agreement between the US and the Czech Republic had already been signed.\nWhite House spokesman Gordon Johndroe commented on the Russian withdrawal during his trip to Florida, \"We are beginning to see the early signs of some withdrawal. It is not significant and it needs to increase.\" President Bush told a meeting of Veterans of Foreign Wars in Florida that Abkhazia and South Ossetia \"must remain a part of Georgia.\" Condoleezza Rice commented on Medvedev's statements in an interview with CNN, \"First, his troops were going to be out on Monday, then his troops were going to be out on Wednesday, now his troops are going to be out on Friday. I'm beginning to wonder if the Russian president is ever going to keep his word, or can he keep his word, or what is going on there?\"\nSenator Joe Lieberman met with Georgian president Saakashvili in Tbilisi and proposed that the United States supply Georgia with armaments.\nOn 21 August, Spokesman Gordon Johndroe said in Crawford, \"The withdrawal needs to take place, and needs to take place now.\" Georgian president Saakashvili was told by Bush on the phone that he \"expects Russia to abide by its agreement to withdraw forces.\"\nThree U.S. Navy ships carrying humanitarian aid were sent to Georgia through the Turkish Straits. A spokesman at the U.S. naval base in Crete, Paul Farley, said the warships would arrive in Georgia \"within the next week,\" but he didn't reveal the harbor where the ships would dock.\nHenrietta H. Fore, the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, stated, \"We anticipate staying as long as there is need and helping to set up the economy, because it's very important that the economy begins to take on its normal aspects. But it depends on our ability to do full assessments throughout Georgia.\"\nBy 22 August 2008, the new US Ambassador to Russia, John Beyrle, claimed in an interview with Russian newspaper Kommersant that the initial Russian \"reaction\" to Georgia's \"attack\" was legitimate, however, \"Russia has gone too far\". Beyrle said that the US \"did not want all this to happen.\" However, the US embassy in Moscow stated that the words of the ambassador were incorrectly translated.\nRichard Holbrooke wrote that \"Public commitments to help rebuild Georgia are the best way to prevent Russia\" from toppling Saakashvili.\nSpokesman Gordon Johndroe said on August 22 that Bush spoke with Sarkozy and \"the two agreed that Russia is not in compliance and that Russia needs to come into compliance now. They have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory, and they need to do that.\" Robert Wood, State Department spokesman, said on August 23 that Russians \"have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations. Establishing checkpoints, buffer zones, are definitely not part of the agreement.\"\nAlthough Russia claimed that it had withdrawn from Georgia by 23 August, checkpoints remained in Georgia. Gordon Johndroe criticized Russia for this. American diplomat Matthew Bryza told Ekho Moskvy radio, \"I think what Russia has done now is the strongest catalyst it could have created to get Georgia in NATO.\" The U.S. position on Russian withdrawal was supported by Germany, with one German official saying, \"Russia has begun its withdrawal from Georgia, but not completed it.\" Germany had suggested the EU to arrange a donor's conference for Georgia. The United States Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez said Russian participation in the Group of Eight and its chances to join the World Trade Organization would be influenced by its actions in Georgia, \"That is all at risk now.\"\nOn 23 August, Barack Obama questioned the Russian claims of the withdrawal from Georgia and called on Russia not to jeopardize Russia's standing.\nOn 25 August, the Pentagon declared that Russia had not complied with the ceasefire agreement and Russian troops had not been pulled out from Georgia. It was announced that George Bush was sending Vice President Dick Cheney to visit Georgia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan. Defense Department spokesman Bryan Whitman said on 25 August that the daily cost of humanitarian mission to Georgia was now $1 million and the total expenditure was $18.3 million as of 25 August 2008. Whitman said the Defense Department had disbursed about $7.2 million for the aid. The State Department issued a travel warning for Americans.\nThe White House said that the recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia could be carried out only by the United Nations.\nOn 26 August, George Bush condemned the recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia by Russia. The presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama also condemned the Russian recognition.\nOn 28 August, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino commented on the Russian accusation that the war was provoked by the United States to get John McCain elected, \"To suggest that the United States orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate – it sounds not rational.\" Perino commented on Russian military officials who had told Putin of American military participation in the conflict, \"Those claims first and foremost are patently false, but it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice.\" State Department deputy spokesman Robert Wood said, \"Russia is responsible for the crisis. For the Russians to say they are not responsible for what happened in Georgia is ludicrous. ... Russia is to blame for this crisis, and the world is responding to what Russia has done.\"\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Michael Mullen, stated that the US would continue military cooperation with Georgia, which was \"a very important country to us\". On 2 September 2008, The New York Times reported that according to officials from the Pentagon, State Department and White House, the Bush administration was considering how to restore Georgia's military capabilities, however, no verdicts were yet made.\nOn 3 September 2008, the government of the United States declared that $1 billion humanitarian and economic aid would be provided to Georgia to restore the civilian infrastructure. The aid did not envision any military assistance to Georgia. 61 American planes and two ships had already brought $30 million worth of humanitarian assistance to Georgia, such as 1,200 tons of food and provisions. Bush had decreed that federal agencies insure ships arriving in Georgia. Condoleezza Rice stated, \"The free world cannot allow the destiny of a small independent country to be determined by the aggression of a larger neighbor.\" It was expected that the United States would no longer observe the agreement with Russia on nuclear cooperation.\nOn 4 September 2008, during his visit to Georgia, Dick Cheney called the Russian invasion as \"an illegitimate, unilateral attempt\" to alter the borders of Georgia. Cheney stated, \"Russia's actions have cast grave doubts on Russia's intentions and on its reliability as an international partner.\" Cheney said that the US would support Georgia in joining NATO. Cheney's visit demonstrated the strong US support of Georgia and Cheney stated, \"Now it is the responsibility of the free world to rally to the side of Georgia.\" Cheney also met with American forces delivering the humanitarian assistance during his four and half hour-long visit to Georgia. Anonymous official accompanying Cheney said that economic assistance to Georgia was far more important rather than military one and issues regarding the distribution of American humanitarian assistance subsided. As of 4 September 2008, about $38 million worth of American humanitarian aid had been brought to Georgia. Cheney's goal was to lobby for the building of a new gas pipeline in the Caucasus avoiding the Russian soil during his tour. Cheney also visited Ukraine on 5 September 2008 where a political crisis was provoked by the Russian invasion of Georgia. Cheney said that the United States was on the side of Ukraine and supported Ukraine's NATO membership. After meeting with President Yushchenko, Cheney said that Ukraine must not yield to Russia's \"threat of tyranny, economic blackmail and military invasion or intimidation.\" Yushchenko told Cheney, \"On the majority of the issues, including Georgia, we have an understanding with the United States.\" Cheney also met with Ukraine's Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. Condoleezza Rice said in Portugal that Russia's failure to abide by the agreement was \"deepening its isolation\".\nOn 6 September 2008, Dick Cheney spoke of Russia's \"brutality\" in reasserting itself.\nOn 9 September 2008, Pentagon spokesman Brian Whitman announced that American military humanitarian operation in Georgia ended. 62 air flights and 3 ship dockings had taken place during the humanitarian operation.\nOn 9 September, Eric S. Edelman, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, told a Senate Committee on Armed Services that the United States had to \"Demonstrate to Russia that its aggressive actions do not serve its national interest, will not be tolerated, and will not be cost free.\" He stated that the first ever invasion by post-Soviet Russia was \"a chilling message\" about \"a new aggressiveness\" of Russia who was willing to resort to military means for attaining its objectives.

Since 1991, three U.S. administrations have based policy toward Russia on the assumption that Russia – perhaps in fits and starts, imperfectly and in its own way – sought to become a nation integrated with the world: a “normal nation,” that is, part of the international system and its institutions. [...] But with its invasion of Georgia, its continuing refusal to implement the Ceasefire it has signed, and its apparent claim to a “sphere of influence,” Russia has put these assumptions under question and these aspirations at risk.\" Congressman Brad Sherman said that Georgia's neighbor Armenia had also suffered from the conflict and proposed financial aid for Armenia.\nOn 10 September 2008, Kurt Volker, United States Permanent Representative to NATO, stated, \"it has now been four weeks since Russia first promised on August 12 to implement the cease-fire and to withdraw its forces. We still haven't seen it yet.\" He further stated, \"The agreement reached on August 12 says that the Russians need to withdraw to the positions before August 6. That means that they would have some troops in South Ossetia and in Abkhazia, but they would not have combat forces and they would be at the level that was pertaining at that time.\"\nOn 11 September 2008, some representatives in the United States Congress questioned the US support of Georgia, with Hillary Clinton saying that it was not \"smart\" to punish Russia.\nOn 11 September 2008, Republican candidate for Vice President of the United States Sarah Palin said that the US had \"to keep an eye on Russia\" due to Russian invasion of Georgia.

When journalist asked whether Georgia was worthy to be defended against new Russian invasion, Palin responded that \"smaller democratic countries that are invaded by a larger power is something for us to be vigilant against.\"\nOn 18 September 2008, the U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said at the German Marshall Fund in Washington that Russia was in violation of the ceasefire agreement. Rice said that Russia's \"deeply disconcerting\" attempt to \"dismember\" Georgia was a part of \"a worsening pattern of behavior\", and this signaled that Russia was becoming \"increasingly authoritarian at home and aggressive abroad.\" Rice stated that \"Russia's behavior cannot be blamed either on NATO enlargement.\" She further stated that it \"has become clear\" that \"the legitimate goal of rebuilding the Russian state has taken a dark turn\" and the decisions of the Russian leadership \"could put Russia on a one-way path to self-imposed isolation and international irrelevance.\" Rice said that the West \"must stand up\" to \"the prejudices that some Russian leaders seem to have: that if you press free nations hard enough – if you bully them, and you threaten them, and you lash out – they will cave in, and they'll forget, and eventually they will concede.\" Rice pledged that the West \"must not allow Russia's aggression to achieve any benefit\" and would aid the reconstruction of Georgia. Rice stated that the West \"will not allow Russia to wield a veto over the future of the Euro-Atlantic community – neither what states are offered membership, nor the choice of states that accept it. We have made this particularly clear to our friends in Ukraine.\" Rice suggested that Russia's future membership of the World Trade Organization had been put in doubt by the Russian leadership's \"nostalgia for another time\". Rice had notified Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov of this speech in advance. Russian Foreign Ministry official Andrey Nesterenko had claimed prior to Rice giving her speech that the US were warming towards Russia and that the new US position had \"signs of realism and a balanced approach are now showing\".

Justification of Russia's actions in Georgia by the need to protect its citizens is unacceptable. Alleged reasons for taking up a war against Georgia raise concerns about the future in every state with Russian citizens living on its territory. We are concerned and disappointed with the actions and behaviour of Russia, as an important actor in the politics of the region and the whole world, which will inevitably have effect on further bilateral and multilateral relations with this country.

Swedish and Danish foreign ministers criticized Russia for not reducing its military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

Germans were \"parroting\" Russian position. Latvia pushed for NATO giving weapons to Georgia. Countries such as the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and the UK were critical of Russia. Countries such as France, Germany, Greece, Italy and the Netherlands supported Russia. One European diplomat revealed that many European countries were not pleased with the ceasefire agreement prepared by Sarkozy. Franciszek Gągor, chief of Polish General Staff, asserted that there were possible Russian spies in the inner circle of Georgian president Saakashvili.\n|-\n|  || In the afternoon of 7 August 2008, the NATO called on Georgian and South Ossetian sides to restrain themselves from resorting to violence.\nNATO's official website posted the following statement from the NATO Secretary General on 8 August 2008, \"The NATO Secretary General, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, is seriously concerned about the events that are taking place in the Georgian region of South Ossetia and said that the Alliance is closely following the situation. The Secretary General calls on all sides for an immediate end of the armed clashes and direct talks between the parties.\" NATO spokesman Carmen Romero said NATO maintained contact with the leaders of Georgia and Russia.\nFormer US Ambassador to NATO Robert E. Hunter said: \"No one (within NATO) wants to fight for Georgia ... They see it as being too far away.\"\nThe BBC wrote on 10 August that \"emissaries from [...] Nato members are hardly likely to be seen as honest brokers by the Kremlin, when it comes to Georgia.\"\nOn 11 August, NATO spokesman said that Scheffer was \"seriously concerned about the disproportionate use of force by the Russians and the lack of respect for the territorial integrity of Georgia.\" Spokesman further said, \"The military operations that we saw on Saturday and since then, including air and missile attacks, have no relation to and go well beyond the CIS peacekeeping operation.\"\nAfter 26 NATO ambassadors had met Georgian ambassador on 12 August, Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said that ambassadors supported Georgia \"in very strong terms\" and \"condemned and deplored (Russia's) excessive, disproportionate use of force\" against \"a friend ... and a highly respected partner of NATO.\" Scheffer said that Russian announcement to halt its operation was positive news, but \"not enough\". Scheffer stated, \"Abkhazia and Ossetia, if I mention territorial integrity, are to the best of my knowledge part of Georgia.\" He further stated that \"Nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict\". NATO stated that Georgia would still join NATO. Scheffer told a news conference, \"I think that the Bucharest communique stands. And no ally will do anything away from the Bucharest declaration ... That situation has not changed.\" Scheffer said that the prospect for Georgia joining NATO was still \"very much alive\". Scheffer said that a future NATO-Russia Council meeting had to be \"properly prepared.\" Anonymous German and French diplomats, whose countries were spearheading diplomatic attempts to resolve the crisis, stated that the war significantly lowered the probability of Georgia's membership.\nOn 14 August 2008, the NATO barred Russian ship from participation in the naval exercises in the Mediterranean Sea in response to the Russian invasion of Georgia.\nOn 19 August, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said, \"The Nato membership was clear that Russia had violated international laws as well as the rules of the international game.\" He said that Russian failure to pull out from Georgia helped to reach a consensus at NATO meeting and that NATO would give fresh support to Georgia. Miliband also said, \"I am not one that believes that isolating Russia is the right answer to its misdemeanour. I think the right answer is hard-headed dialogue.\" The United States had pushed for more serious punishment at NATO meeting. After the meeting, held at Condoleezza Rice's initiative, the statement of the ministers was issued, which said Russian action was \"inconsistent with its peacekeeping role\" and international treaties. NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said, \"there can be no business as usual with Russia under present circumstances. And the future of our relations will depend on the concrete actions Russia will take to honour the words of President Medvedev, to abide by the six-point peace plan, which is not happening at the moment, which is not happening as we speak.\" Scheffer further said, \"the Alliance is considering seriously the implications of Russia's actions for the NATO-Russia relationship.\" NATO froze official ties with Russia and NATO would not hold any new joint NATO-Russia gatherings before the pullout of Russian army from Georgia. However, NATO did not undertake enduring punitive measures against Russia because of Europe's energy policy. NATO ministers agreed to set up a NATO-Georgia Commission that would be in charge of the relations between the NATO and Georgia. Scheffer stated that \"Russian forces should go back to their positions on the 6th of August.\" 50 NATO experts would visit Georgia to review the situation on the ground. Dmitry Rogozin, Russian envoy to NATO, called the meeting a \"mountain that gave birth to a mouse\", adding, \"All of these threats that have been raining down on Russia turned out to be empty words.\" In response to NATO, Russia did not participate in a joint exercise in the Baltic Sea. Russia did not admit American naval vessel near the Kamchatka Peninsula.\nNATO representative Carmen Romero said on 21 August 2008 that NATO had received a note from Russia that Russia was halting cooperation with NATO.\nOn 27 August, a spokesman for the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, Lieutenant Colonel Web Wright, said that four NATO vessels were participating in an exercise in the Black Sea. However, he added, \"Obviously, there are other NATO-affiliated nations out doing things. But I can't speak for those nations.\"\nOn 8 September, NATO delegation was scheduled to arrive in Georgia to assess the military destruction.\nOn 15 September 2008, Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said before his arrival in Georgia that NATO would tell both the Georgian government and opposition to \"strengthen democracy\". He told the Financial Times that it was \"difficult to swallow\" the new reality on the ground, \"If the Russians are staying in South Ossetia with so many forces, I do not consider this as a return to the status quo.\" Scheffer said at the first gathering of the NATO-Georgia Commission in Tbilisi that Georgia's accession to NATO would be \"accelerated\", but he did not set any specific date. Scheffer declared, \"Russia's use of force was disproportionate and Russia must now comply with all elements of the six-point plan. At the same time, despite the difficult situation, we expect Georgia to firmly stay the course of democracy and reform.\" In response to the NATO meeting in Tbilisi, the Russian Foreign Ministry accused NATO of encouraging Georgia to undertake \"new adventures\" and criticized NATO Secretary-General for visiting Gori, Georgia. Russian ambassador to NATO Dmitry Rogozin said that granting MAP to Georgia could lead to the NATO-Russia war.\nUnited States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates commented on NATO members' attitude towards Russia in detail on 18 September 2008. Russian ambassador to Afghanistan suggested that Russian air space would be closed for NATO transit to Afghanistan by saying that Russia's air space was \"still open, but if the NATO countries continue with their hostile policies with regard to Russia, definitely this issue will happen.\" Before the start of a meeting in London on 19 September, Gates told Sky News that new Russian attack on Georgia after joining NATO would cause an American military response. On 19 September 2008, NATO would discuss the creation of the Rapid reaction forces to be deployed in member countries bordering Russia to defend them from Russian invasion.\nOn 10 October 2008, the first meeting of the NATO-Georgia council was held in Budapest.\nAt the NATO Parliamentary Assembly session in Valencia on 18 November 2008, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer stated: \"Trustful NATO-Russia relations are a strategic asset – a boon to European and indeed global security. That is why the key tenets of our Russia policy – a policy of constructive engagement – will remain. After the Caucasus conflict, there can be no business as usual with Russia, and we need to seriously review our relationship.\" The PA adopted a resolution supporting an international investigation of the causes of the war.\nOn 2 December 2008, Jaap De Hoop Scheffer announced after the foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels that \"Allies agreed on what I would qualify as a conditional and graduated reengagement with Russia,\" but clarified that NATO still disapproved of the Russian actions in Georgia. United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice cautioned NATO against cooperation with Russia unless Russia fulfilled its obligations regarding Georgia. The ministers adopted a communique stating that NATO would increase cooperation with Georgia via Georgia-NATO commission. Scheffer told The New York Times that NATO wanted to establish \"what was behind Georgia\" and convince Russia that \"democracy and the rule of law coming closer to Russia's borders\" was not a threat to Russia.\nOn 19 December 2008, Jaap De Hoop Scheffer and Dmitry Rogozin had a joint lunch in Brussels to normalize relations in the aftermath of the war.\nOn 7 February 2009, Jaap De Hoop Scheffer stated in Munich: \"President Medvedev has also proposed a discussion of a new Euro-Atlantic security architecture. [...] But I cannot see how we can have a serious discussion of such a new architecture, in which President Medvedev himself says “territorial integrity” is a primary element, when Russia is building bases inside Georgia, which doesn't want them.\"\nOn 13 January 2009, Russian General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn announced that Russia was ready to resume cooperation with NATO if the United States apologized for the break in relations.\nOn 30 January 2009, NATO Press-speaker James Appathurai said that the NATO General Secretary would raise the issue of Russian military bases in Abkhazia and South Ossetia with First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia in Munich.\nOn 19 February 2009, Jaap De Hoop Scheffer said in Kraków: \"The conflict in the Caucasus convinced some that good relations with Russia and the further expansion of NATO are mutually excluded. This is not so.\" Scheffer announced that NATO would take into consideration Russia's concerns during the future expansions.\nNATO foreign ministers met in Brussels on 5 March 2009 and decided to renew contacts with Russia in the framework of NATO-Russia Council. Lithuania and Czechia were against resuming ties with Russia too soon before Russia would allow international monitors into Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged the NATO countries to never recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia.\nNATO Summit on 4 April 2009 called on Russia \"to meet its commitments with respect to Georgia, as mediated by the European Union on 12 August and 8 September 2008\", in particular to withdraw completely from Georgia and annul the recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The declaration also stated: \"We are deeply concerned that, since 12 December 2007, Russia has continued its unilateral “suspension” of its legal obligations under the CFE Treaty. Furthermore, Russia's actions in Georgia have called into question its commitment to the fundamental OSCE principles\".\nRussian foreign minister and NATO foreign ministers met on Corfu on 27 June 2009. They decided to renew cooperation despite some disagreements on Georgia.\n|-\n|  Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe || On 2 August 2008, chairman of the OSCE, Finnish Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb, condemned \"this needless violence, especially against civilian targets\" during the night of 2 August and urged all sides to de-escalate.\nOn late 7 August 2008, Alexander Stubb expressed concern about the deteriorating situation in the Georgian-Ossetian conflict zone and the fact that scheduled meeting between representatives of Georgia and South Ossetia did not take place. Stubb said that he would visit Georgia soon.\nIn the afternoon of 8 August, the Permanent Council of OSCE was convened in Vienna. Finnish Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb said that the fighting might grow into \"a full-fledged war,\" which \"would have a devastating impact for the entire region.\"\nAlexander Stubb said on August 9, \"Russia is at the moment a party in this conflict, not a mediator, and that has to be mirrored when ceasefire and peace talks begin. It is clear that there is no return to the status quo, to what was.\" Stubb was planning to visit Georgia on 11 August and Russia on 12 August. He commented on the possibility of a swift end of the crisis, \"On a scale of one to 10, we are at about two.\" Stubb further commented on the conflict, \"This is a war, no doubt about it. There is no reason to call it anything else.\"\nOn the morning of 12 August, the OSCE head said he was \"carefully optimistic\" that the joint EU-OSCE ceasefire draft would be accepted by Russia. The plan had already been accepted by Georgian president Saakashvili. Russia was refusing to accept a ceasefire offered by Georgia. The Finnish foreign minister, Alexander Stubb, acting as the chairman of the organisation, travelled to Moscow on 12 August to negotiate a cease-fire. Stubb stated that OSCE was the only organisation with infrastructure in the area that had military observers.\nDuring the meeting in Vienna on 13 August, all 56 member states supported the plan to send 100 military observers.\nThe head of the OSCE announced that Russia would permit deployment of 20 additional monitors to Georgia.\nStubb said on 26 August that Russian recognition of Georgia's separatist regions \"violates the core principles of the OSCE.\" He further said: \"Russia must immediately pull back its troops from Georgia's territory and implement the cease-fire agreement.\"\nAfter the war, Russia did not readmit the OSCE monitors into South Ossetia and the OSCE did not manage to evaluate the destruction or facilitate the return of the Georgian displaced persons to South Ossetia. The OSCE halted the negotiation with Russia regarding the deployment of monitors to South Ossetia in September 2008. As of 18 September 2008, 28 monitors were present in the security area adjacent to South Ossetia. Although chairman of the OSCE council Antti Turunen said further negotiations were pointless, Russian envoy Anvar Azimov said Russia was \"keeping the door open, ready to continue the dialogue. No doubt we will find a constructive solution.\"\nOn 29 September 2008, Alexander Stubb said that he was not interested who started the war. He said that Europe was interested in European Russia and not in isolating Russia.\nOn 4 December 2008, the OSCE foreign ministers met in Helsinki to discuss the situation in Georgia among other topics. British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said that admission of the OSCE monitors into South Ossetia was important and Russia's use of force was \"disproportionate\". French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner condemned the Russian recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Secretary General Marc Perrin de Brichambaut said that OSCE was warning about the escalation of tensions before the war. The next day, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov criticized the OSCE. The OSCE did not support the Russian initiative on reforming the collective security system in Europe.\n|-\n|Shanghai Cooperation Organisation || A collective statement by the leaders of all members was adopted at the Dushanbe summit on 28 August 2008. Although Russian officials anticipated unconditional backing before the summit, the meeting instead supported the concept of territorial integrity, \"The participants [of the SCO summit] underscore the need for respect of the historical and cultural traditions of each country and each people, for efforts aimed at the preservation, under international law, of the unity of a state and its territorial integrity.\" The SCO states \"support the active role of Russia in assisting peace and cooperation in the region.\" However, \"peaceful dialogue\" was also important for resolving the conflict, since \"Placing the emphasis exclusively on the use of force has no prospects and hinders a comprehensive settlement of local conflicts.\" China was reserved since it had its own separatist problem and one US State Department official commented on the statement, \"Clearly there is unhappiness at what Russia did.\" The SCO states embraced the 12 August six-point ceasefire document at the end of the statement. Kommersant newspaper commented that \"Even Russia's traditional allies refused to side with it.\" Nezavisimaya Gazeta had reported before the summit that China had rejected Russian-proposed wordings, such as \"genocide\" and \"Georgian aggression\".\n|-\n|  || On 7 August 2008, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon voiced his position over the escalation of violence and called on all sides \"to refrain from any action that could further escalate the situation and threaten the stability of the region.\"\nOn 8 August, an extraordinary meeting of the UN Security Council was scheduled to be held at 07:00 MSK at Russia's initiative. The session was held, but failed to reach an agreement.\nOn 9 August, Edmond Mulet, Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping, stated that the Abkhaz would attack Georgia, \"At this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond South Ossetia into Abkhazia.\"\nOn late 9 August, UN Secretary-General's office issued a statement saying that Ban Ki-moon urged \"all parties to immediately end hostilities and to engage, without delay, in negotiations to achieve a peaceful settlement.\"\nBy 10 August, António Guterres, the High Commissioner for Refugees, urged to allow civilians to leave the conflict zone safely. Guterres said on 11 August: \"It is essential that humanitarian agencies be able to reach the affected and the displaced.\"\nOn 10 August, UN reported Russian military buildup in Abkhazia and bombing of Zugdidi. UN official said, \"The [U.N.] secretary-general is profoundly concerned over mounting tensions in the Abkhaz zone of conflict.\"\nBy 11 August, the World Food Programme was providing food to uprooted persons. The organization said that the quantity of those in need was \"rising by the hour\".\nOn 14 August, the Secretary General's office published a statement in which Ban Ki-moon said that it was difficult for the UN observers and humanitarian workers to approach the civilians in need. He endorsed the ceasefire but also said \"that notwithstanding this agreement, violence continues, with civilians bearing the brunt,\" and called on the sides \"to respect and protect civilians in accordance with international humanitarian law and human rights law.\"\nUN resident Robert Watkins commented on the humanitarian situation by 15 August, \"Paramilitary and criminal groups are taking advantage of the uncertainty and the lack of administration and police. In terms of security it is very similar to what happened after the invasion of Iraq.\"\nUN press-secretary said on 15 August 2008 that an attempt by the UN Secretary General to reach the President of Russia by phone and discuss the situation in South Ossetia was unsuccessful.\nAccording to an anonymous American official, Secretary-General was contemplating on 17 August to dispatch some eminent representatives of the United Nations to Georgia.\nOn 19 August, an extraordinary meeting of the UN Security Council was convened to consider another French proposal for the peace plan. The proposed resolution urged the Russian withdrawal to pre-war positions, but Russia claimed that the agreement authorized the existence of Russian-operated buffer area in Georgia and that the resolution's support of Georgia's territorial integrity was irrelevant. Vitaly Churkin called the proposal \"very strange\" and said that discussion of the proposal was \"a waste of time.\" He said, \"They can put it to a vote if they want to. We'll see what happens then.\"\nOn 22 August, António Guterres visited the conflict zone to study the situation on the ground and met with South Ossetian president Eduard Kokoity.\nOn 28 August, the Security Council rejected appeals of Abkhazia and South Ossetia to attend the council meeting and give a speech. After the meeting, Belgian diplomat Jan Grauls said, \"There was no unanimous support to respond positively to these requests now.\" Russia had previously unsuccessfully lobbied for Abkhazia and South Ossetia be given permission to attend the Security Council meetings in the preceding months.\nOn 11 September 2008, Ban Ki-Moon that he was discussing the situation in Georgia daily with international leaders and was working on the deployment of the UN peacekeepers to Abkhazia and South Ossetia.\nIn September 2008, Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann, the president of the UN General Assembly, claimed that Georgia \"committed an act of aggression against South Ossetia and violated UN Charter.\" The United Nations announced that the UN delegation would visit Georgia and Russia on 17–20 September \"to gain first-hand knowledge of the humanitarian and human rights situations and needs on the ground, including the position of those displaced by the conflict and other vulnerable groups\" with the permission of Georgia and Russia and the findings would be used to revise $59 million humanitarian aid proposal.\n|}\nInternational NGOs\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:175px;\"| Organisation !! Response\n|-\n| Amnesty International || In November 2008, Amnesty International released a 69-page report citing both Georgia and Russia for serious violations of the international war laws.\n|-\n| Caritas Internationalis || On 11 August 2008, Caritas claimed to be providing humanitarian assistance and urged to end the hostilities. Secretary General Lesley-Anne Knight said, \"Russia and Georgia must step back from all out war. Already the conflict has caused too much suffering to thousands of innocent civilians. It will take a huge regional effort to rebuild shattered communities. Caritas appeals to both sides to do everything in their power to respect the lives of civilians. Caritas supports the need for humanitarian corridors into South Ossetia as a short term solution, but peace talks must take place now. Both sides must respect the rights of ethnic minorities to avoid a further escalation in the conflict.\" Programme Manager Liana Mkheidze from Caritas Georgia said, \"Many people are coming to Tbilisi from Georgian villages around Tskhinvali and the also from Gori. Their houses have been damaged and they're escaping the bombardment. Caritas Georgia distributed 1920 small cans of tuna-fish and 420 cans of canned meat together with 500 loaves of freshly baked bread from its own bakery. We are preparing to distribute more bread and preparing food at our soup-kitchen if necessary to provide food to those made homeless.\" Director of Caritas Vladikavkaz (North Ossetia–Alania) Sergey Basiev said, \"There are lots of refugees seeking shelter. They have nothing. The situation is dreadful. We will try to meet these urgent needs.\"\n|-\n| Human Rights Watch || Holly Cartner, Europe and Central Asia director at HRW, said on 9 August 2008, \"All sides must remember that attacks on civilians, or acts intended to terrorize civilians, clearly violate international humanitarian law, and may constitute war crimes. This would be true even if they are carried out in reprisal for indiscriminate attacks by the adversary.\" The organization stated that the various numbers of casualties in South Ossetia were not verified.\n|-\n|  International Committee of the Red Cross || Spokeswoman Anna Nelson said on 8 August 2008 that they had information that hospitals in Tskhinvali and ambulances had a hard time dealing with the casualties.\nOn 8 August, ICRC said that it wanted to secure a humanitarian corridor to Tskhinvali.\nOn 11 August, the ICRC released a statement saying they were sending 15 tons of medical aid (including water equipment) from Geneva to Georgia.

The ICRC statement said, \"the ICRC has officially reminded Georgia and Russia of their obligation under international humanitarian law to protect civilians and distinguish at all times between the civilian population and those taking a direct part in the hostilities.
