Schwarz also was a recipient of the Demidov Prize of the Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg in 1865 for his work in geodesy.\nPalaeoarctic Siberian Asia Expeditions\nFollowing assignment by Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve as a field expedition astronomer (1849-1853) to study the Amur River, astronomer Schwarz led (1854-1862) the East Siberian Expedition of 1855 which extensively explored unknown and unmapped territory in Eastern Siberia, such as the Turan Range and the North Baikal Highlands.\nThe Siberian expedition went into central Asia, southeastern Asia, and northern China. Some of the routes travelled were as long as 10,000 miles. Utilizing his prior Amur field knowledge of astronomy he would determine geographical positions of certain points (geodesy) for preparation of geographical maps. The information would later be used in planning the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway systems and others in southeast Asia.\nThe volumes reporting the results of the expedition were published in 1864. The separate tomes concerning the vegetation and wildlife reports were prepared by the expedition's botanist and zoologist Gustav Radde.\nDorpat Observatory\nLudwig Schwarz served as the Director of Dorpat Observatory (now Tartu Observatory) from 1872  to 1891, succeeding Thomas Clausen who held the position from 1866 to 1872. Upon the retirement of Schwarz from the directorship on 1 September 1891 the position became the responsibility of Grigori Levitski who held it until 1908.\nDuring his tenure in later life he conducted studies of one third of the 10,000 celestial stars visible at Tartu.\nLegacy\nRadde's warbler, a leaf warbler bird that breeds in Siberia and winters in southeast Asia, bears a scientific name (Phylloscopus schwarzi) that commemorates Schwarz. The bird was described in 1863 by naturalist and fellow explorer Gustav Radde who served in the East Siberian Expedition of 1855 led by Schwarz.\nGallery\nFile:А М Хаген Обсерватория Дерпта.jpg|Dorpat Observatory.
