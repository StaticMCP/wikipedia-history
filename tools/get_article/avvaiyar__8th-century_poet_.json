      "text": "# Avvaiyar (8th-century poet)\n\nAvvaiyar (Tamil: ஔவையார்) was a Tamil poet  who lived during the seventh or eighth century and was a follower of the poet-saint Sundarar. She was the author of Vinayagar Agaval, a devotional poetic hymn to the Hindu deity Ganesha. The name Avvaiyar means a 'respectable good woman', hence a generic title; her personal name is not known.\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\n* }}\n* Krishnamurti, Dr. C.R.
