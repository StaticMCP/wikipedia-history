Proton is developed by Valve in cooperation with developers from CodeWeavers. It is a collection of software and libraries combined with a patched version of Wine to improve performance and compatibility with Windows games. Proton is designed for integration into the Steam client as \"Steam Play\". It is officially distributed through the client, although third-party forks can be manually installed.\nOverview\nProton was initially released on 21 August 2018. Upon release, Valve announced a list of 27 games that were tested and certified to perform like their native Windows counterparts without requiring end-user tweaking. These include Doom (2016), Quake, and Final Fantasy VI.\nProton incorporates several libraries that improve 3D performance. These include Direct3D-to-Vulkan translation layers, namely DXVK for Direct3D 9, 10 and 11, and VKD3D-Proton for Direct3D 12. A separate library known as D9VK handled Direct3D 9 support until it was merged into DXVK in December 2019.\nCompatibility\nBeing a fork of Wine, Proton maintains very similar compatibility with Windows applications as its upstream counterpart. In addition to the official list of compatible games, many other Windows games are compatible, albeit unofficially, with Proton. The user can optionally force use of Proton for a specific game, even if a Linux version already exists. This may be done when a game's native Linux support is lacking or unstable.\nProtonDB\nProtonDB is an unofficial community website that collects and displays crowdsourced data describing the compatibility of a given title with Proton, on a rating scale from \"Borked\" (doesn't work) to \"Platinum\" (works perfectly). The site is inspired by the WineHQ AppDB, which also collects and displays crowdsourced compatibility reports and uses a similar rating system.\nRelease history\nValve has released nine major versions of Proton. The versioning scheme refers to the upstream Wine version it is based on, with an appended patch number.\nProton generally lags behind its upstream Wine base by several releases. Unofficial forks, such as Proton GE, have been created to rebase Proton on recent Wine versions, which may improve or worsen compatibility with games compared to the official release.\nIn December 2020, Valve released Proton Experimental, a perpetual beta branch of Proton that incorporates new features and bug fixes quicker than regular releases, which are eventually included in a regular release.\nThe Steam Deck uses Proton to increase software title compatibility.\nProton 3.7 (August 2018)\nThe first official release of Proton\nsupported 27 games, including DOOM (2016), Quake, and Final Fantasy VI. Integrated DXVK for Direct3D 10/11 implementation via Vulkan.\nProton 4.2 (April 2019)\nThis version was updated to a newer version of Wine, improving compatibility and performance. It featured enhanced support for fullscreen mode and controllers.\nProton 5.0 (February 2020)\nBased on Wine 5.0, this version brought major improvements to game compatibility and improved support for games with anti-cheat systems.\nProton 5.13 (October 2020)\nThis version introduced compatibility for more games and improved support for existing titles, add well as enhanced media playback and networking features.\nProton 6.3 (April 2021)\nBased on Wine 6.0 with additional patches, this version improved Direct3D 12 support via VKD3D-Proton. It had better game performance and compatibility.\nProton 7.0 (February 2022)\nBuilt on Wine 7.0, this version made significant improvements to game compatibility and new features.\nProton 8.0 (April 2023)\nThis version continued enhancements to game compatibility and performance, and updated DXVK and VKD3D-Proton for improved graphics support.\nProton 9.0 (May 2024)\nThis version focused on stability and compatibility, alongside improving support for newer games and technologies.\nProton 10.0 (November 2025)\nThis version updated DXVK, VKD3D, and Wine. Unlike Wine 10, it does not provide a method to access the native Wayland driver.\nSee also\n*SteamOS\n*Lutris game manager that uses Wine, Proton, and related technologies\n*CrossOver\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.protondb.com/ ProtonDB] – community database for game compatibility data"
