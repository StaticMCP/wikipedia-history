It is primarily used for American football, and from 1998 through 2005 was the venue for the Hula Bowl, a college football all-star game. When the stadium originally opened in 1969 it held fewer than 7,000 people. It was expanded due to the efforts of the then-mayor of Maui, Linda Lingle, to host the Hula Bowl.\nWar Memorial Stadium is also home to the Maui Interscholastic League (MIL) High School Football association and soccer matches are played in the stadium.\nWar Memorial Stadium is also equipped with a state of the art 440 yard track, long jump, triple jump, high jump, and pole vaulting pits. In 1972, the stadium was the site of the first State High School Track and Field Championships held outside of Honolulu, chosen in part because of the new state of the art rubberized asphalt surface.\nThe football field has a grass surface. Plans to replace the grass with artificial turf were abandoned in 2014 when bids came in 50% above the expected $1 million.\nThe only regular-season college football game to take place on Maui occurred on September 8, 2001, when the University of Hawaii Warriors defeated the visiting Montana Grizzlies 30–12 in front of a crowd of 12,863.\nWar Memorial Stadium Complex\nThe War Memorial Stadium Complex includes 1,500 plus seat Maehara Stadium adjacent to War Memorial Stadium. It is home to the Maui Interscholastic League Baseball and American Legion Games.\nThe complex also houses training facilities for H. P. Baldwin High School, additional soccer fields, softball fields, Soichi Sakamoto Pool and 2,000+ seat War Memorial  Gymnasium. The complex was dedicated in 1965 to honor the Veterans of Maui County (comprising the Islands of Maui, Moloka'i and Lana'i) who gave their lives in service of their country.\nThe stadium complex is located on the windward side of the island between the towns of Kahului and the county seat Wailuku, on the Valley Isle of Maui and is adjacent to H. P. Baldwin High School.\nReferences"
