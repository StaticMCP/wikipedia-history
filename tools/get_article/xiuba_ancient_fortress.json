These 50-meter-high towers, built with interlocking slate and wooden beams, exhibit a unique twelve-faced, twelve-edged prismatic exterior and an octagonal interior. Their 2-meter-thick walls have strategic observation ports and were made to connect with iron chains for coordinated defense. This shows how advanced the military engineering was in the Tibetan Empire during the rule of Songtsen Gampo.\nEcology\nFortress is embedded within the Nyang River Valley's biodiversity corridor, surrounded by mixed coniferous forests, alpine meadows, and glacial streams. The area supports endemic species like the Himalayan blue poppy and serves as a critical habitat for migratory birds.\nCulture\nThe site is intertwined with the epic of King Gesar, who allegedly conquered demonic forces here using dawn ambush tactics, and local legends recount conflicts between Tibetan Buddhist sects, evidenced by the name \"Xiuba\" (Tibetan: \"flaying\") referencing historical sectarian violence.\nProtection\nSince its designation as a regional cultural heritage site in 2001, the fortress has integrated preservation with eco-tourism, featuring Tibet's largest prayer wheel and a museum showcasing medieval weaponry and agrarian tools. Ongoing efforts balance archaeological conservation with sustainable tourism, highlighting its dual role as a historical sentinel and a bridge between ancient Tibetan military strategy and Himalayan ecological resilience.\nReferences"
