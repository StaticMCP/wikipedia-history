It contains the remains of some of the allied troops who died during the Battle of Gallipoli.\nSotiri Farm was named Pink Farm by the allied troops after the colour of the soil. Three cemeteries were constructed around the farm, and were combined on the site of Pink Farm Cemetery No 3, which contained 139 graves, after the Armistice and enlarged as bodies from other areas were brought to it.\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* [http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=cr&CRid=2156335 Pink Farm Cemetery, Helles] at Find a Grave"
