It was a top 20 album on three Billboard charts and represents the peak of the band's commercial popularity. The title track, featuring singer Randy Crawford, was a Top 40 pop single (No. 36) and became the group's most successful entry on the soul chart (No. 17). It was No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart. \"Street Life\" also hit the disco chart, peaking at No. 75, and was re-recorded by Doc Severinsen with Crawford reprising her vocal for the opening sequence of the noir crime drama ''Sharky's Machine'', directed by Burt Reynolds in 1981. This faster paced  version was also featured in Quentin Tarantino's Jackie Brown, released in 1997.\nThe cover photograph was taken at 409 N Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills, California.\nCritical reception\n|rev3 = The Rolling Stone Jazz Record Guide\n| rev3Score =\n|rev2 = The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings\n|rev2score  =\n}}\nThe Bay State Banner noted that \"Crawford's voice has passion and intensity, unlike the meanderings heard on her albums.\"\nThe album was included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\nTrack listing\n#\"Street Life\" (Will Jennings, Joe Sample) – 11:18\n#\"My Lady\" (Wilton Felder) – 6:43\n#\"Rodeo Drive (High Steppin')\" (Sample) – 4:28\n#\"Carnival of the Night\" (Felder) – 6:24\n#\"The Hustler\" (Stix Hooper) – 5:18\n#\"Night Faces\" \t(Sample) – 5:10\nPersonnel\n;The Crusaders\n*Wilton Felder – tenor saxophone (tracks 1, 2, 3, 4), alto saxophone (track 5, 6), bass (tracks 1, 2, 5)\n*Joe Sample – keyboards, horn and string arrangements\n*Stix Hooper – drums\n;Additional personnel\n*Randy Crawford – vocals (track 1)\n*Louis Aldebert – vocals (track 2)\n*Monique Aldebert – vocals (track 2)\n*Oscar Brashear – trumpet (tracks 1, 3)\n*Robert O.
