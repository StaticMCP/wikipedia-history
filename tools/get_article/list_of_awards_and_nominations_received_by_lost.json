It was nominated for numerous awards, including 54 Primetime Emmy Awards (11 wins), 54 Saturn Awards (13 wins), 33 Teen Choice Awards, 17 TCA Awards (4 wins), 13 Golden Reel Awards (5 wins), 8 Satellite Awards (1 win), 7 Golden Globe Awards (1 win), 7 Writers Guild of America Awards (1 win), 6 Directors Guild of America Awards, 6 Producers Guild of America Awards (1 win), 4 People's Choice Awards, 2 BAFTA TV Awards, 2 NAACP Image Awards (1 win), and 2 Screen Actors Guild Awards (1 win). Amongst the wins for the series are the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series (1 win), Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama (1 win), Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series (1 win), Saturn Award for Best Network Television Series (5 wins), TCA Award for Outstanding Achievement in Drama (3 wins), and Peabody Award (1 win).\nThe series has an ensemble cast and several different Lost actors have received acting award nominations. Michael Emerson and Terry O'Quinn are the only actors to win Primetime Emmy Awards. Matthew Fox has been nominated for 19 individual awards (winning three), the most of any cast member; Evangeline Lilly is second with 16 and Emerson is third with 13 (winning two). \"Pilot\" is the most nominated episode of the series, receiving nominations from fifteen different associations; the episode won eight awards, including four Primetime Emmy Awards. The third-season finale, \"Through the Looking Glass\", is the second most nominated episode with nine while \"The End\" received the most Primetime Emmy Award nominations with eight, winning one.\nEmmy Awards\nand Carlton Cuse were both nominated together four times for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series in 2006, 2007, 2009, and 2010]]\nIn 2005, Lost was nominated for twelve Primetime Emmy Awards and won six, including Outstanding Drama Series, which was considered an unusual win since the Primetime Emmy Awards had rarely recognized science fiction or fantasy programs. It also won Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series for co-creator J. J. Abrams (for his direction on the pilot episode), Outstanding Casting for a Drama Series, and three additional awards for the pilot episode. The following year, the series was nominated for nine awards, but failed to win any. Despite winning for Outstanding Drama Series the previous year, Lost was not nominated in 2006. This was referenced in host Conan O'Brien's opening segment at the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards; he lands on a beach and encounters Jorge Garcia. O'Brien jumps into a hatch and invites Garcia to come along to the ceremony, but Garcia tells him that they \"weren't exactly invited\", to which O'Brien responds by saying \"Really? But you won last year! Nothing makes sense anymore!\" In 2007, the series was nominated for six awards, but again failed to gain a nomination for Outstanding Drama Series. Additionally, Terry O'Quinn became the first Lost actor to win a Primetime Emmy Award, picking up the award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his performance as John Locke in \"The Man from Tallahassee\" (season 3, episode 13). In 2008, the series received eight nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series after being snubbed the two previous years; the season only won Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (One-Hour) for \"Meet Kevin Johnson\" (season 4, episode 8). In 2009, the series received six nominations and won two; Michael Emerson became the second actor from Lost to win a Primetime Emmy Award, winning for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his performance as Ben Linus in \"Dead Is Dead\" (season 5, episode 12). The website DharmaWantsYou.com won a special award for Outstanding Creative Achievement in Interactive Media – Fiction. In 2010, the sixth and final season of Lost received thirteen nominations, including a fourth and final nomination for Outstanding Drama Series, which it lost to season 3 of Mad Men, as in the two previous years. The season only won Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series for the finale.\nPrimetime Emmy Awards\nwon Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series for directing the pilot episode in 2005]]\nwon Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his performance as John Locke in 2007]]\nwas nominated for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for \"Walkabout\" in 2005]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
