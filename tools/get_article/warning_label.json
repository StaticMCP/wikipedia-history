Most of them are placed to limit civil liability in lawsuits against the item's manufacturer or seller (see product liability).  That sometimes results in labels which for some people seem to state the obvious.\nLack of a warning label can become an informational defect, which is a type of product defect.\nWarning labels are found on various product packagings, such as chemicals (flammable, pesticide, poisons, etc.), batteries, tobacco, alcohol and other unhealthy foods.\nRegulation by country\nChile\nEuropean Economic Area\nIn the European Economic Area, a product containing hazardous mixtures must have a unique formula identifier (UFI) code. This is not a warning label per se, but a code that helps poison control centres identify the exact formula of a hazardous product.\nMexico\nUnited States\nIn the United States, warning labels have been instituted under a number of different government organizations.  For instance, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938. Cigarettes were not required to have warning labels in the United States until Congress passed the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (FCLAA) in 1965.\nOther organizations that create label standards in the US — the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) — govern their use. The US organizations pull from international organizations such as the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals and the International Standards Organization.\nChemical hazard level warning labels\nIn the United States or elsewhere, the terms Danger, Warning and Caution are regulated by the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS)  ANSI Z535.  Graphic symbols are regulated by ISO 7010.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Term !! Hazard !! Meaning !! Usage\n|-\n!
