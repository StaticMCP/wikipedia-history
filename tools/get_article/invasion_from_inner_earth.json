Egregious scenes of nothingness never build tension or pacing. Dialog goes nowhere. Characters bring nothing of interest. Stiff performances lack any convincing qualities. Then comes a brief dance number worthy of the schlock cinema hall of fame.\", wrote a review of the DVD.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
