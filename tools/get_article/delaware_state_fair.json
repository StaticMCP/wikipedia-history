The fair is a ten-day event at the end of July.\nHistory\nThe first Delaware State Fair was held in Wilmington, with mentions of the \"Delaware State Fair\" being found in newspapers as far back as 1869. In 1878, the Delaware State Fair was moved to Fairview Park Fair Grounds in Dover and held September 24–27. The opening speaker of the 1878 Delaware State Fair was Daniel Henry Chamberlain, former Republican Governor of South Carolina, as well as guest speakers J. Proctor Knott, at the time a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives representing Kentucky's 4th congressional district, and Samuel S. Cox, then Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives representing New York's 6th congressional district.\nIn 1917, the state fair moved to Elsmere where the Delaware State Fair Association had purchased property and built a fairgrounds within the town limits, in the area of the current Filbert, Birch, and Dover Avenues. The fairgrounds included racetracks, agricultural exhibits, and stages for various entertainment acts. The Association went bankrupt after the 1924 fair, and its assets were sold off. A new fair association was formed and held the Wilmington Fair, which was sometimes referred to as the Delaware State Fair, in 1927 and 1928 at the fairgrounds in Elsmere.\nThe first fair on the current grounds was held in 1920 and was known as the Kent and Sussex County Fair. It lasted four days and was held on . The Kent and Sussex County Fair changed its name to the Delaware State Fair in 1962. Today the fairgrounds encompass over  and feature concerts, wrestling, rodeo, races, agricultural exhibits, a midway, and other typical state fair demonstrations and events. The Harrington Raceway & Casino is also located at the fairgrounds. The property also hosted a Donald Trump rally for his presidential campaign on April 22, 2016.\nThe only cancellations were from 1942 to 1945 due to World War II. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the fair resisted cancellation, although safety modifications were put in place and concerts were cancelled. Masks were required up until recent years, and as of 2024, are no longer required to enter the fair.\nConcerts\nThe Delaware State Fair has long been a center for regional entertainment, drawing in crowds from the rest of the state, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland. It is one of only a few local concert venues, so it has been able to attract many popular acts to Delmarva, among them:\nCasino\nHarrington Raceway & Casino operates on the fairgrounds year round and consists of a harness racetrack and a casino offering slot machines, table games, and sports betting.\nWinter Season\nDuring the winter season the Centre Ice Rink located on the fair grounds hosts public skating and Ice hockey sessions.\nIn January 2025, it was announced by the Fair that the Centre would close as an ice rink due to rising maintenance costs.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.delawarestatefair.com/ Official Site]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120419000937/http://delaware.statefairblogs.com/ Delaware State Fair Blog]"
