Other USAAF support commands (Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); Air Transport Command (ATC) or Troop Carrier Command) commanded a significant number of airfields in support roles.\nRemnants of these wartime airfields exist. Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture, and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor airfields\nAir Technical Service Command\n* Alpena AAF, Alpena\n: 100th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron\n: Now: Alpena County Regional Airport\n* Kinross AAF, Kinross\n:: Sub-base of Alpena AAF, Phelps Collins CTRC\n:: Was: Kinross Air Force Base (1947-1959)\n:: Was: Kincheloe Air Force Base (1959-1977)\n:: Now: Chippewa County International Airport\n*Raco AAF, Raco\n:: Sub-base of Alpena AAF\n:: Was: Used by Michigan National Guard and byKincheloe AFB as a BOMARC missile site.
