It is a subsidiary of Studio Dragon.\nHistory\nCulture Depot was founded in 2010 as an exhibition and performance planning company. Since 2012, it worked as a management agency for actress Jun Ji-hyun following her departure from SidusHQ. In the following years, it expanded its actor lineup and signed television screenwriter Park Ji-eun.\nIn January 2016, Culture Depot was acquired by CJ E&M, and later branched into drama production. A few months later, the company was integrated into CJ E&M's then-newly launched subsidiary, Studio Dragon.\nWorks\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Title\n! Original title\n! Network\n!
