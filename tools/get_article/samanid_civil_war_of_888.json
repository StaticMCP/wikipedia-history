The war took place three years after the Samanid Civil War of 885, which ended with a status quo ante bellum. This time, however, the war ended with a decisive victory for Ismail I. In the aftermath of the war, the victorious brother showed a great deal of respect to his elder and defeated brother and, according to a legend, Ismail even kissed Nasr's hand as a sign of apology. Apparently, Nasr lost much of his power, but he wasn't removed from the Samanid throne; instead, Ismail became de facto ruler of the empire and after death of his brother, he became the amir.\nReferences"
