For most of its existence, the PARM was generally considered a satellite party of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).\nThe PARM was founded by a group of veterans of the Mexican Revolution who had been marginalized in the PRI, led by Juan Barragán and Jacinto B. Treviño, both revolutionary generals who had held important governmental positions. The foundation of the PARM was supported by President Adolfo Ruiz Cortines, who saw a way to have an officially independent party that would support the efforts of the PRI and would give the appearance of democratic competition in elections and in Congress.\nFrom their founding to 1987, the PARM did not present a separate candidate to the presidency, instead backing the PRI candidates and supporting presidential proposals in Congress. It was only an independent competitor in one city, Nuevo Laredo, where it won the municipal presidency.\nIn 1987, the PARM broke from the PRI for the first time as it became the first party to nominate Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas Solórzano for president, leading to the beginning of the National Democratic Front. However, after the elections ended, it refused to be a member of the new party formed by Cárdenas Solórzano alongside the Mexican Socialist Party (PMS) and returned to its usual role as a satellite of the PRI.\nThe PARM lost its registration in 1994, but it briefly reappeared in 1999. The party nominated Porfirio Muñoz Ledo for president in 2000. One month prior to the election, the widening rift between the candidate and party leadership led to Muñoz Ledo resigning from his candidacy in favor of Vicente Fox. The party refused to recognize Muñoz Ledo's move but did not select a replacement candidate and definitively lost its registration in the ensuing election.\nPARM presidents\n* 1954 to 1964: Jacinto B.
