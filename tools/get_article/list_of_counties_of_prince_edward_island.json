Holland's survey saw the island divided into the three counties, each of which had a \"royalty\" (or shire town) as a county seat.  The rest of the county outside the royalty was sub-divided into parishes for the Church of England, measuring approximately ; the parishes were further sub-divided into townships measuring approximately .\nThe counties are no longer used as administrative boundaries for the provincial government; however, they continue to be used as census divisions by Statistics Canada for statistical purposes in administering the Canadian census.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!scope=\"col\"| County\n!scope=\"col\"| County seat(current)\n!scope=\"col\"| County seat(historical)\n!scope=\"col\"| Established\n!scope=\"col\"| Population(2021)\n!scope=\"col\"| Population(2016)\n!scope=\"col\"| Change\n!scope=\"col\"| Land area(km2)\n!scope=\"col\"| Population&nbsp;density(per km2)\n!scope=\"col\"| Map\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"| Kings || Georgetown || Kings Royalty || 1765 ||  ||align=center|  ||align=center| ||align=center|\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"| Queens || Charlottetown || Queens Royalty || 1765 ||  ||align=center|  ||align=center| ||align=center|\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"| Prince || Summerside || Prince Royalty || 1765 ||  ||align=center|  ||align=center| ||align=center|\n|- class=\"sortbottom\" style=\"text-align:center;\" style=\"background: #f2f2f2;\"\n|align=left| Total counties\n|align=center| &mdash;\n|align=center| &mdash;\n|align=center| &mdash;\n|\n|align=center|\n|align=center|\n|align=center| &mdash;\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n*Administrative divisions of Canada\nReferences"
