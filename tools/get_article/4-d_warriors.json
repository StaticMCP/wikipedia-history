Flying over the top of the play field will transport the players to an alternate universe. The players can travel back and forth defeating enemies until they reach a boss creature. On some occasions a worm hole will appear in the middle of the play field and the players are taken to even stranger worlds.\nSee also\n* Forgotten Worlds; another horizontally scrolling shooter arcade game with human protagonists.\nReferences\n*[http://www.shmup.com/index.php?page=fiche&id=911 4-D Warriors] at Shmup.com\n*\n*[http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=4-d-warriors&page=detail&id=19 4-D Warriors] at [http://www.arcade-history.com/index.php?page=news Arcade History]"
