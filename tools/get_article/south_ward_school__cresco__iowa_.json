It served as a grade school from 1897 to 1978. Because of low enrollment it was not used from 1949 to 1953. The 2½-story brick structure was built on a raised limestone basement, and it was capped with a hipped roof. It was significant as a good example of late Victorian-style school buildings with Romanesque influences. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The school building has subsequently been torn down and replaced with a modern apartment building. It was removed from the NRHP in September of the same year.\nReferences"
