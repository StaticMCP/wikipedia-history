The event's press conference took place on April 3, 2023, and was broadcast on Stardom's YouTube Channel.\nStorylines\nThe show featured eleven professional wrestling matches that result from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portray villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches.\nOn February 10, 2023, Himeka announced her retirement from professional wrestling. She underwent a \"retirement road\" series of matches ever since and expressed her wish of facing her long time MaiHime tag team partner Maika as her last-ever opponent in a Stardom match.\nOn February 18, 2023, at New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW)'s Battle in the Valley, Mercedes Moné defeated Kairi to win the IWGP Women's Championship.

After the match, Mayu Iwatani challenged Moné for the title at Queendom. Moné accepted Iwatani's challenge, and slapped her across the face afterwards.\nOn March 8, 2023, Kairi announced that she will take part into the event's card alongside a mystery partner.

They named their trio as \"REstart\" as they challenged Hiragi Kurumi, Risa Sera and Suzu Suzuki for the Artist of Stardom Championship. The following day, Saya Kamitani revealed on Twitter that Saori Anou was in fact one of the two mysterious white-hatted women (one of them already revealed to be Kairi) from before the events of the Stardom World Climax 2022 as her return to Stardom was foreshadowed for more than a year prior.\nEvent\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+Other on-screen personnel\n!|Role\n!|Name\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Japanese commentators\n|Makoto Oe\n|-\n|Teppei Arita\n|-\n|Momoe Nakanishi\n|-\n|Maika\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|English commentators\n|Chris Charlton\n|-\n|Sonny Gutierrez\n|-\n|Mariah May\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Ring Announcers\n|Yurie Kozakai\n|-\n|Yoritaka Ando\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Referees\n|Daichi Murayama\n|-\n|Barb Sasaki\n|-\n|Duke Sado\n|}\nThe first two preshow matches were broadcast on Stardom's YouTube channel.
