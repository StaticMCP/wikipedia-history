According to allmovie, Brian Ellsworth is a junior high student \"who has a habit of writing his words – and the letters – backwards. Brian's friends think he's kidding, his teachers think he's lazy, and his parents think he's slow. In truth, Brian has dyslexia and suffers from societal misconceptions and Ableist idiocy.\"\nPlot\nBrian Ellsworth is a good student, however he cannot read well. When he is at school, he tries to avoid reading and writing, and whenever the teacher tells him to write he disturbs the lesson. Most of the teachers believe that Brian is lazy. Brian's classmates think that Brian enjoys annoying the teachers. Only one of his teachers wants to help Brian. She tries to find out the reasons behind his behavior. Brian's classmate, Kim, also tries to help Brian. She gives him private lessons. When it's discovered that Brian has dyslexia, he finally gets the help he needs.

A good aspect is that the film shows that dyslexia isn't an indicator of low mental ability and that many highly intelligent people have dyslexia, too.\nUS Magazine described the drama as slight but River Phoenix's portrayal as subtle and uncompromisingly real.\nSee also\n* List of artistic depictions of dyslexia\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
