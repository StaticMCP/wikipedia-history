Originally named the Army of Observation, it was expanded with elements of the Army of Mainz (Mayence) and the Army of Helvetia (Switzerland). The army had three divisions plus an advance guard, a reserve, and an artillery park. The artillery park was under the command of Jean Ambroise Baston de Lariboisière and consisted of 33 cannons and 19 howitzers operated by 1,329 non-commissioned officers and cannoneers as well as 60 officers. There were approximately 25,000 members of the Army, the role of which was to invade southwestern Germany, precipitating the War of the Second Coalition.\nThe Army crossed the Rhine River on 1&nbsp;March 1799 under the command of Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, in the order of battle below. As elements crossed the Rhine, they took the name \"Army of the Danube\". The crossing was completed by 7 March. After passing through the Black Forest, the Army fought two battles in quick succession, the Battle of Ostrach, on 20–21 March, and Stockach, on 25–26 March. It suffered badly in both engagements and, following the action at Stockach, withdrew to the Black Forest. Jourdan established his headquarters at Hornberg, and the Reserve cavalry and the cavalry of the Advance Guard quartered near Offenburg, where the horses could find better forage.\nInitially, the Army included six future Marshals of France: its commander-in-chief, Jourdan; François Joseph Lefebvre; Jean-Baptiste Drouet; Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr; Gabriel Jean Joseph Molitor; and Édouard Adolphe Casimir Joseph Mortier. After the defeat at Ostrach, the Army was reorganized and command shifted to another future marshal, André Masséna. Under Masséna's command, elements of the army participated in skirmishes in Switzerland, the eleven-hour Battle of Winterthur and the First and Second Battles of Zürich. The Army was disbanded in November 1799 and its units dispersed among other French field armies by mid-December.\nStaff\nJean-Baptiste Jourdan received command of the Army of Observation in September 1798, from its temporary commander, Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino. From October to December, he assessed its condition. By 27 February 1799 Moreau had drawn together his general staff and laid out his operational plan for a Danube campaign.\nGeneral Staff\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=45%\n|-valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Chief of Staff Jean Augustin Ernouf\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! width=35%; align= center | Position\n! width=45%; align= center | Staff\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left |Commander of the Engineers\n| align= left | Armand Samuel de Marescot\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left |Chief Commissary\n| align= left | Jean Baptiste Vaillant\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left |Commander of the Artillery\n| align= left |Jean Fabre de La MartillièreAndré Joseph Lemaire\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left |Staff officer\n| align= left |Joseph Augustin Fournier, Marquis d'Aultanne\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left |Adjutants\n| align= left |Gabriel Jean Joseph MolitorÉtienne Hastrel de RivedouxJean-François BarbierFrançois Louis Dedon-Duclos\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|colspan=\"9\" align=\"left\"|Source: Jean-Baptiste Jourdan.

François Joseph Lefebvre was indisposed—suffering from ringworm—and Jourdan had appointed General of Division Dominique Vandamme to direct the march. Vandamme had been lobbying with Jourdan for a larger and more important command but, given the claims of other officers, this was the best Jourdan could do for him. Vandamme led the Advance Guard through the mountains via Freudenstadt. On 5 March, Lefebvre returned to his command. Within a week, part of the advance guard broke off from the main body and, under command of Vandamme, moved to Stuttgart, to investigate the rumored presence of Habsburg units.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|-valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Advance GuardGeneral of Division François Joseph LefebvreAdjutants: Jean-Baptiste Drouet and François-Xavier Octavie Fontaine.

This amounted to approximately 3,000 troops, which weakened both the Reserve and the III.

Division\nThe division crossed the Rhine River at Hüningen near Basel, Switzerland, and marched in two columns eastward. The right column, commanded by Jean Victor Tharreau, moved along the northern shoreline of the Rhine. The left column, commanded by Jean-Baptiste Jacopin, moved at the northernmost rim of the river valley. From Switzerland, Masséna sent a Demi-brigade of the Army of Helvetia to secure Schaffhausen, part of the Swiss cantons that lie north of the Rhine river. In holding Schaffhausen, Masséna insured the passage of Ferino's forward units. Ferino's orders were to proceed from Schaffhausen along the north shore of Lake Constance, also called the Bodensee. His left flank was to remain in contact with the II. Division, to prevent the Austrians from piercing the army's forward line. His advance units were to proceed as far as the Imperial Abbey of Salem. From there, he was instructed to prevent any Austrian reinforcements from Switzerland joining with Archduke Charles, whom Jourdan expected to move across the Iller river near Augsburg, and advance into Swabia.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|-valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"white\"|I.

Division traveling through the Black Forest via Oberkirch, and the Reserve, with most of the artillery park, via the valleys at Freiburg im Breisgau, where the horses would find more forage, and then over the mountains past the Titisee to Löffingen and Hüfingen.  At the Battle of Ostrach, after more than 15&nbsp;hours of general engagement, the Austrians flanked the III. Division's left wing and pressed the entire division back to the Pfullendorf heights.

At the Battle of Ostrach, the Reserve remained in the northern outskirts of Pfullendorf and did not participate in the battle except in small groups. When Jourdan decided to withdraw, d'Hautpoul's cavalry moved to the west first, to secure bridges and the east–west roads. At the battle of Stockach, the Reserve was slow to support of Ferino's I. Division, which had run out of ammunition; when a cavalry charged failed to materialize, the Austrians acquired the upper hand. Jourdan later charged d'Hautpoul with dereliction. After the Stockach engagement, most of the Reserve withdrew to the west side of the Black Forest, where the horses could find forage, but by late April, the Reserve had joined with the André Masséna's Army of Helvetia outside of Zürich; d'Hautpoul joined them in July after he was cleared by a Courts-martial in Strasbourg.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|-valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"white\"|ReserveGeneral of Division Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul\n|- valign=\"top\"|- valign=\"top\"\n! width=25%; align= center | Commander(s)\n! width=30%; align= center | Units\n! width=30%; align= center | Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left |Louis Fursy Henri Compere Christophe Ossvald\nFrançois Léon OrmanceyJean Christophe Collin\n| align= left |\n* 1st Mounted Carabiniers Regiment\n* 2nd Mounted Carabiniers Regiment\n* 4th Cavalry Regiment\n* 6th Cavalry Regiment\n* 7th Cavalry Regiment\n* 8th Cavalry Regiment\n* 23rd Cavalry Regiment\n* 25th Cavalry Regiment\n* 6th Horse Artillery (5th Company)\n* 7th Horse Artillery (2nd Company)\n* 3rd Foot Artillery (2nd and 3rd Company)\n* 3rd Battalion Sappers\n| align= left |\nAntoine Christophe was chef-de-brigade (colonel) of the 1st Regiment; Armand-Augustine-Louis De Caulaincourt was appointed chef-de-brigade of the 2nd Regiment on 30 July 1799; he was wounded on 2 November 1799.
