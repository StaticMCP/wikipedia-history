      "text": "# The Emperors of Chocolate\n\nThe Emperors of Chocolate: Inside the Secret World of Hershey and Mars is a book by Joël Glenn Brenner published on December 22, 1998, by Random House, Inc. The book chronicles the stories of the history of Mars, Incorporated and The Hershey Company.\nIn a review for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Joseph Losos criticized the book's \"naive\" analysis of comparing periods, and said the book would be a disappointment to readers looking for a \"serious, deeply analytical history\" of chocolate companies during the 20th century. However, he praised the book as a journalistic comparison between Milton S. Hershey and Forrest Mars Sr., describing it overall as a \"highly researched, fast-moving\" text.\nReferences"
