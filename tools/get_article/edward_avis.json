      "text": "# Edward Avis\n\nEdward Avis was the stage name of Martin E. Sullivan (1872 - 1955?), an American violinist and stage performer known for his imitations of birdsongs. He performed on the stage in New England and was referred to by the press as \"The Bird Man\".\nSullivan was born in Enfield, Connecticut, and as you child he was said to go into the \"woods with his violin and strike up a chorus among the birds\". He learned the songs of birds around the United States and began to write down their songs, whistle them and produce melodies. He performed for gatherings of the Audubon Societies. A review of a performance in January 1908 \"An Evening in Birdland\" given to members of the Audubon Society at the George Washington University said:\nAvis was a careful imitator of birds and he often performed before academic audiences. He also included a mix of his mimicry with the violin. He also performed for blind audiences. He was a contemporary of Charles Crawford Gorst, Charles Kellogg and several others who specialized in the imitation of birds. His promotional brochures included reviews by John Burroughs and Winthrop Packard. Many recordings were made by Avis for Columbia Records and after the rise in popularity of the radio, he also contributed to radio shows.\nHe was interested in conservation and sponsored a 100 dollar reward for anyone who could find an undisturbed nest of the passenger pigeon in Connecticut as part of a national campaign to rescue the bird from extinction in 1910.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://archive.org/details/78_bird-calls-with-story-part-i_edward-avis-howard-r-garis_gbia0016761 Bird Calls with Story, Part II; Bird Calls with Story, Part I]\n* [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/113640986 Presumed grave]"
