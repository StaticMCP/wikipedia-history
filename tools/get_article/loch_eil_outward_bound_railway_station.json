This station is on the West Highland Line, between Corpach and Locheilside, sited  from Banavie Junction, near Fort William. ScotRail, who manage the station, operate all services.\nHistory\nThis station opened by British Rail on 6 May 1985. Its name refers to the nearby Outward Bound centre that the station was built to serve.\nFacilities\nThe station has a single platform equipped with a shelter, a bench, a help point and some bike racks, as well as a small car park. The station has step-free access from the car park, as well as to the waterfront at Loch Eil. As there are no facilities to purchase tickets, passengers must buy one in advance, or from the guard on the train.\nPassenger volume\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Passenger Volume at Loch Eil Outward Bound\n!\n!2002–03\n!2004–05\n!2005–06\n!2006–07\n!2007–08\n!2008–09\n!2009–10\n!2010–11\n!2011–12\n!2012–13\n!2013–14\n!2014–15\n!2015–16\n!2016–17\n!2017–18\n!2018–19\n!2019–20\n!2020–21\n!2021–22\n!2022–23\n|-\n|Entries and exits\n|611\n|507\n|475\n|637\n|913\n|860\n|548\n|812\n|722\n|578\n|522\n|632\n|478\n|572\n|548\n|554\n|748\n|142\n|1,100\n|1,888\n|}\nThe statistics cover twelve month periods that start in April.\nServices\nFrom Monday to Saturday, three trains stop heading to Glasgow Queen Street (the other terminates at Fort William), and four trains stop on the way to Mallaig.
