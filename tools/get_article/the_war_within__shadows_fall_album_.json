So Far\", the album was listed as number 20 based on poll data from professionals in the metal industry. The editors wrote, \"The Art of Balance, their third album, was solid, but The War Within was where they really hit their stride.

We had been surprised by the success of The Art Of Balance and definitely felt a little pressure to take things to another level, but we did not allow that pressure to change our vision of the band we wanted to be. Our goal was to allow all of our influences shine through while pushing metal into a new direction, creating the music we had always wanted to hear ourselves.\" \"The War Within may be the closest we have come to achieving these goals and that hard work and vision allowed us to get on our first arena tour, our first Grammy nomination, and countless other firsts along the way.”\nIn 2024 the band played 2 separate concerts in celebration of the albums 20th anniversary one in New Jersey on March 16, and a second one at the Worcester Palladium in December.
