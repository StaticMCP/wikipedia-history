To make way for construction of the Ross River Dam in 1970, the Townsville City Council resumed 1620ha of the property's best grazing land.  At its peak, Laudham Park stretched for more than 40,000ha along both banks of the Upper Ross River to the foothills of Mount Stuart and out to the Pinnacles part of Hervey Range. Most of what was Laudham Park is today under water due to the construction  of the dam and the rest is now the suburb of Kelso.
