Named in honor of Anthony of Padua, it falls within the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Wilmington and is operated by the Oblates of St. Francis de Sales. It is situated in Wilmington's Little Italy neighborhood, where the parish includes St. Anthony's School (adjacent to the church) and Padua Academy.\nEvery June, the church runs an Italian Festival, a week-long event which celebrates the Feast of Saint Anthony. This festival features four outdoor cafes, each with their own live entertainment, and unique food selections. The Festival is the second-largest of its kind in the United States. Admission fees were established for the first time in 2008.\nThe Romanesque Revival architectural style owes its inspiration to the Basilica di San Zeno in Verona, Italy. Italian immigrants who settled in the area took seven years to construct the building. Construction was led by Ernesto DiSabatino who later founded EDiS Company and received the Papal Cross of Honor Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice for his efforts for the construction of the church.\nThe church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.\nGallery\nFile:St Anthony of Padua church 6.jpg|The altar and pulpit of the Church\nFile:Beau biden funeral wilminton.jpeg|The funeral of Beau Biden in May 2015 at the church\nSee also\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Wilmington, Delaware\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://sapde.org/ St. Anthony's Church]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110721082532/http://image1.nps.gov:9001/StyleServer/calcrgn?cat=NRHP&item=/Photos/84000851.djvu&style=nps/FOCUS-DJview.xsl&wid=640&hei=480&oif=jpeg&props=item(SUMMARY,COPYRIGHT) NRHP Site Listing with Photos]\n* [http://www.stanthonysfestival.com St. Anthony's Italian Festival web site]"
