The order has two issues: the Governor General issue with the Rhinoceros suspension, and the Democratic Republic of Sudan's issue with the emblem of the Republic (Secretarybird) suspension.\nissue of the Order|272x272px]]\nIt is not permissible to repeat awarding of decorations and medals, or to rise from one class to a higher one, except after the lapse of at least three years from the date of awarding them. This period is reduced to one year for employees if they are referred to retirement. Orders and medals remain the property of the awardee, and their heirs as a souvenir without any of them having the right to carry it. Without prejudice to any other punishment stipulated in the laws of Sudan, it is permissible, by order of the President of the Republic, to strip the bearer of a necklace, sash, medal, medallion, cloak of honour, or belt if they commit an act that is dishonourable or inconsistent with loyalty to the state.\nClasses\nClass I\nIt consists of a silk ribbon of corrugated violet colour, divided longitudinally by seven light green stripes, and ends with a medal consisting of three tandem surfaces, the first of which is white enamel with the inscription \"Democratic Republic of Sudan\" in dark blue and surrounded by the colours of the flag of the Democratic Republic of Sudan on the second surface. The medal hangs from a golden circle in the middle, which is a drawing of the emblem of the Democratic Republic of Sudan circling the scarf from right to left. The sash is followed by a large medal medallion carried on the chest on the left side.\nClass II\nThe Class II and III are made of platinum metal, in addition to yellow enamel motifs at the edges of the second surface. It consists of a necklace made of silk cloth, the same colour as the scarf. It is worn around the neck, and a medallion similar to the medallion of Class I hangs from it, followed by a medallion worn on the chest on the left side, similar to the medallion of the scarf.\nClass III\nIt consists of a necklace of silk fabric similar to the necklace of the Class II, worn around the neck, and a medal similar to the medal of the second class hanging from it.\nClass IV\nIt consists of a medal worn on the chest on the left side.

This circle is attached to an undulating silk ribbon of the same colour as the ribbon of the Class III Medal. Class IV consists of surfaces, the first of which is white enamel with the inscription \"Democratic Republic of Sudan\" in dark blue and surrounded by the colours of the flag of the Democratic Republic of Sudan. The second is made of platinum metal, the edges of which are decorated with small circles of yellow enamel.\nClass V\nIt consists of a medal worn on the chest from the left side.
