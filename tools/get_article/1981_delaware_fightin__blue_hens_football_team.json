      "text": "# 1981 Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens football team\n\nThe '''1981 Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens football team''' was an American football team that represented the University of Delaware as an independent during the 1981 NCAA Division I-AA football season. Delaware ended the regular season ranked No. 7 in the nation, but lost in the first round of the playoffs.\nIn their 16th year under head coach Tubby Raymond, the Hens compiled a 9–3 record (9–2 regular season). Ed Braceland was the team captain.\nStarting the year on a three-game winning streak, the Hens were ranked No. 1 in the first two weeks of the weekly rankings. Though they dropped out of the top 10 in the middle of the year, a strong ending to the season saw them climb back to No. 7 in time to qualify for the eight-team playoff.\nDelaware played its home games at Delaware Stadium on the university campus in Newark, Delaware.\nSchedule\n| September 19 |   | Temple |\n| Delaware Stadium | Newark, DE | W 13 7\n| 22,379 |\n| September 24 | @ | Princeton | 1\n| Palmer Stadium | Princeton, NJ | W 61 8\n| 10,110 |\n| October 3 |    | Lehigh | 1\n| Delaware Stadium | Newark, DE (rivalry) | L 21 24\n| 22,784 |\n| October 10 |   | UMass | T–7\n| Delaware Stadium | Newark, DE | W 38 15\n| 19,581 |\n| October 17 |   | Youngstown State | T–6\n| Delaware Stadium | Newark, DE | L 21 24\n| 18,645 |\n| October 24 |   | Rhode Island |\n| Delaware Stadium | Newark, DE | W 35 15\n| 20,135 |\n| November 7 | @ | Penn |\n| Franklin Field | Philadelphia, PA | W 40 6\n| 10,117 |\n| November 14 |   | Maine | T–10\n| Delaware Stadium | Newark, DE | W 42 35\n| 16,743 |\n| November 21 |   |  | 8\n| Delaware Stadium | Newark, DE (rivalry) | W 31 14\n| 17,767 |\n| November 27 | @ | Connecticut | 7\n| Memorial Stadium | Storrs, CT | W 35 26\n| 5,084 |\n| December 5 | @ | #1 Eastern Kentucky | 7\n| Hanger Field | Richmond, KY (NCAA Division I-AA Quarterfinal) | L 28 35\n| 8,100 |\n}}\nReferences"
