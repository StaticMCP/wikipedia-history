      "text": "# 1886 Redfern colonial by-election\n\nA by-election was held for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly electorate of Redfern on 9 March 1886 because Arthur Renwick was appointed Minister of Public Instruction in the ministry of Sir Patrick Jennings. Under the constitution, ministers in the Legislative Assembly were required to resign to recontest their seats in a by-election when appointed. Such ministerial by-elections were usually uncontested and on this occasion a poll was required for Redfern and Bathurst where Francis Suttor was easily re-elected. The 7 other ministers were re-elected unopposed.\nDates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Date !!
