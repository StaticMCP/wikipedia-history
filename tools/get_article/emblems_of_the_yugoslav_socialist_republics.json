Emblems appeared as a symbol of statehood on the documents of republican level, for example on the signs of the republican institutions, on watermarks of school diplomas, etc.\nThe emblems included old historical symbols where they could demonstrate historical compatibility with the new socialist political system – see Croatian and Serbian traditional emblem in the middle of their coats of arms; also Slovenian Mount Triglav was recognized as a symbol of Slovenian Liberation Front during the National Liberation War during World War II. Where the old symbols were deemed inappropriate (the traditional cross or eagle on the Serbian coat of arms, ethnic or religious coat of arms for Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former traditionally monarchist symbol or the historical lion for Montenegro or the historical lion for Macedonia), prominent features or unofficial national symbols were added, e.g. Mount Lovćen for Montenegro, or a pair of chimneys for Bosnia and Herzegovina. The same with the federal Yugoslav emblem: all separate republican emblems featured a red star and wheat, or other important plants from that region.\nWhile most republics adopted new official arms during the breakup of Yugoslavia, Serbia (as a constituent state of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) retained the emblem from the Yugoslav era until 2004. The present-day arm of North Macedonia is still near identical to the Yugoslav one.\nThe individual emblems of the six Yugoslav socialist republics were as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"background:#284D93\" | Republic\n! style=\"background:#284D93\" | Emblem\n! style=\"background:#284D93\" | Author\n! colspan=2 style=\"background:#284D93\" | Republic-specific features\n! style=\"background:#284D93\" | Present-day coat of arms\n|-\n! rowspan=4 | Bosnia and Herzegovina\n| rowspan=4 align=center |\n| rowspan=4 align=center | Unknown\n| Plants\n| Conifer twig (left), Deciduous twig (right), two sheaves of wheat (lower middle portion)\n| width=\"95\" align=\"center\" rowspan=\"4\" |  Coat of arms of Bosnia and Herzegovina\n|-\n| Landscapes, geographic features\n| Silhouette of Jajce\n|-\n| Industry\n| two factory chimneys\n|-\n| Ornaments\n| red ribbon\n|-\n! rowspan=4 | Croatia\n| rowspan=4 align=center |\n| rowspan=4 align=center | Antun Augustinčićand Vanja Radauš\n| Plants\n| Wheat\n| rowspan=4 align=center |  Coat of arms of Croatia\n|-\n| Landscapes, geographic features\n| Adriatic Sea, rising sun\n|-\n| Industry\n| Iron anvil\n|-\n| Ornaments\n| Chequy\n|-\n! rowspan=4 | Macedonia\n| rowspan=4 align=center |\n| rowspan=4 align=center |\n| Plants\n| Garland of wheat, tobacco leaves and poppy buds\n| rowspan=4 align=center |  Emblem of North Macedonia\n|-\n| Landscapes, geographic features\n| River Vardar, Mount Korab, sunrise, sky\n|-\n| Industry\n| –\n|-\n| Ornaments\n| ribbon with traditional Macedonian embroidery\n|-\n! rowspan=4 | Montenegro\n| rowspan=4 align=center |\n| rowspan=4 align=center | and Milo Milunović\n| Plants\n| laurel wreath\n| rowspan=4 align=center |  Coat of arms of Montenegro\n|-\n| Landscapes, geographic features\n| Mount Lovćen, Adriatic Sea\n|-\n| Industry\n| –\n|-\n| Ornaments\n| Montenegrin tricolour of Pan-Slavic colors\n|-\n! rowspan=4 | Serbia\n| rowspan=4 align=center |\n| rowspan=4 align=center | Đorđe Andrejević Kun\n| Plant\n| sheaf of wheat (left), sheaf of oak leaves with acorns (right)\n| rowspan=4 align=center |  Coat of arms of Serbia\n|-\n| Landscapes, geographic features\n| sunrise, sky\n|-\n| Industry\n| cog-wheel\n|-\n| Ornaments\n| red track (with inscriptions), Serbian traditional symbol\n|-\n! rowspan=4 | Slovenia\n| rowspan=4 align=center |\n| rowspan=4 align=center |\n| Plants\n| wheat, leaves of linden\n| rowspan=4 align=center |  Coat of arms of Slovenia\n|-\n| Landscapes, geographic features\n| Triglav, sea\n|-\n| Industry\n| –\n|-\n| Ornaments\n| red ribbon\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* Emblem of Yugoslavia\n* Coat of arms of Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* Coat of arms of Croatia\n* Emblem of North Macedonia\n* Coat of arms of Montenegro\n* Coat of arms of Serbia\n* Coat of arms of Slovenia\n* Socialist-style emblems\nReferences"
