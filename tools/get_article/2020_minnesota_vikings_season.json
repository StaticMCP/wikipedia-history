      "text": "# 2020 Minnesota Vikings season\n\nThe 2020 season was the Minnesota Vikings' 60th in the National Football League (NFL), their fifth playing home games at U.S. Bank Stadium and their seventh under head coach Mike Zimmer. This was the Vikings' first time since 2005 that long-time assistant Kevin Stefanski was not part of the Vikings coaching staff, as he left to become the new head coach of the Cleveland Browns on January 12, 2020. After going 1–5 in their first six games for the first time since 2013, the team failed to improve upon their 10–6 record from 2019 after a Week 11 loss to the Dallas Cowboys and failed to match their 10–6 record after a Week 14 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\nThe Vikings were eliminated from playoff contention following a week 16 loss to the New Orleans Saints, and ultimately finished 7–9, their first losing season since 2014. The Vikings conceded 475 points during the season, the third-highest total in franchise history, although they also managed to score 430 points, also the third-most in team history.\nOffseason\nTransactions\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Players lost in 2020\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Name\n!style=\"\"| Position\n!style=\"\"| Type\n!style=\"\"| 2020 team\n!style=\"\"| Contract\n!style=\"\"| Ref.\n|-\n| Mackensie Alexander\n| CB\n| UFA\n| Cincinnati Bengals\n| 1 year, $4&nbsp;million\n|\n|-\n| Kentrell Brothers\n| LB\n| UFA\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| Stefon Diggs\n| WR\n| Trade\n| Buffalo Bills\n|\n|\n|-\n| Everson Griffen\n| DE\n| UFA\n| Dallas Cowboys\n| 1 year, $6&nbsp;million\n|\n|-\n| Linval Joseph\n| DT\n| Released\n| Los Angeles Chargers\n| 2 years, $17&nbsp;million\n|\n|-\n| Jayron Kearse\n| S\n| UFA\n| Detroit Lions\n| 1 year, $2&nbsp;million\n|\n|-\n| Josh Kline\n| G\n| Released\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| David Morgan II\n| TE\n| Released\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| Xavier Rhodes\n| CB\n| Released\n| Indianapolis Colts\n| 1 year, $3.25&nbsp;million\n|\n|-\n| Andrew Sendejo\n| S\n| UFA\n| Cleveland Browns\n| 1 year, $2.25&nbsp;million\n|\n|-\n| Marcus Sherels\n| CB\n| UFA\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| Laquon Treadwell\n| WR\n| UFA\n| Atlanta Falcons\n| 1 year, $910,000\n|\n|-\n| Trae Waynes\n| CB\n| UFA\n| Cincinnati Bengals\n| 3 years, $42&nbsp;million\n|\n|-\n| Stephen Weatherly\n| DE\n| UFA\n| Carolina Panthers\n| 2 years, $12.5&nbsp;million\n|\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Players signed in 2020\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Name\n!style=\"\"| Position\n!style=\"\"| Type\n!style=\"\"| 2019 team\n!style=\"\"| Contract\n!style=\"\"| Ref.\n|-\n| Ameer Abdullah\n| RB\n| UFA\n| Minnesota Vikings\n| 1 year, $1.0475&nbsp;million\n|\n|-\n| Dan Bailey\n| K\n| UFA\n| Minnesota Vikings\n| 3 years, $10&nbsp;million\n|\n|-\n| Britton Colquitt\n| P\n| UFA\n| Minnesota Vikings\n| 3 years, $9&nbsp;million\n|\n|-\n| Kirk Cousins\n| QB\n| Extension\n| Minnesota Vikings\n| 2 years, $66&nbsp;million\n|\n|-\n| Dakota Dozier\n| T\n| UFA\n| Minnesota Vikings\n| 1 year, $1&nbsp;million\n|\n|-\n| DeMarquis Gates\n| LB\n| UFA\n| Houston Roughnecks (XFL)\n| 1 year, $610,000\n|\n|-\n| C.

Although they had lost their original fifth-round pick to the Baltimore Ravens in the trade for kicker/punter Kaare Vedvik prior to the 2019 season and their seventh-round pick in the trade that sent wide receiver Stefon Diggs to the Buffalo Bills earlier in the 2020 offseason, the Diggs trade gave the Vikings extra picks in the first, fifth and sixth rounds. They also had an extra pick in the seventh round after trading guard Danny Isidora to the Miami Dolphins at the start of the 2019 season, as well as one compensatory pick in the third round and two in the seventh as a result of free agency losses in 2019.\nAfter taking LSU wide receiver Justin Jefferson 22nd overall with the first-round pick they acquired from the Bills, the Vikings traded their original first-round pick (25th overall) to the San Francisco 49ers in exchange for the 31st overall pick, as well as selections in the fourth and fifth rounds; with the 31st overall pick, the Vikings took TCU cornerback Jeff Gladney. The Vikings used their second-round pick on Boise State offensive tackle Ezra Cleveland, then took Mississippi State cornerback Cameron Dantzler in the third round, before trading their third-round compensatory pick to the New Orleans Saints for the Saints' remaining picks in the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh rounds.\nIn the fourth round, the Vikings used the picks they acquired from the 49ers and Saints to select South Carolina defensive end D. J. Wonnum and Baylor defensive tackle James Lynch, before taking Oregon linebacker Troy Dye with their original fourth-round pick. The Vikings traded the fifth-round pick they acquired from the Bills to the Chicago Bears for a fourth-round pick in the 2021 draft, before using their remaining fifth-round selections on Temple Owls cornerback Harrison Hand and Miami (FL) wide receiver K. J. Osborn. In the sixth round, the Vikings traded the other pick they acquired from the Bills—along with the seventh-round selection they got from the Dolphins—to the Ravens for another seventh-round pick and a fifth-round pick in 2021 before taking Oregon State offensive tackle Blake Brandel and Michigan safety Josh Metellus. The Vikings then had four remaining picks in the seventh round, which they used on Michigan State Spartans defensive end Kenny Willekes, Iowa quarterback Nate Stanley, Mississippi State safety Brian Cole II and Washburn guard Kyle Hinton.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|style=\"background:lightsteelblue; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:2em;\"|\n|Pro Bowler\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\" style=\"\"| 2020 Minnesota Vikings draft\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Draft order\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Player name\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Position\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| College\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Contract\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Notes\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Round\n!style=\"\"| Selection\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"| 1 || 22\n|style=\"background:lightsteelblue\"| Justin Jefferson || WR || LSU || 4 years, $13.123&nbsp;million || From Bills}}\n|-\n! 25\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the San Francisco 49ers}} ||\n|-\n! 31\n| Jeff Gladney || CB || TCU || 4 years, $10.991&nbsp;million || From 49ers\n|-\n! 2 || 58\n| Ezra Cleveland || OT || Boise State || 4 years, $5.537&nbsp;million ||\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 3 || 89\n| Cameron Dantzler || CB || Mississippi State || 4 years, $4.586&nbsp;million ||\n|-\n! 105\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the New Orleans Saints || Compensatory pick\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"| 4 || 117\n| D.

Cook received the most votes among NFC running backs to go to his second Pro Bowl (after his rookie season in 2017), and only Russell Wilson received more votes out of any position in the NFC team, while Jefferson was the Vikings' first rookie wide receiver to be selected since Percy Harvin in 2009.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
