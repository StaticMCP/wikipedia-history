It was released as a single through YSL Records and 300 Entertainment on February 14, 2022. Produced by Metro Boomin and mastered by Joe LaPorta, the song was originally included on the deluxe edition of Gunna's third studio album, DS4Ever, but he took the deluxe edition down and released the song as a standalone single on Valentine's Day.\nBackground and composition\nGunna previewed \"Banking on Me\" through an Instagram story in late 2021. On January 11, 2022, he released the deluxe edition of his third studio album, DS4Ever, with the song being one of four new tracks, but removed the deluxe edition the same day. Gunna later released it as a single on Valentine's Day. Gunna raps over romantic piano lines with crudely suggestive lyrics, saying he would not want to \"get tired\" of his girlfriend, who delivers sexual variety.\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Weekly chart performance for \"Banking on Me\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2022)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ)\n| 19\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 2022 year-end chart performance for \"Banking on Me\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2022)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs (Billboard)\n| 52\n|}\nCertifications\nReferences"
