Separate rankings were published by the Associated Press (AP) and the United Press International (UPI). The AP rankings were selected by a board of sports writers, and the UPI rankings were selected by a board of small-college coaches.\nThe 1971 Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens football team (10–1), led by head coach Tubby Raymond, was rated No. 1 by both the AP and UPI. McNeese State (9–1–1) and Eastern Michigan (7–1–2) were ranked No. 2 and No. 3, respectively, by both the AP and the UPI.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n|
