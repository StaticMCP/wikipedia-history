The game included art by F.Scott McKown.\nReception\nAllen Varney reviewed the 1985 release of Advanced Cassiopeian Empire in Space Gamer No. 76. Varney commented that \"There's so much wrong with this game that I can't even find the parts that are right . . . assuming there are any. Such searching doesn't seem worth the effort.\"\nLawrence Schick called this game \"Amateurish\", and noted that the character creation rules were similar to Traveller.\nReferences"
