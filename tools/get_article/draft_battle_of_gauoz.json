As the French were advancing into a nearby town, they were forced to retreat on account of their already high casualties (≈150) and their inability to push further into hostile Zaian territory.\nBefore the battle\nThe most probable reason for the French to move to Gaouz were their concerns about Zaian rebels proximity to French Algeria and them possibly threatening the French at Bechar, which held strategic importance as it provided more easily traversable land connecting northern Algeria to Tindouf and the southern French colonies. However, it’s most likely that this was retaliation for the killing of a French translator at the French mission in Tighmart, which was established on concerns of a German presence in the area.\nThe southwestern areas of Morocco were also one of the last regions in north Africa the French hadn’t yet pacified, which was one of their main objectives during the war.\nPaul Doury with the strategic advice of Paul Prosper Henrys, embarked to pacify the southwestern areas and remove the Zaian presence in the area as they had concerns about the Zaian proximity to french Algeria, specifically Béchar and the smaller towns around it.\nCourse of the battle\nThe exact movements and positions of the battle aren’t known, but it’s certain that a sub-group of Paul Doury’s men were ambushed near an oasis from about 100-200 meters away by Zaian tribesmen. Paul Dourys sub-group, which was cornered and cut off from the rest of the force under continued fire was promptly wiped out by the Zaian forces.\nEven with artillery and air support, the French still took heavy casualties and lost a notable amount of equipment (Munitions, Firearms, Artillery, Transport, etc.)\nLyautey, who had received word of this loss and had already seen the areas surrounding Gaouz with little significance, reprimanded Doury by placing him under Joseph-François Poeymirau's command while refuting Doury's claim of nearly wiping out the Zaian force.\nReferences"
