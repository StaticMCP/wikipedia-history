The Constitutional Court declared that the Marriage Act, 1961 and Divorce Act, 1979 were unconstitutional insofar as they failed to recognise and regulate marriages solemnised in accordance with sharia and not registered as civil marriages. This failure was inconsistent with various constitutional rights in sections 9, 10, 28 and 34 of the Constitution of South Africa. The judgment was unanimous and was written by Acting Justice Pule Tlaletsi.\nThe case originated in the Western Cape High Court, where it was decided by Judge Nolwazi Mabindla-Boqwana.\nSee also\n* South African family law\n* Constitutional litigation in South Africa\n* Section Nine of the Constitution of South Africa\nReferences"
