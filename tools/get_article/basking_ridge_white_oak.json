The tree was over 600 years old and died in 2016, before being cut down in 2017. It stood at  tall, and may have been the oldest white oak in the world.\nHistory\nThe Basking Ridge white oak was located in the historical graveyard of the Presbyterian Church in Basking Ridge. English evangelist George Whitfield and American clergyman James Davenport preached under it on November 5, 1740 to a crowd of 3,000 during the First Great Awakening. George Washington's troops were drilled on the village green, within view, and Washington picnicked under the tree with Lafayette. The 5,500 French troops under General Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur marched by in 1781 on their route to Yorktown, Virginia and the decisive battle of the American Revolutionary War.\nDescription\nThe Holy Oak was 619 years old when it died in 2016. It stood at a height of  and had a trunk circumference of . Its spread was over . In its final years, its lower branches were supported by metal bars.\nDeath and cutting down\nIn June 2016, the tree was \"failing to thrive\" and showed signs of distress as its upper parts failed to sprout leaves. By September 2016, the tree had died. It was cut down over a three-day period, with the work finished on April 26, 2017. A young white oak grown from an acorn of the old tree was planted in the churchyard.\nThe current biggest tree in New Jersey is identified as another white oak in the yard of the Sparta Historical Association of Sparta.\nSee also\n* List of individual trees\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.bernards.org/ Bernards Township]"
