The division saw service on the Western Front and later on the Italian Front.\nFormation history\nresting before going into the trenches. Southern Road, Mametz Wood, France, 17 July 1916.]]\nThe division was formed as part of the fifth wave (K5) of divisions in the New Army; it did not have a regional title, but was composed primarily of recruits from the south of England. Several of its battalions had been raised by local communities and were named for their towns or industries. After training and home service, the 41st Division, commanded by Major-General Sydney Lawford, deployed overseas to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front in the first week of May 1916; its first major combat came in September of that year, at the Battle of Flers–Courcelette, part of the larger Battle of the Somme.\n.]]\nAfter fighting in 1917 at the Battle of Messines and the Battle of Passchendaele (also known as the Third Battle of Ypres) it was transferred with four other divisions to the Italian Front. It remained here for three months throughout the winter of 1917–18 before returning to the Western Front, where it arrived just before the German Army launched its Spring Offensive in March. It participated in the Allied \"Hundred Days Offensive\" and ended the war in Flanders, from where it moved to join the Army of Occupation in Germany, following the Armistice of 11 November 1918.\nThe 41st Division was commanded by Major-General Lawford throughout its existence  and was demobilised in March 1919, with some units transferred to the 47th (1/2nd London) Division, British Army of the Rhine (BAOR).\nOrder of battle\nThe 41st Division was constituted as follows during the war:\n122nd Brigade\n* 12th (Service) Battalion, East Surrey Regiment (Bermondsey)\n* 15th (Service) Battalion, Hampshire Regiment (2nd Portsmouth)\n* 11th (Service) Battalion, Queen's Own (Royal West Kent Regiment) (Lewisham) (disbanded March 1918)\n* 18th (Service) Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps (Arts and Crafts)\n*122nd Machine Gun Company (joined May 1916, moved to 41st Battalion Machine Gun Corps (M.G.C.)
