Shiva is worshipped as Sakshinathar, and is represented here by a Lingam. His consort, Parvati, is depicted as Ikshuvani.

Vannimaram, a tree also gave evidence in the same case. The legend is documented both in Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam and the legend of the temple. As per another legend, the place was not affected by the great deluge (puram) and remained beyond it (puram), which is locally called Thirupurambiyam. Once, Shiva appeared as Dakshinamurthy when a farmer carrying log of wood worshipped Shiva in this place. The shrine of Dakshinamurthy outside the gateway tower is believed to be the place where Shiva appeared. As per another legend, there was a king named Ariduvssan who was cursed by sage Durvasa. He worshipped Shiva at this place to relieve himself off the curse.\nHistory\nThiruppurambiyam was the fierce battlefield in the 9th century deciding the bright future of Cholas.
