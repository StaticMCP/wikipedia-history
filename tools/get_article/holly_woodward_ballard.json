She also examines the intra-skeletal ontogenetic histology of extant tetrapods to improve understanding of bone tissue microstructures for use as a foundation in paleohistological interpretations.\nPublications\nBallard's notable publications include:\n* Growing up Tyrannosaurus rex: Osteohistology refutes the pygmy \"Nanotyrannus\" and supports ontogenetic niche partitioning in juvenile Tyrannosaurus.\n* Ruling Reptiles: Crocodylian Biology and Archosaur Paleobiology.\n* The earliest Pleistocene record of a large-bodied hominin from the Levant supports two out-of-Africa dispersal events.\n* Archosauromorpha: Avemetatarsalia – Dinosaurs and Their Relatives.\nReferences"
