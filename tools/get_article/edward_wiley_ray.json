Before Ray joined the company SOM had produced a couple of national hit records, one of which was the iconic record  “Wooly Bully” by Sam the Sham & Pharaohs that was distributed by MGM Records.\nWhile at SOM, Ray terminated and negotiated new foreign music publishing and performance rights agreements for SOM's music publishing companies; terminated and negotiated new SOM artists distribution agreements; and expanded SOM's Recording Studio's custom service business. Some of the artists represented by Ray while at SOM were Solomon Burke, Jazz organist Jimmy Smith, the Ovations,  Barbara and the Browns, hit songwriter/artist George Jackson and others.\nAlso, while still at SOM, Ray established his own company, Eddie Ray Music Enterprises, that among its other activities, established a vocational commercial music school named, The Tennessee College of Recording Arts and Sciences.  Ray operated the school for two years and then assisted in incorporating the school's commercial music program curricula into a degree program offered by Memphis State University's (presently known as the University of Memphis) College of Fine Arts & Communications.\nIn 1976, Ray joined Cream/Hi Records as executive vice president and general manager.  Ray was also responsible for the management of Cream/HI Records’ music publishing company, East Memphis Music, a former  Stax Record music publishing company.   Hi Records was a successful R&B Independent record label. Some of HI Records artists were Hall of Fame and Grammy award artist & songwriter Al Green,  Ann Peebles,  Ace Cannon, and the Bill Black Combo.\nCream/Hi Records was well known for the numerous valuable music copyrights they owned which included songs  such as “In The Midnight Hour”,  “Knock On Wood”, “Green Onions”,  “Hold On I'm Coming”,  “Respect”,  “Soul Man”,  “Lets Stay Together” and many others.\nAppointment to US Copyright Tribunal\nIn October, 1981, Ray was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, and confirmed by the US senate, to serve as a US Commissioner on the US Copyright Royalty Tribunal (CRT), for the unexpired term of a commissioner who resigned. Then in September 1982, President Reagan nominated Ray for the second for a full term of seven years as a Commissioner on the CRT.\nThe CRT's primary responsibilities was (1) to set the Statutory Rates for certain sections of  the Compulsory Licensing provisions of the US Copyright Act; and (2) to conduct Distribution Hearings to distribute Statutory Royalty funds that were deposited directly to the US Copyright Office by copyright users to be distributed to the appropriate copyright owners.\nDuring Ray's tenure, the CRT conducted one Statutory Rate Hearing and raised the original rate set by Congress for Cable/Satellite companies that retransmitted broadcast signals into a distant market. The definition of “distant market” was thirty miles from the location where the broadcast signal originated. The CRT's Cable/Satellite rate final Determination cause a tremendous controversy among Cable/Satellite companies and several members of Congress who believed the rate was much too high. The Cable/ Satellite companies appealed the CRT's Determination to the Second Federal Circuit Court in Washington, DC  and the Court upheld the CRT's Determination in full.\nThe CRT also conducted a Distribution Hearing each year while Ray served as Commissioner at the CRT. During each of the Distribution Hearings, copyright owners were represented by copyright Claimants MPAA(for movies & TV Situation Comedies); Joints Sports (for  NBA, Major League Baseball &  NCAA ); Devotionals (TV Religious Programs); Music Performance Societies ( BMI, ASCAP, SESAC );  PBS; and  NPR.\nThe CRT annually distributed approximately $200,000,000 in royalties. In each of the Distribution Hearing's the CRT's final Determination were challenged by one or more of the copyright Claimants and appealed to the Second Federal Circuit Court in Washington, D.C. In each Distribution Hearing appeal, the Circuit Court upheld the CRT's determination.\nTribunal controversy\nPresident Reagan appointed Marianne Mele Hall to be Commissioner at the CRT.  Commissioner Hall attempted to get Congress to change the law to permit only attorneys to serve as commissioners on the CRT which would have directly affected Commissioner Ray and Commissioner Mario Aguero, a Cuban-American on the CRT.   Ray and Aguero were the only minority members and the only non-attorneys on the CRT at the time. During Hall's campaign to have Congress change the law, she noted that she had co-authored a book entitled, “Foundations of Sand”. Later a reporter who had interviewed her secured the book and read it.  The book contained disparaging remarks about African Americans, suggesting they were inferior to Caucasians quoting, “They insist on preserving their jungle freedoms, their women, their avoidance of personal responsibility, and their abhorrence of the work ethic”.\nSeveral national articles about the controversy appeared in newspapers across the country including the Washington Post, New York Times, and LA Times.  The controversy also raised additional scrutiny regarding Presidential appointees and their vetting process in Congress and the public.\nHall later tried to claim she only edited “Foundations of Sand” and was not a co-author. Despite her efforts to distance herself from the book, Hall's association to the book damaged her character and caused national embarrassment for the Reagan Administration which forced her to resign from the CRT.\nCommissioner Ray became Acting Chairman of the CRT after Commissioner Hall's resignation and appeared before Congress to respond to the issues that had been raised during the controversy. In addition, he oversaw changes to the CRT like the reduction of commissions from 7 to 5 which were voted on by Congress in response to the issues raised during the Hall controversy.\nOn September 29, 1989, Commissioner Ray's term at the CRT expired and he did not seek another term.\nNorth Carolina Music Hall of Fame\nFrom October 1989 through 2009 Ray was an independent commercial music consultant for various national record/music clients.   During this period he also wrote and self-published books of poetry entitled Natural Expression, Straight From The Heart, Reflections On The Joys & Sorrows of The Heart, Thorns And Roses, and Up From The Mountains.\nIn January 2009, Ray became vice chairman of the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame (NCMHOF) and operation director of its Hall of Fame Museum in  Kannapolis, North Carolina.  The NCMHOF is a non-profit organization and museum that was created to honor musicians, composers and artists with ties to North Carolina that have made significant impact in the music industry.  Ray was instrumental in reopening the museum and moving it from its original home in  Thomasville, North Carolina, to its present location in Kannapolis.\nIn October 2009, Ray was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame as a non-performing artist, originally from the State of North Carolina.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
