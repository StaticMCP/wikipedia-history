However, due to the global pandemic, the ceremony was moved online and hosted by Tanith White (1x Olympic silver and 2 x World silver medalist) and Charlie White, (Olympic and two time world Champion) ice dancers who brought their expertise and energy to the first-ever virtual event.\nIn 2023 and 2024, the ceremony was held in Zürich, Switzerland, alongside an on-ice live show in partnership with Art on Ice and was streamed on the Skating ISU YouTube channel.\nIn 2025, changes were made to the Awards. They will be called the “ISU Figure Skating Awards” and will be a standalone event. The ceremony will take place on 30 March in Boston, Massachusetts on the final day of the ISU World Figure Skating Championships.\nThe hosts of the awards have included legends of Figure Skating and icons from the world of sport, such as Elma Smit (TV presenter and journalist), Kurt Browning (four-time World Champion and skating legend), and Johnny Weir (two-time Olympian, World bronze medalist and TV commentator).
