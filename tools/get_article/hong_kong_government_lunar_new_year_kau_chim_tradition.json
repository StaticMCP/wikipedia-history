      "text": "# Hong Kong Government Lunar New Year kau chim tradition\n\nIn each year's Chinese New Year celebrations in Hong Kong, a member of the Hong Kong Government represents the city in a divination ritual called kau chim. The event takes place on the second day of the Lunar New Year at Che Kung temple, Sha Tin, where a fortune stick is drawn.  The luck of the city for that upcoming Lunar year will be foretold by the message on the fortune stick.  The message is written in the form of classical Chinese poetry and is then interpreted by a Feng shui sifu or fortune teller.\nTradition\nUsually one stick is drawn for the fortune of the city by a main representative person.  Other sticks may be drawn for smaller community divinations.  There are five categories of stick fortunes, from good (上), to mid (中), to bad (下).  Each level also has internal degrees.  For example, stick #27 is unlucky.  It relates to the story of Qin Shi Huang, first emperor of the Qin dynasty, who built the Great Wall of China and sparked widespread opposition among his people.\nResults\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! width=5% | Year of the\n! width=5% | Timeframe\n! width=5% | Stickdrawer\n! width=5% | Sticknumber\n! width=10% | Result\n|-\n| Goat || 15 Feb 19913 Feb 1992 || || ||\n|-\n| Monkey || 4 Feb 199222 Jan 1993 || || 27 || Bad\n|-\n| Rooster || 23 Jan 19939 Feb 1994 || || ||\n|-\n| Dog || 10 Feb 199430 Jan 1995 || || ||\n|-\n| Pig || 31 Jan 199518 Feb 1996 || ||61\n|\n|-\n| Rat || 19 Feb 19966 Feb 1997 || ||70\n|\n|-\n| Ox || 7 Feb 1997 27 Jan 1998 || ||81\n|\n|-\n| Tiger || 28 Jan 199815 Feb 1999 || ||37\n|\n|-\n| Rabbit || 16 Feb 19994 Feb 2000 || Lui Hau-tuen || 34 ||\n|-\n| Dragon || 5 Feb 200023 Jan 2001 || Lui Hau-tuen || 91 ||\n|-\n| Snake || 24 Jan 200111 Feb 2002 || Lui Hau-tuen  || 30 ||\n|-\n| Horse || 12 Feb 200231 Jan 2003 || Lui Hau-tuen  || 38 ||\n|-\n| Goat || 1 Feb 200321 Jan 2004 || Patrick Ho Chi-ping || 83 || Bad\n|-\n| Monkey || 22 Jan 20048 Feb 2005 || Lau Wong-fat || 76 || Mid\n|-\n| Rooster || 9 Feb 200528 Jan 2006 || Lau Wong-fat || 53 || Mid\n|-\n| Dog || 29 Jan 200617 Feb 2007 || Lau Wong-fat || 75 || Good\n|-\n| Pig ||  18 Feb 20076 Feb 2008 || Lau Wong-fat || 36 || Mid\n|-\n| Rat || 7 Feb 200825 Jan 2009 || Lau Wong-fat || 60 || Good\n|-\n| Ox || 26 Jan 200913 Feb 2010 || Lau Wong-fat || 27 || Bad\n|-\n| Tiger || 14 Feb 20102 Feb 2011 || Lau Wong-fat || 53 || Mid\n|-\n| Rabbit ||  3 Feb 201122 Jan 2012 || Lau Wong-fat || 11 || Mid\n|-\n| Dragon ||  23 Jan 201209 Feb 2013 || Lau Wong-fat || 29 || Mid\n|-\n| Snake ||  10 Feb 201330 Jan 2014 || Lau Wong-fat || 95 || Bad\n|-\n|Horse\n|31 Jan 2014\n18 Feb 2015\n|Lau Wong-fat\n|4\n|Mid\n|-\n|Goat\n|19 Feb 2015\n7 Feb 2016\n|Lau Wong-fat\n|20\n|Mid\n|-\n|Monkey\n|8 Feb 2016\n27 Jan 2017\n|Kenneth Lau\n|72\n|Good\n|-\n|Rooster\n|28 Jan 2017\n15 Feb 2018\n|Kenneth Lau\n|61\n|Mid\n|-\n|Dog\n|16 Feb 2018\n4 Feb 2019\n|Kenneth Lau\n|21/41\n|Mid\n|-\n|Pig\n|5 Feb 2019\n24 Jan 2020\n|Kenneth Lau\n|86\n|Mid\n|-\n|Rat\n|25 Jan 2020\n11 Feb 2021\n|Kenneth Lau\n|92\n|Mid\n|}\nSee also\n* Chinese spiritual world concepts\n* Dajiao\n* Jiaobei\n* Tai Sui\n* Timeline of Hong Kong history\n* Tung Shing\nReferences"
