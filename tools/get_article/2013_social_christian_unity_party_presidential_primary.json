The two main traditional factions of PUSC (Calderonistas and Liberals) competed for the nomination. The competing parties were Costa Rica's Children's Hospital Dr. Rodolfo Hernández, and the lawyer, businessman, and former president of the Costa Rican Social Security Fund Rodolfo Piza. This was PUSC's fifth primary election in its history and the first in twelve years.\nHernández was nominated by the group “Calderonista Convergence”, close to former president Rafael Ángel Calderón Fournier who personally endorsed Hernández and followed the “Calderonism” (the historical ideology of 40's caudillo and Fournier's father Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia, a Christian socialist) whilst Piza was endorsed by the Social Christian Rebirth group, part of the more right-wing Liberal faction led by former president (and Fournier's rival) Miguel Ángel Rodríguez Echeverría. On this election Piza had the support of Dr. Abel Pacheco's faction including Pacheco himself and his prime minister Ricardo Toledo.\nHernández won the primary by a landslide victory with 77% of the votes and nominates Piza as his Vice-president. Nevertheless, Hernández would resign his candidacy a few months later accusing the Party's leadership of treacheries and backstabbing. Piza took over the candidacy reaching only 6% of popular vote on the presidential ballot, but increasing its support for Congress to the point of duplicating its number of deputies.\nSee also\n* 2014 Costa Rican general election\n* Citizens' Action Party presidential primary, 2013\nReferences"
