After this was rejected, Magnus Eriksson invaded Novgorod, being defeated in a battle at Schabtschin or Zjabtje, suffering 500 killed and some captured. Nevertheless, he continued towards Nöteborg (modern-day Shlisselburg), capturing it on 6 August. After the capture, he left a small garrison in the fortress and departed. The fortress was recaptured in February of March of 1349. Later, in 1350, according to a later source \"King Magnus' Will\", Magnus went on another campaign. He won several victories but was unable to attack Nöteborg due to the garrison's size. Instead, he began planning a trade blockade against Novgorod while Novgorodian troops raided Viborg in March 1351. In April or May 1351, a peace treaty or truce was signed, with the exact result of the crusade being debated.\nBackground\nIn 1346, according to Icelandic annals, Novgorodian troops attacked Swedish territory, which would serve as a justification for the crusade. Additionally, it may be to follow in Torkel Knutsson's footsteps and conquer more territory, as he did in the Third Swedish Crusade. The crusade may also have been inspired by Bridget of Sweden.\nIn 1348, Magnus Eriksson sent envoys to challenge the Novgorodians on a theological debate with his philosophers over whether Catholicism or Orthodoxy was the true faith, saying that the loser would adopt the winner's religion. This was rejected, even with the threat of war, as the Novgorodians told Magnus' envoys to take the issue to Constantinople, angering Magnus. After, they met with Magnus near Orekhov to negotiate. However, Magnus refused, telling the Novgorodian envoys: \"I have no grievance whatever against you\" implying that their refusal had not upset him. However, he later demanded \"Adopt my faith, or I will march against you with my whole force\". The Novgorodians promptly withdrew as Magnus began leading his forces up the Neva to besiege Nöteborg. According to the \"förbindelsedikten\" his army also consisted of Danish and German support troops.\nCrusade\n1348–1349\nThe first military action of the war was Magnus' forces beginning forceful baptisms onto the Ingrian population, exposing those who refused to violence. Once these were reported, Novgorod mobilized with military support from Pskov. A smaller force (druzhina) of 400 men led by Ontsifor Lukinitj, Yakov Khotov, and Mikhail Fefilatov was sent to intercept the Swedes. Both sides met in a battle at Schabtschin or Zjabtje in Vod according to the Suzdalian Chronicle, and according to the Novgorod Chronicle, the Swedes and Novgorodians lost 500 and 3 men in the battle respectively. The Swedes also suffered some captured, though the number isn't specified. However, historian Dick Harrison claims this battle did not take place, instead claiming that the Novgorodians quickly retreated after a simple raid.\nDespite the defeat (which is unnamed in Swedish sources), the Swedes continued their march towards Nöteborg (modern-day Shlisselburg), where they began besieging it on 24 June. During the siege, the Novgorodians made a successful sortie, but the Swedes were too strong and eventually captured it on 6 August. In the aftermath, the Swedes took around 500 Novgorodians captive, releasing most of them after shaving their beards and baptizing them, except for a few more prominent people including the fortress’s commander, Abraham. Kuzma Tverdislavitj was also captured, who was a noble. The capture of the fortress meant total Swedish control of the Neva River.\nAfter capturing Nöteborg, Magnus departed back to Sweden, leaving a small garrison in the city. Due to the importance of Nöteborg, a Novgorodian army of 1,000 men approached the city soon after and besieged it on their own. This is because neither Prince Ivan or troops from Pskov wanted to help. Additionally, after the capture of Nöteborg, the Swedes tried and failed to capture Kexholm (modern-day Priozersk).\nAfter a prolonged siege, Nöteborg was recaptured with minimal losses for the Novgorodians on 24 February or 9 March of 1349 after the Swedish garrison had suffered from starvation and lack of reinforcements. In the aftermath, many Swedes were killed and captured. Novgorodian raiding parties also went north. Further details on what happened in 1349 are sparse. However, in a letter from 2 July 1349, Magnus allowed Lübeck and other cities to continue trading with Livonia and Gotland, on the condition that they avoid trading with Novgorodians, Russians, and people from Pskov.\n1350–1351\nDuring 1350, mobilizations began in Sweden, which had also been impacted by the Black Death. Magnus most likely hired foreign mercenaries to go on a new campaign. Due to low funds, Magnus was forced to raise taxes to pay for the mercenaries. Magnus also received full support from the Pope, even if the taxes were unpopular among the people. During the beginning of the campaign, Magnus won large victories, but was unable to attack Nöteborg since the garrison was too large. Later, after withdrawing to Ladoga, the Swedish army was surrounded by a larger Novgorodian force in Lovkaån. However, the Swedes managed to escape, even if the fleet was scattered by a storm. The source describing the events of this campaign, \"King Magnus' will\" was written much later, making it potentially unreliable. However, Dick Harrison says it is not unlikely that the campaign did occur.\ndeparture from it.]]\nIn early 1351, Magnus worked to establish a blockade of trade towards Novgorod. In the spring, Novgorodian forces under the command of Simeon of Moscow raided Finland. They later made it to Viborg (modern-day Vyborg) on 21 March, razing the outskirts. However, they were unable to breach the walls, and soon retreated. They also exchanged prisoners with the Swedes at Dorpat (modern-day Tartu). In the spring or summer of the same year, Clement VI in a bull dated to 14 March agreed to let Magnus borrow half of the funds needed for a new crusade against Novgorod. Additionally, he told the archbishops and bishops in the north to preach the crusade and for the Teutonic Order to support it.\nAftermath\nExactly when a peace treaty was signed is unknown. However, around May 1351, Magnus returned to Sweden. It's likely that he wouldn't have left the Baltic unless the war was over. Thus, according to Michael Nordberg, a likely time when peace or a truce was signed is around April or May 1351. However, no treaty has been preserved. Because of the lack of a preserved treaty, Nordberg makes the conclusion that neither side won, shared by M.G. Schybergson. However, other historians disagree, claiming a Novgorodian victory.\nSee also\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
