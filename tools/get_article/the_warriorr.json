Lingusamy and produced by Srinivasa Chitturi under Srinivasa Silver Screen. The film was shot simultaneously in Telugu and Tamil languages. It  stars Ram Pothineni and Krithi Shetty (both in their Tamil debut), with Aadhi Pinisetty, Nadhiya and Akshara Gowda. The music was composed by Devi Sri Prasad, while the cinematography and editing were handled by Sujith Vaassudev and Naveen Nooli.\nLinguswamy began contemplating a Telugu–Tamil bilingual film in 2016, which would make his directorial debut in Telugu cinema. The film was announced in February 2021 with Ram Pothineni as the lead. Principal photography begun in July 2021 and concluded in May 2022 with filming taking place primarily in Hyderabad and Chennai.\nThe Warriorr was released on 14 July 2022 to negative reviews from critics and became a box-office bomb.\nPlot\nSatya, an MBBS graduate, relocates to Kurnool with his mother and sister Nithya after receiving a job as a doctor in a government hospital. Satya also learns about Gururaj \"Guru\", a ruthless gangster, whose company has been manufacturing poisonous saline and is involved in the medical mafia. This results in the deaths of three children in the hospital, but the police do not pay heed as they are afraid of Guru's atrocities. Satya lodges a complaint against Guru with sufficient evidence against him. Guru learns about this and thrashes Satya at the Konda Reddy Fort and hangs him, but Satya is saved by his hospital dean Dr. Robert, where he leaves the city with his mother and Nithya.\nTwo years later, Satya returns back to Kurnool as the DSP of the city, where he wages a war against Guru and his men. Satya learns that Robert died in an accident, where he suspects that Guru was involved in his death. Satya receives permission for a re-autopsy of Robert's body, where he digs out his grave to recover the body but finds another body inside the grave. Guru reveals to Satya that he killed Robert when the latter helped Satya escape from the city earlier. Guru also reveals that he killed Rahim for protecting the evidence against him. The next day, Guru contests in the elections, but Satya arrests him after finding a flash drive which contains information about Guru's illegal activities.\nGuru's wife Swarna plots to kill Satya by stringing his neck, but Satya's RJ girlfriend \"Whistle\" Mahalakshmi instead gets stuck on the string and receives a major cut on her throat as she was following Satya. Satya admits her to the hospital and learns that Guru has been released from prison. After being encouraged by his mother, Satya calls Guru to the Konda Reddy Fort for a final showdown. Satya brutally kills Guru in a hand-to-hand combat and hangs him in the same manner that Guru hanged him before. After Guru's death, Satya relocates to North India with Mahalakshmi, who survived the injury, and his mother. Satya also continues to work both as a cop and a doctor.\nCast\nProduction\nDevelopment\nIn 2016, Tamil film director Lingusamy announced that he planned to make a bilingual film in Telugu and Tamil, marking his Telugu debut. He first approached Allu Arjun to star in the film, but the film was delayed due to Allu Arjun's busy schedule. In 2019, Havish was cast as the lead, but the film never began production. On 18 February 2021, it was announced that Ram Pothineni was brought on board the film, which was tentatively called RAPO19 with Srinivasa Chitturi producing the film under his banner Srinivasa Silver Screen. The film marks the Tamil debut of Pothineni after Yen Endral Kadhal Enben!, the Tamil version of Endukante... Premanta! (2012), failed to have a theatrical release. In January 2022, the film's title was announced as The Warriorr.\nCasting\nIn March 2021, it was announced that Krithi Shetty was cast aside Pothineni as the female lead. In July 2021, the makers announced that Aadhi Pinisetty was cast as the main antagonist in the film. In August 2021, it was announced that Akshara Gowda was signed on to play a pivotal role in the film.\nFilming\nSince the film was a Telugu—Tamil bilingual, scenes involving Ram Pothineni and Aadhi Pinisetty were shot in both Telugu and Tamil.
