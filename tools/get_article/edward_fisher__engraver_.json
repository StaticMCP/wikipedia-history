He was originally a hatter, but then  took up engraving and  went to London. He became a member of the Incorporated Society of Artists in 1766, and exhibited there\nfourteen times between 1761 and 1776. His earliest dated print is 1758,  and his latest 1781. He was living in Leicester Square in 1761, and moved to Ludgate Street in 1778. It is said that Joshua Reynolds called him \"injudiciously exact\"  for finishing  the unimportant parts of his plate too highly.\nHe engraved more than sixty  portraits, including George, earl of Albemarle, after Reynolds : Robert Brown, after Mason Chamberlin; William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, after Richard Brompton;\nColley Cibber, after Jean-Baptiste van Loo; Christian VII of Denmark, after Nathaniel Dance; David Garrick, after Reynolds; Simon,\nearl Harcourt, after Hunter; Roger Long, after Benjamin Wilson; Hugh, Earl of Northumberland, and Elizabeth, countess of Northumberland, after Reynolds; Paul Sandby, after Francis Cotes; Laurence Sterne, after Reynolds; and the following fancy subjects: Lady in Flowered Dress, after Hoare; Hope Nursing Love after Reynolds; his Heads from \"Vicar of Wakefield, ten plates engraved from his own designs, were published in 1776.\nAfter his death, in about 1785, most of his copper plates were dispersed among several print-sellers, and in some cases altered.\nFile:George III, King of England (3-4 length), ca. 1778 - NARA - 532904.tif|George III after Benjamin West\nFile:1st Duke of Northumberland.jpg|1st Duke of Northumberland after Joshua Reynolds\nReferences\nSources\nExternal links"
