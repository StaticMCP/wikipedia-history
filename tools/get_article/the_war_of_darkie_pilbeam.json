It was written by Coronation Street creator Tony Warren and produced by Richard Everitt for Granada Television. The programme was broadcast on Friday nights.\nThe title character, Darkie Pilbeam, (Trevor Bannister), a none too successful petty crook, managed to rise to the top of his profession by running a profitable black-market operation.
