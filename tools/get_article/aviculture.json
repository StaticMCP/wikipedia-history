Aviculture encourages conservation, provides education about avian species, provides companion birds for the public, and includes research on avian behaviour. Popular birds people like to keep and breed include budgerigars, cockatiels, finches, macaws, domestic canaries, columbidae (pigeons and doves), loriini (lories and lorikeets), cockatoos, conures, and African grey parrots.\nAvicultural societies\nIn the UK, the Avicultural Society was formed in 1894 and the Foreign Bird League in 1932. In 1973 Aviornis was created, a bird-breeding association present in several European countries.\nThe oldest avicultural society in the United States is the Avicultural Society of America, founded in 1927. The ASA produces a bi-monthly magazine, ASA Avicultural Bulletin. The ASA is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that focuses on breeding, conservation, restoration and education.\nThe first avicultural society in Australia was The Avicultural Society of South Australia, founded in 1928. It is now promoted with the name Bird Keeping in Australia. The two major national avicultural societies in the United States are the American Federation of Aviculture and the Avicultural Society of America, founded in 1927. The Budgerigar Society was formed in 1925.\nThe Avicultural Society of South Australia (founded in 1928) produces a monthly full-colour magazine, Bird Keeping in Australia.\nSee also\n*American Federation of Aviculture\n*Companion parrot\nReferences"
