He argued that the structure of song was fundamentally good and that was evidenced by the various cover versions and changes others had made to it and it still held up. He qualified that it may not be a well recorded song as it had been recorded on tape, he accepted the muffled quality of the audio, saying they had wanted to capture the happenstance incidental quality of the band. Ebert also noted that the song came before the folk pop sound was more widely popularized by other bands such as The Lumineers or Of Monsters and Men.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boNxJ-zfkgI The Story Behind \"Home\" and \"Truth,\" Edward Sharpe's Companion Songs of Darkness and Light] Consequence podcast via YouTube"
