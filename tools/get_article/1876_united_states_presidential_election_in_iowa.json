Voters chose 11 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nIowa was won by Rutherford B. Hayes, the governor of Ohio (R-Ohio), running with Representative William A. Wheeler, with 58.50% of the vote, against Samuel J. Tilden, the former governor of New York (D–New York), running with Thomas A. Hendricks, the governor of Indiana and future vice president, with 38.28% of the popular vote.\nThe Greenback Party chose industrialist Peter Cooper and former representative Samuel Fenton Cary, received 3.22% of the vote. Iowa gave the Greenbacks both their largest number of total votes and percentage and Iowa would later be the last bastion of the congressional Greenbacks who held a House seat until 1889.\nResults\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Iowa\nReferences"
