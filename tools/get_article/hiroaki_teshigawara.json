He has held the WBC-OPBF super-bantamweight title since 2018 and previously the WBO Asia Pacific bantamweight title from 2017 to 2018. As of August 2020, he is ranked as the world's fourth best active super-bantamweight by BoxRec and seventh by The Ring.\nProfessional career\nTeshigawara made his professional debut on 28 July 2011, scoring a third-round technical knockout (TKO) victory over Naoto Tabata at the Korakuen Hall in Tokyo, Japan.\nAfter compiling a record of 14–2–2 (8 KOs) he challenged WBO Asia Pacific bantamweight champion Jetro Pabustan on 12 October 2017 at the Korakuen Hall. Teshigawara scored a knockdown in the ninth round. In the tenth, after Pabustan received a point deduction for excessive holding, the referee called a halt to the contest to save Pabustan from further punishment, awarding Teshigawara his first professional title via tenth-round TKO. At the time of the stoppage Teshigawara was ahead on all three judges' scorecards with 89–81, 88–82, and 87–83.\nHe began 2018 with two successful defences of his WBO regional title – a unanimous decision (UD) against Jason Canoy in February and a fifth-round knockout (KO) against Teiru Kinoshita in June – before moving up in weight to face Glenn Suminguit for the vacant WBC-OPBF super-bantamweight title on 11 October at the Korakuen Hall. Teshigawara captured his second professional title, defeating Suminguit via fifth-round KO.\nHe made three successful defences of his WBC regional title in 2019, scoring stoppage wins against Yuki Iriguchi in February; Shohei Omori in August; and Shohei Kawashima in December.\nProfessional boxing record\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!\n!Result\n!Record\n!Opponent\n!Type\n!Round, time\n!Date\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n|27\n|Loss\n|\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Marlon Tapales\n|TKO\n|2 (12)\n|Dec 11, 2021\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|26\n|Win\n|22–2–2\n|align=left|Shingo Kawamura\n|TKO\n|12\n|12 Dec 2019\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|25\n|Win\n|21–2–2\n|align=left|Shohei Kawashima\n|KO\n|5 (12),\n|12 Dec 2019\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|24\n|Win\n|20–2–2\n|align=left|Shohei Omori\n|TKO\n|12 (12),\n|8 Aug 2019\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|23\n|Win\n|19–2–2\n|align=left|Yuki Iriguchi\n|TKO\n|8 (12),\n|14 Feb 2019\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|22\n|Win\n|18–2–2\n|align=left|Glenn Suminguit\n|KO\n|5 (12),\n|11 Oct 2018\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|21\n|Win\n|17–2–2\n|align=left|Teiru Kinoshita\n|\n|5 (12),\n|14 Jun 2018\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|20\n|Win\n|16–2–2\n|align=left|Jason Canoy\n|UD\n|12\n|8 Feb 2018\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|19\n|Win\n|15–2–2\n|align=left|Jetro Pabustan\n|TKO\n|10 (12),\n|12 Oct 2017\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|18\n|Win\n|14–2–2\n|align=left|Keita Kurihara\n|TKO\n|5 (8),\n|19 Jun 2017\n|align=left|\n|\n|-\n|17\n|Win\n|13–2–2\n|align=left|Junny Salogaol\n|TKO\n|2 (8),\n|10 Apr 2017\n|align=left|\n|\n|-\n|16\n|Loss\n|12–2–2\n|align=left|Ryo Akaho\n|\n|10\n|11 Oct 2016\n|align=left|\n|\n|-\n|15\n|Win\n|12–1–2\n|align=left|Yoshihiro Utsumi\n|UD\n|8\n|28 Jul 2016\n|align=left|\n|\n|-\n|14\n|Win\n|11–1–2\n|align=left|Kenichi Watanabe\n|TKO\n|1 (8),\n|18 Mar 2016\n|align=left|\n|\n|-\n|13\n|Win\n|10–1–2\n|align=left|Shuji Hamada\n|TKO\n|7 (8),\n|14 Dec 2015\n|align=left|\n|\n|-\n|12\n|Draw\n|9–1–2\n|align=left|Hideo Sakamoto\n|MD\n|8\n|17 Jul 2015\n|align=left|\n|\n|-\n|11\n|Win\n|9–1–1\n|align=left|Gaku Aikawa\n|UD\n|8\n|8 Dec 2014\n|align=left|\n|\n|-\n|10\n|Win\n|8–1–1\n|align=left|Kota Sato\n|UD\n|6\n|1 Nov 2013\n|align=left|\n|\n|-\n|9\n|Win\n|7–1–1\n|align=left|Kyosuke Sawada\n|TKO\n|4 (6),\n|12 Aug 2013\n|align=left|\n|\n|-\n|8\n|Win\n|6–1–1\n|align=left|Ryosuke Ono\n|UD\n|6\n|27 Mar 2013\n|align=left|\n|\n|-\n|7\n|Loss\n|5–1–1\n|align=left|Yusuke Tachikawa\n|UD\n|5\n|4 Nov 2012\n|align=left|\n|\n|-\n|6\n|Win\n|5–0–1\n|align=left|Corrales Kawashimo\n|\n|4\n|27 Sep 2012\n|align=left|\n|\n|-\n|5\n|Win\n|4–0–1\n|align=left|Ryo Nakamura\n|TKO\n|3 (4),\n|7 Aug 2012\n|align=left|\n|\n|-\n|4\n|Draw\n|3–0–1\n|align=left|Yoshito Ikari\n|MD\n|4\n|29 Jun 2012\n|align=left|\n|\n|-\n|3\n|Win\n|3–0\n|align=left|Yuto Sasamori\n|\n|4\n|17 Apr 2012\n|align=left|\n|\n|-\n|2\n|Win\n|2–0\n|align=left|Shogo Sumitomo\n|TKO\n|2 (4),\n|25 Nov 2011\n|align=left|\n|\n|-\n|1\n|Win\n|1–0\n|align=left|Naoto Tabata\n|\n|3 (4),\n|28 Jul 2011\n|align=left|\n|\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\nbantamweight champion\n|years=12 October 2017 – September 2018Vacated}}\nchampion\n|years=11 October 2018 – present}}"
