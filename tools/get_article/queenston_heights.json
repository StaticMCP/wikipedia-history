Its geography is a promontory formed where the escarpment is divided by the Niagara River. The promontory forms a cliff face of approximately 100 m (approximately 300&nbsp;ft).\nWar of 1812\nQueenston Heights was the site of the War of 1812 Battle of Queenston Heights, where Major-General Sir Isaac Brock was killed in action in the defence of Upper Canada (now Ontario).  It is mentioned in the 1867 song \"The Maple Leaf Forever\":\nAt Queenston Heights and Lundy's Lane\nOur brave fathers, side by side,\nFor freedom, homes, and loved ones dear,\nFirmly stood and nobly died.\nAnd those dear rights which they maintained,\nWe swear to yield them never.\nOur watchword evermore shall be,\nThe Maple Leaf forever!\nWar memorials\nQueenston Heights is the site of Brock's Monument and a monument to War of 1812 heroine Laura Secord. There are 235 stairs inside the monument, leading to a viewing area close to the top. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1968. Fort Drummond, also located at Queenston Heights, is separately recognized as a National Historic Site.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/lhn-nhs/on/queenston Official website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110723071801/http://www.nflibrary.ca/nfplindex/results.asp?action=browse&q=79&key=258 Art works of the Battle of Queenston Heights] Niagara Falls Public Library (Ont.)"
