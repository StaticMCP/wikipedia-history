It is a light industrial area and is no longer residential.\nWarrenby is on the edge of Coatham Marsh, and was originally called Warrenstown.  It was founded in 1873, to provide housing for workers at the nearby ironworks of Downey & Co and Walker Maynard.\nIn the Warrenby Disaster of 1895, eleven men, many from the village of Warrenby, were killed in a boiler explosion at the works.\nrailway station was opened in 1920 as a halt on the Middlesbrough & Redcar Railway. This was to serve the nearby Dorman Long steelworks. In 1978, the railway was realigned to make way for the expansion of Redcar steel plant, and so the halt was demolished.\nReferences\nExternal links"
