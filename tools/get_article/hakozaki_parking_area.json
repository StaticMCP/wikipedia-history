This is because the parking lot is extremely small, and guide signs would lead to increase in the number of travelers who stop there, and the parking lot would easily become congested (as it is written on the bulletin board in the parking area).  Because of this, many people do not know that the Hakozaki Parking Area exists, and it is also called \"Phantom Parking Area\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.shutoko-sv.jp/parking_area/pa/?id=1427364204-195325 Hakozaki PA] - Hakozaki PA-Metropolitan Expressway Service"
