She was also queen of the United Kingdom and other sovereign states. Her constitutional roles in Ghana were delegated to the governor-general of Ghana.\nHistory\nand his wife, 1953]]\nGhana was the first western African country to achieve independence from European colonization. British rule ended in 1957, when the Ghana Independence Act 1957 transformed the British Crown Colony of the Gold Coast into the independent sovereign state of Ghana, with Queen Elizabeth II as head of state on 6 March 1957. Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent represented the Queen at the independence celebrations. On 6 March, the Duchess formally opened the first parliament of independent Ghana, on behalf of the Queen, by giving the Speech from the Throne. The Duchess read the Queen's personal message to the people of Ghana, which said:\nConstitutional role\nGhana was one of the realms of the Commonwealth of Nations that shared the same person as Sovereign and head of state.\nEffective with the Ghana Independence Act 1957, no British government minister could advise the sovereign on any matters pertaining to Ghana, meaning that on all matters of the Ghana, the monarch was advised solely by Ghanaian ministers of the Crown. The Queen was represented in Ghana by the Governor-General of Ghana, who was appointed by the monarch on the advice of the Ghanaian government. Two governors-general held office: Charles Noble Arden-Clarke (1957), and William Francis Hare, 5th Earl of Listowel (1957–1960).\nThe Crown and Government\n]]\nThe Queen and the National Assembly of Ghana constituted the Parliament of Ghana. All executive powers of Ghana rested with the sovereign. All laws in Ghana were enacted only with the granting of royal assent, done by the Governor-General on behalf of the sovereign. Every Ghanaian Bill presented to the Governor-General, had the following words of enactment:\nThe Governor-General was also responsible for summoning, proroguing, and dissolving Parliament. All Ghanaian ministers of the Crown held office at the pleasure of the Governor-General.\nThe Crown and Honours\nWithin the Commonwealth realms, the monarch is the \"fount of honour\". Similarly, the monarch, as Sovereign of Ghana, conferred awards and honours in Ghana her name. Most of them were awarded on the advice of \"Her Majesty's Ghana Ministers\".\n;See also:\nTitle\nThe Royal Style and Titles Act, 1957 of the Parliament of Ghana granted the monarch a separate Ghanaian title in her role as Queen of Ghana.\nQueen Elizabeth II had the following styles in her role as the monarch of Ghana:\n*6 March 1957 – 27 July 1957: Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith\n*27 July 1957 – 1 July 1960: Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Ghana and of Her other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth\nOath of allegiance\nThe oath of allegiance in Ghana was:\nAbolition\nAfter the 1960 Ghanaian constitutional referendum, Ghana adopted a new constitution that replaced the monarch and governor-general with a president. Ghana became a republic within the Commonwealth. The Queen sent a message to Ghanaians which said: \"From midnight I shall cease to be your Queen. ... I am proud that I am Head of a Commonwealth in which every nation may choose for itself the form of Government which best suits it; now that Ghana has chosen for itself a republican form of constitution, it will not affect the interest which I have always taken and shall continue to take in the welfare of its people\".\nRoyal visits\nThe Queen said in her Christmas broadcast in 1958, that she and her husband would be visiting Ghana in late 1959. To celebrate the upcoming visit, the Ghanaian Government commissioned a new £2 coin with a new effigy of the Queen and the inscription \"Queen of Ghana\". However, the coin was never struck since the visit was postponed, as she had become pregnant in 1959.\nIn November 1959, Prince Philip paid a six-day visit to Ghana. During the visit, he inaugurated the Ghana Academy of Learning (now the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences), and was appointed its first president. He also met members of the Accra Market Women Traders' Association at the Governor-General's Lodge in Accra, who presented him with a gold tie-pin.\nQueen Elizabeth II visited the Republic of Ghana from 9 to 20 November 1961 and from 7 to 9 November 1999.\nDuring her 1961 tour, the Queen famously danced with Ghana's president Kwame Nkrumah at a farewell ball in Accra, which many scholars believe was a symbolic moment in the history of the Commonwealth. Despite bombings in the capital and fears that Ghana was getting too close to the Soviet Union, the Queen insisted on this tour to make sure that Ghana did not leave the Commonwealth. A dramatised version of this visit was portrayed in the episode \"Dear Mrs Kennedy\" in the second season of the Netflix series The Crown.\nGallery\nFile:Ghana Stamp 2.jpg\nFile:Ghana Stamp 3.jpg\nFile:Ghana Stamp 4.jpg\nFile:Ghana Stamp 1.jpg\nFile:Ghana Stamp 5.jpg\nFile:Ghana Stamp 6.jpg\nSee also\n*Ghanaian constitutional referendum, 1960\n*Ghana Empire\nReferences"
