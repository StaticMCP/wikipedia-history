Voters chose eight representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nEarly elections were quite different from modern ones. Voters voted for individual electors, who were pledged to vote for certain candidates. Often, which candidate an elector intended to support was unclear. Prior to the ratification of the 12th amendment, each elector did not distinguish between a vote cast for president and vice president, and simply cast two votes.\nVery little is known about this election. In his book, Presidential Elections in Maryland, former Maryland Secretary of State John T. Willis writes that voters used the general ticket method and that all of the 898 votes cast were for Washington electors.\nResults\nThe results from Worcester County are unknown, but it can be assumed Washington received 100% of the vote, as he was the only candidate.\nResults by county\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+1792 United States presidential election in Maryland\n! rowspan=\"2\" |County\n! colspan=\"2\" |George Washington\nIndependent\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Total votes cast\n|-\n!  | #\n!  | %\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|colspan=\"1\"  | Allegany\n| | 38\n| | 100.00%\n| | 38\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|colspan=\"1\"  | Anne Arundel\n| | 36\n| | 100.00%\n| | 36\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|colspan=\"1\"  | Baltimore (City and County)\n| | 187\n| | 100.00%\n| | 187\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|colspan=\"1\"  | Calvert\n| | 11\n| | 100.00%\n| | 11\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|colspan=\"1\"  | Caroline\n| | 26\n| | 100.00%\n| | 26\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|colspan=\"1\"  | Cecil\n| | 128\n| | 100.00%\n| | 128\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|colspan=\"1\"  | Charles\n| | 66\n| | 100.00%\n| | 66\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|colspan=\"1\"  | Dorchester\n| | 15\n| | 100.00%\n| | 15\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|colspan=\"1\"  | Frederick\n| | 45\n| | 100.00%\n| | 45\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|colspan=\"1\"  | Harford\n| | 50\n| | 100.00%\n| | 50\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|colspan=\"1\"  | Kent\n| | 54\n| | 100.00%\n| | 54\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|colspan=\"1\"  | Montgomery\n| | 28\n| | 100.00%\n| | 28\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|colspan=\"1\"  | Prince George's\n| | 14\n| | 100.00%\n| | 14\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|colspan=\"1\"  | Queen Anne's\n| | 35\n| | 100.00%\n| | 35\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|colspan=\"1\"  | St. Mary's\n| | 13\n| | 100.00%\n| | 13\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|colspan=\"1\"  | Somerset\n| | 51\n| | 100.00%\n| | 51\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|colspan=\"1\"  | Talbot\n| | 68\n| | 100.00%\n| | 68\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|colspan=\"1\"  | Washington\n| | 33\n| | 100.00%\n| | 33\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Total\n!898\n!100.00%\n!898\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Maryland\n* 1792 United States presidential election\n* 1792 United States elections\nReferences"
