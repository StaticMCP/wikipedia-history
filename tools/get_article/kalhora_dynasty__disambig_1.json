The dynasty governed much of Sindh, South Punjab and parts of Kutch (present-day Gujarat, India) between 1701 and 1783 from their capital of Khudabad, before shifting to Hyderabad from 1768 onwards. They were assigned to hold authority by the Mughal Grand Vizier Mirza Ghazi Beg.\nHistory\nKalhora governance of Sindh began around the start of the 18th century when Yar Muhammad Kalhoro was invested with title of Khuda Yar Khan and was made Subahdar of Upper Sindh by royal decree of the Mughals. Later, after his death, his son was additionally appointed Subahdar of Sehwan and thus oversaw most of Sindh.\nThe Kalhora dynasty succumbed during the invasion of Nader Shah. Sind was then conquered by Ahmad Shah Durrani in 1748–1750 making the Sind State a vassal under the suzerainty of the Durrani Empire.\nThe Kalhora nawabs also took part in the historic Third Battle of Panipat as part of the victorious Islamic coalition. Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro brought stability to Sindh as he restructured the state. Ghulam Shah's successors couldn't control Sindh for long and were overthrown by Talpurs mirs in the Battle of Halani. Abdul Nabi Kalhoro was the last Kalhora ruler.\nAccording to Ḳāniʿ, who visited their court, the Kalhora spoke Sindhi in court.\nRulers\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
