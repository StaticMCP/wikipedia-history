It is indirectly one of the founding factions of the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO), founded in 1905.\nThe PSR was the new name given, in 1898, to the Central Revolutionary Committee (CRC), a blanquist party founded in 1881. The CRC had been strengthened by the formation of the Revolutionary Communist Alliance (ACR) by dissident members of the reformist Revolutionary Socialist Workers' Party (POSR). Due to the support of the ACR, the PSR became the second largest Marxist political party in France behind the French Workers' Party.\nThe PSR was led by Édouard Vaillant, who sought to be the middle ground between moderate socialists (Jean Jaurès, Paul Brousse) and Marxists (Jules Guesde, Paul Lafargue). The PSR, however, later merged with the French Workers' Party (POF) to form the Socialist Party of France (PSdF). The PSdF was one of the two founding members of the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) in 1905.\nNotable members\n*Madame Sorgue\n*Édouard Vaillant\nSee also\n*History of the Left in France\n*French Section of the Workers' International\n*Socialist Party of France\n*French Workers' Party"
