It should not be considered complete; up-to-date; nor fully accurate, being based on open-source press reporting.\nAn updated order of battle estimate for 23 April 2023, by the Institute for the Study of War is accessible at:\n* [https://understandingwar.org/research/russia-ukraine/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment_23-18/ Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, 23 April]\nAnother ISW-relevant publication, published in October 2023:\n* [https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/October20122C20202320Russian20Orbat_Final.pdf Russian Regular Ground Forces Order of Battle: Russian Military 101]\nRussian forces in 2022\nAdministrative chain of command\nCommanders of the various MOD armed services and branches do not have operational control over the forces. They are responsible for force development and generation. The Chiefs of the ground forces, aerospace forces, navy, strategic missile forces, and airborne forces also hold the appointments of Deputy Ministers of Defence, junior to the Chief of the General Staff, who is the First Deputy Minister of Defence.\nThe General Staff commands and controls forces through the National Defence Management Centre (NDMC). Operational control of the forces was carried out by the five Operational-Strategic Commands—the Western, Southern, Central, and Eastern Military Districts and the OSK Northern Fleet, which is their equal. The Western and Southern Military Districts share borders with Ukraine and are directly involved in command and control of operations.\nPre-2022 Russian military doctrine had specified that on the outbreak of war, armed forces from non-MOD services (like Rosgvardiya) would be placed under the General Staff.\n* (President of the Russian Federation: Supreme Commander-in-Chief Vladimir Putin)\n** Security Council\n*** Rosgvardiya (General of the Army Viktor Zolotov;

Russian forces were forced to withdraw from their attempt to take Kyiv. Therefore, a single senior coordinating officer was appointed to handle the more protracted war.\n* Army General Aleksandr Dvornikov (8 April 2022 – 25 June 2022): placed in overall charge of military operations in Ukraine, effectively ending the grouping system;\n* Colonel General Gennady Zhidko (26 June 2022 – 7 October 2022): appointed by Vladimir Putin to the top position, replacing Dvornikov;\n* Army General Sergey Surovikin (8 October 2022 – 11 January 2023): previously commander of the Aerospace Forces and Army Group South, replacing Zhidko in overall command.\nRussian forces\nSince 12 January 2023, Chief of the General Staff Army General Valery Gerasimov was appointed as commander of military operations in Ukraine, with Surovikin as his deputy.\nThe actual operational chain of command of the Russian military effort in Ukraine is not public, changes, and is a mix of state and non-state bodies. Personal rivalries are evident. President Vladimir Putin, however, remains firmly in control, sometimes micromanaging. The loose connection of various mercenary bodies and Ramzan Kadyrov's Chechens to the official command chain has been represented by placing them under headers separate to the Russian Armed Forces.\nIt is unclear how tactical fighter, ground attack, and strategic bomber \"sorties\" (one flight of one aircraft) are scheduled and controlled.\nOn 18 April 2023, Russian official sources said that President Putin had held meetings in the Kherson area with several commanders. The President \"..received reports from the commander of the Dnepr forces grouping, General Lieutenant Oleg Makarevich, the commander of the Vostok [Eastern] forces grouping,  General Lieutenant Andrey Kuzmenko, and the deputy commander of the combined grouping, General Colonel Mikhail Teplinsky.\" The meetings likely took place before 16 April.\nDirect Forces under President\n*  (President of the Russian Federation: Supreme Commander-in-Chief Vladimir Putin)\n**  Security Council\n***  Russian General Staff (Chief of the General Staff: General of the Army Valery Gerasimov, First Deputy Chief of the General Staff Nikolay Bogdanovsky)\n****  National Defense Management Center (Colonel General Mikhail Mizintsev)\n**** Long Range Aviation - administratively Aerospace Forces; operationally, air operations centre of whatever description\n*****  22nd Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Division (Colonel Mykola Varpahovych)\n****** 52nd Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment (Tupolev Tu-22M) (Colonel Oleg Timoshyn)\nMercenaries and Foreign Fighters\n* Wagner Group (Commander: Lieutenant Colonel Dmitry Utkin )\n**  DShRG Rusich (Commander: Alexey Milchakov)\n* Gazprom Neft Security\n** Fakel\n** Plamya\n*  Africa Corps (\"Russian Expeditionary Corps\")\n* Patriot\n* Redut (\"1st Expeditionary Volunteer Assault Corps\") (GRU)\n* Redut\n**  Union of Cossack Warriors of Russia and Abroad\n*** Don Brigade\n**** Listan Battalion\n*** Terek Brigade\n**** Skif Battalion\n**  16th Special Forces Brigade of the GRU\n*** Volki (\"Wolves\") Brigade\n*** Tigry (\"Tigers\") Formation\n*** Veter 177 Formation\n*** Nevsky Formation\n**  Union of Donbass Volunteers\n*** Sever (\"North\") Formation\n*** Tsentr (\"Center\") Formation\n*** St. George's Brigade\n**** Zubr (\"Bison\") Formation\n**** Kherson Formation\n**** Artdivision Formation\n**** Vikhr (\"Whirlwind\") Formation\n** Veterans of Russia Movement\n***\n** Gazprom Neft Security\n*** Potok (\"Flow\") Formation\n** Others\n*** 81st Special Forces Brigade (\"bears\")\n*** Lev (\"Lion\") Formation\n*** Rysi (\"Lynx\") Formation\n*** Borz Formation\n***  Espanola Formation\n*** Troya (\"Troy\") Formation\n*** Irbis (\"Snow Leopard\") Formation\n*** Imperial Legion Formation\n*** Rusich Formation\n* Tsar's Wolves\n* Uran\n* Korean People's Army (Supreme Leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea: Supreme Commander Kim Jong Un)\n**  Korean People's Army Ground Force (Commander: Vice Marshal Ri Yong-gil)\n*** XI Corps\n*** 94th Separate Brigade\n**  Storm Corps (Commander: Colonel General Kim Yong Bok)\n*** 92nd Special Operations Brigade\n*** 94th Special Operations Brigade\nMilitias\n*  Storm Ossetia (Commander: Ayvengo Tekhov )\n* Alania Battalion\n* Vladlen Tatarsky Battalion\nReserve units of the Russian Armed Forces\n* BARS\nChechens\n* Kadyrovites (Head: Colonel General Ramzan Kadyrov)\n**  141st Special Motorized Regiment (Lieutenant Colonel Magomed Tushayev)\n*** North Battalion\n**\n**  subordinate to the 42nd Motorised Rifle Division, 58th Combined Arms Army\nSpetsnaz units\nClear evidence as to which Grouping of Forces these brigades belong to is not readily available.\n*  2nd Guards Spetsnaz Brigade (Colonel Konstantin Bushuev)\n*  3rd Guards Spetsnaz Brigade\n*  10th Spetsnaz Brigade\n*  14th Guards Spetsnaz Brigade (Colonel Sergey Polyakov ) (formerly Lieutenant Colonel Albert Karimov )\n*  16th Guards Spetsnaz Brigade (Deputy Commander Major Dmitri Vladimirovich Semenov )\n*  24th Guards Spetsnaz Brigade\n* 346th Spetsnaz Brigade of the Russian Special Operations Forces\nUnits returned to Russia:\n*  22nd Guards Spetsnaz Brigade returned to Russia to reconstitute in 2022 following major losses.
