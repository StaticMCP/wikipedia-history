The middle tier features relief busts of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln and Massachusetts Governor John A. Andrew, a battle scene of a dying soldier supported by a comrade, and the monument's dedication plaque. The bottom tier features four inscription plaques listing the names of the 398 Worcester soldiers who died in the war.\nIn 1871, the Soldiers' Monument Committee commissioned Rogers to design the memorial. The City of Worcester appropriated $35,000, and an addition $15,000 was raised by subscription. The monument was dedicated on July 15, 1874.\nWhen built, the monument was approximately  tall, and the base was approximately  square. The ground level was raised in 1969, burying the rough-granite base, so the monument is now approximately  shorter.\nDedication Plaque:\nFile:CivilWarMemorialWorcester.JPG|Soldiers' Monument in 2009.\nFile:Soldiers Monument - Worcester, MA - DSC05756.JPG|Goddess of Victory.\nFile:Soldiers Monument - Worcester, MA - DSC05761.JPG|Infantry.\nFile:Soldiers Monument - Worcester, MA - DSC05758.JPG|Navy.\nFile:Soldiers Monument - Worcester, MA - DSC05760.JPG|Cavalry.\nFile:Soldiers Monument - Worcester, MA - DSC05759.JPG|Artillery.\nFile:Soldiers Monument - Worcester, MA - DSC05753.JPG|Dedication plaque.\nExternal links\n*[https://macivilwarmonuments.com/2019/02/18/worcester/ Worcester Civil War Monument] on \"Massachusetts Civil War Monuments Project\"\n*[http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=132760KW61972.1868&menu=search&aspect=Keyword&npp=50&ipp=20&spp=20&profile=ariall&ri=&term=worcester&index=.GW&aspect=Keyword&term=randolph+rogers+&index=.AW&term=&index=.TW&term=&index=.SW&term=&index=.FW&term=&index=.OW&term=&index=.NW&x=15&y=12#focus Soldiers' Monument] from Smithsonian Institution Research Information System.\n*[https://books.google.com/books/about/Dedication_of_the_soldiers_monument_at_W.html?id=MdvSQ6PiJKUC Dedication of the Soldiers' Monument at Worcester, Massachusetts: July 15, A.D. 1874.] from Google."
