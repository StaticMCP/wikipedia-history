It involved the 1st East African Division and took place on 13 March 1917. Several British units were ordered to attack German forces that had been spotted near Nambanje. The British advance was detected by the Germans the day before, which enabled them to prepare and repulse the attack.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080723133839/http://www.warpath.orbat.com/e_african_divs/1_e_african_div.htm 1st East African Division] (archived version)"
