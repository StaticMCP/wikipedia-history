On August 6, 2024, she chose Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota as her candidate for vice president.\nAfter formally accepting their nomination during the 2024 Democratic National Convention, Harris and Walz went on to lose the general election to the Republican ticket of former president Donald Trump and U.S. senator JD Vance, and Walz returned to the governorship following the campaign.\nBackground\nDuring Joe Biden's re-election campaign, Kamala Harris was presumed the Democratic Party nominee for a second term as Vice President of the United States. Biden competed in the Democratic presidential primaries facing candidates such as Minnesota US representative Dean Phillips, and businessman Jason Palmer. Biden became the presumptive nominee on March 12. However, amidst concerns about his age and ability to serve as president, Biden withdrew from the election on July 21, 2024 and endorsed Harris to replace him as the presidential nominee.\nAlso on July21, Harris announced her intention to run for the Democratic nomination, and the \"Biden for President\" campaign committee filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to change the name of the committee to \"Harris for President\". On July22, Harris received enough state delegate endorsements to win the nomination and become the presumptive Democratic nominee.\nSelection process\nCovington & Burling, former U.S. attorney general Eric Holder's law firm and Dana Remus, former White House counsel to President Biden conducted the Harris campaign's running mate vetting process.\nFormer Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs Elizabeth M. Allen led the campaign's vetting team alongside former Congressman Cedric Richmond, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (U.S. senator), and former secretary of labor and mayor of Boston Marty Walsh.\nAn official reported to ABC News on July23 that Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Shapiro were the leading candidates to be selected as Harris's running mate. Another source told Talking Points Memo the following day that North Carolina governor Roy Cooper was an additional top choice. On July23, the Financial Times reported that donors preferred Cooper or Shapiro and \"Hollywood Democrats\" backed Kelly. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz was also a serious candidate, as were Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\nOn July 29, The New York Times reported Cooper had voluntarily withdrawn his name from consideration.\nOn July 30, The Hill reported that several progressive leaders and political groups urged Harris to pick Beshear or Walz instead of Shapiro in an effort to consolidate key voting groups and the Democratic base.\nOn August 1, NBC News and The New York Times reported that Harris's final shortlist included Andy Beshear, Pete Buttigieg, Mark Kelly, J. B. Pritzker, Josh Shapiro, and Tim Walz. The New York Times reported that day that the vice presidential vetting process had been completed. On August 4, Harris interviewed Shapiro, Kelly, and Walz in person at the Number One Observatory Circle. Following this, on August 5, it was reported that Harris would choose between Walz and Shapiro. Harris did not make her decision on August 5, choosing to \"sleep on it\" and inform her running mate of her decision the following morning. On August 6, Harris chose Walz.\nOn August 7, the day after Walz had been selected, Shapiro said publicly that he would not have appreciated being on a position other than the lead on the ticket, stating, \"throughout my career, I’ve never played small ball. I’m certainly not going to start now.\"\nLater, in her book 107 Days, it was revealed that Harris originally planned on tapping Pete Buttigieg for her vice presidential pick, but felt it was too risky, as having him as her vice president would mean a black woman and a gay man would be running on the same ballot. In the same book, it says that Harris used advice from her godson, Alexander Hudlin, who favored Walz.\nShortlist\nFile:Andy Beshear 2024 (cropped).jpg|alt=Governor Andy Beshear of Kentucky (2019–present)|\nFile:Pete Buttigieg official photo (cropped).jpg|alt=Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg from Michigan (2021–2025)(did not receive vetting materials)|}} (2021–2025)}}\nFile:Mark Kelly, Official Portrait 117th (cropped).jpg|alt=Senator Mark Kelly from Arizona (2020–present)|\nFile:J.B.

In her announcement, Harris said, \"'What impressed me most about Tim is his deep commitment to his family'\". Harris added, \"'We are going to build a great partnership. We are going to build a great team. We are going to win this election'\".\nAnalysis\nThe selection was described by The New York Times as a proxy war between progressive and moderate Democrats. Progressive activists accused Shapiro and Kelly of being too conservative, specifically on labor issues, public education, and the Gaza war, therefore backing Walz. Moderates defended Shapiro, accusing progressives of antisemitism in their attacks. Both sides seemingly accepted Beshear. An opinion piece in USA Today said that not picking Shapiro would signal support for a progressive platform, and one in The Guardian said picking Shapiro would signal moderation.\nFollowing the selection, CNN reported that \"people familiar with the interview process said that Walz was also someone Harris felt could attract the kinds of voters that Democrats have lost to Donald Trump— voters that Harris may not be able to connect with on her own\". Other reports suggested that Walz's folksy, plain-spoken demeanor could help Harris win over blue-collar voters and rural voters in Midwestern swing states.\nWalz was the first sitting governor selected as the Democratic vice-presidential nominee since Charles W. Bryan of Nebraska in 1924. If elected, Walz would have been the third vice president from Minnesota after Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale. Walz also became the first sitting governor to appear on a Democratic ticket since Bill Clinton in 1992.\nLater developments\nHarris and Walz were certified as the Democratic Party's official nominees on August 6, 2024 by Democratic National Committee secretary Jason Rae.\nAfter formally accepting their nomination on the third day of the 2024 Democratic National Convention, Harris and Walz went on to lose the general election to the Republican ticket of former President Donald Trump and U.S. Senator JD Vance. The Trump/Vance ticket won the Midwestern states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\nIn her 2025 memoir 107 Days, Harris wrote that Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg had been her \"first choice\" to be her running mate. She ultimately decided not to select him, however, because of her fear of how the American electorate would respond to a ticket of a Black woman and a gay man.\nSee also\n* Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign\n* 2024 Democratic Party presidential candidates\n* 2024 Democratic National Convention\n* 2024 United States presidential election\n* List of United States major party presidential tickets\n* 2024 Republican Party vice presidential candidate selection\nNotes\nReferences"
