It was founded in 1519 by Richard FitzJames, and has been in continuous operation for over 470 years. In 1550 the school received royal foundation status during the reign of Edward VI.\nKing's School was officially founded on September 29 1519 by Richard Fitzjames, Bishop of London; Sir John Fitzjames, the Attorney General; and the Abbott of Bruton Monastery, William Gilbert.\nAfter the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the school was re-founded by a Royal Charter from King Edward VI. A board of governors was set up, the first school board in England.\nOld House was the original school building, later New House was built as an extension for school rooms and Old House was the headmaster's house. Blackford and Lyon were built and were funded by beneficiaries such as Lord Blackford and James Lyon. The school honoured the Old Brutonians who died in the Great War by laying the foundation stone for a new School Hall on Corpus Christi Day in 1919, and what became known as Memorial Hall was officially opened in 1924.\nKing's School Bruton once owned a copy of Magna Carta dating from 1297, which it sold to the Australian Government in 1952 for £12,500.\nGirls have attended the school's sixth form since the 1960s before King's became fully co-educational in the late 1990s. It has six houses: Wellesley, Priory and Arion for girls, with New, Blackford and Lyon making up the boys' houses.\nIn September 1999, the Hobhouse Science centre was opened with a fully equipped observatory. The school has a purpose-built theatre, sports hall, fitness suite, sports surfaces for rugby, netball, tennis and cricket as well as two all-weather astro-turfs for hockey.\nThe Basil Wright Building was opened in 2009 and houses the Headmaster's, Bursar's and Registrar's offices.\nOn 28 March 2019, to mark the school's quincentenary, King's hosted Queen Elizabeth II during a wider Royal visit to the West Country. During the visit the Queen opened a new music school named in her honour.\nKing's Bruton Foundation\nThe King's School, Bruton Foundation comprises three schools - King's Bruton, Hazlegrove Preparatory School and Sunny Hill Nursery.\nIn 1947, following World War II, King's Bruton Junior School moved to a site approximately 10 miles South West at Hazlegrove House to satisfy increasing demand for places. The school has since been known as 'Hazlegrove Prep School,' and acts as the preparatory and main feeder school for King's Bruton, with around a third to a half of each year group moving directly to King's at 13.\nIn March 2022, it was announced that the foundation would be acquiring the now defunct Bruton School for Girls, for an undisclosed amount. The acquisition was made in an attempt to boost links, attendance and finances at the school, thus prospering the entire foundation. Unfortunately, with an expected pupil roll of 45 in September 2022 (down on 199 in 2018), the foundation deemed it unviable to continue operations, and in May 2022 announced that the school would close at the end of the 2021/22 academic year. The Nursery, however, has remained open and remains a part of the foundation.\nThe Bruton School for Girls site is now being sold.\nHeadteacher\nFrom September 2009 the school was led by Ian Wilmshurst, whose retirement for July 2025 was announced in April 2024. In June 2024 it was announced that Matt Radley, second master of Blundell's School, would be the next headmaster of King's Bruton from September 2025.\nCombined Cadet Force\nKings runs a Combined Cadet Force contingent, it is commanded by a Major who takes the position of Contingent Commander and whose primary focus is on the Army Section. The Royal Navy Section is (as of December 2021) commanded by a (CCF) Lieutenant. The Naval Section is (as of December 2021) composed of four Non-Commissioned Officers, two Officers awaiting training and one Sub Lieutenant; the Navy is the smaller section of the two. The Army section comprises NCOs drawn from the Lower and Upper Sixth Form and around 11 Commissioned Officers. Commissioned Officers are all teachers or other staff already working at the school.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.kingsbruton.com King's Bruton]\n*\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081123054559/http://www.isi.net/reports/2003/0592_03.htm Independent Schools Inspectorate Inspection Report 2003]"
