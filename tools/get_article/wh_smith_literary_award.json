Originally open to all residents of the UK, the Commonwealth and Ireland, it later admitted foreign works in translation and works by US authors. The final three winners were Americans (Philip Roth, Donna Tartt and Richard Powers), and 2005 was the award's final year.\nThe WH Smith Illustration Award ran from 1987 to 1994.\nThe WH Smith Mind-Boggling Book Award for children's literature ran from 1993 to 1996.\nWH Smith sponsors the National Book Awards Children's Book of the Year (the \"British Children's Book Award\" through 2009).\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
