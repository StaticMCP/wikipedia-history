All sides agreed not to settle the territory between the Southern Bug and Dnieper rivers.

The Ottoman sultan then recognized Russia's sovereignty in the Left-bank Ukraine region and the Zaporozhian Cossack domain, while the southern part of the Kiev region, the Bratslav region, and Podolia were left under Ottoman control.\nThe Bakhchisaray peace treaty once again redistributed land between neighboring states.
