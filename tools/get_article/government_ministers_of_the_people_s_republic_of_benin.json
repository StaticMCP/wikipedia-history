However, the first two governments (1972-1976), each lasting two years, in addition to the third government lasting four years, were composed solely of military personnel. These governments were thus referred to as \"Revolutionary Military Government\". All civilians were therefore excluded from political power. However, the 1979 cadre conference allowed some intellectuals, particularly teachers, to take an interest in the country's politics. This explains the change in the title of the governments. From then on, they are referred to as the \"National Executive Council\", and nine governments are formed within this framework. The twelve governments formed comprise a total of two hundred six members.\nKey Ministries\nThe government consisted of:\n| minister1_termstart    = December 2, 1975\n| minister1_termend      = 1980\n| minister1_party        = People's Revolutionary Party of Benin\n| minister2              = Simon Ifede Ogouma\n| minister2_termstart    = 1980\n| minister2_termend      = 1982\n| minister2_party        = People's Revolutionary Party of Benin\n| minister3              = Tiamiou Adjibadé\n| minister3_termstart    = 1982\n| minister3_termend      = 1984\n| minister3_party        = People's Revolutionary Party of Benin\n| minister4              = Frédéric Affo\n| minister4_termstart    = 1984\n| minister4_termend      = 1987\n| minister4_party        = People's Revolutionary Party of Benin\n| minister5              = Guy Landry Hazoumé\n| minister5_termstart    = 1987\n| minister5_termend      = August 1989\n| minister5_party        = People's Revolutionary Party of Benin\n| minister6              = Daniel Tawéma\n| minister6_termstart    = August 5, 1989\n| minister6_termend      = March 14, 1990\n| minister6_party        = People's Revolutionary Party of Benin\n| minister7              = Théophile Nata\n| minister7_termstart    = March 14, 1990\n| minister7_termend      = December 2, 1990\n| minister7_party        = People's Revolutionary Party of Benin\n}}\n.\n| minister1_termstart    = June 20, 1975\n| minister1_termend      = February 12, 1980\n| minister1_party        = People's Revolutionary Party of Benin\n| minister2              = Vincent Guezodje\n| minister2_termstart    = February 12, 1980\n| minister2_termend      = September 18, 1982\n| minister2_party        = People's Revolutionary Party of Benin\n| minister3              = Michel Alladaye\n| minister3_termstart    = September 18, 1982\n| minister3_termend      = August 3, 1984\n| minister3_party        = People's Revolutionary Party of Benin\n| minister4              = Édouard Zodehougan\n| minister4_termstart    = August 3, 1984\n| minister4_termend      = August 5, 1989\n| minister4_party        = People's Revolutionary Party of Benin\n| minister5              = Pancrace Brathier\n| minister5_termstart    = August 5, 1989\n| minister5_termend      = March 14, 1990\n| minister5_party        = People's Revolutionary Party of Benin\n| minister6              = Jean-Florentin Feliho\n| minister6_termstart    = March 14, 1990\n| minister6_termend      = April 4, 1991\n| minister6_party        = People's Revolutionary Party of Benin\n}}\n| minister1_termstart    = 1976\n| minister1_termend      = 1980\n| minister1_party        = People's Revolutionary Party of Benin\n| minister2              = Michel Alladaye\n| minister2_termstart    = 1980\n| minister2_termend      = 1982\n| minister2_party        = People's Revolutionary Party of Benin\n| minister3              = Francois Dossou\n| minister3_termstart    = 1983\n| minister3_termend      = 1984\n| minister3_party        = People's Revolutionary Party of Benin\n| minister4              = Didier Dassi\n| minister4_termstart    = 1985\n| minister4_termend      = 1987\n| minister4_party        = People's Revolutionary Party of Benin\n| minister5              = Saliou Aboudou\n| minister5_termstart    = 1988\n| minister5_termend      = 1989\n| minister5_party        = People's Revolutionary Party of Benin\n| minister6              = Yves Yehouessi\n| minister6_termstart    = 1990\n| minister6_termend      = 1991\n| minister6_party        = People's Revolutionary Party of Benin\n}}\n|}\nSee also\n* History of Benin\nReferences"
