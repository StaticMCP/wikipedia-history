The flag is most frequently displayed in the vice president's office and during official functions where the vice president is present, mostly during speeches.\nThe first official design of the flag was created in 1947, followed by two succeeding iterations before a redesign similar to the presidential standard was adopted in 2004.\nDesign\nThe current flag is defined in Executive Order 310 signed by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo:\nThe design of the  flag is essentially identical to the presidential standard. The background color, consistent across all historical versions, is white. Unlike the presidential coat of arms, the vice president’s arms do not feature a ring of stars around the sun.\nUsage\nmeets with Apostolic Nuncio to the Philippines Charles John Brown in August 2021, with the vice presidential seal and flag displayed in the background.]]\nThe vice president's color, featuring a golden yellow fringe, is displayed in the office, usually alongside the flag of the Philippines or the flag of the Office of the Vice President (a white field bearing the office’s seal), and is sometimes used as a backdrop during speeches.\nThe flag has also been displayed in the office of the executive department concurrently headed by the vice president, as was the case with Vice President Sara Duterte during her tenure as Secretary of Education from 2022 to 2024. Unlike the presidential standard, the vice president’s flag is not typically featured in official portraits, where the national flag is preferred.\nHistory\n1947 flag\nThe flag was first defined in 1947 by Executive Order No. 38 (s. 1947) signed by President Manuel Roxas, in which the presidential flag and seal were created. It indicated that the vice presidential flag will follow the pattern of the president's, except that the sun and the corner stars were to be blue to create a distinction.\n1951 flag\n1951 vice presidential flag based on the specifications in Executive Order No. 457.\n| image2 = Flag of the Vice President of the Philippines (Purported) (1951–1972).svg\n| alt2 =\n| caption2 =  Purported design of the flag as used by Vice President Fernando Lopez.\n}}\nAfter President Elpidio Quirino amended Roxas's order under Executive Order No. 457 (s. 1951), he changed the design of the coat of arms, and ordered that it would be identical to the president's, but without the ring of stars. This version of the flag was used until 1972, when the office was abolished by martial law and subsequently excluded from the original text of the 1973 Constitution.\nPhotographic evidence from the Iloilo ancestral home of Maria Salvacion Javellana, the wife of Vice President Fernando Lopez, suggests that a vice presidential standard similar to the president’s flag in 1947 was used by Lopez. The flag featured the vice presidential coat of arms on a white field with four golden yellow corner stars. It remains unknown when exactly the flag was in use – whether during the first two years of his vice presidency, when the Roxas order had not yet been amended, or afterward, either during the Quirino or Marcos administrations, when President Quirino modified the design to follow the presidential standard without the ring of stars, but without specifying whether the four corner stars remained.\n1986 flag\nAfter the position was restored in 1986, a literal reading of Quirino's order confused as to the appearance of the flag and the coat of arms. While the government adopted the seal with a blue background, they have adopted a flag with a white background.\n2004 flag\nTo clarify the subsequent executive orders regarding the vice presidential coat-of-arms, seal and flag, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo in 2004 signed Executive Order No. 310, defining the design of both positions' coats-of-arms, seals and flags.\nSee also\n*Vice President of the Philippines\n*Seal of the vice president of the Philippines\n*Flag of the president of the Philippines\nReferences"
