A March 1995 show, once again in Cleveland, Ohio, was recorded for Overkill's first full-length live album and was released in April 1995; with the first pressing featuring a bonus CD containing the Overkill EP that had been out of print for ten years. A music video for the song \"Bastard Nation\" was also released. Wrecking Your Neck is also the last Overkill album to feature guitarists Rob Cannavino and Merritt Gant, and their first release on CMC, following the end of their near-decade-long tenure with Atlantic Records.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n* Bobby \"Blitz\" Ellsworth – lead vocals\n* D.D.
