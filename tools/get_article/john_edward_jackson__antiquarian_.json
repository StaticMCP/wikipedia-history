He was educated at Charterhouse School, matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford on 9 April 1823, graduated B.A. with second-class classical honours in 1827, and proceeded to M.A. in 1830.\nIn 1834 he was ordained curate of Farleigh Hungerford, Somerset. In 1845 he became rector of Leigh Delamere with Sevington, Wiltshire, and in 1846 vicar of Norton Coleparle in the same county. He was also a rural dean and in 1855 became an honorary canon of Bristol Cathedral.\nHe was greatly interested in geology, and his collection of fossils was left to the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society, of which he was a founder member, and became secretary and then editor of its magazine. But he later became more interested in history and topography, which were the subject of most of his published works. The most important of these was The Topographical Collections of John Aubrey (1862), which greatly extended the work on which it was based.\nJackson was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. He was librarian to the Marquess of Bath, and arranged and indexed the bulk of the manuscripts at Longleat House. He published a number of these manuscripts. Longleat Papers A.D. 1553–1588 appeared in 1872, and two of his papers have appendices with relevant documents from the Longleat archives: Wulfhall and the Seymours (1874); and Amye Robsart (1877).\nPersonal life\nIn 1851, he was living alone with a housekeeper and a housemaid.  In 1861, he was at the Parsonage, Leigh Delamere, with two nephews both aged fifteen, a housekeeper, and a housemaid.\nHe died in March 1891, leaving a personal estate valued at £34,505, . His executors were two of his nephews, John Houlton Jackson, a senior clerk in the War Office, and Morton Strode Jackson, a principal clerk in the Inland Revenue Office.\nWorks\n, drawn by Jackson in 1852]]\nJackson's published works were:\n* [https://archive.org/details/historyparishgr00socigoog The History of Grittleton, co.
