It is considered the biggest and most important music award in Brazil. Its goal is to value the diversity and richness of Brazilian music, recognizing artists of different genres and styles. The award seeks to highlight the contribution of musicians and composers to Brazilian culture, promoting the appreciation and recognition of talents throughout the country.\nSince 1993, with the exception of 2002 and 2009, it has been held at the Theatro Municipal do Rio de Janeiro, one of the most important and traditional cultural venues in Brazil. Throughout its history, the PBM has paid tribute to great names in Brazilian music and has established itself as a prestigious event in the Brazilian cultural scene. At each edition, artists are awarded in various categories, reflecting the wide range of musical expressions present in the country.\nThe award was initially known by the names of its sponsors, being called Sharp Awards (), Caras Awards () and TIM Music Awards (). In February 2025, in the 32nd edition, the award became known as BTG Pactual Brazilian Music Awards ().\nThe awards are the Brazilian equivalent to the Grammy Awards for music, and it is one of the major awards in Brazil along with the APCA Prize () for television, Grand Prize of Brazilian Cinema () for motion pictures, and Shell Theatre Prize () for stage performances.\nHistory\nCreation and early years\nof the award in 2014.]]\nThe Brazilian Music Awards was conceived by José Maurício Machline, also known as Zé Maurício, in 1987. Machline, a passionate lover of music, television, theater and literature, created the award to value the diversity and richness of Brazilian music. He sought to encourage the discovery of new talent and promote productive encounters between the various trends in contemporary Brazilian music, seeking the highest quality in all musical genres.\nInitially sponsored by Sharp Corporation, it was known as the Sharp Brazilian Music Awards from its first edition in 1988 (referring to the previous year, 1987) until 1998. In 1995, Sharp also created an award for excellence in Brazilian theater. However, in 1999, when the Sharp Music Awards was to be held for its 12th edition and the Sharp Theatre Awards for its 5th edition, the global economic crisis prevented the ceremony from taking place. The list of winners was released, but the winners received only a symbolic prize, without the traditional award ceremony. The award ceremony was not held in 2000 and 2001.\nReturn, new sponsorships and nomenclature\nIn 2002, the award was transformed into the Caras Awards, sponsored by Caras magazine. The following year, it became the TIM Music Awards, sponsored by the telephone operator TIM, which lasted until 2008. In 2009, the award was independently produced and had the support of the Brazilian artistic class. From that edition onwards, the award adopted the definitive name of Brazilian Music Awards. In 2010, it kept the same name, sponsored by the company Vale.\nCeremonies\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!No.\n!Date\n!Local\n!City\n!Tribute\n!\n|-\n!colspan=\"5\"|Sharp Brazilian Music
