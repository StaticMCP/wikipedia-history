However, he declined the nomination for political reasons, and the position instead went to Ethel R. Fuller.\nBy 1961, Bergerson's interests had shifted to wordplay and constrained writing.  He became fascinated with palindromes and set out to write a coherent, full-length palindromic poem.  The result, the 1034-letter \"Edna Waterfall\", was for some time listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the longest palindrome in English.\nIn 1969, Bergerson became editor of Word Ways: The Journal of Recreational Linguistics, though stepped down a year later when Greenwood Periodicals dropped the publication.  However, he continued to contribute material to Word Ways for several decades, including memorable articles on palindromes, anagrams, panalphabetic windows, pangrammatic windows, self-referencing acrostics, and vocabularyclept poetry.  He also published games and puzzles in ''Reader's Digest and other magazines.\nHis 1973 book Palindromes and Anagrams was influential among wordplay enthusiasts, and has been hailed by critics as a \"sine qua non'' for all serious logologists\" and the greatest ever book on palindromes.  He is often cited, along with Leigh Mercer and J. A. Lindon, as one of the greatest palindromists of all time.\nPersonal life\nBergerson was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota on July 29, 1922.  His mother, Margaret Jeske, later married Ludvick Bergerson, who became his adopted father.  Bergerson's youth was spent in the mill towns of the Pacific Northwest.  After serving in the US Army in the Guadalcanal Campaign of World War II, he moved to Sweet Home, Oregon, down the road from the mill where he worked as a shingle weaver for over 50 years.  In 1967 he met and married Nellie Wilson (née McLaughlin) and adopted her three youngest children; the marriage lasted until Nellie's death in 1987.  His subsequent marriage, to Christine Stamm, lasted three years.\nIn 2010 Bergerson moved from Sweet Home to Woodinville, Washington.  He died the following year in Kirkland, Washington.\n}}\nExternal links\n*[//www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlKf303yOtDzkNrwQ-cSvjoc2G3uCnZxn Howard Bergerson Interviews – Mathematics and Poetry]\n*[https://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1394&context=wordways Text of \"Edna Waterfall\"]"
