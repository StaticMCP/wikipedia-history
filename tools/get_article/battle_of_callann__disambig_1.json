It took place in the townland of Callann or Collon near modern-day Kilgarvan, County Kerry. MacCarthaigh was victorious.\nBackground\nOusted King of Leinster, Diarmait Mac Murchada (Dermot MacMurragh), sought help in regaining his kingdom from Cambro-Norman mercenaries. The Normans landed at Bannow Bay, on the south coast of Leinster on 1 May 1169, seized Leinster within weeks and launched raids into neighbouring kingdoms. In the autumn of 1171, King Henry II of England decided to lead a military expedition to Ireland to establish his control over both the Norman warlords and the Irish. Norman expansion continued.\nCauses of the Battle\nIn 1259, John FitzThomas FitzGerald, 1st Baron Desmond received a royal grant of Desmond and west Waterford in fee. Fineen MacCarthy, son of Donal Gott MacCarthy and King of Desmond gathered his troops.\nIn July 1261 the MacCarthys decided to face the Normans at Callan and won a complete victory. Both John FitzGerald and his son, Maurice, died in the fighting.\nContemporary accounts of the battle\nAll of the following excerpts were taken from the University College of Cork's Corpus of Electronic Texts (CELT), which can be found online.\n;Annals of Connacht:\n1261.5\t Very destructive war was waged against the Galls(foreigners) this year by Fingen son of Domnall Mac Carthaig and his kinsmen.\n1261.6\t A great hosting was made by the Fitz Geralds into Desmond, to attack Mac Carthaig; but he attacked them and routed them and fitz Thomas, John by name, and his son killed there, as well as fifteen knights, besides eight noble barons and many young squires and countless soldiery.
