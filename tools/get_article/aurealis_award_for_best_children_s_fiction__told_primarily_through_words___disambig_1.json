To qualify, a work must have been first published by an Australian citizen or permanent resident between 1 January and 31 December of the current year; the presentation ceremony is held the following year. It has grown from a small function of around 20 people to a two-day event attended by over 200 people.\nSince their creation in 1995, awards have been given in various categories of speculative fiction. Categories currently include science fiction, fantasy, horror, speculative young adult fiction—with separate awards for novels and short fiction—collections, anthologies, illustrative works or graphic novels, children's books, and an award for excellence in speculative fiction. The awards have attracted the attention of publishers by setting down a benchmark in science fiction and fantasy. The continued sponsorship by publishers such as HarperCollins and Orbit has identified the award as an honour to be taken seriously.\nThe results are decided by a panel of judges from a list of submitted nominees; the long-list of nominees is reduced to a short-list of finalists. Ties can occur if the panel decides both entries show equal merit, however they are encouraged to choose a single winner. The judges may declare a \"no award\" if there is unanimous agreement that none of the nominees are worthy. The judges are selected from a public application process by the Award's management team.\nThis article lists all the short-list nominees and winners in the best children's fiction (told primarily through words) category, as well as works that have received honourable mentions or have been highly commended. The best children's fiction (told primarily through words) award was created in 2001, as best children's long fiction, along with an award for children's short fiction. In 2008 the award was renamed \"best children's novel\" and in 2010 was renamed again to \"best children's fiction (told primarily through words)\". Since 2001, honourable mentions and high commendations have been awarded intermittently. Of the 11 winners, three people have won the award twice – Garth Nix, Lian Tanner and Gabrielle Wang. John Flanagan holds the record for most nominations with five.\nThis award has been merged with that for best children's fiction (told primarily through pictures) into an award for best children's book.\nWinners and nominees\nIn the following table, the years correspond to the year of the book's eligibility; the ceremonies are always held the following year. Each year links to the corresponding \"year in literature\" article. Entries with a blue background have won the award; those with a white background are the nominees on the short-list. If the short story was originally published in a book with other stories rather than by itself or in a magazine, the book title is included after the publisher's name.\nWinners and joint winners\nNominees on the shortlist\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"width:85%; margin:1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:10%;\"|Year\n! style=\"width:22.5%;\"|Author(s)\n! style=\"width:28%;\"|Work(s)\n! style=\"width:22.5%;\"|Publisher\n! style=\"width:5%;\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n| * || Candle Iron || Angus & Robertson ||\n|-\n|  || Market Blues || Allen & Unwin ||\n|-\n|  || Blat Magic || Angus & Robertson ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n| * || In the Garden of Empress Cassia || Puffin Books ||\n|-\n|  || Astrid Spark, Fixologist || Allen & Unwin ||\n|-\n|  || Eglantine || Allen & Unwin ||\n|-\n|  || Rhianna and the Dogs of Iron || Scholastic ||\n|-\n|  || Lily Quench and the Treasure of Mote Ely || Hodder Headline ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n| * || Mister Monday || Allen & Unwin ||\n|-\n|  || Max Remy Superspy: The Hollywood Mission || Random House ||\n|-\n|  || Eustace || Allen & Unwin ||\n|-\n|  || Jumpman Rule 2 || Random House ||\n|-\n|  || Dragonkeeper || Black Dog Books ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n| * || How to Live Forever || Random House ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Random House ||\n|-\n|  || Claire de Lune || Penguin Books ||\n|-\n|  || Snow, Fire, Sword || Random House ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Penguin Books ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n| * || Drowned Wednesday || Allen & Unwin ||\n|-\n|  || Little Fur || Penguin Books ||\n|-\n|  || Worm Story || Penguin Books ||\n|-\n|  || Sassycat: The Night of the Dead || Omnibus Books ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n| * || Melissa, Queen of Evil || Pan Macmillan ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Viking Press ||\n|-\n|  || Oakleaf Bearers || Random House ||\n|-\n|  || Twilight in the Land of Nowhen || Allen & Unwin ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Omnibus Books ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n| * || , The Herb of Grace, The Cat’s Eye Shell, The Lightning Bolt, The Butterfly in Amber || Pan Macmillan ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Penguin Books ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Omnibus Books ||\n|-\n|  || Dragon Moon || Black Dog Books ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n| * ||  || Omnibus Books ||\n|-\n|  || Moonshadow || Random House ||\n|-\n|  || Thomas Trew and the Island of Ghosts || Hodder Children's ||\n|-\n|  || Dragon Dawn || Black Dog Books ||\n|-\n|  ||  and The Dust Devils || Angus & Robertson ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n| * ||  || Puffin Books ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Random House ||\n|-\n|  || Cicada Summer || Allen & Unwin ||\n|-\n|  || Tensy Farlow and the Home for Mislaid Children || Viking Press ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|  || The Keepers || Allen & Unwin ||\n|-\n|  || Grimsdon || Random House ||\n|-\n|  || ''Halt's Peril || Random House ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Pan Macmillan ||\n|-\n|  & Gus Gordon  || Haggis McGregor and the Night of the Skull Moon || Penguin Books ||\n|-style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n| *  || City of Lies || Allen & Unwin ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Random House ||\n|-\n|   ||  || Allen & Unwin ||\n|-\n|   ||  || Allen & Unwin (Headspinners) ||\n|-\n|   ||  || Allen & Unwin ||\n|-style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" |\n| * || Brotherband: The Hunters || Random House Australia ||\n|-\n|  || Princess Betony and the Unicorn || Walker Books ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Scholastic ||\n|-\n|  || Irina the Wolf Queen'' || Xoum Publishing ||\n|}\nHonourable mentions and highly commended novels\nIn the following table, the years correspond to the year of the book's eligibility; the ceremonies are always held the following year.
