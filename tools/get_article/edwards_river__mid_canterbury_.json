A tributary of the Bealey River, it arises in the Polar Range to the east of Arthur's Pass and flows south-west within Arthur's Pass National Park. The Mingha River joins it just before it enters the Bealey. It is one of the headwaters of the Waimakariri River.\nA tramping track runs part of the way along the river to a backcountry hut.\nSee also\n*List of rivers of New Zealand\nReferences\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081014041929/http://www.linz.govt.nz/placenames/search/index.aspx Land Information New Zealand] - Search for Place Names"
