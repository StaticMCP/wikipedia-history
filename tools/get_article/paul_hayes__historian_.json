His field of study was the 20th century, with a focus on fascism.\nEarly life\nHayes was educated at St John's College, Oxford, where in 1963 he took his first degree in Modern History, and then at Nuffield College, where he completed a doctorate, and also at the Universities of Dijon, Marburg, Lausanne, and Oslo.\nCareer\nIn 1965, Hayes was elected as a fellow and tutor at Keble College, Oxford, where he remained until shortly before his death, and was also a University Lecturer in Modern History. At Keble, he was an enthusiast for college cricket, and was instrumental in securing the admission of Imran Khan, after he had been turned down by Cambridge.\nHayes was Junior Proctor of the University for the year 1980–1981, with responsibility for enforcing University discipline and sanctions and for the conduct of public examinations. In the 1980s, he was Tutor for Admissions at Keble.\nIn 1991, as Senior Tutor of Keble, Hayes was involved in a dispute over Phil Weston, a cricketer who had been expected to join the college but did not do so after being refused permission to absent himself for much of his first term on a cricket tour of Pakistan. Hayes was accused of intransigence by Peter Roebuck, writing in The Times, but he made a firm reply, and others defended him.\nInterviewed in 2005, one of Hayes’s pupils, the Conservative politician Philip Dunne, said that he had taken no part in student politics at Oxford but Hayes and Larry Siedentop had influenced him by drawing international political themes to his attention.\nPersonal life\nOn 3 February 1981, at Oxford, Hayes married Ursel Kiehne. They had one son and one daughter, born in 1991.\nHayes died on 30 October 1995, after a long illness. A memorial service was held in the Keble College chapel on 20 January 1996.\nPublications\n*\"Quisling's Political Ideas\", in Journal of Contemporary History (January, 1966)\n*Quisling.
