In comparison, the relative share of the vote enjoyed by the Conservatives nearly doubled. This is explained by the fact that in this election, most southern Irish seats were uncontested as opposed to the previous year, so the Irish Parliamentary Party had no contests in seats they were popular and won in walkovers. Despite a drop in their relative share of the vote the Parliamentary party only lost one seat, with the bulk of their seats – 66 – being unopposed. In total the Parliamentary party stood some 97 candidates, the Conservatives 28 (three of whom were unopposed), the Liberal Unionists seven, and the Liberals just three.\nWhilst the Liberal Unionists gained two seats – South Londonderry and South Tyrone – the Conservatives lost the seat of Belfast West to the Parliamentary party.\nNot included in the totals are the two Dublin University seats, which were retained by Conservatives standing on a Unionist ticket.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party || rowspan=\"2\"|Leader || colspan=\"3\"|Seats || colspan=\"3\"|Votes\n|-\n!# of Seats || % of Seats || Seat Change || # of Votes || % of Votes || Vote Change\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Irish Parliamentary\n|Charles Stewart Parnell\n|align=\"right\" | 84\n|align=\"right\" | 83.2\n|align=\"right\" | 1\n|align=\"right\" | 91,083\n|align=\"right\" | 46.7\n|align=\"right\" | 20.6\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Conservative\n|Lord Salisbury\n|align=\"right\" | 15\n|align=\"right\" | 14.9\n|align=\"right\" | 1\n|align=\"right\" | 76,257\n|align=\"right\" | 39.1\n|align=\"right\" | 16.2\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Liberal Unionist\n|Joseph Chamberlain\n|align=\"right\" | 2\n|align=\"right\" | 2.0\n|align=\"right\" | 2\n|align=\"right\" | 21,944\n|align=\"right\" | 11.3\n|align=\"right\" | 11.3\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Liberal\n|William Ewart Gladstone\n|align=\"right\" | 0\n|align=\"right\" | 0\n|align=\"right\" |\n|align=\"right\" | 5,710\n|align=\"right\" | 2.9\n|align=\"right\" | 3.7\n|- style=\"background-color:#F6F6F6\"\n!colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:right\"|Totals\n|align=\"right\" | 101\n|align=\"right\" | 100\n|align=\"right\" |\n|align=\"right\" | 194,994\n|align=\"right\" | 100\n|align=\"right\" |\n|-\n|colspan=\"9\" align=\"left\"|Source: B.M.
