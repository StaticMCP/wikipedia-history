The company’s cloud-based suite—also called AIMS360—supports product data management, production, inventory, ordering and related back‑office processes for fashion brands, manufacturers and wholesalers. The firm is based in Los Angeles and traces its origins to 1984 in the city’s Garment District.\nHistory\nAIMS began in 1984 in Los Angeles’ Garment District and later evolved into AIMS360. University coverage credits early development to Scott Chaban and other former fashion-industry executives.\nThe company has been active in local industry education programs and events. By the mid‑2010s, AIMS360 was being taught at institutions including the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising (FIDM), Los Angeles Trade‑Technical College and Cal Poly Pomona, and the company has donated software licenses for classroom use at Cal Poly Pomona. AIMS360 has also hosted user and education events, including an “Empowerment Conference” (2017) and a 2019 “Elevate” afternoon focused on new allocation features and integrations.\nIn 2016 the company introduced a Shopify integration, and in 2021 it announced that 100% of its software sales had transitioned to a subscription model with the help of Zuora’s platform.\nSoftware\nAIMS360 is delivered as a cloud service and runs on Microsoft Azure infrastructure. Microsoft profiled the company’s use of Azure SQL Database automatic tuning, reporting thousands of tuning actions across more than 1,400 tenant databases to remove duplicate indexes and improve query performance.\nThe suite includes modules for product information and lifecycle management, orders, inventory/warehouse, EDI, CRM, shipping and reporting. AIMS360 provides integrations with e‑commerce and wholesale platforms. JOOR publishes an official guide to its API‑based connector for AIMS360, and the AIMS360 app on Shopify’s App Store lists supported workflows such as product/variant sync, real‑time inventory and order import, and interoperability with services including QuickBooks, ShipStation and Extensiv. Earlier resource‑guide listings in industry press also note support for shipping carriers and accounting packages.\nAdoption and activity\nTrade‑press coverage regularly identifies AIMS360 as Los Angeles‑based and exhibiting at sourcing and technology events such as Sourcing at MAGIC. The company’s clients range from small and midsize brands to larger labels; a Zuora case study cites customers such as Nike Golf and Gameday Couture among AIMS360’s user base.\nLeadership\nAs of 2024, Shahrooz (Shawn) Kohan is cited in industry press as chief executive officer of AIMS360, and Shahin Kohan as president. Former managing partner Henry Cherner (1950–2017) was an industry figure involved in AIMS360’s education initiatives.\nTrademarks\nAccording to the company, “AIMS360” and “AIMS” are registered trademarks of AF Technology, LLC.\nSee also\n* List of ERP software packages\nExternal links\n*\nReferences"
