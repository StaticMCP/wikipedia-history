Bashkirs), under the command of Kazakh batyr , bypassed the Kalmyk outposts and attacked Lubzhi’s warriors while they were asleep. The assault was so sudden that Lubzhi himself “barely escaped and fled.” The Kazakhs captured a considerable number of prisoners and livestock before turning back. However, Lubzhi managed to regroup his men and overtook the raiding detachment in the  area.\nThe first to come to Lubzhi-taishi’s aid, leading a detachment of Khoshuts, was Lekbey, eager to avenge the devastation of his ulus by the Kazakhs in August 1723. Lubzhi’s messengers also reached the camp of Dorji Nazarov, who immediately marched to support his son at the head of a large cavalry corps and a camel caravan loaded with light cannons. The Kalmyk ruler could not be certain of the strength of the enemy who had attacked the Kalmyk uluses, so a special envoy was urgently dispatched to Astrakhan to the Russian governor Artemy Volynsky. In a letter delivered by the envoy Zamyang as early as August 22, 1724, Dorji Nazarov persistently requested the governor:\nThus, against Eset Kokiuly’s small force were deployed Lubzhi’s Torghut and Lekbey’s Khoshut cavalry squadrons. Behind them unfolded Dorji Nazarov’s main corps, while, if necessary, regular troops of the Russian Empire were to provide support to the Kalmyks. These forces were more than sufficient to crush the Kazakh–Karakalpak–Bashkir detachment, which, though well-armed, was small in number.\nOn the same or the following day after the raid, Kalmyk detachments managed to catch up with the Kazakhs. The battle began with a clash of cavalry units. The Kazakhs’ and Karakalpaks’ movement was slowed by the captives and livestock they were driving. The only way to break free from the pursuers was to abandon the booty, which would mean the failure of the raid; therefore, the Kazakh commanders held onto the prisoners and stubbornly pushed toward the Yaik river, fending off the pressing Kalmyks. The slow pace allowed the Kalmyk cavalry to overtake Eset Batyr, block his detachment, and force a battle upon the Kazakhs. Ultimately, the Kalmyks gained the upper hand in the mounted fight. The Kazakhs were forced to take up a defensive position. To this end, they built a “living fortress” of horses and camels arranged in a circle, within which they drove the captives and livestock. Behind the animals’ backs, musketeers and archers took cover.\nOn August 22 or 23, the main Oirat forces arrived to join the Kalmyk troops besieging the Kazakh “living fortress,” together with Dorji Nazarov himself and the camel caravan carrying cannons.\nThe Kalmyks then began an artillery bombardment of the Kazakh positions, while simultaneously attempting to storm the enemy fortification.\nThe Kazakhs, abandoning their trophies, wounded horses, and camels, led the remnants of their force in a breakout attempt. Only a few managed to escape the encirclement. Kalmyk cavalry pursued the retreating enemy, and virtually the entire allied detachment was annihilated.\nAs a result of the battle, the Kazakh, Karakalpak, and Bashkir force lost 750 men killed. However, only 415 right ears cut from the dead Kazakhs were delivered to the Astrakhan governor, which likely indicates that the Kalmyks exaggerated Kazakh losses. Or else that they cut off ears only from those Kazakhs who perished within and around the “living fortress.”\nResults\nThe further advance of Abulkhair Khan’s detachments into the uluses of the Volga Kalmyks was halted through the joint efforts of the Kalmyk taishas. However, the military potential of the latter had been significantly weakened by the almost continuous two-year struggle with the Kazakhs. As a result, by the middle of 1724 the Kalmyk Khanate no longer represented a well-organized and potentially dangerous offensive force against the Kazakhs.\nSee also\n* Struggle for Turkistan\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*  }}"
