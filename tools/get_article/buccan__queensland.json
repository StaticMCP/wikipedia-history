Fraser who selected land south of Bethania in about 1863. They attempted to grow cotton but had problems with bollworm. However, sugar cane was successfully grown in the district. One of the largest sugar cane plantations in the area was on the land which is Newstead Park today (beside the Logan River). Dairying was also an important farm industry.\nBuccan railway station () was on the disused Beaudesert railway line from Bethania to Beaudesert. The line opened on 21 September 1885 and closed in 1996.\nBuccan remained rural until acreage plots were put up for sale in the 1970s.\nOnce part of the Shire of Beaudesert, Buccan became part of Logan City in the local government amalgamations of 2008.\nDemographics\nIn the , Buccan had a population of 1,575 people, 48.8% female and 51.2% male.
