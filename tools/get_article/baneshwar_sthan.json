The people of the region were very distressed due to the famine and the water crisis. To protect the people from the crisis of water due to the famine, Arjuna created a stream of Ganga from the earth with his Siki bow and arrow. The place in the Barri village where Arjuna created the stream of Ganga became a pond which later was called as Banganga.
