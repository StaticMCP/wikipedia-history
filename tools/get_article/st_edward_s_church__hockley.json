James Hamilton of London. It was obtained by St Stephen the Martyr's Church, Newtown Row in 1896 as a mission room and consecrated as a church in its own right in 1898.\nLand was taken from the parishes of St Stephen the Martyr's Church, Newtown Row and St Matthias' Church, Farm Street, Birmingham in 1899 to form a new parish.\nIn 1942 the church was merged with St Nicolas' Church, Hockley and then with St George in the Fields, Hockley.\nReferences"
