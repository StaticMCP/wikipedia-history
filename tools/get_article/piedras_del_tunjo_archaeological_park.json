The site is one of the possible places where the soldiers of Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada killed the ruling zipa Tisquesusa in April 1537.\nThe rocks are covered with pictographs made by Muisca artists on rocks of the Guadalupe Group. Their age has not been confirmed. The area of the park used to be an hacienda, property of a wealthy family since colonial times. It was nationalized in 1946 to establish the park.\nDestruction of the ancient pictographs\nDecades of government negligence and lack of policies for the protection of archaeological heritage have resulted in the destruction of most of the ancient paintings.\nGallery\nFile:Facatativá - Piedras del Tunjo.JPG|Rock face with petroglyphs\nFile:Facatativa pictograph.JPG|Petroglyph on one of the rocks\nFile:Facatativa vandalized pictograph.JPG|Vandalised petroglyph\nSee also\n*Aguazuque, Checua, Tequendama, Tibitó, Sun Temple\n*El Abra, Cojines del Zaque\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\nExternal links\n*  [http://www.rupestreweb.info/facaresta.html Restoration and training on pictographs - a Colombian Case (Archaeological park of Facatativá)] - Rupestreweb\n*  [http://www.rupestreweb.info/facatativa.html To the rescue of the archaeological park of Facatativá] - Rupestreweb\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*"
