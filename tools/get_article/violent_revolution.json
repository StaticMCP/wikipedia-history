It was released on 25 September 2001 and is the band's first album to feature lead guitarist Sami Yli-Sirniö. After almost a decade of musical experimentation with their metal sound (starting with Renewal), with this album the band returned to their 1980s thrash metal style, although it does make use of Gothenburg metal elements.\nViolent Revolution is now considered to be the catalyst of the early 2000s thrash metal revival movement.\nReception\nIn 2005, Violent Revolution was ranked number 436 in Rock Hard magazine's book The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n;Kreator\n*Mille Petrozza – vocals, rhythm guitar\n*Sami Yli-Sirniö – lead guitar\n*Christian Giesler – bass\n*Ventor – drums\n;Production\n*Andreas Marschall – cover painting\n*Tommy Newton – engineering\n*Dirk Schelpmeier – design, photography\n*Andy Sneap – production, engineering, mastering, mixing\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for Violent Revolution\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2022)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070818203542/http://www.kreator-terrorzone.de/site/index.php?s_id=2&lang=en&detail=10 Kreator Terrorzone: Violent Revolution]"
