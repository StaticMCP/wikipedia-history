His was awarded a PhD in 1984 by the University of London.\nCareer and research\nKing discovered that the mammalian brain contains a spatial map of the auditory world and showed that its development is shaped by sensory experience. His work has also demonstrated that the adult brain represents sound features in a remarkably flexible way, continually adjusting to variations in the statistical distribution of sounds associated with different acoustic environments as well to longer term changes in input resulting from hearing loss. In addition to furthering our understanding of the neural basis for auditory perception, his research is helping to inform better treatment strategies for the hearing impaired.\nAwards and honours\nKing was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2018 for \"substantial contributions to the improvement of natural knowledge\". He is also a Fellow of The Physiological Society.\nReferences"
