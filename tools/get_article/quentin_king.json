The team didn't have a travelling reserve and called upon King due to his close proximity to the venue. He played wing three-quarter in a 18–0 win for England.\nKing, a major, was an Army rugby player and heavyweight boxing champion.\nSee also\n*List of England national rugby union players\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
