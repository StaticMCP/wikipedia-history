Of these, six were English warships commanded by Admiral Wilkinson, Vice-Admiral Brailford and captains Johnson, Meriall, Bower and Courtney.\nBattle\nIn April 1593, a Spanish naval force of 16 warships (flyboats and pinnaces) commanded by Admiral Pedro de Zubiaur and General Joanes de Villaviciosa Lizarza set out to relieve Blaye. The city was controlled by the Catholic League of France, but under heavy siege by French Royal troops, supported by English and Huguenot forces, commanded by Marshal Matignon, and blocked by sea by six English warship-squadron under Admiral Wilkenson. On 18 April the English naval force was defeated and dispersed by Zubiaur's fleet, and the Spanish troops disembarked at Blaye, relieving the Catholic forces. In the naval engagement, the English warships of admiral Wilkenson and Vice-Admiral were boarded by the Spaniards, burnt and destroyed, whilst two Spanish flyboats named Fortuna and Grifo were also sunk.\nSoon after, another Anglo-French fleet of 11 to 19 warships from Bordeaux, supported by about 40 small vessels (including six galleasses from the port of La Rochelle), arrived at Blaye, trying to block the Spanish fleet. After a fierce and unequal battle, amid an intense storm, the Spaniards were victorious, with significant loss of life on both sides due to heavy musket fire. In the end, many ships of both fleets were dispersed by the storm, and the Spanish fleet managed to return safely to the port of Pasajes.\nFor his part in the fighting, Pedro de Zubiaur was decorated by King Philip II of Spain, receiving the title of \"de general como a lo demás de escuadra para que antes que muera deje esto a los míos\".\nOn 14 July the same year another Spanish force, composed of six pinnaces, under the command of Joanes de Villaviciosa Lizarza, and 120 soldiers led by Captain Antonio Manrique de Vargas, sailed from the Basque port of Castro Urdiales, to reinforce the Catholic forces of Blaye. After the Spanish troops under Villaviciosa launched a successful assault against the Protestant positions, which resulted in over 800 Protestants killed or wounded, the siege finally ended with the withdrawal of the French-Protestant troops.\nSee also\n* Battle of Craon\n* Battle of the Bay of Biscay (1592)\n* Siege of Fort Crozon\n* Battle of Cornwall\n* French Wars of Religion\n* Catholic League of France\nNotes\nReferences\n* Bruce Wernham, Richard.
