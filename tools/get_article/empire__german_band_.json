The band recorded their first album Hypnotica in 2001.\nIn 2003, Munkes published another album, with the addition of ex-Black Sabbath singer Tony Martin on vocals and keyboardist Don Airey. The album was called Trading Souls. Airey left the band before the recording of the third Empire album, The Raven Ride (2006). With the exception of Airey and the new drummer André Hilgers, the line up of the band was identical to Trading Souls. For the 2007 album Chasing Shadows, Munkes employed a new singer, Doogie White.\nMembers\n;Current members\n*Rolf Munkes - guitars (2000-present)\n*Neil Murray - bass (2000-present)\n*André Hilgers - drums (2006-present)\n*Doogie White - vocals (2007-present)\n;Former members\n*Lance King - vocals (2000-2003)\n*Gerald Kloos - drums (2000-2006)\n*Tony Martin - vocals (2003-2007)\n*Don Airey - keyboards (2003-2006)\nTimeline\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom\nScaleMajor = increment:3 start:2000\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2000\nColors =\nid:vocals value:red         legend:Lead_Vocals\nid:guit   value:green       legend:Guitar\nid:keys   value:purple      legend:Keyboards\nid:bass   value:blue        legend:Bass\nid:drums  value:orange      legend:Drums\nid:studio value:black       legend:Studio_album\nBarData =\nbar:King text:\"Lance King\"\nbar:Martin text:\"Tony Martin\"\nbar:White text:\"Doogie White\"\nbar:Munkes text:\"Rolf Munkes\"\nbar:Murray text:\"Neil Murray\"\nbar:Kloos text:\"Gerald Kloos\"\nbar:Hilgers text:\"André Hilgers\"\nbar:Airey text:\"Don Airey\"\nPlotData =\nwidth:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4)\nbar:King from:01/01/2000 till:01/01/2003 color:vocals\nbar:Martin from:01/01/2003 till:01/01/2007 color:vocals\nbar:White from:01/01/2007 till:end color:vocals\nbar:Munkes from:01/01/2000  till:end color:guit\nbar:Murray from:01/01/2000 till:end color:bass\nbar:Kloos from:01/01/2000 till:01/01/2006 color:drums\nbar:Hilgers from:01/01/2006 till:end color:drums\nbar:Airey from:01/01/2000 till:01/01/2006 color:keys\nLineData =\nlayer:back\ncolor:studio\nat:06/01/2001\nat:06/01/2003\nat:06/01/2006\nat:06/01/2007\n}}\nDiscography\n* Hypnotica (2001)\n* Trading Souls (2003)\n* The Raven Ride (2006)\n* Chasing Shadows (2007)\nReferences"
