Austria, Bohemia, and Luxembourg had all entered teams, but failed to appear.\nThe withdrawals of those three teams turned what had been planned as a 10-match round-robin tournament into a single-match bout between Sweden and Great Britain.  The bout consisted of a best-two-of-three contest. The competition was held on July 8, 1912. In the first pull, the Swedish team steadily pulled the British squad across the center mark.  After a five-minute break, the second pull was started.  In this one, neither team gained the victory through pulling the other across the line, but after a prolonged stalemate a couple of the London men succumbed to exhaustion and sat on the ground, disqualifying them and giving the Swedes the victory.\nMedal summary\n{|\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| Men's tug of war\n| Arvid AnderssonAdolf BergmanJohan EdmanErik Algot FredrikssonCarl JonssonErik LarssonAugust GustafssonHerbert Lindström\n| Alexander Munro (Met)John Sewell (City)John James Shepherd (City)Joseph Dowler (Met)Edwin Mills (City)Frederick Humphreys (City)Mathias Hynes (Met)Walter Chaffe (Met; captain and trainer)\n| No further competitors\n|}\nThe winning team of Sweden.\n(Met - did not compete), Chaffe, Thomas Peel (Met - did not compete), Hynes, Sewell]]\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
