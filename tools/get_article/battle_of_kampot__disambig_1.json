Both sides suffered heavy casualties during the fighting but many more civilians were rendered homeless. After the fall of Kampot, the Khmer Rouge launched another offensive to capture Oudong.\nSee also\n* Battle of Oudong\n* Cambodian Civil War\n* Khmer National Armed Forces\n* Khmer Rouge\n* Operation Chenla I\n* Operation Chenla II\n* Weapons of the Cambodian Civil War\nNotes\nReferences\n*Kenneth Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975, Equinox Publishing (Asia) Pte Ltd, Djakarta 2011.\n*Kenneth Conboy, Kenneth Bowra, and Mike Chappell, The War in Cambodia 1970-75, Men-at-arms series 209, Osprey Publishing Ltd, London 1989.\n*Russell R.
