It was launched on 26 May 2015 on Sky.}} Later it also became available on Freeview, Freesat and Virgin Media.\nIt is on air 24 hours a day and features mainly older British films, both classics and B-films. The schedule also includes some American films, straight-to-video programmes, cinema shorts, extended interviews with veteran actors and period home movies of British locations.\nIn July 2018, Talking Pictures TV had an audience share of 0.50%. , it had reached an audience share of 0.63%.\nFoundation\nTPTV is a family business, founded by producer/editor Noel Cronin, and run by his daughter Sarah Cronin-Stanley with her husband Neill Stanley. Films in many genres (horror, comedy, drama and thriller) are included in the schedule. In-house productions are also shown, as are items from the Cronins' own back catalogue, including Noel's Dandelion Distribution, as well as series from the archive of Southern Television, a former ITV contractor, and early American television shows. Movies are usually copied directly from film reels; damaged reels from the catalogue are often replaced by donations, either from online, viewers or available libraries.\nOne of the aims of the founders was to maintain the history of British cinema; it was said to have been in the making since 2007. Older movies, including those made in black and white, were once regularly shown on terrestrial channels, such as BBC and Channel 4, but such programming had declined by the 2000s, with only the best known classic films occasionally being aired.\nCronin-Stanley explained to the Watford Observer in 2016 that \"People were interested in the big titles but he [her father Noel] wanted to save the smaller, more obscure titles, from getting lost\". However, television networks rejected their pitches, unconvinced that it would be of high demand, so they decided to set up the channel independently. Cronin-Stanley later explained that the channel specialises in \"the things people have forgotten\".\nAvailability\nTalking Pictures TV was initially only available via digital satellite on the Sky platform in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Since 15 September 2015, the channel has also been available on Freeview. It became available on Freesat channel 306 in February 2016, and on Virgin Media on 1 June 2017. On Freeview, it was initially broadcast only in standard definition (SDTV) on a HD multiplex and could be received only by Freeview HD equipment.\nFrom 30 November 2017, the channel became available, to those within coverage (90 percent of UK households), on any TV capable of receiving Freeview.  In 2018, the channel reportedly had a weekly audience of about 2 million, but BBC News reported that it possibly rose to as high as 6 million in mid-2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic).\nBroadcast output\nFilms\nA list of selected films shown on Talking Pictures TV:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Many of the American television shows were produced by Four Star Television.\nNew television programmes for 2022 included The Heritage Chart Show with Mike Read'', a pop music countdown of videos and live performances from veteran acts, presented on Sunday nights by the former Radio 1 disc jockey Mike Read and shared with the Local TV network of channels. Also Read can be seen each week with Talking Pictures TV founder Noel Cronin on the channel's archive programme The Footage Detectives, a show which discusses forgotten films and lost TV shows such as The Barnstormers from 1964.\nBritish programmes\n*The Adventures of Robin Hood (ITC 1955–1959)\n*Armchair Theatre (Thames Television 1968–74)\n*The Brothers (BBC 1972-76)\n*Budgie (LWT 1971–2)\n*Callan (Thames Television 1967–72)\n*Catweazle (London Weekend Television (LWT) 1970–71)\n*Colonel March of Scotland Yard (ITV 1956)\n*Crown Court (Granada 1972–1984)\n*Danger UXB (Euston Films for Thames 1979)\n*Dick Barton - Special Agent (Southern 1979)\n*The Edgar Wallace Mystery Theatre (1960–1965)\n*The Flockton Flyer (Southern 1977–78)\n*For the Love of Ada (Thames 1970–1971)\n*Freewheelers (Southern 1971–1972)\n*The Gentle Touch (LWT 1980–1984)\n*Get Some In!

Its intention is for both nostalgia and education, as well as reminding the audience of the past; some footage is donated by viewers. The series is the most popular original content on the channel and its compilation DVD is the most popular buy on Renown Film's website.\nThe Take Two series was presented by Elstree historian Morris Bright, and occasionally Robert Ross and/or the channel creators, who interview famous actors whose films and programming is airing on the channel, such as Nanette Newman, Angela Douglas, Rita Tushingham, Sylvia Syms, Michael Craig, Shirley Eaton, Sally Thomsett, Jack Smethurst, Jenny Hanley, Norman Eshley, Valerie Leon, Madeline Smith, Marc Sinden, and Janette Scott; a few of them recorded station idents for the channel. An interview with A Family at War creator John Finch was also aired, as well as Neil Sean Meets..., an interviewing series presented by Neil Sean, who has interviewed historians and celebrities of the mid-20th century, such as Tommy Steele, Roger Moore and Eden Kane.\nInterviews from 2018 onwards have been filmed in the Cinema Museum in the wake of the museum's foreclosure announcement; the interviewees there include Mark Lester, George Layton, Anita Harris, Sid James's daughter Reina, Anneke Wills, and Peter Butterworth's son Tyler. Some interviews in the series were later released on a DVD collection named Talking Pictures with....\nThemed days\nThe channel has featured themed days, such as \"An Afternoon with Liz Fraser\" (14 August 2016), \"1960s Day\", \"Sophia Loren Evening\" (20 September 2016), \"Music Hall Monday\" (18 January 2016), \"Diana Dors Day\" (14 May 2017), and \"An Afternoon with Patricia Dainton\" (12 April 2016), in which the actress came out of retirement to provide introductions to her films.  \"Laurel and Hardy Month\" aired their short films and feature-length productions throughout September 2017 and their movies continue to be shown.  \"Ronald Colman Season\" occurred throughout November and December 2016, airing movies such as The Devil to Pay!, Bulldog Drummond, and Raffles.\n15 February 2018 was \"Sam Kydd Day\", with showings of a handful of his movies and television appearances, excerpts from his diaries and anecdotes of his life from his son Jonathan. 15 March 2019 was \"John Gregson Day\" which featured movies and television that starred/featured the actor, along with interviews with his family members and remaining cast members of his filmography.

However, since late 2018, warning notices have been displayed just before some programmes begin, stating, for example, that a programme \"was made between 1978 and 1992\" and that \"Some viewers may be offended by the language and attitudes expressed by some characters ... which reflect the time it was made.\" In addition, occurrences of such terms may be removed from the soundtrack and the subtitles.\nRelated projects\nRenown Pictures\nFor over 20 years, Cronin-Stanley and Cronin have been patrons of a DVD membership club, The Renown Film Club, for fans of B-film classics. Cronin had worked for The Rank Organisation and Central Office of Information, and bought the rights to several libraries that owned films that air on TPTV, such as much of the Southern Television library, and originally licensed them out to terrestrial channels. Many of the films aired on Talking Pictures TV are available to buy on DVD, often sold as compilations under different genres, through the distributing company, both online and through the Renown's telephone service. Each DVD set is full of films made between the 1930s and 1960s, and also include special features, such as interviews and history. Other merchandise is also sold on the website, such as mugs, clothing, biographies, and calendars (available to buy in December for the new year), often branded under Talking Pictures TV's name. In spring 2019, Renown released its first CD compilation album named Hits From the Flicks, three CDs of songs from musicals and movies with pop song theme tunes that had aired on the channel.\nThe Renown Film Festival\nSince 2014, the channel's producers created the Renown Film Festival, which celebrates classic British film, featuring guest appearances by actors whose films have been aired, as well as historians, who give interviews; there are also screenings for films that were once considered lost, and memorabilia available to buy and be autographed by the actors. It occurs annually in February, and tickets are advertised on both TPTV's website and the channel. Actors who have appeared on the guest lists include Jess Conrad (who reunited with the remaining cast of The Boys in 2017), Rita Tushingham, Brian Murphy, Melvyn Hayes, and Derren Nesbitt.\nThe festival takes place in Hertfordshire, such as Watersmeet Theatre, Rickmansworth and St. Albans' The Alban Arena, but 2019 was the first year to have more than one festival in a year; October 2019 was the Renown Film's 6th Festival of Film at the Stockport Plaza, which also featured special guests, film screenings, and memorabilia. Although tickets sold out, St. Albans' 2020 Festival was postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak.\nPodcast\nA spin-off podcast named The Talking Pictures TV Podcast was announced in December 2018 by Adam Roche, the creator of the podcasts The Secret History of Hollywood and Attaboy Clarence, and began broadcasting on 3 February 2019. Each episode is uploaded monthly to coincide with TPTV's schedule releases and invites the audience to review movies and television programmes that will broadcast on the channel during that month. Its first episode became the most popular podcast in the UK iTunes chart within roughly five hours.\nTPTV Encore\nOn 1 December 2021, TPTV Encore launched. It is Talking Pictures TV's official streaming service for viewers to catch up with the latest media recently aired on the channel, as well as hosting Renown Pictures' Southern TV archive.\nSee also\n*List of television stations in the United Kingdom\n*Renown Pictures\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://www.tptvencore.co.uk/ TPTV Encore]"
