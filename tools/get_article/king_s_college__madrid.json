It was founded in 1969 and is part of King's Group.\nKing's Group is the owner company of King's College schools and is headquartered in Tenbury Wells, United Kingdom. As well as a boarding school also operating at this location, the Group also operates six other schools in Spain and Panama.

King's College soon outgrew its premises and by 1976 ten houses of differing size and design were in use in the Chamartin area of Madrid.\nAfter occupying these temporary premises for some nine years, the main school moved in 1978 to its present, purpose-built premises in the residential area of Soto de Viñuelas to the north of Madrid. Since then many improvements and additions have included a residential wing for boarding students (and later a new Boarding House built in 2011, Tenbury House), a 25m heated swimming pool housed in a state of the art Sports Centre, a 400-seat auditorium, a Music School and an Early Years Learning Centre.\nPupils follow the English National Curriculum and are prepared for IGCSE and GCE \"A\" Levels or IB (International Baccalaureate), including a wide range of subjects. There are also optional Spanish studies and preparation for Spanish University entrance examinations, in the Spanish schools.\nOver the years, further schools were added to King's Group – meaning that the group now has five more schools in Spain (Madrid, Alicante, Elche and Murcia), one in the United Kingdom, one in Panama City, one in Riga, and most recently another was opened in Cairo (September 2023).\nSchools\nKing's College, Soto de Viñuelas, Madrid\nSource:\nThe main school site caters for more than 1600 pupils between the ages of 2 and 18 years (Pre-Nursery to Year 13).
