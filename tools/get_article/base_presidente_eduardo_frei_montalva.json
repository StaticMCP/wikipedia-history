It is located at Fildes Peninsula, an ice-free area, in front of Fildes Bay, at the west end of King George Island, South Shetland Islands. Situated alongside the Escudero Station in Villa Las Estrellas and only  from the Russian Bellingshausen Station, it is at an altitude of  above sea level. The base is located in the Chilean commune of Antártica, which is the Antarctic territory claimed by Chile[https://web.archive.org/web/20040306054435/http://edenvalleychurch.net/antarctica.html Antarctica] (Antártica Chilena Province, Magallanes y la Antártica Chilena Region).\nAlso nearby are the bases of Great Wall (China), General Artigas Station (Uruguay), King Sejong Station (Republic of Korea), Carlini Base (Argentina), Commandante Ferraz (Brazil), Henryk Arctowski (Poland) and Machu Picchu Base (Peru). Further away is Captain Arturo Prat Base, also Chilean, 50&nbsp;km to the west.\nDescription\nIt has a -long airstrip (Teniente Rodolfo Marsh Martin Aerodrome, ICAO Code SCRM), with 50 intercontinental and 150 intracontinental flights each season, serving as a means of transport to many nearby bases. It also includes the Villa Las Estrellas residential area that has a hospital, a school, a bank, a small supermarket, etc. The maximum population during summer is of 150 people, and the average during winter is about 80 people.\nIt began to operate in 1969 as Centro Meteorológico Eduardo Frei. When the installations were expanded, it was renamed as Base Teniente Rodolfo Marsh, with the meteorology center keeping its original name. During the 1990s, all of the installations came to be named Base Presidente Eduardo Frei Montalva, with the airstrip retaining the name Teniente Rodolfo Marsh.\nClimate\nLike the coastal areas of Antarctic Peninsula and the subantarctic islands south of the 60º parallel, the area has a tundra climate, that could be considerably borderline \"maritime-influenced polar climate\", thanks to temperatures that rarely drop below  in winter (which is commonplace in most of Antarctica), and temperatures that could soar a few digits above freezing for most parts of the year. The base's area and its vicinity (the entire island, actually) experiences a rather heavy precipitation, with an average precipitation rate of  yearly,[http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/presidente-eduardo-frei-montalva--permanent-station-of-chile.html Presidente Eduardo Frei Montalva - permanent station of Chile, Antarctica - Sunrise, sunset, dawn and dusk times for the whole year - Gaisma] which makes it unusual on the Antarctic continent, as the continent is significantly drier than the islands are to the north.[http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/presidente-eduardo-frei-montalva--permanent-station-of-chile.html Presidente Eduardo Frei Montalva - permanent station of Chile, Antarctica - Sunrise, sunset, dawn and dusk times for the whole year - Gaisma]\n|source 2 = NOAA (precipitation days 1991–2020)\n|date=October 2012\n}}\nSee also\n* List of lighthouses in Antarctica\n* List of Antarctic research stations\n* List of Antarctic field camps\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.inach.cl/inach/ Official website Chilean Antarctic Institute]\n* [http://www.aipchile.cl/camara_ubicacion/show/designador/SCRM Webcam Teniente Martin airport];"
