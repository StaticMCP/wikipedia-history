L'anza Research International, Inc.', 523 U.S. 135 (1998), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court over whether a copyright holder could restrict redistribution of material containing copyrighted  content (authorized by the copyright holder) which is imported into the United States as so-called \"grey market\" goods.\nOpinion of the Court\nThe Supreme Court found that the copyright holder could not prevent re-importation of the products it had authorized for export from the United States.\nThis case did not address the importation of products made outside the United States under authority of the copyright holder.  The Court addressed that issue in Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 568 U.S. 519 (2013), holding that those sales were also qualifying \"first sales\", and that copyright holders could not restrict trafficking of those works after those sales.\nSee also\n* First-sale doctrine\n* List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 523\n* List of United States Supreme Court cases\n* Lists of United States Supreme Court cases by volume\nExternal links\n*\n| courtlistener =https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/118182/quality-king-distributors-inc-v-lanza-research-intl-inc/\n| findlaw = https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/523/135.html\n| googlescholar =\n| justia =https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/523/135/\n| loc = https://www.loc.gov/item/usrep523135/\n| oyez =\n}}"
