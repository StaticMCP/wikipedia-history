Although internationally seen only as an autonomous area of Somalia, the territory's self-declared independence has endured, and the twentieth anniversary was celebrated in 2011 at the National Palace in Hargeisa, Somaliland's capital, with shops closing down for the day.\nGallery\nFile:Independence monument in Hargeisa, Somaliland.jpg|Independence monument in Hargeisa, Somaliland\nReferences"
