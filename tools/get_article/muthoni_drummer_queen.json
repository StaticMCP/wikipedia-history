She collaborated with Swiss producers Jean \"Hook\" Geissbuhler and Greg \"GR!\" Escoffey, pushing boundaries with a sound that balances African roots with modern electronic influences. Her album She is particularly celebrated for its narratives about women navigating various life challenges, such as love, entrepreneurship, and family dynamics.\nHer music frequently addresses themes of empowerment and justice. For instance, her song \"Kenyan Message\" critiques socio-political issues, drawing inspiration from events like the 2017 doctors' strike in Kenya while paying homage to Grandmaster Flash’s \"The Message.\" This blend of cultural pride and activism underscores her artistic vision of amplifying African voices globally.\nMuthoni's creative process also includes her distinct performance style, which integrates traditional African drumming, further asserting her cultural identity in diverse spaces.

Blankets and Wine is a music festival whose main agenda is highlighting less popular, and non-mainstream musicians in Africa. It started off being held in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, but then became expanded by reoccurring in places such as Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda. A sister festival was also created in 2017 called Africa Nouveau. Africa Nouveau is a 3-day festival similar to the Blankets and Wine but it focuses on Pan-Africanism through its creators and not just underground talent in Africa.\nBlankets and Wine provides vendors who sell different products such as clothing, food, and more. The areas for these fairs within the festival are called Blanket Soko and Onja Onja. Blanket Soko promotes fashion, photography, art, jewelry, tattoos, and more. Onja Onja is where versatile food vendors come and sell their food, whether it's vegan, vegetarian, or based on any other dietary preferences or needs.\nIn 2021, Muthoni joined Spotify Equal Music Programme.\nAwards\nMuthoni Ndonga, has won many awards throughout her musical career.
