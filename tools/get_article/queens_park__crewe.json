The Friends are a community group who represent the park, they also raise money to put on events in the Park and to implement new ideas.\nFeatures\nThe park is popular with Crewe residents and features the largest lake in the area, which also has boats for hire. Other prominent features of the park include a Grade II listed Victorian clock tower, two Grade II listed lodges at the entrance from Victoria Avenue, a man-made waterfall, a large playground, and several statues and fountains. At the centre of the park is the Grade II listed Boer War Memorial. Other memorials include one to the first Gulf War, and Verdun trees.\nSport\nA parkrun takes place at the park each Saturday morning at 9&nbsp;am. It began on 17 February 2018.\nGallery\nFile:War Memorial, Queen's Park, Crewe - geograph.org.uk - 247607.jpg|Boer War Memorial\nFile:Clock Tower, Queen's Park, Crewe - geograph.org.uk - 247615.jpg|Clock Tower\nFile:East Lodge at Queen's Park, Crewe.jpg|East Lodge\nFile:West Lodge at Queen's Park, Crewe.jpg|West Lodge\nSee also\n*Listed buildings in Crewe\n*List of parks and open spaces in Cheshire\nReferences\nNotes\nCitations\n}}"
