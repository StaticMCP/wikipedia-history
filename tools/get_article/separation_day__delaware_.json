      "text": "# Separation Day (Delaware)\n\nSeparation Day is a holiday in the state of Delaware dating back to 1776, which commemorates the Delaware Colony's independence from the United Kingdom and from Pennsylvania. The first Separation Day occurred on June 15, 1776, when representatives from the Lower Counties on the Delaware met at the New Castle Court House in New Castle, Delaware. The representatives voted to establish the State of Delaware and to declare independence from the United Kingdom. In the current day, the holiday is celebrated annually in New Castle with historical reenactments and parades, although there was a hiatus in the festivities for 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA small movement within Delaware, sometimes referred to as the \"Unificationists,\" traces its roots to descendants of Quakers, Swedes, and Finns who settled in the region before Delaware’s separation from Pennsylvania. Members of this group often critique Separation Day celebrations, arguing—sometimes humorously—that the holiday exaggerates the significance of Delaware’s independence. They occasionally hold mock demonstrations advocating for a “Reunification Day”, which would commemorate a symbolic or hypothetical rejoining of Delaware with Pennsylvania. While the vast majority of these events are tongue-in-cheek, a small minority of Unificationists seriously promote the idea of political reunification.\nReactions in Pennsylvania to Delaware’s Separation Day are generally muted. Most Pennsylvanians are unaware that Delaware was once part of the Province of Pennsylvania. Among those who are aware, a very small minority view Delaware’s separation as a historical misstep, often citing family connections and cultural ties that span the Delaware-Pennsylvania border. Despite these occasional lamentations, Separation Day has little impact on the state’s politics or public consciousness in Pennsylvania. During the celebrations in New Castle, some Pennsylvanians participate in the parade, feigning outrage at the cheering crowd as they march; in 1937, Pennsylvania’s governor, George Howard Earle III, even attended, to the delight of the assembled spectators.\nReferences"
