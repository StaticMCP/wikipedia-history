Aksai Chin, claimed by India to belong to Ladakh and by China to be part of Xinjiang, contains an important road link that connects the Chinese regions of Tibet and Xinjiang. China's construction of this road was one of the triggers of the conflict.\nBattle\nThe post at Bum La Pass was attacked by the Chinese forces on 23 October 1962. They were invading the town of Tawang and on the ancient path coming down from Bum La. The Chinese engaged in a battle with 20 Sikhs led by Joginder Singh. The Chinese 2nd and 3rd Companies attacked in three different waves. The Sikh troops \"...mowed down the first wave and the enemy temporarily halted by the heavy losses it suffered\". Joginder asked for more ammunition from the Company HQ but the telephone line had been cut. \"Within a few minutes, a second wave came over and was dealt with similarly,\" reads the Citation of Indian Army about Joginder Singh and the battle of IB Ridge. By now, only half of the Sikh soldiers were able to remain in the fight and ammunition was practically exhausted. As the third wave of Chinese troops advanced, Singh manned a machine gun and ordered his remaining soldiers fix bayonets. The heroic yet ultimately futile bayonet charge caught the Chinese by surprise. The Sikhs were able to disrupt the Chinese advance briefly  before they were cut down by automatic fire. It is believed by Indians that Joginder Singh single-handedly killed 56 soldiers. He was taken into Chinese captivity where he would later die.\nFootnote\nSee also\n* Aksai Chin\n* Joginder Singh (soldier)\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n*}}\n*\n*\n*\n*"
