He helped bring many small Malnad chiefs like the Kongalvas, Chengalvas, Santharas of Humcha Shimoga and the Kadambas of Bayalnadu (Vainadu) under control. After the complete disappearance of the Gangas during Chola occupation of Gangavadi, Vinayaditya brought some small portions of Gangavadi under his control. He was either a brother-in-law or father-in-law of Chalukya Someshvara I.\nVinayaditya conquered and ruled over South Kanara and Mysore. He was a great builder of cities and towns. He was succeeded by his grandson Veera Ballala I as Vinayaditya's son Ereyanga had predeceased him.\nNotes\nReferences\n* Suryanath U.
