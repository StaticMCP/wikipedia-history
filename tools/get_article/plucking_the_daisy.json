He called this movie \"a hack job based on an 'original idea' by the producer which was anything but original... I changed the plot and wrote an amusing, romantic and sexy story.\"\nReception\nBox office\nIn 1956, the film was the 20th most popular of the year, at the French box office. It was released before Bardot's film And God Created Woman, which was the 13th most popular and Naughty Girl which was 12th.\nCritical reception\nIt was released in the US as Mademoiselle Striptease. The Washington Post called it \"one of the nicest comedies of the summer.\" The Los Angeles Times called it \"a most delightful, naughty and very funny comedy... Bardot strikes pure gold... it's strictly a fun show that doesn't try to prove a thing.\"\nIt was also released in the US as Please Mr Balzac. The New York Times said the \"sole excuse for this singularly unfrothy and unfunny romantic comedy is Brigitte Bardot....[a] thin, old-fashioned, slightly smutty and extremely dull charade... The picture is pretty awful. It needn't have been.\"\nIn a retrospective review, Turner Classic Movies called it \"a typical French romantic comedy... complete with a meet-cute on a train, and plenty of loving shots of Bardot's pert behind.... typical of the suggestive but innocuous films that Bardot made early in her career.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
