It was separated into two categories—Most Improved On-screen Performance Award—Drama (螢幕大躍進獎—戲劇組) and Most Improved On-screen Performance Award—Non-drama (螢幕大躍進獎—非戲劇組), to individually recognize actors and variety presenters. The award was re-established in 2002, changing its name to My Favourite Most Improved Male Artiste of the Year (本年度我最喜愛的飛躍進步男藝員). In 2005, the name was changed to Most Improved Male Artiste (飛躍進步男藝員).\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Table key\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#FAEB86; height:20px; width:20px\"|\n| Indicates the winner\n|}\nwon TVB's first Most Improved Artiste award for his performance in Secret of the Heart in 1998.]]\nwon in 2002 for his performance in Where the Legend Begins.]]\nwon in 2003 for his performance in ''Survivor's Law.]]\nwon in 2005 for his performance in Wars of In-Laws.]]\nwon in 2011.]]\nwon in 2014.]]\n1990s\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Category\n! style=\"width:25%;\"| Artiste\n! style=\"width:25%;\"| Work(s)\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| rowspan=\"3\" |1998(2nd)\n|Drama\n| Nick Cheung\n| Secret of the Heart\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n|Non-drama\n| Chin Ka-lok\n| The Super Trio Show\n|}\n2000s\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:25%;\"| Artiste\n!
