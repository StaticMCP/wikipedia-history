      "text": "# HWA Silver Hammer Award\n\nThe Horror Writers Association (HWA) periodically gives the Silver Hammer Award to an HWA volunteer who has done a truly massive amount of work for the organization, often unsung and behind the scenes. It was instituted in 1996, and is decided by a vote of HWA's board of trustees.\nThe award is so named because it represents the careful, steady, continuous work of building HWA's \"house\" — the many institutional systems that keep the organization functioning on a day-to-day basis. The award itself is a chrome-plated hammer with an engraved plaque on the handle. The chrome hammer is also a satisfying allusion to The Beatles' song, \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\", a miniature horror story in itself.\nIn September 2022 the HWA announced that the award would be renamed the Karen Lansdale Silver Hammer Award, in honour of her work establishing the organisation, and that the award itself would be redesigned.\nThe Horror Writers Association is a worldwide organization promoting dark literature and its creators. It has over 700 members who write, edit and publish professionally in fiction, nonfiction, videogames, films, comics, and other media.\nPast winners\nPast award winners include:\n* (1997) Lawrence Watt-Evans and Robert Weinberg\n* (1998) Sheldon Jaffery\n* (2001) Nancy Etchemendy\n* (2003) Douglas E.
