He also accused Zhang Chang (張昶) of cherishing the Yuan dynasty, which was highly valued by Zhu Yuanzhang.\nIn 1368, he was appointed as the Assistant Administrator of the Imperial Secretariat (參知政事). The following year, he was promoted to the position of Vice Chancellor of the Right (右丞) and given the name Yang Xian. During his tenure, he impeached Vice Chancellor of the Left, Wang Guangyang, for \"failing to uphold his mother\" (奉母無狀). Yang Xian was known for his acute personality. Hu Weiyong once said to Li Shanchang, \"If Yang Xian were to become Grand Chancellor, we Huai people would not be able to become high officials\".\nIn 1370, he was appointed Vice Chancellor of the Left (左丞). Later, Li Shanchang impeached him for \"bringing false charges against a minister\" (排陷大臣) and \"acting wantonly as a traitor\" (放肆為奸), and he was killed.\nYang Xian and Liu Ji were close friends, and Yang Xian's death intensified the dispute between the East Zhe faction and the West Huai faction. After Yang Xian's death, Li Shanchang and Hu Weiyong's West Huai faction officially took control of the government.\nSee also\n*Liu Ji\n*Hu Weiyong\n*Li Shanchang\n*Wang Guangyang\n*Four Major Cases of the early Ming dynasty\nReferences\n."
