Westfield marks the southern boundary of Woking altering from English archetypal suburban homes in the north to semi-rural homes, smallholdings, small woodlands and fields in the south, where it abuts areas of London's Metropolitan Green Belt.\nHistory\nPre-history\nThere is some archaeological evidence of Late Bronze Age activity in Westfield.  Late Bronze Age artefacts have been recovered from this area and are now stored in the British Museum.\n16th century\nWestfield was one of three ‘open fields’ of the ancient town of Woking (see Old Woking) and was first recorded in 1548. The ‘west’ field was in fact divided into two areas with the ‘lower west field’ occupying the area of present-day Westfield Avenue and the Football Ground and the ‘upper west field’ covering the area to the south and east of the Westfield Road.  The Old Cricketers Inn and Cricketers Cottage on Westfield Common have a 16th-century  provenance\nBuilt in the 16th century, Walnut Tree Cottage was the site of a Liquorice factory.\n19th century\nAs well as the ‘common fields’ Westfield had a large area of ‘common land’ that, despite being bought by the London Necropolis Company in the mid-19th century, remains open even today. The registered common land is called Westfield Common.\nModern housing development\nAll of the 'modern development' of Westfield (as well as Kingfield and Old Woking) has been on the former fields of the area, with the bounds of many of these fields still traceable in the estate boundaries.
