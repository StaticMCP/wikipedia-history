It was a battle in the French conquest of Morocco. Despite inflicting greater casualties on their enemy than they sustained themselves, the French Resident-General in Morocco, Hubert Lyautey, held the field commander Charles Mangin responsible for unacceptable losses. Mangin was removed from his command, and soon returned to France.\nFollowing his victory at the Battle of Sidi Bou Othman in September 1912, Mangin had been given the command of Oued Zem.\nReferences"
