Both the Russian government and American corporations seek to protect their interests in the country while also experiencing political upheaveal at home. One-term former Republican Party President Martindale and his special interest backers challenge isolationist incumbent President Thorn in the approaching election, while Russia faces a potential military coup. McLanahan and his team eventually find themselves forming an uneasy and unorthodox alliances with the most reasonable of the Taliban leaders as President Thorn succeeds in outmaneuvering a Russian commander's attempt to declare war on America and leave them on the defensive, but fails to defuse the long-term danger posed by Russia's militaristic new president, which will be felt in the next book and far beyond.\nCritical reception\nJeremy Magadevan of the New Straits Times described the novel as \"sleep-inducing\" and said readers should \"mail it to a terrorist and wait for him to die of boredom\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Christian Sauvé, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080905181903/http://www.christian-sauve.com/reviews/2006/reviews-2006-04april.html book review], April 2006"
