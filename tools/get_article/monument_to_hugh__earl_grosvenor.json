It commemorates the brief life of the only son of Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster, who died at the age of four.  The monument consists of an enclosure in bronze around his grave, and incorporates three bronze figures.  It was designed by Detmar Blow, possibly assisted by Fernand Billerey, and the sculptor was Emile Madeline.  The monument is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade&nbsp;II listed building.\nHistory\nEdward George Hugh Grosvenor, Earl Grosvenor (16 November 1904 – 13 February 1909) was the only son of the 2nd Duke of Westminster, and died following an operation for appendicitis.  The Duke commissioned Detmar Blow to design a memorial to his son, and Blow's French partner Fernand Billerey may have also been involved in the design.  The sculptor was Emile Madeline, and the memorial was completed in 1910.\nDescription\nThe memorial consists of an enclosure of bronze railings and panels on a sandstone base, which stretch on four sides around the Earl's grave, with three bronze figures at the head of the grave.  The railings are  long,  wide, and  high.  The figures are respectively , , and  high.  The panels are decorated with heraldic symbols of the Grosvenor family, and include portcullises, wheat sheaves, coronets, and roses.  Along the top of the railings, and going round all four sides, is an inscription reading:\n}}}}\nThe tombstone is inscribed:\nAt the head of the tomb are three bronze figures, each bearing one of the Earl's given names; Edward&nbsp;I with a model of a church, Saint George with a sword and with his foot on a dragon's neck, and Saint&nbsp;Hugh with a book, and wearing bishop's robes and a mitre.  On the headstone is the carved head of an angel.\nAppraisal\nThe memorial was designated as a Grade II listed building on 2 November 1983.  Grade&nbsp;II is the lowest of the three grades of listing and is applied to \"buildings of national importance and special interest\".  The citation in the National Heritage List for England describes it as \"a tomb of admirable workmanship\".  Both Hartman et al. in the Buildings of England series, and Morris and Roberts in the Public Sculpture of England series consider that the design is in the tradition of Alfred Gilbert and suggests his influence.\nSee also\n*Listed buildings in Eccleston, Cheshire\nNotes and references\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*"
