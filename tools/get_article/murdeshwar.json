It contains the world's third tallest Shiva statue, as well as the Murudeshwara Temple. The town has a railway station on the Mangalore–Mumbai Konkan railway route.\nEtymology and Chronicles\nThe origin of the name \"Murdeshwar\" dates to the time of Ramayana. The Hindu gods attained immortality and invincibility by worshiping a divine Linga called the Atma-Linga. The Lanka King Ravana wanted to attain immortality by obtaining the Atma-Linga (Soul of Shiva). Since the Atma-Linga belonged to Shiva, Ravana worshipped Shiva with devotion. Pleased by his prayers, Shiva appeared before him and asked him what he wanted. Ravana asked for the Atma-Linga. Shiva agreed to give him the boon on the condition that it should never be placed on the ground before he reaches Lanka. If the Atma-Linga was ever placed on the ground, it would be impossible to move it. Having obtained his boon, Ravana started back on his journey to Lanka.\nLord Vishnu, who learned of this incident, realised that with the Atma-Linga, Ravana may obtain immortality and wreak havoc on Earth. He approached Ganesha and requested him to prevent the Atma-Linga from reaching Lanka. Ganesha knew that Ravana was a very devoted person who performed prayer rituals every evening without fail. He decided to make use of this fact and came up with a plan to confiscate the Atma-Linga from Ravana.\nAs Ravana was nearing Gokarna, Vishnu blotted out the sun to give the appearance of dusk. Ravana now had to perform his evening rituals but was worried because, with the Atma-Linga in his hands, he would not be able to do his rituals. At this time, Ganesha in the disguise of a Brahmin boy accosted him. Ravana requested him to hold the Atma-Linga until he performed his rituals, and asked him not to place it on the ground. Ganesha struck a deal with him saying that he would call Ravana thrice, and if Ravana did not return within that time, he would place the Atma-Linga on the ground.\nRavana returned to find that Ganesha had already placed the Atma-Linga on the ground. Vishnu then removed his illusion and it was daylight again. Ravana, realising that he had been tricked, tried to uproot and destroy the linga. Due to the force exerted by Ravana, some pieces were scattered. One such piece from the head of the linga is said to have fallen in present-day Surathkal. The Sadashiva temple is said to be built around that piece of linga. Then he decided to destroy the covering of the Atma-Linga, and threw the case covering it to a place called Sajjeshwar, 37 kilometers away. Then he threw the lid of the case to a place called Guneshwar (now Gunavanthe) and Dhareshwar, 16-19 kilometers away. Finally, he threw the cloth covering the Atma-Linga to a place called Mrideshwar in Kanduka-Giri (Kanduka Hill). Mrideshwar has been renamed to Murdeshwar.\nMajor attractions\nat the Murudeshwara temple. Two life-size elephants in concrete stand guard at the steps leading to it.]]Murudeshwara Temple was built on the Kanduka Hill which is surrounded on three sides by the waters of the Laccadive Sea. It is dedicated to Shiva, and a 20-storied Raja Gopura was constructed at the temple in 2008. The temple authorities have installed a lift that provides a view of the 123-feet Sri Shiva idol from the top of the Raja Gopura. There is also a Rameshwara linga at the bottom of the hill, where devotees can do seva themselves. A Shaneswar temple has been built next to the idol of Sri Akshayaguna. Two life-size elephants in concrete stand guard at the steps leading to it. The entire temple and temple complex, including the Raja Gopura, is one of the tallest.\nThere are statues of Sun Chariot on the side of a park, a pool, statues depicting Arjuna receiving Geetopadesham from Lord Krishna, Ravana being deceived by Ganesha in disguise, Shiva's manifestation as Bhagirath, descending Ganga, carved around the hill.\nThe temple is entirely modernised with the exception of the sanctum sanctorum which is still dark and retains its composure. The main deity is Sri Mridesa Linga, also called Murudeshwara. The linga is believed to be a piece of the original Atma Linga and is about two feet below ground level. The devotees performing special sevas like Abhisheka, Rudrabhisheka, Rathotsava, etc., can view the deity by standing before the threshold of the sanctum, and the Linga is illuminated by oil lamps held close by the priests. The Linga is essentially a rough rock inside a hollowed spot in the ground. Entry into the sanctum is banned for all devotees.\nA huge towering statue of Shiva, visible from great distances, is present in the temple complex. It is the third tallest statue of Shiva in the world after Statue of Belief and Kailashnath Mahadev Statue. The statue is  in height and took about two years to build. The statue was built by Shivamogga's Kashinath and several other sculptors, financed by businessman and philanthropist R. N. Shetty, at a cost of approximately 50&nbsp;million. The idol is designed such that it gets the sunlight directly and thus appears sparkling.\nFile:Lord Shiva the tallest statue @ Murudeswar.jpg|Lord Shiva the tallest statue at Murudeswar\nFile:Tower of Murudeswar.jpg|Tower of Murudeswar\nFile:Murudeshwar temple from beach.jpg|Murudeshwar temple from beach\nFile:Murudeshwar Full view.jpg|Murudeshwara full view\nFile:Lord Shiva statue at Murudeshwara.jpg|Shiva statue at Murudeshwara\nFile:Murudeshwar shiva.JPG|Statue of Shiva\nFile:Murudeshwar Temple Shiva.jpg|Shiva statue\nFile:Statue of Nandi at Murudeshwar Temple.jpg|Statue of Nandi at Murudeshwara Temple\nFile:Murdeshwar temple gopuram.jpg|Gopura of Murudeshwara Temple\nFile:Murudeshwara Temple.JPG|Shikhara of Murudeshwara Temple\nFile:Karwar Pictures - Yogesa 08.JPG|Murudeshwara beach with boats and jet skis\nSee also\n*Sirsi\n*Sirsi Marikamba Temple\n*Yana, India\n*Chitrapur Math\n*Gokarna\n*Idagunji\n*Maravanthe\nReferences\nExternal links\n}}"
