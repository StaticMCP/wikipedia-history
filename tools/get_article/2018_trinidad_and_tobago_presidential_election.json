As Weekes was the only nominated candidate on election day, she was deemed elected without the need for a vote. Paula-Mae Weeks thus became the first woman to take office as president of Trinidad and Tobago on 19 March 2018.\nElectoral method\nThe President of Trinidad and Tobago is indirectly elected for a 5-year term by an electoral college comprising all 41 members of the House of Representatives and all 31 members of the Senate.\nTo win the election a candidate must gain a plurality of votes cast, whereby a quorum comprising the Speaker of the House of Representatives, 10 Senators and 12 other member of the House of Representatives must be met for the election to be considered valid. If only one candidate should be nominated to run in the election, he or she shall be considered to have been elected president without the need for a vote to take place.\nCandidates\nNominated by the Government\n*Paula-Mae Weekes, Judge of the Turks and Caicos Islands Court of Appeals\nElectoral College\nPartisan make-up of the Electoral College\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
