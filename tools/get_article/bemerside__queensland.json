In the , Bemerside had a population of 259 people.\nGeography\nBemerside is bounded to the north-east and by the Seymour River, to the south-east by the Anabranch River, to the south by the Herbert River and Ripple Creek. The Anabranch River is a tidal stream that connects the Seymour River to the Herbert River.\nBemerside has the following mountains along its eastern boundary (from north to south):\n* Mount Cudmore ()\n* Mount Separation ()\n* Mount Maragen ()\nThe Girringun National Park is in the north of the locality, extending into the neighbouring localities of Rungoo and Hawkins Creek.\nThe Bruce Highway enters the locality from the south (Gairloch) and exits to the north (Rungoo).\nThe North Coast railway line enters the locality from the south (Foresthome) and exits to the north (Rungoo) with the locality served by two railway stations (from north to south):\n* Hinchinbrook railway station ()\n* Bemerside railway station, now abandoned ()\nRipple Creek is a neighbourhood () in the south of the locality.

Most of the flat land is used to grow sugarcane. There is a cane tramway network to transport the harvested sugarcane to the Macknade sugar mill in neighbouring Macknade for crushing.\nHistory\nThe locality takes its name from the Bemerside Sugar Mill, established in 1873 and named after the town of Bermersyde (note the different spelling) in Scotland, which was associated with the Haig family who originally owned the sugar mill in conjunction with the Miles family.\nRipple Creek Provisional school opened on 19 June 1893. On 1 June 1909, it became Ripple Creek State School. In 1931 and 1932 there were temporary closures. It closed permanently on 16 December 1995. It was on Fulton Drive ().\nIn February 2025 an 82-year-old woman died as a result of prolonged flooding in the region.\nDemographics\nIn the , Bemerside had a population of 241 people.\nIn the , Bemerside had a population of 259 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Bemerside.
