After Lula was declared ineligible to contest the election, PROS supported Haddad and his running mate Manuela d'Ávila as part of the alliance \"The People Happy Again,\" remaining allied with PT and PCdoB.\nIn the 2022 Brazilian general election, PROS allied with the Brazil of Hope coalition, with the main members being Workers Party, the Communist Party of Brazil, PSOL REDE Federation, and the Brazilian Socialist Party to support the pre-candidacy of former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and former Governor of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin as part of the alliance \"Let's go together for Brazil\".\nFollowing the elections, the party announced plans to merge with Solidarity. The Superior Electoral Court approved the merger on February 14, 2023.\nElectoral results\nPresidential elections\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-----\n! align=\"center\" | Year\n! align=\"center\" | Candidate\n! align=\"center\" | Votes\n! align=\"center\" | %\n|-----\n| 2014\n| colspan=\"3\" | No candidate, endorsed Dilma Rousseff\n|-----\n|-----\n| 2018\n| colspan=\"3\" | No candidate, endorsed Fernando Haddad\n|-----\n| 2022\n| colspan=\"3\" | No candidate, endorsed Lula da Silva\n|-----\n|}\nLegislative elections\n{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Election\n!colspan=\"4\"|Chamber of Deputies\n!colspan=\"4\"|Federal Senate\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Role in government\n|-\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n!+/–\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n!+/–\n|-\n!2014\n|align=\"center\"|1,977,117\n|align=\"center\"|2.03%\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|}}\n|New\n|align=\"center\"|2,234,132\n|align=\"center\"|2.50%\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|}}\n|New\n|\n|-\n!2018\n|align=\"center\"|2,042,610\n|align=\"center\"|2.08%\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|}}\n| 3\n|align=\"center\"|1,370,513\n|align=\"center\"|0.80%\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|}}\n| 0\n|\n|-\n!2022\n|align=\"center\"|1,070,953\n|align=\"center\"|0.97%\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|}}\n| 5\n|align=\"center\"|214,525\n|align=\"center\"|0.21%\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|}}\n| 0\n|\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
