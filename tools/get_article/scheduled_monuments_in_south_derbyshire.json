Scheduled monuments are defined in the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 and the National Heritage Act 1983. There are about 20,000 scheduled monument entries on the list, which is maintained by English Heritage; more than one site can be included in a single entry.\nWhile a scheduled monument can also be recognised as a listed building, English Heritage considers listed building status as a better way of protecting buildings than scheduled monument status. If a monument is considered by English Heritage to \"no longer merit scheduling\" it can be rescheduled.\nDerbyshire has over 500 scheduled monuments including many stone cairns, stone circles, barrow burial mounds, lead mining relics, ancient settlements, and over 20 bridges.\nList\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Image\n!Name and reference\n!Feature\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n|\n|Barton Blount medieval settlement remains\n|Settlement\n|Barton Blount\n|Including a chapel, decoy pond and part of the open field system. 340m North of Barton Hall.\n|-\n|\n|Bretby Castle fortified manor\n|Castle\n|Bretby\n|Remains of manor house buildings from the 13th to 17th century with bank and ditch defences.\n|-\n|\n|Calke Park Tunnel\n|Tunnel\n|Ticknall\n|\n|-\n|\n|Castle Gresley motte and bailey castle\n|Castle\n|Castle Gresley\n|\n|-\n|\n|Dovecote\n|Dovecote\n|Netherseal\n|85m south of Netherseal Old Hall.
