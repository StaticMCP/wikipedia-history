Historically, the United States was consistently year after year the world's largest economy since the early twentieth century. However, the report from 2014 showed that for the very first time China overtook the United States as the largest economy in the world taking into account purchasing power parity (PPP). Indeed, the margin of power between nations had generally widened and then lessened over time, and over the last fifty years the world has seen the rapid rise and fall in relative terms of the economies of other countries.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Historical list of the world's ten largest economies by GDP (PPP) (billions USD) (World Bank)\n!Year\n!2015\n!2010\n!2005\n!2000\n!1995\n!1990\n|-\n!World\n|113,612.52\n|87,771.66\n|64,415.31\n|47,453.19\n|36,104.40\n|28,249.60\n|-\n!Top 10\n|68,997.53\n|52,354.88\n|38,551.92\n|28,608.96\n|21,680.22\n|17,073.82\n|-\n!1st\n|19,524.35\n|14,964.40\n|13,095.40\n|10,289.70\n|7,664.00\n|5,979.60\n|-\n!2nd\n|17,947.00\n|12,097.93\n|6,470.18\n|3,616.33\n|2,878.16\n|2,377.97\n|-\n!3rd\n|8,003.40\n|5,478.71\n|3,889.58\n|3,289.80\n|2,151.44\n|1,885.97\n|-\n!4th\n|5,546.56\n|4,322.67\n|3,343.43\n|2,150.17\n|1,834.80\n|1,472.12\n|-\n!5th\n|3,848.27\n|3,234.90\n|2,566.00\n|2,119.99\n|1,474.18\n|1,142.67\n|-\n!6th\n|3,579.83\n|2,924.79\n|2,006.91\n|1,553.96\n|1,271.43\n|1,020.02\n|-\n!7th\n|3,192.40\n|2,685.98\n|1,965.60\n|1,534.81\n|1,204.87\n|1,002.53\n|-\n!8th\n|2,842.24\n|2,332.57\n|1,860.70\n|1,525.28\n|1,201.81\n|1,001.12\n|-\n!9th\n|2,691.81\n|2,254.82\n|1,696.73\n|1,468.18\n|1,166.04\n|969.02\n|-\n!10th\n|2,650.82\n|2,058.11\n|1,657.40\n|1,060.75\n|833.47\n|919.32\n|}\nAngus Maddison statistics\nThis historical list of the ten largest countries by GDP compiled by British economist Angus Maddison shows how much the membership and rankings of the world's ten largest economies has changed.

It accounted for 1.8% of the world's economy in 1820, 8.9% in 1870, and 18.9% in 1913. As of 2025, the United States accounts for approximately 26.8%  of global GDP (nominal) and 14.7% of global GDP (PPP), as per IMF estimates.\nChina represented 1.61% of the world's economy in 1987 (lowest point), rising to 18% (nominal) and 19% (PPP) in 2022. It accounted for 25.4% of global GDP in 1 CE, 29% of world global output in 1600 CE, 17.3% of the world's economy in 1870, and 33% in 1820 (its highest point). China's share of global GDP varied from a quarter to a third of global output until the late 19th century. As of 2025, China accounts for approximately 17%  of global GDP (nominal) and 19.7% of global GDP (PPP), as per IMF estimates.\nAs of 2025, the EU accounts for approximately 17.6% of global GDP (nominal) and 14% of global GDP (PPP), as per IMF estimates.\nThe gross domestic product of India was estimated at 24.4% of the world's economy in 1500, 22.4% in 1600, 16% in 1820, and 12.1% in 1870. India's share of global GDP declined to less than 2% of global GDP by the time of its independence in 1947, and only rose gradually after the liberalization of its economy beginning in the 1990s. As of 2025, India accounts for approximately 3.7%  of global GDP (nominal) and 8.5% of global GDP (PPP), as per IMF estimates.\nNotes\nReferences"
