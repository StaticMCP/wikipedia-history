The name was derived from the hill now located within the locality.  Its coastline with Spencer Gulf includes at its northern end, an inlet known as Mundoora Arm and a channel known as Hamilton Lagoons.\nAs of 2015, land within the locality was zoned for agriculture, while a strip of land along its coastline was zoned for conservation.\nWard Hill is located within the federal division of Grey, the state electoral district of Narungga, and the local government area of the District Council of Barunga West.\nReferences"
