He was the former abbot of Wat Chong Khae in Nakhon Sawan Province. Known for his tall stature, calm demeanor, decisiveness, sense of justice, and reputed spiritual power, he became one of the most respected meditation masters of his era.\nBiography\nLuang Phor Phrom was born on 20 April 1884 during the reign of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) in the village of Kong Nu, Ban Phraek Subdistrict, Maha Rat District, Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province. He was ordained as a monk at Wat Pak Khlong Yang on 15 April 1904 with the monastic name Thawaro.\nBefore ordination, he studied sacred incantations and ancient magic from a lay teacher named Ajahn Phuang. After ordination, Ajahn Phuang introduced him to Luang Phor Dam, under whom he practiced asubha-kammatthana (contemplation on the loathsome) and vipassana meditation in the Khmer tradition for four years. Later, he continued his training under Ajahn Phu Won, a lay teacher from Wang Daeng Village, Tha Ruea District, where he learned various other disciplines.\nWhile spending the rains retreat at Wat Khian Lai, he was known for his exemplary discipline and ascetic practice. During one of his pilgrimages (dhutanga), he arrived at the mountains of Chong Khae and took shelter in a cave during a storm. On his first night, he reportedly had a vision of celestial beings who guided him in advanced meditation practices. Feeling grateful, he decided to remain there and eventually returned to sell his inherited farmland to fund the purchase of land for building a temple — which became Wat Chong Khae.\nHe served as abbot of Wat Chong Khae from 1917 to 1971, a total of 54 years, before resigning and appointing Phra Palad Baeng Thammavaro as his successor. Luang Phor Phrom died on 30 January 1975 during the reign of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, aged 90 with 70 vassa (rain retreats). His body was said to remain undecayed, with hair, nails, and beard continuing to grow after death.\nReferences"
