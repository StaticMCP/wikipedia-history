The oldest included the Metal Workers' Union, the Independent Media Union, and the Teachers' Union.\nThe federation was opposed to Slobodan Milosevic, and was persecuted under his presidency.  It led major strike in 1998, then moved towards political action.  It formed part of the opposition Yugoslav Action Group, with various other civic groups.  When Milosevic initially refused to accept defeat in the 2000 Yugoslavian general election, it backed strikes which played a part in forcing him out.\nBy 2005, the federation claimed a total of 180,000 members.\nExternal links\n*\nReferences"
