In 2004, the foundation brought eight people from Israel and the Palestinian territories together in a month-long sailing and mountain climbing expedition to Antarctica. Their journey to break the ice received the support and public endorsements of Nobel Peace Prize Laureates the Dalai Lama, Shimon Peres, Mikhail Gorbachev, Kofi Annan, and many more. Furthermore, their journey also received worldwide media coverage on channels like CNN, BBC, etc. as well as international newspapers. More than 553 million people in 59 countries and 25 languages followed the story of Breaking the Ice.\nBreaking the Ice is currently planning its next \"peace mission\" for March 2006\nThe team\nMen and women - Jews, Christians and Muslims - from Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Israel, Lebanon, the Palestinian territories and the United States will join in mind, body and spirit to cross the Sahara Desert and the territories of five countries and cultures. The identities of the team will be disclosed shortly before the journey begins.\nThe route\nSetting off on March 1, 2006, the team will embark on a three-week journey from Jerusalem to Tripoli, crossing one of the harshest terrains on the planet.\nThe challenge\nThe diverse team members will confront physical and spiritual terrain that has witnessed conflict throughout the centuries. Testing themselves against the challenges of their surroundings and their own conflicting relationships, they can only succeed if they rely on and trust one another.\nNews coverage\nA news broadcasting team will accompany the journey and transmit daily coverage to international TV, print media, radio and the Internet.\nDocumentary\nA film production crew will film the journey.
