It was founded in 1881 or 1882.\nHistory\nThe Phoenix as a symbol has deep roots in Swarthmore lore. When the College's iconic Parrish Hall was gutted by fire in 1881, it was immediately rebuilt, symbolically rising from the ashes like the bird found in Egyptian and Greek mythology. Soon after, The Phoenix was established as the campus newspaper of Swarthmore College, publishing its first issue on December 1, 1881.\nWith an early staff that often numbered fewer than 10, The Phoenix was first published monthly, then moved to a bi-weekly schedule in 1894; it is now published weekly with a staff of more than 40 editors, reporters, and columnists.  The Phoenix first appeared online in September 1995.\nIn the Fall of 2018 the Phoenix merged with The Daily Gazette, a daily email-based publication at Swarthmore, consolidating both newspapers into one website.\nNotable coverage\nIn 2019, documents leaked by The Phoenix helped lead to the disbanding of Greek life at Swarthmore.\nAwards and Commendations\nOnline Pacemaker Winner 2010, 2011.\nRanked fifth in disability coverage among liberal arts college newspapers in 2023.\nAlumni\n*William C.
