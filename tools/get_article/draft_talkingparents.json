You can give a brief overview of what it does, but listing all the features is not encyclopedic. That is something for the company website. 2) Remove \"company awards\" section. Unless the awards are notable for Wikipedia (Grammy, Emmy, etc.), it is just the company bragging. Likely well-deserved, but not encyclopedic. 3) (and I will do this for you) Re-order the headings to comply with manual of style.
