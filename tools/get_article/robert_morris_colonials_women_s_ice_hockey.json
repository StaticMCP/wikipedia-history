On December 17, 2021, it was announced both programs would be reinstated for the 2023–24 season. Shortly after that season, the Atlantic Hockey Association and College Hockey America, respectively home to the Colonials men's and women's teams, merged to form Atlantic Hockey America.\nHistory\nMarch 31, 2004:  Robert Morris University announced that an NCAA Division I women's ice hockey team would compete, in the College Hockey America (CHA) Conference, starting with the 2005–06 season.\nKevin McGonagle was named the first head coach, but following a 1–7–0 start he was dismissed[2]. Assistant coach Jody Katz[1] was named the interim head coach for the rest of the season, and men's assistant coach Nate Handrahan was named new head coach for the 2006–07 campaign.\nNate Handrahan was head coach for five years from the 2006–07 through the 2010–11 seasons.  He successfully built a stable program, bringing talented players into the program who would excel after his tenure. and amassed a 52–111–14 record, before taking the head coaching job of the Ohio State women's hockey program.\nPaul Colontino was named head coach for the 2011–12 season, and remains in the position. He made the Colonials a competitive team, finishing with more wins than losses in 5 of 6 years.  In his first year, Colontino led the Colonials to their first CHA Tournament championship.  As the CHA had not automatic berth in the NCAA tournament at the time, their CHA win ended their season.\nThe most successful season for the Colonials was the 2016–17 season. Their 24–5–6 record (15–3–2 in the CHA) earned them their first year-ending ranking, 8th, in both the USCHO and USA Today polls.  They won the CHA regular season championship for the first time, and took the Tournament Championship as well, to earn their first entry to the NCAA national championship.  They were defeated by top ranked Wisconsin 0–7 in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Colonials forward Jaycee Gebhard scored 44 points on the season, making her the highest scoring first year player in the country for the season. Brittany Howard became the first Colonial player to be named CHA Player of the Year.\nThe Colonials went on to finish at the top of the CHA standings in 2017-18 and 2018–19, marking three years in a row that they won the regular season championship. They went to four straight championship games, ending the season as conference runner up in 2018, 2019 and 2020.\nOver the course of four seasons (2016–20), the Colonials posted an overall record of 62-22-12 (.777 points percentage), including the program's first ever NCAA Tournament appearance in 2017. The program qualified for the 2021 NCAA National Collegiate Women's Ice Hockey Tournament, ranked as the #8 seed.\nOn February 3, 2022 Logan Bittle was named the head coach for the program's return in the 2023-2024 season\nYear by year\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|bgcolor=\"#ffeeaa\"|Won Championship\n|bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\"|Lost Championship\n|bgcolor=\"#d0e7ff\"|Conference
