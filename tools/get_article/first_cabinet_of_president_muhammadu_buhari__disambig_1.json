Most ministers were sworn in on 11 November 2015 and the cabinet was dissolved on 28 May 2019, the day before Buhari's second inauguration.\nFormation\nIn an interview published by Vanguard on 19 April 2015, Buhari, whose administration was to begin on 29 May 2015, said he would assemble a small cabinet that might be active before the official ceremony. On 31 May 2015 Buhari was reported to have said he would break with the People's Democratic Party (PDP) tradition where ministers were nominated by governors.}} He would look for people who were competent, dedicated and experienced. On 1 July 2015 a spokesman for the president said that Buhari would delay selecting a cabinet until September. He wanted to eliminate prior corruption before the new ministers were appointed. Another spokesman said that the delay was \"nothing out of the ordinary\" compared to the formation of previous cabinets. However, a London-based economist said the delay would not be well received by investors.\nOn the night of 30 September, TheCable, an online newspaper in Nigeria, reported a list of 21 names submitted to Senate President Bukola Saraki for screening and confirmation. On 11 November, a cabinet of 36 ministers from each of the 36 states of Nigeria was sworn in.\nCabinet of Nigeria\n| minister1_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister1_termstart   = 29 May 2015\n| minister1_termend     = 29 May 2019\n}}\n}}(suspended 19 April 2017)}}\n| minister2             = Habibat Lawal (acting)\n| minister2_party       = N/A\n| minister2_termstart   = 19 April 2017\n| minister2_termend     = 1 November 2017\n| minister3             = Boss Mustapha\n| minister3_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister3_termstart   = 1 November 2017\n| minister3_termend     = 28 May 2019\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n| minister2             = Ibrahim Usman Jibril\n| minister2_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister2_termstart   = 15 December 2016\n| minister2_termend     = 12 December 2018\n| minister3             = Suleiman Hassan Zarma\n| minister3_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister3_termstart   = 13 December 2018\n| minister3_termend     = 28 May 2019\n}}\n| minister1_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister1_termstart   = 11 November 2015\n| minister1_termend     = 12 December 2018}}\n}}\n}}\n| minister1_party      = All Progressives Congress\n| minister1_termstart   = 11 November 2015\n| minister1_termend     = 14 September 2018}}\n| minister2             = Zainab Ahmed\n| minister2_party       = N/A\n| minister2_termstart   = 14 September 2018\n| minister2_termend     = 28 May 2019\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n| minister2             = Stephen Ocheni\n| minister2_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister2_termstart   = 16 August 2017\n| minister2_termend     = 28 May 2019\n}}\n}}\n| minister2             = Abubakar Bawa Bwari\n| minister2_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister2_termstart   = 30 May 2018\n| minister2_termend     = 28 May 2019\n}}\n| minister1_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister1_termstart   = 11 November 2015\n| minister1_termend     = 28 May 2019\n}}\n}}\n| minister1_party       = All Progressives Congress\n| minister1_termstart   = 11 November 2015\n| minister1_termend     = 28 May 2019\n}}\n}}\n| minister2             = Aisha Abubakar\n| minister2_party       = N/A\n| minister2_termstart   = 30 September 2018\n| minister2_termend     = 28 May 2019\n}}\n}}}}\n|}\nSee also\n*Cabinet of Nigeria\n*Federal government of Nigeria\nNotes\nReferences"
