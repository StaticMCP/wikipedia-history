The company was the major theatrical enterprise of its era and featured some of the leading actors of their generation – Richard Burbage, John Lowin, and Joseph Taylor among other – and some leading clowns and comedians, like Will Kempe and Robert Armin. The company benefitted from the services of William Shakespeare, John Fletcher, and Philip Massinger as regular dramatists.\nThe actors who performed the plays have left the most evidence of their lives and activities; but they were supported by musicians and other functionaries, and were enabled by managers and financial backers like Cuthbert Burbage.\nFor more information on specific individuals, see individual entries: Robert Armin, Christopher Beeston, Robert Benfield, etc.\nTerms\n* \"Sharer\" – an actor who was a partner in the company and so received a share of the profits, as opposed to a simple \"hired man\" who earned a wage.\n* A \"householder\" or \"housekeeper\" was an investor and sharer in one (or both) of the two theatres used by the troupe, the Globe and the Blackfriars. (The term \"lessee\" is also used, since the Globe was built on leased land and the Blackfriars facility was also leased. Partners in the theatres were partners in the leases.) The two theatres were organized separately from the acting company; actors could rise to be \"sharers\" in the company without being householders in the theatres, and some householders were not actors.\n*  \"Necessary attendant\" refers to the hired men on Sir Henry Herbert's list (dated 27 December 1624) of 24 \"musicians and other necessary attendants\" of the King's Men who could not be arrested or \"pressed for soldiers\" without the consent of the Master of the Revels or the Lord Chamberlain.\n* \"Principal actor\" – The First Folio provided a list of 26 \"principal actors\" in Shakespeare's plays, down to 1623. The list includes only sharers in the company, and omits hired men.\n* S.D.S. – The Seven Deadly Sins, probably by Richard Tarlton. A production c. 1591 involved a group of players who would later go on to form the Lord Chamberlain's Men.\nAfter 1642\nTwice in 1648, in January and December, different groups of former King's Men tried to re-activate the troupe, despite the formal prohibition on play-acting by the Commonwealth regime. The January endeavor involved Benfield, Bird, Clark, Hammerton, Lowin, Pollard, and Robinson (all of whom signed the dedication to the first Beaumont and Fletcher folio in 1647, along with Allen, Swanston, and Taylor). The December effort was by Baxter, Blagden, Burt, Clun, Cox, Hall, Kettleby, Loveday, and Charles and William Hart. Neither effort was successful, though groups of King's Men personnel were arrested at least twice in 1648 and 1649 for clandestine acting.\nWhen the King's Company was formed in 1660, the troupe included Loveday, Clun, Burt, Blagden, Bird, Baxter, and Charles Hart.\nPersonnel\n* John Adson – musician (cornet). He played a ghost \"with a brace of greyhounds\" in The Late Lancashire Witches in 1634. He married Jane Balls, sister of Richard Balls.\n* William Allen – actor and sharer.

He was one of ten men who tried to re-activate the King's Men in December 1648.

He died in the later year.\n* John Heminges – principal actor.\n* Thomasine Heminges Ostler – daughter of John Heminges and wife of William Ostler, she should have become a householder in both theatres upon her husband's death in December 1614.
