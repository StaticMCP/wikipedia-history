In the United Kingdom a recession is generally defined as two successive quarters of negative economic growth, as measured by the seasonally adjusted quarter-on-quarter figures for real GDP.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! width=\"100\" class=\"unsortable\" |Name\n! width=\"45\" |Dates\n!width=\"50\"|Duration\n!width=\"70\"|Real GDP reduction\n!class=\"unsortable\" width=25%|Causes\n!class=\"unsortable\" width=45%|Other data\n|-\n| Great Slump || c. 1430 – c. 1490 || c. 60 years || ||Economic blockades during the Hundred Years' War and the Great Bullion Famine||\n|-\n|War of the Spanish Succession\n|1706\n|\n| −15%\n|War of the Spanish Succession compounded by failure of harvest\n|\n|-\n|The Great Frost\n|1709\n|3 months\n| −14%\n|Failure of harvest caused by the Great Frost\n|\n|-\n|Crisis of 1772\n|1772\n|\n|\n|Great Bengal famine of 1770\n|\n|-\n| Post-Napoleonic Depression ||1812–1821||c. 9 years|| ||Post-Napoleonic Wars readjustment||\n|-\n| 1857–58 recession ||1857–58||c. 1 year|| c. 1% ||Panic of 1857 (originating in America) as the first global economic crisis, confidence eroded by Palmerston government relaxing the provisions of the Bank Charter Act 1844||Comparatively brief contraction of approximately 3.5% nominal GDP?\n|-\n| 1867–1869 recession ||1867–1869||c. 2 years|| c. 1% ||Impact on exports resulting from American recession post-American Civil War||1.9%}}||The end of World War I||Deflation c. 10% in 1921, and c. 14% in 1922.\n|-\n| Great Depression||1930–31||c. 2 years|||| US Depression.

There were two single-quarterly setbacks during the recovery (aside from the double-dip) in 1974 Q4 and 1976 Q2. Average inflation was 9.2% in 1973, 16.0% in 1974, 24.2% in 1975 and 16.5% in 1976. Interest rates fluctuated wildly during the recession with a low of 9.0% in March 1976 and a high of 15.0% in October 1976.\n|-\n|| ||0.5 years(2 Qtrs)||\n|-\n| Early 1980s recession ||||1.25 years(5 Qtr)|| ||Deflationary government policies including spending cuts, pursuance of monetarism to reduce inflation, switch from a manufacturing economy to a services economy. || Company earnings decline 35%. Unemployment rises from 5.3% of the working population in August 1979 to 11.9% in 1984. Took thirteen quarters for GDP to recover to its pre-recession peak at the end of 1979. Annual inflation was 18.0% in 1980, 11.9% in 1981, 8.6% in 1982 and 4.6% in 1983. Interest rates generally declined during the recession from a peak of 17.0% at the beginning of 1980 to a low of 9.6% in October 1982.\n|-\n| Early 1990s recession ||||1.25 years(5 Qtrs)|| || US savings and loan crisis, high bank rate in response to rising inflation caused by the Lawson Boom and to maintain British membership of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. || Company earnings decline 25%. Peak budget deficit c. 8% of GDP. Unemployment rises from 6.9% of the working population in 1990 to 10.7% in 1993. Took eleven quarters for GDP to recover to its pre-recession peak in the Spring of 1990. Annual inflation was 9.5% in 1990, 5.9% in 1991, 3.7% in 1992. and 1.6% in 1993. Interest rates were stubbornly high initially but declined from a high of 14.8% at the start of the recession to a low of 5.9% by the end of the recession, though interest rates were hiked twice during Black Wednesday.\n|-\n| Great Recession |||| 1.25 years(5 Qtrs)||  ||2008 financial crisis, rising global commodity prices, subprime mortgage crisis infiltrating the British banking sector, significant credit crunch. || The recession lasted for five quarters and was the deepest UK recession since the Second World War. Manufacturing output declined 7% by end 2008. It affected many sectors including banks and investment firms, with many well known and established businesses having to fold. The unemployment rate rose to 8.3% (2.68m people) in August 2011, the highest level since 1994. There was much speculation of a 'double dip' recession during the 2010s, but this proved not to be the case. However, the 2010s saw four separate periods of quarter-on-quarter fall in growth: 2010 Q4 (−0.4); 2011 Q4 (−0.1); 2012 Q2 (−0.5); and 2012 Q4 (−0.2).\n|-\n| COVID-19 recession ||  || 0.5 years(2 Qtrs) ||  || COVID-19 pandemic || Majority of the decrease in GDP occurred in March and April 2020 and was followed by a sharp increase in June and July although GDP did not return to pre-pandemic levels until late 2021. The drop, while brief, was the deepest recession since 1709. The event triggered an inflationary shock and a wider cost of living crisis.\n|-\n| 2023 recession|| || 0.5 years(2 Qtrs) ||  || A rise in economically inactive people in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, attributed to long term sickness levels, and a decline in school attendance which may also be driven by sickness rates.\n|GDP per capita began to fall in Q2 2022, the longest run of falls or stagnation by that metric since 1955. By February 2024 GDP per capita had shrunk by 4.2% compared to its pre- cost of living crisis peak. The growth in population from record-high immigration had offset this decline in the overall GDP statistics in 2022 and early 2023.\n|}\nSee also\n* List of recessions in Canada\n* List of recessions in the United States\n* Stock market crashes in India\n* List of stock market crashes and bear markets\n* Office for National Statistics\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.ons.gov.uk Office for National Statistics website]\n*[http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/naa2/quarterly-national-accounts/q2-2013/tsd-quarterly-national-accounts--q2-2013.html ONS quarterly GDP growth]\n*[http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/taxonomy/index.html?nscl=National+Income%2C+Expenditure+and+Output UK National Income, Expenditure and Output]\n*[http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/inflationreport/irlatest.htm Latest Bank of England inflation report (PDF sections) ]\n*[http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/inflationreport/ir09feb.pdf Bank of England February 2009 Quarterly inflation report ]  – Much data, including (on p20) previous 3 UK recessions.\n*[https://www.saul-eslake.com/difference-recession-depression/ \"What is the difference between a recession and a depression?\" Saul Eslake November 2008]\n*[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10613201 UK economy tracker]  BBC News – comparison of UK recessions – updated quarterly"
