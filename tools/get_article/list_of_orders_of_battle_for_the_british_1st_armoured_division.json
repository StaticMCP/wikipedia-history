It can provide information on the strength of that formation and the equipment used. An order of battle is not necessarily a set structure and it can change depending on tactical or strategic developments or the evolution of military doctrine. For example, a division could be radically altered from one campaign to another through the adding or removing of sub-units but retain its identity and history. The size of a division can dramatically vary as a result of the forces assigned and the doctrine employed at that time.\nThe 1st Armoured Division of the British Army was formed in 1937 as the Mobile Division and renamed the 1st Armoured Division in April 1939. The division was dispatched with 257 tanks to fight in the Battle of France. After several costly engagements and the collapse of the Allied effort, it was forced to retreat back to the UK with only 13 remaining tanks. In late 1941, the division was sent to reinforce the British effort in North Africa with 184 tanks. It then fought in all the major engagements of the Western Desert campaign during 1942 from defeat in the Battle of Gazala to victory in the Second Battle of El Alamein. It assisted in the chase of the Axis powers across North Africa into Tunisia, culminating with the Axis' overall defeat on the continent. In the aftermath of the Tunisian campaign, the division remained in Africa until 1944, when it was transferred to Italy. Its final battles were against the German Gothic Line during the Italian campaign. The division was broken up in October 1944 to provide reinforcements for other active formations due to a personnel shortage in the British Army, and officially disbanded in early 1945.\nBackground\nThe Mobile Division was formed in November 1937, and renamed the 1st Armoured Division in April 1939. Prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, doctrine called for such a division to be composed of two armoured brigades—each with three armoured regiments—and a support group. The support group included all required supporting arms the division would need: infantry, engineers, artillery, and anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns. At full strength, the support group would have sixteen 25-pounder field gun-howitzers, twenty-four 2-pounder anti-tank gun, and twenty-four Bofors  anti-aircraft guns. On paper, the division would contain 108 light tanks, 159 light cruisers, 58 heavy cruisers, and 24 close-support tanks, and have 9,442 personnel. This basic organisation changed on numerous occasions during the war, although the actual implementation could be delayed due to several factors.\nBritish forces defined light tanks as reconnaissance vehicles, which were armed with machine guns. Cruiser tanks were swiftly moving, more heavily armoured, and equipped with machine guns and an anti-tank gun. The cruiser tank's role was to engage and destroy enemy armoured forces. Its main weapon, a 2-pounder anti-tank gun, was supplied only with armour-piercing rounds, meaning cruiser tanks were ineffective against entrenched infantry or suppressing hostile artillery. The A9 is an example of a light cruiser while the A10 provides an example of a heavy cruiser. The light and heavy definitions arose in 1938, to differentiate between cruisers that were thinly armoured and their better armoured variants (for example, the A9 frontal armour was only  thick compared to the  thickness of the A10). Rather than being fitted with an anti-tank gun, close-support cruiser tanks were  equipped with a howitzer for firing smoke and high-explosive rounds, and were not intended to fight other tanks.\nFrom formation through to the outbreak of the Second World War\nOn formation, in November 1937, the division was headquartered at Andover, Hampshire, on the edge of Salisbury Plain and was assigned to Southern Command. Two of its brigades were located around the plain: the 2nd Cavalry Brigade at Tidworth Camp and the 1st Tank Brigade at Perham Down. While the 1st Cavalry Brigade was technically part of the division, it was located at Aldershot under the command of Aldershot Command until late 1938.\nIt was intended for the division to have 620 armoured fighting vehicles, although did not reach this strength during the early years of its existence. As best they could be, the cavalry regiments were outfitted with the Light Tank Mk VI while the tank brigade contained Vickers Medium Mark IIs. Due to the lack of tanks, trucks were used to simulate their existence for training purposes. It was not until December 1938 that the first delivery of A13 cruiser tanks were made, followed by A9s in January 1939. In April 1939, several nomenclature changes took place. The Mobile Division was renamed the 1st Armoured Division, the cavalry brigades were retitled as light armoured brigades, and the tank brigade became the heavy armoured brigade. Likewise, on 4 April 1939, the Royal Armoured Corps was formed to command all mechanised cavalry and the battalions of the Royal Tank Corps. The latter was renamed the Royal Tank Regiment and its nomenclature colloquially changed; each unit dropped the word battalion from its title, although this was not officially adopted until September 1945.\nNovember 1937– July 1938\n, which the Tank Brigade was equipped with]]\nMobile Division\n1st Cavalry Brigade\n* King's Dragoon Guards\n* 4th Queen's Own Hussars\n* 2nd Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps\n* Mobile Divisional Signals, Royal Corps of Signals\n** HQ, B, C, and D Troops\n* 1st Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery\n** A, B, and I Batterys\n2nd Cavalry Brigade\n* 2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays)\n* 9th Queen's Royal Lancers\n* 1st Battalion, Rifle Brigade\n* Mobile Divisional Signals, Royal Corps of Signals\n** E and F Troops\n1st Tank Brigade\n* 1st Light Battalion, Royal Tank Corps (until about April 1938)\n* 2nd Battalion, Royal Tank Corps\n* 3rd Battalion, Royal Tank Corps\n* 5th Battalion, Royal Tank Corps\nDivisional Troops\n* 12th Lancers (administered by the 2nd Cavalry Brigade)\nAugust 1938–April 1939\nMobile Division\n1st Cavalry Brigade\n* King's Dragoon Guards\n* 3rd Hussars\n* 4th Queen's Own Hussars\n2nd Cavalry Brigade\n* 2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays)\n* 9th Queen's Royal Lancers\n* 10th Hussars\n1st Tank Brigade\n* 2nd Battalion, Royal Tank Corps\n* 3rd Battalion, Royal Tank Corps\n* 5th Battalion, Royal Tank Corps\nDivisional troops\n* Divisional artillery, Royal Artillery\n** 1st Royal Horse Artillery\n** 2nd Royal Horse Artillery\n* Divisional engineers, Royal Engineers\n** 1st Field Park Squadron\n* Royal Army Service Corps\n** 4th (until end of 1938), 10th, 11th (joined January 1939), 23rd (until end of 1938), 27th, 36th (until end of 1938), 55th (joined January 1939), and 62nd Companies\n* Mobile Divisional Signals, Royal Corps of Signals\n* 12th Lancers\n* 2nd Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps\n* 1st Battalion, Rifle Brigade\nApril-September 1939\ntank transporter]]\n1st Armoured Division\n1st Light Armoured Brigade\n* King's Dragoon Guards\n* 3rd Hussars\n* 4th Queen's Own Hussars\n2nd Light Armoured Brigade\n* 2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays)\n* 9th Queen's Royal Lancers\n* 10th Hussars\n1st Heavy Armoured Brigade\n* 2nd Royal Tank Regiment\n* 3rd Royal Tank Regiment\n* 5th Royal Tank Regiment\nDivisional troops\n* Divisional artillery, Royal Artillery\n** 1st Royal Horse Artillery\n** 2nd Royal Horse Artillery\n* Divisional engineers, Royal Engineers\n** 1st Field Park Squadron\n* Royal Army Service Corps\n** 10th, 11th, 27th, 55th, 62nd, and 63rd Companies\n* Mobile Divisional Signals, Royal Corps of Signals\n* 2nd Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps\n* 1st Battalion, Rifle Brigade\nSeptember 1939–April 1940\n, on maneuverers in 1940.]]\n1st Armoured Division\n1st Light Armoured Brigade (until 4 November 1939)\n* King's Dragoon Guards\n* 3rd Hussars\n* 4th Queen's Own Hussars\n2nd Light Armoured Brigade (renamed 2nd Armoured Brigade on 14 April 1940)\n* 2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays)\n* 9th Queen's Royal Lancers\n* 10th Hussars\n1st Heavy Armoured Brigade (renamed 3rd Armoured Brigade on 14 April 1940)\n* 2nd Battalion, Royal Tank Regiment\n* 3rd Battalion, Royal Tank Regiment\n* 5th Battalion, Royal Tank Regiment\n1st Support Group\n* 1st Royal Horse Artillery (until 20 October 1939)\n* 2nd Royal Horse Artillery (until 20 October 1939)\n* 60th Anti-Tank Regiment (joined 22 December 1939, left 14 February 1940)\n* 101st Light Anti-Aircraft/Anti-tank Regiment (joined 15 February 1940)\n* 1st Field Squadron, Royal Engineers (until 31 January 1940)\n* 1st Field Park Troop, Royal Engineers (until 31 January 1940)\n* 1st Battalion, Rifle Brigade (until 24 April 1940)\n* 2nd Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps (until 24 April 1940)\nBattle of France\nFrom the beginning of the Second World War in September 1939, the 1st Armoured Division had been used to provide troops and material for other formations. In October, two regiments of artillery were withdrawn from the support group and dispatched to France. The following month, an armoured brigade was withdrawn to form the 2nd Armoured Division. In January 1940, engineers were removed to serve elsewhere and they were followed by an armoured regiment and the division's infantry in April and May, just prior to the division being deployed to France.\nThese changes left the 1st Armoured Division short of its required subordinate units, although it did contain 114 light and 143 cruiser tanks. It, however, lacked replacement tanks, spare parts, bridging and wireless equipment, and anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns. The advance elements of the division landed in France on 15 May 1940, and the first major components arrived four days later. It took another week until the entire division had been deployed. It fought in a number of engagements, most notably the Battle of Abbeville, and suffered heavy tank losses in its encounters with German forces. By 18 June, with 13 tanks remaining, it completed its evacuation to the UK.\nMay–June 1940\n1st Armoured Division\n2nd Armoured Brigade\n* 2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays)\n* 9th Queen's Royal Lancers\n* 10th Royal Hussars\n* 4th Battalion, Border Regiment (attached for fighting on 24 May)\n3rd Armoured Brigade\n* 2nd Royal Tank Regiment\n* 3rd Royal Tank Regiment (until 22 May 1940)\n* 5th Royal Tank Regiment\n1st Support Group\n* 101st Light Anti-Aircraft/Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery\nDivisional troops\n* 1st Armoured Divisional Signals, Royal Corps of Signals\n* Royal Engineers\n** 1st Field Squadron\nNorth Africa campaign\nDuring 1941, an armoured division was to consist of 340 tanks. Due to ongoing fighting in Egypt and Italian Libya, armoured reinforcements were requested from the UK and the 1st Armoured Division was used to provide these. With 60 M3 Stuart light tanks and 124 Crusader tanks, the division left the UK in August—just before organisational changes to the layout of UK-based armoured divisions were made. The changes, however, were not forced upon divisions serving in Africa. The division arrived in Egypt in mid-November and moved into Italian Libya the following month.\nIn January 1942, after clashes with Axis armoured forces, the division was attacked and forced to retreat to Gazala. On 27 February, a new organisation for North African-based armoured divisions was announced. Each was to include one armoured brigade group consisting of three armoured regiments, one motorised infantry battalion, engineers, anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns, and artillery; as well as one motor brigade group composed of three motorised infantry battalions with the same selection of supporting arms as the armoured brigade. This reorganisation called for the support group to be abolished, which resulted in its units being dispersed to other formations located nearby. Due to the mixture of British and American tanks in use, different organisations for the armoured regiments equipped with both were drawn up. Those with M3 Grants and Stuarts were intended to have 24 of the former and 20 of the latter. Those equipped with a mix of Crusaders and Grants were intended to have 36 of the former and 12 of the latter. These changes had not been implemented by the start of the Battle of Gazala, a few months later. Between the 1st and the 7th Armoured Divisions, there were 167 Grants, 257 Crusaders, and 149 Stuart tanks available for the battle. A breakdown of what each formation had, is not provided by the official history for this period, and the various armoured regiments fought under the banner of each division at various points of the battle. On 12 June, for example, all tanks were placed under the command of the 1st Armoured Division, which then consisted of 206 tanks (83 Grants, 59 Crusaders, and 64 Stuarts). After battling with two German armoured divisions, it ended the day with 50 serviceable tanks; the rest had been either destroyed or sent to workshops to be repaired.\nAfter further fighting, the division retreated from Gazala. It then fought in the Battle of Mersa Matruh, before a further retreat took place to El Alamein. This was followed by the First Battle of El Alamein and heavy tank losses resulted in some regiments being temporarily amalgamated; for example, the 3rd Royal Tank Regiment and the 5th Royal Tank Regiment became the 3rd/5th Royal Tank Regiment until they were eventually rebuilt as separate entities. Tank strength fluctuated due to losses, reinforcements, and other changes. For example, on 15 July, the division had 77 Grants, 82 Crusaders, and 32 Stuarts; on 21 July, 61 Grants, 81 Crusaders, and 31 Stuarts. At the end of the battle, the division was allowed a period of rest. Additional war office guidelines for divisional structure were released on 24 August and maintained most of the ideas laid out in February, although it did abolish brigade groups and changed how supporting arms were used. The change resulted in the armoured brigade containing three armoured regiments and one battalion of infantry, and the motor brigade controlling just infantry. The supporting arms, such as artillery and engineers, became divisional troops rather than assigned to a specific brigade as they had been under the brigade group concept. The 1st Armoured Division was reorganised to conform to these new guidelines and on paper would have 172 tanks. When the division mustered for the Second Battle of El Alamein, it contained slightly fewer: 1 Grant, 92 Shermans, and 68 Crusaders. After the battle concluded in an Allied victory, the division pursued Axis forces across North Africa. It then fought in the Tunisia campaign until May 1943, when Axis forces surrendered in Africa. With the conclusion of the campaign, the division remained in North Africa until 1944.\nInitial desert battles (January–May 1942)\n1st Armoured Division\n2nd Armoured Brigade (2nd Armoured Brigade Group after March)\n* 2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays)\n* 9th Queen's Royal Lancers\n* 10th Royal Hussars\n* 1st Battalion, Rifle Brigade\n* 11th Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery (from March)\n* 44th Light Anti-Aircraft Battery, Royal Artillery (from March)\n* 88th Light Anti-Aircraft Battery, Royal Artillery (from March)\n* No. 1 Troop, 7th Field Squadron, Royal Engineers (until 19 March)\n* No. 3 Troop, 1st Field Squadron, Royal Engineers (from 19 March)\n* 1st Light Field Ambulance, Royal Army Medical Corps (from March)\n* A and B Companies, Royal Army Service Corps (from March)\n22nd Armoured Brigade Group (from 23 April)\n* Royal Gloucestershire Hussars\n* 3rd County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters)\n* 4th County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters)\n* 107th Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery\n* 13th/7th Field Squadron, Royal Engineers\n* 2nd Light Field Ambulance, Royal Army Medical Corps\n* 67th and 432nd Companies, Royal Army Service Corps\n1st Support Group (until 11 February 1942, when dispersed)\n* 11th Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery (until 29 January)\n* 2nd Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery (from 31 January)\n* 61st Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment (until 26 January)\n* 82nd Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment (from 26 January)\n* 76th Anti-Tank Regiment (until 29 January)\n* 102nd (Northumberland Hussars) Anti-Tank Regiment (from 29 January)\n* 2nd Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps\n200th Guards Brigade Group (from 12 February 1942.

at which point its main formation was the 2nd Armoured Brigade. Landings in Italy were completed by 14 June and over the next two months, the division was brought up to strength. By this point, a full-strength armoured division was to have 14,964 personnel, 4,267 vehicles including 366 tanks, 48 pieces of artillery, 54 anti-tank guns, and 24 tank destroyers. The division was allocated two infantry brigades due to the need for additional infantry support considering the fighting conditions in Italy. Initially, the 66th Infantry Brigade was assigned but was switched with the 18th Infantry Brigade before the division went into combat. This brigade had earlier fought together with the division, when it was named the 7th Motor Brigade. The second infantry formation was the 43rd Gurkha Lorried Infantry Brigade. By the start of combat operations, the division had around 140 tanks.  Between late August and the end of September, the several engagements were fought as part of the Allied assault on the German Gothic Line and nearly 2,000 casualties was suffered by the division.\nBy mid-1944, the British Army was in the midst of a personnel crisis; it did not have enough men to replace casualties suffered by front line infantry. In the Italian theatre, the army needed to find at least 21,000 reinforcements. To address this, the War Office started to transfer men from the Royal Artillery and the Royal Air Force to infantry training depots. This did not solve the shortage, so the decision was made to disband divisions and transfer personnel in order to keep a fewer number of combat formations as close to full strength as possible. The 1st Armoured Division was chosen to be disbanded as part of this effort. The 43rd Gurkha Lorried Infantry Brigade was transferred to the 56th (London) Infantry Division to strengthen it. The divisional troops and the 18th Infantry Brigade were broken-up and their personnel reassigned to other formations as reinforcements. The 2nd Armoured Brigade was kept intact and became an independent armoured formation. The divisional headquarters was also maintained and by October, it commanded two ad hoc units in addition to a vastly different 18th Infantry Brigade. The headquarters relinquished command of its final troops on 28 October 1944 and the 1st Armoured Division ceased to be an operational formation thereafter.
