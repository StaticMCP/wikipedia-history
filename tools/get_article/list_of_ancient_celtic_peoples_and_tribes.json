In the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, Celts inhabited a large part of mainland Western Europe and large parts of Western Southern Europe (Iberian Peninsula), southern Central Europe and some regions of the Balkans and Anatolia. They were most of the population in Gallia, today's France, Switzerland, possibly Belgica – far Northern France, Belgium and far Southern Netherlands, large parts of Hispania, i.e. Iberian Peninsula – Spain and Portugal, in the northern, central and western regions; southern Central Europe – upper Danube basin and neighbouring regions, large parts of the middle Danube basin and the inland region of Central Asia Minor or Anatolia. They lived in these many regions forming a large arc stretching across from Iberia in the west to the Balkans and Anatolia in the east.\nMany of the populations from these regions were called Celts by ancient authors. They are thought to have spoken Gaulish (P-Celtic type), Lepontic (P-Celtic type), Hispano-Celtic (Celtiberian and Western Hispano-Celtic or Gallaecian) (Q-Celtic type), Eastern Celtic or Noric (unknown type). P-Celtic type languages are more innovative (*kʷ > p) while Q-Celtic type languages are more conservative. However, it is not fully known if this grouping of peoples, such as their languages, is a genealogical one (phylogenetic), based on kinship, or if it is a simple geographically based group. Classical Antiquity authors did not describe the peoples and tribes of the British Islands as “Celts” or “Galli” but by the name “Britons”. They only used the name “Celts” or “Galli” for the peoples and tribes of mainland Europe.\nEastern Celts\nSource:\ndwelt in most areas of the shown land on the map except for the Rhaetians.]]\nriver basin around 1st C. BCE]]\nThey lived in Southern Central Europe (in the Upper Danube basin and neighbouring regions) which is hypothesized as the original area of the Celts (Proto-Celts), corresponding to the Hallstatt Culture. Later they expanded towards the Middle Danube valley and to parts of the Balkans and towards inland central Asia Minor or Anatolia (Galatians). Hercynian Forest (Hercynia Silva), north of the Danube and east of the Rhine was in their lands. Celts, especially those from Western and Central Europe, were generally called by the Romans “Galli” i.e. “Gauls”, this name was synonym of “Celts”, this also means that not all of the peoples and tribes called by the name “Gauls” (Galli) were specifically Gauls in a narrower more regional sense. Their language is scarcely attested and can not be classified as a P-Celtic or Q-Celtic.\nSome closely fit the concept of a tribe. Others are confederations or even unions of tribes.\n*Anartes/Anartoi&nbsp;– Areas of modern Slovakia and modern Northern Hungary, north of the river Tysia / Tibiscus (Tisza). They lived in the eastern part of the Hercynia Silva (Hercynian Forest). Areas of modern central Slovakia and modern Northern Hungary, north of the river Tysia/Tibiscus (Tisza), north of the Teuriscii. They were later assimilated by Dacians.\n*Arabiates - areas of modern Western Hungary and eastern Austria, west of the river Danubius (Danube).\n*Belgites - areas of modern Western Hungary, west of the river Danubius (Danube).\n*Boii– a tribal confederation, originally from today's Bohemia (Western Czech Republic) that dwelt in the Hercynia Silva and dispersed through migrations to other regions of Europe, to areas of modern Slovakia, Germany, Austria, Hungary and Northern Italy. Another hypothesis is that they were a tribal confederation, originally from today's Southern France who migrated to Hercynia Silva under Segovesus, and dispersed through migrations to other regions of Europe, to areas of modern Slovakia, Germany, Austria, Poland and Hungary.\n**Boii tribes of unknown names in the Hercynia Silva - roughly in today's Bohemia\n**Boii (in Cisalpine Gaul) &nbsp;– Central Emilia-Romagna (Bologna) and Lodi, Lombardy.\n**Boii (in Transalpine Gaul) &nbsp;– Boui near Entrain - They were related to or a branch of the Boii.\n** Boii Boiates / Boviates / Boiates &nbsp;– La Tête de Buch, probably around Arcachon Bay and northwest of Landes (departement), in the Pays de Buch and Pays de Born. Although they dwelt in Aquitania Proper, they seem to have been a Celtic tribe and not a tribe of the Aquitani (a people that may have been ancestor of the Basques).\n**Boii (in Pannonia) - Pannonia, today's Western Hungary (west of the Danube) and part of eastern Austria\n**Tulingi (Tylangii?) &nbsp;– localization unclear, possibly Southern Germany, Switzerland, or Austria; an originally Boii Celtic tribe that migrated along the upper Danube and later allied with the Helvetii?; also, may have been a Germanic tribe.\n*Breuci\n*Carni &nbsp;– Carnic Alps, South Austria (Carinthia/Kärnten), Western Slovenia (Carniola/Kranjska) and Northern Friuli/Friûl (Carnia/Cjargna). A tribe related to the Carnutes? Also, may have been a Venetic tribe (the Veneti were a transitional people between Celts and Italics or a Celticized Italic people).\n*Catubrini &nbsp;- In the Alps Southeastern slopes, close to Plavis (Piave) and near Bellunum (Belluno), to the Southwest of the Carni. They came from Central Europe and not from Gaul (Gallia). (They were not Cisalpine Gaulish Celts). They probably were a ver sacrum of Carni.\n*Celts of Tylis / Tylisian Celts\n*Cornacates- areas of modern Western Hungary, west of river Danubius (Danube).\n*Cotini &nbsp;– areas of modern Slovakia, west of the Anartes, and areas of Western Hungary, west of the river Danubius (Danube), south of Lacus Pelsodis / Pelso (today's Lake Balaton).\n*Eravisci / Aravisci– areas of modern Western Hungary, west of the river Danubius (Danube), Aquincum (modern Budapest) was in their territory.\n*Helvetii-Rauraci / Raurici\n**Helvetii &nbsp;– original dwellers of Agri Decumates region, in the western part of Hercynia Silva, to the east and north of the Rhine; later, possibly at the end of the 3rd century BC they expanded to the South and Southwest to land later called Helvetia (modern day Switzerland). They were possibly more related to the Celtic populations of the upper Danube basin than to the Celts of Gaul.\n***Decumates may have meant \"Ten Cantons\". La Tène, (tribal confederation of four tribes).\n***Tigurini &nbsp;– Yverdon\n***Tougeni\n***Verbigeni\n***Tribe of unknown name (Helvetii Proper?)\n**Rauraci / Raurici &nbsp; – Kaiseraugst (Augusta Raurica), a tribe closely related to the Helvetii.\n*Hercuniates / Hercuniatae - areas of modern Western Hungary, west of the river Danubius (Danube).\n*Latobici / Latovici - not the same tribe as the Latobrigi but they could have been related, they dwelt in areas of modern Slovenia and Western Hungary, west of the river Danubius (Danube).\n*Latobrigi - uncertain location, maybe to the north or northeast of the Helvetii in the upper Danube (Danubius) and upper Rhine river basins, original dwellers of Agri Decumates region, in the western part of Hercynia Silva.\n*Scordisci - areas of modern Serbia, Croatia, Austria, Romania, west of the river Danubius (Danube). According to Livy, they were related to the Bastarnae.\n**Celegeri / Celengeri\n**Dindari or Dindarii (Greek Δινδάριοι), a tribe that was a branch of the Scordisci.\nMap 6: Tribes in Thrace before the Roman period. Some of the tribes shown, such as the [[Serdi were Celts.]]\n*Serdi - in Serdica region (today's Sofiya, Bulgaria's Capital)\n*Serrapilli / Serapilli - areas of modern Western Hungary, west of the river Danubius (Danube).\n*Serretes - areas of modern Western Hungary, west of the river Danubius (Danube).\n*Tricornenses (a later formation tribe)\n*Norici / Taurisci / Varisci - a tribal confederation\n**Alauni - in the middle Aenus river basin (Inn), east of the Aenus in the Eastern Alps, Chiemsee and Attersee lakes region.\n**Ambidravi / Ambidrani - in the upper and middle Dravus (Drau/Drava) river basin in the Eastern Alps and also in the Mur/Mura river basin, today's Carinthia and Styria, Austria.\n**Ambilici - in the Dravus (Drau/Drava) river basin, east of the Ambidravi/Ambidrani (today's Southeast Austria and Northeast Slovenia).\n**Ambisontes / Ambisontii - in the Alpes Noricae (East Central Alps), in the upper Salzach river basin.\n**Norici (Narisci) / Nori - may have been a tribe of the larger Taurisci tribal federation; in the Eastern Alps and in the Mur/Mura and Schwarza rivers basins and other areas, today's Styria and Lower Austria (Austria) south of the Danubius (Danube), also may have been a Germanic tribe.\n**Sevaces - in the low Aenus river basin (Inn), east of the Aenus and south of the Danubius (Danube), roughly in today's Upper Austria.\n**Teuriscii - A branch of the Celtic Taurisci (originally from Noricum) in the Tysia/Tibiscus (Tisza) river basin south of the Anartes/Anartii/Anartoi. Celts assimilated by Dacians\n*Varciani– areas of modern Slovenia, Croatia.\n*Vindelici &nbsp; – a tribal confederation, areas of modern Southern Germany (Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg), in the upper Danube basin. May have been a confederation of mixed Celtic and Germanic tribes.\n**Brigantii &nbsp; – in the Lacus Brigantinus (Lake Constance) area, Brigantia (Bregenz) was the main centre, in the border areas of modern Germany, Austria and Switzerland, north of the Vennonetes/Vennones/Vennonienses.\n**Catenates &nbsp; - South of the Danubius (Danube), in the low Licus (Lech) river area, Augusta Vindelicorum region (today's Augsburg), north of the Licates.\n**Consuanetae / Cosuanetes / Cotuantii - Upper and middle valley of fl.

Rhenus (r. Rhine) in today's canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland, south of the Brigantii.\n**Vindelici Proper &nbsp; – a tribe to the north of the Upper Danube.\n*Volcae - a tribal confederation, originally from today's Moravia (Eastern Czech Republic), Central and Upper Danube basin (Slovakia, Austria, Southern Germany), also in Main river basin, to the west of the Boii. They dwelt in Hercynia Silva, north of the Danuvius (Danube) but dispersed through migrations to other regions of Europe (Southern Gaul) and Asia Minor/Anatolia (Galatia).\n**Volcae tribes of unknown names in Hercynia Silva - roughly in today's Moravia and Main river basin.\n**Volcae Arecomici / Volcae Arecomisci – in southern Gaul, in the Mediterranean coast of today's Languedoc.\n**Volcae Tectosages (in Southern Gaul and also in Galatia, Central Asia Minor or Anatolia, one of the main tribes that formed the Galatians)\n*Possible Volcae tribes\n**Volciani &nbsp;– may have been a tribe related to the Volcae and not to the Hispano-Celts / Iberian Celts (i.e., the Celts of the Iberian Peninsula). Located north of the river Iberus (Ebro), but not very precisely.\nGalatians\n/ Anatolia. Galatia where Galatians dwelt is in the centre.]]\nIn the middle 3rd century BC, Celts from the middle Danube valley, immigrated from Thrace into the highlands of central Anatolia (modern Turkey), which was called Galatia after that. These people, called Galatians, a generic name for “Celts”, were eventually Hellenized, but retained many of their own traditions. They spoke Galatian, a name derived from the generic name for “Celts”. Some closely fit the concept of a tribe. Others are confederations or even unions of tribes.\n*Aigosages, between Troy and Cyzicus\n*  Daguteni, in modern Marmara region around Orhaneli\n*  Inovanteni, east of the Trocnades\n*  Okondiani, between Phrygia and Galatia northeast of modern Akşehir Gölü\n*  Rigosages, unlocated\n*  Trocnades, in Phrygia around modern Sivrihisar\n*Unknown tribe (Territory of Gaezatorix, a Celtic Chieftain), between Bithynia and Galatia at modern Bolu\n*Core Galatians\n**Tectosages, in Galatia\n**Tolistobogii, in Galatia\n**Trocmii, in Galatia (easternmost known Celtic tribe)\nGauls (Galli or Celtae)\nMap 8: Gaul (58 BC) with important tribes, towns, rivers, etc. and early [[Roman provinces.]]\n) on the eve of Roman conquest (Celtica, which included Armorica, Belgica and Aquitania Propria were conquered while Narbonensis was conquered earlier, already ruled by the Roman Republic). The map shows the ethnic and linguistic kinship of the tribes by different colours (the map is in French).]]\nat the end of the 1st century B.C. (Droysens Allgemeiner historischer Handatlas, 1886), with important tribes, towns, rivers, etc. and Roman provinces.]]\nGauls were the Celtic people that lived in Gaul having many tribes but with some influential tribal confederations. Galli (Gauls), for the Romans, was a name synonym of “Celts” (as Julius Caesar states in De Bello Gallico) which means that not all peoples and tribes called “Galli” were necessarily Gauls in a narrower regional sense.\nGaulish Celts spoke Gaulish, a Continental Celtic language of the P Celtic type, a more innovative Celtic language - *kʷ > p.\nRomans initially organized Gaul in two provinces (later in three):\nTransalpine Gaul, meaning literally \"Gaul on the other side of the Alps\" or \"Gaul across the Alps\", is approximately modern Belgium, France, Switzerland, Netherlands, and Western Germany in what would become the Roman provinces of Gallia Narbonensis, Gallia Celtica (later Lugdunensis and Aquitania) and Gallia Belgica.\nSome closely fit the concept of a tribe. Others are confederations or even unions of tribes.\n*Abrincatui - in Aremorica or Armorica\n*Aedui / Haedui&nbsp; - Gaulish Celts largest tribal confederation, roughly in the geographical centre of Gaul and controlling important land, river, and trade routes\n**Aedui / Haedui proper - Bibracte\n**Ambivareti\n**Parisii (Gaul) - Lutetia, today's Paris, was their capital.

Some Gaulish tribes may have migrated southward and crossed the Pyrenees (by the north, the central, or the south areas of the mountains) in a second or a third Celtic wave to the Iberian Peninsula. These tribes were different from the Hispano-Celtic / Iberian Celtic tribes.\n**Garumni&nbsp;– along the banks of the high Garumna (Garonne), southwest of the Volcae Tectosages, and in and around Lugdunum Convenarum, among the Convenae. Although they dwelt in Aquitania Proper, they seem to have been a Celtic tribe and not a tribe of the Aquitani (a people that may have been the ancestor of the Basques).\nCisalpine Gauls\n*Cisalpine Gauls (Celtae / Galli Cisalpini) - They lived in Cisalpine Gaul, most of today's northern Italy. Multiple waves of population movements from France. They spoke Cisalpine Gaulish (a Continental Celtic language of the P Celtic type) closely related to Gaulish or Gallic. They lived in Cisalpine Gaul (Gallia Cisalpina), also called Gallia Citerior or Gallia Togata, was the part of Italy continually inhabited by Celts since the 13th century BC. Conquered by the Roman Republic in the 220s BC, it was a Roman province from c. 81 BC until 42 BC, when it was merged into Roman Italy. Until that time, it was considered part of Gaul, precisely that part of Gaul on the \"hither side of the Alps\" (from the perspective of the Romans), as opposed to Transalpine Gaul (\"on the far side of the Alps\").\n**Seven Gaulish tribes that according to Livy settled in Cisalpine Gaul around 600 BC. Led by Bellovesus, they defeated the Etruscans at the Ticino, settled in Insubria and founded the city of Mediolanum, the modern Milan. They were ancestors of Cisalpine Gauls.\n***Aedui (many Insubres descended from them)\n***Ambarri\n***Arverni\n***Aulerci (many Cisalpine Gaul Cenomani descended from them)\n***Bituriges\n***Carnutes\n***Salyes or Salluvii (Celto-Ligurians)\n**Anani&nbsp;– Western Emilia, Po Valley, (Fidentia, Province of Piacenza)\n**Anamares&nbsp;– Minor tribe whose precise location along the southern bank of the river Padus in Italy is uncertain\n**Anares&nbsp;– Middle Po Valley, Placentia (Piacenza, Province of Piacenza)\n**Cenomani (Cisalpine Gaul)&nbsp;– Eastern Lombardy (Brixia, Cremona). Related to or a branch of the Cenomani (Aulerci Cenomani) that lived in Transalpine Gaul (Gallia Transalpina).\n**Insubres&nbsp;– Western Lombardy (Milan). Said by Pliny to descend from the Aedui.\n**Lingones&nbsp;– North-eastern Emilia-Romagna (Ferrara), Po Valley. Related to or a branch of the Lingones that lived in Gaul (Gallia).\n**Senones&nbsp;– South-eastern Emilia-Romagna (Rimini) and Northern Marche (Senigallia). Related to or a branch of the Senones that lived in Gaul (Gallia).\nLepontine Celts\nThey seem to have been an older group of Celts that lived in Cisalpine Gaul before the Gaulish Celtic migration. They spoke Lepontic (a Continental Celtic language) a Celtic language that seems to precede Cisalpine Gaulish.\n*Lepontii / Lepontii / Leipontii / Lepontes &nbsp;– Valle Leventina and Val d'Ossola in today's Province of Verbano-Cusio-Ossola, Piemonte, North-eastern Piedmont, far Northwestern Lombardy, and Switzerland in the Lepontine Alps. They were not Gaulish Celts\n*Orobii or Orumbovii&nbsp;– Central Lombardy (Bergamo)\nCelto-Ligurians / Gallo-Ligurians\nMay have been Celtic tribes influenced by Ligurians, heavily Celticized Ligurian tribes that shifted to a Celtic ethnolinguistic identity or mixed Celtic-Ligurian tribes. They dwelt in southeastern Transalpine Gaul and northwestern Cisalpine Gaul, mainly in the Western Alps regions, Rhodanus eastern basin and upper Po river basin.\n*Acitavones\n*Adenates / Adanates&nbsp;– slopes of the Western Alps (Maurienne-Modanne), Southern Gaul\n*Adunicates&nbsp;– Andon área, Southern Gaul\n*Albici&nbsp;– Middle and Lower Durance river valley, Southern Gaul (tribal confederation)\n**Albienses / Albici Proper\n**Vordenses\n**Vulgientes\n*Anatili\n*Avantices (Avantici)\n*Avatices / Avatici&nbsp;– Camargue – Rhodanus river delta, south of the Volcae Arecomici, in Southern Gaul\n*Belaci\n*Bodiontici – in Southern Gaul\n*Bormanni\n*Bramovices&nbsp;– Low Tarentaise, Savoy, Southern Gaul\n*Briganii / Brigianii&nbsp;– Briançon, High Durance river valley, Southern Gaul\n*Caburri\n*Camatulici\n*Casmonates / Cosmonates (in the area of Castellazzo Bormida)\n*Caturiges&nbsp;– Chorges, High Durance river valley, in Southern Gaul\n*Cavares/Cavari&nbsp;– North of Low Durance, Arausio (Orange), in Southern Gaul (tribal confederation)\n**Cavares Proper\n**Meminii / Menimii\n*Ceutrones / Centrones&nbsp;– Moûtiers, in the western Alps slopes, Southern Gaul\n*Coenicenses\n*Dexivates\n*Esubiani&nbsp;– Ubaye Valley, Southern Gaul\n*Euburiates\n*Gabieni\n*Glanici\n*Graioceli / Garocelli&nbsp;– Alps western slopes in part of eastern Savoy, and Alps eastern slopes, northwestern Piedmont in the Graian Alps\n*Iadatini\n*Iconii&nbsp;– Gap, in Southern Gaul\n*Irienses\n*Libii / Libici\n*Ligauni\n*Maielli\n*Medulli&nbsp;– upper valley of Maurienne, Southern Gaul\n*Naburni\n*Nearchi\n*Nemalones / Nemolani – in Southern Gaul\n*Nemeturii&nbsp;– High Var river valley, Southern Gaul\n*Orobii - in the northern Italian Alpine valleys of Bergamo, Como and Lecco\n*Quariates – in Southern Gaul\n*Reieni / Reii - in Southern Gaul\n*Salassi (Gallo-Ligurian people)&nbsp;– Aosta Valley and Canavese (Northern Piedmont) (Ivrea)\n*Salyes / Salluvii\n*Savincates\n*Sebagini\n*Segobriges\n*Segovi\n*Segusini - in Segusa (today's Susa, Piemonte)\n*Sentienes / Sentii&nbsp;– Senez, in Southern Gaul\n*Sigorii\n*Sogiontii\n*Suelteri / Sueltri\n*Suetrii\n*Taurini&nbsp;– parts of central Piedmont (Turin region)\n*Tebavii\n*Tricastini\n*Tricorii – in Southern Gaul\n*Tritolii\n*Ucenni\n*Veamini – in Southern Gaul\n*Vennavi\n*Vergunni&nbsp;– Vinon-sur-Verdon, Southern Gaul\n*Verucini\n*Vocontii &nbsp; / Transalpine Gaul Vertamocori&nbsp;– Vaison-la-Romaine, Southern Gaul (in modern Provence, on the east bank of the Rhône and Vercors, southern Gaul.\n**Vertamocorii&nbsp;– Eastern Piedmont (Novara).

(Droysens Allgemeiner historischer Handatlas, 1886), with important tribes, towns, rivers, etc. and Roman provinces.]]\nin the Iberian Peninsula, despite the name, a large part of the peninsula was celtic.]]\nThey lived in large parts of the Iberian Peninsula, in the Northern, Central, and Western regions (half of the Peninsula's territory).\nThe Celts in the Iberian peninsula were traditionally thought of as living on the edge of the Celtic world of the La Tène culture that defined classical Iron Age Celts. Earlier migrations were Hallstatt in culture and later came La Tène influenced peoples. Celtic or (Indo-European) Pre-Celtic cultures and populations existed in great numbers and Iberia experienced one of the highest levels of Celtic settlement in all of Europe. They dwelt in northern, central and western regions of the Iberian Peninsula, but also in several southern regions.\nThey spoke Celtic languages - Hispano-Celtic languages which were of the Q-Celtic type, more conservative Celtic languages.\nRomans initially organized the Peninsula in two provinces (later in three):\nHispania Citerior (\"Nearer Hispania\", \"Hispania that is Closer\", from the perspective of the Romans), was a region of Hispania during the Roman Republic, roughly occupying the northeastern coast and the Iberus (Ebro) Valley and later the eastern, central, northern and northwestern areas of the Iberian peninsula in what would become the Tarraconensis Roman province (of what is now Spain and northern Portugal).\nHispania Ulterior (\"Further Hispania\", \"Hispania that is Beyond\", from the perspective of the Romans) was a region of Hispania during the Roman Republic, roughly located in what would become the provinces of Baetica (that included the Baetis, Guadalquivir, valley of modern Spain) and extending to all of Lusitania (modern south and central Portugal, Extremadura and a small part of Salamanca province).\nThe Roman province of Hispania included both Celtic speaking and non-Celtic speaking tribes. Some closely fit the concept of a tribe. Others are confederations or even unions of tribes.\nWestern Hispano-Celts (Celts of Western Hispania)\nWestern Hispano-Celts were Celtic peoples and tribes that inhabited most of north and western Iberian Peninsula regions. They are often confused or taken as synonym of Celtiberians but, in fact, they were a distinct Celtic population that was most part of Iberian Peninsula Celtic populations. They spoke Gallaecian (a Continental Celtic language of the Q Celtic type, a more conservative Celtic language) which was not Celtiberian (Celtic languages of Iberian Peninsula are often lumped as Hispano-Celtic).\n*Allotriges / Autrigones&nbsp;– East Burgos (Spain), Northwestern La Rioja (Spain) to the Atlantic Coast\n*Astures&nbsp;– Asturias and northern León (Spain), and east of Trás os Montes (Portugal), (tribal confederation).\n**Cismontani\n***\n***Cabruagenigi\n***Gigurri\n***Lancienses\n***Lougei\n***Orniaci\n***Superatii\n***Susarri/Astures Proper\n***Tiburi\n***Zoelae&nbsp;– Eastern Trás-os-Montes (Portugal), (Miranda do Douro).\n**Transmontani\n***Baedunienses\n***Brigaentini\n***Cabarci\n***Iburri\n***Luggones/Lungones\n***Paenii\n***Paesici\n***Saelini\n***Vinciani\n***Viromenici. Might be related to the Viromandui.\n*Bebryaces / Berybraces&nbsp;– unknown location, may have been related to the Bebryces (gauls) or the Berones, there is also the possibility that it was an old name of the Celtiberians.\n*Berones&nbsp;– La Rioja (Spain).

Attempts to classify the language have also pointed at an Italic origin or some kinship to the Nordwestblock culture language (Ancient Belgian). Hence Lusitanian language may have been a Para-Celtic Indo-European branch, like Ligurian (i.e. an Indo-European language branch not Celtic but more closely related to Celtic). The Lusitanians have also been identified as being a pre-Celtic Indo-European speaking culture of the Iberian Peninsula closely related to the neighbouring Vettones tribal confederation.

A tribal confederation but with much more centralized power, may have formed an early form of Kingdom or a Proto-civilisation (see Tartessos)\n*Cilbiceni&nbsp;– approximately in today's Cádiz Province\n*Elbisini / Eloesti / Olbisini&nbsp;– in today's Huelva Province\n*Etmanei&nbsp;– in the middle area of Baetis (Guadalquivir) river course and surrounding region, approximately in today's Córdoba Province\n*Gletes / Galetes / Ileates&nbsp;– in Marianus Mons (Sierra Morena), approximately in today's northern areas of the provinces of Huelva, Seville and Córdoba\n*Turdetani / Tartessii Proper&nbsp;– in the low course of the river Baetis (which they called Rherkēs or Kertis) (Guadalquivir) and surrounding region, approximately in today's Seville Province\nVeneti (Adriatic Veneti)\nTransitional people between Celts and Italics?

Chiefs anthroponyms were also Celtic) Celts influenced by Germanics or the opposite? The name Germani for ancient authors such as Julius Caesar did not always had an accurate ethnic or linguistic meaning, they were not necessarily Germanic-speaking.

They spoke the Rhaetian language. There is evidence that much of the non-Celtic (and Pre-Indo-European) elements (see Tyrsenian languages) of their territory had, by the time of Augustus, been assimilated to varying degrees by the influx of Celtic tribes and had adopted Celtic speech. In addition, the abundance of Celtic toponyms leads to the conclusion that, by the time of Roman conquest, the Rhaetians were significantly Celticized.\n*Benlauni - Upper valley of fl. Aenus (r.
