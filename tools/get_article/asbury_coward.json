He and classmate Micah Jenkins established the King's Mountain Military School in Yorkville in 1855. It closed at the start of the American Civil War. It reopened after the war but the boarding school struggled with the challenging times and closed.\nDuring the Civil War, Coward was commissioned as a colonel and served under General James Longstreet in Tennessee and Georgia. He was also a member of the 5th South Carolina Cavalry Regiment and an assistant adjutant on Col. David Rumph Jones' staff. In one of his reports, Gen. Robert E. Lee described Coward as \"one of the best Colonels in his army.\"\nHe served as president of the Kings Mountain, North Carolina, centennial committee.\nIn 1890, Coward was named Superintendent of The Citadel. He remained in that office until 1908 and died in 1925. He is buried at Rosehill Cemetery in York County.\nThe Daughters of the American Revolution erected a monument honoring him at Kings Mountain National Military Park in Blacksburg. The Citadel has a collection of his letters. Winthrop University has a small collection of his letters. His memoir was published in 1968.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/11093714/asbury-coward Find a Grave entry]"
