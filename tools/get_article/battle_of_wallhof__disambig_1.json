Polish-Lithuanian casualties amounted to between 500 and 1,000 or between 1,000 and 2,300 killed, wounded, or captured; their commander collapsed from mental illness after this defeat.The Swedish king Gustav claimed: \"not a single man is missing; everyone is where they should be\" which is hard to believe, but to have suffered very small casualties is most likely true.\nIn the battle Gustavus Adolphus' reformed tactics, utilising close cooperation between infantry and cavalry, were tried for the first time. It was also the first time the Swedish cavalry successfully withstood the Polish cavalry.\nThe Swedes attacked the Lithuanian camp at dawn and, since the camp was located between two woods, the Lithuanian cavalry could not outflank the Swedes. Instead, the Swedes used the woods to fire upon the Lithuanian cavalry charge.\nfile:Slaget vid Wallhof 1628 SP230.jpg|The battle depicted on a contemporary engraving with the format 290&nbsp;mm x 1070&nbsp;mm.\nReferences\nSources\n* [https://runeberg.org/nfck/0270.html]\n* https://twojahistoria.pl/encyklopedia/leksykon-bitew/bitwa-pod-walmojzami-16-stycznia-1626/\n* \"Wallhof\" in Nordisk familjebok (2nd edition, 1921)\n* Sundberg, Ulf: , pp.&nbsp;109–112, Hjalmarson & Högberg Bokförlag, Stockholm 2002,\n* Gullberg, Tom: , pp.&nbsp;50–52, Schildts Förlags AB, Helsinki 2008,"
