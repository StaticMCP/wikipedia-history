Not all historians agree on the ending dates of ancient history, which frequently falls somewhere in the 5th, 6th, or 7th century. Western scholars usually date the end of ancient history with the fall of Rome in AD 476, the death of the emperor Justinian I in AD 565, or the coming of Islam in AD 632 as the end of ancient European history.\nSee also\n* Timeline of ancient history\n* Bronze Age in Romania\n* Dacia\n* Roman Dacia\nNotes\nReferences\nAncient\n*\n|last           = Martial\n|author-link    = Martial\n|title          = Epigrammaton\n|trans-title=Epigrams\n|url            = http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/index.htm#Martial_Epigrams\n|year           = c. 100\n|language       = Latin\n}}\n*\n|last           = Pliny the Elder\n|author-link    = Pliny the Elder\n|title          = Naturalis Historia\n|trans-title=Natural History\n|url            = https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plin.+Nat.+toc\n|orig-year      = 77-79 AD\n|language       = Latin\n}}\n*\n|last           = Strabo\n|author-link    = Strabo\n|title          = Geographica\n|trans-title=Geography\n|url            = https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/home.html\n|orig-year      = c. 20 AD\n|language       = Ancient Greek\n}}\nModern\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links"
