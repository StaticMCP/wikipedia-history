The Swedes were victorious and the Norwegians retreated to Bohuslän. The Dano-Norwegian commander was Henrik Bielke. A hundred men, led by captain Alexander Hamilton, had been assigned to the Swedish fortifications.  In the initial attack, Norwegian troops lost 24 men, whereas the Swedish defenders lost five men, among them one corporal. The attack came a few months after Vänersborg had been burned to the ground in an attack the previous year.\nThe Swedish forces repelled three attacks before the sieging forces retreated. This marked the end of attacks on Vänersborg during the Torstenson War. Bielke and the Norwegian forces had to leave the area after the Swedish lieutenant colonel Per Lillie had returned with more Swedish troops.\nReferences\n*"
