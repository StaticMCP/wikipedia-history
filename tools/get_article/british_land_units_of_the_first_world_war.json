This was done mainly by adding new battalions to existing regiments (the King's Royal Rifles raised a total of 26 battalions). Although sometimes identified by shoulder titles, generally the new battalions could not be identified from appearance. Consequently, the units in this list have been assembled considering only those as having a uniquely different cap badge.\nRoyal Navy\nAlthough men of the Royal Navy served on land in many areas throughout the world, the units listed below served as an infantry division in Gallipoli, Belgium and France (the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division).\n* 1st (Drake) Battalion\n* 2nd (Hawke) Battalion\n* 3rd (Benbow) Battalion\n* 4th (Collingwood) Battalion\n* 5th (Nelson) Battalion\n* 6th (Howe) Battalion\n* 7th (Hood) Battalion\n* 8th (Anson) Battalion\n* 9th (Chatham) Battalion RMLI\n* 10th (Portsmouth) Battalion RMLI\n* 11th (Plymouth) Battalion RMLI\n* 12th (Deal) Battalion RMLI\n* 9th (Machine Gun) Battalion\n* Royal Marine Artillery\n* Royal Marine Labour Corps\n* Royal Naval Air Service Armoured Car Section\n* Royal Naval Air Service\nCavalry\nRegular\nThe cavalry consisted of Guards (Household Cavalry), Dragoon Guards, Dragoons, Hussars and Lancers.
