Such tools are commonly used in comparative genomics, cladistics, and bioinformatics. Methods for estimating phylogenies include neighbor-joining, maximum parsimony (also simply referred to as parsimony), unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA), Bayesian phylogenetic inference, maximum likelihood, and distance matrix methods.\nList\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
