Kisa's widow requested from the Magyar chief to give her another army to avenge his death. With an \"unknown number\" of troops, the widow went for Ciaslavus, encountering him somewhere in Syrmia. In the night, the Magyars attacked the Serbs, captured Ciaslavus and all of his male relatives. On the command of the widow, all of them were bound by their hands and feet and thrown into the Sava river. Seemingly the region of Syrmia wasn't conquered as the mythical successor Belo fought there at the battle of Bellina and concluded peace with the Hungarians.\nThe mentioned Ciaslavus some scholars identify with the prince Časlav of Serbia (r. 933–943) from the 10th century De Administrando Imperio. The event some scholars date to  950 or 960, expanding Časlav rule and life. However, the account could be just a fantasy, and is chronologically unrelated to the time period of DAI's Časlav, dated according to the source in the beginning of the 9th century, meanwhile Bosnia per LJPD in the mid-10th century would have been ruled by Croatian ban Krešimir (usually identified with Michael Krešimir II) and his son Stjepan (identified with Stephen Držislav), without any Hungarian-Serbian War taking place in the 950/960s.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
