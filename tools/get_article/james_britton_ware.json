He was born on June 16, 1830, in Heard County, Georgia and died on January 30, 1918, in Heard County, Georgia.\nEarly life\nJames Britton (J.B.) Ware was born to John Mims Ware and Lucy Sturdivant, and his father died when he was 8 years old. On October 11, 1849, at age 19, he married Sarah Margaret Tabitha Simms, she was 16 years old, at the Bethel Baptist Church in Heard County, Georgia. Sarah Simms was the daughter of John Simms and Comfort Maddox Grace.  Comfort was born March 26, 1798, and married September 16, 1816 in Hancock, Georgia, she was the daughter of Thomas Grace and Sarah \"Sally\" Maddox.\nOn October 28, 1850, they purchased 202-1/2 acres from a neighbor, Thomas H. Hanson, and built their home. His superior abilities as a man of affairs being quickly recognized by his fellow citizens, he was elected Justice of the Peace at 21, serving eight years. In 1859 and 1860 he was elected to represent Heard County, Georgia in the general assembly.\nDuring the Civil War in 1863 James raised a company of seventy men, of which he was elected Captain of the State Guards.  It became Company G, of Colonial Wilcoxon's regiment of state troops and General Iverson's Brigade, which took part in several skirmishes near Rome, Georgia.  The decision to leave his family was hard because it meant leaving behind his wife and six small children, their ages being 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 and a newborn. His wife, Sarah, would be left alone to administer to all the needs of a large family and a large farm. He left with a heavy heart, to join the war effort.\nIn 1864 he enlisted in the confederate service, in which he continued rendering valuable service until the surrender.  During the Battle of Atlanta and Sherman's march, the Ware home served as a refuge for relatives and friends in the Atlanta area. During the \"unpleasantness\" he gave up his business and devoted money, time and labor to caring for the families of the soldiers, a noble service on his part which they never forgot, and were always ready to express their gratitude. Among his brothers who entered the war, only David and James returned home, his brother, John, Jr., left behind a wife, a small son.\nAfter his mother's death in 1869, James purchased the family home from his siblings, and successfully managed his estate over the next 10 years. In 1872 he was incorporated in the Jury Commissioner's Bill and served continuously until 1904. In 1874 he was elected to the Georgia Legislature receiving 500 of the 700 votes cast, working in both the House and Senate.\nIn 1904 James was elected State Senator of the 37th District. While in the Senate he introduced and secured the passage of a bill making drunkenness on the public highway a crime, as well as introducing and having enacted the bill forbidding the sale of whiskey in Georgia within the radius of one mile from a church.

He was also Treasurer of the Western Baptist Association, and President of the Corinth Agricultural and Horticultural Club.\nJuly 20, 1906, Resolved, That the Senate learns with regret of illness of the venerable Senator from the 37th district.

Oh, what days of rejoicing will be with the good people when the bottle and the pistol toter become a thing of the past.\"\nAt a reunion he said, \"during my life, I set out to make a useful man of myself, and take such position in life that would make life worth living. My highest ambition in life was to raise my children to be men and women of integrity and dignity, these principles being the foundations of all greatness. To what extent I have instilled these principles into the minds of my children, I leave to my neighbors and to the public to decide. I admonished all my grandchildren, and their children to improve upon their parents.\" He finished by saying that this day was a happy reunion day, but his prayer was that the world all live so that when death comes, we would meet again for a happy reunion in heaven.  At his death at age 87, he had 40 grandchildren and 41 great grandchildren, and was one of Heard County's leading citizens. This home recently burned to the ground during a lightning storm and nothing was saved.\nReferences"
