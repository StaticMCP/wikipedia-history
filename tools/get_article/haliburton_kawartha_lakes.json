Both of these townships were placed in the new riding of Peterborough-Kawartha.\nIn 2023, the Township of Brock in the Regional Municipality of Durham was removed from the riding and placed in the new riding of York—Durham, and the County of Peterborough Townships of Trent Lakes and North Kawartha were added. As a consequence, the name of the electoral district changed to \"Haliburton—Kawartha Lakes\".
