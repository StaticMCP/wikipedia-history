The Cobras drew fewer than 1,000 per game at home and owner Jerry Shorthouse ran out of money before the end of the season.\nMost of the Cobras’ roster came over from the defunct Buffalo Stampede franchise (1994-1995), which won RHI’s Murphy Cup in 1994. Although the club was good and won the Atlantic Division with a 16-7-5 record, the Cobras reportedly had to sell their home court advantage in the playoffs to the lower-seeded Orlando Jackals.  They lost to the eventual champion Jackals in the first round. In January 1997, the Cobras returned to Buffalo under new ownership and changed their name to the Buffalo Wings. Roller Hockey International suspended operations in late 1997. After sitting out 1998, the league re-organized for one final season in 1999 and then folded.\nReferences"
