      "text": "# Timeline of the Russo-Ukrainian war (29 August – 11 November 2022)\n\nThis timeline of the Russo-Ukrainian war covers the period from 29 August 2022, when Ukraine's Kherson counteroffensive started, to 11 November 2022 when Ukrainian troops retook Kherson. In between, Ukraine launched a successful counteroffensive in Kharkiv Oblast. Starting in October, Russia began a campaign of massive strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure.\nThis timeline is a dynamic and fluid list, and as such may never satisfy criteria of completeness. Please note that some events may only be fully understood and/or discovered in retrospect.\nAugust 2022\n29 August\nUkraine launched a counteroffensive in the south. The Ukrainian government said that its military had \"breached Russia's first line of defense near Kherson\", while the Ukrainian military also claimed to have struck a Russian military base in Kherson Oblast, though this claim was not verified. Russian forces claimed that Ukrainian forces have suffered \"heavy losses\". Ukraine also claimed that Russian paratroopers have fled the battlefield.\n30 August\nUkraine claimed to have used decoy HIMARS units made out of wood, which could have explained Russian claims of having destroyed multiple HIMARS systems. Ukrainian officials claimed to have decoyed 10 Russian 3M-54 Kalibr cruise missiles alone. One US diplomat noted that Russian sources claimed to have destroyed more HIMARS than the US has sent. Another Pentagon official confirmed no HIMARS had been destroyed yet.\nImages from Maxar Technologies showed holes in the roof of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. IAEA chief Rafael Grossi confirmed that the support and assistance mission was \"now on its way\".\n31 August\nRussia pulled its fighter jets out of Crimea and increased its surface-to-air missiles to defend against future shelling.\nRussia stopped gas supplies to Germany via Nord Stream 1 for three days to perform repairs.\nAccording to the UK MoD, Ukrainian forces pushed the Russian \"front line back some distance in places\", due to Ukraine \"exploiting relatively thinly held Russian defenses\".\nUkraine released footage of a MiG-29 firing an AGM-88 HARM, which had to be somehow integrated into the MiG-29's analogue displays.\nSeptember 2022\n1 September\ninspectors at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant]]\nIAEA inspectors arrived at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.\nRavil Maganov, the chairman of Lukoil, died in disputed circumstances. According to Interfax, he \"fell out of a window of the Central Clinical Hospital\" and \"died from his injuries\". Lukoil was one of the few Russian companies to oppose the war in Ukraine, calling for an \"immediate\" end to the war. Maganov's death is the latest mysterious death of current or former Russian businessmen since the war began.\n2 September\nNorwegian state-owned oil company Equinor exited the last of their joint ventures in Russia following the February invasion by withdrawing from the joint venture with Lukoil and exiting the Kharyaga project.\nUkraine arrested a woman in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast who was accused of sending the details of her husband's unit and other military information to Russian forces which was then used to the advantage of Russian military action.\nRussian support for the war in Ukraine remained stable despite it dragging on for six months. The greatest disagreement was on whether to continue the war or proceed to negotiations.\nUkraine was searching the UK for foundries to make 155&nbsp;mm ammunition due to Western stockpiles running low. BAE systems can increase production however Ukrainian officials are looking for other manufacturers. The US had sent \"806,000\" of these rounds to Ukraine and replacing them could take as long as \"18 months\".\n3 September\nGazprom maintained its shutdown of Nord Stream 1 without providing a date for restarting the flow of gas. Gazprom cited international sanctions as the reason that it cannot fix the \"malfunction\" in the pipe, which is claimed to be a leak. The European Union called it an economic weapon.\nAccording to the UK MoD, since 29 August Ukrainian forces had gained the element of surprise due to mistakes made by Russian commanders and logistical problems Russian forces face. There were three main thrusts by Ukrainian forces into Kherson Oblast. Ukraine also destroyed pontoon bridges used by Russian forces.\n4 September\nThe Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant was cut from its main power line, with only a reserve line operational, which was supplying power to the grid. Only one of the six reactors remained operational. Russia blamed this on an alleged Ukrainian attempt to retake the plant.\nAfter not being used for several months Ukraine resumed its use of Bayraktar TB2 drones. Ukraine started putting footage from these online again after no new footage in the last two months. This was credited to the use of HARM missiles and their impact on Russian air defences.\n6 September\nArtem Bardin, a Russian-installed official in Berdyansk, was seriously injured in a bomb attack.\nSky News reported that Russia bought rockets from North Korea to assist with the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.Sky News claimed to have gotten the information from a New York Times report, which cited downgraded US intelligence findings.\n7 September\nThe US was looking to double its production of 155&nbsp;mm shells due to a need to replenish US stocks as well as supply Ukrainian needs. The Pentagon said it was aiming to increase the number of HIMARS built each month to 12.\n9 September\nUkrainian forces retook parts of Kharkiv Oblast.\n10 September\nAs part of a major counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces recaptured Kupiansk and Izium; according to the UK Ministry of Defence, Russian defences in Kharkiv Oblast were \"likely taken by surprise\".

The Russian Ministry of Defence spokesperson Igor Konashenkov responded to these developments by claiming that Russian forces in the Balakliya and Izyum area would \"regroup\" in the Donetsk area \"in order to achieve the stated goals of the special military operation to liberate Donbas\". Ukrainian President Zelenskyy said that Ukraine has recaptured  since the start of the counteroffensive.\n11 September\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense published a map which confirmed that Russian forces in Kharkiv Oblast had retreated to the east bank of the Oskil river. The settlements of Kozachya Lopan, Vovchansk and Lyptsi were confirmed as being under control of Ukrainian forces. By late afternoon, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the formal withdrawal of Russian forces from nearly all of Kharkiv Oblast stating that an \"operation to curtail and transfer troops\" was underway.\nChechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov questioned Russian leadership of the war, writing on Telegram: \"They have made mistakes and I think they will draw the necessary conclusions. If they don't make changes in the strategy of conducting the special military operation in the next day or two, I will be forced to contact the leadership of the Defense Ministry and the leadership of the country to explain the real situation on the ground.\"\nFollowing the 2022 Ukrainian Kharkiv counteroffensive, Russia launched missile strikes with Kalibr cruise missiles on critical infrastructure objects, including Kharkiv TEC-5, causing a total blackout and water shutdown in northeastern Ukraine and Kharkiv and Donetsk Oblasts.\n12 September\nUkraine claimed it had reached the Russia–Ukraine border. Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian forces had retaken a total of  from Russia, in both the south and the east; the BBC could not verify the claims.\nThirty-five Russian municipal deputies signed a petition calling for President Vladimir Putin to resign.\n13 September\nOn the Kherson front, it was reported that Russian forces had withdrawn from Kiselyovka, a settlement 15&nbsp;km from Kherson.

Penalties for not reporting for military duty, or leaving it without permission, were increased.\nThe Russian-appointed officials of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics announced referendums to approve their annexation by Russia on 23–27 September.

Furthermore, militants in the Luhansk and Donetsk People's Republics were to be considered soldiers of the Russian Federation going forward, and the LPR and DPR military units will be reordered according to Russian standards. Defence minister Sergei Shoigu said that 300,000 reservists will be mobilized. Putin also raised the threat of a nuclear response, saying \"Russia will use all the instruments at its disposal to counter a threat against its territorial integrity—this is not a bluff\".\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Saudi Arabia reported that Russia released ten foreign prisoners of war after mediation by Prince Mohammed bin Salman. According to Robert Jenrick, the junior health minister of Britain, Aiden Aslin is among the prisoners released.

There were planned votes in the Mykolaiv and Kharkiv oblasts that never materialized, mainly owing to limited control of territory. As a side effect of these referendums, Russia now claimed that the \"very existence of the state is at risk\", since much of the war was happening on what it now illegally considered Russian territory, and could be used as justification of using nuclear weapons.\nOver 194,000 Russian citizens, primarily fighting age men and their families, left Russia in what has been called a \"mass exodus\" after the announcement of a draft of 300,000 citizens to fight in the war.
