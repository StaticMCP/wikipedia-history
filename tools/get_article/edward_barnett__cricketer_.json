His batting and bowling styles are unknown.\nBarnett made his first-class debut in 1837, playing for The Bs against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's.\nIn 1841, he appeared in four more first-class matches: three for Sussex—against MCC at Lord's, against Kent at the Old County Ground, West Malling, and again against MCC at the Royal New Ground, Brighton—and one for the Slow Bowlers against the Fast Bowlers at Lord's. His selection for the Slow Bowlers side suggests he was likely a slow bowler, though no definitive record of his bowling style exists. It is also possible that he was included as a given man.\nAcross his five first-class appearances, Barnett scored 42 runs at an average of 4.20, with a top score of 9. He also took six catches.\nBarnett died in Blean, Kent in 1899.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
