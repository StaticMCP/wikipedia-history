It was established by the Common Council of Kingston on December 20, 1841, making it one of the oldest police forces in Canada. Today, the Kingston Police is made up of approximately 300 members serving an area of 451.58 square kilometers and 132,485 (2021 Census) people.\nHistory\nThe Kingston Police Force was established by the Common Council of Kingston on December 20, 1841, in an attempt to manage the lawlessness in the capital of the former Province of Canada. The original police force comprised a Chief Constable and four sub-constables. Despite their best effort, the force's growth was limited due to monetary restraints. In the 1850s, they were composed of about 8-10 officers growing to about a dozen in the 1860s, where it remained until the early 20th century.\nFollowing World War II, the force finally began growing at a more consistent rate. In 1990 they had expanded to 116 sworn officers serving a population of over 60,000 inhabitants.  The 1990s were a tough decade for the Kingston Police Force. In 1993, the Social Contract Act was put in place by the government in an attempt to address budget deficits. This resulted in a major loss in funding, ultimately leading to the reduction of the force to 101 officers. In 1996, the province introduced additional cost-saving initiatives such as the Savings and Restructuring Act, which merged smaller municipalities with their neighbours. In 1998, both the Kingston Township and the Pittsburgh Township were merged into Kingston City, nearly doubling its population. During this transitional period, the Ontario Provincial Police assisted the KPF in managing its population, however, by the end of the decade, the Kingston Police having now grown to nearly 150 sworn officers, re-claimed full control over their newly expanded jurisdiction. By 2011 the force had grown to 198 officers and 60 civilian employees.\nDivisions\nThe Kingston Police currently has four separate divisions each responsible for a separate area of policing.\nPatrol and Communications\nPatrol Platoons work 12 hour shifts, with 2 day shifts, followed by 2 night shifts, and then 4 days off. 911 Communication Unit staffs are assigned to platoons.\nSource:\n* A Platoon\n* B Platoon\n* C Platoon\n* D Platoon\n* 911 Communications Unit\n* Community Outreach and Support Team\n* Mobile Crisis Rapid Response Team\n* Special Constables\nInvestigative Services\nThe Investigative Services is split into Criminal Investigations and Special Services\nSource:\nCriminal Investigations\n*Forensic Identification Unit\n*E-Crimes/Disclosure\n*Major Case Management\n*General Investigations Unit\n*Major Crime Unit\n*Fraud Unit\n*Vulnerable Sector Unit\n*Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Unit\n*Internet Child Exploitation Unit\nSpecial Services\n* Intelligence Unit\n* Drug Enforcement Unit\n* Street Crime Unit\n* Technical Investigations\n* Dangerous Offender\n* Joint Forces Penitentiary Squad (Pen Squad)\n* Provincial Weapons Enforcement Unit (PWEU)\n* Repeat Offender Parole Enforcement (ROPE)\n* Guns and Gangs Joint Forces Operation\n* Joint Forces Operation Bikers Enforcement Unit (BEU)\n* High-Risk Sex-Offender Manager\nOperational Support\nSource:\nProfessional Standards\n* Quality Assurance and Audit\n* Legal\nCommunity Oriented Response and Engagement (CORE)\n* Beat and Bicycle Officers\n* Community Operations\n* School Resource Officers\n* Police Liaison Teams\n* Media Relations Office\n* Community Volunteers\n* Traffic Safety Unit (Part of CORE Unit)\n* Police Motorcycle Unit\n* Drone/Aerial Support Unit\n* Collision Reconstruction Unit\nAdministrative Support\nSource:\n* Facility/Fleet Services\n* Training Unit\n* Emergency Response Unit (ERU)\n* Canine Unit (K9)\n* Alternate Response Unit\n* Cellblock Monitors\n* Court Services\n* Bail Safety\n* Front Desk and Records Unit\n* Property and Stores\nFormer Chiefs\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
