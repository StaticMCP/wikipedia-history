It has been represented by Democrat Bryan Townsend since 2012, following his defeat of incumbent Anthony DeLuca in the Democratic primary.\nGeography\nDistrict 11 covers communities immediately to the east of Newark in New Castle County, including Brookside, Christiana, Woodshade, Taylortown, and some of Bear.\nLike all districts in the state, the 11th Senate district is located entirely within Delaware's at-large congressional district. It overlaps with the 5th, 18th, 24th, and 26th districts of the Delaware House of Representatives.\nRecent election results\nDelaware Senators are elected to staggered four-year terms. Under normal circumstances, the 11th district holds elections in midterm years, except immediately after redistricting, when all seats are up for election regardless of the usual cycle.\n2024\n2022\n2018\n}}\n2014\n2012\nFederal and statewide results\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! width=\"30\" | Year\n! width=\"60\" | Office\n! width=\"180\" | Results\n|-\n| 2020\n| President\n| align=\"right\"  | Biden 71.3 – 27.0%\n|-\n| 2016\n| President\n| align=\"right\"  | Clinton 66.5 – 28.1%\n|-\n| 2014\n| Senate\n| align=\"right\"  | Coons 68.5 – 29.2%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 2012\n| President\n| align=\"right\"  | Obama 72.9 – 25.7%\n|-\n| Senate\n| align=\"right\"  | Carper 77.0 – 19.6%\n|-\n| Governor\n| align=\"right\"  | Markell 79.1 – 18.8%\n|}\nReferences"
