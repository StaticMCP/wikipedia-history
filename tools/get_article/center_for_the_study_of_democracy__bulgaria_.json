The institute is an independent, non-partisan organization fostering the reform process through impact on policy and civil society.\n__TOC__\nObjectives\nCSD's objectives are to:\n* Provide an enhanced institutional and policy capacity for a successful European integration process, especially in the area of justice and home affairs;\n* Promote institutional reform and the practical implementation of democratic values in legal and economic practice;\n* Monitor public attitudes and serve as a watchdog of the institutional reform process.\nHistory\nFounded in late 1989 with the official goal of building bridges between scholars and policy-makers, the institute's work over the years has grown to include policy development and has made inroads into several areas traditionally perceived as the inviolable public property, such as anti-corruption institutional reform and national security. It has had its research cited by major publications such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\nReferences"
