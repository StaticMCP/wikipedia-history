The same act saw the establishment of the Swaziland National Trust Commission. The Commission, a parastatal of the Ministry of Tourism and Environmental Affairs, is charged with the protection and promotion of the country's cultural heritage. As of May 2012, three National Monuments have been proclaimed with a number of candidate sites for future proclamation under examination. Swaziland ratified the UNESCO World Heritage Convention in 2006; the Ngwenya Mines have been submitted for inscription and are currently on the Tentative List.\nList of National Monuments\nThree National Monuments have been proclaimed under the current system:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"width:100%; background:#fff;\"\n|-\n!width=\"25%\" align=\"left\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\" | Site\n!width=\"15%\" align=\"left\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\" | Location\n!width=\"10%\" align=\"left\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\" | Date\n!width=\"25%\" align=\"left\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\" | Comments\n!width=\"15%\" align=\"left\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\" | Coordinates\n!width=\"10%\" align=\"left\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\" class=\"unsortable\"| Image\n|-\n| Mantojolo Pool || outside Mbabane || || sacred to Mnisis clan || ||\n|-\n| Tree under which King Bhunu was investigated || Manzini || 1898 || \"murder enquiry\" for killing a chief || ||\n|-\n| Site of Captain Gilson's House || Mbabane || || first Police Commissioner's House; companion of Sobhuza II || ||\n|}\nList of potential National Monuments\nA further twenty-nine sites have been identified as potential National Monuments:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"width:100%; background:#fff;\"\n|-\n!width=\"25%\" align=\"left\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\" | Site\n!width=\"15%\" align=\"left\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\" | Location\n!width=\"10%\" align=\"left\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\" | Date\n!width=\"25%\" align=\"left\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\" | Comments\n!width=\"15%\" align=\"left\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\" | Coordinates\n!width=\"10%\" align=\"left\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\" class=\"unsortable\"| Image\n|-\n| Allister Miller's House || Mbabane || || || ||\n|-\n| Mbabane Well, old bus rank || Mbabane || || || ||\n|-\n| Deputy Prime Minister's Offices and neighbouring building || || || || ||\n|-\n| Commandant's Residence (at Zakhele) || Manzini || || oldest building in Manzini || ||\n|-\n| Second Legco Building, Mbabane Magistrate's Court || Mbabane || || || ||\n|-\n| Notting Hill Mine Battery || near Piggs Peak || || || ||\n|-\n| Phophonyane Water Wheel || || || || ||\n|-\n| Swaziland National Office || || || || ||\n|-\n| Mahamba Church || || || oldest church in Swaziland || ||\n|-\n| Lamgangeni's Burial Site  || || || || ||\n|-\n| Prince Fanyana Memorial Library || Kwaluseni || || || ||\n|-\n| Mabuda Estates farm house || Siteki || || || ||\n|-\n| Khambi's stone || Entfonjeni || || || ||\n|-\n| Lion Cavern || Malolotja || || early mine || ||\n|-\n| Sibebe Rock || Mbuluzi River valley || || || ||\n|-\n| Emgwayiza || Malolotja || || Afromontane forest, green chert || ||\n|-\n| Mehluko Hill || || || old fortress || ||\n|-\n| Manzamnyama Falls near Zombodze II (site of Royal ceremony) || || || || ||\n|-\n| Mahamba Gorge  || || || || ||\n|-\n| Disused gold mines || || c.1880-1920s || including Piggs Peak mine || ||\n|-\n| Caves used by Swazi during wars || || || || ||\n|-\n| Great Usuthu (Lusuthu) Gorge || between Sidvokodvo and Siphofaneni || || || ||\n|-\n| Sites of the oldest Royal Residences || Shiselweni District || || || ||\n|-\n| Stone-built remains of Sotho-speaking clans || || || || ||\n|-\n| Endzeleni || Ngwemphisi Valley || || rock formations || ||\n|-\n| \"Oldest farm house\" || || || || ||\n|-\n| Balekane Mountain Fortress || || || || ||\n|-\n| Khubuta Mines || || || || ||\n|-\n| Von Steinacher's fort || Groenpan near Siteki || || || ||\n|}\nSee also\n* History of Swaziland\n* List of heritage registers\n* UNESCO General History of Africa\nReferences"
