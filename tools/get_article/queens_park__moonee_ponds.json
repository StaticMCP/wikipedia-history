On 20 August 1860, the Burke and Wills expedition camped here on their fateful journey to cross Australia.\nIn 1865, Baron Ferdinand Von Mueller (Director of the Melbourne Botanic Gardens) sent 250 specimens to Essendon Borough council, many of which were planted at Queens Park.\nDescription\nA picturesque cottage is the focal point of the park with its idyllic surrounds and public art pieces. A sealed path surrounds the lake where seats, and picnic tables are provided beneath old established native and exotic trees, with the lake a haven for a variety of birds. A tropical garden, sunken garden and native gardens are some of the many attractions of the park. Concerts and other entertainments are common on weekends.\nBotanic Collection\nThe park boasts an extensive botanic collection, including established Moreton Bay Figs, Bunya Pines and Hoop Pines. It also features a Cycad collection, several native/indigenous gardens, seasonal annual displays, and an Asian-styled garden.\nFacilities within the park\n* Moonee Ponds Bowling Club\n* Queens Park Pool\n* Queens Park Curator's Cottage Cafe\nFile:Fountain in Queens Park in Moonee Ponds, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.jpg|The fountain in Queens park\nFile:Queens Lake.jpg|Queens Lake\nFile:Queens Park, Moonee Ponds.jpg|A grassy area beside Pascoe Vale Road\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.mvcc.vic.gov.au Moonee Valley City Council]\n* [http://www.mvcc.vic.gov.au/experience-moonee-valley/parks-and-playgrounds/main-parks/queens-park.aspx Queens Park information]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080819190939/http://www.enet.org.au/historyonline/queens/queenspark.html History Of Queens Park]"
