Historically, San Antonio culture comes from a blend of Central Texas (Hill Country) and South Texas (Southwestern) culture. Founded as a Spanish outpost and the first civil settlement in Texas, San Antonio is heavily influenced by Mexican American culture due to Texas formerly being part of Mexico and, previously, the Spanish Empire. The city also has significant German, Anglo, and African American cultural influences. San Antonio offers a host of cultural institutions, events, restaurants and nightlife in South Texas for both residents and visitors alike.\nAnnual culture events\n* Bandera, just 40 miles northwest of San Antonio, hosts a three-day Cowboy Mardi Gras that attracts over 15 thousand people from all over the world to the town of 829 residents.\n* Celebrate San Antonio is the city's New Year's Eve celebration held on South Alamo Street adjacent to HemisFair Park.

As early as 1877, with the arrival of the railroad to San Antonio, there were reports of the unique, \"exotic\" culture in San Antonio. These reports were referring to Hispanics (Tejanos) who had been pushed by the dominant Germans (south and east San Antonio) and Anglos (north San Antonio) from the city's mainstream into the impoverished West Side - where there were feasts and fiestas, cockfights, and dancing. Some call this an early example of cultural appropriation, analogous to the relationship of Manhattan to Harlem. Urban designer Frederick Law Olmstead called San Antonio touristic gold, with its \"jumble of races, costumes, languages and building.\" And Mark Twain designated it as one of four unique American cities (also Boston, New Orleans, and San Francisco) because of its cultural melting pot, preserved history, and distinct identity.   San Antonio houses many tourist attractions, such as the San Antonio Aquarium, San Antonio Zoo, SeaWorld, and Six Flags Fiesta Texas. San Antonio's Spanish influence can be seen in the many historic sites across the city, such as the Alamo Mission, Mission Concepción, San Antonio River Walk, Mission San Francisco de la Espada, and Cathedral of San Fernando (San Antonio).\nSee also\n* Artist Foundation of San Antonio\n* Puroslam\n* San Antonio Symphony\n* San Antonio Japanese Tea Garden\n* Temple Beth-El (San Antonio, Texas)\n* University of Texas at San Antonio\n* University of Texas at San Antonio Libraries (UTSA Libraries)\n* Youth Orchestras of San Antonio\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20190110161658/http://www.sahearts.com/ Office of Cultural Affairs, City of San Antonio]\n*[http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utsa/00119/utsa-00119p1.html Preliminary Inventory of the Guadalupe Cultural Arts Center Records], University of Texas at San Antonio Libraries (UTSA Libraries) Special Collections."
