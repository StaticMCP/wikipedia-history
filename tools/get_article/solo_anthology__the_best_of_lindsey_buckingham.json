The album draws from all six of Buckingham's studio records at that time, spanning from 1981's Law and Order to 2011's Seeds We Sow. \"Hunger\" and \"Ride This Road\" were previously unreleased songs recorded in 2012. The most recent addition of the set is \"Sleeping Around the Corner\", from the 2017 duet album Lindsey Buckingham Christine McVie. Alternate editions of the set include an abridged single-disc version and a deluxe six-LP deluxe vinyl set.\nOne reviewer praised the contrast between some of Buckingham's more unusual material alongside some of his more commercial cuts potentially suitable for Fleetwood Mac, such as \"Love Runs Deeper\" and \"You Do or You Don't\". The unbalanced representation of Buckingham's solo records is criticized, noting that Out of the Cradle boasts eight tracks, while Law and Order has just one featured on the compilation.\nTrack listing\nAll tracks written by Lindsey Buckingham, except where noted.\nPersonnel\nMain artist\n* Lindsey Buckingham – guitars, bass, keyboards, percussion, drums, programming, lap harp, vocals\nAdditional musicians\n* Drums: Mick Fleetwood, Walfredo Reyes Jr., Michael Huey, Taku Hirano\n* Bass: George Hawkins, Bryant Simpson, John McVie, Larry Klein, Buell Neidlinger, Brett Tuggle\n* Keyboards: Mitchell Froom, Gordon Fordyce, Brett Tuggle, Lindsay Vannoy\n* Percussion: Alex Acuña, Mick Fleetwood, Gordon Fordyce, Walfredo Reyes, Taku Hirano\n* Rhythm guitars: Neale Heywood, Brett Tuggle (Disc 3)\n* Backing vocals: Neale Heywood, Brett Tuggle\nProduction\n* Producers: Lindsey Buckingham, Richard Dashut, Gordon Fordyce, Rob Cavallo, Mitchell Froom\n* Composers: Lindsey Buckingham, Kristen Buckingham, Richard Dashut, Cordelia Sipper, Gordon Fordyce, Lisa Dewey\n* Art direction: Rory Wilson\n* Design: Rory Wilson\n* Photography: Lindsey Buckingham, Kristen Buckingham, Richard Dashut, Deyo Glines, Scott Gruber, Sahil Mehta, John Russo, Kelly Sikkema, Rory Wilson\n* Remastering: Stephen Marcussen\n* Compilation: Lindsey Buckingham\n* Project supervisors: Bill Inglot, Jason Day\n* Project assistants: Susanne Savage, John Srebalus, Shannon Ward, Steve Wollard, Sheryl Farber\n* Product manager: Liuba Shapiro\n* Discographical annotation: Patrick Milligan\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
