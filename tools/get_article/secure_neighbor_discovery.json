NDP is insecure and susceptible to malicious interference. It is the intent of SEND to provide an alternate mechanism for securing NDP with a cryptographic method that is independent of IPsec, the original and inherent method of securing IPv6 communications.\nSEND uses Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) and other new NDP options for the ICMPv6 packet types used in NDP.\nSEND was updated to use the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) by RFC 6494 and RFC 6495 which define use of a SEND Certificate Profile utilizing a modified RFC 6487 RPKI Certificate Profile which must include a single RFC 3779 IP Address Delegation extension.\nThere have been concerns with algorithm agility vis-à-vis attacks on hash functions used by SEND expressed in RFC 6273, as CGA currently uses the SHA-1 hash algorithm and PKIX certificates and does not provide support for alternative hash algorithms.\nImplementations\n* [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios-xml/ios/sec_data_acl/configuration/15-2mt/ip6-send.html Cisco IOS 12.4(24)T and newer]\n* [http://mobisend.org/software.html Docomo USL SEND fork]\n* [https://sourceforge.net/projects/easy-send/ Easy-SEND]\n* [http://code.google.com/p/ipv6-send-cga/ ipv6-send-cga], Huawei and Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110811105850/http://amnesiak.org/NDprotector/ NDprotector], Telecom SudParis\n* [http://code.google.com/p/google-summer-of-code-2009-freebsd/downloads/detail?name=Ana_Kukec.tar.gz Native SeND kernel API]\n* [http://www.trustrouter.net/ TrustRouter]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110710143008/http://www.docomolabs-usa.com/lab_opensource.html USL SEND] (discontinued), NTT DoCoMo\n* [https://hpi.de/meinel/security-tech/next-generation-security-engineering/ipv6-security/winsend.html WinSEND]\nSee also\n* Neighbor Discovery Protocol\nReferences\n*\n*\n*"
