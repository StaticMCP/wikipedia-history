It was instituted in 1996, in memory of Paris C. Kanellakis, a computer scientist who died with his immediate family in an airplane crash in South America in 1995 (American Airlines Flight 965). The award is accompanied by a prize of $10,000 and is endowed by contributions from Kanellakis's parents, with additional financial support provided by four ACM Special Interest Groups (SIGACT, SIGDA, SIGMOD, and SIGPLAN), the ACM SIG Projects Fund, and individual contributions.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Winners\n!Citation\n|-\n|1996\n|Leonard Adleman, Whitfield Diffie, Martin Hellman, Ralph Merkle, Ronald Rivest, and Adi Shamir\n|For \"the conception and first effective realization of public-key cryptography\".\n|-\n|1997\n|Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv\n|For their pioneering work in data compression, leading to their LZ algorithm which \"yields the best compression rate achievable by finite-state encoders\" and \"can be found in virtually every modern computer\".\n|-\n|1998\n|Randal Bryant, Edmund M.
