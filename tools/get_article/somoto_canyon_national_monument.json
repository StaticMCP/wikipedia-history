The Somoto Canyon National Monument protected area covers an area of approximately , of which  are in the actual zone of the canyon.\nThe confluence of the Tapacalí and Comali Rivers at the head of the canyon form the Coco River, which flows through the canyon and onward  to the Caribbean Sea.\nThe Somoto Canyon was declared a national monument on November 29, 2006. The Somoto Canyon National Monument comprises one of 78 protected areas of Nicaragua and is managed by Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (MARENA).\nHistory\nThe Somoto Canyon had not been explored systematically until a group of scientists from the Czech Republic and Nicaragua (INETER) \"discovered\" the canyon in 2004. The canyon is believed to have formed 5 to 13 million years ago during the Miocene period. After its discovery in 2004, the Somoto Canyon has been developing into a tourist attraction, further helping the growth of tourism in Nicaragua. However, this has also had a negative effect with incidents such as graffiti being written on the walls of the Canyon since its discovery. MARENA and INETER send technicians to clean and repair the vandalism.\nSee also\n* Somoto\n* Tourism in Nicaragua\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.manfut.org/madriz/somotocanon.html Cañón de Somoto]"
