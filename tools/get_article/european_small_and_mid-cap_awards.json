A joint initiative of the European Commission, EuropeanIssuers, and the Federation of European Securities Exchanges, the ceremony was organised for the first time in 2013.\nBackground\nThe awards ceremony was organised for the first time in 2013 by EuropeanIssuers and the Federation of European Securities Exchanges (FESE), at the initiative of the Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry (now Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs) of the European Commission. FESE and EuropeanIssuers represent the European securities exchanges and their listed companies, respectively. The awards showcase the diversity of European markets, and aim to promote stock listings, and target SMEs and growth companies.\nThe awards affirm that listed SMEs are critical to EU's economic growth and the goals of job creation, competitiveness, and growth.\nSince 2020, the Awards are organised as part of the European Commission's SME Assembly.\nAwards Categories\nIn 2016, rebranded award categories were launched to include: International Star, Rising Star, Star of Innovation, and Star of 2016.\nSince 2017, a further category (Special Mention) was inaugurated.
