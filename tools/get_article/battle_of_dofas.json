The two towns had been major fighting grounds in the battle for the nearby city of Zinjibar since the militants seized the city the previous year.\nThe militants launched a three-pronged attack at dawn on three army brigades stationed the cities, first attacking from the east before opening another front on the north. Utilizing suicide bombers, car bombs, mortars, artillery and gunfire, the militants eventually managed to drive out the 39th Armoured Brigade from their cannon and artillery base in Dofas, where they seized troves of army equipment including heavy weaponry such as artillery and tanks which they turned on the soldiers. After reinforcements were sent from Aden, Yemeni forces under supervision of United States military advisors fought a five-hour battle with the militants before they withdrew.\nThe attack killed 185 soldiers, the most in a single engagement since the army began fighting Ansar al-Sharia. Many of the deaths were attributed to poor medical due to overfilled hospitals; many of the soldiers were treated in administrative offices and waiting rooms. A further 135 soldiers were wounded, while the militants, of whom 32 died in the attack, claimed to have fled with large supplies of military equipment, including one tank. The stolen equipment, along with 73 soldiers captured by the attackers, were displayed during a parade in the nearby Ansar al-Sharia-controlled city of Ja'ar. The soldiers were released by Ansar al-Sharia on 29 April.\nThe army defeat drew outrage from the Yemeni public and condemnation from the government and other international commentators. Protests in reaction to the attack called on the Yemeni government to remove and prosecute military officials loyal to ousted former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who were accused of negligence or outright collaboration with militants. Protesters and officials specifically accused Saleh loyalist Gen. Mahdi Maqula, the former commander for military forces in southern Yemen, of colluding with the militants due to losing his position days earlier.\nBackground\nDofas had been described as a major battle ground between forces of the AQAP linked-Ansar al-Sharia and the Yemeni government since Ansar al-Sharia seized the nearby town of Zinjibar, the capital of Abyan Governorate, in May 2011. In August 2011, the 39th Armoured Brigade began providing artillery support to forces battling in Zinjibar through its base in Dofas. Ansar al-Sharia forces took control of al-Kawd, a town close by to Dofas, in November 2011, and were still in control of it by the time of the attack.\nOn 25 February 2012, Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi was sworn in as the new President of Yemen, replacing the ousted Ali Abdullah Saleh. One of Hadi's first decisions in office was to replace Saleh loyalist Gen. Mahdi Maqula, the commander of military forces in southern Yemen and the leader of the 31th Armoured Brigade. Military officers had complained that Maqula had hindered the arrival of supplies to forces fighting the militants in Zinjibar. Maqula resisted the decision to replace him, maintaining that he had to be given the order by the influential Gen. Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar. Over the next week, ammunition and weapons from a military storehouse in the south, including a stockpile of sophisticated sniper scopes, had disappeared and were allegedly sold by Maqula and his fellow officers. Maqula eventually accepted the decision on 3 March, with Gen. Salem Ali Qatan being announced as his replacement. However, Maqula only stepped down on 4 March, just hours before the attack took place.\nPrior to the attack, Ansar al-Sharia leader Jalal Baleedi gave the Yemeni government a 10-day ultimatum to withdraw its forces from Zinjibar or else the group would launch a torrent of attacks.\nBattle\nOfficials believed that the attackers may have benefited from a sandstorm that blew across the region during the day and through the attack. According to eyewitnesses, military leaders had left the area just before the attack took place. The attack began at 04:00 local time as the soldiers were asleep in their tents. Ansar al-Sharia forces snuck behind the front lines and attacked from the rear where there was \"zero surveillance\" according to an official. Two suicide car bombers attacked the eastern gate of the 39th Armoured Brigade's cannon and artillery base at the al-Alam checkpoint in Dofas. The militants simultaneously opened fire on sleeping soldiers. Utilizing mortar and rocket attacks, the 39th Brigade was eventually too overwhelmed by the militants, retreating from their base and allowing the attackers to enter through the gate. Ansar al-Sharia forces seized armored vehicles, artillery pieces, assault rifles and rockets abandoned by the 39th Brigade. As many as 13 tanks were reportedly seized during the battle before Yemeni airstrikes destroyed several of them.\nAs army fire was drawn towards the east, a second assault was launched on the northern side of the base, targeting forces of the 115th and 119th Brigades stationed at al-Kawd. Ansar al-Sharia militants utilized weapons, vehicles and artillery left by the 39th Brigade to attack the soldiers. Leaders from the two brigades signalled for reinforcements from Aden, which eventually arrived at 10:00. An official said the “reinforcement response was too slow” to counter the second attack partly due to sandstorms in the area. The battle to regain the Dofas checkpoint lasted for five hours, with US military advisors directly supervising operation. Security forces received additional support from the Republican Guard and Special Forces. The Dofas base was eventually recaptured by security forces at 15:00.\nDuring the battle, Defense Minister Mohammed Nasser Ahmed reportedly ordered the Yemeni Air Force to send helicopters to evacuate the wounded, but the order was refused by air force commander Muhammed Saleh al-Ahmar, an ally and half brother of Saleh.\nLosses\nThe attack killed 185 government soldiers according to a military official. Many of the casualties were wounded soldiers who had succumbed to their injuries in an Aden military hospital due to a lack of proper medical care. Doctors were forced to treat some soldiers in administrative offices and waiting rooms in the hospital. 110 of the dead soldiers were located in the military hospital, while the other 75 were later found dumped in a nearby desert. Some of the bodies of soldiers recovered were missing their heads and bore multiple stab wounds. The military hospital morgue was so filled with bodies that some had to be stored in vegetable freezers in a military compound for lack of space. Two security officials told CNN that at least 135 soldiers were injured during the battle. Initial reports claimed that Ansar al-Sharia had captured 55 soldiers during the attack, but later statements by the group claimed that 73 were captured.\nAccording to the Associated Press, 32 Ansar al-Sharia militants were killed during the attack. The military indicated that airstrikes had destroyed equipment seized by Ansar al-Sharia, however the group wrote in a statement that they had seized a tank, anti-aircraft weapons, a rocket launcher, rockets, 11 Kalashnikov assault rifles, three military vehicles and \"a large amount of ammunition\". It also claimed that it had destroyed two tanks and burned an ammunition store.\nReactions\nThe attack resulted in a surge of accusations that Saleh loyalists in the military had been negligent, unwilling to or directly colluding with militants. In the days after the attack, tens of thousands of people protested in several Yemeni cities blaming Saleh-installed military commanders for the defeat, demanding that President Hadi prosecute them. Several officials, as well as Southern Movement leader Mohammad Badaib, alleged that Maqula had given the militants weapons which they used in the attack. During an interview with CNN, Maqula denied the accusations against him and other Saleh localists, stating that \"military units in the area need reinforcement.\"\nDuring a meeting with British Foreign Office minister for the Middle East and North Africa Alistair Burt, President Hadi renewed his pledge to combat the militants, saying \"the confrontation will continue until we are rid of the last terrorist, whether in Abyan or elsewhere.\" Presidential spokesperson Yahya al-Arassi said that \"the president is serious on combating al Qaeda. He knows the dangers they possess and will not stop until they are defeated.\" Gen. Qatan, Maqula's replacement, told his soldiers that the battle against Ansar al-Sharia had not started yet but that \"the coming days will be decisive and will teach them a harsh lesson.\"\nUS Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a statement condemning the \"heinous\" attack and expressing condolences to the victims, stating that it \"illustrates AQAP's complete disregard for human life\". She further wrote  \"the United States will continue to support President Hadi and the Yemeni people as they work to realize their aspirations for a brighter and more prosperous future.\" Pentagon Press Secretary George Little said the US was \"very concerned\" by the attack but also downplayed its importance, saying \"the Yemeni government has faced challenges in certain parts of the country for some time so I wouldn't necessarily read anything at this point into the stability of the Yemeni government.\" The United Nations Security Council and the European Union each published statements condemning the attack.\nAftermath\nOn 5 March, the militants hosted a parade in the streets of Ja'ar celebrating their victory and displaying their loot. Also displayed were the soldiers captured during the attack. On 7 March, Ansar al-Sharia released a statement threatening the lives of 73 soldiers they had captured during the attack unless its imprisoned members were released. The message urged relatives of the soldiers to lobby the US ambassador to Yemen and President Hadi on the soldiers behalves. Both Ansar al-Sharia and the International Committee of the Red Cross confirmed that a small team of medical personnel team had managed to gain permission from the militants to treat 12 soldiers at a makeshift hospital in Ja'ar. The soldiers were described as being in stable condition. On 19 April, France 24 released an exclusive video of its journalists in Ja'ar viewing the prisoners with permission of the militants. On 23 April, Ansar al-Sharia distributed posters and made statements across Abyan threatening to execute the soldiers in batches of 10 starting on 30 April. However, all 73 soldiers were released by the group on 29 April after a ceremony in Ja'ar attended by local journalists, tribal mediators, human rights activists and the soldiers' relatives as well as top militants leaders including Qasim al-Raymi. A statement released by the group stated that Nasir al-Wuhayshi had authorized the release after three days of negotiation with tribal elders and senior clerics including tribal sheikh Tariq al-Fadhli.\nSee also\n* 2012 Unity Day parade rehearsal bombing\n* 2012 Abyan offensive\nReferences"
