However, by 2013, most Lenin statues across Ukraine were still intact. During the 2013–2014 Euromaidan protests, the destruction of statues became widespread, a phenomenon that came to be popularly known as Leninopad (or Leninfall) in English. The use of \"-пад\" being akin to English words suffixed with \"fall\" as in \"waterfall\" and \"snowfall\".\nHistory\n\" was dismantled in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union and Ukraine re-gaining independence.]]\nThe demolition of Lenin monuments in Ukraine happened in four stages. During the 1990s, more than 2,000 Lenin monuments were demolished in western Ukraine, at the turn of the 1990–2000s more than 600 Lenin monuments were removed in western and central areas, in 2005–2008, more than 600 were demolished mainly in central areas, and in 2013–2014, 552 monuments were demolished.\nThe first wave of demolitions of Lenin monuments happened in Western Ukraine in 1990–1991. On 1 August 1990, in Chervonohrad a Lenin monument was demolished for the first time in the USSR. Under popular pressure the monument was dismantled, formally with the purpose of moving elsewhere. That same year, Lenin monuments were dismantled in Ternopil, Kolomyia, Nadvirna, Borislav, Drohobych, Lviv and other cities of Galicia.\nIn 1991, Ukraine had 5,500 Lenin monuments. In November 2015, approximately 1,300 Lenin monuments were still standing. More than 700 Lenin monuments were removed and/or destroyed between February 2014 and December 2015.\nOn 9 April 2015, the Ukrainian parliament passed legislation on decommunization. On 15 May 2015, President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko signed this bill into law that started a six-month period for the removal of communist monuments (excluding World War II monuments) and the mandatory renaming of settlements with names related to Communism.[http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2015/05/15/7068057/ Poroshenko signed the laws about decomunization] .

In between the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula by the Russian Federation and 28 September 2014, the largest Lenin monument at the unoccupied territory was standing in Kharkiv (20.2 m high). This statue of Lenin in Kharkiv was toppled and destroyed on 28 September 2014.\nIn February 2019, The Guardian reported that the two Lenin statues in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone were the only two remaining statues of Lenin in Ukraine, if not taking into account occupied territories of Ukraine. In January 2021 \"Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty\" located three more remaining Lenin statues in three (Ukrainian controlled) small villages. This increased the number of remaining Lenin statues to five.\nDuring the Russian invasion of Ukraine, many of these statues of Lenin, which had been taken down by Ukrainian activists, were re-erected by Russian occupiers in Russian-controlled areas.\nMotivation\nThe start of the \"Leninopad\" in its mass was laid by the demolition of the Lenin monument in Kyiv on the Bessarabian Square. The event took place on 8 December 2013 at around 6:00 pm. Even more people began to massively destroy monuments of the Soviet past after reports about the Euromaidan activists who died during the protests in Kyiv.\nIn January 2015, the Ministry of Culture of Ukraine announced that it would encourage all public initiatives related to cleaning Ukraine of monuments to figures of the communist past. According to Minister Vyacheslav Kyrylenko, his department will initiate the removal from the State Register of Immovable Monuments of Ukraine of all monuments related to communist figures listed there. \"The state will not oppose, but on the contrary, will in every possible way support all public initiatives that will fight for the cleansing of Ukraine from these relics of the totalitarian past,\" the minister emphasized.\nIn April 2015, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine voted in favor of the draft law \"On the condemnation of the communist and national socialist (Nazi) totalitarian regimes in Ukraine and the prohibition of propaganda of their symbols\", which, in particular, will oblige local authorities to dismantle monuments to communist figures on the territory of Ukraine.\nCommunist monuments toppled during Euromaidan\npetrovsk on 22 February 2014 with the demolished monuments to Vladimir Lenin.]]\nEuromaidan protesters toppled several statues of Vladimir Lenin in Ukrainian cities. Some estimates said that more than a hundred statues were toppled. In December 2015, The Ukrainian Week calculated that 376 Lenin monuments were removed or destroyed in February 2014.\nThis is a partial list:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! width=100px | Landmark !! width=120px | Location !! width=120px | Date !! width=100px | Status !!

In some cases, like in Kharkiv in early 2014, pro-Russian Ukrainian crowds protected the monuments, including members of the communist and socialist parties, as well as veterans of World War II and the Afghan wars. The statue of Lenin in Kharkiv was toppled on 28 September 2014. Late October 2014, then Kharkiv Governor Ihor Baluta admitted that he thought that the majority of Kharkiv residents had not wanted the statue removed, but said \"there was hardly any protest afterward either, which is quite telling\".\nIn January 2015, the Ministry of Culture of Ukraine announced that it would encourage any public initiatives related to the cleansing of Ukraine from \"relics of the totalitarian past\".|3=|4=}}\nSee also\n* List of statues of Vladimir Lenin\n* List of communist monuments in Ukraine\n* Decommunization in Ukraine\n* Derussification in Ukraine\n* Lustration in Ukraine\n* Demolition of monuments to Alexander Pushkin in Ukraine\n* Removal of Confederate monuments and memorials\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://leninstatues.ru/leninopad Map and lists of damaged monuments]\n* [http://raining-lenins.silk.co/ Raining Lenins]"
