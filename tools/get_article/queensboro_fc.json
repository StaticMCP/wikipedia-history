It was founded in November 2019, and unveiled an official crest and color scheme on October 6, 2020.\nIts men's team was originally announced as a 2021 expansion team in the USL Championship, the second division of professional soccer in the United States. However, their start date was moved from the 2021 season to the 2022 season, and later to the 2023 season, before being cancelled altogether.\nThe club did briefly field a women's team in the USL W League, a reserve team in the UPSL, and a youth team in the USL Academy.  The W League and UPSL teams withdrew from their respective leagues following the end of their 2022 seasons.\nThe men's team was removed from the USL website entirely as of November 2022, and it was reported that they were instead considering applying to play in the third division MLS Next Pro.\nBy the time New York City FC of Major League Soccer announced it had a deal to build a new stadium in Queens, Queensboro FC was reportedly defunct, with its website forwarding to an unrelated commercial site. It never fielded a senior men's team.\nColors and badge\n's distinctive purple]]\nThe club's badge was designed by the Carbone Smolan Agency, which also released a 110-page explainer document detailing the inspiration and design process.  The badge featured a distinctive shade of bright purple inspired by the color of the 7 train, crowned with an abstract depiction of the Queensboro Bridge in the shape of a crown.\nThe home uniform for QBFC's teams in the W League and UPSL was a purple-and-black striped jersey, paired with black shorts and socks.  The away uniform was a white jersey with a purple pattern, paired with white shorts and socks.  It was planned that the men's team would wear the same kits, had it actually taken the field.\nStadium\nThe women's and youth teams played at Aviator Sports and Events Center in the Marine Park neighborhood of southeast Brooklyn.\nOn April 27, 2021, the club announced plans to construct a 7,500-seat stadium on the campus of York College in Jamaica, Queens as a temporary home before building a permanent stadium elsewhere in the borough. With construction planned to start in summer 2022, it would have been the first soccer-specific stadium in New York City.  By June 2023, the proposed stadium had been \"nixed\" and York College had instead broken ground on its own soccer and track & field complex, on a different plot of campus land.\nMen's team\nHead coaches\nJosep Gombau was named the team's first head coach and sporting director on July 6, 2020. On June 8, 2022, with the team's debut already pushed back two years, he left to coach Odisha FC of the Indian Super League.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin-left: lem;\"\n!
