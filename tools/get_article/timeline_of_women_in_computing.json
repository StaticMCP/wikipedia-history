Clockwise from top left: Ada Lovelace, Betty Holberton, Radia Perlman, Audrey Tang, Gladys West, Katherine Johnson.\n}}\nThis is a timeline of women in computing. It covers the time when women worked as \"human computers\" and then as programmers of physical computers. Eventually, women programmers went on to write software, develop Internet technologies and other types of programming. Women have also been involved in computer science, various related types of engineering and computer hardware.\n18th century\n1757\n*Nicole-Reine Etable de la Brière Lepaute worked on a team of human computers to determine the next visit of Halley's Comet. The methods they developed have been used by successive human computing teams.\n19th century\n1842\n*Ada Lovelace was an analyst of Charles Babbage's analytical engine and is considered by many the \"first computer programmer\".\n1849\n*Maria Mitchell is hired by the U.S. Nautical Almanac Office to work as a computer on tables for the planet Venus.\n1875\n*Anna Winlock joined the Harvard computers, a group of women engaged in the production of astronomical data at Harvard.\n1893\n*Henrietta Swan Leavitt joined the Harvard \"computers\". She was instrumental in discovery of the cepheid variable stars, which are evidence for the expansion of the universe.\n20th century\n1916\n*Beatrice Cave-Brown-Cave went to work as a human computer for the Ministry of Munitions.\n1918\n*Women were hired to do ballistics calculations as human computers in Washington, D.C. The \"chief computer\" of the group was Elizabeth Webb Wilson.\n1920\n*Mary Clem leads the computing lab at Iowa State College.\n1921\n*Edith Clarke files a patent for a graphical calculator for problem solving electric power-line transmission problems.\n1926\n*Grete Hermann published the foundational paper for computerized algebra. It was her doctoral thesis, titled \"The Question of Finitely Many Steps in Polynomial Ideal Theory\", and published in Mathematische Annalen.\n1935\n*The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) which became NASA, hired a group of five women to work in their computer pool analyzing data from wind tunnels and flight tests.\n1939\n*The Austrian Johanna Piesch published two pioneering papers on switching algebra.\n1940\n*American women were recruited to do ballistics calculations and program computers during WWII. Around 1943–1945, these women \"computers\" used a differential analyzer in the basement of the Moore School of Electrical Engineering to speed up their calculations, though the machine required a mechanic to be totally accurate and the women often rechecked the calculations by hand. Phyllis Fox ran a differential analyzer single-handedly, with differential equations as her program specification.\n1941\n*Mavis Batey broke the Italian Naval code while working at Bletchley Park.\n*The United States begins recruiting African-American college graduates to work at Langley Air Force Base as human computers.\n1942\n*On 11 August, Hedy Lamarr and co-inventor, George Antheil, received their patent for frequency hopping.\n1943\nand Frances Spence setting up the ENIAC|alt=Jean Bartik and Frances Spence setting up the ENIAC.|300x300px]]\n*Women worked as WREN Colossus operators during WW2 at Bletchley Park.\n*Wives of scientists working on the Manhattan Project with mathematical training were hired as human computers to work on the ENIAC and MANIAC I computers.

Adele Goldstine, also involved in the programming, wrote the program manual for the ENIAC.\n1947\n*Irma Wyman worked on a missile guidance project at the Willow Run Research Center.
