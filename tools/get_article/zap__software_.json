When used as a proxy server it allows the user to manipulate all of the traffic that passes through it, including HTTPS encrypted traffic. It can also run in a daemon mode which is then controlled via a REST-based API.\nHistory\nZAP was originally forked from Paros which was developed by Chinotec Technologies Company. Simon Bennetts, the project lead, stated in 2014 that only 20% of ZAP's source code was still from Paros.\nThe first release was announced on Bugtraq in September 2010, and became an OWASP project a few months later. In 2023, ZAP developers moved to the Linux Foundation, where they became a part of the Software Security Project. As of September 24, 2024, all of the main developers joined Checkmarx as employees and ZAP was rebranded as ZAP by Checkmarx.\nZAP was listed in the 2015 InfoWorld Bossie award for The best open source networking and security software.\nFeatures\nSome of the built in features include:\n* An intercepting proxy server,\n* Traditional and AJAX Web crawlers\n* An automated scanner\n* A passive scanner\n* Forced browsing\n* A fuzzer\n* WebSocket support\n* Scripting languages\n* Plug-n-Hack support\nSee also\n* Web application security\n* Burp suite\n* W3af\n* Fiddler (software)\nFurther reading\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.zaproxy.org/ Official website]"
