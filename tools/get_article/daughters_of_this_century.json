Most of the critics stated that Sinha failed to weave a strong screenplay. The performance of the cast was well-appreciated. It was screened at 28th International Film Festival of India held in Thiruvananthapuram, in 1997. At the Cairo International Film Festival in 2001, the film was screened without the last segment featuring Madhuri Dixit, because of time-constraint, and was nominated for Golden Pyramid Award. In the same year, it was re-released in India.\nPlot\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = Kadambini, the widowed sister-in-law of Shardashankar, the landlord of Ranihat is very affectionate towards his son Manik.
