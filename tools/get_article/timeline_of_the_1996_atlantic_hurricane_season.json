These major hurricanes were Bertha, Edouard, Fran, Hortense, Isidore, and Lili. This timeline documents all the storm formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipation. The timeline also includes information that was not operationally released, meaning that information from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as information on a storm that was not operationally warned on, has been included. The season officially began on June 1, 1996, and ended on November 30 that same year.\nThe season's most destructive storms were Hurricane Cesar, Hurricane Fran, and Hurricane Hortense. Hurricane Cesar (later known as Hurricane Douglas in the Eastern Pacific basin) was the deadliest storm of the season; it killed at least 51 people and caused severe damage in northern Colombia and southern Central America. Hurricane Fran caused $3.2&nbsp;billion (1996 USD) worth of damage in the United States, mostly in North Carolina, and killed 26 people. Hurricane Hortense dropped torrential rainfall on southwestern Puerto Rico and the eastern Dominican Republic, killing 21 people and leaving behind $127&nbsp;million (1996 USD) in damage. All three storms had their names retired by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 1997, and were replaced with Cristobal, Fay, and Hanna for the 2002 season, respectively.\nBy convention, meteorologists use one time zone when issuing forecasts and making observations: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and also use the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight&nbsp;UTC). The National Hurricane Center uses both UTC&nbsp;and the time zone where the center of the tropical cyclone is currently located. The time zones utilized (east to west) prior to 2020 were: Atlantic, Eastern, and Central. In this timeline, all information is listed by UTC first with the respective regional time included in parentheses. Additionally, figures for maximum sustained winds and position estimates are rounded to the nearest 5&nbsp;units (knots, miles, or kilometers), following the convention used in the National Hurricane Center's products. Direct wind observations are rounded to the nearest whole number. Atmospheric pressures are listed to the nearest millibar and nearest hundredth of an inch of mercury.\nTimeline of storms\nJune\n;June 1\n*The 1996 Atlantic hurricane season officially begins.\n;June 17\non June 19]]\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;pm EDT) at  The first tropical depression of the season forms near eastern Grand Bahama.\n;June 19\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;pm EDT, June&nbsp;18) at  The tropical depression strengthens into Tropical Storm Arthur about 245&nbsp;miles (400&nbsp;km) south-southwest of Cape Lookout, North Carolina.\n*12:00&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;am EDT) at  Tropical Storm Arthur reaches peak winds of 45&nbsp;mph (75&nbsp;km/h) about 130&nbsp;miles (215&nbsp;km) southwest of Cape Lookout, North Carolina.\n;June 20\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;pm EDT, June&nbsp;19) at  Tropical Storm Arthur makes landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina with winds of 40&nbsp;mph (65&nbsp;km/h) and a barometric pressure of .\n*12:00&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;am EDT) at  Tropical Storm Arthur weakens into a tropical depression about 115&nbsp;miles (185&nbsp;km) northeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.\n;June 21\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;am EDT) at  Tropical Depression Arthur reaches a minimum barometric pressure of  about 355&nbsp;miles (575&nbsp;km) north-northwest of Bermuda.\n*12:00&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;am EDT) at  Tropical Depression Arthur transitions into an extratropical gale about 405&nbsp;miles (650&nbsp;km) north-northeast of Bermuda.\nJuly\n;July 5\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;pm AST, July&nbsp;4) at  The second tropical depression of the season forms about 790&nbsp;miles (1,270&nbsp;km) southwest of Cape Verde.\n*12:00&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;am AST) at  The tropical depression strengthens into Tropical Storm Bertha about 1,070&nbsp;miles (1,725&nbsp;km) west-southwest of Cape Verde.\n;July 7\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;pm AST) at  Tropical Storm Bertha strengthens into a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane about 220&nbsp;miles (350&nbsp;km) east of Antigua.\n;July 9\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;am EDT) at  Hurricane Bertha rapidly strengthens to Category&nbsp;3 intensity, skipping Category&nbsp;2 status, about 140&nbsp;miles (220&nbsp;km/h) north of Puerto Rico, making it the first major hurricane of the season.
