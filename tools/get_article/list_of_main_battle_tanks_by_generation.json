Typically, generations are defined either by the time of their introduction or technological advancements, such as new armour technologies, the introduction of new electronic sub-systems and more powerful guns.\nDefinition of main battle tank generations\nThe fundamental issue with classifying main battle tanks into generations is the lack of a common, internationally accepted definition. Different attempts to define main battle tanks have been made by authors, historians and militaries in the past, many of which co-exist to this day.\nThe Canadian Army Command & Staff College developed a system to classify Western main battle tanks in three different generations (Soviet/Russian ones are not covered). Tanks such as the Chieftain, Leopard 1, M48 and M60 are considered first generation MBTs, while the Challenger 1, Leopard 2 and M1 Abrams are considered second generation ones. Digital tanks such as the Leclerc, Leopard 2A5 and M1A2 Abrams are considered third generation tanks.\nThe military of the People's Republic of China also recognizes three generations of its own tanks.\nIn his 1983 book, Rolf Hilmes describes three generations of post-war main battle tanks. In his system for the classification of main battle tanks, the first generation of MBTs was roughly being fielded between 1950 and 1960, the second generation roughly between 1960 and 1970, and the third generation starting in 1980 with a predicted end by 1990.\nIn Hilmes' system, older tanks cannot reach higher generations via upgrades even when these upgrades include all characteristics defining the newer generations. Instead, heavily upgraded tanks belong to so-called intermediate generations (Zwischengenerationen) with the first, ranging from 1970 to 1980, containing upgraded second generation MBTs (e.g. M60A2, Leopard 1A4) as well as new MBTs produced during that time frame (e.g. the T-64, Merkava and TAM) which lack some of the features defining the third generation. The first generation of main battle tanks was based on or influenced by designs of World War II, most notably the Soviet T-34. The second generation was equipped with NBC protection systems, night-vision devices, a stabilized main gun and at least a mechanical fire-control system. The third generation is in Western parlance determined by the usage of thermal imagers, improved fire-control systems and special armour.\nHowever, Hilmes acknowledged that tanks cannot be definitively grouped by generations, as each tank-producing country develops and introduces its tanks in tune with its own ideas and needs. He also states that breakdown of postwar tanks by generations is based on timeframe and technical factors, as a basis for further discussion.\nBy 2007, Hilmes saw a fourth generation of post-war main battle tanks (containing certain tanks fielded in 1990 to 2000) and predicted a fifth (expected to appear by 2010). Defining characteristics of the fourth generation are autoloaders, adapted modular armour, battlefield managements systems and improved digital electronics, more powerful guns, night sights (passive or thermal imagers) for the commander's independent periscope and often hydropneumatic suspensions. Additionally, a third intermediate generation (1990 to 2000) was established in his system, containing tanks like the Leopard 2A5, the PT-91 Twardy and the T-90.\nIn the late 1990s, the Russian author Gennady Lvovich Kholyavsky describes a total of five generations of main battle tanks; with the first starting in 1920 and lasting to the end of World War 2, followed by the second generation covering 1946 to 1960, the third generation lasting from 1961 to 1980 and a fourth generation starting in 1981. As per Kholyavsky, no Russian fourth generation tank was fielded by 1998, but the Challenger 2, the M1A2 Abrams, and Leopard 2A6 can be considered fourth generation tanks. Despite not providing an official end for the fourth generation, the Leclerc was considered a fifth generation main battle tank.\nAs per Rafał Kopeć from the University of the National Education Commission, Krakow no fourth generation tank had already been fielded by 2016, suggesting that all earlier tanks belong to the earlier three generations based on the system he used for classification. In addition to the three main generations, tanks like the T-64, T-72 and Merkava belong to a generation \"two plus\" according to Kopeć. In a similar fashion, a generation \"three plus\" consisting of never fielded prototypes with 140–152&nbsp;mm guns is defined.\nIn their 2010 book, the Hungarian authors Ernő Hegedűs and Károly Turcsányi define four generations of main battle tanks. The first generation of main battle tanks  has no autoloader, a conventional propulsion system with diesel engine and layered armour. This generation includes tanks like the Challenger and Leopard 2. The second generation of main battle tanks has a similar set-up with layered armour, conventional diesel propulsion systems but features and autoloader; it includes tanks such as the Leclerc and T-72. The third generation of MBTs like the second but uses a conventional propulsion system with a gas turbine instead of a diesel; it includes the T-80, the HSTV(L) and the Stridsvagn 103. Hegedűs and Turcsányi define a fourth generation of main battle tanks, utilizing composite materials in their construction, gas turbines and electromagnetic weapons, with the ACAV-P and FCS-T being examples of implementations of fourth generation tank technologies.\nLike Hilmes, military historian Hptm Marc Lenzin, Oberst Peter Forster, Div Fred Heer and Hptm Stefan Bühler from the Swiss Army recognise five generations of post-war main battle tanks, as well as a further four Zwischengenerationen consisting of upgraded versions of older main battle tanks. Tanks are categorised by generation based solely on the rough date of their introduction into service rather than on technical aspects of their design. The first generation covers tanks introduced between 1950 and 1960; the second generation, between 1960 and 1980. The third generation covers tanks introduced between 1980 and 1990, followed by the fourth generation, which lasted from 1990 to 2010. The fifth generation of main battle tanks has been in production since 2010.\nFirst Generation\nThe first generation of \"universal tanks\" or \"main battle tanks\", Those tanks are usually Medium battle tanks that turned out to match or outmatch the heavy battle tank in protection and/or firepower, leading them to fill multiple roles.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sticky-header\"\n!scope=\"col\"| Name\n!Year first built\n!scope=\"col\"| Year entered service\n!scope=\"col\"| Origin\n!scope=\"col\"| No. built\n!scope=\"col\"| Mass (tonnes)\n!scope=\"col\"| Engine power\n!scope=\"col\"| Range\n!scope=\"col\" style=width:20em | Notes\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | Centurion\n|1945&nbsp;(Mk&nbsp;1)\n| 1946&nbsp;(Mk&nbsp;2)1948&nbsp;(Mk&nbsp;3)1955&nbsp;(Mk&nbsp;5)\n|\n| 4,423\n| 51 t\n| 650&nbsp;hp\n| 52–100&nbsp;km\n| First \"Universal Tank\" (MBT) Culmination of the WWII cruiser tanks.\n|-\n|\n| 1953&nbsp;(C&nbsp;III)1955&nbsp;(C&nbsp;V)1958&nbsp;(C&nbsp;X)\n|\n| 110\n| 51–53 t\n| 650&nbsp;hp\n| 52–100&nbsp;km\n| Strv 81 and 101 were the Swedish designations fitted with Swedish machine guns and instruments.\n|-\n|\n|1958&nbsp;(Pz55)1976&nbsp;(Pz57)\n|\n|100\n12\n|52 t\n|650&nbsp;hp\n|52–100&nbsp;km\n|Panzer 55 and 57/60 were the Swiss designations.\n|-\n|\n| 1960&nbsp;(Meteor)1970&nbsp;(Kal&nbsp;Alef)1975&nbsp;(Kal&nbsp;Bet)1980&nbsp;(Kal&nbsp;Gimel)c.1985&nbsp;(Kal&nbsp;Dalet)\n|\n| 390\n| 51 t\n| 650&nbsp;hp\n| 52–100&nbsp;km\n| Sho't is the Israeli designation of the 105 mm L7 armed Centurion tank.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | T-54\n|1945&nbsp;(T54)\n| 1947&nbsp;(T54)1955&nbsp;(T54A)1957&nbsp;(T54B)\n|\n| 35,000\n| 36 t\n| 520&nbsp;hp\n| 330–440&nbsp;km\n| USSR's First Generation of MBT.\n|-\n|\n| 1956&nbsp;(T54/T54A)\n|\n| 3,000\n| 36 t\n| 520&nbsp;hp\n| 330–440&nbsp;km\n| Produced under license in Poland.\n|-\n|\n| 1957&nbsp;(T54A)\n|\n| 2,700\n| 36 t\n| 520&nbsp;hp\n| 330–440&nbsp;km\n| T-54A produced under license in Czechoslovakia.\n|-\n| Type 59\n|\n| 1959&nbsp;(T54A)\n|\n| 13,000\n| 36 t\n| 520&nbsp;hp\n| 450–600&nbsp;km\n| Chinese-produced version of the Soviet T-54A tank.\n|-\n| M48 Patton\n|1951 (T48)\n| 1952 1953&nbsp;(A1) 1955&nbsp;(A2) 1957&nbsp;(A3)\n1975 (A5)\n|\n| 12,000\n| 45–49 t\n| 750–825&nbsp;hp\n| 110–480&nbsp;km\n| A further development of the M47 Patton tank.

With the improvement of the ammunition, mainly the HEAT rounds, the thick protection was rendered useless unless the thickness was increased beyond their mobile capacity. The doctrine was then changed to focus more on the mobility and reduced the protection a lot. This generation was also marked by the utilisation of Night vision, new advanced ammunition such as the APDS, HEAT, HESH and later the APFSDS and also by the NBC capacity.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sticky-header\"\n!scope=\"col\"| Name\n!Year first built\n! scope=\"col\" | Year entered service\n!scope=\"col\"| Origin\n!scope=\"col\"| No. built\n!scope=\"col\"| Mass (tonnes)\n!scope=\"col\"| Engine power\n!scope=\"col\"| Range\n!scope=\"col\" style=width:20em | Notes\n|-\n| M60\n|\n| 1959 1962&nbsp;(A1) 1973&nbsp;(A2) 1978&nbsp;(A3)\n|\n| 15,000+\n| 46–49.5 t\n| 750&nbsp;hp\n| 450–500&nbsp;km\n| A development of the M48 Patton.

The second generation MBTs have better sights in comparison to the first generation MBTs. Also second generation MBTs were the first ones to use laser sights and APFSDS rounds. The third generation consists of tanks armed with high caliber and velocity guns like M1A1 Abrams. Third generation tanks also use composite armour as well as armour made out of highly resistant sintered ceramic materials. Third generation tanks also have full stabilization system for the main gun. There are tanks between second and third generations, like Soviet T-72 which has powerful gun which would classify it as a third generation MBT but at the same time the stabilization system is much too primitive for it to a third generation MBT. It also lacks engine power to be a third generation MBT and has ammunition with less quality.\"\nCitations\nGeneral and cited references\n*\n*\n*"
