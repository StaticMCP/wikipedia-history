The fights lasted until 2 July 1823, when the Bahian victory was finally proclaimed. In January 1823, Itaparica Island was the scene of the Battle of Itaparica, a Brazilian triumph that was fundamental to victory in the war.\nCommanded by Antônio de Sousa Lima, the soldiers of the Itaparica Battalion defended the island from the desperate attack of the Portuguese, using a defensive system that began at the São Lourenço Fort, and continued with trenches mounted in strategic places, manned by soldiers. and small cannon pieces, such as Largo da Quitanda, Fonte da Bica, and Praia da Convento, as well as the beaches of Amoreiras, Mocambo, Manguinhos, and Porto dos Santos, among others.\nOn the Portuguese side, João Félix Pereira de Campos was the commander of the Portuguese fleet in Bahia, 42 vessels of different sizes were involved in this attack, which resulted in a shameful defeat for Portuguese soldiers and sailors. According to Pereira de Campos' letters, which they attributed to the fact that there was a garrison made up of an unexpected number of people and the \"way of defending\" against the forces of the island of Itaparica.\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography"
