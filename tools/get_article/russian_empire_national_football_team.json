The All-Russian Football Union was founded in January 1912 and it was admitted to FIFA in the same year. The first official international for the team was the second round match against Finland national team at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, with the Finns competing separately despite being a part of Russia at the time.\nThe development of league football in Russia was stopped by the outbreak of First World War in 1914. Meetings with the Germany national team and France national team were planned for the spring of 1915, but the matches were cancelled. A large number of players were killed in the war and others fled the country after the 1917 October Revolution. The Soviet Union national football team was formed in August 1923 and it was accepted by FIFA as the successor of the Russian Empire football team, itself becoming the Russia national football team in 1992.\nManagers\n* Georges Duperron (1910–1913)\n* Robert Fulda (1914)\nCompetitive record\nOlympic Games\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!colspan=11|Olympic Games record\n|-\n!Year\n!Result\n!Position\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!Squad\n|-\n| 1896||colspan=9|No football tournament was held\n|-\n| 1900||colspan=9 rowspan=3|did not enter\n|-\n| 1904\n|-\n| 1908\n|-\n| 1912||Second round||11th||2||0||0||2||1||18||Squad\n|-\n!Total\n!Second round\n!1/4\n!2\n!0\n!0\n!2\n!1\n!18\n!—\n|}\nInternational record\nThe Russian Empire national football team played a total number of 8 official and 8 unofficial internationals between October 1910 and July 1914.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Date\n!Location\n!Venue\n!Competition\n!Opponent\n!Score (1)\n|-\n| 16 October 1910 || Saint Petersburg, Russia || Sport Stadium || Unofficial match ||  || align=center |5–4\n|-\n| 23 October 1910 || Moscow, Russia || ZKS Stadium || Unofficial match ||  || align=center |1–0\n|-\n| 2 September 1911 || Saint Petersburg, Russia || Nevsky Stadium || Unofficial match ||  || align=center |0–14\n|-\n| 3 September 1911 || Saint Petersburg, Russia || Nevsky Stadium || Unofficial match ||  || align=center |0–7\n|-\n| 4 September 1911 || Saint Petersburg, Russia || Nevsky Stadium || Unofficial match ||  || align=center |0–11\n|-\n| 6 May 1912 || Moscow, Russia || Union Golf Club || Unofficial match ||  Finland || align=center |1–1\n|-\n| 30 June 1912 || Stockholm, Sweden || Olympic Stadium || Summer Olympics ||  Finland || align=center |1–2\n|-\n| 1 July 1912 || Stockholm, Sweden || Olympic Stadium || Summer Olympics ||  || align=center |0–16\n|-\n| 3 July 1912 || Stockholm, Sweden || Tranebergs Idrottsplats || Friendly match ||  || align=center |1–2\n|-\n| 12 July 1912 || Moscow, Russia || Sokolniki Park || Unofficial match ||  || align=center |0–9\n|-\n| 14 July 1912 || Moscow, Russia || Sokolniki Park || Friendly match ||  || align=center |0–12\n|-\n| 29 April 1913 || Saint Petersburg, Russia || Nevsky Stadium || Unofficial match ||  || align=center |1–5\n|-\n| 4 May 1913 || Moscow, Russia || Sokolniki Park || Friendly match ||  || align=center |1–4\n|-\n| 14 September 1913 || Moscow, Russia || Sokolniki Park || Friendly match ||  || align=center |1–1\n|-\n| 5 July 1914 || Stockholm, Sweden || Olympic Stadium || Friendly match ||  || align=center |2–2\n|-\n| 12 July 1914 || Christiania, Norway || Bislett || Friendly match ||  || align=center |1–1\n|}\n(1) Russian Empire's score is shown first.\nHead-to-head record\nUp to matches played on 12 July 1914.\n''\n|team2=ENG|name_ENG=\n|team3=FIN|name_FIN= Finland\n|team4=GER|name_GER=\n|team5=HUN|name_HUN=\n|team6=NOR|name_NOR=\n|team7=SWE|name_SWE=\n|win_BOH=2|draw_BOH=0|loss_BOH=0|gf_BOH=6|ga_BOH=4\n|win_ENG=0|draw_ENG=0|loss_ENG=3|gf_ENG=0|ga_ENG=32\n|win_FIN=0|draw_FIN=1|loss_FIN=1|gf_FIN=2|ga_FIN=3\n|win_GER=0|draw_GER=0|loss_GER=1|gf_GER=0|ga_GER=16\n|win_HUN=0|draw_HUN=0|loss_HUN=2|gf_HUN=0|ga_HUN=21\n|win_NOR=0|draw_NOR=2|loss_NOR=1|gf_NOR=3|ga_NOR=4\n|win_SWE=0|draw_SWE=1|loss_SWE=2|gf_SWE=4|ga_SWE=11\n|update=complete|source=Results\n}}\nPlayer records\nPlayer records include official internationals only.\nMost capped players\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=\"30\"|Rank\n!
