The main block, a -story wood-frame structure was probably built sometime in the early 18th century, and has long been a landmark in the Perryville village, receiving its name in the early 19th century. It is distinctive for period houses because of its asymmetrical facade, and was carefully restored in the late 1980s.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Washington County, Rhode Island\nReferences"
