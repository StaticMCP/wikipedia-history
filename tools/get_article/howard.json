      "text": "# Howard\n\nHoward is a masculine given name derived from the English surname Howard. The Oxford Dictionary of English Christian Names notes that \"the use of this surname as a christian name is quite recent and there seems to be no particular reason for it except that it is the name of several noble families\". The surname has a number of possible origins; in the case of the noble family, the likely source is the Norse given name Hávarðr, composed of the elements há (\"high\") and varðr (\"guardian\").\nDiminutives include Howie and Ward. Howard reached peak popularity in the United States in the 1920s, when it ranked as the 26th most popular boys' name. As of 2018, it had fallen to 968th place.\nPeople with the given name\n* Howard Allen (1949–2020), American serial killer\n* Howard Duane Allman (1946–1971), American guitar virtuoso\n* Howard Anderson (disambiguation), name of several people\n* Howard Andrew (1934–2021), American poker player\n* Howard Ashman (1950–1991), American playwright, lyricist and stage director\n* Howard Baker (disambiguation), name of several people\n* Howard Berman (born 1941), American attorney and politician\n* Howard Bragman (1956–2023), American crisis manager and publicist\n* Howard W.
