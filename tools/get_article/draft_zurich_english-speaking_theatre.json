Founded in 1954, it is one of the oldest English-speaking theatre organizations in the country. The group is run entirely by volunteers and operates on a fully amateur basis.\nHistory\nThe organization was founded in 1954 as the Zurich Comedy Club. For decades, the group focused primarily on comedic productions, building a reputation for light-hearted and entertaining performances. Over the years, the club expanded its repertoire to include a wider variety of genres, including dramas, musicals, and original works. In 2011, to reflect its broader focus on all forms of theatre, the organization rebranded as Zurich English-Speaking Theatre (ZEST). The founder of a prominent local theatre company, Courtney Beamish of White Rabbit Theatre Company, previously served on the board for ZEST, a testament to its role in the Zurich theatre scene.\nProductions and Events\nZEST produces at least two major public productions each year, which typically run for two weeks in the spring and winter. The productions are staged in various venues across Zurich. The group's performance history includes a diverse range of genres, from classic dramas and contemporary comedies to full-scale musicals. In 2019, under its former name, the Zurich Comedy Club presented a well-received production of \"A Night in Provence\".\nIn addition to its main productions, ZEST hosts a variety of ongoing events for its members and the public:\n* Monday Readings: Weekly sessions where members read and analyse scripts.\n* TheatreLAB: A series of smaller, more experimental productions designed to showcase new talent and original works.\n* Workshops: Regular sessions focused on developing acting, stagecraft, and other theatrical skills.\nCommunity and Funding\nZEST operates on a fully amateur and self-funded basis. All actors, directors, and production staff contribute their time on a volunteer basis, and the organization does not receive government subsidies or corporate sponsorship. Its primary source of funding is from ticket sales, memberships, and program advertising.\nThe organization's volunteer-driven model has allowed it to achieve a significant charitable impact. As of 2024, ZEST has donated over 350,000 CHF to various local and international charities. In one notable instance, the group donated 13,000 CHF to the Cancer League Zurich, which was highlighted in the organization's official bulletin. The group's members represent a diverse, multinational community, with individuals from over 30 countries participating in its productions and events.\nReferences"
