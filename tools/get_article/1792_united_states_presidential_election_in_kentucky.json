The voters chose four representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President. It was the first presidential election Kentucky participated in since being admitted to the Union on June 1, 1792.\nKentucky cast four electoral votes for the Independent candidate and incumbent President George Washington, as he ran effectively unopposed. The electoral votes for Vice president were cast for Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson from Virginia, the only state to do so. The state was divided into four electoral districts with one elector each, whereupon each district's voters chose the electors.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1792 United States presidential election in Kentucky\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#F0F071; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Independent\n| George Washington (incumbent)\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | 4\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Totals\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | 4\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Kentucky\nReferences"
