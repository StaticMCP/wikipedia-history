In 1967, black Newark, New Jersey taxi driver John Smith was arrested for a traffic violation and allegedly beaten and killed, precipitating the 1967 Newark riots. ''Revolution '67'' details Newark's reaction to the incident.\n''Revolution '67 was produced, directed, shot and edited by Marylou and Jerome Bongiorno and was aired on PBS as part of its Point of View series.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.bongiornoproductions.com/REVOLUTION_67/REVOLUTION_67.html Revolution '67''] - Film's website\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070321223702/http://www.pbs.org/pov/pov2007/revolution67/index.html P.O.V.
