The company was one of three different railways that were awarded operation franchise rights to run cars in James Street.\nThe line commenced in James Street where it ran to Hawley Avenue, Green, Lodi and Willow. The tracks in East Water street were laid by the Genesee and Water Street Railroad and were acquired by the road later that year.\nReferences"
