During this time there were eight heads of state, all from the ranks of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (SKJ). The federal party was organized into six sub-organizations - the republic parties, one for each of the six federal republics. Kosovan politicians and presidents of the assembly of the period were members of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia through their membership in the League of Communists of Kosovo (SKK), the Kosovan part of the federal party (as was respectively the case with all Yugoslav politicians).\n;Party\n|KPK/SKK|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! #\n!
