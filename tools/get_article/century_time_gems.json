      "text": "# Century Time Gems\n\nCentury Time Gems Ltd was founded on January 5, 1966, by Hans-Ulrich Klingenberg, the first day upon the abolition of the \"Statut horloger\", which had prohibited the entry of newcomers into the watch industry in Switzerland for almost 40 years.\nVacuum Chronometer Corporation\nThe company was initially called Vacuum Chronometer Corp., which manufactured vacuum watches (sold under several well-known trademarks), of his own invention: the air being the vector of moisture and all impurities as well as of temperature differences that impair the automatic movements' chronometer precision, Klingenberg had devised a watchcase, where a void of 80% could be created and maintained. According to the International Watch Marketing Director of luxury brand Cartier, Thierry Lamouroux, the efficiency of a watch is not improved until 99% of the air is removed from the case.\nFurthering his vision of the perfected watch, Klingenberg soon started manufacturing such cases in boron carbide, followed by sapphire (corundum).\nThe Century Timepiece\nUpon the advance of quartz movements, vacuum automatic watches became much less in demand. But, being less bulky, quartz movements offered Klingenberg the opportunity to finally realize his perfect watch, creating a monolithic diamond-facetted watchcase of sapphire, applying another of his patents.\nLocated previously in Biel/Bienne, the company is now established in nearby Nidau, still in his family's hands, led by one of his sons.\nThe company is a full-fledged member of the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry FH.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.fhs.ch/en/news/news.php?id=224 Century Time Gems - Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry FH]\n* [http://www.goldbulletin.org/assets/file/goldbulletin/downloads/Trueb_1_33.pdf] (p.&nbsp;22) - [http://www.goldbulletin.org/ Gold Bulletin] journal"
