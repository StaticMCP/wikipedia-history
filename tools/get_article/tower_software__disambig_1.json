The company provided and supported enterprise content management software, notably its TRIM product line for electronic records management.\nTOWER Software was acquired by Hewlett-Packard Company in 2008 as a part of its HP Software Division.\nHistory\nTOWER Software began making records management software in 1985. It shifted to providing electronic document and records management software with the introduction of TRIM Captura in 1998. TRIM Context was released in 2002. In 2004 the company re-branded itself as a provider of enterprise content management solutions.\nTOWER Software contributed to the development of international and local standards by sitting on a working group to develop AS4390 (the Australian standard for records management), which influenced the ISO 15489 standard, and by reviewing the MoReq and DoD 5015.2 standards.\nIn April 2008, TOWER Software shareholders were advised of the company's intention to accept an offer by Hewlett-Packard to acquire the company for approximately US$105 million. At that time, TOWER Software had 1000 customers in 32 countries representing the public sector and highly regulated industries such as healthcare, energy and utilities, and banking and finance.\nTRIM Context is now called HP TRIM Records Management System software and is based on the ISO standard 15489 for records management. TRIM software also has U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) 5015.2 certification and adheres to the principles outlined in AS4390.\nRecognition and awards\n*   KMWorld Readers' Choice Award 2006\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20150226064619/http://www8.hp.com/us/en/software/enterprise-software.html HP Software website]\n*[http://www.naa.gov.au/Images/dirks_glossary_tcm2-954.pdf A Strategic Approach to Managing Information from National Archives of Australia]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130128102612/http://www.arma.org/erecords/index.cfm ARMA International Electronic Records and e-Discovery]\nSee also\n*DIRKS, Design and Implementation of Record Keeping Systems\n*The National Archives (UK), The National Archives\n*Design Criteria Standard for Electronic Records Management Software Applications\n*Paperless Office\n*Document Management\n*Document Imaging\nReferences"
