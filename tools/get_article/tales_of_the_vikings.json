Tales of the Vikings was the company's first venture into television. The series, like the Douglas' 1958 film The Vikings, was shot in Europe and used footage, sets, props, and costumes from the film. It was filmed in black and white, and distributed by United Artists Television.  Since Tales of the Vikings aired in syndication, air dates varied from one TV station to another during the 1959-1960 season. It also aired on British television, and in 1962 in Finland.\nCourtland has his hair and beard dyed blond for the series. Ryan O'Neal got his start on Tales of the Viking. His parents, who were living abroad at the time, got the teenager a job as a stuntman, under veteran John Sullivan, learning fights, falls, and duels.\nThe theme song was written by Bert Grund with lyrics by Sid Morse.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://ctva.biz/Europe/Vikings.htm Tales of the Vikings] at Classic TV Archive\n*\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xigQZZ5XUo Theme Song from Tales of the Vikings]"
