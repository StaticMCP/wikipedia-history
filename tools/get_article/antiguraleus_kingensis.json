In shape it may be long and narrow, or short and broad. In sculpture it may have axial ribs, well marked, narrow, almost lamelliform, or round and solid, or low, or quite obsolete, especially on the body whorl. The spiral lirae may be quite valid, or revealed only by a fairly high power of the microscope. Generally the spirals are best marked when the axials are small. The colour may be a uniform brown tint, or there may be spiral colour bands of different widths, or the shell may be white.\nDistribution\nThis marine species is endemic to Australia and occurs off South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria\nReferences\n* Petterd, W. 1879.
