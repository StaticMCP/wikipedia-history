He attended Dartmouth College, his father's alma mater, during which time he campaigned for Bill Clinton and Al Gore. King graduated cum laude from Dartmouth in 1993.\nAfter college, from 1995 to 1997, King worked as an assistant to the chief of staff at the White House under President Bill Clinton. Following his White House service, he worked as a consultant with Bain & Company. King later pursued graduate education, earning an MBA with distinction from Harvard Business School in 2001.\nCareer\nFrom 1995 to 1997, King worked as an assistant to the director of communications and assistant to the chief of staff at the White House under Bill Clinton.

He is seeking to replace Democrat Janet Mills, who is not seeking re-election due to term limits. King has not previously held elected office. King's platform includes lowering costs for families, building more housing, and creating jobs among Maine small businesses. In campaign messaging, he has emphasized both his role as a political outsider and his legacy as the son of Senator Angus King. He has described himself as a \"moderate\".\nA June poll by Pan Atlantic Research showed King with 33% support among likely Democratic Gubernatorial primary voters, ahead of the other prospective candidates Democratic included in the poll—Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Maine House Speaker Hannah Pingree, and former Maine Senator Troy Jackson.\nPersonal life\nKing lives in Portland, Maine. He married interior designer Catherine Alexandre in 1999. They have two children.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
