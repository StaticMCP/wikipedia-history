Kim Newman grouped the movie in with many others, labeling it repetitive and penny-pinching. The laser battle between the queen and the high priest was nominated worst special effect of 1985. Sci-fi Central found the movie cheap and fodder for MST3K In \"The Miller/Romero Connection\" the inclusion of the fantasy element was seen as a plus, but little else of worth was found.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
