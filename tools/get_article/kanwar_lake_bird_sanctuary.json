In November 2020, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) declared it the first Ramsar site in Bihar. It is one of the 91 Ramsar sites in India now.\nKanwar jheel, as it is locally called, is located 22&nbsp;km north-west of Begusarai Town in Manjhaul. It is a residual oxbow lake, formed due to meandering of Burhi Gandak river, a tributary of Ganga, in the geological past. It covers 2,620 hectares of the Indo-Gangetic plains in the northern Bihar State. The Site is one of 18 wetlands within an extensive floodplain complex; it floods during the monsoon season to a depth of 1.5 metres. This absorption of floodwaters is a vital service in Bihar State where 70% of the land is vulnerable to inundation. During the dry season, areas of marshland dry out and are used for agriculture. Significant biodiversity is present, with 165 plant species and 394 animal species recorded, including 221 bird species. The Wetland is an important stopover along the Central Asian Flyway, with 58 migratory waterbirds using it to rest and refuel. It is also a valuable site for fish biodiversity with over 50 species documented. Five critically endangered species inhabit the site, including three vultures – the red-headed vulture (Sarcogyps calvus), white-rumped vulture (Gyps bengalensis) and Indian vulture (Gyps indicus) – and two waterbirds, the sociable lapwing (Vanellus gregarius) and Baer’s pochard (Aythya baeri). Major threats to the Site include water management activities such as drainage, water abstraction, damming and canalization.\nOrnithologist Salim Ali, mentioned about 60 migratory birds that come all the way from Central Asia in winter and recorded around 106 species of resident birds. Since 2020 the lake has been designated as a protected Ramsar site.\nThe nearest railway station is  Begusarai Station; the nearest bus stop is Jaimanglagadh; and the nearest airport is Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Airport in Patna.\nTrees\nMangifera indica, Annona squamosa, Polyalthia longifolia, Borassus flabellifer, Cocos nucifera, Phoenix sylvestris, Haplophragma adenophyllum, Bombax ceiba, Ceiba pentandra, Cordia dichotoma, Ehretia laevis, Bauhinia variegata, Cassia fistula, Delonix regia, Peltophorum pterocarpum, Tamarindus indica, Trema oriental, Terminalia arjuna, Diospyros Montana, Croton roxburghii, Trevia nudiflora, Dalbergia sissoo, Leucaena leucocephala, Pongamia glabra, Phoebe lanceolata, Azadirachta indica, Melia azedarach, Swietenia macrophylla, Acacia catechu, Acacia nilotica, Albizia lebbeck, Pithecellobium dulce, Artocarpus heterophyllus, Artocarpus lacucha, Ficus benghalensis, Ficus hispida, Ficus racemosa, Ficus religiosa, Ficus virens, Streblus asper, Moringa oleifera, Eucalyptus tereticornis, Psidium guajava, Syzygium cumini, Nyctanthes arbor-tristis, Phyllanthus emblica, Bambusa bambos, Dendrocalamus strictus, Ziziphus mauritiana, Anthocephalus kadamba, Aegle marmelos, Citrus maxima, Madhuca indica, Tectona grandis\nThreats\n* Excessive chemicals, like Furadan used to capture birds\n* Killing of birds\n* Villagers encroachment of lake area\nBirds in the region\nCritically endangered\n* Oriental white-backed vulture (Gyps bengalensis)\n* Long-billed vulture (Gyps indicus)\nEndangered\n* Greater adjutant (Leptoptilos dubiu)\nVulnerable\n*Greater spotted eagle (Aquila clanga)\n*Lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni)\n*Sarus crane (Grus antigone)\nNear threatened\n*Indian darter (Anhinga melanogaster)\n*Painted stork (Mycteria leucocephala)\n*Black-bellied tern (Sterna acuticauda)\nImages\nFile:Siberian Stonechat at Kanwar Lake.jpg|Siberian stonechat\nFile:Red-naped Ibis at Kanwar Lake.jpg|Red-naped ibis\nFile:Yellow-throated Sparrow at Kanwar Lake.jpg|Yellow-throated sparrow\nFile:Eurasian Sparrowhawk at Kanwar Lake.jpg|Eurasian sparrowhawk\nSee also\n* Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSSqqydZ1qI&feature=channel NewsX Report on Killing]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orEp1A0jRjc&feature=channel NewsX report]"
