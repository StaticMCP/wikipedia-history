Filming took six weeks. The film was one of the four of David Rawnsley's films that used his \"independent frame\" technique, a form of back projection.\nReception\nKine Weekly wrote: \"The picture compels its audience to take far too much on trust. The staging is spectacular, but this is insufficient compensation for the many inconsistencies in treatment and presentation. It is therefore small wonder that the players, try as they may, failto raise many laughs, touch thee heart or deliver its heavily veiled warning to wild young females. Almost completely baffled ourselves, we fear to contemplate ihe ninepennies' reactions.\"\nPicturegoer wrote: \"I found it all highly diverting, if a bit slow after the first half. Sonia. Holm seems too stolidly English as Maria for the play's setting, but Harold Warrender is a delight as the man with a long list of amorous conquests to his credit – or discredit. As Max David Tomlinson is gauchely naive, as only he knows. I hope that during the year we shall have as many more comedies as amusing as this one.\"\nPicture Show wrote: \"Heavy-handed handling of what should have been a gay, whimsical trifle, results in this being a pedestrian sort of warning. It is quite well acted, but the fanciful story is a little too confusing.\"\nVariety wrote: \"First of the Independent Frame productions to be made for general exhibition, Warning to Wantons bears no obvious traces of this new factory-like method of film making, other than the introduction of new technical grades such as frame supervisor, transparency photographer and transparency projection. Although its production qualities are commendable, the novelettish theme and the limitations of the script make this a doubtful starter for American audiences.&nbsp;...Plot itself is light and inconsequential but with a more polished script it might have been a scintillating comedy. As it is, only Anne Vernon, in the femme lead, really captures the spirit of the theme and comes to life. Neither Harold Warrender as the count, nor David Tomlinson as his erring son, appear happy in their parts and Sonia Holm tends to overdo the jealous wife who schemes to get her rival out of the way.\"\nTV Guide called the film a \"A spirited romantic comedy,\" and rated it two out of four stars.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
