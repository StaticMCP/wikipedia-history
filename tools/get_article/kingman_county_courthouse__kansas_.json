The stairway and entrance portico leading to the main entrance are of the same limestone. Its roof is basically hipped with gables in the middle of each side, pyramids on each corner and an octagonal shaped cupola rising from the center. Built in 1907-08 for Kingman County, it is one of 15 courthouses (13 in Kansas and one each in Illinois and Oklahoma) designed by architect George P. Washburn of Ottawa, Kansas. His design for this building has been called a mixture of Late Victorian, Romanesque, Free Classical and Queen Anne architectural styles.\nOn September 11, 1985, the Kingman County Courthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\nImage:Kingman County Kansas Courthouse Front Detail 2009.jpg|Front Detail\nImage:Kingman County Kansas Courthouse Front 2009.jpg|Front of the courthouse\nReferences"
