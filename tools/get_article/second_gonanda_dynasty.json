According to Kalhana, this dynasty ruled Kashmir just before the Karkotas.\nSources\nLiterature\nNo contemporary literature exists.\nThe sole mentions are retrieved from the third book of Rajatarangini, an 11th-century work by Kalhana, which aimed to sketch an outline of Kashmir's history since ancient times, and did discuss the Karkota dynasty in depth.}} Kalhana claimed to have depended on a variety of sources — earlier historical works, dynastic genealogies, inscriptions, coins and Puranas.\nCoinage\nSeveral coins bearing names roughly consistent with the names of the Gonanda rulers — Śrī Meghamah (prob. king Meghavahana), Śrī Pravarasenah (King Pravarasena), Śrī Tuysīna (prob. King Tunjina), and Śrī Toramaņa (Toramana) — have been recently discovered. These coins are quite rare, made of copper, silver, or debased gold, and generally follow Kushan and Kidarite designs.\nFile:Post-Kushan Gandhara Kidara Shahis Sri Pravarasena Circa 6th-early 7th century CE.jpg|Coinage of Pravarasena, supposed founder of Srinagar.

However the chronology is widely deemed to be faulty and on cross-vetting with coins and inscriptions from outside Kashmir, the names of some of the Gonanda rulers are found to roughly correspond with the Alchon Huns, who ruled hundreds of years later than the time-frame assigned by Kalhana. In Kalhana's narrative, names of some rulers are reshuffled and/or repeated multiple times across the first and third book, some stories are retrofitted and recycled, some reigns are impossibly long, and some rulers are telescoped into the past.

Efforts by historians to probe into individual kings are mentioned.\nMeghavahana\nMeghavahana was the son of Yudhisthira I's great-grandson, who had been granted asylum by Gopaditya, the king of Gandhara. Kalhana assigns a regnal span of 34 years. Meghavahana had been selected the husband of a Vaishnavite princess at a Swayamvara in another kingdom. The ministers of Kashmir brought him to Kashmir after San dhimati proved to be an unwilling king. Meghavahana banned animal slaughter and compensated those who earned their living through hunting. He patronized Brahmins, and set up a monastery. His queens built Buddhist viharas and monasteries. He subdued kings in regions as far as Sinhala Kingdom, forcing them to abandon animal slaughter.\nShreshtasena (Pravarasena I / Tungjina II)\nSon of Meghavahana. Kalhana assigns a regnal span of 30 years.\nHiranya\nSon of Shreshtasena, assisted by his brother and co-regent Toramana. The king imprisoned Toramana, when the latter stuck royal coins in his own name. Toramana's son Pravarasena, who had been brought up in secrecy by his mother Anjana, freed him. Hiranya died childless. Several coins of a king named Toramana have been found in the Kashmir region. This king is identified by some with Huna ruler Toramana, although his successor Mihirakula is placed much earlier by Kalhana. Kalhana assigns a regnal span of about 30 years.\nToramana\nSon of Pravarasena I, Vice-king of Hiranya. Kalhana assigns a regnal span of years.\nMatrigupta\nAccording to Kalhana, the emperor Vikramditya (alias Harsha) of Ujjayini defeated the Shakas, and made his friend and poet Matrigupta the ruler of Kashmir. After Vikramaditya's death, Matrigupta abdicated the throne in favour of Pravarasena. According to D. C. Sircar, Kalhana has confused the legendary Vikramaditya of Ujjain with the Vardhana Emperor Harsha (c. 606-47 CE). The latter is identified with Shiladitya mentioned in Xuanzang's account. However, according to M. A. Stein, Kalhana's Vikramaditya is another Shiladitya mentioned in Xuanzang's account: a king of Malwa around 580 CE. Kalhana assigns a regnal span of 4 years and 9 months.\nPravarasena II\nHistorical evidence suggests that a king named Pravarasena ruled Kashmir in the 6th century CE. According to Kalhana, Pravarasena subdued many other kings, in lands as far as Saurashtra. He restored the rule of Vikramaditya's son Pratapshila (alias Shiladitya), who had been expelled from Ujjain by his enemies. Pratapshila agreed to be a vassal of Pravarasena after initial resistance. He founded a city called Pravarapura, which is identified by later historians as the modern city of Srinagar on the basis topographical details. Kalhana assigns a regnal span of 60 years.\nYudhisthira II\nSon of Pravarasena II. Kalhana assigns a regnal span of 39 years and 8 months.\nNarendraditya I\nSon of Yudhishthira II and Padmavati. Kalhana assigns a regnal span of 13 years.\nRanaditya I (Tungina III)\nYounger brother of Narendraditya. His queen Ranarambha was an incarnation of Bhramaravasini. The Chola king Ratisena had found her among the waves, during an ocean worship ritual. Kalhana assigns a regnal span of 300 years.\nVikramaditya\nSon of Ranaditya. Kalhana assigns a regnal span of 42 years.\nBaladitya\nYounger brother of Vikramaditya. He subdued several enemies. Baladitya (apparently) had no male heir but a daughter Anaṅgalekhā and did not wish his territory to be annexed by in-laws. To avert such a possibility he married her to Durlabhavardhana, a low-caste employee having no royal lineage. However, after Baladitya's death, Durlabhavardhana ascended to the throne with help from a minister, and claimed descent from the mythical Naga king Karkotaka, establishing the Karkota Dynasty.\nThis view is accepted by Witzel. Kalhana assigns a regnal span of 36 years and 8 months.\nSee also\n* Karkoṭa dynasty\nNotes\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*"
