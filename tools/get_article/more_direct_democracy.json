Rookmaker is also the chair of the party. Starting on 8 December 8, 2021, the party was part of the faction of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECH).\nThe party does not have its own election manifesto, but rather is a platform for representatives who each make their own choices. The party participated in the European elections in June 2024 and lost its seat.\nMDD was a member of the European Alliance for Freedom and Democracy (EAFD), a European party that focused on anti-corruption and support for the rule of law. The EAFD was disbanded in 2023.\nElection results\nEuropean Parliament\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n! Election\n! List\n! Votes\n! %\n! Seats\n! +/–\n!
