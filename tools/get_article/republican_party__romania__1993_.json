It ceased activity before 2004, when the name was taken over by the Party of the Third Millenium.\nHistory\nThe Republican Party contested the 1996 elections receiving 0.14% (Chamber) and 0.16% (Senate), leaving the party seatless. The 2000 elections saw its votes share fall again to 0.10% and 0.11%.\nElectoral history\nLegislative elections\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!rowspan=2|Election\n!colspan=3|Chamber\n!colspan=3|Senate\n!rowspan=2|Position\n!rowspan=2|Status\n|-\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n|-\n!1996\n|17,190\n|0.14\n|}}\n|20,273\n|0.16\n|}}\n|29th\n|\n|-\n!2000\n|10,840\n|0.10\n|}}\n|12,094\n|0.11\n|}}\n|27th\n|\n|}\nReferences"
