The first part of the conjugation is the first part of Zillmann meaning Sail maker in old German dialects. Spelling variations of this family name include: Zyll, Zyl, Zeil, Ziel, Zyller, Zyllmann, Zillmann, Zylhoffer. The word mere is recorded in Old English, corresponding to Old Saxon meri, Old Low Franconian *meri (Dutch meer), Old High German mari / meri (German Meer), Goth. mari-, marei, Old Norse marr (Swedish mar-, French mare). They derive from reconstituted Germanic *mari, itself from Indo-European *mori, the same root as marsh and moor. The Indo-European root gave also birth to similar words in the other European languages : Latin mare 'sea' (Italian mar\", French mer), Old Celtic *mori'' 'sea' (Gaulish mori-, more, Irish muir, Welsh môr, Breton mor), Old Slavic morje.'' Therefore, Zillmere is the conjugation for Zillman's Waterholes, which were in turn named after early German pioneer Leopold Zillman.\nEducation\nZillmere State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at Murphy Road ().
