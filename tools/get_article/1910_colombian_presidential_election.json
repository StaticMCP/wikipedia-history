The result was a victory for Carlos Eugenio Restrepo of the Republican Union.\nBackground\nRafael Reyes was elected president for a six-year term in 1904, but resigned and went into exile in June 1909 under pressure from opposition parties. Ramón González Valencia was elected interim President to see out Reyes' term, and convened a Constituent Assembly to meet in 1910.\nThe Assembly passed several reforms to the constitution, reducing the presidential term from six to four years, banning immediate re-election, scrapping the post of Vice President and reintroducing direct elections from 1914. The Assembly also elected a President to serve the first term from 1910 until 1914.\nResults\nReferences"
