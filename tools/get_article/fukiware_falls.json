It is a nationally designated Place of Scenic Beauty and a Natural Monument. It is one of \"Japan’s Top 100 Waterfalls\", per a listing published by the Japanese Ministry of the Environment in 1990.\nIn Jomo Karuta, it is featured on the 'ta' card.\nOverview\nThe falls are located on the upper reaches of the Katashina River and have a height of  and width of . The Katashina River forms a gorge between the confluence of the Hikawa River upstream and the Kurihara River downstream. This is called the Fukiwari Ravine.  The falls were created by a large-scale pyroclastic flow caused by a volcanic eruption that occurred 9 million years ago, creating a cliff of tuff with the river flowing from three sides of the cliff. It has been called the \"Oriental Niagara\" by the Numata City Tourism Board. Downstream, there are many potholes on the riverbed, with a maximum size of six to seven meters in the long axis, and there are two smaller waterfalls. There is a promenade along the river, and many souvenir shops at the entrance.\nDue to the large volume of water at all times, water erosion on the cliff face is severe, and it currently receding at the about seven centimeters upstream in a year.\nThe falls were used as a backdrop image for the opening credits of the 2000 NHK Taiga drama Aoi.\nThe falls can be reached in about 30 minutes by car from the Numata Interchange on the Kan'etsu Expressway.\nGallery\nfile:Numata Fukiware-Fälle 03.jpg|\nfile:Fukiware Falls 07.jpg\nfile:Numata Fukiware-Fälle 14.jpg\nSee also\n* Japan's Top 100 Waterfalls\n*List of Places of Scenic Beauty of Japan (Gunma)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.visitgunma.jp/en/sightseeing/detail.php?sightseeing_id=15 Tourist Guide of Gunma Prefecture]\n*[https://www.numata-kankou.jp/en/nature/fukiwarefalls/index.html Numata city tourist information home page]"
