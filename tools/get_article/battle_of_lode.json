The battle was won by the Swedes.\nBackground\nIn the Autumn of 1572, the Russian army began its offensive into the Baltic, with Russian forces besieging Weissenstein, and after a heavy bombardment the Russians successfully storm the city and capture it on January 1. Afterwards, part of the Russian army departs along with the Tsar to Novgorod, and the remaining Russian forces in Estonia  are divided into two, with one of them capturing Karkus, and the other, numbering around 16,000 men, was assigned to capture Lode, Leal, and Hapsal. The number of the Swedish detachment is about 1,600–2,000\nBattle\nWhen Clas Åkesson Tott realized that the Russian Army was divided, he marched out from Reval with around 700 Knights along with a few hundred cavalry from the Baltic to attack the Russian army besieging Lode. On 23 January, the Russian and Swedish armies met outside of Lode, with the Russian army being led by Simeon Bekbulatovich.\nThe Baltic cavalry received orders to assault the Russians and was quickly able to tear the Russian formations, despite its success, the cavalry decides that the Russian force is too strong and retreats. Despite this, Clas decides that he would be able to take advantage of the confusion that had begun in the Russian lines and advanced with his knights, and this proved to be decisive. Upwards of 7,000 casualties are said to have been suffered by the Russians, although this number is likely highly exaggerated.\nAftermath\nAfter the battle, Tott was able to return to Reval with all of the Russian artillery, 100 horses, and a large number of saddles, the Swedish casualties are said to have been minimal. However, despite the large victory gained by Tott, it was not followed by additional Swedish successes.\nReferences\nSources\n*Sundberg, Ulf: Svenska krig 1521-1814, p.&nbsp;78, Hjalmarson & Högberg Bokförlag, Stockholm 2002,\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=z4Y-AAAAcAAJ&dq=Lode+1573&pg=PA349 Anders Anton von Stiernman, Swea och Götha Höfdinga-Minne, Volym 2]\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=xSIPAQAAMAAJ&q=Lode+1573 Fridolf Ödberg, Tidsbilder ur 1500-talets svenska häfder, C.
