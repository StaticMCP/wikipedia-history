Enlisted personnel were awarded the Medal for Merit in War for similar deeds.  The cross could be awarded to combatants and non-combatants, with the ribbon differentiating between the awards.\nAppearance\nCross for Merit in War is a bronze cross pattee, the arms of the cross having curved ends.  Between the arms is a wreath of rue.  The cross is suspended from a five-arched crown. The obverse has a medallion in the center of the cross, bearing the founder's initial B.  The entire cross is surrounded by an oak wreath, tied at the cardinal points. The reverse depicts the Arms of Saxony on in the central medallion and the inscription FUR VERDIENST IM KREIGE 1914/15 on the outer edge.\nThe ribbon is black with yellow side stripes and green and white checkered edges for combatants.  For non-combatants the ribbon is also black and yellow, separated from a green edge by white stripes.\nNotable recipients\n*Erich Ludendorff\n*Gustav von Vaerst\n*Philipp, Landgrave of Hesse\nReferences\n*\nNotes"
