The Northern Ireland Protocol, which first came into effect on 24 March 2023, regulates inter-island trade to support this arrangement. Internal shipments from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are regulated as imports to the EU, but shipments from Northern Ireland can enter the rest of UK customs union barrier-free.\nOn 26 September 2023, the UK Treasury made The Customs (Northern Ireland) (EU Exit) (Amendment) Regulations 2023. This is a statutory instrument (2023 No. 958) The new regulations updated the UK's customs duty rules for goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and created a wider definition to determine whether food is at risk of entering the EU.\nObjectives\nThe customs agreements:\n* remove customs duties between members\n* prohibit quantitive restrictions}}\n* create a common external tariff\n* create a shared safety and security zone\n* create a joint customs committee\n* create a single customs area.\nThese agreements also state that they may be terminated at any time by mutual agreement.\nCommon Transit Convention\nOn 29 December 2020, the United Kingdom became an independent member of Common Transit Convention; this has been extended to the crown dependencies through the UK–Crown Dependencies customs union and is used as the basis for common transit between members.\nCustoms alignment\nParagraphs 10 to 12 provide that members of the customs union will align with the UK in areas of customs laws, rules and procedures.\nJoint UK-CD Customs Committee\nThe customs agreements created a joint customs committee (UK-CD Customs Committee). This committee will meet at least once a year and will act as a forum for:\n* Exchanging views on common interests regarding the agreements\n* Reviewing the operation of the agreements\n* Seeking appropriate way and methods to avoid problems occurring in regard to areas covered in the agreements\n* Mediation should problems occur regarding areas covered in the agreements.\nExternal Customs Tariffs\nIn 2020 the UK government passed the Customs (Tariff Quotas)(EU Exit) Regulations 2020. The purpose of this regulation is to update definitions in customs legislation.\nCustoms agreements\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Customs agreements, entered into force on 29 December 2020\n!rowspan=2|CrownDependency\n!rowspan=2|Agreement\n! colspan=2|Legislation ratifying the agreements\n!rowspan=\"2\" |Citation\n|-\n!UK\n!Crown Dependency\n|-\n| Jersey\n| [https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/759121/Jersey-UK_Customs_Arrangement_final.pdf Arrangement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the government of Jersey concerning the establishment and operation of the United Kingdom–Crown Dependencies Customs Union]\n|[https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/256/contents/made The Crown Dependencies Customs Union (Jersey) (EU Exit) Order 2019]\n|[https://www.jerseylaw.je/laws/current/ro_128_2018 EU Legislation (Customs Union, Import and Export Control) (Jersey) Regulations 2018]\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|Guernsey\n|[https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/759122/Guernsey-UK_Customs_Arrangement_final.pdf Arrangement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the government of Guernsey concerning the establishment and operation of the United Kingdom–Crown Dependencies Customs Union]\n|[https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/254/contents/made \"The Crown Dependencies Customs Union (Guernsey) (EU Exit) Order 2019\"]\n|[https://www.guernseylegalresources.gg/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=134445&p=0 \"The Customs Excise (Import)(Customs Declaration) Regulations 2020\"]\n|-\n|Isle of Man\n|[https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/759123/IoM-UK_Customs_Arrangement_final_PDF.pdf \"Arrangement between the governments of the United Kingdom and the Isle of Man further amending the agreement between those governments on customs and excise and associated matters dated 15th October 1979\"]\n|[https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/257/contents/made \"The Crown Dependencies Customs Union (Isle of Man) (EU Exit) Order 2019\"]\n|[https://www.tynwald.org.im/business/opqp/sittings/20182021/2019-SD-0080.pdf \"Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018 (Application) Order 2019\"]\n|}\nSee also\n* Accession of the United Kingdom to CPTPP\n* Common Travel Area\n* Free trade agreements of the United Kingdom\n*Local border traffic\n* United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020\nReferences\nFootnotes\nExternal links\n* [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/customs-arrangements-with-the-crown-dependencies Customs arrangements with the Crown Dependencies]\n* [https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/385/contents/made The Customs (Crown Dependencies Customs Union) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019]"
