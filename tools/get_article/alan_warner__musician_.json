He was a member of groups such as  The Ramong Sound, The Foundations, Pluto, and The Polecats.\nHe was one of the founding members of The Foundations who would have hits with \"Baby, Now That I've Found You\", \"Back On My Feet Again\" and \"Build Me Up Buttercup\" and \"In the Bad Bad Old Days (Before You Loved Me)\". He played rhythm guitar and lead guitar as well as contributing to the song writing efforts of the group and backing both of the band's lead singers Clem Curtis and later Colin Young.\nBackground\nAlan Warner was born to parents John and Mary Warner on April 21, 1947, in Paddington. Warner is the youngest child of four children (two brothers and a sister).\nAs a boy he originally wanted to play trumpet but ended up with a toy accordion. He started playing guitar at the age of 11, after his parents bought him a cheap Spanish guitar for Christmas, and he soon realised, listening to the twangy tones of Duane Eddy, Hank Marvin, The Ventures, he wanted to do music professionally.\nAt some stage he was employed as a printer. According to the back cover of the Foundations' album Digging the Foundations (1969), Warner is 5&nbsp;ft 4in. In 1967, he was living in Elstree, Hertfordshire with his parents. Alan claims to have made guitars out of old bed frames.\nMusical career\nIn the early 1960s, after leaving school at the age of fourteen, Warner played with several semi-professional groups playing local gigs, before becoming a professional musician two years later. Some of the groups he played in were The Leesiders Sect, The Skeletones and The Line-up, a popular Dublin-based group.\nHis first band was called The Select, a band that mainly covered Rnb songs. The band entered a Beat music competition in 1965, and with a rule that each act had to perform an original song, Warner penned his first song \"Red, White And Blue For You\".\nAfter a short stint in the Skeletones, he moved to the south of Ireland. Warner nearly joined a group called The Black Eagles, which included Phil Lynott and Brian Downey, both later members of Thin Lizzy, but he turned it down.\nThe Ramong Sound\nIn 1966, Warner placed an ad in a music magazine looking for work in a band. Soul music was coming into England and thought it would be nice to join a soul type band. He got a reply and then passed an audition with a black band who were playing all over London. He got another call and turned up a pub at Edmonton where the band was. The band didn't have any gigs but Warner felt that they had some great ideas. So for some reason, he decided to go with the Ramong, and became a member of The Ramong Sound, a soul and ska group fronted by Raymond Morrison AKA Ramong which also featured Clem Curtis on vocals. Another member was Nigerian born star trumpeter, Mike Falana, who had previously been with Graham Bond Organisation, having replaced Jack Bruce.\nThey ended up leasing the Butterfly club.\nWarner would be present though the band's name changes and evolution. Morrison ended up being imprisoned for six months.Alan Warner Website - [http://www.alan-warner.com/index.php/the_foundations-the_foundations/?k=36826:6:: The Foundations, \"Morrison left the band to occupy a room for six months at Her Majesty's pleasure\"] They did try and enlist Rod Stewart and they jammed with him but Stewart was heading into other genres. They did manage to have Arthur Brown in their group for a couple of months where he shared lead with Clem Curtis before kicking off his own band the Crazy World of Arthur Brown.\nThe Foundations\nThe group was eventually discovered by Ron Fairway who managed the group, The Ways and Means Fairway introduced them to a businessman called Barry Class. The original line up as they became known for was Clem Curtis (Curtis Clements)  on vocals, Tim Harris on drums, Peter Macbeth (Peter McGrath) on bass Eric Allan Dale (Eric Allandale) on trombone, Allan Warner on lead guitar, Tony Gomesz on organ, Pat Burke on tenor sax and Mike Elliott on tenor sax.\nRon Fairway's group, The Ways and Means were apparently offered the chance to record \"Baby Now That I've Found You\" but felt that it wasn't for them. So, The Foundations with Clem Curtis on lead vocals and Warner on guitar recorded it and it became a massive hit.\nAfter the group had two more hits with Clem Curtis, \"Back on My Feet Again\" and \"Any Old Time (You're Lonely and Sad)\" things were set to change. Clem Curtis decided to leave the band, and they tried out singers which included Warren Davis of the Warren Davis Monday Band.  Another hopeful was allegedly Hue Montgomery.\nThe successor to Curtis turned out to be Colin Young. He was set to record \"Build Me Up Buttercup\" once things were finalized with Major Minor Records which was his former label.Melody Maker, October 12, 1968 - [https://www.worldradiohistory.com/UK/Melody-Maker/60s/68/Melody-Maker-1968-1012.pdf Page 5 FOUNDATION SINGLE]  With Young, the group released \"Build Me Up Buttercup\".\n\"Build Me Up Buttercup\" entered the UK chart on 26 November 19, 1968 and made the no. 2 spot on 31 December, spending a total of fifteen weeks in the chart.

This caused the group to delay their recording of the B side to their single, \"Born to Live, Born to Die\".
