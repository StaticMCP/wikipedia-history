Born in Denmark, he is of Gambian descent.\nEarly life\nSeejou King was born in Hvidovre, Denmark. He played under-17 football with Hvidovre IF, before being picked up by Nordsjælland.\nSenior career\nNordsjælland\nAt the start of the 2011–12 Danish Superliga season, Nordsjælland lacked a left-back following the sale of Pierre Bengtsson to Copenhagen the previous winter and the end of Bryan Oviedo's loan spell. As a result, King was promoted to the first team.\nHe made his debut on 16 July 2011 in a 2–0 loss to OB, the opening match of the season, receiving a yellow card for a foul on Andreas Johansson. He made five appearances in the Superliga before being pushed down the pecking order following the arrival of Danish international Patrick Mtiliga.\nSporting CP\nAt the end of the 2013 January transfer window, Nordsjælland confirmed that Sporting B, the reserve team of Sporting CP, had signed King on loan for the remainder of the season. He made his debut on 10 February 2013 against Arouca. On 28 June 2013, Sporting made the move permanent, signing King on a contract until 2016.\nAves\nIn the summer of 2016, King transferred from Sporting CP to Aves, a club in Portugal's second division. Two weeks before the season's start in August, King suffered an injury. Upon arriving at the training facility, he was informed by the sports director that he was suspended, with the club stating they could not utilize an injured player.\nDuring his tenure at Aves, King faced several challenges. He experienced financial difficulties, including receiving his salary in cash-filled envelopes that often contained less than the agreed amount. Additionally, he reportedly faced threats from the club's Brazilian president, contributing to an unstable and challenging environment. King did not make any official appearances for Aves.\nReturn to Denmark\nFollowing his departure from Aves, King returned to Denmark, spending a year without a club before signing with Avarta in the Danish 2nd Division. He later joined Akademisk Boldklub (AB), where he became the oldest member of the squad. Alongside his playing career, he worked as a substitute teacher.\nKing later played for lower-division sides B1908 and Skovshoved.\nPersonal life\nKing has two daughters and has spoken about the importance of family stability following his return to Denmark. He has maintained friendships from his time in Portugal, notably with Eric Dier, a former teammate at Sporting CP.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Other\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Nordsjælland\n|2011–12\n|Danish Superliga\n|5||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||6||0\n|-\n|2012–13\n|Danish Superliga\n|0||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||1||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!5!!0!!2!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|—!!5!!0\n|-\n|Sporting CP B (loan)\n|2012–13\n|Segunda Liga\n|14||3||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||14||3\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Sporting CP B\n|2013–14\n|Segunda Liga\n|15||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||15||0\n|-\n|2014–15\n|Segunda Liga\n|6||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||6||0\n|-\n|2015–16\n|LigaPro\n|14||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||14||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!49!!3!!colspan=\"2\"|—!!colspan=\"2\"|—!!49!!3\n|-\n|Aves\n|2016–17\n|LigaPro\n|0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||0||0\n|-\n|Avarta\n|2017–18\n|2nd Divisions\n|12||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||12||0\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|AB\n|2018–19\n|2nd Divisions\n|22||2||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||23||2\n|-\n|2019–20\n|2nd Divisions\n|18||1||4||1||colspan=\"2\"|—||22||2\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!40!!3!!5!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|—!!45!!4\n|-\n|B1908\n|2020–21\n|Denmark Series\n|9||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||10||0\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Skovshoved\n|2020–21\n|2nd Divisions\n|14||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||14||0\n|-\n|2021–22\n|Denmark Series\n|16||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||16||0\n|-\n|2022–23\n|Copenhagen Series\n|0||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||1||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!30!!0!!1!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|—!!31!!0\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|Career total\n!145!!6!!9!!1!!0!!0!!5!!0\n|}\nHonours\nNordsjælland\n* Danish Superliga: 2011–12\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
