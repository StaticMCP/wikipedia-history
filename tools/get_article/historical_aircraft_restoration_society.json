The group has two museums, at Shellharbour Airport in New South Wales, Australia, and Parkes, New South Wales, Australia. HARS was formed in 1979 by a group of aviation enthusiasts interested in the preservation of Australian Aviation History. Its mission is \"To recover and where possible restore to flying condition, aircraft or types of aircraft that have played a significant part in Australian Aviation History both in the Civil and Military arenas\".\nThe group possesses a collection which includes several large and significant aircraft such as a Boeing 707 and a Boeing 747-400. Many of its aircraft are kept at an airworthy standard, including a Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation which is the last remaining flying example in the world. Other examples are kept at a taxiable standard where restoration of airframes to an airworthy standard is not feasible. The group operates a Navy Heritage Flight, which operates a range of ex Royal Australian Navy Fleet Air Arm aircraft in support of the Navy.\nThe group's Boeing 707 was formerly owned by actor John Travolta, who donated the aircraft to the group in 2017. As of May 2022, however, the aircraft is still in the United States, with the COVID-19 pandemic impacting the process to relocate the aircraft to Australia significantly.\nThe arrival of the 747 required significant preparation to allow the aircraft to land at the small regional Shellharbour Airport without damaging the runway.\nCollection\nAircraft at the Shellharbour museum include:\n*Boeing 747-438 City of Canberra (VH-OJA)\n*Lockheed L-1049 Super ConstellationA\n*Consolidated PBY CatalinaA\n*Dassault Mirage IIIO (A3-42)\n*Lockheed P-2 NeptuneA (273 & 566)\n*Douglas C-47 Dakota (A65-94 & A65-95)A\n*Douglas C-54 SkymasterRA\n*Convair 440A\n*de Havilland Vampire (A79-637, now VH-FJWRA and A79-665)\n*Bristol Beaufighter\n*Bell AH-1 Cobra\n*de Havilland Australia DHA-3 DroverA\n*Cessna 310 (VH-REK)A\n*de Havilland Tiger MothA\n*CAC Winjeel\n*Cessna 180\n*Cessna 172\n*de Havilland Canada DHC-4 CaribouA (A4-210 and A4-234)\n*Let L-200 MoravaA\n*Auster Autocar\n*English Electric Canberra\n*General Dynamics F-111C\n*Grumman S-2G Tracker (N12-152812)\n*Lockheed AP-3C OrionA (A9-753)\n*Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21\n*Fokker F.VIIB/3m “Southern Cross” ReplicaRA\nAircraft at the Parkes museum include:\n*Lockheed AP-3C Orion A9-759\n*Lockheed P2V-5 Neptune A89-302\n*Lockheed P2V-7 Neptune A89-272\n*De Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou A4-275\n*Convair 580 VH-PDW\n*Westland Wessex HAS.31B 813 (N7-203)\n*Bell AH-1 Huey Cobra\n*de Havilland DH.114 Heron VH–AHB\nA aircraft kept in airworthy condition.\nRA aircraft under restoration to airworthy condition.\nSee also\n*List of aviation museums\nReferences"
