J.\" Warren Jr. (born September 5, 1993) is an American professional basketball player who last played for the Westchester Knicks of the NBA G League. He played college basketball as a small forward for the NC State Wolfpack in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). In the 2013–14 season, he earned consensus second-team All-American honors and was named the ACC Player of the Year after leading the conference in scoring with 24.9 points per game.\nWarren was picked in the first round of the 2014 NBA draft with the 14th overall pick by the Phoenix Suns, where he spent five seasons with the team before being traded to the Indiana Pacers in 2019. During the NBA bubble in 2020, Warren had a breakout performance, averaging 31.0 points per game and a career-high 53-point game against the Philadelphia 76ers. After injuries derailed his final few years in Indiana, Warren signed with the Brooklyn Nets in 2022 and was traded back to the Suns in 2023. He has also played for the Minnesota Timberwolves.\nHigh school career\nWarren graduated from Brewster Academy, but Warren also attended Riverside High School and Word of God Christian Academy prior to Brewster. He averaged 14 points per game on Word of God's team and his team finished the season at 24–3.  While at Brewster Academy in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, Warren was a small forward for his varsity basketball team. Warren earned 1st Team All NEPSAC honors and led his team to the National Prep Championship finishing with a record of 33–1. Ranked number 32 in the MaxPreps Class of 2012 Top 100, Warren became a hot commodity for college recruits. During his senior year of high school, Warren was viewed by multiple colleges, including North Carolina State University, Georgetown, and University of North Carolina. After visiting some of his prospective schools, Warren officially committed to North Carolina State University on November 2, 2011. Warren was recruited by Orlando Early, the assistant coach at NCSU. Warren was part of the second highest ranked college basketball draft class by CBSsports along with Tyler Lewis and Rodney Purvis. All three of the players were All-Americans and natives of North Carolina. He became the 23rd ranked prospect on the ESPN recruiting board for the 2012 recruiting class before committing to play for North Carolina State University.\nCollege career\nNC State (2012–2014)\nFreshman season\nAs part of the 2012–13 NC State Wolfpack men's basketball team, as a freshman Warren averaged 12.1 points a game and 4.2 rebounds in 27 minutes per game earning him a spot on the ACC All-Freshmen Team.  He also led the ACC in shooting percentage that year at .622, or 62.2%.  Warren's best game that season came against Florida State on February 19, 2013, where he scored 31 points and had 13 rebounds. He helped lead the Wolfpack back into the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Tournament.  As an 8 seed, they lost to Temple University in the first round of the NCAA tournament.  The loss ended the team's season with a 24–11 record.\nSophomore season\nWarren decided to stay for his sophomore year despite being rated as one of the top 31 prospects in the NBA draft during his freshman year. His main influence was his father who convinced him that playing another year at NC State would benefit Warren more, by allowing him to further develop his basketball skills and also improve his draft spot for the NBA. His father is Tony Warren Sr., who played for NC State from 1977 to 1979 under Norm Sloan. Warren only averaged 27 minutes a game his freshman season, but knew his minutes would increase his sophomore year due to NC State's basketball team losing all of their starters from the previous year. Warren showed great great potential during his Freshman year, but didn't get to put his talents on full display due to the fact that he played more of a sixth man role as opposed to starting.\nWarren truly blossomed his sophomore year, he had career highs in points with 41 against Pittsburgh, followed by a 42-point performance versus Boston College. He led his team to the final 64 in NCAA tournament, with a 12 seed, after beating Xavier in the first four, but ended his sophomore season losing to St. Louis in the second round after scoring 28 points.  For the year, Warren averaged 24.9 points and 7.1 rebounds per game while playing an average of 35.4 minutes per game.\nWarren led his school to a 22–14 record and went 9–9 in the ACC in his sophomore year. He ended up leading the team with 7.1 rebounds per game and 1.8 steals per game. He was also the first player from the school to win ACC Player of the Year since Julius Hodge.\nIn April 2014, Warren declared for the NBA draft, foregoing his final two years of college eligibility.\nAwards and honors\nIn 2014, Warren was in the running for the 38th Annual Wooden Award which is awarded to the National Player of the Year for the collegiate basketball season.  He was named to the Mid-Season Wooden Watch list where he was one of 25 players seriously considered for the award.\nAt the end of the 2014 season, Warren was one of the top in the ACC in offensive rebounds and was among the league leaders in both overall rebounding and steals. At the conclusion of the regular season, Warren was named ACC Player of the Year. Warren was also named second team All-American by the Associated Press and The Sporting News at the end of the season, as well as first team All-ACC.\nOn February 24, 2019, Warren was honored by NC State, with his no. 24 jersey being raised to the rafters of PNC Arena in a pregame ceremony.\nProfessional career\nPhoenix Suns (2014–2019)\nOn June 26, 2014, Warren was selected with the 14th overall pick by the Phoenix Suns in the 2014 NBA draft.
