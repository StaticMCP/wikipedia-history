Named after Charles Sumner, it was constructed as a meeting hall about 1908 and is a two-story gable-front frame building, built on brick piers, with a rectangular floor plan.  It is located in the Scotts Point area, a historically black area within the Chestertown Historic District, and was abandoned between 1985 and 2002.  It is one of only two Grand Army of the Republic halls for African-American veterans known to survive in the Nation.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. In 2012, Preservation Maryland placed the Charles Sumner Post #25 on its list of threatened historic properties.\nThe building has been restored by the Kent County Arts Council and opened to the public in 2014 as a museum of American Civil War history and the role of African-Americans in the war.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.kentcountyartscouncil.org/charles-sumner-post/ Charles Sumner Post #25] - Kent County Arts Council\n*, includes photo from 1986, at Maryland Historical Trust"
