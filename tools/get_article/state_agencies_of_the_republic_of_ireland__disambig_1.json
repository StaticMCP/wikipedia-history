Such agencies are considered \"arm's length\" bodies as they are largely isolated from the workings of central government. The state agencies are distinct and separate from the civil service. As of Q3, 2016 approximately 12,616 public sector workers are employed in NCSAs.\nDepartment of Agriculture, Food and Marine\n* Bord Bia\n* Bord Iascaigh Mhara\n* Marine Institute Ireland\n* [http://nationalmilkagency.ie/ National Milk Agency]\n* [http://www.sfpa.ie/ Sea Fisheries Protection Authority]\n* Teagasc\nDepartment of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth\n* [https://www.aai.gov.ie/ The Adoption Authority]\n* Centre for Young Offenders\n* Child and Family Agency\n* Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission\n* Office of the Ombudsman for Children\n* [http://nda.ie/ National Disability Authority]\nDepartment of Education\n* [http://www.erc.ie/ Educational Research Centre]\n* National Council for Special Education\n* [http://www.pdsttechnologyineducation.ie/en/ PDST Technology in Education]\n* [http://www.caranua.ie/ Caranua, formally Residential Institutions Statutory Fund]\n* [http://www.teachingcouncil.ie/en/ Teaching Council of Ireland]\nDepartment of Enterprise, Trade and Employment\n* Competition and Consumer Protection Commission\n* Enterprise Ireland\n* Health and Safety Authority\n* IDA Ireland\n* InterTradeIreland\n* Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority\n* National Standards Authority of Ireland\n* [http://www.injuriesboard.ie/eng/ Personal Injuries Assessment Board]\n* Intellectual Property Office of Ireland\nDepartment of the Environment, Climate and Communications\n* Commission for Communications Regulation\n* Commission for Regulation of Utilities\n* Digital Hub Development Authority\n* Environmental Protection Agency\n* Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission\n* [http://www.fisheriesireland.ie/ Inland Fisheries Ireland]\n* [https://archive.today/20120906070538/http://www.nora.ie/ National Oil Reserve Agency]\n* Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland\nDepartment of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science\n* Grangegorman Development Agency\n* Higher Education Authority\n* [http://research.ie/ Irish Research Council]\n* Quality and Qualifications Ireland\n* Science Foundation Ireland\n* SOLAS\nDepartment of Health\n* [http://www.dentalcouncil.ie/ Irish Dental Council]\n* Food Safety Authority of Ireland\n* Food Safety Promotion Board\n* [http://www.coru.ie/ Health & Social Care Professionals Council]\n* Health Information and Quality Authority\n* Health Insurance Authority\n* [https://www.hpra.ie/ Health Products Regulatory Authority]\n* Health Research Board\n* Health Service Executive\n* Irish Blood Transfusion Service\n* [http://www.mhcirl.ie/ Irish Mental Health Commission]\n* Medical Council of Ireland\n* [http://www.ncri.ie/ National Cancer Registry Ireland]\n* National Paediatric Hospital Development Board\n* National Treatment Purchase Fund\n* Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland\n* Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland\n* Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council\nDepartment of Housing, Local Government and Heritage\n* An Bord Pleanála\n* Dublin Docklands Development Authority\n* Electoral Commission\n* Heritage Council\n* [https://www.housingagency.ie/ Housing Agency]\n* [http://www.hfa.ie/hfa/Live/Release/WebSite/HomePage/index.html Housing Finance Agency]\n* Irish Water Safety\n* [http://www.lgma.ie/ Local Government Management Agency]\n* [http://www.rtb.ie/ Residential Tenancies Board]\n* Tailte Éireann\n* Waterways Ireland\nDepartment of Justice\n* Garda Síochána\n* Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission\n* Irish Film Classification Office\nDepartment of Public Expenditure and Reform\n* Interreg\n* Special EU Programmes Body\nDepartment of Rural and Community Development\n* [http://www.wdc.ie/ Western Development Commission]\nDepartment of Social Protection\n* [http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/en/ Citizens Information Board]\n* [http://www.pensionsauthority.ie/en/ Pensions Authority]\nDepartment of the Taoiseach\n* National Economic and Social Council\nDepartment of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media\n* Arts Council\n* Coimisiún na Meán\n* Chester Beatty Library\n* Crawford Art Gallery\n* Fáilte Ireland\n* Foras na Gaeilge\n* Fís Éireann/Screen Ireland\n* Irish Museum of Modern Art\n* National Concert Hall\n* National Library of Ireland\n* National Museum of Ireland\n* Sport Ireland\n* Tourism Ireland\n* Údarás na Gaeltachta\n* Ulster-Scots Agency\nDepartment of Transport\n* [http://www.ucd.ie/mbrs/ Medical Bureau of Road Safety]\n* [http://www.crr.ie/ Commission for Railway Regulation]\n* Irish Aviation Authority\n** Air Accident Investigation Unit\n** Commission for Aviation Regulation\n* Iarnród Éireann\n* National Transport Authority\n* Commission for Railway Regulation\n** Railway Accident Investigation Unit\n* Road Safety Authority\n* Transport Infrastructure Ireland\nOffice of the Attorney General\n* Law Reform Commission\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.gov.ie/en/help/departments/#agencies Government of Ireland: Agencies]"
