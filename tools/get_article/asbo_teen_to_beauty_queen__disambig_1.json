Each week, the participants face a series of tasks designed to prepare them to compete in the pageant and at the end of each episode, girls were eliminated from the series. In the last programme, the final three girls flew to Chicago and one was selected as the first Miss Teen England International to enter the pageant. The series was produced for Five by North One Television and has been syndicated on the Swedish Channel TV400 as Från värsting till skönhetsdrottning.\nThe nine participants were Laura Wilde, Rachel Stewart, Pavia Ward, Ellen Murphy, Neisha Berryman, Ashlie Robinson, Kerry Turner, Sarah Snabities and Elena Demetri. Only Wilde had been the subject of an anti-social behaviour order (ASBO).\n}}\nExternal links\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBu0fveajAY Trailer for the programme]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070926224239/http://tv4.se/tvtabla/episode/420384.html TV4.se]"
