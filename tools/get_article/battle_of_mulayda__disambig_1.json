Following problems over Zakat and the arrest of the Rashidi leader, Ibn Sabhan, the Rashidis planned to end the Saudi State and conquer both Qassim region and Riyadh. The Rashidis and their Arab ally clans successfully ended the Second Saudi State, forcing the House of Saud, led by Abdul Rahman bin Faisal, and their allies to flee.\nSee also\n* List of wars involving Saudi Arabia\nReferences\n* Musil, op, p.&nbsp;279\n* Hogarth, The Penetration of Arabia, p.&nbsp;288\n* Winder. p.&nbsp;499\n* Anne Blunt, op, cit, vol,2 p.&nbsp;2-3\n* Philby, Arabia of the Wahabis p.&nbsp;275"
