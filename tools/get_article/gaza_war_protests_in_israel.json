On 29 February, activists from Standing Together held up bags of flour in protest of the Al-Rashid massacre, stating, \"In Gaza today more than a hundred people were killed in line for flour and food.

One prominent teenage objector stated, \"The criminal attack on Gaza won’t solve the atrocious slaughter that Hamas executed.\" Another objector stated she refused to participate in Israel's \"violent policies of oppression and apartheid\".

We are not standing by anymore\". In April 2024, a group of rabbis from Israel and the U.S. were arrested trying to bring food to the Gaza Strip border. In May 2024, a group of activists from Standing Together protected a humanitarian aid convoy.\nIn July 2025, thousands of Israelis marched to Kirya military base in Tel Aviv, demanding an end of the Gaza war and stop the starvation in the Gaza Strip. Protestors reportedly carried bags of flour and photos of children in Gaza dying from hunger during the war. Alon-Lee Green, co-director of Standing Together told Haaretz, \"We cannot believe that we need to march against starvation of children and innocent people. They're understanding that this is the reality, that it's not a [fake] campaign as some journalist or politicians say. There is starvation. A lot of these Israelis are asking, 'okay, so I know there is a dire situation there. What do I do now?' This is our attempt to call on people to do something.\"\nAnti-Palestinian protests\nProtest against humanitarian aid\nOn 21 December 2023, activists attempted to block the Kerem Shalom border crossing to prevent humanitarian aid from entering the Gaza Strip.

They stormed the facility's gates chanting \"shame\" and unsuccessfully tried to break into both Sde Teiman and the Beit Lid military base. Hanoch Milwidsky, when asked whether it was legitimate \"to insert a stick into a person's rectum,\" replied, \"Yes! If he is a Nukhba, everything is legitimate to do!

Dozens of rabbis signed a letter to Netanyahu and senior defence officials stating that \"even when the enemy hides behind a human shield... there is no halakhic or moral preclusion, nor legal preclusion, from bombing the enemy after sufficient advance warning\".\nA group of 100 doctors called \"Doctors for the Rights of Israeli Soldiers\", signed a statement stating Israel had a \"legitimate right\" to bomb \"terror nests and Hamas headquarters in the hospitals in Gaza\". This prompted a harsh reply from the acting head of the ethics office at the Israel Medical Association, Dr. Tami Karni, who wrote that \"doctors are sworn to heal, not kill... Israel's doctors have refused to be dragged into the consciental and moral decline of the enemy, and will continue to act accordingly\". The White Robes, an organization which numbers in the hundreds, decried the letter as a \"provocative pamphlet by an extremist minority\", stating that \"calls for indiscriminate destruction and killing, even if justified militarily, are not part of the medical ethical code\". Physicians for Human Rights published an open letter signed by 350 physicians and medical personnel, which also condemns the aforementioned call.\nIn May 2024, 1,400 academics signed a petition calling for an end to the war.\nIsraelis abroad\nJews and Israelis abroad participated in protests both supporting and protesting the Israeli response in the war.\nReactions\nIn May 2024, Jake Sullivan, the US National Security Advisor, speaking about Israeli settlers who blocked aid from Jordan, spilling supplies to the ground, said, \"It is a total outrage that there are people who are attacking and looting these convoys... this is completely and utterly unacceptable behaviour.\"\nReferences"
