A graduate of the University of St Andrews, he held the Glenfiddich Research Fellowship and a Post-Doctoral Fellowship of the British Academy at St Andrews before being appointed Mackie Lecturer in History at the University of Aberdeen in 1995. He subsequently moved to the University of Edinburgh, where he is now Professor of Medieval Scottish History. Boardman's work focuses on kingship and the nobility in the later Middle Ages, and he has completed work on Scottish kings Robert II and Robert III, as well as Clan Campbell. The former is the only work to deal specifically with those monarchs.\nSelect bibliography\n* The Early Stewart Kings: Robert II and Robert III, 1371-1406. Tuckwell Press. 1996\n* Editor.
