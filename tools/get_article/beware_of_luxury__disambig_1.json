The \"luxury\" in the title recalls the word's Latin root of  or lust. The rowdy merrymakers are shown assembled in an inverted triangle formation having at its center the obviously loose-living young woman smiling flirtatiously at the viewer.\nJan Steen's picture is a realistic yet funny distortion of a Dutch family home living in chaos, and it may serve as a warning to viewers of the foolishness and repercussions of such a lifestyle.\nSome of the themes of the painting are also to be found in Steen's humorously moralizing painting The Effects of Intemperance.\nDescription\nThe painting is a humorous and satirical depiction of a wealthy Dutch family indulging in excess and luxury, with a moral message about the dangers of excess and the virtues of moderation. Through its rich symbolism and detailed composition, the painting captures the contradictions and complexities of Dutch society in the 17th century. The canvas is a humorous illustration of a Dutch saying: , which, in full, loosely translates as \"In good times, beware the consequences\". In this case, the lady of the house has fallen asleep, allowing the other members of the family to take full advantage. Her husband in the foreground is carrying on a dalliance with the provocative young woman, who is holding a glass of wine between his legs. He is laughing off the admonitions of a nun or beguine. A younger child is helping herself to something from a cabinet, and her young brother is trying out a pipe. The youngest child is playing with a string of pearls, the eldest son is playing a violin, the dog is on the table finishing off the meal, and a pig has wandered into the room.\nThe painting depicts a luxurious interior filled with expensive furnishings and decorations, including a marble fireplace, a chandelier, and ornate tapestries. However, the home is hopelessly disorganized. Six adults, two kids, a newborn, a pig, a duck, a monkey, and a dog are all visible.  A young woman turns to face us while holding a glass of red wine in her left hand and puts it on the male crotch. Her low neckline is more typical of a bartender or a prostitute. A woman and an older gentleman who is reading to him from the book he is holding have the man sitting next to them distracted. The older man is observing a little girl take an object from a cabinet while playing the violin. There is an older man who has a duck on his shoulder. The monkey is standing on top of a shelf while holding a string that is attached to a clock on the right. Despite the commotion, the woman continues to sleep without hearing the bowl crash to the ground. A little child with a pipe sitting next to her blows smoke at her to wake her up and informs her that the dog standing on the table is eating their meat pie or waking the woman up. The pig nuzzled on the floor, smelling the flower that the older guy had dropped. There are scattered objects across the floor: a man hat, his pipe, cars, a notebook, a bowl, a cup, a water pitcher, and pretzels. The artist has painted a basket hanging from the ceiling with crutches and a sword dangling hazardously from it.\nInterpretation\nThe scene is a commentary on the excesses and indulgences of Dutch society in the 17th century, a time of great wealth and prosperity for the Dutch Republic. Jan Steen was known for his humorous and satirical paintings, which often mocked the behavior and attitudes of the Dutch bourgeoisie. Beware of Luxury is no exception, as it pokes fun at the self-indulgent and frivolous lifestyle of the wealthy.\nAt the same time, however, the painting also carries a moral message about the dangers of excess and the virtues of moderation. The title of the painting, Beware of Luxury, is a warning to the viewer to avoid the temptations of excess and to live a virtuous and balanced life. The composition of the painting reinforces this message, as the figures are shown engaged in various forms of excess and indulgence, from drinking and eating to playing music and reading frivolous books.\nSymbolism\nBeware of Luxury is a complex and multi-layered painting that reflects the contradictions and complexities of Dutch society in the 17th century. Through its satire, symbolism, and moral message, it invites the viewer to reflect on the virtues of moderation and the dangers of excess. The dog stealing meat from the table is a symbol of greed and excess, while the man stumbling down the stairs is a symbol of drunkenness and debauchery.\nOther warnings of the consequences of immoral behavior include the Quaker with a duck on his shoulder reading out pious texts and a basket of instruments of punishment hanging from the ceiling. The moral of the story is clear: sinners guilty of the deadly sin of lust (an uncontrolled desire for earthly pleasure) must expect some penalty.\nAnother saying is brought to mind by the pig nuzzling the rose. The phrase \"throwing roses before swine\" refers to wastefulness. The monkey stopping the clock reminds us of the saying, \"Time is forgotten in folly.\"  A \"quacking\" duck represents incoherent chatter.  The duck on the man's shoulder most likely relates to his talk being pointless banter in which they have decided to ignore the mayhem around them.\nMaterials\nIt was created using oil paint on canvas. Oil paint is a medium that has been used by artists for centuries, and it allows for rich and vibrant colors as well as a wide range of textures and effects. Canvas, on the other hand, is a durable and flexible material that has been used for painting since the 14th century. It is made from tightly woven fabric, usually made of linen or cotton, that is stretched over a wooden frame. Canvas provides a smooth surface for painting and allows for the application of multiple layers of paint without cracking or flaking. In addition to canvas and oil paint, Jan Steen likely used a variety of other materials and tools to create Beware of Luxury. For example, he may have used brushes of different sizes and shapes to apply the paint, as well as a palette knife or other tools to create texture and depth.\nSteen may have also used a technique called underpainting, in which a layer of paint is applied to the canvas before the final layers are added. This technique helps to create depth and luminosity in the painting, as well as providing a foundation for the final layers of paint.\nOverall, the materials and techniques used by Jan Steen in creating Beware of Luxury are typical of Dutch painting in the 17th century, which was known for its use of oil paint on canvas and its focus on realism and detail. These materials and techniques allowed Steen to create a rich and complex painting that captures the contradictions and complexities of Dutch society in his time.\nOther version\nFile:Jan Steen - Beware of Luxury (“In Weelde Siet Toe”) - Google Art ProjectFXD.jpg|alt=Jan Steen - Beware of Luxury (“In Weelde Siet Toe”) - Google Art ProjectFXD.jpg[6]|Jan Steen - Beware of Luxury (“In Weelde Siet Toe”)\nFile:Jan Steen, Kunsthistorisches Museum Wien, Gemäldegalerie - \"Die verkehrte Welt\" - GG 791 - Kunsthistorisches Museum.jpg|alt=Jan Steen, Kunsthistorisches Museum Wien, Gemäldegalerie - \"Die verkehrte Welt\" - GG 791 - Kunsthistorisches Museum.jpg[7]|Jan Steen, Kunsthistorisches Museum Wien, Gemäldegalerie - \"Die verkehrte Welt\"\nFile:Jan Steen - Beware of Luxury (“In Weelde Siet Toe”) - Google Art Project.jpg|alt=Jan Steen - Beware of Luxury (“In Weelde Siet Toe”) - Google Art Project.jpg[8]|Jan Steen - Beware of Luxury (“In Weelde Siet Toe”)\nReferences"
