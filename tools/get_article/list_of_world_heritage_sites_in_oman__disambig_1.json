Blue dots indicate the sites of the Land of Frankincense while green are the sites of the Aflaj Irrigation Systems.|float=right|width=180}}\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) designates World Heritage Sites of outstanding universal value to cultural or natural heritage which have been nominated by signatories to the 1972 UNESCO World Heritage Convention. Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Oman accepted the convention on 6 October 1981, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. It has five World Heritage Sites and a further seven sites on the tentative list.\nThe first site listed in Oman was the Bahla Fort in 1987, while the most recent one was the Ancient City of Qalhat in 2018. All five sites are listed for their cultural significance. Bahla Fort was listed as endangered in 1988 because of the degradation of the structure. In 2004, after reconstruction, it was removed from the endangered list. The Arabian Oryx Sanctuary, originally listed for its natural significance in 1994, was directly delisted in 2007, the first World Heritage Site to lose its status, as Oman had substantially reduced the protected area and commenced oil extraction, and because of the falling oryx population. Oman has served on the World Heritage Committee three times.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (governorate)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Bahla Fort\n|\n| Ad Dakhiliyah\n| 1987\n| 433; iv (cultural)\n| The large mudbrick fort and the adjacent small oasis settlement date to the late Middle Ages, between the 12th and 15th centuries, and were constructed by the Banu Nebhan tribe. Bahla was the centre of Ibadi Islam. The fort is a pre-gunpowder building with round watchtowers and castellated parapets. Due to deterioration of the structure, the site was listed as endangered in 1988. Upon reconstruction, it was removed from the endangered list in 2004.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Archaeological Sites of Bat, Al-Khutm and Al-Ayn\n|\n| Al Dhahirah\n| 1988\n| 434; iii, iv (cultural)\n| This site comprises three clusters of ancient necropolises and settlements from the Early Bronze Age, in the 3rd millennium BCE. During that period, the area was important for extraction of copper which was exported to Mesopotamia and possibly to the Indus Valley. The earliest constructions are in mudbrick while later are made with cut stone. Tombs from different periods have different styles. There are beehive tombs, dry-stone cairn tombs, small single-chambered, and elaborate multi-chambered tombs. A mound at Al-Ayn is pictured.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Land of Frankincense\n|\n| Dhofar\n| 2000\n| 1010; iii, iv (cultural)\n| Frankincense, resin of the Boswellia sacra tree (pictured), was one of the most important luxury items of the Classical antiquity. This site comprises Wadi Dawkah where frankincense was collected, a trading post and caravan supply station at Shisr, and ports of Khor Rori and Al-Baleed which were heavily fortified. Khor Rori started to decline in the 5th century while Al-Baleed lost its role with the arrival of European trade in the 15th century. The site was originally listed as The Frankincense Trail but renamed to its present name in 2005.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Aflaj Irrigation Systems of Oman\n|\n| Ad Dakhiliyah, Al Batinah, Ash Sharqiyah South\n| 2006\n| 1207; v (cultural)\n| Aflaj is a traditional irrigation system in Oman that has been in use since at least the year 500. Groundwater or spring water is collected and delivered through a series of underground or surface channels to the settlements for domestic or agricultural purposes. The enclosed settlements, forts, palaces, watchtowers, and temporary dwellings used during the date harvest shape the cultural landscape that was made possible by irrigation of this otherwise harsh and very dry desert land. There are around 3,000 functioning aflaj systems in Oman that still provide a large part of the water used in the country. The World Heritage Site comprises five representative sites, Falaj Daris is pictured.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ancient City of Qalhat\n|\n| Ash Sharqiyah South\n| 2018\n| 1537; i, iii (cultural)\n| Qalhat flourished as the secondary capital of the Kingdom of Hormuz between the 11th and 16th centuries.

The city was attacked by the Portuguese in the 16th century and abandoned afterwards. The site comprises the remains of the city, its fortifications, and necropolises. Bibi Maryam mausoleum is pictured.\n|-\n|}\nTentative list\nIn addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list.
