      "text": "# Hiroshi (owarai)__disambig_1\n\n, real name , is a Japanese comedian famous for his stand-up act.\nOriginally a member (a quick-tempered tsukkomi) of a kombi called Babies (ベイビーズ), he started working as a host in Tokyo under the host name Ken Saegami (冴神剣 Saegami Ken) when Babies dissolved. Making a mere amount of yen equivalent to $800 per month, he worked as a host for nearly 3 years.\nAfter quitting his host job, he returned to the comedy circuit with a new name, \"Hiroshi\"—taken from the announcer Hiroshi Ikushima (生島ヒロシ Ikushima Hiroshi)—and a new gimmick; one that would eventually gain him stardom in 2004 while landing stand-up spots on various comedy programs including the popular The god of Entertainment. (エンタの神様). His skit always follows the same formula: A simple introduction followed by a recollection of past and present pitiful episodes in his life after which he repeats, \"I am Hiroshi.\" (ヒロシです/Hiroshi desu), while Italian singer Peppino Gagliardi's \"Che vuole questa musica stasera\" plays in the background.\nHe is always seen wearing typical host-style apparel, and he is known as a depressed character, which is reflected in his skits, and in the way he is treated by other owarai talents.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080822085514/http://www.sunmusic.org/get/profile/profile_hiroshi.html Sun Music Profile]"
