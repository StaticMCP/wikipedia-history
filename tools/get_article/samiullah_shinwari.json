He is a right-handed batsman and leg break bowler. He made his international debut, against Scotland, in April 2009.\nCareer\nDomestic career\nShinwari played for the then newly formed Afghan Cheetahs team in the Faysal Bank Twenty-20 Cup 2011-12. In the final group stage match of the 2018 Ghazi Amanullah Khan Regional One Day Tournament, he scored 192 not out, batting for Speen Ghar Region against Amo Region. He finished the tournament as the leading run-scorer, with 398 runs in six matches.\nIn September 2018, Shinwari was named in Paktia's squad in the first edition of the Afghanistan Premier League tournament.\nInternational career\nShinwari is  part of the rapidly rising Afghan cricket team that in under a year has won the World Cricket League Division Five, Division Four and Division Three, thus promoting them to Division Two and allowing them to partake in the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier where they gained One Day International (ODI) status.\nShinwari was run out just one run short of his highest score in ODIs. He had scored 82 against Kenya in Amstelveen in 2010. This was his fourth fifty in ODIs and his first against a Test nation.\nAsghar Stanikzai and Shinwari added 164 runs for the sixth wicket for Afghanistan which was the highest sixth-wicket partnership in the Asia Cup beating the 112 runs added by Alok Kapali and Mahmudullah against India at National Stadium, Karachi in 2008. The partnership was Afghanistan's highest for the sixth wicket in ODIs and their first century partnership for that wicket. The partnership was also Afghanistan's third-highest partnership for any wicket and only their sixth hundred partnerships in ODIs.\nShinwari was a member of Afghanistan's 15 man squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. In November 2019, he was named as the captain of Afghanistan's squad for the 2019 ACC Emerging Teams Asia Cup in Bangladesh.\nOn 6 March 2020, against Ireland in the first T20I, Shinwari completed 1,000 T20I runs, thus becoming only the 4th Afghan player to reach 1,000 T20I runs.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
