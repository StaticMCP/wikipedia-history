The poll was dismissed as \"daft\" in The Guardian, and the result disputed by Anglicans and Catholics. Historians had nominated one person per century, and for the 12th century John Hudson chose Becket for being \"greedy\", \"hypocritical\", \"founder of gesture politics\" and \"master of the soundbite\". The BBC website also quoted Hudson as saying \"Those who share my prejudice against Becket may consider his assassination ... a fittingly grisly end.\" The BBC History  magazine editor suggested most other nominees were too obscure for voters.\nCitations\nReferences\n*"
