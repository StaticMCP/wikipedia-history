Bahadur Khan of the Mughal Empire defeated the Maratha army under Tukoji and took over Kalyan. The Marathas attempted a counter-offensive but failed, as they were repulsed by Mughal forces. Sambhaji later attempted a counterattack, defeating Bahadur Khan. Another attempt was made by Bahadur khan to recapture the fort, but was repulsed by Hambirrao Mohite.\nSee also\n*Battle of Wai\n*Sacking of Burhanpur (1681)\nReferences"
