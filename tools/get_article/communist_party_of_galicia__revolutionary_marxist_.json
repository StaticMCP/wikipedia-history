In the municipal elections of 1987, PCG-MR had 8 town councillors elected. In the general elections of 1986, the party gained 12,072 votes and, again, no seats.\nFollowing the bad result of the 1989 general elections, PCG-MR merged into the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party in 1991, and organized itself as an internal tendency called Left Unity (Unidade da Esquerda).\nElection results\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n!
