This engagement occurred during Abaqa’s third attempt to seize control of Syria.

In response, on Wednesday, 7 Shaʿbān / 27 March, a cavalry force of 1,500 men was dispatched to the area. Commanded by the emirs Isandamur al-Jurjī, Sayf al-Dīn Jajkīn, Bahādur Ās, Sayf al-Dīn Anas al-Jāmdār, and Sayf al-Dīn Ughurlu, the unit encountered the Ilkhanid troops while they were gathering booty near a location close to Urz on Saturday, 10 Shaʿbān 702 / 30 March 1303. The battle lasted from midday until late afternoon. According to Abū al-Fidāʾ, the clash was exceedingly bloody, and the Ilkhanids suffered a decisive defeat. Nearly 6,000 Turkmens—men, women, and children—were rescued from Ilkhanid captivity. The Mamluk cavalry subsequently returned to Ḥamā on 13 Shaʿbān / 2 April, bearing abundant spoils.\nAFTERMATH\nFollowing the clash near Urz, the defeat of the Ilkhanid vanguard not only secured the release of thousands of Turkmens but also undermined the morale of the Mongol–Armenian coalition. In its aftermath, the Mamluk command fortified its positions across Syria in anticipation of a full-scale invasion. Indeed, only a few days later, the main Ilkhanid host, advancing under the orders of Ghazan Khan, marched towards Damascus. The skirmish at Urz thus served as a prelude to the decisive Battle of Marj al-Ṣuffar (April 1303), where the Mamluks confronted the Ilkhanids in one of the most significant engagements of their protracted wars."
