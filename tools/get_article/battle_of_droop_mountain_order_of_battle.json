Hillsboro, spelled \"Hillsborough\" on some maps from that century, is located in the mountainous terrain of Pocahontas County, West Virginia. A Union brigade commanded by Brigadier General William W. Averell defeated a smaller Confederate force commanded by Brigadier General John Echols and Colonel William L. \"Mudwall\" Jackson. A second Union force commanded by Brigadier General Alfred N. Duffié, tried to prevent the Confederate retreat, but did not engage at Droop Mountain. Aware of Duffié's troops, Confederate forces escaped before he arrived.\nThe Union Army units, and their commanders, are listed first. The Confederate Army units, and their commanders, follow. Many of the men on both sides were from West Virginia. In one case, Confederate Captain James McNeil of the 22nd Virginia Infantry Regiment was captured by the 3rd West Virginia Mounted Infantry—the regiment of McNeil's half brother, Private Alfred McKeever. Not shown is the Confederate force commanded by Brigadier General John D. Imboden, which did not arrive at Droop Mountain in time for the battle and unsuccessfully pursued Averell in the days after the battle.\nAbbreviations used\nMilitary rank\n* BG = Brigadier General\n* Col = Colonel\n* Ltc = Lieutenant Colonel\n* Maj = Major\n* Cpt = Captain\n* Lt = 1st Lieutenant\n* Pvt = Private\nOther\n* w  = wounded\n* k  = killed\nUnion Army Department of West Virginia\nFourth Separate Brigade\nBG William W.
