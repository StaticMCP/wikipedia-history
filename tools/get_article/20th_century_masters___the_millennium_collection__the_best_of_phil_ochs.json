Focusing heavily on his debut for the label, Pleasures Of The Harbor, offering five of its eight tracks, it only offered two tracks from his other three studio albums and only one from his 1974 live album. These selections tend to de-emphasize the folk leanings of those later albums while embracing the more experimental leanings.\n| noprose = yes\n}}\nTrack listing\nReferences"
