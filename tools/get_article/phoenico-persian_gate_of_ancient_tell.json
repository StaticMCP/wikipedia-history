It separated the upper town from the lower town around the harbor.\nConstruction\nDuring the first millennium B.C., a stone-paved ramp linked the western harbor to the upper town. Archaeologists discovered a city gate complex in this area. A preserved threshold and pivot-stone are part of the first gate, which gave access to the complex. A second paved ramp led up to an inner gate. Later, the construction of Beirut’s fortifications from the 7th century A.D. onwards, destroyed this gate. A cobble pavement is all that remains. The gate complex separated the upper town from the lower town, around the harbor, where installations with circular silos and ovens, workshops and houses were built.\nHistory\nDuring the first millennium B.C., a stone-paved ramp linked the western harbor to the upper town.
