He served in the Eastern campaign from 1855 to 1856, after the fall of Sevastopol; this was his only war service. He was appointed an Instructor of Musketry in his regiment on 30 April 1857 and purchased his promotion to lieutenant and captain on 17 July. He was promoted to captain and lieutenant-colonel, again by purchase, on 8 March 1864, and on completion of the qualifying period of service was granted brevet rank as colonel on 4 March 1876. He became major in the Grenadier Guards on 11 October 1879 and lieutenant-colonel on 7 August 1880, and commanded the regiment from 1880 until he was placed on half-pay, 27 July 1885, and granted local rank as a brigadier-general while commanding the Brigade of Guards in Cyprus.\nClive was appointed Commandant at the Staff College, Sandhurst, on 21 December 1885 and was promoted to major-general on 26 December. He became Governor and Commandant of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst on 12 August 1888, remaining in that post until 1893. He was promoted lieutenant-general on 1 April 1892 and general on 12 January 1898, and retired on 19 December 1898. On 30 December 1906 he was made colonel of the King's (Liverpool Regiment).\nPolitical career\nClive succeeded his father (who had been unseated on petition) as Member of Parliament for Hereford in 1869, but only held the seat until 1871, when he resigned through appointment as Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds. He never returned to the House of Commons.
