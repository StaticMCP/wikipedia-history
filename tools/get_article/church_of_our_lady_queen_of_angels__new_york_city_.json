Archbishop Michael Corrigan asked the Capuchin friar Bonaventure Frey to establish a national parish for German Catholics Catholics who had moved north from Yorkville.\nThe Neo-Romanesque church was built and staffed by the Capuchin Friars. It was the third Capuchin parish in the city.\nAlthough the church closed in 2007, the parish school remains open. Our Lady Queen of Angels School is a member of Partnership Schools, a network of nine Catholic PreK-8 schools serving Cleveland and New York.\nOur Lady Queen of Angels convent is occupied by the Franciscan Sisters of the Renewal, who operate the \"Fr. Solanus Soup Kitchen\".\nReferences"
