Her mother died suddenly in August 1948 and her father later married Helen Ladbury Allen (née Baylis).\nAllen was a pupil at Walkerville Primary School and then went to Adelaide Girls High School from 1960 to 1964. She won a scholarship to study at the University of Adelaide, graduating in 1969 with a BA (hons) for her thesis on The Jews in the French Revolution.\nCareer\nAllen's academic career began at Salisbury Teachers College and from 1982 at the South Australian College of Advanced Education, following a restructure.

Following a further restructure of tertiary education in 1991 she joined the University of Adelaide where she was promoted associate professor in 2002 and full professor in 2007. In 1997 she was appointed the first head of the Department of Social Inquiry.\nOn her retirement in 2010 she was appointed professor emerita of the University of Adelaide. Colleagues organised a conference to celebrate her career in 2010 and the papers were published in the Australian Feminist Studies journal.\nAllen is a member of the Australian Historical Association and the Australian Critical Race and Whiteness Studies Association. From 2005 to 2010 she was on the board of the International Federation for Research on Women's History and editor of its newsletter. She was a board member of the History Trust of South Australia from 2001 to 2007 and again from 2013 to 2016.
