It is situated on the Great Dividing Range with views to the east of the Lockyer Valley through to Brisbane and to the west across the Darling Downs. Traditionally the area has been used for farming however in recent years the expansion of the Toowoomba Regional Council has led to acreage and other residential development.\nGeengee is a neighbourhood in the west of the locality (). It is based around the former Geengee railway station which operated from 1886 to 1961 on the now-closed Crows Nest railway line. The name Geengee is an Aboriginal word meaning green vegetation along a creek.\nHistory\nIn the 1860s to 1883 the area was called Five-Mile Camp. The name Cabarlah was used after Crows Nest railway line (from Toowoomba to Crows Nest) was built. It is thought that the name Cabarlah derived from an Aboriginal expression describing the ring-tailed possum. However, a 1930 newspaper article claims it is a \"Native name of the mountains in the neighbourhood\".\nThe Queensland Government set aside land for the Geham Cemetery (now the Cabarlah Cemetery) on 11 September 1878.
