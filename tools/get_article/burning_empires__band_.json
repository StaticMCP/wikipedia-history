A lot of my lyrics up to this point on the Burning Empires material is anti-civilization\", in addition to Spin Magazine describing the band as \"(ripping) out a heavy, furious sound with thundering double kick drums, screeching electric guitars, and Morgan’s vicious screams\".\nMembers\n* Matt Mixon – guitar\n* Ryan Morgan – lead  vocals\n* Stuart Ross – guitar\n* Kyle Johnson – bass\n* Andy Hurley – drums\nDiscography\n*Burning Empires (2009)\n*Heirs of the Soil (2010)\nReferences"
