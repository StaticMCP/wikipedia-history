Prior to taking over at Newtown, the club had come last three years in a row and had not played finals since 1973. Newtown would lose the 1981 grand final 20-11 against Parramatta.

And I think those feelings were reciprocated.\" However Ryan had a long media career.\nWarren Ryan wrote for the Sydney Morning Herald for many years as a sports journalist. He is also a former member of the ABC Grandstand rugby league commentary team; where, rather than calling the match play itself, he supplied special comments throughout the broadcast.\nRyan used the term \"old darky\" during the call of an NRL match between the Roosters and Bulldogs. He claimed he was quoting a scene from Gone with the Wind. After listeners' complaints, he was stood down from the ABC with his colleague David Morrow pending an investigation. The scene he claimed to refer to is the 'quittin' time' scene in which a slave calls quittin' time, presuming the role of the foreman.

While the investigation continued, Warren Ryan resigned. He had intended to retire at the end of the 2014 season, but brought it forward rather than face the results. Refusing to address the use of a racist term, Ryan said, \"The word used to describe the character was a direct quote from the film. There was no offence intended, so I won't be apologising. It would be insincere. Furthermore, there is no appeasing those who are determined to be offended. So that's it. I've had a long run and, for the most part, it's been very enjoyable.\"\nHe proposed his own finals system, an alternative to McIntyre Final Eight and AFL, but it was not accepted.\nPersonal life\nIn addition to his rugby league career, Ryan was also a long-time physical education teacher at Belmore Boys High School in Sydney's southwest.\nIn April 2006, Ryan's son Matthew died of heart failure at age 24 following an overdose of the party drug, gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB).\nOn 11 November 2016, Ryan was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm after an altercation at Pagewood Hotel.
