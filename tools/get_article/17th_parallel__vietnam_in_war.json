The film sets out to show the effects of the American bombing campaign on the Vietnamese people, who were mainly peasant farmers.\nSynopsis\nIn 1968, between South Vietnam under the control of the US Army and North Vietnam struggling for independence, a demilitarized zone was created around the 17th parallel. Joris Ivens and his wife, Marceline Loridan, went to this area around the village of Vinh Linh for two months to live among the peasants who had taken refuge in cellars in an attempt to survive the incessant bombing of the American artillery.\nXuân Phượng was assigned as the interpreter and host to Marceline Loridan and Joris Ivens.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
