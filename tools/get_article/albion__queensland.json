In the , Albion had a population of 3,446 people.\nGeography\nAlbion is bounded by Wooloowin in the north, Ascot in the east, Newstead in the south, and Windsor to the west, with Breakfast Creek defining the suburb border in its south and south-west.  Sandgate Road, a major road on the north side of Brisbane, runs through the middle of the suburb. A variety of housing styles, from former workers' cottages through to modern brick homes and unit blocks, can be found in Albion.\nBreakfast Creek is a neighbourhood within the west of the suburb ().\nHistory\nThe name Breakfast Creek comes from Breakfast Point, which was a rocky point of the downstream side of the creek and was named by explorer John Oxley during his 1823 exploration of the Brisbane River.\nIn 1860 John Petrie opened a quarry at Albion. It occupied a site that today would be in the vicinity of Comus Avenue,  loosely bounded by Crosby Road to the south, Morgan Street to the east, Tower Street to the north, and Lapraik Street to the west ().The name Albion comes from the Albion Hotel built by Thomas Hayseldon (also written as Hazeldon), which was so called because the white wall of Petrie's quarry reminded Hayseldon of the England's white cliffs (Albion being an old name for England, from the Latin albus meaning white). From 1866 to 1870, the proprietor was Edward Hudson. The low lying parts of Albion came into the limelight when a swampy area near the Breakfast Creek was designated as the racecourse. In 1885, it became the headquarters of the Smithfield Pony Club and later in 1895 of the Albion Park Racecourse. Many Chinese migrants settled here and the Temple of the Holy Triad was built on the Higgs Street for the local community in 1885-86.\nOn 17 May 1890 the Breakfast Creek Hotel opened.

The Sportsground is now the Albion Park Paceway.\nBreakfast Creek State School opened on 7 July 1890 and closed on 11 August 1961.  It was on the western side of Agnew Street (). Following the closure of the school, the Fortitude Valley Opportunity School relocated into the buildings, becoming Newstead Opportunity School. Later it was renamed Newstead Special School (). It closed in 1996.\nOn 27 September 1880, eight blocks of land of \"Corunna Estate\" were advertised for auction by John Cameron.\nIn 1883, a Baptist church opened in Albion.\nIn December 1884, \"Albion Township Estate\" made up of ninety-one allotments of land were advertised to be auctioned by Arthur Martin & Co., Auctioneers.

On 6 January 1912 a separate congregation was formed in Albion. Land for a church was bought at 86 McLennan Street in 1913 and the church was opened in 1915. In 1929, the Albion congregation helped to establish a new congregation in Kedron. In 1992, the Albion and Kedron congregations merged to form the Brisbane North congregation and the Albion church was sold in 1997.\nOn 5 December 1926, Roman Catholic Archbishop James Duhig laid the foundation stone for St Columban's College at \"Highlands\" at 451 Sandgate Road (). The school officially opened on Sunday 29 January 1928 as a school for boys operated by the Christian Brothers. In 1985 the Christian Brothers passed the management of the college to the Brisbane Diocese. This triggered a number of changes, a phasing out the primary school to focus on secondary schooling. In 1996 the school accepted enrolments from girls and in 1997 the school relocated to Caboolture.
