It was acquired by Oracle Corp in November 2008, and its assets were rolled into the Oracle Beehive collaboration platform.\nTacit was founded in 1997 as Tacit Knowledge Systems by David Gilmour, the founder of Giga Information Group (now owned by Forrester Research) and was headquartered in Palo Alto, CA.\nThe company was funded by Draper Fisher Jurvetson (Steve Jurvetson was a company director), Woodside Fund, Alta Partners and the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC). In-Q-Tel was also an early investor in the company. The firm was acquired by Oracle in November 2008.\nCompany history\nTacit’s first product, KnowledgeMail, was released in late 1999. KnowledgeMail was an expertise location system that automatically read email and other documents to form profiles of user interests and expertise.\nIn 2003, Tacit introduced ActiveNet, a browser-based version of KnowledgeMail. In 2003–2004, several companies trialed ActiveNet and Tacit’s underlying technologies, including GlaxoSmithKline, Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin, for example, piloted Tacit over five other expertise location vendors and later rolled the product out in its Space Systems Division. Ron Remy, the Deputy CIO for Space Systems, said, “We had a beryllium-welding problem solved by linking up two people who worked down the hall from each other, and they didn't realize that one had the answer the other one needed to solve this very serious technical problem that was holding up the entire project. We deemed the pilot to be very successful.”\nIn 2006, Tacit introduced a new product called illumio. illumio made Tacit’s expertise location technology available to everyday Internet users.\nTacit was acquired by Oracle in 2008 for an alleged 10M US. Oracle shut down the product in 2010.\nIntellectual property\nTacit holds 13 patents. These patents pertain to the following:\n* Creation of user profiles with public and private components\n* Assigning confidence levels to topics as they relate to users\n* Methodologies for accessing user profile information\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.tacit.com/ tacit.com], Wayback Machine\n*[https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1969777,00.asp PC Magazine: Startup Illumio Asks: Hey, Can You Help Me Find This?]\n*[http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1865074,00.asp ActiveNet 3.2 Review]\n*[http://www.adtmag.com/article.aspx?id=11100&amp;page=/ Application Development Tools: Tacit Makes The Collaboration Connection]\n*[http://www.computerwire.com/industries/research/?pid=45F34896%2D8498%2D40AD%2D8F26%2DBE1CCF8A9DE3 Computerwire: Tacit Puts Process Spin on Expertise Location]"
