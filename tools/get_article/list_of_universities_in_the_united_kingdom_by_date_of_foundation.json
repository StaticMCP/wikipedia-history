Modern universities have seen similar debate, with some universities having a heritage as educational institutions that pre-dates their current foundation or recognition as a university by over a hundred years, e.g. the use of 'Est 1824' on the  University of Manchester logo, reflecting the initial foundations of the Manchester Mechanics' Institute and the Manchester Royal School of Medicine in that year, despite the current foundation having been established (by the merger of two existing universities) in 2004. For the modern (post 1800) universities, the date of achieving university status (by royal charter, act of parliament, order in council, or decision of Companies House) is given. Former universities with extant successor institutions in the UK are given in italics.\nAncient universities\nUntil the nineteenth century there were only two successful long-term university establishments in England and five in Scotland (including two in Aberdeen, see below). This excludes the original University of Northampton, which gained university status in 1261 before being abolished in 1265, the University of Stamford, which existed from 1333 to 1335, and Cromwell's New College, Durham, which existed from 1653-1660 but was not granted degree-awarding powers.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

A royal charter was also issued in 1495. The university uses 1495 as its date of foundation. Merged with Marischal College (founded 1593) by act of parliament to form the University of Aberdeen in 1860, explicitly maintaining the precedence of King's College.\n|-\n| University of Edinburgh\n| Scotland\n| 1583\n|\n| Edinburgh Town Council granted a royal charter by James VI in April 1582 as the first college established by secular authorities in Scotland. Instruction began in October 1583. Attempts in the 17th century to gain a royal charter for the university itself (as opposed to the town council) failed due to the overthrow of James II and VII. Incorporated and made independent by the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858.\n|-\n| Marischal College\n|Scotland\n| 1593 to 1860\n|\n| Founded by George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal, later confirmed by act of parliament. Merged into the University of Aberdeen in 1860.\n|}\nNineteenth-century universities\nNo new universities were successfully founded in England or Scotland after 1600 until the nineteenth century, although the eighteenth century saw the establishment of a number of dissenting academies, medical schools such as St George's (1733) and the London Hospital Medical College (1785), and the Royal Veterinary College (1791).\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

These colleges survive today as Queen's University Belfast, University College Cork and NUI Galway.\n|-\n| | Royal University of Ireland\n| 1880 to 1909\n|\n| Established on the model of the University of London; the successor to the Queen's University of Ireland, comprising the three Queen's Colleges, as well as Magee College, University College Dublin, Catholic University Medical School, St. Patrick's College, Maynooth and Blackrock College. Dissolved in 1909, replaced by the National University of Ireland and Queen's University Belfast.\n|-\n| Victoria University\n| 1880 to 1903\n| Olim armis nunc studiis(Formerly by weapons, now by studies)\n| Federal university with its seat in Manchester, comprising colleges in Manchester (1880–1903), Liverpool (1884–1903) and Leeds (1887–1903). Merged with Owen's College, Manchester to form the Victoria University of Manchester in 1903. Current successor institute is the University of Manchester\n|-\n| University of Wales\n| 1893\n| Goreu Awen Gwirionedd(The best inspiration is truth)\n| See below\n|}\nThe University of Wales and the Victoria University were founded as federal universities incorporating earlier colleges and the University of London was founded as an examination board (becoming a federal university in 1900).  The federal universities are discussed further below.\nThe Andersonian Institute, a precursor of the University of Strathclyde, was established in 1796 and used the title Anderson's University between 1828 and 1887, but the University of Strathclyde did not receive a royal charter granting university status until 1964. Similarly, University College London used the title London University without being granted university status from 1826 to 1836. Both St Patrick's College, Maynooth (from 1896) and the\nCatholic University of Ireland (1854–1911) were universities by Papal Bull but were never recognised as such by the British state.\nCivic universities\nThese universities were distinguished by being non-collegiate (and thus, at the time, non-residential) institutions founded as university colleges that admitted men without reference to religion and concentrated on imparting to their students \"real-world\" skills, often linked to engineering. All were established as universities by royal charter, with an accompanying act of parliament to transfer the property and assets of the university college to the newly incorporated university. As this article lists universities by date of foundation, this section lists only the universities that gained their status in the period 1900–1959. There are some institutions generally regarded as civic universities and sharing many elements of common history with these universities that gained university status later than this (e.g. Newcastle in 1963 or Cardiff in 2005); these are listed under the appropriate time period.\nFirst wave of civic universities\nThe large civic \"red brick\" universities all gained official university status before the First World War. The term was first coined by a professor at the University of Liverpool to describe these universities, inspired by the university's Victoria Building which is built from a distinctive red pressed brick. All of the red brick institutions in Great Britain have origins dating back to older medical or engineering colleges which prepared students for University of London external examination; many were also members of the federal Victoria University for a period.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

They are distinguished from the \"red brick\" universities only by their date of foundation as universities, and are often classed together.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Name\n! University status\n! Motto\n! Notes\n|-\n| University of Reading\n| 1926\n|\n| Developed from University College Reading, founded by Christ Church, Oxford as an extension college in 1892.

Universities founded during the 1960s divide into two main groups: the plateglass universities, so called because of their dominant architectural style, and the former colleges of advanced technology that were converted to universities following the Robbins Report.\nThe plate glass universities are differentiated from the civic universities by not having been university colleges submitting students for external examination, but instead being created ab initio as universities with their own degree-awarding powers (under the supervision of academic oversight councils). The decision to create the plateglass universities was taken prior to the Robbins Report, and the report mentions them as being in the process of being established (Chapter IV). The approach of creating institutions with degree-awarding powers was pioneered by the University of Keele, which was established in 1949 as the University College of North Staffordshire with its own degree award powers, under the oversight of Oxford, Manchester and Birmingham.\nThe status of college of advanced technology (CAT) was created in the 1950s, although many of the institutes so designated dated back much further. The CATs were distinct from university colleges (although like them they prepared students for London degrees) and, along with their Scottish counterparts, were recommended to be converted into universities by the Robbins Report (Chapter X). They all entered the university sector in the 1960s, although some became colleges of federal universities rather than universities in their own right.\nIn addition to these, some civic universities (Dundee, Newcastle and, arguably, Keele) gained university status in this period. Dundee and Newcastle were, like the redbrick universities, recognised as university colleges from the start of the grant-in-aid programme in 1889, making them the last of the first-wave civic universities to become universities in their own right. Keele was founded as a university college, although (as mentioned above) with its own degree awarding powers, and was considered to be a second-wave civic university by Robbins. The Open University is also unusual, being the UK's only public distance learning university.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Name\n! University status\n! Motto\n!

Keele is not a plate glass university, not having been created as a university ab initio, and was considered a \"younger civic university\" by Robbins. It is listed here as it gained university status in the 1960s.\n|-\n| University of East Anglia\n| 1963\n| Do Different\n|\n|-\n| University of York\n| 1963\n| In limine sapientiae(On the threshold of wisdom)\n| York is a collegiate university and is made up of eleven colleges\n|-\n| Newcastle University\n| 1963\n| Mens agitat molem(Mind moves matter)\n| Traces its origins back to medical school founded in 1834 and associated with Durham University from the mid 19th century.

Its city-centre location, architecture, and history as a nineteenth century university college make Newcastle more similar to the redbricks than the plateglass universities, and it is often referred to as redbrick or a civic university.\n|-\n| Lancaster University\n| 1964\n| Patet omnibus veritas(Truth lies open to all)\n| Lancaster is a collegiate university and is made up of nine colleges\n|-\n| University of Strathclyde\n| 1964\n| The place of useful learning\n| Traces its origins back to the Andersonian Institute founded in 1796; used the title Anderson's University between 1828 and 1887 but did not receive a royal charter as a university until 1964.

Both of the 1980s universities are unusual: the University of Buckingham was Britain's first private university since the creation of the University Grants Committee after the First World War extended state funding to Oxford, Cambridge and Durham, while Ulster University was formed from the merger of a plate glass university with a polytechnic.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Thirty-eight (including institutions later merged) took up the offer immediately, nearly doubling the number universities again from 46 to 84 (and 89 by 1994). While commonly referred to as \"post-1992 universities\" (or new universities), many of these institutions claim heritage back to the nineteenth century.\nCranfield and UMIST (now merged into Manchester) both achieved university status in this period via royal charter rather than under the provisions of the 1992 act and are not generally regarded as \"new universities\". They are listed here with the 1992 universities to reflect the date when they gained their status.\nDue to the way in which these universities were created only days apart, all of the universities created in 1992 are listed alphabetically.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Merged with Victoria University of Manchester to form the University of Manchester in 2004.\n|}\n21st century universities\nAfter the conversion of the polytechnics and central institutions under the 1992 Act there was a pause before a second wave of institutions gained university status in the 21st century. These were university colleges and other higher education institutions that had gained degree awarding powers since 1992 rather than being granted them on the break up of the CNAA.\nFrom 1999, higher education policy has been a devolved power, although the actual award of university and degree awarding powers remains with the UK Privy Council. In 2004, the requirement that institutes gain research degree awarding powers before they could gain university status was dropped in England and Wales (but not in Scotland or Northern Ireland), although they were still required to have 4000 full-time equivalent students, with 3000 on degree courses. Eight university colleges without research degree awarding powers became universities in 2005. In 2012, the student numbers criterion for institutions in England was relaxed to 1000 full-time equivalent students (with 750 on degree courses) and a number of university colleges became universities. New guidance for England issued in September 2015 replaces the requirement for 750 students to be studying degree courses with a requirement that 55% of students are studying on degree courses.\nThis was also the era of the break-up of the federal University of Wales and the accreditation of its constituent colleges as individual universities, the secession of Imperial College from the University of London, and of mergers between a number of institutes that already had university status but which were dissolved to form a new university. In the case of many of these, the university so formed owes its status to a Royal Charter rather than the provisions of the 1992 act, making it legally distinct from the \"new universities\". As with the earlier overlap between plate glass and civic universities, these new \"old universities\" are listed here as institutions that became universities in the 21st century.\nThe Office for Students (OfS) was created by the Higher Education and Research Act 2017 and took over responsibility for approving university title in England in 2018. Up to July 2018, 51 further new universities have been created (including those created by mergers of existing universities) since 2000, bringing the total number to 132, of which 106 (including the Open University, which operates in all four countries of the UK, and 5 private universities) are in England, 9 in Wales, 2 in Northern Ireland, and 15 in Scotland. Two further new universities were recognised under legacy arrangements in 2018 and 2019 prior to a pause until 2022 as new arrangements under the OfS were put in place. Many of the first approvals under the OfS were member institutions of the University of London that had gained the power to apply for university status in their own right under the University of London Act 2018.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

It originally operated a system of affiliated institutions with two registers: one (controlled by the government) of institutions allowed to submit students for examination for Arts and Law degrees, with UCL and King's College London (KCL) as the two initial colleges named in the charter, and a second (controlled by the university) of institutions allowed to submit students for medical degrees. Apart from being allowed to submit students for London examinations, there was no connection between the affiliated colleges and the university.\nIn 1858, the affiliation system was abandoned for Arts and Law degrees, with these being opened to anyone willing to travel to London for the examinations. In 1900, following a period of pressure from UCL and KCL, the university was reorganised as a federal body after the model of the Victoria University and the University of Wales. Degrees were reorganised as external (the earlier open examinations, now University of London (Worldwide)) and internal (for students at  London institutions that became schools of the university).\nIn 2005–2006 University College London, King’s College London, the London School of Economics and Imperial College London gained the right to award degrees in their own name, although this right was not exercised until 2007. In 2007 Imperial College left the federation and became an independent university. Other institutions have since gone on to gain their own degree awarding powers, and a number of institutions have recently joined the federal structure. The University of London Act 2018 allowed member institutions to become universities in their own right while remaining part of the federal university; in February 2019 twelve colleges said they were applying to become universities.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!Institution\n!College founded\n!Joined federation\n!Full college\n!Notes\n|-\n|University College London\n|1826\n|1836\n|1900\n|Merged into University of London 1907–1977.

In the first two cases, the federal university merged with one of its colleges when it broke up (a process still ongoing as of July 2018 for Wales) while in the other three cases, where the university had previously existed as a non-federal body, it simply reverted to that status. In Ireland the Queen's University of Ireland was succeeded by the Royal University of Ireland which was succeeded (without Belfast) by the National University of Ireland, which continued to exist after Irish independence.\nThe longest lived of these federal institutions was the University of Wales, which was founded by royal charter in 1893 with the federation of University College Wales (now Aberystwyth University), University College North Wales (now Bangor University) and University College South Wales and Monmouthshire (now Cardiff University). Prior to this, students at these university colleges prepared for examinations of the University of London. The university grew with the addition of further colleges, and in 1971 St David's College, Lampeter (now part of the University of Wales Trinity Saint David), Wales' oldest degree-awarding institution, suspended its own degree-awarding powers and entered the University of Wales as St David's University College.\nIn 2007 the university changed from a federal structure to a confederation of independent institutions, allowing individual institutions which had gained the status of universities in their own right to use the title of university, and in 2008 Aberystwyth, Bangor and Swansea Universities decided to exercise their right to award their own degrees. This led to the effective break-up of the university in 2011, with it being decided that the University of Wales would merge with the University of Wales Trinity Saint David and no longer accredit other institutions. From August 2017 the two institutions have been functionally integrated although a legal merger has not (as of July 2018) been finalised.\nThis table of universities that were former members of federal universities is sorted primarily by when they became part of a federal university, with date of institutional foundation as a secondary index.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Institution\n!College founded\n!Original name\n!Federal university\n!Joined federation\n!Left federation\n!Notes\n|-\n|Queen's University Belfast\n|1845\n|Queens College Belfast\n|Queen's, Royal\n|1850\n|1908\n|\n|-\n|Victoria University of Manchester\n|1851\n|Owens College\n|Victoria\n|1880\n|1994\n|Owens College merged with the Victoria University in 1904 to form the Victoria University of Manchester.

It does not include institutions which did not receive official recognition as universities, such as the attempt to found a university at Stamford in the 14th century, Cromwell's New College, Durham in the 17th century, or colleges of the federal universities of Wales and London that never became independent universities. It also does not include universities in the Republic of Ireland that ceased to be UK universities on independence from the UK.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Name\n! University status\n! Motto\n!
