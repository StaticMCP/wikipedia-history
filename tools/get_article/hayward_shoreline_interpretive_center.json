It is directly adjacent to the north side of Highway 92 as it approaches the San Mateo–Hayward Bridge, and is accessed from the highway by the last offramp in the westbound direction before the bridge toll gates. The Center was dedicated in 1986, and is operated by the Hayward Area Recreation and Park District.\nActivities\nThe Center focuses on San Francisco Bay wetland and shoreline ecosystems, and is itself located next to restored wetlands formerly used as salt ponds. The Center operates primarily as a resource center for local schools' educational field trips. It is open to the public on weekends. The center has a small permanent exhibit of native, aquatic life, and rotating exhibits of other related subjects. It is an access point to the San Francisco Bay Trail. Binoculars are on loan for birdwatching. On the other side of Highway 92 is Eden Landing Ecological Reserve, operated by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.\nalong the San Francisco Bay Trail, adjacent to the center]]\nExternal links\n*[http://www.haywardrec.org/hayshore.html Hayward Shoreline Interpretive Center at the Hayward Area Recreation and Park District website]"
