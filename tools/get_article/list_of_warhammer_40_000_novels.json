      "text": "# List of Warhammer 40,000 novels\n\nAfter the 1987 release of Games Workshop's Warhammer 40,000 wargame, a military and  science fantasy universe set in the far future, the company began publishing background literature to expand on existing material, introduce new content, and provide detailed descriptions of the universe, its characters, and its events.\nSince 1997, most of the background literature has been published by the affiliated imprint Black Library. An expanding roster of authors contributes to a growing collection of fiction across various formats and media, including audio, digital and print. These works, which range from full-length novels and novellas, to short stories, graphic novels, and audio dramas, are parts of named book series.\nThe Horus Heresy\nNovel series\n*Book 001 - Horus
