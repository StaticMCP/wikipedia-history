The awards recognized Canadian writers for new works published in Canada during 1959.\nCanada Council for the Arts took over administration of the program sometime during 1959 or 1960 – after the 1958 Governor General's Awards that recognized 1958 publications. Canada Council arranged for the first cash prizes to award-winning writers, \"at least 6 prizes of $1000 each for fiction, nonfiction, and drama or poetry in English and French\". Thus, the program was expanded to cover French- as well as English-language works. Otherwise, the number of award categories was reduced from five to three – the juvenile category eliminated after 10 years, the double recognition of non-fiction after 17 years.\nIn the event, only four awards were conferred for 1959 publications, two for English-language and two for French.\nWinners\nEnglish Language\n*Fiction: Hugh MacLennan, The Watch That Ends the Night.\n*Poetry or Drama: Irving Layton, A Red Carpet for the Sun.\nFrench Language\n*Fiction: André Giroux, Malgré tout, la joie.\n*Non-Fiction: Félix-Antoine Savard, Le barachois.\nReferences"
