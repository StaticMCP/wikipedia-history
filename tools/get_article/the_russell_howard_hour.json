The series is hosted by Russell Howard where he gives his thoughts and opinions on current topics as well as featuring special guests and other stand-up comedians. The show is in a similar style to his previous show, Russell Howard's Good News, which aired on BBC Three and then BBC Two from 2009 to 2015.\nProduction\nOn 28 November 2017, it was announced that the show had been recommissioned for a second series, which began on 8 November 2018. Unlike the first series, the second series does not have a stand-up guest. Instead there is a segment titled \"Live Forever\" where Howard and another comedian test ways to live longer.\nOn 24 January 2019, it was announced that the show had been recommissioned for a third and fourth series. In Series 3, there was a segment called \"Play Date\" (which replaced \"Live Forever\") which showed Howard spending time with a celebrity.\nIn spring 2020, shortly after the end of series 3, the fourth series was revealed to be delayed until early Autumn that year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, Howard created a spin-off series called \"Russell Howard's Home Time\", featuring a similar format as the original show, except for a shorter 30-minute episode runtime. The programme was filmed at his home in Bath, Somerset due to social distancing measures, and began on 9 April 2020, running for 9 episodes.\nThe fourth series of The Russell Howard Hour'' began on 10 September 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the first episode of the series did not have a live audience. From episode two onwards, a live audience returned, albeit split into socially distanced groups.\nOn 17 December 2020, it was announced that the show had been recommissioned for a fifth and sixth series.\nOn 8 September 2022, the first episode of the sixth series was originally going to air, but it got pulled off air following the news of Queen Elizabeth II's death that night. After 2 days of delay, the episode was finally broadcast on Sky Max.\nWith the closure of Sky One, the original channel for The Russell Howard Hour, it was announced that the series would move to Sky Max.\nWith the exception of the Home Time spin-off, all episodes of the programme have been recorded at Television Centre in London.\nTransmissions\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
