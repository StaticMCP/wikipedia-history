The culture existed from 4300 to 2600 BC, and co-existed with the Yangshao culture. Turquoise, jade and ivory artefacts are commonly found at Dawenkou sites. The earliest examples of alligator drums appear at Dawenkou sites. Neolithic signs, perhaps related to subsequent scripts, such as those of the Shang dynasty, have been found on Dawenkou pottery. Additionally, the Dawenkou practiced dental ablation and cranial deformation, practices that disappeared in China by the Chinese Bronze Age.\nChronology\nArchaeologists commonly divide the culture into three phases: the early phase (4100–3500 BC), the middle phase (3500–3000 BC) and the late phase (3000–2600 BC). Based on the evidence from grave goods, the early phase was highly egalitarian. The phase is typified by the presence of individually designed, long-stemmed cups. Graves built with earthen ledges became increasingly common during the latter parts of the early phase. During the middle phase, grave goods began to emphasize quantity over diversity. During the late phase, wooden coffins began to appear in Dawenkou burials. The culture became increasingly stratified, as some graves contained no grave goods while others contained a large quantity of grave goods.\nThe type site at Dawenkou, located in Tai'an, Shandong, was excavated in 1959, 1974 and 1978. Only the middle layer at Dawenkou is associated with the Dawenkou culture, as the earliest layer corresponds to the Beixin culture and the latest layer corresponds to the early Shandong variant of the Longshan culture.\nPolitical organization\n}}|||}}\nThe term \"chiefdom\" seems to be appropriate in describe the political organization of the Dawenkou. A dominant kin group likely held sway over Dawenkou village sites, though power was most likely manifested through religious authority rather than coercion. Unlike the Beixin culture from which they descend, the people of the Dawenkou culture were noted for being engaged in violent conflict. Scholars suspect that they may have engaged in raids for land, crops, livestock and prestige goods.\nAgriculture and diet\nThe warm and wet climate of the Dawenkou area was suitable for a variety of crops, though they primarily farmed millet at most sites. Their production of millet was quite successful and storage containers have been found that could have contained up to 2000&nbsp;kg of millet, once decomposition is accounted for, have been found. For some of the southern Dawenkou sites, rice was a more important crop however, especially during the late Dawenkou period. Analysis done on human remains at Dawenkou sites in southern Shandong revealed that the diet of upper-class Dawenkou individuals consisted mainly of rice, while ordinary individuals ate primarily millet.\nThe Dawenkou  people successfully domesticated chicken, dogs, pigs and cattle, but no evidence of horse domestication was found. Pig remains are by far most abundant, accounting for about 85% of the total, and are thought to be the most important domesticated animal. Pig remains were also found in Dawenkou burials also highlighting their importance. Seafood was also an important staple of the Dawenkou diet. Fish and various shellfish mounds have been found in the early periods indicating that they were important food sources. Although these piles became less frequent in the later stages, seafood remained an important part of the diet.\nCulture\nDawenkou's inhabitants were one of the earliest practitioners of trepanation in prehistoric China. A skull of a Dawenkou man dating to 3000 BC was found with severe head injuries which appeared to have been remedied by this primitive surgery. Alligator hide drums have also been found in Dawenkou sites.\nFile:Dawenkou Culture Jade Necklace 01.jpg|Jade necklace, dated between 3500 and 2600 BC\nFile:20210529 Red pottery animal-shaped pot on display at Zhengzhou Museum.jpg|Red animal-shaped vessel\nFile:镂雕弦纹象牙梳08773.jpg|Ivory comb with openwork design\nFile:Yanzhou Museum 2015.08.13 15-22-17.jpg|Ceramic bracelets or rings\nFile:Bowl, Dawenkou Culture, 3500 BCE Nanjing.jpg|Painted bowl, dated circa 3500 BC\nFile:Dawenkou Culture Stone Adze.jpg|Stone adze\nFile:Painted Pottery Dou with Octagram Design.jpg|Stemmed vessel (dou 豆) with painted star motif\nPainted Pottery A Container (c. 3,800—3,300 BCE) Excavated at the Diaolongbei Site, Zaoyang, Hubei.

Capital Museum, Beijing.\nInteractions with other cultures\nThe Dawenkou interacted extensively with the Yangshao culture. \"For two and a half millennia of its existence the Dawenkou was, however, in a dynamic interchange with the Yangshao Culture, in which process of interaction it sometimes had the lead role, notably in generating Longshan. Scholars have also noted similarities between the Dawenkou and the Liangzhu culture as well as the related cultures of the Yantze River basin.  According to some scholars, the Dawenkou culture may have a link with a pre-Austronesian language. Other researchers also note a similarity between Dawenkou inhabitants and modern Austronesian peoples in cultural practices such as dental avulsion and architecture. However, the Dawenkou appeared to be genetically distinct from the pre-Austronesian cultures to their south.\nPhysical characteristics\nThe physical similarity of the Jiahu people to the later Dawenkou (2600 BC±4300 BC) indicates that the Dawenkou might have descended from the Jiahu, following a slow migration along the middle and lower reaches of the Huai and Hanshui. Other scholars have also speculated that the Dawenkou originate in nearby regions to the south. The Dawenkou descends from the Beixin, but is deeply influenced by the northward-expanding Longqiuzhuang culture located between the Yangtze and Huai.\nThe people of Dawenkou exhibited a primarily Sinodont dental pattern. They practiced body modification in the form of dental ablation and cranial deformation.\nThe Dawenkou were also physically dissimilar to the Neolithic inhabitants of Hemudu, South China, and Taiwan. DNA testing revealed that the Neolithic inhabitants of Shandong were closer to ancient Northern East Asians.  According to Liu et al 2021, their mtDNA results reveal that between 9500BP and 1800BP, significant southern East Asian mitochondrial haplogroups were present in the ancient Shandong population. From the middle Dawenkou period onwards, a significant influx of middle Yellow River farmer ancestry from the Yangshao culture mixed with the populations of Shandong. The people of the Shandong Longshan culture inherited much of their ancestry from the Dawenkou culture, indicating genetic continuity between the two groups.\nGallery\nFile:Jinan 2009 1143.jpg|Painted bowl and beaker\nFile:National Museum of China 2014.02.01 15-02-56.jpg|Two white ceramic pitchers (guī 鬹)\nFile:National Museum of China 2014.02.01 15-03-26.jpg|Two painted red jars\nFile:National Museum of China 2014.02.01 14-57-21.jpg\nFile:Zoucheng Museum 2015.08.14 16-25-27.jpg\nFile:Dawenkou black pottery goblets.
