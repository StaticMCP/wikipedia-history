It is perhaps most famous for its use in many John Ford films, such as Stagecoach (1939) and The Searchers (1956). It has also been featured in such films as Easy Rider (1969), directed by and co-starring Dennis Hopper; Forrest Gump (1994), directed by Robert Zemeckis, and The Eiger Sanction (1975), directed by and starring Clint Eastwood; and in two episodes of the popular United Kingdom television show Doctor Who: \"The Impossible Astronaut\" (23 April 2011) and \"Day of the Moon\" (30 April 2011).\nThe twin buttes of Monument Valley (\"the Mittens\"), the \"Totem Pole\", and the \"Ear of the Wind\" arch, among other features, have developed iconic status. They have appeared in many television programs, commercials, and Hollywood movies, especially Westerns.\nthe Mittens\", Merrick Butte and the road which makes a loop-tour through the Park]]\nMotion pictures\nFilms\nJohn Ford's Point in Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park\n*The Vanishing American (1925)\n*The Lone Star Ranger (1930)\n* Stagecoach (1939), directed by John Ford and starring John Wayne, has had an enduring influence in making the Valley famous.
