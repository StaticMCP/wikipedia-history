The game is developed by Reality Pump Studios, and is published by TopWare Interactive.\nIron Sky: Invasion is a space fighter simulator, enhanced with strategic and RPG elements, set in the universe of Iron Sky and expanding upon its foundations. The core of the gameplay is based on ship-to-ship dogfights, combined with assaults on giant spaceships (such as the space Zeppelins, portrayed in the film), as well as tactical thinking and resource management.\nThe game was first announced on August 19, 2012, by the video game publisher TopWare Interactive, during the Gamescom trade fair in Cologne, Germany. It was released in Europe on December 12, 2012, for the Windows, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, iOS, Android, and Mac OS platforms. It has received mixed to negative reviews from critics.\nGameplay\nThe game takes place in outer space, where the players must defend the Earth from the invasion of the Moon Nazis, as depicted in the 2012 film. The players can control most of the spaceships from the movie, to freely roam the space and attack Nazi vessels. There are weapons and equipment at their disposal, from offensive systems to defensive drones and satellites. The vessels are also equipped with military countermeasures which protect them from enemy fire, and can be recharged, upgraded, or traded for other models. Upgrades require special resources, which can be scavenged from destroyed enemy units or found in outer space. A tactical space map can be used to spot the positions of Nazi forces or ongoing battles, with the destruction of the secret Nazi base hidden on the Dark Side of the Moon set as the ultimate goal.\nSee also\n*Nazi UFOs\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.facebook.com/IronSkyInvasion/ Iron Sky: Invasion Facebook page]\n*[http://ironskyinvasion.com/ Official game website]\n*[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/video-game-film-iron-sky-363970 The Hollywood Reporter press release on the game]"
