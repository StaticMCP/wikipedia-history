On 4 August 2020, the ship was badly damaged by an explosion in Beirut, Lebanon, near where she was berthed, and subsequently capsized.\nHistory\nOriginally named Vistamar, the ship was operated under charter by German-based cruise companies, first Jahn Reisen  then Plantours & Partner. The ship was operated in the Caribbean and the Mediterranean, but also undertook voyages to the Arctic and the Antarctic, to Greenland and up the Amazon River. In 2003 it sailed through the Amazon River to Iquitos, Peru, around  from the coast of Atlantic Ocean, becoming the first large cruise ship to do so.\nIn 2001, Vistamar struck a submerged object in the South Atlantic; in 2003, it struck submerged rocks near Ibiza (the ship's then home port) soon after departing on a 12-day cruise, and required repair in drydock. The ship was towed back by tugs and the passengers disembarked.\nIn the 21st century, its ownership changed many times but it continued to be mainly operated by Plantours. In 2012, it was renamed and acquired by the Lebanon-based Abou Merhi Group.\nThe vessel's home port was Beirut and it typically operated in the eastern Mediterranean, calling at ports in Greece and Turkey. There was accommodation for 370 guests.\n2020 Beirut explosion\n's photograph of the Beirut Port from the ISS on August 11.

On 4 August, the vessel was severely damaged by an ammonium nitrate explosion while moored at its berth.\nThe ship was left listing to starboard. Two crew, both Filipino nationals, were killed and several people injured. A crewmember, interviewed after the explosion, stated \"The ship is totally destroyed – the cabins, the saloon, everything\". The ship capsized that night after its list worsened, then partially sank. Several other ships were damaged in the same incident.\nOn 7 August, the first lawsuit related to the explosions was filed by Abou Merhi, whose offices were also destroyed.\nIn July of 2022, the ship underwent the process of being broken up on-site. As of May 2024, the process of breaking up the ship was still ongoing.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
