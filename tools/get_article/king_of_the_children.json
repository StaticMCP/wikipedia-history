[...] By Chinese standards, this is film-making brave to the point of being visionary. By any standards, this follow-up to Yellow Earth and The Big Parade is also something like a masterpiece.”\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.dianying.com/en/title/hzw1987 King of the Children] from the Chinese Movie Database"
