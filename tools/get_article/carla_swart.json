She was a professional cyclist, riding for HTC–Highroad Women in 2011.\nSwart moved to the United States in 2004 as a teenager.  She attended Lees-McRae College, where she was awarded scholarships in running and cycling.\nCareer\nCarla Swart became the first cyclist to win all four U.S. collegiate titles in one season (2008).  She placed 10th in the women's road race in the 2010 UCI Road World Championships, and had placed eighth at the Commonwealth Games in October of that year.  She signed with the HTC-Highroad cycling team shortly before her death.  Her career spanned 21 national titles in four different biking disciplines: cyclo-cross, mountain bike, road, and track.\nDeath\nSwart died whilst training in South Africa after being hit by a truck. It was claimed that she had looked over her left shoulder, as if she were in the United States, instead of her right, as would normally be the case in South Africa where vehicles drive on the left-hand side of the road.  teammate Ellen van Dijk dedicated her stage win and general classification victory at the 2011 Ladies Tour of Qatar to Swart. The prize money Van Dijk earned in Qatar was sent to her family. Lees-McRae College has a scholarship named in her honor.\nMajor results\nSource:\n;2009\n: 1st Stage 4 Tour of the Gila\n: 8th Overall Tour de PEI\n;2010\n: National Road Championships\n::3rd Time trial\n::4th Road Race\n: 8th Ronde van Drenthe\n: 8th Liberty Classic\n: 8th Commonwealth Games Road race\n: 10th Overall Trophée d'Or Féminin\n: 10th World Championship Road race\nSee also\n*2011 HTC-Highroad Women season\n*List of racing cyclists and pacemakers with a cycling-related death\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
