It is on the Bury Line and in fare zone 2.  This station was constructed and opened on 16 December 2013 to replace Woodlands Road, which had ceased operations at the end of service the previous day. This station has step-free access.\nThe stop is located below-grade, the platforms perpendicular to the Queens Road road bridge. It is connected to Queens Road Depot, the original depot for the Metrolink. It is also near to the Museum of Transport on Boyle Street, Manchester Fort retail park, and is adjacent to the Irish World Heritage Centre.\nHistory\nBeginning 6 April 1992, when the Bury Line was first opened to Metrolink, Queens Road was a staff halt and was not open to the public. Its only features were two approximately 5-metre long platforms with a shelter, stairs to each for access, and a pedestrian crossing. Flexibility may have been given in the schedule to allow for trams to stop at the halt.\nOver time, there was a need to upgrade local access. A GMITA report from May 2010 discussed the idea to close Woodlands Road stop and open replacements at Queens Road and Abraham Moss. In October 2010, Abraham Moss would begin construction, and two months later a public consultation was held on the subject of closing Woodlands Road.\nIn February 2013, after confirmation of planning permission for Queens Road, it was confirmed that Woodlands Road would close. In September 2013, works began at the site to transform Queens Road staff halt to a tram stop for passenger service. In December 2013, works were finished. Queens Road opened to passengers on 16 December 2013, and Woodlands Road had ceased operations by the beginning of service on this day.\nLayout\nQueens Road tram stop was constructed with accessibility in mind. A lift is located at the northern end of the Bury (outbound) platform, and sets of stairs. The only direct entrance to the inbound platform is via a short ramp on Smeaton Street, but it can also be reached using the pedestrian crossing at track level to the south of the platforms. There are steps down to Smeaton Street from the A6010 (road) but they are not part of the Metrolink's infrastructure.\nTwo dot matrix passenger information displays stand serving one platform each, and show estimated arrival times for trams in minutes up to 30 minutes prior (up to three at a time) and number of carriages.\nServices\nEvery route across the Manchester Metrolink network operates to a 12-minute headway (5 ) Monday–Saturday, and to a 15-minute headway (4 ) on Sundays and bank holidays. Sections served by a second \"peak only\" route (like this stop) will have a combined headway of 6 minutes during peak times.\nQueens Road is located in Zone 2, and the stop itself has two platforms which aren't named. Trams towards Piccadilly depart from the inbound platform (easternmost) and an extra service runs direct to Altrincham during peak times. Trams to Bury stop at the outbound platform (westernmost).\nTransport connections\n.]]\nBus\nQueens Road tram stop is served closest by bus route 151 (Ashton-under-Lyne–Higher Crumpsall) on Queens Road, and 156 (Manchester–Middleton) on Smedley Road.\nTrain\nThis tram stop is not connected to or near to any railway stations, but the nearest is Manchester Victoria, approximately 1.5 miles away walking.\nSee also\n* Museum of Transport, Greater Manchester\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://tfgm.com/travel-updates/live-departures/tram/queens-road-tram Queens Road tram stop - Live departures]\n*[https://tfgm.com/public-transport/tram/stops/queens-road-tram/local-map Queens Road tram stop - Area map]"
