They are not the same as modern commercial chickens, which are bred for rapid growth and efficiency. Heritage chickens are known for their ability to breed naturally, live long and healthy lives outdoors, and have a slower growth rate that allows their bodies to develop properly.\nDefinition\nThe American Poultry Association recognizes breeds established before the middle of the 20th century as heritage. While the APA's recognition provides a convenient way to identify heritage breeds, it's not an absolute requirement. Other breeds, particularly those with similar characteristics and historical roots, can also be considered heritage chickens (e.g., Fayoumi).\nSee also\n* Heritage turkey\n* Heirloom plant\n* Rare breed (agriculture)\nReferences"
