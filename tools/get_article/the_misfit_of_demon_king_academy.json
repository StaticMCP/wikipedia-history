Reincarnating 2,000 years later, Anos finds that royal demons now harshly rule over lower class hybrid demons in a society that values Anos's pureblood descendants over the demons who interbred with other species, such as humans and spirits. Finding that magic as a whole has begun to decline and his descendants are weaker as a result of the peace he created, Anos, now technically a hybrid himself, decides to reclaim his former title. However, he must first graduate from the Demon King Academy, where he is labeled a total misfit.\nCharacters\n;\n:}}\n:The reincarnated demon king who existed 2,000 years prior to the start of the series.\n;\n:\n:A girl who had met Anos on the day of Demon King Academy's entrance exam, then made friends with him.
