John J. Pershing was one such recipient of the Czechoslovak War Cross.\nIt was also awarded to the capital city of Serbia, Belgrade, on October 8, 1925.\nDesign\nThe medal was die-struck and high in detail, with a bronze finish. On the obverse of the cross was the symbols of the lands in circles – the symbol of the Bohemia above, Slovakia below, Moravia left and Silesia to the right. On the reverse the circles featured vermeil linden leaves, with the letters \"ČS\" (Československo, meaning Czechoslovakia) in the middle. The medal was suspended from a white ribbon with red stripes.\nSee also\n*Czechoslovak War Cross 1939–1945\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.vyznamenani.net/CSR/Valecny_kriz.html Czechoslovak war cross 1918]"
