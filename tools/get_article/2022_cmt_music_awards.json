The ceremony was hosted by Kelsea Ballerini (virtually), Kane Brown, and Anthony Mackie. The ceremony marked the final appearance and public performance of the country music duo, The Judds, as Naomi Judd died on April 30.\nBackground\nThe CMT Music Awards is country music's only entirely fan-voted awards show. Following the departure of the Academy of Country Music Awards from the network after 23 years, Paramount Global announced that the live televised ceremony would move from CMT to CBS. While CBS carried the award show live, CMT aired week-long special programming and events capped by an exclusive \"director's cut\" airing of the ceremony on the cable network.\nJudds Reunion\nOn April 1, CMT announced that Wynonna and Naomi Judd would reunite for a performance on the 2022 CMT Music Awards. The reunion comes ahead of the duo's Country Music Hall of Fame induction in May and Final Tour in the Fall. They performed their hit song, \"Love Can Build a Bridge,\" from the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville. The performance marked The Judds' only nationally televised award show performance in more than twenty years. The reunion performance was met with positive reception. People magazine called the performance \"stunning\", and Billboard called the reunion a \"glorious return and a welcome comeback\". This would be the final live performance for Naomi Judd and for The Judds as a duo; Naomi died on April 30, 2022, just nineteen days after their performance.\nBallerini tests positive for COVID-19\nOn the day of the live telecast, Ballerini announced that she had tested positive for COVID-19. She was asymptomatic, and said she would be able to co-host and perform from her home, with help from CMT and CBS. Kane Brown, who hosted the previous year's ceremony with Ballerini, stepped in and shared the main stage with Mackie as a co-host.\nWinners and nominees\nNominees were announced on March 16, 2022.
