      "text": "# Princes of the Ming dynasty\n\nThe princes of the Ming dynasty were titled and salaried members of the imperial bureaucracy with nominal lordship over various fiefs of Ming China. All were members of the imperial Zhu clan descended from the twenty-six sons of Zhu Yuanzhang (Hongwu Emperor). None of the princes controlled the administration of their nominal fief, unlike some tribal leaders or Confucius' descendants, the Dukes of Overflowing Sagacity, who continued to rule their territories outside of the normal provincial system.\nLike all members of the imperial family, the princes were not bound by the standard imperial administration or courts. Instead, their status, promotions, and punishments were regulated by the Imperial Clan Court in the capital, which was staffed and directed by other members of the clan.\nGeneration names\nThe Hongwu Emperor considered that the names of descendants would be duplicated. Zhu Shouqian had given generation name poems to all of his sons and grandnephews. They each have poems with twenty characters for twenty generations of male-line descendants, starting from his great-grandnephew, Zhu Shouqian. The emperor decried that his descendant's given names must use characters with Wu Xing (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal & Water). Only descendants of Zhu Shouqian's line do not need to follow this rule.\nTitle\nThe Chinese title of these lords was Wáng (}}), which was held by the \"emperors\" of the Shang and Zhou dynasties and by the \"kings\" of the Warring States. The English translation of \"prince\" is generally preferred for these Ming rulers, however, owing to their extremely limited authority.\nRoyal and noble ranks of the Ming dynasty\nSource:\nMale members\n*Crown prince, Great Imperial Son (, Huang Taizi), for eldest son and heir of an Emperor.\n**Crown prince, Great Imperial Grandson (), for the eldest son of a crown prince.\n*First-rank Prince (), for imperial son except the crown prince.\n**Hereditary Prince, Princely Son (), for the eldest son and heir apparent of a 1st rank prince.\n***Hereditary Prince, Princely Grandson (), for the eldest son of a hereditary prince.\nSome princes had passed their principalities to their great-grandson too, their heir-apparent namely called \"shizengsun\" (, Princely Great-Grandson).\n*Second-rank commandery prince (or \"Prince of XXX Commanders\"), for all other sons of a crown prince and first-rank prince except their heir apparent.\n**Commandery chief son (), for the eldest son and heir apparent of a commandery prince.\n***Commandery chief grandson (), for the eldest son of a chief son.\n*Defender general (), for all other sons of a second-rank commandery prince except his heir apparent.

If a 1st-rank prince was demoted, the imperial court would appoint one of their peerage members to presided the other members of the peerage, and namely called them as \"clan councilor\" ().\nAs the serious population growth of the imperial members during Wanli Emperor's reign, the emperor altered the salaries and restricted the succession orders for imperial members. The new succession order for a first-rank prince was: if a first-rank prince has no son to succeed his principality, a second-rank commandery prince (start from his brother and his brother's descendants, then paternal uncle, and his uncle's descendants, so on and so forth) still could succeed the principal. However, except for the successor's eldest son who would be the new heir for principality, all other younger sons of the successor could not promoted to the rank of second-rank princes even though they are sons of a first-rank prince. They could only held the title of defender general based on their father's original second-princely title designation.\nHistory\nDuring the Hongwu era at the founding of the dynasty, the emperor enfeoffed his many sons and gave them control over large garrisons of as many as 20,000 men. In the succeeding Jianwen era, an attempt by the emperor to demote or disarm his many powerful uncles (known in Chinese as }}, lit. \"The Weakening of the Marcher Lords\") prompted the Jingnan Campaign of the Prince of Yan which ended with the apparent death of the young emperor in a palace fire and Yan's ascension as the Yongle Emperor. Despite justifying his campaign as an effort to uphold the traditions of the Hongwu Emperor and to free his nephew from the ill counsel of the court advisors, the Yongle Emperor completed the work of removing the imperial clan from the militarized borders with Mongolia, Manchuria, and Annam. For example, he granted the territory of the Prince of Ning  whose capture and support had been essential for Yan's victory and with whom he had promised to divide the empire  to allied Mongols and placed the prince himself in an ungarrisoned sinecure in Nanchang.\nOver the course of the dynasty, some titles were absorbed by the crown, others abolished following unsuccessful revolution, and still others created for cadet branches of the dynasty.\nCrown Prince\nThe crown prince of the empire was known as the Taizi (lit. \"Supreme Son\"). Under the terms of the Hongwu Emperor's dynastic instructions, he was to be selected in accordance with strict Confucian agnatic primogeniture: the eldest son of the primary consort succeeded, . Although legitimizing the ascension of the Yongle Emperor involved forged claims that he had been selected by the Hongwu Emperor over his brother Crown Prince Yiwen in direct violation of the emperor's own policy, the practice was subsequently observed except in the aftermath of the Tumu Incident. This repeatedly led to teenaged and even infant princes ascending to the throne and contributed to the domination of the government by powerful eunuch dictators.\nCrown princes who failed to ascend to the imperial throne were given posthumous names including their title of taizi. They include:\n* Crown Prince Yiwen, the Hongwu Emperor's eldest son Zhu Biao\n* Crown Prince Hejian, the Jianwen Emperor's eldest son Zhu Wenkui\n* Crown Prince Huaixian, the Jingtai Emperor's eldest son\n* Crown Prince Daogong, the Chenghua Emperor's eldest son\n* Crown Prince Aichong, the Jiajing Emperor's eldest son\n* Crown Prince Zhuangjin, the Jiajing Emperor's 2nd son\n* Crown Prince Huaichong, the Tianqi Emperor's eldest son\n* Crown Prince Daohuai, the Tianqi Emperor's 2nd son\n* Crown Prince Xianchong, the Tianqi Emperor's 3rd son\n* Crown Prince Xianmin, the Chongzhen Emperor's eldest son\nLesser princes\nSalaries for princes and other imperial family members\nIn 1370, the Hongwu Emperor created ten princely peerages: Qin, Jin, Yan, Zhou, Chu, Qi, Tan, Lu (鲁) and Jingjiang. Salaries for princes and princesses were set in 1376:\n*For a first-rank prince:\n**50 thousands dan of rice for a year\n**25 thousands of banknotes for a year\n**40 pairs of brocades for a year\n**300 pairs of reels for a year\n**each 100 pairs of \"sha\" and \"luo\" for a year\n**500 pairs of silk for a year\n**each 1000 of grass cloth and winter cloth for a year\n**2000 tael of cotton for a year\n**2000 \"yin\" of salt for a year\n**1000 catties of tea for a year\n**50 pairs of horses forage for a month\n**Satin for a year for self-made by own carpenters\n*For Prince of Jingjiang:\n**20 thousands dan of rice for a year\n**10 thousands of banknotes for a year\n**20 pairs of horses forage for a month\nThe other supplies for Prince of Jingjiang were half amount of a first-rank prince.\n*For unmarried imperial daughter and without title of a princess:\n**each 10 pairs of reels, \"sha\" and \"luo\" for a year\n**each 30 pairs silk, grass cloth and winter cloth\n**200 taels of cotton for a year\n*For married imperial daughter with the title of a princess:\n**granted a farmland\n**1500 dan of rice for a year\n**2000 of banknotes for a year\nSupplies for son of a first-rank prince without any titles and peerages were same as non-title imperial daughter, while for non-title first-rank princely daughter were half amount of non-title 1st-rank princely son.\nSee also\n* History of the Ming dynasty\n* List of vassal prince peerages of the Ming dynasty\n* Chinese nobility\n* Kings of the Han dynasty\nReferences"
