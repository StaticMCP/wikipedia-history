He is the lead vocalist, guitarist and keyboardist of the darkwave duo She Wants Revenge, which formed in 2004.\nIn 1993, he released a hip-hop album titled My Field Trip to Planet 9, which featured production from Prince Paul and QDIII. His latest hip hop album, the self-released Black Hesh Cult Mixtape, was released in July 2013.\nWarfield was the featured vocalist on Bomb the Bass' song \"Bug Powder Dust\", which reached No. 24 on the UK Singles Chart in 1994.\nIn 2025, he announced a new project under the artist name Warfield, which will release its debut EP on Cleopatra Records.\nCareer\nJustin Warfield is musically versatile, having been involved in several different genres over the years, and seems to choose his projects based on personal interest rather than career concerns. For example, his debut album was hip hop, but his next major musical project was a psychedelic rock band that released one album, The Justin Warfield Supernaut. In 1991, he had a hit single with the song \"Season of the Vic,\" which reached No. 18 on the Billboard Hot Rap Singles chart.\nHe was a member of the group One Inch Punch, which released its only LP, Tao of the One Inch Punch, on Hut Records in 1996. Warfield is one half of the darkwave duo She Wants Revenge, a project different again from any of his previous incarnations. It is a heavily electronic group that is influenced by bands such as Joy Division, New Order, Bauhaus, and Depeche Mode to more contemporary groups such as Interpol, and the Faint, cultivating a stylized visual identity in a contemporary analogue to Depeche Mode and the Cure.\nHis most commercially recognizable track is probably \"Bug Powder Dust,\" in which he was the vocalist on a Bomb the Bass release, and he was also featured on another track on its album, Clear. He also appeared as a guest vocalist on the Placebo song \"Spite & Malice\" from the album Black Market Music, the Cornershop song \"Candyman\" from the album When I Was Born for the 7th Time, the Crystal Method song \"Kling to the Wreckage\" on the album, Divided by Night, the Chemical Brothers' \"Not Another Drugstore\" from the single \"Elektrobank\", and the Freestylers's \"Broadcast Channels\" from the album, Pressure Point. Additionally, he has done remix work including a remix of \"Joel\" by the Boo Radleys from its 1995 single \"It's Lulu\", a remix of \"Confide In Me\" by Kylie Minogue in 1994 and \"Butterfly\" by Crazy Town.\nWarfield was on several episodes of Saved By The Bell.\nPersonal life\nWarfield is of African-American and Jewish Russian-Romanian maternal parentage.\nHe is married to Stefanie King and they have one son.\nDiscography\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\nSolo studio albums\n!Album title\n!Album details\n|-\n|My Field Trip to Planet 9\n|\n* Released: July 13, 1993\n* Label: Qwest/Reprise/Warner Bros.\n* Format: CD\n|-\n|Black Hesh Cult Mixtape\n|\n* Released: August 8, 2013\n* Label: Self-Released\n* Format: CD/download\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+The Justin Warfield Supernaut\n!Album title\n!Album details\n|-\n|The Justin Warfield Supernaut\n|\n* Released: June 28, 1995\n* Label: Qwest/Reprise/Warner Bros.\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of studio albums as part of She Wants Revenge, with selected chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"5\"| Peak chart positions\n|-\n!style=\"width:3em;font-size:75%;\"| US\n!style=\"width:3em;font-size:75%;\"| USAlt\n!style=\"width:3em;font-size:75%;\"| USDance\n!style=\"width:3em;font-size:75%;\"| USIndie\n!style=\"width:3em;font-size:75%;\"| USRock\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | She Wants Revenge\n|\n* Released: January 31, 2006\n* Label: Perfect Kiss/Geffen/Universal\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|38\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|—\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|—\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|9\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | This Is Forever\n|\n* Released: October 9, 2007\n* Label: Perfect Kiss/Geffen/Universal\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|58\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|14\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|—\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|—\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Valleyheart\n|\n* Released: May 24, 2011\n* Label: Five Seven Music\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|153\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|19\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|—\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|23\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|37\n|-\n| colspan=\"10\" style=\"font-size:90%\" | \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071002104736/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/newfaces/story/9363414/she_wants_revenge_blow_up?rnd=1140811290846&has-player=true&version=6.0.7.811 Christian Hoard for Rolling Stone Online]\n*[https://archive.today/20130209184000/http://music.yahoo.com/ar-268184-bio--Justin-Warfield Bradley Torreano at Yahoo!
