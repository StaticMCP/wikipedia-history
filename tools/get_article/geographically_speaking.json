The show consisted of hostess Zetta Wells narrating her home movies of her trips with her husband Carveth Wells to unusual and exotic places. When she ran out of home movies, the series ended in December 1946. The sponsor retained the time slot, replacing the show with Bristol-Myers Tele-Varieties.\nEpisode status\nNo episode of the series is known to survive in any archive, as it was broadcast live and there was no way to record live TV until the development of kinescopes in 1947. Even then, only a few TV shows were recorded.\nSee also\n*1946-47 United States network television schedule\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
