The event was established in 2013 and has Polish oil company PKN Orlen as its title sponsor. It was the second annual marathon race for the city, following on from the success of the Warsaw Marathon, which has been held in the city, generally in September, since 1979.\nBy its fourth edition, the event received IAAF Silver Label status and featured in excess of 8000 entrants into the marathon race. That year's race also saw the first Polish winner in the form of men's champion Artur Kozłowski.\nThe course records of 2:06:55 hours, set by Tadese Tola in 2014, and 2:26:25 hours, set by Fatuma Sado in 2015, are all-comers records – the fastest ever recorded in Poland for the marathon distance.\nThe marathon was not held in 2020.\nWinners\nKey:\n:  Course record\n:  National championship race\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Ed.\n!
