      "text": "# Louis, King of Cyprus\n\nLouis of Savoy (; 1436–37; April 1482) was King of Cyprus from 1459 to 1464 as the husband and co-ruler of Queen Charlotte. He was also Count of Geneva from 1460 to 1482. He was the second son of Louis, Duke of Savoy, and his wife, Anne of Lusignan, daughter of King Janus of Cyprus.\nLife\nLouis was born, according to Samuel Guichenon, in June 1431, in Geneva, but the historian specifies in note that he was born in 1436. The birth in June 1436 is therefore that adopted by contemporary authors. Guichenon also specifies that the prince is 8 years old when he married in 1444. Some mention a period between 1436 and 1437, especially for this last year the Swiss historian Édouard Mallet (1805–1856).\nOn 14 December 1444, at Stirling Castle, he was married to Annabella, youngest daughter of King James I of Scotland (d. 1437) and sister of King James II of Scotland.}} The official wedding never took place and the marriage was annulled in 1458.\nOn 7 October 1458, his cousin Charlotte became Queen of Cyprus. He married her on 7 October 1459 and became King of Cyprus as well as the titular King of Jerusalem and of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. Their reign ended when they were deposed.\nLouis died in April 1482, at the priory of Ripaille.\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
