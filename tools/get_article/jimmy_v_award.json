The award is named in honor of North Carolina State University men's basketball coach Jim Valvano, who gave an acceptance speech after receiving the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the 1993 ESPY Awards ceremony which \"brought a howling, teary-eyed Madison Square Garden to its feet\". Valvano died from adenocarcinoma two months after receiving the award. The Jimmy V Award trophy, designed by sculptor Lawrence Nowlan, is presented at the annual awards ceremony in Los Angeles by The V Foundation, a charitable organization founded in 1993 by ESPN and Valvano to raise money to fund cancer research grants across the United States.\nThe accolade's inaugural winner in 2007 was basketball coach Kay Yow, who successfully led the North Carolina State University women's team to the ACC tournament championship game, and the Sweet 16 (regional semi-finals) of the NCAA Division I Tournament after returning from sessions of breast cancer chemotherapy. Although the award has usually been given to coaches or athletes, it has been presented to two reporters: Stuart Scott (2014) and Craig Sager (2016). The award has been shared twice: Team Hoyt (2013), consisting of the father and son team of Dick and Rick Hoyt, and the father and daughter combination of Devon Still and Leah Still (2015). The 2024 recipient of the Jimmy V Award was Katie Schumacher-Cawley.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Jimmy V Award winners\n|-\n! scope=col | Year\n! scope=col class=unsortable | Image\n! scope=col | Recipient(s)\n! scope=col class=unsortable | Notes\n! scope=col class=unsortable |\n|-\n| 2007\n| –\n! scope=row |\n| align=left | Returned to successfully coach the North Carolina State University women's team to the ACC tournament championship game, and the Sweet 16 (regional semi-finals) of the NCAA Division I Tournament after sessions of breast cancer chemotherapy.\n|\n|-\n| 2008\n|\n! scope=row |\n| align=left | Former Buffalo Bills tight end who was paralysed from the neck down due to a spinal cord injury he sustained at the start of the 2007 NFL season but began walking again after rehabilitation.\n|\n|-\n| 2009\n| –\n! scope=row |\n| align=left | Meyer had his left leg amputated below the knee after a vehicular accident in September 2008.
