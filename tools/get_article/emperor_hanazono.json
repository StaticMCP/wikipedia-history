His reign spanned the years from 1308 through 1318.\nGenealogy\nBefore his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (his imina) was Tomihito-shinnō (富仁親王).\nHe was the fourth son of the 92nd Emperor, Fushimi.  He belonged to the Jimyōin-tō branch of the Imperial Family.\n*Consort: Ogimachi Michiko (正親町実子) later Senkomon'in (宣光門院, 1297–1360), Ogimachi Saneakira's daughter\n** First Daughter: Imperial Princess Hisako (1318–1358; 寿子内親王) later Kianmon-in (徽安門院), married Emperor Kogon\n** Second Son: Imperial Prince Nobunaga (業永親王; 1327–1353) later Imperial Prince priest Genshi (源性入道親王)\n** Third son: Imperial Prince Naohito (直仁親王; 1335–1398)\n** Daughter: Imperial Princess Noriko (儀子内親王; d. 1348)\n** Priest Shōgoin\n** Daughter married to Kazan'in clan\n*Consort: Ichijo-no-Tsubone (d. 1325), Ogimachi Saneakira's daughter\n** First Son: Imperial Prince Priest Kakuyo (1320–1382; 覚誉法親王)\n*Lady-in-waiting: Wamuro Yoriko (葉室頼子), Wamuro Yorito's daughter\n** Fifth Daughter: Imperial Princess Noriko (祝子内親王) – Nun\n** Princess\nEvents of Hanazono's life\nTomihito-shinnō became emperor upon the death of his second cousin, the Daikakuji-tō Emperor Go-Nijō.\n* Tokuji 3, in the 8th month (1308): In the 8th year of Go-Nijo-tennō reign (後二条天皇八年), the emperor died at the young age of 24; and the succession (senso) was received by his cousin.  Shortly thereafter, Emperor Hanazono is said to have acceded to the throne (sokui).\n* Tokuji 3, in the 10th month (1308): The nengō was changed to Enkyō to mark the accession of Emperor Hanazono.\nHanazono's father, the retired-Emperor Fushimi, and Hanazono's brother, the retired-Emperor Go-Fushimi, both exerted influence as cloistered emperors during this reign.\nIn these years, negotiations between the Kamakura Bakufu and the two imperial lines resulted in an agreement to alternate the throne between the two lines every 10 years (the Bumpō Agreement).  This agreement was not long-lasting.  The negotiated provisions would soon be broken by Hanazono's successor.\nIn 1318, he abdicated to his second cousin, the Daikakuji-tō Emperor Go-Daigo, who was Nijō's brother.\nAfter his abdication, he raised his nephew, the future Northern Pretender Emperor Kōgon.\nIn 1335, he became a Buddhist monk of the Zen sect, and under his sponsorship, his palace became the temple of Myōshin-ji, now the largest network in Rinzai Buddhism. Many places and institutions in the area are named for him, including Hanazono University (the Rinzai university) and Hanazono Station.\nHe died in 1348.  Hanazono's imperial tomb is known as Jurakuin no ue no misasagi; it is located in Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto.\nHe excelled at waka composition, and was an important member of the Kyōgoku School.  He also left behind a diary, called Hanazono-in-Minki (Imperial Chronicles of the Flower Garden Temple or Hanazono-in) (花園院宸記).  He was a very religious and literate person, never missing his prayers to the Amitabha Buddha.\nKugyō\nis a collective term for the very few most powerful noble men attached to the imperial court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court's actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.\nIn general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.  These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.  During Hanazono's reign, this apex of the Daijō-kan included:\n* Sesshō, Kujō Moronori, 1308\n* Sesshō, Takatsukasa Fuyuhira, 1308–1311\n* Kampaku, Takatsukasa Fuyuhira, 1311–1313\n* Kampaku, Konoe Iehira, 1313–1315\n* Kampaku, Takatsukasa Fuyuhira, 1315–1316\n* Kampaku, Nijō Michihira, 1316–1318\n* Sadaijin\n* Udaijin\n* Nadaijin\n* Dainagon\nEras of Hanazono's reign\nThe years of Hanazono's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or nengō.\n* Tokuji               (1306–1308)\n* Enkyō                (1308–1311)\n* Ōchō            (1311–1312)\n* Shōwa  (1312–1317)\n* Bumpō                (1317–1319)\nSee also\n* Emperor of Japan\n* List of Emperors of Japan\n* Imperial cult\n* Emperor Go-Hanazono\nNotes\n– a stylized chrysanthemum blossom]]\nReferences\n* Ponsonby-Fane, Richard Arthur Brabazon.
