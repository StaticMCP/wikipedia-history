It usually provides for scheduling tasks, such as turning sprinklers on at the appropriate time, and event handling, such as turning lights on when motion is detected. Typically the application will support multiple interfaces to the outside world, such as XMPP, email, Z-Wave, and X10.\nThe user interface of home automation software is often based on a client-server model, such as a web UI or a smartphone app, or some combination thereof. More advanced applications will allow users to write scripts in a programming language to handle more complex tasks. There are currently many competing home automation standards for both hardware and software.\nOpen-source software\nThis is a list of software across multiple platforms which is designed to perform home automation.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!style=\"background-color:#cfcfcf;\" align=\"center\" |Name!!Linux!!Mac!!Windows!!Android!!iOS!!License!!class=\"unsortable\"|Technologies\n|-\n|AllJoyn (by AllSeen Alliance)||||||||||||Apache 2.0 License||\n|-\n|Home Assistant||||||||Control App||Control App||Apache 2.0 License||As of April 2025, 3100 add-ons were officially listed as available for integration  Popular examples include; Alexa, Bluetooth, ecobee, IFTTT, Google Cast (Chromecast and Google Home/Nest), Google Assistant, HomeKit, IKEA Home Smart, KNX, Kodi (XBMC), Lutron, Matter, MQTT, Philips Hue, Plex, Samsung/SmartThings, Shelly, Sonos, SwitchBot, Tuya, Xiaomi Smart Home (Mi Home), Zigbee, Z-Wave\n|-\n|IoTivity (by Open Connectivity Foundation)||||||||||||Apache 2.0 License||\n|-\n|LinuxMCE|||| ||Control App||Control App||Control App||GPL||Asterisk, Bluetooth, KNX, 1-Wire, Serial, Wake on LAN (WoL), Z-Wave, X10, Infrared, GlobalCache, MythTV, Video Disc Recorder (VDR), Hulu, HDHomeRun\n|-\n|openHAB||||||||||||Eclipse Public License||As of April 2025, 474 add-ons were available for integration.
