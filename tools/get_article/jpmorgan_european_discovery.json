After Robert Fleming & Co. was acquired by Chase Manhattan in April 2000, and Chase Manhattan merged with J.P. Morgan & Co. in December 2000, it was brought under the management of J.P. Morgan & Co. It changed its name to the JPMorgan Fleming European Fledgeling Investment Trust in 2002 and then, following JPMorgan's decision to drop the Fleming brand, it became the JPMorgan European Fledgeling Investment Trust in 2006. It went on to become the JPMorgan European Smaller Companies Trust in 2010, and adopted its current name on 15 June 2021.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.jpmorganinvestmenttrusts.co.uk  Official site]"
