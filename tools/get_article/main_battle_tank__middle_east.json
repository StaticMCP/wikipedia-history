Players can play in scenarios from different time periods for various conflicts between local powers in the desert terrain of the Middle East. Players can choose to challenge each other or the computer, and order their units into combat where they make tactical decisions as the battles occur. The game comes with several different scenarios, and includes a scenario editor.\nPublication history\nMiddle East is a follow-up to Main Battle Tank: Central Germany.\nReception\nJoe Sherfy reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \"MBTME and its sister programs by SimCan are unique. They are not recommended for those looking solely for 'awesome graphics.' Instead, despite some shortcomings, they are recommended to those fans of traditional board wargames who remember how much fun they had playing Panzerblitz or Panzerleader. The Main Battle Tank series, because of its use of limited intelligence and 'post mortem' features, is the next step.\"\nThe PC Games Bible identifies how \"Sim Can products are very specialist, effectively a computer moderated board game, no graphics, text driven, and complex. They show the most amazing depth and realism, but will be considered far too dry and boring, by anything other than a real committed strategist.\"\nReferences"
