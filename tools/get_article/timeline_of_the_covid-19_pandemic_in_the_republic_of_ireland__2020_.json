Ireland subsequently entered the Containment Phase.\n**Authorities shut a secondary school linked to the case as a precautionary measure. The State did not name the school involved, but—shortly afterwards—the Irish Examiner's Political Editor, Daniel McConnell, tweeted a copy of the letter it had sent to parents informing them it would close.\nMarch 2020\n* 3 March – A second case was confirmed of a female in the east of the country who had been to Northern Italy. She had no contact with the first case.\n* 4 March – Four more cases were confirmed, two females and two males in the west of the country who travelled from Northern Italy, bringing the total to six.\n* 5 March – Seven more cases were confirmed, bringing the total to 13. Four of the cases were related to travel from Northern Italy—four males from the east of the country—one of these four cases was connected to Trinity College Dublin. Two of the seven cases were associated with close contact with a confirmed case—two females in the west of the country. One of the seven cases was a male in the south of the country who had no history of travel abroad.\n* 6 March\n**It was reported that more than 60 staff at Cork University Hospital would have to self-isolate following a case of community transmission of COVID-19 at the hospital.\n**The same day brought confirmation of five more cases, bringing the total in the country at that time to 18.\n* 11 March\n**An elderly patient in Naas General Hospital in County Kildare (south-west of the country's capital city, Dublin) became Ireland's first fatality from the virus; nine new cases were announced. This brought confirmed cases to 43.\n**Cork University Hospital discharged a patient who had been admitted for coronavirus disease after they made a full recovery.\n* 12 March\n**27 new cases were confirmed, bringing the total cases in the country to 70.\n**In response to the increase of cases, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced the closure of all schools, colleges and childcare facilities until 29 March. The announcement, which came one day after the World Health Organization formally declared that the outbreak was pandemic, also marked Ireland's movement from the Containment Phase in its strategy to combat the spread of the virus (a strategy which the Department of the Taoiseach had reaffirmed just three days earlier) towards the Delay Phase.\n* 13 March – Following the introduction of restrictions on social gatherings, RTÉ One aired the first edition of The Late Late Show to go ahead without a studio audience.\n* 14 March – 39 new cases were confirmed and another death announced of a man in the East of the country with underlying medical conditions. This brought the total cases to 129, with 2 deaths in total.\n* 15 March\n**40 new cases were confirmed. The total number of cases stood at 169 with 2 deaths.\n**The Government of Ireland ordered bars and public houses to close and advised against house parties.\n* 18 March\n**74 new cases were confirmed, bringing total cases in the country to 366 with 2 deaths.\n**More detailed information about hospital statistics, age range affected, how COVID-19 was spreading, healthcare workers and cases by county was published by the National Public Health Emergency Team starting on this day. It showed that the virus was present in 23 of the 26 counties, with Laois, Leitrim and Monaghan the only three yet to record a case.\n* 19 March – 191 new cases were confirmed, bringing total to 557. 1 new death was recorded, bringing the total to 3 deaths. The woman died in an isolation ward in St Vincent's Hospital. Her daughter later spoke to the media and urged the public to protect themselves from the virus.\n* 20 March – 126 new cases were reported, bringing the total to 683. It was also confirmed that the virus had since infected Laois and Leitrim, leaving Monaghan as the last of the 26 counties.\n* 22 March – 121 new cases were announced, bringing the total to 906. A fourth death was also announced, bringing the total number of deaths to 4. The man, who died at the Mater Hospital, was musical director of a choir in Dublin and former Head of Vocal Studies at the Royal Irish Academy of Music.\n* 23 March – A further 219 cases and 2 more deaths were announced, bringing the totals to 1,125 cases and 6 deaths. Of those then diagnosed, 208 were health care workers.\n* 26 March\n**255 cases and 10 deaths were confirmed, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 1,819, and the total number of deaths to 19, more than double the previous day's total.\n**According to Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan, most of the deaths occurred in \"institutional settings\", i.e. hospitals and nursing homes. At this point, deaths began to accelerate rapidly.\n* 27 March\n**302 new cases as well as 3 new deaths brought the total number of confirmed cases and deaths to 2,121 and 22, respectively. Among the deaths was the country's first healthcare fatality, who was based in the east.\n**Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced a national stay-at-home order with a series of measures which he summed up as: \"Stay at Home\" (subject to certain exemptions).\n**Merrion Street described it as \"a more intensive phase in our response to COVID-19\". The measures, which coincided with an escalating death toll, were also a response to increased reliance on intensive care units (ICUs) to treat critically ill patients, and an attempt to lower this number before capacity was reached.\n* 31 March – 325 cases and 17 deaths were reported, bringing the total number of confirmed cases and deaths to 3,235 and 71, respectively.\nApril 2020\n* 1 April\n**An additional 212 cases and 14 deaths were reported, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 3,447, and the total number of deaths to 85.\n**It was also announced that Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan, who displayed signs of illness during the previous evening's news conference, had entered hospital for non-COVID reasons; Ronan Glynn (Deputy Chief Medical Officer and Head of the Department of Health's Health Protection Unit) took charge.\n* 2 April\n**A further 402 cases and 13 deaths were announced, bringing the totals to 3,849 cases and 98 deaths.\n**Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan said of the intensive care unit (ICU) figures: \"Of 148 cases admitted to ICU, 25 of those cases have been discharged, sadly there have been 14 deaths from ICU and 109 remain in ICU.
