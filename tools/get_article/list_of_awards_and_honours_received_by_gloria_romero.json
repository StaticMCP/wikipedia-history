The National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) in 2005, the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB) in 2009 and the Film Development Council of the Philippines (FDCP) in 2024, awarded her the Lifetime Achievement Award, as well as Luna Awards in 2002, FAMAS, Gawad Urian (both in 2004), and Star Awards for Television in 2012. Romero was posthumously conferred the Presidential Medal of Merit in 2025.\nRomero rose to prominence as a romantic lead during the first golden age of Philippine cinema and became the biggest box-office draw of the period. For her portrayal of the title character the romantic comedy Dalagang Ilocana (1954), she earned her first FAMAS Award for Best Actress. She next appeared in FAMAS-nominated performances in Alaalang Banal (1958), Ikaw ang Aking Buhay (1959), and Iginuhit ng Tadhana (1965). She took on conventional roles in 1970s but only began receiving critical success again in mid-1980s. For her role in Eddie Garcia's romantic drama Saan Nagtatago Ang Pag-ibig? (1986), she earned a Luna Award for Best Supporting Actress. She next appeared in Ishmael Bernal's Nagbabagang Luha (1987), for which she won a FAMAS Award for Best Supporting Actress. During this period, she began appearing in television productions and won a Star Award for Best Comedy Actress for her performance in the sitcom Palibhasa Lalake (1987).\nRomero received newfound attention and success in the 2000s. For her portrayal of an Alzheimer's disease-stricken matriarch in the family drama Tanging Yaman (2000), she won almost all major Philippine award-giving bodies. She received a Gawad Urian for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as an aged woman in the coming-of-age Magnifico (2003). She then starred in the comedy drama Fuchsia (2008), where she earned a Golden Screen Award for Best Actress and was awarded a Star Award for Movie Supporting Actress of the Year for her role in the gay-themed drama Tarima (2010). For her final film role where she portrayed a devoted wife in ''Rainbow's Sunset (2018), she received a Metro Manila Film Festival Award for Best Actress.\nState honors\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:99%;\"\n|+\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:19%;\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6%;\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:32%;\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8%;\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4%;\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"rowgroup\" |Film Development Council of the Philippines\n|2021\n|Ilaw ng Industriya Award\n|\n|\n|-\n|2024\n|Lifetime Achievement Award\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"rowgroup\" |National Commission for Culture and the Arts\n|2005\n|PAMA-AS Gintong Bai Award\n|\n|\n|-\n|2010\n|Gawad Parangal sa Ginintuang Bituin\n|\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"rowgroup\"|Republic of the Philippines\n|2025\n|Presidential Medal of Merit\n|\n|\n|}\nMajor associations\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:99%;\"\n|+\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:19%;\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6%;\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:32%;\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:28%;\" | Nominated work\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8%;\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4%;\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\" scope=\"rowgroup\" |Box Office Entertainment Awards\n|2001\n| rowspan=\"2\" |All-Time Favorite Actress\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Gloria Romero\n|\n|\n|-\n|2003\n|\n|\n|-\n|2019\n|Golden Jury Award for All Time Favorite Actress\n|\n|\n|-\n|2025\n|Posthumous Award as Entertainment Icons\n|\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"rowgroup\" rowspan=\"2\" |Catholic Mass Media Awards\n|1988\n|Best Supporting Actress\n|Saan Nagtatago ang Pag-ibig?\n|\n|\n|-\n|2020\n|Best Children and Youth Program\n|Daig Kayo ng Lola Ko\n|\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"rowgroup\"|Cinemanila International Film Festival\n|2001\n|Lifetime Achievement Award\n|Gloria Romero\n|\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"rowgroup\"|Eastwood City Walk of Fame\n|2005\n|Inductee\n|Gloria Romero\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"13\" scope=\"rowgroup\" |FAMAS Awards\n|1955\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Best Actress\n|Dalagang Ilocana\n|\n|\n|-\n|1959\n|Alaalang Banal\n|\n|\n|-\n|1960\n|Ikaw Ang Aking Buhay\n|\n|\n|-\n|1966\n|Iginuhit ng Tadhana: The Ferdinand E.
