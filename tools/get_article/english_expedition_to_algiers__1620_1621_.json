An \"opponent of Islam\", he damaged relations with the Regency of Algiers by issuing privateering licenses to his subjects, enabling them to attack ships of the Barbary states. Although the English government had recalled privateering licenses in 1595 due to English privateers committing infractions and being prosecuted and sentenced in admiralty courts, they still had \"a freer command over the Mediterranean, where Turkish and Algerian ships were seen as rightful prizes.\" In 1620, an English fleet under the command of Robert Mansell, supported by Richard Hawkins and Thomas Button, was sent to Algiers to put an end to the grips of the Barbary pirates on the trade route passing through the Strait of Gibraltar. After obtaining the release of 40 captives, following negotiations, in November 1620, Mansell took part in a second expedition in 1621.\nExpedition\nOn 27 November in the year 1620, Mansell arrived at Algiers with 20 ships and formally demanded that the Dey of Algiers surrender all of the English subjects and vessels they had. He also demanded the execution or capture of all of the pirates who had captured them. The Algerians pretended to show eagerness to comply with his demands and released some four-and-twenty captives. Mansell was aware that this was a small amount since the Algerians had captured 150 English vessels in the past six years, however he was not prepared to fight and sailed away.\nOn 21 May, he returned to Algiers and three days later launched his attack. The English launched several fire ships against the pirate ships, with flames being seen shooting up in no less than seven places amongst their rigging. The English were low on ammunition and the Algerians took advantage of this, eventually driving off Mansell's fleet.\nAftermath\nThe expedition prompted a violent response by the Algerian pirates: they not only raided merchant ships in the Mediterranean, but extended their piracy to the British mainland  along the English Channel. Years of privateering did England more damage than Algiers. James I furthered a treaty through the Sublime Porte, where he negotiated directly in Constantinople in 1622 with the Pasha of Algiers, who happened to be visiting there.\nEnglish ships\n{| class=\"wikitable\"width=\n|-\n!style=|Ship\n!style=|Guns\n!style=|Commander\n!style=|Notes\n!style=|Ref.\n|-\n|Lion\n|40\n|Admiral Sir Robert Mansell\n|\n|rowspan=3|\n|-\n|Vanguard\n|40\n|Vice-Admiral Sir Richard Hawkins\n|\n|-\n|Rainbow\n|40\n|Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Button\n|\n|-\n|Constant Reformation\n|40\n|Captain Arthur Manwaring\n|\n|\n|-\n|Antelope\n|34\n|Captain Sir Henry Palmer\n|\n|\n|-\n|Convertine\n|36\n|Captain Thomas Love\n|\n|\n|-\n|Mercury\n|20\n|\n|rowspan=2|Joined 26 February 1621\n|rowspan=2|\n|-\n|Spy\n|18\n|\n|-\n|Golden Phoenix\n|24\n|\n|rowspan=12|Hired merchant ship\n|rowspan=12|\n|-\n|Samuel\n|22\n|\n|-\n|Marygold\n|21\n|\n|-\n|Zouche Phoenix\n|26\n|\n|-\n|Barbary\n|18\n|\n|-\n|Centurion\n|22\n|\n|-\n|Primrose\n|18\n|\n|-\n|Hercules\n|24\n|\n|-\n|Neptune\n|21\n|\n|-\n|Bonaventure\n|23\n|-\n|Restore\n|12\n|\n|-\n|Marmaduke\n|12\n|\n|}\nCitations\nReferences\n*"
