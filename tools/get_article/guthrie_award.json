It is named after the artist James Guthrie.\nFoundation of award\nThe award was founded in 1920. It was to commemorate the presidency of the Royal Scottish Academy by James Guthrie.  It is awarded for the most outstanding work adjudged in the Royal Scottish Academy exhibition of the year to artists under the age of 35 (although the joint winner of the first award David Macbeth Sutherland was around 37 in 1920).\nScottish-based\nIt is usual for the award to go to a painting and its artist, but occasionally sculptures and sculptors have also won. In 2021 the award was won by the artist and film-maker Emily Beaney for an experimental documentary. The award is open to any nationality, but the exhibition participants must be based and active in Scotland. The 1994 winner Joe Fan was originally from Hong Kong; the 2008 winner Trine Pedersen was originally from Denmark; the 2023 winner Daniel Nelis is originally from Ireland.\nMembers and non-members of the RSA\nThe under 35 age requirement and the sheer number of exhibits - now around 600 annually - mean that the Guthrie Award is difficult to win more than once; however this has been done: by Heather Ross in 2006 and 2007; and by Julie-Ann Simpson in 2014 and 2019. Non-members of the RSA can apply to be in the Open exhibition, although around only a couple of hundred non-member exhibits make it through annually from the thousands of applications received, as around 400 exhibits are reserved for members.\nPrize monies and medals\nUsually the award is awarded singularly, but on occasion the award has gone to joint winners. The award, originally made by an anonymous donor but in 1930 revealed to be the late (17th) Earl of Moray, who gave a monetary value on the capital endowment of £1000 as well as the honour of the award. Nowadays a medal is also presented. In its early years, the monetary award  was £50. Today the award monies stand at £750. If the award is shared, the prize monies are also shared.\nList of Guthrie Award winners\nThe List of Guthrie Award winners is a list of artists who have won the award.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Year\n!
