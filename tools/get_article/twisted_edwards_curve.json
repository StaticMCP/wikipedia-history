The curve set is named after mathematician Harold M. Edwards. Elliptic curves are important in public key cryptography and twisted Edwards curves are at the heart of an electronic signature scheme called EdDSA that offers high performance while avoiding security problems that have surfaced in other digital signature schemes.\nDefinition\nA twisted Edwards curve E_{E,a,d} over a field \\mathbb{K} with characteristic not equal to 2 (that is, no element is its own additive inverse) is an affine plane curve defined by the equation:\n: E_{E,a,d}: a x^2+y^2= 1+dx^2y^2\nwhere a, d are distinct non-zero elements of \\mathbb{K}.\nEach twisted Edwards curve is a twist of an Edwards curve. The special case a = 1 is untwisted, because the curve reduces to an ordinary Edwards curve.\nEvery twisted Edwards curve is birationally equivalent to an elliptic curve in Montgomery form and vice versa.\nGroup law\nAs for all elliptic curves, also for the twisted Edwards curve, it is possible to do some operations between its points, such as adding two of them or doubling (or tripling) one. The results of these operations are always points that belong to the curve itself. In the following sections some formulas are given to obtain the coordinates of a point resulted from an addition between two other points (addition), or the coordinates of point resulted from a doubling of a single point on a curve.\nAddition on twisted Edwards curves\nLet \\mathbb{K} be a field with characteristic different from 2.\nLet (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) be points on the twisted Edwards curve. The  equation of twisted Edwards curve is written as;\n: E_{E, a, d}: ax^2+y^2=1+dx^2y^2.\nThe sum of these points (x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2) on E_{E, a, d} is:\n: (x_1,y_1) + (x_2,y_2) = \\left(\\frac{x_1y_2+y_1x_2}{1+dx_1x_2y_1y_2} , \\frac{y_1y_2-ax_1x_2}{1-dx_1x_2y_1y_2}\\right)\nThe neutral element is (0,1) and the negative of (x_1,y_1) is (-x_1,y_1)\nThese formulas also work for doubling. If a is a square in \\mathbb{K} and d is a non-square in \\mathbb{K}, these formulas are complete: this means that they can be used for all pairs of points without exceptions; so they work for doubling as well, and neutral elements and negatives are accepted as inputs.\nExample of addition\nGiven the following twisted Edwards curve with a = 3 and d = 2:\n; 3x^2 + y^2 = 1 + 2x^2y^2\nit is possible to add the points P_1=(1,\\sqrt{2}) and P_2=(1,-\\sqrt{2}) using the formula given above. The result is a point P3 that has coordinates:\n: x_3 = \\frac{x_1y_2+y_1x_2}{1+dx_1x_2y_1y_2} = 0,\n: y_3 = \\frac{y_1y_2-ax_1x_2}{1-dx_1x_2y_1y_2} = -1.\nDoubling on twisted Edwards curves\nDoubling can be performed with exactly the same formula as addition.\nDoubling of a point (x_1,y_1) on the curve E_{E, a, d} is:\n2(x_1,y_1) = (x_3,y_3)\nwhere\n:\n\\begin{align}\nx_3 & = \\frac{x_1y_1+y_1x_1}{1+dx_1x_1y_1y_1}=\\frac{2x_1y_1}{ax_1^2+y_1^2} \\\\[6pt]\ny_3 & = \\frac{y_1y_1-ax_1x_1}{1-dx_1x_1y_1y_1}=\\frac{y_1^2-ax_1^2}{2-ax_1^2-y_1^2}.\n\\end{align}\nDenominators in doubling are simplified using the curve equation dx^2y^2 = ax^2 + by^2 - 1. This reduces the power from 4 to 2 and allows for more efficient computation.\nExample of doubling\nConsidering the same twisted Edwards curve given in the previous example, with a=3 and d=2, it is possible to double the point P_1=(1,\\sqrt{2}). The point 2P1 obtained using the formula above has the following coordinates:\n: x_3 = \\frac{2x_1y_1}{ax_1^2+y_1^2} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{5},\n: y_3 = \\frac{y_1^2-ax_1^2}{2-ax_1^2-y_1^2} = \\frac{1}{3}.\nIt is easy to see, with some little computations, that the point P_3=\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{5}, \\frac{1}{3}\\right) belongs to the curve 3x^2 + y^2 = 1 + 2x^2y^2.\nExtended coordinates\nThere is another kind of coordinate system with which a point in the twisted Edwards curves can be represented.\nA point (x,y,z)  on ax^2+y^2= 1+dx^2y^2 is represented as X, Y, Z, T satisfying the following equations x&nbsp;=&nbsp;X/Z, y&nbsp;=&nbsp;Y/Z, xy&nbsp;=&nbsp;T/Z.\nThe coordinates of the point (X:Y:Z:T) are called the extended twisted Edwards coordinates. The identity element is represented by (0:1:1:0). The negative of a point is (−X:Y:Z:−T).\nInverted twisted Edwards coordinates\nThe coordinates of the point (X_1:Y_1:Z_1)  are called the inverted twisted Edwards coordinates on the curve\n(X^2+aY^2)Z^2= X^2Y^2+dZ^4with X_1Y_1Z_1 \\ne 0; this point to the affine one (Z_1/X_1, Z_1/Y_1) on E_{E, a, d}.\nBernstein and Lange introduced these inverted coordinates, for the case a=1 and observed that the coordinates save time in addition.\nProjective twisted Edwards coordinates\nThe equation for the projective twisted Edwards curve is given as:\n(aX^2+Y^2)Z^2= Z^4+dX^2Y^2 For Z1&nbsp;≠&nbsp;0 the point (X1:Y1:Z1) represents the affine point (x1 =&nbsp;X1/Z1, y1 = Y1/Z1) on EE,a,d.\nExpressing an elliptic curve in twisted Edwards form saves time in arithmetic, even when the same curve can be expressed in the Edwards form.\nAddition in projective twisted curves\nThe addition on a projective twisted Edwards curve is given by\n:(X3:Y3:Z3) = (X1:Y1:Z1) + (X2:Y2:Z2)\nand costs 10Multiplications + 1Squaring + 2D + 7 additions, where the 2D are one multiplication by a and one by d.\n;Algorithm\n:A = Z1 · Z2,\n:B = A2\n:C = X1 · X2\n:D = Y1 · Y2\n:E = dC · D\n:F = B − E\n:G = B + E\n:X3 = A · F((X1 + Y1) · (X2 + Y2) − C − D)\n:Y3 = A · G · (D − aC)\n:Z3 = F · G\nDoubling on projective twisted curves\nDoubling on the projective twisted curve is given by\n:(X3:Y3:Z3) = 2(X1:Y1:Z1).\nThis costs 3Multiplications + 4Squarings + 1D + 7additions, where 1D is a multiplication by a.\n;Algorithm:\n:B = (X1 + Y1)2\n:C = X12\n:D = Y12\n:E = aC\n:F = E + D\n:H = Z12\n:J = F − 2H\n:X3 = (B − C − D).J\n:Y3 = F · (E − D)\n:Z3 = F · J\nSee also\n* EdDSA\n* For more information about the running time required in a specific case, see Table of costs of operations in elliptic curves.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* http://hyperelliptic.org/EFD/g1p/index.html\n* http://hyperelliptic.org/EFD/g1p/auto-twisted.html\n* The Ed25519 algorithm: http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/"
