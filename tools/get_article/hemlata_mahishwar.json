Her father, Ramprasad Meshram, worked as a food inspector, while her mother, Premlata Meshram, was a homemaker. Due to her father's frequent transfers to small villages and towns, continuing education in one place was challenging. Hemlata's schooling journey took her across various locations: she studied from first to third grade in Raipur, fourth and fifth in Saraipali, sixth and seventh in Balaghat, and eighth and ninth in Bastar. She completed her higher secondary education in 1983 at the Government Girls' High School, Kalibadi, Bastar. Hemlata pursued her Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and Master of Arts (M.A.) in Hindi literature from Durga College, Raipur. She eventually completed a B.Ed., M.Phil., and Ph.D.\nCareer\nSince 2010, she has served as a professor in the department of Hindi at Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India. Prior to this, she was the head of the department of Hindi at Guru Ghasidas Vishwavidyalaya, Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh, where she contributed from 1989 to 2010.\nSelected works\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nPublications\n* Rashtriya Asmita: Ek Bhartiy Drishtikon Rashtriy Asmita: Ek Bhartiy Drishtikon Anytha, Editor: Krishn Kishor. 1 Jun 2008\n* Bhasha Aur BhashaheentaBhasha Aur Bhashaheenta Kriti Sanskriti SANDHAN. 1 Jan 2005\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.forwardpress.in/author/hemlata-maheshwar/ Hemlata Mahishwar] author at Forward Press"
