The three Imperial and Royal ministers were appointed and relieved from office by the Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary himself.\nUntil 1911, the ministers were called Reich Ministers of War. Upon the accession of Moritz von Auffenberg, following Hungarian requests not to be summarized under an Austrian realm that did not consist of the Hungarian lands at that time, the ministers were called Imperial and Royal () Ministers of War.\nList:\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n| acting            = y\n}}\n}}\n| officeholder_sort = von Pitreich, Heinrich\n| born_year         = 1841\n| died_year         = 1920\n| term_start        = 18 December 1902\n| term_end          = 24 October 1906\n| timeinoffice      =\n}}\n| officeholder_sort = von Schönaich, Franz\n| born_year         = 1844\n| died_year         = 1916\n| term_start        = 24 October 1906\n| term_end          = 20 September 1911\n| timeinoffice      =\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\nThe influence of the Austro-Hungarian War Minister was limited, due to the rivalry between the Austrian Minister-President and the Prime Minister of Hungary. Moreover, it was the Emperor who acted as commander-in-chief of the Imperial and Royal Armed Might, served by his personal military chancellery and represented by an Inspector General, a position held by Field Marshal Archduke Albert of Austria-Teschen from 1869 to 1895. His successor General of the Cavalry and Admiral Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Este in 1906 achieved the dismissal of Minister Pitreich and 76-year-old Chief of the General Staff Friedrich von Beck-Rzikowsky, who was replaced by Franz Ferdinand's confidant Field Marshal Lieutenant Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf. Dismissed in 1911 but again appointed together with Minister Alexander von Krobatin during the 1912 Balkan Wars, Conrad acted autonomously, being directly responsible to the emperor. In the 1914 July Crisis upon the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, he and Minister Krobatin declared the Austro-Hungarian armed forces 'prepared for war'.\nOn 30 October 1918, Emperor Charles I of Austria assigned the Naval command to the newly established Yugoslavian State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. After the Kingdom of Hungary left the real union with Austria the next day, the last Austro-Hungarian minister Stöger-Steiner had to supervise the liquidation of the remaining Cisleithanian troops. Upon the resignation of Emperor Charles on 12 November, he was answerable to an Army state secretary of the republican German-Austrian government under Chancellor Karl Renner. The 'War Ministry in Liquidation' was renamed 'Military Liquidation Agency' in 1920, when the Austrian Federal Ministry of the Army was established. It was not dissolved until 1931.\nThe War Ministry\nThe Ministry initially was located at the historical seat of the , the Court Council of War serving the Habsburg monarchs on  square in the central  borough of Vienna. After the Council's dissolution in the 1848 Revolution, the building had housed the War Ministry of the Austrian Empire; Minister Theodor Franz Baillet von Latour was lynched in front of it during the October Uprising.\nFrom 1909 to 1913, the imposing Neoclassical Imperial and Royal War Ministry headquarters on  boulevard, the department's final home, was erected according to plans designed by architect Ludwig Baumann, who had also built the Oriental Academy, the current US embassy. Dedicated on 1 May 1913 during the reign of Emperor Francis Joseph I and Minister Krobatin's tenure, it can still be seen in Vienna today; it is officially called Government Building () and is used as seat of the Minister for Economy, the Minister for Social Affairs and the Minister for Agriculture and Environment. In front of the ministry building  as well as, since 1913, of the existing building stands the equestrian monument of Field Marshal Joseph Radetzky, the most venerated military leader of the Austrian monarchy, designed by Kaspar von Zumbusch.\nThe Navy Section of the ministry () had its own building at , corner of , behind the headquarters and is still existing, too. At the outside of this building the coats of arms of 16 Imperial and Royal ports on the Adriatic Coast are displayed.\nSee also\n* Supreme Commander of the Imperial and Royal Armed Forces\n* Austrian Minister of Defence (Austria-Hungary)\n* Minister of Defense (Austria)\n* Austro-Hungarian General Staff\n* Chief of the General Staff (Austria)\nReferences"
