In addition, they needed to have been produced or majority co-produced by a British company, or in receipt of at least 51% of their budget from a British source. Lastly, they could not be solely funded by a single studio.\nThe award ceremony, hosted by John Gordon Sinclair, was held for the second year in succession at the Café Royal, in London's West End. Winners in eleven categories were selected from the shortlists and a further two were awarded entirely at the jury's discretion, whose make up included Chris Auty, Daneil Weinzweig, Hossein Amini, Michiyo Yoshizaki, Norma Heyman, Pippa Cross, Richard Jobson, Sadie Frost and Sarah Radclyffe.\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"50%\" |Best British Independent Film\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Director\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Wonderland – Michael Winterbottom\n** A Room for Romeo Brass – Shane Meadows\n** Gods and Monsters – Bill Condon\n** Hilary and Jackie – Anand Tucker\n** The War Zone – Tim Roth\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Anand Tucker '– Hilary and Jackie'\n** Bill Condon – Gods and Monsters\n** Shane Meadows – A Room for Romeo Brass\n** Tim Roth – The War Zone\n** Michael Winterbottom – Wonderland\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Actor\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Actress\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Ian McKellan – Gods and Monsters as James Whale'\n** Daniel Auteuil – The Lost Son as Xavier Lombard\n** Michael Caine – Little Voice as Ray Say\n** Daniel Craig – The Trench as Sgt.
