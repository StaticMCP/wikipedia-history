The building was renovated in 1589 for Elizabeth I. The former lodge, now a three-storey building, has been extensively restored and is now a museum, which has been managed by the City of London Corporation since 1960. Admission is free.\nThere is a smaller hunting lodge, \"The Little Standing\", about a mile away in Loughton, part of the Warren, the Epping Forest HQ.\nFile:Queen Elizabeth's Hunting Lodge 06.JPG|Lodge interior\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/green-spaces/epping-forest/where-to-go-in-epping-forest/queen-elizabeths-hunting-lodge City of London – Queen Elizabeth's Hunting Lodge]"
