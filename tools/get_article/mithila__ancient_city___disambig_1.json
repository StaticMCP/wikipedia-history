The location of Mithila is disputed with one possibility being the archaeological site of Baliraajgadh in present-day Madhubani district, Bihar, India, Sitamarhi  in present-day Bihar, India, and Mukhiyapatti of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya rural municipality of Dhanusha in present-day Nepal.\nDisputed location\nJanakpur, in present-day Nepal, has been mentioned in Ramayana to be the location of the ancient city of Mithila.  However, very few archaeological evidence has been found to support these claims. Some scholars have claimed Baliraajgadh in present-day Madhubani district of Bihar, India to be the location of Mithila. Some archaeological evidences have been found in Baliraajgadh, however, excavation has not supported any of the claims. Some people also claim Sitamarhi in present-day Bihar, India to be the location of Mithila.\nSee also\n* Videha\n* Mithila (region)\n* Maithili language\n* Maithils\n* History of the Mithila region\nNotes\nReferences\n;Bibliography\n* Raychaudhuri, J.C.
