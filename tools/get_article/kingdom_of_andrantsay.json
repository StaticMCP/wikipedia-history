It is named after the river of Andrantsay near Betafo.\nHistory\nThe kingdom of Andrantsay was founded in the 1600s by Andrianony from Alasora, a contemporary of Andriamasinavalona. He built the kingdom by uniting the original inhabitants of the region and migrants from Imerina.\nDuring the 18th century, the kingdom became a vassal of Menabe and many migrants from the West integrated into the kingdom as well as refugees from Imerina kingdoms during the Imerina civil wars. The kingdom is the first inland malagasy kingdom to be documented when the French traveller Nicolas Mayeur reported his time there in his work ''Voyage au pays d'Ancove. In the late 1790s it was annexed into Imerina kingdom as part of the  Imerina enin-toko under the name of Vakinankaratra''.\nLocation\nAndrantsay includes most of the region of Vakinankaratra and some part of Itasy.\nReferences"
