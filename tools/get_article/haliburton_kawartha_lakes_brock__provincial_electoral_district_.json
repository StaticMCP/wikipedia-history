It elects one member to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.\nIt was created in 1999 from parts of Victoria—Haliburton, Durham East, Durham—York and Hastings—Peterborough.\nWhen the riding was created it was called Haliburton—Victoria—Brock, and included all of Victoria County, most of Haliburton County, the townships of Brock, Galway-Cavendish and Harvey, Burleigh and Anstruther, Chandos and Cavan, as well as the village of Millbrook.\nIn 2007 it was renamed Haliburton—Kawartha Lakes—Brock after Victoria County was renamed Kawartha Lakes. The riding also gained the municipality of Algonquin Highlands, plus the entire municipality of Cavan-Monaghan. It was identical to the federal riding of the same name until the boundaries changed before the 2025 Canadian federal election.\n2009 by-election\nThe 2009 by-election in Haliburton—Kawartha Lakes—Brock unfolded as one of the more contentious and politically charged events in Ontario's recent electoral history. On February 4, 2009, a writ was issued for a by-election to be held on March 5, 2009. The contest was triggered by the resignation of sitting Progressive Conservative MPP Laurie Scott, who stepped down to make way for PC leader John Tory's return to the Ontario legislature—a controversial political maneuver that quickly became the focal point of the campaign.\nTory, a former leader without a seat, was attempting yet again to win elected office after losing his own seat in the 2007 provincial election. However, his attempt to return through Haliburton—Kawartha Lakes—Brock was fraught with challenges. Many local voters expressed strong opposition to Scott's resignation, with a February 9 local poll from the Lindsay Post showing that nearly 70 percent of respondents disapproved of her stepping down solely to enable Tory's candidacy. Almost half of those polled stated they were less inclined to vote PC as a result.\nTory's outsider status—he was based in Toronto and perceived as disconnected from rural concerns—only deepened local skepticism. His moderate stance on certain issues, including public funding for religious schools, further alienated parts of the traditionally conservative base, leading to decreased enthusiasm among PC voters and lower turnout for his campaign.\nChallenging Tory was Rick Johnson, the Ontario Liberal Party candidate and former president of the Ontario Public School Boards' Association. Johnson had previously contested the riding in 2007 and resigned his presidency to oppose Tory's education policy, particularly his push for extending public funding to religious schools. In 2009, he returned with solid backing—the local Liberal riding association endorsed him unanimously.\nThe riding also saw interest from smaller parties. Brad Harness, leader of the marginal Reform Party of Ontario, criticized Tory as an \"urbanite\" unfit for rural representation, and declared plans to contest the by-election. However, despite the strong rhetoric, the party ultimately failed to register a candidate in time.\nThe Green Party of Ontario nominated Mike Schreiner, a well-regarded local food advocate, sustainable community champion, and entrepreneur, who would later become leader of the provincial Green Party.\nIn a surprising political upset, Rick Johnson defeated Tory, ending the latter's tenure as party leader shortly thereafter. The by-election is often remembered as a potent example of local voter backlash against perceived political opportunism and underestimation of rural political sentiment in Ontario.\nMembers of Provincial Parliament\nElection results\n|}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | 2014 general election redistributed results\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"130px\" colspan=\"2\" | Party\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"50px\" | Vote\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"30px\" | %\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Progressive Conservative ||align=right| 19,278 ||align=right| 40.30\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Liberal ||align=right| 16,872 ||align=right| 35.27\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| New Democratic ||align=right| 9,635 ||align=right|20.14\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Green ||align=right| 2,048 ||align=right| 4.28\n|}\n}}\n}}\n|align=\"left\" colspan=2|Liberal  gain from Progressive Conservative\n|align=\"right\"|Swing\n|align=\"right\"|  +11.58\n|\n}}\n2007 electoral reform referendum\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; clear:both\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n! colspan=4|2007 Ontario electoral reform referendum\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n! colspan=2 style=\"width: 130px\"|Side\n! style=\"width: 50px\"|Votes\n! style=\"width: 40px\"|%\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"blue\"|\n|First Past the Post\n|33,156\n|70.1\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"green\"|\n|Mixed member proportional\n|14,166\n|29.9\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"white\"|\n!Total valid votes\n| 47,322\n|100.0\n|}\nReferences\nSources\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012015710/http://www.elections.on.ca/en-CA/Tools/PastResults.htm Elections Ontario Past Election Results]\n*[https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/2017/preo/2017atlasmaps/035HaliburtonKawarthaLakesBrockAtlasMap.pdf Map of riding for 2018 election]"
