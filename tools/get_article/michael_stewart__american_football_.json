He then played three seasons for the Miami Dolphins. He was selected 213th overall by the Los Angeles Rams in the eighth round of the 1987 NFL draft.\nThree times Stewart was drafted in baseball but he finally opted for pro football after an outstanding career with the Fresno State U., Bulldogs. The Rams, who have been less than astute with their higher draft picks, did themselves proud in grabbing Stewart as an eighth-rounder in 1987. Although a linebacker and pass rusher at BC, Stewart was converted to safety by Fresno coach Jim Sweeney and in that role, has established himself as a fast, hard hitter for the Rams, with aggressiveness that spills over to special team.\nIn 1992, Stewart started all 16 games last season and was second on the team in tackles with 81. He had two interceptions, forced two fumbles and had a sack. He made a reported $270,000 last year and when negotiations on a new contract began this year he argued that he was worth about three times that much.\nThe Rams originally offered a three-year deal worth about $650,000 a year, but by the time Stewart ended his holdout, he had settled for a $1.1 million, two-year deal.\nReferences"
