Built in 1908, the lighthouses help to guide ship traffic from Lake Winnipeg into the river. They work in tandem with the Warren Landing Upper Range Lights.\nBoth lights of the range were originally square, pyramidal frame towers; at some point the rear tower was replaced by a skeletal tower, which still survives.  The range is still active, and is one of the remotest light stations in Canada.\nSee also\n* List of lighthouses in Manitoba\n* List of lighthouses in Canada\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/aids/home Aids to Navigation] Canadian Coast Guard\n*[https://www.ibiblio.org/lighthouse/photos/Canada/Manitoba/WarrenLanding.htm Lighthouse Database page, with picture of front tower]"
