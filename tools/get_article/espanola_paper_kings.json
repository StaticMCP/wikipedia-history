They are members of the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League (NOJHL) and play their home games at the Espanola Regional Recreational Complex.\nHistory\nThe Express were one of two expansion teams that entered the league prior to the start of the 2015–16 NOJHL season. The team hired former NHL forward Tom McCarthy as its first head coach. McCarthy had previously coached the Espanola Rivermen prior to the teams disbandment.\nIn August 2016, coach McCarthy announced he was taking a head coaching position with HSC Csíkszereda in the Romanian Hockey League but would also remain involved with the Express as one of the owners. Co-coach Jason Rapcewicz took over as head coach. However, after one season, McCarthy returned to Espanola and the head coaching position. He left again after one season and was replaced by Dave Clancy from the Rayside-Balfour Canadians.\n|+ style=\"background:#EC0A0B; border-top:#000000 5px solid; border-bottom:#000000 5px solid\"|\n! style=\"width:4em; text-align:left;\" | Season\n! style=\"width:2.2em;\" |\n! style=\"width:2.2em;\" |\n! style=\"width:2.2em;\" |\n! style=\"width:2.2em;\" |\n! style=\"width:2.2em;\" |\n! style=\"width:2.2em;\" |\n! style=\"width:2.2em;\" |\n! style=\"width:2.2em;\" |\n! style=\"width:10em; text-align:left;\" | Season\n! style=\"width:18em; text-align:left;\" | Postseason\n|-align=\"right\"\n|align=\"left\"|2015–16 ||54||12||39||0||3||132||243||27||align=\"left\"|5th in division10th overall||align=\"left\"|Lost first round against Soo Eagles (2:0)\n|-align=\"right\"\n|align=\"left\"|2016–17 ||56||9||45||1||1||139||297||20||align=\"left\"|6th in division11th overall||align=\"left\"|Did not qualify\n|-align=\"right\"\n|align=\"left\"|2017–18 ||56||2||52||1||1||114||344||6||align=\"left\"|6th in division12th overall||align=\"left\"|Did not qualify\n|-align=\"right\"\n|align=\"left\"|2018–19 ||56||10||43||0||3||145||291||23||align=\"left\"|6th in division12th overall||align=\"left\"|Did not qualify\n|-align=\"right\"\n|align=\"left\"|2019–20 ||56||17||34||0||5||167||247||39||align=\"left\"|5th in division10th overall||align=\"left\"|Lost first round against Soo Eagles (2:0)\n|-align=\"right\"\n|align=\"left\"|2020–21 ||12||5||4||0||3||46||56||13||colspan=2; align=\"center\"|Withdrew from competition midseason\n|-align=\"right\"\n|align=\"left\"|2021–22 ||48||13||31||4||0||150||217||30||align=\"left\"|6th in division10th overall||align=\"left\"|Did not qualify\nSource:\nJason Rapcewicz became the sole owner and head coach in 2019.
