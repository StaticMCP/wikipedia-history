There are many case studies and further links available.\nSelf-contained systems and microservices\nWhile self-contained systems are similar to microservices there are differences: A system will usually contain fewer SCS than microservices. Also microservices can communicate with other microservices – even synchronously. SCS prefer no communication or asynchronous communication. Microservices might also have a separate UI unlike the SCS that include a UI.\nSelf-contained systems and Vertical Slice Architecture\nSelf-contained systems and vertical slice architecture have similarities but also decisive differences. Both approaches divide a system into smaller, manageable units. Vertical slices are cut on the basis of features, Self-contained systems along the boundaries of functional domains. They also differ in the strictness with which they attempt to encapsulate and isolate specialized logic.\nUsage\nThere are quite a few known usages of SCS – e.g. at Otto, Galeria Kaufhof, and Kühne+Nagel.\nReferences"
