He helped the club gain promotion to 1. deild karla, the second division in the Icelandic football league system.

In 2012, he signed with Vikingur R, starting 24 games and tallying 3 goals and 11 assists.\nUnited States\nHaving suffered through several injuries Schwartz saw limited playing time with Breiðablik, and returned to the United States in 2010. He signed with the Dayton Dutch Lions in the USL Premier Development League, establishing himself as the club's starting right back during the 2010 season. Schwartz was noted for his attacking prowess from his right back position and began to draw interest from several Major League Soccer clubs including Toronto FC, Colorado Rapids and New England Revolution.
