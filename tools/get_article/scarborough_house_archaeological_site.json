Called Occohannock House for its location on the creek of the same name, the site is now buried in a silted-over cove called Scarborough Gut.  Virginia state archaeologists have mapped the extent and integrity of the site.\nThe site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Accomack County, Virginia\nReferences"
