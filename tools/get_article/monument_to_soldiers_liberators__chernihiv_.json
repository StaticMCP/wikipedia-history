The main element of the composition is the legendary T-34 tank - a Soviet medium tank during the Great Patriotic War, the most massive medium tank of the Second World War. Combat vehicles of this series were the first to break into Chernigov, occupied by the Nazis.\nThere are legends in the city about the tank installed on the Circle:\n# This is the first tank to break into Chernihiv.\n# The inscription \"For the Motherland!\" on the left side of the tower - during the Great Patriotic War, it was found under layers of paint.\n# If you fill in the solarium and put the batteries in, the tank will go.\n# The tank is not securely closed, homeless people were sleeping in it\nGallery\nFile:Peremohi Avenue in Chernihiv 02.JPG|\nFile:Чернігів.
