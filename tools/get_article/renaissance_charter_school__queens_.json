It houses 550 students in grades kindergarten through high school.  It started as a first-generation \"New Visions School\" sponsored by New Visions for Public Schools.  It is located in the Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens. In 2000 it converted to charter status, one of the first charter schools in New York City.  The current principal is Stacey Gauthier.\nHistory\nIn 1991 New Visions for Public Schools (originally named \"The Fund for New York City Public Education\"), in conjunction with then-Chancellor Joseph Fernandez,  issued an RFP asking community groups to submit proposals for innovative schools.  The proposal for The Renaissance School was submitted by \"The Committee of Concerned Educators\" and Community School District 30; it was one of 16 accepted proposals from nearly 300 submissions.  The proposal for the school was written in fictional narrative form chronicling a tour of the school by prospective parents.\nThe school opened with 130 students, grades 4–7, in September 1993, in one wing of JHS 204 in Long Island City. In 1995, it expanded to grades K and 6–9, and moved to the site of the St. Patrick's parish school which had closed the prior year. In 1996, it expanded to grades K–10 and moved into a permanent leased space on 37th Avenue in Jackson Heights, then became Renaissance Charter School, one of the first five charter schools in New York, in 2000.\nModel\nRenaissance Charter School was chosen as the site for a 2003 press conference held by then-mayor Michael Bloomberg announcing and expansion of charter schools, in which he labeled Renaissance as \"a charter school that works.\"  The Renaissance model has several components.\n* Its motto is \"Developing Leaders for the Renaissance of New York\".
