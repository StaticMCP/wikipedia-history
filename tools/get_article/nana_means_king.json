Stripped of nearly all material possession, a place to live, and even his dreams of glory, he must find his way through the unfamiliar terrain of the displaced and invisible. It is in this hour of darkness, at his most vulnerable, that his life takes an unexpected turn when he finds beauty and love growing in the concrete wasteland. Through the mirror that is Shauna, he quickly realizes the past can be a prison we create for our own minds. It is only by helping to free Shauna from her prison that he is eventually freed from his own.\nCast\n* Armah Richard Armah as Chris Kuma\n* David Osei as Kwame\n* Roxana Zachos as Shauna\nAwards\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
