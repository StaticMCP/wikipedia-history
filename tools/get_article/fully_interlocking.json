      "text": "# Fully Interlocking\n\nFully Interlocking is the fourth album by the Dutch symphonic rock group Solution. It was released in 1977 by The Rocket Record Company. The line \"Fully interlocking\" appears on jigsaw puzzle boxes, as referenced on the album cover.\nHistory\nLike the preceding album Cordon Bleu, Fully Interlocking was produced by Gus Dudgeon and released on the label he set up with Elton John. Another name reappearing from Cordon Bleu was engineer Phil Dunne, while Hipgnosis again did the artwork. This time the recording location was switched from Wales to The Sol in Cookham, England.\nFully Interlocking comprised four jazzy instrumental pieces sandwiched by two vocal songs, the lyrics of which were written by singer Guus Willemse. This album shares the highest quantity of instrumental tracks with their first album Solution (1971); the other four albums they released included more songs with lyrics. \"Give Some More\" was released as a single in Europe, backed by an edit of \"Chappaqua\" from Cordon Bleu. \"Empty Faces\" was also a 45, with \"French Melodie\" as the B-side.\nFully Interlocking charted in the Netherlands on 5 November 1977, reaching #30 and spending 7 weeks on the chart.\nThe album was re-released by CBS in 1980 (again on vinyl) and 1988 (on CD).\nTrack listing\n#\"Give Some More\" (5:24)\n#*Music by Tom, Willem and Guus\n#*Lyrics by Guus\n#\"Carousel\" (7:18)\n#*Music by Tom, Willem, Guus and Hans\n#\"Sonic Sea\" (7:19)\n#*Music by Tom and Willem\n#\"Free Inside\" (6:20)\n#*Music by Tom, Willem, Guus and Hans\n#\"French Melodie\" (4:35)\n#*Music by Tom\n#\"Empty Faces\" (6:32)\n#*Music and lyrics by Guus\nPersonnel\nTom Barlage: alto sax, soprano sax, flutes, string ensemble, organ, percussion, electric piano\nWillem Ennes: electric piano, acoustic piano, organ, synthesizer, string-ensemble\nGuus Willemse: bass guitar, lead vocals\nHans Waterman: drums\n*All backing vocals by Tom, Willem and Guus.\n*Ray Cooper - congas and percussion on \"Give Some More\" and \"Free Inside\"\n*Stuart Epps - additional backing vocal on \"Empty Faces\"\nProducer: Gus Dudgeon.\nEngineer: Phil Dunne.\nAssistant engineer: Stuart Epps.\nMastering: Ian Cooper at Utopia Recording Studios.\nRecorded by Moonlight.\nExternal links\n*[http://www.solutionmusic.nl/disc-fully.html Official website run by Guus Willemse]"
