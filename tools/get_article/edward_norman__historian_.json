From 1999 to 2004, he was canon chancellor of York Minster. He was educated at Selwyn College, Cambridge, where he received an Open Scholarship.\nEarly life\nNorman was educated at Chatham House Grammar School, Ramsgate, Kent, and the Monoux School Walthamstow. He went to Selwyn College, Cambridge, on an Open Scholarship.\nCareer\nNorman lectured in history at the University of Cambridge for many years. He was a fellow of Selwyn College (from 1962 to 1964) before moving to Jesus College, Cambridge, to take up a similar position. Today, he is an emeritus fellow of Peterhouse, Cambridge.\nHe was dean of Peterhouse for 17 years and then dean and chaplain at Christ Church College, Canterbury. He was also professor of history at the University of York. He is a member of the conservative-leaning Peterhouse school of history and was associated with the influential Cambridge Right, along with Roger Scruton and Maurice Cowling. On 7 October 2012, he was received into the Catholic Church by way of the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham.\nNorman was the BBC Reith Lecturer in 1978. For his series of six radio lectures, titled \"Christianity and the World\", he discussed the relationship between religion and politics. Margaret Thatcher once invited him to Chequers, although Norman insists he is not a Thatcherite and says he is \"appalled by the results of naked capitalism\". Norman's book Church and Society in Modern England, published a year after Thatcher's election as Conservative leader, argued that Christianity and conservatism were natural allies based on the moral superiority of the free market. The free market, Norman argued, left individual responsible for their choices rather than dependent on state welfare, which rendered people \"moral cripples\". Thatcher exclaimed: \"Dr Norman, you are a prophet.\"\nWritings\n*The Catholic Church and Ireland (1965)\n*The Conscience of the State in North America (1968)\n*Anti-Catholicism in Victorian England (1968)\n*The Early Development of Irish Society (1969)\n*A History of Modern Ireland (1971)\n*Church and Society in Modern England (1976)\n*\"Christianity and Politics\" in Maurice Cowling (ed.), Conservative Essays (Cassell, 1978, pp.&nbsp;69–81.)\n*[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00gq28g Christianity and the World] BBC Reith Lectures (1978)\n*Christianity and the World Order  Book based on the BBC Reith Lectures (1979)\n*Christianity in the Southern Hemisphere (1981)\n*The English Catholic Church in the Nineteenth Century (1983)\n*Roman Catholicism in England (1985)\n*The Victorian Christian Socialists (1987)\n*The House of God: Church Architecture, Style and History (1990)\n*Entering the Darkness: Christianity and its modern substitutes (1991)\n*An Anglican Catechism (2001)\n*Out of the Depths (2001)\n*Secularisation (2002)\n*Anglican Difficulties (2004)\n*The Mercy of God's Humility (2004)\n*The Roman Catholic Church'' (2006)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://justus.anglican.org/resources/misc/norman98.html The speech he gave at the Lambeth Conference of 1998]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040417084343/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2004/02/24/bavic24.xml  'Anglicanism is going to tip into the sea']\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070416114155/http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/books/reviews/article2424425.ece 'The Roman Catholic Church by Edward Norman - Book Review by Michael Arditti in the UK's Independent, April 2007']"
