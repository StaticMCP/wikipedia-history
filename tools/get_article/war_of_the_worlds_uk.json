The following year, War of the Worlds was held over two days at the 2300 Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and in 2016 it was expanded to a three-show tour with shows taking place in Dearborn, Michigan, Toronto, Ontario and New York City. The 2017 War of the Worlds tour was held from May 7 to 14. On May 22, ROH announced a second War of the Worlds tour, this time taking place in the United Kingdom, for which they and NJPW would be joined by Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) and RPW. The three shows would take place on August 18 in London, August 19 in Liverpool and August 20 in Edinburgh.\nStorylines\nThe War of the Worlds UK tour featured professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\nOn August 9, ROH announced their sole World Championship match of the tour, which pitted defending champion and Bullet Club member Cody against Los Ingobernables de Japón member Sanada.\nResults\nNight 1\n|times  =\n|match1=Mark Briscoe defeated Ryan Smile\n|stip1=Singles match\n|time1=\n|dark1=\n|match2=The Addiction (Christopher Daniels and Frankie Kazarian) defeated Rey Bucanero and Último Guerrero\n|stip2=Tag team match\n|time2=\n|match3=Jay Briscoe defeated Kenny King\n|stip3=Singles match\n|time3=\n|match4=Bully Ray defeated Jay Lethal, Sha Samuels, and Silas Young\n|stip4=Four Corner Survival match\n|time4=\n|match5=Dalton Castle and The Boys (Boy 1 and Boy 2) (c) defeated Delirious, Jushin Thunder Liger, and Místico\n|stip5=Six-man tag team match for the ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Championship\n|time5=\n|match6=Kushida (c) defeated Titán\n|stip6=Singles match for the ROH World Television Championship\n|time6=\n|match7=Los Ingobernables de Japón (Bushi, Evil, Hiromu Takahashi, Sanada, and Tetsuya Naito) defeated Bullet Club (Cody, Hangman Page, Marty Scurll, and The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson & Nick Jackson))\n|stip7=Ten-man tag team match\n|time7=\n}}\nNight 2\nNight 3\nSee also\n*Professional wrestling in the United Kingdom\n*Professional wrestling promotions in the United Kingdom\nReferences"
