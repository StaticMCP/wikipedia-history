Cao Gui requested an audience.\nA fellow villager said:\n“Those who eat meat (i.e., the nobles and ministers) are already deliberating the matter—why should you get involved?”\nCao Gui replied:\n“Those who eat meat are narrow-minded and short-sighted. They cannot plan far ahead.”\nHe then went in to see the Duke.\nOn Justification for War\nCao Gui asked:\n“By what means will you engage in battle?”\nThe Duke replied:\n“I ensure the people have food and clothing, and I do not monopolize them. I share with the people.”\nCao Gui said:\n“Such small kindness has not yet reached everyone—so the people will not follow you.”\nThe Duke added:\n“I offer sacrificial animals and jade to the spirits—I dare not be excessive, and always keep my word.”\nCao Gui replied:\n“Such small faith is not yet trustworthy to the gods—so they will not bless you.”\nThe Duke said:\n“When judging legal disputes, whether great or small, though I cannot always see clearly, I always strive for fairness.”\nCao Gui responded:\n“That is a matter of justice and loyalty. On this basis, we can fight. If we must fight, let me join you.”\nIn Battle\nThe Duke allowed him to ride in the chariot. They fought at Changshao.\nThe Duke was about to order the drumbeat to attack.\nCao Gui said:\n“Not yet.”\nThe Qi army beat their drums three times.\nCao Gui then said:\n“Now is the time!”\nThe Lu army attacked, and the Qi army was defeated.\nThe Duke wanted to give chase.\nCao Gui said:\n“Not yet.”\nHe got down to observe the enemy's tracks, then climbed up the front of the chariot to observe their banners and said:\n“Now it is appropriate.”\nThen they pursued and routed the Qi army.\nOn Military Strategy\nAfter the victory, the Duke asked about the reason behind the timing.\nCao Gui replied:\n“Warfare depends on morale.\nAt the first drumbeat, soldiers are full of spirit.\nAt the second, their spirit wanes.\nAt the third, it is exhausted.\nTheir energy was spent while ours was still full—this is why we won.\nAnd large states are unpredictable—there may be an ambush.\nWhen I saw their tracks were disordered and their banners were drooping, I knew they were truly in retreat. That’s why I pursued them.”\nReferences\nFor information on the character Cao Gui\nhttps://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%95%BF%E5%8B%BA%E4%B9%8B%E6%88%98\nThe original source of >\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuo_Zhuan"
