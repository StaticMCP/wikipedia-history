They are to be distinguished from the Bidjara of southwestern Queensland and the Badjiri of southern Queensland.\nCountry\nThe Pitjara were estimated by Norman Tindale to have tribal lands of approximately , beginning with the areas of the headwaters of Nogoa and Warrego rivers. Their territorial extensions ran north of Augathella, to Mantuan Downs. Their eastern limits were around Killarney and Chesterton. To the south, they were present as far as Caroline, while their western borders were on the Nive River.\nHistory\nTindale entertained the possibility that the Pitjara and Badjiri split up, before the advent of white settlement, as a result of an easterly thrust by other tribes which caused them to develop as independent tribal realities.\nAlternative names\n* Bidjera\n* Peechera\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*"
