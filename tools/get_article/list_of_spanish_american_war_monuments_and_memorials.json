The United Spanish War Veterans was one of such organization that became the dominant association for Spanish American War veterans. Later a womans auxiliary made up of wives, daughters, and granddaughters was also created which was known as the Auxiliary Spanish War Veterans.\nAs the United Spanish War Veterans organization and their auxiliary grew so did the number of monuments and memorials to the Spanish American War. It soon then became a mission for many of the Camps to erect at least one monument in their locality.\nWhen the United Spanish War Veterans then disbanded their successors, Sons of Spanish American War Veterans, then took on their mission of not only the remembrance of said veterans but also in erecting monuments and memorials to the Spanish American War.\nMonument and Memorial Removal\nRecently monuments and memorials and famous figures of such war have been the target of removal and destruction. Often time localities or individuals cite colonialism or imperialism as reasons for why such memorials should be removed.\nList of Removals\n*USWV Aston Park Memorial, Asheville, North Carolina - Removed May, 2023\n*Volunteer Park Memorial, Seattle, Washington - Removed August, 2021\n*Theodore Roosevelt Equestrian Monument, Portland, Oregon - Toppled October 11, 2020\n*Lone Fir Cemetery Spanish American War Memorial, Portland, Oregon - Toppled November, 2020\n*Theodore Roosevelt Equestrian Statue of the Natural History Museum, New York City, New York - Removed January, 2022\n*Fitzhugh Lee Spanish American War Memorial, Richmond, Virginia - Removed July, 2020\n*John B.
