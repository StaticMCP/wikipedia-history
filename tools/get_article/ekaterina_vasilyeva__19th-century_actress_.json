The 14 October 1863 premiere of Alexander Ostrovsky's A Profitable Position was given as a benefit performance for Vasilyeva. Another famous Maly benefit, the A.F. Bogdanov-directed production of Ivan Turgenev's A Month in a Country on 13 January 1872 celebrated the 25th Anniversary of Vasilyeva's stage career. Ostrovsky considered her to be the best Russian actress to specialize in the contemporary French, notably, Scribe's plays. Ekaterina Vasilyeva died in Bern, Switzerland, where she had been treated for tuberculosis.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.maly.ru/people?name=VasilievaE Екатерина Васильева]'s page at the Maly Theatre site"
