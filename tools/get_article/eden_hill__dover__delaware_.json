The house was built in two sections; a double-pile, side-hall three bay structure to the south, and a lower two bay section of two rooms to the north. The stuccoed dwelling has a gable roof on both sections.  It was the home of the prominent Ridgely family, who purchased the property in 1748.\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, and was later acquired by the Delaware Department of Transportation, and later still renovated for use by the state supreme court, being occupied in the early 2010s by Ridgely's descendant, Delaware Supreme Court justice Henry du Pont Ridgely.\nReferences"
