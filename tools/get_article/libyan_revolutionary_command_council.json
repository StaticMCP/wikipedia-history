The council's chairman was Muammar Gaddafi, who had the most influence and served as Libya's de facto head of state as Revolutionary Chairman of the Libyan Arab Republic and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. It was ideologically Arab nationalist, republican, anti-imperialist and pan-Arabist.\nIn 1977, the Libyan Arab Republic was abolished and Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya was established. As a part of this, the RCC was officially abolished and replaced by the general secretariat of the General People's Congress.\nHistory\nAs a result of the 1969 Libyan coup d'état led by Gaddafi, the 12-member central committee of the Free Officers Movement converted themselves into a Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), which governed the newly established Libyan Arab Republic. Below them was formed a council of ministers, headed by Mahmud Suleiman Maghribi, to oversee the implementation of RCC policy.\nThe RCC was instantly recognized by the Arab nationalist governments of Egypt, Iraq, Sudan and Syria. Egypt sent experts to support the Revolutionary Command Council which lacked experience. Gaddafi expressed Pan-Arabism, announcing the need for one united Arab state in the Middle East and North Africa. He proposed the establishment of the Federation of Arab Republics in 1972 with Egypt and Syria. It was approved by 98.6% of voters in Libya with a referendum on 1 September 1971.\nCaptain Gaddafi was promoted to the rank of colonel, and was recognized as both chairman of the RCC as well as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, becoming the de facto head of state. From 1970 to 1972, he also served as prime minister. The RCC was declared the highest authority in the Libyan Arab Republic with the ability to exercise both executive and legislative functions.\nAlthough the RCC was theoretically a collegial body that operated through discussion and consensus building, from the start it was dominated by the opinions and decisions of Gaddafi, although some of the others attempted to constrain what they saw as his excesses. As chairman of the RCC, Gaddafi was officially entitled the Revolutionary Chairman of the Libyan Arab Republic.\nThe 1969 Constitutional Proclamation granted the RCC powers to declare war, conclude and ratify treaties, appoint diplomatic envoys, receive diplomatic missions, proclaim martial law, control the Libyan Armed Forces and appoint a Council of Ministers. By 1975, Gaddafi became the only member of the RCC to initiate major political programs or policies.\nGaddafi remained the public face of the government, with the identities of the other RCC members only being publicly revealed in the Official Gazette on 10 January 1970.  All of them were young men, from (typically rural) working and middle-class backgrounds, and none had university degrees; in this way they were all distinct from the wealthy, highly educated conservatives who had previously governed the country. The coup completed, the RCC proceeded with their intentions of consolidating the revolutionary government and modernising the country.\nMonarchists and members of Idris' Senussi clan were removed from Libya's political world and armed forces; Gaddafi believed that this elite were opposed to the will of the Libyan people and needed to be expunged.  Many figures in the old regime were imprisoned, though none were executed. They maintained the previous administration's ban on political parties, and ruled by decree. Further restrictions were placed on the press, and in May 1970, trade unions were banned.\nIn June 1971, Gaddafi declared the formation of the Arab Socialist Union as the sole legal party of Libya. Gaddafi announced that it would bring true democracy with all participating, eliminate class distinctions and form a new socialist ideology based on Islam, rejecting Marxism.\nDuring a speech in Zuwarah on 15 April 1973, Gaddafi declared the Cultural Revolution which laid down five principles for the continuation of the revolution in Libya. This happened after increasing tensions between Gaddafi and his colleagues in the RCC had led him to agree to step down. Gaddafi had told the RCC that he would announce his resignation to the people at the Zuwarah speech, but he instead surprised them with his declaration of the Cultural Revolution. This made Gaddafi the uncontested leader of Libya.\nAfter Libya was converted into the \"(Great) Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\" in 1977, the remaining members of the RCC formed the apex of the \"revolutionary sector\" that oversaw the government. They were not subject to election, since they held office by virtue of having led the 1969 coup—officially described as \"the Revolution.\" As a result, although Gaddafi held no formal governmental post after 1979, he continued to have the most important role in the government of the country until his overthrow and killing in the First Libyan Civil War in 2011.\nMembership\nThe initial members (1970) were as follows:\n*Col. Muammar Gaddafi (Revolutionary Chairman)\n*Maj. Abdessalam Jallud (Vice-Chairman, Chief Executive Officer)\n*Maj. Beshir al-Saghir Hawady (until 1975)\n*Maj.
