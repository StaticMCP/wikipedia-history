The show was hosted by David Koch, with the judging panel consisting of Jonathon Welch, Iva Davies, Charli Delaney, and George Torbay.\nIt was won by the University of Newcastle Chamber Choir.\nThe format of the show is based on an idea by Swedish singer and chorister Caroline af Ugglas which has been previously adapted by many countries, most notably as Clash of the Choirs in the United States. The series involves 16 community choirs of up to 40 members from around Australia competing against each other in a knockout competition that sees them performing songs from many different musical genres. The winning choral group will receive $100,000 in prize money and a recording deal with Universal Music.\nStructure\nThe show features 16 choirs of up to 40 members participating in the competition, with 4 choirs competing per episode for the initial Round of 16. Each of those choirs has a Top Tune and a Battle Tune which they have prepared before the competition, and part of a Surprise Medley which is revealed to them on the day.\nDuring the show, each of the choirs presents their Top Tune to the judges, and then the Surprise Medley occurs, in which all of the choirs sing part (45 seconds) of a medley. The judges then deliberate, and send one group to the next stage of the competition, and immediately eliminate another group. After that, the two choirs remaining are left to sing their Battle Tunes, one straight after the other, and the judges decide who gets promoted to the next leg of the competition and who gets eliminated.\nThe stages of the competition are (in order): Round of 16 (16 choirs, 4 episodes), Quarter finals (8 choirs, 2 episodes), semi final (4 choirs, 1 episode), grand final (3 choirs, 1 episode).\nFinal results\nThe winner of was the University of Newcastle Chamber Choir. Melbourne community choir Vox Synergy battled the University of Newcastle Chamber Choir for the top prize. Vox Synergy sang of the Sarah McLachlan song \"Angel, while the University of Newcastle Chamber Choir won with their arrangement of Queen's \"Bicycle Race\", and Sting's 'Straight to My Heart'.\nThird finalist [https://web.archive.org/web/20180321190921/http://harambee.com.au/ Harambee] was eliminated after the Surprise Medley.\nReception\nViewership\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; line-height:16px; width:99%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:purple; color:white;\" colspan=\"2\" | Episode\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:purple; color:white;\" | Original airdate\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:purple; color:white;\" | Viewers\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:purple; color:white;\" | Nightly Rank\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:purple; color:white; width:05%;\"| Source\n|-\n| style=\"width:05%;\"| 1\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | \"Episode 1\"\n| 15 June 2008\n| 1.445\n| #5\n|\n|-\n| style=\"width:05%;\"| 2\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | \"Episode 2\"\n| 22 June 2008\n| 1.344\n| #6\n|\n|-\n| style=\"width:05%;\"| 3\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | \"Episode 3\"\n| 29 June 2008\n| 1.021\n| #10\n|\n|-\n| style=\"width:05%;\"| 4\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | \"Episode 4\"\n| 6 July 2008\n| 1.159\n| #8\n|\n|-\n| style=\"width:05%;\"| 5\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | \"Episode 5\"\n| 13 July 2008\n| 1.241\n| #6\n|\n|-\n| style=\"width:05%;\"| 6\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | \"Episode 6\"\n| 20 July 2008\n| 1.352\n| #6\n|\n|-\n| style=\"width:05%;\"| 7\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | \"Episode 7\"\n| 27 July 2008\n| 1.322\n| #6\n|\n|-\n| style=\"width:05%;\"| 8\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | \"Grand Final\"\n| 3 August 2008\n| 1.377\n| #4\n|\n|}\nSee also\n* List of Australian television series\n* Last Choir Standing\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
