It was named after George V, the King-Emperor. Morarji Desai, then Union Finance minister of India, laid the foundation stone on 3 February 1962 to commemorate the name change.\nThe former name of the park leds name to King's Circle station of Harbour line of Mumbai suburban railway. The area surrounding park is still called Kings Circle by locals.\nThe part of the road that leads to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus was formerly called Vincent Road. It was changed to Dr. Ambedkar Road almost 45 years ago. King's Circle station and Matunga railway station are next to each other, the former on the Harbour and the latter on the Central line.\nLocated very close to King's Circle station is South Indian Education Society High School, one of Mumbai's oldest schools. King's Circle is also central to places such as Koliwada, Wadala or Vadala, Sion, Dadar and C.G.S. Colony (Antop Hill); and is a location for real estate and business due to its central location and higher prices.\nFor several decades, Matunga and Sion were the roads terminal points. Beyond them was a marshy, unsuitable land mass, for habitation. All construction was taking place in South Mumbai. Land was reclaimed from the sea and made available for building sites.\nMaheshwari Udyan is on the road. It passes through various flyovers reaching Thane Depot. From this Udyan, one can go by walk to western part of Matunga. The Railway workshop one small length bylane foot bridge, (Local folks call this lane 'Monkey bridge') which connects Matunga East to Matunga west.\nFile:B 008 Maheshwari udayn.JPG|Prior to flyover construction\nFile:B 013 Maheshwari udyan.JPG|Maheshwari Udyan\nFile:007 Newly built Flyover.JPG|A flyover connecting CST to Thane Pass through the Maheshwari Udyan (2012)\nFile:004 Tall trees.JPG|Garden\nReferences"
