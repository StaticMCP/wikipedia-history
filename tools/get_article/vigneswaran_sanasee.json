He also served as 17th President of the Dewan Negara from April 2016 to June 2020, Senator from June 2014 to June 2020 and the Member of Parliament (MP)  for Kota Raja from March 2004 to March 2008.\nVigneswaran is the son of the late Sanasee Thevar, JP, a former MIC parliament member in the 1980s. His cousin, Sellathevan, is a former MIC Youth leader and a Member of Parliament in 90's. His family belonged to an influential Kallar (Thevar) family and has business interests in the Port Klang area.\nVigneswaran contested and won the 2004 general election to become Member of Parliament for Kota Raja parliamentary seat from 2004 to 2008. He lost and failed to retain the seat in the 2008 general election.\nPolitical career\nPresident of the Malaysian Indian Congress (since 2018)\nOn 27 March 2024, Vigneswaran submitted his nomination papers to contest for reelection to the MIC party presidency for the third term in the party elections. It was later confirmed that he had been reelected as president by a walkover after nobody had decided to challenge him for the position.\nControversies\nVigneswaran was alleged to have violated the dress code by wearing sandals and to have breached the security regulations by encroaching into the VIP lobby area before heading to the departure gates to send off his daughter to Britain without going through proper security check and without a security pass at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) on 14 November 2018. Transport Minister Anthony Loke Siew Fook had showed a CCTV footage of the incident and told Vigneswaran to apologise for it during a press conference on 17 November 2018. Vigneswaran denies he breached KLIA security protocols and claims that he wore sandals as he had wound on his foot. Police will investigate the incident as the airport management had filed a police report.\nElection results\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\"\n|+ Parliament of Malaysia\n!|Year\n!|Constituency\n!colspan=2|Candidate\n!|Votes\n!|Pct\n!colspan=2|Opponent(s)\n!|Votes\n!|Pct\n!|Ballots cast\n!|Majority\n!|Turnout\n|-\n| rowspan=2|2004\n| rowspan=3|P111 Kota Raja\n| rowspan=2  |\n| rowspan=2| (MIC)\n| rowspan=2 align=\"right\" |24,376\n| rowspan=2|55.24%\n| |\n| (PAS)\n|align=\"right\" |16,137\n|36.57%\n| rowspan=2|44,758\n| rowspan=2|8,239\n| rowspan=2|76.67%\n|-\n| |\n| (IND)\n|align=right|3,608\n|align=right|8.18%\n|-\n|2008\n| |\n|Vigneswaran Sanasee (MIC)\n|align=\"right\" |17,879\n|31.64%\n| |\n| (PAS)\n|align=\"right\" |38,630\n|68.36%\n|57,323\n|20,751\n|79.74%\n|-\n| rowspan=6|2022\n| rowspan=6|P062 Sungai Siput\n| rowspan=6  |\n| rowspan=6| (MIC)\n| rowspan=6 align=\"right\" |19,791\n| rowspan=6|38.32%\n|  |\n| (PKR)\n| align=\"right\" |21,637\n|41.89%\n| rowspan=6|51,649\n| rowspan=6|1,846\n| rowspan=6|71.34%\n|-\n| bgcolor= |\n|Irudhanathan Gabriel (BERSATU)\n| align=right|8,190\n|15.86%\n|-\n|bgcolor= |\n|Ahmad Fauzi Mohd Jaafar (PEJUANG)\n| align=right|784\n| align=right|1.52%\n|-\n| |\n|R.Indrani (IND)\n| align=right|614\n| align=right|1.19%\n|-\n| |\n|Baharudin Kamarudin  (IND)\n| align=right|598\n| align=right|1.16%\n|-\n| |\n|Rajah Narasaim (IND)\n| align=right|35\n| align=right|0.07%\n|}\nHonours\nHonours of Malaysia\n*\n**  Commander of the Order of Loyalty to the Crown of Malaysia (PSM) – Tan Sri (2017)\n**  Recipient of the 16th Yang di-Pertuan Agong Installation Medal (2019)\n*\n**  Companion Class II of the Exalted Order of Malacca (DPSM) – Datuk (2013)\n*\n**  Knight Grand Companion of the Order of Sultan Ahmad Shah of Pahang (SSAP) – '''Dato' Sri''' (2015)\n*\n**  Companion of the Order of the Crown of Selangor (SMS) (2005)\nSee also\n* List of people who have served in both Houses of the Malaysian Parliament\nReferences"
