He is currently the head coach for the Coppin State Eagles, his alma mater.\nStewart attended Coppin State University where he led his team to the 1990 NCAA Tournament, the first appearance in school history. Coppin State was a 15 seed and lost to Derrick Coleman's Syracuse squad 70–48 in the first round. After college, he signed as an undrafted free agent with the Washington Bullets in 1991. He averaged 10.4 points, and 5.9 rebounds in his rookie season (1991–92), and became the first undrafted player in NBA history to make an All-NBA Rookie Team (2nd). His last NBA season was in 1996–97 with the Seattle SuperSonics, where he would make his only appearance in the playoffs. He also played in Greece for Panellinios BC.

He was taken to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center for treatment. Neither injury was fatal nor permanently damaging. Police said the suspects broke in by shattering a sliding door in the back of the house. They pulled Stewart from his bed, bound his hands and feet and shot him. Although Stewart could not describe his assailants he asserted four men were involved.\nHis younger brother, Stephen, is an assistant basketball coach, while his other younger brother Lynard played professional basketball overseas.\nHead coaching record\n| confrecord   =\n}}\n| poll     =  no\n| polltype =  no\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/stewala01.html NBA stats] @ basketballreference.com\n* [http://www.truthaboutit.net/2008/08/whatever-happened-to-former-bullet.html Whatever Happened to Former Bullet Larry Stewart?] @ truthaboutit.net"
