Though Rambo: First Blood Part II won Worst Picture, Rocky IV (also starring Sylvester Stallone) received the greatest number of nominations (9) and \"wins\" (5). This is the only year in which one movie won worst picture and another movie had the most nominations and wins.\nGodzilla, nominated for Worst New Star (as \"The New Computerized Godzilla\") was the first fictional character to be nominated without mentioning or referencing the actor who plays him.\nAwards and nominations\nFile:Sylvester Stallone Cannes 2019.jpg|Sylvester Stallone, Worst Director and Worst Actor winner, Worst Screenplay co-winner.\nFile:Linda Blair 2018 cropped.jpeg|Linda Blair, Worst Actress winner.\nFile:Rob Lowe 2012 Shankbone 2.JPG|Rob Lowe, Worst Supporting Actor winner.\nFile:Brigitte Nielsen.jpg|Brigitte Nielsen, Worst Supporting Actress and Worst New Star winner.\nFile:James Cameron by Gage Skidmore.jpg|James Cameron, Worst Screenplay co-winner.\nFile:Frank Stallone (cropped).jpg|Frank Stallone, Worst Original Song co-winner.\nFile:Jerry Goldsmith 2.jpg|Jerry Goldsmith, Worst Original Song co-winner.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\" align=\"centre\"\n|-\n!
