The school is operated by the New York City Department of Education.\nAs of the 2014–15 school year, the school had an enrollment of 3,289 students and 149.2 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 22.0:1. There were 2,380 students (72.4% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 311 (9.5% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.\nThe mascot is the hawk (changed from the Brave, the original mascot chosen when the school opened in 1971) and the school colors are violet and gray.\nAthletics\nThe school's boys and girls' soccer team became division champions in the 06–07 and 07–08 season, guided by Coach Asqui and captain Joao Azevedo. The school is also notable for its rigorous baseball program, led by Coach Malave.\nHistory\nStephen M. Duch was the school principal from 1996 to the beginning of 2014. After his retirement, David T. Morrison, a graduate of Hillcrest who served as the AP of English for several years, became the new principal.\nIn 2002, Hillcrest was listed as the most violent high school in the city.\nOn November 20, 2023, several hundred Hillcrest students participated in a protest, with the goal of having a teacher fired for her participation in a rally supporting Israel. The teacher barricaded herself with the aid of fellow teachers, as they waited for the police to arrive.\nAn NBC News article about the November 20 incident stated, \"In another incident at the same school a week before that, students attacked a uniformed school safety officer, police said. The students responsible for the attack were taken into custody and charged, the NYPD shared on X, though their names were not immediately released and it was not known what charges they face. It also was not immediately clear whether the incidents were related, officials said. Elected officials sounded off on what occurred at the school, and how the administration handled the situation.\"\nNotable alumni\nThis is a partial list of notable alumni of Hillcrest High School.\n* Fran Drescher (Class of 1975), actress, best known for her role on The Nanny.
