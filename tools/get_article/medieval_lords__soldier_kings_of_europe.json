Taking on the role of an immortal advisor to such figures as a king, sultan, or other leader, players work to conquer and form alliances with other regions and manage major events like the plague, religious uprisings, and failing economies. The game covers Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.\nDevelopment\nComputer Gaming World included some of the formulae used in the game logic, provided by the game's designer Martin Campion.\nReception\nChuck Moss reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \"Medieval Lords is an entertaining and challenging computer game, despite — or, perhaps, because of — its limitations.\"\nJanice Greaves for Run said that \"Medieval Lords is well suited to solitaire, multi-player and classroom use.\"\nJim Trunzo reviewed Medieval Lords: Soldier Kings of Europe in White Wolf #29 (Oct./Nov., 1991), rating it a 3 out of 5 and stated that \"For those who are deep thinkers and love to play simulations that are grand in scale, Medieval Lords will challenge you game after game. There's great satisfaction in watching the map of Europe turn into your empire's color block by block.\"\nReferences"
