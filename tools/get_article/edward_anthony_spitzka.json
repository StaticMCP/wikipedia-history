(In 1881, his father Edward Charles Spitzka, a famous neurologist and medical specialist in mental diseases, testified to the insanity of Charles Guiteau, the assassin of President James A. Garfield, at Guiteau's murder trial.)\nDr. Edward Anthony Spitzka was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1908. He was the author of 40 papers on brain anatomy. Widely recognized as one of the world's leading brain anatomists, he directed the Baugh Institute of Anatomy until 1914. Dr. Spitzka performed post mortem examinations of the brains of many distinguished American men, including Prof. Edward Drinker Cope, Prof. Joseph Leidy, Prof. Harrison Allen, Dr. William Pepper, George Francis Train, and Major John Wesley Powell.\nPublications\n*Co-edited (with J.C.
