      "text": "# Timeline of Occupy Oakland\n\nThe following is a timeline of Occupy Oakland (sometimes called OO or #OO) which began on Monday, October 10, 2011, as an occupation of Frank H. Ogawa Plaza located in front of Oakland City Hall in downtown Oakland, and is an ongoing demonstration. It is allied with Occupy Wall Street, which began in New York City on September 17, 2011, and is one of several \"Occupy\" protest sites in the San Francisco Bay Area. Other sites include Occupy San Francisco and Occupy San Jose.\nOccupy Oakland was inspired by the Occupy movement, which in turn was inspired by the Arab Spring and Greek, Spanish, British, Chilean, and Israeli protest movements. A precursor in the United States was the 2011 Wisconsin protests occurring from late winter through the spring. More specific to Oakland, OO was inspired by local protest history, including protests in response to the BART Police shooting of Oscar Grant in 20092010.\nFirst occupation\n* October 10, 2011&nbsp;– Occupy Oakland began at 4 p.m. with a rally attended by hundreds of supporters, held in tandem with Indigenous People's Day, both as a statement of solidarity and an expression that this action firmly situated itself against colonialism and nation states.
