The Cougars, led by sixth-year head coach Lennox Forrester, played their home games at the Vadalabene Center and were members of the West Division of the Ohio Valley Conference. This was the first season in which SIU Edwardsville was an eligible member to play in the Ohio Valley Tournament.\nPreseason\nTen players returned from the 10–17 team of 2011–12, and two transfers were newly eligible.\nThe OVC's pre-season coaches' poll picked SIUE to finish fourth in the West Division.   Senior Mark Yelovich was selected to the pre-season All-OVC team.\nSeason\nDuring the season, crucial team members Reggie Reed, Maurice Wiltz, and Mark Yelovich suffered injuries, and late in the season, leading scorer Jerome Jones was suspended for the duration.  As a result, the Cougars foundered, ending the season 9–18 and 5–11 in OVC play to finish in a tie for fourth place in the West Division. They failed to qualify for the Ohio Valley Conference tournament.\nRoster\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n! #\n! Name\n! Position\n! Height\n! Weight\n! Year\n! Hometown\n!
