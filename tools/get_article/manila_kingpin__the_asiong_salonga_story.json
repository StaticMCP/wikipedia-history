Rillo, Carla Abellana, Phillip Salvador, John Regala, Ronnie Lazaro, Baron Geisler, Joko Diaz, Archie Adamos, Yul Servo, Dennis Padilla, and Ketchup Eusebio. Produced by Scenema Concept International, it was released by Viva Films as an entry to the 37th Metro Manila Film Festival, where it won 11 awards, including for Best Picture, Best Director (dela Cruz), and Best Actor (Estregan).\nAguiluz disowned the film before release after the film was reedited by the producers without his permission.\nPlot\nManila Kingpin is based on the story of the notorious Tondo, Manila, gang leader Nicasio \"Asiong\" Salonga whose true-to-life accounts had been portrayed in several movie versions since 1961 (starring Joseph Estrada). It is also the first Filipino major film produced in black-and-white in the 21st century as well as the returning action genre movie.\nManila Kingpin is the replacing entry to the original projects Mr. Wong (starring Robin Padilla) and Hototay (Regal Films, starring Nora Aunor), after the latter two had backed out from the event.\nCast\n*Jeorge \"E.R.\" Estregan as Nicasio \"Asiong\" Salonga\n*Carla Abellana as Fidela Fernandez-Salonga\n*Phillip Salvador as Sgt.
