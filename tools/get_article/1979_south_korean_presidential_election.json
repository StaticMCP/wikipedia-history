The members of the National Conference for Unification, who among other things, were responsible for election of president, choose Prime Minister Choi Kyu-hah as the President of the Republic of Korea unopposed; Choi had been acting President since Park's death.\nPresident Choi was supposed to serve for the remainder of late President Park's term, which would have ended in 1984. However, a coup d'état took place six days after the elections, with Chun Doo-hwan seizing power. He allowed Choi to remain in power for eight months, before being elected president in August 1980.\nResults\nIn order to be elected, a candidate had to receive the vote of over 50% of the incumbent members of the National Conference for Unification. With 2,560 delegates present, Choi had to receive at least 1,281 votes to be elected. He received 2,465 votes, 96% of the total possible.\nElectors by province and city\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n!Province/City\n! style=\"width:60px; \" |Turnout\n!%\n! style=\"width:60px; \" |Electors\n! style=\"width:60px; \" |Vacant\n! style=\"width:60px; \" |Total\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Seoul\n|388\n|99.49\n|390\n|1\n|391\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Busan\n|144\n|99.31\n|145\n|0\n|145\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Gyeonggi\n|318\n|100\n|318\n|1\n|319\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Gangwon\n|148\n|98.67\n|150\n|1\n|151\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |North Chungcheong\n|130\n|100\n|130\n|1\n|131\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |South Chungcheong\n|232\n|100\n|232\n|3\n|235\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |North Jeolla\n|200\n|99.01\n|202\n|1\n|203\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |South Jeolla\n|309\n|99.36\n|311\n|1\n|312\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |North Gyeongsang\n|369\n|99.46\n|371\n|8\n|379\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |South Gyeongsang\n|284\n|100\n|284\n|6\n|290\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Jeju\n|27\n|100\n|27\n|0\n|27\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| align=\"left\" |Total\n|2,549\n|99.57\n|2,560\n|23\n|2,583\n|}\nReferences"
