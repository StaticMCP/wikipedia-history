The awards were initiated by Marjan Firouz in 2009. Each year the ceremony constitutes a prestigious event in the center of Vienna, hosted by major television stars from Germany and Austria such as Sonya Kraus, with performances of up-coming singers such as Nevena Tsoneva. The winners of the international categories Style Icon and Global Citizen are invited to participate as honorary guests of the ceremony. There are also other stars coming to Vienna to participate.\nSelection, campaign\nThe winners are selected according to the structure developed by the Academy Awards. The winners of the previous three years select the winner of this year. There are only exceptions for the categories Best Designer, Tribute to Fashion & Lifestyle, Best Model and Style Icon who are selected by a committee.\nSince 2011 the event is promoted every year with a theme campaign closely related to the city of Vienna and its history. In 2011, this fashion shooting was dedicated to the landmark Riesenrad and in 2012 to the beloved St. Stephen's Cathedral. In 2013, Emma Heming-Willis was invited to star as Empress Elisabeth of Austria. In 2014, Jerry Hall performed as a modern Queen of the Night from Mozarts  The Magic Flute.\nAwards 2009–14\n{| border=\"0\" style=\"border: 1px solid #999; background-color:#FFFFFF; text-align:center\"\n|-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n! !! 2009 !! 2010 !! 2011|| 2012||2013 || 2014\n|-bgcolor=\"#EFEFEF\"\n| align=\"left\"| Designer || Petar Petrov || Thomas Kirchgrabner || Claudia Brandmair || Lena Hoschek|| Meshit || Eva Poleschinski\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| Make up Artist || Oliver Szilagyi || Thomas Orsolis || Thomas Lorenz || Sergej Benedetter || Nicole Jaritz  || Thomas Lorenz\n|-bgcolor=\"#EFEFEF\"\n| align=\"left\"| Tribut to Fashion & Lifestyle || Palmers || Ludwig Reiter || Silhouette || Tostmann Trachten || Swarovski  || Porsche Design\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  Photographer || Andreas Bitesnich || Günter Parth || Jork Weismann || Mario Schmolka || Stefan Armbruster  || Julia Spicker\n|-bgcolor=\"#EFEFEF\"\n|align=\"left\"|  Fashion Editor  || Petra Percher || Kira Stachowitsch || Stephan Hilpold || Margit Kratky || Daniel Kalt  || Klaus Peter Vollmann\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  Stylist || Sammy Zayed || Sabina Schreder || Yoan Gonfond || Barbara Zach || Adia Trischler  || Felix Leblhuber\n|-bgcolor=\"#EFEFEF\"\n|align=\"left\"|  Designer Branding || Lena Hoschek || Wendy & Jim || Gebrüder Stitch|| AND i || –  || –\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  Accessoire Designer || – || AND i || Nina Peter ||  Andy Wolf || Ring King  || Bradaric Ohmae\n|-bgcolor=\"#EFEFEF\"\n|align=\"left\"|  Model || Franziska Knuppe || Iris Strubegger || Patrick Kafka|| Ilvie Wittek || Gerhard Freidl  || Florian Luger\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  Hair Stylist || Propaganda || Wolfgang Lindenhofer || Alex Moser || Patrick Glatthaar || Wolfgang Lindenhofer || –\n|-bgcolor=\"#EFEFEF\"\n|align=\"left\"|  Style Icon || Adriana Karembeu || Kiera Chaplin || Tatjana Patitz|| Karolina Kurkova || Bar Refaeli || Coco Rocha\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  Global Citizen ||- ||- ||- ||- || Atil Kutoglu || –\n|}\nSee also\n* List of fashion awards\nReferences"
