Thus, it is ineligible to elect members of the Electoral College, who would then in turn cast direct electoral votes for president and for vice president. To draw attention to this fact, the territory conducts a non-binding presidential straw poll during the general election as if they did elect members to the Electoral College.\nThe territory still participated in the U.S. presidential caucuses and primaries like the other states and territories.\nDemocratic Party nominee Joe Biden won the poll with 55% of the vote.\nResults\nThough the votes of Guam residents do not count in the November general election, the territory nonetheless conducts a presidential straw poll to gauge islanders' preference for president every election year. The poll has been held in Guam during every presidential election since 1980.}}\n16.24\n}}\n17.75\n}}\nSee also\n* 2020 United States presidential election\n* 2020 Guam presidential caucuses\nReferences"
