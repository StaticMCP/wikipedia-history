Jefferson did, however, win all three electoral votes.\nTennessee used an electoral district system to choose its electors, with each district electing a single elector. This is similar to the way Nebraska and Maine choose their electors in modern elections.\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Tennessee\nReferences"
