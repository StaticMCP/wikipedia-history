It was broadcast on Disney Channel, DisneyNow and Radio Disney at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. (EDT). The event was hosted by actress and singer Sofia Carson. It was the final edition of the award before Radio Disney was shut down in April 2021. No awards ceremony was held in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, although a pre-recorded \"ARDYs Summer Playlist\" special aired on Disney Channel that year.\nPerformances\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n!
