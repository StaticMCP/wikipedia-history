Established on September 29, 1899, in Columbus, Ohio, the VFW is headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri. It was federally chartered in 1936.\nHistory\npostage stamp (1974)]]\nThe VFW resulted from the amalgamation of several societies formed immediately following the Spanish–American War. In 1899, little groups of veterans returning from campaigning in Cuba and the Philippine Islands, founded local societies upon a spirit of comradeship known only to those who faced the dangers of that war side by side. Similar experiences and a common language drew them together. The American Veterans of Foreign Service (predecessor to the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States) was established in Columbus, Ohio, September 29, 1899, by Spanish‑American War veteran James C. Putnam. The Colorado Society, Army of the Philippines, was organized in Denver, Colorado, on December 12, 1899, by General Irving Hale of Denver, Colorado. Shortly thereafter, a society known as the Foreign Service Veterans was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in October 1901. The Ohio-based group and the Pittsburgh-based group held a joint convention in 1905, where the two groups merged.  Merging the final two groups was talked about as early as 1908 but was not accomplished until 1913. In August 1913 an encampment was held in Denver and they merged their interests and identities in a national organization now known as the VFW.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of the VFW is to speed rehabilitation of the nation's disabled and needy veterans, assist veterans' widows and orphans and the dependents of needy or disabled veterans, and promote Americanism by means of education in patriotism and by constructive service to local communities. The organization maintains both its legislative service and central office of its national rehabilitation service in Washington, D.C. The latter nationwide program serves disabled veterans of all wars, members and nonmembers alike, in matters of government compensation and pension claims, hospitalization, civil-service employment preference, etc.\"\nLogo\nRedesigned in November 2018, the official logo of the VFW includes an artistic representation of service stripes, easily recognizable insignia indicative of military service. Worn on most service uniforms, they denote length of service. As such, the first and leaner of the two service stripes represents the VFW's entry into its second century of service to America's veterans, service members and their families. The second, broader stripe represents its first century of service, spanning back to 1899.\nGreat Seal\nThe Cross of Malta is the VFW's official emblem. The cross, radiating rays, and Great Seal of the United States together symbolize the character, vows and purposes distinguishing VFW as an order of warriors who have traveled far from home to defend sacred principles. Its eight points represent the beatitudes prescribed in the Sermon on the Mount: Blessed are the poor in spirit, the meek, the pure, the merciful, the peacemakers; blessed are they who mourn, seek righteousness and are persecuted for righteousness' sake. The eight-pointed Cross of Malta harks back to the Crusades, launched during the 12th century.\nEligibility\nMembership in the VFW is restricted to any active or honorably discharged officer or enlisted person who is a citizen of the United States and who has served in its armed forces \"in any foreign war, insurrection or expedition, which service shall be recognized by the authorization or the issuance of a United States military campaign medal.\"\nThe following is a list of U.S. campaign medals, ribbons, and badges used by the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States to determine membership eligibility.\n{| class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"margin:1.5em auto; text-align:center; width:60%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" style=\"background:darkGrey;\" |Eligibility guide\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#c5d2ea; text-align:center;\"\n| Campaign medal\n| Start date\n| End date\n|- style=\"text-align:left;\"\n| Navy Expeditionary\n| February 12, 1874\n| Open\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Marine Corps Expeditionary\n| February 12, 1874\n| Open\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Spanish Campaign\n| April 20, 1898\n| December 10, 1898\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Army of Cuban Occupation\n| July 18, 1898\n| May 20, 1902\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Army of Puerto Rican Occupation\n| August 14, 1898\n| December 10, 1898\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Philippine Campaign\n| February 4, 1899\n| December 31, 1913\n|- align=\"left\"\n| China Relief Expedition\n| April 5, 1900\n| May 27, 1901\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Cuban Pacification\n| September 12, 1906\n| April 1, 1909\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Mexican Service\n| April 12, 1911\n| June 16, 1919\n|- align=\"left\"\n| First Nicaraguan Campaign\n| July 29, 1912\n| November 14, 1912\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Haitian Campaign\n| April 9, 1915\n| June 15, 1920\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Dominican Campaign\n| May 4, 1916\n| December 5, 1916\n|- align=\"left\"\n| World War I Victory (with battle or service clasp – including Siberia and European Russia)\n| April 6, 1917\n| April 1, 1920\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Army of Occupation of Germany\n| November 12, 1918\n| July 11, 1923\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Second Nicaraguan Campaign\n| August 27, 1926\n| January 2, 1933\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Yangtze Service\n| September 3, 1926\n| December 31, 1932\n|- align=\"left\"\n| China Service\n| July 7, 1937\n| April 1, 1957\n|- align=\"left\"\n| American Defense Service (with foreign service clasp)\n| September 8, 1939\n| December 7, 1941\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Combat Infantryman Badge\n| December 6, 1941\n| Open\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Combat Medical Badge\n| December 6, 1941\n| Open\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Navy Combat Action\n| December 6, 1941\n| Open\n|- align=\"left\"\n| European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign\n| December 7, 1941\n| November 8, 1945\n|- align=\"left\"\n| American Campaign (30 consecutive or 60 non-consecutive days of duty outside continental limits of the U.S.)\n| December 7, 1941\n| March 2, 1946\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Asiatic–Pacific Campaign\n| December 7, 1941\n| March 2, 1946\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Navy Occupation Service\n| May 8, 1945\n| October 25, 1955\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Army of Occupation (30 consecutive days of duty)\n| May 9, 1945\n| October 2, 1990\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Korean Service\n| June 27, 1950\n| July 27, 1954\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Korea Defense Service\n| July 28, 1954\n| Open\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Vietnam Service\n| July 1, 1958\n| April 30, 1975\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Armed Forces Expeditionary\n| July 1, 1958\n| Open\n|- align=\"left\"\n|  SSBN Deterrent Patrol insignia, in silver and gold\n| January 21, 1961\n| Open\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Coast Guard Combat Action\n| May 1, 1975\n| Open\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Southwest Asia Service\n| August 2, 1990\n| November 30, 1995\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Air Force Expeditionary Service (with gold border)\n| October 1, 1999\n| Open\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Kosovo Campaign\n| March 24, 1999\n| December 31, 2013\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary\n| September 11, 2001\n| Open\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Afghanistan Campaign\n| September 11, 2001\n| August 31, 2021\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Air Force Combat Action\n| September 11, 2001\n| Open\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Combat Action Badge\n| September 18, 2001\n| Open\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Iraq Campaign\n| March 19, 2003\n| December 31, 2011\n|- align=\"left\"\n| Inherent Resolve Campaign\n| June 15, 2014\n| Open\n|}\n|-\n|}\nRefusal to admit WWII Japanese American veterans\nDespite their distinguished record, many posts and departments refused Japanese-American veterans entry into the VFW. In Chicago, white officers from the 442nd RCT advocated for a group's charter to form a segregated American Legion post in 1946. In Sacramento, California, another group found Alva Fleming, a sympathetic member in VFW district leadership who approved the charter of Nisei VFW Post 8985 on 7 February 1947. Fleming would go on to become State Commander for the Department of California, and considered to be the driving force in the founding of a total of 14 Nisei VFW posts throughout California, posts 8985 in Sacramento, Monterey post 1629, Gardena post 1961, Garden Grove post 3670, San Fernando post 4140, San Diego post 4851, Hanford post 5869, Oceanside post 6945, Fresno post 8499, Watsonville post 9446, San Francisco post 9879, East Los Angeles post 9902, Los Angeles post 9938, and San Jose post 9970, all still active today. Nisei veterans in the Pacific Northwest were not so lucky, unable to find anyone willing to do the same there despite letters of support from Colonel Virgil R. Miller and General Lucian Truscott. Although VFW national commanders Jean Brunner and Joseph Stack condemned the actions of local posts, their bylaws at the time promoted autonomy in individual posts and were powerless to prevent the discrimination. They could only offer them membership as members-at-large. Unwilling to be treated as a second class members, the PNW Nisei decided to form their own independent veterans organization when neither the VFW or the American Legion would accept them as members nor grant them charters for a segregated post.\nVietnam veterans membership controversy\nThe VFW initially refused membership for Vietnam War veterans. At the time, most incumbent VFW members were World War II and Korean War veterans. Many of these WWII veterans were of the opinion that the conflict in Vietnam was a \"police action\" and in their minds did not qualify as a war, despite the Korean War also being a \"police action\" with no formal declaration of war. This rationale was used to deny membership to many Vietnam War veterans across the country. Many of these WWII veterans blamed Vietnam War veterans for losing the war. In the years since, many veterans of the Vietnam War have refused to join the VFW due to this, and many older posts now find themselves struggling to survive as WWII and Korea vets have either died or are no longer active, and younger Iraq and Afghanistan veterans do not feel comfortable joining a dying post.\nMembership and structure\nThe VFW attained a peak membership of 2.1 million between 1991-1993. In 2023, the VFW had 957,000 members. In 2024, the VFW combined auxiliary members into their membership totals and membership including the auxiliary stands at 1.4 million located at 5,500+ posts worldwide.\nSupport and assistance programs\nThe VFW offers a wide range of assistance programs aimed at helping veterans of every generation. This includes providing free, professional help filing or appealing a VA claim, offering scholarships for post-secondary education or providing emergency financial relief.\nVA claims and separation assistance\nThe VFW's National Veterans Service program consists of a nationwide network of VA accredited service officers and pre-discharge representatives who are experts in dealing with the VA and are the key to your success. The VA reports veterans represented by the VFW have recouped $8.3&nbsp;billion in earned benefits, including $1.4&nbsp;billion in new claims in 2018 alone.\nPre-discharge\nWith offices located on or near major military installations across the country, VFW Pre-Discharge representatives guide military personnel through the veterans claims process and conduct physical examinations prior to their separation from active duty. They are also ready to answer questions about education and medical benefits, as well as VA home loans.\nStudent veteran support\nM60 Main Battle Tank on display in front of , Veterans of Foreign Wars, at Ypsilanti, Michigan (2010)]]\nHelp A Hero Scholarship\nEstablished in 2014, the VFW's Help A Hero Scholarship provides service members and veterans with financial assistance they need to complete their educational goals without incurring excessive U.S. student loan debt.\n1 Student Veteran\nTo help ensure student veterans receive their benefits in a timely manner and have a place to turn to if they need help, the VFW, in conjunction with the Student Veterans of America (SVA), have developed the 1 Student Veteran program. 1 Student Veteran offers direct assistance to student veterans who have questions or are experiencing problems accessing their VA benefits.\nVFW-SVA Legislative Fellowship\nThe VFW-SVA Legislative Fellowship grants ten exemplary student veterans (fellows) the chance to join the VFW legislative team on Capitol Hill during the VFW Legislative Conference. The fellows will walk the halls of Congress, educating their legislators on the issues facing today's student veterans and have the opportunity to meet with policy-makers from federal agencies responsible for implementing veterans' policy.\nVeterans and Military Support Programs\nThe VFW's Veterans & Military Support Programs is the umbrella for three successful, long-standing programs; Operation Uplink, Unmet Needs, and the Military Assistance Program (MAP). These initiatives focus on troop support.\nMilitary Assistance Program\nMAP is the link between the VFW and the community. MAP is designed to promote VFW interaction within the local military community through the Adopt-A-Unit Program. MAP Grants are available to posts, districts, and departments who participate in a variety of morale boosting functions such as farewell and welcome home events.\nOperation Uplink\nOperation Uplink keeps military members in contact with their loved ones by allowing deployed troops to call home at no charge from MWR internet cafés in Afghanistan, Kuwait and other locations all around the world. Operation Uplink also distributes \"virtual pins\" which enable wounded warriors and veterans in Veterans Affairs facilities to call from home at no cost.\nUnmet Needs\nUnmet Needs assists military service members and their families who run into unexpected financial difficulties as a result of deployment or other hardships directly related to military service. Assistance is in the form of a grant of up to . Unmet Needs assists with basic life needs such as: mortgage and rent, home and auto repairs, insurance, utilities, food and clothing.\nPrograms\nThe VFW promotes civic responsibility, patriotism, and supports youth and local programs in communities across America.\nVoice of Democracy\nlogo]]\nEach year, nearly 40,000 high school students from across the country enter to win a share of the  in educational scholarships and incentives awarded through the VFW's Voice of Democracy audio-essay competition. The national first-place winner receives a $30,000 scholarship.\nPatriot's Pen\nPatriot's Pen challenges students from grades 6-8, to enter to win one of 46 national awards totaling , as well as $5,000 and an all-expense-paid trip to Washington, D.C. for the national first-place winner. Students draft a 300-400-word essay, expressing their views based on a patriotic, annual theme chosen by the VFW Commander in Chief.\nScout of the Year\nScout of the Year selects three young people – of the Boy or Girl Scouts, Sea Scouts or Venturing Crew – who have demonstrated practical citizenship in school, scouting and the community. The first-place winner receives a  award, the second-place winner receives a  award and the third-place winner receives .\nTeacher of the Year\nTeacher of the Year recognizes three exceptional teachers for their outstanding commitment to teach Americanism and patriotism to their students. The VFW recognizes the nation's top classroom elementary, junior high and high school teachers who teach citizenship education topics – at least half of the school day in a classroom environment – and promote America's history, traditions and institutions effectively.\nCommunity service\nThe VFW host events across America, as well as giving grants and helping at large-scale volunteer events.\nPublications\nThe VFW has published the monthly VFW Magazine since January 1951. It was known as Foreign Service from 1914 to 50.\nNotable commanders\nNotable national commanders of the Veterans of Foreign Wars have included:\n*Lyall T. Beggs\n*Robert Coontz\n*Thomas S.
