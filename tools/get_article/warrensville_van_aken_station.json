It is the eastern terminus of the Blue Line. Unlike most of the stations in Shaker Heights, Warrensville窶天an Aken is located off street, not in the median of Van Aken Boulevard. It is located in a block surrounded by Chagrin Boulevard (U.S. Route 422), Van Aken Boulevard, and Northfield Road (Ohio State Route 8) and Tuttle Road in the midst of a dense retail/commercial area. The station is located one block west of Warrensville Center Road, after which it named.\nHistory\nThe station opened when the Van Aken line was extended east from Lynnfield Road. The extension opened on July 30, 1930 at the same time that trains began using Cleveland Union Terminal. The station originally included a car yard with a reverse U loop for turning cars around. A passenger station building was constructed within the loop in 1932. However, because of the need to generate income, the building was never used as a passenger station but was leased for use as a Texaco service station. In 1948, the reverse U loop was replaced by a regular turnaround loop.\nIn 1980 and 1981, the Green and Blue Lines were completely renovated with new track, ballast, poles and wiring, and new stations were built along the line. The Warrensville station was rebuilt with a new platforms, a new car yard and a new power substation. The renovated line along Van Aken Boulevard opened on October 30, 1981.\nThe car yard was not needed after RTA opened its Central Rail Maintenance Facility on April 29, 1984 at East 55th Street. The loop was closed after RTA ended its use of PCC cars and relied completely upon the LRVs that comprise the current fleet.\nThere have been several proposals to extend the Blue Line beyond Warrensville station. The proposal most recently considered would be a  extension into and around the  Chagrin Highlands development near Harvard Road and I-271. The proposed route would travel along Northfield Road south, and then turns east along Mill Creek Pond Dr., traveling parallel to Harvard Road. The line would terminate somewhere between Richmond and Green Roads.\nStation layout\nThe station has a single island platform with a few small shelters along with a pair of ramps to allow passengers with disabilities to access trains.\nNotable places nearby\n* The Van Aken District (retail, restaurant, offices)\n* Tower East\n* Canterbury Golf Club\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.riderta.com/facilities/warrensvillevanaken Warrensville窶天an Aken Rapid Station (GCRTA)]"
