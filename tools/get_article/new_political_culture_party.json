The party also supports independent media and the unification of the Republic of Artsakh with Armenia. Ani Zakharyan advocates for advancing women's rights and allowing women to serve in the military, but opposes abortion rights.\nActivities\nIn January 2014, the party criticized the Prosperous Armenia party for failing to make any real political change in the country.\nPrior to the 2017 Armenian parliamentary election, the party announced its support and endorsement of the Republican Party of Armenia.\nIn October 2019, Ani Zakharyan was collecting signatures from the public in central Yerevan, in an attempt to be appointed Prime Minister.\nDuring the 2020–2021 Armenian protests, the party called for Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan to resign. In June 2021, Ani Zakharyan proposed for herself to be nominated as President.\nSee also\n*Programs of political parties in Armenia\nReferences"
