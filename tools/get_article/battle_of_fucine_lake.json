Lucius Porcius Cato was the leader of the Roman army at this battle.  The consul Porcius Cato was defeated and killed while storming a Marsic camp in winter or early spring.\nA slingshot from the presumed battlefield with an inscription in the Venetic language that mentions a Floro Decio attests the presence of Venetic troops at this battle.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Battle of fucine lake\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Fucine Lake"
