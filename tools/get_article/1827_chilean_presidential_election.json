The Congress elected Freire as the new president with 37 votes, and Francisco Antonio Pinto as vice president with 27 votes, from a total of 48 deputies present. Congress knew Freire would resign after Pinto's arrival in Santiago, so the election was only a sign of appreciation towards him.\nPinto's election, although won with a scant majority, signified a great victory for the liberals.\nResults\nPresident\n}}\nVice President\n}}\nReferences"
