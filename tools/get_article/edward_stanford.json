He became a partner to Saunders in 1852 at the age of 25. In 1853, the company was dissolved, and Stanford took over the remains of the business with the intent of turning it into a map specialist. With British colonial expansion pushing the demand for maps worldwide, and being the sole specialist of maps in London, the move was both obvious and lucrative.\nThe name Stanfords became prominent in 1862 when his project to make the most accurate map of London possible was published. Stanford's Library Map of London is still on sale today, over 150 years later.\nCompany ownership remained in the family until 1947, when it was absorbed into George Philip & Son. However, in 2001 Stanfords separated from George Philip & Son and the name Stanfords is displayed on both stores and on many lines of maps and books produced by the company.\nSee also\n* ''Stanford's Guides (travel guide books)\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* .\n*[http://london1864.com Stanford’s Library Map Of London And Its Suburbs 1864, Showing All The Proposed Metropolitan Railways and Improvements.]\n*[https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b525022017 Stanford's map of Cyprus showing the administrative divisions and the identified ancient sites.]\n*[http://london1878.com Stanford's Geological Library Map Of London And Its Suburbs 1878.'']"
