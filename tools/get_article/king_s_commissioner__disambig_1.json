When the reigning monarch is a woman, the title is 'Queen's commissioner' (Commissaris van de Koningin'').\nA commissioner is appointed by the Dutch Crown as its official representative, and serves as the non-voting chair of the provincial legislature, the States-Provincial. They also serve as chair and full and voting member of the Provincial executive.\nBackground\nThe government of the Netherlands consist of the national institutions, the twelve provinces and the 342 municipalities. The three tiers are largely organised in the same way, with a directly elected legislature, which in turn elects the executive branch, that is headed by a chairperson appointed by the Dutch monarch and the Dutch crown respectively.\nThe provinces form the regional administration, between the national and municipal levels. They are responsible for issues such as spatial planning and health care, within the bounds prescribed by the national government. The provinces also oversee policy and finances of municipalities and other lesser authorities such as water boards.\nThe provincial legislature, called the States-Provincial or Provincial Council, are elected by direct popular vote every four years. The executive authority is exercised collectively by the College of the King's Commissioner and the Provincial executive. The latter is elected by, and are accountable to, the provincial council.\nAppointment\nThe King's Commissioner is appointed by the Dutch Crown, meaning the Council of Ministers of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, for a term of six years, renewable. An appointed commissioner can be dismissed only by the Crown.\nWhen a vacancy arises, the States Provincial express their preferences to the Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations, who, in turn, presents a candidate for appointment by the Council of Ministers.\nThe candidates are almost exclusively drawn from among prominent members of the major national political parties, but are expected to be politically impartial while exercising their office.\nResponsibilities\n* Head of provincial government, and highest representative of the province\n* official representative of the central government to the province\n* non-voting, impartial chair of the States-Provincial\n* oversight of the provincial administration and provincial utilities\n* chair and full, voting member of the Provincial council, with the possibility of holding their own political portfolio; common responsibilities include safety and public order\n* coordinator of public disaster management and prevention\n* part of the province's oversight of municipal policy and finances, by paying regular official visits to the municipalities of the provinces\n* upon a vacancy as mayor (burgmeester) in a municipality of the province, reception of the municipal council's expressed preferences of candidate, and, based on that expression, recommending a candidate to the Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations\nNaming practice in Limburg\nIn the Dutch province of Limburg, the King's Commissioner is informally referred to as Governor (Dutch: Gouverneur), drawing on the corresponding office in the bordering Belgian province of Limburg. Accordingly, the Province Hall (Provinciehuis) at Maastricht is thus often referred to as the Governor's Residence (Gouvernement).\nThis local custom arose from the particular status of the province in the nineteenth century. The official name of the office, however, is the King's Commissioner just as in the other Dutch provinces.\nList of current King's commissioners\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Province\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" |King's commissioner\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" |Party\n! scope=\"col\" | Serving since\n! scope=\"col\" | Previous office\n|-\n| Drenthe\n|\n! scope=\"row\" |   (born 1957)\n| style=\"background:;\"|\n| Labour Party\n|   ()\n| State Secretary for  Social Affairs  and Employment\n|-\n| Flevoland\n|\n! scope=\"row\" |  (born 1970)\n| style=\"background:;\"|\n| People's Party  for Freedom and  Democracy\n|   ()\n| Mayor of Almelo\n|-\n| Friesland\n|\n! scope=\"row\" |   (born 1968)\n| style=\"background:;\"|\n| People's Party  for Freedom and  Democracy\n|   ()\n| Mayor of Dordrecht\n|-\n| Gelderland\n|\n! scope=\"row\" |   (born 1969)\n| style=\"background:;\"|\n| Independent\n|   ()\n| Professor of Social psychology  Radboud University Nijmegen\n|-\n| Groningen\n|\n! scope=\"row\" |   (born 1966)\n| style=\"background:;\"|\n| Christian  Democratic Appeal\n|   ()\n| Member of the Social  and Economic Council\n|-\n| Limburg\n|\n! scope=\"row\" |   (born 1962)\n| style=\"background:;\"|\n| Socialist Party\n|   ()\n| Acting  Mayor of Alkmaar\n|-\n| North Brabant\n|\n! scope=\"row\" |   (born 1968)\n| style=\"background:;\"|\n| People's Party  for Freedom and  Democracy\n|   ()\n| Mayor of Lelystad\n|-\n| North Holland\n|\n! scope=\"row\" |   (born 1963)\n| style=\"background:;\"|\n| People's Party  for Freedom and  Democracy\n|   ()\n| Member of the Social  and Economic Council\n|-\n| Overijssel\n|\n! scope=\"row\" |   (born 1962)\n| style=\"background:;\"|\n| Christian Union\n|   ()\n| Mayor of Deventer\n|-\n| South Holland\n|\n! scope=\"row\" |   (born 1976)\n| style=\"background:;\"|\n| People's Party  for Freedom and  Democracy\n|   ()\n| Mayor of Dordrecht\n|-\n| Utrecht\n|\n! scope=\"row\" |   (born 1962)\n| style=\"background:;\"|\n| Labour Party\n|   ()\n| Dijkgraaf\n|-\n| Zeeland\n|\n! scope=\"row\" |   (born 1977)\n| style=\"background:;\"|\n| Christian  Democratic Appeal\n|   ()  Acting\n| Minister of the Interior  and Kingdom Relations\n|-\n|}\nSource:\nSee also\n* :Category:Lists of King's and Queen's commissioners in the Netherlands\n* Lord-lieutenant\nReferences"
