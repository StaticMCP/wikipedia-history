He was Temporary President and Majority Leader of the New York State Senate from 1973 to 1988.\nLife\nHe was born on October 16, 1915, in Bainbridge, Chenango County, New York, the son of Floyd E.

He served in the United States Army during World War II, attaining the rank of Second Lieutenant in the Judge Advocate General's Corps.\nFollowing the war he served as Assistant County Attorney for Broome County, and then joined the Binghamton law firm of Hinman, Howard & Kattell.\nA Republican, Anderson was a member of the New York State Senate from 1953 to 1989, sitting in the 169th, 170th, 171st, 172nd, 173rd, 174th, 175th, 176th, 177th, 178th, 179th, 180th, 181st, 182nd, 183rd, 184th, 185th, 186th and 187th New York State Legislatures.
