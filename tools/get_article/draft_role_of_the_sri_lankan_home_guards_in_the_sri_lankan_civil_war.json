The Home Guard system itself traces its origins to the early 1980s and was formalised into the National Home Guard Service in the mid-1980s under the Mobilisation and Supplementary Forces Act, No. 40 of 1985, which creates the legal framework for establishing and administering supplementary forces, reserves and other civil defence formations. Distinct Muslim Home Guard units were later established during 1990 in response to a wave of attacks on Muslim communities along the east coast; these units operated as lightly armed, village-based defence detachments often under local police oversight.\nIn 2006, the Home Guard system underwent a major reorganisation. Through a government gazette No. 1462/20 of 13 September 2006, the Home Guard Service was reorganised as the Civil Security Department (CSD) and placed within the Ministry of Defence, a move designed to regularise training, command structures and pay for the auxiliary force and to integrate it more closely with national security institutions.\nThe Muslim Home Guards were mainly stationed where tensions were rising, concentrating in areas where different groups coexisted or where control was constantly challenged. This situates the role of the Home Guards within the wider context of the Sri Lankan Civil War (1983–2009), which was marked by widespread violence with numerous massacres targeting Tamil civilians. These tragic events are part of a larger history of ethnic conflict between the Tamil minority and the Sinhala majority, exacerbated by the rise of the Tamil Tigers (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, LTTE), a separatist group seeking autonomy. The following sections outline some of the most significant massacres, providing a clearer picture of the brutality faced by the Tamil community during the war.\nDespite the severity and scale of the documented massacres involving Sri Lankan Home Guards, no investigations into the Massacres have ever been undertaken to hold the perpetrators accountable. Neither the Sri Lankan state nor its judicial system has pursued legal proceedings against members of the Home Guards alleged to have participated in attacks on Tamil civilians. Across multiple phases of Sri Lanka’s civil conflict, allegations involving actors aligned with the state have rarely turned into an investigation beyond initial reporting, resulting in a persistent gap between public reporting and judicial action. This absence of accountability has been noted as part of a broader, long-standing pattern of impunity.\nThe Sri Lankan Home Guards operated with official support, including arms and training provided by the Sri Lankan military, and frequently acted in coordination with state forces. This collaboration contributed to a series of massacres and systematic attacks on Tamil villages, particularly in the eastern districts; namely Trincomalee, Amparai, Batticaloa. Similar patterns of violence also emerged in Mullaitivu, in the Northern Province, also witnessed such violence where interethnic tensions between Tamils and Muslims had already been exacerbated by the war.\nAttacks in Chronological Order\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"font-size:100%; text-align:left;\"\n! width=\"225px\" scope=\"col\" |Attack\n! scope=\"col\" |Date\n! width=\"100px\" scope=\"col\" |Location\n! scope=\"col\" |Death Toll\n!Injuries, Vulnerable Victims & Property Damages\n! width=\"100px\" scope=\"col\" |Perpetrators\n! class=\"unsortable\" width=\"100px\" scope=\"col\" |References\n|-\n|Massacre of 18 Tamil fishermen\n| align=\"center\" |9 December 1984\n|Mullaitivu\n| align=\"right\" |18\n|\n|Sri Lankan Home Guards\n|\n|-\n|Othiyamalai massacre\n| align=\"center\" |2 December 1984\n|Othiyamalai, Mullaitivu\n| align=\"right\" |32\n|\n|Sri Lankan Army with the assistance of Sri Lankan Home Guards\n|\n|-\n|1985 Trincomalee massacres\n| align=\"center\" |May – September 1985\n|Several places in Trincomalee\n| align=\"right\" |280+\n|\n|Sri Lankan Army with the assistance of Sri Lankan Home Guards & Sri Lankan Navy\n|\n|-\n|Murugapuri massacre\n| align=\"center\" |8 September 1985\n|Murugapuri Trincomalee\n| align=\"right\" |3\n|\n|Sri Lankan Army with the assistance of Sri Lankan Home Guards\n|\n|-\n|Nilaveli massacre\n| align=\"center\" |16 September 1985\n|Nilaveli, Trincomalee\n| align=\"right\" |40\n|\n|Sri Lankan Army with the assistance of Sri Lankan Home Guards\n|\n|-\n|Kalvettu massacre\n| align=\"center\" |20 September 1985\n|Kalvettu, Ampara\n| align=\"right\" |15\n|10 injured\n|Sri Lankan Home Guards\n|\n|-\n|Anpuvalipuram Rd shooting\n| align=\"center\" |10 December 1985\n|Anpuvalipuram, Trincomalee\n| align=\"right\" |0\n|2 Tamil children injured and hospitalized\n|Sri Lankan Home Guards\n|\n|-\n|Rape and murder of 2 Tamil women in Muthur\n| align=\"center\" |25 December 1985\n|Muthur, Trincomalee\n| align=\"right\" |2\n|2 women raped\n|Sri Lankan Home Guards\n|\n|-\n|Akkaraipattu massacre\n| align=\"center\" |19 February 1986\n|Akkaraipattu, Amparai\n| align=\"right\" |80\n|5 women raped\n|Sri Lankan Army with the assistance of Sri Lankan Home Guards\n|\n|-\n|Seruvila massacre\n| align=\"center\" |12 June 1986\n|Seruvila, Trincomalee\n| align=\"right\" |21\n|2 aid workers Injured\n|Sri Lankan Home Guards\n|\n|-\n|1986 Thambalakamam massacre\n| align=\"center\" |28 June 1986\n|Thambalakamam, Trincomalee\n| align=\"right\" |34\n|\n|Sri Lankan Home Guards\n|\n|-\n|Mollipothana massacre\n| align=\"center\" |10 July 1986\n|Mollipothana, Trincomalee\n| align=\"right\" |11\n|\n|Sri Lankan Home Guards\n|\n|-\n|Sammanthurai massacre\n| align=\"center\" |10 June 1990\n|Sammanthurai, Amparai\n| align=\"right\" |37\n|\n|Sri Lankan Home Guards\n|\n|-\n|Veeramunai Massacres\n| align=\"center\" |20 June 1990 – 15 August 1990\n|Veeramunai, Amparai\n| align=\"right\" |250+\n|2,000 homes and a Hindu temple set on fire\n|Sri Lankan Home Guards\n|\n|-\n|Kalmunai massacre that occurred on July 10, 1990\n(Note: There are 6 Separate Instances of Kalmunai massacre from (1) 1985, (1) 1985, (4) 1990 so the Date is required in this field to Distinguish)\n| align=\"center\" |10 July 1990\n|Kalmunai, Amparai\n| align=\"right\" |31\n|\n|Sri Lankan Army with the assistance of Sri Lankan Home Guards\n|\n|-\n|Tiraikerny massacre\n| align=\"center\" |6 August 1990\n|Tiraikerny, Amparai\n| align=\"right\" |54+\n|Victims included women and children\n|Sri Lankan Home Guards\n|\n|-\n|Xavierpuram massacre\n| align=\"center\" |7 August 1990\n|Alikampai, Amparai\n| align=\"right\" |7\n|1 disappeared, 12 badly injured; houses, church and school burned\n|Sri Lankan Home Guards\n|\n|-\n|(Rev Fr.

Prior to the Kattankudy Mosque Massacre that occurred on 3 August 1990, 16 recorded attacks involving Home Guards targeted civilian populations. These incidents were part of the broader pattern of violence during the early stages of intensified conflict between Tamil militants and the Home Guards.\nOn 3 August 1990, an attack on two mosques in Kattankudy resulted in the deaths of over 100 Muslim worshippers. The massacre was widely attributed to the LTTE, though no public or judicial investigation has conclusively identified the perpetrators. According to UTHR, local testimonies collected in their Report 5, Chapter 2 (“A Bloody Stalemate”)  suggests that while there was widespread belief in LTTE involvement, there remained ambiguity amongst residents about who was actually responsible for the attack and its leadership. A civilian known locally as “Ranjith Appa” had been reportedly involved in the massacre, but the extent of his role is unclear. UTHR also observed that “no thought was given to concealment,” a detail interpreted by some as suggesting the attack may not have been centrally planned, or that the LTTE’s chain of command was loose in this instance.\nIn the aftermath of the Kattankudy incident, seven additional massacres involving Home Guards took place between August and September 1990; these appear to have been retaliatory in nature. Subsequently, in October 1990, the LTTE expelled the Muslim population from the Northern Province in an effort to prevent communal riots and consolidate territorial dominance. This mass displacement significantly strained Tamil-Muslim relations. Following this expulsion, only five more massacres involving Muslim Home Guards were documented over an eight-year period. This reduction in frequency may be attributed to shifts in territorial control during the conflict, particularly in areas previously contested between government and LTTE forces.\nMost of the massacres carried out by the Sri Lankan Home Guards were predominantly concentrated in the eastern districts, specifically in Trincomalee, Amparai, and Batticaloa. These three districts held strategic and significant economic value due to their agricultural productivity and access to coastal trade routes.  Alongside these eastern districts, Mullaitivu in the Northern Province also experienced significant violence, as it was a critical stronghold for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), making it a key target in the broader military efforts to weaken the separatist movement.\nIn these regions, Tamil populations often lived as minorities amongst Muslim communities. The combination of the Tamils' minority status and the regions’ strategic importance made these areas frequent sites of communal violence. Home Guards, operating in coordination with Sri Lankan state security forces (local police and army), are reported to have played a vital role in exacerbating tensions and conducting operations aimed at destabilizing and damaging Tamil-Muslim relations, in order to assert control over the contested territories.\nPost-May 2009: End of Sri Lankan Civil War\nOn July 4, 2009, a public disarmament event involving Muslim militant groups in Sri Lanka's Eastern Province was held at the Kattankudy Jumma Meera Mosque. The event was conducted in the context of a government-declared amnesty program aimed at encouraging the surrender of arms and reintegration of local militant groups.  The event took place at Kattankudy Jumma Meera Mosque on July 4, 2009 afternoon 3:00 p.m, in the presence of the Eastern Deputy Inspector General of Police (D.I.G.) Edison Gunatilake and Provincial Minister M.L.A.M. Hisbullah.  Images of the event were later circulated and can be found on the [https://factcheck.afp.com/no-these-photos-do-not-show-recent-weapons-handover-muslim-groups-sri-lanka AFP Fact Check website] documenting the disarmament event.\nAt the time of the amnesty, the Sri Lankan Army and Police intensified its security operations in Sri Lanka’s Eastern Province during this time to capture three high-profile individuals identified as Police Faiz, Muthur Nizam, and Ruhul Haq; figures who are believed to have played a critical role in the radicalization and recruitment of Muslim youth in the region.\nBy July 4, 2009, the authorities had already picked up seven suspects, in a series of precision raids led by special police units in Kattankudy and Eravur. One of those raids hit a jihadi hideout where they found two suspects and extensive weapons caches including seven T-56 rifles, SMG weapons, anti-personnel mines, claymore mines, detonators and high frequency communication sets. It was a clear sign of how deeply armed and organized these groups were.\nSecurity officials confirmed that investigations were underway to establish whether the individuals in question maintained affiliations with international extremist networks such as al-Qaeda, as well as identifying potential sources of external funding that may have supported their operations.\nExtensively reported Massacres involving Sri Lankan Home Guards\nAmong the many incidents of violence during the Sri Lankan Civil War, certain massacres involving Sri Lankan Home Guards are remembered for their scale, brutality, and their long-term impact on inter-ethnic relations in affected regions. While initially established as a rural defence force to protect Sri Lankan villages from insurgent attacks, the Home Guards increasingly became involved in offensive operations alongside the military. Over time, the Home Guard system became closely tied to operations targeting Tamil civilians. The following are some the most well-known and thoroughly documented cases involving Home Guards, with an emphasis on their historical context, scale and consequences.\nOthiyamalai Massacre\nOne of the earliest documented massacres involving Home Guards occurred on 2 December 1984 in the village of Othiyamalai, located in the Mullaitivu District where Sri Lankan Army personnel and Home Guards executed 32 Tamil civilians. Of these, 27 men were stripped, tied up and shot on the spot, while five others were detained and executed later.  The events in Othiyamalai marked the beginning of a troubling alliance between state forces and auxiliary groups, a dynamic that would contribute to even more widespread atrocities in the years ahead. A very clear example was the Veeramunai Massacure in 1990.\nVeeramunai Massacre\nThe Veeramunai Massacres, which occurred between 20 June and 15 August 1990 in Veeramunai village of the Amparai district, resulted in the deaths of over 250 Tamil civilians, and the destruction of more than 2,000 homes  in attacks carried out by Sri Lankan forces and Muslim Home Guards. During this period, a local Hindu temple was also set on fire. The attack was part of a broader pattern of retaliation by the Sri Lankan government forces aimed at Tamil villages, which were suspected of supporting the Tamil Tigers. Notably, this was not the first instance of violence in Veeramunai; a similar massacre occurred in 1954, indicating a historical pattern of conflict involving the Tamil population in the area.\nAkkaraipattu Massacre\nIn addition to these major incidents, earlier massacres demonstrated similar patterns of coordinated violence. One such case is the Akkaraipattu Massacre, which took place on 19 February 1986 in the village of Udumbankulam. Sri Lankan Army troops, supported by Home Guards, attacked Tamil farm workers while they were performing in daily tasks in the paddy fields, killing at least 80 Tamil farm workers. According to the community leaders of Akkaraipattu, the troops tied the hands of the male farmers and made them sit along the roadside before taking them back to the fields, where they were shot.  Several spent ammunition casings were later recovered from the site.  In the aftermath of the assault, five Tamil women came forward with reports that they had been raped in the paddy fields during the assault.\nTiraikerny Massacre\nIn the lead-up to the major wave of massacres occurring in 1990s September, Muslim Home Guards attacked the village of Tiraikerny in the Amparai district on 6 August, 1990, killing at least 54 Tamil civilians, including women and children. The attackers used a variety of weapons during the assault, including a spear and a trident removed from the temple's premises, which are traditionally associated with the Hindu deities Murugan and Lord Shiva, respectively, as well as religious tools used in the temple by priests, such as knives, axes, and crowbars. The attackers also set several homes on fire before the assault had even begun.  The Tiraikerny massacre is one of many attacks during the period of heightened ethnic violence between Tamils and Muslims in the region.\nPolonnaruwa Massacres\nOn 29 April 1992, in response to an attack on police posts in Alanchipothana by the Tamil Tigers, two large-scale assaults were launched on the Tamil villages of Muthugal and Karapola by the Sri Lankan Home Guards and policemen. In total, 89 Tamil civilians were killed in this coordinated attack. In Muthugal, 51 people were killed by state-backed Home Guards, among the victims were 13 children below the age of 10.  In the neighbouring village of Karapola, another 38 Tamils were killed, marking one of the deadliest retaliatory violence in the region during this period.\nThe 1990s Black September Massacres\nThe most concentrated wave of massacres involving Home Guards occurred in September 1990, a period that has come to be known among Tamils as Black September. The trigger for this series of events was the Kattankudy Mosque Massacre. Though attributed to the LTTE, the perpetrators were never conclusively identified through a judicial process. In the weeks that followed, several massacres targeting Tamil civilians were carried out by Muslim Home Guards and Sri Lankan military across the Eastern Province.\nEastern University Massacre\nOn 5 September, 1990, 158 Tamil civilians sheltering at the Eastern University campus in Batticaloa were killed. These individuals, who had sought shelter from ongoing nearby violence at the University, were rounded up and arrested by the Sri Lankan military and Muslim Home Guards before being executed.  Following their arrest, the individuals were forcibly removed from the premises.  Given the suspicious circumstance, it is presumed that they were subsequently executed as none of these victims were never seen again, and their bodies were never found. No official investigation or legal proceedings were conducted against those suspected of involvement, leaving the case unresolved.\nSathurukondan Massacre\nThe Sathurukondan massacre occurred just four days after the Eastern University massacre and was carried out on 9 September 1990 in Batticaloa. More than 186 Tamil civilians were killed by the Sri Lankan Army, with the support of Muslim Home Guards. Among the victims were five infants, 42 children under the age of 10, 9 pregnant women and 28 seniors. The massacre has been widely cited as an example of state-backed violence in which non-combatant civilians were specifically targeted.  The event is also noted for its scale, for the indiscriminate nature of the violence that targeted Tamil civilians, regardless of age or gender.\nThis particular massacre was investigated by a presidential commission formed in 1997 under President Chandrika Kumaratunga. The probe led by esteemed Sri Lankan judge K. Palakidnar, determined three captains from the Sri Lankan Army to have taken part in the massacre and concluded that there was substantial evidence supporting the allegations. The judge advised President Kumaratunga to bring those accountable to justice. However, the government chose not to follow through on the commission’s recommendations.\nSavukkadi Massacre & Thalaivai Massacre\nThe massacre at Eastern University was soon followed by another atrocity only two weeks later. On September 20, 1990, two more massacres occurred in close succession. In total, more than 42 Tamil civilians were killed in this coordinated attack. In Savukkadi, 33 Tamils were killed, among them were 26 villagers, including ten children and an infant, who were burned alive and buried in ditches. The other seven victims were Tamil fishermen who were shot and killed while off the coast near Savukkadi.\nIn addition to these incidents, in the neighbouring village of Thalaivai in Eravur, Muslim Home Guards entered the Tamil settlement in the early morning hours and woke residents from their homes, claiming they were required to attend a meeting with an army commander. Once the victims were gathered in a forested area, they were executed. More than nine Tamils were killed in this particular attack. The violence continued into the next day in Puthukkudiyiruppu, Mullaitivu.\n1990 Puthukkudiyiruppu Massacre\nOn 21 September 1990, in Puthukkudiyiruppu, Mullaitivu, Muslim Home Guards rounded up 44 Tamil civilians, including women and children and forced them onto the beach; where the victims were attacked with knives and swords. This massacre resulted in 17 deaths while 27 others sustained serious injuries.\nThe failure to investigate these incidents despite credible witness testimonies, human rights reports, and international attention has reinforced a culture in which state-affiliated groups operated with little fear of legal consequence. In some cases, this impunity contributed to the normalization of violence, where extrajudicial killings and reprisal attacks against civilians occurred without restraint or oversight. The unwillingness to confront state-linked violence not only undermines the rule of law but also continues to impede post-war reconciliation and justice for affected communities. The extent and nature of these abuses are further illuminated in the following section through testimonies that reveal the lived realities behind the statistics and reports.\nVeeramunai Massacre, Amparai Testimonies\nThe North-East Secretariat on Human Rights (NESOHR) documented the abuses from the Veeramunai massacre by collecting survivor testimonies and publishing the names of the victims.  The following summary of events is based on those reports:\nOn 20 June 1990, Sri Lankan Army personnel entered Malwaththa and Veeramunai, reportedly opening fire on civilians and burning houses. Many residents from surrounding villages fled to the Veeramunai Temple, which had been converted into a makeshift refugee camp. The army reportedly created a climate of terror, targeting people in their homes, on the road, and in paddy fields. People on their way to work were stopped and killed; with the dead bodies subsequently cremated. Males over the age of fifteen were targeted, with youths and children among those arrested; later taken away under the pretext of questioning. One Sri Lankan army officer was overheard telling an onlooker at the Veeramunai temple that he would \"order his men to shoot every man and woman in the area\" before detaining some youths.\nSurvivors described severe physical abuse during detention, with visible bruises and injuries on their bodies providing clear evidence of the mistreatment and torture they were put through. Those arrested were reportedly taken to \"Sammanthurai Al-Matjan Muslim School\", where they were beaten. Only a small fraction of the detainees survived, with reports indicating that many victims were killed; their bodies burned, and hidden in surrounding areas such as Malaikadu. Muslim Home Guards reportedly covered the remains of the dead with several tractor loads of paddy husks in order to cremate the dead bodies.\nEyewitness accounts also indicate that some of the killings were carried out by armed men in civilian clothing, as they witnessed them abduct people with an army truck and then execute the groups of villagers in nearby forests. Mr. Madasamy Kathirkamamoorthy, who survived the massacre, recounted being tied behind his back and beaten. He stated that many of the victims were seen with blood dripping as a result of this torture and at the end of the assault were forced to organize themselves in a line, before being executed using the machine guns held by the Perpetrators. However, Mr. Madasamy Kathirkamamoorthy’s quick thinking helped him survive this massacre. By turning to his side, he avoided fatal injuries, sustaining gunshot wounds only to his arms and legs. As the other victims attempted to get up, they were repeatedly shot until they laid motionless. However, he managed to drag himself away from the scene, slowly moving to safety. The operation resulted in numerous deaths, widespread terror, and forced displacement of the local population.\nSathurukondan Massacre, Batticaloa Testimonies\nA survivor of the Sathurukondan Massacre, Mr. K. Krishnakumar, recounted the events of that day in an interview with TamilNet recorded in 1997: The following summary of events is based on those reports:\nOn the morning of 20 September, 1990, the Sri Lankan army had cordoned off the villages of Sathurukondan, Panichchayadi, Pillaiyaradi and Kokkuvil by 10 am. According to the survivor, four masked men entered the hall at the Sathurukondan Boys’ Town army camp around 7pm and picked him, along with K. Jeevaratnam, C. Sinnaththamby, and T. Kumar. They were escorted to the camp’s backyard with the assurance that they will be released after a brief inquiry. Instead, the men were forcibly dragged to a 20-foot by 5-foot pit, surrounded by twenty-five (25) armed Sri Lankan army soldiers.\nMr. K. Krishnakumar was struck with a cudgel and fell face down. As the other three victims cried out in terror, the soldiers gagged and stripped them. Subsequently, they were forced towards the edge of the large pit, where they were slashed with swords. Mr. K. Krishnakumar himself was hurled against a cashew tree and then stabbed in the chest with a long kris knife. Despite, the lost blood, he didn't lose consciousness.\nThis is when four additional men who were brought to the pit, were also hacked to death and pushed into it. Subsequently, the soldiers brought in two pregnant women, who were stripped naked and tortured, as they had their breasts cut off. The Sri Lankan army soldiers also cut their abdomens open before forcing their bodies into the pit. Additionally, the soldiers brought several other females who were also stripped naked and then proceeded to rape them repeatedly. The soldiers also subjected them to mutilation by severing their breasts; after which at least three of these victims were discarded into a nearby well.\nMr. K. Krishnakumar is the sole survivor of the Sathurukondan massacre who witnessed the execution of others, including the rape and murder of girls, the mutilation of pregnant women, and the burning of bodies with tires. He managed to crawl out during the chaos and later sought help from a passer-by to reach a hospital. His testimony was recorded by the Batticaloa Peace Committee, and detailed the systematic slaughter of 184 to 185 Tamil civilians from Sathurukondan and surrounding villages.\nEastern University Refugee Massacre, Vantharumoolai Testimonies\nLecturers at the University provided refuge and raised a white flag at the entrance. According to an eyewitness account documented by UTHR:“As the army advanced into the villages of Kondayankerny, Sungankerny and Karuvakkerny, they opened fire and began hacking the people, resulting in multiple fatalities. The Army had access to a bulldozer, and it was used to bury the bodies; without any delay in between the killings. The army arrested forty-eight (48) residents from those three villages and forced them to move to the Valaichchenai main road, where they were executed and their bodies buried within the premises of a private property.”Following the arrest of 138 individuals, the witness himself was detained on his way home and held for nine days, during which he observed the killing of detainees inside the camp.  The witness further stated that:“Over the course of seven days, Eastern University campus had become a shelter for fifty-five thousand (55,000) refugees. On day eight, the army accompanied by Muslim Home Guards advanced into the campus, disregarding the white flag that had been put up. While a member of the army spoke to us, two empty buses came to the campus. With the help of Muslim Home Guards, the Sri Lankan army soldiers ordered the people to line up and picked 138 youths from the camp (subsequently revised up to 158). Families and parents cried out and begged, but the 138 youths were forcibly taken to an unknown location. Later, we visited every army camp to inquire about their whereabouts, but the army denied any knowledge of them.”Thangamuthu Jayasingam, who served as the officer in charge of the Vantharumoolai refugee camp at the time, later recorded in 2015 that he had spoken to “various national and international persons” and had provided testimony before the Presidential Commission on Missing Persons in 2004. Reflecting on the events, he stated:“I gave them the names of all the army officers involved in the operation, along with the Army Major General who came to the camp three days later, on 8th September. I am not aware whether any investigations have been conducted since then.”\nAkkaraipattu massacre, Amparai Testimonies\nAccording to the local leaders in Akkaraipattu reported that the victims were threshing paddy when Sri Lankan army troops emerged from the nearby jungle, firing into the air. The men were rounded up, tied and then returned to the fields, where they were executed. Reports indicate that their bodies were piled on top of a harvested, dry rice crop and set on fire, with several used ammunition casings later recovered from the site. In the aftermath of the assault, five Tamil women came forward with reports that they had been raped in the paddy fields during the assault.\nThe event was documented by BBC foreign correspondent and journalist, Humphrey Hawksley in The Guardian on February 22, 1986. He was subsequently, expelled from Sri Lanka after six months for documenting human rights abuses against civilians in his coverage of the conflict. The incident has been cited as an example of ethnic cleansing and systematic violence against the Tamil population in Sri Lanka's Eastern Province during that period.\nTiraikerny massacre, Amparai Testimonies\nThe North-East Secretariat on Human Rights (NESOHR) documented the abuses from the Tiraikerny massacre by collecting survivor testimonies and publishing the names of the victims. The following summary of events is based on testimony from a survivor:\nIn the early hours, Tamil villagers reported hearing the cries of Muslim women, mourning the deaths of several men from their community who had gone to work in the paddy fields at Alimadakadu. Later on in the day, the fellow inhabitants of the village warned that an armed Muslim mob, reportedly heavily armed, was advancing towards Thiraikerny to attack Tamils. The Tamil families in Tiraikerny, including women and children, fled their homes and sought refuge in the Pillaiyar Temple.\nA mob of more than one hundred and fifty (150) men, armed with knives, swords, sickles, and clubs, approached the temple, shouting slogans and calling on Muslims to unite to attack the Tamil villagers. The Tamil villagers saw smoke rising from their burning houses. As the attackers neared the Pillaiyar Temple, many of the villagers sought refuge at the Periyathambiran Temple, with the mob following closely behind.\nAn armoured car carrying six (6) Sri Lankan army soldiers arrived at the temple premises. However, the soldiers did not take part in the attack themselves. Tamil youths pleaded with the soldiers to prevent the imminent attack, but the soldiers reportedly stated that, since Tamils had killed Muslims, the army could not intervene. The soldiers then waved their hands, which the mob interpreted as a signal to begin the assault.\nThe attackers began to desecrate the temple, taking sacred objects such as the Trident and spear from the sanctum, which were used against the civilians. Men seated on the ground were stabbed and hacked, while women and children were also killed. Many victims attempted to flee through the back, but most did not return alive. Among the dead were entire families, including a young mother, Vijeyaluxmy, and her infant child. Specifically, the husband of the person who gave this testimony was among those who did not survive the massacre.\nWitnesses reported that the soldiers’ presence appeared to encourage the attackers, which led some people to wonder whether it was a joint attack of the Sri Lankan Army and the Muslim Home Guards. When gunfire was later heard, the soldiers fled in their armoured car, followed by the mob shouting that “Tigers are coming.” Subsequently, members of the Special Task Force (STF) arrived, firing as they advanced, and drove away the remaining attackers.\nWhen the STF entered the area, they discovered a scene of mass slaughter: dozens of Tamil men, women, and children were dead or mutilated, with blood and flesh scattered all over the temple. The survivors were frozen in shock and the chief of the STF promised protection to the victims. Importantly, the account notes that the Tamil villagers did not fight back.\nPolonnaruwa Massacre (Muthugal & Karapola Villages) Testimonies\nThe following summary of events is based on the Amnesty International Report which documented the abuses from the Polonnaruwa Massacres by collecting survivor testimonies and publishing the names of the victims:\nMore than eighty Tamil villagers from the nearby villages of Muthugal and Karapola were intentionally killed by Home Guards, apparently in retaliation for an alleged LTTE attack on the Muslim village of Alanchipothana on 29 April 1992.\nSome Sri Lankan policemen from Karapola joined the Home Guards in Muthugal, where they shot and stabbed dozens of Tamil villagers to death. They then returned to Karapola, where an additional thirty-eight (38) people were allegedly killed. Around 9 am, they went back to Muthugal and continued the killings until approximately 10 am, when the army arrived and forced them to retreat.\nOne of the victims of this massacre reported, in a residence where a group of Tamils had taken refuge, the eye-witness’ son was shot in the chest by a Home Guard as he stood against the door to prevent the perpetrators from entering. Other eyewitnesses also corroborated his account, and added there were seven further victims including three children aged two, four and twelve documented in this particular incident. Another incident resulted in the deaths of Sivapathy and her three-year-old child, Sinnarasiah Thangeswaran, who were shot as she tried to protect the older children in the household.\nMany villagers who had fled Muthugal were later found hiding in paddy fields by Home Guards from Madurangala. According to Amnesty's report, a witness identified as the wife of Peiris Wijayasinghe recalled that a group of Home Guards brought six detainees to their residence in Madurangala. Among them was P. Packiyarajah, a relative of hers, as well as a woman from Muthugal. In a subsequent interview, she provided a detailed account of the events that unfolded that day: ''“They asked my husband whether he knew Packiyarajah of Muthugal... My husband then said, '... they are innocent and it is out of fear that they had hidden in the paddy [rice] fields'. The Home Guards then beat my husband with rifle butts and with their hands. Soon afterwards the Karapola policemen came... and they beat all the six men, including my husband, and ordered all of them to get into a white van. They said they were taking them to the Karapola police station.”''\nSri Lankan Army personnel from the Welikande army camp allegedly entered the area around 6:30 am,. The reported death toll in Muthugal was fifty-one (51), including thirteen (13) children under the age of ten (10). A list of the names of the fifty-one (51) victims executed in Muthugal and thirty-one (31) of the thirty-eight (38) killed in Karapola in these Massacres, was published by Amnesty International.\nReferences\nFurther Reading & External Links\n* A major source for the documentation of these massacres is the book [https://web.archive.org/web/20250924212407/https://sangam.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/English-Massacres-of-Tamils-1956-2008.pdf Massacres of Tamils, 1956 - 2008], published by Manitham Publishers in 2009 (ISBN 978-81-909737-0-0).
