It examines the widespread claim that Muslims under Caliph Umar destroyed the Library of Alexandria and argues, based on historical evidence, that the library had already been lost centuries earlier. The work critically analyzes European and Christian sources, concluding that the allegation against Muslims was unfounded and historically inaccurate.\nOverview\nThe essay was first published in 1892. Its purpose was to investigate and respond to the widely circulated claim that during the Arab conquest of Egypt, Caliph Umar destroyed the Library of Alexandria, a repository of centuries of accumulated knowledge established under the Ptolemies. This allegation, often used to suggest that Muslims were hostile to knowledge, became widely accepted in Europe. Shibli observed that this narrative had influenced literature, philosophy, and popular expression, permeating cultural and intellectual discourse for centuries.\nShibli's research demonstrated that Muslims were not responsible for the library's destruction. By the time of the Muslim conquest, the library had already ceased to exist: half had been destroyed centuries earlier by Julius Caesar, and the remaining works had been dispersed. The claim implicating Muslims appears to have originated with the Christian writer Abu al-Farj (b. 1226) and was subsequently propagated by European chroniclers, who attributed the destruction to Muslims without rigorous investigation. Shibli also noted the selective attention of European historians, observing that other major libraries in Iran, Spain, and elsewhere had been destroyed without comparable concern, raising questions about why the Library of Alexandria received such particular focus.\nIn his investigation, Shibli examined European writings in German, French, and English, systematically evaluating their claims. Although primarily a scholar of Arabic and Persian, he referenced European sources with precision and applied the principles of narrational transmission to verify historical events.\nLegacy\nThrough this essay, Shibli is regarded as the first scholar to systematically refute the claim that Muslims were responsible for the destruction of the Library of Alexandria. His refutation was later acknowledged by several orientalist scholars in the 20th century. The essay was widely read and translated into multiple languages. An English translation by Muhammad Ghouse Sayeed was published in Hyderabad in 1893, and another translation was later produced by Sabahuddin Abdur Rahman. The work continues to be cited as a definitive study on the subject, and according to Arshad Islam, it compelled many European scholars to reconsider earlier assumptions about the destruction of the library and became a part of broader discussions on the reliability of historical narratives. Sulaiman Nadvi stated that the study was widely accepted among researchers.\nSeveral scholars have reviewed the work in detail. Md. Nasir of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar Bihar University noted that it reflects Shibli's deep understanding of history, historiographical methodology, and Islamic civilization. Mohammad Ilyas al-Azami described it as comprehensive, well-reasoned, and scholarly, while Zafar Ahmad Siddiqi emphasized the value of its engaging introduction, systematic arrangement of evidence, and clarity of presentation. Md. Faiz Ahmad of Delhi University observed that Shibli's essay challenged European historical narratives by questioning research methods, scrutinizing accounts, and addressing issues of bias, while also combining rigorous research, logical reasoning, and evidence. He further noted that the essay drew the attention of European scholars, influenced subsequent debates, and helped counter widely circulated narratives.\nSee also\n* Deobandi historical works\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Urdu version at Internet Archive\n* English version at Internet Archive"
