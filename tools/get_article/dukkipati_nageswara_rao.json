He also met Mahatma Gandhi in his home town Peyyeru about 30 miles from his village Nandamuru during the Quit India Movement in 1942. The Government of Andhra Pradesh posthumously tried to give him 10 acres of land and a Tamra Patra (Certificate) which was given in accordance with the struggle that he fought for the freedom against the British. My late Grandmother Savithri refused to accept it and said my grandfather did it for the country and not for any monetary benefit or fiscal gain. Apart from serving in several prisons in Andhra Pradesh he also had the privilege of meeting Late  Sarvepalli Radhakrishna during the independence struggle. He was also in many noteworthy prisons like Bellary Jail, during the freedom struggle.\nBhogaraju Pattabhi Sitaramiah (24 November 1880 – 17 December 1959) was an Indian independence activist and politician.

He was also a member of the first Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament.\nBhogaraju Pattabhi Sitaramiah is remembered for his contributions to the Indian independence movement, and how his advocacy for the rights of workers and peasants has continued to inspire others, including Dukkipati Nageswara Rao, to work towards improving the lives of marginalized communities in India.
