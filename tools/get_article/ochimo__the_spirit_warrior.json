He noted that while the adventure is intended to be used for characters of level 5-7, with seven pre-rolled characters included, \"you may find that the players should bring characters towards the upper end of that scale, or maybe even levels 7-9.  The players face some major opposition, and well played, there should be few characters left standing at the end of the adventure.\"\nReferences"
