Jeunet produces an item, and Lucy insists on Margaret modelling it.\nIn the dressing room, Lucy critiques Margaret's figure as she disrobes. She wonders why Margaret does not wear a bra and says that one can tell that she has had children.

Lucy says that she does not care and that she loves him, wondering what Margaret has that she does not. Lucy profanely disparages Margaret, citing her job at La Belle Femme. Nucky asks Lucy to calm down, and Lucy says that she has left clothes in the suite. Nucky leads her away by the arm and promises to call her. Lucy whines that she wants to see a film, and he offers to do whatever she would like. Lucy says she wants to see \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\" and he agrees that they will talk about it later.

Jeunet whispers to Margaret that Lucy is trying to use Nucky's credit in the store despite his instruction to the contrary. Lucy haughtily tells them that Americans do not whisper.

A few months later in Ohio, Remus calls Nucky and argues with him about the finder's fee in Atlantic City (especially the Ritz-Carlton), and how it is never there in Ohio before telling him that he is soon going to knock him out of the bootlegging game as there are more vast resources in Ohio than Atlantic County, and the fact that his alcohol is more wider and of higher quality whilst he also calls Nucky petty, causing Nucky to insult him and hang the phone abruptly on him soon afterwards.

During this time, Dunn also gets acquainted with Narcisse because of him having had enough of Chalky's sometimes verbal abuse and the fact that Narcisse is offering him a bigger deal as a right-hand man than Chalky ever did. One night when Chalky is out, Dunn goes to Harlem to talk to Narcisse. After a rocky start, the 2 get along with a walk-through Harlem as Narcisse explains to Dunn Marcus Garvey's teachings, the black rights vote and the type of black person to obey white people (named a Guppie) like Chalky who obeys Nucky. Narcisse shows Dunn a Guppie which causes Dunn to beat him up and gain Narcisse's trust, becoming his right-hand man and one of his main drug runners whilst at the same time, also acting as Chalky's right-hand man and assistant and starting to slowly betray him behind his back to go to Narcisse's side.\nA few months after this, drugs become more popular and slowly start to ruin Atlantic City's black community whilst Narcisse's influence starts to become more powerful over Chalky's.

After a few days, Chalky, Dunn and all of Chalky's henchmen raid a drug den set up in Atlantic City by Narcisse and secretly Dunn.

That night, Dunn tells Chalky his car is ready, however, before the assassination could happen, Chalky tells him he knows his role in his feud with Narcisse and how Dunn has betrayed him. This then causes Dunn to attack and start physically fighting Chalky to kill him, however, before he could kill him, Daughter Maitland comes to Chalky's rescue and stabs Dunn brutally through the back.
