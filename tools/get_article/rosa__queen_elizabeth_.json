The stock parents of 'Queen Elizabeth' are the hybrid tea, Rosa 'Charlotte Armstrong' and the floribunda, 'Floradora'.\n'Queen Elizabeth' has been used to hybridize 30 new rose cultivars. Several color sports of 'Queen Elizabeth' have been introduced, including 'Yellow Queen Elizabeth', (1964) and 'White Queen Elizabeth', (aka 'Blanc Queen Elizabeth'), (1965). The climbing sport, 'Climbing Queen Elizabeth', (1957) is a very popular, vigorous climbing rose.\nDescription\n'Queen Elizabeth' is a tall, narrow upright shrub, 5 to 10&nbsp;ft (150–305&nbsp;cm) in height with a 3 to 4&nbsp;ft (90–182&nbsp;cm) spread.
