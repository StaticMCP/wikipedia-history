He returned to the professional tour in 2005. On his return, he won six of the tour's lower-ranking tournaments in a row, and two further lower-ranking tournaments later in the year. He broke back into the world's top-20 in 2006 and the top-10 in 2007.\nAt the 2002 Commonwealth Games, Boswell won a bronze medal in the men's singles, and silver medal in the men's doubles partnering Anthony Ricketts. Boswell and Ricketts again won a men's doubles silver medal at the 2006 Commonwealth Games. The pair won the men's doubles title at the 2006 World Doubles Squash Championships.\nDuring the 2011 Kuwait PSA Cup, where he lost in the quarter-finals to  Grégory Gaultier, Boswell announced that he would be retiring as a professional player.\nMajor World Series final appearances\nUS Open: 1 finals (0 title, 1 runner-up)\n{|   class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n!width=\"100\"| Outcome\n!width=\"50\"| Year\n!width=\"200\"| Opponent in the final\n!width=\"200\"| Score in the final\n|-\n|   bgcolor=\"ffa07a\"|Runner-up || 2002 ||    David Palmer   || 15–13, 15–10, 15–11\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://squash365.com/?p=1871 Stewart Boswell retires, Nov 2011]\n*\n*\n*[http://www.squashpics.com/topmen/stewart_boswell.htm Page at Squashpics]"
