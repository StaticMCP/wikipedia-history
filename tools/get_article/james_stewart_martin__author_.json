In it, Martin catalogs the difficulties faced by his team trying to deconstruct the Nazi industrial machine, not the least of which was opposition to his efforts by his superior officer, an investment banker in peacetime. In the book, Martin blamed Wall Street's pre-war ties to German Big Business for obstructionist efforts among the Allied powers to prevent the breakup of German industrial power.\nMartin was also Maryland state chairman of the Progressive Party.\nDuring the 1970s, Martin lived in Downers Grove, Illinois, before relocating to Clearwater, Florida. He died there on January 30, 1987, at the age of 75.\nReferences"
