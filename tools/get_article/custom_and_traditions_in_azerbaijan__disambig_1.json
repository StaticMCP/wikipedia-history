When the father asks his daughter about this relationship, the daughter must remain silent. Silence means agreement. This is because the main decision belongs to adults and elders.\nMatch-making\nBoy's Father invites close relatives such as uncles and aunts to the home.

Mother-in-law of girl gives the gift to her for decorating the room.\nKebin (Religious marriage registering)\nReligious marriage registering takes place a few days before the wedding ceremony. One person as a witness from both sides must present on this registering. After the establishment of the Soviet Union in Azerbaijan, the public has started preferring the form of marriage by the state. Usually, it is registered by Mullah. People were giving money and one sugar loaf which was 8&nbsp;kg in weight.\nXinayaxdi (Henna Night)\nGirls gather in one of the rooms. One of bride relatives takes henna and starts dancing in the middle of the room. Then she brings a tray and an empty box and puts them in front of the one of groom's relatives. This relative puts money into the empty box and takes the henna. She comes to the bride with dancing then the bride's fingers and feet are smeared in henna (\"henna ceremony\"). Then henna is brought in front of everybody. Everybody smears henna and gives namar. Then the jewelry that the groom's relatives brought was presented to everybody.\nMeanwhile, a girl from bride's side brings a \"2 color\" tea to the groom and his friends. They also drink tea and put a namar (according to Azerbaijani traditions, namar is a candle, money, or little gift which is collected in wedding, or engagement ceremony) on an empty tray. One of the girls brings the henna and the boys are sliding their little finger into the henna.\nWedding\nThe bride writes the names of her single friends under her shoes on the wedding day. According to the tradition, when the wedding is over, the person whose name is deleted will be the next bride. The groom, his friends, and relatives come to the bride's house for carrying the bride to the wedding place, in a fancy and luxurious car decorated with bands and flowers. They carry a mirror and candles that are believed to represent happiness. Before Bride leaves the father's house, the red ribbon is closed to the waist by the groom's father or brother. Then the bride goes around the lamp three times. Bride's parents wish to couple all the best. At this moment a little boy of bride home runs and closes the door. It is said “Qapibasma”. Bride and \"brotherhood\" give him a namar and they open the door. Bride leave the house under the music of “Vağzalı”.\nBeliefs after wedding\nWhen the bride arrives at the groom's house, Plate is put under her feet for breaking. This is a sign of becoming a housewife. She sits on a chair and a boy child is given to her arms so that she has a baby boy soon.\nFuneral ceremony\nWhen a person dies, he is laid to the south, his body is covered with black cloth which is the symbol of mourning, and a mirror is put on his chest. Local people believed that not only the external appearance but also the internal nature is reflected in the mirror, in other words, the spirit. It is supposed that the reflection of the person in the mirror also has a spirit. By putting a mirror in front of the dead body, the reflection of the body with spirit is returned to the dead body so that it does not hurt people living there. The custom of putting a mirror on the chest is differently described in the southwest of the country: A mirror protects the deceased person because the spirit has already left the body.\nOf course, it is prayed a lot for the dead person. If the person could not be buried because of dying at the end of the day, the lamp is lit next to him. The relatives of the deceased (not only women) will be with him all night long.\nGenerally, once the person dies, everyone: relatives, friends, neighbors swarm to his home. The dead body needs to be washed and if there is a mosque nearby, the dead body is washed there. Washing exactly in the mosque is not so important. Then the corpse is worn a white garment which is longer in case of women body. They wrap the lower part of the garment with white cloth and then they cover all of this with a white shroud.\nMuslims do not use coffins. They carry the corpse in a stretcher or in an open box made of wood. Usually, sons or brothers of the deceased carry him on their shoulders or other close relatives in case of absence. Women are never involved in funerals. They can visit the grave only the next day, not on a funeral day.\nThe mullah reads prayers to God all the way to the cemetery and asks for the forgiveness of the deceased's soul. If the age of the deceased is less than six, prayer is not performed. It is believed that child is innocent and his place is already Paradise, thus there is no reason to pray for the salvation of the child's soul.\nWhen the grave is being covered with soil, the deceased's son or brother should stand in direction of the grave so that the deceased is not feeling loneliness.\nAnyone who touches the corpse should be absolutely ablution after funerals. The music is turned off in cars, even in buses when they pass near the cemetery.\nMourning continues after coming back from funerals. On the burial day only tea, sweets and halvah are given to people. Halvah is made of flour, oil, and sugar. Halvah can also be cooked for some holidays.\nNobody is invited to the funeral, they join themselves. The funeral is also held on the 3rd and 7th day of the deceased. Mullah take part in all funerals and led to funeral prayers.\nNot only halvah is given to people at funerals but also plov and meat dishes. On that day a special cleaning ritual is held: blanket and mattress of deceased is cleaned.\nEveryone can go to the home of the deceased for condolences until the 40th day every Friday and they can drink a cup of tea with halvah. Until 40th-day relatives of the deceased are considering mourning days. No one wears jewellery; however, they wear black dresses. Men are not shaving. Relatives are not going to any festivals of parties during those 40 days. Neighbors also turn off the loud music. Even the corpse's relatives who are engaged must wait one year for their wedding.\nSee also\n*Culture of Azerbaijan\n*Azerbaijani cuisine\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.everyculture.com/A-Bo/Azerbaijan.html Azerbaijan] at World Culture Encyclopedia"
