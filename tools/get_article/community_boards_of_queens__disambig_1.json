Additionally, all City Council members representing the community district are non-voting, ex officio board members.\nHistory\nThe 1963 revision of the New York City Charter extended the Borough of Manhattan's \"Community Planning Councils\" (est. 1951) to the outer boroughs as \"Community Planning Boards\", which are now known as \"Community Boards\".\nThe 1975 revision of the New York City Charter set the number of Community Districts/Boards to 59, established the position of the district manager for the community districts, and created the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) which gave the community boards the authority to review land use proposals such as zoning actions, and special permits.\nCommunity boards\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n!
