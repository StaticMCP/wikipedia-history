He died in 1862, and a monument was commissioned for a location atop Bulmer Hill on the approach to the estate.  It is in the form of a  column.  It was designed by Frederick Pepys Cockerell, with work commencing in August 1867, and being completed in 1869.  The project cost £2,600.\nThe monument was twice struck by lightning.  It was hit by a bomber during World War II, which caused the brazier at its top to fall.  A new brazier was created to the original design and set atop the monument in 2002.  The monument was Grade I listed in 1954.\nThe monument is built of granite and sandstone, sourced from near Whitby.  It consists of a tall column with garlands hanging down on the north and south sides, a capital carved with scrolls, heads and acanthus leaves.  It is surmounted by a gilt-bronze tripod, which supports a gilded brazier, embellished with a design of flames and swans' heads, designed to reflect the sun.  The column stands on a base approached by steps, with rusticated quoins, an inscription and a plaque, on a platform with knights' helmets on bases at the corners.  The column is 7 feet 4 inches in diameter and is hollow, but no internal staircase was provided, Cockerell contending that its elevated position already provided excellent views.\nSee also\n*Grade I listed buildings in North Yorkshire (district)\n*Listed buildings in Bulmer, North Yorkshire\nReferences"
