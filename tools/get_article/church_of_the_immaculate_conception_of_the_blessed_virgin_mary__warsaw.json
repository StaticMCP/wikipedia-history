Before construction resumed in 1927 the church hosted the parish of St James the Apostle.\nThe church sustained some damage during the siege of Warsaw in 1939, mainly to the Chapel of the Virgin Mary. Much heavier damage occurred during the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 and most of the building's contents were destroyed, including the roof and the stained glass windows designed by H Bardzińska. Reconstruction work began in 1946 and was largely complete by the end of the 1950s."
