Spike Lee, the director of the film, had asked Speech to write a song for it. Speech considered it a personal responsibility to \"acknowledge that there is a need for struggle, because of all the bad things going on in the nation\", which is reflected in the line \"Am I doing as much as I can for the struggle?\" He composed the song with a purpose to urge people into action in bringing about change.\nMusic video\nThe music video was directed by Spike Lee. It was shot in a high school, a city block, and a street in Brooklyn with \"about 500 extras\". Each location had at least 100 people in the filming. According to Speech, the video was shot in seven hours.\nCharts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1992–1993)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Dance (Music Week)\n| 2\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Club Chart (Music Week)\n| 2\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
