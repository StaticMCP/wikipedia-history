Cape Helles is in square&nbsp;13\nDuring the Gallipoli campaign in 1915, several battles were fought near the village of Krithia, today Alçıtepe. The village was an objective of the first day of the landing, 25 April 1915. Over the following months, invading British Empire (including the 89th Punjabis of the British Indian Army) and French troops, who had landed near Cape Helles at the end of the peninsula, made several attempts to capture the village. It was never reached; the Ottoman defenders successfully repulsed every assault.\nThe attacks came to be known as:\n* The First Battle of Krithia - 28 April\n* The Second Battle of Krithia - 6 May - 8 May\n* The Third Battle of Krithia - 4 June\n* The Battle of Krithia Vineyard - 6 August – 13 August\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n\n---\n\n## Battle of krithia\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Krithia"
