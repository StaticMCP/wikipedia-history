They are the largest, all-media, general reporting prizes in America. Popularly referred to as the \"Pulitzer for the Young\", the awards have recognized the early talent of journalists, including Michele Norris, Christiane Amanpour, David Remnick, Ira Glass, J. R. Moehringer, Thomas Friedman, Rick Atkinson, David Isay, Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, Tom Ashbrook, Nicholas Confessore, C. J. Chivers, Michael S. Schmidt, and Ronan Farrow.\nOverview\nUnlike other prizes in journalism (such as the George Foster Peabody Awards, the George Polk Awards, the National Journalism Awards and the Pulitzer Prizes), the Livingston Awards judge print, broadcast, and online entries against one another.\nThe winners are selected by the Livingston Board of National Judges. These include Christiane Amanpour, Ken Auletta, Dean Baquet, Charles Gibson, Ellen Goodman, John F. Harris, Clarence Page, and Anna Quindlen. Mike Wallace was one of the national judges for several years.\nHistory\nMollie Parnis Livingston, one of America's first fashion designers known by name, established the Livingston Awards in 1981 to honor her son, Robert, who published the journalism review More.\nFor thirty years, The Mollie Parnis Livingston Foundation, headed by Livingston's nephew Neal Hochman, sponsored the awards. Recent supporters include the Indian Trail Foundation, Christiane Amanpour, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, and the University of Michigan.\nList of Livingston Award recipients\nRichard M. Clurman Award\nSince 1996, the Livingston Awards ceremony has also included the presentation of the Richard M.
