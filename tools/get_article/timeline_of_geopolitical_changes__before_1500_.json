It includes dates of declarations of independence, changes in country name, changes of capital city or name, and changes in territorial ownership such as the annexation, occupation, cession, concession, or secession of land. Territorial conquests as a result of war are included on the timeline at the conclusion of major military campaigns, but changes in the course of specific battles and day-to-day operations are generally not included.\nBefore the Common Era (BCE)\nFourth Millennium BCE\nFrom the 4th Millennium BCE to the 2nd Millennium BCE, hundreds of proto-cities in the Near East, Egypt, and the Indus Valley transition into city-states. Records of those geopolitical changes are complicated by mythologization, historical revisionism, missing information, lack of corroborating primary sources, and lack of archeological evidence. Consequently, the tables in that range are not comprehensive.\n{|class=wikitable style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:5%\"|Year||style=\"width:95%\"|Event\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |Before 3200 BCE||Prominent Sumerian city-states Eridu, Bad-tibira, Larak, Sippar, and Shuruppak exercise pre-dynastic kingship.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |c.&nbsp;3200&nbsp;BCE\n|Protodynastic Egyptian Kings unify '''Upper Egypt's regional power centers of Thinis, Naqada, and Nekhen.\n|-\n|The First Dynasty of Kish is established in the Sumerian city of Kish.\n|-\n|The First Dynasty of Uruk is established in the Sumerian city of Uruk.\n|-\n|align=center|c.&nbsp;3080&nbsp;BCE||Narmer (or Menes) unites Lower Egypt and Upper Egypt under the First Dynasty of Egypt.
