      "text": "# Battle Riot VI\n\nBattle Riot VI was a professional wrestling live streaming event produced by Major League Wrestling (MLW), which took place on June 1, 2024, at the Center Stage in Atlanta, Georgia. It was the sixth event under the Battle Riot chronology, the first to air live since Battle Riot II in 2019, and featured the opening rounds of the 2024 Opera Cup.\nThe event was streamed on MLW's YouTube channel, while additional matches were taped for the \"MLW Anniversary '24\" special, which was also streamed on YouTube on June 22. The event featured the in-ring debuts of actor Paul Walter Hauser and YouTuber Chris Danger, as well as appearances by WWE Hall of Famers Mark Henry and Teddy Long.\nProduction\nBackground\nBattle Riot is an annual event produced by Major League Wrestling that was first held in 2018 as a television taping for MLW Fusion. The event is named after the Battle Riot match, a multi-competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until one is left and declared winner. The match begins with a number of participants in the ring, who are then eliminated by either pin, submission, or going over the top rope and having both feet touch the venue floor. The declared winner of the Battle Riot match receives a \"golden ticket\", which they can redeem for a future MLW World Heavyweight Championship  title shot anytime and anywhere.\nOn February 19, 2024, it was announced that Battle Riot VI would take place on June 1, 2024, at Center Stage in Atlanta, Georgia.\nIn addition to MLW's regular roster, and several surprise appearances, guest personalities from outside of pro wrestling were announced as participants. On May 15, it was announced in a press release that actor Paul Walter Hauser would be in the Battle Riot match. On May 24, YouTuber Chris Danger announced in a social media post that he would enter the Battle Riot.\nStorylines\nThe card consists of matches that result from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portray villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in events that built tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by MLW's writers.\nAlex Kane had been embroiled in a feud with World Titan Federation (WTF) member A. J. Franci$ since February's The Burning Crush special. At Intimidation Games, Franci$, making his in-person debut, confronted Kane after his match to claim that not every member of Kane's Bomaye Fight Club (BFC) was loyal to him. Franci$ would go on to defeat Kane in the former's in-ring debut at War Chamber due to interference from WTF promoter Mister Saint Laurent, a low blow, and a fast count from the referee. Several members of the BFC would come out after the match and raise their fists in salute to Franci$. During the Fury Road special, which aired on May 18, Kane defeated one of Franci$'s henchmen. After the match, Franci$, via vignette, challenged Kane to a \"Ritual Combat match\" at Battle Riot VI for control of the BFC, which Kane accepted.\nSince losing the MLW World Women's Featherweight Championship to Janai Kai – then representing Salina de la Renta's Promociones Dorado – at Slaughterhouse the previous October, Delmi Exo has unsuccessfully attempted to recapture the title on multiple occasions. During the Once Upon A Time In New York special, which aired on March 16, Exo aligned herself with Azteca Lucha's Cesar Duran and defeated Zayda to become the #1 contender. In the aftermath of Salina's abduction by Duran at the end of the MLW Azteca Lucha event, Kai was revealed as a double agent for Contra Unit during the Fury Road TV special (which aired the following week); helping facilitate the group's return to prominence. Kai would then retain her title against Exo, Zayda, and Miyu Yamashita in a four-way match that same night. On May 23, MLW announced that Exo would finally get a one-on-one rematch against Kai for the Featherweight title at Battle Riot VI.\nReception\nThe live broadcast received mixed reviews. While praise was given to the World Heavyweight title match, criticism was directed at the Ritual Combat match, the Featherweight title match, and the Duran-Salina segments.\nResults\n|results=\n|caption= Battle Riot VI\n|match1 = Janai Kai (c) (with Ikuro Kwon) defeated Delmi Exo (with Cesar Duran) by pinfall\n|stip1  = Singles match for the MLW World Women's Featherweight Championship\n|time1  = 6:31\n|match2 = Alex Kane (with Faye Jackson and Mr. Thomas) defeated A.
