It is assigned to the 451st Expeditionary Operations Group.\nThe 430th Fighter Squadron, nicknamed \"The Backdoor Gang\", was first activated during World War II as part of the 474th Fighter Group and served in the European Theater of Operations, where it earned a Distinguished Unit Citation and the Belgian Fourragère for its actions in combat.  It remained in Europe after V-E Day, returning to the United States, where it was inactivated at the port of embarkation in December 1945.\nThe squadron was reactivated as the 430th Fighter-Bomber Squadron in 1952 as part of the 474th Fighter Bomber Wing and later the 474th Fighter Bomber Group, when it replaced an Air National Guard squadron in Japan.  It again saw combat in the Korean War, earning another Distinguished Unit Citation and a Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation.  The Squadron returned to the United States in 1954.\nThe 430th Tactical Fighter Squadron was deployed in September 1972 to Thailand to fly combat missions in the Vietnam War, and was awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award with Combat \"V\" Device 28 Sep 1972-22 Feb 1973 and Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm 28 Sep 1972-22 Feb 1973.  It remained a fighter unit until inactivating in 1989.\nIn 1992, the unit became the 430th Electronic Combat Squadron, but was only active for one year.  It was converted to provisional status and received its current name in 2013.\nHistory\nWorld War II\nThe 430th Fighter Squadron was activated on 1 August 1943 as a Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter squadron under IV Fighter Command in Southern California as part of the 474th Fighter Group.  It trained with the P-38 over the Mojave Desert, moving to the European Theater of Operations, and was assigned to Ninth Air Force in England during March 1944. It operated out of Warmwell, Britain, and Saint Lambert, St. Marceau, and Peronne, France, Florennes, Belgium, and Strassfeld, Langensalza, Schweinfurt, and Stuttgart, Germany during and immediately after the war in 1945. Squadron markings on the vertical tail surfaces were a circle and \"K6\" with call sign \"Back Door\". It provided bomber escort but the primary role was as an attack and interdiction fighter. It flew its first combat missions on 25 April 1944. As part of the 474th Fighter Group, they attacked bridges and railroads in France in preparation for the Normandy invasion, provided air cover for the invasion force, and flew bombing missions to support the landings. Subsequently it conducted  armed reconnaissance missions after D-Day and attacked highways and troops to support the Allied breakthrough at St Lo. The Squadron supported the British attack on Holland in Sep 1944; the Battle of the Bulge Dec 1944-Jan 1945; and the airborne assault across the Rhine in Mar 1945. As part of the 474th, it was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation for a mission on 23 August 1944 and twice the Order of the Day, Belgian Army. Personnel were demobilized in Europe during 1945, returned to the United States in November as an administrative unit and was inactivated on 7 December 1945 without personnel or equipment.\nThere is a monument at Neuilly-la-Foret dedicated in 1994 to the 474th Fighter Group. The associated information sign states in English and in French, \"Construction of the A-11 airfield was begun on the 22nd July 1944 by the 832nd Engineer Aviation Battalion. It was declared operational on 5 August 1944 and accommodated the 474th Fighter Group and the P-38 Lightnings (fighter bombers). About 100 planes parked on this aerodrome of around 200 hectares. Only three squadrons, with 25 fighter bombers in each one, were operational. The rest were used for liaison between the different aerodromes. On 23rd August, the 474th Fighter Group had its hour of glory, when it destroyed a significant quantity of equipment and materiel amassed along the Seine, behind the pocket of resistance of Falaise-Argentan. On 25 August, 23 pilots from the 474th Fighter Group took off from the aerodrome. 11 of them fell above the Oise after a huge combat with German fighters. On 5 September 1944, the land of the A-11 airfield was returned to French authorities.\"\nKorean War\nRedesignated the 430th Fighter-Bomber Squadron in June 1952 and reactivated in Japan under Far East Air Forces, July 1952 as a result of the Korean War.   Replaced Federalized Georgia Air National Guard personnel, receiving their Republic F-84G Thunderjets.   Moved to South Korea in August as part of the 474th Fighter Bomber Wing, engaging in combat operations from Kunsan Air Base (K-8). From Kunsan the squadron bombed and strafed bridges, bunkers, troop concentrations, artillery positions, and a host of other enemy targets. Moved to Taegu Air Base (K-2) in April 1953 being attached to the 58th Fighter-Bomber Wing.  Flew interdiction and close air support missions in as well as attacking special strategic targets such as military schools, dams, and port facilities in North Korea until the June 1953 Armistice, Remained in South Korea for over a year afterward to insure Communist compliance with the cease-fire.\nCold War\nReturned to Clovis Air Force Base, New Mexico in November 1954. Redesignated the 430th Tactical Fighter Squadron on 1 July 1958. Squadron was re-equipped with North American F-86H Sabre fighter-bomber aircraft, being assigned to Twelfth Air Force, Tactical Air Command.

Deployed to southeastern United States during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.\nMoved to Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada in 1966 as part of the 474th Tactical Fighter Wing (TFW). The 474th (Roadrunners) became the first USAF operational wing equipped with the General Dynamics F-111. On 20 January 1968 the 474th Tactical Fighter Wing was activated at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada from the 4480th TFW, giving the base an operational tactical fighter wing assigned to Twelfth Air Force. On 15 September 1968 the 430th TFS became part of the Wing.\nVietnam War\nDeployed to Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand in September 1972 as a result of the North Vietnamese Easter Offensive as part of the Constant Guard V deployment of the 429th TFS and 430th TFS with 24 F-111As in each squadron. The deployment included 1,487 support personnel and 40 transport aircraft loads of cargo. The enhanced strike capabilities of the two F-111A squadrons (48 aircraft) allowed them to replace the four F-4D squadrons (72 aircraft) of the 49 TFW, which returned to the U.S. This move also resulted in a reduction of total U.S. forces stationed in Thailand. The two F-111A squadrons arrived to support the last month of Operation Linebacker and all of the Operation Linebacker II bombing offensive against North Vietnam, conducted combat operations over Laos including support of Operation Phou Phiang II and Operation Phou Phiang III using the F-111A's beacon bombing capability in the defense of Long Tieng, and conducted combat operations over Cambodia, again using the F-111A's beacon bombing capability. They flew deep interdiction strike in good and bad weather when other squadrons were grounded. 430th TFS flew approximately 2,000 combat missions with excellent success rates in hitting targets even when visibility was near zero before returning to the United States on 22 March 1973. A total of four 430th TFS aircraft were lost in action with the loss of all crews. The 474th was awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award with Combat \"V\" Device 28 Sep 1972-22 Feb 1973 and Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm 28 Sep 1972-22 Feb 1973.\nPost Vietnam War\nEngaged in training new pilots with the F-111A during the mid-1970s, changing equipment to the McDonnell F-4D Phantom II in August 1977 during \"Operation Ready Switch\", sending the F-111As to the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing at Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho and sending the F-111Fs from Mountain Home to Lakenheath Air Base in England to replace the departing F-4Ds.

Inactivated 1 July 1989.\nElectronic combat\nReactivated at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico as the 430th Electronic Combat Squadron on 1 August 1992 in conjunction with the realignment of all General Dynamics EF-111A Raven Electronic Warfare aircraft from Mountain Home to Cannon.  Relieved aircraft and trained 27th Operations Group personnel in operational use.   Once the move was completed the 430th was inactivated on 29 June 1993 and squadron personnel and aircraft were transferred to the 429th Electronic Combat Squadron.\nat Kandahar International Airport in April 2019.]]\nThe squadron was redesignated the 430th Expeditionary Electronic Combat Squadron on 13 February 2013 and reactivated at Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan on 20 February 2013, when it replaced the 451st Air Expeditionary Wing's tactical airborne gateway, which had been operating since 2006. The unit flies the Northrop Grumman E-11 aircraft. The mission of the E-11A is to serve as a Battlefield Airborne Communications Node, a communications system that provides voice and data connectivity across the battlespace for air and surface operators.\nOn 27 January 2020, a United States Air Force E-11A aircraft (serial number 11–9358) belonging to 430th Expeditionary Electronic Combat Squadron crashed in Afghanistan's Dih Yak District, Ghazni Province.
