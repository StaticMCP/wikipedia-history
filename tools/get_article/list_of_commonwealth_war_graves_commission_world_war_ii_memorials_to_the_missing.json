This is a listing of those memorials maintained solely or jointly by the CWGC that commemorate by name the British and Commonwealth dead from World War II whose bodies were not recovered, or whose remains could not be identified.  Also included here are memorials to those who were cremated, and the Rolls of Honour that commemorate land and naval losses of undivided India during the Second World War. This listing is of the CWGC memorials with over 4000 names commemorated. The total number of names inscribed on the memorials or rolls of honour listed here, according to the CWGC figures given in the table below, is 188,971.\nList of memorials\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin: auto auto\"\n|+ Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) World War II memorials\n!Article and reference!!class=\"unsortable\"|Picture!!Country!!class=\"unsortable\"|Location!!class=\"unsortable\"|Co-ordinates!!Number listed!!class=\"unsortable\"|Description of those listed!!class=\"unsortable\"|Dates covered!!class=\"unsortable\"|Major battles!!Date unveiled!!class=\"unsortable\"|Memorial designer!!class=\"unsortable\"|Memorial unveiled by\n|-\n| Rangoon Memorial\n[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/100/RANGOON%20MEMORIAL CWGC]\n|  || Myanmar || Taukkyan ||  || 26,851 || Commonwealth nations|| January 1942 to July 1945 || Burma Campaign ||  || Henry J.
