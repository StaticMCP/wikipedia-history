Woodward won the Grey Cup as a member of the Ottawa Rough Riders in 1973 and 1976. In 2009 he was sentenced to jail for \"stealing $185,000 from two elderly clients to pay gambling debts\" but his wife believes that this may have been a consequence of injuries he suffered during his football career.  He died in 2016 after a fall, having experienced the effects of dementia in his later years.\nHead coaching record\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.cflapedia.com/Players/w/woodward_rod.htm CFLapedia bio]\n*[http://www.justsportsstats.com/footballstatsindex.php?player_id=woodwrod001&kretsort=4 Stats Crew profile]"
