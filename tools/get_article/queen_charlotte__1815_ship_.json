From 1819 she traded with Brazil and Argentina and was burnt at Buenos Aires on 25 July 1822.\nOrigins\nQueen Charlotte first appeared in the Register of Shipping (RS) in 1815 and in ''Lloyd's Register (LR) in 1816. However,  they reported that she had been launched in 1790 or 1801. Her size, launch years, the timing of her appearance in the registers is consistent with her being the Queen Charlotte that sank after a collision in 1813. It would require original research perhaps to settle the matter.\nCareer\n{| class=\" wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Master\n! Owner\n! Trade\n!
