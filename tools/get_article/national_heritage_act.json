One of the primary drivers for the Act was the public controversy relating to the refusal of the Callaghan government to accept an offer of Mentmore Towers and its contents in lieu of inheritance tax.\nNational Heritage Act 1983\nThe National Heritage Act 1983 (c. 47) established the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Science Museum, the Armouries and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew as non-departmental public bodies to be governed by boards of trustees.\nSection 30 of the act made provision for the designation and funding of the Armed Forces Museums.\nPrior to 1982, other British ancient or historical monuments and buildings had been protected through the Department of the Environment. This was felt by the ruling Conservative government to be lacking in public respect and to be excessively expensive. The 1983 Act created the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission (HBMC), another non-departmental public body, to be given the a broad remit of managing the historic built environment of England. After the passing of the act, the HBMC was given the shorter working name of English Heritage, by which it was commonly known until 2015. After 2015, the body was divided into two parts, with the Commission being renamed Historic England. English Heritage remained as a charitable organisation, looking after the National Heritage Collection including properties like Audley End and Kenwood House.\nNational Heritage (Scotland) Act 1985\nThe National Heritage (Scotland) Act 1985 (c. 16) followed the National Galleries of Scotland Act 1906 and established boards of trustees responsible for the Royal Scottish Museum, The National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland and the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh. It made more provision for the boards of trustees for National Galleries of Scotland and the National Library of Scotland.\nNational Heritage Act 1997\nThe National Heritage Act 1997 (c. 14) amended the 1980 act by extending the scope of the National Heritage Memorial Fund to include things of any kind which are of scenic, historic, archaeological, aesthetic, architectural, engineering, artistic or scientific interest, including animals and plants which are of zoological or botanical interest.\nIt also modified the 1983 act, inserting section 31A to make specific provision for preservation of the Royal Naval College site.\nNational Heritage Act 2002\nThe National Heritage Act 2002 (c. 14) extended the powers of the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission to encompass underwater archaeology within the territorial waters of the United Kingdom.\nSee also\n* Listed building\n* Scheduled monument\n* National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens\n* Protection of Wrecks Act 1973\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/17/contents National Heritage Act 1980]\n* [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1983/47/contents National Heritage Act 1983]\n* [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/14/contents National Heritage Act 1997]\n* [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/14/contents National Heritage Act 2002]"
