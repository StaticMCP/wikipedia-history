Gen. Sterling Price, commanding the Army of the West, thus to prevent Ulysses S. Grant's reinforcing Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell in Tennessee, Brig. Gen. Frank C. Armstrong's cavalry brigade struck Col. Elias S. Dennis's Federal force of two cavalry troops, a battery and two infantry regiments. After four hours, in which they suffered heavy losses while taking 213 prisoners, and two field pieces, the raiders withdrew, their mission accomplished.\nReferences\n* [https://www.battlefields.org/visit/heritage-sites/britton-lane-battlefield Britton Lane American Battlefield Trust]\nExternal links\n* [http://www.brittonlane1862.madison.tn.us/ Britton's Lane Battlefield Association]  Retrieved: 2008-11-04.\n* [http://www.bigblackcreekhistorical.com/ Big Black Creek Historical Association Website] Retrieved: 2011-10-08."
