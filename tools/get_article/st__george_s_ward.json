It existed until 1972 when it merged with By Ward to become By-St. George's Ward. It was recreated in 1980, until it was abolished for a final time in 1994, when it merged with part of By-Rideau Ward to form Bruyère-Strathcona Ward.\nFor much of its history, St. George's consisted of Ottawa's Sandy Hill neighbourhood. Its second incarnation also consisted of Old Ottawa East.\nReferences"
