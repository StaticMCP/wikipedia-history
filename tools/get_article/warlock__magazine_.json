The primary focus of the magazine was fantasy, with emphasis on the Fighting Fantasy adventure gamebook series.\nPublication history\nThe magazine was established by Fighting Fantasy creators Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone, running for 13 issues from 1984 until December 1986. Jackson and Livingstone were the editors until issue 10 and then editors-in-chief, with Marc Gascoigne as editor. The desk editor for the first five issues was Philippa Dickinson. Warlock was published in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. A Japanese edition of the magazine was expanded to a general RPG publication where the title had an extended run before ceasing publication in 1997.\nRegular features included announcements, cartoons, competitions, interviews, maps of the Fighting Fantasy world, mini-adventures including abbreviated versions of Caverns of the Snow Witch  and House of Hell with different artwork, a monster bestiary (becoming the basis for the Fighting Fantasy title Out of the Pit) and miniature figure tutorials.\nMini-adventures\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
