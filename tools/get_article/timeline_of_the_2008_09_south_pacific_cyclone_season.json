The season officially ran from November 1, 2008 to April 30, 2009 with the first disturbance of the season forming on December 1 and the last disturbance moving out of the region on April 11.\nFor the fourth season in a row tropical cyclone activity in the South Pacific was below its climatological average of nine tropical cyclones, with only six tropical cyclones occurring within the region. The most damaging tropical disturbance was Tropical Depression 04F which also was the deadliest tropical disturbance occurring during the season. The depression caused $ (2009&nbsp;USD; $}} &nbsp;USD) in damage and killed twelve people when it caused the worst economic natural disaster in Viti Levu since the drought of 1998.\nDuring the season tropical cyclones were monitored by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji, and the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) in Wellington, New Zealand. RSMC Nadi attached a number and an F suffix to tropical disturbances that formed in or moved into the South Pacific. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also issued unofficial warnings throughout during the season, designating tropical cyclones with a number and a P suffix. RSMC Nadi and TCWC Wellington both use the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale, and measured windspeeds over a period of ten minutes, while the JTWC measured sustained winds over a period of one minute and uses the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale.\nThis timeline includes information from post-storm reviews by RSMC Nadi, TCWC Wellington and the JTWC. It documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. Reports among warning centers often differ; as such, information from all three agencies has been included.\nTimeline of storms\nNovember\n;November 1\n*0000 UTC, (1200 FST)&nbsp;– The 2008–09 South
