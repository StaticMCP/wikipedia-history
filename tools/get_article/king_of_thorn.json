It was published by Enterbrain in the seinen magazine Monthly Comic Beam between October 2002 and October 2005 and collected in six bound volumes. It is licensed in North America by Tokyopop, with the final volume published in November 2008. The series is about a group of people who are put in suspended animation to escape a mysterious plague that turns people to stone, and upon waking there appears to be only seven survivors in a world run wild—including a Japanese teenage girl named Kasumi Ishiki and a British man named Marco Owen. The survivors soon discover that the entire ruin is filled with strange, dinosaur-like creatures and other monstrous aberrations of nature. Thinking that a great amount of time passed since their arrival on the island, soon the survivors discover not only that their sleep was indeed too short to label such dramatic changes as natural occurrence, but also that the situation in and of itself is far greater than they could imagine.\nA feature anime film adaptation produced by Sunrise and directed by Kazuyoshi Katayama was released on May 1, 2010.\nPlot\nKing of Thorn is a science fiction survivor drama.\n|OriginalISBN = 4-7577-1380-0\n|LicensedRelDate = 2007-06-01\n|LicensedISBN = 978-1-59816-235-6\n|ChapterList =\n* 01. \"The Chosen Ones\"\n* 02. \"The People Trapped by Thorns\"\n* 03. \"That Day\"\n* 04. \"Face the Future\"\n* 05. \"The Thorn Girl\"\n* Postscript\n|VolumeExtras =\n|Summary =\n}}\n|OriginalISBN = 4-7577-1585-4\n|LicensedRelDate = 2007-10-09\n|LicensedISBN = 978-1-59816-236-3\n|ChapterList =\n* 06. \"Beyond the Dark Water\"\n* 07. \"One Down\"\n* 08. \"A Step to the Truth\"\n* 09. \"Level 4\"\n* 10. \"The Beat of Battle\"\n* 11. \"The Crown of Crosses and Thorns\"\n* Postscript\n|VolumeExtras =\n|Summary =\n}}\n|OriginalISBN = 4-7577-1770-9\n|LicensedRelDate = 2008-02-05\n|LicensedISBN = 978-1-59816-237-0\n|ChapterList =\n* 12. \"The Ends of the World\"\n* 13. \"Deep Rift\"\n* 14. \"Dangerous Place\"\n* 15. \"What Really Happened That Day\"\n* 16. \"The Secrets of the Water\"\n* 17. \"The Rules of Trust\"\n* Postscript\n|VolumeExtras =\n|Summary =\n}}\n|OriginalISBN = 4-7577-1987-6\n|LicensedRelDate = 2008-05-06\n|LicensedISBN = 978-1-59816-238-7\n|ChapterList =\n* 18. \"The Truth Behind Medusa\"\n* 19. \"Freefall\"\n* 20. \"Marco's Enemy\"\n* 21. \"The Bird to the Cage, Part 1\"\n* 22. \"The Bird to the Cage, Part 2\"\n* 23. \"The Bird to the Cage, Part 3\"\n* 24. \"Open Wound\"\n* Postscript\n|VolumeExtras =\n|Summary =\n}}\n|OriginalISBN = 4-7577-2303-2\n|LicensedRelDate = 2008-08-05\n|LicensedISBN = 978-1-4278-0010-7\n|ChapterList =\n* 25. \"Loss\"\n* 26. \"A Part of the Heart\"\n* 27. \"Reunion with the Nemesis\"\n* 28. \"Alice's World\"\n* 29. \"Weakness and Reality\"\n* 30. \"Shizuku's Existence\"\n* 31. \"Conceit\"\n* Postscript\n|VolumeExtras =\n|Summary =\n}}\n|OriginalISBN = 4-7577-2478-0\n|LicensedRelDate = 2008-11-04\n|LicensedISBN = 978-1-4278-0011-4\n|ChapterList =\n* 32. \"Marco's Death\"\n* 33. \"Reunion\"\n* 34. \"Resurrection\"\n* 35. \"The Final Fight\"\n* 36. \"Deep Thrench\"\n* Final. \"Beyond the Emotions\"\n* Bonus. \"Now What?\"\n|VolumeExtras =\n|Summary =\n}}\nThe Japanese volume 4 was also released in a special edition () including a limited edition figurine of Kasumi.\nFilm\nAn anime film adaptation produced by Kadokawa Pictures premiered in October 2009 at the Sitges Film Festival and was released in theaters in Japan on May 1, 2010, in Japan and was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in Japan on October 27, 2010, and worldwide in November 2010. The film was directed by Kazuyoshi Katayama from a script written by Katayama and Hiroshi Yamaguchi, with characters designed by Hidenori Matsubara and monsters designed by Kenji Andou.\nThe film retains the same characters from the manga, but it takes major liberties when it comes to the plot and storyline. All of the main characters' backstories are drained down and their different storylines are changed from their counterparts in the manga. Zeus, who is a major antagonist in the manga, does not appear in the film. Alice, the young Russian girl, does make an appearance, but is deceased in present time. Terry Notary (In the English Dub) portrays the monsters in his CGI suit while Toru Nara (In the Japanese Dub) voices them. The film also has a different ending from the manga.\nThe ending song for the film is \"Edge of This World\" by Misia.\nThe anime has been licensed by Funimation Entertainment in North America, Manga Entertainment in the UK and Madman Entertainment in Australia and New Zealand.\nReception\nThe English edition of King of Thorn was named by the Young Adult Library Services Association as among the 10 best graphic novels for teens for 2008. Volume one was praised by Publishers Weekly as \"a gripping entry in the genre of violent survivor manga,\" and praised Iwahara's art for conveying the character's claustrophobia without confusing the reader. Theron Martin of Anime News Network found both the writing and artwork effectively convey the characters' tension and danger, but claimed that Iwahara's borrowing elements from many sources did not initially create an original work, but that as the series progresses it \"offer[s] some intriguing twists on sci fi and horror gimmicks.\" Iwahara's art was singled out for praise, especially for conveying action scenes. The film was nominated for the 4th Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Animated Feature Film.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
