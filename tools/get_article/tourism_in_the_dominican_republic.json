More than 10 million tourists visited the Dominican Republic in 2023, making it the most popular tourist destination in the Caribbean and putting it in the top 5 overall in the Americas. The industry accounts for 11.6% of the nation's GDP and is a particularly important source of revenue in coastal areas of the country. The nation's tropical climate, white sand beaches, diverse mountainous landscape and colonial history attracts visitors from around the world. In 2022, the nation's tourism was named the best-performing nation since the height of the pandemic with over 5% visitors more in comparison to pre-pandemic levels in 2019.\nAs one of the most geographically diverse nations in the region, the Dominican Republic is home to Pico Duarte, the Caribbean's tallest mountain peak, and Lake Enriquillo, its largest lake and lowest elevation. The earliest cathedral, castle, monastery and fortress built in all of the Americas is located in Santo Domingo's Colonial Zone, an area declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nHistory of tourism in the Dominican Republic\n]]Due to political conflicts and warfare that had been present throughout most of the country's history, tourism was not common in the Dominican Republic until the 1930s. Rafael Leonidas Trujillo's rise to power represented a turning point for this facet of the economy. During the 1940s, the Trujillo government initiated the development of eight government-owned-and-operated resorts in the capital of Ciudad Trujillo (now Santo Domingo) to foster the growth of a tourism industry. The most famous of these developments was the Hotel Jaragua, which gathered international attention for its luxury, alongside the Malecón de Santo Domingo in 1942. Many of the hotels built during this time remain open and include: the Hotel Provincial, which is now a children's hospital; the Hotel la Paz, now known as the Hotel Hispaniola; and the Hotel Comercial in the Colonial Zone, which was the first privately owned hotel in the country.\nHotel development was not limited to the capital. Several provincial capitals were the site of Trujillo's public works projects. These included the Hotel Matún in Santiago de los Caballeros, the Hotel Guarocuya in Barahona, the Hotel Maguana in San Juan de la Maguana, and the Hotel Montaña in Jarabacoa. The building of the Hotel Macori in the San Pedro de Macorís Province was the first development in the eastern end of the country, which has now become the country's main tourist destination.\nIn 1955, the Fair of Peace and Fraternity of the Free World (Feria de la Paz y Confraternidad del Mundo Libre) was organized in Ciudad Trujillo, to honour the 25th year of Trujillo's rule. The event was intended to attract international visitors and showcase the development of the country's tourism industry, but attendance was below expectations and foreign investments failed to materialize.\nIn the 1950s, construction of the Las Américas International Airport took place, along with highway systems to connect it to the capital and better accommodate the country's growing number of tourists. The Cuban Revolution and resultant embargo served to redirect American tourists to Ciudad Trujillo as the Latin American tourism destination of choice. Conversely, political instability and social unrest in the wake of the assassination of the Mirabal Sisters in 1960, the assassination of Trujillo in 1961, and the Dominican Civil War of 1965 and subsequent US military occupation, led to a notable decrease in tourism.\nIn the post-civil war era, the tourism industry of the country saw an upswing through increased government attention and changes in economic policies. In 1971, the Tourist Incentive Law (Law 153) was passed to create the department for the Development of Tourism Infrastructure (INFRATUR). Its aims were to promote infrastructure projects, encourage private investment, and cooperate with the Ministry of Tourism to further grow the tourism industry. By encouraging private investment through low-interest loans, the Dominican Republic underwent two distinct periods of hotel and resort building that increased the number of hotel rooms from 1,134 in 1970 to over 20,000 by 1990. The country also saw the number of tourists increase from 278,000 in 1975 to over one million visitors by 1987, surpassing traditional Caribbean resort locations.\nTourism in the present day\nFrom the 1990s, the Dominican tourism industry has been developed and operated at its fullest, developing more housing complexes, through agreements and foreign advisors. Consequently, the number of hotel rooms in the decade of the 1980s was about 8,562 and the 1990s was 45,000.\nIn 1997, around 270,830 foreign tourists arrived by sea, of which 156,099 used the ports in Santo Domingo, 5,566 arrived via the port of Puerto Plata, 108,698 disembarked in La Romana, 404 in Samaná and 63 in Boca Chica. This figure compared with those of 1996, it shows that in 1997 the number of foreign visitors who used the waterway increased by over one hundred percent.\nIn 1996 entered to the country by sea 110.936, an amount that increased to 270,380 cruise passengers. Despite not having any financial incentive for ecotourism, this is in its true splendor. It posed above is confirmed by the annual statistics for visitation to ecotourism businesses and protected areas, which exceed 800,000 people. It quote the following data, for the year 1998: total visitors to ecotourism projects was 930,000.\nIncreasing competition, for example created by the Asian markets, and a change in the motivation of tourists, now forces authorities managing regions, and tour operators to supplement their offer with new options, not based directly on the sun, sand and sea. Additionally, some Asian markets, for example Thailand, have a very reasonable tax rate for tourist consumption (7%), whereas the Dominican Republic has an extremely high rate (18 to 28%). It has been argued that the Dominican Republic should focus on diversifying its tourism product, so as to prevent elimination from the market by competitors when tourists completely change their preferences by shifting, for example, from 3S to 3E and to focus on industrial and cultural tours such as the road tar mine at la quenera, approximately 10&nbsp;km south of the Haitian boarder.\nVisitor statistics\nImageSize=width:270 height:300\nPlotArea=left:60 bottom:75 top:10 right:16\nAlignBars=justify\nPeriod=from:0 till:900\nTimeAxis=orientation:horizontal\nColors=\nid:gray value:gray(0.5)\nid:line1 value:gray(0.9)\nid:line2 value:gray(0.7)\nScaleMajor=unit:year increment:200 start:0 gridcolor:line2\nScaleMinor=unit:year increment:200 start:0 gridcolor:line1\nBarData=\nbar:January text:January\nbar:February text:February\nbar:March text:March\nbar:April text:April\nbar:May text:May\nbar:June text:June\nbar:July text:July\nbar:August text:August\nbar:September text:September\nbar:October text:October\nbar:November text:November\nbar:December text:December\nPlotData=\ncolor:tan1 width:10\nbar:January from:start till:742 text:\nbar:February from:start till:756 text:\nbar:March from:start till:837 text:\nbar:April from:start till:704 text:\nbar:May from:start till:677 text:\nbar:June from:start till:759 text:\nbar:July from:start till:811 text:\nbar:August from:start till:675 text:\nbar:September from:start till:469 text:\nbar:October from:start till:554 text:\nbar:November from:start till:667 text:\nbar:December from:start till:884 text:\nTextData=\npos:(50,37) textcolor:gray fontsize:M text:Tourist arrivals in 2024 (k)\nTextData=\npos:(50,20) textcolor:gray fontsize:M text:Source: Trading Economics /\nTextData=\npos:(50,3) textcolor:gray fontsize:M text:Central Bank of Dominican Republic\n{| cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"10\" style=\"border:solid 1px #aaa\"\n|+Yearly tourist arrivals in millions\n|\nImageSize  = width:auto height:150 barincrement:18\nPlotArea   = left:50 bottom:15 top:10 right:20\nAlignBars  = justify\nDateFormat = x.y\nPeriod     = from:0 till:9\nTimeAxis   = orientation:vertical\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:2 start:0\nPlotData=\ncolor:skyblue width:11\nbar:95 from:start till:1.78\nbar:96 from:start till:1.93\nbar:97 from:start till:2.21\nbar:98 from:start till:2.31\nbar:99 from:start till:2.65\nbar:00 from:start till:2.98\nbar:01 from:start till:2.88\nbar:02 from:start till:2.81\nbar:03 from:start till:3.28\nbar:04 from:start till:3.45\nbar:05 from:start till:3.69\nbar:06 from:start till:3.97\nbar:07 from:start till:3.98\nbar:08 from:start till:3.98\nbar:09 from:start till:3.99\nbar:10 from:start till:4.13\nbar:11 from:start till:4.31\nbar:12 from:start till:4.56\nbar:13 from:start till:4.69\nbar:14 from:start till:5.14\nbar:15 from:start till:5.6\nbar:16 from:start till:5.96\nbar:17 from:start till:6.19\nbar:18 from:start till:6.57\nbar:19 from:start till:6.45\nbar:20 from:start till:2.41\nbar:21 from:start till:4.99\nbar:22 from:start till:7.16\nbar:23 from:start till:8.06\nbar:24 from:start till:8.54\ncolor:powderblue width:11\n|}\nMost visitors arriving to Dominican Republic were from the following areas of residence or countries of nationality:\n:Note: Air arrivals only, it excludes arrivals by land and sea\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-style=\"color:white;\"\n!
