Greenstone was created from land formerly within Rocksberg.\nThe locality takes its name from Rocksberg Greenstone, a unique igneous rock type found in the area.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Greenstone. The nearest government primary school is Bellmere State School in Bellmere to the north-east. The nearest government secondary schools are Tullawong State High School in Caboolture to the north-east and Morayfield State High School in Morayfield to the east.\nReferences"
