      "text": "# Distinguished Honor Award\n\nThe Distinguished Honor Award is an award of the United States Department of State and USAID.  Similar versions of the same award existed for the former U.S. Information Agency and Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.  It is presented in recognition of exceptionally outstanding service or achievements of marked national or international significance.\nThe award consists of a gold medal set and a certificate signed, as appropriate, by the Secretary of State.  Due to the demanding nature of the criteria, the award is not routinely issued; only a few non-Ambassadorial rank Foreign Service Officers have ever received an individual award.\nCriteria\nThe following criteria are applicable to granting a Distinguished Honor Award:\n* Exceptionally outstanding service to the agencies or the U.S. Government resulting in achievements of marked national or international significance;\n* Exceptionally outstanding service and/or leadership in the administration of one or more agency programs that results in the highly successful accomplishment of mission, or in a major attainment of objectives or specific accomplishment to meet unique or emergency situations; and\n* Outstanding accomplishments over a prolonged period that involve the exercise of authority or judgment in the public interest.\nNominating and approval procedures\nNominations for State and USAID employees are submitted on Form JF-66, Nomination for Award, through supervisory channels to the Joint Country Awards Committee for review and recommendation to the Chief of Mission for final action.\nNominations initiated in Washington are submitted to the appropriate area awards committee for final action. For USAID, nominations initiated in Washington are reviewed by the USAID bureau/office with final approval by the appropriate assistant administrator or office head.\nMilitary use\nUpon authorization, members of the U.S. military may wear the medal and ribbon in the appropriate order of precedence as a U.S. non-military personal decoration.\nNotable recipients\n*Tex Harris, Foreign Service Officer\n*Peter W.
