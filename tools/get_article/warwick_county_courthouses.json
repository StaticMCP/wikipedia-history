The county moved its seat to the new location in 1810 and built a one-story, three-room, T-shaped plan Federal-style brick building. It has a slate-covered gable roof and exterior end chimneys, and it was later enlarged by a side and rear addition. As part of the Peninsula Campaign, on the afternoon of April 5, 1862, IV Corps under BG Erasmus D. Keyes reached and looted the Warwick County Courthouse.  The area used as a camp and division headquarters thereafter.  The observation balloon Constitution designed by Thaddeus S. C. Lowe was anchored at the courthouse for a time. The clerk’s office was burned on December 15, 1864, and the court minute books and loose records from 1787 to 1819 were destroyed. Other records sent to Richmond, Virginia for safekeeping during the civil war were lost in the fire there on April 3, 1865.\nThe later courthouse was built in 1884 and is a two-story, Italianate-style brick building. It has a rectangular plan and a shallow, metal-covered, hipped roof with three shallow cross gables. It features a square wood bell cupola that rises above the central projecting bay. In 1888, the county court relocated for a short period to an area in what is now downtown Newport News. It was moved back to this location in 1896 when Newport News became an independent city. The buildings housed county offices until 1958, when Warwick County, Virginia was combined with the City of Newport News.\nOn the property was a Confederate monument for the Warwick Beauregards, dedicated in May 1909.   In August 2020, the City of Newport News voted to remove the monument, and it was removed shortly thereafter.\nThe Courthouses were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.\nCourthouse area, 1880s-1950s\nDirectly across the street from the courthouse, Levin Smith built a 16-room hotel (''Smith's Hotel'') and James T. Garrow built a general store in 1883.  The hotel would house lawyers and judges while court was in session.  The hotel operated up till shortly after 1909, when proprietor Levin Smith died. Afterwards it became a private home.  The general store was destroyed by fire in the mid 1950s and not rebuilt. The hotel building was torn down in 1985.\nSee also\n* Warwick Town\n* Warwick County, Virginia\n* City of Warwick, Virginia\n* Denbigh, Virginia\nReferences"
