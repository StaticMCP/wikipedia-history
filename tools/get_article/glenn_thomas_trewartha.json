He is best known for his eponymous Trewartha climate classification, an expanded and modified version of the Köppen–Geiger system.\nHe graduated from the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison, with a Ph.D. in 1924. He taught at the University of Wisconsin.\nHe gave an address to the Association of American Geographers, \"A Case for Population Geography\", in which he argued that \"fundamentally geography is anthropocentric, and if such is the case, that numbers,  densities  and  qualities  of  the population provide the essential background for all geography. Population provide the essential background for  all  geography.  Population  is  the  point  of  reference  from  which  all  other  elements  are observed, and from which they all singly and collectively derive   significance   and   meaning\". He also wrote about climate, explaining that the atmosphere was like \"a pane of glass in a greenhouse... thus maintaining surface temperatures considerably higher than they otherwise would be.\"\nAwards\n*1926 Guggenheim Fellowship\nWorks\n* \"The earliest map of Galena, Illinois\" Wisconsin Magazine Of History.
