It is approximately 340&nbsp;km NW from Islamabad, the federal capital of Pakistan.\nThe total electricity generation capacity of the Duber Khwar project is 130 MW. There are two vertical Pelton wheel turbine units of 65 MW installed at the Duber Khwar Hydroelectric Station. These turbines are manufactured by Andritz Hydro Austria. Andritz Hydro Austria supplied and installed the complete electro-mechanical equipment and services with a focus on its \"water to wire\" concept. The supplies consisted of two 65 MW Pelton-type turbines with a rated head of 516 m, associated generators and generator auxiliaries and the complete electrical power systems.\nConstruction of the Duber Khwar Hydropower Plant commenced in June 2003, and the project was completed in June 2013. The plant began commercial operations in January 2014. The total cost of the project was about PKR 16.325&nbsp;billion. At its completion, the Duber Khwar hydropower project was projected to generate 595 million units of low-cost hydel electricity per annum.\nDam\nType: Concrete gravity damLength: 202&nbsp;m.Height: 40.5&nbsp;m.Design Discharge: 29 cusecsHeadrace tunnel length: 4.873&nbsp;kmDesign head: 535&nbsp;m.\nSee also\n* Allai Khwar Hydropower Plant\n* Gomal Zam Dam\n* List of dams and reservoirs in Pakistan\n* List of power stations in Pakistan\n* Satpara Dam\nReferences"
