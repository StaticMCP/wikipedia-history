However,  there was a decline in immigration after U.S. Congress began to limit the numbers of individuals  immigrating. The numbers of Irish immigrants began to increase again after World War II.\nMost Irish who came to the United States settled in urban areas. Many of these neighborhoods retain aspects of Irish culture, especially around the local Catholic church.\nWords and songs from Ireland have come into common American usage. Common words used in the English language that have Irish origin include galore, hooligan, phony, slob, and whiskey.\nRecently, Irish dancing, which has existed in pockets in the U.S., has become popular as a stage performance, with dancers from Ireland touring the United States.\nSee also\n* Irish American\n* Scotch-Irish American\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Rotman, Deborah L. \"The fighting Irish: historical archaeology of nineteenth-century Catholic immigrant experiences in South Bend, Indiana.\" Historical Archaeology 44 (2010): 113-131.
