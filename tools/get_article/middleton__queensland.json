In the , the locality of Middleton had a population of 45 people.\nGeography\nThe locality is on the Kennedy Developmental Road,  northwest of the state capital Brisbane and  southeast of the regional centre of Mount Isa.\nLying within the locality is the former site of Collingwood (), a town that lost out in regional competition to its neighbour, Winton. It had been given up by about 1900.\nThe region in which Middleton lies is a circular zone that has been shown to be a crustal anomaly. Scientists from Geoscience Australia believe that it is an impact structure formed by an asteroid that struck the area about 300 million years ago. Final proof of this as the anomaly's genesis has not yet been found.\nHistory\nEuropean exploration of the Middleton area began with explorer John McKinlay's expedition in search of the missing Burke and Wills expedition in 1862. McKinlay named a watercourse in the area Middleton Creek after his second-in-charge Thomas Middleton.\nThe Middleton Hotel was established at the creek crossing as a Cobb & Co changing station on the route between Winton and Boulia.\nMiddleton Provisional School opened in 1908 and closed in 1913. Another Middleton Provisional School opened in 1937 and closed circa 1943.\nMiddleton Post Office opened by March 1916 (a receiving office had been open from 1889) and closed in 1968.\nThe 2016 film Goldstone was filmed in Middleton.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Middleton and the surrounding area had a population of 121 people.\nIn the , the locality of Middleton had a population of 9 people.\nIn the , the locality of Middleton had a population of 45 people.\nHeritage listings\nThe Elderslie Homestead () on the Winton-Boulia Road is a heritage-listed site.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Middleton. The nearest primary and secondary school is Winton State School in Winton to the east, but is too distant for a daily commute.  Distance education and boarding school are the alternatives.\nFacilities\nThe town has been mostly abandoned and now consists of the Middleton Hotel, campground and the disused hall.\nReferences"
