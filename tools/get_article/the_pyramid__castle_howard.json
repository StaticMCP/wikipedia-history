It was built in 1728, and was probably designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor. Hawksmoor had already built a pyramid in nearby Pretty Wood, and in 1732 proposed one clad in copper or silver, which remained unbuilt. It was grade I listed in 1954. In 2015 it was restored, the work including rebuilding the apex, replacing vermiculated stone, and cleaning and repointing the facades.\nThe pyramid and the surrounding piers are built of limestone. The central pyramid, with sides of about , stands on a low podium, with some vermiculated rustication. The four surrounding piers each has a square base on a plinth, with a hollow column pierced by oval apertures, and surmounted by a stepped capital. Inside the period is a beehive vault containing a large, flat bust of Lord William Howard.\nSee also\n*Grade I listed buildings in North Yorkshire (district)\n*Listed buildings in Henderskelfe\nReferences"
