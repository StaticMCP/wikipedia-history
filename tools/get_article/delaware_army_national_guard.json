National coordination of various state National Guard units are maintained through the National Guard Bureau.\nThe Delaware Army National Guard maintains 15 armories in 12 communities.\nDelaware Army National Guard units are trained and equipped as part of the United States Army.  The same ranks and insignia are used and National Guardsmen are eligible to receive all United States military awards. The Delaware Guard also bestows a number of state awards for local services rendered in or to the state of Delaware.\nHistory\nThe Delaware Army National Guard traces its origins back to August 31, 1655, when Swedish settlers were asked to take up arms to defend the colony against a Dutch attack on Fort Christina.\nDuring the American Revolution, Delaware's First Regiment fought with General George Washington at the Battle of Long Island.\nIn the War of 1812 all Delaware volunteer units saw service at Lewes, where they comprised the bulk of force that drove off a British naval squadron seeking control of the Delaware River. The 198th Signal Battalion (DE ARNG), which traces its lineage to three militia units that were federalized during the War of 1812, is one of only nineteen Army National Guard units with campaign credit for the War of 1812.\nIn the Mexican War (1846–1847), the Federal Government would not accept volunteer companies but the Delaware volunteers were not content to stay home. After much red tape, a statewide composite unit was formed. They fought with distinction in the battles of Contreras, Cherubusco, Molino del Ray and Chapultepec where there were almost twice as many Delaware volunteers present as marines. The unit lost so many men in these actions it became known as \"The Bloody 11th.\"\nThe Militia Act of 1903 organized the various state militias into the present National Guard system.\nOne of the units formed since was the 198th Coast Artillery (AA), which traces its history to the three militia units referred to above. During this time, the Distinctive Insignia was designed and introduced. Designed by PVT T.S. Passwaters in 1905, the Distinctive Insignia depicts a crudely drawn Griffin, a nod to the rich history and tradition of the state of Delaware.\nIn response to the Wilmington riot of 1968, following the April 4 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Wilmington Mayor John Babiarz asked Governor Charles L. Terry Jr. for support from the National Guard. One week later, Mayor Babiarz requested the National Guard troops be withdrawn, but Governor Terry refused, and kept them in the city until his term ended in January, 1969. This is reportedly the longest occupation of an American city by state forces in the nation's history. In the aftermath of the occupation, recruiting offices of all military branches were removed from locations within the city limits until the early 2000s.\nIn the 1980s, aviation regiments began forming in both the regular Army and the National Guard. On 1 October 1986, the 44th Aviation Battalion was constituted in the Delaware and Illinois Army National Guard. It was concurrently organized from new and existing units with Headquarters at Peoria, Illinois. The 150th Aviation Regiment was created in Delaware from the 150th Aviation Battalion of the 50th Armored Division.\nFollowing the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, numerous units of the Delaware Army National Guard have deployed to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.\nTroops from both the Delaware Army and Air National Guard volunteered to support disaster relief operations in Louisiana and Mississippi in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\"Operation Arctic Vengeance I and II\" saw over 300 DEARNG Soldiers volunteer to support the State of Emergency declared by Gov. Jack Markell following a pair of debilitating snowstorms from Feb. 7 through Feb. 12, 2010.  DEARNG troops completed over 250 missions assisting local and state agencies with including Emergency Medical Services, fire calls, law enforcement, dialysis patient transport and civilian transport to warming stations.\nNational Guard units can be mobilized at any time by presidential order to supplement regular armed forces, and upon declaration of a state of emergency by the governor of the state in which they serve.\nUnits c.2012\n*Joint Forces Headquarters - a Detachment-sized unit which comprises the Headquarters elements of both Army and Air National Guards for the state.\n*261st Theater Tactical Signal Brigade\n** Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC) - Deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom at Camp Victory, Iraq from October 2008 through September 2009.\n**198th Signal Battalion - deployed to Iraq in October 2006; scheduled 12-month deployment.
