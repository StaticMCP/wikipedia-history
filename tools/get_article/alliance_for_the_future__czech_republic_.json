It considers itself to be successor of the previous Civic Democratic Alliance. It was established in September 2016 by current leader Pavel Sehnal, and former Prime Minister Petr Nečas is also involved with the party. The party participated in the 2017 legislative election and plans to participate in the 2018 municipal election. The leaders of the original Civic Democratic Alliance are not involved with the party.\nIdeology\nODA is a conservative-liberal centre-right party. It supports the European Union and multiculturalism.\nHistory\nThe party was founded in December 2016 by Pavel Sehnal, CEO of SPGroup. The company is closely linked with the party and leading associates of the company became key members of the party. Sehnal said that the party is a successor to the original Civic Democratic Alliance.\nOn 29 June 2017, ODA announced Vratislav Kulhánek as its presidential candidate for the 2018 presidential election, and started gathering signatures.\nOn 17 July 2017, ODA announced that it would participate in the 2017 legislative election, co-operating with a political movement For Health and Sport.\nIn August 2017, ODA started working with a controversial YouTuber, Mikael Oganesjan, and controversial agency Plavec Media. This was criticised in the media. The negative response on social media caused Sehnal to end the collaboration.\nElection results\nChamber of Deputies\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Year\n! Leader\n!
