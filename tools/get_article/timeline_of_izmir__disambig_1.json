Before Dolabella's own death the year after, his assault, and particularly some damage he had inflicted on the city, was condemned at the time in Rome, including by Dolabella's father-in-law Cicero, who referred to the people of Smyrna as among Rome's \"most trusted and oldest allies\".\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"right\" style=\"background:White\"|Common Era||\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"right\" style=\"background:Purple\"|124||Emperor Hadrian visits Smyrna as part of his journeys across the Empire\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"right\" style=\"background:White\"|155 or 156 AD||Polycarp (Saint Polycarp of Smyrna) is martyrized by stabbing in the amphitheater of the city after attempts to burn him at the stake fails, and the account, \"The Martyrdom of Polycarp or the Letter to the Smyrneans\" becomes one of the fundamental sources among early Christian writings.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"right\" style=\"background:Purple\" |178||A violent earthquake shakes Smyrna to its cores, causing immense damage and casualties.

Venetians organize an alliance uniting several European parties (Sancta Unio), composed notably of the Knights Templar, which organizes five consecutive attacks on İzmir and the Western Anatolian coastline controlled by Turkish states. In between, it is the Turks who organize maritime raids directed at Aegean islands.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"right\" style=\"background:Red\" |1348||Umur Bey dies and his brother and successor Hızır Bey concludes on 18 August an agreement with the Sancta Unio which, following its approval by the Pope, gives the Knights Templar the right to control and use the port castle (Saint Peter, Okkale).\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"right\" style=\"background:White\" |1390||Ottoman sultan Bayezid I (the Thunderbolt) comes to İzmir shortly after he ascends the throne and smoothly captures the upper castle of Kadifekale.

At the same time, the European merchants which used the island and Çeşme across its shores as bases are tempted to seek a new port of trade and they are increasingly attracted to the small town of İzmir, administered at the level of a qadi instead of the stricter and more centralized authority of a pasha.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"right\" style=\"background:White\" |1592||Aydınoğlu Yakub Bey, a descendant of the formerly ruling dynasty, builds the oldest major Ottoman landmark in İzmir, the Hisar Mosque in Kemeraltı, adjacent to the decaying port castle of Okkale.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"right\" style=\"background:Red\" |1595||The practice of assigning Ottoman dynasty members for administration of neighboring Manisa and its dependencies is abandoned, largely due to the growing insecurity in the countryside, precursor of Jelali Revolts, and a violent earthquake in the valley of Gediz deals a severe blow to the region's prosperity the same year.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"right\" style=\"background:Manisa\" |1605||The first attested presence in community of Sephardi Jews, descendants of those evicted from Spain in 1492, in İzmir.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"right\" style=\"background:Red\" |1605–1606||İzmir is menaced by the Jelali Revolts of Kalenderoğlu, Arap Said and Canbolat.\n|-\n|}\nof the French Consul of İzmir in a 17th-century engraving by Jean du Mont]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=\"10%\"| Date||Occurrence\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"right\" style=\"background:Red\" |1619||The French consulate in İzmir opens, moving in from Sakız (Chios).\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"right\" style=\"background:White\" |1621||The English consulate in İzmir opens, moving in from Sakız (Chios).\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"right\" style=\"background:Red\" |1624–1626||İzmir is menaced by corsairs in three consecutive years, who leave each time after having levied a ransom, aggravating considerations for the city's safety.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"right\" style=\"background:White\" |1630s||Local warlord Cennetoğlu, a brigand (sometimes cited as one of the first in line in western Anatolia's long tradition of efes to come) who in the 1620s had assembled a vast company of disbanded Ottoman soldiers and renegades, establish control over much of the fertile land around Manisa and, often in pact with the influent western merchant Orlando, trigger a movement of more commercially sensitive Greek and Jewish populations towards İzmir\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"right\" style=\"background:Red\" |1650–1665\n|The construction by the Ottoman Empire of Sancakkale castle at a key location commanding access to the furthermost waters of the Gulf of İzmir, thus assuring İzmir's security and greatly improving its fortunes.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"right\" style=\"background:White\" |1657||Jean-Baptiste Tavernier visits İzmir for the second time and for a longer period.
