The party's 2000 presidential candidate would be entitled to $12.5 million (~$}} in ) in matching funds. Several high-profile candidates vied for the nomination, including future President Donald Trump, Pat Buchanan, and Transcendental Meditation leader John Hagelin. For a brief time, Congressman John B. Anderson and Congressman Ron Paul, who previously ran third party campaigns for President in 1980 and 1988 respectively, were considered potential candidates. Both Anderson and Paul ultimately declined to seek the nomination.\nThe party's 2000 candidates received a great deal of media attention, particularly after a dispute at the party's national convention in Long Beach, California led to a schism and the formation of a rebel faction. Supporters of Transcendental Meditation leader John Hagelin refused to accept Pat Buchanan as the party's chairman, and staged a walk-out, which was broadcast live on television.\nUltimately, a court decided Buchanan was the party's nominee. However, the drama surrounding the convention is often credited with leading to the downfall of the Reform Party. Ross Perot, Jesse Ventura, Pat Buchanan, Donald Trump, and other high-profile party members ultimately left the party after the 2000 election.\nThe campaign\nBuchanan enters race\nDuring the 1992 Republican Presidential Primaries, commentator Pat Buchanan fared extremely well and received 22.96% of the total vote. During his 1996 bid, Buchanan spent a brief time as the Republican front-runner; his campaign carried four states, including New Hampshire, Alaska, Missouri, and Louisiana. Buchanan re-entered the presidential race in 2000, hoping to be the primary \"Stop Bush\" candidate. He was, however, viewed much less favorably by his fellow Republicans, and he struggled to place fifth during an Iowa Straw Poll.\nReform Party member William von Raab launched a \"Draft Buchanan\" movement, and in October 1999 Buchanan announced his departure from the Republican Party, disparaging them (along with the Democrats) as a \"beltway party.\" He announced that he would seek the presidential nomination of the Reform Party, and immediately sought to align himself with the \"Russ Verney faction\" of the party. Some in the Reform Party voiced concerns that Buchanan, ardently pro-life and anti-gay rights, would inadvertently move the party too far to the right. During a meeting with Reform Party leadership at Pat Choate's Washington, D.C. home, Buchanan assured the party elite that his campaign would not address social issues, instead focusing on economic policy.\nAt the time Buchanan entered the race, the Reform Party was engulfed in a feud between the supporters of Ross Perot and newly elected Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, who, as the Reform Party's highest elected official, was rumored to be considering a presidential bid on the party ticket in 2004. Buchanan's campaign immediately aligned itself with diverse factions within the party, including Russ Verney and Marxist Lenora Fulani.\nOn November 12, 1999, Fulani formally endorsed Buchanan, saying: \"We are going to integrate that peasant army of his.  We are going to bring black folks, Latino folks, gay folks and liberal folks into that army...I'm going to take Pat Buchanan to 125th Street in Harlem.  We are going to have lunch at Sylvia's.  I am going to take him to speak at Reverend Sharpton's National Action Network.\" Fulani became Buchanan's campaign co-chair.\nAt the same time, the Buchanan campaign began to gain support among white nationalists. He gained the endorsement of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, who quit the Republican Party and joined the Reform Party to assist Buchanan's campaign. Almost all white nationalists left the Reform Party following the campaign; in 2004 the party nominated Lebanese-American Ralph Nader as its presidential candidate.\nTrump enters race\nSupporters of the Jesse Ventura faction began encouraging Donald Trump to enter the race, likely as a placeholder for Ventura, who said he would not consider a presidential bid until after his term as governor ended. On October 19, 1999, Donald Trump announced he would file to appear on the California primary ballot. On October 25, 1999, Trump joined the Reform Party. His pre-campaign gained a great deal of media attention. Trump told Chris Matthews on Hardball: \"It's not so much the Reform Party, it's really the fact that I'd want to make that if I ran and spent a lot of money I could actually win, I could beat that Democrat-Republican apparatus.\" He told Fortune magazine in early January 2000: \"'If I feel I could win—win—then I'd run. I think I have a good chance. Hey, I've got my name on half the major buildings in New York,' he said. 'I went to the Wharton School of Finance, which is the No. 1 school. I'm intelligent. Some people would say I'm very, very, very intelligent.\" He further said: \"It's very possible that I could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it.\"\nDuring the California primary, he received 15,311 votes or 37% of the Reform votes cast, giving him the lead in a five-person field. His total was 0.3% of the entire California primary vote. Trump ultimately withdrew his candidacy. During an appearance on The Today Show, he stated: \"The Reform Party is a total mess! You have Buchanan, a right winger, and you have Fulani, a Communist, and they have merged.... I don't know what you have!\"\nSchism\nLeader of the Transcendental Meditation movement John Hagelin also entered the race for the Reform Party nomination. Hagelin had run for president in both 1992 and 1996 on the Natural Law Party ticket.\nDuring his 2000 campaign, Hagelin appeared on ABC's Nightline (2000) and Politically Incorrect (2000), NBC's Meet the Press (2000), CNN's Larry King Live, PBS's News Hour with Jim Lehrer, Inside Politics,  CNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews, and C-SPAN's Washington Journal.\nIn July it was announced that Hagelin and Buchanan would be the only two candidates on the primary ballot. Supporters of Hagelin later charged the results of the party's open primary, which favored Buchanan by a wide margin, were \"tainted.\" Buchanan countered that Russ Verney had allowed the Hagelin campaign to mail a \"Stop Buchanan\" pamphlet using official \"Reform Party\" envelopes.\nMuch to the dismay of many Reform Party members, it became clear that the Hagelin campaign intended to merge the Natural Law Party, which was based on the teachings of Hindu guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi with the secular Reform Party. On August 2, Buchanan's website posted a copy of a proposed resolution to merge the two parties.\nThe animosity between the two campaigns reached a breaking point at the party's convention in Long Beach, California. Buchanan supporters blocked Hagelin and his delegates from entering the convention. Hagelin's supporters declared the convention illegitimate, and announced their own rival convention nearby, where they endorsed John Hagelin as their presidential candidate.\nWith two individuals both claiming to be the Reform Party candidate, a court would have to determine who would be permitted to appear on the ballot and receive the $12.5 million in matching funds.\nResults of the mail-in

In his acceptance speech, Buchanan proposed U.S. withdrawal from the United Nations and expelling the U.N. from New York, abolishing the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Education, Department of Energy, Department of Housing and Urban Development, taxes on inheritance and capital gains, and affirmative action programs.\nAs his running mate, Buchanan chose African-American activist and retired teacher from Los Angeles, Ezola B. Foster. Buchanan was supported in this election run by future Socialist Party USA presidential candidate Brian Moore, who said in 2008 he supported Buchanan in 2000 because \"he was for fair trade over free trade. He had some progressive positions that I thought would be helpful to the common man.\" On August 19, the New York Right to Life Party, in convention, chose Buchanan as their nominee, with 90% of the districts voting for him.\nOn November 2, party founder Ross Perot endorsed Republican George W. Bush for president.\nThe Reform Party never recovered from the 2000 fiasco. Many longtime members departed, the party's funds were depleted, and its reputation severely tarnished. On Election Day, Pat Buchanan only received 448,895 votes, thus losing the Reform Party's ballot access in most states. Buchanan returned to the Republican Party in 2001. During the 2004 election cycle, the Reform Party nominated Ralph Nader in hopes of relinquishing themselves of the \"pro-life\" label Buchanan had bestowed upon them. In 2008, Ted Weill, who had been a critic of Buchanan, was the party's presidential candidate. Donald Trump joined the Democratic Party in 2001, left in 2009 and remained an independent until 2012 when he returned to the Republican Party, seeking the party's nomination for president in 2016 and became the 45th President of the United States after defeating Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, he would lose to Joe Biden in 2020. Trump would be renominated by the Republican Party in 2024, and became the 47th President of the United States after defeating Biden's vice president and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.\nCandidates\nFile:Patrickjbuchanan.JPG|Former White House Communications Director Pat Buchanan of Virginia(Campaign)\nFile:John S.
