It was separated from the still-extant Songwriter of the Year to better allow the Junos to distinguish between songwriters who perform their own material as singer-songwriters or members of bands, and songwriters who wrote material for other artists.\nThe award is presented based on the Canadian nationality of the songwriter, and does not require the performing artist to be Canadian.\nIt was one of several new categories announced by the Juno Awards committee in fall 2024, and was presented for the first time at the Juno Awards of 2025.\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5em;\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Winner\n! scope=\"col\" | Songs\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Nominees\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Ref.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2025\n| Lowell\n| \"Texas Hold 'Em\" (Beyoncé), \"Bodyguard\" (Beyoncé), \"Takes One to Know One\" (The Beaches)\n|\n*Evan Blair — \"Beautiful Things\" (Benson Boone), \"Pretty Slowly\" (Benson Boone), \"i hope i never fall in love\" (Maren Morris)\n*Nathan Ferraro — \"Texas Hold 'Em\" (Beyoncé), \"Smoke\" (Ari Lennox), \"Who Do I Call Now?
