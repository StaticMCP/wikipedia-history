He went to war with the kingdom of Castile in 1295, relinquishing the villages of Serpa and Moura, but gained Olivença and reaffirmed Portugal's possession of the Algarve and defined the modern borders between the two Iberian countries. The treaty also established an alliance of friendship and mutual defense, leading to a peace of 40 years between the two nations.\nFernando then married Denis's daughter, Infanta Constance of Portugal, making her Queen of Castile.\nThe only area still disputed to this day is the village of Olivenza, which was under Portuguese sovereignty from 1297 to 1801, when it was occupied by Spain during the War of the Oranges and ceded that year under the Treaty of Badajoz, treaty which was declared null by Portugal during the Congress of Vienna. As of today, Spain still controls the village.\nReferences"
