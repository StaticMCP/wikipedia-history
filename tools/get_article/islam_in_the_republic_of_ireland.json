The number of Muslims in Ireland has increased since the 1990s, mostly through immigration. For the 2022 Irish census, 81,930 were counted within the Republic of Ireland. There are around 12,000 Muslims within Northern Ireland.\nHistory\nThe earliest mention of Ireland in Muslim sources originates in the works of Al-Idrisi in his Tabula Rogeriana mentioned Irlandah-al-Kabirah (Great Ireland).\nThe organisational history of Islam in Ireland is complex, not least because of the great variety of ethnic backgrounds of Muslims in the country. The first Islamic Society in Ireland was established in 1959, formed by students studying in Ireland and was called the Dublin Islamic Society (later called the Islamic Foundation of Ireland). At that time there was no mosque in Dublin, so the students used their homes and later rented halls for Jumu'ah (Friday) and Eid (Muslim holiday) prayers. In 1976 the first mosque and Islamic centre in Ireland was opened in a four-storey building at 7 Harrington Street, Dublin 8. Among those who contributed to the cost of the mosque and Islamic centre was the late King Faisal of Saudi Arabia. In 1981, the Ministry of Endowment and Islamic Affairs of Kuwait sponsored a full-time imam for the mosque.\nThe Belfast Islamic Centre was founded in Belfast in 1978. The Centre is currently located on the corner of University Road and Fountainville Avenue in South Belfast.\nIn 1983, the present building of the Dublin Mosque and Islamic Centre was bought, renovated and the headquarters of the Society moved from Harrington Street to 163 South Circular Road, Dublin 8.\nIn Cork, prayer halls are located in housing estates. Cork's Muslim community operates out of an industrial estate, while hoping to raise money to build a new mosque.\nIn 1992, Moosajee Bhamjee became the first (and to date only) Muslim Teachta Dála (Member of Irish Parliament).\nDemography and ethnic background\n2011, 2016 censuses:\n2022 census:\n}}\nAccording to the 2022 census, there were 83,300 Muslims living within the Republic of Ireland, representing a 29.1% increase over the figures for the 2016 census, remaining very much a minority. Cities and towns with the highest Muslim population according to the 2022 census are:\n# Dublin and suburbs: 37,458\n# Cork and suburbs: 4,535\n# Limerick and suburbs: 3,394\n# Galway and suburbs: 2,367\n# Waterford and suburbs: 2,084\n# Balbriggan: 1,133\n# Dundalk: 996\n# Tralee: 980\n# Drogheda: 915\n# Portlaoise: 810\n# Ennis: 711\n# Sligo: 628\n# Athlone: 615\n# Navan: 592\n# Carlow: 564\n# Kilkenny: 562\n# Swords: 550\n# Ballyhaunis: 543\n# Cavan: 520\n# Mullingar: 497\n# Letterkenny: 489\n# Killarney: 467\n# Naas: 422\n# Longford: 402.\nThe Muslim community in Ireland (including Northern Ireland) is diverse and growing rapidly, and its numbers are not determined by the country's history to the same extent as Great Britain and France, where the majority of Muslims are immigrants or descendants of immigrants from former colonies, or Germany and Austria, where the majority of Muslims are Turkish migrant workers and their descendants. Within the Republic of Ireland, just over 55 per cent of Muslims were either Asian or African nationals with 30.7 per cent having Irish nationality. The census also revealed that of the 31,779 Muslims resident in the Republic of Ireland at the time of the census, 9,761 were Irish nationals, less than the number of Asians (10,649) although more than the 6,909 African nationals. The census of 2011 found there were 49,204 Muslims in the Republic of Ireland, \"a sharp rise on five years previously\". The Muslim immigration at the end of the 1990s was caused by the Irish economic boom and asylum seekers from diverse Muslim countries, and in the 20-year period between 1991 and 2011 the Muslim population increased 1000%, from 0.1% to 1.1% of the population of the republic.\nAge and sex\nThere was an increase in the number of Muslims in every five year age group between 2006 and 2016. There were 147 Muslim males for every 100 females in 2006. This gap narrowed to 129 males per 100 females in 2016. The average age of Muslims in 2016 was 26.0 (compared with the State average of 37.4 years). There were 10,884 children of primary school-going age (5-12 year olds) among the Muslim community in the Republic of Ireland and a further 5,480 of secondary school age.\nMarital status\nMuslims in the Republic of Ireland are more likely to be married and were less likely to be single compared with the general population. Almost 6 out of 10 were married compared with 4.8 out of 10 for the general population. Divorce is also less prevalent among Muslims compared with the general population.\nResidence\nJust under half (47.3%) of all of the Republic of Ireland's Muslims lived in County Dublin. Dublin City was home to the largest proportion (15.5%), followed by South Dublin (13.1%), Fingal (12.8%) and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown (5.9%).\nPrincipal economic status\nThe economic status of Muslim men and women varied greatly with relatively small numbers of women at work and slightly above average numbers of men looking after the home and family.\nAmong Muslim men, 53.3 per cent were at work in April 2016 with 17.0 per cent unemployed or looking for their first job. In contrast, 23.6 per cent of Muslim women were working at the time of the census while a further 1 in 5 (19.5%) were unemployed.\nIn all, 27.4 per cent of Muslim women aged 15 and over were looking after the home or family – significantly higher than the rate for all women at 14.9 per cent.\nMajor occupational groups\nThere were 17,543 Muslims at work in the Republic of Ireland. At a broad occupational level, \"professional occupations\" was the largest category, accounting for 23.5 per cent of workers. Within this category medical practitioners were the largest occupation, with 2,102 workers and accounting for 12.0 per cent of all Muslim workers compared followed by chefs (1,349).\nMosques and denominations in Ireland\n(ICCI)]]\nIn 2003, the Islamic Cultural Centre, with help from Foras na Gaeilge, announced plans to translate the Quran from Arabic into Irish for the first time. The planners found it hard to find speakers of both languages and as of 2018 no translation exists.\nIn September 2006, an umbrella organisation, the Irish Council of Imams, was established. It represents 14 imams in Ireland, of both the Sunni and Shia traditions. It is chaired by Imam Hussein Halawa (Islamic Cultural Centre of Ireland) and its deputy chairman is Imam Yahya Al-Hussein (Islamic Foundation of Ireland). Imam Dr. Umar Al-Qadri (Al-Mustafa Islamic Cultural Centre Dublin 15), Imam Salem (Cork Mosque), Imam Khaled (Galway Mosque) and Imam Ismael Khotwal (Blackpitts Mosque) are among its founding members.\nSunni\nSource:\n* the Islamic Cultural Centre of Ireland (ICCI) in Clonskeagh, Dublin.
