The republic ceased to exist in 1795 when, due to the Third Partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Brzostowski exchanged the manor with Fryderyk Józef Moszyński for properties in Saxony and Dresden.\nMoszyński in turn sold the manor to Count de Choiseul-Gouffier in 1799. The new owners tolerated some of the freedoms until Brzostowski's death in 1827. The last freedoms were lost when farmers joined the failed November Uprising in 1830.\nGovernment\nThe community was governed by Paweł Ksawery Brzostowski, who declared himself President, and Seimas (parliament), which was formed from the local peasants. The republic had its own constitution which was created before the Constitution of 3 May 1791.Paweł Ksawery Brzostowski in Paulava Republic\nRecognition\nThe state was recognized by the Grand Duke and King Stanisław August Poniatowski himself.
