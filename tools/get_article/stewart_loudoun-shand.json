He was posthumously awarded the VC for his actions during an attack near the French village of Fricourt on the opening day of the Battle of the Somme.\nEarly life\nStewart Walter Shand was born on 8 October 1879 in Ceylon, and was one of ten children of John Shand, a tea planter, and his wife Lucy . Both his parents were originally from Scotland. The family, wealthy from trading in tea, later moved to South London. They lived in Dulwich, where all the boys of the family attended Dulwich College. Stewart excelled at sport, especially cricket. His brother, Eric, later represented Scotland in Rugby union.\nSouth Africa\nShand was working at a bank when the Second Boer War broke out in South Africa in 1899. He volunteered for the British Army's London Scottish Regiment but was not considered for service in South Africa on account of his age. He transferred to the Pembroke Yeomanry and was posted to its 9th Battalion, and with them was able to participate in the war. Having attained the rank of lance corporal, his service ended in 1901 but he remained in South Africa, working for a merchant company at Port Elizabeth. He left after a few years to take up a position in Ceylon, his place of birth, as a tea merchant; his father was instrumental in securing him the role.\nFirst World War\nOn the outbreak of the First World War, Loudoun-Shand, as he was now known following the change by deed poll of his family name, travelled to England to volunteer for service with the British Army. He was commissioned as a lieutenant and posted to the 10th Battalion of The Yorkshire Regiment. He spent the next several months training in the Surrey region with the battalion and, in June 1915, was promoted to captain.\nThe 10th Battalion arrived on the Western Front in September 1915, as part of the 62nd Brigade, 21st Division. Shortly afterwards, it fought in the Battle of Loos. Casualties in the battalion as the result of its role in the battle were such that in December, Loudoun-Shand was promoted to temporary major and given command of a company. He was wounded the following March but was only out of the frontline for a few days.}}\nCasualties were high amongst Loudoun-Shand's company, and by the conclusion of the day, 94 of the 122 men who commenced the attack had been wounded or killed.\nLoudoun-Shand is buried at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission's Norfolk Cemetery at Becordel-Becourt, near the Somme. His name is among those listed on the Dulwich College War Memorial and is on the Loudoun-Shand memorial at the West Norwood Cemetery.\nMedals\nLoudoun-Shand's VC was presented to his father by King George V in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 31 March 1917. The VC, along with his service medals from the First World War and the Second Boer War, were retained in his family for some time until purchased by Lord Ashcroft in 2005. They are displayed in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum in London.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*"
