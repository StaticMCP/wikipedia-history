The album is exactly one hour long, hence its title.\nReception\n|rev2 = Entertainment Weekly\n|rev2score = A\n|rev3 = Rolling Stone\n|rev3Score =\n|rev4 = Spin Alternative Record Guide\n|rev4score = 8/10\n| noprose = yes\n|rev5 = The Village Voice\n|rev5score =\n}}\nNed Raggett of AllMusic wrote that \"due in part to the return of Kramer to production – or in this case co-production – duties, along with a slew of more immediately memorable songs, Happy Hour trumps The Way to Salvation as the peak of the band's high-profile days, an inspired collection of tunes ranging from deranged pop to full-on epic metal stomp.\" The critic also said \"thanks to a catchy arrangement via Rick's clipped, stuttered guitar riff and the sweetly sung title phrase in the background, the result is giddy left-field nonsense.\" and \"it's the blessed liveliness of the whole album – at a premium in the days of full-on grunge when it came out, still rare enough years later – that makes it stand up so well.\" Trouser Press said \"Hall's surreal accounts have the vivid sense of purpose previously absent; he’s not aiming at eliciting wan smiles, he’s trying to provoke intelligent thought\" and \"meanwhile, the band (drummer Roger Murdock is that new face in the booklet photo) locks into diverse rock grooves that would be worth hearing even without the vocals.\"  Robert Christgau chose the band's hit single \"Detachable Penis\" as the album's \"choice cut\".\nTrack listing\n| length1         = 0:11\n| title2          = Sink\n| music2          =\n| length2         = 3:00\n| title3          = Martin Scorsese\n| music3          =\n| length3         = 1:57\n| title4          = (Why Are We) Trapped?\n| music4          = Murdock\n| length4         = 4:30\n| title5          = It's Saturday\n| music5          =\n| length5         = 2:33\n| title6          = VvV (VulvaVoid)\n| music6          =\n| length6         = 3:24\n| title7          = Metanoia\n| music7          =\n| length7         = 3:20\n| title8          = Detachable Penis\n| music8          =\n| length8         = 3:22\n| title9          = Take Me Home\n| music9          =\n| length9         = 6:16\n| title10         = Ed\n| music10         =\n| length10        = 6:01\n| title11         = Anywhere\n| music11         = Rick\n| length11        = 3:33\n| title12         = The Evil Children\n| music12         =\n| length12        = 5:47\n| title13         = Glass\n| music13         = Hall\n| length13        = 0:23\n| title14         = And\n| music14         =\n| length14        = 2:49\n| title15         = King Murdock\n| music15         =\n| length15        = 0:54\n| title16         = I'm Sorry\n| music16         =\n| length16        = 3:03\n| title17         = Heaven\n| music17         = Murdock\n| length17        = 3:14\n| title18         = Happy Hour\n| music18         =\n| length18        = 5:39\n}}\nPersonnel\nAdapted from the Happy Hour liner notes.\nKing Missile\n* John S.
