E. B. Stuart during the American Civil War.\nBattle\nFirst known as Jack's Shop for a blacksmith shop that stood nearby, Rochelle, in Madison County, Virginia, was the scene of a cavalry skirmish on September 22, 1863. While Confederate cavalry under Major General J. E. B. Stuart engaged Union Brigadier General John Buford's troops, the cavalry of Brigadier General Hugh Judson Kilpatrick rode to Buford's support and attacked the rear of Stuart's force. Stuart's horse artillery and his cavalry fired and charged in both directions. They broke through Kilpatrick's lines and escaped. The engagement was inconclusive.\nAnalysis\nThe battle was fought while Lee's forces were withdrawing across the Rapidan River, following the great defeat at Gettysburg. Together with the Battle of James City, which had been fought almost two weeks earlier, on October 8, the Battle of Jack's Shop has been said by Madison County historian Harold Woodward, Jr. to mark the end of the Gettysburg campaign.\nReferences\nSources\n* Combs, Paula (September 22, 2016).
