It lies in the region of Monongalia County known as The Forks of Cheat, so named because that is the area where the Cheat empties (forks) into the Monongahela River.\nIt is nestled close to the Cheat River, off US-119 on a bend in the river.\nThere in 1775, Rev John Corbly organized the Forks-of-the-Cheat Baptist Church, the oldest continuously operating church in West Virginia.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
