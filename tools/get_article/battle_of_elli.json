It was the largest sea battle of the Balkan Wars.\nBackground\nSince the start of the war the Royal Hellenic Navy acted aggressively, while the Ottoman Navy remained in the Dardanelles. Rear Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis landed at Lemnos, while the Greek fleet captured a series of islands. On 24 October (O.S.), Kountouriotis sent a telegram to the Ottoman admiral: \"We have captured Tenedos. We await the exit of your fleet. If you need coal, I can supply you.\" On 3 December (OS), the Ottoman fleet left the Dardanelles.\nBattle\nThe Royal Hellenic Navy, led by Kountouriotis on board of the flagship Averof, defeated the Ottoman Navy, led by Captain Ramiz Bey, just outside the entrance to the Dardanelles (Hellespont). During the battle, Kountouriotis, frustrated by the slow speed of the three older Greek ironclads Hydra, Spetsai and Psara, hoisted the Z flag which stood for \"Independent Action\", and sailed forward alone at a speed of 20 knots, against the Ottoman fleet. Taking full advantage of her superior speed, guns and armour, Averof succeeded in crossing the Ottoman fleet's \"T\" and concentrated her fire against the Ottoman flagship Barbaros Hayreddin, thus forcing the Ottoman fleet to retreat in disorder. The Greek fleet, including the destroyers ,  and  continued to pursue the Ottoman fleet off-and-on between December 13 and December 26, 1912.\nAftermath\nThe Ottomans suffered 7 killed and 14 wounded on the Barbaros Hayreddin, 8 killed and 20 wounded on the Turgut Reis, and 3 dead and 7 wounded on the Mesudiye.\n}}\nFurther reading\n*\n*"
