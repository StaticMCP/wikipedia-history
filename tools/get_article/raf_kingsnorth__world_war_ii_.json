It was at Bliby Corner approximately  southeast of Ashford. It is not to be confused with RNAS Kingsnorth, later RAF Kingsnorth, which was an airship station in operation during and after the First World War.\nOpened in 1943, Kingsnorth was one of a number of prototype temporary Advanced Landing Ground airfields built, with more to be built in France after D-Day, as the Allied forces moved east across France and Germany. Kingsnorth was used by British, Dominion and the United States Army Air Forces until it was closed in September 1944.\nToday the airfield is agricultural land with few remains visible on the ground, although sections of the runways can clearly be made out on aerial and satellite photos.\nHistory\nThe USAAF Ninth Air Force required several temporary Advanced Landing Ground (ALG) along the channel coast prior to the June 1944 invasion of Normandy to provide tactical air support for the ground forces landing in France.\nRAF Fighter Command use\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+RAF units and aircraft\n|-\n!Unit\n!Dates\n!Aircraft\n!Variant\n!Notes\n|-\n|No. 19 Squadron RAF\n|August–September 1943\n|Supermarine Spitfire\n|IX\n| Controlled by No. 122 Airfield Headquarters\n|-\n|No. 65 (East India) Squadron RAF\n|July–October 1943\n|Supermarine Spitfire\n|IX\n| Controlled by No. 122 Airfield Headquarters\n|-\n|No. 122 (Bombay) Squadron RAF\n|July–October 1943\n|Supermarine Spitfire\n|IX\n| Controlled by No. 122 Airfield Headquarters\n|-\n|No. 184 Squadron RAF\n|August 1943\n|Hawker Hurricane\n|IV\n| Controlled by No. 122 Airfield Headquarters\n|-\n|No. 602 (City of Glasgow) Squadron AAF\n|July–August 1943\n|Supermarine Spitfire\n|VB\n| Controlled by No. 122 Airfield Headquarters\n|-\n|No. 2809 Squadron RAF Regiment\n|\n|N/A\n|N/A\n|Airfield Defence\n|-\n|No. 122 Airfield Headquarters RAF\n|July-October 1943\n|N/A\n|N/A\n|\n|}\nUSAAF use\nat Kingsnorth 1944.]]\nKingsnorth was known as USAAF Station AAF-418 for security reasons by the USAAF during the war, and by which it was referred to instead of location.  Its USAAF Station Code was \"KN\".\n36th Fighter Group\nThe availability date of 1 April 1944 was achieved and between the 4th and 6th of that month approximately 1,500 men of the 36th Fighter Group arrived at Kingsnorth airfield from Scribner Army Airfield, Nebraska flying Republic P-47 Thunderbolts. Operational fighter squadrons and fuselage codes were:\n* 22d Fighter Squadron (3T)\n* 23d Fighter Squadron (7U)\n* 53d Fighter Squadron (6V)\nThe 36th Fighter Group was part of the 303d Fighter Wing, XIX Tactical Air Command.\nMovement to the Continent commenced during the first week of July when the 53rd Fighter Squadron transferred to its Advanced Landing Ground (ALG) at Brucheville, France (ALG A-16) as a forward base. The other two squadrons continued to operate from Kingsnorth until early August, the main body of the group preparing to move on the 2nd. Within a few days all personnel were gone and the airfield was deserted.\nCurrent use\nWith the facility released from military control, the former airfield was returned rapidly to agricultural use and within a very short period there was little to indicate that RAF Kingsnorth had existed. Today the only evidence of the airfield's existence is a slight outline of the southeast end of runway 13, visible in aerial photographs.\nDirections\nKingsnorth Airfield is on the east side of the A2070 just south of Ashford, about 1 mile south of Bad Munsterfeld road just after the loop heading southwards. The main airfield was in the field northwest of Bliby Corner crossroads, although the runways can be traced to south of Chequertree Lane.\nSee also\n*List of former Royal Air Force stations\nReferences\n;Citations\n;Bibliography\n*\n* Freeman, Roger A.
