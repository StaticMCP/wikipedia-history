The temple is dedicated to Shiva in his Shiva lingam  form and has been a site of religious significance for centuries. The temple is managed under the Baba Gangeshwarnath Tirth Chetra.\nHistory\nThe history of the temple dates back to approximately 800 years. According to historical records, between 1160 and 1170 CE, Gangadeva, the son of King Nanyadeva, established a Shiva Lingam in the dense forests of Ratanpur Abhiman during his military preparations. His purpose was to seek divine blessings while strategizing to reclaim his father's kingdom.\nAlong with the temple, he also commissioned the excavation of a pond to ensure water availability, which is now known as Rajkhani Pokhar. Following his successful campaign against King Ballāla Sena and the liberation of his father, the temple was consecrated and named Gangeshwar Asthan after Gangadev.\nAnother belief suggests that approximately 150 years ago, a local Shiva devotee named Gangeshwar Mishra from Prasadi Tola, inspired by a divine vision, reconstructed and re-consecrated the temple. Over time, the temple became known as Gangeshwar Asthan, attributed to his name.\nSignificance and features\nThe temple holds religious significance among devotees, who frequently visit to offer prayers. A unique aspect of the temple is the tradition of drawing water from the deep pond within the temple premises for worship. The temple witnesses a large congregation of devotees on festivals such as Vasant Panchami, Narak Nivaran Chaturdashi, and Maha Shivaratri, during which the temple is elaborately decorated. During the Shravan month, special arrangements are made due to the large influx of pilgrims.\nDevotees from distant places, including Simaria, Pahela Ghat, and Sultanganj, bring holy water from the River Ganges for the ritualistic Jalabhishek of Lord Shiva. There is also a traditional belief that the pond's water is not used for irrigation, as it is considered to hold divine energy.\nGallery\nBaba Gangeshwarnath Temple.jpg|Mahadev Temple Intrance\nMaa Parvati Temple.jpg |Maa Parvati Temple inside Baba Gangeshwarnath Temple Permises\nBaba Gangeshwarnath Temple Parking Area.jpg|Parking area in Baba Gangeshwarnath Temple\nMaa Parvati And Mahadev Temple.jpg|Maa Parvati Temple and Gangeshwarnath Temple Together view\nReferences"
