FSI*ce was a result of a German Research Foundation project in the Research Group  Fluid-Structure Interaction: Modelling, Simulation, Optimisation (FOR493).\npreCICE v1\nIn May 2015, the development of preCICE was moved to its own organization on GitHub. The first stable version v1.0.0 of the core library was released in November 2017.\npreCICE v1 included a variety of coupling schemes (explicit and implicit, Aitken underrelaxation, Anderson and Broyden quasi-Newton acceleration algorithms), data mapping methods (nearest-neighbor, nearest-projection, RBF), and communication methods (TCP/IP sockets, MPI ports).\nThe v1.x release cycle saw releases until v1.6.1, in September 2019.\npreCICE v2\nBy 2020, the preCICE project saw development in different directions: extensive refactoring and testing of the core library, large expansion of the available documentation, development of several new adapters and several community building measures. Several of these changes are connected to the acceptance of preCICE into the extreme-scale scientific software development kit (xSDK). Due to increased number of components, the preCICE distribution was introduced as a citable bundle of components working together.\nThe v2.x release cycle saw releases until v2.5.1, in January 2024.\npreCICE v3\npreCICE v3.0.0 was released in February 2024. Notable changes of v3 include simplifications in the API and configuration, multirate and higher-order time stepping, and faster RBF mapping based on a partition of unity approach.\nAt the time of the v3 release cycle, the project has expanded from targeting mainly surface coupling to also targeting volume coupling (overlapping domains, see domain decomposition methods), geometric multiscale mapping, system codes implementing the Functional Mock-up Interface., and multiscale simulations\nCoupled codes\nWhile preCICE is a software library with an API that can be used by programmers to couple their own code, there exist several integrations with several simulation codes, making preCICE more accessible to end users that are not primarily programmers (such as applied mathematicians, mechanical engineers, or climate scientists).\nIn the terminology used by preCICE, the integrations to simulation codes are called adapters and can be maintained by the preCICE developers or third parties.\nExample codes that preCICE integrates with via adapters include, among others:\n* CalculiX\n* deal.II\n* DUNE\n* Elmer\n* FEBio\n* FEniCS\n* OpenFOAM\n* SU2\nThe community has also coupled CAMRAD II, DLR TAU, DUST, DuMuX, Rhoxyz, Ateles, XDEM, FLEXI, MBDyn, OpenFAST, LS-DYNA, and G+Smo.\nSee also\n* Other coupling libraries/frameworks with similar goals are the Multiscale Universal Interface (MUI), OpenPALM (CWIPI), and MpCCI.\n* Multiphysics simulation\n* List of numerical analysis software\nReferences"
