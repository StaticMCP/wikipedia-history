The group, which included theatre critic Norman Kessell, publicisit Bill Fenn, press officer for J. C. Williamson's John Love, and ABC producer Allan Kendall, had been meeting for lunch semi-regularly since 1966. The group was named \"The Glugs\" by British-Canadian actor Barry Morse, after they had presented him with a copy of The Glugs of Gosh, a collection of poems by Australian poet C. J. Dennis, as a gift.  They were at first a private group, with their lunch meetings spread by word-of-mouth.\nPeople\nIn 2015, Lee Young, aged 86, was \"Chief Glug\", while Beverley Davies, aged 78, was the group's co-ordinator.
