It has since become an internet meme.\nThe scene\nIn Star Wars'' (1977), when Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker traveled to Mos Eisley to seek passage to Alderaan, Kenobi gestures with his hand and immediately convinces a suspicious stormtrooper, both that he \"[doesn't] need to see [Skywalker's] identification\" and that the droids (R2-D2 and C-3PO) accompanying them \"aren't the droids [they are] looking for.\" After he and Skywalker are clear of the checkpoint, Luke expresses surprise at how easily they have escaped and Kenobi explains that \"The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.\"\nAnalysis\nThe scene has been called famous and iconic; likewise, the quote \"These aren't the droids you're looking for\" itself has been called catchy, familiar, used in everyday conversations, and likewise, famous and iconic.\nThe scene is as an example of The Force use as a mind controling psi power, known in the Star Wars universe as a \"Jedi mind trick\". Mind tricks, as an aspect of controversial mind control, are sometimes considered not ethical, and violating in-universe Jedi Code.\nIn popular culture\nIn 1998, the American rock and roll band Queens of the Stone Age recorded a song with the phrase as its title (in the The Split CD album), while Neko Case and Kelly Hogan released a song titled \"These Aren't the Droids\" in 2014 (in the 2776 album). It has been used by politicians (such as American politician Mitt Romney in 2008) and appears in other works of fiction, such as the House TV series (episode \"A Pox on Our House\")).\nThe meaning of the original sentence can be interpreted as \"nothing of interest to you is here\". It has became a popular Internet meme, generally used in the form ''\"These Aren't the X You're Looking For\"'' to humorously or sarcastically assert that someone is wrong, as the relevant object or concept (\"X\") is not representing what it appears to represent; it has a number of grammar variations, including versions not using contractions (\"are not\" instead of \"aren't\" and \"you are\" instead of \"you're\") that have been described as possibly more popular than the original variant.\nSee also\n*Clanker\nReferences"
