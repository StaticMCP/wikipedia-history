Robin Mayes challenged Warner's candidacy, but the challenge was dismissed by the Cherokee Nation Supreme Court. He faced Meredith Frailey in the general election. He won with 58.88% of the vote. The Cherokee Nation Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the Warner's election alleging he violated election law because the Election Commission had found prior complaints without merit. He was sworn on August 14, 2019. In 2021, he was again appointed to another two-year term on the Center for Disease Control Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Tribal Advisory Committee.
