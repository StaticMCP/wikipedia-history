The speaker asks those who associate themselves with papist group to cease seeking God through a Catholic vein, and conform to the religious ideology of the Protestant Reformation. While the term \"papist\" became an anti-Catholic slur in the mid-19th century, in the sixteenth-century it simply identified those who pledged their religious allegiance to the Pope. Nevertheless, the ballad pleads with the papists to forsake the Catholic religion and be \"grafted in this stock\" of emerging Protestantism.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/ballad/32083/xml Textual transcription of the English broadside ballad A free admonition without any fees / To warne the Papistes to beware of three trees] at the English Broadside Ballad Archive of UC Santa Barbara."
