This disrupted journeys between the Isle of Sheppey and the mainland.\nOn the mainland Kings Ferry Bridge staff halt was renamed Swale Halt and opened to the public. A temporary halt was built north of the bridge, named Kings Ferry Bridge North Halt. Passengers had to walk over the bridge in order to continue their journeys. The bridge was eventually repaired, and through rail services were restored on 1 November 1923, and this station closed on this date.\nReferences\n*"
