These diplomatic contacts were within the Sinocentric system of bilateral and multinational relationships in the Sinosphere. Some missions were sent to perform investiture ceremonies for the King of Ryukyu, formally acknowledging him as King on behalf of the Chinese Imperial Court, and as a tributary subordinate.\nThe envoys in Shuri\nShuri was the royal capital of the Ryukyu Kingdom. It is today part of the city of Naha, Okinawa.\nUpon the accession of a new king, the news was generally communicated to the Chinese capital, along with a petition for the investiture, by a formal Ryukyuan tribute mission. Following the 1609 invasion of Ryukyu, beginning with the succession of Shō Hō, the Satsuma Domain also had to be notified and asked for approval and confirmation of the new king.\nChinese envoys would then be dispatched - sometimes quite quickly, sometimes not until over a decade later - arriving in ships called  in Okinawan. The mission would usually consist of two official envoy ships, separate crafts carrying the chief envoy and his deputy, as some uncertainty accompanied the journey; these would be accompanied by a number of merchant ships. During Japan's Edo period, an agent from Satsuma known as a  would be sent down to Ryukyu to supervise the exchanges and interactions between Chinese and Ryukyuan officials, albeit from somewhat of a distance, given the policy of hiding Satsuma's involvement in Ryukyu from the Chinese.\nEnvoys generally stayed in Ryukyu for four to eight months, and were extensively entertained by the Ryukyuan royal court. A number of structures built for this purpose, including the Ryūtan pond and the Hokuden (North Hall) of Shuri Castle, can still be seen today on the castle grounds. The total Chinese entourage generally numbered between 300 and 800 people, and hosting and entertaining the Chinese envoys was an extremely expensive endeavor for the Ryukyuan court.\nA \"\" oversaw these entertainments; kumi odori, a traditional form of Ryukyuan dance-drama, was first created and performed for entertaining an investiture envoy and his fellows, in 1719.\nTimeline of missions\nKing Satto became, in 1372, the first Ryukyuan king to submit to Chinese suzerainty. Beginning with the investiture of Satto's successor, Bunei, in 1404, twenty-two such missions traveled to Ryukyu in total, the last in 1866, for the investiture of Shō Tai.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef\"\n! width=8%  | Year\n! width=10% | Emperor of China\n! width=24% | Chinese envoys\n! width=14% | Ryūkyū king\n! width=44% | Comments\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 1373\n| Jianwen\n| Yang Zai\n| Satto\n|align=\"left\" | mission purpose is to bring islands into Sinitic system.\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 1404\n| Yongle\n| Shi Zhong\n| Bunei\n|align=\"left\" | investiture (cefeng) mission confirms Bunei as king in Ryukyu.\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 1415\n| Yongle\n| Chen Xiuro\n| Shō Shishō\n|align=\"left\" |\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 1427\n| Xuande\n| Chai Shan ; Ruan Jian\n| Shō Hashi\n|align=\"left\" |\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 1443\n| Zhengtong\n| Yu Bian ; Liu Xun\n| Shō Chū\n|align=\"left\" |\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 1448\n| Zhengtong\n| Chen Chuan ; Wan Xiang\n| Shō Shitatsu\n|align=\"left\" |\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 1452\n| Jingtai\n| Qiao Yi ; Tong Shouhong\n| Shō Kinpuku\n|align=\"left\" |\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 1456\n| Jingtai\n| Yan Cheng ; Liu Jian\n| Shō Taikyū\n|align=\"left\" |\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 1464\n| Chenghua\n| Pang Rong ; Cai Zhe\n| Shō Toku\n|align=\"left\" |\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 1472\n| Hongzhi\n| Guang Rong ; Han Wen\n| Shō En\n|align=\"left\" | installation of the new king.\n|- align=\"center\"\n|1479\n| Hongzhi\n| Dong Min ; Zhang Xiang\n| Shō Shin\n|align=\"left\" |\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 1534\n| Jiajing\n| Chen Kan  ; Gao Cheng\n| Shō Sei\n|align=\"left\" | mission encompassed a retinue of over 200 persons travelling in two ships which were specially constructed for this diplomatic purpose.
