The township is a bedroom suburb of New York City in the much larger New York metropolitan area, located within the Raritan Valley region. As of the 2020 United States census, the township's population was 15,923, an increase of 612 (+4.0%) from the 2010 census count of 15,311, which in turn reflected an increase of 1,052 (+7.4%) from the 14,259 counted in the 2000 census. Warren is situated in northeastern Somerset County bordering both Morris (along the Passaic River) and Union counties.\nThe township has been one of the state's highest-income communities. Based on data from the American Community Survey for 2013–2017, Warren Township residents had a median household income of $154,647, ranked 12th in the state among municipalities with more than 10,000 residents, more than double the statewide median of $76,475.\nIn 2012, Forbes.com listed Warren as 334th in its listing of \"America's Most Expensive ZIP Codes\", with a median home price of $842,750.\nHistory\nWarren was originally inhabited by the Lenape Native Americans and was colonized in the 1720s by European farmers. As early as 1900, it became a destination for wealthy residents looking to escape nearby New York City. Warren was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 5, 1806, from portions of Bernards Township and Bridgewater Township. The south-eastern half of the original township (which was close to a railroad and contained most of the population) was separated off as North Plainfield Township (since renamed to Green Brook Township) on April 2, 1872.\nWarren was named for Revolutionary War patriot, General Joseph Warren, who was killed at the Battle of Bunker Hill. Warren celebrated its 200th anniversary in 2006.\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 19.64 square miles (50.86&nbsp;km2), including 19.57 square miles (50.68&nbsp;km2) of land and 0.07 square miles (0.18&nbsp;km2) of water (0.36%).\nUnincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Coontown, Dock Watch Hollow, Gallia, Mount Bethel, Round Top, Smalleytown, Springdale, Union Village, and Warrenville.\nThe township borders Bernards Township to the north and west, Bridgewater Township to the southwest, Green Brook Township to the southeast, and Watchung to the east; all of which lie within Somerset County. Northeastern borders are the communities of Long Hill in Morris County and Berkeley Heights in Union County.\nThe east–west Second Watchung Mountain ridge bisects Warren, with the northern half of the township sloping northward to the Passaic River and Dead River, and the southern half spanning the Washington Valley, between the First and Second Watchung Mountain ridges, through which runs the East Branch of the Middle Brook. At the border with Bridgewater Township, the Second Watchung Mountain features a prominent cliff face at the now-abandoned Dock Watch Quarry.\nDemographics\n, United States Census Bureau.
