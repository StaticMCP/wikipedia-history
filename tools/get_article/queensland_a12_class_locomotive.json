Per Queensland Railway's classification system they were designated the A12 class, A representing they had two driving axles, and the 12 the cylinder diameter in inches.\nAn American built A12 class locomotive No.62 boiler exploded at Roma Street, Brisbane on 2 December 1898. The Court of Enquiry into the explosion was recorded in the 1899 Votes and Proceedings of the Queensland Legislative Assembly.\nSee also\n* List of boiler explosions\nReferences"
