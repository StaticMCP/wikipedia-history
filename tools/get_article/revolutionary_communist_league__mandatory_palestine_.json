Later, in the 1940s, they were joined by Jabra Nicola, an Arab Communist who broke with the Palestine Communist Party over the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact.\nThe  published a newspaper,  (Voice of the Class).\nTony Cliff was a member, before moving to Britain and joining the RCL's sister party in the Fourth International, the Revolutionary Communist Party (UK) and later leading the International Socialists.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\nTexts by the Revolutionary Communist League (Palestine)\n*[http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1946/05/strike.html \"Palestine Strike: Arabs and Jews Unite\" by T.
