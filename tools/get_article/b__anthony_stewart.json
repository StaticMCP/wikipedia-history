Anthony Stewart (born Benjamín Anthony Stewart, August 20, 1904 – June 5, 1977) was an American photographer with National Geographic. Stewart is known for having the first image featured on the cover of the magazine, that of the 49-star flag of the United States after Alaska's admission to the Union as a U.S. state. He is credited with more than one-hundred photos in the publication, five of which were featured on the cover.\nLife\nStewart was born Benjamín Anthony Stewart on August 20, 1904, in Lynch Station, Virginia to Charles Frank Stewart and Martha E.

During his forty-two-year employment with the magazine he moved up the hierarchy to become the Chief photographer for the publication.\nWhen color photography was in its infancy, Stewart was one of the first photographers to capture extensive images with both the view camera and the 35 mm camera. When he was asked to complete his first major assignment, a photo spread of the U.S. State of Maine, the magazine expanded the usual sixteen-page spread to thirty-two pages.\nIn the summer of 1956, with his colleague David S. Boyer, he travelled through Scotland, taking photographs to illustrate Isobel Wylie Hutchison's article, \"A Stroll to John o'Groats\".\nContributing over one-hundred photos throughout his career, the subjects of Stewart's stories have featured locations around the globe such as Canada, Europe, South America and the Pacific Ocean. While on assignment in the Soviet Union, Stewart captured the reaction of the Russian people regarding the visit of then-Vice President of the United States Richard Nixon, after his \"Kitchen Debate\" with Nikita Khrushchev.\nThe first photo to appear on the cover of National Geographic was in the July 1959 issue of the magazine of which Stewart is credited for. The cover story titled \"New Stars for Old Glory\" featured the 49-star flag of the United States after Alaska's admission to the Union as a U.S. state, which was signed into law on July 3, 1959, by President Dwight D.
