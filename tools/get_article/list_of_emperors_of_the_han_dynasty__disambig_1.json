The era is conventionally periodised into the Western Han (202&nbsp;BC9&nbsp;AD) and Eastern Han (25–220&nbsp;AD).\nThe Han dynasty was founded by the peasant rebel leader Liu Bang, known posthumously as Emperor Gao (). The longest reigning emperor of the dynasty was Emperor Wu (), who reigned for 54 years. The dynasty was briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty of the former regent Wang Mang, but he was killed during a rebellion on 6&nbsp;October 23&nbsp;AD. The Han dynasty was reestablished by Liu Xiu, known posthumously as Emperor Guangwu () or Guangwu Di, who claimed the throne on 5&nbsp;August 25&nbsp;AD. The last Han emperor, Emperor Xian (), was a puppet monarch of Chancellor Cao Cao (155–220&nbsp;AD), who dominated the court and was made King of Wei. On 11&nbsp;December 220, Cao's son Pi usurped the throne as Emperor Wen of Wei () and ended the Han dynasty.\nThe emperor was the supreme head of government. He appointed all of the highest-ranking officials in central, provincial, commandery, and county administrations. He also functioned as a lawgiver, the highest court judge, commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and high priest of the state-sponsored religious cults.\nNaming conventions\nEmperor\n(), as depicted by the Tang artist Yan Liben (600–673)]]\nbronze handle with traces of red pigment, in the shape of a dragon's head; for Han emperors, the dragon could represent either good or bad omens depending on circumstance.]]\nThe rulers of the previous Shang () and Zhou (256&nbsp;BC) dynasties were referred to as 'king' ( ). By the time of the Zhou dynasty, they were also referred to as the Son of Heaven. In 221&nbsp;BC, King Ying Zheng of Qin completed the conquest of all the Warring States of ancient China. To elevate himself above the Shang and Zhou kings, he accepted the new title of Emperor ( ) and is known to posterity as Qin Shi Huang, the 'First Emperor' of Qin. The new title of emperor was created by combining the titles for the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors from Chinese mythology. This title was used by each successive ruler of China until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911.\nPosthumous, temple, and era names\nFrom the Shang until the Sui dynasty (581–618) dynasty, Chinese rulers (both kings and emperors) were referred to by their posthumous names in records and historical texts. Temple names, first used during the reign of Emperor Jing of Han (), were used exclusively in later records and historical texts when referring to emperors who reigned during the Tang (618–907), Song (960–1279), and Yuan (1271–1368) dynasties. During the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911) dynasties, a single era name was used for each emperor's reign and became the preferred way to refer to Ming and Qing emperors in historical texts.\nUse of the era name was formally adopted during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (), yet its origins can be traced back further. The oldest method of recording years—which had existed since the Shang—set the first year of a ruler's reign as year one. When an emperor died, the first year of a new reign period would begin. This system was changed by the 4th century&nbsp;BC when the first year of a new reign period did not begin until the first day of the lunar New Year following a ruler's death. When Duke Huiwen of Qin assumed the title of king in 324&nbsp;BC, he changed the year count of his reign back to the first year. For his newly adopted calendar established in 163&nbsp;BC, Emperor Wen of Han () also set the year count of his reign back to the beginning.\nSince six was considered a lucky number, the emperors Jing and Wu changed the year count of their reigns back to the beginning every six years. Since every six-year period was successively marked as yuannian (), eryuan (), sanyuan (), and so forth, this system was considered too cumbersome by the time it reached the fifth cycle wuyuan sannian () in 114&nbsp;BC. In that year, a government official suggested that the Han court retrospectively rename every \"beginning\" with new characters; Emperor Wu accepted this reform in 110&nbsp;BC. Since Emperor Wu had just performed the religious feng () sacrifice at Mount Taishan, he named the new era yuanfeng (). This event is regarded as the formal establishment of era names in Chinese history. Emperor Wu changed the era name once more when he established the 'Great Beginning' ( Taichu) calendar in 104&nbsp;BC. From this point until the end of Western Han, the court established a new era name every four years of an emperor's reign. By the Eastern Han, there was no set interval for establishing new era names, which were often introduced for political reasons and celebrating auspicious events.\nRegents and empress dowagers\n'', a 2nd-century&nbsp;AD stone relief at the Wu Liang shrines in Jiaxiang, Shandong]]\nAt times, especially when an infant emperor was placed on the throne, a regent, often the empress dowager or one of her male relatives, would assume the duties of the emperor until he reached his majority. Sometimes the empress dowager's faction—the consort clan—was overthrown in a coup d'état. For example, Empress Lü Zhi () was the de facto ruler of the court during the reigns of the child emperors Qianshao () and Houshao (). Her faction was overthrown during the Lü Clan disturbance of 180&nbsp;BC and Liu Heng was named emperor (posthumously known as Emperor Wen). Before Emperor Wu died in 87&nbsp;BC, he had invested Huo Guang (), Jin Midi (), and Shangguan Jie (; ) with the power to govern as regents over his successor Emperor Zhao of Han (). Huo Guang and Shangguan Jie were both grandfathers to Empress Shangguan (), wife of Emperor Zhao, while the ethnically-Xiongnu Jin Midi was a former slave who had worked in an imperial stable. After Jin died and Shangguan was executed for treason, Huo Guang was the sole ruling regent. Following his death, the Huo family faction was overthrown by Emperor Xuan of Han (), in revenge for Huo Guang poisoning his wife Empress Xu Pingjun () so that he could marry Huo's daughter Empress Huo Chengjun ().\nList of emperors\nBelow is a complete list of emperors of the Han dynasty, including their personal, posthumous, and era names.
