They are affiliated to the Cheshire Rugby Football Union and in turn the English Rugby Football Union.\nThey compete in the Manx Shield competition which the club won in the 1997-1998 season.  The club also won the Manx Bowl competition in the 2003-2004 season.\nThey also compete in the BSM Manx Cup and have in the past competed in the Cheshire Cup on numerous occasions.\nWestern Vikings currently play their home games at the QEII High School in Peel, Isle of Man.\nClub history\nEarly years and formation\nWestern Vikings Rugby Club came into existence in November 1989 by Tony Gale and Dave Berry. They got together a group of friends who decided to play a few games of rugby.  There was surprisingly good response to their idea which resulted in the club being formed.\nThe first game was played away to Vagabonds C at Glencrutchery Road on 12 November 1989. The score was a respectable 23-0 to Vagabonds C. The club then held a meeting on 30 November 1989 when the first committee was elected.  David Lancaster was elected the first club Chairman, with Tony Gale being elected the first Club Captain.\nThe club carried on in the 1989/90 season by playing only friendly games basically to become known as Western Vikings RUFC (as opposed to Peel RUFC) within the rugby world in the Isle of Man and the Cheshire RFU.\nThe club secured a pitch at the Queen Elizabeth II High School in Peel, Isle of Man on which to play their home games.  The team's clubhouse and main meeting point was decided to be The Creek Inn in Peel with permission of the Licensee, Robert McAleer.  Vikings then competed in their first ever Easter Festival at Douglas RUFC's pitch at Port-a-Chee in 1990.  The teams played were Rossendale RUFC and Sunderland RUFC, although the Vikings were defeated, it proved to be the beginning of both playing and social experiences for the members.\nThe club then grew in strength and viewing numbers by the end of the season which was rounded off with their first annual dinner held at the King Edward Bay Golf Club on Friday, 11 May.\nShield winners\nVikings finest hour was when they won the Manx Shield in 1998 with a last match 39-38 victory over Vagabonds at Glencrutchery Road.  This was the first and only time the club have won the Manx Shield.  They also won the Manx Bowl in 2004 with victory over Castletown at Mooragh Park.\nYouth commitment and disbandment\nDuring the 2003/2004 season the club was approached by Ian \"Wagga\" Williams the head of Rugby Development on the Island to start up a youth Section for the club this was in conjunction with the Manx Youth Games being held on the Island to help train the Juniors of the West of the Island for the Tag Rugby section in the games, this coaching was taken on by Matthew Wozniak as the head coach and Brian Wozniak as an assistant coach.\nWith help from one or two other players the Youth team went from strength to strength over the years. This laid a platform for some of the young players to learn their trade and hopefully progress and play for the club in future years.  The senior team disbanded after the 2006/07 season after losing many senior players through injury and retirement.   This time the club was still running a junior section with the intention of reforming a senior side in the near future.\nResurrection\nIt was some five years until the west had a senior rugby team again.  In March 2012, Western Vikings announced that they would be reforming their senior side and entering a team in the 2012/13 Manx domestic season.\nVikings currently have one senior team entered in the Shimmin Wilson Manx Shield and the BSM Manx Cup and have numerous junior teams starting from under 7's all the way to school leaving age.\nLife members\nIntroduced in 2013 to honour club members who, after their playing careers are over, have remained a part of the club and are always on hand to lend advice and offer assistance on match days and training. The inductees to the Vikings hall of fame are presented with a blazer to commemorate the award and this is presented at the annual dinner.\nSenior team performance\n2012/2013 season\nWestern Vikings entered the league for the first time since 2006/07 and were given an away trip to Emerging Nomads to start the season.  Vikings won the game 24-17 with Paul Wheeldon scoring the first try since the resurrection.  The first home game brought Castletown to the QEII for their first trip to Peel, for some years.  Vikings lost this match 27-15 after losing some notable players to injury early in the game.\nIt can be seen as a successful season for Vikings having defeated Castletown 12-10, and Ramsey B 19-18.  They have also completed the double over Emerging Nomads with a 50-17 home win.  Vikings finished fourth in the Manx Shield and had the choice to play in either the Trophy or the Bowl for the remainder of the season.\nVikings opted to play against the better opposition in the Manx Trophy and, although having failed to register a win, have gained some much needed big match experience which will stand them in good stead for their second season in the Manx Shield.  Vikings finished the season with a disappointing 66-12 loss to Vagabonds B in the Manx Plate semi final.\nNumerous injuries have affected the season, most notably a handbag injury to team captain Mike Sheeley in only the fifth game of the season.  Even with these injuries Western Vikings have used over forty players in their comeback season which they will be looking to add to over the summer months.\n2013/2014 season\nThis is a landmark season for Vikings as it will be the 25th season that Western Vikings has been in existence.  Vikings have enjoyed a pre-season tour taking part in a seven's tournament in Cheshire where they left a positive lasting impression of Manx rugby on all teams they met. Pre-season training commenced on 4 July 2013 and is held weekly on Thursday at the QEII from 6.30pm onwards.\nOn 29 June 2013 Vikings held the Annual General Meeting.  A new captain was to be elected and Paul Wheeldon was unanimously selected to lead Vikings into the 2013/14 season.  Another major change was the appointment of long time club captain Paul Gale as head coach.  It was also announced that a coaching team was to be selected in order to progress the team on the pitch.\nThere will also be the need for a youth committee, which will be led by youth co-ordinator Chris Horton.  Horton will select a small committee that will handle the club's youth teams, players and coaches and the organization of matches and tournaments both on and off the island.\nVikings' season started on 14 September and they faced two tough away fixtures in the first two weeks.  First up was Douglas B who were one of the favourites for the title.  Vikings suffered a heavy defeat and that was followed up by another less heavy defeat at the hands of Vagabonds B the following week.\nTheir first home game was against Ramsey B and this brought about their first league win of the season.  Kevin Mellor was the pick of the players picking up two tries in the process.  Vikings then had another three tough games.  A very close game against Vagabonds B which resulted in a 23-15 loss was sandwiched in between two defeats by current Champions Southern Nomads.  Vikings then had a home match against Castletown at the QEII.  Vikings came away with the spoils and their highest winning score since the resurrection, defeating Town by 61 unanswered points.  Sam Radcliffe scored a hat trick of tries with Mark Venables picking up 21 points with a try and eight conversions.\nVikings managed another two more victories before the end of the Manx Shield campaign.  A close 8-7 home win over Emerging Nomads with Tony Grundy scoring the decisive penalty for Vikings.  Their other win was another close 13-12 victory over Castletown at Poulsom Park.  Mark Venables kicked the winning penalty with the last kick of the match.\nVikings finished the Manx Shield season one place worse off in joint fifth place in the Manx Shield however did finish with one more point than the previous season.  Vikings were defeated in the Manx Cup by Southern Nomads.  This relegated them to the Manx Plate where they beat Castletown 32-19 at Poulsom Park to reach their first final since the resurrection.  They played Vagabonds B team in the final however lost 66-5 at the home of their opponents.\nVikings finished the season without silverware after defeats in the final three games of the Manx Bowl.  The bowl was eventually won by Ramsey B after defeating Emerging Nomads in the final.\n2013/2014 awards\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"width:65%; font-size:95%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!width=5%|Nationality\n!width=45%|Player\n!width=40%|Award\n|- style=\"background:#fc3;\"\n|align=centre|\n|Paul Wheeldon\n|align=centre|Player of the Season\n|- style=\"background:#fc3;\"\n|align=centre|\n|Kevin Mellor\n|align=centre|Young Player of the Season\n|- style=\"background:#fc3;\"\n|align=centre|\n|Ashley Howard\n|align=centre|Most Improved Player of the Season\n|- style=\"background:#fc3;\"\n|align=centre|\n|Paul Wheeldon/Sam Radcliffe/Kevin Mellor (8)\n|align=centre|Top Try Scorer\n|- style=\"background:#fc3;\"\n|align=centre|\n|Mark Venables (63)\n|align=centre|Top Points Scorer\n|- style=\"background:#fc3;\"\n|align=centre|\n|Anna-Lena Kelly\n|align=centre|Clubmann of the Season\n|- style=\"background:#fc3;\"\n|align=centre|\n|Ryan Burke\n|align=centre|'''Captain's Bowl\n|- style=\"background:#fc3;\"\n|align=centre|\n|Chris Horton\n|align=centre|Chairman's Shield\n|- style=\"background:#fc3;\"\n|align=centre|\n|Anna-Lena Kelly & Lianne Watterson\n|align=centre|Supporter of the Season'''\n|}\n2014/15 Manx Shield fixtures\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
