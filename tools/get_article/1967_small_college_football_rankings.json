Separate rankings were published by the Associated Press (AP) and the United Press International (UPI). The AP rankings were selected by a board of sports writers, and the UPI rankings were selected by a board of small-college coaches.\nThe 1967 San Diego State Aztecs football team (10–1), led by head coach Don Coryell, was rated as the small-college champion by both the AP and UPI. The Aztecs' only loss was to a University Division team, Utah State. North Dakota State was ranked second by both, then lost to Texas–Arlington in the Pecan Bowl.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px; border:1px
