Control over all territories except most of the Japanese mainland (Hokkaido, Honshu, Kyushu, Shikoku, and some 6,000 small surrounding islands) was renounced by Japan in the unconditional surrender after World War II and the Treaty of San Francisco. A number of territories occupied by the United States after 1945 were returned to Japan, but there are still a number of disputed territories between Japan and Russia (the Kuril Islands dispute), South Korea and North Korea (the Liancourt Rocks dispute), the People's Republic of China and Taiwan (the Senkaku Islands dispute).\nPre-WWI\nColonies\n*Ryūkyū Kingdom - 1872\n*Taiwan and the Penghu Islands – 1895–1945\n*Karafuto – 1905–1943\n*Kantō – 1905–1945\n*Chōsen – 1910–1945\nOccupied territories\n*Japanese occupation of Gyeongbokgung 1894\n*Occupation of Peking 1900\nWWI\nColonies\n* Nan’yō 1919–1945\nOccupied territories\n* Japanese Occupation of Tsingtao\n* All ports and major towns in the Primorsky Krai and Siberia regions of Russia east of the city of Chita, from 1918 until gradually withdrawing in 1922.\n* North Sakhalin was occupied by Japan 1920–1925.\n* Japanese occupation of German colonial possessions\n** Japanese occupation of Mariana Islands, Marshall Islands, Palau Islands, Caroline Islands\n* Occupation of Istanbul 1918–1923.\n* Allied occupation of German New Guinea\nSiberian intervention\nOccupied territories\n* Japanese occupation of Vladivostok\nWorld War II\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
