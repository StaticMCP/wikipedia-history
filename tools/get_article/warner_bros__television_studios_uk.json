Television Productions UK) is a British creator and distributor of television content. The Group produces long-running television brands in drama, factual, documentary, factual entertainment, and history.\nEstablished in 1998 as Shed Productions, the company floated on AIM (Alternative Investment Market) in March 2005. The group has grown significantly since flotation and to date, five award-winning media companies: Ricochet, Twenty Twenty Television, Wall to Wall Media, and Outright Distribution have all joined the group.

Ricochet created and produces global brand Supernanny. Other programmes include: Extreme Dreams, ''It's Me or the Dog, Breaking into Tesco and Blood, Sweat and T-shirts''.\nShed acquired Outright Distribution (formerly Screentime Partners) in September 2006. The acquisition was a strategic move in order to maximise exploitation of the Group's IP through its own in-house distribution company, whilst growing third-party business.\nIn September 2007, Shed Productions had announced that they've continued their acquisition spree by taking over BAFTA award-winning British independent factual entertainment production house Twenty Twenty and placing it under Shed's combined holding company which was being named Shed Media Group. Brands include: The Choir, ''That'll Teach 'Em, Brat Camp, Evacuation, and The Sorcerer's Apprentice''.\nIn November 2007, Shed Media Group had announced that they've acquired British scripted and unscripted television production company Wall to Wall Media with Wall to Wall Media's distribution division Wall to Wall International being interrogated into Shed's own distribution arm Outright Distribution. A multiple BAFTA winner, Wall to Wall produces long-running brands including BBC One's Who Do You Think You Are? and New Tricks. Reality dramas include: ''1940's House and Frontier House. Docu-dramas include: The Day Britain Stopped and Filth: The Mary Whitehouse Story''. In 2008, Wall to Wall's Man on Wire won an Academy Award Oscar in the best Documentary Feature category.\nOn 5 August 2010, Warner Bros. Television secured a 55.75% stake in Shed Media. Warner Bros. completed its acquisition of a majority stake in Shed Media on 14 October. Under the deal, Shed Media will remain an independent company, but its global distribution arm, Outright Distribution, would be folded into the Warner's UK operation. The Shed management team held on to a 21.37% shareholding, with the remaining stake being split between a group of 27 key staff members. In January 2012, Shed Media Group had announced that they've launched an entertainment and comedy production company named Yalli Productions with a focus on developing Warner Bros' library formats to the UK market as well their own formats with Bert Gray heading the production company as the managing director.\nIn April 2012, Shed Media Group had announced that they've acquired a majority stake in London-based British factual entertainment television production company Renegade Pictures with its team continued to operate the acquired company in their London base as Renegade's production output will now be distributed by Warner Bros.' international television distribution division. Time Warner acquired 100% of Shed and renamed the group Warner Bros. Television Productions UK in June 2014. As of 2015 the name was completely phased out and all companies got completely integrated with new websites, however Shed Productions and Watershed became defunct with no new websites, little mentioning or integration.\nIn January 2015, Warner Bros. Television Production UK announced that they've merged their production company Watershed Television with Twenty Twenty to form a boarding team with Watershed retained its branding under Twenty Twenty along with managing director Mark Rubens continued to lead the label under Twenty Twenty joining them as their senior creative producer. The name was changed from Warner Bros. Television Productions UK to Warner Bros. Television Studios UK in 2020.\nReception\nAwards and nominations\nShed Media was nominated for Float of the Year in 2005 and won Deal of the Year 2006 in the Quoted Company Awards for its acquisition of Ricochet.
