In that election, the Labour Party had won less seats than the Conservative Party in the region of England despite winning a greater share of the vote.\nThe election produced an interesting anomaly in England as well as the nation at large - despite the Labour Party winning a greater share of the vote, the Conservative Party won an overall majority, both in the Commons and in England. This occurrence would next take place only in 2005 when the Labour Party would a win a majority of seats in England while the Conservative Party would accumulate a greater share of the vote (however, the Labour Party won a greater share of the vote than the Conservatives in the nation as a whole). This election also noted the highest ever voteshare as well as the total number of votes the Labour Party has ever recorded in any election in England as well as the nation at whole.\nThe narrow victory of the Conservative Party led to the return of Winston Churchill as prime minister and the start of 13 years of Conservative rule (the second longest period of one-party rule in the 20th century).\nResult Table\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Party\n!Seats won\n!Net change in seats\n!Total votes (in millions)\n!Voteshare\n!Change in voteshare\n|-\n|Conservative\n|271\n|18\n|11,622,704\n|48.76%\n| 4.92 pp\n|-\n|Labour\n|233\n|18\n|11,630,467\n|48.80%\n| 2.67 pp\n|-\n|Liberal\n|2\n|\n|537,434\n|2.26%\n| 7.13 pp\n|-\n|Other\n|0\n|\n|35,490\n|0.18%\n| 0.47 pp\n|-\n|Total\n|506\n|\n|23,826,095\n|100%\n|\n|}\n|48.76}}\n|48.80}}\n|2.26}}\n|0.18}}}}\n|53.55}}\n|46.04}}\n|0.39}}}}\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Thorpe, Andrew (1997).
