It was erected in 1847 by Lord Ellenborough, the Governor-General of India, as a memorial to the officers and men who fell during the Gwalior War in 1843.It had been vandalised over the years and was retored by INTACH, The Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage in 1990\nHistory\nThe Scindia Dynasty was the independent and formidable force in Central India in mid 19th century with large french based modernized army.\nAfter the death of Jankoji Rao Scindia, on 13 December 1843, Lord Ellenborough, Governor General of India, sought to crub Scindia's military power in Central India. He wrote a letter to the Maharani Tara Scindia of Gwalior warning her that she should dismiss a usurping regent and that the size of her army should be reduced. Maharani Tara resisted and did not comply, which triggered the Gwalior Campaign by the British East India Company.\nGen. Sir Hugh Gough, violating the treaty of 1804 with Gwalior, forded the Chambal river and invaded the city, which was known for its grand palaces and riches, on 29 December 1843. The Gwalior War at Maharajpura was fought under Sir Hugh with 14,000 men and 40 guns against the Gwalior State  under commander in chief Appa Sahib with 25,000 men and 150 guns. On the battlefield the British suffered a humongous loss of 979 casualties including the death of General Churchill. The Maharani Scindia lost 2000 men and 56 guns.\nOn the same day at Punniar,  from Maharajpura, the left flank of  Gough's troops under General Grey routed an army of 12,000 of the Gwalior State and captured 40 guns.\nDesign and architecture\nIt was designed by Colonel H Goodwyn of the Bengal Engineers  and constructed by Jessop and Company. It was conceptualised by Lord Ellenborough. The base is a single storied white marble structure with a spiral staircase leading to a marble cenotaph on the upper floor from the inside. The top of the monument is built like a Mughal 'chhatri' or umbrella supported by 8 bronze pillars.\nThe dome of the cenotaph is crowned with a bronze dome cast from guns captured from the Marathas. From here, the Hoogly river can be seen along with a view of the Howrah Bridge and the Vidyasagar Setu. However entry is restricted. The Kolkata Circular Railway passes alongside the memorial between the Eden Gardens and Prinsep Ghat railway stations, and provides a view of this monument.\nSee also\n* Victoria Memorial (India)\n* Lascar War Memorial\n* Shaheed Minar, Kolkata\nReferences\nExternal links"
