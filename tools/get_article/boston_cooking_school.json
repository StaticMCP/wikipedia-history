Hooper, who had observed the teaching of cookery at London's National School of Cookery, while passing through that city on her return from an extended trip to Australia. She persuaded the Association to authorize $100 to launch a similar school in Boston; The Boston Cooking School opened on March 10, 1879, at 158½ Tremont Street.\nThe first teacher was Miss Joanna Sweeney (about whom little is now known), who was engaged to teach the \"normal classes\" in basic cooking.  Tuition was purposefully kept low:  $1.50 for six lessons.  To cater to upper-class women (and their cooks), Maria Parloa was engaged to give lecture / demonstrations of more advanced cookery on alternate Saturdays. Mary Johnson Bailey Lincoln (Mrs. David A.) was invited to teach at the school in November, 1879; she later became the school's first principal.\nFollowing its successful start, the school was incorporated in 1882 as the Boston Cooking School Corporation; its first president was Mrs. Hooper.\nHistory\nIn 1884, Roberts Brothers of Boston published ''Mrs. Lincoln's Boston Cook Book:  What to Do and What Not to Do in Cooking.  According to Lincoln, \"This was done primarily to meet the need of a textbook for our pupils and save the copying of recipes.\"\nDuring Mary Lincoln's tenure, the Boston Cooking School instituted a number of special programs.  In 1880, the School joined forces with the Industrial Aid Society to offer free cooking classes in Boston's primarily-immigrant North End.  Special courses on nutrition were organized for students at the Harvard Medical School; classes on \"sick-room cookery\" were offered to nurses from several hospitals in Boston, as well as Concord, NH.\nSpecial lectures were given from time to time on topics ranging from anatomy and digestion by noted Boston physicians, to marketing \"by those experienced in that work.\"  Most noteworthy were lectures on the subject of food chemistry by Ellen H. Richards, the first woman to earn a degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the first woman in America to earn a degree in chemistry.  Richards later became a leader in the founding of the Home Economics movement in the United States.\nMrs. Lincoln served as principal until January, 1885, when a death in her family necessitated her resignation.  Subsequent principals included Miss Ida Maynard, and Mrs. Carrie M. Dearborn, both graduates of the school.\nIn 1889, Miss Fannie Merritt Farmer was invited to remain after her own graduation to serve as assistant principal to Mrs. Dearborn; she became principal following Mrs. Dearborn's death in 1891.  Five years later, the first edition of Farmer's Boston Cooking-School Cook Book was published by Little, Brown & Co. of Boston. Farmer is credited for using scientific methods and establishing the exact level measurement method. The book quickly became an American classic, and is still in print today.\nIn 1902, the Boston Cooking School became part of Boston's Simmons College.\nLegacy\nFannie Farmer left the Boston Cooking School in 1902, and subsequently opened Miss Farmer's School of Cookery, located in Huntington Chambers, 30 Huntington Avenue, Boston.\nAfter Fannie Farmer's death in 1915 at the age of 57, Alice Bradley became the owner and principal of the school until 1944.\nNotes\nReferences\nSee also\n* Anna Barrows, early 20th century cooking lecturer, an alumna\n* Alice Bradley [https://www.bwht.org/explore/hyde-park/ Boston Women's Heritage Trail]\nExternal links\n*Fannie Merritt Farmer at [http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100407191015/http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/html/authors/author_farmer.html Feeding America:  The Historic American Cookbook Project]\n*Mary Johnson Bailey Lincoln (Mrs. D.A.) at [https://web.archive.org/web/20111106155138/http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/html/authors/author_lincoln.html Feeding America:  The Historic American Cookbook Project]"
