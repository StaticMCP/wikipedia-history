The five-disc collection covers the Temptations' entire four-decade history, from the first recording of The Distants in 1959 (\"Come On\") to four new recordings by the then-current Temptations lineup of Ali-Ollie Woodson, Theo Peoples, Ron Tyson, and stalwart members Otis Williams and Melvin Franklin.\nThe first two discs and the first half of the third disc collect the original mono versions of the Temptations' most popular singles, including \"My Girl\", \"Ain't Too Proud to Beg\", and \"Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)\", and several b-sides, album tracks, and unreleased songs. The rest of the set continues on through the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s with later hits, album tracks, and unreleased songs.\nTrack listing\n- previously unreleased\n- mono 45 single, with stereo LP intro added to beginning\n- newly recorded song\nDisc 1: Early years\nAll tracks in mono.\n#\"Come On\" (by Otis Williams & the Distants) (Otis Williams, Johnnie Mae Matthews, J.
