If no one is elected, other rounds are held until a candidate receives 51 votes and becomes President of Latvia. The president of the Saeima chairs the electoral college.\nElections\nCandidates for the position of President of Latvia – [[Egils Levits, Juris Jansons and Didzis Šmits (from left to right)]]\nLatvia's parliament elected former European Court of Justice judge Egils Levits as the Baltic country's next president on Wednesday, a largely ceremonial role that also brings with it limited political powers.\nThe results of the vote were as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable centre\" style=text-align:right\n|+Results\n! colspan=2|Candidates\n! scope=col| Parties\n! scope=col| Votes\n! scope=col| %\n|-\n| bgcolor=#DCDCDC|\n|align=left|Egils Levits\n|align=left|Independent\n|61\n| 65,59\n|-\n| bgcolor=#c42027|\n|align=left| Didzis Šmits\n|align=left| KPV LV\n|24\n| 25,81\n|-\n| bgcolor=#DCDCDC|\n|align=left|Juris Jansons\n|align=left|Independent\n|8\n| 8,60\n|- bgcolor=#EEE\n| colspan=5|\n|-\n| align=left colspan=3  | Valides votes\n| 93\n| 97,89\n|-\n| align=left colspan=3  | Blank and invalid votes\n| 2\n| 2,11\n|-\n| align=left colspan=3  | Total\n| 95\n| 100\n|-\n| align=left colspan=3  | Abstention\n| 5\n| 5,00\n|-\n| align=left colspan=3  | Registered voters / turnout\n| 100\n| 95,00\n|}\nHaving received 61 votes, Levits began serving a four-year term starting on July 8, when incumbent president Raimonds Vējonis' term came to an end.\nReferences"
