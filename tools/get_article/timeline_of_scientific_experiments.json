He proves that the skin disease scabies is caused by a parasite, a discovery which upsets the Hippocratic and Galenic theory of humorism.\n13th century\n* 1200 – Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi observes and examines a large number of skeletons, and he discovered that Galen was incorrect regarding the formation of the bones of the lower jaw and sacrum.\n* 1242 – Ibn al-Nafis carries out autopsies which leads him to the discovery of pulmonary circulation and the circulatory system.\n*Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī provides the first correct explanation of the rainbow phenomenon and uses the experimental method to prove his theory.\n* Albertus Magnus documents that nitric acid can dissolve silver and the resulting silver nitrate solution will blacken skin.\n16th century\n*1572 – Tycho Brahe observes the 1572 supernova, evidence against the Aristotelian notion of an immutable heavenly sphere.\n17th century\n*1609 – Galileo Galilei observes moons of Jupiter in support of the heliocentric model.\n*1638 – Galileo Galilei uses rolling balls to disprove the Aristotelian theory of motion.\n*1665 – Robert Hooke, using a microscope, observes cells.\n*1672 – Isaac Newton publishes the results of his Prism experiments, demonstrating the existence in white light of a mixture of distinct coloured rays.\n*1676 – Ole Rømer measures the speed of light for the first time.\n*1687 – Isaac Newton publishes the thought experiment ''Newton's cannonball'', hypothesizes that the force of gravity is universal and is the key force for planetary motion.\n18th century\n*1747 – James Lind: Conducts one of the earliest European clinical trials, showing that scurvy was cured by consuming fresh oranges and lemons, but not other tested acids or drinks.\n*1774 – Charles Mason: Conducts an experiment near the Scottish mountain of Schiehallion that attempts to measure the mean density of the Earth for the first time. Known as the Schiehallion experiment.\n*1796 – Edward Jenner: tests the first vaccine.\n*1798 – Henry Cavendish: Torsion bar experiment to measure Newton's gravitational constant.\n19th century\n*1801 – Thomas Young: double-slit experiment demonstrates the wave nature of light.\n*1820 – Hans Christian Ørsted discovers the connection between electricity and magnetism.\n*1843 – James Prescott Joule measures the equivalence between mechanical work and heat, resulting in the law of conservation of energy.\n*1845 – Christian Doppler demonstrates the Doppler shift.\n*1851 – Léon Foucault uses Foucault pendulum to demonstrate the rotation of the Earth.\n*1859 – Charles Darwin publishes The Origin of Species showing that evolution occurs by natural selection.\n*1861 – Louis Pasteur disproves the theory of spontaneous generation.\n*1863 – Gregor Mendel's pea plant experiments (Mendel's laws of inheritance).\n*1887 – Heinrich Hertz discovers the photoelectric effect.\n*1887 – Michelson and Morley: Michelson–Morley experiment, showing that the speed of light is invariant.\n*1896 – Henri Becquerel discovers radioactivity.\n*1897 – J. J. Thomson discovers the electron.\n20th century\n*1909 – Robert Millikan: oil-drop experiment which suggests that electric charge occurs as quanta (the electron).\n*1911 – Ernest Rutherford's gold foil experiment determines that atoms are mostly empty space, and that the core of each atom, which he named the atomic nucleus, is dense and positively charged\n*1911 – Heike Kamerlingh Onnes: superconductivity.\n*1914 - James Franck and Gustav Ludwig Hertz conduct the Franck–Hertz experiment demonstrating quantization of atomic ionization energy.\n*1919 – Arthur Eddington: The Sun as gravitational lens, a proof of the theory of relativity.\n*1920 – Otto Stern and Walter Gerlach conduct the Stern–Gerlach experiment, which demonstrates particle spin.\n*1920 – John B. Watson and Rosalie Rayner conduct the Little Albert experiment.\n*1928 – Griffith's experiment shows that living cells can be transformed via a transforming principle, later discovered to be DNA.\n*1934 – Enrico Fermi splits the atom.\n*1935 – Lady tasting tea experiment by Ronald A. Fisher, foundational in statistical hypothesis testing.\n*1940 – Karl von Frisch decodes the \"dance\" honeybees use to communicate the location of flowers.\n*1944 – Barbara McClintock breeds maize plants for color, which leads to the discovery of jumping genes.\n*1947 – John Bardeen and Walter Brattain fabricate the first working transistor.\n*1951 – Solomon Asch shows how group pressure can persuade an individual to conform to an obviously wrong opinion.\n*1952 – Alfred Hershey & Martha Chase: Hershey–Chase experiment proves that DNA is the hereditary material .\n*1953 – Stanley L. Miller & Harold C. Urey: Miller–Urey experiment demonstrates that organic compounds can arise spontaneously from inorganic ones.\n*1955 – Clyde L. Cowan and Frederick Reines confirm the existence of the neutrino in the neutrino experiment.\n*1958 – Meselson–Stahl experiment proves that DNA replication is semiconservative.\n*1960 – B. F. Skinner's demonstrations of operant conditioning.\n*1961 – Francis Crick, Sydney Brenner, Leslie Barnett and R.J. Watts-Tobin prove the triplet nature of the genetic code.\n*1961 – Marshall W. Nirenberg and J. Heinrich Matthaei deciphered the first codon of the genetic code.\n*1964 – Marshall W. Nirenberg and Philip Leder deciphered the rest of the genetic code.\n*1965 – Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson find cosmic microwave background radiation, evidence of the Big Bang.\n*1967 – Kerim Kerimov launches the Cosmos 186 and Cosmos 188 as experiments on automatic docking eventually leading to the development of space stations.\n*1970 – Allan and Beatrix Gardner teach American Sign Language to the chimpanzee Washoe.\n*1974 – Stanley Milgram conducts the Milgram experiment on obedience to authority.\n*1995 – Eric A. Cornell and Carl E. Wieman synthesize Bose–Einstein condensate.\nSee also\n*List of timelines of science and technology\n*List of experiments\n*Timeline of the history of the scientific method\n*Timeline of scientific discoveries\n*Timeline of historic inventions\nReferences"
