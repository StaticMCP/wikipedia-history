Having forgotten about the film, he \"discovers\" it again in a book by Meir Schnitzer concerning Israeli cinema. The review in Schnitzer's book caused the film to be labelled as \"the worst film ever made in Israel\".\nThe first part of Looking for Moshe Guez focuses on the search in Israel, which was produced between 1971 and 1976, with Guez as the film director, screenwriter, star, cinematographer, recorder and editor. Among the participants who remember Guez or his film are journalist Lisa Peretz, who described it as the \"Israeli Ed Wood\", and the actress Ophelia Struhl,. The second part of the film, which takes part in the Boston area where Guez and his family have been living since the 1980s, enables us to see for the first time scenes from the \"director's cut\".\nCast\n*\n* Moshe Guez\n* Shulamit Guez\n* Ofer Guez\n* Yair Partok\n* Eli Sandler\n* Miri Ben David\n* Karin Dadon\n* Liraz Gadri\n* Lisa Peretz\n* Shuki Gazit\n* Geula Gazit\n* Zehava Damari\n* Shalom Damari\n* Dror Yizhar\nProduction\nThe film was produced by Gidi Avivi for Noga Communications – Channel 8 with the support of the Yehoshua Rabinovich Foundation for the Arts – Cinema Project.\nReception\nCritical response\nAvner Shavit, the film critic of Walla, describes the unique manner in which Livny presents Guez's story, without being judgmental or condescending. Shavit sees the film as \"a moving, fascinating and unforgettable work of art about the different dimensions of the endless passion for film, about the eccentric dimension of local culture, and about the fact that time sometimes does not heal wounds, only makes them more painful.\"\nFestivals, awards and nominations\nThe premiere screening of Looking for Moshe Guez took place at the Haifa International Film Festival, on October 19, 2011. The film was selected to the 2011 edition of IDFA's Docs for Sale.\nSee also\n* Ed Wood (film)\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n* Looking for Moshe Guez on [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304033805/https://www.idfa.nl/industry/tags/project.aspx?id=62F2F0B1-2971-483E-83F0-B2039BD3A4C1&tab=dfs IDFA's Docs for Sale]"
