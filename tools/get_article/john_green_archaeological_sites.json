The sites are rare in southeastern Virginia for containing both precontact and postcontact artifacts.  Excavations of the sites have yielded colonial trade items as well as evidence of settlement, including housing remnants, waste pits, and human burials.\nThe sites were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Greensville County, Virginia\nReferences"
