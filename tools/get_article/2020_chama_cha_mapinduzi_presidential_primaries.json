Incumbent president and 2015 nominee, John Magufuli, ran unopposed for his second term for the President of Tanzania and so there was no primary vote for the Union presidency position. However, Zanzibar president Ali Mohamed Shein is ineligible for re-election due to term limits and a primary was held to determine the Zanzibar presidential nominee. The winners of the primary are the CCM candidates for the 2020 Tanzanian general election and the 2020 Zanzibari general election.\nBackground\nPresidential aspirants must submit their intent to run to the party by June 30, 2020. Each aspirant has to be able to collect 250 sponsors from 12 regions (including 2 from Zanzibar). The party secretariat convened in Dodoma in July to make their decisions. The candidates were vetted by the party congress and names of a select few will be submitted to the National Executive Committee of the party to select the candidate.\nUnion Presidential Candidates\nIncumbent president Dr John Magufuli and party chairman ran unopposed to get the party ticket for re-election. Former foreign minister of Tanzania Bernard Membe intended to collect party nomination forms to contest against the incumbent president, however, the CCM central committee expelled Membe from the party. Following the decision, he returned his party card to leave the party.\nZanzibar Presidential Candidates\nThe following candidates have been listed according to the dates that they expressed interest or formally announced their candidacy.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"background-color:#228B22;color: white\" |Candidate\n! style=\"background-color:#228B22;color: white\" class=\"unsortable\" |Background\n! style=\"background-color:#228B22;color: white\" class=\"unsortable\" |Notes\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Makamba\" |}}\n|\n* Born 1950 (age 70), Hometown: Unguja, Zanzibar\n* Alma mater: Columbia University\n* Tanzanian Diplomat and Ambassador\n|\n* Son of 1st President of Zanzibar, Abeid Karume\n* Brother of 6th President of Zanzibar, Amani Abeid Karume\n|-\n|}}\n|\n* Born 1966 (age 53), Hometown: Unguja, Zanzibar\n* Alma mater: Marmara University (MD), Hammersmith Hospital (PhD)\n* Member of Parliament for Kwahani\n* Minister of Defence and National Service in Magufuli cabinet\n|\n* Son of 2nd President of Tanzania, Ali Hassan Mwinyi\n* Decaled candidacy on June 18, 2020\n|-\n|}}\n|\n* Retired Major General in Tanzania People's Defence Force\n* Ex-Tanzanian Ambassador to Egypt (2017-2019)\n|\n* Decaled candidacy on June 18, 2020\n|-\n|}}\n|\n|\n* Decaled candidacy on June 18, 2020\n|-\n|}}\n|\n|\n* Decaled candidacy on June 18, 2020\n|-\n|}}\n|\n|\n* Decaled candidacy on June 18, 2020\n|-\n|}}\n|\n* Born 1962 (age 57), Hometown: Unguja, Zanzibar\n* Alma mater:UDSM (BA), OUT (LL.B)\n* Former Chief Minister of Zanzibar\n* Former Union Minister\n|\n* Decaled candidacy on June 18, 2020\n|-\n|}}\n|\n* Former Member of Parliament Chumbuni\n|\n* Declared candidacy on June 19, 2020\n|-\n|}}\n|\n* Minister of Information and Tourism in Zanzibar\n|\n* Son of Zanzibar revolutionary Thabit Kombo\n|-\n|}}\n|\n|\n* Declared candidacy on June 19, 2020\n|-\n|}}\n|\n|\n* Declared candidacy on June 19, 2020\n|-\n|}}\n|\n* Born 1961 (age 59), Hometown: Pemba, Zanzibar\n* Alma mater: Astrakhan State TU (MSc), University of NSW (PhD)\n* Member of Parliament\n* Minister of Water and Irrigation in Magufuli cabinet\n|\n* Declared candidacy on June 19, 2020\n|-\n|}}\n|\n|\n* First female presidential aspirant\n* Declared candidacy on June 19, 2020\n|-\n|}}\n|\n* Former chairman Zanzibar Election Commission\n|\n* Declared candidacy on June 20, 2020\n|-\n|}}\n|\n* Held previous ministerial positions in the Zanzibar Government\n|\n* Son of 2nd President of Zanzibar, Aboud Jumbe\n* Declared candidacy on June 26, 2020\n|}\nDeclined to Run\n* Samia Suluhu, Vice-President of Tanzania, declined to run for the election ticket. citing that the move would be a demotion from her current title.\nResults\nUnion Presidency\nSince John Magufuli ran unopposed, he was automatically nominated as the party's candidate as the nominee for the president of Tanzania.\nZanzibar Presidency\nCentral Committee\nOn July 9, 2020, the central committee picked 5 names from the list of over 31 presidential aspirants.
