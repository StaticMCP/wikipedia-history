For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3. c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\n8 & 9 Geo. 6\nContinuing the tenth session of the 37th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 29 November 1944 until 15 June 1945.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 8 & 9 G. 6.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n|  and Part II of the Nurses (Scotland) Act, 1943.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  upon the liability which may be undertaken by guarantees given under section one of that Act; to provide for the giving of guarantees for the purpose of encouraging the participation of the United Kingdom in external trade transactions; and for purposes connected therewith.|note4= }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  or section sixty-five of the Police (Scotland) Act, 1857; to provide for the appointment of Chief Inspectors for England and Wales and for Scotland respectively; and to amend the law as to the reports upon matters affecting the police which are to be laid annually before Parliament.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  to extend the enactments relating to the superannuation of teachers to certain persons employed in connection with the provision of educational services otherwise than as teachers, and to make other amendments of the law relating to the superannuation of teachers and such persons as aforesaid.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  and to make further provision with respect to local loans and the borrowing powers of local authorities.}}\n|\n-\n|  to extend the period during which certain of such schemes may continue in force, and to amend subsection (2) of the said section as respects the Aden Protectorate.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and to extend the powers of trustees of trustee savings banks to invest in securities issued to them under that Act moneys received by them in respect of special investments.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  to the Minister of Education.|note4= }}\n|  relating to burial grounds and for purposes connected therewith.}}\n|\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  for periods of less than one year.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  to amend certain of the enactments relating to compensation in respect of land; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.}}\n|\n}}\nLocal acts\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  and 1924.|note4=|po1=Church of\nSaint Mary Gravesend Order.|po1short=n|}}\n|  relating to Port Glasgow Gas and Burgh.|po1=Port Glasgow Gas and Burgh Order 1945|Provisional Order to confer on the provost magistrates and councillors of the burgh of Port Glasgow further powers in connection with their gas undertaking and for the good government of the burgh and for other purposes.}}\n|  for the redemption and extinction of certain perpetual annuities.}}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n}}\n9 & 10 Geo. 6\nThe first session of the 38th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 1 August 1945 until 6 November 1946.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 9 & 10 G. 6.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n|  and to indemnify them from any penal consequences which they may have incurred by sitting and voting as members of that House.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and 1941; for validating elections held after such postponement; for amending the said Acts and removing doubts arising thereon; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n|  on His Majesty in Council to be delegated as well by Order of His Majesty in Council as by an instrument passed under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom, and to amend the provisions of that Act with respect to the persons to whom those powers may be delegated.}}\n|  may be made to a referee; and for purposes connected therewith.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and 1939.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  as amended by the Public Health Act, 1904, relating to epidemic, endemic or infectious diseases.}}\n|  periods of war service or war employment.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n}}\nLocal acts\nrelating to Newcastle-upon-Tyne trolley vehicles.|note4=|po1=Newcastle-upon-Tyne Corporation (Trolley Vehicles) Order 1945|Order authorising the lord mayor aldermen and citizens of the city and county of Newcastle-upon-Tyne to use trolley vehicles upon additional routes in the said city and county and in the county borough of Gateshead in the county of Durham.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  and for the transfer of the powers and duties of the said conservators to the mayor aldermen and burgesses of the borough of Reigate to confer further powers on the Corporation in regard to their electricity undertaking lands and other matters to make further and better provision for the improvement health local government and finances of the borough and for other purposes.|note4= }}\n|  to confer further powers upon the Manchester Ship Canal Company and for other purposes.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|\n}}\nSee also\n*List of acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom\nReferences"
