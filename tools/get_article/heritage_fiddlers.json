The group was originally called Tammy's Peerie Angels, then Shetland's Young Heritage. The group is now called Heritage Fiddlers''' as the members felt they \"couldna git awa wi da young bit onymare so wir noo kent as Shetland's Heritage Fiddlers.\"\nProminent Shetland born fiddler Catriona MacDonald is an ex-member.\nDiscography\n*Visions – Released 1993 – Catalogue No: SYHCD001\n*Bridging The Gap – Released 1997 – Catalogue No: SYHCD002\nReferences"
