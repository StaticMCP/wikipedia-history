When Serbia started trying to evade economic and political control by the Habsburgs and to build links with other countries, particularly Bulgaria, Germany and France, the Hungarian government decided to punish the Serbs with economic sanctions. Specifically, in an attempt to reduce its economic dependence on Austria-Hungary, Serbia began to import French, rather than Austro-Hungarian, munitions and established a commercial treaty with Germany in 1904 and a customs union with Bulgaria in 1905 that ended the sale of tariff-laden Austrian goods in Serbia.\nHistory\nLong used to setting economic policy, Austria-Hungary responded in April 1906 by closing its borders to Serbian pork. Serbia refused to bow to Vienna, gained French investment to build new packing plants for international trade, began to order materials from the Austro-Hungarian rival Germany\nand pressured the Austrian-administered provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina for a trade outlet on the Adriatic Sea. That caused Austria-Hungary to concede the conflict by March 1908, as can be shown by the trade statistics of the period in question:\n{|  border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 10px 0 10px 25px; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #AAA solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%; float: center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=10 style=\"background: #efefef; border-bottom: 2px solid gray;\" | Foreign Trade of the Kingdom of SerbiaEB1911 page 688\n|-\n|\n| 1904\n| 1905\n| 1906\n| 1907\n| 1908\n|-\n| Exports (thousand GBP):\n| 2,486\n| 2,879\n| 2,864\n| 3,259\n| 3,019\n|-\n| Imports (thousand GBP):\n| 2,437\n| 2,224\n| 1,773\n| 2,823\n| 3,025\n|-\n| Trade Balance (thousand GBP):\n| 49\n| 655\n| 1,091\n| 436\n| -6\n|-\n| Exports/Imports (%):Rounded to the nearest %\n| 102\n| 129\n| 162\n| 115\n| 100\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n*Austro–Serbian Alliance of 1881\nReferences\n*Misha Glenny, The Balkans 1804-1999: Nationalism, War and the Great Powers (London: Granta, 1999), pp.&nbsp;281–2."
