Lieutenant governors are elected for a term of four years in the same general election as the U.S. president and take office the following January.\nAs in many other U.S. state legislatures, the lieutenant governor also serves as the President of the Delaware Senate, though they can only cast a vote in the event of a tie.\nThe Office of Lieutenant Governor was created by the Constitution of Delaware, and the first election took place in 1900.\nAlthough in practice the candidate for lieutenant governor is nominated as a ticket with the candidate for governor, the offices of governor and lieutenant governor are voted on separately in Delaware. In 1972, 1976, and 1984, the governor and lieutenant governor were elected from different parties.\nKyle Evans Gay is the current lieutenant governor, having taken office January 21, 2025.\nThe offices of the lieutenant governor are at the state capital of Dover.\nList\n; Parties\n!\n!Image\n!Lt.
