Originally released as a double LP, the cover artwork and inside gatefold sleeve feature imitations of Andy Warhol's paintings of Coca-Cola bottles, but are credited to other artists on the back sleeve of the album. The album was released in the UK to capitalise on the interest from Warhol's Pork.\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Lou Reed unless otherwise noted.\nDisc 1\n| length1 = 2:53\n| title2 = I Heard Her Call My Name\n| note2 = from White Light/White Heat, 1968\n| length2 = 4:05\n| title3 = Femme Fatale\n| note3 = from The Velvet Underground & Nico, 1967\n| length3 = 2:35\n| title4 = Heroin\n| note4 = from The Velvet Underground & Nico, 1967\n| length4 = 7:05\n| title5 = Here She Comes Now\n| note5 = from White Light/White Heat, 1968\n| writer5 =\n| length5 = 2:00\n| title6 = There She Goes Again\n| note6 = from The Velvet Underground & Nico, 1967\n| length6 = 2:30\n}}\nDisc 2\n| length1 = 17:00\n| title2 = Venus in Furs\n| note2 = from The Velvet Underground & Nico, 1967\n| length2 = 5:07\n}}\n|length1=7:40\n|title2=Pale Blue Eyes\n|note2=from The Velvet Underground, 1969\n|length2=5:40\n|title3=The Black Angel's Death Song\n|note3=from The Velvet Underground & Nico, 1967\n|writer3=\n|length3=3:10\n|title4=Beginning to See the Light\n|note4=from The Velvet Underground, 1969\n|length4=4:48\n}}\n[http://www.allmusic.com/album/andy-warhols-velvet-underground-r51959 link]\n|rev2 = Discogs\n|rev2score = (4.6/5) [http://www.discogs.com/Velvet-Underground-Andy-Warhols-Velvet-Underground-Featuring-Nico/master/35329 link]\n| rev3 = The Encyclopedia of Popular Music\n| rev3Score =\n|rev4 = MusicBrainz\n|rev4score =  [http://musicbrainz.org/release/bb66b501-bac6-4432-b16f-da04a5ccc70b.html link]\n}}\nPersonnel\nAdapted from liner notes:\n;The Velvet Underground\n* Lou Reed - vocals, guitar, piano\n* John Cale - vocals, electric viola, organ, bass guitar\n* Sterling Morrison - vocals, guitar, bass guitar\n* Maureen Tucker - percussion\nNote: Doug Yule is not credited, although he provides lead vocals on \"Candy Says\", as well as bass guitar on \"Pale Blue Eyes\" and \"Beginning to See the Light\", as he replaced John Cale on the band's third album.
