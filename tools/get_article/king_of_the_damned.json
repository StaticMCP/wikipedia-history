Variety, reviewing a production, wrote \"some very good character acting makes this good entertainment.\"\nFilm rights were bought by Gaumont British who converted the play into a vehicle for Conrad Veidt.\nTo avoid the usual French protests on films depicting Devil's Island, the producers gave all locations Spanish names and set the film in the Caribbean. Variety reported in its review of the movie that it was \"difficult to locale the settlement. It is somewhere in the Caribbean. The officers have Spanish names and the garrote is used at executions, but most of the officers and practically all of the convicts speak  with a pronounced British accent...It makes for a rather polyglot affair.\"\nNonetheless, the film was banned in France.\nFilming took place in July 1935.\nReception\nVariety'' felt Veidt \"excellent actor though he is.. is miscast in this role of the\nconvict leader. He is seldom convincing, and rarely dominant.  Beery takes the honors away from\nhim because of a more vibrant personality and the fact that he gets what little comedy there is.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
