It was signed in Mangaluru and brought an end to the Second Anglo-Mysore War.\nBackground\nHyder Ali became dalwai Dalavayi of Mysore by force in 1761 displacing the Wodeyar Dynasty which had previously ruled the Kingdom. In 1766, war with the British broke out and Hyder's forces came close to capturing Madras, before his attacks began to falter. The war ended three years later with the Treaty of Madras in April 1769. This provided the mutual restoration of all conquests as well as mutual aid and alliance in a defensive war.\nThe Second Anglo-Mysore war broke out for a number reasons, primary among them being that Hyder Ali considered the British in breach of the treaty of April 1769 since they provided no aid in Mysore's defensive war with the Marathas. War with the British broke out in 1780 when Hyder led 80,000-90,000 men into the Carnatic region burning and destroying much of the countryside around the British strongholds of Vellore and Madras.\nThe British sent an army of about 5,000 men to lift the siege of Arcot by Hyder who retaliated with an opposing force of about 10,000 men under the command of Tipu Sultan, his son. Tipu led his force to a crushing victory over the British at Pollilur. The British lost about 4,000 men during this battle which was the worst defeat of the British East India Company to date in India. Hyder continued his siege and Tipu continued to menace the British in the Carnatic region.\nTipu won another victory against the Company in 1782 when he defeated Colonel Braithwaite at Tanjore. The entire force of about 2,000 men and about 10 field pieces were either killed or captured. By the end of 1781, the British began their counterattack. In quick succession, the British won the battles of Porto Novo, 2nd Pollilur, Sholinghur and the siege of Negapatam. In 1782, Hyder suddenly died, and Tipu became king. In 1783, the British took the town of Coimbatore and by January 1784, Tipu retook Mangalore from the British. With neither side in a position to win, the war ended in stalemate and was then concluded with the Treaty of Mangalore.\nConsequences\nThe great advantage of the treaty to Tipu was the psychological impact of the actual treaty on the British. The Commissioner for the British East India Company in Madras had to go to Mangalore, a recent reconquest of Tipu's, on the opposite coast of India, to sign the treaty. The humiliation of the Treaty (coupled with the recent loss of the Thirteen Colonies, in America) made the British determined to defeat Tipu.\nThe Treaty of Mangalore in Britain was seen by many as the beginning of the end of the British East India Company. As a result, stock prices in the Company dived and the British East India Company began to fail. This was of great concern to the British government since its trade represented a sixth of the British national income. It was decided to fix the problems through what is now called Pitt's India Act. This act solved the issues of corruption, and it invested powers in the Governor-General to act in the interest of King and Country to stop an issue like the Treaty of Mangalore from happening again.\nText\nTREATY Honourable the English East India Company and the Nawab Tipu Sultan Bahadur, on his own behalf; for the countries of Seringapatam Hyder Nagur etc. and all his other possessions settled by Anthony Sadlier, George Leonard Staunton and John Hudleston Esquires, on behalf of the Honourable English East India Company for all their possessions, and for the Carnatic Payen Ghaut, by virtue of powers delegated to the Right Honourable the President & Select Committee of Fort St. George for that purpose, by the Honourable the Governor General & Council appointed by the King & Parliament of Great Britain, to direct & controul all political affairs of the Honourable English East India Company in India, by the said Nawab agreeably to the following Articles, which are to be strictly and invariably, observed as long as the Sun & Moon shall last, by both parties, that is to say, by the English Company & the three Governments of Bengal, Madras, and Bombay, and the Nawab Tipu Sultan Bahadur.\nArticle 1st.—Peace & friendship shall immediately take place between the said Company the Nawab Tipu Sultan Bahadur & their friends, and allies, particularly including therein the Rajahs of Tanjore & Travencore, who are friends & allies to the English and the Carnatic Payen Ghaut, also Tipu Sultan's friends & allies, the Biby of Cannanore, and the Rajahs or Zamindars of the Malabar coast, are included in this treaty, the English will not directly or indirectly assist the enemies of the Nawab Tipu Sultan Bahadur nor make war upon his friends or allies, and the Nawab Tipu Sultan Bahadur will not directly or indirectly assist the enemies, nor make war upon the friends or allies of the English.\nArticle 2nd.—Immediately after signing and sealing the Treaty by the Nawab Tipu Sultan Bahadur and the three English Commissioners, the said Nawab shall send orders for the complete evacuation of the Carnatic, and the restoration of all the forts and places in it, now possessed by his troops, the forts of Amboorgur and Satgur excepted; & such evacuation and restoration shall actually & effectually be made in the space of thirty days from the day of signing the treaty, and the said Nawab shall also immediately after signing the treaty send orders for the release of all the persons who were taken & made prisoners in the late war, and now alive, whether European or Native, and for their being safely conducted to & delivered at such English Forts or Settlements, as shall be nearest to the places where they now are, so that the said release & delivery of the prisoners shall actually & effectually be made in thirty days from the day of signing the Treaty; the Nawab will cause them to be supplied with provisions and conveyances for the journey, the expense of which shall be made good to him by the company.
