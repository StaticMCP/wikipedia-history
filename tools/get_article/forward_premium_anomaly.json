This is perceived as puzzling in the context of the hypothesis that the expected future change in the exchange rate between two countries is equal to the interest-rate differential between these two countries; this hypothesis suggests that if all currencies are equally risky, investors would demand higher interest rates on currencies expected to fall in value. See . Thus, appreciation of the domestic currency when domestic interest rates are greater than foreign interest rates is called an anomaly.\nReferences\nSee also\n*Economic puzzle\n*Real exchange-rate puzzles\n*Equity premium puzzle\n*Peso problem (finance)"
