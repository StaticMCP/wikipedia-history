It is administered by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) through the IAU's Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams (CBAT).\nOrigins\nEdgar Wilson was an American businessman who lived in Lexington, Kentucky. After he died in 1976, the Edgar Wilson Charitable Trust Fund was set up and awards were allocated in accordance with the terms of his bequest.\nEligibility\nEach year the award is divided between amateur astronomers who during that year, using amateur equipment, discover one or more new comets which are then officially named after them. The annual total award is of the order of US$20,000 but fluctuates from year to year. Since 2014 the award was not given, but reestablished in 2024 (without a donated price). In any year when there are no eligible discoverers, CBAT makes the award to the amateur astronomer or astronomers it considers \"have made the greatest contribution toward promoting an interest in the study of comets\".\nRecipients\nAlthough the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory has awarded the recipients, after 2014 the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams could confirm in 2024 that the awards for the comet discoveries in the period July 2014 – June 2018 had been given.\nA list of recipients current to 2024:\n* 2024\n** Hideo Nishimura, Japan (C/2023 P1)\n** Gennadii Borisov, Russia (C/2023 T2)\n** Jordi Camarasa, Spain; and Grzegorz Duszanowicz, Sweden (C/2023 V4)\n** Xing Gao and Xi Liao, China; Robson Henrique dos Santos Hahn, Germany (P/2024 FG9)\n* 2023\n** Alain Maury, Chile; and Georges Attard, France (C/2022 N1)\n** Jost Jahn, Germany (P/2023 C1)\n*2022\n** Hideo Nishimura, Japan (C/2021 O1)\n** Alain Maury, Chile; and Georges Attard, France (P/2021 U3, C/2021 X1, C/2022 J1)\n*2021\n** Leonardo S.

(Here, an \"award\" is taken to mean one full award, meaning that some teams of two people—in cases of CCD discoveries—represent single cash awards that are split evenly between the team members, even though each member gets their own award plaque.)\nSee also\n* List of astronomy awards\nReferences\n}}"
