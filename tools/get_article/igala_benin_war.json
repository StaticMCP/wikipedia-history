Some Benin nobles who were unhappy with the decision betrayed the Oba for the Ata of Igala.\nThe war\nThe Igala–Benin War's outcome was significantly influenced by two key factors. Firstly, the war took a dramatic turn when the servant of Queen Idia managed to assassinate the Igala general, disrupting their command structure and weakening their forces. Secondly, under the reign of Oba Esigie, the Benin Kingdom benefited from Portuguese firepower and military assistance, giving them a significant advantage in terms of weaponry and tactics. These combined factors played a crucial role in Benin's victory and the relatively easier path to success during this historical conflict.\nAftermath\nThe war played a significant role in the Afro-Portuguese relations in the 16th century. It also played a role in slavery by the Europeans since the Benin Kingdom sold slaves to the Portuguese and other European merchants.\nSee also\n* Akure–Benin War\nReferences\nBibliographies\n*\n*\n*"
