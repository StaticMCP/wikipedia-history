An electoral college was elected on 11 February, which in turn elected the president on 25 February. They were the last indirect presidential elections controlled by the government of Chun Doo-hwan under the new 1980 constitution. Chun was re-elected with 90% of the electoral college vote.\nBackground\nRising to prominence as the leader of the military after the assassination of former military dictator of South Korea Park Chung-hee, Security Commander Chun Doo-hwan successfully forced Park's successor Choi Kyu-hah to step down from the presidency and became president himself through the indirect elections of 1980.\nHe then revised the Constitution on 27 October 1980. The revised constitution was slightly less authoritarian than its predecessor. Among other things, it changed the presidential election system. Although it was still an indirect election by the electoral college, opposition candidates were now allowed to enter. The president was limited to a single seven-year term without the possibility of re-election, and any change allowing re-election was blocked from taking effect for the president in office at the time of amendment. However, this had no effect on the political landscape. Chun had jailed most prominent opposition politicians, including former NDP chairman Kim Young-sam, 1971 NDP presidential nominee Kim Dae-jung, and former prime minister Kim Jong-pil, all three of whom would later face Chun's handpicked successor, Roh Tae-Woo, in the 1987 presidential election.\nPresidential nominations\nThe Democratic Justice Party (DJP) National Convention was held on 15 January at Jamsil Gymnasium in Seoul. At the convention, 3,162 delegates from around the nation nominated the sitting President Chun Doo-hwan without a vote.\nThe Democratic Korea Party (DKP) National Convention was held on 17 January at the Sejong Center for Performing Arts in Seoul. Yu Chi-song, a former 3-term lawmaker from Gyeonggi, was nominated as the party's candidate for president.\nThe Korea Nationalist Party (KNP) National Convention was held on 23 January at the Sejong Center for Performing Arts, and saw Kim Chong-cheol, a former five-term lawmaker from South Chungcheong, nominated.\nThe Civil Rights Party National Convention was held on 23 January at the Cheondo Hall; Kim Eui-taek, a former four-term lawmaker from South Jeolla was chosen as the party's candidate.\nOther political parties including the Democratic Socialist Party, the Socialist Party and the New Politics Party announced they would not be participating in the elections as they were not capable of finding viable candidates for president or the electoral college.\nElectoral College nominations\n{| class=\"wikitable nowrap\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Province/City\n! rowspan=\"3\" width=\"50px\"|Seats\n! colspan=\"6\" |Candidates nominated\n|-\n! width=\"50px\" |DJP\n! width=\"50px\" |DKP\n! width=\"50px\" |KNP\n! width=\"50px\" |CRP\n! width=\"50px\" |DSP\n! width=\"50px\" |Ind.\n|-\n! style=\"background:\" |\n! style=\"background:\" |\n! style=\"background:\" |\n! style=\"background:\" |\n! style=\"background:\" |\n! style=\"background:\" |\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Seoul\n|856\n|753\n|199\n|18\n|29\n|0\n|482\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Busan\n|324\n|277\n|66\n|3\n|5\n|0\n|153\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Gyeonggi\n|670\n|713\n|221\n|8\n|16\n|0\n|252\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Gangwon\n|299\n|293\n|82\n|12\n|3\n|0\n|206\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |North Chungcheong\n|256\n|270\n|74\n|18\n|5\n|1\n|105\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |South Chungcheong\n|465\n|428\n|121\n|34\n|9\n|0\n|173\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |North Jeolla\n|407\n|387\n|95\n|5\n|19\n|0\n|220\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |South Jeolla\n|606\n|516\n|118\n|29\n|6\n|0\n|386\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |North Gyeongsang\n|755\n|664\n|88\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|626\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |South Gyeongsang\n|587\n|578\n|97\n|9\n|9\n|0\n|322\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Jeju\n|53\n|49\n|4\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|26\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n!align=\"left\" |Total\n!5,278\n!4,928\n!1,165\n!137\n!101\n!1\n!2,951\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| colspan=\"8\" align=\"left\" |Source: [http://dl.nanet.go.kr/SearchDetailView.do?cn=MONO1199222637_1 Central Administration Committee]\n|}\nElectoral College election\nAccording to official figures, 78.1% of registered voters voted, and gave Chun's DJP a supermajority of 3,667 seats in the electoral college, 69.5 percent of the total.

Of the 5,277 electors who were elected on 11 February and had not been removed from office (one member was removed in Busan), this meant 2,639 votes were needed to win. Sitting president Chun Doo-hwan was re-elected by a landslide on 25 February with 4,755 votes, 90.11% of the total possible.

The inauguration ceremony took place on 3 March. This marked the official beginning of the Fifth Republic of Korea, a dictatorial regime that lasted until democratization in 1988.\nNotes\nReferences"
