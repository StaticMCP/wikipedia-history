Led by coach Edward L. Jackson, the Hornets compiled a 7–1 record, just two seasons after posting a 1–7 record. They shut out their first four opponents, only allowing Lincoln, St. Paul's, and St. Augustine's to score any points. They maintained a perfect record until the final game of the season, losing 6–12 vs. St. Augustine's. The team had 40 members, a fifth of the entire 1954 enrollment at DSU.\nSchedule\n| site_stadium =\n| site_cityst = Cheyney, PA\n| score = 25–0\n| attend =\n| source =\n| nonconf = y\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium =\n| site_cityst = Norfolk, VA\n| score = 7–0\n| attend =\n| source =\n| nonconf = y\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium =\n| site_cityst = Dover, DE\n| score = 6–0\n| attend =\n| source =\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium =\n| site_cityst = Dover, DE\n| score = 13–0\n| attend =\n| source =\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium =\n| site_cityst = Oxford, PA\n| score = 18–13\n| attend =\n| source =\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium =\n| site_cityst = Dover, DE\n| score = 26–6\n| attend =\n| source =\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium =\n| site_cityst = Dover, DE\n| score = 13–0\n| attend =\n| source =\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium =\n| site_cityst = Raleigh, NC\n| score = 6–12\n| attend =\n| source =\n}}\n}}\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*"
