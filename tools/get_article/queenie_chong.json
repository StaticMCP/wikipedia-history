She is the CEO and co-founder of the online legacy planner Memori. She was also chosen as the inaugural Bruneian recipient of the Edmund Hillary Fellowship (EHF).\nEarly life and education\nQueenie completed her undergraduate studies in economics at Monash University in Melbourne, and her master's degree in education at the University of Brunei Darussalam (UBD). She was a former government scholarship holder from Brunei and graduated with honours from the UBD's executive program in business.

In 2018, she enrolled in the YSEALI Professional Fellowship in Seattle, US, and the YSEALI Impact eXL regional workshop in Indonesia. She was the first Bruneian to be chosen as an EHF in 2020.\nBusiness career\nQueenie taught economics at Tutong Sixth Form Centre before starting her company, and she left the Ministry of Education (MoE) in 2018 because she thought that business was essential to boosting the nation's economy and generating jobs.

She is on the board of the ASEAN Young Women Entrepreneurs Club, the vice president of the Young Entrepreneur Association of Brunei, and a member of her community's Village Committee. She was among the participants of the National Environment Conference, representing Beach Bunch in 2014.\nMemori/Mirath\nMembers of an Asian royal family have contributed to Memori's second seed round of funding as it prepares for its August 2019 soft launch. Memori, without an internet platform yet, raised B$158,000 (US$100,000) from 113 Venture Growth Fund. The company wants to develop into a one-stop shop for online legacy management, offering convenient ways to get memorial services, insurance, and wills. She lost her grandparents, which gave her the inspiration for the company.\nQueenie won the Excellent Youth Award 2021 with her legacy planning business Memori, which has received two six-figure investment rounds and other local and regional honours. In 2021, she was known to be based in Singapore for a company incubation program. Memori then introduced another online platform, Mirath, which offers similarly reasonably priced will and donation planning services, to serve the Islamic market.\nThe supply of wasiat (will), hibah (gift/grant), and faraid (Islamic inheritance) in addition to the janazah or contribution kit for mosques—which has subsequently collected over B$10,000 for over 40 less fortunate families—are among Mirath's principal items. Both platforms are aimed at the Southeast Asian market, where the majority of people do not have wills in place and end-of-life planning is still considered taboo.\nUnikLearn\nEver since the launch of the UnikLearn program in June 2018, more companies have shown interest in hiring UnikLearn trainees as interns, including young people with autism. Queenie highlighted that for businesses to remain competitive and keep producing high-quality jobs for residents, industries must reorganise and business models must change. According to her, the problem is not a lack of jobs but rather a mismatch in skills. According to her, \"our challenge is to ensure that no Bruneians with autism are [offered] fair job opportunity, especially those that are willing to learn and acquire skills that are necessary to meet the changing needs of their current industry.\"\nPolitical career\nHer position as a committed advocate was further cemented when Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah named her as a member of the LegCo on 20 January 2023.

He said that to begin to construct the necessary facilities for a method of payment that will enable online and international payments while guaranteeing dependable connection and cybersecurity, the MoFE is working with regional banks. In response to Queenie's question regarding the decrease in cash transactions, the minister clarified that the centralised payment hub will combine current and upcoming payment methods, boosting the usefulness of digital wallets such as Pocket, BIBD QuickPay, and DST Pay and enabling consumers and companies to make online payments even in the absence of a bank account.\nThe MoE is going to keep trying to educate students for international competitiveness through a variety of programs in higher learning, Minister Romaizah pledged on 13 March 2024.

ABCi received 7,380 applications in 2023, which were handled in a first-come, first-served manner.
