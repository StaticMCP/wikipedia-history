      "text": "# United States presidential straw polls in Puerto Rico\n\nDespite Puerto Rico's status as an unincorporated territory, which precludes its participation in U.S. presidential general elections and the ability to appoint electors to the U.S. Electoral College, Puerto Ricans are recognized as U.S. citizens and are permitted to engage in the U.S. presidential primaries. The enactment of Act No. 58 in 2020 by the pro-statehood New Progressive Party enables voters in Puerto Rico to participate in a non-binding presidential straw poll during the general election, marking a significant milestone in the territory's electoral history. Notably, Puerto Rico becomes the second U.S. territory to implement straw polls for presidential elections, following Guam, which initiated its own straw poll in 1980 and has conducted preference votes in conjunction with each presidential election since that time.\nResults\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"width:70em\"\n|+ Key for parties\n|-\n|\n|Democratic Party  (D)|outline=#000000}}\n|Republican Party  (R)|outline=#000000}}\nNoteA double dagger () indicates the national winner.\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Election results\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" |Year\n! colspan=\"4\" scope=\"col\" style=\"border-left:3px solid darkgray;\" |Winner\n! colspan=\"4\" scope=\"col\" style=\"border-left:3px solid darkgray;\" |Runner-up\n! colspan=\"4\" scope=\"col\" style=\"border-left:3px solid darkgray;\" |Other candidate\n! rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" scope=\"col\" |\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" style=\"border-left:3px solid darkgray;\" |Candidate\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" scope=\"col\" |Votes\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" scope=\"col\" |%\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" style=\"border-left:3px solid darkgray;\" |Candidate\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" scope=\"col\" |Votes\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" scope=\"col\" |%\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" style=\"border-left:3px solid darkgray;\" |Candidate\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" scope=\"col\" |Votes\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" scope=\"col\" |%\n|-\n| 2024\n| style=\"text-align:left; border-left:3px solid darkgray; background-color:;\" |\n|\n|724,947\n|\n| style=\"text-align:left; border-left:3px solid darkgray; background-color:;\" |\n|\n|263,270\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"border-left:3px solid darkgray;\" | Blank ballots\n| 123,127\n|\n|\n|}\nNotes\nReferences"
