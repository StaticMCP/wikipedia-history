She is the current head of the Department of the History of Art at Trinity College Dublin, where she became a fellow in 2022. and a former president of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland.\nMoss has written extensively on Insular art, including on its iconography, materials, methods and political and cultural settings. Her work includes detailed examinations of Irish round towers, high crosses, psalters, Celtic broochs, chalicees and house-shaped and other reliquary shrines, with a close focus on illuminated manuscripts such as the Book of Durrow (c. 700 AD), the Stowe Missal (after 792 AD), and Book of Mulling (late 8th or early 9th century).\nCareer\nMoss has said that her interest in the medieval came from her grandfather, an archaeologist living in County Sligo, who took her on digs when she was a child. She remembered \"vividly when I was six and he took me to see a dig. One of the archaeologists put a human jawbone in my hand and told me about how you could tell she was a young woman. Awarded her doctorate in 2009, a post-graduate, she worked on literacy projects in the then deprived Fatima Mansions area of Dublin.\nIn 2011, she became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and in 2013 she was elected president of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland. She is the current Head of the Department of the History of Art at Trinity College Dublin.\nShe edited the 2014 survey \"Medieval c. 400—c. 1600: Art and Architecture of Ireland\", published by Yale University Press as part of their five-volume Art and architecture of Ireland series. Her book was described by the Royal Irish Academy as \"an unrivalled account of all aspects of the rich and varied visual culture of Ireland in the Middle Ages. Based on decades of original research, the book contains over three hundred lively and informative essays.\" Writing for History Ireland, Peter Harbison said that Moss' book \"covers a much greater span of time than all the others, and also deals with a much wider range of material. The major attractions are the famous manuscripts and metalwork from the earlier period, but there is a lot more besides—including the recently discovered Faddan More Psalter of c. 800. Stonework is covered extensively from the earlier medieval period: high crosses, round towers and all the church buildings from [the] Gallarus Oratory to Cormac's Chapel.\"\nMoss lives in Dublin and Sligo with her husband Jason Ellis, a sculptor.\nSelected publications\nBooks (author)\n*\"The Book of Durrow\".
