In the , Anstead had a population of 1,522 people.\nGeography\nAnstead is located  by road south-west of the Brisbane CBD.\nThe suburb is bounded to the west by the northern bank of Dalys Reach () of the Brisbane River. The Moggill Conservation Park occupies the north of the suburb. Historically a rural area, it is now predominantly rural residential with small areas of land in the west of the suburb being either undeveloped or used for grazing on native vegetation.\nMount Crosby Road runs through from west to east.\nHistory\nAnstead is named after the original land owner John Anstead, a timber getter and quarry master in the 1860s. Anstead was officially gazetted in 1975, prior to which it was part of the suburb of Moggill.\nDemographics\nIn the , Anstead had a population of 1,509 people, 50.5% female and 49.5% male. The median age of the Anstead population was 41 years, 3 years above the national median of 38. 72.3% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 8.5%. 90.1% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 34.4%, Catholic 19.5%, Anglican 16.3% and Uniting Church 8.8%.\nIn the , Anstead had a population of 1,522 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Anstead. The nearest government primary school is Moggill State School in neighbouring Moggill to the south. The nearest government secondary school is Kenmore State High School in Kenmore to the north-east.\nFuture road proposal\nAn alternative location for a bridge to replace Moggill Ferry is proposed within the Moggill Pocket Arterial Road Transport Corridor. Land has been set aside by the Queensland government as a future transport corridor passing through the suburbs of Kenmore, Pullenvale, Anstead and Karalee to connect the Centenary Highway at Fig Tree Pocket, Queensland with the Warrego Highway at North Tivoli. The corridor was identified in the 1960s and planned and preserved in the late 1970s. It has not been determined whether or not local traffic on and off-ramp access to the arterial road will be provided. Community feelings over the transport corridor are similar to those expressed over the Moggill Ferry/Bridge debate. As of 2010, there is no date or funding provided to commence the construction of the Moggill Pocket Arterial Road Transport Corridor.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n* [https://onesearch.slq.qld.gov.au/permalink/61SLQ_INST/dls06p/alma99183475620102061 Moggill Historical Society Inc.
