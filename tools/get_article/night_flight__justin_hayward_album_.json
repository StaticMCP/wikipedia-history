It was reissued on CD in September 1989.\nThe album came about as a result of Hayward's involvement in Jeff Wayne's musical adaptation of War of the Worlds.  Wayne produced and arranged the album, which proved to be one of the lengthiest recording experiences of Hayward's career.  The music was mostly pop and dance oriented, and most of the tracks were romantic love songs.\nThe title track was the last to be recorded for the album.\nIn April 2004, the album was remastered and released on CD with two extra tracks.\nTrack listing\nSide One\n#\"Night Flight\" (Jeff Wayne, Paul Vigrass) - 5:24\n#\"Maybe It's Just Love\" (Mike Silver) - 4:49\n#\"Crazy Lovers\" (Justin Hayward) - 5:31\n#\"Penumbra Moon\" (Billy Nicholls) - 4:12\n#\"Nearer to You\" (Justin Hayward) - 3:42\nSide Two\n#\"A Face in the Crowd\" (Justin Hayward) - 4:01\n#\"Suitcase\" (Justin Hayward) - 3:37\n#\"I'm Sorry\" (Daryl Hall, John Oates, copyright 1972) - 3:11\n#\"It's Not On\" (Jeff Wayne, Gary Osborne) - 4:10\n#\"Bedtime Stories\" (Colin Still) - 5:45\n2004 Expanded Edition Tracks (UK)\n\"Bedtimes Stories (single version)\" (Colin Still) - 4:09\n\"Forever Autumn (Live)\" (Wayne, Virgrass, Osborne) - 4:26\nPersonnel\n*Justin Hayward - vocals and guitars; bass and drums on \"Suitcase\"\n*Jeff Wayne - production, arrangements, conducting; piano on \"Night Flight\"\n*Jo Partridge - guitars\n*Ken Freeman - keyboards\n*Herbie Flowers - bass\n*Barry de Souza - drums\n*Stuart Elliott - drums\n*Roy Jones - percussion\n*Tony Carr - percussion\n*Doreen Chanter - female vocals on \"Bedtime Stories\" and \"Nearer To You\"\n*Irene Chanter - female vocals on \"Bedtime Stories\" and \"Nearer To You\"\n*Dave Holland - drums on \"Crazy Lovers\"\nBrass arrangements by Jeff Wayne and Steve Gray.
