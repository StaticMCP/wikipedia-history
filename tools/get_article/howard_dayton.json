After graduating from the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University in 1967, he served two and a half years as a naval officer. In 1969, Howard developed The Caboose, a railroad-themed restaurant, in Orlando. In 1972, he began his commercial real estate development career, specializing in office development in central Florida.\nIn 1970, Dayton began to meet with a group of businessmen, who introduced him to Jesus Christ as his savior. Three years later his business partner challenged him to study the Scriptures to discover what God teaches about handling money. They discovered that the Bible contained 2,350 verses dealing with money and possessions, and Dayton's life profoundly changed. God gave him a passion to share the principles he discovered, leading him to write eight books and six small-group studies, which have been translated into dozens of languages.\nDayton founded Crown Ministries in 1985 and developed a small-group financial study. Dayton worked, without salary, as CEO of Crown. Crown Ministries merged with Larry Burkett's Christian Financial Concepts in September 2000 to form Crown Financial Ministries, the world's largest financial ministry at that time. During Dayton's tenure as CEO, the ministry taught Bible-based principles of handling money and operating a business to more than 50 million people in 88 countries. Dayton was named among the Top 20 CEOs of Christian Organizations, and the ministry was recognized as one of the “Best Christian Workplaces”.\nDayton worked unsalaried as Crown's CEO until 2007, when he transitioned from that role. In 2008, he received an honorary doctorate from Asbury University.\nIn 2009, Dayton founded a new ministry, Compass - finances God's way, working as the CEO in a full-time volunteer capacity. The vision of Compass is to teach people worldwide how to handle money and operate businesses God's way.\nOn March 28, 2014, Asbury University dedicated the Dayton School of Business.\nDayton has two adult children and four grandchildren and resides in Orlando, Florida.\nRadio\nUpon Larry Burkett's death in 2003, Dayton followed Burkett as the host of Money Matters, a 20-year radio program with co-host Steve Moore, featuring call-in questions from listeners. The broadcast peaked in 2007, carried on 2,000 stations and outlets, with a weekly audience of about 2 million.\nIn 2011, Dayton joined Steve Moore again to start a new nationally syndicated call-in radio program, MoneyWise. It aired on 850 Christian radio stations and outlets, with an estimated weekly listening audience of 875,000. Howard selected Rob West as his successor host in 2017, and the broadcast was acquired by Kingdom Advisors, where West ias president.\nDayton also hosted HeyHoward, a one-minute feature carried on approximately 1,100 stations and outlets.\nGlobal Compass\nCompass has regional directors in North America, South America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Africa, and India, and had expanded into 80 countries as of 2018.\nPublications\nBooks\n*Your Money: Frustration or Freedom (Tyndale House Publishers)\n*Your Money Counts (Tyndale House Publishers)\n*Free and Clear (Moody Publishers)\n*Your Money Map (Moody Publishers)\n*''Money and Marriage God's Way (Moody Publishers)\n*Business God's Way (Compass)\n*ABCs of Handling Money God’s Way (Moody Publishers—for children ages 4–7) co-authored with Beverly Dayton\n*The Secret (Moody Publishers—for children 8-12) co-authored with Beverly Dayton\nAudio Books\n*Your Money Counts (Compass – read by author)\n*Business God's way (Compass – read by author)\n*Money and Marriage God's Way (Oasis Audio – read by author)\n*Your Money Map (Oasis Audio – read by author)\nBibles\n*Financial Stewardship Bible (in collaboration with American Bible Society)\nStudies\n*Navigating Your Finances God’s Way – small-group study\n*Money and Marriage God’s Way – small-group study\n*Business God’s Way – small-group study\n*Set Your House in Order – small-group study\n*Charting Your Legacy – small-group study (for \"those entrusted with much\")\n*Give, Save & Spend – for-credit college course developed in collaboration with Dan Lewis and Kyle Hasbrouck\nDVD Series\n*Navigating Your Finances God's Way\n*Business God's Way''\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.compass1.org/ Compass - Finances God's Way]\n*[http://www.moodypublishers.com/ Moody Publishers]"
