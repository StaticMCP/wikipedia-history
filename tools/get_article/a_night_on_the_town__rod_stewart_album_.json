The cover art is based on Pierre-Auguste Renoir's painting Bal du moulin de la Galette, with Stewart inserted in the centre in period costume. On 30 June 2009, Rhino reissued the album as a two-disc CD with bonus tracks. A Night on the Town was Stewart's last UK number-one studio album until Time in 2013.\nThe album is regarded as one of Stewart's finest. \"The Killing of Georgie\" is one of Stewart's most hard-hitting sets of lyrics, a melancholic tale of a gay friend who is cast out by his family and becomes a sensation in the New York nightlife, only to be murdered by a New Jersey gang during an attempted robbery. Controversial \"Tonight's the Night\" was a No. 1 hit but was banned by some radio stations due to the very obvious lyrics about sex and loss of virginity. A cover of Cat Stevens' \"The First Cut Is the Deepest\" was also a success and has since become one of Stewart's signature songs.\nTrack listing\nOriginal release\n2009 re-release\nPersonnel\n* Rod Stewart – vocals\n* Donald \"Duck\" Dunn, Bob Glaub, David Hood, Lee Sklar, Willie Weeks – bass guitar\n* Pete Carr, Steve Cropper, Jesse Ed Davis, David Lindley, Billy Peek, Fred Tackett, Joe Walsh – guitar\n* Barry Beckett, David Foster, John Barlow Jarvis, J.
