The movie was a co-production between Italy (where it was released as La legione dei dannati), West Germany (where is known with the title Die zum Teufel gehen) and Spain (where it is known as La brigada de los condenados).\nPlot\nIn June 1944, the Allies initiate the liberation of Europe by landing in Normandy. The Germans have fortified the French coasts to resist the landing, but the exact location and day are unknown to them. Colonel Henderson, an English officer, is given a mission to form a commando unit and reach the French coasts near Le Havre, east of Normandy, to mislead the Germans about the landing location.\nColonel Ackerman, who had previously defeated Henderson's unit in North Africa, commands the German troops in that area. Upon reaching the beach, the commandos detonate underwater mines, neutralize bunkers, and face additional German forces, forcing them to retreat inland. Despite losing several members during pursuits, they successfully destroyed a massive rail-mounted cannon.\nCast\n* Jack Palance: Col. Charley MacPherson\n* Curd Jürgens: Maj.
