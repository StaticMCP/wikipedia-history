In the , the locality of Linville had a population of 133 people.\nHistory\nOn 19 August 1841, the Balfour brothers - John, Charles and Robert, took up Colinton run which included the present site of the town of Linville. The Balfours originally intended to build their homestead where Linville now stands but decided to establish it instead about  to the south, near where Emu Creek enters the Brisbane River.\nDuring their occupancy of Colinton the Balfours built stockyards on the north bank of Greenhide Creek near its junction with the Brisbane River. The yards became known as \"Nine Mile Yards\". By about 1886 a small private township grew up at the spot and the Nine Mile Receiving Office opened there in 1898. The name was used up till 1901.\nSurveyor E.M. Waraker laid out a town at Nine Mile and the plans of sections 2 to 7 of the town, to be known as Linton, were lodged with the Survey office on 6 December 1901. Linton was situated about  south east of where Linville now stands. Local residents wanted the name Linton, which was formed by dropping the syllable \"Co\" from \"Colinton\". The postal authorities did not favour this as there was already a place in Victoria called Linton,  west-south-west of Ballarat. A compromise was reached and at the request of residents the name of the receiving office was changed to Linville in November 1905; it became a post office in January 1910.\nIn 1910, the Brisbane Valley railway line was extended from Toogoolawah to Linville with Linville railway station () serving the town. The railway line closed in 1989.\nThe railway link allowed the timber industry to develop, with a sawmill opening in 1912 and logging continuing to be an important industry until the 1950s when cattle grazing become the predominant local industry. In 1920 some of the land was allocated to returning soldiers, some of whom setup dairy farms.\nColinton Provisional School opened on 11 November 1901. In April 1905, it was renamed Oakey Provisional School. In September 1906, it was renamed Linville Provisional School. It became Linville State School in 1909.\nSt George's Anglican Church was dedicated on Monday 19 April 1915 by Archbishop St Clair Donaldson. It was at 52 David Street (). It was sold on 1 June 2020 for $134,200. It was converted into a private residence.\nOn 1 August 1922, the chairman of the Esk Shire Council, Mr A. Smith, unveiled the Linville War Memorial in George Street; it commemorates those from the district who served in World War I.\nOn Sunday 1 October 1927, the Linville Methodist Church was opened and dedicated by local minister Reverend Thomas Burgess.
