Manning Haynes and starring Stewart Rome, Betty Carter and Ian Fleming. The film was shot by British First National at the Twickenham Studios in London with sets designed by the art director Hugh Gee. The rights for the film were acquired by the parent American company First National Pictures for copyright and distribution of the film in the United States. This explains why the film at this late date was completely silent as by this time First National was routinely supplying Synchronized musical soundtracks to its feature films. It was an adaptation of the play The Ware Case by George Pleydell Bancroft, previously filmed in 1917, with another version appearing in 1938. First National (through Warner Bros.) distributed the film in the United States.\nSynopsis\nSir Hubert Ware (Stewart Rome) is the very picture of a dashing English country gentleman: athletic, charming, and popular in high society. But beneath his polished exterior lies a cold, self-serving man who lives far beyond his means. Perpetually in debt, Sir Hubert hides his moral indifference behind good manners and social graces. Among his few genuine acts of kindness is his continued financial help to Tommy Bold (Syd Ellery), an aging racing tout who has fallen on hard times.\nResiding at the grand Ware estate is Lady Magda Ware (Betty Carter), Hubert's wife, and her younger brother Eustace Ede (Patrick Ludlow), a wealthy and somewhat impressionable young man who has inherited the entirety of their father's fortune. Tensions rise between brother and sister, and following a bitter quarrel during a weekend house party, Eustace storms off to the lake for a swim.\nAmong the assembled guests is Sir Michael Adye (Ian Fleming), a celebrated barrister who harbors deep and unspoken affection for Lady Ware. Before long, the gardener bursts in with terrible news: Eustace has been found drowned.\nLady Ware discovers a cryptic note from her brother and, wracked with guilt, assumes he has taken his own life. But the coroner's inquest delivers a shocking twist—bruise marks have been found on Eustace's throat, indicating foul play. A verdict of murder by person or persons unknown is returned.\nPublic speculation is rampant. Some insist it was a tragic accident; others, suspecting financial motive, turn their eyes to Lady Ware. But chief among the skeptics is Inspector Watkins (Cameron Carr), who quietly builds a case against Sir Hubert. Suspicion becomes indictment. Weeks later, Sir Hubert Ware is arrested and formally charged with the murder of Eustace Ede.\nDespite her emotional turmoil, Lady Ware pleads with Sir Michael Adye to defend her husband. Bound by honor and lingering affection, Sir Michael reluctantly agrees, and the trial commences at the Old Bailey.\nThe prosecution delivers a strong case, and it appears all hope is lost for the defendant. Then, in a dramatic turn, Tommy Bold—just released from prison—arrives at the courtroom seeking Sir Michael. Bold's testimony, based on details that suggest Eustace's death was likely accidental, undermines the prosecution's timeline. The jury, swayed by doubt, returns a verdict of Not Guilty.\nThe household returns home, but the tension lingers. Sir Hubert, intoxicated and elated by his narrow escape, begins to unravel. In a drunken haze, he boasts that he did in fact murder Eustace—provoked by financial desperation and personal hatred. Lady Ware and Sir Michael, stunned, realize the court has freed a guilty man.\nOutside, a crowd gathers to cheer the triumphant baronet. Sir Hubert climbs to the rooftop parapet to soak in their acclaim. As he listens to their applause, he sways... and plunges from the rooftop to his death.\nIn the aftermath, Sir Michael Adye stands by Lady Magda's side. Though grief-stricken, she finds solace in his quiet strength. It is gently implied that in time, the bond between them may evolve into a new beginning.\nCast\n* Stewart Rome as Sir Hubert Ware\n* Betty Carter as Lady Magda Ware\n* Ian Fleming as Michael Adye\n* Cameron Carr as Inspector Watkins\n* Cynthia Murtagh as Celia Gurney\n* Patrick Ludlow as Eustace Ede\n* Wellington Briggs as Sir Henry Egerton\n* Patrick Stewart as Marston Gurney\n* Syd Ellery as Tommy Bold\n* John Valentine as Attorney General\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Low, Rachael.
