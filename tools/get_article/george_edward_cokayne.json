Mary Anne Cokayne, a daughter of Viscount Cullen. He was baptised George Edward Adams. On 15 August 1873, he changed his surname by Royal Licence to Cokayne (such changes were frequently made to meet the terms of bequests from childless relatives, often in the maternal line, who wished to see their name and arms continue).\nCareer\nEducation\nHe matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford on 6 June 1844, and graduated BA in 1848 and MA in 1852.

In 1882 he was promoted to Norroy King of Arms, which office he held  until his appointment as Clarenceux King of Arms in 1894, which he held until his death in 1911.\nThe Complete Peerage\nCokayne wrote The Complete Peerage, the first edition of which was published between 1887 and 1898\nMarriage and progeny\nOn 2 December 1856, he married Mary Dorothea Gibbs, daughter of George Henry Gibbs by his wife Caroline Crawley.
