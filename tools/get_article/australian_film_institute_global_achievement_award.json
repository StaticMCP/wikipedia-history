The award was presented from 2001-2004 before it was split into two categories for International Best Actor and International Best Actress, but it was handed out again in 2007.\nWinners\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"25%\" | Recipient(s)\n! width=\"25%\" | Notes\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2001(43rd)\n| Russell Crowe\n|\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2002(44th)\n| Mel Gibson\n|\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2003(45th)\n| Geoffrey Rush\n|\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2004(46th)\n| Naomi Watts\n|\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2007(49th)\n| George Miller\n| For Happy Feet\n|}\nSee also\n*Australian Film Institute International Award for Best Actor\n*Australian Film Institute International Award for Best Actress\n*AACTA Awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.aacta.org The Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts Official website]"
