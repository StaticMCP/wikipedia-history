The song – sung by Dick Powell and Alice Faye – debuted on film February 12, 1937, in the musical, On the Avenue''.\nBackground\nThe Noble, Norvo, and film renditions were successful that year, as well as the other 1937 recordings that included Billie Holiday and Glen Gray (vocal by Kenny Sargent).\nLes Brown's instrumental version, arranged by Skip Martin and recorded in 1946 as Columbia #38324, became a million-seller and Billboard top ten song in 1949.  Brown said that he got a call from Columbia Records after he performed the song telling him to record it, only to respond that he had recorded it three years earlier. That same year, vocal group The Mills Brothers also had a chart hit with their version on Decca #24550.\nOther recordings\nAlthough not strictly a Christmas song, since the lyrics make no mention of the holiday, it has been recorded for many artists' Christmas albums and is a standard part of the holiday song repertoire in the U.S. Artists such as Rosemary Clooney, Doris Day, Dean Martin, Bette Midler, Frank Sinatra, Rod Stewart, Pentatonix (in a virtual duet with Sinatra), Dinah Washington and Idina Menzel (in a duet with Billy Porter) are among those who have covered it.  Ella Fitzgerald recorded this for her 1958 Verve release Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Irving Berlin Songbook.\nDuring the Big Band era, the song was also recorded by several leading \"sweet jazz bands\" including Shep Fields and his Rippling Rhythm Orchestra in 1937.\nBibliography\nAnnotations\nNotes\nReferences\n*  |date=1938 |title=Catalog of Copyright Entries |url=https://archive.org/details/catalogofcopyrig323libr/page/n5/mode/2up |series=Part 3 – \"Musical Compositions\" – New Series |volume=32, No. 1 |publisher=Library of Congress, Copyright Office |via=Internet Archive  }}\n}} }}\n*  |last1=Gilliland |first1=John Sanford Jr. (1935–1998) |author-link1=John Gilliland |date=197X |chapter=1940s, Program #22 |title=Pop Chronicles |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1633221/m1/#track/4 |publisher=University of North Texas Libraries |type=4 audo cassetts |series=See Pop Chronicles |access-date=February 15, 2021 |via=UNT Digital Library (all tracks)  }} ; .\n*  |author1=Dick Powell (vocalist) |author-link1=Dick Powell |author2=Alice Faye (vocalist) |author-link2=Alice Faye |date=February 12, 1937 |chapter=I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm |chapter-url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8bFz6En8yY |title=On The Avenue |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8bFz6En8yY |type=film |publisher=20th Century Fox Film Corporation |via=YouTube }} ()\n*  |last1=Rust |first1=Brian Arthur Lovell (1922–2011) |author-link1=Brian Rust |date=1975 |title=The American Dance Band Discography, 1917–1942 |url= |publisher=Arlington House Publishers |via=Google Books (University of Michigan Library)  }} ; ; .\n|volume=2 |page=1311}}\n|volume=2 |page=1314}}\n|volume=2 |page=1544}}\n|volume=2 |page=1994}}\n*  |last1=Rust |first1=Brian Arthur Lovell (1922–2011) |author-link1=Brian Rust |editor-last1=Debus |editor-first1=Allen George (1926–2009) |editor-link1=Allen G.
