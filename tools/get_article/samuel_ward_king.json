He was born in Johnston, Rhode Island to William Borden King and Welthian Walton King.\nKing attended Brown University but did not graduate. He became a medical doctor and worked as a surgeon during the War of 1812.\nIn 1820, King was elected town clerk of Johnston. He became a Whig when the party was founded, and was a presidential elector in 1832. In 1838, he was elected to the Rhode Island Senate. He first became governor in 1839 when the legislature failed to grant a majority of votes to the three leading contenders. He was elected to three other terms.\nDuring his administration as governor, he took a strong stand against the expanded voting franchise that led to the Dorr Rebellion in 1841 – 1842. President John Tyler refused to send in Federal troops at Governor King's request to suppress the uprising.\nKing married Catherine Latham Angell, with whom he had 14 children. He is buried in the King family plot in Johnston near the intersection of US Route 6A and Killingly Street.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/king8.html Political Graveyard biographical information.]\n* [https://classic.nga.org/cms/home/governors/past-governors-bios/page_rhode_island/col2-content/main-content-list/title_king_samuel.default.html National Governors Association Biography]\n*"
