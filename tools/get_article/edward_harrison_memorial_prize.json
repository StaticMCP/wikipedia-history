It  commemorated the work of Edward Harrison who was credited with producing the first serviceable gas mask and whose work saved many lives.\nIn 2008 the prize was joined with the Meldola Medal and Prize to form the Harrison-Meldola Memorial Prizes.\nWinners\nWinners include\n* For 2009 onwards, see Harrison-Meldola Memorial Prizes\n*  |event= Katherine Holt}}\n*  |event= Saif A.
