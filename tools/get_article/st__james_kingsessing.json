It is one of the churches created by settlers and descendants of the Delaware Valley colony of New Sweden, a colony planted by the Swedish South Company that existed  from 1638 and 1655, when it was conquered by the Dutch. St. James, built in 1762, is a sister congregation to the old Swedish church of Gloria Dei in the Southwark neighborhood of Philadelphia.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* [https://archive.org/stream/oldswedeschurcho00phil#page/n9 The Old Swede's Church of St. James Kingsessing, 1762], printed 1911\n*[https://www.generalconvention.org/explore-parochial-report-trends Explore Parochial Report Trends]"
