The battle was fought over disputed lands. It ended in defeat of the Clan Campbell of Lochawe. The battle was on the borders of Loch Awe and Lorne, with the site and battle named Red Ford (Scottish Gaelic: Ath Dearg) after the ford which ran red with blood where the battle took place.\nBackground\nClan MacDougall allied itself with John Balliol, a competitor for the Scottish crown. After his coronation in 1292, the clan's chief, Alasdair MacDubhgaill, was rewarded by being appointed Sheriff of Argyll in 1293. Clan MacDougall were then able to extend their influence, which led to disputes with other clans like Clan Campbell and Clan Donald. Cailean Mor or \"Great Colin/Colin the Great\", the 4th Chief of Clan Campbell, signed a Ragman Role Oath of Fealty pledging allegiance to King Edward I of England with other nobles on August 27, 1296, and died in the Battle of the Red Ford on the String of Lorne in Netherlorn, Argyll, which took place some time afterwards.\nBattle\nAlthough no exact details of the battle are at hand, a great many people died on both sides and the ford ran red with blood of the fallen and the wounded. Cailean Mór Caimbeul (Sir Colin Campbell) was killed in battle.\nAftermath\nAfter the battle, Sir Colin Campbell's body was carried to the church of St. Peter the Deacon at Kilchrenan and buried there.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*"
