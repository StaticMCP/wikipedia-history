      "text": "# List of Dinosaur King characters\n\n}}\nThis is a list of characters that appear in Dinosaur King.\nThe English versions of the series use names differing from the Japanese versions; in this article the English names are used.\nHumans\nD-Team\nThe D-Team are the protagonists of the series who are very knowledgeable about dinosaurs. They prevent the Alpha Gang from succeeding in their goal by saving the dinosaurs they can find.\n;\n:\n::Max Taylor is the son of a paleontologist Dr. Spike Taylor. He is the unofficial leader of D-Team. Max is mostly seen wearing a visor that has Triceratops horns which double as flashlights. He is brash, impulsive and does not generally think his actions through. Max deeply cares for dinosaurs and hates how the Alpha Gang abuses them. His partner is a Triceratops called Chomp, which he named because he chomps away on anything he can get his mouth on. Besides having Chomp, Max owns some most of the lightning and water wild dinosaurs that they claim.\n;\n:True name: Rex Ancient (used in the 4Kids English dub only)\n:\n::Max's best friend, Rex was found as an infant by paleontologist Dr. Owen in an egg-like container within a dinosaur exhibit in New York. Rex is now 11 and has been left with Max and his family while his father goes searching for fossils with Dr. Owen being a family friend of the Taylor family. It is revealed in one episode that Rex was left at Max's house because his father wanted him to be near a real family. Rex's partner is a Carnotaurus he named Ace. Rex also owns most of the fire and wind dinosaurs. Rex is a good-hearted boy and is relatively quiet, but also quite short-tempered from the beginning. At the end of the first series, it is revealed that Rex's real parents are Dr. Ancient and Dr. Cretacia and he reunites with them. In the finale, Rex, the Alpha Gang, Seth, Chomp, Ace, Paris and the Ancients return to the year 2126.\n;\n:\n::The younger sister of Dr. Reese Drake whose sunglasses double as a camera. Zoe knows when to keep focused and cares deeply for her friends. Zoe sometimes shows to be excessively fond of some stars. She owns a Parasaurolophus called Paris and also most of the grass dinosaurs. Zoe's parents are both veterinarians and own an animal hospital. In the dub of episode \"Vaccination Vacation\", the Drake's home as well as the family was transported onto Zeta Point.\n;\n:\n::Dr. Spike Taylor is Max's father and a paleontologist. Like Max, Spike is obsessed with dinosaurs and runs the D-Lab. He wields a whip that often gets caught on things which are generally things he is not aiming for. Dr. Taylor can also be over-reactive when a dinosaur appears. He also saves the D-Team when they are cornered by the Alpha Gang, catches the new cards, and reclaims the lost Dino Holders from Seth. His name is a pun on \"Spike Tail\" (a nickname for Stegosaurus). In the \"Mesozoic Meltdown\" episodes, the Taylors, the Ancients, and the Drakes get captured by Spectral Space Pirates.\n;\n:\n::A scientist who is Zoe's older sister, Dr. Spike Taylor's assistant, a certified pilot, and the creator of the D-Team's Dino Holders. She maintains a calm personality at all times when around others and has a rather monotonic voice even when angry or embarrassed. Zander has feelings for Reese which she may or may not return given that she couldn't recognize Zander without her glasses. Reese stays at the D-Lab in the Mesozoic Meltdown with Rod and Laura and is later taken hostage by Seth and his Cryolophosaurus.\nAlpha Gang\nThe Alpha Gang are the primary antagonists of the first series who abduct any dinosaur cards they find using their own dinosaurs as their muscle. They conduct experiments on the dinosaur cards they find. The Alpha Gang's headquarters is the mobile island called Zeta Point which was later revealed to be a disguised timeship called the Backlander. They later renounce their evil ways in the finale of the first season when Seth turns on them and later help the D-Team in their fight with the Spectral Space Pirates. Among its members are:\n;\n:\n::The zany, egotistic, and incompetent mad scientist who is the leader of the Alpha Gang and the grandfather of Laura and Rod. Dr. Z plans to use the dinosaur cards in his plans to rule the world. He also seems to know the history of these cards, though he was not the creator as the method was created by Dr. Ancient and Dr. Cretacia. Dr. Z did invent the Move Cards that Dr. Ancient had been dissatisfied with. When Dr. Ancient and Dr. Cretacia wanted to return to the year 2126 to raise baby Rex, Dr. Z and Seth jettisoned their pods into the timestream and tried to do the same for baby Rex only for the intervention of Jonathan to prevent that. This accident caused the Alpha Gang to end up in the present day and the dinosaur cards were scattered throughout the Earth. Dr. Z often sends Ursula, Zander and Ed to obtain dinosaur cards (which were scattered when his time machine exploded) for him while he stays in his lab on Zeta Point researching and experimenting with the dinosaur cards that he already has, unless it is a certain occasion. When Ursula, Zander, and Ed fail, he always berates them for their incompetence and punishes them in different ways. Dr. Z sometimes attempts to aid them with some of his inventions, but his inventions often explode as a running gag. Dr. Z has accompanied Ursula, Zander, and Ed when it came to missions that involved Dr. Z reclaiming his Secret Dinosaurs which he worked on. When he had a bad back from holding up Alpha Metal, he didn't like Seth's idea of having his grandchildren obtaining the Dinosaur Cards. In the battle against the Spectral Space Pirates, Dr. Z invented the Dino-Tectors so that the dinosaurs of the D-Team and the Alpha Gang can armor up.\n;\n:\n::A member of the Alpha Gang, Ursula works with Zander and Ed to obtain dinosaur cards for Dr. Z. She is often conceited, acting like a queen in front of her two cohorts and possessing an elevated, almost delusional, opinion of her beauty. Whenever failure occurs with the three, Ursula thinks that it is not her own fault (even when it is), but blames the other two who keep bringing her down. A running gag is that she is often called an \"old lady\" (usually by Zoe, \"Obasan\" in Japanese, meaning grandma or grandmother) which drives her crazy, and she always knows when somebody calls her that no matter how far away they are. Dr. Owen later develops a crush on her which she doesn't return. In the second series, Ursula was being asked to marry Dr. Owen in the final episode, but she rejected him in return.\n;\n:\n::The tall sunglasses-wearing member of the Alpha Gang, Zander works with Ursula and Ed to obtain dinosaur cards for Dr. Z. He is usually the one who comes up with a plan that always goes horribly wrong. Zander is also the person who buys the Alpha Gang's vehicles and has to deal with the consequences when they are destroyed or lost. He tries to act smart and sophisticated, but is nervous, awkward, and cowardly most of the time. In episode 30, he develops a crush on Reese.\n;\n:\n::The short fat member of the Alpha Gang, Ed works with Ursula and Zander to obtain dinosaur cards for Dr. Z. Despite his cowardly behavior, he follows the other two anywhere even if they end up in a dangerous predicament. Ed likes cute girls and enjoys eating bananas though he is something of a glutton and is fond of eating in general. Ed is the funny one on the team and is rather stupid. His only sign of intelligence is in \"The Forest Fire Effect\" when he shows them what kind of damage would be done by the fire the fight against the Spectral Space Pirates caused in the Jurassic Period (which resulted in sentient plants and giant insects). In the video game however, he is the complete opposite of how he is in the show. Ed also had a running gag in the first series on jinxing his team during missions. He doesn't have an official partner, but Ed prefers to use \"Tank\" a lot.\n; and\n:Rod\n:Laura\n::Rod and Laura Dr. Z's grandchildren. Rod is gifted with science and often helps his grandfather with his inventions. Laura is a genius with numbers and makes money playing in the stock market to fund the Alpha Gang's activities. Despite the pair being considerably more intelligent than Ursula, Zander and Ed, they generally just stay at the base and rarely come up with any plans. Seth later appoints them to obtain the dinosaurs for him when both of them feel homesick. Around the time when Seth turns against Dr. Z, Laura and Rod find out about what Dr. Z and Seth did with Dr. Ancient and Dr. Cretacia during the trip back to their own time. In the second series, they stay with Reece while the rest of the gang travel through time, although later on they rejoin the gang when a plant invasion occurs. Unlike other members of the Alpha Gang, Rod and Laura seem to get along with Max and the others by the second series.\n;\n:\n::Seth is a mystical human with knowledge about the dinosaurs and the cards as he was the former assistant of Dr. Ancient. He is manipulative, calm and cunning, but Seth's goals were to actually alter time with the altered dinosaurs he created to negate the dinosaurs' extinction. To achieve that, Seth allies himself with Dr. Z, playing on the man's agenda and even helping him in jettisoning Dr. Ancient and Cretia's pods into the timestream. Being the most intelligent member of the Alpha Gang, Seth is often annoyed by the antics of Ursula, Zander, and Ed with whom he denies association. He is often seen assisting some of the Alpha Droids in repairing Dr. Z's time machine and even giving him a status report. At the time when Dr. Z was recuperating from a bad back, Seth had Laura and Rod obtain the dinosaur cards for his own agenda. When Jonathan manages to expose his plot, Seth finally turns on his comrades by using the Fire Scorcher move on Saurophaganax causing the D-Team and the Alpha Gang to retreat. He then caused the Alpha Gang to retreat as he turns a complete Tyrannosaurus fossil into the Black Tyrannosaurus to hold them and the D-Team at bay while he attempts to go back to the past. However, as Black Tyrannosaurus was defeated by the combined powers of the D-Team and the Alpha Gang with Max and Chomp attempting to stop him on their own, the time ship's systems overloaded with Seth sucked into the timestream as a result. He was later rescued by the Spectral Space Pirates and ally with them under the alias of . When working for the Spectral Space Pirates, Seth created Gigas, Maximus, and Armatus (presumably from the fossils that he had based their dinosaur forms off of in the same way he created the Black Tyrannosaurus). Seth later sets up a trick to sneak into the D-Team's time ship and get the Cosmos Stones. He eventually attacks the Spectral Space Pirates with his Cryolophosaurus after this. After a battle with the D-Team, he manages to get the Cosmos Stones before Jark reclaims them and forms the Black Pterosaur. Seth ended up unconscious after ramming the Backlander into the Black Pterosaur. His comatose body was taken back to the future with Rex and the Alpha Gang.\n;\n:\n::Helga serves as a strict and short-tempered housekeeper of the Alpha Gang. Sometimes she seems too large and too strong to be a human. It is later revealed that she is actually a robot created by Dr. Z when the D-Team encounter her again in Cambodia and even protects Laura and Rod from the Stegosaurus. When in Chinatown to reclaim Laura and Rod, Seth ends up deactivating Helga causing Zeta Point to end up a mess without her. She was retrieved when her body ended up in Hollywood, but with bad programming. When Seth turns on the Alpha Gang, Helga holds off the Saurophaganax enough for Dr. Z, Ursula, Zander, Ed, and Rod to escape. She was later repaired by Jonathan and later ends up accompanying the D-Team and the Alpha Gang in fighting the Spectral Space Pirates. Helga was the one who discovered that the Gel-Jarks have a weakness to salt.\n;Alpha Droids\n:\n::Obedient robots that work for the Alpha Gang which are so poorly programmed that they fail at everything they do. The most common model of Alpha Droid is the Actroid which can curl up into balls for easy transportation. In \"Field of Screams\", it is shown that the Alpha Droids can become dizzy as seen when they end up bunched up into one soccer ball. They make more appearances in the original series, but are seen occasionally in the Pterosaur Legends (especially during the Caribbean and at the finale). The Nintendo DS video game introduces the Kakutoroid model Alpha Droid. They are muscular, strong and red in color as they are strong enough to throw dinosaurs around. They are usually tougher to beat than the Actroids.\nSpectral Space Pirates\nThe  are the antagonists of the second series. They are a group of space pirates composed by the strange aliens with retractable wings who use dinosaur cards they have somehow obtained to aid in their search for the arcane \"Cosmos Stones\", using a mind-control device to control the dinosaurs. Each one has their own Dino-Card Activator. Its members are:\n;:\n:\n::The leader and captain of the Spectral Space Pirates, he uses dinosaurs to collect the Cosmos Stone. Spectre is the one who supplies his henchmen with the dinosaur cards, Move Cards, and Spectral Armor Cards. Spectre is often seen with a small Apatosaurus named Brontykins in his arm. He is a horrible singer.\n;\n:\n::Gavro is a large and strong red-skinned simple-minded alien. His Dino-Card Activator is on his chest armor and his altered dinosaur was Gigas the Tyrannosaurus.\n;\n:\n::Foolscap is a slender alien who ponders agility. His Dino-Card Activator is on his headband and his altered dinosaur was Armatus the Stegosaurus.\n;:\n:\n::Sheer has a beautiful semblance, but a ruthless heart. Her Dino-Card Activator is on her necklace and her altered dinosaur was Maximus the Triceratops. During the Ancient Japan arc, Sheer had amnesia and joined the kunoichi.\n;Seth\n::See Alpha Gang\n;\n::Goma is an arcade-only character. He was first a member of the Spectral Space Pirates, but is now the leader of the Shadow Kingdom. He appears after he finds the defeated Space Pirates. After discovering what had happened to his father (Spectre) and his three minions, he decides to challenge the D-Team himself. He owns an Eocarcharia, which he has altered. It is the most powerful Shadow Empire dinosaur, possessing Shadow Fire. It can be upgraded into Super Eocarcharia. This dinosaur has an Element Booster design based on Goma's outfit.\n;Gel Jarks\n::Obedient gel-based robots that work for the Space Pirates. They can easily transform, but they dissolve upon contact with salt. Helga was the first to discover their weakness at the time when they attacked her in the Backlander's kitchen. As of the finale, only one Gel Jark remains and is taking care of the unconscious Seth.\nSupporting characters\n;\n:\n::Aki Taylor is Max's mother and Dr. Taylor's wife. A sketchbook artist and housewife, not much is known about Aki except that she believes (or pretends to believe) that the dinosaurs are dogs since Dr. Taylor opted to keep his wife in the dark about the truth for the time being. She often embarrasses Max with talks about when he was a baby and called him by his full name Maximus during one of these. Aki's appearances are generally brief. During the second series, she finds out what the dinosaurs really are.\n;Dr. Owen\n:\n::Dr. Owen is a paleontologist who is Dr. Taylor's colleague and Rex's adoptive father. He discovers Rex as a baby in The American Museum of Natural History and adopts him. Dr. Owen sends Rex to live with the Taylor family to give him a more \"normal\" family environment and also seeks a woman to marry so that he can give his adoptive son a mother. He develops a crush on Ursula. In the second season, he also stays in the present with Reece, Laura, and Rod. At the end of Pterosaur Legends, he once again asks Ursula to marry him, but she replies with a \"no\".\n;Patrick\n:\n::Patrick is Dr. Owen's assistant and appears since episode 30. He often travels with Dr. Owen wherever he goes and has experience in lassoing.\n;\n:\n::Jonathan is a mysterious old man with conspicuous beard. He appears all over the world, in various guises (including a pilot, a street merchant, a Balinese tour guide, a famous chef, and a train conductor) usually right where dinosaurs are found. Jonathan is eventually revealed to be a robot who can change his appearance by rotating his head upside down when it came to his conductor duty. He had data that had Dr. Ancient's data which ended up extracted by Seth. Jonathan manages to save the D-Team from a deflected attack from Terry during his fight with the Ampelosaurus. The D-Team had his body shipped to the D-Lab and Reece was able to reactivate him. Jonathan makes his way to Zeta Point and by the time the D-Team arrived with Rod, Jonathan managed to expose Seth's plot. Following Seth's Saurophaganax defeating the dinosaurs of the D-Team and the Alpha Gang, Jonathan managed to rescue Rex. Near the end of the first series, Jonathan revealed himself to be Dr. Ancient's butler who was charged with protecting Rex and even brought up the history of what the Alpha Gang did. He reappears in the second season as the pilot of the Backlander.\n;Mr. and Mrs. Drake\n:Mr. Drake\n:Mrs. Drake\n::They are Zoe's parents and they run a veterinarian clinic. They, along with Mr. and Mrs. Ancient and Mr. and Mrs. Taylor, are abducted by the Spectral Space Pirates in the second season.\n;Dr. Ancient and Dr. Cretacia\n:Dr. Ancient\n:Dr. Cretacia\n::Dr. Ancient and Dr. Cretacia are scientists who are Rex's real parents. They were the ones who have discovered a way to turn dinosaurs into cards. Dr. Ancient was displeased that Dr. Z created Move Cards for them. When Dr. Cretacia became pregnant, they wanted to return, but Dr. Z and Seth had other plans. They ended up jettisoning Dr. Ancient and Dr. Cretacia's pods into the timestream and tried to do the same to baby Rex. They were somehow recovered as they were in the pod room following Black Tyrannosaurus' defeat. Dr. Ancient and Dr. Cretacia were reunited with their son. In the second season, they alongside the Taylors and the Drakes were captured by Zanjark so that the Ancients can help them with their experiment.\n;Juan\n;\n;Juan was the seventh member of the D-team in Dinosaur King X, first appearing in episode 15, he owns the secret dinosaurs from the original series.\nIn episode 20 of Dinosaur King R, he ultimately succumbs to deletion by a ai android soldier at point blank, reducing his dinosaurs to be passed on to Rain in later episodes and in Gold and Silver.\nMinor characters\n;Tommy K\n:\n::The host of the \"Gobble Gobble Brain Bobble\" quiz show.

She was an old friend of Spike Taylor as both of them had a hobby at lassoing. When Max, Rex, and Zoe arrive in Kenya, they end up running into the rangers led by Mary who suspects that they are associated with the poacher Ungaro. A transmission from Spike ends up revealing to the D-Team that he knows Mary. Following the transmission, Mary agrees to help the D-Team find the Torosaurus while stopping Ungaro. When the D-Team's dinosaurs were able to defeat the Alpha Gang, Mary manages to lasso Ungaro. Afterwards, she and her fellow rangers managed to free\n;Ungaro\n:\n::Ungaro is a notorious poacher. He and his gang have been poaching animals in the Kenya Reserve and have been evading the Wildlife Protection Team. Ungaro had an encounter with Ursula, Zandar, and Ed who helped them out at the time when they were looking for the Torosaurus. During the Alpha Gang's fight with the D-Team and the Torosaurus, Mary managed to lasso Ungaro who surrendered. When Paris evoked a stampede that chased after Ursula, Zander, and Ed, Ungaro got trampled and quoted \"Mom was right! I should've became a plumber!\"\n;Meena\n:\n::Meena is an Indian princess who befriends and swims alongside the Deltadromeus.\nAppearing in different time periods\nThe following characters are encountered by the D-Team and the Alpha Gang during their time-travel mission:\n;Sophia / Sylvia\n:\n::A girl who the D-Team befriends in Ancient Rome.

He sent his army to Trachia to attack anyone who resists him. Some of its civilians were captured and sold as slaves. Spartacus was one of them since he tried to get the slaves to stand up to him. He even planned to eliminate Spartacus by either having him fight lions or the entire Roman Army. Sulla does managed to get Ursula, Zander, and Ed to have Spiny fight Spartacus (who had received the Cosmo Stone to power up his sword) until Sheer comes into view.

He thinks chanting is the answer to all of life's problems. Whether this really works is unknown. Zanjark abducted him from his village in a plot to get to that time period's Cosmos Stone. The D-Team think Genzo might have had something to do with Tank breaking the rock. Dr. Z and Ursula pretend to be him a couple of times with disastrous results ranging from tapping into a lava tunnel running beneath a poor village in the midst of its drought to getting attacked by Gavro.\n;Ieyasu Tokugawa\n:\n::A shōgun that the D-Team encounter in the Edo period. He was separated from his escort group when Sheer and a bunch of kunoichis attacked.

With his fellow orphans, they form the Teen Musketeers and join up with the D-Team and Lady Constance to catch up to Princess Anne.\n;Cardinal Richelieu\n:\n::The cardinal to Queen Marie de' Medici who aides the Spectral Space Pirates in finding the next Cosmos Stone (which was believed by some to be the Eye of Gaia).\nPterosaur\n:\n::The Pterosaur is a mysterious female phoenix-like entity that guided the D-Team and the Alpha Gang through time in Mesozoic Meltdown. She is rather large, her body (not including the wings and tail) able to become slightly larger than the Backlander, though is normally seen a bit smaller than that. She seems to somewhat resemble a large, glowing version of the anime's Microraptor.\n::She was first encountered in the cliffhanger of the season's first episode. Throughout the series, the Pterosaur is mostly seen during transitions between the arcs, guiding the D-Team into the different time periods while the Backlander's time circuits are down, following the Spectral Space Pirates so they can try to claim the 7 Cosmos Stones first. She also warns them about the danger of fusing the Cosmos Stones together. After attempting to stop the D-Team from bringing all Cosmos Stones to the same time period while they tried saving the D-Lab from Seth, she last appeared protecting the Backlander from the Space Pirates' dinosaurs' attacks and then cloaking it in light to ram and defeat the Dark Pterosaur.\n::Although it isn't stated, the Pterosaur may come from the fusing of the 7 Element Stones, as these stones and the Pterosaur herself are \"positive\" opposites of the \"negative\" Cosmos Stones and Dark Pterosaur, and both feature the same rainbow glow.\nDark Pterosaur\n::The Dark Pterosaur is the nemesis of the Light Pterosaur. The two are physically identical except for the opposite light/dark colors and the fact that the Dark Pterosaur can expand its outer shell to be as large as an entire city, while still having its \"main\" self as a separate entity inside.It is an powerful and dark phoenix-like entity formed when Spectre fused all seven Cosmos Stones together in the penultimate episode of Dinosaur King. Its main goal is to wipe out the entire universe and consume space-time itself. The Dark Pterosaur also empowered the Space Pirates’ main dinosaurs, granting them invincible forms. Ultimately, it was defeated by Seth, who, with the help of the seven Element Stones and the Pterosaur, destroyed the Dark Pterosaur by colliding with it using the Backlander, preventing the destruction of the universe.It was created when all 7 Cosmos Stones were fused together by Spectre at the end of the season's penultimate episode, and has the ability to rip time and space apart. It charged up the Space Pirates' main dinosaurs and gave the Pirates themselves incorporeal forms of allegedly ultimate power. The Dark Pterosaur was destroyed by Seth, who, with the help of the 7 Element Stones and the Pterosaur, rammed into it with the Backlander and destroyed it, the Element Stones' and Cosmos Stones' opposite positive/negative \"charges\" canceling each other out.\nDinosaurs\nThis is a list of dinosaurs that appear in the dinosaur king anime franchise in order of appearance:\n* Triceratops\nName:  / Chomp\nElement: Lightning\nFirst Seen in Episode: (1-)\nFirst Activation: Max rubbed a rock that had a lightning bolt on it.\nFound in place: In a forest not too far from Max's house\nMoves Used: Electric Charge (Lightning).

Rex sometimes has a hard time controlling him in his hatchling form (possibly because he's the only D-Team's main dinosaur who's a predator, while Chomp and Paris are herbivores). Ace has shown that he can combine his cyclone with water and create a water typhoon. Ace seems to know Acrocanthosaurus. His transformation is the hatchling spinning, his legs grow in, and so do some spikes along his tail and back, his horns grow, his eyes shine and he roars. He is the fastest and most agile of the D-teams main dinosaurs and has shown that he can grab a dinosaur by the tail, then throw them without use of a move card.

Unlike all the other dinosaurs the Alpha Gang kidnapped, Ceratosaurus' mind was not altered to be violent and aggressive and it never worked for the Alpha Gang since they never used it. After Rex saved Ceratosaurus, he used it to defeat and claim Styracosaurus before they got off Zeta Point. It is the only non-move dinosaur so far to be activated and used by the D-Team apart from their original three Dino-Partners.

It recognized Dr. Z when he tried to reclaim it, but attacked him in confusion and later again after he and Ursula set Terry and Spiny on him. For some reason, it was drawn to the light of the sun. The experiment made it so powerful that it easily defeated Terry and Chomp with Dynamic Ray, but it used up its energy on a second Dynamic Ray trying to clear away the clouds and so reverted to its card form. It worked with Dr. Z in the battle against Seth's Black Tyrannosaurus, though it still didn't like Dr. Z trying to ride on its back.\n* Acrocanthosaurus\nName: Acro\nElement: Fire\nFirst Seen in Episode: (15-)\nFirst Activation: The egg that its card was in was opened in a hot spring on a fisherman's campfire.\nFound in place: Somewhere in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (specifically on one of the islands near Devon Island).\nOwned by: Zander (Alpha Gang), later Rex (D-Team)\nOther Info: It first appeared at a volcano and was defeated by Terry.

They later managed to get it and Chomp into a game of soccer, using a giant ball made of Alpha Droids, but when they Alpha Gang tried to set the droids on them, it turned out that getting kicked around made them too dizzy to capture them, though they managed to recover later and held down Ace from the fight against Terry. Altirhinus hates the Super Impact move because it makes it feel dizzy (the genus name \"Altirhinus\" is mispronounced in the 4kids dub).\n* Daspletosaurus\nName: Daigo (Dainason)\nElement: Fire\nFirst Seen in Episode: (18-)\nFirst Activated: Some sparks of fire flew over its card and landed on the card and Move Card.\nFound in place: During a festival at a hotel in Bali, Indonesia.\nMove Used: Fire Bomb (Fire)\nOwned by: Max and Rex(D-Team)\nOther Info: He enjoys dancing to music.

Chomp helped him escape the noise in Paris so he could calm down (in the original version, Chomp lured the Anchiceratops away from the noise by farting). Like Maiasaura, the D-Team didn't have to defeat him to save him since he returned to a card from passing out after battling Spiny. Anchiceratops possesses Death Grind in which he also farts at Spiny, but this was cut from the 4Kids dub. When Ursula told Dr. Z a lie about a dinosaur in Paris, France, Dr. Z believed her, but called later for a scream at them and then Anchiceratops' card activated.\n* Futabasaurus\nName: Futaba\nElement: Water Super Move Card Dinosaur\nFirst Seen in Episode: (25-)\nFirst Activated: Ursula first activated it to fend off the D-Team.\nFound in place: In the mines of Japan\nOwned by: Ursula (Alpha Gang) & Zoe (D-Team)\nOther Info: Its card is an Assist Move Card with a Futaba Super Cannon ability.

It is also attracted to the light of the sun. Unlike the Pachycephalosaurus, it seemed to recognize Dr. Z as its \"father\" but still turned on him due to his abusive treatment of it (e.g. hit its arm with a hammer when it was hungry, beating it with a rug beater when it wet the bed and making it run with tires strapped to it in an attempt to make it a violent dinosaur) when it was young making it never have a proper childhood, though it saves Dr. Z's life when the two fall off a building.
