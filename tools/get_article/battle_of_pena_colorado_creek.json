The exact location of the battlefield is unknown but it was near the Peña Colorado Creek.\nBackground\nBefore the battle, Mescalero Apaches under the lead of Chief Nicolas attacked the ranch of Manuel Musquiz, killing three herders and stealing some livestock. In response, Lieutenant Reuben Mays took 13 cavalrymen and a Mexican guide by the name of Juan Fernandez from Fort Davis to search for the Apache raiders. At the end of the day on August 10, 1861, the troops discovered the camp of Chief Nicolas’ band in a valley with intent on striking by the next morning.\nThe Battle\nOn the morning of the 11th of August, 1861, Lt. Mays and his cavalrymen began an assault on the camp, however he quickly realized that he was severely outnumbered, with Chief Nicolas’ band having more than 80 warriors. Mays and his men were being chased by the Apaches for a while, and were forced to take cover behind a large rock. Juan Fernandez went to go to Fort Davis to get help, however it would already be too late as Mays and his men would all be killed, in the middle of the west Texas desert.\nReferences"
