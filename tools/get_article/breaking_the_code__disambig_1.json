The play thematically links Turing's cryptographic activities with his attempts to grapple with his homosexuality.\nIt was adapted into a 1996 television film directed by Herbert Wise, with Derek Jacobi reprising his stage role as Turing.\nCharacters\n* Alan Turing\n* Mick Ross, detective\n* Christopher Morcom, Turing's childhood friend (1911&ndash;1930)\n* Sara Turing, Turing's mother (1881&ndash;1976)\n* Ron Miller, a young man having an affair with Turing (based on Arnold Murray)\n* Dillwyn Knox, manager at Bletchley Park recruiting Turing for government service\n* Patricia \"Pat\" Green, a co-worker of Turing's at Bletchley (based on Joan Clarke; 1917&ndash;1996)\nPerformance history\nFollowing an eight-month run at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket in London's West End beginning on 21 October 1986, the play ran on Broadway in New York City from 15 November 1987, to 10 April 1988, in both cases starring Derek Jacobi.
