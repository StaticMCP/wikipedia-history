His work in chronology was admired by Michael Mästlin, among others, and his work in mathematics contributed to the early formulation of logarithms by Joost Bürgi and John Napier. He was also associated with Tycho Brahe, Johannes Praetorius, and Helisaeus Roeslin.\nHerwart often lent Kepler books that might otherwise have been unavailable to him, and used his influence to help Kepler retain academic appointments despite his Protestantism, as Herwart himself was \"an ardent Catholic and a friend of the Jesuits.\" His extant correspondence with Kepler covers a period from 1597 to 1611 and includes more than 90 letters. The correspondence was discovered by C. Anschütz at Munich, and was first published in 1886. A sample exchange, on an astronomical passage from the Neronian poet Lucan, is available [http://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~wstevens/keplerlucan/allenglish.html online] in English translation.\nHerwart published a multiplication table in a folio volume of more than a thousand pages, Tabulae arithmeticae προσθαφαιρἐσεως universales, (Munich, 1610).\nHerwart also authored his Thesaurus Hieroglyphicorum which was a paper museum containing illustrations of all the objects he could find that were relevant to his interest in Egyptian antiquities.\nFurther reading\n* Caspar, Max.
