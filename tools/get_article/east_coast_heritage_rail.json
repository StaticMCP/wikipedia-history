The company operated heritage train tours from 1986 until 2017, with operations recommencing in February 2019 under the new brand, East Coast Heritage Rail. The headquarters is in Alexandria, New South Wales, Australia.\nEstablishment\n]]\nThe setting up of an organisation to manage and operate locomotive 3801 was first formalised in March 1984, the State Rail Authority exchanged correspondence. At first, four parties were involved. The State Rail Authority had two roles, the first as donor of the locomotive and other equipment and the second as a trustee. In effect, 3801 would continue to be the property of the State Rail Authority and it would be leased to the trust. Three other organisations were nominated as trustees; the Powerhouse Museum, the Australian Railway Historical Society (New South Wales Division) and the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum.\nAt that time, the restoration of locomotive 3801 was nearing completion at the former State Dockyard site in Newcastle. Out of trade apprentices worked on this restoration for over a three-year period under the direction of the [http://www.hvtc.com.au/ Hunter Valley Training Company]. One of the first assignments undertaken by the company was to raise funds to pay for the restoration and other expenses. Its stated aim was \"to exhibit with pride and enthusiasm to the people of NSW the masterful preservation of a piece of their Locomotive History ... as a living, mobile, historical work\". During the restoration, the company organised regular tours of inspection at the State Dockyard.\n3801 enters service\nhauls the Bicentennial Train through Wodonga, Victoria in October 1988]]\nIn November 1986, 3801 returned to service and operated as the flagship of 3801 Limited for the next 20 years.\nIn 1988, 3801 and its train became the Bicentennial Train and operated tours to all the mainland capitals as part of the nation's 200-year celebrations. In the latter part of 1988 and much of 1989, Flying Scotsman joined 3801 Limited and ran many very successful tours around New South Wales and beyond. In excess of 500,000 passengers were carried by the company during this 20-year period.\n3801 departs\nAt the conclusion of the 20-year lease covering the operation of locomotive 3801, the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum decided not to offer a renewal with 3801 departing in November 2006.\nWorkshop\nTo provide an operational base for 3801 Limited, the State Rail Authority granted a licence to occupy the Large Erecting Shop at Eveleigh Railway Workshops. 3801 Limited's use of the Large Erecting Shop was terminated in early 2017 after 30 years. In late 2018 the company relocated some of its fleet to a private siding in the Hunter Valley with ready access to the main line. They are also working on other stabling sites to support their operations and to relocate the remaining non-operational vehicles from the Large Erecting Shop.\nThe Cockatoo Run\n, affectionly known as \"Bob\", departs Moss Vale with the Cockatoo Run in September 1997]]\nAs a result of the NSW Department of Transport seeking expressions of interest to take over the weekends only passenger service on the Unanderra to Moss Vale line as a tourist operation, 3801 Limited commenced the Cockatoo Run heritage tourist train on 19 August 1995. Initially the train operated from a base established in the Port Kembla Locomotive Depot Complex. Steam locomotive SMR18 was leased by 3801 Limited from the Hunter Valley Training Company for the service. To enable the locomotive to haul a train from Port Kembla to Moss Vale and return with one load of coal, the coal bunker was modified. Financial difficulties led to the suspension of the Cockatoo Run from November 1998 until March 1999, after which date the train ran between Port Kembla and Robertson only. Furthermore, it was diesel hauled and ran for nine months of the year.\n3801 Limited vacated the Port Kembla Depot on 30 March 2001 and all rolling stock and equipment was relocated to Eveleigh. The Cockatoo Run was merged with another of the company's operations, the Long Lunch Train, from 4 March 2001 and this service operated from Sydney via Wollongong, Robertson, and Moss Vale on selected Thursdays and Sundays with heritage diesel locomotives until early 2017. It has on occasions operated with steam locomotives from the Lachlan Valley Railway and Powerhouse Museum. The service now runs on selected Sundays, with 42101 as its flagship locomotive.\nCurrent and former locomotive fleet\nin June 2006]]\n421 class\nThe 421 class are a class of diesel locomotives built by Clyde Engineering, Granville for the Department of Railways New South Wales in 1965/66.

X54 was the last of the Series 3 X classes and went through a number of different owners including V/Line, Freight Australia, QR National and Aurizon where it was then placed into storage in Rothbury, NSW. East Coast Heritage Rail then bought the locomotive off Aurizon and ran its first heritage tour in late 2022. It initially wore the QR National livery, with logos painted over and the No. 1 end painted in an approximation of the VicRail teacup scheme. In 2024, it was painted in full VicRail teacup.\nReferences"
