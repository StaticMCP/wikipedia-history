WWU has been an official member of NCAA Division II since September 1998. Their mascot is Victor E. Viking.\nWestern Washington sponsors six sports for men and nine sports for women with approximately 350 student athletes.\nMascot\nThe story of Victor E. Viking, the mascot, is that he visited Bellingham in 1923 and decided to become a supporter of the team. He has since become the mascot representation of the Vikings. In 2015, The Washington Post reported on controversy at Western over the mascot. Some claim that an imposing white man does not sufficiently represent the school, while some argue against removing the mascot that had been representing Western for nearly 100 years. The controversy was renewed in 2022, but Victor continues as the mascot of the institution .\nStudent athletes\nThe 2010 NCAA graduation rate study showed that 69 percent of Western student-athletes receive their degrees in six years or less based on the Federal Graduation Rate formula, a rate the same as that of the full student body. This is 13 percentage points higher than the average for NCAA Division II schools nationally and 15 points higher than the average for the nine U.S. schools in the Great Northwest Athletic Conference. Using the NCAA Academic Success Rate, which includes all freshman student-athletes from the fall of 2003 and also accounts for student-athletes who transfer into or out of the institution, Western posted an 85 percent success rate, compared to the NCAA II national number of 73 percent. The average ASR of the nine U.S. GNAC schools was 77 percent.\nSports sponsored\nVarsity teams\n{| class=\"wikitable\"; style= \"text-align: \"\n! width= 150px style=\"\"| Men's sports\n! width= 150px style=\"\"| Women's sports\n|-\n| Basketball || Basketball\n|-\n| Cross country || Cross country\n|-\n| Golf ||  Golf\n|-\n| Soccer || Rowing\n|-\n| Track and field || Soccer\n|-\n| || Softball\n|-\n| || Volleyball\n|}\nBasketball\nWWU won the 2011–12 NCAA Division II men's basketball national championship, just the second collegiate crown in that sport in state of Washington history and the first since 1976. WWU reached the national semifinals in men's basketball in 2001 and women's basketball in 2000. WWU ranks among the top 15 in women's basketball victories among all four-year schools with that program making 12 NCAA tournament appearances in 13 years.\nFormer varsity teams\nBaseball, field hockey, football, men's rowing, men's swimming, men's tennis, women's tennis, wrestling\nClubs teams\n*Baseball\n*Men's Crew\n*Climbing\n*Cycling\n*Equestrian\n*Fencing\n*Figure Skating\n*Ice Hockey\n*Judo\n*Men's Lacrosse\n*Women's Lacrosse\n*Men's Rugby\n*Women's Rugby\n*Sailing\n*Swimming\n*Tennis\n*Men's Ultimate\n*Women's Ultimate\n*Men's Volleyball\n*Women's Volleyball\n*Men's Water Polo\n*Women's Water Polo\n*Water Skiing\n*Wakeboarding\n*Wrestling\nNational championships\nWestern Washington University is credited with 13 official team National Championship. 1 at the NAIA level and 12 NCAA Championships.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n|NAIA\n| Division 1\n|Softball\n| 1998\n|Simon Fraser\n|5–1\n|- align = \"center\"\n|rowspan=\"12\"| NCAA\n|rowspan=\"12\"| Division II\n|rowspan=\"7\"| Women's Rowing\n| 2005\n| Mercyhurst\n| 20–12\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2006\n| Barry\n| 20–15\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2007\n| UC San Diego\n| 20–15\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2008\n| UC San Diego\n| 20–15\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2009\n| Mercyhurst\n| 18–13\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2010\n| Seattle Pacific\n| 20–11\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2011\n| Mercyhurst\n| 20–13\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Men's Basketball\n| 2012\n| Montevallo\n| 72–65\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Women's Soccer\n| 2016\n| Grand Valley State\n| 3–2\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Women's Rowing\n| 2017\n| Central Oklahoma\n| 17–16\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Women's Soccer\n| 2022\n| West Chester\n| 2-1\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Women's Rowing\n| 2024\n| Mercyhurst\n| 22-21\n|}\nAdditionally, Western's club sports have won the following championships:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- align =\"center\"\n| Road Cycling\n| Division II\n| 2007\n|- align = \"center\"\n| CycloCross\n| Division II\n| 2007\n|- align = \"center\"\n| CycloCross\n| Division II\n| 2009\n|- align = \"center\"\n| Men's Hockey\n| Division II\n| 2013\n|- align = \"center\"\n| Women's Handball\n| Division II\n| 2014\n|- align = \"center\"\n| Water Skiing\n| Division II\n| 2015\n|- align = \"center\"\n| Women's Baseball\n| Division I-III\n| 2024\n|}\nThe WWU Women's Baseball club was founded in the Fall of 2023 and won the club sports championship their inaugural year. As women's baseball is relatively new for club sports, there have only been six teams welcomed to the Women's College Club Baseball final. Those teams range from Division I to Division III.\nOther accomplishments\nIn 2010–11, WWU placed seventh among 310 NCAA Division II schools in the Sports Director's Cup national all-sports standings, the second-highest finish in school history. The Vikings were sixth in 2009–10 and 10th in 2008–09. WWU has had eight straight Top 50 finishes and been among the Top 100 in each of its first 13 seasons as an NCAA II member. In 2010–11, Western won its third straight and seventh overall Great Northwest Athletic Conference All-Sports championship, taking league titles in volleyball, men's golf and women's golf, and the regular-season crown in women's basketball. The Vikings, who won the Northwest Collegiate Rowing Conference championship, placed second in men's and women's cross country, men's and women's outdoor track, men's indoor track and softball.\nOther accomplishments include:\n* Seven straight Division II national titles in women's rowing from 2005 to 2011, the first NCAA school in any division to achieve that distinction.\n* Two National Collegiate Rowing Championship victories in 1984 and 1996, prior to the addition of women's rowing to the NCAA.\n* Second nationally in volleyball in 2007, and the fourth-longest league winning streak in NCAA II of 57 from 2002–04.\n* 38-game victory string in women's soccer from 1982–84.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
