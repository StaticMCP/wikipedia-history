Connewarre is a version of \"kunuwarra\", the name of the black swan in the Wathawurrung language. At the , Connewarre and the surrounding area had a population of 788.\nPart of the Eastern Precinct of the large Armstrong Creek Growth Area was within Connewarre when urban development began in 2010, but in 2012, when the new suburb Armstrong Creek was gazetted, Connewarre's boundary was adjusted to exclude the area north of Lower Duneed Road and the west of Baenschs Lane, meaning that all of the Growth Area then lay outside Connewarre.\nSettlements near Connewarre include Breamlea to the south, Torquay to the west and Barwon Heads to the east.\nHistory\nThe Post Office opened on 9 September 1860 and closed in 1967. An earlier Connewarre office was renamed Mount Duneed.\nThe former Connewarre Primary School has been closed and merged with Mount Duneed Primary School.\nGovernance\nThe Connewarre road district was proclaimed in 1856, and extended in 1859 to include the Mount Duneed, Torquay and Breamlea districts. In 1874, it was amalgamated with South Barwon Borough to create the Shire of South Barwon, which was proclaimed a city in 1974.\nIn May 1993, the City of South Barwon was amalgamated with the Shire of Barrabool, the Rural City of Bellarine, the Shire of Corio, the City of Geelong, the City of Geelong West, the City of Newtown, and part of the Shire of Bannockburn, to form the City of Greater Geelong. In March 1994, the southern-most part of Connewarre was included in the Surf Coast Shire, on its creation.\nReferences"
