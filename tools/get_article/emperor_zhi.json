His title di is usually translated into English as emperor but was shared by Shangdi, the \"high god\" of the earliest known Chinese writing. Much later Chinese historians like Sima Qian reported the surviving accounts that Zhi was a son of Emperor Ku, succeeding him for nine years roughly placed between 2366 and 2358BC.\nThe Annals of the Five Emperors in Sima's Records of the Grand Historian say that Zhi reigned badly but was succeeded by his younger half-brother Fang Xun, who as King Yao became proverbial for the wisdom and success of his rule.\nAccording to the Bamboo Annals written earlier but rediscovered later, a descendant of Shennong named Shu Qi attempted to rebel upon the death of the Emperor Zhuanxu. Gao Xin, the prince of Xin and descendant of the Yellow Emperor, defeated him and established himself as Emperor Ku. In the 45th year of Ku's reign, he named his son Prince Yao of Tang as his successor but, upon his death in the 63rd year of his reign, the older son Ku took the throne instead. The Bamboo Annals agree that Zhi ruled for nine years but states that he was then deposed and replaced by his brother Yao.\nSee also\n* Chinese mythology\nReferences"
