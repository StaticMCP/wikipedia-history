According to Erdeniyin Tobchi (17 century), ÖLÜ-T or YELÜ-T (-t for plural) was one of the leading familial lineages in the Oirat coalition.\nThe first documented reference to ÖLÜ-T (YELÜ-T) was Onginsk \"rune\" inscriptions dated in the 6th century.\nThe political elite in the Rouran and Tobgach empires were the YELÜ-T Mongolic speakers. Although these two empires encompassed multilingual populations, the language of diplomacy, trade, and culture was a ÖLÜ (YELÜ) dialect of ancient Mongolic descent.\nÖLÜ-T or YELÜ-T IN THE CASPIAN STEPPES, 6th - 8th century\nThe YELÜ-AVARS, originally hailing from Mongolia, established their formidable empire known as the Rouran Khanate (330-555 CE).\nHowever, in the midst of the sixth century, they faced destruction at the hands of the Turks, who pursued them as far as the Caucasus region.\nThis displacement triggered a series of events. Settling in the Caucasus around 558, the Mongolic Avars intervened in Germanic tribal conflicts, forming alliances such as with the Lombards to overthrow the Gepidae, who were Byzantine allies.\nBetween 550 and 575, they solidified their presence by establishing the Avar Khanate (6th to 8th century) in the Hungarian plain, situated between the Danube and Tisza rivers.\n|}\n13th century\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:6%\" | Year || style=\"width:10%\" | Date || Event\n|-\n| 1207 || || Jochi, Genghis Khan's oldest son, subjugates the 'forest peoples' - Oirat, Kyrgyz, and Buryat\n|-\n| 1207-1208 || || Quduqa Bäki, the leader of the Oirats, becomes a QUDA ally, or in-law familial lineage to Genghis Khan and his imperial lineage.\nGenghis Khan marries his daughter Checheyiken and Jochi's daughter Holuiqan to two Quduqa Bäki's sons\n|-\n| 1217-1336  || || Oirats were prominent in the Middle Eastern Il-Khanate, whose founder Hulegu married two Oirat women in succession\nTURKEY.

In 1296, this tümen moved to MAMLUK EGYPT when GHAZAN KHAN favored their local Turkmen rivals.\nBy 1336, Ali-Padshah, a member of the Oirat ruling family, was a contender for power in the disintegrating Il- Khanate.\nKHORASAN. Arghun Aqa, a famous Oirat bureaucrat, became governor of Khorasan (eastern Iran) and founder of a prominent Oirat family there.\n|-\n| 1260-1264 || || Oirats had strong QUDA ties to the families of Jochi’s sons Hordu and BATU.
