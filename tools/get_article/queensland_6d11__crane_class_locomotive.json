Per Queensland Railway's classification system they were designated the 6D11½ class, the 6 representing the number of driving wheels, the D that it was a tank locomotive, and the 11½ the cylinder diameter in inches. Their delivery was delayed after the ship Duke of Sutherland they were aboard ran aground off Lizard Island. Both had their cranes removed in 1911/12.\nClass list\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Number\n!Worksnumber\n!In service\n!Notes\n|-\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|4317\n|January 1903\n|Crane removed November 1911, written off April 1927\n|-\n|align=center|2\n|align=center|4318\n|January 1903\n|Crane removed, written off September 1927\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
