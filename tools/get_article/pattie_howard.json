Her mother, Sarah Howard Mayes played piano and was a member of several female gospel groups in her early years and her father, the late Rev. Frank Love also traveled as a gospel quartet singer. Pattie's brother, Michael Howard toured the world with Zola Taylor and The Platters, and her sister Sharlene Grahm-Hairston was well known in the gospel community for her rich contralto voice, singing with The Aaron Holbrook Singers and The James Wade Singers of Cleveland Ohio. Pattie recorded her first song at age 13 as a lead singer in the gospel group \"All God's Children\" along with her sister Sederia \"CD\" Graves and began singing professionally at age 17, traveling worldwide with various major artists. At the age of 19, Pattie formed her first band with the help of her sister and Manager Eva Brown called Pattie Love and Fun, in Los Angeles California. It was during this time that her writing and arrangement skills surfaced again, and her career as a solo artist began to emerge.  Her first solo recording was entitled \"Second Thoughts\". Many of Howard's earlier credits are listed as \"Francine Howard\" before she settled on the stage name of  \"Pattie Howard\".\nMusic career\nRCA records\nIn 1985, Pattie came to the attention of Lonnie Simmons, President of Total Experience/RCA Records, home of legendary artists The Gap Band, Yarborough and Peoples, and Penny Ford.  Mr. Simmons offered Pattie Howard a recording contract to produce and record her self-titled debut album- Pattie Howard, a collection of the first songs ever written and produced by Ms. Howard. \"Selfish\", was the first single released from Pattie Howard.\nLight records\nIn 1991, after catching the attention of then-president Ralph Carmichael, Howard was offered another major record deal. Howard released her second album, The Vision, on Light Records, which at the time was home to Andrae Crouch, Edwin Hawkins, Walter Hawkins and Kurt Carr. The album was co-produced by Grammy Award winning Gospel Legend Andrae Crouch and Keith Crouch who is known for his work with singer Brandy Norwood.\nTours and current events\nShortly after The Vision was released, Pattie was hired to tour the world with singer Whitney Houston on The Bodyguard World Tour.
