He conducted recordings of many of the works with which he was involved on stage. He also worked as a pianist and arranger.\nEarly life and career\nJohn Owen Edwards was born in Cartmel, England. He won a scholarship to study composition at Worcester College, Oxford, graduating in 1973, and soon began his career in musical theatre. He conducted for Ruth Welting at the 1975 Royal Variety Performance, and around the same time worked on the musical Billy at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. He collaborated with the musician Stephen Oliver several times, accompanying the premiere of A Man of Feeling at the King's Head Islington in 1980, and as pianist in Swansong for Seven Voices by Nigel Dennis on Radio 3 in 1985.\nAt the Chichester Festival Theatre, he was musical director for The Mitford Girls by Brahms, Sherrin and Greenwell in 1981, for Valmouth by Sandy Wilson in 1982 (later recorded), for the premiere of Goodbye Mr Chips by Starke and Bricusse in 1982, followed by a recording, music supervisor for Ian Judge's production of Sondheim's A Little Night Music in 1989, and musical director for Peter Hall's production of Born Again by Barry, Hall and Carr in 1990.\nIn 1984 he conducted ''The Ratepayers' Iolanthe'' (an updated version of Gilbert and Sullivan' Iolanthe involving contemporary politics) in London, followed by The Metropolitan Mikado, a similar pastiche of Gilbert and Sullivan, in 1985. He conducted the professional British stage premiere of Street Scene in April 1987, a performance in aid of London Lighthouse, where \"he guided the large cast ... through this complex score with calm authority\". He composed the music for Canary Blunt'', a musical with words by David Firth, which premiered at the Latchmere Theatre in 1985 and for which a recording was made by That's Entertainment Records (TER). He conducted the British stage premiere of Kurt Weill's 1936 musical Johnny Johnson for Not the RSC at the Almeida Theatre, London, in August 1986. He conducted operas for the Singers Company including La Périchole, broadcast on BBC2, The Barber of Seville and La bohème.\nHe conducted the 1989 CD set of Kismet, which included the first recordings of five numbers from the score of Timbuktu!. and the first complete recording of The Student Prince, with David Rendall, Norman Bailey, Diana Montague, Rosemary Ashe, Bonaventura Bottone, and Leon Greene. For the recording of Cabaret with Judi Dench and Fred Ebb, much more of the music was used than often heard; it was billed as covering numbers in the \"Original Broadway Score, The Film Score and The Revival Score\". In August 1992 he conducted Australian Opera in Melbourne in ''Les Contes d'Hoffmann.\nD'Oyly Carte and later years\nHe was appointed music director of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1992, for whom he conducted and recorded The Yeomen of the Guard after a 26-week tour starting from the Alexandra Theatre in Birmingham. This recording featured rarely played horn parts in the Shadbolt aria \"When Jealous Torments\", Meryll's song \"A Laughing Boy\", a phrase for Kate in the finale, and the original version of \"Is Life a Boon?\". One critic noted of the revived D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, \"Their greatest single asset is the music director John Owen Edwards: both pieces (Iolanthe and The Count of Luxembourg) were extremely well conducted and their idioms clearly differentiated via an alert orchestra, the Sullivan beautifully clear, allowing one to relish anew the exquisite instrumentation, the Lehar authentically luscious\". For the years he was music director of D’Oyly Carte, he conducted Patience, The Yeomen of the Guard, H.M.S. Pinafore, The Mikado, The Pirates of Penzance, Iolanthe, Orpheus in the Underworld, Die Fledermaus, The Count of Luxembourg and La Vie Parisienne. The Mikado was filmed at Buxton Opera House and broadcast on BBC2 on Boxing Day 1992. Owen Edwards was happy with the policy of D'Oyly Carte to branch out into parts of the light opera repertoire beyond its traditional Gilbert and Sullivan, \"mentioning in passing such diverse possibilities as ... The Merry Wives of Windsor, German's Tom Jones [and] The Most Happy Fella\", the last of which he recorded complete in the late 1990s with Loesser's daughter Emily as Rosabella and included six extracts cut before the opera opened on Broadway.\nAt the National Theatre in London he conducted Oklahoma! He also conducted Orpheus in the Underworld for British Youth Opera in 2002, and at Opera Holland Park in 2009. His concert work includes a series of Gilbert and Sullivan concerts with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra,\nHe has been the musical director of a number of musicals in London's West End, including Annie, Evita, Chess, Anything Goes, The Phantom of the Opera, The Sloane Ranger Revue, The King and I, and A Little Night Music, and also worked on The Wizard of Oz for the Royal Shakespeare Company. For the Hong Kong Academy for the Performing Arts, he conducted the musicals Guys and Dolls and Damn Yankees, also Showboat at the Opéra du Rhin in Strasbourg, and Hello, Dolly! at the Vienna Volksoper\nFor the Gärtnerplatztheater in Munich, John Owen Edwards created the new orchestration for the continental premiere of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. At the Stadttheater Klagenfurt he conducted Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street in 2009, My Fair Lady, and Les Misérables. At Opera Holland Park he conducted Die Fledermaus in 2004, Die lustige Witwe in 2006 and Orphée aux enfers (Orpheus in the Underworld) in 2009.\nHe has also conducted many concerts, including with Alfie Boe and ABBA, and taught as a professor at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama from 1977 to 1985, where he conducted Company and Wonderful Town. In 1990 he returned to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama to conduct \"with complete authority\" a production of On the Twentieth Century and, in July 1991, Out of this world.\nIn 2012 he supervised rehearsals for a production of The Grand Duke at the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival and took a joint curtain call in a wheelchair.\nRadio\nOwen Edwards's work on BBC radio included programmes with the vocal group Cantabile, music for E.
