It blooms between April and September producing blue-purple flowers in WA. However, in the Northern Territory it flowers from February through to December and fruits from February to November, while in NSW it flowers throughout the year.\nIt is similar to W. communis: both have large corollas with long lobes, however W. communis differs in having a strictly alternate leaf arrangement, long hairs on the inner surface of the corolla tube near the base, and obconical (and frequently more elongated) fruit.\nThe species is found on the edges of swamps and creek beds and damp flats in the Kimberley region of Western Australia where it grows in sandy-loam soils. In the Territory it is found on mulga-dominated plains, alluvial plains and intermittent watercourses.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://avh.ala.org.au/occurrences/search?taxa=Wahlenbergia+queenslandica#tab_mapView Wahlenbergia queenslandica: Occurrence data from the Australasian Virtual Herbarium]"
