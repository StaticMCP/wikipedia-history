Developed by the Polish company TestRevolution Sp. z o.o. and launched in 2019, BugBug enables users to create, edit, and execute automated end-to-end tests directly in a web browser—without writing code.\nOverview\nBugBug simplifies automated testing for QA teams, developers, and non-technical users.\nThe platform includes a Chrome extension that simplifies test creation. With its visual interface, users can record tests by interacting directly within the browser, capturing every click and text input automatically.\nThe tool supports both local and cloud execution, making it suitable for individuals and scaling teams.\nFeatures\nSource:\n* Codeless test creation: Record user actions via a Chrome browser extension.\n* Edit & Rewind: Modify or add test steps from any point in the test sequence and resume execution from there.\n* Variables and dynamic data: Use random values, environment-specific variables, and temporary inboxes for testing flows like signup and login.\n* Local and cloud execution: Unlimited local test runs (FREE plan), unlimited cloud runs (PRO and BUSINESS plan).\n* Smart features: Automatic selectors, smart waits, conditional logic, and support for custom JavaScript.\n* Reusable components: Create shared, reusable blocks of test steps to reduce duplication and ease maintenance.\n* Parallel test execution: Run multiple tests simultaneously in the cloud.\n* Team collaboration: Unlimited users, shared projects, and tests.\n* Reports and alerts: Export results as PDFs and receive alerts via email or Slack.\nSupported technologies\nBugBug is designed for modern web technologies and supports:\n* HTML/CSS/JavaScript\n* Single-page applications (SPAs)\n* Frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js\n* HTTP/REST API communication\nBugBug supports all Chromium-based browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Brave, etc.\nIntegrations\nSource:\nBugBug integrates with a range of CI/CD and team collaboration tools:\n* GitHub Actions\n* GitLab CI/CD\n* Jenkins\n* Bitbucket Pipelines\n* Travis CI\n* Slack\n* Zapier\n* Webhooks for custom workflows\nBugBug allows users to connect to their CI/CD pipeline via the command-line interface (CLI) or BugBug's public API.\nBusiness model\nBugBug follows a freemium pricing model with three tiers:\n* FREE plan: Unlimited users, unlimited local test runs, test recording, Edit&Rewind, screenshots, and 7-day test history.\n* PRO plan (paid plan): Adds unlimited cloud runs, CI/CD integrations, JavaScript steps, Slack/email notifications, PDF reports, 1-month test history, and parallel test execution capabilities.\n* BUSINESS plan (paid plan): Includes REST API access, longer test durations, 1-minute scheduling, 2-month test history, priority support, and parallel test execution capabilities.\nBugBug offers a 14-day trial of paid features for new users.\nHistory\nBugBug was created as a more intuitive alternative to complex test automation tools or frameworks like Selenium.\nThe product officially launched in 2019.\nIn 2024, alongside the launch of new features, the team redesigned its pricing model, resulting in accelerated user growth and increased recurring revenue.\nReception\nBugBug has been positively reviewed for its simplicity, especially by small teams and startups that lack dedicated test automation engineers.\nIt is often compared to:\n* Katalon Studio\n* Testim\n* Rainforest QA\nReviewers praise its ease of use, fixed pricing, and minimal setup time.\nThe Chrome Web Store listing for the BugBug browser extension also reflects positive feedback.\nAs of October 2025, BugBug holds a 4.8 out of 5 rating based on 18 user reviews on G2, with users praising its intuitive interface and fast onboarding process.\nSee also\n* Test automation\n* Appium\n* Graphical user interface testing\n* Katalon Studio\n* Selenium (software)\n* List of web testing tools\nReferences"
