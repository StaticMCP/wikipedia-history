The battle took place in Libyan waters between the Royal Navy and the . An Italian flotilla of small minesweepers and auxiliary vessels evacuating Tripoli was destroyed by two British destroyers.\nBackground\nOn 15 January 1943, the destroyers  and , blockading the port of Tripoli in Libya, had forced the  to retire damaged and then sunk the  ''D'Annunzio, a merchant ship trying to escape from Tripoli, on 15 January. On the night of 19/20 January, the British destroyers Kelvin and  patrolled off Zuwarah, about  west of Tripoli, to cut off the escape of the last Italian ships from Tripoli.\nPrelude\nThe Type 271 radar on Javelin detected ships heading west towards the Tunisian coast, from the direction of Tripoli. The ships were the Tripoli minesweeping flotilla (Lieutenant Giuseppe Di Bartolo), which had been ordered to leave the city for Tunisia and then to Italy, to avoid capture. The flotilla was made up of four small minesweeping tugs (RD 31, RD 36, RD 37 and RD 39, of which RD 36 and 37 had Italian  crews; the naval trawler Scorfano, the largest ship in the convoy, the small tanker Irma; the auxiliary minesweepers DM 12 Guglielmo Marconi (a requisitioned brigantine); R 26 Angelo Musco and R 224 Cinzia (two former fishing vessels); the auxiliary patrol vessel V 66 Astrea (a motor sailing vessel) and the pump boat S. Barbara (towed by Scorfano).\nBattle\nJavelin and Kelvin moved to intercept the Italian ships, fired star shells to illuminate them and then mistook the vessels for an Italian convoy. The Italians were able neither to fight back (the RD minesweepers being armed with a 76 mm gun and two 6.5 mm machine-guns each, while the other ships carried only machine guns) nor to escape, being slower than the destroyers. RD 36, the flotilla leader, tried to cover the retreat of the other ships but was soon sunk with all hands. The other vessels, fleeing towards the coast to allow their crews to escape, were picked off one-by-one. RD 37 and Scorfano were sunk with no survivors; Marconi was set on fire but all of her crew escaped before she sank and Irma was finished off with a torpedo.\nAftermath\nAnalysis\nBy the morning of 20 January, the flotilla had been annihilated. Kelvin had expended 300 rounds of 4.7-inch ammunition and Javelin 500 rounds. Javelin and Kelvin quickly headed for Malta, where they arrived safely the next day. RD 36 and its crew were awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valour for the action against overwhelming odds.\nCasualties\nThe Italians suffered  casualties and the survivors either swam ashore or were picked up by Italian vessels the next day.\nOrders of battle\nBritish destroyers\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+British anti-shipping patrol\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"100px\"  |Name\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"90px\"  |Flag\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"130px\"  |Type\n!
