It was released in the US by Bunch Games, and finally in Japan by Kinema Music as Papillon Gals (the latter version contains nudity).\nGameplay\nThe game is a top-down perspective shooter, often compared to the popular space shooter Galaga.  The player progresses through numerous stages, using missiles and lasers to shoot oncoming enemies. One notable difference from Galaga is Galactic Crusader's many bosses which the player confronts at the end of each level, which often take many hits to defeat.\nReferences"
