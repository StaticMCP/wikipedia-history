In the , Palgrave had a population of 35 people.\nGeography\nThe Herries Range forms the south-western boundary of the locality. Sandy Creek rises on the slopes of the range and then flows northward through the locality exiting to the north-east (the locality of Leslie Dam) where it is impounded by Leslie Dam to create Lake Leslie.\nThe Durakai State Forest is in the west of the locality. Apart from that protected area, the land use is predominantly grazing on native vegetation with some crop growing.\nHistory\nThe locality takes its name from the parish name, which in turn is thought to be named after an officer of the Aberdeen Company operating  several pastoral runs in the area or after a senior public servant.\nRookwood Provisional School opened circa 1888. On 1 January 1909, it became Rookwood State School. It closed circa 1929. The school presumably takes its name from the adjacent Rookwood (also written as Rook Wood) pastoral station. It was located on a  site in a bend of Sandy Creek (approx ). This location is now the place where Sandy Creek flows into Lake Leslie, created by the Leslie Dam which did not exist during the school's lifetime.\nIn October 2023, a light kit-built aircraft crashed in Palgrave, killing the pilot, and starting a grass fire.\nDemographics\nIn the , Palgrave had a population of 17 people.\nIn the , Palgrave had a population of 35 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Palgrave.
