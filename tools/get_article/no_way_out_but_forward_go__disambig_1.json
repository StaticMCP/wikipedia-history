It has been reissued several times, sometimes as Love Like Blood, without the video content.\nRelease\nThe recording was licensed by the festival organisers without the band's approval, hence the title. Drummer Paul Ferguson said in 2004: \"Well, it was a fantastic day. We had a hoot. The Chili Peppers, Parliament, the Blasters. They were friends of ours. So, the hotel after the show was absolutely a riot... And it was a beautiful place, overlooking the banks of the Rhine. But Killing Joke on at three in the afternoon? Excuse me, but that does not work. And it wasn't a great show. We were just there and doing it. And unfortunately, the guy that released it, released it purely because it was the only material that he could get his hands on. That's unfortunately what's happening now, because there wasn't a lot of material and now people are just trying to make a buck here and there.\"\n...No Way Out but Forward Go was initially released on 6 May 2001 by Pilot Records in a double-disc CD edition, the first disc being a normal audio CD, the second a CD-ROM with live videos of all tracks. It was also released as a double LP, and came, of course, without any video.\nIt was reissued as Love Like Blood in 2002, without the accompanying videos, by Digimode Entertainment on their Brilliant (budget line) series. A remastered version, also called Love Like Blood, was released in 2007 on Candlelight Records, again without videos and with a slightly altered track listing (see below).\nThe band's own KJ Records released a version in 2006, which included the video content and original track listing.\nReception\n| rev2 = The Encyclopedia of Popular Music\n| rev2Score =\n}}\nJim Harper of AllMusic felt the album was \"hardly a worthy substitute for a studio album, but it does showcase Killing Joke at their finest.\" Harper criticized the production, saying that \"most of the show sounds as if it's been recorded in a rehearsal room, since the audience appears to be almost entirely lifeless\", but added that \"the band members give it their best effort, however, and throw themselves into the performance wholeheartedly.\"\nTrack listing\nNote: the CD track listing incorrectly swaps \"Chessboards\" with \"Adorations\".\nPersonnel\n;Killing Joke\n* Jaz Coleman – vocals\n* Kevin \"Geordie\" Walker – guitar\n* Paul Raven – bass guitar\n* Paul Ferguson – drums\n* Dave Kovacevic – synthesizer\nReferences"
