It is currently 1.44&nbsp;Mly away from Earth. Its name comes from the fact that it is part of the Phoenix constellation.\nCharacteristics\nThe Phoenix Dwarf has an inner part of young stars which is stretched in an east-west direction and an outer part of mainly old stars that is stretched north-south. The central region's rate of star formation seems to have been relatively constant across time (Martínez-Delgado et al. 1999). In 1999, St-Germain et al. discovered a H I region of about 105  just to the west of Phoenix. Its radial velocity is −23&nbsp;km/s and may be physically associated with Phoenix if it is found to have a similar radial velocity.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
