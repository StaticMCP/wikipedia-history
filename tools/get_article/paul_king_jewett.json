He taught systematic theology at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California. He is credited with helping develop Fuller into one of the largest seminaries in the country.\nEarly life and education\nJewett was born on October 6, 1919 in Johnson City, New York, the older of two children. His father was a carpenter and his mother was a homemaker. His family attended a Regular Baptist church.\nJewett studied at Wheaton College and  received his B.A. in 1941, studying with Gordon H. Clark and majoring in philosophy. He then attended Westminster Theological Seminary and graduated in 1945 with Th.B. and Th.M. degrees. He  obtained a doctorate in theology from Harvard in 1951, with much of his dissertation research done in Switzerland at the University of Berne, the University of Zurich, and the University of Basel.\nCareer\nJewett taught at Gordon Divinity School from 1950 until 1955.  He was a professor of systematic theology at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena from 1955 until his death in 1991.\nEarly in his career, Jewett was ordained as a minister in the American Baptist Church.  However, in 1970 he transferred his ordination credentials to the Presbyterian Church, U.S.A. While he continued to believe in Believer's Baptism until the end of his life, he stated that he felt more at home with the Reformed theology of the Presbyterian Church.\nTheology\nJewett is credited with being one of the major instigators of the contemporary Christian egalitarian movement in the evangelical church. In 1975 his book Man as Male and Female was published. This work reconsiders the biblical evidence for the role of men and women and argues that Paul was speaking as inspired by God when he argued from the equality of women, but with a Jewish rabbinic mindset when speaking of women as subordinate to man. Jewett called Galatians 3:28 the \"Magna Carta of humanity\".\nJewett was a controversial figure in evangelicalism beginning with his book Man as Male and Female which reconsidered traditional theology on the male/female relationship going so far as to suggest Paul was at times chauvinistic and uninspired in some areas of the New Testament epistles. His last work, co-authored with Marguerite Shuster was meant to be part of a larger systematic theology he was writing but died before completing. It revealed liberal views on evolution, abortion, capital punishment, and homosexuality.\nPersonal life and death\nJewett married his wife Christine in 1945, and had two daughters. He died of cancer in Pasadena on September 10, 1991.\nBooks\n*''Emil Brunner's Concept of Revelation. James Clarke, 1954.\n*Emil Brunner : An Introduction to the Man and His Thought.
