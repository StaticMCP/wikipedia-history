Slow and sporadic boats ran along the Parramatta River from Sydney to Parramatta and served the agricultural settlements in between. By the mid-1830s, speculative ventures established regular services. From the late-nineteenth century the North Shore developed rapidly. A rail connection to Milsons Point took alighting ferry passengers up the North Shore line to Hornsby, New South Wales via North Sydney. Without a bridge connection, increasingly large fleets of steamers serviced the cross harbour routes and in the early twentieth century, Sydney Ferries Limited was the largest ferry operator in the world.\nHowever, arguably the most well-known is the Manly ferry service, and its large ship-like ferries that negotiate the beam swells of the Sydney Heads. From the mid-nineteenth century, the Port Jackson and Manly Steamship Company and its forerunners ran commuter and weekend excursion services to the beach-side suburb.\nThe 1932 opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge dramatically and permanently changed Sydney Harbour. Sydney Ferries Limited annual patronage fell from 40 million to 15 million almost immediately. The hardships of the Great Depression and Second World War slowed the ferries' decline, but by 1951 the NSW State Government was forced to take over the ailing Sydney Ferries Limited. The Manly service fared better, and the Port Jackson company's peak year was 1946, after which a slow decline saw it too taken over by the NSW State Government in the 1970s. Ferry operations were privatised in 2015 with vessels and facilities remaining in public ownership.\nSydney's first ferries were sail and/or oar powered and by the mid-19th century, paddle steamers were well established. Double-ended ferries became common as they did not require turning at terminating wharves in Sydney's busy but narrow bays, including the main hub at Circular Quay. Double-ender ferries, however, provided technological challenges for screw (propeller) propulsion and Sydney's shift from paddle steamers to screw ferries in the closing years of the nineteenth century was relatively late. Diesel power first came to Sydney Harbour ferries mainly through the conversion of existing steam ferries to diesel in the 1930s and the 1950s, as ferry companies could generally not afford new ferries in the slow post-Bridge decades. Hydrofoils were introduced to the Manly run in the 1960s and 1970s halving travel times for those willing to pay a premium fare. Government investment in new vessels during the 1970s and 1980s saw the replacement of the surviving early twentieth century vessels. New vessels included modern Lady-class ferries, four large Manly ferries, and nine First-Fleet ferries. The most recent decades have seen the introduction of the RiverCats, JetCats, SuperCats and in 2017, the Emerald-class ferries. Apart from the four Manly \"Freshwater-class\" ferries, the current Sydney Ferries fleet comprises all catamarans.\nEarly days\n*October 1789 - The Rose Hill Packet is launched and provides a link between Sydney Cove and the farming settlement of Parramatta. The hoy is crafted by convicts and is powered by sails and oars. Return trips between Sydney Cove to Parramatta could take a week to complete.\n*1793 - The first regular Parramatta River ferry service begins.\n*circa 1800 - A number of small passage boats manned by a single oarsman provide services. The Rose Hill Packet is thought to have been discarded.\n'', was used sporadically on the Parramatta River.]]\n*circa 1830 - Ex-convict, Billy Blue, provides Sydney's first regular cross-harbour rowboat from Dawes Point to Blues Point.\n*1830s - A sporadic ferry service is set up between Balmoral Beach and Balgowlah that shortens the long bush journey between Sydney and Manly and Northern Beaches. It is provided by a small sailing ketch operated by Barney Kearns. From Balmoral, passengers have to travel overland to Milson's Point where they are rowed across the harbour by a waterman. The service does not last long requiring a longer and difficult overland trip.\n*1831 - The ocean-going steamer Sophia Jane arrives in Sydney and used sporadically on the Parramatta River in between towing and coastal trade to Newcastle.\n*1 June 1831 - The first Australian-built paddle steamer, Surprise, starts regular service to Parramatta. She has limited financial success and is sold to Hobart in 1832.\n*5 October 1832 - Experiment, a paddle-steamer powered by horses on a treadmill, makes her first run to Parramatta. She immediately lost money and was sold.\n*c1832 - The Bedlam Point manually operated punt (Abbotsford - Gladesville) becomes the first ferry crossing.\n*1833 - the Australian Conveyance Company is formed and launches a new ferry, Australia on the Parramatta service. With limited competition, the service is a success with a dividend paid in 1836 of 38 per cent.\n*9 April 1835 - Experiment is put back into service having been fitted with 12&nbsp;hp steam engine. Under the new ownership of shipping entrepreneur, John Edye Manning, she carries passengers and cargo, as well as towing work for the next five years. Australia and Experiment thus provide the first regular ferry service in Sydney.\n*1837 - Following the success of Australia, the Australian Conveyance Company commissions a new steamer Rapid which promised a ninety-minute trip\n1840s and 1850s\n*circa 1841 - A cross harbour service run by punt, Princess, runs in daylight hours between Dawes and Blues Points.  The service fails after fifteen months.\n*1844 - The Waterman's Company introduces a service to Balmain with the paddle steamer Waterman, however, her reliability is poor.\n*1845 - Brothers Thomas and James Gerrard, use the small steamer, Fairy Queen, between Windmill Street and Blues Point, forming the first reliable cross-harbour service.\n*1847 - Henry Perdriau & Partners take over the Waterman and expand the service over the next three decades.\n*9 October 1847 - A small timber paddle steamer, Brothers, begins a run from Windmill Street in The Rocks to Blues Point.\n*1848 - John and Joseph Gerrard shift Brothers to a sporadic Manly service, and she becomes accepted as the first Manly ferry.\n*1853 - Henry Gilbert Smith charters Brothers for the first scheduled service between Sydney and Manly as the tourist trade grows.\n*1854 - Paddle steamer Victoria begins excursion trips to Watsons Bay.\n*1855 - Iron paddle steamer, Herald, is imported from England in sections and assembled in Sydney for the newly formed North Shore Steam Company. She is used on a fledgling North Shore route between Dawes Point and Blues Point and also as a tug to make her financially viable.\n*1855 - The Sydney-Parramatta railway opens, however, due to its alignment considerably south of the harbour, ferry services are still important for services along the Parramatta River.\n*1856 - Paddle steamer, Victoria, begins daily services to Manly. Running until 1860, she is the first regular Manly ferry.\n*1859 - Phantom, the first large double-ended ferry on the Manly run, is put into service by a new business partnership between Henry Gilbert Smith and SB Skinner established to operate the ferries.\nFile:Sydney_Ferry_EMU_(I).jpg|Paddle steamer, Emu\nFile:Paddle_Steamer_Herald_1855_-_1884.jpg|Herald was used on a fledgling service to the North Shore\nFile:Painting of Sydney paddle steamer ferry BROTHERS (1847-1890).jpg|Painting of Brothers which provided the first scheduled Manly ferry service.\nFile:Sydney paddle steamer Ferry PHANTOM at Manly Wharf ca 1870s.jpg|Manly Wharf, 1870s, with Phantom.\n1860s and 1870s\n*1860s - The cross-harbour punt at Bedlam Point is joined by manually operated punts at Gladesville (Five Dock Point - Huntleys Point) and Iron Cove (Rozelle - Drummoyne).\n*1860 - Mosman landowner Richard Hayes Harnett commences excursion services to promote his land sales hiring steamers Black Swan, Perri, Brothers and Herald. The service is abandoned due to slow sales.\n*1861 - City to North Shore services have grown considerably and the North Shore Ferry Company is formed. The company's first ferry is Kirribilli (I). Alexander, Nell, Galatea and Coombra follow. The unincorporated company is the forerunner of what will become Sydney Ferries Limited in 1900. Its backers include James Milson and Francis Lord.\n*1864 - A regular ferry service is commenced to the Neutral Bay area, however, it is soon discontinued.\n*1865 - The Parramatta River Steam Company is formed by Charles Edward Jeanneret initially in partnership with Jules Joubert. It is incorporated the following year. Its first services are by Ysobel and its main vessel will be Adelaide (later renamed Swan).\n*1867/68 - Ownership of the Manly services passes to TJ Parker and later Thomas Hesleton who expanded both passenger and cargo services acquiring the first permanent saloon steamer, Royal Alfred, in 1873.\n*1870s - Land subdivision sees development east of Milsons Point in the Neutral Bay and Mosman areas. Mosman is originally an excursion area and residential development suffers until regular ferry services began in the 1870s.\n*1871 - Harnett recommences ferry services to Mosman using Herald.\n*1871 - The Joubert family commences ferry services to Hunters Hill and a service along the Lane Cove River to Figtree.\n*1873 (circa) - Herald is working to Mosman Bay and Neutral Bay in a somewhat irregular weekday timetable.\n*1873 - The North Shore Ferry Company is reformed as the North Shore Steam Ferry Company\n*1873 - Jeanneret establishes his own ferry operation which becomes the monopoly Parramatta River services by 1875.\n*1875 - Ownership of the Manly service passes to JR Carey who, with other partners the following year, injects new capital into the service.\n*1876 - William Harmer begins a ferry service to Watsons Bay.\n*1876 - Harnett buys back the Mosman estate and he successfully subdivides the land. He commences a more successful service for the new residents using Golden Rose, Zeus, Speedwell and Matilda. The service is taken over by Shipley, Chapman and Company in 1878 and by Charles Jeanneret in 1881.\n*1877 - The Port Jackson Steam Boat Company is incorporated and commences services to Manly from Circular Quay via Woolloomooloo.\n*1878 - The North Shore Steam Ferry Company becomes the limited liability North Shore Steam Ferry Company.\n*1878 - Fairlight, the first purpose-built Manly ferry, enters service for the Port Jackson Steam Boat Company. The first of five subsequent Manly ferries built in Scotland, the paddle-steamer is rated at 950 passengers and works on the Harbour until 1914.\n*1879 - The North Shore Company introduces Sydney's first, and the world's second, double-ended screw ferry, Wallaby. This remains the basic design of all Sydney double-ended screw ferries, however, the company continues acquiring paddle steamers until 1885. Double-ended screw ferries become the norm for the fleet from 1891 with the introduction of Kangaroo.\nFile:Title- S.S.

Limited. New vessels are acquired.\n*1881 - Aleathea is introduced and is the second double-ended screw ferry and the first ferry on the harbour with electric lighting.\n*1881 - Sir John Robertson takes over and expands Watson Bay services. In 1887, the company is formed into a limited liability company, the Watsons Bay Steam and South Shore Steam Ferry Company. In comparison to other harbour areas, the service relies more heavily on tourist trade although there is considerable residential trade from the South Head peninsula. The service also derives much trade from the Garden Island Naval Dockyard which was a separated island until World War II.\n*1882 - Charles Jeanneret begins services to the North Shore.\n*1882 - The Perdriau family form the Balmain Steam Ferry Company Limited as a limited liability company. It faces competition from the J Watson and Partners which it buys out in 1887. The company, along with the North Shore Steam Ferry Company Limited, go on to refine the double-ended wooden ferry which will form the backbone of inner harbour ferry fleets for most of the twentieth century.\n*1883 - The Port Jackson Steamship Company commissions the double-ended paddle steamer, Brighton. At  in length, it is the largest ferry on Sydney Harbour at the time, and with a high level of appointment, it is a passenger favourite.\n*1883 - Charles Jeanneret provides a tramway from the second Parramatta Wharf (Redbank Wharf, near Duck River) located further downstream allowing deeper draft screw steamers to berth.\n*1884 - The first all-night service from Circular Quay to Lavender Bay via McMahons Point and Milsons Point begins.\n*1885 - The limited liability Neutral Bay Steam Ferry Company Limited is formed running services to Mosman, Cremorne, and Neutral Bay.\n*1886 - A cable tram service from Ridge Street in North Sydney to Milsons Point commences and the main ferry wharf is moved there and it becomes the harbour's busiest. Prior to this, most North Shore passenger traffic had been via the Lavender Bay ferry wharf.\n*1886 - Paddle steamer, Narrabeen is built by Mort's Dock & Engineering Company for the Port Jackson Steamship Company. Smaller than Brighton, she is mainly used on off-peak services and she is converted to a cargo vessel in 1911 as the newer \"Binngarra-class\" vessels are introduced.\n*1887 - The North Shore Ferry Company adsorbs the Neutral Bay Steam Ferry Company.\n*1889 - Charles Jeanneret sells his Parramatta River ferry interests to P Walker.\nFile:Sydney Ferry ALEATHEA on Sydney Harbour. ca 1910.jpg|River ferry Aleathea (1881) - built as Sydney's second double-ended screw ferry, and the first with electric lighting.\nFile:Sydney Ferry BRIGHTON Circular Quay.jpg|Opulent Manly ferry Brighton (1883-1916) was the largest paddle steamer ferry on Sydney Harbour\nFile:Sydney Ferry WARATAH (II).jpg|Paddle steamer Waratah in Lavender Bay circa 1886\nFile:Sydney Ferry VICTORIA 2.jpg|Victoria (built 1883) is typical of Sydney's double-ended inner harbour paddle steamer ferries of the late 19th century.\n1890s\n*1892 - The Balmain New Ferry Company Limited is set up in competition to the Balmain Steam Ferry Company. The new competition and the 1890s recession see the new company take over the old in 1900. The company delivers The Lady Mary, the first of its Walter Reeks-designed double-ended \"Lady-class\" ferries. She is followed by The Lady Napier (1892), Lady Manning (1894), and Lady Hampden (1896). A further nine are built for the company between 1903 and 1914.\n*1893 - A limited liability company, the Parramatta River Steamers and Tramway Company Limited is formed. The company is taken over by Sydney Ferries Limited in 1901.\n*1893 - The Manly Co-operative Steam Ferry Company is formed in opposition to the Port Jackson Steam Boat Company. Supported by Manly Municipal Council and many residents, the new-comer pushes down fares making Manly excursions affordable to a broader class of people.\n*1893 - A train terminus is opened at Milsons Point connecting the North Shore railway line from Hornsby to the harbour, and along with the 1886 tram connection, serves a large catchment of commuters from across the North Shore for ferries across the harbour.\n*1896 - The Port Jackson Steamship Company adsorbs struggling rival Manly Co-operative Steam Ferry Company and is reincorporated as the Port Jackson Co-operative Steamship Company.\n*1896 - Manly (II) starts on the Manly run. Ordered by the Manly Co-operative Steam Ferry Company and designed by renowned naval architect, Walter Reeks, she is the first double-ended screw ferry on the Manly run and remains one of the fastest ferries to have worked on the run.\n*1899 - Thomas Henley takes acquires three vessels from the struggling Balmain Steam Ferry Company and commences services to Drummoyne and Haberfield. In 1900, the Balmain Steam Ferry Company is taken over by the Balmain New Ferry Company.\n*14 December 1899 - the North Shore Ferry Company is incorporated as Sydney Ferries Limited.\nFile:The launch of THE LADY MARY at Berry's Bay, North Sydney (8137002816).jpg|Launch of The Lady Mary at Berrys Bay, North Sydney, 1892, the first of a long series of \"Lady-class\" ferries\nFile:Sydney Ferry BRONZEWING 2.jpg|Bronzewing the largest of Sydney's single-ended ferries, and the last traditional 'river type' boat built for the Parramatta service.\nFile:Sydney Ferry MILLIE in Mosman Bay circa 1885 - 1895.jpg|Paddle steamer Millie at Mosman Bay\nFile:Steamship Manly II an Early Manly Ferry.jpg|The fast Manly (II), designed by Walter Reeks, she is the first double-ended screw ferry on the Manly run.\n1900s\n*1900 - The Balmain New Ferry Company (formed 1892) takes over the Balmain Steam Ferry Company (formed 1882). The Balmain New Ferry Company, with naval architect Walter Reeks develops double-ended screw ferries with single screws pushing the vessel in one direction and pulling it in the other. This single \"push-pull\" configuration is seen in the timber \"Lady-class\" vessels.\n*1 January 1901 - The North Shore Steam Ferry Company is renamed Sydney Ferries Limited. It goes on to adsorb most of Sydney's ferry services, acquiring the Parramatta River Company in 1901, the New Balmain Ferry Company in 1917, and the Watsons Bay Ferry Company in 1920. Between 1900 and 1922, Sydney Ferries Limited will also acquire 25 large ferryboats, predominantly the \"K-class\" ferries. Such is the growth in demand for cross-harbour ferries prior to the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Sydney Ferries Limited becomes the world's largest ferry operator by fleet size and patronage.\n*1901 - Sydney Ferries Limited takes over the Parramatta River service with its acquisition of the Parramatta River Steamers and Tramway Co. Ltd.\n*1901 - Increasing demand on the vehicular ferry service from Milsons Point to Bennelong Point sees the Blues Point to Dawes Point vehicular service re-established.\n*1901 - The Walter Reeks designed Kuring-gai enters service on the Manly run. A steel, double-ended screw steamer, in appearance, size and capacity she will become the archetype of the familiar Manly ferries of the twentieth century.\n*1903 - The City terminus for Parramatta and Lane Cove River ferries is moved from Darling Harbour to number 6/7 jetty at Circular Quay. Jetties 4 and 5 are rebuilt for all North Shore services.\n*1905 - Sydney Ferries Limited begins services to Clifton Gardens, Balmoral, and The Spit.\n*early 1906 - The Balmain New Ferry Company takes over the Joubert-run Lane Cove ferries. Sydney Ferries Limited takes over the service in 1917.\n*1906 - Binngarra, the first of six similar double-ended screw steamers, enters service for the Port Jackson and Manly Steamship Company. She will be followed by Burra Bra (1908), Bellubera (1910),  Balgowlah (1912), Barrenjoey (1913), and Baragoola (1922). Bellubera, Baragoola, and Barrenjoey (renamed North Head in 1951) will serve until 1973, 1983, and 1985 respectively.\n*1906 - Sydney Ferries Limited purchases the Thompson estate at Clifton Gardens (in Mosman) including land, the three-storey hotel, wharf dancing pavilion and skating rink. The company builds a large circular swimming enclosure that holds 3,000 spectators, a boatshed and a tramway from the wharf to the hotel. The structure burns down in 1956.\n*1907 - The Port Jackson Co-operative Steamship Company is re-incorporated as the Port Jackson and Manly Steamship Company Limited.\n*1907 - Sydney Ferries Limited introduces the K-class ferry, Kookooburra. It represents the company's first attempt at a designing a Parramatta River ferry after taking over that service in 1901. The company follows up Kookooburra with a smaller but otherwise similar ferry, Kuranda (soon renamed Kaludah) in 1909. In 1911, Kaludah will burn out and sink in Tarban Creek becoming possibly the shortest-lived of all Sydney Harbour ferries.\n*1908 - The Upper Lane Cove River Ferry Co starts services on the Upper Lane Cove River between Figtree and Fiddens Wharf, West Killara.\n* 1909 - With increasing commuter pressure on the Milsons Point terminus, a supplementary tram line is built to McMahons Point from which ferry services to the City also operate.\nFile:Sydney ferry KURING-GAI at Circular Quay early 20 th century.jpg|Kuring-gai, the archetype for the six \"Binngarra-type\" ferries.\nFile:Binngarra Ferry.jpg|Binngarra (1906) enters service on the Manly run.

She is followed by the near identical Kiandra in 1911 and Kubu in 1912 forming a sub-class known as the \"Kirrule-type\" ferry. Built for the busy Mosman run, they can carry 1,000 passengers each. The three survive the 1932 opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and are decommissioned in the 1950s.\n*1910 - The Balmain New Ferry Company introduces Lady Chelmsford, which is the first of new series of \"Lady-class\" double-ended screw ferries. She is followed by the similar Lady Denman (1912), Lady Edeline (1913), Lady Scott (1914), and Lady Ferguson (1914). The five serve in various ferry routes until the late 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.\n*December 1911 - Sydney Ferries Limited adds a service to meet the tram at the new Cremorne Point wharf.\n*Summer 1912/13 - The Watsons Bay Company charters the steamer, JW Alexander, to run a service between Watsons Bay and Manly. The company orders a new ferry, Woollahra, which is specially designed for the service with high bulwarks and wheelhouses. However, upon her delivery in 1913, the new Watsons Bay to Manly service has proved unprofitable and is discontinued. Woollahra is instead used on the existing Circular Quay to Watsons Bay run.\n*24 September 1916 - Sydney Ferries Limited vehicular ferry, Kedumba, transports the elephant 'Jessi' across the harbour from the old Moore Park Zoo to the newly opened Taronga Zoo. Sydney Ferries Limited commences regular services to the Zoo thereafter.\n*1917 - Sydney Ferries Limited takes over the Balmain New Ferry Company and most of its fleet including the \"Lady-class\" ferries.\n*1918 - Sydney Ferries forms two subsidiaries to manage its cargo, lighterage and property businesses, which later merge to form Harbour Land and Transport Company Ltd.\nFile:Sydney Ferry KIRAWA in Mosman Bay 1915.jpg|Kirawa leaving Mosman Bay wharf, 1915.

In addition to buying out most of the other ferry operators and their assets, between 1900 and 1914 the company acquired 25 large vessels - mostly of the type known as the K-class - on its own accord. Sydney Ferries Limited becomes the world's largest ferry operator in terms of both fleet size and patronage.\n*1920 - Sydney Ferries Limited takes over the Watsons Bay service and its four ferries, King Edward (1905), Vaucluse (1905), Greycliffe (1911), and Woollahra (1913).\n*1921 - Kooroongaba, the first of four larger cross-harbour vehicular ferries is added to the existing fleet of car ferries. She is followed by Koondooloo in 1924, and Kalang and Kara Kara in 1926.\n*1922 - To meet booming demand for cross-harbour services to Milsons Point, Sydney Ferries Limited commissions the Kuttabul and Koompartoo the largest capacity ferries ever on Sydney Harbour. For the rest of the 1920s, Sydney Ferries serves an historic peak in demand for cross-harbour services.\n*3 September 1922 - Baragoola, the last of six \"Binngarra\"-class ferries enters service. Being six metres shorter than her sisters and with a greater beam, she is slower than the previous five boats. She is converted from steam to diesel power in 1961 and is retired from ferry service in 1983.\n*1923 - Work commences on a bridge between Dawes Point and Milsons Point. The Milsons Point ferry/train/tram terminus is relocated.\n*1927 - The Watsons Bay ferry, Greycliffe, is struck and sunk by the liner RMS Tahiti. 40 ferry passengers are killed in the disaster.\n*1928 - Sydney Ferries Limited ceases Parramatta River services beyond Gladesville due to train and road competition. A Sydney Ferries Limited subsidiary maintains a cargo service to Parramatta until 1941.\n*1928 - Two new steamers, Dee Why and Curl Curl, are built in Scotland for the Manly run. Travelling to Sydney under their own steam, they are the largest ferries on Sydney Harbour until the 1938 introduction of the South Steyne. Reaching 17.6 knots on her trials, Curl Curl is considered to have been the fastest mono-hull ferry on the harbour.\nFile:Sydney vehicular ferry KOONDOOLOO at Jeffrey Street Wharf Kirribilli circa 1925.jpg|Vehicular ferry, Koondooloo, at Jeffrey Street Wharf, Kirribilli circa 1925.

Annual passenger numbers decrease from 40 million to fourteen million. Sydney Ferries Limited services to Milsons Point and vehicular services cease. Over the next two years, Sydney Ferries pulls 18, mostly older, ferries from service. Those retired include all vehicular ferries, the older first class of \"Lady-class\" ferries acquired from the Balmain Company, and a number of the older K-class ferries. Also withdrawn are the large and relatively new Koompartoo and Kuttabul from the redundant Milsons Point route. They are used mainly for concert and showboat work until the outbreak of World War II.\n*late March and early April 1932 - Vehicular ferry services between Dawes Point and Blues Point, and between Bennelong Point to Milsons Point cease less than two weeks after the bridge's opening. The 350-ton vehicular ferries, Koondooloo (1924), Kalang (1926) and Kara Kara (1926) are laid up. Other vehicular ferries are scrapped, however, Kooroongaba went to work crossing the Hunter River between Stockton and Newcastle. In the mid-1930s, demand for harbour cruises increases and the company fits out Koondooloo as a two-deck showboat. Such is her success, that Kalang is similarly fitted out as a three-deck showboat, and a third deck is later added to Koondooloo.\n*1932/33 - The Port Jackson Company builds a large harbour pool and pavilion at Manly Cove. The pool structure is destroyed in a 1974 storm and is not rebuilt.\n*1933 - Watsons Bay services cease with those ferries being disposed of or placed on other runs.\n*1933 - In attempt to modernise the fleet, Lady Chelmsford is converted from steam to diesel propulsion. A Gardner diesel, two strike five-cylinder provides 190&nbsp;hp (141&nbsp;kW) and 10.3 knots. Conversion of the remaining four \"Lady-class\" ferries and Karingal and Karrabee takes place over the 1930s. In line with the modernisation drive, the varnished timber finishes of the Sydney Ferries Limited fleets are painted over in a green and gold scheme.\n*16 November 1936 - a fire destroys ''Bellubera's timber superstructure while she is moored at the Kurraba Point depot. Two crew members die. She is rebuilt at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard and re-enters service in October 1937.\n*12 February 1938 - Rodney capsizes and sinks with the loss of nineteen lives.
