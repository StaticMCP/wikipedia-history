It is a scheduled monument.\nLocation and description\nThe site is  above sea level, on a hill at the heads of two tributaries of the River Ottery. There are views to Lundy Island and Dartmoor.\nThe fort is one of the largest earthworks in Cornwall. It is an oval enclosure, area about  . There are two concentric ramparts and ditches; the ramparts are up to  high, with ditches up to  deep. Between these, in the southern part, are the remains of an earlier rampart.\nThe inner rampart has two original entrances, inturned and facing each other, on the north-west and south-east, and there are corresponding simple entrances in the outer rampart.\nPillow mound\nIn the centre of the fort is a medieval rabbit warren: a rectangular mound, or pillow mound, about  long,  wide and  high. It is known as \"The Giant's Grave\" or \"King Arthur's Grave\".\nSee also\n* Hillforts in Britain\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://heritagecalling.com/2014/05/23/warbstow-bury-re-writing-the-story-of-a-cornish-hillfort/ Warbstow Bury: Re-writing the Story of a Cornish Hillfort] Heritage Calling: A Historic England Blog"
