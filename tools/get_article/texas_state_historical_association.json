It was founded in Austin, Texas, United States, on March 2, 1897. In November 2008, the TSHA moved its offices from Austin to the University of North Texas in Denton, Texas. In 2015, the offices were relocated again to the University of Texas at Austin.\nHistory\nOn February 13, 1897, ten persons convened to discuss the creation of a nonprofit to promote Texas state history. George Pierce Garrison, chair of the University of Texas history department, led the organizational meeting establishing the association on March 2, 1893. The TSHA elected Oran Milo Roberts as its first president. In addition to Roberts, TSHA charter members included Guy M. Bryan, Anna Pennybacker, Bride Neill Taylor, and Dudley G. Wooten. About twenty or thirty persons attended the charter meeting. One of the founders was John Henninger Reagan.\nThis first formal meeting of the TSHA included men and several women who became charter members.\nAt this first meeting, George P. Garrison advocated that archival material about Texas needed to be preserved. Officers were chosen during the meeting, and controversy over what John Salmon Ford called \"lady members\" caused Ford to storm out of the meeting. Ford wanted to amend the TSHA constitution to replace \"members\" with \"lady members\" when the participants were women. Garrison opposed the change, and eventually Taylor spoke up and agreed that there was no need to change anything. Ford could not be placated and after yelling at Taylor, \"Madam, your brass may get you into the association, but you will never have the right to get in under that section as it stands,\" his amendment to create \"lady members\" was unanimously defeated by the others at the meeting. The other charter members viewed Ford's departure as detrimental, counting on his political influence to help support the group.\nThe first president was Oran Milo Roberts, with Wooten, Bryan, Julia Lee Sinks, and Charles Corner elected as vice presidents. Membership dues were $2 a year in 1897.\nThe TSHA held annual meetings in Austin. The first annual meeting was held on June 17, 1897. Topics included \"The Expulsion of the Cherokees From East Texas, \"The Last Survivor of the Goliad Massacre,\" \"The Veramendt House,\" \"Thomson's Clandestine Passage Around Nacogdoches,\" and \"Defunct Counties of Texas.\" There was also a group business meeting.\nBy 1928, the TSHA had 500 members.\nNotable members\n* Ben H.
