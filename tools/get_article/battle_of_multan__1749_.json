He was hated by everyone after how many people he had slaughtered when he was the custodian of Lahore. Therefore, Mir Mannu decided to send Kaura Mal and Asmat Khan to Multan with a large force with a mission to stop the revolt. Since Kaura Mal didn't have many men and materials, he sought for help from the Sikhs and promised them all payment. Their leader Jassa Singh Ahluwalia marched alongside Kaura Mal with 10,000 Sikhs. Kaura Mal won the hearts of the Sikhs by offering them sweet cold drinks which gave him the nickname of Mitha Mal, which means Mr.Sweet.\nBattle\nThe two parties clashed in the outskirts of Multan. The battalion under Khawajah Shah had killed a large amount of Kaura Mal's army which made Shah Nawaz Khan's victory certain. However, some Sikhs fired at him and killed him. This caused a lot of confusion around in the enemy in which Shah Nawaz's horse was shot down and his head was chopped off by a Sikh named Bhim Singh. The Multan Mughals were defeated not too long after this.\nAftermath\nMir Mannu was proud of Kaura Mal and was given the title of Maharaja Bahadur and was also appointed the governor of Multan.\nReferences\nSee also\n* Nihang\n* Martyrdom and Sikhism"
