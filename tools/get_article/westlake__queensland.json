In the , Westlake had a population of 4,547 people.\nGeography\nWestlake adjoins the suburbs of Riverhills, Middle Park and Mount Ommaney.\nHistory\nWestlake was developed as part of the Hooker Centenary Project which commenced in 1959. It and the surrounding suburbs such as Jindalee are known as the Centenary Suburbs. It was officially named by the Queensland Place Names Board on 8 January 1973 with its boundaries determined on 11 August 1975. The suburb takes its name from the lake () constructed by the development project.\nThe western part of the original land holdings that became the Centenary Suburbs were part of the Wolston Estate, consisting of 54 farms on an area of 3000 acres, offered for auction at Centennial Hall, Brisbane, on 16 October 1901. Wolston Estate is the property of M. B. Goggs, whose father obtained the land forty years previously in the 1860s and after whom Goggs Road is named. Only three of the farms sold at the original auction.\nIn 1879, the local government area of Yeerongpilly Division was created. In 1891, parts of Yeerongpilly Division were excised to create Sherwood Division becoming a Shire in 1903 which contained the areas of Wolston Estate. In 1925, the Shire of Sherwood was amalgamated into the City of Brisbane.\nWestlake has much riverside properties and in the early 1990s expanded to include the development Westlake Waters with the 'natural lakes'.\nAs residential expansion occurred, the 1990s also saw the rise of community efforts to preserve riverfront bushland and encourage environmental protection of remnant natural areas. Groups which formed to forge this greater interest in environmental protection include Save Our Riverfront Bushland (1991), Westlake-Riverhills Bushcare Group (1993) and Centenary & District Environment Action Inc (1996).\nDemographics\nIn the , Westlake had a population of 4,380 people, 49.6% female and 50.4% male.
