Named after its type site, the Shijiahe site cluster, it succeeded the Qujialing culture and inherited its unique painted spindle whorls. The culture is characterized by large-scale fortified settlements, advanced agriculture, and specialized craftsmanship, including distinctive jade artifacts and pottery figurines.\nLocation, dating, discovery history, and environmental context\nThe Shijiahe site, located in the Jianghan Plain of Hubei, was first identified in the 1950s, with initial excavations from 1955 to 1957. The culture spans approximately 2500–2000 BC. It thrived in the middle Yangtze region, bordered by the Dabie Mountains to the west, Dongting Lake to the north, the Three Gorges to the east, and the Nanyang Basin to the south. Most sites are located north of the Yangtze between modern Yichang and Wuhan, with some extending southwest to the southern bank, ideal for agriculture and trade via the Yangtze.\nThe region was dominated by wetlands, rivers, lakes, and marshes, with settlements built on raised ground to avoid flooding. Archaeological evidence from Dongting Lake reveals stilted structures from the Pengtoushan culture and Daxi culture, indicating a subtropical environment with deciduous and evergreen forests. Algae remains suggest periodic flooding, and the climate, initially warm and humid, became drier, transitioning to grasslands and scrub, coinciding with reduced human activity.\nSubsistence\nThe Shijiahe culture cultivated Oryza sativa (Asian rice), Setaria italica (foxtail millet), and Panicum miliaceum (common millet), alongside vegetables, amaranths, and plants now considered weeds. By the third millennium BC, irrigated rice paddies emerged, as seen at the Chengtoushan site with its reservoirs. The primary mode of travel was likely watercraft, with constructed channels connecting urban cores to rivers.\nEmergence of fortified settlements\nThe Shijiahe culture saw a significant population increase, with settlements quadrupling in number and increasing five- to sixfold in size by the middle phase, some reaching 800 ha compared to the Daxi culture's largest site, Chengtoushan (6–8 ha). Eight known sites were encircled by earthen walls or moats, which expanded until the middle phase before a sharp decline. At Chengtoushan, the moat was 40–50 m wide, requiring an estimated 200,000 to 470,000 laborers for construction. These fortifications likely served defensive purposes, reflecting early state formation and inter-city rivalries, as suggested by a warrior depiction with a yue-type battle axe at Xiaojia Wuji. Some scholars speculate Shijiahe could be considered an ancient state due to its advanced socio-political structure, potentially surpassing the centralization of Erlitou.\nShijiahe site\nThe Shijiahe complex, spanning 8 km² across terraces between two rivers, comprises about 40 dispersed sites, with a central settlement of nearly one square kilometer, the largest in Neolithic China. Originating as a small Daxi-era village, it grew into a fortified agglomeration, covering 120 ha with earthen walls and moats up to 100 m wide to manage flooding from the Han River and local streams. Houses included concave-shaped structures, enclosed courtyards, and interlinked buildings, typically housing 20–30 people per courtyard, suggesting clan-based units. Larger dwellings likely served elite or specialized functions, and cemeteries near courtyards with about 20 graves reinforce the clan-based social structure. The lower layer of the site belonged to the Qujialing culture, indicating continuity.\nCraftsmanship, funerary practices, and symbolism\nSpecialized craft production was prominent, with Dengjiawan yielding over 10,000 clay figurines (5–10 cm) depicting birds, hens, dogs, sheep, turtles, pigs, elephants, tigers, and humans, some in dance poses or holding a fish, likely for religious purposes. Similar figurines were found in Hunan and Henan. Other sites produced thousands of red pottery cups and stone drills, indicating pottery and jade workshops. In the late phase (2200–2000 BC), jade became prominent in burials, with some tombs containing up to 56 pieces, including anthropomorphic figures, monstrous forms, cong tubes, birds, dragons, cicadas, and phoenixes, resembling Liangzhu culture artifacts. At Tanjialing, over 250 jade pieces were found in five tombs, showcasing advanced carving techniques surpassing those of Liangzhu and Hongshan. One male burial included 99 pottery jars. Early copper objects, the southernmost in Neolithic China, were also found at Dengjiawan.\nDecline\nBy 2000 BC, fortifications were no longer maintained, and the population declined significantly, possibly due to warfare with the expanding Longshan culture, flooding, or collapse of social order. A severe drought around 4200 cal BP eroded the economic foundation of rice cultivation. Unlike the abrupt collapse of the Liangzhu culture, Shijiahe experienced a gradual decline.\nGallery\nFile:Neolithic Shijiahe Culture Jade Plaque.jpg|Jade plaque with face\nFile:Neolithic Shijiahe Culture Jade Bird.jpg|Jade bird\nFile:Shijiahe Culture Jade Pendant.jpg|Jade pendant\nFile:Shijiahe Neolithic Jade Artifacts.jpg\nFile:Cernuschi Neolithic jades.jpg\nFile:Characters from Shijiahe Culture, Hubei (10185323866).jpg|Markings of pottery\nFile:Shijiahe Culture Pottery Animals (10161384623).jpg|Pottery animals\nFile:Shijiahe Culture Pottery Animals (10161387663).jpg|Pottery animals\nFile:Shijiahe clay animals, bear and monkey.jpg|Clay figurines: bear and monkey\nFile:Shijiahe clay figurine of a hen.
