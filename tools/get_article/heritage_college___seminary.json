It is affiliated with the Fellowship of Evangelical Baptist Churches in Canada.\nHistory\nCentral Baptist Seminary was itself formed out of a split in fundamentalist Baptist ranks when, in 1948, firebrand Baptist leader Thomas Todhunter Shields, then head of the Union of Regular Baptist Churches of Ontario and Quebec, dismissed Dean W. Gordon Brown from his seminary.  Brown and 50 students then went on to begin a new seminary holding more moderate positions under the direction of President Jack Scott.  The first number of years the seminary was housed at Forward Baptist Church in Toronto, Ontario. In 1950, the seminary acquired a new building at 225 St. George Street, Toronto. In its formative years, CBS provided undergraduate and graduate theological education until the mid-1980s.  In later years the seminary was moved to Gormley, Ontario (north of Toronto).\nLondon Baptist Seminary began in 1976 in London, Ontario. The school provided undergraduate and graduate theological education. In 1981, the school's name changed to London Baptist Bible College and London Baptist Seminary (LBBC & LBS). In 1991, the Ontario legislature officially recognized the seminary as a degree-granting institution through the passage of \"An Act to Incorporate the Heritage Baptist College and Heritage Theological Seminary, 1991, 1991\".\nHeritage was founded in 1993 through the merger of the former London Baptist Bible College and Seminary of London, Ontario and Central Baptist Seminary of Toronto, Ontario.\nAdministration\nHeritage College and Seminary is governed by a Board of Governors composed of distinguished Christian leaders from across Ontario. Heritage has adopted a Carver Policy Governance model for the Board of Governors and the institution.
