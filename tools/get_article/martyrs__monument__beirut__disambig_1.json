It is located at what is now known as Martyrs' Square in the heart of downtown Beirut, Lebanon. It was created by Italian sculptor Marino Mazzacurati, and inaugurated in 1960.\nHistory\n- Martyrs Square statue (1930)]]\nIn 1930, during the French Mandate, the first commemorative sculpture was erected on the square in memory of Lebanese nationalists who were hanged during World War I by the order of Ottoman military ruler Djemal Pasha. The original monument (right) by Youssef Hoyek represented two women, a Muslim and a Christian, holding hands in a symbolic gesture over an urn that represented their martyred children' ashes. Hoyek carved on their chests stylized shahada (لا إله إلا الله) and a small cross respectively.\nIn 1956, President Camille Chamoun laid the foundation stone of a monument. It would have consisted of an arch soaring over an obelisk, but the monument was never completed.\nThe current four-meter-high statue of the Martyrs that adorns the square was created by Italian artist Marino Mazzacurati and cast at Ahmad & Saeddine Abbas Foundry in the Saifi district. It was inaugurated by President Fouad Chehab in 1960.\nDue to damage inflicted during the Civil War (1975-1990), the Martyrs’ monument was dismantled in 1996 and restored by the Holy Spirit University of Kaslik. The restoration intentionally preserved the marks of the war damage.\nTimeline\n* 1930: First commemorative sculpture was erected on Martyrs' Square in memory of Lebanese nationalists hanged during World War I by the Ottomans.\n* 1956: President Camille Chamoun laid foundation stone of monument designed by Sami Abdel Baki which was never completed.\n* 1960: President Fouad Chehab inaugurated the new sculpture of the Martyrs' Monument, designed by Marino Mazzacurati.\n* 1996: Monument was dismantled and restored by the Holy Spirit University of Kaslik.\nPictures\nFile:Place des martyrs, Beirut, Monument 2016 collage.jpg|Details of the monument\nFile:Place des martyrs, Beirut, Monument 2016 5.jpg\nFile:Place des martyrs, Beirut, Monument 2016 4.jpg\nFile:Place des martyrs, Beirut, Monument 2016 3.jpg\nFile:Place des martyrs, Beirut, Monument 2016 2.jpg\nSee also\n* Jamal Pasha\n* Youssef Hoyek\n* Marino Mazzacurati\n* Holy Spirit University of Kaslik\n* Lebanese Civil War\nReferences\n* Kassir, Samir (2003) Histoire de Beyrouth, Fayard, Paris.\n* Sassine Farès et Tuéni, Ghassan (direction) (2003) El-Bourj.
