It detects, analyzes, and locates directions of laser emissions from laser guidance systems and laser rangefinders. Then it alerts the crew and can start various countermeasures, like smoke screen, aerosol screen (e.g. Shtora), active laser self-defence weapon with laser dazzler (LSDW, used on the Chinese Type 99 main battle tank), laser jammer, etc.\nDetectors used in LWR are usually based on a semiconductor photodetector array, which is typically cryogenically or thermal-electric cooled. Sometimes avalanche photodiodes (APD), photoconductivity, photoelectromagnetic, or photodiffusion devices are used even without cooling. Some devices detect only the main beam of foreign lasers while others detect even scattered rays.\nProduced by\n;\n:* Thales Optronics\n;\n:* Hensoldt\n;\n:* Elbit Systems\n;\n:* Global Industrial Defence Solutions\n;\n:* Hanwha Systems\n;\n:* ASELSAN\n:* NERO Industry\n;\n:* BAE Systems\nModels\nSome models used by US are listed:\n*  AN/AVR-2 and AN/AVR2A\n*  AN/AAR-47\n* AN/VVR-1\n* AN/VVR-2\nSee also\n* Radar warning receiver\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.aselsan.com.tr/en/capabilities/electro-optic-systems/air-platforms/lias-laser-warning-receiver-system ASELSAN LİAS for Airborne Platforms]\n* [https://www.aselsan.com.tr/en/capabilities/electro-optic-systems/naval-platforms/lis-laser-warning-receiver-system ASELSAN LİS for Naval Platforms]\n* [https://www.aselsan.com.tr/en/capabilities/electro-optic-systems/main-battle-tank-and-infantry-fighting-vehicle-sighting-applications/tlus-laser-warning-receiver-system ASELSAN TLUS for Ground Platforms]\n* [http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/equip/an-avr-2.htm AN/AVR-2 LWS at fas] (airborne)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110311111546/http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Electro-Optic-Systems/Goodrich-AN-VVR-1-Laser-Warning-Receiver-System-LWRS-United-States.html Goodrich AN/VVR-1 Laser Warning Receiver System (LWRS)]\n* [http://www.janes.com/extracts/extract/jeos/jeos9016.html Goodrich AN/VVR-2 Laser Warning Receiver System (LWRS)] (land laser warner)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081104075342/http://www.eagleshore.com/rsc/lwr.htm High-speed FT Spectrometer for Laser Warning Receivers]\n* [http://blockyourid.com/~gbpprorg/mil/laser Battlefield Laser Warning Receiver] Homebrew laser warning receiver"
