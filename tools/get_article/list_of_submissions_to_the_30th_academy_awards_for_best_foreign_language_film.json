The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film was created in 1956 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to honour non-English-speaking films produced outside the United States. The award is handed out annually, and is accepted by the winning film's director, although it is considered an award for the submitting country as a whole. Countries are invited by the Academy to submit their best films for competition according to strict rules, with only one film being accepted from each country.\nFor the 30th Academy Awards, twelve films were submitted in the category Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Documentary Torero, which represented Mexico, failed to get an Oscar nomination in the Foreign Language Film category, but was nominated for the Best Documentary Feature. Denmark's Annelise Hovmand became the first female director to have a film in the running at the submission stage. The five nominated films came from France, India, Italy, Norway and West Germany.\nItaly won for the fifth time with Nights of Cabiria by Federico Fellini, marking the second year in a row he received the prize.\nSubmissions\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
