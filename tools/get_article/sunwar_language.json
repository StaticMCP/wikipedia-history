It was first comprehensively attested by the Himalayan Languages Project. It is also known as Kõits Lo ( ; ), Kiranti-Kõits ( ; ), and Mukhiya ( ; ).\nThe Sunuwar language is one of the smaller members of the Tibeto-Burman language family. About 40,000 speakers are residing in eastern Nepal.\nNames\nThe language is commonly known as Koic, for many ethnic Sunuwar speakers also refer to the language as “Sunuwar, Koinch , Koinch or Koincha (कोइँच); Kõits Lo (कोइँच लो), Kiranti-Kõits (किराँती-कोइँच) or Mukhiya (मुखिया).”\nMoreover, most Sunwar speakers have the surname (सुनुवार), Sunuvār in Latin script.\nGeographic distribution\nThe Sunuwar language is commonly spoken in a cluster of Sunuwar villages, located around the region of the core spoken language. These villages are scattered alongside the river banks of Likhu Khola, in two bordering central-eastern districts of Nepal, distant from the main Nepalese road system: in the Okhaldhū۠ngā District (part of Koshi Province), around the village of Vacul; and in the Rāmechāp District (part of Bagmati Province), around the villages of Pahare and of Kũbhu Kãsthālī for a smaller group of Sunwar speakers. The majority of the Sunwar speakers live on the southern border area of this region, between the villages of Pahare and Vacul.\nLocated 1,800 meters above sea level, their fields aren’t all fallow from year round cultivation (Borchers, 2008). Therefore, many Sunwar households are farmers, own a small lot of land and livestock. Moreover, each village often visits their neighboring village markets to purchase inaccessible goods such as spices, sugar, tea, and salt. In the winter, they experience no snow but freezing temperatures. In warmer weather, they experience a lot of rainfall, in the summer, monsoon rainfall. Especially between June and August, it is when they experience the most rain, more so monsoon rainfall.\nAccording to Borchers, there are other villages located outside of the core region. The Surel are claimed to be Sunwar speakers however there are no certainties that it is true.\nWritten language\nSunuwar (or Koĩts) native alphabet in Nepal & Sikkim, India\nSunuwar speakers from Nepal and Sikkim, northeastern India, use the Sunuwar alphabet (ISO 15924 script code: Sunu) for printed materials such as newspapers and literature. The alphabet, also known as Sunuwar alphabet, Sunuwar Lipi, Koĩts Lipi, was promoted in 1932 by Karna Bahadur Sunuwar (1926-1991), and got official recognition in Sikkim and Eastern Nepal where it is taught in schools. The Sunuwar script, is unrelated to any other scripts (even if some letter shapes have some resemblance to Latin and Limbu letter forms with similar phonetic value), and behaves like an alphabet with 35 base letters, written left-to-right, with syllabic features, extended with combining diacritics. The script also features its own set of decimal digits.\nUnlike other Indic scripts derived from Brahmic, the Sunuwar alphabet includes no combining vowel signs: the script was initially a pure alphabet and the base consonants initially did not have any inherent vowel. But a second version of the script modified the orthographic rules to imply its presence, where the inherent vowel would be altered when appending any independent vowel letters, or suppressed by using a virama (or halant) sign in some consonant clusters or for consonants in final position of syllables. The independent letter form for the inherent vowel is now removed in most cases from the normal orthography in the middle of words, only used in isolation (i.e. no longer written when following a leading consonant, unless it is at end of words). A number of glyphic forms (conjuncts using consonants in half forms) were added to the script after this orthographic change for more easily writing consonant clusters, instead of writing multiple consonants with virama signs.\nDevanagari-based abugida for the Sunuwar language in Nepal\nAlthough Sunwar has no traditional written language in Nepal, most literate speakers use the Devanagari abugida, also used for writing Nepali.\n; Independent vowels and diphthongs\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n; Consonants with inherent vowel\n{| class=\"wikitable\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n; Combining diacritics\n: The sign ्, known in Sunuwar as sangmilu, represents a virama or halant; it is used to silent the inherent vowel after the consonant.\n: The sign ँ, known in Sunuwar as taslathenk, corresponds to the candrabindu in Devanagari; it is used to nasalize the vowel.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|्\n|ँ\n|-\n|sangmilu (virama or halant)\n|taslathenk (cadrabindu)\n|-\n|mutes the inherent vowel\n|indicates nasalization of the vowel\n|}\nTikamuli native abugida (since 2005)\nIn 2005, another syllabic alphabet or abugida was developed for Sunuwar; it is known as Tikamuli.\nPhonology\nSunwar phonology is significantly influenced by the language of Nepali.\nConsonants\nThe Sunwar language has a mid-sized arrangement of thirty-two consonantal phonemes:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n!

It is now heard as a plosive [] in the village of Saipu, and as an approximant [] in the village of Kũbhu. It is only heard rarely in word-initial position among the speakers of Saipu.\nVowels\nAccording to Borchers, there are eleven vowel phonemes in Sunwar:\n[a~ɑ], /ā / [aː], /e/ [e~ɛ], /i/ [i], /o/ [o], /u/ [u], / ū/ [uː~y], /ã/ [ã~ɑ̃], /ã̄/ [ãː], /ẽ/ [ẽ~ɛ̃], /ĩ/ [ĩ]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!\n!scope=\"col\"| Front\n!scope=\"col\"| Central\n!scope=\"col\"| Back\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| High\n| /i/ [i], /ū/ [y] /ĩ/ [ĩ]\n|\n| /ū/ [uː~y], /u/ [u]  (ũ)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Mid\n| /e/ [e~ɛ] /ẽ/ [ẽ~ɛ̃]\n|\n| /o/  [o]  (õ)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Low\n|\n| /a/ [a~ɑ], /ā / [aː] /ã/ [ã~ɑ̃], /ã̄/ [ãː]\n|\n|}\n* Vowels with bar - Represents long vowels\n* Vowels with tilde -  Represents short nasalized vowels\n* Vowels with bar and tilde - Represents long and nasalized vowels\nDiphthongs\nThere are a total of eight diphthongs in Sunuwar: /ai/ [aɪ], /aĩ/ [aɪ̃], /au/ [au], /eu/ [eu], /oi/ [oi], /oĩ/ [oĩ], /ui/ [ui], /uĩ/ [uĩ]\nAccording to Borchers, a principled way to distinguish diphthongs from a sequence of two monophthongs does not exist in the Sunwar language.\nAs exemplified by Borchers, this table consists of examples of contrasts between diphthongs:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|/joi/\n|[ɟoi]\n|‘tiger’\n|-\n|/joĩ/\n|[ɟoĩ]\n|‘younger sister’s husband’\n|-\n|/muicā/\n|[muicaː]\n|‘wear shoes’\n|-\n|/puĩcā/\n|[puĩcaː]\n|‘ask for, beg’\n|-\n|/goi/\n|[ɡoi]\n|‘you’\n|-\n|/gui/\n|[ɡui]\n|‘hand’\n|-\n|/reu/\n|[ɾeu]\n|‘rain’\n|-\n|/roi/\n|[ɾoi]\n|‘ill’\n|}\nSyllable structure\nSyllable Structure of Sunuwar: C(C)V(V)(C)(C)\nMorphology\nMarkers\nCase-marking suffixes\nAccording to Borchers, “all case markers in the Sunuwar language are suffixes.”\nAs exemplified by Borchers, this table consists of the noun case markers.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Morpheme:\n!Gloss:\n!Marks:\n!Occurs suffixed to denotions of:\n|-\n|\n-amī ~-ī\nm ~ -m\n|INS/L\nOC\n|agents, instruments, locations\n|persons,\nthings,\nlocations\n|-\n|\n-kal\n|OBJ\n|patients\n|persons,\nanimals\n|-\n|\n|POSS\n|possessions of animate beings\n|persons,\nanimals\n|-\n|\n|GEN\n|belongings of inanimate items\n|things,\nlocations\n|-\n|\n|FROM\n|place of departure of persons or items that changed places (ABL); time of begin of action\n|locations,\ntime\n|-\n|\n|FROM\n|place of departure of persons or items that changed places (ABL); time of begin of action\n|locations,\ntime\n|-\n|\n|VOC\n|name of person called\n|persons\n|}\nDual marker\nA dual marker can be associated with dual/pair or the cardinal number ‘two’.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Morpheme:\n|\n|-\n|Gloss:\n|Dual (DU)\n|}\nExample of dual marker by Borchers:\nPlural marker\nIn the Sunuwar language, both nouns and pronouns can be marked as dual or plural.\nIn addition items in a group can be marked plural.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Morpheme:\n|\n|-\n|Gloss:\n|Plural (PL)\n|}\nExamples of the plural marker used to point at items in a group by Borchers:\nAbsent marker\nAccording to Borchers, the Sunuwar language does not have a zero morpheme, but it can still indicate the number amount of something through verbal agreement markers or numerals.\nExample of the absent marker by Borchers:\nSuffixes\nPossessive suffix:  (Animate Agent)\nAccording to Borchers, the possessive suffix  is attached to a human or animate agent to indicate a possessive relationship.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Morpheme:\n|\n|-\n|Gloss:\n|Possessive (POSS)\n|}\nExamples of the possessive  by Borchers:\nPossessive suffix:  (inanimate subject)\nAccording to Borchers, inanimate subjects are marked with the possessive suffix  to indicate what it is \"made of\".\nExample of possessive  indicating what it is \"made of\" by Borchers:\nQuantifiers\nQuantifiers in the Sunwar language are loaned from Nepali.
