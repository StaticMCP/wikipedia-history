The Umaill, its early historical rulers, were renamed the Uí Briúin Umaill to claim a fictitious relationship with the Uí Briúin. By the 12th century the ruling family adopted the surname Ó Máille, and were reckoned with the Ó Dubhda, Ó Flaithbheartaigh and Mac Conraoi as supreme seafaring clans of Connacht.\nKings of Umaill\n* Flannabhra, died 773\n* Dunghal mac Flaithniadh, died 776\n* Aedhghal, died 779\n* Flathghal mac Flannbhrath, died 782\n* Cosgrach mac Flannbhrath, died 812\n* Cairbre mac Cinaedh, died 847\n* Gilla na nInghen Ua Cobhthaigh, died 1004\n* Domhnall Ua Máille, died 1176\n* Domnall Ruadh Ó Máille, died 11 November 1337\n* Owen Ó Máille, died 1362\n* Diarmuid mac Owen Ó Máille, died 1362\n* Donell Ó Máille, 1401 (''Donnell O'Malley, Lord of Umallia, died, after having attained to a good old age.)\n* Aodh Ó Máille, died 1415\n* Diarmaid Ó Máille, fl. 1415\n* Tadhg mac Diarmaid Ó Máille, died 1467\n* Eoghan, d. 1513\n* Cormac mac Eoghan Ó Máille, died 1523 (1523.
