The beverage is made in towns such as Paul on Santo Antao and Cidade Velha on Santiago using a trapiche. A variation of the drink is ponche (punch) which is sweeted with condensed milk or sugarcane molasses. Due to the intoxication on consuming grogue, it is consumed by many Cape Verdean musicians seeking inspiration.\nCorn and beans are staples of Cape Verdean cuisine. Also popular are rice, fried potatoes, cassava, and vegetables such as carrots, kale, squash and fish and meat such as tuna, sawfish, lobster, chicken, grilled pork and eggs. One legacy of the Portuguese on the islands is olives and Alentejo wines which are still imported. One type of Cape Verdean stew is a cachupa which includes mashed maize, onions, green bananas, manioc, sweet potatoes, squash and yams.\nLiterature\nCape Verdean literature is the richest of the African Lusophone nations. Cape Verdeans have written both in the Portuguese language and in Cape Verdean Creole. Eugénio Tavares was the first author who published poetry (Morna poems) in Creole. The rise of cultural, social, and political emancipation of Cape Verde in the 1930s was reflected in the literary reviews Claridade and Certeza, that published works from Cape Verdean authors like João Cleofas Martins, Luís Romano de Madeira Melo, Ovídio Martins, Jorge Barbosa, António Aurélio Gonçalves, Henrique Teixeira de Sousa and Baltasar Lopes da Silva (Osvaldo Alcântara).  After independence, there are modern writers such as Germano Almeida, Manuel Veiga, Arménio Vieira, Orlanda Amarílis and more.\nMusic\nMorna.]]\nCape Verde is known internationally for Morna, a form of folk music usually sung in the Cape Verdean Creole, accompanied by clarinet, violin, guitar and cavaquinho. The islands also feature native genres such as funaná, batuque, coladeira, and mazurka''. Cesária Évora is perhaps the best internationally known practitioner of morna. One of Cape Verde's most famous stars, on her death, one Cape Verdean restaurateur stated that she was \"more important than our flag\".\nCinema\nTheatre\nTheatre in Cape Verde was mainly religious (biblical scenes translated into popular theatre) until the end of the 19th century, when cultural societies appeared. Modern theatre arose around independence (1975), and received a great impulse by the establishment in 1995 of the theatre association Mindelact, which also organises an annual international theatre festival.\nGallery\nFile:Crafts of Cape Verde.jpg|Bonecas de pano\nFile:Handicraft Cape Verde.jpg|Handicraft made with coconut shells\nFile:Bindes.jpg|Big binde and small binde for making cuscuz\nSee also\n* Culture of Africa\n* Music of Cape Verde\n* Religion in Cape Verde\n;Culture by island:\n*Arts and culture in Santiago, Cape Verde\n*Arts and culture in São Vicente, Cape Verde\nReferences"
