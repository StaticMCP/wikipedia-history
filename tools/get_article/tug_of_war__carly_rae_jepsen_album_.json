It is produced by Canadian record producer and songwriter Ryan Stewart. As of June 25, 2012, the album has sold 10,000 copies in Canada.\nBackground\nInitially, the album was limitedly released in Canada on the independent MapleMusic Recordings label via Fontana North on September 30, 2008. However, it was subsequently given a mainstream release by Canadian label 604 Records, following Jepsen's signing to the label in 2011, including a digital release on the iTunes Store of the United States on June 14. In 2013, the album was released on CD in the United States, through distribution from Alliance Entertainment. In July 2015, the album was released on vinyl in Europe.\nPromotion and release\nThe album's first promotional single, a cover of John Denver's song \"Sunshine on My Shoulders\", was released on the iTunes Store on June 16, 2008. The lead single, \"Tug of War\", was released on iTunes Store on September 16, 2008, and peaked at No. 36 on the Canadian Hot 100. The music video was released in January 2009. The second single \"Bucket\" peaked at No. 32 on the Canadian Hot 100, and samples the children's song, \"There's a Hole in My Bucket\" and its music video was released in May 2009. The third and final single from the album was \"Sour Candy\" which features Josh Ramsay of Marianas Trench on the single version. Ramsay also produced the latter song and is the only song on the album that was not produced by the album's main producer Ryan Stewart.\nCritical reception\n| rev2      = Sputnikmusic\n| rev2Score = 4.5/5\n}}\nChris True of AllMusic noted that the album established Jepsen's presence in the Canadian pop scene following her appearance on Canadian Idol, where she placed third. He highlighted the success of \"Sunshine on My Shoulders\", as well as original tracks like \"Tug of War\" and \"Bucket,\" both of which became hits in Canada. True also credited the album's material with helping Jepsen earn multiple national award nominations, marking a strong start to her recording career.\nTrack listing\n| all_writing = Carly Rae Jepsen and Ryan Stewart and produced by Ryan Stewart, except where noted\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n| total_length = 31:31\n| title1   = Bucket\n| length1  = 2:51\n| title2   = Tug of War\n| length2  = 3:44\n| title3   = Money and the Ego\n| length3  = 3:10\n| title4   = Tell Me\n| length4  = 2:20\n| title5   = Heavy Lifting\n| length5  = 3:41\n| title6   = Sunshine on My Shoulders\n| length6  = 3:35\n| writer6  =\n| title7   = Worldly Matters\n| length7  = 3:21\n| title8   = Sweet Talker\n| length8  = 2:56\n| title9   = Hotel Shampoos\n| length9  = 2:52\n| title10  = Sour Candy\n| length10 = 3:01\n| writer10 =\n| extra10  = Ramsay\n}}\n| total_length = 31:32\n| title10  = Sour Candy\n| note10   = featuring Josh Ramsay\n| length10 = 3:02\n}}\n| total_length = 40:15\n| title11  = I Still Wonder\n| note11   = Acoustic\n| length11 = 1:40\n| title12  = Tug of War\n| note12   = Dave \"Rave\" Ogilvie Remix\n| length12 = 4:02\n| title13  = Sour Candy\n| note13   = featuring Josh Ramsay\n| length13 = 3:02\n}}\nPersonnel\nCredits were adapted from AllMusic.\n* Carly Rae Jepsen – lead vocals\n* Ryan Stewart – banjo, bass guitar, clapping, drum programming, drums, guitar, keyboards, percussion, sound effects, vocals, production, engineering, mixing\n* Josh Ramsay – bass guitar, drums, guitar, keyboards, background vocals, production, engineering\n* João Carvalho – mastering\n* Rico Amezquita – cover photo, photography\n* Mario Vaira – design, photography\nRelease history\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|+ Tug of War release history\n!
