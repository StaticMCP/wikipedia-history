It was first colonized by Italy in 1890 and remained an Italian colony until 1941, when British forces took control during World War II. From 1941 to 1952, Eritrea was administered as a British protectorate before being federated with Ethiopia in 1952 under a United Nations resolution. In 1962, Ethiopia formally annexed Eritrea, leading to a decades-long struggle for independence, which was finally achieved in 1993.\nThis article provides a list of the colonial governors until 1991.\nList of Provincial, Colonial and Federal Heads of Eritrea\n(Dates in italics indicate de facto continuation of office.)\nList of rulers\nList of Ottoman governors of Egypt (1517–1805)\n*List of Ottoman governors of Egypt\nList of monarchs of the Muhammad Ali dynasty (1805–1914)\nList of Grand Viziers of Egypt (1857–1878)\n* Zulfiqar Pasha (1857–1858) (1st term)\n* Mustafa Naili (1858–1861)\n* Zulfiqar Pasha (1861–1864) (2nd term)\n* Raghib Pasha (1864–1866) (1st term)\n* Muhammad Sharif Pasha (1866–1867) (1st term)\n* Raghib Pasha (1867–1868) (2nd term)\n* Muhammad Sharif Pasha (1868–1872) (2nd term)\n* Nubar Pasha (1872)\n* Muhammad Tawfiq Pasha (1872–1878)\n{|\n|}\nHabesh Eyaleti (Ottoman Province of Habesh) / Massawa Province\nWali = Governor\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"text-align:left\"\n!
