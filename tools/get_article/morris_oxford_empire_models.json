In 1923 they with the Cowley cars were 28.1 per cent of British private car production. In 1925 Morris sold near double the number and they represented 41 per cent of British production. The model name was recycled in 1948 and lasted almost another 23 years through to 1971 but in this time the market sector and engine-size remained nearly constant between 1476 cc and 1622 cc.\nAside from the Oxford Sixes and these Oxford Empire models all Oxfords since 1918 have been 12 or 14 HP cars of about 1500 to 1800 cc..\n__TOC__\nOxford 15.9\n*track\n| length = *\n| width = *\n| height = *\n* = \"shipping dimensions\"\n| weight =  tourer\n| predecessor = none\n| successor = Oxford 16/40\n| sp = uk\n}}\n| bore          = *\n| stroke        =\n| block         = cast-iron3-bearing crankshaftpistons: aluminium alloycrankshaft: three bearings connecting rods: duralumin\n| head          = cast-iron detachable\n| valvetrain    = side by side valves, camshaft (with dynamo and magneto) driven by spiral gearing from crankshaft\n| compression   =\n| supercharger  =\n| turbocharger  =\n| fuelsystem    = Smith carburettor, scuttle tank filled from rear by Autovac\n| management    =\n| fueltype      = petrol\n| oilsystem     = forced feed throughout\n| coolingsystem = water, impeller for circulationassisted by 4-blade fanhoneycomb radiator\n| power         = not published\n* tax rating 15.87hp\n| specpower     =\n| torque        =\n| length        =\n| width         =\n| height        =\n| diameter      =\n| weight        =\n}}\nThe 2½-litre Oxford 15.9 Empire model was displayed as \"a Colonial Chassis\" at the Olympia Motor Show of October 1926. A complete car was on display at nearby main dealers.\nThe standard coachwork is a four or five seater body with four doors. The driving seat, the rake of the steering, the positioning of the clutch and brake pedals are all adjustable. Gears are controlled by a central flexible lever operating in a visible gate and there is a catch for reverse.\nBrakes suspension steering\nSteering is carried out through a worm and complete wheel in a box screwed to the frame. New gear positions are available at a low price. The brake pedal operates internally expanding brakes on all four wheels, the handbrake operates at the back using separate shoes. The brake drums are enclosed. Standard fittings include a spare (steel artillery) wheel and tyre. Shock absorbers are provided. There are semi-elliptic springs all round, flat set at the front. The rear springs are underhung. Cross-braced by three direct members the chassis channel-section side members are narrowed at the front and rise over the back axle\nEmpire size ground-clearance\nThe car can be driven safely through 20 inches, 510&nbsp;mm, of water. The ground clearance is 10¼ inches, 260&nbsp;mm. A full 11 inches, 278&nbsp;mm, is allowed at the forward running board bracket cross stay. This clearance is now greater than on many American cars. This \"falsifies hostile propaganda to the contrary\".\nEquipment includes dipping headlamps for use during fog and to prevent dazzle of other motorists controlled by a lever on the right of the driver.\nThe motoring correspondent of The Times reported as follows. The car is well finished for £375. For export the finish might be cheaper with less nickel inside. There were draughts at the bottom of the rear doors. The brakes were effective but might respond more quickly. The change-speed was delightful to handle and there could be no complaints about the clutch action. The comfortable maximum is about 55&nbsp;mph.\nThe chassis alone costs £245, the five-seated tourer £325.\nThe following summer this price was dropped £20. No change was made to Morris's catalogue of the 15.9 for the October 1927 Motor Show Morris's 17.7&nbsp;hp Light Six was first shown at this 1927 Show.\nThis Oxford 15.9 was replaced by another four cylinder Oxford, Oxford 16/40.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n! }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\nThe website of the International Alliance of Morris owners explains that this car was designed by Morris-Commercial, the part of Morris's empire that made commercial vehicles and their engines and Morris gearboxes and back axles. This 15.9&nbsp;hp Morris-Commercial engine was intended for a truck.\nOxford 16/40\nA new version was announced in September 1928 given a new name before the announcement of the 15.9 horsepower Oxford Six. There were minor improvements of appearance but this was no more than a 15.9 with a new name.\nThis 16/40 was replaced by Oxford Six 15.9&nbsp;hp.\nReferences\nFootnotes\nBibliography\n*"
