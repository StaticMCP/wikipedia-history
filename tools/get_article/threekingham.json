The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 233.   It is situated on the  A52 Grantham to Boston road,  south from Sleaford, and close to the A15 Threekingham Bar roundabout. Mareham Lane, the Roman Road aligned with King Street, crosses the A15 at Threekingham.\nHistory\nThe name of the town means \"home of Tric's people.\" Tric is a Brittonic personal name, though it is unclear whether Tric himself was a Briton or whether he was descended from Anglo-Saxon migrants but given a name borrowed from Celtic speakers who possibly lived nearby. Either way, Threekingham itself is a Germanic name, given by speakers of Old English.\nA folk etymology that developed in the later part of the Anglo-Saxon period derives the name from \"home of the three kings,\" supposedly because three Danish kings were buried there; however, this is incorrect.\nThreekingham parish church is dedicated to St. Peter ad Vincula (St Peter in chains). The village public house is the Three Kings Inn.\nThe Domesday Book of 1086 records two churches in Threekingham; St Peter and St Mary. The church of St Mary was at Stow Green. Funerary remains have been found at Stow Green date back to the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and the church survived until the eighteenth century. It is possible that it was the site of an Early Medieval nunnery, founded in the late seventh century by St Werburgh and dedicated to St Ætheldreda. It was probably destroyed by the Danes c.870.\nHistorian David Roffe describes St Ætheldreda's connection with Stow Green, saying the site, called \"Ædeldreðestowe,\" was chosen because the saint's staff reportedly took root and sprouted leaves there.\n'Stow' is well known to be a place name denoting a holy place, or a burial place. According to Eilert Ekwall, \"Old English 'stow' is recorded in senses such as 'place', 'inhabited place', 'holy place, hermitage, monastery', probably 'church'.\"\nThe Medieval Stow Fair was held nearby, less than  to the south. It is possible that it was the site of the early medieval nunnery founded in the late seventh century by Saint Werburh, dedicated to Saint Æthelthryth, and probably destroyed by the Danes c.&nbsp;870.\nThere are ancient earthworks and a mound called Threekingham Beacon to the west of the village.  The post-medieval garden features overlie much older earthworks and tumuli.  The remains of a moated manor house are in Hall Lane.\nThere is a [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/147415 Whalebone Arch] marking the entrance to Laundon Hall.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.threekingham.org.uk Village website]\n* [http://www.stanlaundon.com/laundon.html Laundon - a little family background], Stanlaundon.com"
