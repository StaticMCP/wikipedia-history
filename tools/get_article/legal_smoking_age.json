In Mexico, Uruguay and cannabis-legal jurisdictions in the United States, the legal age to possess or purchase cannabis is identical to the tobacco purchase age (18 in Mexico and Uruguay and 21 in the United States). In Canada, the legal age to possess or purchase cannabis is 19 in all provinces and territories except Alberta (18) and Quebec (21). There are therefore three Canadian provinces (Manitoba, Quebec and Saskatchewan) and two territories (the Northwest Territories and Yukon) where the age to purchase tobacco is lower than the age to possess and purchase cannabis, and one province (Prince Edward Island) where the tobacco purchase age is higher. Prior to December 2019, when the United States raised its tobacco purchase age to 21 in all states and territories, several U.S. states had tobacco purchase ages lower than their cannabis possession and purchase ages. In Germany, the legal age to possess and purchase cannabis is 18.\nEnforcement\nTo reduce illegal sales, active enforcement is more effective than giving retailers information. The retailer compliance with legislation can be assessed by test purchasing.\nSee also\n* Age of candidacy\n* Legal drinking age\n* Legality of cannabis\n* List of smoking bans\n* Mature minor doctrine\n* National Youth Rights Association\n* Youth rights\n* Youth suffrage\nReferences"
