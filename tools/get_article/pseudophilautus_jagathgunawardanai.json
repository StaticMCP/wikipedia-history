It is one of the 8 species of rhacophorids that was discovered from Adam's Peak in 2013.\nScientists have seen it in exactly one place: Sripada Peak between 1600 and 1750 meters above sea level.\nThis frog lives in cloud forests. It has been observed from ground level to as high as 6 m up in the trees. It prefers trees with lichen on the bark.\nThe adult female frog measures 35.8 – 40.4&nbsp;mm long in snout-vent length.
