Separate rankings were published by the Associated Press (AP) and the United Press International (UPI). The AP rankings were selected by a board of sports writers, and the UPI rankings were selected by a board of small-college coaches.\nThe 1964 Wittenberg Tigers football team (8–0), led by senior quarterback Charlie Green, was selected as the small-college national champion by the AP. The 1964 Cal State Los Angeles Diablos football team (9–0) was selected as the small-college champion by the UPI and rated No. 3 by the AP. Prairie View (9–0) was recognized as the black college national champion and rated at No. 2 by the AP and No. 8 by the UPI.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n|
