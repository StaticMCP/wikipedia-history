He also served as a U.S. lawyer, politician and author.\nBiography\nBorn in Portland, Maine, King graduated from  Dickinson College in 1858, studied law, and was admitted to the bar in New York City in 1861. He served in the armies of the Potomac and Shenandoah during the Civil War from August 1862 until May 1865, when he resigned with the rank of brevet colonel.\nKing earned the Medal of Honor for service near Dinwiddie Courthouse, Virginia, on March 31, 1865.\nKing then practiced law until 1870, when he became connected with the press. He was the author of The Plymouth Silver Wedding (New York, 1873); The Brooklyn Congregational Council (1876); ''King's Guide to Regimental Courts-Martial (1882); and edited Proceedings of the Army of the Potomac'' (1879–'87).\nIn 1883, King was appointed judge-advocate-general of New York.\nAt a time during which anti-Chinese views were common, King was socially friendly with the Chinese minister in Washington, D.C., and the Chinese consul in New York.  In 1893, when the anti-Chinese Geary Act was ruled constitutional, he protested the law, saying that \"from the prejudice manifested against the Chinese, it seems they have no rights here that Americans are bound to respect.\"\nIn 1895, he ran on the Democratic ticket for Secretary of State of New York, but was defeated by Republican John Palmer.\nIn 1912, he ran on the Progressive ticket for New York State Comptroller, but was defeated by Democrat William Sohmer.\nKing was a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and the Sons of the American Revolution.
