Mining in the area quickly drove out the Tagalaka people indigenous to the area. Croydon was a large pastoral holding owned by Alexander Brown and Margaret Chalmers that covered an area of approximately , when first settled in the 1880s. The town's name is derived from a pastoral run name, that was used by their sons, Alexander Brown and William Chalmers Brown, pastoralists; William Chalmers Brown was born in Croydon, England in 1841 and is buried at Toowong cemetery in Brisbane.  Gold was discovered in 1885 and by 1887, the town's population had reached 7,000. Croydon Post Office opened on 20 March 1886.\nCroydon State School was established on 12 September 1889 but did not open until 7 July 1890.\nGold was to be the main economic production of the area for four decades. The Mining Warden left in 1926 as there were too few miners left on the field. During its heyday, Croydon was the fourth largest town in the colony of Queensland.\nChinese settlers moved into the Croydon area soon after the gold discovery was reported in 1885. From the earliest days of settlement they played a significant role in the viability of the isolated field by supplying fresh vegetables and fruit. They also supported the work of the miners as cooks, carriers and by working on tribute. The Chinese settlement at Croydon developed on the north west fringe of the town. This was a similar pattern to other mining towns in north Queensland. The community constructed a temple, houses and associated facilities such as pig ovens, with the temple as the central focus of the settlement.\nIn 1917, Dr. Elkington, Director of the Division of Tropical Hygiene, Commonwealth Department of Health, was concerned about health and hygiene of its growing population, contemplated conducting a statistical and social survey of the town, which did not eventuate. Elkington's interest in sociological surveys of gathering social and economic details on a population later developed into the 1924 Sociological Survey of White Women conducted from the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Townsville.\nCurrently, Croydon has a much smaller population, having greatly decreased following the end of the gold rush. The population is now a few hundred people. The town is one of the termini for the Gulflander railway, opened for the gold rush in 1891 but now a tourist railway operated by Traveltrain. In early 2009, the close proximity of a receding cyclone ex-Cyclone Charlotte, caused torrential rain and Croydon to be flooded. An estimated $5 million of damage was made to town infrastructure.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Croydon and surrounding areas had a population of 312 people.\nIn the , the locality of Croydon had a population of 258 people.\nIn the , the locality of Croydon had a population of 215 people.\nHeritage listings\nCroydon has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* Croydon: Homeward Bound Battery and Dam\n* Gulf Developmental Road: Content Mine\n* Gulf Developmental Road: Richmond Mine and Battery\n* Helen Street: Croydon railway station\n* Julia Creek Road: Croydon Cemetery\n* Normanton (Gulf Developmental) Road: Golden Gate Mining and Town Complex\n* Normanton Road: Station Creek Cemetery\n* Normanton to Croydon: Normanton to Croydon railway line\n* Off Gulf Developmental Road: Chinese Temple and Settlement Site\n* Samwell Street: Court House\n* Samwell Street: Croydon Shire Hall (formerly Croydon Town Hall)\n* Samwell Street: Police Station\n* Sircom Street: Croydon Hospital Ward\n* Tabletop Cemetery\n* West of the railway station: Old Croydon Cemetery\nEducation\nCroydon State School is a government primary (Early Childhood to Year 6) school for boys and girls at 22–30 Brown Street ().
