They created a large window for St Stephen Coleman Street, London. James Henry Nixon worked on the restoration of the famous medieval stained glass at St. Neots in Cornwall as early as 1829. The firm became a favourite of Charles Winston, which helped them gain prestigious commissions like the east window of Lincoln Cathedral.  In 1857 Nixon died and his pupil, Henry Hughes, became the partner of Thomas Ward, and the business was renamed Ward and Hughes. Henry Hughes died on the 17th February 1883 and was buried in a family vault (no.14843) on the western side of Highgate Cemetery.\nT. F. Curtis took over the firm and continued production as T. F. Curtis, Ward and Hughes until the late 1920s.\nWorks by Ward and Hughes\nIn England:\n* St. Michael's Church, Sowton, Devon\n* Church of the Good Shepherd, Brighton, East Sussex\n* St. Mary's Church, Kingsclere, Hampshire\n* Church of St. Peter & St. Andrew, Blofield, Norfolk\n* St. Peter's Church, Bramerton, Norfolk\n* St. Andrew's Church, Buxton, Norfolk\n* St. Mary's Church, Colkirk, Norfolk\n* St. Margaret's Church, Drayton, Norfolk\n* St. Peter's Church, Dunton, Norfolk\n* All Saints' Church, East Winch, Norfolk\n* St. Peter's Church, Ellingham, Norfolk (Naomi and Ruth)\n* St. Margaret's Church, Felthorpe, Norfolk\n* All Saints' Church, Filby, Norfolk\n* St. Martin's Church, Hindringham, Norfolk (martyrdom of St. Martin)\n* St. Mary the Virgin Church, Staverton, Northamptonshire\n* St. John the Evangelist's Church, Essington, South Staffordshire\n* St. Mary's Church, Billingshurst, West Sussex\n* St. James' Church, Draycot Cerne, Wiltshire\n* Salisbury Cathedral, Salisbury, Wiltshire\nIn Scotland:\n* St Peter's Scottish Episcopal Church, Musselburgh, East Lothian\nSee also\n* Stained glass - British glass, 1811-1918\n* Victorian Era\n* Gothic Revival\nReferences\nExternal links"
