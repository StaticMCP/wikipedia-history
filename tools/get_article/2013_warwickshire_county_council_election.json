The electoral divisions were the same as those used at the previous election in 2009. The election saw the Conservative Party lose overall control of the council.\nAll locally registered electors (British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) who were aged 18 or over on Thursday 2 May 2013 were entitled to vote in the local elections. Those who were temporarily away from their ordinary address (for example, away working, on holiday, in student accommodation or in hospital) were also entitled to vote in the local elections, although those who had moved abroad and registered as overseas electors cannot vote in the local elections. It is possible to register to vote at more than one address (such as a university student who had a term-time address and lives at home during holidays) at the discretion of the local Electoral Register Office, but it remains an offence to vote more than once in the same local government election.\nSummary\nThe Conservative Party lost overall control of the council, but remained the largest party. Council leader Alan Farnell lost his seat to Keith Kondakor of the Green Party, who won their first two county council seats at this election. The Stratford First Independents gained one seat, and an independent candidate gained another. The Labour Party achieved a net gain of 12 seats and the Liberal Democrats lost three, losing their position as the second largest party on the council. The next election is scheduled for 4 May 2017.\nResults\n|}\nCandidates\nThe parties with candidates who contested all 62 seats were the Conservative, Labour and Green parties.
