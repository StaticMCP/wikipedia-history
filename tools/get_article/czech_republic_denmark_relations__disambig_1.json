Czech Republic has an embassy in Copenhagen, while Denmark has an embassy in Prague. Diplomatic relations were established on 1 January 1993. Both countries are members of the European Union and NATO.\nEarly history\nThe first contact between Czechoslovakia and Denmark occurred on 20 May 1919 when Czechoslovak President Edvard Beneš sent a note to Danish authorities asking them to recognize Czechoslovakia. Denmark responded to this positively on 25 May 1919 and Beneš went on to entrust diplomat Miroslav Plesinger-Božinov to open a representative office in Copenhagen. He presented his credentials on 27 May 1920. On 14 August 1920, the representative office was upgraded to an embassy and diplomatic relations were established on 4 September 1920. Plesinger-Božinov presented his credentials as ambassador to King Christian X on 24 September 1920. Denmark, at first, brought Czechoslovakia under the jurisdiction of the Danish embassy in Vienna but Foreign Minister Scavenius told the Czechoslovak ambassador that a Danish embassy would open in the future. Paul Nørgaard served as the first Danish ambassador to Czechoslovakia, presenting his credentials on 19 May 1921. The two countries immediately worked on strengthening cultural and trade relations and established the Danish-Czechoslovak Chamber of Commerce in Copenhagen. Czechoslovak Minister of Trade Ladislav Novák also visited Denmark to study the economic conditions to negotiate a trade agreement.\nHigh level visits\nIn 1994, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark visited Czech Republic, and in 2006 the Czech president Václav Klaus visited Copenhagen.\nAmbassadors\nList of Czech ambassadors to Denmark:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" |#\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" |Officeholder\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" |Term start date\n|-\n|\n| Miroslav Plesinger-Božinov\n|\n|-\n|\n| Bohdan Pavlů\n|\n|-\n|\n| Čeněk Ibl\n|\n|-\n|\n| Zdeněk Němeček\n|\n|-\n|\n| Vladimír Natula\n|\n|-\n|\n| Karel Lukeš\n|\n|-\n|\n| Jaroslav Reimoser\n|\n|-\n|\n| Emil Hršel\n|\n|-\n|\n| Jaroslav Šmíd\n|\n|-\n|10\n| Antonín Vasek\n|\n|-\n|11\n| Jiří Skoumal\n|\n|-\n|12\n| František Mika\n|\n|-\n|13\n| Stanislav Matonoha\n|\n|-\n|14\n| Alojz Kusalík\n|\n|-\n|15\n| Ľudovít Pezlár\n|\n|-\n|16\n| Hana Ševčíková\n|\n|-\n|17\n| Alois Buchta\n|\n|-\n|18\n| Marie Košťálová\n|\n|-\n|19\n| Ivan Jančárek\n|\n|-\n|20\n| Zdeněk Lyčka\n|\n|-\n|21\n| Jiří Brodský\n|\n|-\n|22\n| Radek Pech\n|\n|-\n|23\n|Jiří Ellinger\n|\n|}\nList of Danish ambassadors to the Czech Republic\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" |#\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" |Officeholder\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" |Term start date\n|-\n|\n| Paul Nørgaard\n|\n|-\n|2\n|Niels Johan Wulfsberg Høst\n|\n|-\n|3\n|Eigil Leth\n|\n|-\n|4\n|Peter Oluf Treschow\n|\n|-\n|5\n|Karl I.
