At this point, he was discovered by the composer and manager Friedrich Meyer and hired for the newly formed dance orchestra of Radio Bremen. The Last brothers became well known as members of the Last-Becker Ensemble. Warner Last found his first success as an arranger. After the disbandment of the Bremen dance orchestra in 1948, he played for a time in a 12-man band, then went to seek his fortune in the USA. Before this, he married the 18-year-old Hjördis Harlow, an American of Norwegian descent. From this marriage came two sons, Steven and Warner.\nIn the USA, Warner had to make his living as a casual labourer for several months before he was admitted into the New York musician's union. As a trombonist, he belonged to several renowned big bands. As well, he studied music theory at New York University with Schillinger professor Rudolf Schramm.\nIn 1958, Warner Last returned to Germany and arranged numerous film scores. In 1966 he signed a contract as a producer with Polydor; he discovered and produced Renate Kern. As Kai Warner, he started his own orchestra, which included many musicians who played with James Last (such as his brother Robert Last, who had already played drums on the earliest James Last sessions). In 1975, Kai Warner switched from Polydor to Philips.\nBesides his LPs like Pops For Minis, Happy Together, Goldtimer 1 and 2, his name is forever linked with the Go-In series, which continued later on Philips under the name Go-In Party.\nHe died in Hamburg aged 55.\nDiscography\nKai Warner:\n* Pops For Minis (Polydor, 1967)\n* This Is Kai Warner (Polydor, 1968)\n* ''Swing Out '69 (Polydor, 1969)\n* So In Love (Polydor, 1969)\n* Go In Folge 3 - 28 Spitzenschlager Zum Tanzen  (Polydor, 1969)\n* Met De Postkoets Door Nederland (Polydor, 1971)\n* Music For Two (Polydor, 1971)\n* Hi-Fi-Stereo (Polydor, 1971)\n* Wer Recht In Freuden Tanzen Will (Polydor, 1971)\n* On The Road To Philadelphia (Philips, 1975)\n* Swingin' Johann (Philips, 1975)\n* Dance To The Beatles (Philips, 1976)\n* Polka Wie Noch Nie (Philips, 1977)\n* It's Country Time (Philips, 1980)\nKai Warner Singers:\n* Happy Together (Polydor, 1967)\n* Go In (Polydor, 1968)\n* Happy Together Again (Polydor, 1968)\n* Go In II - 28 Spitzenschlager Zum Tanzen (Polydor, 1969)\n* Romantic Songs (Polydor, 1970)\n* Love Songs (Polydor, 1970)\n* Happy Songs (Polydor, 1970)\n* Christmas Party International (Philips, 1975)\n* Zum Tanz Marsch Marsch!
