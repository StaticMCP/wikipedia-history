After a period as a comedy writer and performer he started penning scripts for popular television series such as The Bill and Kavanagh QC. His first major feature-length programme was Tough Love, a powerful drama about police corruption, starring Ray Winstone. He then wrote the drama for the highly acclaimed BBC drama-documentary Pompeii: The Last Day, which was nominated for a BAFTA, and followed this in 2005 with Supervolcano.\nHe branched out into novels in the same year, with the successful modern story [https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Buddha-Geoff-Me-Modern/dp/1844135683 The Buddha, Geoff and Me], which he followed in 2014 with [https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1846044294/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_1/277-3393517-4990152?pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe&pf_rd_r=0DVQSXRXQPTDJWC967AF&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_p=569136327&pf_rd_i=1844135683 Bodhisattva Blues]. Both books have Buddhist themes, as does [https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Buddha-Daily-Life-Introduction/dp/071267456X/ref=pd_sim_b_3?ie=UTF8&refRID=05NWWRWWMV07F39VCTKS The Buddha in Daily Life] (1988), which he ghostwrote for Richard Causton.\nIn 2006 Edward took a lead role in establishing the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Conflict Issues, which he ran until 2016. Between 2013 and 2017 he co-led a multinational civil-military project – [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understand-to-prevent-the-military-contribution-to-the-prevention-of-violent-conflictUnderstand to Prevent] – which developed guidance on an expanded role for the military in the prevention of violent conflict, and was a member of the Strategy Forum of the UK's Chief of the Defence Staff 2014–17.\nAnother book followed in 2018, [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Talking-Revolution-Creative-Conversation-Change/dp/1999837908 The Talking Revolution], written with Peter Osborn. The message of the book can be summed up in six words: 'Better Conversations, Better Relationships, Better Lives'.\nHe lives with his wife, Coralyn, in Hertfordshire near London, and has a son and a daughter, Alexander and Emily.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
