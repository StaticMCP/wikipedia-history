One of the group's first campaigns for loot and power was in the Mopti Region of central Mali, where Katibat Macina led by Amadou Koufa (one of the five groups making up JNIM) was most active. Thirty-six Malian soldiers in Youwarou a few weeks prior to the attack had defected from their post and fled to Bamako.\nAttack\nThe attack began at five o'clock in the morning, when unknown armed men attacked the Malian military camp in Youwarou. The battle lasted for several hours, with the Malian military releasing a statement that the military held control over the garrison.\nAftermath\nThe Malian government stated that two soldiers were killed and one was injured in the attack, with seven jihadists killed. Weapons and supplies were also alleged to have been captured.\nReferences"
