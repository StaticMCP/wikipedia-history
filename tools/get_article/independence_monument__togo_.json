It features a white bust of a woman holding up a cooking pot, in front of a silhouette of a figure holding up their arms as if they were breaking chains that shackled them together. The sides of the silhouette bear a number of inscriptions, including one which says in French: \"People of Togo, because of your faith and sacrifice, the Togolese nation was born.\" Another side bears the national motto and the following inscription: \"Proclamation of the independence of Togo, 27 April 1960. Work, Liberty, Homeland.\" It is located near the , which houses the Togo National Museum. Paul Ahyi, a renowned Togolese artist who designed the country's national flag, was a contributor to the monument.\nReferences"
