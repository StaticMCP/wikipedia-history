The current chairperson of the society is Teemu Väisänen.\nThe society publishes three peer-reviewed book series; Muinaistutkija, Fennoscandia archaeologica and Monographs of the Archaeological Society of Finland. In addition, the society organizes annual Archaeology Days, during which archaeologists from across Finland gather to hear about and discuss current topics and research related to their field. Between 2001 and 2015, the society published the contents of the presentations given at the event as collections of articles in a publication series titled Arkeologipäivät. In 2012, the society was involved in organizing the 18th EAA conference in Helsinki.\nIn addition to promoting research, the society improves archaeologists' working conditions, for example by drafting an equality and non-discrimination plan as well as ethical principles.
