McGinty, and built in 1896.  The building follows a rough H pattern, with a seven-story tower at the right front.  The building's walls are red brick, with granite trim elements.  The roof is slate, with copper flashing and two coppered cupolas.  The building cost $300,000 to build, a large sum for the time, and very nearly bankrupted the organization, which provided housing for homeless boys in exchange for a share of their wages.  The facility was managed by the Xaverian Brothers until the 1970s.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.  The property is now the campus of the Leventhal-Sidman Jewish Community Center.\nSee also\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Newton, Massachusetts\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.bostonjcc.org/Leventhal-Sidman-Jewish-Community-Center.aspx Leventhal-Sidman Jewish Community Center website]"
