He was a carrier pilot on the , based in Norfolk, when he was recruited for the American Volunteer Group, the official name of the Flying Tigers. The unit was formed with the financial backing of the Chinese government to help defend the Burma Road and Chinese cities from Japanese attack before the United States entered World War II.\nAt war\nOn December 10, 1941, Rector was part of a three-plane photo reconnaissance mission from Rangoon to Bangkok.  On December 20 when the Flying Tigers engaged in combat for the first time during a raid by Hanoi-based Japanese aircraft on the Chinese city of Kunming, Rector provided the American Volunteer Group with its first aerial victory and would later record the last in a long list of 23rd Fighter Group air-to-air kills. In May 1942, he played a critical role in locating and attacking Japanese military columns attempting a push into China at the Salween River Gorge. This allowed the Chinese time to blow up a key bridge across the river, and the Japanese subsequently retreated into Burma. Rector was credited with having destroyed 10.5 Japanese aircraft in aerial combat during the war.\nLater years\nRector retired from the United States Air Force in 1962 as a colonel and had a second career in the aviation industry as a consultant in India, North Africa, and Europe. He died April 26, 2001, at Walter Reed Army Medical Center after suffering a heart attack and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\nAwards and decorations\n{| style=\"margin:1em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|U.S. Air Force Command Pilot Badge\n|-\n|Silver Star\n|Legion of Merit\n|Distinguished Flying Crosswith bronze oak leaf cluster\n|-\n|Purple Heart\n|Air Medalwith bronze oak leaf cluster\n|Air Force Commendation Medal\n|-\n|Air Force Presidential Unit Citation\n|American Defense Service Medal\n|American Campaign Medal\n|-\n|Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medalwith two bronze campaign stars\n|World War II Victory Medal\n|National Defense Service Medalwith service star\n|-\n|Air Force Longevity Service Awardwith four bronze oak leaf clusters\n|Distinguished Flying Cross(United Kingdom)\n|Order of Yung Hui(5th class)(Republic of China)\n|-\n|Order of the Cloud and Banner(1st class)(Republic of China)\n|Army, Navy & Air Force Medal(Republic of China)\n|China War Memorial Medal(Republic of China)\n|}\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.76fsa.org/bio_rector.htm Biography on 76th Fighter Squadron web site]\n* [http://www.warbirdforum.com/vics.htm AVG Victory Credits] Including Ed Rector's 4.75 AVG air-to-air kills per Dr. Olynyk\n* [http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?MarkerID=75567 Colonel Edward F.
