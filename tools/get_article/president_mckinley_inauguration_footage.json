The two titles are President McKinley Taking the Oath and President McKinley and Escort Going to the Capitol. The two show President William McKinley arriving at the United States Capitol in order to take the oath of office of the president of the United States as part of his second inauguration on March 4, 1901.\nBoth were produced by the Edison Manufacturing Company, and in 2000 the United States Library of Congress deemed the two \"culturally significant\" and selected them for preservation in the National Film Registry.\nProduction\nEdison's crew shot the films on location on March 4, 1901, and released their footage less than two weeks later. The notes stated they had a camera and were \"within twenty feet of the President's carriage when it passed,\" giving the general public an unprecedentedly intimate view of a United States President. The crew captured their images on several campers placed on rudimentary tripods that made it difficult to pan or tilt while filming.\nThe cinematography is believed to have been the responsibility of Edwin S. Porter and James H. White.\nRelease\nPress accounts described the film receiving \"great applause\" and causing \"pandemonium\" during its screenings.\nSee also\n*Inauguration of the Australian Commonwealth, another early film (released January 1901) showing a national leader being sworn in.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*President McKinley Inauguration essay [https://www.loc.gov/static/programs/national-film-preservation-board/documents/mckinley.pdf] by Charles \"Buckey\" Grimm at National Film Registry\n*[http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mbrsmi/lcmp001.m1a04770 President McKinley Taking the Oath, Library of Congress]\n*[http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mbrsmi/lcmp001.m1a00989 President McKinley and Escort Going to the Capitol, Library of Congress]\n*\n*"
