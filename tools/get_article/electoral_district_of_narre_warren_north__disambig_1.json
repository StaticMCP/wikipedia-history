In the Labor landslide of that election, new Labor candidate Luke Donnellan overcame the notional majority to defeat Liberal MLC Maree Luckins, who had been attempting to switch to the Legislative Assembly. He was subsequently re-elected in 2006 and 2010, and again in 2014 after the 2013 redistribution slightly increased his majority. In December 2014, Donnellan was appointed Minister for Roads and Road Safety and Minister for Ports in the new Andrews Ministry after Labor's victory at the 2014 election. At the 2022 state election, Labor candidate Belinda Wilson was elected to the seat, following Donnellan's retirement.\nMembers for Narre Warren North\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Member!!Party!!Term\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n| Luke Donnellan\n| Labor\n| 2002–2022\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n| Belinda Wilson\n| Labor\n| 2022–present\n|-\n|}\nElection results\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.vec.vic.gov.au/electoral-boundaries/state-districts/narre-warren-north-district Electorate profile: Narre Warren North, Victorian Electoral Commission]"
