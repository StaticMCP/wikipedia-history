It is open to New Zealand writers of non-fiction, including educational material.\nHistory\nThe CLNZ Writers’ Award is an annual award for writers of non-fiction, including educational material.\nFunding for the Award comes from the Copyright Licensing New Zealand (CLNZ) Cultural Fund which gets its revenue from CLNZ's licensing activity in New Zealand. Copyright Licensing New Zealand (CLNZ) is a not-for-profit organisation that was set up in 1988 by the Book Publishers Association of New Zealand (BPANZ) which later became PANZ (Publishers Association of New Zealand). CLNZ is now jointly owned by PANZ and the New Zealand Society of Authors (NZSA).\nIn 2016, following consultation with the New Zealand writing community, the Award was re-launched to provide an award for one writer each year for the following three years.
