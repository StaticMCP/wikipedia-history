Heimskringla said Harald was massacring and burning his way through Trøndelag, without any opposition, until he came down to Orkdal. Here, King Gryting gathered a large group of men to make a stand against the invading forces. Harald was victorious and Gryting was taken prisoner while a large part of his army were killed. After this, Gryting and the whole of Orkdal subjected themselves to King Harald.\nReferences\n* Snorri Sturluson.
