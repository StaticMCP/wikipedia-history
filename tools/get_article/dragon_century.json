A series of murders is taking place around the world, and dragons suddenly begin appearing in the skies. The dragons are believed to be responsible for the murders, and the Japan Self-Defense Forces begins shooting them out of the sky. Following that, a troubled young girl named Riko witnesses the killing of a dragon, and takes charge of the creature's surviving hatchling. Naming the young dragon Carmine for his red scales, she hopes to raise him for the destruction of her city and the corrupt humanity she has come to hate. However, Riko learns there is more to the dragons than she first thought, and worse things in the world than her fellow humans.\nDevil Chapter R.C.297 Rulishia\n300 years after the events of Riko's story, Carmine is fully grown, and now lives alone in a tower in the post-apocalyptic world of 297 R.C. A 15-year-old girl named Rulishia comes to Carmine's tower and steals his horn, becoming (in accordance with dragon law) her master. She names him Vermillion, and takes him to a dragon-fighting tournament called the Ryuto. They win one victory after another, each fight taking Rulishia closer to revenge against the Ryuto team who killed both her father and his dragon. Rulishia and Vermillion grow closer, and she decides to call off her vendetta for his safety. The decision to seek a peaceful life is cut short with the return of the demons which invaded Earth 300 years before. After fighting off an attack by demonic beetles and destroying the demon-corrupted Ryuto team who killed Rulishia's father, Vermillion departs to do battle against the demons as a leader amongst the dragon warriors.\nVoice cast\nGod Chapter A.D.1990 Riko\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Character\n!
