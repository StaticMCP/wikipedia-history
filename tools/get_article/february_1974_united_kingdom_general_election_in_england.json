However, even in that election, Labour failed to win a majority of seats in England- it won just two seats more than the defeated Conservatives.\nResult Table\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Party\n!Seats won\n!Net change in seats\n!Total votes\n!Voteshare\n!Change in voteshare\n|-\n|Conservative\n|268\n|24\n|10,509,392\n|40.2%\n|8.1%\n|-\n|Labour\n|237\n|21\n|9,842,857\n|37.7%\n|5.7%\n|-\n|Liberal\n|9\n|7\n|5,575,031\n|21.3%\n|13.4%\n|}\n|51.93}}\n|45.93}}\n|1.74}}}}\nSee also\n* February 1974 United Kingdom general election\nReferences\nFurther references\n# Pilling, Sam; Cracknell, Richard (18 August 2021). \"UK Election Statistics: 1918-2021: A Century of Elections\" (PDF).
