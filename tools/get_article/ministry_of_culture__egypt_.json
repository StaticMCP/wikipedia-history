It was considered based on the French model, but also shaped by the experiments of various Eastern Bloc countries with centralized production and dissemination of culture. The ministry was renamed by President Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1958 as the Ministry of Culture and National Guidance.\nDuring president Anwar Sadat's regime, the ministry was renamed and restructured a number of times. In the first cabinet in October 1970 there was a Ministry of Culture, with Tharwat Okasha, and a separate Ministry for National Guidance with Mohamed Fayek. Within a month the minister of culture was replaced with Badraldin Abughazi, and the Ministry of National Guidance renamed as the Ministry of Information with the same minister. After a further few months in May 1971 Ismail Ghamem replaced Abughazi. In 1979 it was the Ministry of Culture and Information  (during Mansour Hassan's tenure).\nUnder the Mubarak regime it became the Ministry of State for Culture in 1982, with the information portfolio spun off into a separate ministry yet again.\nAffiliated agencies\n* Supreme Council of Culture\n* General Egyptian Book Organisation\n* National Library and Archives (Dar al-Kutub)\n* General Authority for Cultural Palaces\n* Cairo Opera House\n* Egyptian Arts Academy\n* Department of Applied Arts\n* The Fine Arts Sector\n* Cultural Development Fund\n* The Book and Publishing Commission\nEvents\nThe Ministry often sends delegations to participate in events.
