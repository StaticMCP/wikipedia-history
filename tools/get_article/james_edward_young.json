He was a founding member of the National Society of Black Physicists and a mentor for Shirley Ann Jackson.\nEarly life and education\nYoung was born on January 18, 1926 in Wheeling, West Virginia, in the United States. He attended Lincoln High School, a segregated school for African-American children of Ohio and Marshall counties, and graduated in 1941.\nYoung studied physics at Howard University, and earned his bachelor's degree in 1946. From 1946 to 1949, he was a physics instructor at the Hampton Institute, while working on a master's degree in physics at Howard.\nIn 1949, he joined Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a research assistant. In 1953, he earned a Ph.D. in physics, and his MIT dissertation was titled, “Propagation of Sound In Attenuating Ducts Containing Absorptive Strips.” He completed a one-year Post-doctoral Fellow in Acoustics at MIT in 1954.\nYoung's early research considered the propagation of noise in pipes. He was a member of Sigma Pi Sigma, Sigma Xi, and Beta Kappa Chi. After earning his PhD, Young joined the Los Alamos National Laboratory in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he began working on particle physics. He investigated pions and deuteron stripping theory.\nResearch and career\nYoung researched and taught theoretical particle physics, critical phenomena, and nuclear physics in the MIT Center for Theoretical Physics. He earned tenure in the Department of Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1969, and was the first black member of faculty to do so. He was interested in the intermediate structures in nuclear reactions. He contributed to several textbooks, including Nuclear, Particle and Many Body Physics and the Intermediate Structure in Nuclear Reactions. Young was the doctoral advisor for Shirley Ann Jackson, the first African-American woman to earn a PhD at MIT, as well as Sylvester James Gates.\nIn 1977, Young was a founding member of the National Society of Black Physicists. He founded the society with Ronald E. Mickens, with whom he had previously discussed senior Black physicists who became role models for their students. They hosted a meeting at Fisk University to celebrate these \"elders\", including Halson V. Eagleson, Donald Edwards, and John McNeile Hunter. The National Society of Black Physicists emerged from these meetings, an independent society led by African-Americans who \"created and developed activities and programs for themselves\".\nIn 2025, Young is recognized as Professor of Physics, Emeritus, at MIT.\nPersonal life\nYoung married E. Elaine Hunter, with whom he has one child, James E. Young III.\nReferences"
