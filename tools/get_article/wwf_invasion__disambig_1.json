It took place on July 22, 2001, at the Gund Arena in Cleveland, Ohio. The event had been promoted as the fourth Fully Loaded at the preceding King of the Ring event, but WWF changed it to Invasion in May. Invasion was the first pay-per-view to feature the ongoing Invasion storyline, which featured wrestlers from the WWF taking on The Coalition, a combined force of wrestlers from the former World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) promotions, later known as The Alliance.\nThe main event, dubbed the \"Inaugural Brawl\", was a five-on-five tag team match between Team WWF (\"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho, Kane, and The Undertaker) and Team WCW/ECW (Diamond Dallas Page, Booker T, Rhyno, Bubba Ray Dudley, and D-Von Dudley), which Team WCW/ECW won after Austin betrayed Team WWF. The other main match was a singles match for the WWF Hardcore Championship between Rob Van Dam and Jeff Hardy, which Van Dam won. With a buyrate of 775,000, the event is the highest-grossing non-WrestleMania pay-per-view in WWE history.\nFollowing the conclusion of the storyline, instead of bringing back Fully Loaded, the event's July slot was given to Vengeance in 2002 when Armageddon returned that year; Vengeance temporarily replaced Armageddon in December 2001 due to the September 11 attacks. The Invasion name was set to return in October 2025 for an event between WWE's NXT brand and partner promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), but due to controversy with Israel and the October 7 attacks in 2023, the event was changed to NXT vs. TNA Showdown.\nProduction\nBackground\n(pictured in 2019), then known as the Gund Arena.]]\nFrom 1998 to 2000, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) held a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event titled Fully Loaded. The WWF had planned to hold a fourth Fully Loaded in 2001, but in May that year, the promotion replaced it with Invasion, held as part of the ongoing Invasion storyline between the WWF and The Alliance, the latter consisting of former World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) talent. The event took place on July 22, 2001, at the Gund Arena in Cleveland, Ohio.\nStorylines\n, the owner of the World Wrestling Federation]]\nOn March 23, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) bought out its long-time rival, World Championship Wrestling (WCW). The last episode of WCW Monday Nitro aired on March 26, dubbed the \"Night of Champions\". Nitro started with WWF Owner Vince McMahon announcing a simulcast with Raw Is War later that night to address the future of WCW, during which it was revealed that Shane McMahon had bought WCW. At WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1, Shane defeated Vince in a Street Fight with some of the WCW talent in attendance, sitting in the upper-level seats at the Reliant Astrodome. During May, and June, WCW wrestlers interfered in matches on WWF programming. At the 2001 King of the Ring, Booker T interfered during a Triple Threat match for the WWF Championship, and tossed Steve Austin through the announcers table, nearly costing him the title.\nOn the following night, the June 25 episode of Raw Is War, Shane declared his intention to invade the WWF, and the Invasion storyline started with Booker T performing a scissors kick to Vince. On the June 28 episode of SmackDown!, it was decided that Fully Loaded was to be changed to Invasion, and would feature matches between WWF, and WCW. The ultimate goal, reportedly, was for WCW to \"take over\" one of the WWF's two primary programs, either Raw Is War or SmackDown!, and rebrand it as its own separate entity. To test the waters for this, the final twenty minutes of the July 2 Raw Is War telecast was given over to WCW, which brought in its own commentators (Scott Hudson and Arn Anderson), ring announcer (Stacy Keibler), referee (Nick Patrick), ring apron, and Chyron graphics, to present a match between Booker T, and Buff Bagwell for Booker's WCW Championship (which he had won on the final episode of Nitro). This continued SmackDown!, where Gregory Helms lost the WCW Cruiserweight Championship against Billy Kidman, and Booker defended the WCW Championship against Diamond Dallas Page. The Booker/Bagwell title match, however, was very poorly received both by television viewers, and the live crowd in the arena; sports journalist Michael Landsberg reported that many have called the bout \"the worst match ever\". The two other WCW matches also received a negative fan reaction. The decision was thus made to make WCW a heel group that was out to destroy the WWF. On the July 9 epsode of Raw Is War, when then-face WCW owner Shane was scheduled to face Page in a street fight, the two instead attacked The Undertaker, turning Shane heel (Page had already debuted in WWF as a heel, as part of a stalker angle with Undertaker, and his wife). Later that night, Chris Jericho, and Kane (from the WWF) fought Lance Storm, and Mike Awesome (from WCW) in a tag team match. It ended in a no contest when the ECW Alumni from both the WWF, and WCW, along with the debuting Rob Van Dam, and Tommy Dreamer, made their way to the ring. As it looked as though they were going after Storm, and Awesome, they instead attacked Jericho, and Kane. This led to the Raw color-commentator Paul Heyman leaving the announcer's booth, and declared that Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) has joined the invasion, and stated that the invasion has been taken to the extreme, leading to some WWF, and WCW wrestlers (including Raven, Lance Storm, Rhyno, The Dudley Boyz, and Tazz) defecting to ECW. Shane appeared to co-operate with Vince against ECW, but later that night, it was revealed that WCW, and ECW had merged, and that Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley (who was last seen on the May 21 episode of Raw Is War) now owned ECW.\nEarlier in the year, Austin had a change in character, becoming more emotional, and friendly with Vince. On the July 12 episode of SmackDown!, Vince said he needed the \"old\" Austin, an anti-hero tough character, to lead the WWF at Invasion. After Vince pleaded with him, Austin shook his head and left. During the July 16 episode of Raw is War, Austin was shown drinking in a bar. Later that night, a fight started between many WWF, WCW, and ECW wrestlers. As WWF seemed to be disadvantaged, Austin arrived, and returned to his old character, fighting off the WCW and ECW wrestlers. The WWF wrestlers (Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho, Kane, The Undertaker) then cleared out the ring and were left standing tall. On the July 19 episode of SmackDown!, Heyman said that he wanted to bring back wrestling, and destroy sports entertainment by giving the WWF its last rites with The Alliance members, \"In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti, Amen!\", while proclaiming \"Death to sports entertainment! Death to the WWF!\".\nEvent\n{| class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ Other on-screen personnel\n|-\n!Role:\n!Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=2|English Commentator\n|Jim Ross\n|-\n|Michael Cole\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Spanish commentator\n|Carlos Cabrera\n|-\n|Hugo Savinovich\n|-\n|rowspan=8|Referee\n|Mike Chioda\n|-\n|Jack Doan\n|-\n|Jim Korderas\n|-\n|Theodore Long\n|-\n|Mick Foley\n|-\n|Chad Patton\n|-\n|Charles Robinson\n|-\n|Tim White\n|-\n|Ring announcer\n|Howard Finkel\n|}\nSunday Night Heat\nBefore the event officially began, Chavo Guerrero (WCW) defeated Scotty 2 Hotty (WWF) in a match taped for Sunday Night Heat.\nPreliminary matches\nThe first match of the event was between the team of Lance Storm, and Mike Awesome (ECW), and Edge and Christian (WWF).

The match started with Hebner delivering kicks in the corner, followed by punches, and knee drops to the midsection, but Patrick pulled Hebner outside. Back in the ring, Patrick stomped Hebner, but Hebner fought back with punches, and mounted punches. Patrick fought back by performing a low blow, and sent Hebner outside with a baseball slide. WCW referees stomped Hebner until Foley stopped them, and ejected them from ringside.

Bradshaw and Palumbo tagged in, and Bradshaw performed a big boot, and a powerslam. As Bradshaw attempted a fallaway slam, O'Haire performed a superkick and dropped Bradshaw onto the top turnbuckle. After Faarooq sent O'Haire outside, Palumbo performed a superkick to Faarooq, and Bradshaw pinned Palumbo after performing a Clothesline from Hell.\nThe fourth match was between the WWF Light Heavyweight Champion X-Pac and the WCW Cruiserweight Champion Billy Kidman. The match started back and forth until Kidman performed a hurricanrana, and an enzuigiri. X-Pac fought back after sending Kidman over the top rope, and performed a springboard reverse crossbody to the outside. Back in the ring, X-Pac applied the sleeper hold. Kidman escaped and applied the sleeper hold, but X-Pac countered with a belly-to-back suplex. X-Pac went to the top rope and performed a somersault legdrop, but Kidman avoided it.

The following night on Raw is War, Steve Austin explained his defection was because he felt unappreciated. WCW/ECW, now referred to as The Alliance, had the momentum, holding the WWF Championship, the WWF Intercontinental Championship, and the WWF Hardcore Championship, in addition to all of WCW's titles. The feud soon centered around the return of The Rock, and which team he would join, as both Vince, and Shane attempted to persuade The Rock to join their team. The Rock remained with the WWF, and engaged in a feud with Booker T over the WCW Championship. Austin would begin a feud with Kurt Angle over the WWF Championship after the events at Invasion.\nAs the Invasion storyline concluded at Survivor Series in November, this was the only Invasion PPV held, and instead of reinstating Fully Loaded in July 2002, the WWF, which was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in May 2002, moved Vengeance to the July slot; Vengeance had temporarily replaced Armageddon in December 2001 due to the September 11 attacks.\nPlanned revival\nOn the September 23, 2025, episode of NXT, the weekly show focused on WWE's developmental brand, wrestlers from the promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), which had been in a partnership with WWE since January, interrupted a Winner Takes All match between Oba Femi and Trick Williams for the NXT Championship and TNA World Championship, beginning with TNA's Mike Santana, who was slated to face Williams for the TNA World Championship at Bound for Glory. On September 27 at NXT No Mercy, NXT General Manager Ava announced a special episode of NXT for October 7 called Invasion, reviving the Invasion name after more than 24 years. However, just a couple days later, the episode's name was changed to Showdown after backlash in Israel and among the Jewish diaspora because the date fell on the second anniversary of the October 7 attacks, which led to the start of the Gaza war.\nResults\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.wwe.com/ WWE.com]\npl:Lista gal wrestlingu federacji WWE#WWF Invasion 2001"
