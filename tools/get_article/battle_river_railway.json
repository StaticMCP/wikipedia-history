The track is 236 foot-continually welded track. It serves the communities of Alliance, Galahad, Forestburg, Heisler, Rosalind, Kelsey, providing them with a rail connection to the Canadian National line in Camrose which connects to port facilities in Vancouver and Prince Rupert, British Columbia.\nFormerly, the Battle River Producer Car Group, a collective of 180 farmers, operated as a loader of grain cars only, but in May 2009, it became the Battle River Railway New Generation Co-operative, and purchased the branch line from CN in 2010.\nFrom 2014 onward, heritage tours were introduced on the line using a Pullman car, offering themed excursions several times a year. The general manager is Matthew Enright. The founding members of the friends of the Battle River Railway are Joanne McMahon and Ken Eshpeter.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110423121847/http://gdp.nfb.ca/blog/news/rural-alberta-gets-onboard-battle-river-railway-co-op/ National Film Board blob post and mini-documentary]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611093847/http://albertaventure.com/2010/04/saving-the-battle-river-railway/ Alberta Venture article]"
