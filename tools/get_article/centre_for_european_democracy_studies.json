The research establishment serves as a place of regular events covering studies of the European democracy institution, key threats existing today, as well as countries on the way to democracy establishment and development in Europe.\nThe Centre holds conferences, workshops and other events resulting in formulation of recommendations to the European governmental authorities and public organizations aiming to strengthen the democracy and political stability fundamentals.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.eurodemocracy.net Official website]"
