As the battle rages on, the Muslim forces steadily gained the upper hand until the entire rebel forces were routed.\nWhile most of the rebels were slaughtered and some had fled, their leader Abu Shajara was taken prisoner.\nOn-line Resources\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20041210000537/http://www.swordofallah.com/html/bookhome.htm A.I.
