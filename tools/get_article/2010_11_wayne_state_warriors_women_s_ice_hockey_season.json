In the 4-0 triumph, she had 31 saves while earning her second shutout of the season. It was her sixth career shutout. The following day, she registered 40 saves, as the Warriors triumphed by a 5–3 mark. In addition, she held Colgate’s power-play unit scoreless in nine chances during the series. With the two wins, she moved into a tie for second all time in WSU career victories with 24.\n*In October 2010, DeLayne Brian was the starting goalie in all eight of the Warriors games. Among the highlights, she accumulated 61 saves on Oct. 1–2 against Bemidji State. On top of her 61 saves, she held the Beavers to 1-for-13 on the power play. On October 8, she registered her fifth career shutout as she blanked St. Cloud State. Against nationally ranked Boston University, she had a career-high 75 saves in the two game series. Against the Colgate Raiders, she would earn another shutout as she notched 31 saves (on October 22). She led all CHA netminders with a .932 save percentage and ranked third in the nation during October with 272 saves.\n*January 21–22: Delayne Brian made 59 saves in a series split versus # 10 ranked Quinnipiac. She stopped 28 shots in a 2-1 win, as Wayne State snapped an 18-game winless streak against ranked opponents. Brian finished with 31 saves on Saturday.

Her 700 saves are fourth-most in the nation and the second-highest single-season total in program history.\n*On February 4, 2011, Meghan Agosta became the all-time leading scorer in NCAA women's hockey history with three goals and one assist in Mercyhurst College's 6-2 win over Wayne State in Erie, Pennsylvania.
