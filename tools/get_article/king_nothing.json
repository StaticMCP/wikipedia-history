It was released as the fourth and last single from the band's sixth studio album, Load (1996), on January 7, 1997.\nThe song was written by James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, and Kirk Hammett. The song starts on a bass riff which develops into the main riff of the song. A single of \"King Nothing\" was released in the United States. It included a live version of the song \"Ain't My Bitch\", which is also on the album Load. A music video also accompanied the song. The guitars and bass are both tuned to Eb.\nThe words \"Off to never-never land\", heard at the end of the song,  are a nod to the song \"Enter Sandman\", from Metallica's preceding album, which also contains these words.\nOn the US charts, the song peaked at No. 6 and No. 90 on Billboards Mainstream Rock and Hot 100 charts, respectively.\nMusic video\nThe music video, directed by Matt Mahurin, was filmed in Salt Lake City, Utah, in December 1996. It premiered on 7 January 1997.\nIn the music video, \"King Nothing\" is seen wandering around a snowy wasteland, throwing away his crown, and then putting another one on. He does this so much, by the end of the video, there are crowns everywhere. At the very end, hundreds of other King Nothings surround him.\nTrack listing\n;Canada and US single\n#\"King Nothing\" – 5:28\n#\"Ain't My Bitch\" (Live – Irvine Meadows, California, 4 August 1996) – 6:00\n;US promo Single\n#\"King Nothing\" (edited version) – 4:59\n#\"King Nothing\" (full version) – 5:28\nPersonnel\nCredits are adapted from the album's liner notes, except where noted.\nMetallica\n* James Hetfield – vocals, guitar\n* Kirk Hammett – guitar\n* Jason Newsted – bass\n* Lars Ulrich – drums\nAdditional musician\n* Jim McGillveray&nbsp;– shaker\nCharts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
