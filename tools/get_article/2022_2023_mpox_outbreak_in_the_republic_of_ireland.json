The first case in the Republic was confirmed on 27 May 2022.\nBackground\nTransmission\nA large portion of those infected were believed to have not recently traveled to areas of Africa where mpox is normally found, such as Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as central and western Africa. It is believed to be transmitted by close contact with sick people, with extra caution for those individuals with lesions on their skin or genitals, along with their bedding and clothing. The CDC has also stated that individuals should avoid contact and consumption of dead animals such as rats, squirrels, monkeys and apes along with wild game or lotions derived from animals in Africa.\nIn addition to more common symptoms, such as fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and rashes or lesions, some patients have also experienced proctitis, an inflammation of the rectum lining. CDC has also warned clinicians to not rule out mpox in patients with sexually transmitted infections since there have been reports of co-infections with syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and herpes.\nStatistics\nAs of 28 June 2023, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) had been notified of 228 cases of mpox, no deaths have been recorded so far.\n|label_type= Age |table_width=25 |data_type= Cases |data_max= 100\n|label1= 0–18     |data1 = 1\n|label2= 19–24    |data2 = 9\n|label3= 25–34   |data3 = 96\n|label4= 35–44   |data4 = 77\n|label5= 45–54   |data5 = 28\n|label6= 55–64   |data6 = 14\n|label7= 65+  |data7 = 3\n|caption = Median age: 35; Mean age: 37; }}\n|table_width= 25 |label_type= Gender |data_type= Number of cases (%)\n|color1=lightblue |color2=pink |color3=grey    |data_max= 230\n|label1= Male    |data1= 226 |comment1= 99.12%\n|label2= Female      |data2= 2 |comment2= 0.88%\n|label3= Unknown   |data3= 0    |comment3= 0%\n|caption = Total = 228 }}\n|table_width= 25 |label_type= Gender |data_type= Number of cases (%)\n|color1=lightblue |color2=grey |color3=red    |data_max= 210\n|label1= gbMSM    |data1= 205 |comment1= 89.91%\n|label2= Other      |data2= 3 |comment2= 1.32%\n|label3= Unknown   |data3= 20   |comment3= 8.77%\n|caption = Total = 228 }}\nTimeline\nSee also\n*Human mpox\n*Monkeypox virus\n*2022–2023 mpox outbreak\nNotes\nReferences"
