Founded in 2000, BBBFIR was originally known as the Iran Bowling and Billiards Federation (IBBF), later also as Iran Bowling and Cue Sports Federation (IranBCS), and Bowling, Billiard and Boules Federation of the Islamic Republic of Iran (BBFIR). BBBFIR is headquartered in Tehran.\nAffiliations\nBBBFIR is the national governing body for these sports under the National Olympic Committee of I.R. Iran, a member of the Olympic Council of Asia, a regional constituent of the International Olympic Committee.  None of these games are currently Olympic sports,\nFor bowling, BBBFIR is the national affiliate of the Asian Bowling Federation (regional division of the International Bowling Federation, with its discipline-specific division, World Tenpin Bowling Association; its counterpart World Ninepin Bowling Association does not include BBBFIR as a federation member, probably because the sport is mostly confined to Europe).\nIn cue sports, BBBFIR is the national affiliate of the Asian Confederation of Billiard Sports (regional division of the World Pool-Billiard Association), International Billiards and Snooker Federation, and Asian Pocket Billiard Union BBBFIR, as member of WPA and IBSF, is also a national affiliate of the World Confederation of Billiards Sports.

Iran, based in Hamedan; it is a national affiliate of the  and of the Asian Boules Sport Confederation (part of ). Bocce in the country is governed by the Iran Bocce Committee of the .   what role if any BBBFRI plays in organising actual boules (and related) competition is unclear.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://bbfir.ir/ Official website]"
