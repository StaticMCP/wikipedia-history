The album was more commercially successful than his 1988 comeback, Brand New.\nProduction\nThe album was produced by Roy Dea. \"Let's Go Jukin'\" was written with Dickey Betts. \"You're the Reason I'm Living\" is a cover of the Bobby Darin song. \"Nothin' but a Woman\" is a cover of the Robert Cray song.\nCritical reception\n|rev2 = Chicago Tribune\n|rev2score =\n|rev3 = Robert Christgau\n|rev3score = B+\n|rev4 = The Encyclopedia of Popular Music\n|rev4score =\n|rev5 = The Rolling Stone Album Guide\n|rev5score =\n}}\nThe Boston Globe wrote that \"the album dwarfs much of today's country radio fare—and Stewart is a true master at work.\" The Chicago Tribune called the album \"a convincing illustration of why Stewart is a king of that increasingly rare breed: the honky-tonkers.\" The Dallas Morning News noted that Battleground \"has a raw, hollow, sound that immediately conjures up a dark bar.\"\nThe Buffalo News determined that, \"scratchy and scrawny as his voice is, there is something quite compelling about the way this country/blues/rock veteran puts across a song.\" The Fresno Bee listed \"Nothin' but a Woman\" as the second best country cover song of 1990. Robert Christgau concluded that Stewart's \"r&r groove is sharp-witted where Steve Earle's is muscle-headed and the average Nashville cat's just mechanical.\"\nTrack listing\nReferences"
