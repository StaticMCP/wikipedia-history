Contrary to many of his predecessors in the late 13th and early 14th century he is only known from Old Nubian sources, which are: two documents found at Edfu and Qasr Ibrim respectively, four inscriptions from Banganarti, a graffito in Gebel Abu Negila in northern Kordofan and a dipinto from Sonqi Tino. It seems that he wrestled control from the Muslim Kanz ad-Dawla Muhammad, who ruled at least until 1328. Siti thus restored Makuria as a Christian kingdom.\nSee also\n* List of rulers of Makuria\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n*"
