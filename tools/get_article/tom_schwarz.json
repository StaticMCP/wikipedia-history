At regional level, he has held multiple heavyweight championships, including the German title in 2018.\nProfessional career\nEarly career\nSchwarz' first professional fight was on 29 August 2013 when he won a 20 second KO victory over 34 year old Mario Schmidt. After amassing a record of 12–0 (8 KOs), he accepted the challenge of fellow German contender Konstantin Airich and won via unanimous decision over eight rounds.\nIn his 15th professional fight on 15 November 2015, Schwarz faced the powerful 20-year-old German Ilja Mezencev for the vacant WBO Youth World Champion title. In the first round, Schwarz went down against Mezencev, but recovered to win by knockout in the seventh round and captured the WBO World Youth Title.\nOn 4 June 2016, Schwarz fought Dennis Lewandowski for the vacant WBC World Youth Title. This fight also represented his second title defense of the WBO World Youth Title. Schwarz clearly dominated the ten-round fight and won a unanimous decision.\nOn 22 April 2017, Schwarz beat 40-year-old Bosnian Adnan Redzovic (18–1–0) by knockout in the second round to win the vacant WBO Inter-Continental heavyweight title.\nSchwarz vs. Gashi\nOn 21 April 2018 Schwarz faced fellow unbeaten German Senad Gashi. In a highly controversial fight, Gashi had several head-butts that resulted in his disqualification in the sixth round of the fight. Up until the time of the stoppage, the fight had been competitive. In the same year, two knockout victories followed against the Mexican Julian Fernandez and fellow German Christian Lewandowski.\nIn March 2019, he defended his WBO Inter-Continental heavyweight title against Kristijan Krstacic of Croatia to record his 24th professional victory.\nSchwarz vs. Fury\nIt was announced in March 2019 that Schwarz would take on the lineal and former unified world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury in a 12-round bout on 15 June 2019 in Las Vegas. The fight was a one-sided affair, with Schwarz outboxed by Fury, who switched to a southpaw stance after the first round. Shortly after dodging a series of punches from Schwarz, Fury knocked him to the canvas for the first time in his career with a straight right through his guard. Schwarz beat the count, but was stopped by referee Kenny Bayless shortly afterwards, losing his WBO Inter-Continental title.\nCareer from 2019\nIn his next fight, Schwarz faced Radel Varak. Schwarz attacked Varak from the start, and managed to drop him midway through the round. Varak would beat the count, but the referee decided he had seen enough and waved the fight off.\nOn 28 September 2019, Schwarz rematched Ilja Mezencev, winning convincingly via sixth round corner retirement and capturing the vacant International Boxing Federation international title in the process.\nSchwarz vs. Gashi II\nOn 3 May 2025, Schwarz competed against Gashi in a rematch, losing by unanimous decision with scores of 95–93, 99–89, and 96–92.\nPersonal life\nIn April 2021, it emerged that Schwarz was on trial for allegedly punching his former partner Tessa Schimschar in the face in a restaurant car park in Lostau, Germany, in May 2020. It is alleged that Schimschar was reportedly taken to a local hospital after receiving \"a massive punch on the chin, which led to multiple fractures of the lower jaw\", and that she subsequently filed a charge for grievous bodily harm.\nProfessional boxing record\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!\n!Result\n!Record\n!Opponent\n!Type\n!Round, time\n!Date\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n|31\n|Loss\n|29–2\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Senad Gashi\n|UD\n|10\n|3 May 2025\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|30\n|Win\n|29–1\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Christian Demaj\n|KO\n|3 (10),\n|25 Nov 2023\n|align=left|\n|\n|-\n|29\n|Win\n|28–1\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Kostiantyn Dovbyshchenko\n|UD\n|10\n|23 Sep 2023\n|align=left|\n|\n|-\n|28\n|Win\n|27–1\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Muhammed Ali Durmaz\n|KO\n|1 (8),\n|9 Apr 2022\n|align=left|\n|\n|-\n|27\n|Win\n|26–1\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Ilja Mezencev\n|RTD\n|6 (12),\n|28 Sep 2019\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|26\n|Win\n|25–1\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Radek Vařák\n|TKO\n|1 (6),\n|17 Aug 2019\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|25\n|Loss\n|24–1\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Tyson Fury\n|TKO\n|2 (12),\n|15 Jun 2019\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|24\n|Win\n|24–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Kristijan Krstacic\n|KO\n|2 (10),\n|2 Mar 2019\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|23\n|Win\n|23–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Christian Lewandowski\n|TKO\n|6 (10),\n|17 Nov 2018\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|22\n|Win\n|22–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Julian Fernandez\n|KO\n|2 (12),\n|15 Sep 2018\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|21\n|Win\n|21–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Senad Gashi\n|\n|6 (12),\n|21 Apr 2018\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|20\n|Win\n|20–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Samir Nibo\n|TKO\n|4 (12)\n|3 Feb 2018\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|19\n|Win\n|19–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Adnan Redzovic\n|KO\n|2 (10)\n|22 Apr 2017\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|18\n|Win\n|18–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Ivica Bacurin\n|UD\n|8\n|11 Mar 2017\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|17\n|Win\n|17–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Dennis Lewandowski\n|UD\n|10\n|4 Jun 2016\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|16\n|Win\n|16–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Gogita Gorgiladze\n|TKO\n|1 (10),\n|5 Mar 2016\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|15\n|Win\n|15–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Ilja Mezencev\n|KO\n|7 (10),\n|14 Nov 2015\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|14\n|Win\n|14–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Gezim Tahiri\n|\n|3 (6),\n|19 Sep 2015\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|13\n|Win\n|13–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Konstantin Airich\n|UD\n|8\n|11 Jul 2015\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|12\n|Win\n|12–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Vaclav Pejsar\n|UD\n|6\n|2 May 2015\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|11\n|Win\n|11–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Jakov Gospic\n|TKO\n|3 (6),\n|7 Mar 2015\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|10\n|Win\n|10–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Adnan Buharalija\n|KO\n|1 (6),\n|20 Dec 2014\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|9\n|Win\n|9–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Tomas Mrazek\n|\n|6\n|2 Oct 2014\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|8\n|Win\n|8–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Olegs Lopajevs\n|TKO\n|1 (6),\n|26 Jul 2014\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|7\n|Win\n|7–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Ante Verunica\n|TKO\n|1 (3),\n|30 May 2014\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|6\n|Win\n|6–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Lukas Filka\n|TKO\n|1 (3),\n|30 May 2014\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|5\n|Win\n|5–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Frantisek Kynkal\n|KO\n|1 (4),\n|28 Mar 2014\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|4\n|Win\n|4–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Janis Ginters\n|UD\n|4\n|1 Mar 2014\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|3\n|Win\n|3–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Edgars Kalnars\n|\n|4\n|6 Dec 2013\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|2\n|Win\n|2–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Pavlo Nechyporenko\n|\n|1 (4),\n|19 Oct 2013\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|1\n|Win\n|1–0\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Mario Schmidt\n|\n|1 (4),\n|28 Jun 2013\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n|}\nPay-per-view bouts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
