Some terms may be used within other English-speaking countries, or within the freight industry in general (air, rail, ship, and manufacturing). For example, shore power is a term borrowed from shipping terminology, in which electrical power is transferred from shore to ship, instead of the ship relying upon idling its engines. Drawing power from land lines is more efficient than engine idling and eliminates localized air pollution. Another borrowed term is \"landing gear\" (from the aviation industry), which refers to the legs which support the front end of a semi-trailer when it is not connected to a semi-truck. Some nicknames are obvious wordplay, such as \"portable parking lot\", in reference to a truck that carries automobiles.\nGeneral\n;Bill of lading (BOL, BL, B/L):\n:A paper document between a shipper and a carrier acknowledging the receipt of goods for transport. Usually describes the nature of the cargo; hazardous materials classification (if any); amount of cargo by weight, size, and/or number of pallets, boxes, barrels, etc; and the origin and destination of the cargo.\n;Bobtailing:Operating a tractor unit with no trailer attached.\n;Broker:A person or company that arranges for the truck transportation of cargo belonging to others, using for-hire carriers to provide the actual truck transportation.\n;Bulk cargo:\n:Large quantities of undivided or unpackaged cargo, such as grain or dry powder.\n;Bulk freight:See bulk cargo.\n;Cargo:See freight.\n;CB:See ''CB radio - Citizen's Band Radio''.\n:CB radio equipment is found in the vast majority of 18-wheelers and is used by truckers for various purposes, including talking to other truckers on the highway, discussing road and weather conditions, coordinating activity at distribution centers and truckstops and various other purposes, including emergency communications.  In the United States, many truckers monitor CB channel 19 (27.185 MHz), commonly known as the \"highway channel\" or \"trucker's channel\".\n;Consignee:\n:The person or entity transferring legal responsibility or ownership of the cargo (or consignment) from the carrier.\n;Consignment:\n:An agreement between a consignee and a consignor in which the goods are taken responsibility for and transported by a third party, the carrier.

Often a straight truck, semi-trailers are also common. Flatbeds and refuse container trucks can often \"dump\", but are rarely called that.\n;Eighteen-wheeler: This term is derived from the number of tires that the typical OTR tractor-trailer configuration has. See also semi-truck.\n;Semi-truck:\n:An articulated (jointed) combination vehicle, often composed of a 10-wheeled (three axle) tractor and a 4-wheeled (two axle) trailer. There are also two axle tractors, single axle trailers, and occasionally combinations with extra lift axles. In some applications a semi can pull additional full trailers (doubles and triples) with the use of a single axle or tandem axle converter dolly. The use of the term \"semi\" in the name comes from the semi-trailer, a vehicle whose load is carried partly by its own axles and partly by the pulling vehicle, which is commonly included in tractor-trailer rigs.\n;Straight truck:A single vehicle, with no articulation. Normally 2 or 3 axles, sometimes with lift axles.\n;Tractor-trailer:See semi-truck.\n;Truck crane:  A special truck (carrier) with a permanently mounted crane (upper).  This design allows faster moves from site to site than conventional cranes.\nVehicle parts\n:See also Semi-trailer truck#Construction for a diagram of truck parts.\n;Baffle:A partition or separator within a liquid tank, used to inhibit the flow of fluids within the tank. During acceleration, turning, and braking, a large liquid-filled tank may produce unexpected forces on the vehicle due to the inertia of liquids.\n;Bulkhead:A strong wall-like structure placed at the front of a flatbed trailer used to protect the driver against shifting cargo during a front-end collision. May also refer to any separator within a dry or liquid trailer (also called a baffle for liquid trailers) used to partition the load.  See also: headache rack.\nThe cab of an 18-wheeler\n;Bunk:See sleeper berth.\n;Cab:The interior of a truck where the driver sits to operate the vehicle.\n;Cheater axle:See lift axle.\n;Dual wheels:A pair of tire and wheel assemblies mounted side-by-side on a single axle hub. In some applications it is replaced by a super single. On pickup trucks it is sometimes called a dually. The assembly has a greater load carrying ability as compared to a single wheel. It also provides redundancy so if one of the two tires fail the second will maintain support preventing loss of vehicle control and allowing the vehicle to travel to a repair facility.\n;Engine brake:\n:A braking system that utilizes the back pressure from the engine's pistons to slow down the vehicle. Commonly used to prevent heavy trucks from accelerating out of control while driving on steep downhill grades.\nA fifth wheel coupling platform\n;Fifth wheel:\n:A pivoting platform on the rear of a truck tractor, used to support the front end of the trailer being towed that contains locking jaws that engage the trailer kingpin.\n;Float\n:A popular name for a wide tire used on the steer (front) axle (originally known as a Super Single).  Floats distribute the weight on the front axle over a wider area, preventing the tire sinking into softer ground.  Commonly used on dump trucks, cement mixers, etc.\n;Glad hands:Interlocking connectors attached to air hoses that supply air from the tractor to the trailer for air brakes.\n;Headache rack:A sturdy aluminum wall or steel mesh structure affixed to the tractor between the cab and the fifth wheel to protect the tractor occupants from the load on the trailer.  See also: #Bulkhead\n;Jake brake:\n:A popular brand of engine brake. See also engine brake.\n;Kingpin:A large pin, underneath the front of a trailer, which interlocks with the fifth wheel.\n;Landing gear:A set of retractable, crank-up legs that support the front of a trailer when it is not connected to a tractor.\nA dump truck with a raised lift axle\n;Lift axle:An air-powered axle that may be raised or lowered to the ground to provide greater load-carrying capacity, or to comply with axle weight requirements (see also Federal Gross Weight Bridge Formula).\n;Retarder:\n:A device used to assist braking that does not use friction. such as engine braking or axle-mounted electromagnetic retarders. See also engine brake.\n;Sleeper berth:The portion of the truck's interior designated for sleeping, legally must contain a bed.\n;Super single: A popular name for a single, larger wheel and tire, (properly called a \"wide-base tire\"), substituted for dual wheels, an adjacent pair assembly. The main benefit of a super single is a reduction in weight; combined with lower rolling resistance the super single promises better fuel economy. It also prevents rocks from being stuck in between, damaging tires or other vehicles (fling out). The disadvantage is the lack of tire redundancy from which dual wheels benefit, as tire failure can disable the vehicle and increased highway wear, through the high point loading and scrubbing of road surfaces when making tight turns.\n;Tandem axle:A set of axles spaced close together, legally defined as more than 40 and less than 96 inches apart by the USDOT.\nTrailers\n;Auto transport:A specialized trailer or truck/trailer combination used for transporting passenger vehicles.\n;Belly dump:See bottom dump.\nA bottom dump trailer\n;Beverage trailer:  A trailer between 26 feet (7.9 m) and 29 feet (8.8 m) used primarily for the transport of beverages.
