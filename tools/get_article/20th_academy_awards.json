It is notable for being the last Oscars until 2005 in which no film won more than three awards.\nRosalind Russell was highly favored—particularly in a poll from the Daily Variety—to win Best Actress for her performance in Mourning Becomes Electra, but Loretta Young won instead for ''The Farmer's Daughter''.\nJames Baskett received an Academy Honorary Award for his portrayal of Uncle Remus in Song of the South, which made him the first African-American man, and the first actor in a Disney film, to win an Academy Award for acting.\nWinning Best Supporting Actor at age 71, Edmund Gwenn became the oldest Oscar winner, taking the record from Charles Coburn, who was 66 at the time of his win in 1943 for The More the Merrier.\nDarryl F. Zanuck, bitter over the failure of the 1944 biopic Wilson to win Best Picture, accepted the prize for ''Gentleman's Agreement'' by saying \"this award will make up for previous disappointments.\nWinners and nominees\nAwards\nNominees were announced on February 13, 1948.
