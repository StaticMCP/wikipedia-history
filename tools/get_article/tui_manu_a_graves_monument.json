It is located northwest of the junction of Ta'u Village and Ta'u Island Roads on the west side of the island.  It consists of a stone platform, about  in height, that is roughly rectangular in shape with a projection at one end.  Three graves are marked by square sections of smoothed stones, while a fourth is marked by a marble column.  A possible fifth grave, unmarked, is in the projection.  It is the burial site of several (four or five) tu'i, or kings, of Manu'a, including Tui Manu'a Matelita and Tui Manu'a Elisala, the Samoan leader whose signature granted the United States hegemony over the islands.\nThe monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.\nSee also\n*Tui Manu'a\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in American Samoa\nReferences"
