By late October, Delaware was being led by a coach Wentz from Princeton, and by early November, By Dickson was coaching along with Wentz. Rice returned from Pittsburgh after Delaware had finished its season.\nSchedule\n|\n|\n| site_stadium =\n| site_cityst = Chester, PA\n| score = 23–0\n}}\n|\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium =\n| site_cityst = Newark, DE\n| score = 56–0\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium =\n| site_cityst = Newark, DE\n| score = 0–23\n}}\n|\n|\n}}\nReferences"
