In 2019 she published Dress in the Age of Jane Austen.\nProfessional career\nEarly in her career Davidson traveled widely, and became an artisanal expert in recreating vintage clothing.\nIn 2012 Austrian archeologists published a report on their discovery of medieval bras.  Davidson's opinion on this discovery was widely quoted.  She called the bras an amazing find, said one was very similar to a modern bra, and compared them to a missing link.\nIn 2018 a team of archeologists found a skeleton that was still wearing thigh high leather boots, in mud in the Thames River.  Science Alert quoted Davidson, to provide context of the discovery, for its readers.  She clarified that while thigh-high boots are a fashion item today, these boots seem to be designed for a working man, whose job required him to be wading in the shallows of the Thames.\nThe Bill & Ted test\nSlate magazine credits Davidson for a Bill & Ted test for period costume accuracy.  In an interview with Slate Davidson described spending six years working on Dress in the Age of Jane Austen, which required a great deal of meticulous checking of modern works.  She described having the movie ''Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure'' playing in the background, when the heroes capture Beethoven. Davidson described being impressed at the authenticity of the costuming of the scenes set in Beethoven's time.  Even the background characters in those scenes were wearing quite authentic costumes.  Surprisingly, the costume designers had achieved much more authentic costumes than more serious films with larger budgets.\nSlate reported that Davidson created new twitter ID @BillAndTedTest specifically to publish analysis of the costume design of period movies.  Slate quoted the tweet where Davidson gave the test its name.\nPersonal life\nDavidson was one of the Australians stranded in Europe by the COVID-19 virus profiled by 7News, on January 8, 2021.  She described traveling to the United Kingdom, for just two weeks of consulting, in March 2020, arriving just in time for the travel ban.  She thought that her job as a teacher in a government-run institution would have classified her as an \"essential worker\", however she still had not been able to get a high enough travel priority to return to Australia.\nShe had been able to teach online, in 2020.\n}}"
