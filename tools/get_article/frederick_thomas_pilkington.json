He designed mostly churches and institutional buildings in Scotland. Typical of his work is the Barclay Viewforth Church in Edinburgh, a polychrome stone structure with early French Gothic details.\nLife\nPilkington was one of several children to Thomas Pilkington, architect, and Jane Butterworth of Stamford, England. The family moved to Edinburgh in 1854. In 1855 T. Pilkington & Son, architects and surveyors, were living and working at 10 Dundas Street in Edinburgh's Second New Town.\nPilkington studied mathematics under Professor Philip Kelland at the University of Edinburgh, passed his exams in 1858 and was Hamilton prizewinner in Logic, but did not bother to graduate. He signed the University Matriculation Register 1856/7 as of Stamford.\nPilkington married in 1858 and lived at Mary Cottage in the suburb of Trinity in the north of Edinburgh. His wife died in childbirth in March 1861 and Pilkington remarried to Elizabeth Cropley from Ely, Cambridgeshire in August 1861 with whom he raised a family of five children, living successively in Cumin Place, Eton Terrace, Egremont House in Dick Place which he built for himself. His family comprised Ernest born 1864, architect, died during the First World War, Maud Elizabeth, a miniaturist; Ethel Mary; Mabel Jane; and Frederick Percy, born 1874.\nIn later life Pilkington lived in 17 Carlton Terrace on Calton Hill. This is a Georgian townhouse by the architect William Henry Playfair rather than a building of his own design.\nAfter an illustrious but troubled professional life Pilkington returned to London, England in 1883 and died in Pinner on 18 September 1898, leaving £6,609 (Probate November 1899).\nArchitect\nPilkington adhered closely to Ruskin's principles, and in the High Victorian tradition which they promoted he evolved a highly personal style by mixing northern medieval elements with those from the Gothic architecture of Northern Italy as published by John Ruskin and George Edmund Street. His work featured polychrome stone, chunky rustication and lavish external carving of Venetian medieval buildings combined with French rose windows, decorated tracery, high-pitched roofs and deep, rain-conscious porches.\nIn 1854 Pilkington's practice exhibited designs for a church and workers' housing at the Royal Scottish Academy in Edinburgh. After attending the University of Edinburgh in 1858 he designed and built Inchglass, a large Gothic Revival villa at Crieff, Tayside.\nBy 1860 Pilkington had secured the patronage of the papermakers John and Charles Cowan in Penicuik and in 1861 secured their commission for the Scottish National Institution for the Education of Imbecile Children at Larbert, Falkirk. Approximately five years later he also obtained the patronage of Henry Ballantyne (1802-1865) to build villas for the Ballantyne family in Walkerburn, and to design and build a new village with houses for the Ballantyne mill workers. Two of the villas, The Kirna (1867) and Stoneyhill (1868) were characterized by richly sculptured Venetian Romanesque designs, with Moorish influences. These designs were also found in his own house Egremont (1865), 38 Dick Place, Edinburgh and Craigmount Park (1869).\nBetween 1861 and 1866 Pilkington secured commissions for Trinity Church (1861-3), Irvine, Strathclyde, The Moray Free Church (1862), Edinburgh, South Church (1862-3), Penicuik, Lothian, and St John's (1862-6), Edenside, Kelso, Borders. The most dramatic was the Barclay-Bruntsfield Church (1862-4), Edinburgh, with its landmark spire, unprecedented conical cluster of prismatic sections crowning the apses of the heart-shaped plan. All follow the same basic concept of a large galleried auditorium, transformed to a Greek cross at the upper level. All his churches of this period include rich naturalistic carving, including some of his smaller designs at Auchengray (c. 1865), Strathclyde, and Innerleithen (c. 1865), Borders. In 1866 he designed the Marykirk church in Stirling, commissioned by Christian Maclagan, which shared many of these features, although the kirk was built on a difficult site and was pulled down in 1954; full records of its style do not remain.\nBy the mid-1860's his earlier use of polychrome masonry was replaced by more conventional plans last at Windsor Place Church (1866), Cardiff, Glamorgan.\nIn 1867 he went into partnership with John Murray Bell (1839-1877) to form Pilkington & Bell, Bell providing the structural know-how, Pilkington providing the design flair.\nAt the Eastern Club (1868), Dundee, Pilkington combines Romanesque and Renaissance motifs. By 1874 at Dean Park House, Edinburgh, he turned to a giant-scales contemporary French style.\nIn 1883, Pilkington moved to London after he was commissioned to work the Army and Navy Hotel (1180-2), Victoria Street. His move to London did not lead to any other major commissions. His practice transitioned to designing residential flats for both the Artisans, Labourers & General Dwellings Company and for the middle-classes.  This second category of flats include Campden Hill Court, Kensington and York Mansions, Battersea.\nPilkington did not see the completion of York Mansions, his last commission, as he died before its completion in 1901.\nNotable buildings\nBuildings in Edinburgh\n*Barclay Church 1862-4\n*38 Dick Place (Pilkington's own house which he called Egremont, built within the Grange Park House estate), 1865–1870\n*48–50 Dick Place, 1864\n*158–164 Grove Street, 1864\n*Craigend Park (Kingston Clinic), 1867–69\n*1–7 Coltbridge Terrace, 1869\n*129–131 Grange Loan, 1872\n*Daniel Stewart's Boarding House (formerly Dean Park House), 1874\n*3 Queensferry Terrace, Dean Park House Stable Block, 1874\n*8 Spylaw Road, mid-1870s\n*39–51 Deanhaugh Street, 1880–81\n*Moray Free Church, South Back of the Canongate, 1862\n*New Free Church, Viewforth (then Viewforth St. Oswald's),1871\nElsewhere in Scotland\n*Auchengray Church, by Carnwath, South Lanarkshire, 1864-5\n*Trinity Church, Irvine, Ayrshire, 1861–63, currently on the Buildings at Risk register for Scotland.\n*Free Church, Innerleithen, Scottish Borders, (1864–67), still in use.\n*St. John's Edenside, Kelso, Roxburghshire, 1863-6\n*The Kirna in Walkerburn (1867)\n*Penicuik Old South Church (1862)\n*Park End in Penicuik (1862)\n*Sunnybrae, Walkerburn, 1857\n*Stoneyhill House & Lodge, Walkerburn (1868)\n*Tweedvale House & Lodge, Walkerburn (1855-9)\n*Spier's school, Beith, Ayrshire.
