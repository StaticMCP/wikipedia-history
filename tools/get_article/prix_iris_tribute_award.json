      "text": "# Prix Iris Tribute Award\n\nThe Iris Tribute Award () is an annual award presented by Québec Cinéma, as part of its Prix Iris program, as a lifetime achievement award for distinguished accomplishments in the Cinema of Quebec.\nUntil 2016, it was known as the Jutra Hommage, presented as part of the Jutra Awards. It was renamed from Jutra to Iris, alongside the entire Prix Iris program, when Québec Cinéma stripped the name of film director Claude Jutra from its awards program in 2016. The Prix Iris name was announced in October 2016.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=75%\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\" | Recipient\n! scope=\"col\" | Ref\n|-\n| 1999(1st Jutra Awards) || Marcel Sabourin ||\n|-\n| 2000(2nd Jutra Awards) || Frédéric Back ||\n|-\n| 2001(3rd Jutra Awards) || Gilles Carle ||\n|-\n| 2002(4th Jutra Awards) || Anne Claire Poirier ||\n|-\n| 2003(5th Jutra Awards) || Rock Demers ||\n|-\n| 2004(6th Jutra Awards) || Richard Grégoire ||\n|-\n| 2005(7th Jutra Awards) || Michel Brault ||\n|-\n| 2006(8th Jutra Awards) || Denise Filiatrault ||\n|-\n| 2007(9th Jutra Awards) || Pierre Curzi ||\n|-\n| 2008(10th Jutra Awards) || Jean-Claude Labrecque ||\n|-\n| 2009(11th Jutra Awards) || Fernand Dansereau ||\n|-\n| 2010(12th Jutra Awards) || René Malo ||\n|-\n| 2011(13th Jutra Awards) || Jean Lapointe ||\n|-\n| 2012(14th Jutra Awards) || Paule Baillargeon ||\n|-\n| 2013(15th Jutra Awards) || Michel Côté ||\n|-\n| 2014(16th Jutra Awards) || Micheline Lanctôt ||\n|-\n| 2015(17th Jutra Awards) || André Melançon ||\n|-\n| 2016(18th Quebec Cinema Awards) || François Dompierre ||\n|-\n| 2017(19th Quebec Cinema Awards) || Lyse Lafontaine ||\n|-\n| 2018(20th Quebec Cinema Awards) || André Forcier ||\n|-\n| 2019(21st Quebec Cinema Awards) || Pierre Mignot ||\n|-\n| 2020(22nd Quebec Cinema Awards) || Alanis Obomsawin ||\n|-\n| 2021(23rd Quebec Cinema Awards) || Association coopérative de productions audio-visuelles (ACPAV) ||\n|-\n| 2022(24th Quebec Cinema Awards) || Louise Portal ||\n|-\n| 2023(25th Quebec Cinema Awards) || Rémy Girard ||\n|-\n| 2024(26th Quebec Cinema Awards) || Denis Villeneuve ||\n|-\n| 2025(27th Quebec Cinema Awards) || Léa Pool ||\n|}\nReferences"
