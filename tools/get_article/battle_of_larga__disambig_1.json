It was fought on the same day as Battle of Chesma, a key naval engagement of the Russo-Turkish War, 1768–1774.\nThe battle was a decisive victory for the Russians who captured 33 Turkish cannons and the vast enemy camp. For this victory, Rumyantsev was awarded the Order of Saint George of the 1st degree. Two weeks later, the Russians scored an even greater victory in the Battle of Kagul.\nReferences\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929141557/http://www.rustrana.ru/article.php?nid=18572&sq=19%2C27%2C63%2C77%2C2245&crypt= The Battles of Larga and Kagul]"
