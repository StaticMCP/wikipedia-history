The play was advertised and first staged as ''Chish 'n' Fips'', but when it was written the plot ended up with no connection to the title. It was produced in southern England in the Christmas 1980–81 season. Later it was put on at Sadler's Wells Theatre, London by Whirligig Theatre, and went on tour in the autumn of 1981.\nThe play continued to be performed throughout the 1980s.\nWood changed the name to the more descriptive The Ideal Gnome Exhibition in 1981, although it reverted to its original title when it became a television series and a book.\nAccording to the author, the idea of changing the name to The Ideal Gnome Expedition came after he had read an article about the Ideal Home Exhibition.\nWhen the play was adapted as a television series the producer said he preferred the original title ''Chish 'n' Fips'', and the series used that name.\nIn the TV show, produced by Central Independent TV, the two garden gnomes live in the garden behind a fish and chips shop.\nThe play has two acts and six scenes. There are six roles.\nClive Mantle starred in a production of the play.\nChris Clarkson played the character of Wacker in a David Bown production of the play.\nThe play was revived by the Hartley Players in 2010.\nPlot\nThe story tells of two garden gnomes, Mr. Fisher and Mr. Wheeler, who decide to leave the yard to explore the world and find a holiday island, but who find the urban town setting confusing until they meet the cat Chips, who helps them navigate the city and find their island.\nThe outcome is different from what they expected, but they agree that it was the best holiday they had ever had.\nReception\nA 2005 staging in Leeds was called \"A charming production by the Leeds Children's Theatre with a captivating storyline for youngsters\". The reviewer said \"The songs and music for this production is by David Wood OBE, and this again is aimed very much at the level of youngsters, being catchy, melodic and simple but effective.\"\nReferences\n}}"
