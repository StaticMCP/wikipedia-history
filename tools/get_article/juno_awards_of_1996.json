Anne Murray was the host for the ceremonies, which were broadcast on CBC Television.\nQuebec-based independent classical label Analekta Records boycotted the Junos after failing to receive a Juno nomination after attempts for five years. Analekta claimed its sales were twice that of CBC Records.\nSeveral record stores such as CD Plus, HMV, Sunrise and Music World also intended to boycott the Junos because competing music retailer Columbia House had signed on as a Juno advertiser.\nNominations were announced 31 January 1996. Prominent nominees were Alanis Morissette and Shania Twain who had recent internationally successful albums who both won Grammy Awards on 28 February 1996. Alanis Morissette won in five Juno categories, becoming this year's major winner.\nNominees and winners\nLevi's Entertainer of the Year\nPresented by David Clayton-Thomas, Denny Doherty, John Kay, Domenic Troiano and Zal Yanovsky, this award was chosen by a national poll rather than by Juno organisers CARAS.\nWinner: Shania Twain\nOther Nominees:\n* Bryan Adams\n* Jann Arden\n* Alanis Morissette\n* The Tragically Hip\nBest Female Vocalist\nPresented by Russell DeCarle and Buffy Sainte-Marie.\nWinner: Alanis Morissette\nOther Nominees:\n* Susan Aglukark\n* Celine Dion\n* Rita MacNeil\n* Shania Twain\nBest Male Vocalist\nPresented by Susan Aglukark and Kim Mitchell.\nWinner: Colin James\nOther Nominees:\n* Tom Cochrane\n* Charlie Major\n* Mario Pelchat\n* Neil Young\nBest New Solo Artist\nWinner: Ashley MacIsaac\nOther Nominees:\n* Lara Fabian\n* Amanda Marshall\n* Laura Smith\n* Kim Stockwood\nGroup of the Year\nThis award was presented by Canadian Music Hall of Fame inductees The Diamonds and The Crew Cuts\nWinner: Blue Rodeo\nOther Nominees:\n* The Headstones\n* Odds\n* The Rankin Family\n* The Tea Party\nBest New Group\nWinner: Philosopher Kings\nOther Nominees:\n* Hemingway Corner\n* Rainbow Butt Monkeys\n* Rymes with Orange\n* Sandbox\nSongwriter of the Year\nWinner: Alanis Morissette\nOther Nominees:\n* Bryan Adams\n* Anne Loree\n* Odds\n* Shania Twain\nBest Country Female Vocalist\nPresented by George Fox and Charlie Major, this award was accepted on Twain's behalf by her sister Carrie-Anne because she was too sick to attend.\nWinner: Shania Twain\nOther Nominees:\n* Lisa Brokop\n* Cindy Church\n* Patricia Conroy\n* Michelle Wright\nBest Country Male Vocalist\nWinner: Charlie Major\nOther Nominees:\n* George Fox\n* Jason McCoy\n* Don Neilson\n* Calvin Wiggett\nBest Country Group or Duo\nWinner: Prairie Oyster\nOther Nominees:\n* Farmer's Daughter\n* Quartette\n* The Johner Brothers\n* The Rankin Family\nBest Instrumental Artist\nWinner: Liona Boyd\nOther Nominees:\n* Richard Abel\n* George Amatino\n* Hennie Bekker\n* André Gagnon\nBest Producer\nWinner: Michael Phillip Wojewoda, \"End of the World\" by The Waltons; \"Beaton's Delight\" by Ashley MacIsaac\nOther Nominees:\n* Bryan Adams with co-producer Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, \"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman\" by Bryan Adams\n* David Foster (with co-producer Madonna), \"You'll See (Something to Remember)\" by Madonna; \"I Can Love You Like That (And the Music Speaks)\" by All-4-One\n* Chad Irschick, \"O Siem\" by Susan Aglukark\n* David Tyson, \"Beautiful Goodbye\" and \"Birmingham\" by Amanda Marshall\nBest Recording Engineer\nWinner: Chad Irschick, \"O Siem\" by Susan Aglukark\nOther Nominees:\n* Lenny DeRose, \"Faith\" and \"Their Lights\" by Crash Vegas\n* Kevin Doyle, \"Here, There and Everywhere\" by John McDermott\n* Rob Heany, \"Alegria\" by Cirque du Soleil\n* Ian Terry, \"The Way You Look Tonight\" by Oliver Jones and \"Canon\" by D.D.
