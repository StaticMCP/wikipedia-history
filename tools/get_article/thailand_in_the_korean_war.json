Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram told parliament that, \"by sending just a small number of troops as a token of our friendship, we will get various things in return.\" A month after agreeing to commit troops, Thailand received US$10 million in US economic aid and a US$25 million loan from the World Bank. Forty thousand tons of rice were sent to Korea immediately as food aid, followed by an infantry battalion from the 1st Infantry Battalion of the 21st Regimental Combat Team (later renamed the 21st Infantry Regiment, Queen's Guard), formed on 22 September, and several warships. Later in the conflict, several transport aircraft were sent by the Thai government.\n21st Royal Thailand Regiment\nOperations in Korea\n*Battle of Pork Chop Hill\n*Third Battle of Seoul\nBattle of Pork Chop Hill\nThe Battle of Pork Chop Hill (31 October to 11 November 1952) involved numerous battles struggling for control of key territory along the front line while truce talks at Panmunjom proceeded. Pork Chop Hill was held by soldiers of the US 7th Infantry Division, the Thai 21st Infantry Battalion, and other units. They together repulsed attacks by the People's Volunteer Army (PVA). The Chinese made an all-out effort to capture the hill. Eventually, the UN forces withdrew from its heights, ceding it to the Chinese.\nAfter the engagement, the United States military awarded Major Kriangsak Chamanan the Legion of Merit of which he was later invited and received scholarship to study at Fort Leavenworth, where he left his name in the school hall of fame. In 1977 he became the 25th Prime Minister of Thailand, serving until 1980. Another 12 received Silver Stars and 26 were awarded Bronze Star Medals. The Thai unit earned the nickname \"Little Tigers\" for their valour.\n, 1950.]]\nIn last spring of the war (March to June 1953), the Thai infantry spent most of their time training and as 9th US Corps reserve. They then relocated to Kyo-dong on 4 May 1953. A battle followed in the vicinity of the \"Boomerang\" from 14 to 27 July 1953 northwest of Kimhwa, after a Belgian victory in the Battle of Chatkol.\nPost-armistice\nSmall Thai contingents remained in Korea until June 1972 and a symbolic presence remains there in 2020.\nNavy\nand Gallup in Thailand, 1951 prior to being handed over to the Royal Thai Navy. The Gallup, which had already served in Korea with the US Navy, would also serve there with the Thai navy under the name HMTS Prasae II.]]\nOn 7 November 1950 two Thai warships, HTMS Prasae and HTMS Bangpakong, arrived in South Korea. They served under United Nations command, performing escort duty and shelling enemy targets on land. The Prasae ran aground on the coast near Yangyang during a snowstorm. Attempts to refloat her failed, and she was scuttled on 7 January 1951, her wreck being shelled to complete her destruction. The Bangpakong left Korea on 16 February 1952. On 29 December 1951 two more Thai warships, HTMS Prasae II and the HTMS Tachin, arrived in Korea. They sailed for home a year and a half after the armistice on 21 January 1955.\nThe transport ship HTMS Sichang arrived in Korea on 7 November 1950, remaining there until 15 July 1951.\nAir Force\nRoyal Thai Air Force (RTAF) Douglas C-47 Skytrain aircraft took part in the Korean War. Three task force contingents of the Royal Thai Air Force would serve in South Korea:\n#The first of a total of twenty-two Air Liaison Officers Teams was dispatched to the United Nations Command in 1951.\n#The first of twenty-nine Air Nursing Teams began its mission on 26 December 1950, remaining there until 1974.\n#A total of twenty-nine RTAF airlift mission teams served in South Korea from 1951 to 1971.\nHeritage\nDuring the course of the Korean War, Thailand dispatched a total of 11,786 soldiers to Korea. It is recorded that 129 Thai soldiers were killed in the war, 1,139 were wounded, and five were missing in action (MIA). In 1974, the Government of the Republic of Korea built a monument, and a Thai pavilion in Pocheon City, to honour the Thai soldiers who took part in the Korean War. On 4 November 2008, the Thai Embassy in Seoul, with the cooperation from the Office of Defense Attache, hosted the opening ceremony of the Thai memorial at the United Nations Memorial Cemetery in Korea (UNMCK) to commemorate the sacrifices made by Thai soldiers during the Korean War. Thailand still maintains, as of 2020, one liaison officer at the Armistice Committee site and six soldiers as members of the United Nations Command Honor Guard Company in Seoul.\nHTMS Prasae II was decommissioned from the Royal Thai Navy in 2000, and was designated as a museum ship. She is visible at the mouth of the Prasae River, Rayong Province (Thailand) by the Prasae River Communities Committee where she serves as a memorial. There is also a monument to the 21st Infantry Regiment.\nSee also\n* United Nations Forces in the Korean War\n* Medical support in the Korean War\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* [https://new.mnd.go.kr/user/imhc/upload/pblictn/hisofunforces01/index.html The History of the UN Forces in the Korean War-1 (Ethiopia, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey) - ROK Ministry of National Defense Institute for Military History, 1972 (E-BOOK)]\n* [https://www.imhc.mil.kr/user/imhc/upload/pblictn/PBLICTNEBOOK_202211020925219960.pdf The History of the UN Forces in the Korean War-1 (Ethiopia, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey) - ROK Ministry of National Defense Institute for Military History, 1972 (PDF)]\n* [https://new.mnd.go.kr/user/imhc/upload/pblictn/hisofunforces06/index.html The History of the UN Forces in the Korean War-6 (Summary) - ROK Ministry of National Defense Institute for Military History, 1977 (E-BOOK)]\n* [https://www.imhc.mil.kr/user/imhc/upload/pblictn/PBLICTNEBOOK_202211020922227920.pdf The History of the UN Forces in the Korean War-6 (Summary) - ROK Ministry of National Defense Institute for Military History, 1977 (PDF)]\n* [https://new.mnd.go.kr/user/imhc/upload/pblictn/625nun/index.html The Korean War and the UN Forces - ROK Ministry of National Defense Institute for Military History, 2015 (E-BOOK)]\n* [https://www.imhc.mil.kr/user/imhc/upload/pblictn/PBLICTNEBOOK_202301161009297680.pdf The Korean War and the UN Forces - ROK Ministry of National Defense Institute for Military History, 2015 (PDF)]\n* [https://new.mnd.go.kr/user/imhc/upload/pblictn2/625_15/index.html The Statistics of the Korean War - ROK Ministry of National Defense Institute for Military History, 2014 (E-BOOK)]\n* [https://www.imhc.mil.kr/user/imhc/upload/pblictn/PBLICTNEBOOK_201408070704130850.pdf The Statistics of the Korean War - ROK Ministry of National Defense Institute for Military History, 2014 (PDF)]\n* [https://new.mnd.go.kr/user/imhc/upload/pblictn/un/index.html The History of the UN Forces in the Korean War - ROK Ministry of National Defense Institute for Military History, 1998 (E-BOOK)]\n* [https://www.imhc.mil.kr/user/imhc/upload/pblictn/PBLICTNEBOOK_202304020257196620.pdf The History of the UN Forces in the Korean War - ROK Ministry of National Defense Institute for Military History, 1998 (PDF)]\n* [https://www.imhc.mil.kr/user/imhc/upload/pblictn/PBLICTNEBOOK_201306250608524620.pdf The Summary of the Korean War - ROK Ministry of National Defense Institute for Military History, 1986 (PDF)]\n* [https://new.mnd.go.kr/user/imhc/upload/pblictn2/history_of_war_in_korea11/index.html The History of the Korean War-11: The UN Forces (New Zealand, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, Denmark, India, Italy, Norway, Sweden) - ROK Ministry of National Defense Institute for Military History, 1980 (E-BOOK)]\n* [https://www.imhc.mil.kr/user/imhc/upload/pblictn/PBLICTNEBOOK_201306250725274860.pdf The History of the Korean War-11: The UN Forces (New Zealand, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, Denmark, India, Italy, Norway, Sweden) - ROK Ministry of National Defense Institute for Military History, 1980 (PDF)]\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111226223847/http://thaiarmedforce.com/taf-article/48-skyman/148-60-year-of-korean-war.html 60 Years of the \"Little Tiger\" – Thai Soldiers in the Korean War]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120822103108/http://www.korean-war.com/thailand.html Thai Forces]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131026164807/http://www.rtaf.mi.th/MUSEUM/AFHIST-2.HTM History of the Royal Thai Air Force]"
