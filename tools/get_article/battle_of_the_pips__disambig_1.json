In preparation for the amphibious assault on the island of Kiska planned for August 1943, the U.S. Navy formed Task Group 16.22 (TG&nbsp;16.22)sa under the command of Rear Admiral Robert M. Griffin, centered on the battleships  and .\nRadar contact\nOn 27 July,  west of Kiska, TG 16.22 began to pick up a series of unknown radar contacts. The order was given to open fire, and a total of 518 14-in (360-mm) shells were fired from the battleships, but there were no hits.\nRadar was still a new and unreliable technology at that time, and weather conditions around the Aleutians were characteristically bad, with the very poor visibility normal for the area. No Japanese surface warships were actually within . Author Brian Garfield surmises, based on analysis by modern Aleutian fishing-boat captains, that the pips were rafts of sooty or short-tailed shearwaters, species of migratory petrel that pass through the Aleutians in July every year.\nSee also\n*Fog of war\nReferences\n*Stern, Robert C.
