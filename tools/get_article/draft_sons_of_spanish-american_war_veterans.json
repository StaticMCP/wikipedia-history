Founded in the early 20th century, the group is dedicated to preserving the memory of those who served in these late-19th-century American military campaigns.\nHistory\nThe SSAWV was formed as a male auxiliary to the United Spanish War Veterans (USWV), the primary veterans’ organization for Spanish–American War veterans. Its origins date back to the 1910s, as sons and grandsons of USWV members began organizing to perpetuate the memory of their fathers’ service as band corps.\nThe SSAWV was modeled after other hereditary groups such as the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War and the Sons of the American Revolution. At its height in the mid-20th century, the organization had camps and departments throughout the United States. After the dissolution of the USWV in 1992 with the death of its last member, SSAWV activity declined but has seen revival efforts in the 21st century.\nPurpose\nThe organization’s objectives include:\n* Honoring the memory of veterans of the Spanish–American War, Philippine Insurrection, and Boxer Rebellion.\n* Locating and marking graves of veterans from 1898–1902 conflicts.\n* Preserving related historical documents, artifacts, and monuments.\n* Promoting historical education and patriotism through ceremonies and public events.\n* Supporting genealogical and academic research on the 1898-era conflicts.\nMembership\nMembership is open to all male descendants, of honorably discharged veterans of:\n* The Spanish–American War (April 21 – August 13, 1898)\n* The Philippine–American War (1899–1902)\n* The China Relief Expedition (Boxer Rebellion) (1900–1901)\nOrganization\nThe SSAWV is organized into:\n* National Commandery – the governing body of the organization.\n* Departments – regional or state-level divisions.\n* Camps – local chapters (e.g., Buckey O’Neill Camp No. 175 in Arizona).\nThe organization maintains a traditional command structure and continues to use a ritual book published in the 1930s.\nActivities\nThe SSAWV engages in a variety of commemorative and educational activities:\n* Dedication of headstones for Spanish–American War veterans.\n* Participation in Memorial Day and Veterans Day ceremonies.\n* Public displays and booths at historical and genealogical events.\n* Restoration of neglected Spanish–American War memorials.\n* Publication and preservation of rosters, photos, and documents.\nNotable Camps\n* Rice W. Means Camp No. 1 – Formed in New York City, first official camp created within the order.\n* Buckey O’Neill Camp No. 175 – Based in Arizona, this camp is active in historical education, grave dedications, and monument preservation.\nRelated Organizations\n* United Spanish War Veterans\n* Daughters of '98\n* Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War\n* Sons of the American Revolution\nLegacy\nWhile the organization declined after the dissolution of the United Spanish War Veterans, a revival began in the 2010s and 2020s. Active camps have been restored in regions such as the American Southwest and Midwest, and the organization continues to play a role in historical education and preservation of Spanish–American War memory.\nExternal links\n* [https://www.loc.gov/ Library of Congress]\n* [https://www.findagrave.com/ Find A Grave – Spanish–American War Section]\nReferences\nSee also\n* Spanish–American War\n* Philippine–American War\n* Boxer Rebellion\n* Veterans organizations\n:Category:Hereditary societies in the United States\n:Category:Fraternal organizations\n:Category:Spanish–American War\n:Category:Military history of the United States\n:Category:Historical preservation organizations\n:Category:Organizations established in the 1910s"
