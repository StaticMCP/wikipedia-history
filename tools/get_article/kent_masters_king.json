Her father, Dr. Richard D. King, is an Egyptologist and her mother is a former actress. She studied filmmaking at the University of Southern California, where she majored in Cinema and Television and graduated in 1996.\nCareer\nKent began her career as Julie Williams on the primetime soap opera Knots Landing (1988-1992). She filled in for Victoria Rowell in 2000 when Rowell took a hiatus from The Young and the Restless, then joined Port Charles briefly in 2003 as the mysterious and beautiful Imani. She began a recurring role as Dr. Lainey Winters on General Hospital on April 1, 2005, and was upgraded to contract status in December 2005. In 2007, King became an original cast member of the General Hospital prime-time spin-off General Hospital: Night Shift while maintaining her day job on GH. On June 1, 2008, King was taken off contract with General Hospital, and became a recurring cast member once again.\nKent is the daughter of Egyptologist and actress Alfreda Masters (who spent many years as an extra on General Hospital at the nurses' station), and was named for an Egyptian goddess.\nFilmography\nFilm\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Role\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n|-\n| 1998\n| Johnny B Good\n| -\n|\n|-\n| 2001\n| The Wash\n| Michelle\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=2| 2002\n| Love and a Bullet\n| Cynda Griffie\n|\n|-\n| BraceFace Brandi\n| BraceFace Brandi\n| Short\n|-\n| 2003\n| Malibooty\n| Tommi\n| Video\n|-\n| 2004\n| The Hillside Strangler\n| Gabrielle\n|\n|-\n| 2008\n| The Aphrikan\n| Anna\n| Short\n|-\n| 2012\n| Y - The Last Man Rising\n| Agent 355\n| Short\n|-\n| 2013\n| Aftermath\n| Liz Bricker\n|\n|-\n| 2017\n| All About The Money\n| Chris's Wife\n|\n|}\nTelevision\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Role\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n|-\n| 1987\n| Hill Street Blues\n| Tracy Milton\n| Episode: \"Days of Swine and Roses\"\n|-\n| 1988-91\n| Knots Landing\n| Julie Williams\n| Supporting cast: season 9-13\n|-\n| 1992\n| The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\n| Monique\n| Episode: \"The Aunt Who Came to Dinner\"\n|-\n| 1994\n| Red Shoe Diaries\n| Emily\n| Episode: \"Emily's Dance\"\n|-\n|rowspan=2| 1998\n| The Wayans Bros.\n| Chrissy\n| Episode: \"The Son of Marlon\"\n|-\n| The Jamie Foxx Show\n| Tonya\n| Episode: \"Is There a Doctor in the House?\"\n|-\n|rowspan=2| 1999\n| Smart Guy\n| Danita Mills\n| Episode: \"I Was a Teenage Sports Wife\"\n|-\n| The Steve Harvey Show\n| Tessa\n| Episode: \"He's Gotta Have It\"\n|-\n|rowspan=2| 2000\n| The Parkers\n| Debbie\n| Episode: \"Love Is a Royal Pain\"\n|-\n| The Young and the Restless\n| Drucilla Barber Winters\n| Regular Cast\n|-\n| 2003\n| Port Charles\n| Imani\n| Episode: \"Episode #1.1626\"\n|-\n| 2004\n| All of Us\n| Alanna\n| Episode: \"Catering\"\n|-\n| 2005-10\n| General Hospital\n| Dr. Lainey Winters\n| Regular Cast\n|-\n| 2007\n| General Hospital: Night Shift\n| Dr. Lainey Winters\n| Main cast: season 1\n|-\n| 2014\n| Love Midori\n| Jessica\n| Episode: \"Threesome\"\n|}\nMusic video\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Artist\n! scope=\"col\" | Song\n|-\n| 2001\n| Glenn Lewis\n| \"Don't You Forget It\"\n|}\n| 2002\n| Glenn Lewis\n| \"It's Not Fair\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071106095320/http://www.soapoperadigest.com/features/gh/interviews/kentmasterskingbojuka/ Kent Masters King: Body of Bojuka @ Soap Opera Digest]"
