The fighting occurred in the contested region of Kalshaale, near the town of Buuhoodle, as part of ongoing disputes over Somaliland's claim to the area.\nBackground\nKalshaale is located in a contested region between Somaliland and areas claimed by the SSC militias, who opposed Somaliland's administration and sought greater autonomy or alignment with Puntland. Tensions escalated in late 2010, leading to armed confrontations.\nClashes\nThe first significant clashes began in November 2010 when SSC forces attacked a Somaliland military base in Kalshaale. Both sides suffered casualties, with reports of several dozen fatalities.\nThe fighting intensified in February 2011, leading to one of the deadliest confrontations in the conflict. Reports indicated that dozens of combatants were killed, with Somaliland forces sustaining significant losses. General Tani of Somaliland's military reportedly admitted the heavy toll during the fighting.\nAftermath\nThe Battle of Kalshaale resulted in heavy casualties on both sides, despite Somaliland pushing back attacking forces, neither faction achieved a decisive victory. The violence displaced local populations and further strained relations between Somaliland and the SSC militias. The fighting highlighted the ongoing instability in contested border regions between Somaliland and Puntland.\nJanuary 2012 clashes\nFurther clashes occurred in January 2012 between Somaliland forces and Khaatumo militias, with Somaliland forces led by General Mohamed Hasan Abdillahi (Jidhif) reportedly capturing Buuhoodle.\nReferences"
