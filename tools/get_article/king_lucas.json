Players take on the role as knights to help find King Lucas' lost daughters. A castle will be built at random and it is the player's mission to find them inside. Upon every succession, the search gets more difficult - the area of the castle gets bigger and players will eventually have to search through a castle with over 1,000 rooms.\nKing Lucas comes in two gameplay modes: solo and multiplayer. In the multiplayer mode, players compete to be the first one to locate the daughters.\nThe game is available in three languages: English, Spanish, Russian.\nReferences"
