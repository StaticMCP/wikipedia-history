It has been designated as a Grade II listed building.\nThe archway between the nave and chancel and the font remain from the original Norman church, however much of the rest of the building has been revised and expanded over the centuries. The  two stage west tower was added in the 15th century with diagonal buttresses to the lower stage and rebuilt, along with much of the church, around 1860 by James Wilson of Bath. It is surmounted by battlements and pinnacles.\nThe church is within a joint benefice with the Church of St Andrew, Chew Magna and the Church of St Michael, Dundry.\nSee also\n* List of ecclesiastical parishes in the Diocese of Bath and Wells\nReferences"
