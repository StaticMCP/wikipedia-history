No firm dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign, but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 4 February 488 to 9 September 498.\nLegendary narrative\nNinken is considered to have ruled the country during the late-5th century, but there is a paucity of information about him. There is insufficient material available for further verification and study.\nIn his youth, he was known as . Along with his younger brother, Prince Woke, Oke was raised to greater prominence when Emperor Seinei died without an heir. The two young princes were said to be grandsons of Emperor Richū. Each of these brothers would ascend the throne as adopted heirs of Seinei, although it is unclear whether they had been \"found\" in Seinei's lifetime or only after that.\nOke's younger brother, who would become posthumously known as Emperor Kenzō, ascended before his elder brother. This unconventional sequence was in accordance with an agreement made by the two brothers.\nNinken's reign\nWhen Emperor Kenzo died without heirs, Prince Oke succeeded him as Emperor Ninken.\nNinken's contemporary title would not have been tennō, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably , meaning \"the great king who rules all under heaven\". Alternatively, Ninken might have been referred to as  or the \"Great King of Yamato\".\nNinken married to Emperor Yūryaku's daughter Kasuga no Ōiratsume no Himemiko, a second cousin of him. Their daughter Tashiraka was later married to Emperor Keitai, successor or possibly usurper after her brother, and became mother of Emperor Kinmei, a future monarch and lineal ancestor of all future monarchs of Japan. There apparently was also another daughter, Princess Tachibana, who in turn is recorded to have become a wife of Senka and mother of Princess Iwahime, who herself became a consort of Kimmei and bore Emperor Bidatsu, a future monarch and lineal ancestor of current monarchs of Japan.\nNinken was succeeded by his son, who would accede as Emperor Buretsu.\nThe actual site of Ninken's grave is not known. The Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (misasagi) at Osaka.\nThe Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Ninken's mausoleum. It is formally named Hanyū no Sakamoto no misasagi.\nConsorts and children\n*Empress (Kōgō) : , Emperor Yūryaku's daughter\n**\n**\n**, married to Emperor Keitai\n**\n**, married to Emperor Senka\n**, later Emperor Buretsu\n**\n*Consort (Hi) : , Wani Nitsume's daughter\n**, married to Emperor Ankan\nSee also\n* Emperor of Japan\n* List of Emperors of Japan\n* Imperial cult\nNotes\n— a stylized chrysanthemum blossom]]\nReferences\n* Aston, William George.
