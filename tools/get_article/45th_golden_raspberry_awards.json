The awards are based on votes from members of The Golden Raspberry Foundation. The nominees were initially set to be announced on January 16, 2025; due to the Southern California wildfires, however, the announcement was delayed to January 18 and again to January 22, before they were eventually announced a day early on January 21.\nWinners were announced a day early before the originally scheduled date (March 1) on February 28.\nNominees were selected through emailed ballots by 1,202 Razzie members: movie enthusiasts, film critics, and journalists from 49 U.S. states and approximately two dozen other countries, who identified the top five contenders in each of the nine categories. The nominees for Worst Picture competed for a statuette valued at $4.97, adorned with gold spray paint.\nWinners and nominees\n, Worst Picture winner]]\n, Worst Director winner]]\n, Worst Actor winner]]\n, Worst Actress winner]]\n, Worst Supporting Actor winner]]\n, Worst Supporting Actress winner]]\n, Worst Screenplay co-winner]]\n, Razzie Redeemer Award winner]]\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n* 'Madame Web (Columbia / Sony Pictures Releasing) – Lorenzo di Bonaventura'\n** Borderlands (Lionsgate) – Ari Arad, Avi Arad, and Erik Feig\n** Joker: Folie à Deux (Warner Bros.) – Joseph Garner, Emma Tillinger Koskoff, and Todd Phillips\n** Megalopolis (Lionsgate) – Michael Bederman, Francis Ford Coppola, Barry Hirsch, and Fred Roos\n** Reagan (ShowBiz Direct) – Mark Joseph\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n* 'Francis Ford Coppola – Megalopolis'\n** S.

Joker: Folie à Deux received the most nominations with seven, including Worst Picture, Worst Director (Todd Phillips) and Worst Remake, Rip-off or Sequel; conversely, the 2019 original film received the most nominations, with eleven, at the 92nd Academy Awards, which itself caused some controversy, in 2020. Additionally, the first film received a lone Razzie nomination for Worst Reckless Disregard for Human Life and Public Property, which received criticism, losing to Rambo: Last Blood, in 2020. Folie à Deux, however, set the record as the first direct sequel to be nominated for Worst Picture, Worst Director, and Worst Screenplay following the previous installment receiving Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay. In a press release, the Razzies described and panned the jukebox musical as \"a highly anticipated comic-book based sequel that had its protagonists express their mental illness and villainy — by singing and dancing!\"}} Since its release in February 2024, Madame Web was considered \"a serious Razzie contender\" (according to the Razzies), and was predicted by several entertainment news outlets as a frontrunner to be nominated for multiple categories. Overall, multiple film journalists have considered 2024 to be one of the \"worst\" years for comic book/superhero films, with both Folie à Deux and Madame Web being the most mentioned and written about.\nAmong the previous Academy Award winners receiving nominations were Cate Blanchett, Francis Ford Coppola, Ariana DeBose, Lady Gaga, Joaquin Phoenix and Jon Voight, the latter being one of President Donald Trump's appointed \"Ambassadors to Hollywood\" (alongside multiple Razzie-winning actors Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone), who was nominated for his performances in a \"near record\" four films in a single year. Phoenix also holds the rare distinction of receiving a Razzie nomination for acting for the same role he won the Academy Award for Best Actor for in 2020. Jennifer Lopez and Voight were also nominated again following their respective nomination and win at the previous ceremony for The Mother and Mercy. Voight ultimately won, while Gaga and Phoenix both won for Worst Screen Combo; the latter two becoming Oscar- and Razzie-winning performers. The following month, during her monologue on Saturday Night Live as host, Gaga mocked Folie à Deux, and acknowledged and joked about her and Phoenix's win, saying \"Joke's on them. I love winning things!\", and that she is one step closer to an \"EGORT\".\nCoppola became the fourth individual to win the Razzie Award for Worst Director and the Academy Award for Best Director after Michael Cimino, Kevin Costner, and Tom Hooper. Accepting the honor, Coppola posted on his Instagram account: \"I am thrilled to accept the Razzie Award in so many important categories for Megalopolis, and for the distinctive honor of being nominated as the Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, and Worst Picture.\"\nFurthermore, this year contained the rare scenario of an actor appearing in both a Best Picture nominee (at the Academy Awards) and Worst Picture nominee, with Dennis Quaid appearing in both Reagan (Worst Picture) and The Substance (Best Picture).\nIn response to his nomination for Worst Actor for Harold and the Purple Crayon, Zachary Levi posted on his Twitter account: \"Some great actors have been nominated for Razzies. I'll take it as a front-handed compliment.\"\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
