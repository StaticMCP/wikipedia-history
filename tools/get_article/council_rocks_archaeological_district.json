It is located in the Coronado National Forest, along the western edge of the Dragoon Mountains.  It is a canyon flanked by granite cliffs, and full of large boulders.  It contains seven archeological sites, all boulder-formed shelters, five of which have pictographs.  It was the site of the signing of a peace treaty between Cochise and General O. O. Howard in 1872. During the late 1800s it was a stronghold for Cochise and the Chiricahua Apaches.  The site also includes several historic metates.\nReferences"
