It is believed to have been located on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula, with opinion varying from somewhere in Kelantan or Terengganu, in modern-day Malaysia to the vicinity of Phunphin district, Surat Thani province, in modern Thailand.\nAccording to the Chinese text Jiu Tang Shu, Pan Pan was bordered in the south with Langkasuka, and in the north with Tun Sun near the Kra Isthmus. Jacq-Hergoualc'h speculates that the border may have been south of Nakhon Si Thammarat, possibly near Songkhla.\nAfter the northern neighbor Tun Sun gained independence from Funan and became Lang-chia or Lang-ya-hsiu in the late 5th century CE, its southern part joined Pan Pan in the 6th century, while the northern territory became Dvaravati.\nIt is speculated to be related to the Patani Kingdom, which occupied the same area many centuries later, and has some differences in culture and language to other Malay regions nearby.\nHistory\nLittle is known about this kingdom.\nPan Pan sent its first missions to the Chinese Liu Song dynasty between 424 CE and 453  From here, Kaundinya II is said to have tried to re-introduce Hinduism to the Kingdom of Funan on the other side of the Gulf of Siam.\nPan Pan sent tribute to the Liang dynasty and the Chen dynasty of China. in 529, 533, 534, 535 and 571 In 616 and 637, Pan Pan sent tribute to the Chinese Tang dynasty.\nThe kingdom was later conquered by Srivijaya under the leadership of Dharmasetu before 775.\nThough rare, archeological discoveries show evidence of a lively economic flowering in the region through international maritime trade.\nSee also\n* Nakhon Si Thammarat\n* Bujang Valley\n* History of Kedah\nReferences"
