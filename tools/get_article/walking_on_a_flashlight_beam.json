The album was released on October 13, 2014, by Mystic Production in Poland and Kscope worldwide. The album consists of 9 tracks and contains nearly 64 minutes of music. Mariusz Duda composed all the songs and played all the instruments on the album, except for the drums.\nAlbum reviews pointed out that Walking on a Flashlight Beam differs significantly from the project's previous releases. This time, Mariusz Duda leaned much more into electronics and a strong, expressive rhythm, resulting in an album that at times is very loud and  rock-oriented.\nCritics also noted that with Walking On a Flashlight Beam, Mariusz Duda confirmed his talent as a composer and created his own original musi which no longer strongly references the artists often mentioned in reviews of previous Lunatic Soul albums.\nThe British portal Echoes and Dust wrote that “all Lunatic Soul albums have been impressive, but this one is almost certainly Duda’s most remarkable work to date.” The German magazine Visions stated that with Walking on a Flashlight Beam Duda delivers \"the strongest/convincing album of his solo project.\".\nThe album included an additional DVD containing a documentary film about the making of the new record.\nTrack listing\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Chart (2014)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
