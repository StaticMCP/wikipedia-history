In 1552 Salah Reis and Sultan Abdelaziz of Kalaa led a joint successful expedition to Touggourt and Ouargla. Salah Reis advanced with 3000 musketeers and 1000 spahis as well as 8000 Kabyle auxiliaries commanded by Sultan Abdelaziz. Salah Reis stormed Touggourt after a four-day siege and conquered Ouargla, chastised the inhabitants,  imposing a huge fine on two chiefs and returned to Algiers with a huge booty including gold and 5000 slaves. Sultan Abdelaziz was unhappy with the share of booty that had been allocated to him and therefore the Turks suspected him of being an enemy and Hassan Corso denounced him as such. These events are what caused the conflict between Sultan Abdelaziz and the Regency of Algiers.\nIn 1553 Sultan Abdelaziz defeated the Turks in the Battle of Kalaa which made them hungry for revenge. The following year Sinan Reis commanded three or four thousand men in an expedition against Sultan Abdelaziz. Abdelaziz attacked Sinan Reis at Oued-el-Lhâm where he massacred the Turks and emerged victorious from the battle.\nReferences"
