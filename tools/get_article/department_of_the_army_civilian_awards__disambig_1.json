Department of the Army civilian awards are governed by Army Regulation 672–20 Decorations, Awards, and Honors Incentive Awards.\nThere are three categories of recognition: monetary, honorary, and time-off.\nSuperior accomplishment awards\n* Special Act or Service Award – A SASA is a cash award given to recognize a meritorious personal effort, act, service, scientific or other achievement accomplished within or outside assigned job responsibilities. All appropriated fund employees are eligible for this award. Cash awards range from $25 to $25,000, depending on the achievement being recognized. (An additional award exceeding $25,000 may be approved at the direction of the President.)\n* On-the-Spot Cash Award – The OTS cash award is a small SASA ($25 to $500) which may be given by a supervisor for day to day accomplishments of subordinate employees.\n* Time Off Award – Employees may be granted up to 80 hours of time off during a leave year without charge to leave or loss of pay as an award for achievements or performance contributing to the Army mission.\n* Performance Award – A performance award is a monetary award given in recognition of high-level performance for a specific period. This award is used to recognize all appropriated fund employees, except Senior Executive Service (SES) employees. Performance awards will be computed as a percentage of pay with a maximum award of 10 percent of the employee’s base pay.\nValorous awards\nThe Secretary of the Army Award for Valor is awarded for acts of heroism or bravery connected with an Army employee or Army activity, or that in some way benefits the Army. Recipients will have distinguished themselves by exhibiting great courage or sacrifice involving heroism or bravery. The performance of the act must be a voluntary action above and beyond the call of duty. The act may be recognized if it is connected with an Army employee or Army activity, or if the Army in some way benefits from the act. Awards will be made only to recognize single acts of heroism or bravery. This award is not presented in recognition of activities or conflict with an armed enemy. The situation must have involved personal hazard or danger and the voluntary risk of life. Awards are not made solely for saving a life.\nFile:Sec of the Army Medal for Valor.jpg|Secretary of the Army Award for Valor\nHonorary awards\nHonorary awards are intended to be presented to Department of the Army civilian employees in recognition of noteworthy accomplishments.
