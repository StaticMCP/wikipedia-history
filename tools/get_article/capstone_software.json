Founded in 1984, Capstone created first-person games such as Corridor 7: Alien Invasion, Operation Body Count, ''William Shatner's TekWar and Witchaven'', and is also known for releasing games based on movie/TV licenses. Capstone's first-person games used the Wolfenstein 3D engine, and later, the Build engine.\nIntraCorp went bankrupt in 1996 and shut down all its operations, including Capstone Software. Capstone's last game, Corridor 8: Galactic Wars, never left the prototype stage and was never released. Capstone became VRTech, providing first-person buildouts of new construction condominiums using the Build engine. It eventually closed down.\nGames\nThe following is a list of games developed and/or published by Capstone Software as well its parent company Intracorp.\nIntracorp\n}}\nCapstone Software\n}}\nPublished\n}}\nDistributed\n* Eternam\n* Pinball Arcade\n* Superman: The Man of Steel\n* Trolls\nCancelled\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width: 100%\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:35%\" scope=\"col\" | Title\n! style=\"width:14%\" scope=\"col\" | Cancellation date\n! style=\"width:25%\" scope=\"col\" | Developer(s)\n! style=\"width:3%\" scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | Rescue 911\n| 1994\n| Capstone Software\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | Flintstones vs. The Jetsons Chess\n| 1994\n| Capstone Software\n|\n}}\nExternal links\n*[http://corridor7.tripod.com/INTSITE/capstone/capstone_software.htm Capstone Software] at KBW's Corridor 7 Homepage\n*"
