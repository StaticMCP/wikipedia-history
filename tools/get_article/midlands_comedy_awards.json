It also recognises achievement in online comedy. They were founded in 2014 and give out awards in eleven categories every year.\nHistory\nThe Midlands Comedy Awards were created by Birmingham-based comedian Jay Shareef in 2014, \"to recognise the huge number of hard working and talented people in [the] regional comedy community\".\nRules and eligibility\nThe finalists for the awards are chosen by comedy clubs and media professionals from the Midlands region, and only comedians and comedy clubs based in either the East Midlands or West Midlands qualify. This means that comedians resident in The Midlands are eligible even if they are originally from elsewhere. The awards include the following counties in their definition of the Midlands region: Cambridgeshire, Derbyshire, Herefordshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Northamptonshire, Rutland, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, West Midlands and Worcestershire.\nBefore Brexit, the awards accepted the definition of East Midlands and West Midlands as the areas represented in the European Parliament by those constituencies.\nWinners\n2021\n;\nBest Act\n*Winner – Scott Bennett\n*Runner up – Stevie Gray\n*Third place – Josh Pugh\nBest MC\n*Winner – Jon Pearson\n*Runner up –
