Its postcode is 6107.\nThere are 6,853 persons living in Queens Park. The top five ancestries represented in the suburb were English, Chinese, Australian, Indian, Nepali and Filipino. The majority of persons living in Queens Park were between the ages of 18 and 49 (school leavers, university students, young workforce and parents and home builders).\nPre colonial history\nQueens Park, prior to colonial interactions, was originally cared for by the Whadjuk Noongar people, the traditional owners for the areas along the Canning River. Prior to the colonial settlement of the area, the Canning River and its associated wetlands provided an important source of food and shelter to the Beeliar and Beeloo Noongar people. The Beeloo considered north of the Canning River to the hills as part of their ground while the Beeliar mainly traversed the southern section of the river to the sea. At the time of colonial settlement, Midgegooroo and Munday were leaders of these people. The Cannington-Wilson area was called \"Beeloo\" for many years by local residents.\nPost-colonial history\nThe suburb derives its name from the former Queens Park Road Board that was incorporated into the Canning and Belmont Road Boards.\nQueens Park was originally known as Woodlupine. The name change was brought about following a murder in 1911. Local residents and authorities feared the incident could jeopardise the development of the area. It was agreed that the name would be changed to Queens Park to honour Queen Alexandra, wife of King Edward VII.\nSister Kate's children's home\nThe largest single land-holder in Queens Park was Sister Kate's children's home, which was founded by Katherine Mary Clutterbuck in 1934 and expanded in 1936. At the time, A. O. Neville, the government Chief Protector of Aborigines was the architect of an official scheme that oversaw the care, custody and education of Aboriginal and half-caste children under 16 years in the state.  The scheme's purpose was to integrate young and part-Aboriginal children into white society by separating them from their families. These children later became known as the Stolen Generations.\nWhadjuk Noongar heritage sites\n* DAA have site 3633 located on Sevenoaks Street in Queens Park.\nColonial heritage\n* The Chapel of the Guardian Angel\n* Sister Kate's Children's Home\n* St Josephs Roman Catholic School & Convent\n* St Norbert College & St Joseph's Priory\n* Cannington Fire Station\n* Coronation Hotel\nModern developments\nQueens Park now incorporates the former suburb of Maniana, once of State Housing development post-WW2, which is being pulled down and redeveloped into \"Quatro\"..\nNew developments such as \"Skytown\" have seen property prices boom as developers buy old houses for unit development, especially around the older parts of Queens Park on Welshpool Road.\nQueens Park is now the centre of another major re-development, with plans announced in 2020 to build a State Football Centre in Queens Park.\nTransport\nQueens Park is home to Queens Park railway station.
