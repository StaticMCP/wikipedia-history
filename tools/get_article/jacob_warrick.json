He was a son of John Warrick, who had served at the 1774 Battle of Point Pleasant, during Lord Dunmore's War against the Native Americans. As a young man, Jacob Warrick moved to what is now Nicholas County, Kentucky.\nIn 1795 he married Jane Montgomery, a daughter of Thomas Montgomery, who had settled in today's Montgomery County, Kentucky in 1793.\nThe Montgomery family moved to Indiana Territory in 1805, and Jacob Warrick joined them the following year. In 1807 Warrick and Thomas Montgomery led the militiamen that burned the last Native American village in Gibson County, pursuing the fleeing Indians into Illinois.\nAs a militia captain, Jacob Warrick commanded an Indiana company during Tecumseh's War. He was killed in 1811 at the Battle of Tippecanoe. His widow survived him by 35 years.\nWarrick County, Indiana is named for Jacob Warrick.\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.rootsweb.com/~usgenweb/ky/tippecanoe/preface.html Battle of Tippecanoe]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050916051335/http://www.rootsquest.com/~jmurphy/gibson/stormont.htm Gibson County, Indiana, Gil Storment, 1914]\nReferences"
