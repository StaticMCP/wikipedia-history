It operates the PAVE PAWS radar to watch for missiles launched toward North America. The squadron is assigned to Space Delta 4.  The squadron was first organized in October 1979 as the 6th Missile Warning Squadron.\nMission\nThe mission of the 6th SWS is to observe United States coasts for incoming sea–launched or intercontinental ballistic missiles using the PAVE PAWS radar system.  Also, the 6th is to determine the potential threat of the numbers and destination of incoming missiles; then report continuous information to the North American Aerospace Defense Command, Cheyenne Mountain Space Force Station, and NORTHCOM.\nHistory\nThe 6th Space Warning Squadron was founded at Cape Cod Missile Early Warning Station in August 1977. It was the first squadron in the country to be equipped with PAVE PAWS.\nPAVE PAWS also generates information on the location and velocity of earth-orbiting satellites to NORAD.\nThe squadron also had a detachment at North Truro Air Force Station from 1977 to 1985, when the station closed and operations at the accompanying radar dome were taken over by the Federal Aviation Administration. The 2165th Communications Squadron was a separate tenant at CCAFS until 1986 when it was merged with the 6th SWS.\nLineage\n* Constituted as the 6th Missile Warning Squadron\n: Activated on 1 October 1979\n: Redesignated 6th Space Warning Squadron on 15 May 1992\nAssignments\n* 21st Air Division, 1 October 1979\n* Aerospace Defense Command  1 October 1979\n* 45th Air Division, 1 December 1979\n* 1st Space Wing, 1 May 1983\n* 21st Operations Group, 15 May 1992 – present\nStations\n*Cape Cod Space Force Station, Massachusetts, 1 October 1979 – present\nAwards and decorations\n*Air Force Outstanding Unit Award\n**1 January 1998 – 31 December 1998\n**1 October 1997 – 30 September 1999\n**1 October 1995 – 30 September 1997\n**2014\n* 2004 Partridge Slemon Award as North American Aerospace Defense Command's most outstanding unit for its support of the common defense and partnership in protecting the U.S. and Canadian homelands\nList of commanders\n*Col Judson 1989\n*Col   1990-1993\n*Col Richard Cable\n*Col Mario V.
