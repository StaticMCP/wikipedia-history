This album debuted at No. 76 on the Billboard 200 chart.\nRelease\nOn June 24, Miss May I announced via Facebook that the new album \"Monument\" will be released August 17 and that they are recording a video at Mansfield Prison for the song \"Relentless Chaos.\" On July 14, guitarist Justin Aufdenkampe posted a picture on his Twitter account of the album's track list and song lengths. On August 5, it was announced that the song \"Rust\" would only be available through preorder on iTunes via the band's Facebook. On September 3, the video for \"Relentless Chaos\" was released via YouTube.\nOn May 21, 2011, it was announced that Monument would be released in a Deluxe Edition on June 21, 2011, featuring three new songs, the \"Rust\" b-side, and a DVD featuring music videos, interviews, live songs, and more.\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = Alternative Press\n| rev2Score =\n}}\nMetal Hammer reviewed the album in the February 2011 issue. It received a low score of 5/10 and was criticised for sounding unoriginal and too much like the band As I Lay Dying. Writer Adam Rees wrote \"Miss May I struggle to deliver anything new...their best moments sound suspiciously like recent As I Lay Dying output on an off day....\"\nIn contrast \"Monument\" was well received by Rock Sound who awarded it 8/10 \"Since metalcore started merchandising a band’s image and paint-splattered jock-straps, before a fairly blueprinted sound structure, it’s been a difficult path to tread to find which bands are worth sticking around to listen to, but with their second outing ‘Monument’, Miss May I have firmly marked their place for Killswitch Engage’s support slots. The thunderous attacks of ‘Relentless Chaos’ and ‘Creations’ show the band’s steps towards thrash tendencies to a well worked effect. With exhilarating time signatures and ruthless musicianship, Miss May I have shown what it was that made metalcore exciting in the first place, and why we can love it once again.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nMiss May I\n* Levi Benton – unclean vocals, programming\n* Ryan Neff – bass, clean vocals, lead vocals track 9\n* B.J.
