The site includes a platform mound and the remains of a village; while it once included several other mounds, they have been destroyed by modern activity. Mississippian peoples inhabited the site c. 1150–1200. The site is affiliated with the Cahokia settlement system and was the largest site in the system except for Cahokia itself. However, the majority of the site was destroyed by the construction of Interstate 270; known information about the site mainly comes from salvage excavations conducted before the highway was built.\nThe site was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 7, 1978.\nReferences"
