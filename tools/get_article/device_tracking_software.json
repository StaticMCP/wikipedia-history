The system typically consists of two main parts: a client-side application or agent installed on the device to be tracked, and a server-side platform that receives, processes, and displays the location data to the user.\nThe software on the device obtains its location using various technologies, including GPS, Wi-Fi positioning, or cellular network triangulation, and transmits this location data to the server. This technology is the foundation for a wide range of applications, from consumer services for finding lost or stolen devices to enterprise platforms for fleet management and employee monitoring. The overall solution is a type of tracking system that is integral to modern telematics.\nKey features often include:\n* Real-time location tracking\n* Remote locking and wiping\n* Geofencing alerts\n* Usage monitoring\nCommon uses:\n* Finding lost or stolen devices\n* Parental controls\n* Fleet management for businesses\n* Employee monitoring\nSome popular options:\n* Find My (Apple devices)\n* Google Find My Device (Android)\n* Prey (cross-platform)\n* Absolute (enterprise-focused)\nDevice tracking becomes significantly more challenging, and often nearly impossible, when the device's data connection is turned off.\nThis is because;\n# No GPS transmission: Without a data connection, the device can't send its GPS coordinates to tracking servers.\n# Cell tower triangulation fails: The device can't communicate with cell towers, preventing network-based location.\n# Wi-Fi positioning disabled: Without data, the device can't transmit information about nearby Wi-Fi networks.\n# IP tracking ineffective: No internet connection means no IP address to trace.\n# Background services halted: Tracking apps can't run or update in the background without data.\n# Remote commands blocked: Users can't send remote lock or wipe commands to a device without data.\nIn these cases, the last known location before data was turned off becomes crucial. Some tracking methods might still work if the device reconnects briefly, but continuous real-time tracking is essentially impossible without an active data connection.\nSee also\n* Geolocation software\n* Hybrid positioning system\n* Mobile phone tracking\n* Bringrr\n* Skyhook Wireless\n* Laptop theft\n* Prey (software)\nReferences"
