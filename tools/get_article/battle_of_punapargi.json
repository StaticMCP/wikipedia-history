The group of soldiers were ordered to refrain from starting a battle with the German forces during negotiations.\nCourse of the Battle\nOn December 23, 40 Estonian Scouts with two heavy machine guns left Mõisaküla headed towards Punapargi. The soldiers arrived at Punapargi by train. A column of German soldiers were seen moving along the railway. The Estonian forces wanted to engage in negotiations. The Estonian soldiers dismounted from the train, and reportedly a German officer fired his revolver at Verner Limberg. An Estonian soldier fired back, hitting the German officer.\nThe German soldiers started engaging the Estonian soldiers, who retaliated by firing on the German forces with a machine gun. German forces advanced against the Estonian forces, who were ordered by Limberg to retreat back to the trains. 7 soldiers who resisted against retreating were surrounded and killed by the Germans with bayonets. An Estonian private reportedly hid his rifle and pretended to be a sawmill worker, surviving the Germans surrounding him. The private rejoined his group after the Germans left.\nAftermath\n]]\nThe battle lasted ~20 minutes.\nThe retreating Estonian forces regrouped in Tihemetsa and returned to Mõisaküla.\nLosses for the Estonian forces were 9 killed and 3 wounded. Losses for the Germans numbered 22 killed and 30 wounded.\nThe battle was the last engagement between the Estonian forces and retreating German forces.\nFallen soldiers were buried in Saarde Cemetery, Häädemeeste, and Mazsalaca in Latvia.\nReferences"
