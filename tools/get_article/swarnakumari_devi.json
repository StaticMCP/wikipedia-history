She was the elder sister of Rabindranath Tagore. Her short story Mutiny describes her experience being born just prior to the Sepoy Rebellion of 1857.\nSwarnakumari and her sisters did not attend school, but were tutored privately in Sanskrit and English and had the educational benefit of being raised in the Calcutta mansion that was home to the Tagore family. At age 13, she married Janakinath Ghosal, a deputy magistrate. Their children were  Hiranmoyee Devi, Sir Jyotsnanath Ghosal (married to Sukriti Devi, daughter of Maharaja Nripendra Narayan and Suniti Devi) and Sarala Devi Chaudhurani.\nIn 1886, she established the first women's organization in Bengal, Sakhi-Samiti, to help impoverished women. She also founded the Ladies' Theosophical Society in Calcutta.\nShe participated in sessions of the Indian National Congress in 1889 and 1890. Swarnakumari and Kadambini Ganguly were the first women delegates to the Indian National Congress.\nLiterary career\nSwarnakumari was a writer and editor for the literary monthly Bharati for more than 30 years, after the journal was established by her older brother Dijendranath Tagore in 1877 or 1878. Her work in Bharati is considered to be among her major achievements.\nSwarnakumari is the author of 25 books and a wide range of essays. 17 of her 24 essays on science were published in the journal Bharati between 1880 and 1889, and she expanded the Bengali language by creating new scientific terminology, as well as by incorporating terms created by Rajendralal Mitra, Madhusudan Gupta, Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. Her science essays were written for lay readers, to help facilitate understanding of the concepts and to help promote science education. In 1882, a collection of her science essays, titled Prithivi, was published.\nAccording to Anurupa Devi, \"Many women had written poems and stories before her, but these were looked upon patronizingly. She was the first writer to show up the strengths of women's writing and raise women's creations to a position of respect.\" Swarnakumari achieved contemporary popularity as a novelist, but many of her works have not been reprinted.\nHer novel Dipnirban (The Snuffing Out of the Light) was first published anonymously in 1870, but it was eventually understood that the author was a \"young Hindu lady\", according to a notice in the Hindu Patriot. The Calcutta Review wrote, \"We have no hesitation in pronouncing this book to be by far the best that has yet been written by a Bengali lady, and we should no more hesitate to call it one of the ablest in the whole literature of Bengal.\" In 1879, she published what is believed to be the first Opera written in Bengali, Basanta Utsav (Spring Festival). In her poem Likhitechi (Writing, Day and Night), she expresses frustration at the challenges related to establishing her own career as a writer.\nSwarnakumari also wrote more than three hundred songs.\nSelected works\nNovels\n* Dipnirban (The Snuffing Out of the Light), 1870\n* Mibar Raj, 1877\n* Chinna Mukul (A Picked Flower), 1879\n* Mālati, 1881\n* Hughlir Imam Badi 1887\n* Vidroha (Revolt), 1890\n* Snehalata ba Palita (tr. as: The Uprooted Vine), (two volumes) 1892 and 1893, Oxford University Press, 2004\n* Phulermala (tr. as: The fatal Garland), 1894\n* Kahake (To Whom?; tr. as: The Unfinished Song), 1898, Oxford University Press, 2008\n* Bichitra, 1920\n* Swapnabani, 1921\n* Milanrati, 1925\n* Phuler Mala\nShort stories\n* Short stories, 1919\nPlays\n* Koney Badal (Evening Dust Clouds / Time for Seeing the Bride), 1906\n* Pak Chakra (Wheel of Fortune), 1911\n* Rajkanya\n* Divyakamal\nHonors and awards\nShe received the Jagattarini gold medal in 1927 from the University of Calcutta and was the first woman to win this award.
