It was created in June 2006 with  and expanded in August 2016 by moving its border to the limit of the exclusive economic zone, making it one of the world's largest protected areas.  In 2025, the marine areas of the Monument became part of the Papahānaumokuākea National Marine Sanctuary.\nGeography\nThe Monument covers roughly  of reefs, atolls and shallow and deep sea (out to  offshore) in the Pacific Oceanlarger than all of America's national parks combined. It contains approximately 10 percent of the tropical shallow water coral reef habitat down to  in U.S. territory.\nAbout  of the Monument are part of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, designated in 2000. The Monument also includes the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge ( and Battle of Midway National Memorial, the Hawaii State Seabird Sanctuary at Kure Atoll, and the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands State Marine Refuge.\nThe islands included in the Monument are all part of the state of Hawaii, except Midway Atoll, which is part of the United States Minor Outlying Islands insular area. Henderson Field, a public airport located on Midway Atoll, provides access to the Monument.  Until the 2010s, French Frigate Shoals Airport on Tern Island was maintained as a runway.  Although not officially  decommissioned, the runway is now considered inactive. The Tern Island field station run by the Fish and Wildlife Service in the French Frigate Shoals was abandoned in 2012 after a severe storm destroyed its infrastructure. Hurricane Walaka destroyed the East Island in the shoals in 2018, but it has recently begun to restore itself.\nAdministration\nThe Monument's ocean area is administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  It contains U.S. and Hawaiian designated refuges, sanctuaries, reserves and memorials with separate administration. The Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, with an area of  is administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).\nHistory\nThe Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) are known for its cultural and natural values according to the Native Hawaiian culture, who believed the area represented kinship between nature and humanity.  Hawaiians believe that life began and returned there after death.  Archaeological remains have been found on Nīhoa and Mokumanamana in the area.\nAfter the Hawaiian Islands were annexed by the United States and became a territory, the area was first protected by the federal government on February 3, 1909.  In response to the over-harvesting of seabirds, and in recognition of the importance of the NWHI as seabird nesting sites, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt created the Hawaiian Islands Bird Reservation through . President Franklin D. Roosevelt converted it into the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge in 1940. A series of incremental protection expansions followed, leading to the establishment of Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge in 1988, the Kure Atoll State Wildlife Sanctuary in 1993, and the NWHI Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve in 2000.\nPresident Bill Clinton established the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve on December 4, 2000, with Executive Order 13178. Clinton's executive order initiated a process to designate the waters of the NWHI as a National Marine Sanctuary. A public comment period began in 2002. In 2005, Governor of Hawaii Linda Lingle declared parts of the Monument a state marine refuge.\nThe NWHI once accounted for approximately half of the locally landed bottomfish in Hawaii. The NWHI bottomfish fishery was a limited entry fishery, with eight vessels, which were restricted to  in length. The National Marine Fisheries Service published reports attesting to the health of bottomfish stocks. Commercial and recreational bottomfish and pelagic fishing were recommended to be continued under a 2004 NOAA draft of protections.\nPresident George W. Bush and his wife viewed a screening of the documentary film Voyage to Kure in April 2006 at the White House along with its director, Jean-Michel Cousteau. Compelled by the film's portrayal of the flora and fauna, on June 15, 2006, Bush moved to quickly to expand protections, signing Proclamation 8031 which designated the waters of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands a National Monument under the 1906 Antiquities Act. Using the Antiquities Act bypassed the normal year of consultations and halted the public input process and came just before the draft environmental impact statement for the proposed Northwestern Hawaiian Islands National Marine Sanctuary was to be published. This was the second use by Bush of the Antiquities Act, following the declaration of the African Burial Ground National Monument on Manhattan in February 2006.\nThe legislated process for stakeholder involvement in the planning and management of a marine protected area (MPA) had already taken five years of effort, but the abrupt establishment of the NWHI as a National Monument, rather than a Sanctuary, provided immediate and more resilient protection. The protection is revocable only by legislation.\nvisits Midway Atoll (2016)]]\nPresident Bush amended Proclamation 8031 on February 27, 2007, naming the Monument \"Papahānaumokuākea\", inspired by the names of the Hawaiian creator goddess Papahānaumoku and her husband Wākea. Bush announced his intention to submit the Monument for Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA) status on May 15, 2007, which would \"alert mariners to exercise caution in the ecologically important, sensitive, and hazardous area they are entering.\" In October 2007, the Marine Environmental Protection Committee of the International Maritime Organization designated the Monument as a PSSA. Commercial fishing ended in 2010.\nThe Federal Interagency Panel for World Heritage officially designated the Monument as a World Heritage site  in November 2008. The National Monument was inscribed on the World Heritage List in July 2010 as \"Papahānaumokuākea\" at the 34th Session of the World Heritage Committee in Brasília.\nPresident Barack Obama expanded the Monument's area by roughly four times in August 2016, to the limits of the exclusive economic zone. It was at that time the world's largest MPA.\nDuring the first Trump administration, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke put the Monument's status under review.\nBefore leaving office, President Joe Biden expanded protective ocean areas of the Monument by designating the marine environment a national marine sanctuary as part of his \"America the Beautiful\" campaign on January 15, 2025.  These portions of the Monument, from the shore of each island or atoll to 200 nautical miles offshore, became the Papahānaumokuākea National Marine Sanctuary, the 18th national marine sanctuary in the United States.\nEcology\nThe Monument supports 7,000 species, one quarter of which are endemic. Prominent species include the endangered hawksbill sea turtle, the threatened green sea turtle and the endangered Hawaiian monk seal, the Laysan and Nīhoa finches, the Nīhoa millerbird, Laysan duck, seabirds such as the Laysan albatross, numerous species of plants including Pritchardia palms, and many species of arthropods, including the Nīhoa conehead katydid, the Nīhoa trapdoor spider, and the Nihoa giant tree cricket.\nAccording to the Pew Charitable Trusts, populations of lobster have not recovered from extensive harvesting in the 1980s and 1990s, which is now banned; the remaining fisheries are overfished, although commercial fishing is banned. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) reported in 2008 that many species' populations have not fully recovered from a large-scale shift in the oceanic ecosystem that affected the North Pacific during the late 1980s and early 1990s. This shift reduced populations of important species, such as spiny lobster, seabirds and Hawaiian monk seals. The Monument receives strict conservation protection, with exceptions for traditional Native Hawaiian uses and limited tourism.\nUnder the direction of the Trump administration, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) gave SpaceX permission in 2025 to use an area within 50-miles of Papahānaumokuākea as a containment zone for space debris from the Starship launch vehicle.\nFile:Acropora coral ffs.jpg|\nFile:PMNM - Hohonu Moana Exploring Deep Waters off Hawaiʻi (31138616970).jpg|Bubblegum coral\nFile:Sanc1319 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|Finger coral\nFile:PMNM - Acropora cytherea - French Frigate Shoals (31289715760).jpg\nFile:PMNM red squirrelfish (48770852067).jpg|Hawaiian squirrelfish at French Frigate Shoals\nFile:Deep Reef Endemic Species Pearl & Hermes Atoll.jpg| Pearl and Hermes Atoll: red tail wrasse, Thompson's anthias, Potter's angelfish, Hawaiian squirrelfish, chocolate-dip chromis, masked angelfish, and bluestripe butterflyfish\nFile:Sanc1310 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|School of sea chubs\nFile:Holotype of Tosanoides obama immediately prior to collection.jpg|Obama's basslet\nFile:Reef0747 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|Bigeye emperor\nFile:Corl0097 (27497432204).jpg|Titan scorpionfish\nFile:Green Sea Turtle (43781715354).jpg|Green sea turtle\nFile:Green sea turtles at French Frigate Shoals.jpg|Sea turtles basking\nFile:PMNM baby green sea turtles (50199588421).jpg|Baby green sea turtles\nFile:PMNM - Birds on French Frigate Shoals (27369203434).jpg|Red-footed boobies nesting\nFile:Laysanente (Anas laysanensis), weiblich mit Küken.jpg|Laysan duck with ducklings\nFile:Papahanaumokuakea marine National Monument, Gallinule, Hawaii.jpg|Hawaiian gallinule\nFile:Starr 080531-4714 Lobularia maritima.jpg|Laysan albatross at Midway Atoll, Sand Island\nFile:Starr-130916-1902-Ipomoea pes caprae subsp brasiliensis-habit with Laysan Finch on guano pile-SE Inland-Laysan (25226152355).jpg|Laysan Finch on guano pile\nFile:Nihoa finch USFWS.jpg|Nihoa finch\nFile:PMNM Green Sea Turtles and Masked Boobies (48779188876).jpg|Green sea turtles and masked boobies\nFile:PMNM - Laysan Albatross Mother And Chick (33883108450).jpg|Laysan albatross mother and chick\nFile:Acrocephalus familiaris -Laysan, Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, USA-8 (1) (cropped).jpg|Nihoa millerbird\nFile:Hawaiian monk seals on Midway Atoll (52233909629).jpg|Hawaiian monk seals on Midway Atoll\nFile:Spinner dolphins video.wmv.OGG|Spinner dolphins\nFile:Anim2619 (34590655782).jpg|Bryde's whale\nFile:Sanc1297 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|Hawaiian monk seals\nResearch\nAn  expedition to the Kure Atoll in 2010 sent divers to a depth of , revealing new species of coral and other animals. Waikiki Aquarium cultured the new coral species. A species of seaweed was discovered in 2019 that was killing large patches of coral. A 2020 study reported that the MPA acted as a tuna nursery. Near the reserve the yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) catch increased by 54% between 2016 and 2019 and the bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) take increased by 12%. The catch increased the most at 115 to 230 miles from the area boundaries.\nUnderwater wrecks\nThe area of the Monument is home to upwards of 80 shipwrecks and hundreds of submerged aircraft. Divers found the wreck of the USNS Mission San Miguel (T-AO-129) within the Monument in 2015. She had sunk there on October 8, 1957, when she ran aground on Maro Reef while running at full speed and in ballast. The Battle of Midway National Memorial is also part of the Monument. The wreck of the Imperial Japanese Navy aircraft carrier , which sank during World War II in the Battle of Midway on June 4, 1942, was found within the Monument by the research vessel  in 2019. The wreck of USS Yorktown is also in the Monument.\n*\n}}\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n* NOAA: [http://www.papahanaumokuakea.gov/ Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument]\n** USFWS: [http://www.fws.gov/refuge/hawaiian_islands/ Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge]\n** USFWS: [https://www.fws.gov/refuge/midway_atoll/ Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge]\n* UNESCO: [https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1326 World Heritage Site profile for Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument]\n* [https://artsandculture.google.com/story/1wVREBNllE1hgg Papahānaumokuākea] UNESCO Collection on Google Arts and Culture\n* [https://www.facebook.com/Papahanaumokuakea/ Facebook.com: Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument ]\n* USFWS: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/usfwspacific/sets/72157624901836106/ Flickr: FWS photo gallery] – Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument images.\n}}"
