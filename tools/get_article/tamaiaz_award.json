It sought to drive Emiratisation and \"help fill the gap between academic education and the job market by empowering [young Emiratis] to enter the market and guiding them on how to convert their innovative ideas into reality.\"\nUAE national students or recent graduates under 25 years of age, pursuing an education in the UAE or abroad can apply. The winners get cash prizes between AED 5,000 and AED 20,000 (1 USD = AED 3.67).
