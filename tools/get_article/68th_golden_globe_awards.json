DeMille Award\nRobert De Niro\nMiss Golden Globe\nGia Mantegna (daughter of Joe Mantegna & Arlene Mantegna)\nCriticism\nThe three nominations for The Tourist were criticized since the film previously received negative reviews from critics and was nominated in the Musical or Comedy categories despite the fact that it was sold as a thriller film. The nominations for Burlesque, another film with bad reviews, also received outrage after news surfaced that the film's distributor, Sony, had treated Golden Globe voters to an all-expenses-paid trip to Las Vegas, culminating in a concert by Cher, one of the film's stars.\nRicky Gervais's job as host was also met with criticism regarding his roasting of the stars in attendance particularly Mel Gibson, Robert Downey Jr., Bruce Willis, and Angelina Jolie. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association even wrote, \"his blunt one-liners targeting big-name celebrities caused anger and resentment in some quarters.\"\nSee also\n* Hollywood Foreign Press Association\n* 83rd Academy Awards\n* 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards\n* 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards\n* 17th Screen Actors Guild Awards\n* 64th British Academy Film Awards\n* 31st Golden Raspberry Awards\n* 65th Tony Awards\n* 2010 in film\n* 2010 in American television\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
