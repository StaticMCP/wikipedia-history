According to Nick Zentner of Central Washington University Department of Geological Sciences, \"Canadian rocks [are] strewn all over the Puget lowland, stretching from the Olympic Peninsula clear over to the Cascade Range.\" Erratics can be found at altitudes up to about  in the Enumclaw area, along with kames, drumlins, and perhaps also the unique Mima mounds. The soil of Seattle, the county's (and state's) largest city, is approximately 80% glacial drift, most of which is Vashon glacial deposits (till), and nearly all of the city's major named hills are characterized as drumlins (Beacon Hill, First Hill, Capitol Hill, Queen Anne Hill) or drift uplands (Magnolia, West Seattle). Boulders greater than 3 meters in diameter are \"rare\" in the Vashon till, but can be found, as seen in the table below.\nList of boulders\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Name and description !!

The lake is a kettle lake also due to glaciation. In the 1950s otters would reportedly rest on the large erratic at the north end of Beaver Lake.\n|\n|\n|-\n|style=\"width:30em;vertical-align:top;\"|Big Rock is an  tall glacial erratic in the city of Duvall. A Duvall road, a park, and several businesses are named after it. The rock, and two non-native sequoias adjacent to it probably planted by area pioneers, are a local landmark. The erratic lies in what is said to be the smallest King County park,  in extent, that barely contains the rock and sequoias. The two lanes of Big Rock Road used to split into a wye around the rock, until a shopping center was built nearby in the 1990s.\n|}}\n|\n|-\n|style=\"width:30em;vertical-align:top;\"|Big Rock Park erratic is a glacial erratic in the eponymous city park in Sammamish. Sammamish considered naming the park \"Bigger Rock Park\" to distinguish it from the identically named park in Duvall.\n|}}\n|\n|-\n|style=\"width:30em;vertical-align:top;\"|Cascadia College erratic\nSaved from destruction by sit-in conducted by Cascadia College environmental politics students, and relocated away from construction site. The rock, which several students occupied during the sit-in, was about 2 meters across before being jackhammered to two thirds its original size.\n|}}\n|\n|-\n|style=\"width:30em;vertical-align:top;\"|Des Moines Beach erratic near Des Moines Beach Park in Des Moines\n|}}\n|\n|-\n|style=\"width:30em;vertical-align:top;\"|Discovery Park beach erratics\nFour or more erratics on beach below Discovery Park.

It has had a navigational light placed on it and appears on nautical charts.\nNative Americans called the rock LE'plEpL, also written La'pub, and also called it Tele'tla (meaning \"rock\"). A legend says that a hero named Sta'kub could throw a giant cedar and hazel branch dragnet over the rock while standing at the beach.\n|}}\n|\n|-\n|style=\"width:30em;vertical-align:top;\"|Highline College erratic.
