On 8 June 1524, Alvarado fought and defeated Cuzcatlan fighters under Atlácatl at the Battle of Acajutla.\nBattle\nOn 13 June 1524, Alvarado engaged Atlácatl in a second battle at Tacuzcalco. Atlácatl's army was larger than the army he commanded at Acajutla and Alvarado stated that seeing the size of Atlácatl's was \"terrifying.\" Following the battle, Alvarado described the outcome as a \"great massacre\" and \"punishment\" of the Pipil warriors.\nAftermath\nAfter the defeat at the hands of the Spanish, the Pipil refused to engage the Spanish in open battle, instead resorting to guerrilla tactics to fight the Spanish. After further campaigning, Alvarado and his men returned to Guatemala in July 1524.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
