      "text": "# Vice President of Niger\n\nThe vice president of Niger (French: Vice-président du Niger) is an ad hoc governmental position in Niger. There is no provision for a vice president in the Constitution of Niger and the position has only existed under military regimes. The country has had four vice presidents to-date, including the incumbent Salifou Modi, who, like the previous three, has been appointed by the military regime.\nVice Presidents\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!
