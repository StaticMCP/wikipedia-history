With regard to cultural influences, prior to the expansion of the British Empire, the island had been most notably influenced by French culture (via the Normans), Scandinavian culture (via the Vikings) and Italian culture (via the Romans).\nThe arrival of Celtic and Germanic tribes influenced Britain's early development. The Celtic peoples introduced unique languages, traditions, and social structures. The ancient Roman occupation of Britain, lasting almost 400 years, also impacted the linguistic and cultural identity of Great Britain. Subsequently, the migrations of Germanic tribes, such as the Anglo-Saxons, further influenced the cultural landscape.\nMedieval era\nModern era\nBritish Empire\nThe British Empire played an ever-increasing role in British life from the late 18th century onwards, as the economic impact and travel opportunities of colonialism saw greater British integration into the world. These encounters with the world had a debated impact on the formation of British national identity. British culture dispersed across the world and was absorbed into the colonies in various ways, some of which gradually undermined and eventually helped to disband the empire.\nIndustrial Revolution\nWorld Wars\nContemporary era\nThroughout the imperial era and with the decline of the British Empire after World War II, Britain developed a more diverse cultural landscape through higher levels of immigration. The decline of imperial power also impacted society and culture; for example, cricket, which had been the most popular British sport for centuries and which had become identified with the imperial vision, lost ground to football.\nAfter the war ended, a sense of ease returned to society, though quality of life was still somewhat low in the 1950s. Television and Americanisation led to greater cultural fluidity as well as fears of change. The social history of the nation also began to be studied more intensely.\nPost-Cold War\nFollowing the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and EU enlargement in 2004 and 2007, the UK experienced a significant rise in immigration from Eastern Europe. Today, the UK has a sizable immigrant population, and encompasses the cultures of British people from various backgrounds, with South Asian, Continental European, African and Caribbean descent being most prevalent.\nSee also\n*\nReferences"
