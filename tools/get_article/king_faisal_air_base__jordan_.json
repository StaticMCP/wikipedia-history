The base was officially opened by King Hussein of Jordan on 24 June 1981.\nA 1983 report indicated that the base was used to assemble parts of Chinese Shenyang J-6 fighter aircraft for subsequent delivery to Iraq.\nIn 1987, Syrian president Hafez al-Assad and Iraqi president Saddam Hussein flew to the base to have a meeting in the nearby town Al-Jafr amidst the Iran–Iraq War.\nIn October 1996, the airfield was used by an Antonov An-124 to fly in the ThrustSSC jet car for testing in the desert near Al-Jafr.\nOn 4 November 2016, a Jordanian guard shot and killed three American soldiers and wounded another while they were returning to the base. The 39-year-old Jordanian assailant was sentenced to life in prison for the murders.\nExercises\nduring Exercise Bright Star '87 at the base.]]\nThe base frequently hosts military exercises, a practice going back as far as the 1980s.
