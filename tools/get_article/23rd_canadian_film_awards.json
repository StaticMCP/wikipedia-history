The ceremony, which had been returned to banquet format, was hosted by actor Leslie Nielsen and broadcaster Charlotte Gobeil.\nFor this year's competition, 149 films were entered, but Quebec independent filmmakers refused to submit their films, citing \"lack of interest\" and taking issue with the insufficient representation of Montreal in the awards committee. The result was that, with the exception of films from the National Film Board of Canada, all awarded films were English-language.\nWinners\nFilms\n*Film of the Year: Not awarded\n*Best Picture: Mon oncle Antoine (My Uncle Antoine) — National Film Board of Canada, Marc Beaudet producer, Claude Jutra director\n*Documentary Under 30 Minutes: The Sea — National Film Board of Canada, Bill Brind, Tom Daly and Colin Low producers, Bané Jovanovic director\n*Documentary Over 30 Minutes: Les Philharmonistes — National Film Board of Canada, François Séguillon producer, Yves Leduc director\n*Theatrical Short: 'Don't Knock the Ox — National Film Board of Canada, William Canning producer, Tony Ianzelo director\n*Animated: Evolution — National Film Board of Canada, Michael Mills producer and director\n*Arts and Experimental: Essai à la mille' (Test to the Thousand) — Jean-Claude Labrecque, and\n::Found Sculpture: Viktor Tinkl — ETV, Christopher Homer\n*TV Drama: The Megantic Outlaw — Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Ron Kelly producer and director\n*TV Information: The Human Journey: The Early Years — Films Incorporated and CTV Television Network, Jerry Lawton producer and director\n*Nature and Wildlife: Temples of Time — National Film Board of Canada, William Canning producer and director\n*Travel and Recreation: Alberta: Under the Sun — Chinook Films, C.
