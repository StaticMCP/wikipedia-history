It was last assigned to the Central Flying Training Command, and was disbanded on 13 October 1946 at the Randolph Field, Texas.\nThere is no lineage between the United States Air Force 32d Composite Wing, established on 22 November 1940 as the 32d Pursuit Group (Fighter) at Rio Hato Army Airbase, Panama, and this organization.\nHistory\nThe wing was a World War II Command and Control organization which supported Training Command Basic Flight Schools.   At the schools, Phase II Basic Pilot Training taught the cadets to fly in formation, fly by instruments or by aerial navigation, fly at night, and fly for long distances. Cadets got about 70 flight hours in trainers before being promoted to Advanced Training.\nLineage\n* Established as 32d Flying Training Wing on 17 December 1942.\n: Activated on 16 January 1943\n: Disbanded on 13 October 1946\nAssignments\n* Army Air Forces Gulf Coast Training Center, 16 January 1943\n: Re-designated: Central Flying Training Command, 31 July 1943-13 October 1946.\nTraining aircraft\nThe primary aircraft used was the Vultee BT-13 Valiant twin-seat, single engine trainer.
