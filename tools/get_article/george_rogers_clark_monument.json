Erected in November 1921, the monument consisted of seven figures, created by sculptor Robert Ingersoll Aitken, all positioned on the same pedestal. It was the last of four works commissioned from members of the National Sculpture Society by philanthropist Paul Goodloe McIntire between 1919 and 1924. The sculpture was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.\nThe monument measured approximately 24 feet in height, 20 feet in length, and 8 feet in width. It included a tall bronze figure of George Rogers Clark mounted on a stallion in the center. The pedestal bore the inscription: \"/ .\"\nThe University of Virginia removed the monument on July 11, 2021. Although no immediate plans for what would be done with it were announced, the university stated it would consult with its students and members of the American Indian community of Charlottesville regarding its disposition.\nSee also\n*Charlottesville historic monument controversy\n**Equestrian statue of Stonewall Jackson (Charlottesville, Virginia)\n**Meriwether and William Clark Lewis (sculpture)\n**Robert E.
