Schwartz has supported the LGBT community through local and national lectures on the importance of LGBT couples protecting their families through second parent adoption and estate planning. She writes about issues concerning the LGBT community for the Huffington Post.\nSchwartz is featured in The Day It Snowed In Miami (2014) a 2014 Emmy-nominated documentary that traces the political activism behind an equal-rights statute in Miami.\nElizabeth received her Bachelor of Arts from the University of Pennsylvania in 1993 and her Juris Doctor, cum laude, from the University of Miami in 1997. She started practicing law in 1997.\nElizabeth Schwartz was born in Miami Beach and currently lives with her wife, writer Lydia Martin, in Miami, FL.\nPublications\n*\"LGBT Issues in Surrogacy\" in the Handbook of Gestational Surrogacy, ed.
