The community had its own post office between 1875 and 1968. It was established as a civic address community in 2000.\nNotable documented family histories include that of the [https://www.islandregister.com/myershistory.html Myers family] and [https://www.saltwire.com/prince-edward-island/lifestyles/new-genealogy-book-focuses-on-ferguson-family-that-came-to-pei-443598/ Ferguson family].\nIn 2002, Peter Bevan-Baker, who later became the Leader of the Official Opposition, settled in Hampton after moving from Scotland via Ontario.\n“Ellen’s Diary, by an Island Farmer’s Wife” was a regular column written by Margaret MacQuarrie Dixon that was featured in The Guardian newspaper from 1945 to 1963. Margaret also later detailed her childhood on a farm in Hampton, PEI, and her first years as a school teacher in “Going Home” (Willams & Crue, Summerside PEI, 1979).\nIn 1907, a siting of “Hampton’s Phantom Ship” was reported by two residents of Charlottetown. This siting is embedded in a larger story of the Ghost Ship of Northumberland Strait.\nBusinesses\n* A Kennedy & Co.
