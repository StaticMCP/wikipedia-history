A 6'4\" guard from Indiana University, Edwards played in only four games for the Clippers in his NBA career. He also played overseas for a few seasons.\nHe entered the NBA after playing only two seasons for the Hoosiers. During his sophomore year at Indiana, he averaged 20.0 points per game and once held the school record for 20 consecutive games with a three-pointer [https://web.archive.org/web/20070311174713/http://iuhoosiers.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/013098aab.html], leading the Hoosiers to the 1989 Big Ten title. Edwards was the Big Ten Freshman of the Year in 1988 and an All-American in 1989.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060830194837/http://www.college-bowlgame-tickets.com/Indiana_Hoosiers.html]\nWhen Edwards was in high school in Marion, Indiana, he and his teammate, Lyndon Jones, led the Marion Giants to three consecutive state championships. The three-peat was known in Indiana as the \"Purple Reign\" referring to the schools colors of purple and gold. In 1987 Edwards shared the title of Indiana's \"Mr. Basketball\" award along with Jones. Edwards and Jones would also play together for two years at Indiana University.\nIn high school, Jay was given the nickname \"Silk\" for his gracefully smooth jump shot.\nEdwards continues to hold the NCAA freshman single-season record for three-point field goal shooting percentage (53.6%).\nNotes"
