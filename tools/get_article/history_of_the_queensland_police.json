      "text": "# History of the Queensland Police\n\nThe history of the Queensland Police Service in Queensland, Australia, commenced in 1864, five years after the Separation of Queensland from New South Wales in 1859. This timeline highlights significant developments in Queensland policing.\n1860s\nThe uniform worn by Queensland police officers after separation in 1859 was a dark blue jacket and top with a forage cap, supplied by the New South Wales police.\n1864\nThe Queensland Police Force was established by the Queensland Government on 1 January 1864 with strength of 287 officers serving a population of 61,467. David Thompson Seymour appointed as Acting Commissioner and later as Commissioner.\nTransport in the settled areas was mainly by foot and in the unsettled areas by horse.\nThe hulk Margaret Eliza was purchased for £3000. It was refitted and renamed the Proserpine. She was used as a floating water police office, prison, and later as a reformatory school.\nCorrespondence with the Police Commissioner or between stations was by handwritten letter, moved by horse or Cobb and Co stagecoach, or by telegram.\nFinding that no written instructions had ever been issued for the guidance of the police, Commissioner Seymour issues \"Rules for the General Government and Discipline of members of the Police Force of Queensland\" based upon the Victorian police model.\nOn 1 December, the Detective Office was created with Sub-Inspector George Elliott in charge.\nAt December 1864, in the first year of operation of the Queensland Police Force, there were 27 ordinary police stations with 151 foot and mounted officers, and 16 native police camps of 136 European officers and indigenous troopers. Twenty of the 'ordinary police force' stations averaged four officers each, the bigger stations like Brisbane, Ipswich, Rockhampton and Maryborough had larger staff numbers. Native police camps averaged between 7 and 17 men, large camps like Rockhampton could have up to 27 men of both officers and troopers.\n1865\nPolice Commissioner David Seymour described the lack of accommodation for police: \"Many men are compelled to live in lodgings, and in the country districts constables live in public-houses some distance from the lock-up at times making them unavailable for sudden emergencies\".\nPolice Commissioner Seymour focussed on the crime of bushranging and took active measures to hasten the capture of these criminals through the purchase of fresh police horses and the construction of securely fenced paddocks at every police station.\nWater police were stationed on board the hulk Proserpine at the mouth of the Brisbane River.\nRevolvers were supplied to every police station and 50 breech-loading carbines were delivered to the Department.\n1866\nThe Bread or Blood riot started, threatening the sacking of Government House in Brisbane. Hundreds of government officials were sworn in as special constables to assist police.\nThe first uniform consisted of a Garibaldi jacket of dark blue, serge wool cloth, red facings, and shoulder knot; trousers of the same material, with red cord, and a high cap with French peak.\n1867\nOn 6 November 1867 Constable Patrick William Cahill and Constable John Francis Power were poisoned and shot in the head at the MacKenzie River Crossing while escorting a consignment of bank notes and bullion from Rockhampton to Clermont. The first major test for the Detective Office was to solve their murders.\nPolice Commissioner Seymour stated that \"men at all stations are, when practicable, to be drilled once a week\".\n1869\nThe publication of \"Rules for the General Government and Discipline of members of the Police Force of Queensland\" was approved, printed and distributed.\nEach constable required one pair of handcuffs as part of his equipment allotment.\n1870s\nNavy blue helmets were introduced and proved to be a very hot choice of headwear; they were phased out in favour of white helmets in 1896.\n1870\nA police barracks was established in George Street, Brisbane, on the site of the old convict hospital.\nChanges to rank insignia were implemented which among other things meant that an acting sergeant would be called a senior constable.\n1872\nA general order was issued that the Chinese had as much right on the gold fields as Europeans, so long as they had a miners' permit. If a collision resulted in a riot which the police could not quell, they were to note the ring-leaders and apprehend them.\n1873\nSub-Inspector Robert Johnstone, officer in charge of native police, accompanied explorer George Dalrymple on the north-east coast expedition to explore the coastal lands as far as Cooktown.\n(hands in pockets)]]\n1875\nThe bulk of the Queensland Police force moved from the Brisbane CBD to Victoria Barracks and occupies the army buildings on site.\nThree movable houses and twelve large frame-tents were built in Brisbane and shipped to the Palmer River gold-field. They were quickly erected by two constables and could house six officers.\n1876\nThe Police Manual instructed constables on beat duty to \"possess such knowledge of the inhabitants of each house as to enable them to recognise their persons; and thus prevent mistakes, and be enabled to render assistance, when called upon, to the inhabitants\".\n\"Instructions for the Guidance of the Police\" were published and a system of competitive examination for promotion was introduced, intended to increase police efficiency.\n1877\nLaura Police Station opened in 1877 with Sub-Inspector 1/c Hervey Fitzgerald in charge. As at 2019, it was still a single officer station today and was staffed by a senior constable.\n1879\nRoma Street Police Barracks were built and provided accommodation for about forty-five men, room for an Officer-in-Charge and two cells.\nA contingent of trackers was sent to Victoria to assist in the hunt for the Kelly Gang.\n1880s\n1880\nAt Birdsville, locally available cane grass was used on police station walls for its insulation properties and longevity.\nNative Police camp accommodation was constructed using a variety of materials, such as saplings, logs, bark, canvas and shingles.\n1881\nOn 24 January Sub-Inspector George Dyas was found buried after being killed by being speared in the back by Aboriginals while he camped near the 40 Mile Waterhole near Normanton.\nOn 24 September Sub-Inspector Henry Kaye died from being speared through the chest by Aboriginals at Woolgar gold fields ( north of Richmond).\n1882\nSub-Inspector 1/c Alexander Douglas was sent to Herberton and with four troopers, two old gold diggers and five Chinese men; he blazed a trail from Herberton to Mourilyan. The party travelled without rations and in continuous rain for twenty days, living mainly on roots.\nMartini-Henry rifles were purchased to replace the Snider previously used.\n1883\nThe Petrie Terrace Gaol area was taken over by the Queensland Police and became known as the Petrie Terrace Police Depot where prospective police officers were trained.\nOn 24 January Cadet Sub-Inspector Mark Beresford died after being speared in the thigh and hit on the head by Aboriginals in the Selwyn Ranges to the south of Cloncurry.\nOn 26 January Constable William Dwyer was struck on the head by a tomahawk and killed by Wild Toby an Aboriginal bushranger, near Juandah Station via Taroom.\n1884\nCap badges consisting of a separate district letter and number were issued and remained in use until 1906.\nAs policing reached across the State more and more stations were opened usually in small towns of less than 300 people or in places that were growing due to the building of train lines or the discovery of gold. By December 1884, twenty years after the inauguration of the Police Force, there were 155 stations with 657 police officers and 182 indigenous troopers and trackers. There was also a growth in the number of single officer stations. In 1884, 36 stations were operated by single police officers, of these 6 were assisted in their duties by an indigenous tracker.\nRunning a police station with one officer was a daunting task. Often there was no station building and one had to be rented or moves made to purchase something suitable. Married officers were generally not sent to single officer stations as there was generally no accommodation for them in town. However, wives who did join their husbands, found themselves looking after the station and taking inquiries, while her husband was away. Her tasks could also involve feeding and cleaning up after prisoners in the lock-up.\n1886\nThe first six camels arrived in Birdsville from India in poor condition and by July only four had survived. Despite these early setbacks camels proved useful, travelling hundreds of kilometres on duties such as collecting statistical returns.\n1887\nThe first honour given to any Queensland police officer was a Royal Humane Society Bronze Medal awarded to Constable James O\"Brien for saving the life of a nine-year-old boy at Ipswich.\nDuring the Burketown cyclone on 5 March, Sergeant John Ferguson's wife kept a lamp burning in the window of the courthouse and her beacon drew many people to the refuge during the storm.\n1889\nA Royal Commission of Enquiry into the Police Force proposed sweeping changes including that the control of the section of Water Police known as River Police was given back to the Police Commissioner.\nThe cost of buying ordinary clothing for plain clothes work was an extra burden that detectives had to meet out of their ordinary pay.\nThere were eleven detectives on the pay-roll across the State. Seven in Brisbane, two in Townsville, and one each in Normanton and Rockhampton.\nOn 27 October Senior Constable Alfred Wavell was shot and killed at Corinda (southwest of Burketown) by a man who had escaped from the Normanton lock-up.\n1890s\n1891\nSenior Sergeant Martin Breene and Constable Joseph Waters displayed energy and perseverance during the shearer's strikes by following and preventing \"fire gangs\" from doing damage at Lammermoor pastoral station.\nEromanga Police Station was first opened on 26 September 1891 in a two roomed cottage rented at a cost of five shillings per week, with Senior Constable Manuell in charge. At this time the township consisted of one large store owned by Mr W Paterson, two first class pubs built of brick, and a couple of \"humpys\". The resident population was about 20 and there was always a number of men from the opal mines and stations \"knocking down their cheques\" (spending their money) at Eromanga's pubs. Senior Constable Manuell remained in charge of Eromanga until he was instructed to close this station on 31 December 1891, and to proceed to Thargomindah. The station reopened in 1893. In 1894, the first police residence was built so the police officer have his wife live with him. As at 2019, it was still a single officer station and was staffed by a senior constable.\n1893\nDuring the shearer's strike, police were given sole power to \"preserve order and secure liberty to all alike\".\nActing Sergeant John Raphael Thompson was paid £10 extra to attend to photographic work which included mug shots and crime scene photography.\nOn 4 February Constable James Sangster, 25, drowned attempting a rescue of two members of the Jackson family during the 1893 flood of the Bremer River at North Ipswich. He is commemorated by the James Sangster Memorial at North Ipswich, which was initiated by the Jackson family and funded by public subscription. The monument has a broken obelisk which symbolises a life cut short.\nMacKinlay (now McKinlay) Police Station was opened in 1893.\n1894\nOn 10 May Constable Benjamin Ebbitt died at South Brisbane having never recovered from an assault during an arrest on 9 November 1890 at Croydon.\nOn 6 September Constable Edward Lanigan was killed by being shot in the chest while trying to prevent another policeman from being shot during an arrest at Montalbion (a mining town near Irvinebank).\n1895\nOn 30 June, Commissioner Seymour retired after 31 years in the job and was replaced by William Edward Parry-Okeden on 1 July. Full control of the water police finally came under the jurisdiction of Police Commissioner.\nOn 2 July Senior Constable William Conroy died after being stabbed several times trying to prevent a man from stabbing the man's wife on Thursday Island.\nThe Roma Street police station telephone exchange was connected to fourteen sites including the Woolloongabba and South Brisbane police stations, the Commissioner's house at Red Hill, the Detective Office, the Police Depot and the Central Fire Brigade Station.\n1896\nThe bicycle, as a means of transport was introduced and a slow distribution occurred across the State. At about £13 a bicycle was more expensive than a horse.\nDetectives received no special training. Generally, \"the smartest and most intelligent\" people from among the plain clothes officers in the general police were selected and expected to learn from experience.\nThe Pearl ferry capsized near the Victoria Bridge on the flooded Brisbane River on Valentine's Day. After the rescue of sixty survivors, police made every effort to recover and identify the bodies of the twenty-nine victims.\nA loose tunic was adopted in place of the existing jumper for police uniform. Mounted officers performing mounted duty, wore Bedford cord breeches and black napoleon boots.\n1897\nThe collection housed in the police museum running since 1893, was used to educate recruits about criminal methods.\n1899\nOn the trail of an escapee, Constable James Kenny and four indigenous troopers survived Cyclone Mahina at Bathurst Bay, by staying together after their camp was blown away.\nThe recruit probation period was increased so that no man was sworn until three months' drill and instruction was completed at the Police Depot.\nEnglesburg police station was opened on 25 April 1899. The town's name was changed to Kalbar in September 1916 due to anti-German sentiment in World War I.\n1900s\n1900\nAt the turn of the century the Queensland Police Department had 845 police officers and 135 native trackers at 256 stations.\n1901\nFirst-Class Constable George Pugh displayed discretion and bravery in the single-handed arrest of three men for the unlawful killing of cattle at the Jundah Opal Fields, and for taking them on foot, the  to Jundah police station.\nThe Criminal Investigation Branch moved into the old St John's Cathedral synod building on the corner of Elizabeth and George Streets.\n1902\nThe Imperial Service Order and Medal was established by King Edward for the administration and clerical staff of the Civil Service throughout the British Empire for long and meritorious service.\nOn 30 March, Constable George Doyle was shot and killed while attempting to capture the Kenniff brothers in Upper Warrego, who had a long history of stealing cattle and horses.\n1903\nIn May the Bronze Medal of the Royal Humane Society was awarded to First-class Michael Becher, Inspector Percy Galbraith, Constables Charles Pinwill and William Ryan who risked their own lives to save the lives of others between 12 November 1889 and 15 January 1903.\nOn 29 March Acting Sergeant David Johnston was killed by being hit on the head with an axe by a prisoner in the watchhouse at Mackay.\n1904\nThe Fingerprint Bureau was established.

She was capable of .\nConstable Charles Watson and a tracker followed suspected murderer J. W. Patterson for . They captured the fugitive but had very little food or water for the last  of the chase.\nA new Figure-of-8 style handcuff was introduced.\nIn 1907, Police Commissioner William Cahill and the Deputy Queensland Government Architect, designed the Queensland Police Station badge based on the police cap badge of the time. Prior to this time, there was no standard way to indicate a police station.\n1909\nA very fine  reserve called Rewan was proclaimed as a stud farm for breeding police horses. The Woodford mares and foals as well as two purchased stallions, \"Libertine\" and \"Mack\" populated the reserve.\nVery few police stations have a typewriter and some officers use their own to complete reports and correspondence.\nThe King's Police Medal was instituted by King Edward VII on 7 July to be awarded to those officers of properly recognised police forces and fire brigades under the jurisdiction of the sovereign, who showed distinguished service and conspicuous devotion to duty, or who carried out heroic acts of courage. First awarded to Constable John Bourke on 29 August 1911.\nThe good will of the community was necessary if an officer was to be able to carry out his duties effectively while in town and to then to be confident that nothing untoward would happen while he was away checking the rest of his beat by horse. Communities were often loath to let an officer go when he was transferred away and often took up petitions and wrote letters to the Police Commissioner begging for the officer to remain in town. Long standing officers were often presented with gifts and highly decorated letters of thanks from their community. When Sergeant Lawrence Clare was transferred in March 1909, the citizens of the Esk District expressed their thanks:To\nSergeant L. J. Clare\nTogether with a Purse of Forty Sovereigns\nFrom his many friends in the Esk Police District\nDear Sir\nWe, the residents of Esk and District, desire to approach you with the purest sentiments of congratulation at the close of your most efficient service of Ten Years as Constable and Sergeant in charge of our large District. Those who have been associated with you will long cherish your courtesy and untiring zeal in carrying out at all times your official duties with credit to yourself and the Department in which you are engaged. In presenting you with the accompanying gift we are deeply sensible that it is in no sense an adequate measure of your excellent qualities and labours; nor do we wish you to regard it in the light of a recompense but ask you to accept it as a mark of our regard.

The FSG processes in excess 150,000 requests for service and positively identifies or links several thousand suspects to their crime each year.\nThe mobile data pilot for smartphones and tablets, dubbed QLiTEs, was rolled in October as part of the move to provide the technology required by police to keep the community safe.\nAt the Queensland Police Excellence Awards, Southern Region wins the Gold Lantern Award for Excellence in Problem-Oriented and Partnership for their \"Stay on Track Outback\" initiative which aims to enhance road safety on the rural and remote highways of outback Queensland.\nNew uniform material was approved which is lighter in weight and more breathable. The cloth is treated with a flash dry and incorporates a percentage of stretch for comfort and ease.\nFollowing the Police and Community Safety Review (PaCSR) report delivered September 2013, commissioned by the Newman Ministry of the Queensland Government, the Public Safety Business Agency (PSBA) was created on 1 November 2013 to bring together the corporate and business support resources of Queensland Police Service and the Department of Corrective Services, to service the whole portfolio.  This involved human relations, information technology, finance and other administrative areas being subsumed by the new agency.\nThere were more than 450 police establishments spread across the State.\n2014\nThe department celebrated their 150th anniversary.  A unit citation was awarded to all employees.\n2016\nFollowing a review, the Public Safety Business Agency (PSBA) was restructured in July 2016, which also resulted in some restructure of the Queensland Police Service.\n2017\nOn 29 May 2017, Senior Constable Brett Forte was shot and killed at Adare, north of Gatton, after attempting to apprehend a suspected offender. The gunman was shot and killed the next day by police while trying to escape after a siege in a farmhouse at Ringwood, north-west of Gatton. On 8 June 2018, the police helicopter  2 was named Brett A. Forte in his honour. POLAIR 2 had provided air support during the siege.  Coronial findings in March 2023 found there may have been some contributing systematic organisational factors, including failing to follow up on earlier reports of firearm activity in the area, and a 'significant failure of leadership' to assign a tactical commander during the pursuit.\n2019\nKatarina Carroll became the twentieth Police Commissioner in July 2019 and its first female police commissioner. She joined the police service in 1983.\n2020s\n2020\nIn February 2020 a new organisational restructure (since the November 2013 and July 2016 restructures) was announced as the 'Service Alignment Program', including designating a deputy commissioner for north Queensland, and the dividing of the Northern Region into two.  The program was 'to better align resources based on capability and service delivery', and to continue 'to move towards a policing model that is focussed on prevention, disruption, investigation and response'.  The  frontline service delivery mode was closed down in May 2023, and was never rolled out statewide.\nFrom March 2020, employees of the organisation were heavily involved in supporting Queensland Health in a response to containing the spread of COVID-19 pandemic within Queensland, on the state borders, airports, and checking persons self-quarantining.\nThe $52.8 million Bob Atkinson Operational Capabilities Centre (BAOCC) at the developing Wacol campus of the Queensland Police Service Academy opened on 28 September 2020.  The facility included two indoor firearms ranges as well as a Hogan's Alley of a train station platform, houses, pub, post office, fast food outlet, shopping mall, a multi-storey office and retail building, service station, police station, bus stop, mobile caravan village, and open parkland.\n2021\nFollowing the death of a couple at Alexandra Hills Brisbane on 26 January 2021 involving a 17-year-old male alleged to be on drugs and on bail, youth using a stolen vehicle trying to ram police vehicle in Townsville on 30 January 2021, and the death of a motorcycle rider by persons pursuing a stolen vehicle on 5 February 2021, the Commissioner in days after announced the creation of a new 'Youth Crime Taskforce' headed by an assistant commissioner.\nFollowing the death of a woman by her ex-partner, the Domestic, Family Violence and Vulnerable Persons Command was established in February 2021, relocated and promoted to command level, from another command.\nMay 2021 saw the release of the Crime and Corruption Commission report into a 50% female police recruit hiring target.  Put in place in 2015 by then-Commissioner Stewart, an ambiguity as to whether this was a direction or 'aspirational target', the investigation found the practices to be discriminatory and 'corrupt manipulation'.  The practice was ceased in January 2018.\n2022\nOn 11 May, the State Government announced a commission of inquiry to examine policing responses to domestic and family violence (DFV) prevention, with possible systemic cultural issues within the organisation, and whether there was the capability, capacity, and structure to respond to the violence.  This followed the recommendations of a domestic violence taskforce and several coronial inquests.  After a reluctance to appear, Commissioner Carroll appeared before the Commission on Thursday, 19 August 2022, where misogynistic comments of a superintendent and a deputy commissioner were reported, disbelief in complaints to be genuine of sexual assaults by female complainants, and the staffing to the February 2021 renamed-and-relocated Domestic, Family Violence and Vulnerable Persons Command was increased by four members to total 27 staff whereas the media section had been increased to 38 staff.  One of the four deputy commissioners resigned on the Friday afternoon.\nIt was announced in late October 2022, that the Service would become the host of the State Emergency Service, and the Marine Rescue Service; these services devolving from the Queensland Fire and Emergency Service.\nOn Friday 10 November 2022, the Queensland Audit Office report was presented into the effectiveness of state public sector entities to handle DFV responses.  There were twenty-one recommendations, nine of which were to be actioned by the police service.  Recommendations including doing a root cause analysis into delayed response times by officers to DFV incidents, and mandatory annual face-to-face DFV training.\nSeparately on Monday 14 November 2022, the DFV Commission of Inquiry tabled its report to the Premier.  Highlighting problems of misogyny and racism, and lack of leadership, seventy-eight recommendations were made, including better demand recording systems, robust and regular training of officers, and establishing of an independent police integrity unit within the Crime and Corruption Commission to deal with all complaints in relation to police.\nA fifth deputy commissioner position was to be created after 1 December 2022.\nOn 12 December 2022, two officers were killed along with a neighbour, and two other officers attacked, by three armed members of the Train family at the Wieambilla police shootings, near Dalby, southern Queensland.  The officers had visited to make inquiries about one member of the Train family who had been reported as a missing person.\n2023\nFollowing issues in 2022 with recruiting and retention including cancelling a training intake, burdening daily paperwork, lack of confidence in the organisation's leadership, rising officer attrition of 3% to 5.5%, whilst relaxing recruiting standards, the Service in February 2023 sought to attract up to 500 officers from overseas jurisdictions per year over five years to boost recruitment.  (By November 2022, the Service had only recruited 401 of the 1450 police officer 2020 government pledge by 2025.  A November 2023 report by the Queensland Audit Office found the Service did not have a strategic planning for workforces and the growth target was not informed by evidence-based calls-for-service demands.)\nAs part of the addition of the SES and marine rescue, and recommendations from the various inquiries, and general administration, the organisational structure changed on 27 February 2023.  The deputy commissioner portfolios of Regional Queensland, and Southern Queensland became Regional Operations, and Regional Services.  Other senior portfolios were now Strategy and Corporate Services, Specialist Operations, Disaster and Emergency Management, State Discipline, and the Special Coordinator for police and emergency services reform.\nIn July 2023, the first 'Special Constable (State Officer)' was appointed and commenced at Longreach; the role legislated in April 2023 to address the mandatory police officer age retirement of sixty years-of-age by appointing retirees to continue with the same powers and authorities of regular officers.  The role was created in part to address attracting and retaining officers.\nIn October 2023, the Commissioner admitted the recruiting entry standards had been lowered, and recruit training had been extended from 6.5 to 8 months.  It was also noted increasing domestic violence calls (30% increase in the previous year), mental health jobs, and youth offending were escalating police workloads, and 50% of officers were considering separating in the next two years.\nWith many police-specific Queensland Honours, in the second half of the year the Service introduced two new medals, the Queensland Police Emergency Response Medal and the Queensland Police Blue Heart Medal.\n2024\nTo address recruiting issues, the state government offered incentives of up to A$20,000 towards HECS or HELP tertiary education fees, or A$20,000 for interstate and overseas officer applicants to relocate; additional to increased cost-of-living allowances and free Academy accommodation.  The 2023 recruitment marketing campaign, Challenging, Rewarding, Policing (replacing the previous ''We don't do boring''), resulted in the highest number of recruits in training, namely 683 recruits, at the Oxley and North Queensland campuses.  The campaign targeting New Zealand officers had the tagline 'warmer days and higher pays'.\nOn 19 February 2024, Commissioner Katarina Carroll announced an early separation of 1 March 2024, several months prior to contract expiry.  The Commissioner and government had been under pressure of youth offending, and responses to a 25% increase in domestic violence.\nOn 27 February 2024, the Supreme Court of Queensland ruled the 2021 Commissioner-mandated COVID-19 vaccinations of all police officers and staff members that there were no grounds under the Judicial Review Act 1991 (Qld) for unreasonableness, but breached the Human Rights Act 2019 (Qld) as proper consideration to human rights was not made.\nOn Monday 22 April 2024, Steve Gollschewski, a long-term deputy commissioner was confirmed as the twenty-first Commissioner, and immediately embarked on a coastal provincial tour with Police Minister Ryan and Premier Miles.  With Gold Coast's Polair [1] commencing as a trial in November 2011, Brisbane's 'Polair 2' commencing in July 2014, and Townsville's Polair launched on 16 January 2024, the tour saw the announcements of forthcoming funding for Polair in Cairns, and the Sunshine Coast/Wide Bay.\nOn Monday 3 June 2024, following the October 2022 review, the existing State Emergency Service (SES) and the newly named Marine Rescue Queensland (MRQ) commenced under the Service, in accordance with the State Emergency Service Act 2024 and Marine Rescue Queensland Act 2024 respectively.  With their own chief officers, the organisations are hosted by the Service; the SES previously under the Queensland Fire and Emergency Service (which on 1 July 2024 becomes the Queensland Fire Department under the Fire Services Act 1990).  MRQ was created as a consolidation of marine rescue volunteer associations, supported by the Australian Volunteer Coast Guard Association and Volunteer Marine Rescue Queensland.\nOn Tuesday 29 October 2024, with a days-old new government committing to an extra 1600 officers by 2028 (with a current 12 2000 officer strength), the Service indicated a possible multi-million dollar budget blow-out for the 2024–2025 financial year.  A core concern was an unfunded $166 million fifteen-year lease for a new Stones Corner police station at South Brisbane, followed by both an external financial audit into the circumstances, and a police self-referral to the Crime and Corruption Commission.  An executive staff member took leave on the same day the referral was announced. (The matter was still under investigation in October 2025.)\nThe Queensland Human Rights Commission diversity review into the Service found systemic discrimination towards women and First Nations people, after interviewing 2800 current and former employees, 'driven by outdated processes and attitudes', with a need for leadership.\n2025\nOn 11 February 2025 the Minister for Police, Dan Purdie, announced an independent review into the structure and operations of the Service, and placed promotions of senior officers on hold; whilst the new Commissioner has still to complete his first twelve months, at a time when Victoria Police officers put in a vote of no confidence on their Commissioner, followed by Northern Territory Correctional Services' Commissioner.  However, it was noted there was no terms of reference provided for the review, no official cabinet or ministerial statement released, had no diversity of membership (being conducted by three former Service senior officers), and was just another of many recent reviews: 2013 restructure by the then-Commissioner, 2019 external review indicating the restructure failed most performance criteria, 2022 commission of inquiry into police culture regarding domestic violence, the 2023 external review into the problematic 2021 Service Delivery Redesign Project, 2023 Queensland Audit Office report about resource deployment and narrow short-term focus, and the 2024 Queensland Human Rights Commission report.\nThe resulting 128-page review made 65 recommendations, found significant officer burn-out, limited wellbeing support, impeding non-core responsibilities, and high attrition among the younger-serving officers.  Another organisational restructure was going to be undertaken.
