The position typically involves representing the interests of a specific grade level or classroom, facilitating communication between students and school administration, and helping coordinate student-led events within a student council.\nThe practice of electing a class president is common in many countries worldwide.\nOverview\nClass presidents are usually elected by their peers within a single grade level. They often serve alongside a class cabinet—such as vice president, secretary, and treasurer—and may work in cooperation with a broader student council or student government organization. Their responsibilities vary by institution but often include promoting student activities & student engagement, addressing class concerns, and organizing events such as dances, fundraisers, or graduation activities.\nStudent council\nA student council is a representative body composed of students elected by their peers to address school-related matters and promote student interests. While structures vary by country and institution, student councils often include roles such as president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer. In many systems, the class president serves as a member or delegate within the broader council structure. The house system is a traditional feature of schools in the United Kingdom.\n, Victoria, with the names of the former school houses.]]\nTwo related but distinct bodies often exist: the student council, led by a student council president, and class committees, led by class presidents.\nThe student council/government/ASB, represents the entire student body and manages school-wide activities and policies. The student council president is supported by other student leaders. Class committees represent individual classes or grades, handling class-specific activities and concerns while cooperating with the student council.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Typical roles in student council and class committees\n!Role\n!Description\n!Typical Holder\n|-\n|Advisor\n|Oversees the committee and coordinates with administration\n|Teacher or Assistant Principal\n|-\n|President\n|Leads the student committee, representing the whole school or single grade/class\n|Student\n|-\n|Vice President\n|Assists the president and acts as deputy\n|Student\n|-\n|Secretary\n|Records meetings and handles documentation\n|Student\n|-\n|Treasurer\n|Manages finances and budgeting\n|Student\n|-\n|Committee Members\n|Organize specific events or tasks, such as fundraisers or dances\n|Student\n|}\nResponsibilities\nTypical duties of a class president include:\n* Leading class meetings and representing class opinions to faculty or school administration\n* Organizing student activities, such as spirit days, school assembly, student orientation or fundraising events\n* Coordinating class fundraising efforts, especially for senior year events such as school dances (sometimes Junior Prom), homecoming, prom or graduation\n* Acting as a liaison between students and school authorities\n* Promoting unity and school spirit within the class.\nSome schools also assign class presidents roles in managing class funds, overseeing student service initiatives, or contributing to school governance. The term of office for a class president is one year in most schools.  The student holding the office usually has the option of running again for the coming year.\nComparison with student body president\nUnlike a class president, a student body president (also called school president or student government president or associated student body (A.S.B) president) represents the entire student population across all grade levels. They are typically responsible for larger policy initiatives and school-wide leadership efforts. Working in the student lounge or student activity center\nSenior-class president\nThe senior class president specifically represents students in their final year of high school or college. They typically carry heightened responsibilities, including:\n* Planning graduation ceremonies and events\n* Organizing senior trips and farewell activities\n* Beginning alumni networking efforts\n* Coordinating future class reunions\nSchool Captain\nA school captain is a student appointed or elected to lead the student body of a school, usually in their final year. The role is similar to a student body president in the United States and represents students in interactions with faculty and the wider community. School captains are mainly found in British Empire legacy school systems: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, India, etc. In some schools, the captain may also hold the position of head prefect.\nThe role is less common in the United Kingdom, where Head Boy and Head Girl positions are more typical. Captains are often recognized by a badge or other symbol of office. They are usually responsible for representing the school at events, and will make public speeches. They also serve as a role model for students, and may share pupils' ideas with the school's leadership. They may also be expected to lead fellow prefects in their duties. In most cases, a deputy head boy and girl will be appointed to assist and deputise the head boy and girl. They may have to do charity events, speak in assemblies, help out in parents evenings, and open days.\nBy country\nJapan\nThe class system was introduced in Empire of Japan in 1885 (Meiji 18). It began to be implemented in large schools in the early 1880s.\nAfter the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, discussions on student participation and opinion rights increased, involving lawyers, educators, and forming tripartite councils among schools, guardians, and students. Student councils' roles expanded, although some declined.\nChina\nIn China, the head of a class is commonly known as the “class representative” (班代表) or “class leader” (班長). Additionally, there are often designated student officers for each academic subject.\nEurope\nSchools in other parts of Europe such as in Germany and Austria, secondary schools use the term \"student speaker\" (\"Schülersprecher\" in Germany, \"Schulsprecher\" in Austria) for schoolwide student representatives and \"class representative\" (\"Klassensprecher\") for classroom representatives. Similarly, the Netherlands high schools are using the term \"class representative\" (\"klassenvertegenwoordiger\")\nItaly\nIn Italy, the rappresentante d’istituto (institution representative) is an elected student who serves on the school's Consiglio d’Istituto (Institute Council), the main governing body of a secondary school. This role was introduced by the 1974 delegated education laws.\nThese representatives attend council meetings, voice student concerns, and may organize assemblies or activities. They also coordinate the Comitato studentesco,(student committee), made up of class representatives.\nElections are held annually, typically in October or November. Students vote using the D'Hondt method, and three or four representatives are elected, depending on school size. Terms last one year.\nPhilippines\nIn the Philippines, class presidents are part of a larger structure of student government recognized by the Department of Education. Elections are held annually, and class officers often coordinate activities, projects, and represent students at school-level assemblies.\nUnited Kingdom\nMany UK secondary schools operate a Student Council or similar body, typically composed of elected representatives from each form group and supported by members of the senior leadership team.\nIn some schools, students in Year 12 may apply or be nominated for senior student leadership roles. These may include a Head Boy and Head Girl, along with their deputies, collectively referred to as the Heads of School. Other schools may appoint a School Captain and Vice-Captain, either as alternative or additional titles''. The specific structure and responsibilities of these roles vary by institution.\nSelected students in the final year may also serve as prefects. Prefect systems differ across schools but often include roles such as Senior Prefect, Welfare Captain, and various specialist positions covering areas like sport, co-curricular involvement, public relations, or community service.\nSome schools maintain a Student Representative Council (SRC) made up of elected students. Peer support schemes are also common, where older students—often from Year 10—are assigned to help younger students, particularly those new to the school in Year 7.\nUnited States\nSchool council\nIn California, public schools that receive state or federal funding are required to establish a School Site Council (SSC), composed of parents, teachers, students, school administrators, and other staff. The SSC develops and monitors a school site plan, aligns the budget with categorical funds, and recommends the Single Plan for Student Achievement to the school board.\nThe SSC president, who may be a student, is elected by council members and can serve alongside a class president or student body president. Similar councils exist in other states, including Texas (Site-Based Decision-Making Committees), Kentucky (School-Based Decision Making Councils), and Illinois (Local School Councils), among others.\nIn popular culture\nThe stereotype of the class president has been featured prominently in books films, and television Common portrayals include the class president as a high-achieving, rule-following student—often either the socially popular figure or the academic underdog who unexpectedly claims the title. Since the early 20th century, the class presidency has also been used metaphorically in political allegory, including analogies for figures such as the president of the United States to roles for African-American women in the U.S. Congress.\nIn anime , manga , light novels, and video games set in school environments, student councils; and by extension, class presidents are frequently depicted, often wielding exaggerated levels of authority. These portrayals commonly reflect hierarchical structures or political satire within youth-centered storytelling.\nFictional class presidents\nNotable fictional characters who have held the title of class president include:\n* Pedro Sánchez, played by Efren Ramirez, runs for class president in the film Napoleon Dynamite (2004).\n* Zach Siler, played by Freddie Prinze Jr., is the popular jock and class president in the film ''She's All That (1999).\n* Wilford \"Wil C\" Cardon, class president in the independent film The Rise of Number 45, produced by DJ Iggy.\n* Jessie Spano, played by Elizabeth Berkley, is class president at Bayside High School in the television series Saved by the Bell.\n* Ryoko Asakura serves as class president in the anime The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.\n* Tracy Flick, played by Reese Witherspoon, runs for class president in the film Election (1999).\n* Steve Holt, played by Justin Grant Wade, is class president of the high school attended by George Michael Bluth and Maeby Fünke  in the series Arrested Development.\n* Mizuki Kirimiya appears as the class president in the visual novel Yume Miru Kusuri.\n* Courtney from Total Drama Island is mentioned as having run for class president before participating in the show.\n* In My Hero Academia'', both first-year classes of the U.A.
