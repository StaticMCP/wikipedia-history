It is produced by the Norwegian production company Tellus Works Television AS in collaboration with American Public Television (APT). A sequel series titled Perfect Day continued with the original hosts in rotation, with the cast addition of Sara La Fountain. In the United States it is primarily aired on PBS television stations.\nThe success of the series is in part due to its original format, its hosts and the series production teams. The food is not prepared in a studio but executed on location outdoors, at a mobile kitchen often situated in faraway places, such as remote beaches or mountain precipices. The hosts showcase different regions and dishes of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, and Greenland.\nBeginning in 2003, the show debuted on PBS in the United States (72% of the 347 regional PBS channels). It has also been broadcast in more than 130 other countries, including the United Kingdom, China, Germany, Italy, and France, to a viewership of 100 million per episode, according to show producers. The first, second, fourth, fifth, and sixth seasons were hosted by Norwegian food writer Andreas Viestad, the third season by Swedish chef and television personality Tina Nordström, and the fifth season was hosted by Danish chef and cookbook author Claus Meyer. The sixth season, a sequel series titled Perfect Day rotated the original hosts Viestad, Nordström, and Meyer, with the addition of Finnish TV chef Sara La Fountain. The seventh season was once again named New Scandinavian Cooking, and still rotated between the Nordic hosts. During the eighth and ninth seasons, Andreas continued the series on his own, with his storytelling, fusing history, nature, and cooking – seeking out the origins of the food with his mobile kitchen. In season 10 which was broadcast in 2013, the last of the Nordic countries was introduced to the series namely Iceland, the land of fire and ice. Season 11 (2014) reintroduces Swedish chef Tina Nordström in rotation with Norwegian chef Andreas Viestad.\nOn September 15, 2020, New Scandinavian Cooking officially announced Christer Rødseth as the new host of the program beginning with the show's 16th season. Due to delays in the production of Season 16, episodes with Christer did not air until 2024.\nThe show has its own streaming service on Vimeo. Seasons 7 through 16 (US Seasons 1 through 10) are available via PBS Passport. In addition, select episodes can also be streamed on Amazon Prime Video.\nEpisodes\nAs of 2024 there have been a total of 173 episodes produced over 16 seasons. Starting with Season 7, the show has been produced in conjunction with American Public Television (APT) who produces and distributes shows for public television stations in the United States. In the United States, the seasons that are shown on public television stations have a different numbering system than the overall numbering system. The episodes shown in the United States typically start with Season 7, but are referred to as Season 1. Hence the discrepancy between the two numbering systems being six seasons apart.\nSeason 1 (2003)\nThe first season of New Scandinavian Cooking featured 13 episodes, all of which were hosted by Andreas Viestad.
