His father was a Justice of the Peace in Kent and the family lived at Tunbridge Wells in the county. Curteis was educated at Tonbridge School  from 1865 to 1869; he played in the cricket XI in his final two years at school, captaining the side in 1869.\nMilitary career\nAfter leaving school, Curteis enrolled at the Royal Military College Sandhurst where he also played cricket during 1870. He was commissioned as an ensign in the 24th Regiment (South Wales Borderers) in 1871 and promoted to lieutenant in 1872. He was posted to Malta before moving to Gibraltar in 1874 and then serving in Griqualand West in Southern Africa during 1875.\nIn 1877 Curteis was posted to the regiment's depot at Brecon in South Wales, a post he served at for the remainder of his career. He was promoted to the rank captain in 1880 and retired in 1884.\nCricket\nCurteis played services cricket regularly and has been described as a \"prolific scorer\". He played for the amateur Gentlemen of Kent side in 1872 and made his first-class cricket debut for Kent County Cricket Club in 1877, scoring nine runs on debut against Hampshire at Canterbury. Whilst posted to Brecon he played for the South Wales Cricket Club, including in a match against the touring Australians in 1878. His only other first-class match was for MCC against Oxford University in 1887 in which he scored 8 runs.\nFamily\nBoth of Curteis' brothers were also educated at Tonbridge, both also playing cricket and football for the school. His eldest brother, Reginald, went up to Trinity College, Cambridge before becoming a Church of England clergyman after briefly serving in the Kent Militia. His other rotor, William, was a noted high jumper at school. He went up to Jesus College, Oxford before joining the Army, serving in the 22nd Foot. He rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel and was on active service in the Second Boer War before being awarded the Order of the Bath in 1901 before dying later the same year.\nCurteis married Mary White in 1884. The couple had one son. He died at Mottram Hall, the home of his father-in-law, near Macclesfield in Cheshire in February 1902 aged 48.\nReferences\nExternal links"
