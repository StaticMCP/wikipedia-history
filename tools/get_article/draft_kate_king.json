She is best known for co-presenting and producing Stoke Mandeville Hospital Radio's Tuesday night request show, and for her online presence on social media between 2017 and 2023.\nEarly life\nKing was born Katie Louise King on 17 September 1998, in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, the only child of Michael \"Mick/Mike\" (he answers to both) and Valerie \"Val\" King. King was born with Cerebral palsy, leaving her with limited use of her left hand and other mobility issues.\nKing was brought up as a practicing Christian, and attended Waddesdon Church of England School. After leaving school she studied Level 3 Creative Media at Aylesbury College.\nCareer\n-->\n| birth_place      =\n| death_date       =\n| death_place      =\n| nationality      =\n| other_names      =\n| occupation       =\n| website          =\n| channel_handle   = @kateking8820\n| channel_name     = Kate King\n| pseudonym        =\n| years_active     = 20172023\n| genre            =\n| subscribers      = 19K (as of May 2025)\n| views            =\n| stats_update     =\n| language         =\n| associated_acts  =\n| silver_year      =\n| gold_year        =\n| diamond_year     =\n| ruby_year        =\n| red_diamond_year =\n}}\nKing began her career on YouTube, posting content such as \"daily updates\", in which she would give viewers a report of the weather and her plans for the given day, Q&As where she would answer questions from viewers, and a monthly \"day in the life\" where she would give viewers an insight into her daily life. Perhaps the most popular feature of her channel was her weekly shopping hauls, in which she and her mother Val would give viewers a haul of their weekly grocery shop and read out their meal plans for the week.\nIn December 2017, King joined Stoke Mandeville Hospital Radio as a co-presenter and producer on Steve Andrew’s Tuesday night request show. She was also formerly a presenter on Wycombe Sound, where she presented a segment known as \"Katie's 60s Collection\".\nIn 2023, shortly after the death of her close family friend Henry, whom King referred to as \"Grandad\", she ceased uploading content to her YouTube channel. In late 2024, following the publication of the YouTube documentary \"The Chronicles of Kate King\", she removed all content from her channel.\nControversies\nDue to her large fanbase among the LGBTQ+ community, King was invited to be interviewed by Gaydio. She initially accepted this offer, but later turned it down. This was widely believed to be due to her mother Val talking her out of it, as she had previously expressed what appeared to be homophobic views in a video posted to social media. The video in question showed Val in church, using terms such as \"eradicating moral filth\", which is believed to be a reference to homosexuality. King posted a video to her now deleted TikTok account, where she denied that she was homophobic and expressed her support for the LGBTQ+ community.\nKing was at the centre of a controversy when it was revealed that Henry, the man she had previously referred to online as her grandfather, was not biologically related to her. This caused fans to speculate whether King was actually in a romantic relationship with him, due to the physically affectionate nature of their interactions. Following his death in March 2023, it was rumoured that King had been banned from attending his funeral, due to his family's disapproval of King referring to him as her grandfather online.\nKing received a backlash from fans when it was revealed that she had entered a photography competition via the website Photocrowd, and had submitted a photograph downloaded from Google as her own work. After initially denying the accusations, King later admitted to lying whilst live on her Instagram account.\nIn August 2022, King briefly worked as receptionist for Foxhill Indoor Bowls Club in Aylesbury. She was sacked from the position after just a month when she went on holiday for ten days without informing her manager. King did not initially disclose the reason for her sacking to fans, but a fan later phoned the bowls club claiming to be a journalist, and King's former manager divulged the information to them.\nIn April 2023, King's Tuesday night request show co-presenter Steve Andrews was temporarily suspended from Stoke Mandeville Hospital Radio after using racially discriminatory language whilst on air with King. As a result, the Tuesday night request show and King were also temporarily taken off the air whilst an investigation was undertaken.\nPersonal life\nKing lives in Aylesbury with her parents. She has spoken openly about the challenges she faces living with a physical disability, and her struggles with her mental health, including depression and an eating disorder. She has also spoken about the bullying she experienced during her school years, which lead her to develop social anxiety around people her age.\nKing was previously in a relationship with a man in his 40s, but she ended the relationship due her disapproval of his work schedule.\nKing is a member of Aylesbury Town Bowls Club.\nFilmography\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Radio\n|-\n!Year\n!Title\n!Role\n!Slot\n!Station\n!References\n|-\n| Unknown\n| ''Katie's 60s Collection\n| Presenter\n| Thursdays\n| Wycombe Sound\n|\n|-\n| 2017present\n| Tuesday Night Request Show''\n| Presenter\n| 20:00–22:00 Tuesdays\n| Stoke Mandeville Hospital Radio\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.smhr.co.uk/presenter/katie-king Katie King - Stoke Mandeville Hospital Radio]\n:Category:1998 births\n:Category:English radio presenters\n:Category:English women radio presenters\n:Category:English YouTubers\n:Category:Living people\n:Category:People from Aylesbury"
