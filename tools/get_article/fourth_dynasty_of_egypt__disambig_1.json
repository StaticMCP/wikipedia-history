      "text": "# Fourth Dynasty of Egypt__disambig_1\n\nThe Fourth Dynasty of ancient Egypt (notated Dynasty IV) is characterized as a \"golden age\" of the Old Kingdom of Egypt. Dynasty IV lasted from  to c. 2498&nbsp;BC. It was a time of peace and prosperity as well as one during which trade with other countries is officially documented.\nThe Fourth Dynasty heralded the height of the pyramid-building age. The peaceful rule of the Third Dynasty allowed artistic expressions to flourish. Building experiments done by King Sneferu led to the evolution of mastaba tombs into the smooth-sided pyramids like those seen on the Giza Plateau. No other period in Egyptian history equaled the accomplishments achieved during the Fourth Dynasty.\nRulers\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Dynasty IV monarchs\n! style=\"width:110px\" |Personal Name !! style=\"width:120px\" |Horus-name !!

He descended from a family in Middle Egypt that lived near the city of Hermopolis, and most likely ascended to the throne by marrying a royal heiress. There is still debate as to who his father was, with the credit often being given to Huni, but this cannot be confirmed due to the break in dynasties. His mother, Meresankh I was either a lesser wife or concubine of Huni.\nUntil his reign, Egyptian kings were thought to be worldly incarnations of Horus, obtaining total deification exclusively in death. Sneferu was the first king to proclaim that he was the embodiment of Ra, a sun deity.\nSneferu built the Bent Pyramid, imitating King Djoser's tomb, approximately 150 years later. The Red Pyramid is considered to be the first of the \"true\" pyramids built by Sneferu and earned the name due to its red coloration from the limestone used. Sneferu is attributed to constructing the Meidum pyramid, likely for the last king of the Third Dynasty, Huni.\nSneferu may also be responsible for a series of pyramids built in Selia, though no evidence dictates exactly who built them. He did commission a total of three pyramids during his reign.\nMany of Snerferu's political expeditions were to other countries to secure two things: a substantial labor force, through slavery, and access to a large store of building materials. He frequently traveled to Nubia, and Libya for these. The excursions into Nubia, and Libya allowed an extensive labor force to accumulate requiring vast amounts of food sources in order to maintain.\nKhufu\n.]]\nKhufu, known to the Greek as Cheops, and Sneferu's successor—though it is unclear whether he was the biological son of Sneferu—was a widely known king. He is still known very well in present-day media, being featured in movies, novels, and television shows. His fame stems from his pyramid on the northeastern plateau at Giza, where he was buried. His mortuary temple was built on the northern end of the pyramid, which is no longer accessible due to grave robbers ravaging the area.\nOnly three-dimensional reliefs have been recovered and have lasted into modern day, including many limestone busts and clay figurines. Khufu's activities in and out of Egypt are not well documented, with the exception of his architecture. The Ancient Greeks remain some of the only texts referencing Khufu, through which they viewed him as a cruel and wicked man who offended the deities and forced his subjects into slavery.\nKhufu, as the son of Sneferu, was believed to be illegitimate and therefore unworthy of the throne. Even if he was Sneferu's true son. He did very little to expand the country of Egypt and failed to follow his father's footsteps of territorial gains.\nFile:Kheops-Pyramid.jpg|King Khufu built The Great Pyramid of Giza\nFile:Princess Nefertiabet (detail) in her Giza tomb.

Not much is known of Djedefre, including his inconclusive lineage. It is possible that he is Khufu's son or that he was Khufu's brother. It is widely suggested that he is the son of a lesser queen who murdered the rightful heir to the throne and Djedefre's half brother, the crown prince Kawab.\nDjedefre chose to build his pyramid several kilometers north of Giza, creating speculation that there was a family feud that caused him to want to be far away from Khufu's tomb. A more favorable conclusion was that Djedefre chose to be buried closer to Iunu, the center of the cult of Ra.\nHis pyramid also features a statue of his wife, Hetepheres II, in the form of a sphinx. She was a daughter of Khufu and had been the wife of Kawab. It is sometimes suggested that this was the first true sphinx, although there is debate about the sphinx at Giza that was credited to Khafre. She became the longest living royal member of the dynasty, living into the reign of Shepseskaf.\nKhafre\n]]\nKhafre, son of Khufu, succeeded his supposed brother, Djedefre, after his short reign. He chose to build his pyramid close to his father, matching it in style and being almost as large. At the front of the pyramid causeway lies the Great Sphinx that is said to bear his features. There is still debate on whether his Sphinx was erected before Djedefre's. Khafre's sphinx was well-known and closer to his subjects, making it harder to determine which was built first due to biased record keeping.\nKhafre built the most amount of statues for Dynasty IV, leading to greater evidence of his 25 year long rule. He did cause controversy however, with his statue depicting his ties still to the god Horus, rather than Ra.\nMenkaure\n, his sister-wife]]\nMenkaure succeeded his father, Khafre, as King of Egypt. Menkaure is consistently depicted in his statuary as being around the personifications of deities, and nomes.\nHis pyramid is the third and smallest of those at Giza pyramid complex and is known as Netjer-er-Menkaure, which translates into \"Menkaure is Divine\". There was a sarcophagus found within the pyramid, that is approximately eight feet in length and three feet in height, made of basalt.\nShepseskaf\nShepseskaf is generally accepted as the last king of the Fourth Dynasty, succeeding Menkaure. There is no conclusive evidence of who his mother is, though it is believed that he was the son of a minor queen. Who his wife was also is unknown.It is also uncertain of his relationship to Menkaure, and if he was a son or brother.\nShepseskaf broke the chain of pyramid building by the previous five kings. Instead of a pyramid, he chose to construct a mastaba, a rectangular block, which is commonly referred to as the Mastabat al-Fir’aun (\"Pharaoh's Bench\").\nOther notable individuals\nBaka\nThe identification of Baka is unresolved. Several ancient lists of kings have survived. They do not agree, however, and none of them may be considered complete. The Turin King List has a lacuna between Khafre and Menkaure, where the author had listed a king who reigned between these two pharaohs. The name of the king and length of the reign are completely lost in the lacuna.\nThe Saqqara Tablet also notes a king between Khafre and Menkaure, but here too, the name is lost.\nSome authorities have equated this king with Bikheris, on Manetho's list, who could correspond to the Egyptian name Baka or Bakare.\nKhentkaus I\nPerhaps the most intriguing evidence of the fourth dynasty is the status of Khentkaus I, also known as Khentykawes. She was a daughter of Menkaure and her tomb was built along the Menkaure causeway. She may have ruled as king.\nHer tomb is a large mastaba tomb, with another off-center mastaba placed above it. The second mastaba could not be centered over her primary mastaba because of the free, unsupported, space in the rooms below.\nOn a granite doorway leading into her tomb, Khentkaus I is given titles that may be read either as mother of two kings of upper and lower Egypt, as mother of the king of upper and lower Egypt and king of upper and lower Egypt, or, as one scholar reads it, king of upper and lower Egypt and mother of two kings of upper and lower Egypt.\nFurthermore, her depiction on this doorway also gives her the full trappings of kingship, including the false beard of the king. This depiction and the title given have led some Egyptologists to suggest that she reigned as king near the end of the fourth dynasty.\nHer tomb was finished in a characteristic niche style of architecture, however, the niches were later filled in with a smooth casing of limestone.\nChanges During the Fourth Dynasty\nAuthority of Kings\nOn the whole, Egypt was ruled by two centers of power—legal authority and traditional authority. Legal authority constituted governing by the king, not over the people directly, but via viziers and nomarchs. Traditional authority was derived from the concept that the deities gave a king the divine right to rule as he pleased. At its heart, the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian government became organized so that only the king could direct traditional authority.\nReligious changes\nThe Fourth Dynasty is a period in which a shift in religious practices can be seen. Worship of the sun was becoming the common practice, as the Cult of Ra grew in size. The worship of the Sun was centered around the tomb of the king, Djedefre in the city Heliopolis,which had been occupied since predynastic times, and named by the Ancient Greeks.\nDuring the era centralization of the nation's resources, material, organic, and human, began to develop a relationship to the king. The kings and their relation to the deities became unchallenged, with the kings carving their named into statues and monuments that had been previously reserved for deities. Khafre's famous statue, where a falcon was incorporated into his headgear, equated the king to the god Horus.\nKings no longer associated pyramids with the afterlife. The afterlife was once believed to be a divine kingdom that was represented as a type of idealistic heaven where only kings and pure hearts could go. Instead, the Fourth Dynasty represented a change in this idea, formulated the notion that the afterlife was a familiar place, taking the semblance of Earth.\nChanging customs drove architectural changes\nThe Old Kingdom saw a rise in the preservation of the deceased, making the preparation of bodies much more complex. The position of embalmer was created, and their jobs were solely to prepare a corpse in private. There were three ways to mummify a body: 1) Stucco: the body would be wrapped in fine linen and then covered in stucco plaster, the features of the body (including the face) were remodeled in the plaster; 2) Linen: the body would be wrapped in linen, which was sometimes treated with natron (a mixture of multiple sodium carbonates) and the linens would be treated with resin so that the features of the body could be modeled; and 3) Defleshing: removing all flesh and wrapping the bones in linens. Generally, organs were removed which were then put into jars that would accompany the body in the tomb, and the inside of the body flushed out.\nTombs in the Fourth Dynasty changed drastically. \"Unimpressive\" graves did not satisfy the elites, meaning they would settle for smaller structures if the interior was decorated. Hieroglyphic writings were important to elites because, one, it was a lavish display of wealth and, two, it guided their souls to the afterlife. The Fourth Dynasty, however, did not have these writings. Instead, the tomb was deeper and super-structures were larger. After the Giza pyramid complex, later generations of tombs were more reasonably sized. After the Middle Kingdom, royals abandoned pyramids; they preferred graves that were carved into living rock of the Upper Egyptian mountains.\nAge of the Pyramids\nThe Age of the Pyramids refers to the fact that the Fourth Dynasty was the time when most of the well-known pyramids were built, which include those at Giza. King Sneferu was the first king to express an interest in funerary rites and tombs, which led him to the planning of the largest pyramid at Egypt. His first pyramids were called the Bent Pyramid and Red Pyramid. The \"Age of the Pyramids\" was not just about the building of large and easily recognizable structures, but also a change in funerary practices and rituals. This includes the burying of elites in large structures and the use of extensive mummification.\nComparison of regnal lists\nThe ancient king lists are in broad agreement on the order of most kings in this dynasty, though the obscure kings known Bikheris and Thamphthis were sometimes excluded. The Saqqara Tablet and Turin King List are both in fragmentary condition for this dynasty and some names and reign lengths have been lost as a result. The Saqqara Tablet has five missing cartouches between Khafre and Userkaf, the founder of the Fifth Dynasty. While up to four of these could be attributed to pharaohs recorded on other lists, it is unknown whose name would have appeared in the fifth cartouche, although Khentkaus I is a possibility.\nManetho's Aegyptiaca had a different order of kings for this dynasty: Sneferu, Khufu, Khafre, Menkaure, Djedefre, Bikheris, Shepseskaf and Thamphthis. This order places the reigns of the three pharaohs buried in the Giza pyramid complex next to each other, and all three kings are recorded reigning for over 60 years each.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Historical Pharaoh\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Abydos King List\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Saqqara Tablet\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Turin King List\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Manetho\n! colspan=\"2\" |Reign Years\n|-\n!Turin List\n!Manetho\n|-\n|Sneferu\n|Sneferu\n|Sneferu\n|Snefer[u]\n|Soris\n|24\n|29\n|-\n|Khufu\n|Khufu\n|Khufu\n|Name lost\n|Souphis\n|23\n|63\n|-\n|Djedefre\n|Djedefre\n|Djedefre\n|Name lost\n|Rhatoises\n|8\n|25\n|-\n|Khafre\n|Khafre\n|Khafre\n|Kha[fre]\n|Souphis\n|Lost\n|66\n|-\n|Bikheris\n|–\n|Name lost\n|Name lost\n|Bikheres\n|Lost\n|22\n|-\n|Menkaure\n|Menkaure\n|Name lost\n|Name lost\n|Mesochris\n|28\n|63\n|-\n|Shepseskaf\n|Shepseskaf\n|Name lost\n|Name lost\n|Seberkheres\n|4\n|7\n|-\n|Thamphthis\n|–\n|Name lost\n|–\n|Thamphthis\n|2\n|9\n|}\nThird/Fourth dynasty genetics\n, likely daughter of Sneferu and sister of king Khufu, ca. 2580 BCE.]]\nFor the first time, in a 2025 publication by the scientific journal Nature, a whole-genome genetic study was able to give insights into the genetic background of Old Kingdom individuals, by sequencing the whole genome of an Old Kingdom adult male Egyptian of relatively high-status, radiocarbon-dated to 2855–2570 BCE, with funerary practices archeologically attributed to the Third and Fourth Dynasty, which was excavated in Nuwayrat (Nuerat, نويرات), in a cliff 265 km south of Cairo. Before this study, whole-genome sequencing of ancient Egyptians from the early periods of Egyptian Dynastic history had not yet been accomplished, mainly because of the problematic DNA preservation conditions in Egypt.\nThe corpse had been placed intact in a large circular clay pot without embalming, and then installed inside a cliff tomb, which accounts for the comparatively good level of conservation of the skeleton and its DNA. Most of his genome was found to be associated with North African Neolithic ancestry, but about 20% of his genetic ancestry could be sourced to the eastern Fertile Crescent, including Mesopotamia. The genetic profile was most closely represented by a two-source model, in which 77.6% ± 3.8% of the ancestry corresponded to genomes from the Middle Neolithic Moroccan site of Skhirat-Rouazi (dated to 4780–4230 BCE), which itself consists of predominantly (76.4 ± 4.0%) Levant Neolithic ancestry and (23.6 ± 4.0%) minor Iberomaurusian ancestry, while the remainder (22.4% ± 3.8%) was most closely related to known genomes from Neolithic Mesopotamia (dated to 9000-8000 BCE). Genomes from the Neolithic/Chalcolithic Levant only appeared as a minor third-place component in three-source models. A 2022 DNA study had already shown evidence of gene flow from the Mesopotamian and Zagros regions into surrounding areas, including Anatolia, during the Neolithic, but not as far as Egypt yet.\nIn terms of chronology, Egypt was one of the first areas to adopt the Neolithic package emerging from West Asia as early as the 6th millennium BCE. Population genetics in the Nile Valley observed a marked change around this period, as shown by odontometric and dental tissue changes. Cultural exchange and trade between the two regions then continued through the 4th millennium BCE, as shown by the transfer of Mesopotamian Late Uruk period features to the Nile Valley of the later Predynastic Period. Migrations flows from Mesopotamia accompanied such cultural exchanges, possibly through the sea routes of the Mediterranean and the Red Sea or through yet un-sampled intermediaries in the Levant, which could explain the relative smallness of genetic influence from known Chalcolithic/Bronze Age Levantines populations.\nOverall, the 2025 study \"provides direct evidence of genetic ancestry related to the eastern Fertile Crescent in ancient Egypt\". This genetic connection suggests that there had been ancient migration flows from the eastern Fertile Crescent to Egypt, in addition to the exchanges of objects and imagery (domesticated animals and plants, writing systems...) already observed. This suggests a pattern of wide cultural and demographic expansion from the Mesopotamian region, which affected both Anatolia and Egypt during this period.\nFourth Dynasty timeline\nImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:12\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:30 right:130 left:20\nAlignBars  = justify\nDateFormat = yyyy\nPeriod     = from:-2620 till:-2490\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:30 start:-2620\nScaleMinor  = unit:year increment:10  start:-2620\nColors     =\nid:canvas      value:rgb(0.97,0.97,0.97)\nid:PA   value:green\nid:GP   value:red\nid:eon    value:rgb(1,0.7,1)   # light purple\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\nBarData =\nbarset:Rulers\nPlotData=\nwidth:5 align:left fontsize:S shift:(5,-4) anchor:till\nbarset:Rulers\nfrom: -2613 till: -2589 color:PA text:\"Sneferu (Soris)\"\nfrom: -2589 till: -2566 color:PA text:\"Khufu (Cheops)\"\nfrom: -2566 till: -2558 color:PA text:\"Djedefre (Radjedef)\"\nfrom: -2558 till: -2532 color:PA text:\"Khafre (Chephren)\"\nfrom: -2532 till: -2531 color:PA text:\"Baka\" ?\nfrom: -2532 till: -2503 color:PA text:\"Menkaure (Mycerinus, Mykerinos)\"\nfrom: -2503 till: -2498 color:PA text:\"Shepseskaf\"\nfrom: -2498 till: -2494 color:PA text:\"Djedefptah\" ?\nbarset:skip\nSee also\n* Egyptian Fourth Dynasty Family Tree\nReferences"
