It is situated at 7 Kilometre away in the Nalas village of Rajpura, Punjab. It is maintained by the ascetic sadhu's of Juna Akhara Foundation.\nTemple\nSwayambhu\nInside the Shanaleshwara Temple is the Swayambhu lingam of Lord Shiva. Shiva in the lingam form is believed to be Swayambhu. Swayambhu lingams are Self-created or natural lingams, discovered in the place where they now stand. Most of these are oval- shaped stones. These lingams do not need a prana pratishtha, because a Swayambhu lingam already inherently embodies the power of Shiva.\nImportance\nMaha Shivaratri is great festival here, three-days fair is held here every year on Maha Shivaratri and lakhs of people come to the fair to ask for a vow. It has been a tradition that on Maha Shivaratri and in this area (near Rajpura) most of the devotees start their journey on foot from their homes to the Shanaleshwara temple and volunteers serve food to the devotees along the way.\nIn 1592, Maharaja of Patiala built this temple. Since the 15th century temple has been home to Sadhu's. The Lingam of Shanaleshwara is also known to be Pancha Bhoota. The temple of Shanaleshwara is a place of Guru–shishya tradition.\nTiming\nEach row displays several details. Some are there by default, others can be added.
