Likewise, the characters' conflict is not explored correctly due to the length and inconsistent performances on the part of the cast. However, he highlights photography because it manages to capture the grandeur of rural areas.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.revopelicula.com/ Official Page]"
