Kingwood was originally established around 1746 when it was created from Bethlehem Township, though the exact details are uncertain. Kingwood was incorporated by Act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798, as one of New Jersey's initial group of 104 townships. Portions of the township were taken to form Franklin Township on April 7, 1845. Frenchtown borough acquired portions of the township in 1876.\nKingwood Township was the home of Daniel Bray, the local captain who rounded up the boats for George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River during the Revolutionary War. The portion of Route 29 that runs through the township along its western edge is named for him.\nIn late 1981, Dick Siano became the first Libertarian Party candidate to win a partisan election outside of Alaska by winning a committee seat in the township. In the November election, he and the Democratic tied in the general election placing the incumbent Republican mayor in third place. Siano won the runoff election held on December 22.\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 35.62 square miles (92.24&nbsp;km2), including 35.01 square miles (90.66&nbsp;km2) of land and 0.61 square miles (1.58&nbsp;km2) of water (1.71%).\nThe township borders the municipalities of Alexandria Township, Delaware Township, Franklin Township and Frenchtown in Hunterdon County; and the communities of Plumstead Township and Tinicum Township in Bucks County, across the Delaware River in Pennsylvania.
