He is best known for his role as Galen in the Babylon&nbsp;5 spin-offs Babylon 5: A Call to Arms, Crusade and Babylon 5: The Lost Tales. He is also known for his role as British Army Brigadier General Charles O'Hara in The Patriot.\nEarly life and education\nWoodward was born on 24 January 1956 in London, the second son of actors Venetia Mary Collett (also known as Venetia Barrett) and Edward Woodward. His siblings Tim and Sarah are also actors. He was educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College, before studying acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), graduating in 1975 with an Acting (RADA Diploma).\nCareer\nActor\nAfter graduation, he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, starring in many of their productions including ''The Winter's Tale, The Comedy of Errors and A Midsummer Night's Dream. Woodward has also played a wide range of major character roles in films and television including the role of the German Captain Stossel in the feature film The Brylcreem Boys''. Woodward voiced the role of Edwin Carbunkle the main villain in the 3D Computer animation children's comedy film Postman Pat: The Movie.\nCrusade\nAs the Techno Mage Galen in the Babylon 5 spin-off Crusade, Woodward played opposite his father in the episode \"The Long Road.\" In the episode, the Excalibur visits a planet that may contain a potent anti-viral agent in its minerals. Earth agencies are strip-mining the planet. Edward Woodward played Alwyn, a rogue Techno Mage living on the planet with its inhabitants who was a friend of Galen's former teacher.\nFight arranger and Conquest\nAs a former member of the British Academy of Dramatic Combat, Woodward is known in the film industry for his work as a fight arranger. Woodward's dramatic combat training inspired him to study historical weaponry and combat techniques. This interest ultimately led him to create, co-write, and host The History Channel's documentary series Conquest (2002-2003), a hands-on showcase of weapons, training and combat techniques throughout history.\nWriter\nBranching out in the late 1990s, Woodward and his father formed Tripal Productions, for which he wrote and produced his first feature film The House of Angelo, directed by Jim Goddard in 1997 with his father starring as Angelo. Woodward also wrote the feature film Closing the Ring, which was directed by Richard Attenborough.\nFilmography\nFilm\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Title\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n|1987\n|Metal Skin Panic MADOX-01\n|Lieutenant Kilgore\n|Voice, English dub\n|-\n|2000\n|The Patriot\n|Brigadier General Charles O'Hara\n|-\n|2006\n|We Fight to Be Free\n|Edward Braddock\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2007\n|Babylon 5: The Lost Tales\n|Galen\n|Direct-to-video\n|-\n|Closing the Ring\n|N/A\n|Writer and producer\n|-\n|2008\n|National Treasure: Book of Secrets\n|Palace Security Guard\n|\n|-\n|2010\n|Unthinkable\n|N/A\n|Writer\n|-\n|2011\n|Dead Space: Aftermath\n|Lead Interrogator\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Voice\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2014\n|Postman Pat: The Movie\n|Edwin Carbunkle\n|-\n|The Crypt\n|Father Antonio\n|\n|-\n|2015\n|Awaiting\n|Jerry\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2016\n|''The Comedian's Guide to Survival\n|Morris\n|\n|-\n|Space Dogs\n|Dr. Cat\n|Voice\n|-\n|2017\n|The Last Scout\n|Edward\n|\n|}\nTelevision\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Title\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n|1989\n|Megazone 23 III\n|Edval\n|Voice\n|-\n|1999\n|Crusade (TV series)\n|Galen\n|13 episodes\n|-\n|2001\n|Walker, Texas Ranger\n|Victor Drake\n|1 episode: \"Blood Diamonds\"\n|-\n|2002\n|Masada\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Host\n|Television film; documentary\n|-\n|2002\n|Egypt Land of the Gods\n|Television film; documentary\n|-\n|2002–2003\n|Conquest\n|Self\n|4 episodes; also writer and producer\n|-\n|2002–2005\n|Charmed\n|Aku, The Source\n|4 episodes\n|-\n|2005\n|The True Story of Alexander the Great\n|Host\n|Television film; documentary\n|-\n|2005\n|Stargate Atlantis\n|Otto\n|Episode: \"The Tower\"\n|-\n|2009–2010\n|Fringe\n|August\n|2 episodes\n|-\n|2009–2011\n|Batman: The Brave and the Bold''\n|Ra's al Ghul, Great Caesar\n|Voice, 3 episodes\n|-\n|2010\n|NCIS\n|David Devoisier\n|Episode: \"Jack-Knife\"\n|-\n|2011\n|Eagleheart\n|Doolan\n|Episode: \"The Human Bat\"\n|-\n|2015\n|The Good Wife\n|Charles Ephraham\n|Episode: \"Driven\"\n|-\n|2017–2019\n|Wacky Races\n|Dick Dastardly, additional voices\n|Voice, 21 episodes\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.peterwoodward.com/ Official website]"
