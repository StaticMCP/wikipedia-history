In 2023, the town had a population of two people.\nHistory\nEmmet was once a prosperous town built around the Emmet railway station () on the Blackall and Yaraka Branch railway.\nAttractions\nThe site now contains a picnic shelter and a small museum that is housed in the former railway station building.  Its relative proximity to the Idalia National Park makes it a popular stopping off point for tourists.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
