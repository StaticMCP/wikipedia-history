His intent was to establish a liberal society in the spirit of those emerging in the Americas and Europe at the time. The events have also been referred to as the Revolution of 1809.'\nBackground\n| footer_background = #BBDD99\n| background colour = #BBDD99\n| footer_align      = center\n| image1            =\n}}\nSince the Age of Enlightenment, revolutionary ideas and reformism spread first to America and France, but soon also to the rest of the world, including the twin realms of Denmark–Norway.\nEnlightenment in Denmark and Norway\nDenmark-Norway was during the 18th century an ideal enlightened absolutist state. And turned the revolutionary ideas down by reforming the country, under the leadership of privy councillor, Johann Friedrich Struensee, and the young prince regent and later king, Frederick. During his earlier reign, Frederick abolished Serfdom in 1788, hanging as a capital punishment in 1789 and transatlantic slave trade in 1803.\nIn Norway revolutionary ideas were bigger, yet still small in contrast to the French. Norges Skaal, was banned by Dano-Norwegian officials in 1772, and was labelled \"the Norwegian Marseillaise\". On the other hand, according to Mary Wollstonecraft Norway appeared to enjoy all aspects of freedom.\nThe melting pot of Danish and Norwegian revolutionary and reformative ideas lay Copenhagen, where Jørgensen was born on 29 March 1790. On his return from a global expedition, Jørgenson witnessed his home city of Copenhagen being embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars.\nJorgensen's role in The English Wars\nIn response to the Battle of Copenhagen, Denmark declared war on the United Kingdom. Jørgensen enlisted in the Danish navy and was made captain of the privateer brig, the Admiral Juel (English: Admiral Jawl) Jorgensen's seafaring background quickly paid off, and in a couple of months he had captured three prizes. However, he was intercepted off the coast of Scarborough and was brought to London.\nRevolution\nSituation in Iceland\n| footer_background = #BBDD99\n| background colour = #BBDD99\n| footer_align      = center\n| image1            =\n}}\nIn England, Jørgensen learned about the impact of the war in Iceland from Icelandic merchants. Since the loss of the Danish fleet, Norway, Iceland and Greenland couldn't receive their needed supplies from Denmark. This, including the recently ended Danish trade monopoly over Iceland, and a volcanic eruption in 1783 where over nine thousand Icelanders died, led to a weak Iceland which Jørgensen saw to exploit.\nFirst expedition to Iceland\nOn 29 December 1808, at Liverpool harbour, Jørgensen accompanied and financed by James Savignac and Samuel Phelps, with the additional help of Sir Joseph Banks, embarked for Iceland with supplies for the starving population.\nTheir vessel Clarence'' met hostile resistance from the Danish government at Reykjavík, since it displayed the Union Jack Nevertheless, Jørgensen forced an agreement to bring the humanitarian aid ashore. Though, Jørgensen, Phelps, and Banks' humanitarian efforts faced challenges in Reykjavik, as the city's population of around 300 residents were predominantly linked to the colonial Danish government and enjoyed privileged status. This population did not represent the rural Icelanders in need of assistance that the three sought to reach.\nSecond expedition\nIn an attempt to recoup some of the merchants' losses from the first expedition, Jørgensen made a second expedition on the ship Margaret and Ann. Local governor, Frederich Christopher Trampe, Count of Trampe had been absent from the island, when the trade agreement with Jørgensen had been made and immediately scrapped the agreement. When Jørgen found out, he made a secret plan to overthrow the local government. He besieged the governor's house and imprisoned him while the rest of the city were in church.\nProtector of Iceland\nJørgensen envisioned an Iceland characterized by social democracy and liberty, drawing inspiration from the revolutionary movements in America and France. He also attempted to restore the ancient Althing. Jørgensen disrupted the exploitative practices and monopolies of the Danish colonists, including Count Trampe, by selling grain at significantly reduced prices. He conveyed his intentions through a series of proclamations, gradually adopting a more regal tone. He adopted the title Protector of Iceland. Jergensen's two-month-rule was harsh against the previous Danish rule and commanded that all guns, swords and ammunition should be handed over to Jørgensen and his crew and all representatives of Denmark should stay inside. If these commands were not followed, there would be capital punishment. Despite his brutal anti-Danish laws, the Icelanders were supportive of the revolution and enlisted in Jergenson's army. A defensive fort, called Fort Phelps was established.\nBritish intervention\nJørgensen's successful revolution would not last long though, and on 22 August 1809, the British corvette Talbot, under the command of captain Alexander Jones arrived at the island. Not as an act to support Denmark, but rather because Jørgen had broken his promise, as a Prisoner of war, not to leave the British Isles. Thus Jørgen Jørgensen was imprisoned, and the Danish government was re-established on the island.\nAftermath\nWith a short Icelandic independence from Denmark proved the big changes in the 19th century for the multinational Danish Realm, Five years later, Norway would too revolt against the provisions at Kiel. And forty years later, the national revolutions spread to Schleswig and Holstein. Jørgen Jørgensen was sat before the English court and would later settle in Tasmania, participating in the Black War.\nReferences"
