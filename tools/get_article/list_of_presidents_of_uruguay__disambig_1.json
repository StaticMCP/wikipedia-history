      "text": "# List of presidents of Uruguay__disambig_1\n\nUruguay is a presidential republic in which the president is both the head of state and head of government. The following is a list of all the people who have held the office of President of Uruguay since 6 November 1830 (when the first constitution was adopted), with the exception of those who held the office of \"President\" under the National Council of Government, which served as the country's executive directory from 1955 to 1967. The first president of this list is Fructuoso Rivera, who held the office twice and once as part of the Triumvirate that ruled the country from 1853 to 1854.\nMost of the presidents of Uruguay have belonged to the Colorado Party, a traditionally conservative party founded by Rivera in 1836, although there has not been a Colorado president since Jorge Batlle left office in 2005. The first free democratic elections for president were held in 1922. The current president is Yamandú Orsi of the Broad Front, who was elected in the 2024 presidential election.\nGovernors of Uruguay as a province\nOriental Province (1814–1817)\nProvince part of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! width=\"2%\"|No.\n! width=\"5%\"|Portrait\n! width=\"20%\"|Name(Birth–Death)\n! colspan=\"2\" width=\"35%\"|Term of office\n! width=\"29%\"|Notes\n|-\n!1\n|\n|Nicolás Rodríguez Peña(1775–1853)\n|9 July 1814\n|25 August 1814\n|align=left|Governor.
