Carthage sues for peace.\n*146 B.C North Africa: The city of Carthage fell into the hands of the Roman Republic after the final attack led by Scipio the Younger. The city was destroyed and the remaining 50,000 Carthaginian citizens were sold into slavery. This battle ended the Punic Wars and practically ceded the remainder of Carthage's territory to the Roman Republic.\n*55 B.C Great Britain:  The first Roman invasion of Britain took place when Julius Caesar and his legions landed on the British coast but were soon pushed from the area. He would return the following year with a much larger force and made better progress. However, Caesar would ultimately make peace with the British people and the Roman Republic would commence trade with them. Later Roman invasions would prove more successful.\n*821 Ireland: The first recorded Viking raid in Irish history occurred in AD 795 when Vikings, possibly from Norway looted the island of Lambay. The Viking raids on Ireland resumed in 821, the Vikings began to establish fortified encampments, longports, along the Irish coast and overwintering in Ireland instead of retreating to Scandinavia or British bases. The first known longports were at Linn Dúachaill (Annagassan) and Duiblinn (on the River Liffey, at or near present Dublin).\n*865 Great Britain: The first known account of a Viking raid in Anglo-Saxon England comes from 789, when three ships from Hordaland (in modern Norway) landed in the Isle of Portland on the southern coast of Wessex. From 865 the Norse attitude towards Great Britain changed, as they began to see it as a place for potential colonisation rather than simply a place to raid. As a result of this, larger armies began arriving on Britain's shores, with the intention of conquering land and constructing settlements there. Norse armies captured York in 867.\n*1000: Norsemen are the first Europeans to discover America. The first American-born European child is Snorri Thorfinnsson. Norsemen are the first Europeans to have a hostile confrontation with the Native Americans. These Viking explorers are likely to have used America as a source of vital goods, such as timber, to sustain the colonies of Iceland and Greenland for centuries. The colony at L'Anse aux Meadows in Canada and the Maine Penny in the United States are the most reliable proof of Norse presence in America.\n*1095: Pope Urban II proclaims the First Crusade at the Council of Clermont.\n*1099 Jerusalem: Christian European Crusaders storm Jerusalem and massacre its inhabitants.\n15th to 18th centuries\n*1402: Kingdom of Castile begins with the invasion of the Canary Islands.\n*1415: The Portuguese Empire begins with the capture of Ceuta (Morocco).\n*1419: The Portuguese discover Madeira.\n*1427: The Portuguese discover Azores.\n*1441: The first consignment of slaves is brought to Lisbon (Portugal).\n*1452: Papal Bull Dum diversas allows enslavement of pagans.\n*1455: Papal Bull Romanus Pontifex grants a trade monopoly for newly discovered countries in Africa and Asia to the Portuguese.\n*1474: João Vaz Corte-Real, a Portuguese navigator, claims to have discovered the New Land of the Codfish, an unidentified island of which there is some speculation that it might be Newfoundland, in present-day Canada.\n*1481: Papal Bull Aeterni regis.\n*1482: The Portuguese build the Elmina Castle as the first trading point in Ghana.\n*1488: Bartolomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope for the Portuguese king.\n*1492: Discovery of the New World and symbolic date of the European Age of Exploration; beginning of the colonization of the Americas and of the Columbian Exchange.\n*1493: Papal Bull Inter caetera on May 4.\n*1494: Treaty of Tordesillas dividing the world outside of Europe in an exclusive duopoly between the Spanish and the Portuguese empires along a north–south meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands (off the west coast of Africa), roughly 46° 36' W. (This boundary was known as the Line of Demarcation.)  The lands to the east would belong to Portugal and the lands to the west to Spain.\n*1498: Vasco da Gama sets foot on Kozhikode, starting the Portuguese presence in India.\n*1500: Pedro Álvares Cabral sails to Brazil for the Portuguese king.\n*1511: The Portuguese capture Malacca, in present-day Malaysia.\n*1515: Spanish Leyes de Burgos on January 25.\n*1519: The Portuguese capture Ormus, in the Strait of Hormuz, in the Persian Gulf.\n*1529: Treaty of Zaragoza dividing Asia between the Spanish and Portuguese empires.
