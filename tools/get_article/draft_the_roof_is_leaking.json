      "text": "# Draft:The Roof Is Leaking\n\n----\n\"The Roof Is Leaking\" is a song by the English drummer and former Genesis drummer/lead vocalist Phil Collins from his album Face Value (1981).\nBackground\nAs Collins stated during an interview for British documentary Classic Albums:\n}}\nRecording\nThe slide guitar was played by Eric Clapton. Collins later stated that he \"lost the plot\" when re-recording the song with Clapton, stating: \"I had Eric come down to the studio to re-record the [Face Value] song, The Roof Is Leaking. And I missed the plot there\" and \"you can hear it on the [Extra Values] bonus disc, mastered from a cassette — is what it should be, and also what he did in the studio is what it should be. I had wanted him to do the same thing each time.\"\nRelease\n\"The Roof Is Leaking\" was released on Collins' eponymous debut album  and also served as the b-side to \"In the Air Tonight\".\nReception\nWhen Rolling Stone ranked his ten best songs in a Readers' Poll, \"The Roof is Leaking\" was placed at number ten, at which they said \"Despair is evident on every song, particularly the gut-wrenching \"The Roof Is Leaking.\" It's a sparse track, totally unlike anything the songwriter had done in his decade with Genesis. Few people could have imagined this material would kick-start one of the most successful pop careers of the decade.\" Hann Michael of The Guardian ranked it number 13 in his list of the twenty greatest Phil Collins songs, stating that \"Oddly, it comes over rather like a realist version of Rod Stewart’s Mandolin Wind with all the romance removed and all the hardship emphasised.\"\nPersonnel\n* Phil Collins – piano, vocals\n* Daryl Stuermer – banjo\n* Eric Clapton – Dobro slide guitar\nReferences\nSources\nDocumentaries\n*"
