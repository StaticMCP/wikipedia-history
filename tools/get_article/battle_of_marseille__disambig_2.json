The groundwork was laid by the Allied invasion of southern France in Operation Dragoon on 15 August 1944 by the United States Seventh Army, with major support from the French First Army.\nBackground\nAlong with Toulon, the main port for the French Navy (), the Port of Marseille was a vital objective. The port, its facilities, and the rail and road links up the Rhone valley, being essential to the liberation of southern France and the ultimate defeat of German forces. After the successful execution of Operation Overlord (the Normandy landings), attention shifted to the south.  Most ports in the north were unusable, or too heavily fortified (e.g. Cherbourg, Brest, Lorient, Saint Nazaire), which made seizure and control of the French ports at Marseille and Toulon increasingly attractive. In addition, the French leaders pressed for an invasion in southern France. Finally, after many delays, on 14 July, Operation Dragoon was authorized by the Allied Combined Chiefs of Staff. The groundwork was laid by the Allied invasion of southern France in Operation Dragoon on 15 August by the United States Seventh Army under General Patch, with support from the French First Army who began landing on 16 August and would within days amount to two thirds of the Dragoon troops on the ground. Patch gave the order to General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny to take the cities of Toulon and Marseille, which were to be attacked simultaneously with de Larminat in charge of attacking Toulon.\nDefences\nGerman defences centred on almost static infantry units guarding the coastal areas, with 11th Panzer Division providing a mobile reserve.\nAt Marseille the 244th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht) provided the main defence, comprising three Grenadier regiments, the 932nd, 933rd and 934th together with an artillery regiment.\nExisting French Army defensive points, including large artillery batteries, provided a reasonable seaward defence. The landward side defence was augmented with mines and the digging of weapons pits, trenches and tank obstacles.\nOn 20 August the Germans scuttled the ships that were in the harbour: one tanker, one cable laying ship, three passenger ships, and 20 cargo ships.\nResistance\nMarseille played host to two major resistance movements, the non communist coalition known as Mouvements Unis de la Résistance (MUR) with 800 men and the French Communist Party Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP) with 2,000 men. Gaston Defferre was a leading figure in MUR as well as heading the Allied intelligence network. Both MUR and the Allies had operated a policy of non arming of communist groups. In February 1944 the creation of French Forces of the Interior (FFI) in theory merged the two groups, however they stayed opposed to each other until the FFI was absorbed into the regular French Army.\nOn 23 August, with French Army troops approaching the city suburbs, the Resistance took over the city's Prefecture. The German garrison could easily have destroyed this opposition, but seemed distracted by the regular French Army.\n15–29 August\nSoftening up using heavy bombers to attack gun positions around Marseille began on 12 August, the city had few anti aircraft defences. The 23/24 attacks scored some direct hits on gun positions in the Marseille area and roaming fighter bombers took on targets of opportunity.\nOn 21 August the approaches to Marseille were cut, isolating the Marseille garrison. Units closed in on the suburbs. The Germans blew up the Marseille Transporter Bridge to try to block the port.\nOrdered to clear the suburbs of Marseille, on 24 August 3rd Algerian Infantry Division occupied the centre of Marseille. General Joseph de Goislard de Monsabert decided that with the Resistance rising up and 1st Combat Command moving on the Old Port, he would call upon the Germans to surrender, but was refused.\nPockets of resistance were mopped up on 26 August. A German explosive-controlled boat attack on minesweepers sweeping channels to the port was broken up, and eight were sunk.\nThe main German resistance centred on the old fort of St Nicolas. French artillery opened up on the fort and after two days it was clear that resistance was futile and the Marseille garrison surrendered on 27 August. On 29 August marines from the cruisers USS Augusta and USS Philadelphia accepted the surrender of Germans on the fortified harbour islands.\nFrench casualties were over 1,800 and they took 11,000 prisoners.\nPort\nThe ports of Toulon and Marseille were captured in 14 days, when the plan of attack had estimated D+40.\nThe Old Port of Marseille appeared to be in complete ruins. According to eye-witness accounts, in January 1943, the Germans, aided by the French police, dynamited much of the historic old town and demolished the gigantic aerial ferry or \"transbordeur\", an engineering tour de force that had become  a major landmark of Marseille, comparable to the Eiffel Tower in Paris. However, the harbour was still functional. In August 1944 Hitler ordered his troops under the command of General Hans Schäfer to hold Marseille \"to the last man and last cartridge\" and destroy the harbour beyond repair if defeat was inevitable. But Schäfer refused to let the majority of his men become casualties and allowed only partial demolition. He and his 11,000 surviving troops surrendered on August 28.\nThe main Marseille-Fos Port facilities suffered damage from 2,000 mines that were used to destroy quays, bridges, moles, cranes and sheds, however with hard work, two weeks later, the first ship entered the port to begin unloading supplies.\nThe landing of supplies increased rapidly, with  of rail freight moving from the port in September, plus  by truck.\nA fuel pipe line was built, it started at Martigues and utilising storage tanks in the La Mede refinery. The harbour was mined and it was 9 September when the first tanker docked. A tug assisting it dock hit a mine. Pipe laying started the same day. Six teams, each laying over  of  pipe a day. Interim storage and dispensing points were built. When completed it was capable of moving  of petrol a day, which reduced the problems caused by a shortage of jerrycans and trucks. A second  pipeline would be laid and it eventually reached the Sarrebourg, 850&nbsp;km away. By Spring 1945,  were being pumped every day, meeting the requirements of both the Seventh United States Army and the First Army (France).\nBy mid October, with the repairs to the railway lines, especially bridges, freight increased. The southern route would become a significant source of supplies to help the Allied advance into Germany, moving over  a week and providing about one third of the total Allied requirement.\nAftermath\nThe left wing French resistance took over the city administration and the American forces did not have an easy time of getting their requirements met, using the city as a rest and relaxation centre was not appreciated.\nGeneral Charles de Gaulle took a dim view of FTP and the part it played in the liberation. He ensured that these paramilitary units were absorbed into the regular army, so eliminating any threat against him. The French Army presence in southern France combined with the Leclerc's 2nd Armoured Liberation of Paris elevated De Gaulle to the leader of the Provisional Government of the French Republic in the eyes of the Allied Politicians.\nThe port of Marseille had been the prime route for the shipping of Red Cross parcels from Lisbon to the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva, for onward transport to PoW camps. Operation Dragoon put a stop to that, although a few parcels did start arriving again through Toulon in November.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n* .\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://viergedelagarde.free.fr/choix/histo/bataille/bataille.htm La libération de Notre Dame de la Garde le 25 août 1944]\n* [http://museedelaresistanceenligne.org/media7307--Jeep-du-colonel-Chappuis-sur-la-CanebiA Sur la Canebière, la jeep du colonel Chappuis arborant des drapeaux blancs, Marseille, 22-23 août 1944]\n* [https://imagesdefense.gouv.fr/fr/le-general-de-monsabert-et-le-colonel-chappuis.html Le général de Monsabert et le colonel Chappuis en août 1944 à Marseille]"
