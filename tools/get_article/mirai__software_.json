The modeller uses the winged edge data structure, is written in Common Lisp, and traces its lineage to the S-Geometry software from Symbolics. It has been used primarily by game developers and high-end character animators—for example by Bay Raitt's facial morph targets for the Gollum character in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy.\nSee also\n* N-World graphics software\n* Wings 3D graphics software\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.awn.com/animationworld/two-towers-face-face-gollum The Two Towers: Face to Face with Gollum]"
