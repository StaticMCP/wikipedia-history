He was sometimes credited as Robert Stewart early in his career. Banks Stewart contributed extensively to drama for the BBC and ITV for several decades, which included creating and producing the series Shoestring (1979) and Bergerac (1981) and producing the first series of Lovejoy (1986). He also produced and co-adapted the early episodes of The Darling Buds of May (1991).\nCareer\nBorn in Edinburgh, Banks Stewart did national service in the British Army and began writing as a journalist, working for his home city's evening newspapers, where he became the youngest news editor in history for the Evening Dispatch. Even then, he used to discuss ideas for television series. Later he became a story editor at Pinewood Studios. Working as a scriptwriter from the end of the 1950s, he worked on such TV series as Danger Man, The Human Jungle, Top Secret and The Avengers (\"The Master Minds\" and \"Quick-Quick Slow Death\"). He also contributed a few scripts to the Edgar Wallace Mysteries series of second features for the cinema.\nWorking for Thames Television he contributed scripts to the programmes Callan, Special Branch, The Sweeney and Owner Occupied. For HTV, he wrote five episodes of Arthur of the Britons. Banks Stewart wrote two popular serials for the BBC science-fiction series Doctor Who when it starred Tom Baker: Terror of the Zygons (1975) (which was set in his native Scotland and drew on the Loch Ness Monster legend) and The Seeds of Doom (1976) (which was influenced by classic science-fiction such as The Day of the Triffids, The Quatermass Experiment and The Thing from Another World). These two stories were removed from BBC i-player in November 2024 without explanation. A third story,  The Foe from the Future, was considered but ultimately cancelled as Stewart became unavailable, but Robert Holmes wrote The Talons of Weng Chiang (1977) from the idea by Robert Banks Stewart, who received no on-screen credit. An audio adaptation of The Foe from the Future was released in 2012 by Big Finish Productions. In 1976, a still of Banks Stewart appeared in The Brain of Morbius, representing one of the Morbius Doctors.\nBanks Stewart continued working in television as a writer, script editor and producer, creating Shoestring (1979–80), which ran for two series on the BBC and following this up with the Jersey-set detective drama series Bergerac (1981–91). He later produced Hannay (5 episodes, 1988), The Darling Buds of May (4 episodes), Lovejoy (10 episodes) and Call Me Mister. His final credit for television was for the adaptation of My Uncle Silas (2001–03) starring Albert Finney.\nIn 2012 Banks Stewart, then aged 81, published his only novel, The Hurricane's Tail, a thriller featuring the British Detective Sergeant Harper Buchanan who uncovers a plot against the prime minister of a Caribbean island. It was originally envisaged as a two-part TV series, but Banks Stewart said that he decided to turn it into a novel after \"getting nowhere\" with TV executives, which he attributed to ageism. In 2015 he published his autobiography, To Put You in the Picture''.\nDeath\nOn 14 January 2016, Robert Banks Stewart died of cancer at the age of 84.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
