The awards recognise the contribution of individuals and organisations in providing access to the arts, and celebrate the achievements of artists with lived experience of disability or mental ill-health. There are currently seven awards, including a Community Partnership award, a Museum award, two Arts in Corrections awards, the Arts Access Artistic Achievement Award for artists with a disability or lived experience of mental ill-health, and an Arts Access Accolade, presented to someone who has made a significant contribution to accessibility. The award winners are selected by a panel of judges, except for the Arts Accolade, which is selected by the staff and board of Arts Access Aotearoa.\nUp until 2020 the trophies for each award were made by Robert Rapson. Hedy Ankers, of Wellington Potters, took over after Rapson's death.\nIn 2022 a decision was made to pause the awards event with a fellowship instead.\n2021 awards\nThe 2021 awards were held at Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington on 5 July 2021.
