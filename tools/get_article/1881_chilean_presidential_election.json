Carried out through a system of electors, they resulted in the election of Domingo Santa María as president. The election was not free and fair, and occurred in the context of election violence. Santa María was the sole candidate after Manuel Baquedano's resignation. Santa María had been hand-picked by incumbent President Pinto.  However, Baquedano received 12 electoral votes in Santiago.\nResults\nReferences"
