It was established in October 2011 as a grassroots movement inspired by a manifesto on blogs and center-right platforms. The movement grew and spawned more than 40 branches around the country. The first President was Mihail Neamțu, an intellectual who entered politics. The Vice President is George Mioc. On 16 March 2015, Neamțu announced he was stepping down to focus more on his family.\nGeorge Mioc also left the party in 2015. On 19 September 2015, the party had the fourth Congress in Bucharest and voted a new statute and a new president.\nHistory\nIn July 2012, the party's first National Convention elected Mihail Neamțu as party president. Soon after its founding, the party joined  Right Romania Alliance (ARD), together with the former governing party, Democratic Liberal Party (PDL); Civic Force, the party of former Prime Minister Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu; and the Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party (PNTCD). The party filled 9 candidates on the ARD list at the 2012 legislative election, but because of administrative problems, New Republic's candidates ran as independents or under PNTCD's logo instead.  The party's Vice-President at that time, Valeriu Todiraşcu, was elected to the Senate. In November 2013, the party became a member of the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe (AECR) until 2018.\nElectoral history\nLegislative elections\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Election\n! colspan=\"3\" |Chamber\n! colspan=\"3\" |Senate\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Position\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Aftermath\n|-\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n|-\n!rowspan=4|2012\n|rowspan=4|1,223,189\n|rowspan=4|16.52\n|rowspan=4|\n|rowspan=4|1,239,318\n|rowspan=4|16.71\n|rowspan=4|\n|rowspan=4; style=\"text-align: center;\"|  (within ARD)\n|\n|-\n| (2014)\n|-\n| (2014–2015)\n|-\n| (2015–2017)\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
