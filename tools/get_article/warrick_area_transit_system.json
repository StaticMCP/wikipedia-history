It is a service of Ride Solution, which also provides demand-response transit throughout southwestern Indiana. As of 2019, the system provided 21,058 rides over 12,311 annual vehicle revenue hours with 4 buses.\nHistory\nWATS began service in August 2010 to provide affordable bus service in the county. Ride Solution had provided demand-response service to the elderly and people with disabilities since 2000, but there was a need for improved transit to serve the general public.  Service began August 9 to Newburgh, with the routes to Chandler and Boonville added later.\nService\nWATS operates three weekday bus routes connecting Metropolitan Evansville Transit System riders to destinations in Warrick County. Buses operate deviated fixed-routes to Boonville, Chandler, and Newburgh. Hours of operation for the system are Monday through Friday from 5:45&nbsp;A.M. to 6:00&nbsp;P.M. There is no service on Saturdays and Sundays. Regular fares are $1.00.\nRoutes\n*Chandler/Newburgh East Route\n*Newburgh West Route\n*Boonville Route\nFixed route ridership\nThe ridership statistics shown here are of WATS fixed route services only and do not include demand response services provided by Ride Solution.\n}}\nSee also\n*List of bus transit systems in the United States\n*Metropolitan Evansville Transit System\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://ridesolution.org/wats/ WATS]"
