After temporary positions at Vanderbilt University and under the supervision of Paul Seymour at Princeton University, he became an assistant professor at Tohoku University in 2003, and moved to the National Institute of Informatics in 2006.\nIn 2003, Kawarabayashi was one of three winners of the Kirkman Medal of the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications, an award given by them annually to researchers within four years of their PhD. In 2015, he won the Spring Prize of the Mathematical Society of Japan, its highest honor. He was a keynote speaker at the 2015 International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DWERCmsAAAAJ Google scholar profile]"
