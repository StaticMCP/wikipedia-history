Bangall was incorporated into Muttaburra.\nGeography\nBangall Creek and Western Creek flow through the locality towards the south-east, eventually becoming tributaries of the Thomson River and hence part of the Lake Eyre basin.\nThe predominant land use is cattle grazing.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Bangall.
