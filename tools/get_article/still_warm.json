It features keyboardist Don Grolnick, bass guitarist Darryl Jones and drummer Omar Hakim.\nThe album was his second for Gramavision and was recorded right after leaving Miles Davis's band. He used two musicians from the Davis group, Jones and Hakim, both of whom had also recently recorded and toured with Sting. The album was critically acclaimed, though The Penguin Jazz Guide notes that \"even some Scofield devotees seem unpersuaded of its considerable merits\".\nThe album is ranked number 998 in All-Time Top 1000 Albums (3rd edition, 2000).\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n* John Scofield – guitar\n* Don Grolnick – keyboards\n* Darryl Jones – bass guitar\n* Omar Hakim – drums, electronic percussion\nProduction\n* Jonathan F.
