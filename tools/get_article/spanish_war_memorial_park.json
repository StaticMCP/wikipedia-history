Fred Bauer personally financed the statue's purchase and installation. The Spanish–American War (1898) was a brief conflict between the U.S. and Spain, resulting in U.S. control over former Spanish territories like Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. Volunteers and regular troops from across the country, including Tennessee, played key roles. The park was officially dedicated on December 2, 1956, with several dozen veterans in attendance.  Besides serving as a memorial, the park provides a small area for quiet reflection amid the city bustle, with benches and landscaping contributing to its peaceful atmosphere. There have been proposals to purchase adjacent land from Union Pacific Railroad to enlarge the park, potentially creating more space for memorials, gatherings, and public events.\nThe Hiker Statue\nThe central feature of the park is a bronze statue known as The Hiker, which stands approximately 8 feet tall on a blue granite base. This statue represents the American soldiers—frequently referred to as \"hikers\"—who fought in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. The figure is depicted in a relaxed but alert pose, wearing a campaign hat, carrying a rifle slung over his shoulder, and sporting a cartridge belt — representing the typical uniform and gear of 1898 volunteers. The Hiker was designed by sculptor Theodora Alice Ruggles Kitson and was first installed in 1906 at the University of Minnesota. Memphis's version was erected in 1956, funded by local Spanish War veterans under the leadership of Fred Bauer, a veteran who had stowed away at age 14 to serve in the war.\nReferences"
