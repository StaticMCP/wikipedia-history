Today, King Oscar AS is owned by Thai Union Group, one of the largest seafood producers in the world.\nHistory\nIn 1880, Norwegian fish canneries began exporting sardines. At the World's Fair in Chicago in 1893, the Norwegian exhibition included smoked sardines.\nIn 1903, a year after royal permission had been granted, Chr. Bjelland & Co. first began exporting the King Oscar brand of sardines to the United States, and by 1920, the brand was established in the USA and British markets. In 1965, the company started exporting their sardines to Japan.\nChr. Bjelland & Co. produced a ten-minute film called \"Sardine fishing\" in 1909 to market the brand; this was the first Norwegian commercial. The company also used the slogan \"Out to conquer the world.\"\nIn 1950, various King Oscar brisling sardine products were accorded kosher certification.\nIn 1981, eleven Norwegian canneries merged to form a single company, Norway Foods, which acquired the King Oscar brand. Norway Foods was in turn acquired by Rieber & Søn ASA in 1996. Over the following years, the brand was introduced to various western and eastern European countries, select countries in Asia, to Australia, and South Africa.\nIn 2008, King Oscar's central production facilities were moved to a company-owned facility in Gniewino, Poland. The company continues to maintain a production facility in Svolvær, Norway.\nKing Oscar AS became the new owner of the brand in 2009. The company was purchased by Procuritas Capital Investments in 2010, and by Thai Union Group in 2014.\nProducts\nWhile brisling sardines have always been the company's flagship product, King Oscar produces a widening variety of seafood products. For the USA, the product range includes brisling sardines, skinless & boneless sardines, salmon, mackerel, kipper snacks or traditionally smoked herring, and anchovies. In other parts of the world, the product range includes tuna, cod, and other specialty items, as well as fish salads and fish pâtés.\nReferences\n}}\nFurther reading\n* Johnsen, J. G.
