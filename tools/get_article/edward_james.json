He was reputedly fathered by the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) and in his anecdotal reminiscences, recorded in Swans Reflecting Elephants – My Early Years, Edward James also puts forward this hypothesis. In his memoirs he wrote \"I was not, I was, in fact, his grandson\" saying that it was his grandmother that had an affair with the Prince of Wales. However, there was also popular belief that Forbes was one of the Prince of Wales's mistresses and there was a much-quoted ballad by Hilaire Belloc intimating this at the time.\nEdward James had four older sisters: Audrey, Millicent, Xandra, and Silvia. He was educated at Lockers Park School, then briefly at Eton, then at Le Rosey in Switzerland, and finally at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was a contemporary of Evelyn Waugh (Waugh attended Hertford College) and Harold Acton, a fellow student at Christ Church. When his father died in 1912 he inherited the  West Dean House estate in Sussex, held in trust until he came of age. He was also left a large sum in trust when his uncle John Arthur James died in 1917.\nJames's first sponsorship of note was in publishing John Betjeman's first book of poems when at Oxford. He worked with Brian Howard on the Glass Omnibus. After Oxford, James had a brief career as a trainee diplomat at the embassy in Rome. He was asked to send a coded message to London that the Italians had laid the keels for three destroyers, but got the code wrong; the message said \"300 destroyers\". Shortly after this he was sent \"on indefinite leave\".\nIn the early 1930s, James married Tilly Losch, an Austrian dancer, choreographer, actress and painter. He had several productions created expressly for her, the most notable of which was Les Ballets 1933, which included Kurt Weill, Lotte Lenya and George Balanchine. He and Boris Kochno commissioned that year Brecht and Weill's last collaboration, The Seven Deadly Sins, which Balanchine produced, directed and choreographed.\nJames divorced Losch in 1934, accusing her of adultery with Prince Serge Obolensky, an American hotel executive; her countersuit, in which she made it clear that James was homosexual, failed. James was in fact bisexual. After the divorce, James joined a social set in England which included the Mitford sisters and the composer Lord Berners.\nSurrealism\nJames is best known as a passionate supporter of Surrealism, a movement that evolved from Dada and the political uncertainty and upheaval of World War I and the following years. With a mix of Dada irreverence for the traditional political, religious, and bourgeois values of western civilization that they believed had led the world (and themselves as veterans of the war) to the First World War, the surrealists explored the possibilities that had been opened up by Sigmund Freud regarding the subconscious mind, and the idea of \"pure thought\", unfiltered and uncensored by political, religious, moral, or rational principles.\nHe sponsored Salvador Dalí for the whole of 1938 and his collection of paintings and art objects subsequently came to be accepted as one of the finest collections of surrealist work in private hands. He also provided practical help, supporting Dalí for about two years. They collaborated on the Mae West Sofas and Lobster Telephones, which James had installed in his private home near West Dean House.\nJames appeared in two surrealist paintings, both by Magritte:\n*Not to Be Reproduced\n*The Pleasure Principle: Portrait of Edward James\nSalvador Dali put James in touch with the Belgian surrealist painter René Magritte (1889–1967). James later hosted Magritte for three weeks at his home on 35 Wimpole Street, London in February and March 1937, where Magritte painted a number of gouaches and oils, some of which were new, others were copies of his earlier work. The terms agreed on were that Magritte was to be paid £250 to paint copies or variations of three paintings selected by James from photographs: On the Threshold of Liberty (1929), The Red Model (1935), and The Youth Illustrated (1936) and pay his own travel expenses, while James was to provide a studio space above his garage as well as art supplies and canvases. James intended to install the paintings behind backless mirrors, so as to only be observable in bright light. The new version of [https://www.boijmans.nl/collectie/kunstwerken/4296/le-modele-rouge-iii-het-rode-model-iii The Red Model], painted at James’s request, was a large canvas (72 × 52.5 in.) of higher quality than the original and given a British touch with the addition of a few English coins scattered in the dirt. It is now in the Museum Boijmans van Beuningen, Rotterdam along with the 1937 version of [https://www.boijmans.nl/collectie/kunstwerken/4233/la-jeunesse-illustree-de-geillustreerde-jeugd The Youth Illustrated] (79 × 60 in.). Magritte went on to paint at least seven versions of The Red Model. Magritte also enlarged and reformatted the 1937 version of [https://www.artic.edu/artworks/110970/on-the-threshold-of-liberty On the Threshold of Liberty] (94 × 73 in.), now in the Art Institute of Chicago, from horizontal to vertical to fit the intended installation site for James. In a letter to Louis Scutenaire and Irène Hamoir (February 18, 1937), Magritte wrote \"London is a revelation. Of course, I'm only just beginning to discover it. But until now, everything is perfect (of course I don't speak English, but \"there's something\"). Yesterday evening we went to visit Henry Moore, a charming sculptor, sort of Arp-Picasso...\"\nIn June that year, Magritte painted some portraits of James including Not to be Reproduced and The Pleasure Principle. In the first, James looks into a mirror which shows the back of his head; in the second, James's head is an enigmatic radiating light. Magritte painted Pleasure Principle from photographs of James taken by Man Ray, following Magritte's precise staging instructions. The Pleasure Principle was based on a small ink sketch from the year before, titled Failed Portrait [of Paul Éluard]. In Not to be Reproduced, the book sitting on the mantel is the French edition of Edgar Allan Poe's The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket. James’s art collection included works by Hieronymus Bosch, Giorgio de Chirico, Paul Klee, Leonora Carrington, Pavel Tchelitchew, Pablo Picasso, Giacometti, Max Ernst and Paul Delvaux. Most were sold at a well-publicized sale at Christie's two years after his death.\nHis intellectual interest in surrealism is demonstrated by his sponsorship of Minotaure, a lavish Surrealist magazine published in Paris. His refurbishment of Monkton House, a part of the West Dean Estate, was a Surrealist dream. It was done in collaboration with the pioneering British decorator Syrie Maugham, and has some of the most iconic Surrealist works on display, including the large Mae West Lips Sofa to which Dalí gave the form and colour of the actress's lips, and his Lobster Telephone in white. (The Surrealist tradition at Monkton House was maintained when the interior designer Derek Frost did extensive work to the house and designed more custom pieces of furniture in the late 1980s.) James donated these two items (among others) to the Brighton Museum & Art Gallery. James's most fantastic Surrealist creation was a sculpture garden in the Mexican rainforest, \"Las Pozas\".\nNew Mexico\nIn 1940, James stayed in Taos, New Mexico, United States, as a guest of Mabel Dodge Luhan, where he was known for his amusing, clever eccentricity and effeminate manner. In Taos, he met the Hon. Dorothy Brett, an impoverished British aristocrat and painter, who in 1941 sold him nine paintings for $580. He later invited the 70-year-old Brett (as she was known) to return to Britain and reside at West Dean, but she declined.\nLas Pozas\nLas Pozas (\"the Pools\") is a garden created by James near the village of Xilitla, San Luis Potosí, more than  above sea level, in a subtropical rainforest in the Sierra Gorda mountains of Mexico. It includes more than  of natural waterfalls and pools interlaced with towering Surrealist sculptures in concrete. Massive sculptures up to four stories tall punctuate the site. The many trails throughout the garden site are composed of steps, ramps, bridges, and narrow winding walkways that traverse the valley walls. Construction of Las Pozas cost more than $5 million. To pay for it, James sold his collection of Surrealist art at auction.\nWest Dean\nIn 1964, James gave his English estate, which included West Dean House at West Dean, to a charitable trust. The Edward James Foundation comprises West Dean College, a centre for the preservation of traditional arts and crafts. The college offers both short courses and full-time diploma and master’s degree programs. One of only two professional tapestry weaving studios in the UK and an art gallery are housed at the   estate, which is open to the public through the West Dean Gardens.\nWest Dean College was set up in 1971 in response to James's vision of establishing \"an educational foundation where creative talents can be discovered and developed, and where one can spread culture through the teaching of crafts and the preservation of knowledge that might otherwise be destroyed or forgotten\".\nEdward James is buried in the St Roche's Arboretum at West Dean, with the simple inscription Edward James 1907 – 1984 Poet. The stone was carved by John Skelton.\nFile:West Dean House (2).JPG|West Dean House, West Sussex, UK\nFile:Plaque Edward James's sisters.JPG|St Andrew's West Dean, West Sussex, UK\nFile:Edward James.JPG|Grave of Edward James, West Dean, West Sussex, UK.\nFile:The St Roches' Arboretum at West Dean.jpg|The St Roche's Arboretum at West Dean, West Sussex, UK\nWritings\nI have seen such beauty as one man has seldom seen;\n:therefore will I be grateful to die in this little room,\nsurrounded by the forests, the great green gloom\n:of trees my only gloom – and the sound, the sound of green.\nHere amid the warmth of the rain, what might have been\n:is resolved into the tenderness of a tall doom\nwho says: 'You did your best, rest' – and after you the bloom\n:of what you loved and planted still will whisper what you mean.\nAnd the ghosts of the birds I loved, will attend me each a friend;\n:like them shall I have flown beyond the realm of words.\nYou, through the trees, shall hear them, long after the end\n:calling me beyond the river. For the cries of birds\ncontinue, as – defended by the cortege of their wings –\n:my soul among strange silences yet sings.\n—Edward James, Poet 1907 – 1984\n* E.

Museo Edward James contains a collection of wooden moulds used in the construction of Las Pozas, books written by James, photographs and drawings. It also features a rare painting by James, made under the supervision of his friend, Leonora Carrington. The museum is located across the road from the sculpture garden at Las Pozas.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.junglegossip.com/index.htm Edward James, Builder of Dreams] , documentary film by Avery Danziger\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170525093007/http://edwardjameslaspozas.com/ Surreal Eden: Edward James & Las Pozas], by Margaret Hooks\n* [http://www.westdean.org.uk West Dean, the Edward James Foundation]\n*  1978 George Melly interviews with Edward James\n* Virtual tour app of [https://web.archive.org/web/20131220012745/https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/las-pozas-steps-falls/id643497578?mt=8 Las Pozas: Steps & Falls] available on iTunes store"
