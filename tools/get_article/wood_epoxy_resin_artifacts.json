These materials are often used in woodworking, furniture design, sculpture, and crafts due to the contrasting aesthetics of wood grains and translucent or colored resins. The combination is known for its artistic appeal, durability, and versatility, although, some health concerns for the artists have been raised in the media.\nOverview\nEpoxy resin is a synthetic polymer that cures to form a strong, stable plastic. When used in combination with solid wood (e.g. species like olive, walnut, beech, etc.), it enhances the physical properties of the final product by increasing its strength and resistance to moisture and wear. This combination has led to a rise in popularity of wood–epoxy resin items, especially in high-end and custom-made applications.\nCommon forms of wood–epoxy resin artifacts include:\n* River tables – tables where resin fills the gap between two live-edge wood slabs, resembling a flowing river.\n* Cutting boards and serving trays – resin is used for decorative inlays or structural filling.\n* Art pieces and sculptures – combining aesthetic patterns and colors using dyed resins.\n* Jewelry and small accessories – miniature resin-wood designs popular in boutique craftsmanship.\nMaterials and techniques\nThe choice of wood and resin type greatly influences the final appearance and structural integrity of the artifact. Hardwood species such as walnut, maple, and oak are commonly used due to their strength and visual grain. By this way/technique, also wood specimens with defects or cracks, or even rotted ones, can be utilised in a very efficient way.\nThe epoxy resin may be clear, but in most cases is pigmented, allowing for creative freedom in the design process. Modern techniques often include:\n* Casting: Pouring liquid resin into a mold or void within the wood.\n* Embedding: Placing objects (e.g., stones, leaves, pigments) into resin layers.\n* Turning: Shaping hardened resin-wood blanks on a lathe for bowls and pens.\nApplications\nOriginally utilized in marine construction and aerospace composites, wood–epoxy combinations now dominate niche markets in home décor and custom interiors.\nThe appeal lies not only in the visual aesthetics but also in the customizable and repairable nature of the materials. The market for resin-wood artifacts has grown through online craft platforms and social media, with many independent makers showcasing unique creations.\nEnvironmental considerations\nThe use of synthetic resins raises concerns about sustainability and recyclability. Some manufacturers have begun exploring bio-based epoxy resins to mitigate environmental impact.\nSee also\n* Epoxy\n* Composite material\n* Woodworking\n* Furniture design\n* Resin casting\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.instructables.com/id/Wood-and-Epoxy-River-Table/ Wood and Epoxy River Table Tutorial on Instructables]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TU7SzGFP28 Amazing Ideas with Wood and Epoxy Resin]"
