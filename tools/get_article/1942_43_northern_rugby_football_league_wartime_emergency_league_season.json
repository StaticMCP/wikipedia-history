Three clubs dropped out before the season started. Only 14 of the pre-war clubs participated with only three; Oldham, St Helens and Wigan from west of the Pennines.\nSeason summary\nThe 1942–43 season began on Saturday 5 September 1942. As in the previous season, there were still only three Lancashire clubs, the Northern Rugby League continued with a single 14 club  competition. As the clubs were playing different number of marches, the league positions were decided on a win percentage basis.\nAt the completion of the regular season Wigan were on top of the league with a percentage success of 81.25% and Dewsbury were second (78.12%). Although Bradford Northern won more games than anyone else their percentage success was only 73.80%, and consequently they finished third. St Helens finished last with only two wins from 15.\nDewsbury went on to defeat Halifax 33–16 on aggregate in the play-off final, however the Championship was declared null and void as the Dewsbury had fielded an ineligible player in the semi-final.\nIn the Rugby league Challenge Cup Final, Dewsbury beat Leeds 16–15 on aggregate over two legs in front of an aggregate crowd of 26,470.\nChange in participation\nThe RFL announced the fixture list at the end of July 1942 with 15 clubs entered. This was a reduction of two from the previous year as Bramley and Castleford had already notified the RFL of their intentions not to take part in the season.  However before the season started, Hunslet's football committee announced their withdrawal due to the amount of travel required. The Hunslet committee's decision was contested by the members of the club who forced a special meeting of the club at which a resolution was passed instructing the committee to withdraw the notice given to the RFL, subject to additional financial guarantors being found. Meeting between prospective guarantors and the committee failed to reach agreement and Hunslet's withdrawal from the league stood, leaving the league with 14 clubs.\nChampionship\n|win_WIG=13\t|draw_WIG=0\t|loss_WIG=3\t|pf_WIG=301\t|pa_WIG=141\t|team1=WIG|name_WIG=Wigan\n|win_DEW=12\t|draw_DEW=1\t|loss_DEW=3\t|pf_DEW=270\t|pa_DEW=117\t|team2=DEW|name_DEW=Dewsbury\n|win_BRA=13\t|draw_BRA=1\t|loss_BRA=5\t|pf_BRA=312\t|pa_BRA=183\t|team3=BRA|name_BRA=Bradford Northern\n|win_HFX=13\t|draw_HFX=0\t|loss_HFX=6\t|pf_HFX=297\t|pa_HFX=149\t|team4=HFX|name_HFX=Halifax\n|win_LEE=11\t|draw_LEE=1\t|loss_LEE=5\t|pf_LEE=337\t|pa_LEE=145\t|team5=LEE|name_LEE=Leeds\n|win_HUD=12\t|draw_HUD=0\t|loss_HUD=6\t|pf_HUD=215\t|pa_HUD=189\t|team6=HUD|name_HUD=Huddersfield\n|win_WFD=11\t|draw_WFD=1\t|loss_WFD=7\t|pf_WFD=267\t|pa_WFD=192\t|team7=WFD|name_WFD=Wakefield Trinity\n|win_FEV=10\t|draw_FEV=1\t|loss_FEV=8\t|pf_FEV=179\t|pa_FEV=138\t|team8=FEV|name_FEV=Featherstone Rovers\n|win_KEI=5\t|draw_KEI=2\t|loss_KEI=11|pf_KEI=145\t|pa_KEI=235\t|team9=KEI|name_KEI=Keighley\n|win_BAT=4\t|draw_BAT=0\t|loss_BAT=11|pf_BAT=158\t|pa_BAT=294\t|team10=BAT|name_BAT=Batley\n|win_HUL=4\t|draw_HUL=0\t|loss_HUL=11|pf_HUL=125\t|pa_HUL=295\t|team11=HUL|name_HUL=Hull\n|win_OLD=4\t|draw_OLD=0\t|loss_OLD=15|pf_OLD=142\t|pa_OLD=306\t|team12=OLD|name_OLD=Oldham\n|win_YOU=3\t|draw_YOU=1\t|loss_YOU=13|pf_YOU=112\t|pa_YOU=311\t|team13=YOU|name_YOU=York\n|win_STH=2\t|draw_STH=0\t|loss_STH=13|pf_STH=108\t|pa_STH=273\t|team14=STH|name_STH=St. Helens\n}}\nChampionship play-offs\nQualifying game\nOn 1 May 1943 Bradford Northern beat Huddersfield 16–13 at Odsal Stadium, Bradford in the qualifying game.\nSemi-finals\nThe semi-finals were played on 8 May 1943.
