The awards are sponsored by PTAC, the Professional Theatre Awards Council, and were named in honor of Kevin Kline, a St. Louis native who has been the recipient of both Tony and Academy Awards.\nEligibility and judging\nIn order for a play to be considered for a Kevin Kline Award, it must:\n* Be produced within the St. Louis metro area\n* Include at least six performances\n* Have paid those who work on the show, including both actors and crew\nEach nominee is reviewed by seven judges, who are drawn randomly from a pool of 49. Judges then give each production a numerical rating on each of the available categories (acting, directing, lighting, etc.) and submit their ballot within 24 hours of seeing the production. At the end of each year, the five productions with the highest score in each category are listed as the nominees, and the award goes to the one with the best score:\nThe first award ceremony was held on March 20, 2006, in the Roberts Orpheum Theatre, and hosted by St. Louis-native Broadway actor Jason Danieley. Presenters included Kline, and St. Louis-born Broadway actor Ken Page. Kline received the first-ever Kevin Kline Award to be created, and was also told at the performance about the creation of the Kevin Kline Theater Ticket Fund, which will provide free tickets to area high school students.\nThe Kevin Kline Awards were suspended in June 2012 due to financial concerns.\n2006 Awards\nOutstanding Production of a Musical\n* 'West Side Story, The Muny\nOutstanding Production of a Play\n* Take Me Out, The Repertory Theatre of St. Louis\nOutstanding Director of a Musical\n* Kevin Backstrom, West Side Story, The Muny\n* Michael Hamilton, Footloose, Stages St. Louis\nOutstanding Director of a Play\n* Rob Ruggiero, Take Me Out, The Repertory Theatre of St. Louis\nOutstanding Musical Direction\n* Kelsey Halbert, West Side Story, The Muny\nOutstanding Choreography\n* Dana Lewis, Footloose, Stages St. Louis\nOutstanding Costume Design\n* Reggie Ray, Crowns, The Repertory Theatre of St. Louis\nOutstanding Lighting Design\n* John Lasiter, Take Me Out, The Repertory Theatre of St. Louis\nOutstanding Set Design\n* Christopher Pickart, The Tempest, Shakespeare Festival St. Louis\nOutstanding Sound Design\n* Ann Slayton & Robin Weatherall, The Tempest, Shakespeare Festival St. Louis\nOutstanding New Play or Musical\n* The Ensemble, So to Speak, Washington Avenue Players Project\nOutstanding Ensemble in a Play\n* Going to See the Elephant, Orange Girls\nOutstanding Ensemble in a Musical\n* West Side Story, The Muny\nOutstanding Lead Actor in a Musical\n* Ben Nordstrom, Footloose, Stages St. Louis\nOutstanding Lead Actor in a Play\n* Nat DeWolf, Take Me Out, The Repertory Theatre of St. Louis\nOutstanding Lead Actress in a Musical\n*  Zoe Vonder Haar, Hello, Dolly!, Stages St. Louis\nOutstanding Lead Actress in a Play\n* Michelle Hand, Separate Tables, Act Inc.\n* Nancy Lewis, Going to See the Elephant, Orange Girls\nOutstanding Supporting Actor in a Musical\n* Ken Page, Jesus Christ Superstar, The Muny\nOutstanding Supporting Actor in a Play\n* Gary Wayne Barker, Driving Miss Daisy, New Jewish Theatre\nOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Musical\n* Natascia Diaz, West Side Story, The Muny\nOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Play\n* Brooke Edwards, Going to See the Elephant, Orange Girls\nOutstanding Production for Young Audiences\n* Bah!
