It was Miller's fifth single for Smash Records. The song won Miller 5 Grammy Awards in 1966.\nHistory\nThe crossover record reached number one on the Billboard US Country chart,  number four on the Billboard Hot 100, and number one on the Easy Listening surveys. It was also number one in the UK Singles Chart and in Norway. Miller recalled that the song was inspired when he was driving and saw a sign on the side of a barn that read, \"Trailers for sale or rent\". This became the opening line of the song.\nIn June 1966, Richard Pryor performed the song on the premiere episode of Kraft Summer Music Hall.\nA comic version by English entertainer Billy Howard, \"King of the Cops\", reached number on the British charts 1976.\nIn 1987, R.E.M. covered the song and included it on their Dead Letter Office compilation album. Guitarist Peter Buck later commented, \"If there was any justice in the world, Roger Miller should be able to sue for what we did to this song.\"\n\"King of the Road\" won Roger Miller five Grammy Awards at the 1966 8th Annual Grammy Awards Ceremony. It won for Best Contemporary (R&R) Single, Best Contemporary (R&R) Vocal Performance - Male, Best Country and Western Single, Best Country and Western Vocal Performance - Male & Best Country and Western Song. He also won a Grammy for Best Country and Western Album The Return of Roger Miller.\nCritical reception\nIn 2024, Rolling Stone ranked the song at number 60 on its 200 Greatest Country Songs of All Time list.\nPersonnel\nCredits:\n* Roger Miller – vocals\n* Buddy Killen – guitar\n* Thumbs Carllile – finger snaps\n* Bob Moore – double bass\n* unknown – piano, drums, tambourine\nCharts\nRoger Miller\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1965)\n!align=\"center\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|UK Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Norwegian Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Easy Listening\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Hot 100\n|align=\"center\"|4\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Irish Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|5\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Canadian RPM Top Singles\n|align=\"center\"|10\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Dutch Top40\n|align=\"center\"|14\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Dutch Official Chart\n|align=\"center\"|5\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|German Official Chart\n|align=\"center\"|26\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|French TEF/TMP\n|align=\"center\"|6\n|}\nThe Proclaimers\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1990)\n!align=\"center\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Australian Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|78\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Luxembourg (Radio Luxembourg)\n|align=\"center\"|6\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Irish Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|8\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|UK Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|9\n|}\nRandy Travis\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1997)\n!align=\"center\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|}\nCertifications\n\"Queen of the House\"\nCountry music singer Jody Miller (no relation) answered \"King of the Road\" with \"Queen of the House\" (1965).  The song used Roger Miller's music while changing the lyrics to describe the day-to-day life of a stay-at-home mom. The words were written by Mary Taylor. The song was a hit, reaching number 12 on ''Billboard's''' Hot 100 and number five on the Hot Country Singles chart. It also won a Grammy for Female Country Vocal Performance.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.rogermiller.com/KingOfTheRoadEDIT.html Sample]  from the Roger Miller official site"
