He also played three matches for the club which were considered 'second-class' matches, when Somerset had their first-class status removed from 1886 to 1890.  Although his highest first-class score was 10, made against Lancashire in 1891, he had made 41 the previous season against Glamorgan, in a match not considered first-class.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
