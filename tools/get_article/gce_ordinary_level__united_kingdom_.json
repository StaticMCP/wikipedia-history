The O-level was meant to act as a pathway to the new, more in-depth and academically rigorous A-level (Advanced Level), in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nAlternatives to the GCE Ordinary level were released during the qualification's timeline, including the complementary and more vocational Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE), intended for broadening the subjects available and offering qualifications in non-academic subjects, alongside the even more academically rigorous foundation for the GCE A-Level, called the AO-Level.\nThe O-Level, AO-Level and CSE were replaced in the United Kingdom in 1988 by the GCSE and later complementary IGCSE exams. The Scottish equivalent was the O-grade (replaced, following a separate process, by the Standard Grade). An O-level branded qualification is still awarded by Cambridge International Examinations in select locations.\nBeginnings\nThe GCE Ordinary level was introduced in 1951 to replace the School Certificate in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It was part of the UK’s post-war education reforms, alongside the GCE Advanced Level (or GCE A-Level), which had replaced the UK Higher School Certificate. With subject-based exam-only assessments, the GCE O-Level was intended to be an academically rigorous preparation for GCE A-Level study. The examinations were conducted by regional boards, with schools given the freedom to choose the board of their choice.\nThe qualification was introduced around the same timeline when Scotland's equivalent, the O-grade (replaced by the Standard Grade), was released.\nDirectly connected to the GCE O-Level was the AO-Level (Alternative Ordinary Level), formerly available in most subject areas. Sometimes incorrectly known as the Advanced Ordinary Level, the AO-Level syllabus and examination both assumed a higher degree of maturity on the part of candidates and employed teaching methods more commonly associated with A-Level study. The AO-Level was discontinued, with final qualifications awarded in 1988.\nStructure\nO-levels were predominantly exam-based; this had advantages for students in part-time or evening education. Some commentators criticised this mainly exam-based approach as offering only partial proof of the student's overall ability in comparison with other methods (e.g., coursework-based assessment). There was no summative 'school certificate': each subject was a separate O-level in its own right.\nMadsen Pirie argued that the O-level was unfairly biased to boys because of the emphasis on exam-based learning, and therefore girls were placed at a disadvantage. Pirie also observes that the GCSE focus on coursework has now disadvantaged boys, and has reversed the gender gap in attainment to the level where, in all subjects, girls outperform boys.\nGrading\nUntil 1975, candidates were awarded only a pass or fail classification. Although candidates received an approximate indication of the marks awarded, O-Level Certificates simply listed those subjects in which a pass had been awarded; subjects in which a candidate had failed were not mentioned. The independent exam boards soon offered competing numeric and alphabetic classifications, for example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 would be a pass, while grades 7, 8 and 9 were fails from the JMB.  From 1975 standardized alphabetic grades where introduced with grades A, B, C, D, and E were passes, and F and U (Unclassified) were fails. Between 1975 and 1985 grades were allocated primarily on a norm-referenced basis, assigning a fixed proportion of each cohort to each grade (A 10%, B 15%, C 25–30%, D 5–10%, E 5–10%, U 15–20%). Though some exceptions existed, both at the subject and Exam Board level, with Latin and Greek pass rates being consistently higher than other subjects, with 75.4% passing in 1976, in contrast to an average 59% pass rate across all subjects e.g. Biology 56.4%, History 57%. The pass rate and top awards by the Oxford & Cambridge board were also consistently higher than the other boards e.g. In 1976, 27% of Latin entrants gained an A, and ~17% of French, German and Music candidates, this was attributed to the O&C board being primarily used by the Independent schools. The proportion obtaining a pass, A-D, or equivalent was initially fixed at 57% – 58%, and remained under 60% through the 1970s, though there was regional variation with Northern Ireland awarding consistently more pass grades than Wales e.g. In 1982, the pass rates were: Northern Ireland 62%, England 58% Wales 53%. In 1984 a decision was taken, by the Secondary Examinations Council, to replace the norm referencing with criteria referencing, where 16+ and 18+ grades would in future be awarded on Examiner Judgement, this change was implemented, at O-Level, in June 1986. In the final year DES statistics were available 6.8% achieved an A, and 39.8% an A-C grade.\nO-levels incorporate an element of negative marking, with marks deducted for incorrect answers, poor spelling, grammar or handwriting.\nThe table below gives rough equivalences between O-Level, CSE, and GCSE grades, including later changes to GCSE grades in 1994 and the 2010s:\nFor GCSE Mathematics from 1988 there was an extension paper allowing candidates to achieve 3 grades higher than an A (pass, merit, and distinction). This was stopped.\nEntrants\nThe 1978 Waddell Report, when comparing O-Level and CSE entrants stated: \"the O Level examination tending to be aimed at the upper 20 per cent of the full ability range and CSE catering for the next 40 per cent.\" This conclusion is partially supported by the statistics. After 1976, for subjects where an equivalent O-level paper existed, approximately 36% of the pupils entered for either exam sat the O-Level; the remainder (64%) sat the CSE paper. The proportion taking CSE exams increased following the raising of the minimum school-leaving age to 16, in 1973, and the subsequent fall in the proportion sitting neither exam e.g.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ English O-Level and CSE Mathematics entrants 1976-9\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year !! rowspan=\"2\"|Pupils !! colspan=\"3\"|Numbers of maths candidates!! colspan=\"2\"| % Maths papers!! rowspan=\"2\"|% Pupils entered for maths\n|-\n!

The GCE was first announced in 1984, phased in by 1986 with a couple of subjects, and completed for all subjects the following year. By the 1988 exam sittings, the GCSE had officially replaced the O-level, with the last O-levels sat in 1987 in certain subjects. The O-level brand is still used in many Commonwealth countries, such as Bangladesh, Mauritius, Sri Lanka, and Singapore, instead of or alongside the IGCSE qualifications. The Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination was also benchmarked against the O-levels for comparable subjects. But it has switched to benchmark against the IGCSE. The School Certificate of Mauritius continues to use the O-level exams.\nO-levels continue to thrive as well respected international qualifications for students in other countries, who use them for preparation for advanced study in their own country and/or access higher education overseas.. Institutions that offer O-levels include Cambridge International Examinations (CIE).\nCambridge International Examinations offers curricula for approximately 40 different subjects.\nSee also\n* Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE)\n* General Certificate of Education (GCE), which comprises O Levels and A levels\n** GCE Ordinary Level (International) (O Level), for the use of O Levels in other countries\n** GCE Advanced Level (A Level)\n* General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE), which replaced the O Levels and CSE\n* School Certificate predecessor to the GCE O Level and CSE qualifications\nReferences"
