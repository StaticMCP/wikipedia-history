The town is located in the Darling Downs on the New England Highway,  from the state capital, Brisbane and  from the nearby city of Toowoomba. In the , the locality of Crows Nest had a population of 2,212 people.\nGeography\neast of the town is the Crows Nest National Park.\nHistory\nJarowair (also known as Yarowair, Yarow-wair, Barrunggam, Yarrowair, Yarowwair and Yarrow-weir) is one of the languages of the Toowoomba region. The Jarowair language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Toowoomba Regional Council, particularly Toowoomba north to Crows Nest and west to Oakey.\nThe origin of the name is uncertain. One claim is that it was named after an Aboriginal man, Jimmy Crow, who gave directions to early European settlers. He lived in a big hollow tree near the police station, which became known as Crows Nest. It became a popular overnight camp for the bullock teams hauling timber, which in turn attracted farmers and settlers. Another claim is that the name derives from the indigenous name for the area Tookoogandanna, meaning \"the home of crows\". Some researchers acknowledge there are many possible origins of the name.\nA pastoral station raising sheep was established in 1849. In 1875, large sections of the pastoral station were offered for selection.\nCrows Nest was declared a town in 1876. The town was originally centred around Albert Street and South Street (approx ).\nThe construction of Crow's Nest Provisional School was completed on  2 February 1877.  Provided by the local community, the building was  with a shingle roof and veranda. The school opened on 12 March 1877. On 25 October 1880, it became Crows Nest State School. It was on a  site on the western side of Dale Street (now Dale Street South, approx ).\nCrows Nest Post Office opened on 1 July 1878.\nIn December 1880, the Primitive Methodist Church purchased  of land for a church. The church opened on Easter Sunday on 17 April 1881. On Sunday 31 December 1905, a new Crows Nest Methodist Church was officially opened by Reverend Henry Youngman, replacing the 1880 church. The 1905 church was  with two classrooms at the rear, each . The land cost £160 and the building £360, a total of £520. In 1956, the church was remodelled. After the Methodist Church amalgamated into the Uniting Church in Australia in 1977, it became the Crows Nest District Uniting Church.\nThe Crows Nest branch railway line from Toowoomba was completed in 1886. It was built to service a number of sawmills and the dairying district. The terminus was at Crows Nest railway station, just north of Curnow Street where Community Place and the swimming pool are today (approx ). Due to the importance of a railway station for a rural community, the area around it soon became regarded as the town centre. The railway closed in the early 1960s.\nIn 1913, the Shire of Crows Nest was formed with the town becoming the administrative centre for the new local government area. The shire expanded in 1949 and was merged into the Toowoomba Region local government area in 2008.\nOn 15 July 1917, St Matthew's Catholic Primary School opened on the eastern side Esk Street (approx ). It has subsequently closed and the site is now vacant land.\nRecognising the town's shift northwards towards the railway station, in 1947, a new  site was reserved on the western side of Littleton Street for a new school which would incorporate a secondary department. However, approval to build the new school was delayed until 1958. As the new school was not completed, the secondary department opened in 1959 in the Church of England Parish Hall. In late 1959, the new school was opened.\nOn Saturday 7 April 1951, Archbishop Reginald Halse dedicated a new Anglican church in Crows Nest, built from concrete blocks. In 2019 the Anglican parish of Crows Nest entered in a partnership with St David's Anglican Church in Chelmer, Brisbane, to share their ministry through a combination of services at the various churches combined with online services from St David's, as an experiment in how the Anglican Church might operate in the future.\nIn the 1950s and 60s the town's population declined, together with the local industries.\nA 6-foot 6-inch high statue of Jimmy Crow was unveiled in the Centenary Park at Crows Nest on 12 July 1969 by Minister for Labour and Tourism, John Herbert. The statue was sculpted by Fred Gardiner of the Tia Art Gallery. The statue was cut from a single block of Helidon freestone and weighs over one ton. An 18-foot high hollow tree stump was also moved to Centenary Park and a fig tree was planted on top so the roots could be trained around it to form a living hollow tree. It is believed to be the only memorial in Australia to an Aboriginal person after whom a town was named.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Crows Nest had a population of 2160 people.\nIn the , the locality of Crows Nest had a population of 2,212 people.\nHeritage listings\nCrows Nest has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* Crows Nest Post Office, 19 Curnow Street\nEducation\nCrow's Nest State School is a government primary and secondary (Prep-10) school for boys and girls at 1 Littleton Street ().
