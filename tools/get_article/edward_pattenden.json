Pattenden was a right-handed batsman, though his bowling style is unknown.  He was born at Brighton, Sussex.\nHammond made his first-class debut for Sussex against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane, Sheffield in 1873.  He made three further first-class appearances for Sussex, the last of which came against Hampshire in 1875 at the Green Jackets Ground, Winchester.  He struggled in his four first-class matches, scoring just 6 runs at an average of 1.50, with a high score of 3 not out, while with the ball he bowled a total of 26 wicketless overs.\nHe died at the town of his birth on 3 June 1879.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/18789.html Edward Pattenden] at ESPNcricinfo\n*[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/31/31913/31913.html Edward Pattenden] at CricketArchive"
