      "text": "# List of Queen's Counsel in England and Wales appointed in 1954\n\nA '''Queen's Counsel (post-nominal QC), or King's Counsel (post-nominal KC''') during the reign of a king, is an eminent lawyer (usually a barrister or advocate) who is appointed by the monarch to be one of \"Her Majesty's Counsel learned in the law.\" The term is recognised as an honorific. Appointments are made from within the legal profession on the basis of merit rather than a particular level of experience. Members have the privilege of sitting within the bar of court. As members wear silk gowns of a particular design (see court dress), appointment as Queen's Counsel is known informally as taking silk, and hence QCs are often colloquially called silks.\nThe rank emerged in the sixteenth century, but came to prominence over the course of the nineteenth. Appointment was open to barristers only until 1995. The first women KCs had been appointed only in 1949.\n1954\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"20%\" |Name\n! width=\"15%\" |Inns of Court\n! width=\"20%\" |University\n!Notes\n!Ref\n|-\n| height=\"19\" |Ronald Owen Lloyd Armstrong-Jones, MBE\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| height=\"19\" |Sir John Rowlatt, KCIE, CB, MC\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| height=\"19\" |Clive Stuart Saxon Burt\n|Gray's Inn\n(1925)\n|University College, Oxford\n|Burt was born in 1900 and graduated from Oxford in 1922 with a history degree.
