It is responsible for maintaining British ties with Hong Kong and Macau.\nTogether with the Consulate General of the United States of America, Hong Kong and Macau; the Consulate General of Malaysia; and the Consulate General of the Republic of Indonesia, the British consulate general is among the few consulates general in Hong Kong to be housed in its own building.\nRole\nDue to Hong Kong's status as a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China, the consul general in Hong Kong reports directly to the China Department of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, instead of to the British ambassador to Beijing, unlike consuls general in mainland China. The consulate general in Hong Kong also serves Macau, with several diplomats accredited specifically to Macau.\nThe consulate general was also the Regional Passport Processing Centre, handling passport applications from British citizens resident elsewhere in Asia.\nPreviously, it also processed applications received by the British Trade and Cultural Office (now called the British Office) in Taipei, Taiwan. It also received registrations of marriages from British nationals in Taiwan, although there was no legal requirement for British nationals to do so.\nThis role ceased in 2014, and all passport-related matters have since been handled by His Majesty's Passport Office in the UK. Furthermore, visa application matters are outsourced to a separate company since 2015.\nHistory\nWhen Hong Kong was under British rule, the governor represented the British government, as well as the British monarch as head of state. Matters relating to British nationality were handled by the Hong Kong Immigration Department.\nDuring the negotiations between Britain and China on the future of Hong Kong, the British proposed the establishment of a \"British commissioner\" following transfer of sovereignty to China. Some of the diplomatic representatives of Commonwealth countries in Hong Kong were already known as \"commissioners\". This was rejected by the Chinese as an attempt to make the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region into a member or associated member of the Commonwealth.\nHowever, the United Kingdom's commercial interests were represented by the British Trade Commission. The last senior trade commissioner (1993-1997), Francis Cornish, became the first British consul general following the transfer of sovereignty to China, on 1 July 1997.\nThe consulate general was designed by British architects Terry Farrell and Partners. Opened by Princess Anne on 30 January 1997, it was a HK$290&nbsp;million project, with the British Council in an adjoining building opened in December that year.\nThe consul general has resided at a rented flat at Opus Hong Kong since 2013.\nList of HM consuls general\nList of HM consuls general in Hong Kong:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Name\n!Tenure began\n!Tenure ended\n!Tenure length\n!Date of birth (and age)when published\n!Prior Role\n!Subsequent Role\n|-\n|1\n|Francis Cornish(zh)||July 1997||November 1997\n|||\n|Senior Trade Commissioner to Hong Kong\n|Head of FCDO News Department\n|-\n|2\n| Sir Andrew Burns(zh)||November 1997||June 2000\n|||\n|Deputy Under Secretary of State\n|British High Commissioner to Canada\n|-\n|3\n| Sir James Hodge(zh)||June 2000||November 2003\n|||\n|British Ambassador to Thailand\n|Retired from Diplomatic Service\n|-\n|4\n|Stephen Bradley(zh)||November 2003||March 2008\n|||\n|Minister, Deputy Head of Mission & Consul General to Beijing, China\n|Retired from Diplomatic Service\n|-\n|5\n| Andrew Seaton(zh)||March 2008||September 2012\n|||\n|Consul General to Chicago, USA\n|Retired from Diplomatic Service\n|-\n|6\n|Caroline Wilson(zh)||September 2012 ||September 2016\n|||\n|Minister Counsellor to Moscow, Russia\n|Europe Director at the FCDO\nBritish Ambassador to China\n|-\n|7\n|Andrew Heyn(zh)||September 2016||December 2020\n|||\n|Director, Leadership, Governance & Diversity Strategy at the Cabinet Office\n|Retired from Diplomatic Service\n|-\n|–\n|Tamsin Heath (acting)\n|December 2020\n|July 2021\n|\n|\n|Deputy Consul General to Hong Kong\n|Deputy Consul General to Hong Kong\n|-\n|8\n|Brian Davidson(zh)\n|July 2021\n|Incumbent\n|\n|\n|British Ambassador to Thailand\n|\n|}\nSee also\n* British Consul General to Hong Kong and Macao\n*List of diplomatic missions of the United Kingdom\n*Consular missions in Hong Kong\n*Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office, London\n*Hong Kong–United Kingdom relations\n*Foreign Office and Colonial Office\n*Consulate General of Canada in Hong Kong and Macao\n*Consulate General of the United States, Hong Kong and Macau\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
