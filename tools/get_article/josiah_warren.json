He is seen as part of the philosophical anarchist tradition and has been described as a \"libertarian\" or an \"individualist anarchist\" avant la lettre. Warren did not refer to himself as an \"anarchist\" but instead identified as a \"democrat\";  the politonym of a follower of his movement was \"equitist\".}}\n}}\nJosiah Warren (; June 26, 1798 – April 14, 1874) was an American social reformer, inventor, musician, businessman, and philosopher.\nHe is regarded as the first American philosophical anarchist; he took an active part in Robert Owen's experimental community at New Harmony, Indiana, in 1825–1826.}} of communism, being owned by cellular units while promoting equitable distribution and a system of time chits.\nA pioneer in printing technology, he invented America's first continuous-feed rotary press, that was capable of producing 60 copies per minute, in contrast to the 5 copies produced by standard presses of that time. This invention was exhibited in New York City in 1832, and, according to the 19th-century newspaper The Engraver and Electrotyper, \"one of the crowds that went to see the new machine was Robert Hoe,\" the founder of the R. Hoe & Company. A few years later, Hoe & Company began producing a press based on the same principle, which would revolutionize printing by the late nineteenth century.\nWarren is also recognized for his contributions to the development of coal-oil stoves and for being one of the first to establish a trade school in the United States. His philosophical work has been appreciated across the political spectrum, influencing prominent intellectuals such as Herbert Spencer, Benjamin Tucker, Émile Armand, and John Stuart Mill. By the 20th century, he was cited by Robert Nozick in Anarchy, State, and Utopia (1974), where Nozick explores the concept of a meta-utopia – a collection of coexisting utopias.\nBiography\nEarly life\nWarren was born June 26, 1798. He moved from Boston to Cincinnati, Ohio, where he worked as a music teacher and orchestra leader. They had two children, Caroline (1820–1850) and George (1826–1902), and George wrote a remembrance of his father that can be found in the Labadie Library at the University of Michigan. He invented a tallow-burning lamp in 1821 and manufactured his invention for a number of years in Cincinnati.\nOwenism and New Harmony\nIn 1825, Warren became aware of the \"social system\" of Robert Owen and began to talk with others in Cincinnati about founding a communist colony. He decided to join Owen's experiment at New Harmony. Early that year, Warren sold his lamp factory and, along with his family, joined Owen and nearly 900 Owenites from across the country on the Rappite estates, which Owen had acquired. Together, they hoped to create an ideal community that would pave the way for a new era of peace, abundance, brotherhood, and happiness, ultimately envisioning this model as something that could embrace all of humanity.\nCincinnati and Utopia\nOn May 18, 1827, Warren put his theories to the test by establishing an experimental \"labor for labor store\" which locals soon began calling the \"Time Store.\" It was located in Downtown Cincinnati, which facilitated trade by notes backed by a promise to perform labor. This was the first store to use a labor-for-labor note.The Time Store worked as follows: every item had a clear price tag, reflecting its cost price plus a nominal percentage for expenses like shipping, shrinkage, rent, etc., typically around four cents on the dollar. The customer picked out what they needed with minimal help from the salesperson and paid in standard currency. The store owner then calculates the time spent assisting the customer, consulting a clock for accuracy. In exchange, the customer gives a labor note, formatted something like this: \"Due to Josiah Warren, on demand, thirty minutes in carpentry work – John Smith,\" or, \"Due to Josiah Warren, on demand, ten minutes of sewing – Mary Brown.\" This approach meant the store owner traded his time for an equal amount of time from those purchasing his goods, with no conventional profits involved. This represented the principle of \"labor for labor,\" known as the \"Cost Principle\". Over time, the system adapted to account for differences in the value of various kinds of work.\nThe Cost system discouraged shoppers from wasting the vendor's time needlessly, while marking each item at cost eliminated haggling and fostered mutual respect and trust rather than sharp dealings and suspicion. Although Robert Owen suggested labor notes in 1820 as part of a plan to tackle the inequality facing industrial Ireland, Warren was the first to put the idea into effective practice. His store also served as a depot for items that could be sold. Each morning, he posted a list of items in demand, showing which products the store would accept. Once accepted, the depositor could either take equivalent goods from the store or receive Warren's labor notes in exchange. Since these notes were measured in hours rather than dollars, it became practical to display a list showing prices in labor hours, based on the average labor time for staple items. Additionally, customers could review the invoices for all purchased goods, so there was no basis for dispute over pricing. Accepting only in-demand items from depositors prevented overstocking and avoided the mistake that later contributed to the quick downfall of Robert Owen's London Labor Exchange. Warren kept the Equity Store simple, with only a brief notice:\nAlthough Warren's purpose was principled, he recognized that self-interest, rooted in the instinct for self-preservation, drives human behavior and did not waste time on reforms ignoring this natural motivation. He believed the first step in helping others was to show them he had no power to harm them and, in his words, was \"as ready to run away from power as most reformers are to pursue it.\" Initially, the Equity Store received little support. In the first week, business totaled just five dollars. Skeptics condemned it as a new scam, and friends advised him to abandon his utopian pursuits, offering to help him build a profitable business instead. For several days, no customers came. Eventually, he convinced his brother George to make some purchases for his family. A few other hesitant friends tried it and, finding it beneficial, spread the word. The financial advantages of fair trading quickly attracted attention, and before long, the store required all Warren's time and energy. A nearby merchant, finding his own business waning, saw that he needed to either adopt the Equity model or close. He approached Warren, explained his situation, and asked for guidance to transition his business to this new system to regain lost customers. Warren was happy to help his fellow merchant convert his shop into a \"Time Store\" based on Equity principles and delighted to witness how competition could drive fairer trading methods. The two Time Stores soon drew so much support that they impacted retail trade throughout the city.\nBetween 1827 and 1830, the store proved successful. Warren closed the store to pursue establishing colonies based on economic mutualism, including \"Utopia\" and \"Modern Times.\"\nModern times\nModern Times, which was located in what is now Brentwood, New York, lasted from approximately 1851 to 1864. It was Josiah Warren's last attempt to put his ideas of Equitable Commerce and sovereignty of the individual, which he had developed over a lifetime of study and experimentation, into action. In 1850, Warren came back to Boston from the Midwest and began searching for an area near a major city, with low land prices, to establish a utopian community.  The inexpensive land enabled Warren to be able to implement his plan to provide homes for families that had never owned one before. The Long Island Central Pine Barrens where Modern Times was located had an undeserved reputation as having poor soil so he was able to purchase 400 acres at $2.75 an acre with a very small down payment.  Modern Times was a town with neither government nor money nor laws and can accurately be described as anarchistic, yet there was no crime and very little commotion.  The citizens of Modern Times although eschewing the profit motive, were not socialistic in their attitude toward ownership of property or the means of production.  On 7 September 1864 the name of the village was changed to Brentwood.\"\nLater life and death\nWarren later returned to the Boston area. From 1864 to 1869, he resided in Cliftondale, Massachusetts, where he twice attempted to establish a mutual town. He then moved back to Boston, where he remained until his death.\nWarren died on April 14, 1874, in Charlestown at the home of a friend after developing edema. He is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge.\nPhilosophy\nWarren has been considered the \"American Proudhon\".\nWarren said that Stephen Pearl Andrews' The Science of Society, published in 1852, was the most lucid and complete exposition of Warren's own theories. Warren's theory of value places him within the tradition of free-market socialism.\nEthics of pricing\nIn 1827, Warren conceived the idea of labor notes, a scheme which was later practised in socialist Owenite labour exchanges in the mid-1830s.\nWarren termed the phrase \"cost the limit of price,\" with \"cost\" here referring not to monetary price paid but the labor one exerted to produce an item. He believed that goods and services should trade according to how much labor was exerted to produce them and bring them to market, instead of according to how individuals believed them to be subjectively worth.\nTherefore, he \"proposed a system to pay people with certificates indicating how many hours of work they did. They could exchange the notes at local time stores for goods that took the same amount of time to produce.\" To charge more labor for something that entailed less labor was \"cannibalism,\" according to him. Moreover, he believed that trading according to \"cost the limit of price\" would promote increasing efficiency in an economy, as he explains in Equitable Commerce:\nLegacy\nPrinting\n.]]Josiah Warren was the inventor of the first rotary press in the United States, an invention that was later improved by Robert Hoe. Warren began working on this idea in 1830, but he chose not to patent it, considering it too simple and thus \"was simply given to the public.\"\nHe anticipated a future where individuals would operate personal printers; his contributions are recognized by the American Printing History Association.\nThought\nCatalan historian Xavier Diez reports that the intentional communal experiments pioneered by Warren were influential in European individualist anarchists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries such as Émile Armand and the intentional communities started by them. In the United States Benjamin Tucker dedicated his collection of essays, Instead of a Book, to the memory of Warren, \"my friend and master ... whose teachings were my first source of light\". Tucker credits Warren with being \"the first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as Anarchism.\"\nJohn Stuart Mill, author of On Liberty'', said Warren's philosophy, \"though being a superficial resemblance to some of the project of the Socialists, is diametrically opposed to them in principle, since it recognizes no authority whatever in Society, over the individual, except to enforce equal freedom of development for all individuals.\" Warren's principle of the \"sovereignty of the individual\" was later taken up by Mill and Herbert Spencer.\nSee also\n* Individualist anarchism in the United States\n* Labor voucher\n* Libertarian socialism\n* Libertarianism in the United States\n* Local exchange trading system\n* Owenism\n* Philosophical anarchism\n* Precursors to anarchism\n* Robert Owen\n* Stephen Pearl Andrews\n* Time-based currency\n* Utopian socialism\nNotes\nReferences\n* Martin, James J.
