President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte Macron were welcomed by King Charles III and Queen Camilla on 8 July at Windsor Castle on the first day of a three-day visit.\nDuring the visit, the President met Prime Minister Keir Starmer and opposition party leaders, addressed the UK parliament and also attended the 37th UK-France Summit.\nBackground\nIn September 2023, King Charles III and Queen Camilla had paid a state visit to France, which was described as a diplomatic success in helping to rebuild relations after Brexit.\nMacron's visit to UK was seen as a further effort by the UK Labour government to reinforce links with a European ally, against a background of uncertainty about negotiations over Ukraine and the threat of tariffs from the United States, as well as joint efforts to stop illegal migrants from crossing the Channel in small boats. Starmer's office said the visit would showcase \"the breadth of the existing relationship\" between Britain and France, while Macron hailed an \"important moment for our two nations\" on X.\nProgramme\n8 July: Met King Charles III, addressed the parliament and state dinner\non 8 July]]\nOn 8 July, Macron and his wife Brigitte were greeted off the presidential plane at RAF Northolt by Prince William and Catherine, Princess of Wales.
