Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Algeria accepted the convention on 24 June 1974. There are seven World Heritage Sites in Algeria, with a further eleven on the tentative list.\nThe first site in Algeria added to the list was Al Qal'a of Beni Hammad, in 1980. The most recent site added was Kasbah of Algiers, which was listed in 1992. Of the seven sites on the list, six are listed for cultural significance while Tassili n'Ajjer is listed for both cultural and natural significance. From 2002 to 2006, Tipasa was listed as endangered because of inadequate management of the site, including vandalism, growing urbanisation in the buffer zone, and unsuitable restoration techniques. Algeria has served on the World Heritage Committee three times.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\"| Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\"| Location (province)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Al Qal'a of Beni Hammad\n|\n| M'Sila\n| 1980\n| 102; iii (cultural)\n| Qal'at Bani Hammad was founded by the Hammadid dynasty in 1007 in a mountain setting, initially as a military stronghold that became their capital. It was influential in the development of the Arab architecture, including in the Maghreb, Andalusia, and Sicily. It was abandoned in 1090 under the threat of the Banu Hilal invasion and later demolished in 1152. The main mosque (the remains of the minaret pictured) was one of the largest and oldest in Algeria.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Tassili n'Ajjer\n|\n|Tamanrasset\n| 1982\n| 179; i, iii, vii, viii (mixed)\n| The vast sandstone plateau has numerous rock formations, created by water and wind erosion. There are Precambrian rocks and sediment sequences that are of high geological interest. There are more than 15,000 rock paintings and carvings in the area, making it one of the richest prehistoric rock art sites in the world. The images cover the period from around 10,000 BCE to the first centuries of CE. They depict human figures and animals and illustrate the evolution of society and changes of the climate. Some of the depicted animals, such as the hippopotamus, were present in periods with more water, but have now been absent for millennia.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |M'Zab Valley\n|\n|Ghardaïa\n| 1982\n| 188; ii, iii, iv (cultural)\n| The five ksour (singular ksar) in the M'Zab Valley were founded between 1012 and 1350 by the Ibadites. Ksar is a type of a fortified village adapted to a harsh desert environment. Each of the five ksour has a mosque that can act as a fortress with a minaret that is also a watchtower, as well as an adjacent cemetery and palm grove. Up to the present day, people have maintained essentially the same building techniques as in the 11th century. In the 20th century, the ksour model influenced architects and urban planners, including Le Corbusier. Mzab Ghardaïa is pictured.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Djémila\n|\n| Sétif\n| 1982\n| 191; iii, iv (cultural)\n| The Roman town of Djémila was founded in the late 1st century under the Emperor Nerva. It was a defensive settlement, located at an elevation of . It expanded in the 3rd century and declined with the collapse of Rome in the 6th century. Today in ruins, there are remains of the forum, temples, basilicas, triumphal arches, and houses, as well as early Christian sites, including a large cathedral and baptistery. A collection of mosaics has been preserved, depicting mythological and everyday motifs.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Tipasa\n|\n| Tipaza\n| 1982\n| 193; iii, iv (cultural)\n| Tipasa was founded in the 6th century BCE as a Punic trading post and port of call. A vast necropolis remains from this period and testifies to the cultural exchanges of peoples in the region. It was conquered by the Romans in the 2nd century BCE. Buildings dating from the Roman period include the Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania (pictured). There are Christian buildings from the 3rd and 4th centuries. In the 430s, the city was taken by the Vandals, retaken by the Byzantines, and declined in the 6th century. From 2002 to 2006, the site was listed as endangered because of inadequate management of the site, including vandalism, growing urbanisation in the buffer zone, and unsuitable restoration techniques.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Timgad\n|\n| Batna\n| 1982\n| 194; ii, iii, iv (cultural)\n| Timgrad was founded as a Roman military colony by the Emperor Trajan in 100. It had a triumphal arch, temples, markets, and baths. It is a good illustration of Roman urban planning. The city fell into decline with the Vandal invasion in 430 and was finally abandoned in the 8th century, following the Arab invasion.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Kasbah of Algiers\n|\n| Algiers\n| 1992\n| 565; ii, iv (cultural)\n| The kasbah, or fortified citadel, is located on the Mediterranean coast. Built on the site of a Phoenician trading post from the 6th century BCE, it got its present layout in the 16th century under the Ottomans. It has old mosques, Ottoman-style palaces, souks, hammams, and traditional buildings that reflect the life in a Mediterranean Muslim city. At the time of inscription, it was home to around 50,000 people. An interior of a palace is pictured.\n|}\nTentative list\nIn addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. Algeria maintains eleven properties on its tentative list.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (province)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" | UNESCO criteria\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ighamaouen, the Collective Fortresses-Granaries of the Touat Gourara Tidikelt Cultural Park\n|\n| Timimoun\n| 2025\n| iii, iv (cultural)\n| Disctinct to the region of Touat, in southwestern Algeria, the Ighamaouen are granary fortresses.
