There are monthly meetings, field trips, archive and library collections, oral history projects, scholarships, and publications.\nHistory\nOn November 1, 1975, the CHSSC held its founding meeting at Cathay Bank in Los Angeles, California. Its key attendees included Paul Louie, William Mason, and Paul De Falla.\nIts mission is:\n* To bring together people with a mutual interest in the important history and historical role of Chinese and Chinese Americans in Southern California;\n* To pursue, preserve and communicate knowledge of this history; and\n* To promote the heritage of the Chinese and Chinese American community in support of a better appreciation of our rich, multi-cultural society.\nThe CHSSC purchased the site of their present building in Bernard Street in the mid 1990s, constructing a Chinatown Heritage & Visitors Center that is open to the public.\nProjects\nCHSSC has published several books. Duty & Honor was published in 1998, celebrating Chinese American World War II veterans, and Portraits of Pride I (2004) & II (2012), which are collections of the biographies of high achieving but little known Chinese Americans.\nIn 1992, the society purchased a shrine built in 1880 and 42 surrounding burial places in Evergreen Cemetery, which they restored.
