Since transferring to the Department of Homeland Security, the issuance of DOT awards has been discontinued in the Coast Guard, although such awards may still be seen on active duty Coast Guard uniforms.\nCoast Guard military awards are similar to U.S. Navy awards (often with nearly identical ribbons save for an additional white stripe) and Coast Guard personnel are eligible to receive all inter-service awards and decorations, authorized foreign awards and international decorations.\nThe current active awards and decorations of the U.S. Coast Guard are as follows:\nCoast Guard Medals\nPersonal Awards and Decorations\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" width=\"100%\"\n!
