He was raised in a Roman Catholic household and received his education at St. Augustine’s School in Banjul from 1982 to 1987. Singateh was born on 8 August 1968.

He later underwent military training in the United States and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in January 1992, serving as a platoon commander.\n1994 Gambian coup d'état\nSinghateh was one of the key leaders of the coup d'état on 22 July 1994, which overthrew President Dawda Jawara and established the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (AFPRC). Following the coup, he was appointed Minister of Defence in the AFPRC government. He was also a member of the military junta Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council, and hold the position of vice-chairman of the junta. In November 1994 Singateh was promoted to captain. Singhateh also played a crucial role in suppressing the attempted coup of November 1994.

His dismissal coincided with the removal of his brother, Lieutenant Colonel Peter Singhateh, from his position as Deputy Commander of the Defence Staff.

His removal marked a significant shift in the political landscape of The Gambia. His subsequent political career remained uncertain after his dismissal. After his political career ended, Singateh joined the judiciary in 2011.\nReferences"
