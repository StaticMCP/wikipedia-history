The success of Operation Colossus, a small scale commando raid, prompted further expansion of this force, and resulted in an additional requirement for a glider force of 10,000 men to be created. The recruitment for the size of this force took through to 1943, by which time two divisions had been formed. The airborne division was to comprise three brigades: two parachute brigades, each with three battalions from the Parachute Regiment, and an airlanding brigade with three infantry battalions. The first parachute battalions were formed from volunteers from across the British military. As the airborne force grew, infantry battalions were selected to be converted into parachute battalions. The men were invited to volunteer for parachute service, or assigned to a new unit. The new battalions were then brought up to strength from volunteers from other units. The airlanding battalions came from existing infantry units that had been converted into this new role, and the soldiers did not have the ability to opt-out. The latter were flown into battle via gliders, while the former parachuted in.\nAirlanding\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: left; border-spacing: 2px; border: 1px solid darkgray;\"\n|+\n|-\n! width=\"10%\" scope=\"col\"|Formation name\n!width=6% scope=\"col\"|Existing or date created\n!width=6% scope=\"col\"|Date ceased to exist\n!width=15% scope=\"col\"|Location(s) served\n!width=15% scope=\"col\"|Notable campaign(s)\n!class=unsortable width=7% scope=\"col\"|Division(s) mostly associated with\n!class=unsortable width=39% scope=\"col\"|Notes\n!class=unsortable width=1% scope=\"col\"|Source(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" |1st Airlanding Brigade\n|align=\"center\"|10 December 1941\n|align=\"center\"|N/A\n|align=\"center\"|UK, Tunisia, Italy, Netherlands, Norway\n|align=\"center\"|Tunisian, Italian, Arnhem\n|align=\"center\"|1st Airborne\n|align=\"center\"|The brigade was formed by the re-designation of the 31st Independent Brigade Group, and was initially known as the 1st Airlanding Brigade Group.
