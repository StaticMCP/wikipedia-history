It rises  west of Kewanee in southeastern Henry County and flows generally westwardly into Mercer County, where it joins the Mississippi  southeast of New Boston.  In Henry County it collects the South Edwards River, which flows past Bishop Hill.\nThe river was once home to a grain mill near Andover, Illinois. Several sections of the Edwards River's course have been straightened and channelized.\nSee also\n*List of Illinois rivers\nReferences"
