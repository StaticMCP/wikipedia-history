On 24 June 1941, three waves of German Luftwaffe bombers, 47 aircraft each, bombed Minsk. The Soviet anti-aircraft defense of the city was poorly organized, and panic ensued. Because the water supply was destroyed, fires could not be put down, and the city was evacuated.\nAs much as 85% of the city's buildings and the entire infrastructure was destroyed. More than 1,000 people were killed.\nSee also\n*German occupation of Byelorussia during World War II\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060511204652/http://www.belarus.net/minsk_ev/97/russia/n6/voyna20.htm Article in newspaper] - in Russian\n* [http://english.pobediteli.ru/index.html Video of the bombing, fire and ruins] (as part of multimedia presentation)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40JKDb-tO4U Minsk.
