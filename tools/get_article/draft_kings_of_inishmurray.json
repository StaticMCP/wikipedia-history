The island is uninhabited and the title is vacant, last claimed by Michael Waters, who died in January 1951.\nHistory\nNot much is known about the history of the use of title on the island, but it is believed to date back by 1,500 years. The earliest recorded \"King of Inishmurray\" was Martin Heraghty, who died sometime by 1924. Heraghty and his successor Michael Waters were both at different times convicted of distributing illicit liquors.\nThere is little documentation of earlier kings; a 1917 issue of The Literary Digest mentioned that \"The shores are inhabited by septs […] which preserve a clannish allegiance to one another, but the islands are ruled by kings. There is a King of Tory and a King of Innismurray\".\nMichael Waters became king sometime between 1911 and 1924, and held the title until his death in 1951. He had a son named after him, who was nicknamed \"Princie\" by the locals. Due to the rising prices of barley and poteen, on 12 November 1948, the inhabitants of the island evacuated the island for mainland County Sligo. The fate of his son and lineage of the Inishmurray Heraghty family is currently unknown.\nReferences"
