Built sometime before 1686, it is one of the city's oldest surviving buildings.  It is a -story timber-frame structure, with a large central chimney, and is four bays wide and one deep.  Its front entry has sidelight windows that were probably added in the 19th century, and the entry is enclosed in a Colonial Revival portico.  The house was for 275 years owned by the family of John Woodward, one of Newton's early settlers.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.\nSee also\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Newton, Massachusetts\nReferences"
