For the third year in succession, the award ceremony was held at the Hammersmith Palais, London.\nAs per previous years, only films intended for theatrical release, and those which had a public screening to a paying audience either on general release in the UK or at a British film festival between 1 October 2004 and 30 November 2005 were eligible for consideration. In addition, they needed either to have been produced / majority co-produced by a British company, or in receipt of at least 51% of their budget from a British source or qualified as a British Film under DCMS guidelines. Lastly, they could not be solely funded by a single studio.\nShortlists were announced on 25 October 2005. Mrs Henderson Presents and The Libertine led with eight nominations apiece. Winners in fourteen categories were selected from the shortlists and a further three were awarded entirely at the jury's discretion, whose make up included Michael Kuhn (chair), Mick Audsley, Alan Cumming, Amanda Donohoe, Mikael Hafstrom, Bryce Dallas Howard, Hugh Hudson, Tom Hunsinger, Beeban Kidron, Sue Latimer (Agent), Uberto Pasolini, Anne Reid and Ashley Walters.\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"50%\" |Best British Independent Film\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Director\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* The Constant Gardener – Fernando Meirelles\n** The Descent – Neil Marshall\n** The Libertine – Laurence Dunmore\n** Mrs Henderson Presents – Stephen Frears\n** A Cock and Bull Story – Michael Winterbottom\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Neil Marshall – The Descent'\n** Fernando Meirelles – The Constant Gardener\n** Laurence Dunmore – The Libertine\n** Stephen Frears – Mrs Henderson Presents\n** Michael Winterbottom – A Cock and Bull Story\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Actor\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Actress\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Ralph Fiennes – The Constant Gardener as Justin Quayle'\n** Matthew Macfadyen – ''In My Father's Den as Paul Prior\n** Chiwetel Ejiofor – Kinky Boots as Lola / Simon\n** Johnny Depp – The Libertine as John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester\n** Bob Hoskins – Mrs Henderson Presents as Vivian Van Damm\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Rachel Weisz – The Constant Gardener as Tessa Abbott-Quayle'\n** Natasha Richardson – Asylum as Stella Raphael\n** Judi Dench – Mrs Henderson Presents as Laura Henderson\n** Emily Watson – Wah-Wah as Ruby\n** Joan Allen – Yes as She\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Supporting Actor/Actress\n! width=\"50%\" |Most Promising Newcomer\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Rosamund Pike – The Libertine as Elizabeth Wilmot, Countess of Rochester'\n** Bill Nighy – The Constant Gardener as Sir Bernard Pellegrin\n** Tom Hollander – The Libertine as Sir George Etherege\n** Kelly Reilly – Mrs Henderson Presents as Maureen\n** Rob Brydon – A Cock and Bull Story as Captain Toby Shandy\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Emily Barclay – ''In My Father's Den as Celia'\n** Rupert Friend – The Libertine as Billy Downs\n** Samina Awan – Love + Hate as Naseema\n** Alex Etel – Millions as Damian Cunningham\n** Thelma Barlow – Mrs Henderson Presents as Lady Margot Conway\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Screenplay\n! width=\"50%\" |Best International Independent Film\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Frank Cottrell Boyce – Millions'\n** Jeffrey Caine – The Constant Gardener\n** Tim Firth and Geoff Deane – Kinky Boots\n** Martin Sherman – Mrs Henderson Presents\n** Martin Hardy – A Cock and Bull Story\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Downfall – Oliver Hirschbiegel'\n** Broken Flowers – Jim Jarmusch\n** Crash – Paul Haggis\n** Secuestro Express – Jonathan Jakubowicz\n** The Woodsman – Nicole Kassell\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Technical Achievement\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Achievement in Production\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Jon Harris – The Descent (Editing)'\n** César Charlone – The Constant Gardener (DOP / Cinematography)\n** Ben Van Os – The Libertine (Production design)\n** Sandy Powell – Mrs Henderson Presents (Wardrobe)\n** Peter Christelis – A Cock and Bull Story (Editing)\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Gypo – Jan Dunn\n** The Business – Allan Niblo and James Richardson\n** Guy X – Mike Downey\n** ''It's All Gone Pete Tong – Elizabeth Yake, Allan Niblo and James Richardson\n** Song of Songs – Gayle Griffiths\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" |Douglas Hickox Award (Best Debut Director)\n! width=\"50%\" |Best British Short Film\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Annie Griffin – Festival'\n** Julian Jarrold – Kinky Boots\n** Laurence Dunmore – The Libertine\n** Gaby Dellal – On a Clear Day\n** Richard E.
