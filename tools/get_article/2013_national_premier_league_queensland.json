The league consists of 14 teams across the State of Queensland. Brisbane City, Olympic FC and Redlands United joined from the Brisbane Premier League. Brisbane Strikers, QAS and Sunshine Coast Fire joined from the previous Queensland State League. Central Queensland FC, FNQ FC Heat and Northern Fury each had sides from their cities participating in the previous Queensland State League but new consortiums won bids to participate in the NPL and new identities were created, Fury taking on the identity of the former A-League club North Queensland Fury.\nComplete new entities, Western Pride FC and Moreton Bay Jets were formed while Palm Beach Sharks was drawn from the Gold Coast Premier League but were former participants in years gone past in the Brisbane Premier League.\nTeams\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Their first loss was at the hands of Brisbane City who won their round 12 clash, 3-1. This was after Olympic defeated Brisbane City 6-2 in the inaugural NPL Queensland match.\nThe Round 3 match between Western Pride and Sunshine Coast Fire was called off at approximately the 80 minute mark due to a severe thunderstorm. Fire were leading 4-0 at the time and under the competition rules, were awarded the win.\nThe Round 10 match between Moreton Bay Jets and Western Pride was abandoned at the 80 minute mark due to an electrical floodlight failure. The Jets were leading 1-0 at the time and were awarded the victory under the competition rules.\nOlympic FC claimed the Premiers title in Round 20 with a 3-1 victory over the Moreton Bay Jets at Goodwin Park on 4 August 2013.\nOlympic FC, Brisbane City, Sunshine Coast Fire and the Brisbane Strikers formed the top four teams and therefore qualified for the finals series.\nManagers\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|-\n!
