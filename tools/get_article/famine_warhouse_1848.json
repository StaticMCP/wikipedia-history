Rebels led by William Smith O'Brien besieged 47 policemen of the Irish Constabulary. After the loss of two men the rebels retreated, and were later arrested and transported.\nKnown locally as the Warhouse, it became a National Monument in 1989, was renovated in 2000–01 and was renamed \"Famine Warhouse 1848\" in 2004. Today it houses a museum with exhibits on the Great Famine and mass emigration, the rebellion, the high treason trials and exile of the Young Ireland leaders in Australia and their escapes to the US.\nReferences"
