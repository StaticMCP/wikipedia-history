The ceremony will be broadcast live on ABC and will be available to stream the next day on Hulu. CMA award winner and six-time nominee this year, Lainey Wilson, hosted the ceremony.\nBackground\nOn September 30, CMA announced that Wilson will return as host for the ceremony, but for the first time as a solo host. It is only the third time that the CMA Awards have had a solo female host, following Dolly Parton in 1988, and Reba McEntire in 1991.\nOn November 10, the association announced that eighteen-time CMA award winner and country legend, Vince Gill, would receive the Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award. A statement by the CMA chief executive officer Sarah Trahern read “Vince embodies the very best of what country music stands for,” Sarah Trahern, CMA chief executive officer, said in a statement. “He's a true trailblazer, one who gives back to the community, honors the roots of our genre, and even now continues to share his talent with fans across the globe. As a Country Music Hall of Fame member, 18-time CMA Award winner, and former 12-time CMA Awards host, he remains a vibrant force in our industry, and we’re honored to celebrate an artist whose influence is so deeply woven into the fabric of our format.”\nWinners and nominees\nNominations were announced on Monday, September 8, 2025 at 12:00 PM/CT via livestream on CMA's official Facebook and YouTube channel.

The reception of the ceremony was generally favorable. Lainey Wilson was praised for her solo hosting debut, along with her opening medley of country hits. Many outlets also highlighted her pointed remarks, after winning Female Vocalist of the Year, on the online discourse surrounding women in country music, saying, \"...And for the folks that are sitting at home in your mama’s basement eating your Cheetos, trying to pit women against each other: Y’all need to find something better to do\".\nSeveral performances drew acclaim, including Ella Langley’s “Choosin’ Texas”, Shaboozey and Stephen Wilson, Jr.’s collaboration “Took a Walk”, as well as Brandi Carlile’s tribute to Vince Gill alongside Patty Loveless. Some publications also noted the surprise victories by The Red Clay Strays and Cody Johnson. The Seattle Times pointed out Zach Top’s standout win for New Artist of the Year as a neotraditional country performer, noting the humorous moment in which he accepted the award while holding a can of Coors Banquet.\nMilestones and achievements\n* Brooks & Dunn became the most awarded act in CMA history with 20 wins overall, including their sixteenth win for Vocal Duo of the Year in this ceremony.\n* Lainey Wilson became the third woman to win Female Vocalist of the Year four years in a row (previously accomplished by Miranda Lambert and Reba McEntire).\n* Miranda Lambert and Reba McEntire are tied with the most Female Vocalist of the Year nominations all-time with 18.\n* This is only the third ceremony to have multiple women leading the nominations. It happened previously in 2013 (Kacey Musgraves and Taylor Swift) and 1986 (The Judds and Reba McEntire).\n* Lainey Wilson became the fourth host to win Entertainer for the Year the same year when they hosted the ceremony, (Barbara Mandrell in 1980 and 1981; Vince Gill in 1993 and 1994; Brad Paisley in 2010).\n* Ella Langley and Riley Green's \"You Look Like You Love Me\", is the only song in CMA history to win every award an individual song is eligible for with: Musical Event of the Year in 2024; Song of the Year, Single of the Year, and Music Video of the Year in 2025. (\"Whiskey Lullaby\" being the closest to the milestone, until this achievement, with three of the four nominations won).\nReferences"
