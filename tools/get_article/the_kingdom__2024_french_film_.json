The film stars Ghjuvanna Benedetti as the daughter of the leader of a crime family played by Saveriu Santucci.\nPremise\nIn 1995, Lesia (Benedetti) is a 15-year-old girl in Corsica, safe from the organized crime elsewhere on the island. This changes when she is taken to her father, crime boss Pierre-Paul (Santucci), much to her chagrin. The two repair their relationship as they escape mobsters all across the island, and Lesia is drawn further into her father's world of crime.\nCast\n* Ghjuvanna Benedetti as Lesia\n* Saveriu Santucci as Pierre-Paul\n* Anthony Morganti\n* Andrea Cossu\n* Fédéric Poggi\n* Régis Gomez\nProduction\nThe birth of his daughter inspired Colonna to create a father-daughter story. The Kingdom was shot on location in Corsica with a cast composed largely of first-time local actors. On the final day of filming, a pivotal boat scene had to be reworked due to a storm over the Gulf of Ajaccio.\nRelease\nThe Kingdom premiered in the Un Certain Regard portion of the 2024 Cannes Film Festival, where it was acquired by Metrograph Pictures for North American distribution rights. Ad Vitam Distribution theatrically released the film in France on 13 November 2024.\nReception\nCritical response\nPeter Bradshaw from The Guardian rated the movie with four stars over five, and described it as \"an intensely exciting and absorbing mob drama\".\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Ceremony date\n! scope=\"col\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" | Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n! scope=\"col\" | Ref.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | Cannes Film Festival\n| 24 May 2024\n| Un Certain Regard\n| rowspan=\"3\" | The Kingdom\n|\n| align=\"center\" |\n|-\n| 25 May 2024\n| ''Camera d'Or''\n|\n| align=\"center\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Louis Delluc Prize\n| 4 December 2024\n| Best First Film\n|\n| align=\"center\" |\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
