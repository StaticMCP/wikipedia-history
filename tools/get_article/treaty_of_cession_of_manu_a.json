It came about because of the Second Samoan Civil War and the Tripartite Convention of 1899 between the United States, the United Kingdom, and the German Empire. It was ratified by the United States Congress by the Ratification Act of 1929.\nSee also\n* Treaty of Cession of Tutuila\n* Tripartite Convention\n* History of American Samoa\n\n---\n\n## Treaty of Cession of Manuʻa\n\n#REDIRECT Treaty of Cession of Manu'a"
