As of September 2010, these committees are present in three municipalities. They are tasked with marking mass graves from World War II, maintaining the graves and exhuming them if possible.\nLocal municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina have thus far had to deal with graves from the Second World War on their own. Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of the few countries in the region not to have an agreement in place with Germany over the burial of German troops.\nCommittees\n*Busovača, Central Bosnia Canton\n*Ljubuški, West Herzegovina County\n*Neum, Herzegovina-Neretva County\n*Široki Brijeg, West Herzegovina County\nSee also\n*Commission on Concealed Mass Graves in Serbia\n*Commission on Concealed Mass Graves in Slovenia\nReferences"
