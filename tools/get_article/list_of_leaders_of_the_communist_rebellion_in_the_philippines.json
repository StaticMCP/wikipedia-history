This list is a compilation of some of the relevant leaders among the participants in the war. To be listed here, an individual must satisfy one of the following criteria:\n* to maintain peace and order\n* Most of them are leaders or high-ranking military officials, especially the President.\n* the operations in the conflict must be conducted militarily.\nIn 1972, Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law in response to rising social unrest and the rising insurgency by the Communist Party of the Philippines and its armed wing, the New People's Army. Throughout the conflict, foreign countries such as the socialist states China and Vietnam, aided the insurgency while the United States supported the Philippine government and Marcos Regime.\nGovernment\nCommander-in-Chief\n* Ferdinand Marcos (1965-1986) was the first President to face the insurgency, whose militarized dictatorship led to significant popular support for and rapid growth of the NPA.\n* Corazon Aquino (1986-1992) was the Philippines' first female President, assuming power after the Marcos Administration was deposed in the 1986 EDSA Revolution.\n* Fidel Ramos (1992-1998) was previously the Vice Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines under the Marcos Administration and Chief of Staff under Corazon Aquino's administration before being elected president in 1992.\n* Joseph Estrada (1998-2001) is a Filipino actor who became the second President to be deposed from office, following public outrage against government corruption that culminated in the 2001 EDSA Revolution.\n* Gloria Macapagal Arroyo (2001-2010) was Estrada's vice president and the daughter of former President Diosdado Macapagal, becoming the Philippines' second female President following Estrada's ouster.\n* Benigno Aquino III (2010-2016) is the son of former President Corazon Aquino.
