The music was composed by  and , and the words were written by  and .\nInitially, the anthem consisted of three verses and a chorus; however, by the resolution of the Supreme Council of the Kyrgyz Republic N 2648-V of 27 December 2012, the second verse was excluded.\nHistory\nWritten by Jalil Sadykov and Shabdanbek Kuluyev and composed by Nasyr Davlesov and Kalyi Moldobasanov, the anthem was adopted on 18 December 1992 by a resolution of the Supreme Council.\nIn the 2000s, several public figures began initiatives to change the lyrics of the anthem. They considered the meaning of the word in the second stanza,  (), to be contradictory, with the negative prefix  giving the word  () the opposite meaning. Thus, the following verse was omitted:\n{|\n! !! !!\n|- style=\"text-align:center;vertical-align:top;\"\n|}}\n|style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|For ages my people open to amity,\nThey are ready to give their hearts to their friends.\nThis has welcomed full unity and harmony\nOver Kyrgyz land abounding in peace.\n|}\nIn 2011, the Supreme Council set up a commission to change the lyrics of the national anthem and the flag, which had also been under dispute over the use of red and the flaming sun. The flag would not be changed, but after considering many proposals for changes to the lyrics or a new second verse, the commission, headed by Abdyrakhman Mamataliev, concluded to remove the verse entirely, stating there were generally contradictions in it. The Jogorku Kengesh voted in favour of the commission's proposal on 27 December 2012 with resolution N 2648-V.\nIn 2025, the government launched a public contest to replace the anthem, saying that it fails to accurately represent the depict the country's ancient and nomadic past.\nLyrics\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
