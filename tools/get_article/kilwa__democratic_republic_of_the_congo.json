The population of 6,000 mainly live from fishing.\nThe Cathédrale Saint André is located in Kilwa, which is a seat of the Diocese of Kilwa–Kasenga.\nThe Dikulushi Mine near Kilwa was operated by Anvil Mining, an Australian company.\nIn October 2004 there was a small-scale uprising in Kilwa which was brutally suppressed by FARDC soldiers of the 62nd Brigade.\nAnvil Mining Congo was accused of providing logistical support to the troops.\nThe company published a statement by the Traditional Chiefs of Moero Sector that firmly denied any involvement by Anvil in the massacre and that praised the company for the benefits it had brought to the region.\nReferences\n}}"
