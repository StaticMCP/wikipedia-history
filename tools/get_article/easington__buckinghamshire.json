The hamlet is between the villages of Chilton and Long Crendon and consists of around 30 houses.\nThe toponym is derived from Old English and evolved through Hesintone, Essintone and Easyngdon before reaching its present form.\nManor\nBefore the Norman conquest of England Alric, son of Goding, a thegn of Edward the Confessor, held the manors of Chilton and Easington. However, the Domesday Book records that by 1086 the Norman baron Walter Giffard held the two manors. The Domesday Book assessed the manor of Easington at five hides.\nFrom 1387 to 1523 the manor was part of the honour of Gloucester. In 1525 Easington reverted to the Crown, which granted the manor to John Croke of Chilton Manor, in whose family it seems to have stayed until at least 1657.\nThe will of John Hart, proved in 1665, left a rental income of £3 per annum from the manor of Easington to fund the apprenticeship of one poor boy. In the 1920s the bequest was still being applied \"as occasion arises\".\nReferences\nSources\n*"
