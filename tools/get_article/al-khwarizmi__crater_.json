It lies to the southeast of the crater Moiseev, and northeast of Saenger.\nThe western inner wall of Al-Khwarizmi is much wider than along the eastern side. The eastern rim overlays a pair of craters, including Al-Khwarizmi J. The outer wall is somewhat distorted from a circular shape, including a double-rim in the south. There is a small central peak at the midpoint, which forms part of a low ridge that bends to the northeast. Several tiny craterlets lie in the northern part of the interior floor. The floor to the southeast is somewhat smoother and free of significant impacts.\nAl-Khwarizmi is a crater of Nectarian age.\nThe crater was named for the Persian mathematician and astronomer Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi.  The crater had previously been informally referred to as Arabia, such as during the Apollo 17 mission.\nSatellite craters\nBy convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Al-Khwarizmi.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Al-Khwarizmi\n!width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Latitude\n!width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Longitude\n!width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Diameter\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|B\n|align=\"center\"|9.0° N\n|align=\"center\"|107.4° E\n|align=\"center\"|62&nbsp;km\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|G\n|align=\"center\"|6.9° N\n|align=\"center\"|107.1° E\n|align=\"center\"|95&nbsp;km\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|H\n|align=\"center\"|6.0° N\n|align=\"center\"|109.2° E\n|align=\"center\"|50&nbsp;km\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|J\n|align=\"center\"|6.2° N\n|align=\"center\"|107.6° E\n|align=\"center\"|47&nbsp;km\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|K\n|align=\"center\"|4.6° N\n|align=\"center\"|107.6° E\n|align=\"center\"|26&nbsp;km\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|L\n|align=\"center\"|3.9° N\n|align=\"center\"|107.4° E\n|align=\"center\"|35&nbsp;km\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|M\n|align=\"center\"|3.1° N\n|align=\"center\"|107.0° E\n|align=\"center\"|18&nbsp;km\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|T\n|align=\"center\"|7.0° N\n|align=\"center\"|104.5° E\n|align=\"center\"|15&nbsp;km\n|}\nFile:AS11-42-6282 Al-Khwarizmi K crater.jpg|Al-Khwarizmi K crater from Apollo 11\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20200412155519/https://the-moon.wikispaces.com/al%2BKhwarizmi Al-Khwarizmi at The Moon Wiki]"
