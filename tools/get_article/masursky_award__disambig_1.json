The award for Meritorious Service to Planetary Science was established by the DPS to recognize and honor individuals who have rendered outstanding service to planetary science and exploration through engineering, managerial, programmatic, or public service activities.  For purposes of this award, planetary science and exploration refers to the multidisciplinary study of the Solar System and its members, excluding work dealing primarily with the Sun or the Earth. It was named in honor of Harold Masursky. The award has been given annually since 1991, except 2001, 2002, and 2009.\nRecipients\nSource: [http://dps.aas.org/prizes/masursky American Astronomical Society]\n* 2005 J.
