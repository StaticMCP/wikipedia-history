She is best known for her short film loops, with which she first garnered international attention at the Venice Bienniale in 1995. Shortly thereafter, her work Douche (Shower, 1995) was displayed for an extended period of time on one of the platforms of Schiphol Airport railway station, where thousands of travellers could see the film while waiting for their train.\nVan Warmerdam relies not on story-telling but on the visual power of the motif: a hat dancing in the wind, a drop of milk slowly dissolving in a glass of water, a girl doing a handstand or a red suitcase sliding down a snowy mountain. Through endless repetition, these seemingly trivial events take on a sculptural quality and an almost dreamlike beauty.\nIn their simplicity, van Warmerdam’s sculptures, photo works and paintings are closely related to her film loops. Her view of the world is lighthearted, humorous and unexpected.\nVan Warmerdam is a regular advisor at the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam and Professor of Art at the State Academy of Fine Arts in Karlsruhe, Germany.\nExhibitions (selection)\nIn 1995, together with Marlene Dumas and Maria Roosen, she represented the Netherlands at the Venice Biennale. In addition, van Warmerdam has participated in numerous international exhibitions, including the Sydney, Berlin and Gwangju Biennales, and Documenta X. She has had solo exhibitions at the Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, the ICA in Boston, MAC in Marseille and The State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. A retrospective of her work has been shown at Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam, the Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art in Porto and Kunsthalle Düsseldorf.\nWorks in public collections\nVan Warmerdam’s work is represented in various international public collections:\nStedelijk Museum Amsterdam\nTextielMuseum, Tilburg\nVan Abbemuseum, Eindhoven\nMuseum De Domijnen, Sittard, The Netherlands\nHuis Marseille, Amsterdam\nMuseum Boijmans van Beuningen, Rotterdam\nMUDAM / Museé d'Art Moderne Grand-Duc Jean, Luxembourg\nPinault Collection, Paris\nFRAC, Languedoc-Roussillon, Montpellier\nFRAC Bretagne, Châteaugiron\nCentre George Pompidou, Paris\nMAC, Marseille\nStaatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden\nSüdwest LB forum, Stuttgart\nStädtische Galerie, Karlsruhe\nMUHKA, Antwerp\nBOZAR, Brussels\nSMAK, Ghent\nMuseum Horsens, Horsens, Denmark\nNew National Museum, Oslo\nCastello di Rivoli, Turin\n21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa, Japan\nMuseu Serralves, Porto\nAwards\n1988: Uriôt Prize\n1992: Prix de Rome (Art & Public Space)\n2004: David Roëll Award\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*[http://www.marijkevanwarmerdam.com Official website Marijke van Warmerdam]\n* Grant, Catherine M.
