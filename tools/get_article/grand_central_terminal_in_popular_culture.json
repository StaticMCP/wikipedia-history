The MTA hosts about 25 large-scale and hundreds of smaller or amateur productions every year. Kyle McCarthy, who handles production at Grand Central, said, \"Grand Central is one of the quintessential New York places. Whether filmmakers need an establishing shot of arriving in New York or transportation scenes, the restored landmark building is visually appealing and authentic.\" Especially during World War II, Grand Central has been a backdrop for romantic reunions between couples. After the terminal declined in the 1950s, it was more frequently used as a dark, dangerous place, even a metaphor for chaos and disorientation, featuring chase scenes, shootouts, homeless people, and the mentally ill. In the 1990 film The Freshman, for example, Matthew Broderick's character stumbles over an unconscious man and watches fearfully as petty crimes take place around him.\nAlmost every scene filmed in the terminal's train shed was shot on Track 34, one of the few areas without view-blocking structural columns.\nThe first filmed scene in which Grand Central Terminal appears may be the 1909 short comedy Mr. Jones Has a Card Party, while still under construction. The terminal's first cinematic appearance was in the 1930 musical film ''Puttin' On the Ritz, and its first Technicolor appearance was in the 1953 film The Band Wagon. Some films from the 20th century, including Grand Central Murder, The Thin Man Goes Home, Hello, Dolly!, and Beneath the Planet of the Apes used reconstructions of Grand Central, built in Hollywood, to stand in for the terminal. The Bollywood film Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna uses other American train stations standing in for Grand Central. Additionally, the terminal was drawn and animated for use in the animated films Madagascar (2005) and Wreck-It Ralph (2012).\nOther films in which the terminal appears include:\n* The Breakdown (1912)\n* Going Hollywood (1933)\n* Hold Your Man (1933)\n* Twentieth Century (1934)\n* Spellbound (1945)\n* The Clock (1945)\n* Ma and Pa Kettle Go to Town (1950)\n* North by Northwest (1959)\n* Seconds (1966)\n* The Out-of-Towners (1970)\n* The French Connection (1971)\n* Necrology (1971)\n* Superman (1978)\n* A Stranger Is Watching (1982)\n* Koyaanisqatsi (1982)\n* Escape from the Bronx (1983)\n* Falling in Love (1984)\n* The Cotton Club (1984)\n* Chronos (1985)\n* Midnight Run (1988)\n* The House on Carroll Street (1988)\n* Großer Bahnhof (1990)\n* Loose Cannons (1990)\n* The Fisher King (1991)\n* The Prince of Tides (1991)\n* Baraka (1992)\n* Carlito's Way (1993)\n* Hackers (1995)\n* One Fine Day (1996)\n* The Ice Storm (1997)\n* Armageddon (1998)\n* Godzilla (1998)\n* U.S. Marshals (1998)\n* Men in Black II (2002)\n* Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003)\n* Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)\n* Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006)\n* I Am Legend (2007)\n* Revolutionary Road (2008)\n* Arthur (2011)\n* Friends with Benefits (2011)\n* The Avengers (2012)\n* Before We Go (2015)\n* The Girl on the Train (2016)\n* 2:22 (2017)\n* The Commuter (2018)\n* John Wick: Chapter 3 (2019)\nNotable documentaries about the terminal include Grand Central'', a 1982 film narrated by James Earl Jones and featuring Philip Johnson and Ed Koch.\nexhibition, 2018]]\nOn October 19, 2017, several of these films were screened in the terminal for an event created by the MTA, Rooftop Films, and the Museum of the Moving Image.
