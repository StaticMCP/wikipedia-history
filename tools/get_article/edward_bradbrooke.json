He resided at Wayside in Sutton Courtney at the time and by trade was a leather manufacturer.\nBradbrooke became the national high jump champion again by virtue of being the highest placed British athlete, when finishing second behind Mihály Bodosi at the 1933 AAA Championships.

He served the village of Slaugham, known for its 13th-century church, as well as the villages of Handcross, Pease Pottage, and Warninglid, and also became Rural Dean of Cuckfeld in 1958. In 1962, he made international headlines with the quote, \"Beer is one of God's gifts\", ahead of blessing beer in addition to flowers, fruits, and vegetables during the harvest festival in Slaugham.\nIn 1966, Bradbrooke and his wife Anne moved to Graffham near Petworth, where he was appointed rector.\nPersonal life and death\nIn 1974, Bradbrooke moved from Sussex to the village of Martock near Yeovil to retire, but remained active as an assistant priest in the area.\nBradbrooke was a self-taught painter of watercolour landscapes.
