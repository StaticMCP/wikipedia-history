VISA is an industry standard implemented by several T&M companies, such as, Anritsu, Bustec, Keysight Technologies, Kikusui, National Instruments, Rigol, Rohde & Schwarz, and Tektronix.\nThe VISA standard includes specifications for communication with resources (usually, but not always, instruments) over T&M-specific I/O interfaces such as GPIB and VXI.  There are also some specifications for T&M-specific protocols over PC-standard I/O, such as HiSLIP or VXI-11 (over TCP/IP) and USBTMC (over USB).\nThe VISA library has standardized the presentation of its operations over several software reuse mechanisms, including through a C API exposed from Windows DLL, visa32.dll, over the Microsoft COM technology, and through a .NET API. Although there are several VISA vendors and implementations, applications written against VISA are (nominally) vendor-interchangeable thanks to the standardization of VISA's presentation and operations/capabilities. Implementations from specific vendors  are also available for less common programming languages  and software reuse technologies.\nHistory\nVISA was originally standardized through the VXIplug&play Alliance, a now-defunct T&M standards body. The current standard, \"VISA Specification 5.0\", is maintained by the [http://www.ivifoundation.org IVI Foundation].\nSee also\n* Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments (SCPI)\n* High Speed LAN Instrument Protocol (HiSLIP)\n* Instrument driver\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.rohde-schwarz.de/appnote/1MA208 Fast Remote Instrument Control with HiSLIP - Application Note]\n* [http://www.ivifoundation.org/specifications/ IVI Foundation Specifications]"
