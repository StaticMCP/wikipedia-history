The Kings had the fourteenth overall pick in the 1996 NBA draft, and selected Serbian small forward Peja Stojaković; however, Stojaković had a five-year contract with his team, PAOK BC in the Greek Basketball League, and did not play for the Kings until the 1998–99 season. During the off-season, the team acquired Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf from the Denver Nuggets, and later on signed free agent Jeff Grayer in January.\nComing off of their first NBA playoff appearance in ten years, the Kings struggled with an 8–17 start to the regular season, as Brian Grant only played just 24 games due to a shoulder injury, and Billy Owens missed 16 games early into the season with a groin injury. The Kings would rebound to get back into playoff contention, holding a 21–28 record at the All-Star break. However, after holding a 28–32 record as of March 5, 1997, the team went on a 7-game losing streak as head coach Garry St. Jean was fired, and replaced with assistant Eddie Jordan for the remainder of the season. The Kings finished in sixth place in the Pacific Division with a 34–48 record, missing the NBA playoffs by finishing just two games behind the 8th-seeded Los Angeles Clippers.\nMitch Richmond averaged 25.9 points and 1.5 steals per game, led the Kings with 204 three-point field goals, and was named to the All-NBA Second Team. In addition, Abdul-Rauf finished second on the team in scoring with 13.7 points per game, while Olden Polynice provided the team with 12.5 points and 9.4 rebounds per game, second-year forward Corliss Williamson showed improvement averaging 11.6 points per game, Owens provided with 11.0 points and 5.9 rebounds per game, and Grant contributed 10.5 points and 5.9 rebounds per game. Meanwhile, Michael Smith was the team's starting power forward in Grant's absence, averaging 6.6 points and 9.5 rebounds per game, and second-year guard Tyus Edney contributed 6.9 points and 3.2 assists per game off the bench.\nDuring the NBA All-Star weekend at the Gund Arena in Cleveland, Ohio, Richmond was selected for the 1997 NBA All-Star Game, as a member of the Western Conference All-Star team; he also finished tied in thirteenth place in Most Valuable Player voting.\nFollowing the season, Grant signed as a free agent with the Portland Trail Blazers, while Edney signed with the Boston Celtics, Duane Causwell was traded to the Miami Heat, Grayer was released to free agency, and Lionel Simmons retired due to knee surgery, after playing seven seasons in the NBA with the Kings.\nDraft picks\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\"\n! style=\"background:#000000; color:#553592\" width=\"10%\"| Round\n! style=\"background:#000000; color:#553592\" width=\"10%\"| Pick\n! style=\"background:#000000; color:#553592\" width=\"20%\"| Player\n! style=\"background:#000000; color:#553592\" width=\"15%\"| Position\n! style=\"background:#000000; color:#553592\" width=\"15%\"| Nationality\n! style=\"background:#000000; color:#553592\" width=\"20%\"| College\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| 1 || 14 || Peja Stojaković || SF ||  ||\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| 2 || 41 || Jason Sasser || SF ||  || Texas Tech\n|}\nRoster\nRegular season\nSeason standings\n:z - clinched division title\n:y - clinched division title\n:x - clinched playoff spot\nGame log\nPlayer statistics\nRegular season\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#010101; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#753BBD 3px solid; border-bottom:#753BBD 3px solid;\"|Player\n! style=\"background:#010101; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#753BBD 3px solid; border-bottom:#753BBD 3px solid;\"|GP\n! style=\"background:#010101; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#753BBD 3px solid; border-bottom:#753BBD 3px solid;\"|GS\n! style=\"background:#010101; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#753BBD 3px solid; border-bottom:#753BBD 3px solid;\"|MPG\n! style=\"background:#010101; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#753BBD 3px solid; border-bottom:#753BBD 3px solid;\"|FG%\n! style=\"background:#010101; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#753BBD 3px solid; border-bottom:#753BBD 3px solid;\"|3P%\n! style=\"background:#010101; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#753BBD 3px solid; border-bottom:#753BBD 3px solid;\"|FT%\n! style=\"background:#010101; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#753BBD 3px solid; border-bottom:#753BBD 3px solid;\"|RPG\n! style=\"background:#010101; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#753BBD 3px solid; border-bottom:#753BBD 3px solid;\"|APG\n! style=\"background:#010101; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#753BBD 3px solid; border-bottom:#753BBD 3px solid;\"|SPG\n! style=\"background:#010101; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#753BBD 3px solid; border-bottom:#753BBD 3px solid;\"|BPG\n! style=\"background:#010101; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#753BBD 3px solid; border-bottom:#753BBD 3px solid;\"|PPG\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 82 || 82 || 35.3 || .457 || .000 || .562 || 9.4 || 2.2 || .6 || 1.0 || 12.5\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 81 || 81 || 38.6 || .454 || .428 || .861 || 3.9 || 4.2 || 1.5 || .3 || 25.9\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 81 || 52 || 31.2 || .539 ||  || .496 || 9.5 || 2.4 || 1.0 || .7 || 6.6\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 79 || 31 || 25.2 || .498 || .000 || .689 || 4.1 || 1.6 || .8 || .6 || 11.6\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 75 || 51 || 28.4 || .445 || .382 || .846 || 1.6 || 2.5 || .7 || .1 || 13.7\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 70 || 20 || 19.7 || .384 || .190 || .823 || 1.6 || 3.2 || .9 || .0 || 6.9\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 66 || 56 || 30.2 || .467 || .347 || .697 || 5.9 || 2.8 || .9 || .4 || 11.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 62 || 2 || 15.4 || .430 || .482 || .700 || 1.7 || 1.2 || .3 || .3 || 5.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 49 || 12 || 12.9 || .368 || .311 || .698 || .8 || 3.0 || .6 || .1 || 2.9\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 46 || 8 || 12.6 || .511 || .667 || .541 || 2.8 || .4 || .3 || .8 || 2.6\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 41 || 0 || 12.7 || .331 || .233 || .875 || 2.5 || 1.4 || .2 || .3 || 3.4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 25 || 0 || 12.6 || .458 || .364 || .550 || 1.5 || 1.0 || .3 || .3 || 3.6\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 24 || 15 || 25.3 || .440 ||  || .778 || 5.9 || 1.2 || .8 || 1.0 || 10.5\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 23 || 0 || 6.7 || .364 ||  || .722 || 1.1 || .4 || .1 || .6 || 1.6\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|†\n| 5 || 0 || 5.6 || .125 || .182 ||  || .8 || .2 || .2 || .0 || 1.2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|†\n| 3 || 0 || 8.3 || .273 ||  || .500 || 3.0 || .7 || 1.0 || .0 || 2.7\n|}\nPlayer Statistics Citation:\nAwards and records\n* Mitch Richmond, All-NBA Second Team\nTransactions\nReferences\nSee also\n* 1996-97 NBA season"
