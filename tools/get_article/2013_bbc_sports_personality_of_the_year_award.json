It was the 60th presentation of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award. Awarded annually by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), the main titular award honours an individual's British sporting achievement over the past year, with the winner selected by public vote from a ten-person shortlist.\nThe event was presented by Gary Lineker, Clare Balding and Gabby Logan with musical performances from John Newman and Russell Watson. Sue Barker decided to step down as a presenter after 19 years.\nThe winner of the main award was tennis player Andy Murray.\nFormer Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson won the special BBC Sports Personality Diamond Award.\nBasis of nominations\nPrior to 2012, a panel of thirty sports journalists each submit a list of ten contenders. From these contenders a shortlist of ten nominees is determined—currently, in the event of a tie at the end of the nomination process, a panel of six former award winners determined the nominee by a Borda count. The shortlist was announced at the beginning of December, and the winner was determined on the night of the ceremony by a public telephone vote.\nIn 2011 the shortlist produced only contained male competitors, which caused media uproar.  The selection process for contenders was changed for the 2012 (and future) awards as follows:\nThe BBC introduced an expert panel who were asked to devise a shortlist that reflected UK sporting achievements on the national and/or international stage, represented the breadth and depth of UK sports and took into account \"impact\" within and beyond the sport or sporting achievement in question.\nNominees\nThe nominees for the 2013 award and their share of the votes cast were as follows:\n{|class=\"wikitable \"\n! width=\"130\" |Nominee\n! width=\"100\" |Sport\n!2013 achievement\n!BBC Profile\n!Votes (percentage)\n|- style=\"font-weight:bold; background:gold;\"\n|Andy Murray||Tennis|| Became the first British man in the Open Era to win a singles title at Wimbledon (and the first outright since Fred Perry 77 years prior). ||[https://web.archive.org/web/20131212103604/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00grqnh/profiles/andy-murray] ||401,470 ()\n|- style=\"background:silver;\"\n|Leigh Halfpenny||Rugby union||Designated man-of-the-series in the victorious Lions tour of Australia (their first series victory in 16 years) and player of the tournament in the Six Nations. ||[https://web.archive.org/web/20131212123619/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00grqnh/profiles/leigh-halfpenny] ||65,913 ()\n|- style=\"background:tan;\"\n|AP McCoy||Horse racing ||Became the first jump jockey to ride 4,000 winners. ||[https://web.archive.org/web/20131213230344/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00grqnh/profiles/ap-mccoy] ||57,854 ()\n|-\n|Mo Farah||Athletics||Won the 5,000m and 10,000m events at the IAAF World Championships, thus becoming the first Briton to successfully defend a world title and win three.
