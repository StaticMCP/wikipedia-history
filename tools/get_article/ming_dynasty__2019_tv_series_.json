Starring Tang Wei and Zhu Yawen, it aired on Hunan Television until 2020. Loosely adapted from the novel The Chronicle of the Six Eras () by Lianjing Zhuyi (), the show gained much attention and viewership from non-Chinese viewers after it achieved high ratings in mainland China.\nSynopsis\nAfter a successful insurrection against Jianwen Emperor, the Yongle Emperor orders the execution of many high-ranking officials of the court loyal to his deposed predecessor. Among them is the royal doctor Jing Qing, whose entire family is condemned alongside him. His two daughters escape and are separated in the process.\nThe younger daughter is adopted by a high ranking inner court attendant named Hu and renamed Hu Shanxiang. The elder daughter is rescued and adopted by the general Sun Yu and given the name Sun Ruowei. The two daughters live out different lives: the younger is raised in the Imperial Palace as a maid and the older with a group of rebels loyal to the previous emperor. Ruowei gains literacy and martial arts skills, which prove helpful later.\nYears later, Qingzheng Cult, in which Ruowei is raised, continues to plot to overthrow Yongle and re-establish Jianwen. During this time, Yongle's favorite grandson Zhu Zhanji is zealous in purging the remaining rebels; he meets Ruowei while doing so. Zhanji's attraction toward her grows, as her character and behavior differ from those of other palace ladies, such as Ruowei's penchant for speaking her mind.\nDuring this time, her younger sister, Hu Shanxiang, rises through the ranks to a fairly high ranking attendant. She makes a deal with Zhanji's second uncle (Prince Han): he recommends her to be Zhanji's main wife; in exchange, Shanxiang will be his agent embedded in Zhanji's palace. Ruowei and Zhanji also marry, upon which she becomes the Imperial Concubine to the Imperial Grandson.\nAfterward, Crown Prince Zhu Gaochi is left in Beijing to run the country while Yongle, his other sons, and grandson are go to war in the north. Already ill and needing help with the war correspondence with his father in the battlefield, Gaochi finds out that his new daughter-in-law, Ruowei, is literate and that her calligraphy is very similar to his. She becomes his personal scribe for the war effort and learns the ropes of running the country at war. As Gaochi's health deteriorates, she has to deliberate and give orders to the imperial counsels.\nOver time, Ruowei's hatred for the Emperor and her quest for revenge dissipates as she weighs the costs of many other human lives to achieve revenge. After the untimely passing of Yongle, Gaochi who succeeds him as the Hongxi Emperor, and Zhanji who succeeds him as the Xuande Emperor; Ruowei finds herself in the middle of a power struggle between her son Emperor Yingzong of Ming and the Jingtai Emperor.\nWith her experience and ability, she guides her son through danger and helps him become a noble and virtuous ruler. In the end, Ruowei realizes that she cannot save the imperial family from the violence and bloodshed engendered by the struggle for the throne.
