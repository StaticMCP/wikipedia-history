Lt. Col Cumming and his battalion were defending an airfield during the Battle of Malaya when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC (currently displayed at the National Army Museum).\nOn 3 January 1942 near Kuantan, Malaya, the Japanese made a furious attack on the battalion and a strong enemy force penetrated the position. Lieutenant Colonel Cumming, with a small party of men, immediately led a counter-attack and although all his men became casualties and he, himself, had two bayonet wounds in the stomach he managed to restore the situation sufficiently for the major portion of the battalion and its vehicles to be withdrawn. Later he drove in a carrier, under very heavy fire, collecting isolated detachments of his men and was again wounded. His gallant actions helped the brigade to withdraw safely.\nCumming was one of a small number of officers and men who were ordered to be evacuated from Singapore before the island was surrendered on 15 February 1942. Cumming commanded a battalion of the 9th Jat Regiment before his promotion to brigadier and command of the 63rd Indian Brigade during the Burma campaign. From 1944 to his retirement in 1947 Brigadier Cumming was in command of the Dehra Dun District in India.\nHis VC is on display at the National Army Museum, Chelsea.\nSee also\n*Japanese Invasion of Malaya\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*Monuments to Courage (David Harvey, 1999)\n*The Register of the Victoria Cross (This England, 1997)\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100820033615/http://national-army-museum.ac.uk/exhibitions/vc/page4-2.shtml National Army Museum]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20041225165403/http://www.homeusers.prestel.co.uk/stewart/edinburg.htm Location of grave and VC medal] (Edinburgh)"
