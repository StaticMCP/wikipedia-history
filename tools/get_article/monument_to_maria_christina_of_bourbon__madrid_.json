Designed by Mariano Benlliure and consisting of a bronze statue of the aforementioned queen consort and regent of Spain and a stone pedestal with additional sculptural elements, the monument lies in front of the Casón del Buen Retiro.\nHistory and description\non 30 June 1903 to account for the inauguration]]\nLobbied by General Manuel Pavía y Lacy, the project for the monument was awarded to the architect  and to the sculptor Mariano Benlliure.\nThe lower body serving as basement follows a polygonal shape, displaying a number of inscriptions commemorating several feats of the rule of Maria Christina: , , ; ; ; , .\nThe pedestal lies above the basement; similar to the monument dedicated to another female individual such as Bárbara de Braganza'''s, a borderless cylindrical pedestal was employed. The lower part of the pedestal features a circular frieze with lion heads and garlands. The (frontal) part of the pedestal facing west displays a cartouche reading ) (\"To Maria Christina of Bourbon. A recognised Spain\"), while the part of the pedestal behind the queen's back features another cartouche reading \"1893\". The flanks of the pedestal feature two reliefs illustrating the 1839 Embrace of Vergara and Maria Christina signing the 1832 decree of amnesty (a document in favour of the political exiles who had fled from the absolutist crackdown of her husband King Ferdinand VII, in her role as governing queen during the illness of Ferdinand VII, preceding the latter's final demise in 1833).\nThe monument is topped by the bronze statue representing a full body figure of Maria Christina, holding the Royal Statute with her right hand while grabbing her mantle with the left hand.\nBelow the Queen, seated on the pedestal, there is a marble classicist statue representing a female allegory of History, depicted with a naked nipple while holding a book that reads  (\"History\").\nIt was unveiled on 25 June 1893.\nReferences\n;Citations\n;Bibliography\n*\n*\n*"
