Located  about  into the Western Wall Tunnel, the gate was first described by and later named after nineteenth century British surveyor Charles Warren. During the Second Temple period, Warren's Gate led to a tunnel and staircase at the Temple Mount.\nFollowing the Rashidun Caliphate conquest of Jerusalem from the Byzantines, Jews were allowed to pray inside the tunnel, turning the location into a Jewish synagogue. When the synagogue was destroyed in the First Crusade during the siege of Jerusalem in 1099, the tunnel ended up becoming a water cistern, thus its later name being Cistern 30.\nThe area is surrounded by a vaulted  tunnel.\nRabbi Yehuda Getz, the late official Rabbi of the Western Wall, believed that the Gate represented the point west of the Wall closest to the Holy of Holies. An underground dispute broke out in July 1981 between Jewish explorers who were inside Warren's Gate and Arab guards who came down to meet them through surface cistern entries. A small underground riot commenced, but soon ended when the Jerusalem police appeared at the scene, restoring peace.\nReferences"
