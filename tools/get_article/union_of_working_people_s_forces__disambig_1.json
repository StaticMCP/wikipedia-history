In ideological terms, the UNWPF represented a right-wing tendency in the Lebanese Nasserist movement.\nNajah Wakim was elected to parliament in 1972, making him the sole Nasserist deputy.\nThe UWPF in the Lebanese Civil War\nSyrian Arab Armed Forces  Amal Movement Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)\n| opponents        =  Lebanese Front Lebanese Armed Forces Progressive Socialist Party (PSP)/ People's Liberation Army (PLA) Lebanese Communist Party (LCP)/Popular Guard Al-Mourabitoun Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Israel Defense Forces (IDF)\n}}\nIn the early phase of the Lebanese Civil War the UWPF maintained a 1,000-man strong militia, the Victory Divisions (Arabic:  Firqat an-Nasr), which fought alongside the Lebanese National Movement (LNM) militias in the Beirut area, and also maintained military training camps in Nabatieh, Kfar Remen and Habboûch, and received significant support from both the Shia and Sunni Muslim communities. However, in late March 1976 the UWPF left the LNM to enter the pro-Syrian Front of Patriotic and National Parties (FPNP) alliance, and supported the June 1976 Syrian intervention in Lebanon, which caused a rift between them and the other Nasserist groups. From June to November 1976 the UWPF and its militia faced onslaughts by Fatah and the other LNM militias.\nThere was also a splinter group of the party, the Union of Working People's Forces-Corrective Movement (UWPF-CM), formed in October 1974 and led by Issam Al-Arab.\nSee also\n*Arab Socialist Union (Lebanon)\n*Al-Mourabitoun\n*Battle of the Hotels\n*Front of Patriotic and National Parties\n*Lebanese Civil War\n*Lebanese Front\n*Lebanese National Movement\n*List of weapons of the Lebanese Civil War\n*People's Movement (Lebanon)\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Alain Menargues, ''Les Secrets de la guerre du Liban: Du coup d'état de Béchir Gémayel aux massacres des camps palestiniens'', Albin Michel, Paris 2004.
