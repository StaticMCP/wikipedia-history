The timing of the coup took advantage of the fact that the Chinese withdrew half of its garrison troops from Seoul.\nAfter only three days, the revolt was suppressed by Chinese military forces which were garrisoned in the Korean capital city of Hanseong (Seoul).  During the conflict, the Japanese legation building was burned down, and forty Japanese were killed.\nInoue Kaoru was the chief Japanese diplomat in dealings with Korea.  Diplomatic negotiations were concluded in January 1885.\nTreaty provisions\nThe Japanese government demanded and received an apology and reparations.\nAftermath\nIn an effort to defuse tensions over Korea, both Japan and China agreed to withdraw their troops from Korea in the Convention of Tientsin of April 1885.\nSee also\n* Unequal treaties\nNotes\nReferences\n* Duus, Peter.
