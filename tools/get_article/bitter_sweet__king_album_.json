The album peaked at number 16 in the UK Album Chart and was certified Gold by the BPI.\nThe first single from the album was \"Alone Without You\" which reached the UK Top 10. Two further singles were taken from the album, \"The Taste of Your Tears\" (UK #11) and \"Torture\" (UK #23).\nThe cassette edition of the record featured a slightly different track listing, containing a slow reprise of the first single \"Alone Without You\", and the 12\" extended remix replacing the 7\" version of \"The Taste of Your Tears\".\nThe original 1985 CD edition (made in Japan for Europe) also has a different track order and features remixes of the 2 singles \"Torture\" and \"The Taste of Your Tears\" instead of the album versions of these songs.\nThe 1985 CD release in Japan and all digital versions sold online follow the original LP track listing.\nIn September 2007, the album was remastered and re-released on CD by Cherry Red label with eight bonus tracks including remixes and B-sides.\nTrack listing\nLP & Japanese CD\n#\"Alone Without You\" – 3:35 (P.
