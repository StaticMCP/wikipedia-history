The group went on hiatus on January 3, 2018 before returning on July 7, 2023, with the single \"Higher\". The group consists of producer-rapper Cole \"Saint X\" Walowac and producer-singer Jonathan \"Nevada\" White who was briefly replaced by Dylan Housewright.\nHistory\nJonathan White and Cole Walowac formed Capital Kings while still living in their hometown of Washington D.C. White stated that he met Cole in his church nursery and that they \"started playing in the youth group band... Cole would play drums and I would sing and that's how we started making music.\"\nTheir debut album Capital Kings was released on January 8, 2013 and entered the Billboard Christian Albums Chart in the Top 5.\nThey released a remix album, Remixd, on March 11, 2014, that included six remixed songs from their first album, and a new song, \"Be a King\".\nTheir second album, II, was released on October 2, 2015.\nOn February 23, 2016, during the Hits Deep Tour of which Capital Kings was a part, White announced he would be leaving the group to make solo music under the name Nevada, leaving Walowac as the only member. Within a few months, rumors began circulating that Dylan Housewright would be Nevada's replacement after he went on tour with Cole Walowac, and soon he became the unannounced new replacement for Nevada after the release of their single \"I Can't Quit\" featuring Reconcile.\nIn 2017, Capital Kings released a series of singles. \"Love Is On Our Side\" was released on June 2, 2017, \"Don't Wanna Wake Up\" was released on August 4, 2017, \"All Good\" was released on September 1, 2017 and \"Rip It Up\" was released on October 6, 2017. Following the release of these singles, Capital Kings announced they would be taking an indefinite hiatus due to the birth of Dylan Housewright's child. Walowac went on to pursue a production career under the moniker \"Saint X\" and signed to Warner Chappell.\nOn July 7, 2023, Capital Kings marked its return to music with the single \"Higher\" featuring Evvie McKinney and Jesse Francis on vocals.\nCritical response\nCapital Kings has received mainly positive reception since the release of their debut album. The Houston Chronicle noted that while there has been little success for crossover electronic-pop acts, \"the one finally to break away from the herd just might be Capital Kings.\" CCM Magazine said \"There's a new sound in town thanks to Capital Kings, whose ingenious blend of electronic, hip hop, pop and even some dubstep has inspired everyone from TobyMac to Group 1 Crew and Mandisa…[Capital Kings] is quickly growing into a formidable force of their own thanks to the new self-titled long player on Gotee Records.\"\nPersonnel\n* Cole Edward Walowac (Saint X)  – rapper, DJ, producer, vocals (2010–present)\n* Jonathan Dean White (Nevada) – lead vocals, background vocals, DJ, producer (2010–2016, 2023–present)\n* Dylan Housewright – lead vocals (2016–2018)\nDiscography\n* 2013 – Capital Kings\n* 2015 – II\nAlbum appearances\nFeatures\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Artist\n!Album\n!Song\n|-\n|2013\n|Royal Tailor\n|Royal Tailor\n|\"Ready Set Go\"\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2014\n|Group 1 Crew\n|#STRONGER\n|\"Keep Goin'\"\n|-\n|Da' T.R.U.T.H.\n|Heartbeat\n|\"Loud & Clear (featuring Tedashii and Jon White [of Capital Kings])\"\n|-\n|2015\n|TobyMac\n|This is Not a Test\n|\"This is Not a Test\"\n|}\nRemixes\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Artist\n!Album\n!Song\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |2012\n| rowspan=\"4\" |TobyMac\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Eye on It (Deluxe Edition)\n''Eye'M All Mixed Up (Remixes)\n|\"Me Without You (Capital Kings Remix)\"\n|-\n|\"Lose Myself (Capital Kings Remix)\"\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Dubbed and Freq'd: A Remix Project\n|\"Showstopper (Capital Kings Remix)\"\n|-\n|\"Tonight (Capital Kings Remix)\"\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2013\n|Natalie Grant\n|Hurricane (Deluxe Edition)\n|\"Closer to Your Heart (Capital Kings Remix)\"\n|-\n|David Crowder Band\n|All This for a King: The Essential Collection\n|\"After All (Holy) (Capital Kings Remix)\"\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |2014\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Mandisa\n|Get Up: The Remixes\nOvercomer (Deluxe Edition)\n|\"Overcomer (Capital Kings Remix)\"\n|-\n|Get Up: The Remixes\n|\"Good Morning (Capital Kings Remix)\"\n|-\n|Colton Dixon\n|A Messenger (Expanded Edition)\n|\"Never Gone (Capital Kings Remix)\"\n|-\n|Capital Kings\n|Remixd\n|\"Born to Love (featuring Britt Nicole) [McSwagger // Cap Kings Remix]\"\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2015\n|Britt Nicole\n|The Remixes\n|\"Amazing Life (Capital Kings Remix)\"\n|-\n|TobyMac\n|II\n|\"This Is Not a Test (Capital Kings Remix)\"\n|-\n|2018\n|TobyMac\n| –\n|\"I just need U.
