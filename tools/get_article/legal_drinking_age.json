The minimum age alcohol can be legally consumed can be different from the age when it can be purchased in some countries. These laws vary between countries and many laws have exemptions or special circumstances. Most laws apply only to drinking alcohol in public places with alcohol consumption in the home being mostly unregulated (one of the exceptions being England and Wales, which have a minimum legal age of five for supervised consumption in private places). Some countries also have different age limits for different types of alcohol drinks.\nThe majority of countries have a minimum legal drinking age of 18. The most commonly known reason for the law behind the legal drinking age is the effect on the brain in adolescents. Since the brain is still maturing, alcohol can have a negative effect on the memory and long-term thinking. Alongside that, it can cause liver failure, and create a hormone imbalance in teens due to the constant changes and maturing of hormones during puberty. Some countries have a minimum legal drinking age of 19 to prevent the flow of alcoholic beverages in high schools, while others like the United States have a minimum legal purchasing age of 21 (except in P.R. and USVI, where the drinking age is 18) in an effort to reduce the amount of drunk driving rates among teenagers and young adults.\nThere are underage clubs, where people below the legal drinking age are catered for and are served non-alcoholic beverages.\nAfrica\nThe most common minimum age to purchase alcohol in Africa is 18. However, Angola (except Luanda Province), Central African Republic, Comoros, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Mali have no laws on the books restricting the sale of alcohol to minors. In Libya, Somalia and Sudan the sale, production and consumption of alcohol is completely prohibited.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 style=\"width:12%;\"| Country\n! rowspan=2 style=\"width:12%;\"| State/&thinsp;region/&thinsp;province\n! colspan=2 style=\"width:20%;\"| De jure\n! rowspan=2 style=\"width:56%;\"| Notes\n|-\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Drinking age\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Purchase age\n|-\n| colspan=2|\n| style=\"background:Gainsboro\" align=\"center\" |None\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 18\n|Order No. 26-75 (1975), Article 14\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|\n|\n| style=\"background:Gainsboro\" align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\" |None\n| There is no national legislation prohibiting the sale of alcohol to minors.\n|-\n|Luanda Province\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" | 18\n| Legislation in Luanda Province: It is prohibited to sell alcohol beverages to anyone under the age of 18.

The act does not apply to the age of alcohol consumption (i.e., states may allow alcohol consumption by those under 21 years of age without penalty). Exceptions to the drinking age are governed by state law.\nSome states do not allow those under the legal drinking age to be present in liquor stores or in bars (usually, the difference between a bar and a restaurant is that food is served only in the latter). Only a few states prohibit minors and young adults from consuming alcohol in private settings.\nThe National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism maintains a database that details state-level regulations on consumption and sale age limits.\n|-\n|'\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |18\n|Law 118 Penalties for Provision of Alcoholic Beverages to Minors under 18 years of age (1984)\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |18\n|\n|-\n| colspan=2|\n| style=\"background:Gainsboro\" align=\"center\" |None\n| align=\"center\" |18\n| Selling alcohol to minors under the age of 18 is prohibited, with fines between 50 and 200 Unidades Reajustables (UY$ 89,000-355,000 or US$ 2,000-8,000 as of January 2025).

The two exceptions are Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands where the age is 18. The legal drinking age varies by state, and many states have no age requirements for supervised drinking with one's parents or legal guardians.\nDespite a rekindled national debate in 2008 on the established drinking age (initiated by several university presidents), a Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind poll found in September 2008 that 76% of New Jerseyans supported leaving the legal drinking age at 21 years. No significant differences emerged when considering gender, political affiliation, or region. However, parents of younger children were more likely to support keeping the age at 21 (83%) than parents of college-age students (67%).\nSeventeen states (Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Wyoming) and the District of Columbia have laws against possession of alcohol by minors, but they do not prohibit its consumption by minors.\nFourteen states (Alaska, Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Wisconsin, and Virginia) specifically permit minors to drink alcohol given to them by their parents or by someone entrusted by their parents.\nMany states also permit the drinking of alcohol under the age of 21 for religious or health reasons.\nPuerto Rico, a territory of the United States, has maintained a drinking age of 18.\nUnited States customs laws stipulate that no person under the age of 21 may bring any type or quantity of alcohol into the country.\nThe United States is the only Western nation in the world setting the limit for alcohol consumption and purchases at 21. While the measure is comprehensible to limit underage drinking and alcohol-related traffic crashes, the outcome did not generate less underage drinking or traffic accidents. Canada with a drinking age set at 18 or 19 has less alcohol-related traffic crashes than the U.S. The rationale to increase the drinking age to 21 is based on erroneous statistics from the 1980's, and could even increase criminal behavior.\nAsia\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! rowspan=2 width=100| Country\n! colspan=2| De jure\n! rowspan=2 class=unsortable| Notes\n|-\n! width=150| Drinking age\n! width=150| Purchase age\n|-\n|\n| colspan=2 style=\"text-align:center;\"|Prohibited for all ages\n|\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:Gainsboro\" align=\"center\" |None\n| align=\"center\" |18\n| There are no laws mandating alcohol vendors to ID potential underage drinkers.

In 2005, 2007 and 2015 harmonization at the European Union level toward a minimum purchase age of 18 was discussed, but not agreed.\nTimeline of changes to drinking/purchase age or laws restricting the access to alcohol for minors:\n* In 2002 the Spanish autonomous-communities Madrid, Valencia and Catalonia raised their minimum purchase age to 18 years. Previously, Valencia and Madrid had a minimum purchase age of 16 years, and in Catalonia minors aged 16 or 17 could purchase alcohol up to 23% ABV on- and off-premise.\n* In 2004 Denmark raised its off-premise purchase age from 15 to 16 years.\n* In November 2005 Switzerland passed its Food and Commodities Regulation (German: Lebensmittel- und Gebrauchsgegenständeverordnung), introducing a ban on alcohol sales to anyone under the age of 16. The Alcohol Law (German: Alkoholgesetz) passed in 1980 requires a minimum age of 18 years for the retail sale of distilled spirits. Therefore, it is prohibited to sell fermented alcohol (e.g. beer, wine, sparkling wine or cider) to anyone under the age of 16, and any distilled alcohol beverages to anyone under the age of 18 years. The canton of Ticino has a cantonal law since 1989 that makes the purchase age limit for all alcohol beverages 18 years.\n* In 2006 the Spanish autonomous community Castile and León raised its minimum purchase age from 16 to 18 years.\n* In late 2006, Gibraltar lawmakers passed the Children and Young Persons (Alcohol, Tobacco and Gaming) Act 2006, which raised the minimum purchase age from 16 to 18 years. But the new law made an exception: minors aged 16 or 17 can purchase and consume beer, wine or cider under 15% ABV on-premise, and pre-packed containers of an alcohol strength not exceeding 5.5% ABV (e.g. alcopops).\n* In 2009 France raised its minimum purchase age to 18 years, and fines were increased for selling or serving alcohol to a minor (up to €7,500). Previously, the minimum age was 16 years for off-premise and on-premise purchases of low-alcohol beverages (up to 3% ABV) such as wine, beer, cider, perry, mead, crème de cassis and juices from fermented fruits or vegetables that contain 1.2 to 3° alcohol, natural sweet wines from controlled cultivation and 18 for higher-ABV beverages.\n* In October 2009, the government of Malta passed a new law raising its drinking and purchase age from 16 to 17 years.\n* In 2010 the Spanish autonomous community of Galicia raised its minimum purchase age from 16 to 18 years.\n* In 2011 Denmark passed a law raising the minimum age for off-premise sale of alcohol beverages of >16.5% ABV to 18 years of age.

The states Burgenland, Lower Austria and Vienna therefore raised their age limits for alcohol beverages containing spirits to 18. Prior to 2019 these states had a general drinking and purchase age of 16 years.
