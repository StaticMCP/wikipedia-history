According to him, single pro-Russian tanks supported by scouts and mortar fire to suppress antitank weapons shoot three or four rounds on a target before shifting its firing positions in order to attack the objective repeatedly.\n* 3 January: Pro-Russian scouts in snow camouflage suits executed harassing fire on Ukraine's 92nd brigade positions near Shchastia using automatic weapons and rocket propelled grenades.\n* 4 January: Heavy shelling was witnessed by local residents in Donetsk city, where militias entrenched around the train station fired \"Gvozdika\" howitzer salvos on the airport. \"Uragan\" or \"Smerch\" artillery rockets were launched from Shchehlovskoho cemetery. Fourteen civilians were injured.\n* 6 January: Heavy shelling was reported at Donetsk airport and other Ukrainian positions. The rebels fired mortars, artillery and multiple-rocket launchers. Ukrainian troops clashed with enemy scouts near Starolaspa, killing two militiamen and scattering the survivors. Some Ukrainian army units attended local churches in the front to celebrate Orthodox Christmas.\n* 7 January: On Christmas Day, Donetsk airport and surrounding locations were once again shelled with mortars and multiple rocket launchers.\n* 9 January: Heavy fighting erupted near Stanytsia Luhanska between the Ukrainian National Guard and rebel militias.

Ukrainian and pro-Russian forces trade intense gunfire in the area of Stanytsia Luhanska.\n* 11 January: Two industrial plants were damaged by artillery fire in Donetsk city and in nearby Avdiivka. In Donetsk, 364 workers were trapped inside \"Zasyatko\" coal mine after a shell hit a power substation, disabling four boilers and 63 transformers.

At least 13 civilians were killed and 15 injured, after a \"Grad\" artillery rocket exploded near passenger bus at Buhas roadblock near Volnovakha. Initially separatists took responsibility for this incident, which they thought was a successful destruction of the Ukrainian roadblock. After the information about civilian bus hit the news, they denied having \"even technical possibilities\" to shell that area. OSCE experts inspecting the place of incident confirmed that it was caused by \"rockets fired from a north-north-eastern direction\". which coincides with the earlier analyses pointed to Dokuchaevsk as the shelling origin (the actual launching process was also allegedly filmed by local residents).\n* 15 January: The rebels launched a major assault on Donetsk airport, killing two Ukrainian paratroopers and wounding seven, according to Ukrainian sources. The Ukrainian forces had lost by then two thirds of the new terminal. The pro-Russian offensive in the area continued into the next day. One Ukrainian paratrooper was killed and eleven wounded. The rebels launched tear gas grenades to support their assault.\n* 17 January: Shelling of the Donetsk Airport area by separatists significantly increased and as result of a significant push forward their forces effectively surrounded the government forces, cutting supply and enforcement lines.

Ukrainian troops continued to hold out on the first floor of the building until the separatists blew up the second floor, causing it to collapse onto them. Several soldiers were killed or trapped in the rubble. Pro-Russian forces supported by tanks and artillery launched a large offensive on Bakhmutka road, taking over checkpoint No. 31, north of Frunze, and threatening checkpoint nº 29 to the west. The main objective of the rebel operation was to isolate Krimsky. The village of Zholobok was overrun by what the Ukrainian forces described as \"Russian troops\".
