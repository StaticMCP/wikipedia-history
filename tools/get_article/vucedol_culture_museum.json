Both sides along this steep pass make up the archaeological site, on the left is the Karasović Vineyard, and on the right is a large complex which includes the Streim Vineyard and the Streim Cornfield. Artificially separated from the pass, a little plateau known as Gradac, which through archeological excavations was confirmed as being the metallurgical and cultural centre of the site. It gives its name to the Vučedol culture that existed in Copper Age Europe.\nThe first investigations of the site dates back to 1897. The location was first inhabited around 6,000 B.C. and was inhabited intensively through the whole of prehistory. During the period between 3,350 – 2,300 B.C. it was a significant centre of human settlement in Europe. This period coincides with the early settlements of Troy (Troy I and II) and many similarities can be found between the archaeological material from Troy and Vučedol.\nArchaeological excavations to date are able to precisely reconstruct the daily life and customs of four cultural phenomena which in that time swept through the sites of the Vučedol culture - Baden, Kostolac, Vučedol and Vinkovci. It was a turbulent time of the immigration of the first Indo-Europeans and their relationship with the natives, the blending of material cultures and religions. Each of the aforementioned settlements had its own characteristics, however the most detailed one able to be reconstructed is the Vučedol one, which also gave its name to this site.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n* The Vučedol archaeological site is located on the right bank of the Danube River.
