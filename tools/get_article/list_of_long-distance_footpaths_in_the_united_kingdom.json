They are mainly used for hiking and walking, but some may also be used, in whole or in part, for mountain biking and horse riding. Most are in rural landscapes, in varying terrain, some passing through National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. There is no formal definition of a long-distance path, though the British Long Distance Walkers Association defines one as a route \"20 miles [32 km] or more in length and mainly off-road.\" They usually follow existing rights of way, often over private land, linked and sometimes waymarked to make a named route. Generally, the surface is not specially prepared, with rough ground, uneven surfaces and stiles, which can cause accessibility issues for people with disabilities. Exceptions to this can be converted railways, canal towpaths and some popular fell walking routes where stone-pitching and slabs have been laid to prevent erosion. Many long-distance footpaths are arranged around a particular theme such as one specific range of hills or a historical or geographical connection.\nEngland and Wales: National Trails\nNational Trails are a network of long-distance paths in England and Wales (plus a small stretch of the Pennine Way in Scotland) funded by Natural England and Natural Resources Wales and maintained by local authorities under a Trail Partnership. , there are over  of trails on seventeen routes. The longest trail, the England Coast Path, is not complete though more sections are planned to open over the coming months and years, with a planned completion date of around 2024. The newest trail is the Coast to Coast Walk which will officially open in 2025. There are 83 million visits to the National Trails each year and over 80,000 people complete a trail.\nFile:Ivinghoe Beacon seen from The Ridgeway.jpg|Ivinghoe Beacon (the eastern trailhead) seen looking north from the Ridgeway\nFile:Black Hill (Peak District).jpg|The paved surface of the Pennine Way on Black Hill\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Name\n! colspan=2 | Length\n! rowspan=2 | Region\n! rowspan=2 | Endpoint one\n! rowspan=2 | Endpoint two\n! rowspan=2 | Description\n|-\n! mi\n! km\n|-\n| Cleveland Way ||  || North Yorkshire, England || Helmsley || Filey Brigg || Runs around the edge of the North York Moors National Park in a horseshoe configuration.\n|-\n| Cotswold Way ||  || The Cotswolds, Central England || Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire || Bath, Somerset || Runs along the Cotswold Edge escarpment of the Cotswold Hills.\n|-\n| Coast to Coast Walk* ||  || Cumbria and North Yorkshire, Northern England || St Bees, Cumbria || Robin Hood's Bay, North Yorkshire || Devised by Alfred Wainwright and announced to become a National Trail in 2022.\n|-\n| England Coast Path ||† || England || N/A || N/A || Will cover the entire coast of England and will be the longest managed and waymarked coastal path in the world.\n|-\n| Glyndŵr's Way ||  || Powys, mid Wales || Knighton || Welshpool || Runs in an extended loop.\n|-\n| Hadrian's Wall Path ||  || England: Tyne and Wear, Northumberland, Cumbria || Wallsend, Tyne and Wear || Bowness-on-Solway, Cumbria || Runs from the east to west coast along the remains of Hadrian's Wall.\n|-\n| North Downs Way ||  || South Eastern England || Farnham, Surrey || Dover, Kent || Passes through the areas of outstanding natural beauty (AONB) of the Surrey Hills and Kent Downs.\n|-\n| Offa's Dyke Path ||  || Wales–England border || Sedbury, Gloucestershire || Prestatyn, Denbighshire || Follows close to the border near the remnants of Offa's Dyke.\n|-\n| Peddars Way and Norfolk Coast Path‡ ||  || England in Suffolk and Norfolk || Knettishall Heath, Knettishall, Suffolk || Cromer, Norfolk || The two paths join at Holme-next-the-Sea.\n|-\n| Pembrokeshire Coast Path ||  || Pembrokeshire, southwest Wales || Poppit Sands, near St Dogmaels || Amroth || Has a total of  of ascent and descent and lies almost completely within the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park.\n|-\n| Pennine Bridleway ||  || Pennines, Northern England || Middleton-by-Wirksworth, Derbyshire || Ravenstonedale, Cumbria || Runs roughly parallel to the Pennine Way.\n|-\n| Pennine Way ||  || Pennines, Northern England and Southern Scotland || Edale, Derbyshire || Kirk Yetholm, Scottish Borders || Spans the length of the Pennines, according to the Ramblers, \"one of Britain's best known and toughest\" trails.\n|-\n| The Ridgeway ||  || Berkshire Downs, Southern England || Overton Hill, near Avebury, Wiltshire || Ivinghoe Beacon, Buckinghamshire || Ancient trackway on a chalk ridge described as Britain's oldest road.\n|-\n| South Downs Way ||  || South Downs in Southern England || Winchester, Hampshire || Eastbourne, East Sussex || Within the South Downs National Park.\n|-\n| South West Coast Path (South West Way) ||  || England: Somerset, Devon, Cornwall & Dorset || Minehead, Somerset || Poole Harbour, Dorset || Originated as a route for the Coastguard to walk from lighthouse to lighthouse patrolling for smugglers.\n|-\n| Thames Path ||  || Southern England || Kemble, Gloucestershire || Thames Barrier, Charlton|| Follows the River Thames from its source to the Thames Barrier in London.\n|-\n| Yorkshire Wolds Way ||  || Yorkshire, England || Hessle, East Riding of Yorkshire || Filey, North Yorkshire || Runs around the Yorkshire Wolds.\n|}\n*\n† }}\n‡\nScotland: Great Trails\nScotland's Great Trails are long-distance \"people-powered\" trails (predominantly hiking trails but including cycling, horse-riding and canoe routes) in Scotland. NatureScot maintains the official list of Scotland's Great Trails and is the custodian of the brand, but responsibility for creating and maintaining each route lies with each local authority through which a route passes, although Scottish Natural Heritage provides some of the finance and publicity. There are 29 routes, offering  of trails in total.\nEach of the routes is clearly waymarked with a dedicated symbol, and run largely off-road. They range in length from , and are intended to be tackled over several days, either as a combination of day trips or as an end-to-end expedition. They are primarily intended for walkers, but may have sections suitable for cyclists and horse-riders. One of the trails, the Great Glen Canoe Trail, is designed for canoeists and kayakers.\nFile:Fife Coast path at West Wemyss - geograph.org.uk - 1366601.jpg|Fife Coastal Path at West Wemyss\nFile:West Highland Way 2005 Coe.jpg|The Devil's Staircase on the West Highland Way\nFile:Cliffs from Berwickshire Coastal path - geograph.org.uk - 323939.jpg|Cliffs from the Berwickshire Coastal Path\nFile:A St Cuthbert's Way marker post - geograph.org.uk - 1387283.jpg|A St Cuthbert's Way marker post at the edge of the square between Grubbit Law and Wideopen Hill\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Name\n! colspan=2 | Length\n! rowspan=2 | Region\n! rowspan=2 | Endpoint one\n! rowspan=2 | Endpoint two\n! rowspan=2 | Description\n|-\n! mi\n! km\n|-\n| Annandale Way ||  || Solway Coast, Dumfries and Galloway || Moffat || Annan || Follows the valley of the River Annan from its source in the Moffat Hills to the sea in the Solway Firth.\n|-\n| Arran Coastal Way ||  || Isle of Arran || N/A || N/A || Circular route around the coastline of the Isle of Arran.\n|-\n| Ayrshire Coastal Path ||  || Ayrshire || Glenapp, Ballantrae || Skelmorlie, North Ayrshire || Runs alongside the coast and forms part of the International Appalachian Trail.\n|-\n| Berwickshire Coastal Path ||  || Scottish Borders and Northern England || Cockburnspath, Scottish Borders || Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland || Coastal path spanning the Anglo-Scottish border.\n|-\n|Borders Abbeys Way ||  || Scottish Borders || N/A || N/A || Circular route in the Borders passing through the ruins of many abbeys: Kelso – Jedburgh – Hawick – Selkirk – Melrose.\n|-\n|Cateran Trail ||  || Perth and Kinross and Angus || Blairgowrie and Rattray || N/A || Circular route covering many conditions such as farmland, mountains and forest: Blairgowrie – Kirkmichael – Spittal of Glenshee – Alyth.\n|-\n|Clyde Walkway ||  || South Lanarkshire || Glasgow || New Lanark ||  Runs close to the River Clyde for most of its length.\n|-\n|Cowal Way ||  || Cowal Peninsula, Argyll and Bute || Portavadie || Inveruglas on Loch Lomond || Connects with the West Highland Way.\n|-\n|Cross Borders Drove Road ||  || Edinburgh and the Scottish Borders ||Little Vantage, near Edinburgh || Hawick|| One of the newest trails based on existing routes.\n|-\n|Dava Way ||  || Moray || Grantown-on-Spey || Forres || Follows the route of the former Highland Railway which closed in 1965.\n|-\n|Fife Coastal Path ||  || Fife || Kincardine || Newburgh || When opened it originally ran from North Queensferry to Tayport, but was later extended.\n|-\n|Formartine and Buchan Way ||  || Aberdeenshire || Dyce, near Aberdeen || Fraserburgh and Peterhead || Follows the track of the former railway line the Formartine and Buchan Railway which closed in 1970.
