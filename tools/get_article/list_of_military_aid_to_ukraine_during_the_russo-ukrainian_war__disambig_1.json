This includes weaponry, equipment, training, logistical support as well as financial support, unless earmarked for humanitarian purposes. Weapons sent as a result of cooperation between multiple countries are listed separately under each country.\nThe aid has mostly been co-ordinated through the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, whose 57 member countries include all 32 member states of NATO. The European Union co-ordinated weapons supplies through its institutions for the first time. Because of the invasion, some donor countries, such as Germany and Sweden, overturned policies against providing offensive military aid.\nBy March 2024, mostly Western governments had pledged more than $380 billion worth of aid to Ukraine since the invasion, including nearly $118 billion in direct military aid from individual countries. European countries have provided €132 billion in aid (military, financial and humanitarian) as of December 2024, and the United States has provided €114 billion. Most of the US funding supports American industries who produce weapons and military equipment.\nFearing escalation, NATO states have hesitated to provide heavier and more advanced weapons to Ukraine, or have imposed limits such as forbidding Ukraine to use them to strike inside Russia. Since June 2024, they have lifted some of these restrictions, allowing Ukraine to strike Russian military targets near the border in self-defence.\nAccording to defence expert Malcolm Chalmers, at the beginning of 2025 the US provided 20% of all military equipment Ukraine was using, with 25% provided by Europe and 55% produced by Ukraine. However, the 20% supplied by the US \"is the most lethal and important.\"\n__TOC__\nDonors\nThe donation of military aid was coordinated at monthly meetings in the Ukraine Defense Contact Group throughout the war. A first meeting took place between 41 countries on 26 April 2022, and the coalition comprised 54 countries (all 30 member states of NATO and 24 other countries) at the latest meeting on 14 February 2023. All EU member states donated military aid collectively via EU institutions; all but three (Hungary, Cyprus and Malta) also donated individually as sovereign countries.\nAs of February 2023, military aid was donated by EU institutions, 45 sovereign countries, companies, and other parties.\nSovereign countries\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style= \"line-height:1.3em;\"\n|-\n!Country\n!Military aid\n|- id=\"A\"\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|\nMine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicles\n* 22 International M1224 MaxxPros [before July 2023].\nVehicles\n* Two ambulances (Mercedes-Benz L 508Ds) for the needs of the armed forces [March 2023].\nAmmunition\n* 7.62mm small arms ammunition [February or March 2022].\n* 60mm Type 63 mortar bombs [before May 2022].\n* 82mm mortar bombs [Since 2022].\n* Different types of ammunition [February or March 2022].\nTraining\n* Training of Ukrainian soldiers as part of British-led Operation Interflex\nFinancial aid\n* €1 million provided to the Ukrainian government on 10 June 2022.\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|\nFighter jets\n* 5 Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard strike fighters [to be delivered].\nHelicopters\n* 2 Mi-171E [February 2024]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|\nAs of October 2024, Australia's military support to Ukraine was worth over AU$1.3 billion in monetary terms.\nArmoured personnel carriers\n* 56 M113AS4 [delivered from June 2022 onwards. 28 more pledged in June 2023].\nMine-resistant ambush protected vehicles\n* 120 Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicles [delivered from April 2022 onwards].\nVehicles\n* 14 Supacat HMT Extenda MK2 special operations vehicles [June 2023].\n* 28 armoured RMMV HX 40M military trucks with 14 trailers [June 2023].\nWatercraft\n* Sentinel 830R rigid hull inflatable boats [announced April 2024].\n* 14 rigid hull inflatable boats valued at A$14 million [announced November 2024].\nTanks\n* 49 M1A1 Abrams [delivered from July 2025].\nTowed artillery\n* 6 155mm M777 [April 2022].\nMan-portable air defence systems (MANPADS)\n* RBS 70 [announced in April 2024]\nAmmunition\n* Joint manufacture of 155mm artillery ammunition with France with Australia supplying the gunpowder [January 2023].\n* 105mm artillery ammunition [2022/2023].\n* \"Ammunition\" [March or April 2022].\n* JDAM-ER guided bombs.\n* Air defence missiles; air-to-ground weapons, including guided weapons; anti-tank weapons; artillery, mortar, cannon, and small arms ammunition [announced in July 2024]\nLoitering munitions\n* 300 DefendTex D40s [August 2022].\n* Corvo PPDS [Since May or June 2023].\nCounter-drone systems\n* In September 2023, it was announced that 160 Slinger counter-drone systems would be provided to Ukraine by Electro Optic Systems. 110 will be mounted on M113 armoured personnel carriers and 50 integrated onto  4x4 light MRAPs.\nUnmanned aerial and unmanned ground systems / Radar systems\n* Part of A$25 million package announced in [March 2022].
