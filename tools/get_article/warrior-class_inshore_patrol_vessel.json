All three vessels are named after historical South African 'warriors' who had a significant impact on the development of the country.\nDevelopment\nSince the Strategic Defence Package of 1999, the South African Navy had always envisaged replacing the ageing Warrior-class strike craft with more modern alternatives, especially when wanting to improve its efficiency in policing the country's extensive maritime exclusive economic zone (1.5 million km). In 2011, it was hoped that nine Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) would be constructed as a like-for-like replacement for the previous strike craft. Practical experience in the rough seas of the Cape had tended to favour the larger OPVs, as well as the vessels having the potential ability to operate helicopters from their flight deck.\nIn 2013 it was announced that the SA Navy had the ambition of domestically constructing three offshore, and a miniumum of six (later reduced to three) inshore patrol vessels, in what would be termed Project Biro. However, as a result of financial implications, in 2018 it was confirmed that only the three Multi-Mission Inshore Patrol Vessels (MMIPVs) would be granted funding, at a cost of R3.6 billion ($288m).\nWhilst the introduction of three highly modern IPVs will play a crucial and immediate role in maritime law enforcement, it has been regretted by analysts that the OPV option was not also financially feasible due to the significant upscaling of capability available.\nIn March 2024 South African Navy Chief Monde Lobese explained. “The Blue Print Force design of the South African Navy requires no less than 15 of these inshore patrol vessels. The South African Navy must still realise the option of the fourth MMIPV and will attempt to source funding for the additional 11 vessels after that. There is still the urgent requirement for an additional 15 offshore patrol vessels as well.”\nIn February 2024, South African Defence Minister Thandi Modise also told Parliament that new offshore patrol vessels will be acquired, while the existing vessels MMIPVs will be maintained.\nDesign and construction\nThe Warrior-class is based upon the highly successful Damen Stan Patrol 6211 and is designed with the patented Sea Axe Hull - the first to operate in South Africa. The straight-edged bow will improve safety and comfort when operating in the rough seas found off South Africa, as well as significantly reducing fuel consumption and emissions. The design of the vessel ensures low sea resistance, high sustained speed in waves and superior sea keeping characteristics. Vertical accelerations are reduced significantly, and bow slamming is almost eliminated, thus notably increasing the safety of the vessel and of the crew.\nThe 62m by 11m vessels, weighing 750 tons, have a range of 2000&nbsp;nm when at an economical 20 knots. The vessels are powered by four Caterpillar 3512C HD/B engines, delivering 5 700&nbsp;kW (7 644) hp and driving four fixed pitch propellers. They will also each have two stabilisers and two bow thrusters. The class has a maximum speed of 26.5 knots and a maximum range of 4000&nbsp;nm.\nEquipped with radar, combat management systems, a forward gun position and various heavy machine guns equipped to the vessel, the class also carry two RHIBs for boarding operations, with the aft deck being designed to accommodate various container arrangements that aid unique mission requirements. Deck layout includes a knuckle boom crane, single point lifting davit rated at 5.7 tons and a single point lifting davit rated at 2 tons. The vessels can accommodate up to 14 non-crew, primarily for boarding or landing parties, and will work closely with the Maritime Reaction Squadron in the law-enforcemant role.\nIn 2018, Damen Shipyards Cape Town (DSCT) secured the order from Armscor for the delivery of three inshore patrol vessels, with an open-ended option for a possible fourth, beating competition from Durban based Southern African Shipyards (SAS) and a Nautic Africa/Austal partnership. In February 2019, DSCT ceremonially laid the keel for the first MMIPV, SAS King Sekhukhune I, and formally delivered the vessel to the SA Navy three years later in May 2022. Delivery dates for the final two vessels are scheduled for June 2023 and September 2024, with the timetable slipping slightly due to COVID-19.\nDSCT has exceeded Project Biro's 60% local content requirements by issuing contracts to a large number of local suppliers and as a result of their work on Project Biro, many of these suppliers are now earmarked for work on Damen projects in and outside of South Africa.\nThe project has created over 300 direct jobs by DSCT, and also supports another 1000 indirect jobs. DSCT states that the project has played an important role in creating skilled employment in South Africa, and has acted as a catalyst for the development of regional supply chains.\nCapabilities and Features\nThe Warrior-class IPVs are multi-role designed and will be employed in a wide range of missions, such as mine counter-measures, deep diving training, search and rescue, submarine torpedo recovery, humanitarian assistance and anti-pollution tasks -  particularly key constabulary roles such as intercepting illegal trafficking, fishing and counter-piracy.\nThe MMIPVs' main armament is the Reutech 20&nbsp;mm Super Rogue remotely controlled gun, with heavy machine guns mounted on the bridge wings. Their primary sensor is the Reutech Radar Systems RTS 3200: a frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar/optronics tracker (FORT) that was previously trialled aboard the frigate SAS Spioenkop. Reutech is also providing the communications system, which will be LINK-ZA compatible, alongside other Communication Intercept and passive Close-In Surveillance systems.\nTheir ability to accommodate at short notice containerised mission modules gives them a true multi-mission capability. Container fittings on the aft deck will be available for fastening on mission equipment. Various layouts are accommodated, including one 20 foot and four 10 foot containers.\nThe vessels will carry one 7m and one 9m rigid-hull inflatable boat for boarding operations.\nOperational Deployment\nSAS King Sekhukhune I was commissioned into service and formally christened at a service at Salisbury Island, Durban Harbour in June 2022. Delivered to the Navy in May 2022 by DSCT, King Sekhukhune I spent the following month working up before moving to Naval Base Durban, the home of the newly formed patrol squadron.\nShips in Class\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#acc; width:150px;\" |Name\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#acc; width:50px;\" |Pennant\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#acc; width:25px;\" |Commissioned\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#acc; width:250px;\" |Notes\n|-\n|\n| P1571\n| 15 June 2022\n|\n|-\n| SAS King Shaka Zulu\n| P1572\n|\n|Delivered 27 October 2023.\n|-\n| SAS Adam Kok\n| P1573\n|\n|Delivered March 2024.\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
