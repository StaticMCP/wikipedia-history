It declared Slovenia's independence and transferred onto it some of the powers of Slovenia previously held by the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, recognised its existing borders as national borders, guaranteed the protection of human rights to all citizens, and also provided special protection to members of minorities, as provided for in inter-state treaties. Together with the Declaration of Independence of Slovenia and several laws by which Slovenia took over the former competences of the federation on its territory, it constitutes the foundation of Slovenian statehood.\nGallery\nFile:Temeljna ustavna listina o samostojnosti in neodvisnosti Republike Slovenije str. 1.jpg|First page of the charter\nFile:Temeljna ustavna listina o samostojnosti in neodvisnosti Republike Slovenije str. 2.jpg|Second page of the charter\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.uradni-list.si/1/objava.jsp?urlid=19911&stevilka=4 Publication of the Charter in the Official Gazette No. 1/1991] (Slovene)\n* [http://www.uradni-list.si/1/content?id=60853 Correction of the Charter in the Official Gazette No. 19/1991] (Slovene)"
