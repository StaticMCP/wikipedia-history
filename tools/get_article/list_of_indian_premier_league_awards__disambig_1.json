The tournament honours players with several awards at the end of each season. These include the Orange Cap, Purple Cap, Maximum Sixes Award, Most Valuable Player and Emerging Player of the Year, among others.\nOrange Cap\nThe Orange Cap, currently known as the Aramco Orange Cap for sponsorship reasons, is presented to the leading run scorer in the Indian Premier League (IPL). It was introduced on 25 April 2008, a week after the start of the inaugural season of the IPL. The batsman with most runs in the tournament during the course of the season would wear the Orange Cap while fielding, with the overall leading run-scorer at the conclusion of the tournament winning the actual Orange Cap award on the day of the season's final. Brendon McCullum became the first player to wear the Orange Cap, and Shaun Marsh became the first winner of the award. So far David Warner has won the cap thrice followed by Chris Gayle and Virat Kohli who have won it twice. Kohli scored the most runs (973) in a single edition of the tournament in the 2016 season.\nThe then IPL chairman and commissioner Lalit Modi said of the initiative, \"Cricket is often remembered and recorded as statistics and not by material distinctions. The DLF Indian Premier League will create a distinction for the best performing batsman, which will be cherished and valued by each player through this initiative. The purpose of this initiative is to be innovative, create another unique piece of history that sets the DLF Indian Premier League apart from the crowd, and to reward outstanding achievements by the players.\"\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Winners\n|-\n!

After the introduction of Orange Cap on 25 April 2008, the IPL announced the introduction of the Purple Cap on 13 May 2008. The bowler with most wickets in the tournament during the course of the season would wear the Purple Cap while fielding, with the overall leading wicket-taker at the conclusion of the tournament winning the actual Purple Cap award on the day of the season's final. In case of a tie, the bowler with superior economy rate would hold the Purple Cap. So far only Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Dwayne Bravo, and Harshal Patel have won the Purple Cap twice. Dwayne Bravo and Harshal Patel scalped 32 wickets in the 2013 Indian Premier League and 2021 Indian Premier League respectively, the most for any bowlers in a single edition of the tournament but Dwayne Bravo remains ahead of Harshal Patel because of better economy rate of the two as per the IPL rules.\nThe then IPL chairman and commissioner Lalit Modi said of the initiative, \"We have seen over the course of the inaugural season of the League so far that bowlers have just as important a role to play in winning T20 matches as batsmen do.\"\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Winners\n|-\n!

A team can be awarded a total of ten points per match, out of which four points are given on the basis of how the team has adhered to the \"spirit of the game\" in the opinion of the umpires. The other three criteria are based on the respect towards to the opposition, the laws of cricket and the umpires. Each of these three criteria represents two points. If a team gets two points in the criterion, its performance is considered as \"good\", whereas getting one or zero points indicates that its performance is \"average\" or \"bad\" respectively.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Winners\n|-\n!
