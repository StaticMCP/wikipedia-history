Comedian and actress Marsha Warfield served as host.\nOverview\nEach show featured several guests who, on the surface, did not seem to have anything in common. Warfield then got her guests to talk about hot-topic issues. The show was light-hearted and Warfield's set included a basketball hoop.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://tv.nytimes.com/show/157718/Marsha-Warfield-Show/overview The Marsha Warfield Show New York Times profile]"
