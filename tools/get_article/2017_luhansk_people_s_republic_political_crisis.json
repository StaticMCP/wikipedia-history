Returning home, some owners faced such a problem that their housing was occupied by unknown persons. So, a resident of the city of Lugansk, Nina Vasilyevna Kvirtsova (according to other sources - Khmelevtsova) found out that you, the Minister of Internal Affairs, live in her house\".\nOn 9 November the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs was evicted in the presence of Igor Plotnitsky, employees of the Prosecutor General's Office and the hostess from the house that he had occupied for three years.\nOn November 10, according to deputy Vitaly Morozov, the People's Council of the LPR demanded the resignation of Interior Minister Igor Kornet.\nChange of power\nOn November 20, 2017, Igor Kornet was removed from the post of head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs by decision of the Leninsky District Court.

Igor Kornet said that Anastasia Shurkayeva, chairman of the TV and radio company, Irina Teitsman, head of Plotnitsky's administration, and Yevhen Seliverstov, head of the government security service, cooperated with the Ukrainian special services, and also accused Teitsman and Seliverstov of staging the 2016 coup. As a result of which, according to him, Prime Minister Gennadiy Tsypkalov was killed, and Vitaly Kiselyov, deputy commander of the People's Militia of the LPR, was sentenced to a long prison term, and the former chairman of the People's Council of the Republic, Aleksey Karyakin, who left for Russia, was put on the wanted list by the Prosecutor General's Office of the LPR.\nIn response to this, Igor Plotnitsky stated that there were no grounds for the arrest of Shurkayeva, Teitsman and Seliverstov, and that the investigation was underway against other persons.
