It consisted of three departments and four directorates. The ministry was initially headed by Gulbrand Lunde until 30 November 1942, and thereafter by Rolf Jørgen Fuglesang\nOne of the departments, the Propaganda Department, was renamed Department for Popular Enlightenment in 1944.\nThe best known directorate was the Norwegian Press Directorate. The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK), the National Gallery of Norway, the Norwegian National Academy of Fine Arts and all other non-scientific museums were subordinate to the Pressedirektoratet.\nThe department was modelled after the Reichskommissariats Hauptabteilung Volksaufklaerung und Propaganda (\"Ministry for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda\"), trying to spread Nazi ideology in Norway.\nDocuments from this department are archived by the National Archival Services of Norway.\nReferences\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080111032745/http://www.arkivverket.no/arkivverket/publikasjoner/nett/handbok-ra/regjering1814/kultur.html Website] of the National Archival Services of Norway\n*"
