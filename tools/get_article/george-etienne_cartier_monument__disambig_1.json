In temperate months it is the site of free weekly drum circle festivals informally called Tam-Tams.\nOn the front, or East side of the monument, George-Étienne Cartier is portrayed standing above four other figures, each one representing a Province that signed the Canadian Confederation of 1867. On the North side of the monument, a woman with a young girl to her right and a young boy to her left is shown holding a sword in her left hand. The boy holds out his bonded wrists in a begging manner as the girl reads a book. This scene represents Legislation. On the South side, in a similar scene to the North side, a woman sits in the middle of a young boy who is holding a globe and a young girl who is reading a book. This represents Cartier's important contributions in education.\nGallery\nSir_George_Etienne_Cartier_Monument,_Montreal.jpg|The George-Étienne Cartier Monument in Mount Royal Park, Montreal\nMonument G E Cartier Est.JPG|The George-Étienne Cartier statue on the monument\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=678,6374456&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL ]\n* [https://artpublic.ville.montreal.qc.ca/en/oeuvre/monument-a-sir-george-etienne-cartier/ Montreal Public Art Bureau - ]\n* [http://grandquebec.com/montreal-touristique/georges-etienne-cartier/ ]\n* [http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/siteofficieldumontroyal/patrimoine-artistique-commemoratif/monument-a-sir-george-etienne-cartier  Le site officiel du Mont-Royal}}]"
