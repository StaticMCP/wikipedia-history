To afford the estate duties of £601,321 (which was then $1,683,698) arising from the death of the 4th Earl, Lord Powis offered the tax collector 199 family heirlooms and sold more than 15,000 acres and gave Powis Castle to the government in order to preserve it (and reduce the tax bill by about £320,000.
