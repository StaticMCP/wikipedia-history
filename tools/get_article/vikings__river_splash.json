It opened in 2007, later than expected because of construction delays. The ride was a river rapids ride which is a common attraction in many theme parks. The ride was in the \"Land of the Vikings\" area of the park. On Tuesday 29 August 2023, Legoland Windsor announced the ride will close permanently on Monday 25 September 2023.\nThe ride featured Lego models, water sprays and cannons along its course. The ride time was about three minutes and was one of the most popular rides in the park when its closure was announced.\nSee also\n* Pirate Falls Treasure Quest\nReferences"
