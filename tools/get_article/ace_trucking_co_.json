      "text": "# Ace Trucking Co.\n\nAce Trucking Co. is a comedy science fiction series that featured in the British comics magazine 2000 AD from 1981 to 1986.  Created by writers John Wagner and Alan Grant and artist Massimo Belardinelli, it followed the misadventures of a space trucking company headed by Ace Garp, a pointy-headed alien who spoke in a kind of futuristic CB radio slang.\nThe title was lifted from Ace Trucking Company, a 1970s improvisational comedy group whose membership had included Fred Willard, Patti Deutsch, Michael Mislove, George Memmoli, and Bill Saluga.\nPlot\nAce was the skipper of the cargo spaceship Speedo Ghost, for much of the series the Ace Trucking Co.'s only ship. His crew included his huge 'biffo' (both bodyguard and security) GBH, who believed himself to be dead, Feek the Freek, a skeletal being who acted as the ship's engineer, and the sarcastic ship's computer Ghost. Joining the crew later in the run was Chiefy the Pig-Rat, a small rodent-like creature that became Feek's best friend and missed no opportunity to insult Ace.\nIn later stories, the crew was also joined by a duplicate of Ace himself. The reason for this is that, tired of the series, the creators killed off Ace by having him believe that he was suffering a fatal disease, causing him to commit suicide by flying into a star. However, the popularity of the series with 2000 AD's readers caused it to be revived, the explanation being that Ace passed through a dimensional rift in the star, and ended up being discovered by his counterpart in another universe, but not before a brief detour in the offices of Tharg the Mighty in a drawer filled with other characters that had been killed off over time. Technically, the second Ace is the 'real' one from the earlier stories.\nOther recurring characters were Jago Kain, the human boss of Ace's business rival Yellow Line, Cap'n Evil Blood, a space pirate who was always trying to kill Garp, Ace-hating officers Kroxley and Zagger of the Galactic Police and Fatty Arkl, a rotund alien who ended up as the skipper of Ace's second ship (Old Peart The Third).\nThe character's official final story \"The Garpetbagger\" ended with his companions GBH and Feek the Freek ordering Ace to sell up and move on, quipping that he \"outlived his welcome a long time ago\".\nIn 1988, a one-off mini-story was produced for a 2000 AD annual which featured the original Ace returning to his own universe only to find that Feek has taken over the business and GBH has become his second in command. Ace loses his temper and vandalises a bar owned by Feek which lands him in prison, vowing to gain revenge at some point \"in the near future\". Despite this, Ace Trucking Co would not make a reappearance in 2000 AD until 2015, when the eight-page strip ''Star's Truck'', by Eddie Robson and Nick Dyer, was published in that year's Sci-Fi Special.\nCreators\nThe main artist for the series' run was Massimo Belardinelli, although Ian Gibson and Alberto Giolitti also contributed.\nGrant and Wagner became tired of writing the series and made several attempts to end it, with one series closing with the entire crew in prison, but reader demand kept bringing it back. The later stories show clear signs of the writers' annoyance at having to keep going on a series they had lost interest in - Ace started out as a smart and resourceful character, but ended up a greedy, dim-witted buffoon disliked even by his own crew.\nPublication\n*Ace Trucking Co.
