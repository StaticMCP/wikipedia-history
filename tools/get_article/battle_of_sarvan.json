Defeated after the Battle of Yalama, the leader of the anti-revolutionary group, Gachag Mayil, discussed ending the resistance. But Mayil's son Ibrahim, who served in the National Army of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, objected to this, so the place for the second battle was chosen. This time, the rails were dismantled at Sarvan station in Devechi (now Shabran). Around noon, the train carrying the Red Army arrived, and thanks to the dismantled rails, erected barricades and armed residents, was stopped. At the same time, an appeal was made from the train through a loudspeaker:\nThe person who appealed to the militants from the train was Hamdulla Afandi Afandizadeh's cousin, Ibrahim's schoolmate and Mir Jafar Baghirov's foster brother, Gazanfar Musabekov. After Musabeyov's appeal, the shooting stopped and Musabeyov got off the train and began to speak:\nAfter  Musabekov returned to the train, Ibrahim Bey opened fire on the train and a fight began. The Bolsheviks, firing machine guns, were able to suppress the local population, who attacked in a scattered manner. Mayil, who led the group, saw that they were defeated and retreated to Babadag with the survivors.\nSee also\n* Battle of Yalama\nReferences"
