It is located on the westerly point of Battle Island,  east-northeast from Lamb Island Light.\nIt was built as a white light, visible for  in  clear weather.  When built, it operated as a bright flash, four-second interval, bright flash, four-second interval, and then bright flash, 16-second interval, with a concurrent lower-strength light operating at 12-seconds constant/ 12 seconds eclipsed.  Its fog horn (originally referred to as a \"fog diaphone\") blasted for 3½ seconds and was then silent for 26½ seconds.\nThe lighthouse was rebuilt in 1915–16 in response to increased demand from local wood pulp carriers and commercial fishing boats.\nSee also\n* List of lighthouses in Ontario\n*List of lighthouses in Canada\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/aids/home Aids to Navigation] Canadian Coast Guard"
