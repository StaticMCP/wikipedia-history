In the late 19th century there was increased competition among the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom for influence and control in the Pacific region, which was a strategic location for naval bases. The Second Samoan Civil War occurred between 1898 and 1899 because of conflicts among high-ranking Samoan chiefs and the influence of Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom for control over the Samoan islands. The Tripartite Convention of 1899 ended the Second Samoan Civil War and was signed between the United States, the United Kingdom, and the German Empire partitioning the Samoan islands under German and U.S. control. The Samoan Islands had also experienced political instability and conflict among rival chiefs. U.S. representatives in the region engaged with local chiefs to persuade them of the benefits of ceding the territory to the U.S. The chiefs agreed and the treaty was formally signed on April 17, 1900, in the Gagamoe area in Pago Pago. The first American flag was raised later that same day on Sogelau Hill in Fagatogo. It was ratified by the United States Congress by the Ratification Act of 1929 officially incorporating Tutuila into what is now American Samoa. This treaty marked the beginning of American Samoa as a U.S. territory. Initially, the U.S. Navy governed the island for over fifty years before the territory became self-governing. American Samoa remains an unincorporated territory of the United States.\nSamoa’s earliest inhabitants arrived as early as 1500 BC, and its history includes notable events such as the arrival of missionary John Williams in the 1830s and significant interactions with European and American traders. The involvement of foreign powers often led to conflicts and political changes, culminating in the treaties that shaped modern American Samoa.\nThe matai (local chiefs) of Tutuila ceded the island to the United States, followed by Manu’a in 1904 and Swain Island in 1925 (which was not included in the original treaties cession of Tutuila and Manu’a but was privately owned for decades and annexed by the United States and incorporated into American Samoa ratified by the Swains Island Act of 1925). Initially, the U.S. Navy governed the American Samoa territory until 1951, when authority was transferred to the Department of the Interior. American Samoa adopted its own constitution in 1967, which was approved by the Secretary of the Interior, and held its first constitutional elections in 1977. Unlike citizens of other U.S. territories, American Samoans are U.S. nationals but do not vote in federal elections or pay federal taxes.\nSee also\n* Treaty of Cession of Manu'a\n* Tripartite Convention\n* History of American Samoa\nReferences\nExternal links\n* American Samoa Ceded to the U.S. | Mystic Stamp Discovery Center. 17 Apr. 2022, https://info.mysticstamp.com/american-samoa-ceded-to-the-u-s_tdih/\n* American Samoa | U.S. Department of the Interior. 23 Mar. 2023, https://www.doi.gov/oia/islands/american-samoa\n* “Cession of Tutuila and Aunu’u.” American Samoa Bar Association, 2 Mar. 2012, [https://asbar.org/cession-of-tutuila-and-aunuu/. https://asbar.org/cession-of-tutuila-and-aunuu/.]\n* Cover of the Tutuila Deed of Cession. 1 Pg.
