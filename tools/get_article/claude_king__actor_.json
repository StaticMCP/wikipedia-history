With his distinctive wavy hair, King appeared on both stage and screen. He served his country, Great Britain, in World War I in Field Artillery, reaching the rank of Major and surviving the war. He began his stage career in his native country, before emigrating to the US. In 1919, he appeared on Broadway in support of Ethel Barrymore in the play Declassee.\nFilm\nAfter gravitating to silent films, King had a key role in Tod Browning's lost silent masterpiece London After Midnight (1927), starring alongside Lon Chaney.
