      "text": "# Beecraft Queen Bee\n\n__NOTOC__\nThe Beecraft Queen Bee was an American V-tailed four-seat cabin monoplane, designed and built by Bee Aviation Associates (Beecraft).\nDevelopment\nThe Queen Bee was an all-metal cantilever low-wing monoplane powered by a Lycoming O-320-A1A flat-four piston engine. It had a V-tail and an electrically retractable tricycle landing gear. The canopy shared a similar shape to the Ryan Navion. The wings were outfitted with fiberglass tip tanks. A 180&nbsp;hp Lycoming O-360-A-1-A was planned as an optional engine.\nOnly a prototype was built and the aircraft did not enter production. The Queen Bee prototype was destroyed when the original San Diego Aerospace Museum burned down in 1978.\nSpecifications\nReferences\nNotes\n}}\nBibliography\n*\n*"
