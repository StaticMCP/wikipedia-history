Diakonoff estimated the population of Urartu as having \"certainly exceeded one million and may have reached two or three million\". He also found 6 to 7 million a \"plausible figure.\" For around 585 BC, John M. Douglas proposed an approximate population of 3 million for Urartu and 2 million for Proto-Armenians.\nRuben L. Manaseryan estimated the population of the short-lived empire of Tigranes the Great () at 10 million. Sedrak Krkyasharyan estimated over 10.5 million people in his empire, including around 4 million Armenians. Earlier estimates by non-historians such as Jacques de Morgan, Isaac Don Levine and Bodil Biørn put it considerably higher, at 25 and 30 million. Hakob Manandian posited that the population of Armenia during the reigns of Artaxias I and Tigranes II was \"much larger than that of later centuries.\"\nAgathangelos wrote that during the Christianization of Armenia in the early fourth century more than 4,000,000 men, women and children and more than 150,000 soldiers (a total of 4,150,000) were baptized by Gregory the Illuminator. Malachia Ormanian and Antranig Chalabian accepted the figure, while Edmond Schütz found the figure for the population of Greater Armenia “obviously exaggerated.” Suren Yeremian proposed 4 million as the population of both Arsacid Armenia and of Armenians.\nMedieval\nBased on tax records, Arsen Shahinyan estimated the population of Arminiya, an administrative unit of the Abbasid Caliphate, in the 8th and 9th centuries at 1.5 million, including 750,000 in Arminiya I (Greater Armenia), around 650,000 in Arminiya II (Arran, i.e. Caucasian Albania), and around 100,000 in Arminiya III (Jurzan, i.e. Eastern Georgia).\nSerob Poghosyan estimated Armenia's population in the 9th–11th centuries, when much of it was ruled by the Bagratids, at 5 to 6 million. Kersam Aharonian proposed at least six million by the early 1000s, prior to the Seljuk invasions.\nMikayel Malkhasyan estimated Vaspurakan's population in the same period at no less than a million people.\nTadevos Hakobyan suggested that Armenia's population reached 5 to 6 million only in the 13th century, prior to the Mongol invasion, when he estimated 4.5 million people in rural areas and around 500,000 in cities. Others have estimated Armenia's population in the mid-13th century at 4 million. Based on tax records, Manandian estimated the combined population of eastern Armenia, Kars and eastern Georgia (Kartli and Kakheti) in the mid-13th century at 4 to 5 million.Manandian, Hakob.

In 1891, Telfer reported to the Royal Society of Arts that \"most authorities\" appear to agree that the total Armenian population worldwide amounts to around 5 million, with most \"scattered in their own land and in adjoining territories\" and nearly half a million \"settled in distant parts.\"\nIn 1891 Élisée Reclus wrote that while \"usually estimated at three and even four millions,\" the total number of Armenians \"would seem scarcely to exceed two millions.\" He estimated the \"probable\" number of Armenians as follows: 840,000 in Caucasia and European Russia, 760,000 in Asiatic Turkey, and 250,000 in European Turkey, 150,000 in Persia, and 60,000 elsewhere, with the total at 2,060,000. He estimated no less than 200,000 Armenians in Constantinople and noted that Tiflis held the second largest Armenian population of any city.\nAt the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions, Armenian activist  claimed that there were 5.1 million Armenians in total, including 80,000 Catholics and 20,000 Protestants.\nIn his 1896 book Story of Turkey and Armenia Reverend James Wilson Pierce estimated 2.4 million Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, 1.25 million in the Russian Empire, 150,000 in Persia, 100,000 in Europe and 5,000 in the United States.\nAdrian Fortescue wrote in 1916: \"There are said to be about three and a half or four million Armenians in the world—1,300,000 in Turkey, 1,200,000 in Russia, 50,000 in Persia, and the rest dispersed throughout the world. Of these about three quarters belong to the Monophysite (\"Gregorian\") Church.\"\nOttoman Empire\nRussian Empire\nAccording to the Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia, what is now Armenia (historically known as Eastern Armenia) that came under Russian rule in 1828, had a population of 161,700 in 1831, which rose to reach 1.01 million by 1913.\nAccording to the Russian Empire Census of 1897, there were 1,173,096 native speakers of Armenian in the empire. The religious statistics indicated there to be 1,179,241 Armenian Apostolics and 38,840 Catholic Armenians, amounting to a total of 1,218,081.\nEstimates by John Foster Fraser (1907) and Richard G. Hovannisian (2005) put the number of Armenians within the Russian Empire in the early 20th century at around 2 million. According to official estimates for 1916, published in the Kavkazskiy kalendar, 1,859,663 Armenians lived in Russia's Caucasus Viceroyalty alone.\n20th century\n1911\nMalachia Ormanian, a scholar and former Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople, estimated the population of Christian Armenians by the dioceses of the Armenian Apostolic Church in his 1911 book The Church of Armenia. It is the most detailed population distribution estimates available prior to the Armenian genocide. Robert Hewsen wrote that \"Ormanian's figures appear moderate and reasonable, although this does not necessarily make them precise.\" Levon Marashlian notes that \"the purpose of Ormanian's book was not to provide comprehensive population statistics\" and that \"his numbers for [Armenian] Protestants and Catholics may be even more incomplete\" than for Armenian Apostolics.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Of the total 3,004,000 Armenians, 817,873 were refugees from Turkey \"based upon information furnished by the British Embassy, Constantinople, and by the agents of the Near East Relief Society, in 1921. The total given does not include the able-bodied Armenians, who are retained by the Kemalists, nor the women and children,—approximately 95,000,—according to the League of Nations-who have been forced to embrace Islam.\"\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
