The First Battle of El Alamein and the Battle of Alam el Halfa had prevented the Axis from advancing further into Egypt.\nThe Allied victory was the beginning of the end of the Western Desert Campaign, eliminating the Axis threat to Egypt, the Suez Canal and the Middle Eastern and Persian oil fields. The battle revived the morale of the Allies, being the first big success against the Axis since Operation Crusader in late 1941. The end of the battle coincided with the Allied invasion of French North Africa in Operation Torch on 8 November, which opened a second front in North Africa.\nHigh-level orders of battle\nAllies\nMiddle East Command: Lieutenant-General Harold Alexander\nBritish Eighth Army\nLieutenant-General Sir Bernard Law Montgomery\n: Northern sector\n:: British XXX Corps (Lieutenant-General Oliver Leese)\n::: Australian 9th Division (Major-General Leslie Morshead)\n::: British 51st (Highland) Infantry Division (Major-General Douglas Wimberley)\n::: New Zealand 2nd Division (Lieutenant-General Bernard Freyberg)\n::: South African 1st Infantry Division (Major-General Dan Pienaar)\n::: Indian 4th Infantry Division (Major-General Francis Tuker)\n: Southern sector\n:: British XIII Corps (Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks)\n::: British 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division (Major-General John Nichols)\n::: British 44th (Home Counties) Infantry Division (Major-General Ivor Hughes)\n::: British 7th Armoured Division (Major-General John Harding)\n: Reserve\n:: British X Corps (Lieutenant-General Herbert Lumsden)\n::: British 1st Armoured Division (Major-General Raymond Briggs)\n::: British 10th Armoured Division (Major-General Alexander Gatehouse)\n::: British 8th Armoured Division (Major-General Charles Henry Gairdner)\nAxis\nDelegazione Africa Settentrionale (Delease): ''Generale di Corpo D' Armata Curio Barbasetti\nPanzerarmee Afrika\nGeneralfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel\n: Deutsches Afrika Korps\n: Generalleutnant Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma\n:: 90th Light Afrika Division (Generalmajor Theodor Graf von Sponeck)\n:: 15th Panzer Division (Generalmajor Gustav von Vaerst)\n:: 21st Panzer Division (Generalmajor Heinz von Randow)\n: Italian XXI Army Corps\n: Generale di Corpo d'Armata Enea Navarini; Generale di Divisione Alessandro Gloria }}\n:: 102nd Motorised Division \"Trento\" (Generale di Brigata Giorgio Masina)\n:: 25th Infantry Division \"Bologna\" (Generale di Divisione Alessandro Gloria)\n: Italian XX Army Corps\n: Generale di Divisione Giuseppe De Stefanis\n:: 101st Motorised Division \"Trieste\" (Generale di Divisione Francesco La Ferla)\n:: 164th Light Africa Division (Generalleutnant Carl-Hans Lungershausen)\n:: 133rd Armoured Division \"Littorio\" (Generale di Divisione Gervasio Bitossi)\n:: 132nd Armoured Division \"Ariete\" (Generale di Divisione Francesco Antonio Arena)\n: Italian X Army Corps\n: Generale di Divisione Federico Ferrari Orsi KIA 18 Oct\n: Generale di Divisione Enrico Frattini thru 26 Oct\n: Generale di Divisione Edoardo Nebbia from 27 Oct, POW 7 Nov\n:: 27th Infantry Division \"Brescia\" (Generale di Divisione Brunetto Brunetti)\n:: Ramcke Parachute Brigade (Generalmajor Hermann-Bernhard Ramcke)\n:: 185th Infantry Division \"Folgore\" (Generale di Divisione Enrico Frattini)\n:: 17th Infantry Division \"Pavia\" (Generale di Divisione Nazzareno Scattaglia)\n: Reserve\n:: 16th Motorised Division \"Pistoia\" (Generale di Divisione Giuseppe Falugi)\n:: 136th Armoured Division \"Giovani Fascisti\" (Generale di Divisione'' Ismaele Di Nisio)\nAllies\nMiddle East Command\nLieutenant-General Harold Alexander\nBritish Eighth Army\nLieutenant-General Sir Bernard Law Montgomery\nUnder direct Army command\n: 1st Army Tank Brigade (Brigadier Thomas Price)\n:: 42nd Royal Tank Regiment\n:: 44th Royal Tank Regiment\n: 1st Armoured Brigade (reforming) (Brigadier G.N.
