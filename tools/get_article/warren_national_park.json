Some of these trees were used to act as fire lookout towers built during the 1930s and 1940s. The  Dave Evans Bicentennial Tree is situated within the park and was pegged in 1988 as part of Australia's bicentennial celebrations. This is one of three trees found around Pemberton that tourists are able to climb.\nThe Warren River flows through the park along with many smaller creeks and gullies. The river is plentiful in trout and marron, which can be caught in season.\nSee also\n* Protected areas of Western Australia\nReferences"
