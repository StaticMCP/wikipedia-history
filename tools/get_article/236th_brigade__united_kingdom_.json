In June the headquarters of 25th Division and its three infantry brigades returned to the United Kingdom with battalions reduced to training cadres, in order to organise a new fighting force. After 75th Bde was converted into 236th Bde, a new 75th Bde HQ was organised, and 25th Division returned to France to fight in the final battles of the Hundred Days Offensive.\n236th Bde left 25th Division on 9 September 1918 at Mytchett Camp, Aldershot. It embarked at Dundee and Glasgow on 15 October for service in North Russia, and Bde HQ and the leading elements disembarked at Murmansk on 27 November.\nOrder of battle\n236th Bde was constituted as follows:\nCommander: Brig-Gen M.N. Turner\n* 17th (Service) Battalion (1st City), King's (Liverpool) Regiment (previously with 30th Division; reduced to training cadre 14 May 1918 and joined 75th Bde at Boulogne on 30 June for return to UK)\n* 6th (Service) Battalion, Green Howards (previously with 11th (Northern) Division; reduced to training cadre 14 May 1918 and joined 75th Bde at Boulogne on 30 June for return to UK; absorbed newly formed 19th Battalion Green Howards during August)\n* 13th (Service) Battalion, Green Howards (previously with 40th Division; reduced to training cadre 6 May 1918 and joined 75th Bde at Boulogne on 30 June for return to UK; absorbed newly formed 19th Battalion Green Howards during August)\n* 11th (Service) Battalion (1st South Down), Royal Sussex Regiment (previously with 39th Division; reduced to training cadre 23 May 1918 and joined 75th Bde at Boulogne on 30 June for return to UK; absorbed newly formed 13th Battalion, Royal West Kent Regiment during July)\n* 236th Trench Mortar  Battery\n* 236th Signal Section\nIt is reported that once in Russia the brigade was joined by 2/7th Battalion Durham Light Infantry, a Second-Line Territorial Force battalion which had converted to a Garrison Guard battalion in September and embarked separately for Arkhangelsk on 7 October.\nIn Russia, 75th Bde came under the orders of Maj-Gen Edmund Ironside in command of the Allied intervention force. The brigade remained in North Russia until 1919 (17th King's returned home in September 1919).\nNotes\nReferences\n* Maj A.F.
