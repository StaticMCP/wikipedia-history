It was contested between a World XI team and Pakistan across three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. Pakistan won the series 2–1.\nSouth Africa's Faf du Plessis captained the World XI team, with Sarfaraz Ahmed leading Pakistan. Ten of the players in the Pakistan squad had not previously played in an international match at home. The World XI side arrived in Lahore a day before the first fixture under high security. The cup was named in commemoration of Pakistan's 70th year of independence.\nThe International Cricket Council (ICC) appointed Richie Richardson as the match referee for the fixtures, the first time the ICC has sent an official to oversee cricket matches in Pakistan since 2009. Aleem Dar, Ahsan Raza, Ahmed Shahab and Shozab Raza were appointed as the on-field umpires. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) introduced the #CricketKiHalalala hashtag for the series.\nThe PCB spent an estimated $3 million to host the three matches, with players on the World XI team being paid approximately $100,000 each. The ICC contributed more than $1 million towards security costs. While attendance for the first two matches were as high as 90%, this was down on the crowd numbers for the final of the 2017 Pakistan Super League. Higher ticket pricing was to blame for the drop in attendance, with some tickets being given to local schools as a result. The ICC and PCB looked at the possibility for further World XI tours to Pakistan in the next two years, with the priority for more Full Member sides to tour.\nFollowing the conclusion of the series, Faf du Plessis said how much it meant for the people of Pakistan and that it hopefully will bring cricket back to the country. Sarfraz Ahmed said that he was thankful to the World XI team and that \"I expect these players to return back to Pakistan with full squads to play a full Test series\". The ICC congratulated Pakistan for hosting the tournament, with the aim to get bilateral international cricket returning to Pakistan. The following month, the Sri Lanka cricket team played a T20I in Lahore against Pakistan.\nSquads\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders \" style=\"text-align:left; margin:auto\"\n!colspan=2|T20Is\n|-\n!\n!World XI\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|\n* Sarfaraz Ahmed (c, wk)\n* Fakhar Zaman\n* Ahmed Shehzad\n* Babar Azam\n* Shoaib Malik\n* Umar Amin\n* Imad Wasim\n* Shadab Khan\n* Mohammad Nawaz\n* Faheem Ashraf\n* Hasan Ali\n* Aamer Yamin\n* Mohammad Amir\n* Rumman Raees\n* Usman Khan\n* Sohail Khan\n|\n* Faf du Plessis (c)\n* Hashim Amla\n* Samuel Badree\n* George Bailey\n* Paul Collingwood\n* Ben Cutting\n* Grant Elliott\n* Tamim Iqbal\n* David Miller\n* Morné Morkel\n* Tim Paine (wk)\n* Thisara Perera\n* Imran Tahir\n* Daren Sammy\n|}\nT20I series\n1st T20I\n| team2 = World XI\n| score1 = 197/5 (20 overs)\n| runs1 = Babar Azam 86 (52)\n| wickets1 = Thisara Perera 2/51 (4 overs)\n| score2 = 177/7 (20 overs)\n| runs2 = Daren Sammy 29* (16)\n| wickets2 = Sohail Khan 2/28 (4 overs)\n| result = Pakistan won by 20 runs\n| report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/1117821.html Scorecard]\n| venue = Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore\n| umpires = Aleem Dar (Pak) and Ahsan Raza (Pak)\n| motm = Babar Azam (Pak)\n| toss = World XI won the toss and elected to field.\n| rain =\n| notes = Faheem Ashraf (Pak) made his T20I debut.\n}}\n2nd T20I\n| team2 = World XI\n| score1 = 174/6 (20 overs)\n| runs1 = Babar Azam 45 (38)\n| wickets1 = Thisara Perera 2/23 (3 overs)\n| score2 = 175/3 (19.5 overs)\n| runs2 = Hashim Amla 72* (55)\n| wickets2 = Mohammad Nawaz 1/25 (3 overs)\n| result = World XI won by 7 wickets\n| report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/1117822.html Scorecard]\n| venue = Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore\n| umpires = Shozab Raza (Pak) and Ahmed Shahab (Pak)\n| motm = Thisara Perera (World XI)\n| toss = Pakistan won the toss and elected to bat.\n| rain =\n| notes = This was the first defeat for Pakistan in a T20I in Pakistan.\n* Shoaib Malik (Pak) became the highest run-scorer in T20Is for Pakistan.\n}}\n3rd T20I\n| team2 = World XI\n| score1 = 183/4 (20 Overs)\n| runs1 = Ahmed Shehzad 89 (55)\n| wickets1 = Thisara Perera 2/37 (4 overs)\n| score2 = 150/8 (20 overs)\n| runs2 = Thisara Perera 32 (13)\n| wickets2 = Hasan Ali 2/28 (4 overs)\n| result = Pakistan won by 33 runs\n| report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/1117824.html Scorecard]\n| venue = Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore\n| umpires = Ahsan Raza (Pak) and Shozab Raza (Pak)\n| motm = Ahmed Shehzad (Pak)\n| toss = World XI won the toss and elected to field.\n| rain =\n| notes =\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/_/id/18002/season/2017/independence-cup-2017-18/ Series home at ESPN Cricinfo]"
