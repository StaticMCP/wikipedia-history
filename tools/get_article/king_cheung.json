He was awarded Best New Director at the 29th Hong Kong Film Awards and named Artist of the Year in 2009 by the Hong Kong Arts Development Council.\nBiography\nCheung was born in Hong Kong and grew up in the Tsuen Wan district.

After secondary school, he studied music, film, and philosophy at Brooklyn College, City University of New York, earning a bachelor's degree in film.\nKnown for his ability to explore social issues from a humanistic perspective, Cheung's works often draw significant public attention. In 2001, his graduation project Farewell Hong Kong, themed around the handover of Hong Kong, was selected for competition at the Sundance Film Festival. In 2005, his script Tin Shui Wai won the HAF Award of Hong Kong Asia Film Financing Forum and was later adapted by director Ann Hui into the film Night and Fog (2009).\nIn 2008, his feature documentary ''All's Right With The World was nominated for the Humanitarian Award for Documentaries at the Hong Kong International Film Festival.
