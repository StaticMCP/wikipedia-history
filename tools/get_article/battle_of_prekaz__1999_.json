A group of about 10 KLA fighters quickly mobilized to resist the attack, engaging in close-range combat. Yugoslav forces engaged in close combat with the KLA and were overwhelming them with their artillery. KLA reinforcements from nearby areas, including the Lushtaku neighborhood in Prekaz, arrived and launched a counterattack against Yugoslav forces. This forced the Yugoslav forces to retreat back toward Polac, which was abandoned.\nReferences"
