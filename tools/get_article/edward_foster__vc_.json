On 27 July 1915, during the First World War, he enlisted in the 13th Battalion (Wandsworth) East Surrey Regiment, British Army, and went to France with the battalion in June 1916.\nFoster was 31 years old, and a corporal in the 13th East Surreys, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.\nOn 24 April 1917 at Villers-Plouich, Nord, France, during an attack, the advance was held up in a portion of the village by two machine-guns which were entrenched and strongly covered by wire entanglements. Corporal Foster, who was in charge of two Lewis guns, succeeded in entering the trench and engaging the enemy guns. One of the Lewis guns was lost, but the corporal rushed forward, bombed the enemy and recovered the gun. Then, getting his two guns into action, he killed the enemy gun team and captured their guns.\nFoster was also awarded the Médaille Militaire by France.\nFoster was discharged from the Army in October 1918 and returned to work with Wandsworth Council. The council, in recognition of his gallant record, promoted him to Dusting Inspector in which capacity he continued to work for twenty-six years. He died suddenly at the age of 60 on 22 January 1946. He is buried in Streatham Cemetery in London where a headstone was erected on his grave in 1997.\nHis Victoria Cross and other medals were sold by Sotheby's on 30 June 1988 for £11,000. His VC is now on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.\nA footpath in King George's Park – Foster's Way – is named in Foster's honour.\nHonours\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto;\"\n|- style=\"background:silver;\" align=\"center\"\n|Ribbon || Description || Notes\n|-\n| || Victoria Cross (VC) ||\n* 27 June 1917.\n|-\n| || British War Medal ||\n* 26 July 1919.\n|-\n| || World War I Victory Medal ||\n* 1 September 1919.\n|-\n| || King George VI Coronation Medal ||\n* 12 May 1937.\n* Qualified as a Victoria Cross Recipient.\n|-\n| || Médaille militaire ||\n* 13 July 1917.\n* Awarded by the 3rd French Republic.\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20041027220901/http://www.homeusers.prestel.co.uk/stewart/lonsouth.htm Location of grave and VC medal] (South London)"
