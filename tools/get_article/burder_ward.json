Burder Ward is one of the seven wards in Wajir South Constituency of Wajir County. It is also one of the most neglected, underdeveloped, and unchanged wards in Wajir South since its creation. A mega failure by both successive members of Parliament and the county governments. Despite the billions of devolved funds pumped into Wajir County over the years, water remains a scarce resource for the residents of the ward. The main water source for the residents for both domestic and livestock is water pans, which dry up during the dry season. The Ward has over 18 settlements and locations.\nBurder ward lies between latitudes 1◦ 30’N and 0◦ 60’N and between longitudes 39◦ 30’E and 41◦ E. It borders Dif ward  to the East; Lagboqol south to the South, and Ibrahim ure ward to the North. Burder ward is a featureless plain and lies between 150 meters and 460 meters above sea level and along latitude 1°45'N and longitude 40°4'E. Its altitude is 244&nbsp;m (801&nbsp;ft).\nThe region's population is largely pastoralist and pre-dominantly Somali. About 80-90% of the people depend largely on livestock for their livelihood. The main form of land use is nomadic pastoralism, which is the most efficient method of exploiting the range lands.\nMembers of County Assembly\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Elections\n!MCA\n!Party\n!Notes\n|-\n|2013|| Adan Kadid || ODM||\nOrange Democratic Movement\n|-\n|2017|| Abdullahi Akhwan|| JP||\nJubilee Party\n|-\n|2022|| Abdirashid Hussein Tajir || UDA||\nUnited Democratic Alliance\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
