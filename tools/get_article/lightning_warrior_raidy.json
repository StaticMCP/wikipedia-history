At various times throughout the game, the player can either instigate or fall victim of various erotic scenes themed after yuri eroticism.\nPlot\nRaidy, a wandering sword fighter roaming the land of Else, stops at the small village of Sadd to resupply. When she arrived, she notes as though she arrived at a grave town due to only elderly living in the area. The locals tell her all the youth, especially young women have all been abducted from the village and imprisoned by the monsters in the tower nearby. Raidy decided to help the people and investigates the tower to rescue the captives.\nCharacters\n* : The protagonist of the game, a warrior with the mysterious power to control lightning.\nDevelopment and release\nThe game was first released in Japan under the title  on September 20, 1994 for MS-DOS. A version for FM Towns and PC-9821 was released on October 7 of the same year, and a Windows 3.1 edition came out on August 23, 1996.\nThe game was remade for Windows XP with the title  on August 12, 2005.

At that time, the release was planned for \"mid- to late 2007\", but English production didn't finish until May 13, 2008, when G-Collections announced that the game had hit \"golden master\" status. Even before Lightning Warrior Raidy was available for sale, G-Collections had already revealed their plans to translate the sequel, Lightning Warrior Raidy II.\nReception\nIn a review for Destructoid, Karen Gellender wrote: \"So I'm probably not a good judge of this sort of thing, but my guess is that LWR is neither good hentai, or a particularly good dungeon crawler.... However, I couldn't in good conscience say that the title isn't entertaining. While it's very basic (think Etrian Odyssey without the mapping features), the actual gameplay is solid enough, and the artwork is attractive\".\nAdaptations\nA manga adaptation by Kazuma Sonsei was released in 2014.\nSequel\nReferences\nExternal links\n* ZyX page: [http://www.zyx-game.co.jp/newsoft/raidy/index.html Windows 3.1 version], [http://www.zyx-game.co.jp/newsoft/raidy1r/index.html Windows 98 version]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130120214325/http://www.g-collections.com/lightning-warrior-raidy.html G-Collections' product page]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120716113147/http://jastusa.com/raidy/ JAST USA page]\n* [http://www.zyx-game.co.jp/newsoft/raidy/index.html ZyX's product page]\n*\n* MobyGames page: [http://www.mobygames.com/game/lightning-warrior-raidy DOS version] and [http://www.mobygames.com/game/ikazuchi-no-senshi-raidi Windows 98 version]\nja:雷の戦士ライディ"
