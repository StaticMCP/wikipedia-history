At the age of five she went with her parents to Hamburg, where she remained until her father's death in 1861. She then moved to Berlin with her mother, with whom she lived in quiet seclusion. After the latter's death in the summer of 1878, she settled in Copenhagen. She died from a heart attack soon after her arrival.\nDespite having never attended a public school or received regular instruction, Warrens devoted herself to Swedish literature and Norse mythology, translating into German the northern folk-songs in the original metres. A volume of her original poems appeared in 1873.\nPublications\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\n}}"
