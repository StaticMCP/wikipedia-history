It was suppressed by the Concordat of 1801, its territory being assigned to the diocese of Grenoble.David M, Cheney, Catholic-Hierarchy.org, [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dd510.html \"Die (Diocese)\".] The seat of the bishop was located in the Cathedral of the Assumption in Die.\nHistory\nSituated on the River Drôme, Die was one of the nineteen principal towns of the tribe of the Vocontii.  It was made a Roman colony by the Emperor Augustus in the 20s B.C.\nNo episcopal list exists for the diocese of Die. There is no myth, legend, or tradition with regard to the bringing of Christianity to the area or the foundation of the diocese. Die first appears in the record when Bishop Nicasius attended the Council of Nicaea in 325.\nThe Cathedral of Die was dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary.  The Cathedral Chapter had two dignities, the Dean and the Sacristan, and ten other Canons.  In the thirteenth century the diocese was divided for administrative purposes into four Archpresbyteries:  the Archpriest of Die, the Archpriest of Trivilis (Trièves), the Archpriest of Deserto, the Archpriest of Crista. There was a Collegiate Church at Crest (Crista) dedicated to Saint-Sauveur, which had a Provost, a Cantor, and six Canons.\nAfter the eleventh century the Diocese of Die, long disputed between the metropolitans of Vienne and Arles, became suffragan of the archbishopric of Vienne. On 28 March 1165 Pope Alexander III confirmed by papal bull the grant to the Church of Die on the part of Arnaud de Crest and Guillaume of Poitiers of the abbeys of S. Marcel de Die, Saint-Medard, Saint-Croix, Saint Julien-de-Guiniaise, Leoncel, and Saou.  The bull also confirms the possession of the entire city of Die and nine castle-towns including Crista.\nUnion of diocese of Die and diocese of Valence\nBy Papal Bull of 25 September 1275, in order to strengthen the Church of Valence in its struggle with the House of Poitiers, Gregory X united the Diocese of Die with that of Valence. Five days later, on 30 September,  Pope Gregory wrote to Abbot Amadeus of Roussillon, informing him that he had been named Bishop of Valence in succession to Bishop Guy, who had died in 1272.  It was no accident that Amadeus of Roussillon was the nephew of Amadeus of Geneva, Bishop of Die.  Amadeus of Roussillon was present at the bedside of his uncle when he made his Testament on 21 January 1276.  Bishop Amadeus of Die died on 22 October 1276, and his nephew Amadeus of Roussillon became Bishop of Valence and Die.\nDiocese of Die revived\nThis union, which lasted four centuries, was unfortunate for the Church in Die. The Huguenot sect, derived from the Calvinism of Geneva, had taken firm hold in the Dauphiné, and in particular in the Alpine valleys.  In order to combat Protestantism, therefore, King Louis XIV, published the Edict of Fontainebleau on 22 October 1685, revoking the special rights granted to Protestants in France in the Edict of Nantes.   King Louis revived the diocese of Die and appointed a Bishop of Die in 1687.  From the point of view of the Roman Catholic Church, however, the union of the two dioceses was dissolved canonically in the Consistory of 7 July 1692 by Pope Innocent XII.  On 10 September 1692, the Bishop of Die, Armand de Montmorin Saint-Hérem, had an interview with James II of England and Louis XIV.  Asked for a report on the state of the Dauphiné, inter alia the Bishop reported that Die was entirely in the hands of the Huguenots.\nFrench Revolution\nIn 1790 the Civil Constitution of the Clergy reduced the number of dioceses in France from 135 to 83,  and ordered that they be coterminous with the new départements of the civil organization.  Each département was authorized and ordered to elect its own bishop; the electors did not have to be Catholic, and that fact alone created a schism between the Constitutional Church and Constitutional Bishops and the Roman Catholic Church.  Bishop Gaspard-Alexis Plan des Augiers protested, and then fled his diocese; he died in exile in Rome in 1794. On 21 February 1791, the Constitutional diocese of Drôme'' elected François Marbos, curé of the parish of Bourg-lez-Valence as their 'bishop'.  He was consecrated in Paris on 3 April 1791, by Jean Baptiste Gobel of Paris, assisted by Bishops Mirodot and Gouttes.  After the Concordat of 1801 he retracted his errors, and died in communion with Rome in 1825.\nBishops\nThe Carthusian who went by the pseudonym Polycarpe de la Rivière gives a St. Martinus (220) as first Bishop of Die; his assertion has been doubted. The oldest historically known bishop is Nicasius of Dijon, who attended the First Council of Nicaea in 325.\nto 1276\n*Nicasius: 325\n*Audentius: c. 439\n*Petronius\n*Marcellus : 463\n*Saeculatius : 517, 518\n*Lucretius : 541, 573\n*Paul : 585\n*Maximus : 614\n}}\n*Desideratus : 788\n*Remigius  : 859\n*Aurelius : 875\n*Hemico 879\n*Achideus : 957\n*Wulfinus (Wulfade) : 974\n*Conon (Cuno) : 1037\n*Pierre I  : 1055\n*Lancelin 1073\n*Hugues de Romans 1082\n*Ponce : 1084–1086\n*Bernard\n*Ismido (Ismidon de Sassenage) : 1097/8?–1115\n*Pierre II : 1116–1119\n*Étienne : 1121–1127\n*Ulric (Odolric) : 1130\n*Hugues, : died in 1159\n*Pierre III : 1163–1173\n*Bernard : 1176\n*Humbert  : 1199–1212\n*Étienne de Chatillon : died 1213\n* Desiderius de Forcalquier (Didier de Lans) 1213–1222\n*Bertrand D'Étoile 1223–1235\n*Humbert II 1235–1245, resigned\n*Amedée de Genève 1245–1276\n::United with the diocese of Valence (1276–1687)\nfrom 1687 to 1801\n*[Daniel de Cosnac : 1687–1691]\n*Armand de Montmorin Saint-Hérem :  1691–1694\n*Séraphin de Pajot de Plouy : 1694–1701\n*Gabriel de Cosnac : 1701–1734\n*Daniel-Joseph de Cosnac : 1734–1741\n*Gaspard-Alexis Plan des Augiers 1741–1794, last bishop of Valence and Die\nSee also\n* Catholic Church in France\n* List of Catholic dioceses in France\nReferences\nBooks\n* [Lists of Bishops, Provosts, Deans, and Sacristans of the Cathedral of Die]\n*Chevalier, C.U.J (1868), [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_8JQEAAAAQAAJ Documents inédits relatifs au Dauphiné].
