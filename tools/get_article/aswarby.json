In 1921 the parish had a population of 90.\nHistory\nThe village may take its name from the old Danish name Aswarth; it was originally an  ecclesiastical parish within the ancient Aswardhun  wapentake of the Danelaw. Although there is no firm evidence of earlier occupation, a flint axe  and a 2nd-century AD Roman brooch were found near Aswarby.\nThe village is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as \"Aswardebi\".  In the mid-19th century, it was moved to a new site to make way for improvements to Aswarby Park; the original position is about 500 yards to the south-west of the modern village.\nOn 1 April 1931 the parish was abolished to form \"Aswarby and Swarby\", part also went to form \"Aunsby and Dembleby\".\nLandmarks\nThe Anglican church of St Denys is in Aswarby; it has been a Grade I listed building since 1967. Parts of the church date back to the 12th, 14th and 15th centuries.  The font is 12th century with a 20th-century lid, and the chancel, designed by H. E. Kendall, was built in 1849. In 1850 the church was restored by Edward Blore. There are memorials to George Bass and members of the Whichcote family.\nAswarby Hall was the seat of the Hervey and Carr (or Carre) families.  Sir Francis Whichcote, 3rd Baronet moved there in the early 1700s. By the mid-19th century, it had descended to Sir Thomas Whichcote, 7th Baronet and High Sheriff of Lincolnshire. It is the setting for \"Lost Hearts\", a ghost story by M. R. James, a writer of supernatural short fiction. The hall itself was demolished in 1951, leaving only two pillars standing.  The surrounding park remains and is owned by Aswarby Estates.\nThe surviving estate properties are included in Aswarby's inventory of 19 Grade II listed buildings, which includes the Estate Office, several farmhouses, cottages, The Old Smithy, a walled garden and bothy, and a milestone.\n13 of the village's listed buildings are in a conservation area, as defined by Heritage Lincolnshire.\nNotable people\nGeorge Bass, explorer of Australia and Tasmania, was born in Aswarby; Bass Strait was named after him.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050323225414/http://fadl12200.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/mrjframes.html M.R.James website]\n*"
