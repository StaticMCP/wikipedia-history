Former Illinois Governor Frank Lowden and Kansas Senator Charles Curtis were candidates for the nomination but stood no chance against the popular and accomplished Hoover. Chicago Mayor William Hale Thompson considered himself a candidate, but without the support of Ruth Hanna McCormick, his candidacy was unsuccessful.\nHoover was nominated on the first ballot with 837 votes to 72 for Lowden and 64 for Curtis and the rest scattered. John L. McNab delivered Hoover's nomination address. In his acceptance speech, Hoover said, \"We in America today are nearer to the final triumph over poverty ever before in the history of any land.\" That and other optimistic remarks about the country's future were used against him in the 1932 election, which he lost to Franklin Roosevelt.\nBackground\nAfter Coolidge announced that \"I do not choose to run\" for a second full term in August 1927, Hoover emerged as the frontrunner. Illinois Governor Frank Lowden, Vice President Charles Dawes, and Senators James Eli Watson of Indiana, Charles Curtis of Kansas, Guy D. Goff of West Virginia, and Frank Willis of Ohio were potential challengers to Hoover.\nHoover had won respect by many for his work in the Wilson, Harding, and Coolidge administrations, but many party regulars distrusted his loyalty to the party on issues of both policy and patronage. Some progressive Republicans, such as California Senator Hiram Johnson, also disliked Hoover, but others, such as Senator William E. Borah, favored his candidacy. Many party leaders pressured Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon to run, but at 73, Mellon felt that he was too old to run in 1928. Mellon sought to convince former Secretary of State and 1916 Republican nominee Charles Evans Hughes to run, but Hughes refused to campaign for the nomination.\nPlatform\nThe platform praised the Coolidge administration for the prosperity of the mid-1920s, and promised reduction of the national debt, tax reduction, retention of the protective tariff, opposition of cancellation of foreign debts, settlement of claims from World War I from foreign governments, continuation of the Coolidge foreign policy, support of arbitration treaties, civil service protection, a tariff for agricultural protection and continued farm exports, aid to the coal-mining industry, continued appropriations for highway construction, the right to collective bargaining, regulation of railroads, a continued independent American merchant marine, government supervision of radio facilities, construction of waterways to help transportation of bulk goods, support for war veterans, federal regulation of public utilities, conservation, vigorous law enforcement, honest government, continued reclamation of arid lands in the West, improvement of air-mail service, restricted immigration and naturalization of foreign immigrants in America, continued enforcement of the Washington Naval Treaty, and continued territory status for Alaska and Hawaii, and called for more women in public service, authority for the President to draft defense material resources and services, creation of an Indian Commission, and an Anti-Lynching Law, and promised continued \"Home Rule for the American Citizen\".\nHoover's forces won an early victory by securing adoption of an agricultural plank which endorsed President Coolidge's position on the question and rejected all principles of the McNary–Haugen Farm Relief Bill. Former Governor Lowden caused a sensation by announcing that since the agricultural plank was unsatisfactory, he withdrew from consideration as presidential nominee.\nPresidential nomination\nPresidential candidates\nFile:President Hoover portrait.jpg|Commerce SecretaryHerbert Hooverof California\nFile:Frank O Lowden portrait (1).jpg|Former GovernorFrank O.

He sent Secretary to the President Everett Sanders to the convention to tell leaders of state delegations to vote for anyone else. With no strong alternative, Hoover appeared to be the likely nominee at the start of the convention, but many in the party still opposed his candidacy. A \"draft Coolidge\" movement emerged, but the movement collapsed after William S. Vare, political boss of Philadelphia, unexpectedly supported Hoover. Coolidge remained silent, refusing to tell even the delegation from the president's home state of Vermont whether to support the draft. Curtis sought supporters of Hoover's rivals for his own candidacy. However, Hoover won the nomination on the first ballot.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"3\" | Presidential Ballot\n|-\n! Candidate !!1st!!

Tilsonof Connecticut(Withdrew)\nAt the start of the convention, Vice President Charles G. Dawes was perhaps the most likely running mate for Hoover. Other possibilities included former Kansas Governor Henry Justin Allen, New Jersey Senator Walter Edge, New Hampshire Senator George H. Moses, Connecticut Representative John Q. Tilson, and Ambassador Alanson B. Houghton. Curtis was also a possibility, but he was not yet ready to concede the presidential nomination to Hoover.\nAfter Hoover won the presidential nomination, Moses, Illinois Senator Charles S. Deneen, and former Massachusetts Governor Channing Cox were named as the most likely vice-presidential nominees, with a re-nomination for Dawes also a possibility. Party leaders considered nominating Cox or Dawes, but Cox was vetoed by Utah Senator Reed Smoot, and Dawes was unacceptable to Hoover and Coolidge for supporting McNary-Haugen.\nThe convention turned to the farm vote in hopes of placating them for the unfavorably received farm relief plank. Curtis' name was entered by Senator Borah and his nomination was practically assured since the Lion of Idaho and other westerners had issued an ultimatum that a westerner must hold the vice presidency to placate the farmers. The Senate Majority Leader voted for the McNary-Haugen Bill which President Coolidge vetoed, but had refused to vote to override the veto of that measure. Curtis, possibly with the support of Coolidge, was nominated by the party leaders, and the convention ratified the choice.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"3\" | Vice Presidential Ballot\n|-\n!
