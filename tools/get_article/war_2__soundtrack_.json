It was later filmed in the first week of July 2025 in Mumbai.\nThe third single \"Jeete Jeete\" sung by Jubin Nautiyal, focused on the childhood friendship of both the characters of Roshan and Rao.

A reviewer from Bollywood Hungama found Pritam's music to be average, with \"Aavan Jaavan\" to be non-enticing while \"Janaab-e-Aali\" standing out. However, the background score by Balhara brothers was praised. Titas Chowdhury of News18 praised the film's pumping background music, however she criticized the placing of songs in the film and considered them more as plot hurdles. Vineeta Kumar from India Today criticized the film's song for being poorly placed and found background music to be unimpressive. Mayur Sanap from Rediff praised the adrenaline thumping score by Balhara brothers however he called Pritam's music as strictly functional.\nTrack listing\nHindi\nTelugu\nTamil\nAlbum credits\nCredits are adapted from YRF Music.\n* Music composers: Pritam (tracks 1, 3, 8), Sanchit Balhara and Ankit Balhara (tracks 4, 5, 6, 7)\n* Lyricists: Amitabh Bhattacharya (tracks 1, 2, 3), Roll Rida (track 4), Tsumyoki, Brianna Supriyo, RANJ, Shreya Phukan (track 8)\n* Music production & arrangement: AM.
