The 20th edition in 2016 numbered 220,000 visitors, the 26th edition in 2024 did count for 265,500 guests. The festival is a combination of motocross, music, theatre and stunts.\n'Zwarte Cross' literally means 'black cross'; it is a reference to the illegal motocross races in the 1960s. The organisation is in the hands of Dutch firm De Feestfabriek Alles Komt Goed B.V., sold in 2021 to Superstruct Entertainment, which in 2024 was acquired by U.S. investment firm KKR & Co.\nHistory\nThe first edition of the 'official' Zwarte Cross took place in 1997 in Hummelo, region De Achterhoek. It was a motocross in which anyone could compete on a motorcycle, moped or scooter. The day was concluded with a concert of local rock band Jovink & De Voederbietels in which two of the organisers did play. Although the name suggested the race was illegal, the organisation had all necessary permits. About 150 people competed, and there were 1000 visitors.\nThe festival proved to be successful, the second edition had 350 competitors, and 4000 visitors, but a lot of people got injured. Therefore, the organisation decided to cooperate with a professional motocross club, HALMAC, in Halle. The third edition, with a duration of three days, was held on their official Grand Prix circuit. Visitors could stay overnight at the festival campsite.\nIn 2007, the festival moved to Lichtenvoorde.\nThe mascot and logo of the Zwarte Cross is 'Tante Rikie', Rikie Nijman, the mother of Jovink's manager, André Nijman. She is the unofficial festival CEO and is well-known by the visitors. During the festival, she is carried around in a sedan chair, and visitors kneel for her.\nEditions\n2010\nThe 14th edition took place 15 July - 18 July.

All of the already built tents were blown over, some destroyed. The damage was over 1 million euro. The scenery of the mega-tent (the biggest on the terrain, was replaced by an outdoor-stage.\nSaturday 17 July, an employee of a fairground attraction was killed in an accident, while testing the ride.\n2011\nThe 15th edition had 152,500 visitors.
