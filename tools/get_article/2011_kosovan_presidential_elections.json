However, not all members of the PDK were in favour of this.\nElection\nFirst vote\nIt took three rounds of voting for Pacolli to be elected; he got 54, 58 and 62 votes respectively. Only 67 MPs were present, with the 53 opposition MPs boycotting the election.\nResignation of Pacolli\nThe election was declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court on 28 March 2011 with a vote of 7 to 2, as the necessary quorum had not been reached in the first two rounds. Pacolli resigned on 30 March 2011 and was again replaced as Acting President by Jakup Krasniqi, the Assembly's speaker.\nSecond vote\nFirst vote\n| previous_year     = February 2011\n| previous_mps      =\n| election_date     = 7 April\n| next_election     = 2016 Kosovan presidential election\n| next_year         = 2016\n| needed_votes      = 80 (1st & 2nd rounds) or  61 (3rd round)  electoral\n| votes_for_election = 120 members of the Assembly of the Republic of Kosovo\n| image1            =\n| nominee1          = Atifete Jahjaga\n| party1            = Independent\n| electoral_vote1   = 81\n| percentage1       = 67.5%\n| image2            =\n| nominee2          = Suzan Novoberdali\n| party2            = New Kosovo Alliance\n| electoral_vote2   = 19\n| percentage2       = 15.83%\n| title              = President\n| posttitle          = President-designate\n| before_election    = Behgjet Pacolli\n| before_party       = New Kosovo Alliance\n| after_election     = Atifete Jahjaga\n| after_party        = Independent\n}}\nIn a second vote on April 7, the PDK, AKR, and the opposition Democratic League of Kosovo agreed on a compromise candidate: police commander Atifete Jahjaga. She was elected with 80 votes of the 100 MPs present.\nIt was also agreed that she would only serve on an interim basis, with a direct presidential election planned for 2012 after the necessary constitutional changes have passed. The Constitutional Court however, ruled against shortening the term of the sitting president. and Jahjaga sat for the full term of five years.\nA decision was also made to hold early parliamentary elections in early 2013, which was later held in 2014.\nReferences"
