The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film was created in 1956 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) to honour non-English-speaking films produced outside the United States. That year, AMPAS asked individual countries to submit their best films of the year for the inaugural Best Foreign Language Film category. In previous years, the Foreign Language Oscar had not been a regular award, and there were no nominees – a winner was simply announced at the Oscar ceremony.\nThe award has since been handed out annually, and countries are invited by the Academy to submit their best films for competition according to strict rules, with only one film being accepted from each country.\nFor the 29th Academy Awards only, the nominations were credited both to the submitting country and to the films' producers; in all later years, only the country has been credited as the nominee, rather than a producer or director. Eight films were submitted in the category Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and five of these were selected as Oscar nominees: Denmark, France, West Germany, Italy and Japan.\nItaly was the inaugural winner with La Strada by Federico Fellini, which was also nominated for Best Writing, Best Original Screenplay.\nSubmissions\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
