The causes laid in opposition to the reforms of Amanullah Khan, namely in regards to conscription and taxation. The rebellion lasted 6 months, largely because none of the conscripted battalions in the south were willing to fight the Alizai. Ultimately, the rebellion was defeated with troops from Herat, who executed rebel leaders and deported groups of Zamindawaris to Afghan Turkestan.\nSee also\n* Khost rebellion (1924–1925), uprising in Afghanistan that begun in the subsequent year\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*"
