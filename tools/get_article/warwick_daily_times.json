It is owned by RISN Operations Inc.\nThe Daily Times was founded in 2006 as a companion to the Kent County Daily Times, also based in West Warwick, which covers the other four towns of Kent County, Rhode Island.\nHistory\nThe Kent County paper was founded in 1892 as the Pawtuxet Valley Daily Times, switching to its current name in the 1980s. In 1999, it was acquired by Journal Register Company.\nThe Warwick newspaper was launched in May 2006, following the closure of the Providence Journal news bureau in Warwick. The Daily Times newspapers added 15 new staff members to accommodate the expansion.\nIn 2007, a new company, RISN, formed to purchase Journal Register's Rhode Island properties, including the Daily Times newspapers. Shortly after the sale, the newspaper decreased its staff and was reduced to two eight-page sections. By July 26, 2007, the last edition of the Warwick Daily Times was published.\nSisters and competitors\nIn its coverage area, Daily Times competes with the state's largest daily, the Providence Journal.\nRISN (which stands for Rhode Island Suburban Newspapers) also owns three other daily newspapers in Rhode Island, The Call of Woonsocket, The Times of Pawtucket and the Kent County Daily Times, as well as several weekly newspapers. All of these properties were sold for $8.3 million to RISN in early 2007 by Journal Register Company.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ricentral.com RICentral.com -- Times Website]\n* [http://www.ryantconaty.com -- Online portfolio of former Warwick Daily Times staff photographer Ryan T.
