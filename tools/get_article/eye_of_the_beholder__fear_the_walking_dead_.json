Sure, the Clarks might have to stay at Brokejaw for a while and the season may feel a bit stifled at some point because of it, but the characters seem to be instinctually making good decisions right now and that's enough to keep the engine humming.\"\nRatings\n\"Eye of the Beholder\" was seen by 3.11 million viewers in the United States on its original air date, above the second-season finales rating of 3.05 million.\nReferences"
