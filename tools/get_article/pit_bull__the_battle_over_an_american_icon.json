Dickey spent seven years researching the topic and interviewed hundreds of people ranging from animal behaviorists to trainers.\nReception\nThe book received a mostly positive reception from critics.\nThe Wall Street Journal said that \"Ms. Dickey has earned her reputation as a first-rate reporter.” The New York Times stated that \"Dickey not only writes about the ebb and flow of public fear and loathing, she takes the reader on a thoroughly comprehensible tour of genetics and behavioral science to explain why breeding never guarantees an individual dog's personality, and shouldn't be used to condemn it.\"\nThe Christian Science Monitor called it “brilliant\" and \"a powerful and disturbing book that shows how the rise of the killer-pit bull narrative reflects many broader American anxieties and pathologies surrounding race, class, and poverty.\"\nAnti-pit bull advocates accused Dickey of downplaying the potential danger of pit bull dogs. She also received death threats at book signings.\nReferences"
