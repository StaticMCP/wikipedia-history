An entry in The Canadian Encyclopedia suggests that as opposed to \"negotiation\", what happened instead was simply that Bond Head \"collected the signatures\" of these leaders on the treaty document. Bond Head had travelled to Manitoulin Island in part for an annual exchange of presents with his Indigenous counterparts; according to historian Robert J. Surtees, he \"took more decisive action\" in negotiating the treaty once there.\nThe English-language document memorializing the treaty is in the collection of Library and Archives Canada.\nThe treaty's conclusion was memorialized on Manitoulin Island in August 2011.\nThe term \"Manitoulin Island treaty\" may also refer to a treaty negotiated in 1862.\nNotes\nSources\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://www.rcaanc-cirnac.gc.ca/eng/1370372152585/1581293792285#ucls22 Transcription] of the text of Treaty 45, dated 9 August 1836, via Crown–Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada"
