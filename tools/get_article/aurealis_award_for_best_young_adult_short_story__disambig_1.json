To qualify, a work must have been first published by an Australian citizen or permanent resident between 1 January and 31 December of the corresponding year; the presentation ceremony is held the following year. It has grown from a small function of around 20 people to a two-day event attended by over 200 people.\nSince their creation in 1995, awards have been given in various categories of speculative fiction. Categories currently include science fiction, fantasy, horror, speculative young adult fiction—with separate awards for novels and short fiction—collections, anthologies, illustrative works or graphic novels, children's books, and an award for excellence in speculative fiction. The awards have attracted the attention of publishers by setting down a benchmark in science fiction and fantasy. The continued sponsorship by publishers such as HarperCollins and Orbit has identified the award as an honour to be taken seriously.\nThe results are decided by a panel of judges from a list of submitted nominees; the long-list of nominees is reduced to a short list of finalists. Ties can occur if the panel decides both entries show equal merit, however they are encouraged to choose a single winner. The judges are selected from a public application process by the Award's management team.\nThis article lists all the short-list nominees and winners in the best young-adult short story category. Margo Lanagan has won the award three times and Isobelle Carmody has won it twice. Lanagan also holds the record for most nominations, with ten.\nWinners and nominees\nIn the following table, the years correspond to the year of the story's eligibility; the ceremonies are always held the following year. Each year links to the corresponding \"year in literature\" article. Entries with a blue background have won the award; those with a white background are the nominees on the short-list. If the short story was originally published in a book with other stories rather than by itself or in a magazine, the book title is included after the publisher's name.\nWinners and joint winners\nNominees on the shortlist\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" width=\"85%\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! width=\"7%\"|Year\n! width=\"25%\"|Author(s)\n! width=\"32%\"|Short story\n! width=\"32%\"|Publisher or publication\n! width=\"4%\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref\n|-\n! align=\"center\" |\n|  || align=\"center\" |  || align=\"center\" |  ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |\n| * ||  || Viking Press (Green Monkey Dreams) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Omnibus Books ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Lothian Books ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Hyland House (''Annie's Brother's Suit) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Penguin Books (Dream Weavers) ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |\n| * ||  || Lothian Books ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Lothian Books ||\n|-\n|  ||  || HarperCollins (Hanging by a Thread and Other Stories) ||\n|-\n! align=\"center\" |\n|  || align=\"center\" |  || align=\"center\" |  ||\n|-\n! align=\"center\" |\n|  || align=\"center\" |  || align=\"center\" |  ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |\n| * ||  || Allen & Unwin (White Time) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Hodder Headline (Tales from the Wasteland) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Allen & Unwin (White Time) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Allen & Unwin (White Time) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Allen & Unwin (White Time) ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |\n| * || Dreamwalker || Lothian Books ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Simon & Schuster (Love & Sex: Ten Stories of Truth) ||\n|-\n! align=\"center\" |\n|  || align=\"center\" |  || align=\"center\" |  ||\n|-\n! align=\"center\" |\n|  || align=\"center\" |  || align=\"center\" |  ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" |\n| * ||  || Allen & Unwin (Black Juice) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || CSFG Publishing (Encounters) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Viking Press (The Faery Reel: Tales from the Twilight Realm) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Allen & Unwin (Black Juice) ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |\n| * ||  || Allen & Unwin (Across the Wall: Tales of the Old Kingdom and Elsewhere) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Andromeda Spaceways Inflight Magazine ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" |\n| * ||  || Lothian Books ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Eidolon Books (Eidolon I) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Eidolon Books (Eidolon I) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Allen & Unwin (Red Spikes) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Allen & Unwin (Red Spikes) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Allen & Unwin (Red Spikes) ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |\n| * ||  || Ticonderoga Publications (Fantastic Wonder Stories) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Ticonderoga Publications (Fantastic Wonder Stories) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Eclipse ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Allen & Unwin (Dark Alchemy) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Ticonderoga Publications (Fantastic Wonder Stories) ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" |\n| * ||  || Shiny ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Norilana Books (Clockwork Phoenix) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Andromeda Spaceways Inflight Magazine ||\n|-\n|  ||  || DAW Books (Misspelled) ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |\n| * ||  || CSFG Publishing (Masques) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Andromeda Spaceways Inflight Magazine ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Shiny ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Andromeda Spaceways Inflight Magazine ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Shiny ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |\n| * ||  || Allen & Unwin (Zombies Vs Unicorns) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || FableCroft Publishing (Worlds Next Door) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Shiny ||\n|-\n|  & Tansy Rayner Roberts ||  || FableCroft Publishing (Worlds Next Door) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Tangled Bank Press (The Tangled Bank) ||\n|-style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |\n| * ||  || Twelfth Planet Press (Nightsiders) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Candlewick Press (Steampunk!
