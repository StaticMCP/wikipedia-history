A special award called Best Actor – Critics or Best Actor – Jury is also awarded occasionally since 2008, whose winner was selected by the jury of critics assigned to the function.\nThe jury award was awarded without prior nominations until 2010. Since then, the jury award is also awarded with prior nominations just like the original award which is now called Best Actress – Popular.\nSuperlatives\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|- style=\"height:4.5em;\"\n! style=\"width:350px;\"|Superlative\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:600px;\"|Popular\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:600px;\"|Overall(Popular + Jury)\n|- style=\"height:4.5em;\"\n| style=\"width:350px;\"|Actress with most awards\n| style=\"width:500px;\"|Divyanka Tripathi dahiya\n| style=\"width:100px;\"| 4\n| style=\"width:500px;\"|Divyanka Tripathi Dahiya\n| style=\"width:100px;\"|4\n|- style=\"height:4.5em;\"\n|Actress with most nominations\n| style=\"width:500px;\"|Sakshi Tanwar\n| style=\"width:100px;\"|3\n| style=\"width:500px;\"|Sakshi Tanwar\n| style=\"width:100px;\"|5\n|- style=\"height:4.5em;\"\n|Actress with most nominations(without ever winning)\n| style=\"width:500px;\"|Hina Khan\n| style=\"width:100px;\"|5\n| style=\"width:500px;\"|Hina Khan\n| style=\"width:100px;\"|6\n|- style=\"height:4.5em;\"\n|}\n* Divyanka Tripathi with four awards has the most wins, followed by Ankita Lokhande, Deepika Singh and Shraddha Arya with two wins each.\n* Tripathi also holds the most nominations with six.\n* Divyanka Tripathi holds the record of three wins for same role (Yeh Hai Mohobatein) under Best Actress category\n* Rashami Desai holds most nominations in three different categories for same role (Uttaran), that is, for Best Actress (Popular), Best Actress (Critics) and Best Actress in a negative role (Popular), out of which Desai won the latter two.\n*There have been four ties: between Ankita Lokhande and Mahi Vijj in 2011, Divyanka Tripathi and Mouni Roy in 2016, Sriti Jha and Shraddha Arya in 2018, and Shraddha Arya and Shivangi Joshi in 2019.\nMultiple nominations\n* 6 Nominations: Divyanka Tripathi\n* 5 Nominations: Sriti Jha\n* 4 Nominations: Deepika Singh\n* 3 Nominations: Hina Khan, Shweta Tiwari, Shivangi Joshi, Ankita Lokhande, Kratika Sengar\n* 2 Nominations: Pooja Gor, Giaa Manek, Avika Gor, Sakshi Tanwar, Drashti Dhami, Sanaya Irani, Devoleena Bhattacharjee, Dipika Kakar, Mouni Roy, Surbhi Chandna, Shraddha Arya, Rubina Dilaik\nList of winners (Popular)\n2000s\n*2007 Rajshree Thakur - Saat Phere...Saloni Ka Safar as Saloni Singh\n**Prachi Desai - Kasamh Se as Bani Walia\n**Divyanka Tripathi Dahiya - Banoo Main Teri Dulhann as Vidya Pratap Singh\n**Priyanka Bassi - Left Right Left as Cadet Naina Singh Ahluwalia\n**Shweta Tiwari - Kasautii Zindagii Kay as Prerna Bajaj\n**Smriti Zubin Irani - Virrudh as Vasudha\n*2008 'Divyanka Tripathi - Banoo Main Teri Dulhann as Vidya Pratap Singh / Divya'\n**Parul Chauhan - Sapna Babul Ka...Bidaai as Ragini Ranvir Rajvansh\n**Sara Khan - Sapna Babul Ka...Bidaai as Sadhana Alekh Rajvansh\n**Additi Gupta - Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil as Heer Prem Juneja\n**Avika Gor - Balika Vadhu as Anandi Jagdish Singh\n**Shubhangi Atre Poorey - Kasturi as Kasturi Sabbarwal\n*2009 Not Held\n2010s\n*2010 Ratan Rajput - Agle Janam Mohe Bitiya Hi Kijo as Laali\n**Ragini Khanna - Sasural Genda Phool as Suhana Ishaan Kashyap\n**Hina Khan - Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai as Akshara Singhania\n**Tina Dutta - Uttaran as Ichha\n**Ankita Lokhande - Pavitra Rishta as Archana M.
