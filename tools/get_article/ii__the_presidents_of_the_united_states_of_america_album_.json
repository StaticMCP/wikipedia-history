It was released via Columbia Records on November 5, 1996, coinciding with the United States presidential election.\nBackground\nThe album included a few songs that originally appeared on Froggystyle, a self-released cassette that was recorded before their debut album, The Presidents of the United States of America. These songs, which were re-recorded for this album, were \"L.I.P\", then known as \"Little Indian Princess\", \"Lunatic to Love\" and \"Puffy Little Shoes\". Also, \"Twig\" was re-recorded, as it was previously recorded as a B-side to a  \"Lump\" single, where it was known as \"Twig in the Wind\". That version was later released on Rarities as \"Twig (Semi Acoustic Version)\".\nTrack listing\nAll songs by The Presidents of the United States of America.\n#\"Ladies and Gentlemen, Part 1\" – 1:39\n#\"Lunatic to Love\" – 2:57\n#\"Volcano\" – 2:58\n#\"Mach 5\" – 3:15\n#\"Twig\" – 2:37\n#\"Bug City\" – 3:05\n#\"Bath of Fire\" – 2:57\n#\"Tiki God\" – 2:58\n#\"L.I.P.\" – 3:20\n#\"Froggie\" – 3:10\n#\"Toob Amplifier\" – 1:22\n#\"Supermodel\" – 2:49\n#\"Puffy Little Shoes\" – 4:59\n#\"Ladies and Gentlemen, Part 2\" – 3:03\n#\"Basketball Dream\" – 0:55 (hidden track)\n\"Basketball Dream\" features a boy, Tony Ballew (a relative of Chris Ballew), describing a dream he had about Magic Johnson - for this reason, the track is often mislabeled \"Magic Johnson Dream\". Chris Ballew can be heard faintly whispering the lyrics underneath the boy. The recording of Tony's voice, with a different musical backing, previously appeared on Feel Good, an album by Ballew's pre-PUSA band Egg, in 1989. The same recording from Feel Good was first released on the self-titled album by The Dukes o' Pop, another pre-PUSA project of Ballew's, in 1987.\nPersonnel\n;The Presidents of the United States of America\n*Chris Ballew – basitar, bass, lead vocals, keyboards\n*Dave Dederer – guitbass, guitar, background vocals\n*Jason Finn – drums, percussion, background vocals\n;Additional personnel\n*Dave Thiele – piano, percussion\n*Tony Ballew – baby voice on \"Basketball Dream\"\n*Mark Sandman – tritar on \"Froggie\"\n*S.
