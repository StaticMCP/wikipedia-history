The election was conducted on the basis of a simple majority or first-past-the-post voting system. In this election there were 32 multi-member districts returning 73 members and 40 single member districts. In the multi-member districts each elector could vote for as many candidates as there were vacancies. 13 districts were uncontested. There was no recognisable party structure at this election. The average number of enrolled voters per seat was 1,701, ranging from East Maitland (984) to Wentworth (2,977).\nThe electoral boundaries were established under the Electoral Act 1880 (NSW), which provided that a district would return a second member if the electoral roll reached 3,000, a third member upon reaching 5,000 and a fourth member on reaching 8,000. At this election there were five districts which returned an additional member, Balmain, Bourke, Canterbury, Redfern and St Leonards.\nElection results\nAlbury\n}}\nArgyle\n}}\nBalmain\n}}\n| colspan=\"2\"   | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | (1 new seat)\nBalranald\n}}\nBathurst\n}}\nThe Bogan\n}}\nBoorowa\n}}\nBourke\n}}\n| colspan=\"2\"   | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | (1 new seat)\nBraidwood\n}}\nCamden\n}}\nCanterbury\n}}\n| colspan=\"2\"   | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | (1 new seat)\nJoseph Mitchell had previously been defeated as a sitting member for Newtown.\nCarcoar\n}}\nThe Clarence\n}}\nCentral Cumberland\n}}\nDurham\n}}\nEast Macquarie\n}}\nEast Maitland\n}}\nEast Sydney\n}}\nA sitting member Henry Dangar did not contest the election.
