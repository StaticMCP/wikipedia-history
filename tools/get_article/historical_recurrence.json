The concept of historical recurrence has been applied to various levels of human history, from the rise and fall of empires to patterns in the history of a given polity, or to any two specific events which bear a striking similarity.\nIn his book The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought, G. W. Trompf traces historically recurring patterns of political thought and behavior in the West since antiquity.\nAuthors\n]]\nAncient western thinkers who thought about recurrence were largely concerned with cosmological rather than historical recurrence. Western philosophers and historians who have discussed various concepts of historical recurrence include the Greek Hellenistic historian Polybius (c. 200 – c. 118 BCE), the Greek historian and rhetorician Dionysius of Halicarnassus (c. 60 BCE – after 7 BCE), Luke the Evangelist, Niccolò Machiavelli (1469–1527), Giambattista Vico (1668–1744), Correa Moylan Walsh (1862–1936), and Arnold J. Toynbee (1889–1975).\nIn ancient Eastern thought, Confucius (ca. 551 – ca. 479 BCE) urged: \"Study the past if you would define the future.\"\nG. W. Trompf describes various historical paradigms of historical recurrence, including paradigms that view types of large-scale historical phenomena variously as \"cyclical\"; \"fluctuant\"; \"reciprocal\"; \"re-enacted\"; or \"revived\". He also notes \"[t]he view proceeding from a belief in the uniformity of human nature [Trompf's emphasis]. It holds that because human nature does not change, the same sort of events can recur at any time.\" \"Other minor cases of recurrence thinking\", he writes, \"include the isolation of any two specific events which bear a very striking similarity, and the preoccupation with parallelism, that is, with resemblances, both general and precise, between separate sets of historical phenomena\".\nIn the Islamic world, Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406) wrote that asabiyyah (social cohesion or group unity) plays an important role in a kingdom's or dynasty's cycle of rise and fall.\nLessons\nTrompf notes that most western concepts of historical recurrence imply that \"the past teaches lessons for&nbsp;... future action\"—that \"the same&nbsp;... sorts of events which have happened before&nbsp;... will recur\". One proponent of the idea of cosmic cycles was Poseidonius, who argued that dissipation of the old Roman virtues had followed the removal of the Carthaginian challenge to Rome's supremacy in the Mediterranean world.\n]]\nThe theme that civilizations flourish or fail according to their responses to the human and environmental challenges that they face, was picked up two thousand years later by Arnold J. Toynbee.\nDionysius of Halicarnassus (c. 60 BCEafter 7 BCE), after praising Rome, anticipated its eventual decay, suggesting the idea of recurring decay in the history of world empires—an idea developed by the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus (1st century BCE) and by Pompeius Trogus, a 1st-century BCE Roman historian from a Celtic tribe in Gallia Narbonensis.\nBy the late 5th century, Zosimus (also called \"Zosimus the Historian\"; fl. 490s–510s: a Byzantine historian who lived in Constantinople) could see the writing on the Roman wall, and asserted that empires fell due to internal disunity. He gave examples from the histories of Greece and Macedonia.  In Rome's decay, Zosimus saw history repeating itself in its general movements, which he related to the Fates and \"astral orbits\".\nThe ancients developed an enduring metaphor for a polity's evolution, drawing an analogy between an individual human's life cycle and developments undergone by a body politic: this metaphor was offered, in varying iterations, by Cicero (106–43 BCE), Seneca (c. 1 BCE – 65 CE), Florus (c. 74 CE – c. 130 CE), and Ammianus Marcellinus (between 325 and 330 CE – after 391 CE). This social-organism metaphor, which has been traced back to the Greek philosopher and polymath Aristotle (384–322 BCE), would recur centuries later in the works of the French philosopher and sociologist Auguste Comte (1798–1857), the English philosopher and polymath Herbert Spencer (1820–1903), and the French sociologist Émile Durkheim (1858–1917).\n]]\nNiccolò Machiavelli, analyzing the state of Florentine and Italian politics between 1434 and 1494, described recurrent oscillations between \"order\" and \"disorder\" within states:\nMachiavelli accounts for this oscillation by arguing that  (valor and political effectiveness) produces peace, peace brings idleness (), idleness disorder, and disorder  (ruin). In turn, from  springs order, from order , and from this, glory and good fortune. Machiavelli, as had the ancient Greek historian Thucydides, saw human nature as remarkably stable—steady enough for the formulation of rules of political behavior. Machiavelli wrote in his :\nJoshua S. Goldstein suggests that empires, analogously to an individual's midlife crisis, experience a political midlife crisis: after a period of expansion in which all earlier goals are realized, overconfidence sets in, and governments are then likely to attack or threaten their strongest rival. Goldstein cites four examples: the British Empire and the Crimean War; the German Empire and the First World War; the Soviet Union and the Cuban Missile Crisis; the United States and the Vietnam War.\nSimilarities\nOne \"minor case of recurrence thinking\" identified by G. W. Trompf involves \"the isolation of any two specific events which bear a very striking similarity\" and a \"preoccupation with parallelism, that is with resemblances, both general and precise, between separate sets of historical phenomena\".\nIn the 18th century, Samuel Johnson wrote that people are \"all prompted by the same motives, all deceived by the same fallacies, all animated by hope, obstructed by danger, entangled by desire, and seduced by pleasure\".\nIn The Trouble with History, Adam Michnik writes: \"The world is full of inquisitors and heretics, liars and those lied to, terrorists and the terrorized. There is still someone dying at Thermopylae, someone drinking a glass of hemlock, someone crossing the Rubicon, someone drawing up a proscription list.\"\nThe Spanish-American philosopher George Santayana observed: \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\"\nPlutarch's Parallel Lives traces the similarities between pairs of historical figures, one Greek and one Roman.\nMahatma Gandhi worked to liberate his compatriots by peaceful means and was shot dead; Martin Luther King Jr. worked to liberate his compatriots by peaceful means and was shot dead.\nOver history, confrontations between peoples – typically, geographical neighbors – help consolidate the peoples into nations, at times into frank empires; until at last, exhausted by conflicts and drained of resources, the once militant polities settle into a relatively peaceful habitus., 459 pp.; and David C.
