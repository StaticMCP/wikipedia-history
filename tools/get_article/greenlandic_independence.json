The Danish claim to the island stems from Norse settlement of southern Greenland which lasted from the 980s until the early 15th century.\nScholars believe that the earliest known Norse settlements in Greenland originated from Iceland, and that Erik the Red founded an early colony in 985. The Kingdom of Norway later claimed and controlled Greenland singularly from roughly 1261–1319.\nThese Norse settlements vanished during the 14th and early 15th centuries, leaving the Inuit as the sole occupants of the island, expanding to the southern and western coasts, and being de facto independent for over 200 years until European peoples returned. Despite this, a de jure continuing European possession of Greenland was assumed by European peoples.\nEuropean resettlement in the 18th–20th centuries\nEuropean contact with Greenland was not re-established until 1721 with the mission of Hans Egede, which was followed by the Moravian missions. These established enduring settlements and—after failing to find the Norse peoples—attempted to Christianize the Inuit.\nBy this time Norway and Denmark had been unified under Denmark–Norway which considered Greenland part of its territory. This ended on 14 January 1814 after Norway was ceded from Denmark as a result of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe. As a result of the Treaty of Kiel, Denmark resumed full sovereignty over Greenland soon after. From 1814 to 1953, Greenland was a territory, not independent and not part of Denmark, but directly controlled by the Danish government.\nAmerican protectorate and temporary occupation\nDuring the Second World War, Denmark was occupied and controlled by Nazi Germany between 1940 and 1945. As a result, the US government signed an agreement with Henrik Kauffmann, the Danish ambassador to the US,  to hand over defense and control of Greenland to the United States on 9 April 1941. The Danish government was shocked by Kauffmann's move, considered the agreement to be void and recalled Kauffmann from the US. The first American troops arrived in Greenland on 7 July 1941. The US built two airports with full-length runways. Until November 2024, with the renovation of the Nuuk airport, they were the main international airports of Greenland, despite being located far from any traditional settlement.\nGreenland was effectively independent during the war years, and allowed the United States to build bases on its territory, in spite of the Danish pre-war neutrality. After the war the pre-war situation was restored, the US bases remained and Denmark, with Greenland as a part of the Kingdom, joined NATO.\nMoves towards independence\nIn 1953, a new Danish Constitution incorporated Greenland into Denmark, the island thereby gained representation in the Danish Parliament and was recognized as a Danish province known as the County of Greenland.\nIn 1972, at the request of the Provincial Council, Knud Hertling established a committee of Greenlandic members to study the possibility of increased local power. In 1975, the committee recommended a shift to home rule as quickly as possible. Hertling responded with the creation of a Commission on Home Rule in Greenland with 14 members divided evenly between Greenlandic and Danish representatives. The commission's work submitted its final report in June 1978 with proposals for a Home Rule Act.\nIn 1979, the Danish government granted Greenland home rule, with Denmark keeping control of a number of areas including foreign relations, defense, currency matters, and the legal system in Greenland.\nGreenland's minimal representation in the Danish Folketing meant that, although over 70% of Greenlanders had opposed entry into the European Common Market (EEC), it nevertheless joined in 1973 as part of Denmark. Greenlanders' fears that the customs union would allow foreign firms to compete and overfish its waters were quickly realized. After home rule was secured, a bare majority (53%) of Greenland's population voted on 23 February 1982 to leave the EEC, a process which lasted until 1985. This resulted in the Greenland Treaty of 1985.\nIn 2008, Greenland's citizens approved the Greenlandic self-government referendum with a 75% vote in favor of a higher degree of autonomy. Greenland took control of law enforcement, the coast guard, and the legal system. The official language changed from Danish to Greenlandic on 21 June 2009, with the day being celebrated as Greenland national day. The act gives control of foreign relations of Greenland to the island in trade and other areas it is responsible for. Greenland has representatives in Copenhagen, Brussels, Reykjavik, and Washington, D.C.\nAs part of the self-rule law of 2009 (section §21), Greenland can declare full independence if it wishes to pursue it, but it would have to be approved by a referendum among the Greenlandic people and by the Danish parliament. It has been argued that because it was once a colony, under international law Greenland also has, separate from the 2009 law, the right of self-determination and could make a unilateral declaration of independence. A poll in 2016 showed that there was a clear majority (64%) for full independence among the Greenlandic people, but a poll in 2017 showed that there was a clear opposition (78%) if it meant a fall in living standards.\nGreenland's former prime minister, Kuupik Kleist, has repeatedly expressed the need to diversify Greenland's economy, which mainly relies on fishery, tourism and a substantial annual block grant from the Danish state. The block grant equals about two-thirds of Greenland's government budget or about one-quarter of the entire GDP of Greenland. Economic stability is seen as a basis for full political independence from Denmark. When Kim Kielsen was reelected  with a strong majority as the leader of the largest Greenlandic pro-independence party Siumut in 2017, observers considered it a win for the \"slow-independence\" faction instead of the \"now-independence\" faction. (His opponent, Vittus Qujaukitsoq, had argued for independence even if it meant losing the large annual block grant from the Danish state.) During a debate in the Danish Parliament (which also includes members from Greenland) in 2018, Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said that Greenland needs to make it clear if they wish to remain a part of the Kingdom or become independent. If Greenland were to become an independent country, the annual block grant from Denmark to Greenland would cease.\nIn 2008, independence campaigners touted the year 2021 (the 300th anniversary of Danish colonial rule) as a possible date for independence.\nIn 2023, a commission tasked with drafting a constitution for an independent Greenland presented its proposal. In February 2024, the island officially declared that independence is the goal for Greenland.\nUS President Donald Trump's interest in Greenland has strengthened the cause of Greenland's independence from Denmark.\nAt a press conference in early 2025, pro-independence prime minister Múte Bourup Egede said that \"work has already begun on creating the framework for Greenland as an independent state\" and apparently hinted that an independence referendum could take place as soon as April 2025, in tandem with the general elections. Greenland has never held an independence referendum, unlike neighbouring territories such as Iceland (in 1918), the Faroe Islands (in 1946) and Newfoundland (in 1948).\nPolling\nA poll in 2016 showed that there was a clear majority (64%) for full independence among the Greenlandic people.\nA 2017 poll showed that 78% of the population would oppose independence if it implied a lower standard of living.\nA 2019 poll showed that 67.8% of Greenlanders support independence from Denmark sometime in the next two decades.\nA 2025 poll showed that 84% of Greenlanders would support independence from Denmark, but 45% of the population would oppose independence if it meant a lower standard of living.\nIn fiction\nThe issue of Greenlandic independence features heavily in the eighth episode of the Swedish–Icelandic television series Thin Ice (2019–2020). Written by Søren Stærmose and Lena Endre, it was predominantly filmed in Greenland at the height of the Greenlandic winter. By the end of the first season, Greenland achieves independence, with covert backing from the United States. The political system of the newly independent Greenland is not given, although the country is shown to have awarded an unnamed American oil company offshore drilling rights to a large deep sea oil deposit.\nSee also\n* 1979 Greenlandic home rule referendum\n* Proposals for the United States to purchase Greenland\n* Faroese independence movement\n* Icelandic independence movement\n* Norwegian independence movement\n* Withdrawal from the European Union\n* Separatism in Canada\n* Nunavut\n* First Nations in Canada\n* Territorial evolution of Canada\nReferences"
