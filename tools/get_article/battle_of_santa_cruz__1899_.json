Lawton's Laguna de Bay campaign.\nBackground\nAfter defeating the Filipino nationalists at the second battle of Manila, General Elwell S. Otis, commander of the US VIII Corps, sent the 1st Division under Arthur MacArthur to the north to threaten the Filipino capitol at Malolos. At the same time, the 2nd Division under Henry W. Lawton was sent south into the Laguna province, to the Filipino stronghold located in the town of Santa Cruz.\nLandings\nOn April 8, 1899, Lawton's division boarded a small fleet of cascos escorted by the gunboats Laguna de Bay, Oeste and Napindan, on the Pasig River east of Manila and sailed towards Laguna de Bay. The flotilla did not reach the opposite shore of the lake until early afternoon the next day, because the pilots were unfamiliar with the river and frequently grounded the boats. At 10:30&nbsp;a.m. on April 9, landing craft began offloading Lawton's troops south of the stronghold of Santa Cruz. Ashore in the afternoon of April 9, the troops set out for Santa Cruz in a long skirmish line, advancing through driving rain. At 5:45&nbsp;p.m., the right flank, consisting of the 1st Idaho and 14th Infantry, encountered a defense complex of entrenchments and bamboo obstructions, through which they advanced slowly against resistance, until darkness fell, when the troops camped in the fields.\nAdvance on Santa Cruz\nEarly on April 10, Lawton personally went ashore with the 4th Cavalry north of town.  They advanced along the main road leading into the town. Early on, Lawton ordered the telegraph lines be cut, severing the Filipinos' communication with Emilio Aguinaldo up north. The Americans met light resistance from the Filipinos until their approach to a bridge outside of town, which was heavily guarded by Filipinos under the command of General Juan Cailles. The 14th US Regular Infantry Regiment, 1st Idaho, and 1st Washington volunteers charged the bridge and managed to rout the Filipinos.\nAt the same time, dismounted Troops C and L of the 4th US Cavalry Regiment began to land under fire on a beach just north of town. The 4th Cavalry was supported by fire from Laguna de Bay, Oeste, and Napindan and managed to secure a foothold on the beach. That same day, Lawton took control of Santa Cruz as Cailles and his units withdrew to Pagsanjan.\nWhile Gen. Lawton consolidated his forces in Santa Cruz, he planned to push on to Pagsanjan where he figured the Filipinos had retreated. After capturing Pagsanjan on April 11, he again defeated the Filipinos in a stiff engagement at the Battle of Paete.\nWithdrawal\nOn April 16, Lawton's forces reboarded their transport ships to return to Manila, noticing enemy soldiers entering the town as they left.\nResults and aftermath\nOverall, the results of the Santa Cruz expedition amounted to the capture of six launches and the deaths of some 125 Filipino soldiers. After the expedition, Aguinaldo ordered forces at Cavite, Batangas, and Laguna to concentrate at Muntinlupa, tying up manpower south of Manila which might otherwise have gone north. The expedition demonstrated that towns on Laguna de Bay were vulnerable to raiders, forcing local officials to keep their military forces close to home in case of defensive need.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110814035426/http://culbertsonmansion.net/Lawton/Laguna-Report/01report-main.htm Report of an expedition to the Province of La Laguna]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101109084037/http://www.history.army.mil/html/reference/army_flag/pi.html Named Campaigns - Philippine Insurrection]"
