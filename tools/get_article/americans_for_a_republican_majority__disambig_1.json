On July 7, 2006, ARMPAC reached an agreement with the Federal Election Commission to pay a fine of $115,000 for various violations and to shut down operations. It filed its termination papers on April 24, 2007.\nHistory\nOriginally formed by Tom DeLay (R-Texas), Jim Ellis and several of close associates, ARMPAC was created with the goal of electing a Republican majority in the United States Congress for the 2000 elections. The millions of dollars ARMPAC raised were responsible for the success of many Republican candidates, officeholders, and PACs nationwide.\nAn FEC audit of ARMPAC's activities during the 2002 campaign cycle (January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2002) found failures to report debts, contributions, and assets, as well as a failure to properly separate federal and non-federal spending.  On 28 July 2005, the FEC approved enforcement for the matter after accepting the audit. Dani DeLay Ferro, DeLay's daughter and spokeswoman, said the fine and shutdown of ARMPAC were voluntary. In a statement, she said that the audit \"concerns highly technical FEC reporting rules, which due to their complexity, the commission has since reformed and simplified\".\nARMPAC provided the blueprint for Texans for a Republican Majority (TRMPAC), a state-level PAC founded in Austin by Ellis and DeLay in 2001.\nPayments to relatives\nFrom 2001 to January 31, 2006, ARMPAC paid Christine DeLay (DeLay's wife); Dani DeLay Ferro, and Ferro's Texas firm a total of $350,304 in political consulting fees and expenses.\nOfficers and notable members\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Position\n!Ref\n!Notes\n|-\n|Edwin Buckham\n|Co-founder\n|\n|\n|-\n|James W.
