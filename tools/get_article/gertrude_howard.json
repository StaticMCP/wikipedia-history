She broke into films in 1925, appearing in The Circus Cyclone, directed by Albert Rogell. In 1927, she played the wife of Uncle Tom in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin. In 1927, The Pittsburgh Courier stated that she was the \"highest salaried colored actress in Hollywood\". She appeared mostly in minor or supporting film roles, such as Queenie in the original version of Show Boat'' (1929), and Martha in Christy Cabanne's Conspiracy.\nHer appearance as Beulah Thorndyke in ''I'm No Angel'' (1933), led to her being forever linked to Mae West with the famous line, \"Beulah, peel me a grape\".\nIn Howard's short career she would appear in twenty-two films. That career was cut short by her untimely death in 1934 at the age of 41. Mae West helped raise funds for her funeral.\nFilmography\n(Per AFI database)\n*The Circus Cyclone (1925) as Mrs. Jackson\n*Easy Pickings (1927) as Mandy\n*On Your Toes (1927) as Mammy\n*South Sea Love (1927) as Moana\n*''Uncle Tom's Cabin (1927) as Aunt Chloe\n*Hearts in Dixie (1929) as Emmy\n*Show Boat (1929) as Queenie (uncredited)\n*His Captive Woman (1929) as Lavoris Smythe\n*Synthetic Sin (1929) as Cassie\n*Conspiracy (1930) as Martha\n*Guilty?
