The Southern Pacific Railroad began laying tracks south of Soledad in May 1886, reaching King City on July 3. The station building was constructed in 1903. It was originally located near the intersection of First and Broadway along the railroad's Coast Line.}} The station's proximity to the Southern Pacific Milling Company fueled the freight traffic emanating from King City. Passenger service to King city ceased in the 1940s.\nAfter being abandoned and threatened by demolition, the station building was acquired from the railroad and moved to San Lorenzo Park in 1989,}} becoming a part of the Monterey County Agricultural & Rural Life Museum.\nNotes\nReferences"
