José Bordas Valdez was elected President without opposition on June 15, 1914. The U.S. Navy ships intervened to end the bombardment of Puerto Plata beginning on June 26, 1914. The U.S. Army troops were deployed in support of the government in Santo Domingo in July 1914.

Some 500 individuals were killed during the conflict.\nSee also\n* Santo Domingo Affair\n* Dominican Civil War (1911–1912)\n* United States occupation of the Dominican Republic (1916–1924)\n* United States involvement in regime change\n* Latin America–United States relations\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Atkins, G.
