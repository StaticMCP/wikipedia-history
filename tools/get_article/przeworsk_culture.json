It takes its name from the town Przeworsk, near the village where the first artifacts were identified.\nIn its earliest form it was located in what is now central and southern Poland, in the upper Oder and Vistula basins. It later spread southwards, beyond the Carpathians, towards the headwaters of the Tisza river, and eastwards, past the Vistula, and towards the headwaters of the Dniester.\nThe earliest form of the culture was a northern extension of the Celtic La Tène material culture which influenced much of continental Europe in the Iron Age, but it was also influenced by other material cultures of the region, including the Jastorf culture to its west. To the east, the Przeworsk culture is associated with the Zarubintsy culture.\nInfluences\nScholars view the Przeworsk culture as an amalgam of a series of localized cultures. Although there is no evidence of an actual migration, the Przeworsk culture appears relatively suddenly, manifested as an adaptation of the Celtic La Tène culture technology from the southwest, and was quite distinct from the preceding Pomeranian culture and Cloche culture.\nTo its northwest, the Przeworsk culture also shows significant contact with the Jastorf culture, associated with the spread of early Germanic peoples including the Suebi. To the east, the Przeworsk culture is associated with the Zarubintsy culture in what is now northern Ukraine and southern Belarus, and the Early Slavs. Later in the 3rd and 4th centuries, much of this eastern area was subsequently absorbed by the Wielbark culture and Chernyakhov culture.\nCharacteristics\nThe Przeworsk culture people lived in small, unprotected villages, populated each by a few dozen residents at most, made up of several houses, usually set partially below the ground level (semi-sunken), each covering an area of 8–22 square meters. They knew how to dig and build wells, so the settlements didn't have to be located near bodies of water. Thirteen 2nd century wells with variously constructed timber lined walls were found at a settlement in Stanisławice, Bochnia County. Fields were being used for crop cultivation for a while and then as pastures, when animal excrement helped the soil regain fertility. Once iron share plows were introduced the fields were alternated between tillage and grazing.\nSeveral or more settlements made up a micro-region, within which the residents cooperated economically and buried their dead in a common cemetery, but which was separated from other micro-regions by undeveloped areas. A number of such micro-regions possibly made up a tribe, with these separated by empty space. The tribes in turn, especially if they were culturally closely related, would at times form larger structures, such as temporary alliances for waging wars, or even early statehood forms.\nA Przeworsk culture turn of the millennium industrial complex for the extraction of salt from salt springs was discovered in Chabsk near Mogilno.\nExaminations of the burial grounds, of which even the largest used continuously over periods of up to several centuries, contains no more than several hundreds graves, shows that the overall population density was low. The dead were cremated and the ashes sometimes placed in urns, which had the mid-part in the form of an engraved bulge. In the 1st century AD this was replaced with a sharp-profiled (with a horizontal ridge around the circumference) shape.\nIn Siemiechów a grave of a warrior who may have taken part in the Ariovistus expedition during the 70–50 BC period was found; it contains Celtic weapons and an Alpine region manufactured helmet used as an urn, together with local ceramics. The burial gifts were often, for unknown reasons, bent or broken, and then burned with the body. The burials range from \"poor\" to \"rich\", the latter ones supplied with fancy Celtic and then Roman imports, reflecting a considerably by this time developed social stratification.\nThe main feature of the Przeworsk culture are burials. These were mostly cremations, with occasional inhumation. Warrior burials are notable, which often include horse-gear and spurs. Some burials are exceptionally rich, overshadowing the graves of Germanic groups further west, especially after 400 AD. Pottery and metalwork are often rich and show a great variety\nPeoples\nThe Przeworsk culture was probably not exclusively connected with a single ancient ethnic or linguistic group. In classical ethnography, the culture was linked to a group of peoples known as the Lugii. Among specific Germanic peoples, the Przeworsk culture is often associated with the Vandals, although they were probably only one ethnic element within the culture. Also, the Przeworsk culture has been linked to the early Slavs, with recent studies, which looked at the morphological features of skeletal remains, suggesting that populations of the Przeworsk, Wielbark, and Cherniakhovo cultures from the Roman period bore closer similarities to the early medieval West Slavs than to the medieval Germanic-speaking populations. Another  archaeological study rejected a connection with and continuity of the early Slavs.\nDecline\nThe culture's decline in the late 5th century coincides with the invasion of the Huns. Other factors may have included the social crisis that occurred as a result of the collapse of the Roman world and the trade contacts it maintained with peoples beyond its borders. In the late 5/6th century, the early Slavic Prague-Korchak culture appears in the Vistula basin.\nGallery\nFile:02019 0554 (2) Ancient Germanic belt buckles, Untersiebenbrunn style, Przeworsk culture, around 400 AD.jpg|Gold belt buckles, c. 400 AD\nFile:Germanic belt buckle 450 AD Przeworsk Culture, Cracow, photo by Silar.JPG|Belt buckle, c. 450 AD\nFile:02021 0004 Ancient Vandalic style instructions and inspiration, Przemysl, Przeworsk culture area in the San river basin.jpg|Museum display and reconstruction\nFile:020210828 Przeworsk Culture storage vessel from 4th-5th century, discovered in 1937 at Turowa, near Mała Panew River.jpg|Ceramic storage vessel\nFile:02020 Germanic homestead, Przeworsk culture, 3rd-4th century works, reconstruction.jpg|Germanic homestead, Przeworsk culture, 3rd-4th century\nFile:0144 Przeworsk culture c. 250 BC.jpg|Recreations of various bladed iron tools from around 250 BC, including a sickle\nFile:020220820 140321 przeworsk culture jars.jpg|Przeworsk culture pottery\nSee also\n* Przeworsk culture settlements and burial sites\n* Early Slavs\n* Vandals\n* Amber Road\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n* Cieśliński, Adam (2023).
