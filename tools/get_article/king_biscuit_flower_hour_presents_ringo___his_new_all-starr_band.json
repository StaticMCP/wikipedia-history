While Mark Rivera remained from the previous band, the new players for the 2001 US tour here include Emerson, Lake & Palmer's Greg Lake, Mott the Hoople's Ian Hunter and - bringing a more updated sound to the proceedings - Supertramp's Roger Hodgson, Howard Jones and former Prince bandmember Sheila E. Starr naturally has the biggest share of the songs, performing his classic hits from the 1960s and 1970s - with the relatively recent \"Don't Go Where the Road Don't Go\" from 1992's Time Takes Time, with all his celebrity guests each having their moment in the spotlight.\nReception\nKing Biscuit Flower Hour Presents Ringo & His New All-Starr Band was fairly well received by the critics upon its August 2002 release, though again, it failed to reach the charts.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n* Greg Lake – bass, vocals, acoustic guitar\n* Howard Jones – keyboards, vocals\n* Ian Hunter – guitar, vocals, piano\n* Roger Hodgson – guitar, vocals, piano\n* Sheila E. – drums, percussion, vocals\n* Mark Rivera – saxophone, guitar, bass, keyboard, harmonica, flute, percussion, vibraslap, backing vocals, musical director\nReferences\n; Footnotes\n; Citations"
