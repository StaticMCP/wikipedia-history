Built in 1915, it was designed by prominent Nevada architect Frederic Joseph DeLongchamps for Minden founder H. F. Dangberg, as the headquarters of the Dangberg Land and Livestock Company. Carson Valley farmers stored wool and potatoes there to be shipped out of Minden. It was later rented to the Minden Flour Company and a local creamery. It is now an office building for the Bently Nevada Corporation.\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 6, 1986.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
