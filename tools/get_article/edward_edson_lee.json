He got his start as a writer writing serialized stories, most notably in The American Boy magazine.  His first book, Andy Blake in Advertising, was published in 1922 (reprinted in 1928 as the first volume in the Andy Blake series).\nHe wrote five series of books: the Jerry Todd series of sixteen books; the Poppy Ott series of eleven books; the Trigger Berg series of four books; the Andy Blake series of four books; and the Tuffy Bean series of four books. All of the series were interrelated in some way; the Todd and Ott stories took place in the town of Tutter, Illinois, a fictional town modeled on the town of Utica, which Lee experienced in his childhood.  The supporting characters in the Todd and Ott books — \"Red\" Meyers, \"Scoop\" Ellery, and \"Peg\" Shaw — were real boys that Lee befriended around the time he began writing the stories while living in Shelby, Ohio.\nEdward Edson Lee is buried in Beloit, Wisconsin.\nLegacy\nInitially forgotten after his death, Lee's books (most of them graced by the gaudy and idiosyncratic illustrations of [https://archive.today/20130222085004/http://mysite.ncnetwork.net/res116wrb/LeoSite/fiction/salg.html Bert Salg]) have become highly valued by juvenile book collectors.\nThe end of each Jerry Todd book had the unusual feature of printed letters from readers and Lee's warm, informal responses to them. This tradition — and intimate tone — was later imitated by Marvel Comics editor/publisher Stan Lee (no relation) in the \"Marvel Bullpen Bulletins\" pages printed in the pages of all Marvel comics.\nThe 1990s power pop band Cockeyed Ghost took its name from one of Edwards' more obscure books, Trigger Berg and the Cock-Eyed Ghost.\nIn his autobiography, \"Where's the Rest of Me?\" Ronald Reagan wrote that, growing up in Tampico, Illinois, he had a boyhood much like Jerry Todd.\nList of works\nAndy Blake series\n#Andy Blake (originally Andy Blake in Advertising) - 1922, republished 1928\n#''Andy Blake's Comet Coaster - 1928\n#Andy Blake's Secret Service - 1929\n#Andy Blake and the Pot of Gold - 1930\nJerry Todd series\n#Jerry Todd and the Whispering Mummy - 1923\n#Jerry Todd and the Rose-Colored Cat - 1924\n#Jerry Todd and the Oak Island Treasure - 1925\n#Jerry Todd and the Waltzing Hen - 1924\n#Jerry Todd and the Talking Frog - 1925\n#Jerry Todd and the Purring Egg - 1925\n#Jerry Todd in the Whispering Cave - 1927\n#Jerry Todd, Pirate - 1928\n#Jerry Todd and the Bob-Tailed Elephant - 1929\n#Jerry Todd, Editor-In-Grief - 1930\n#Jerry Todd, Caveman - 1932\n#Jerry Todd and the Flying Flapdoodle - 1934\n#Jerry Todd and the Buffalo Bill Bathtub - 1936\n#Jerry Todd's Up-The-Ladder Club - 1937\n#Jerry Todd's Poodle Parlor - 1938\n#Jerry Todd's Cuckoo Camp - 1940\nPoppy Ott series\n#Poppy Ott and the Stuttering Parrot - 1926\n#Poppy Ott's Seven-League Stilts - 1926\n#Poppy Ott and the Galloping Snail - 1927\n#Poppy Ott's Pedigreed Pickles - 1927\n#Poppy Ott and the Freckled Goldfish - 1928\n#Poppy Ott and the Tittering Totem - 1929\n#Poppy Ott and the Prancing Pancake - 1930\n#Poppy Ott Hits The Trail - 1933\n#Poppy Ott & Co., Inferior Decorators - 1937\n#The Monkey's Paw - 1938\n#The Hidden Dwarf - 1939\nTrigger Berg series\n#Trigger Berg and the Treasure Tree - 1930\n#Trigger Berg and His 700 Mousetraps - 1930\n#Trigger Berg and the Sacred Pig - 1931\n#Trigger Berg and the Cock-Eyed Ghost - 1933\nTuffy Bean series\n#Tuffy Bean's Puppy Days - 1931\n#Tuffy Bean's One-Ring Circus - 1931\n#Tuffy Bean At Funny Bone Farm - 1931\n#Tuffy Bean and the Lost Fortune'' - 1932\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
