Later he advanced towards Vinnytsia and besieged it, but was unable to capture the city due to a stubborn resistance by Ivan Bohun, famously for his ice treak during the siege. Meanwhile, Bohdan Khmelnytsky found out about the Polish invasion and sent Cossacks from Uman and Poltava regiments under the command of Demian Mnohohrishny (mentioned in the sources as \"Demko Mykhailovych\") to expel the Poles from Eastern Podolia. On 19 of March, Cossacks clashed with the Polish army near Lypovets. Cossack forces encircled the main Polish regiment and completely defeated it.\nAftermath\nThe news of Polish defeat caused panic in Kalinowski's camp, forcing him to lift the siege of Vinnytsia on 20 of March and withdraw from Ukraine to Kamianets. Soon after the battle, Cossacks invaded the Polish territory. Their campaign culminated in the Battle of Berestechko, in which the Cossack-Tatar forces were defeated.\nReferences"
