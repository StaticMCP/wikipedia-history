It is typically served in beer glassware, leaving room for a generous amount of beer head which can take on a pink or cherry-like tone. This drink can be quite sweet and is best enjoyed chilled.\nHistory\nThe Queen Mary was conceived by members of the University of Calgary Dinos men’s swimming team in Calgary, Canada, in the early 2000s. The drink has since become popular in North America, Europe, and Australia as an alternative to a shandy.  The drink is reportedly named after Mary of Teck, Queen Consort to King George V of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions.\nPreparation and serving\nA Queen Mary cocktail is made by pouring grenadine into a beer glass, to taste, followed by beer, leaving room at the top for a thick layer of pink-hued beer foam. Maraschino cherries are often added as a garnish, while drizzling syrup from the cherries onto the beer foam for additional sweetness and colour, as desired.\nWhile any beer can be used to make a Queen Mary, lighter beer styles are generally preferred, such as a lager, pilsner or pale ale. Variants of the drink can also be made by using non-alcoholic beer, or by including additional ingredients such as lemonade.\nSee also\n*Bloody Mary (cocktail)\n*Roy Rogers (drink)\n*Shirley Temple (drink)\nReferences\nExternal links"
