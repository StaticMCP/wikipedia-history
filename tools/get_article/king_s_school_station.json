The street level stop is designed as a small commuter stop, serving area residents who walk to the train so they can be taken toward Downtown Pittsburgh.\nHistory\nA stop was established at Kings School when the Pittsburgh Railways interurban line from Charleroi to Pittsburgh was opened through Bethel Park on September 12, 1903. Passengers initially changed at Castle Shannon to continue their journey to Downtown via the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad. It was cut back to Library in 1953 and was converted from PCC operation to Light Rail in 1988.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080422200249/http://www.portauthority.org/PAAC/CustomerInfo/BuswaysandT/LightRailTransitSystem/TStations/tabid/189/Default.aspx Port Authority T Stations Listings]\n*\n*[https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&ie=UTF8&ll=40.307985,-80.033178&spn=0.00405,0.01339&z=17&layer=c&cbll=40.307985,-80.033178&panoid=Sv46wJBEPscfrWjt8mpViQ&cbp=12,315.97,,0,6.63 Station from Kings School Road from Google Maps Street View]"
