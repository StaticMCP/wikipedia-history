However, the lists often contradict each other and many lists contain incomplete or scattered information. The lists were likely compiled over a long period at several different monasteries. Some historians consider these lists to be untrustworthy. There are a number of legendary figures at the beginning of some lists whose historicity is difficult to confirm or trace. Axumite kings may have used multiple names similar to the later Emperors of the Ethiopian Empire (1270–1974), resulting in different names for the same ruler on different lists.\nAksumite coins have proven useful for constructing a chronology of Axumite kings. Around 98 percent of the city of Axum has not yet been excavated.  At least 18 kings have been identified with coinage covering the period from the late third century to the early seventh century.\nList\nThe following table contains names from both traditional regnal lists and names that are archeologically verified. German August Dillmann grouped the regnal lists into three types and the order of names will be based on his lists. The spelling of certain names are taken from lists recorded by E. A. Wallis Budge. The overall order of monarchs is partially based on the 1922 regnal list of Ethiopia, which is the only official Ethiopian regnal list that attempted to combine names from different lists into a longer chronological order.\nLegendary period\nMonarchs who reigned before Menelik I.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"width:10%;\" |Portrait\n! style=\"width:20%;\" |Name\n! style=\"width:20%;\" |Dates\n! style=\"width:50%;\" |Notes\n|-\n|\n| Arwe \"the serpent\"\n| 18th century BC(traditional)\n| Mythical serpent who reigned for 400 years.Also known as Wainaba.\n|-\n|\n| Angabo\n| 14th century BC(traditional)\n| Killed the evil serpent king Arwe.Ruled for 200 years.\n|-\n|\n| [Za] Gedur I\n| 12th century BC(traditional)\n| Ruled for 100 years.Also known as Zagdur.\n|-\n|\n| Sebado\n| 11th century BC(traditional)\n| Ruled for 50 years.\n|-\n|\n| Kawnasya\n| 10th century BC(traditional)\n| Ruled for 1 year.\n|-\n|\n| [Za] Makeda / Azeb\n| 10th century BC(traditional)\n| Daughter of Kawnasya.
