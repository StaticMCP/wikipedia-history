Harding was inaugurated as the 29th president of the United States on March 4, 1921, and served as president until his death on August 2, 1923, 881 days later. During his presidency, he organized international disarmament agreements, addressed major labor disputes, enacted legislation and regulations pertaining to veterans' rights, and traveled west to visit Alaska.\nHarding inherited the aftermath of World War I after taking office in 1921, requiring him to formally end American involvement and participate in the polarized discussion of veterans' affairs, including the debate surrounding the Bonus Bill. The massive scale of World War I would prompt him to organize the Washington Naval Conference to promote disarmament. He also inherited labor disputes that would persist throughout his presidency, some of which escalated into riots and armed insurrections. Harding toured the Southern United States in October 1921 to speak in favor of civil rights.\nIn 1922, Harding worked to support and encourage ratification of the Four-Power Treaty that came of the Washington Naval Conference. His administration was beset by scandal in March 1922 after the president dismissed officials at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and the events of the larger Teapot Dome scandal began the following month when the Department of the Interior leased the Teapot Dome oil reserves to Harry Ford Sinclair. Harding was forced to personally broker agreements amidst coal and rail strikes that escalated into violence in the summer of 1922. His activities as president were subdued in the final months of 1922 after his wife fell seriously ill.\nIn 1923, Harding formally ended the American occupation of Germany and negotiated the payment of World War I reparations. In June 1923, he undertook a months-long Voyage of Understanding to tour the Western United States and the Territory of Alaska, also visiting British Columbia. He fell ill and died during this trip on August 2, 1923.\nThe timeline below includes notable events that took place during Harding's presidency, including the president's travels, speaking engagements, and notable meetings, as well as major government actions and other historical events that directly affected the presidency.\n1921\nMarch 1921\n* March 4 – The inauguration of Warren G.
