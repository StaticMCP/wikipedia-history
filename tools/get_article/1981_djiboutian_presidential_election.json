Earlier in the year, the country had been declared a one-party state with the People's Rally for Progress as the only legally permitted party. RPP leader Hassan Gouled Aptidon, who had been president since independence in 1977, was the sole candidate on the ballot, and was re-elected with 84.58% of the total votes cast.\nResults\nReferences"
