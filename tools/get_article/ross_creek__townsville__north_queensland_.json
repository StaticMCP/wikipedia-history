The creek is located in the lower reaches of the river catchment, in the city confines of Townsville, in North Queensland, Australia.\nCourse and features\nThe only passage across Ross Creek was by ferry until Victoria Bridge was completed in 1889. Ross Creek was the only port for Townsville until 1892, at which time the outer harbour was constructed. Vessels from interstate and overseas moored in Cleveland Bay and passengers were transferred to the northern shore of the creek by lighters.\nSee also\n}}\n* Rivers of Queensland\nReferences"
