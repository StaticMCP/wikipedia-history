However Troop Carrier Command and Air Technical Service Command (ATSC) commanded several other airfields in a support role.\nIt is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor Airfields\nTroop Carrier Command\n* Pope Field, Fort Bragg, Fayetteville\n: 92d Army Air Force Base Unit (I TCC)\n: Was: Pope Air Force Base\n: Now: Pope Field\n* Laurinburg-Maxton Army Air Base, Maxton\n: 392d Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Glider training facility\nThird Air Force\n* Morris Field, Charlotte\n: 30th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Now: Charlotte Douglas International Airport and\n: Now:  Charlotte Air National Guard Base\n* Seymour Johnson Field, Goldsboro\n: 333d Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Now:  Seymour Johnson Air Force Base\n* Bluethenthal Field, Wilmington\n: 423d Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Now: Wilmington International Airport\nArmy Air Force Training CommandAAF Southeast Training Center\n* Asheville-Hendersonville Army Air Field, Hendersonville\n: Joint Use USAAF/Contract Flying School\n: Also used by United States Navy\n* Lindley Field/Greensboro-High Point MAP, Greensboro\n: Joint Use Civil Airport/USAAF/United States Navy\n* Winston-Salem Airport, Winston-Salem\n: Joint Use Civil Airport/USAAF/United States Navy\nAir Technical Service Command\n* Raleigh-Durham AAF, Raleigh\nReferences\n* Maurer, Maurer (1983).
