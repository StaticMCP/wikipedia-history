It is based on the 1979 novel Moviola by Garson Kanin. Set in late 1930s Hollywood, it is about the search for the actress to play Scarlett O'Hara in the much anticipated film adaptation of Gone with the Wind (1939). This film premiered as the finale of a three-night TV miniseries on NBC called Moviola: A Hollywood Saga.\nPlot\nMargaret Mitchell's novel Gone with the Wind is published in 1936 and is an instant nationwide sensation. The movie rights are up for grabs, and every studio in Hollywood wants it. While having lunch at the MGM dining room, Louis B. Mayer is talking to his son-in-law David O. Selznick about the film rights. In time, Selznick establishes his own production company, Selznick International Pictures, and wants his studio to have a film that will cement both its fame and his.\nBack at MGM, Joan Crawford is negotiating the idea of her portraying the acclaimed heroine, even getting Selznick to come back to her place to spend the night to \"seal the deal.\" However, other actresses must be tested in order to expand possibilities. One of the first to do this is Paulette Goddard and her screen test is the most praised out of them all. Tallulah Bankhead comes down from New York City and auditions for the role and although she herself is a Southerner who could easily play the part, Selznick decides to give her more tests and seek other candidates. But when Louella Parsons gets wind of this, she misinforms her radio audience that Tallulah has gotten the part, thanks to the influential power of her father William Brockman Bankhead, who at the time was the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. When this is announced, Joan Crawford throws her radio at a mirror and Paulette makes a beeline to the study of her lover, Charlie Chaplin, announcing that Tallulah has gotten the part.\nAfter this error has been cleared and the actresses have been reassured that the role is still up for grabs, the casting process continues. One day while Clark Gable and Myron Selznick are hunting, Gable mentions that he is being considered for the role of Rhett Butler. Fleming agrees that Gable would be an appropriate choice but Gable is uncertain about accepting the role because the film is to be directed by George Cukor, often considered \"a woman's director\". Gable first tries to withdraw from the very idea but later goes forth with the role after Louis B. Mayer threatens him with a suspension. It isn't long before Gable's love interest Carole Lombard is considered for the part.\nOne night at the Selznick lot, a party is thrown to honor the actresses who are closest to winning the role of Scarlett and entertaining such stars as Joan Bennett, Margaret Sullavan, Jean Arthur, and Miriam Hopkins. Tallulah Bankhead is there, too, sitting at the table saying to herself, \"Oh God, when will it ever stop?\". While at this party, George Cukor is talking with the actresses, seeing if they would be interested to star in his upcoming film The Women after Gone With The Wind is filmed. When Cukor asks Bankhead if she would entertain appearing in The Women, her response is one of disbelief - why would any actress appear in a movie with \"No men ... at all?\"  When it comes time to have dinner at the party, Tallulah and Carole, who are sitting with Selznick between them, decide to get back at the producer for putting them through this acting contest. They stand up to make an announcement, pour their soup bowls onto his head, and declare, \"Frankly my dear we don't give a damn\". Laughter ensues.\nLater in 1938 Selznick has still not decided who he'll have as his Scarlett after Paulette Goddard is denied the part for failing to verify whether she is married to Charlie Chaplin. As the burning of Atlanta scene is to begin for a test sequence, his brother Myron Selznick arrives with a new actress. When he directs Selznick to look at her, David first refuses but after more badgering finally submits. When the young actress removes her hat, he sees the beautiful Vivien Leigh and informs her that she is his Scarlett. The rest is film history.\nCast\n* Tony Curtis as David O.
