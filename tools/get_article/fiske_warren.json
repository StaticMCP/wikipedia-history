As part of a philanthropic and well educated family, the Warren brothers and sister all enjoyed tranquil childhoods growing up between the family homes in Boston and Waltham, also known as \"Cedar Hill\".

He operated the first \"electric carriage\" seen in Massachusetts in 1891.\nMarried life\nOn May 14, 1891, he married Gretchen Osgood, daughter of Dr. Hamilton and Margaret Cushing (Pearmain) Osgood at Trinity Church in Boston.
