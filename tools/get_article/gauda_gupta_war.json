The war resulted in the defeat of the Gauda Kingdom.\nBackground\nAccording to the Aphsad inscription of Ādityasena (seventh century) Kumaragupta (fourth King of the dynasty) was contemporary to the Maukhari King Ishanavarman. It is probable the first three Later Gupta Kings were contemporary to the first three Maukhari Kings. It is further proven that the second King (Adityavarman) married Harshaguptā, the sister of the second Later Gupta King (Harshagupta).\nThe War\nIshanavarman may have been the contemporary of Jivitagupta I, who is known to have won against his enemies whether they stood on the Himalayas or on seashore (including the Gauda Kingdom). Ishanavarman also was victorious against the Gaudas. It likely possible that both of them defeated the same foes, the Gaudas. Ishanavarman is stated to have forced them to stay at their proper realm:\nGopachandra was most likely the contemporary ruler of the Gaudas who ruled over a portion of West Bengal and fought against Ishanavarman and Jivitagupta I. Eventually, Gopachandra was driven back to the Deltaic region to the east of Bhāgīrathī. Jivitagupta probably fought against the independent Vanga Kingdom as well.\nAftermath\nRise of Varmans\nBhutivarman's grandson, Sthitavarman (566–590), enjoyed victories over the Gauda Kingdom of Karnasuvarna and performed two aswamedha ceremonies suggests that the Kamarupa kingdom had recovered nearly in full. His son, Susthitavarman (590–600) came under the attack of Mahasenagupta of East Malwa. These back and forth invasions were a result of a system of alliances that pitted the Kamarupa kings (allied to the Maukharis) against the Gaur kings of Bengal (allied with the East Malwa kings). Susthitavarman died as the Gaur invasion was on, and his two sons, Suprathisthitavarman and Bhaskarvarman fought against an elephant force and were captured and taken to Gaur. They were able to regain their kingdom due probably to a promise of allegiance. Later near the sixth century, Bhaskara-varman of Kamarupa, repulsed Gauda forces.\nRise of Shashanka\nSome historians believe that Shashanka began his career as a feudatory chief (maha samanta) under Mahasenagupta, of the Later Gupta Dynasty. And that after the death of Mahasenagupta, Shashanka drove the later Guptas and other prominent nobles out of the region and established his own kingdom with his capital at Karnasubarna. Other historians like Sailendra Nath Sen is of the opinion that Mahasenagupta - already under pressure from the Maukharis (for failing to provide adequate protection) - wouldn't have knowingly appointed Shashanka to such an important position. Middleton (2015) argues in a similar vein that Shashanka served as maha samanta to a Gauda king, possibly Jayanaga.\nWhether Shashanka was a feudatory under the Maukharis or the Guptas is not known. By 605 C.E. following Mahasenagupta's death, Shashanka had established what became known as the Gauda Kingdom. From there, he issued gold coins to celebrate his triumph, and came to be addressed as Maharajadhiraja.\nNotes\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
