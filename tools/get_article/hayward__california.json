With a population of 162,954 as of 2020, Hayward is the sixth largest city in the Bay Area, and the third largest in Alameda County. Hayward was ranked as the 36th most populous municipality in California. It is included in the San Francisco–Oakland–San Jose Metropolitan Statistical Area by the US Census. It is located primarily between Castro Valley, San Leandro and Union City, and lies at the eastern terminus of the San Mateo–Hayward Bridge. The city was devastated early in its history by the 1868 Hayward earthquake. From the early 20th century until the beginning of the 1980s, Hayward's economy was dominated by its now defunct food canning and salt production industries.\nName\nHayward was originally known as \"Hayward's\", then as \"Haywood\", later as \"Haywards\", and eventually as \"Hayward\". There is some disagreement as to how it was named. Most historians believe it was named for William Dutton Hayward (1815–1891), who opened a hotel there in 1852. William Hayward eventually became the road commissioner for Alameda County. He used his authority to influence the construction of roads in his own favor. He was also an Alameda County supervisor. The United States Geological Survey's Geographic Names Information System states the city was named after Alvinza Hayward, a millionaire from the California Gold Rush. Regardless of which Hayward the area was named for, the name was changed to \"Haywood\" when the post office was first established in 1860.\nIn 1876, a town was chartered by the State of California under the name of \"Haywards\". The name of the post office was then able to change because of the loss of the apostrophe before the \"s\". This change occurred in 1880. In 1911, the town was officially renamed Hayward, dropping the \"s\". However, the United States Board on Geographic Names would not recognize this name change until 1931.\nHistory\nEarly history\nHuman habitation of the greater East Bay, including Hayward, dates from at least 4000 BC. The most recent pre-European inhabitants of the Hayward area were the Native American Ohlone people.\n19th century\n, a noted Californio ranchero, owned Rancho San Lorenzo, which made up the modern cities of Hayward, Castro Valley, and San Lorenzo.]]\nIn the 19th century, the land that is now Hayward became part of Rancho San Lorenzo, a Spanish land grant to Guillermo Castro, in 1841. The site of his home was on the former El Camino Viejo, or Castro Street (now Mission Boulevard) between C and D Streets, but the structure was severely damaged in the 1868 Hayward earthquake, with the Hayward Fault running directly under its location. Most of the city's structures were destroyed in the earthquake, the last major earthquake on the fault. In 1930, that site was chosen for the construction of the City Hall, which served the city until 1969. A post office opened in 1860, followed by the town's incorporation in 1876.\nHayward grew steadily throughout the late 19th century, with an economy based on agriculture and tourism. Important crops were tomatoes, potatoes, peaches, cherries, and apricots. Hunt Brothers Cannery opened in 1895. Chicken and pigeon raising also played important roles in the economy. A rail line between Oakland and San Jose, the South Pacific Coast Railroad, was established but later destroyed in the 1868 earthquake. The Hayward shore of the Bay was developed into extensive salt evaporation ponds, and was one of the most productive areas in the world, with Leslie Salt being one of the largest companies.\n20th century\nThe San Mateo–Hayward Bridge opened in 1929, connecting the city to the San Francisco Peninsula.\nDuring the 1930s, the Harry Rowell Rodeo Ranch, now within the bounds of Castro Valley, drew rodeo cowboys from across the continent, and Western movie actors such as Slim Pickens and others from Hollywood.\nID tag on Reverend Sui Hiro of the San Lorenzo Holiness Church. Hayward, 1942]]\nPrior to World War II, Hayward had a high concentration of Japanese Americans, who were subject to the Japanese-American internment during the war. The war brought an economic and population boom to the area, as factories opened to manufacture war material. Many of the workers stayed after the end of the war. Two suburban tract housing pioneers, Oliver Rousseau and David D. Bohannon, were prominent builders of postwar housing in the area.\nThe Hayward Area Recreation and Park District was formed in 1944.\nCalifornia State University, Hayward opened in the Hayward Hills in 1957. Southland Mall was dedicated in 1964.\nThe second San Mateo–Hayward Bridge opened in 1967. The City Center Building opened in 1969 and acted as the new city hall until 1989 when the Loma Prieta earthquake damaged the building and forced the city government to move out. The building was closed to the public in 1998, with the new Hayward City Hall opening the same year. Bay Area Rapid Transit began operating in the Bay Area in 1972, with stations in downtown Hayward and south Hayward.\nThe Hunt Brothers Cannery closed in 1981.\n21st century\nThe city's downtown area was slated for redevelopment in 2012 and 2013, with landscaping, new businesses opening up, and older ones getting façade upgrades.\nThe Warren Hall on the California State University, East Bay campus and the City Center Building downtown were demolished in 2013.\nThe Russell City Energy Center began operating in 2013 at the Hayward shoreline.\nIn May 2015, the city's former shoreline landfill was declared a site for conversion to a solar farm, set to generate enough electricity to power 1,200 homes. It will be one of 186 sites in the Regional Renewable Energy Procurement Project.\nIn October 2015, construction began for the Hayward 21st Century Library and Heritage Plaza. The library opened in September 2019, and the plaza was originally expected to open sometime in 2019.\nFormer communities\nMount Eden was a former city that was incorporated into Hayward in the 1950s, at the same time as Schafer Park.\nRussell City was a former unincorporated community. It existed from 1853 until 1964. It is now the location of an industrial park. The Russell City Energy Center, a 429-megawatt natural gas-fired power plant built by Calpine, is located there.\nStokes Landing, Hayward Heath, and Eden Landing were communities now within Hayward city limits.\nGeography\nHayward borders on many municipalities and communities. The cities bordering on Hayward are San Leandro, Union City, Fremont, and Pleasanton. The census-designated places bordering on Hayward are Castro Valley, San Lorenzo, Cherryland, Sunol, and Fairview. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of .  of it is land and  of it (comprising 28.5%) is water. The San Lorenzo Creek runs through the city.\nThe Hayward Fault Zone runs through much of Hayward, including the downtown area. The United States Geological Survey has stated that there is an \"increasing likelihood\" of a major earthquake on this fault zone, with potentially serious resulting damage. Hayward's historic city hall lies atop the fault line and was closed due to damage from gradual seismic activity. A street curb in Hayward that ran perpendicular to the fault was used for over 40 years by local geologists to record the movement of the plates; it had drifted  out of alignment by the time it was inadvertently removed by the city government in 2016.\nAerial view of Hayward in 2021.jpg|Industrial areas on west side of city\nIMAG3058-south-hayward-hills.jpg|South Hayward Hills\nIMAG3060-south-hayward-bart.jpg|Hayward, California - South Hayward BART station and surrounding area\nIMAG3061-south-hayward.jpg|South Hayward\nIMAG3064-hayward-880-92-interchange-southland-mall.jpg|Interchange of Interstate 880 and California State Route 92\nIMAG3066-hayward-southland-mall-chabot-college.jpg|Southland Mall and Chabot College\nHayward Executive Airport 07820.JPG|Hayward Executive Airport\nClimate\nHayward has a Mediterranean climate, and contains microclimates, both of which are features of the greater Bay Area.

The cannery was opened in Hayward in 1895 by brothers William and Joseph Hunt, who were fruit packers originally from Sebastopol, California. The Hunts initially packed local fruit, including cherries, peaches, and apricots, then added tomatoes, which became the mainstay of their business. At its height in the 1960s and 1970s, Hunt's operated three canneries in Hayward, at A, B, and C Streets; an adjacent can-making company; a pickling factory; and a glass manufacturing plant. From the 1890s until its closure in 1981, Hunt's employed a large percentage of the local population. The air around Hayward was permeated by the smell of tomatoes for three months of each year, during the canning season. The canneries closed in 1981, as there were no longer enough produce fields or fruit orchards near the cannery to make it economically viable. Much of the production was moved to the Sacramento Valley. The location of the former canneries is marked by a historic water tower with the Hayward logo. A housing development now occupies much of the former cannery site.\nGillig Corporation\nGillig, a bus manufacturer, was located in Hayward for more than 80 years before moving to Livermore in 2017.\nOther former businesses\nMuch of the Bay coastal territory of Hayward was turned into salt ponds, with Oliver Salt and Leslie Salt operating there. Much of this land has in recent years been returned to salt marshes. A 1983 image of the ponds appears on a 2012 U.S. postage stamp. The Mervyns department store chain was headquartered in Hayward until it declared bankruptcy in 2008. The Osborne Computer Corporation was headquartered in Hayward and had a manufacturing plant there until it declared bankruptcy in 1983.\nTop employers\nAccording to the city's 2015 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city were (in alphabetical order):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Foster City in foreground, Hayward across San Francisco Bay, Mount Diablo in background (left).]]\nHayward is served by Interstate 880 (also known as the Nimitz Freeway), Interstate 580 with a major intersection near downtown connecting State Route 238 and Interstate 238, State Route 92 (Jackson Street) and State Route 238 (Mission Boulevard/Foothill Boulevard). State Route 92 continues west as the San Mateo–Hayward Bridge. The intersection of 880 and 92 was reconstructed over a four-year period, with completion of the project in October 2011.
