He has been the president of the People's Justice Party since 2018 and has represented Tambun in the Parliament of Malaysia since 2022. Since assuming office as prime minister, Anwar appointed himself as Minister of Finance. Anwar is also the chairman of Pakatan Harapan coalition since 2020.\nBorn in the Crown Colony of Penang during the Malayan Union, Anwar graduated from University of Malaya. Prior to entering politics, he served as president of the National Union of Malaysian Muslim Students and of the Malaysian Islamic Youth Movement. He later joined UMNO, then the dominant party in the long-ruling Barisan Nasional coalition. He became the 7th deputy prime minister in 1993 and served as Minister of Finance from 1991, playing a key role in Malaysia's response to the 1997 Asian financial crisis. In 1998, Anwar was removed from all government posts by then-Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and subsequently led the Reformasi movement against the government. He was jailed in April 1999 on charges of corruption and sodomy, until his release in 2004 after his conviction was overturned. He returned to politics as the 12th leader of the opposition from 2008 to 2015, merging opposition parties into the Pakatan Rakyat (PR) coalition, which contested the 2008 and 2013 general elections. He disputed the 2013 election results and led subsequent protests.\nIn 2014, Anwar attempted to become Menteri Besar of Selangor as part of the Kajang Move, sparking a nine-month political crisis that ended with a five-year prison sentence following a second sodomy conviction in 2015. While in prison, he rejoined Mahathir Mohamad in the new Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition in absentia, which won the 2018 general election. Mahathir planned for Anwar to succeed him as prime minister after an interim period. He was granted a royal pardon by King Muhammad V and released in May 2018. He returned to parliament in the 2018 Port Dickson by-election while his wife, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, served as deputy prime minister in the PH administration. During the 2020–2022 Malaysian political crisis, the PH coalition collapsed, leading to the Perikatan Nasional (PN) government under Muhyiddin Yassin, with Anwar becoming the opposition leader for a second term from 2020 to 2022.\nFollowing the 2022 general election, where Pakatan Harapan won a plurality of seats, Anwar was sworn in as prime minister on 24 November 2022. On 2 December 2022, he appointed MPs from PH, Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS), and UMNO as ministers in a unity government cabinet, retaining the finance portfolio for himself. His government has faced criticism for conservative policies and controversies including the discharge not amounting to acquittal of Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and the reduction of former prime minister Najib Razak's prison sentence. As ASEAN chairman since January 2025, Anwar facilitated a ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia, addressing the border dispute through regional diplomatic channels.\nAnwar is widely regarded as a liberal reformer and intellectual. He has advocated for Islamic democracy and hopes Malaysia can serve as an example of democratic governance in the Muslim world. He supports the Islamic concept of Ummah as a framework for democracy in Muslim countries and emphasizes judicial independence, good governance, and rejection of authoritarianism. While initially supporting affirmative action policies for Malays as a youth activist, he later criticized Ketuanan Melayu and called for need-based affirmative policies and poverty support. During his imprisonment and trials, he was described as a \"uniting figure\" for the opposition. As prime minister, he has emphasised implementing measures such as diesel subsidy cuts for fiscal responsibility.\nEarly life and education\nAnwar bin Ibrahim was born on 10 August 1947 in Cherok Tok Kun, Bukit Mertajam, Crown Colony of Penang, Malayan Union. However, he also stated that he was born in Sungai Bakap, Seberang Perai Selatan, Crown Colony of Penang, Malayan Union during state election in 2023. His father, Ibrahim bin Abdul Rahman, started his career as a hospital porter, and later joined politics as a member of  UMNO.\nIbrahim won election as Seberang Tengah MP in 1959 and 1964, serving as the parliamentary secretary to the ministry of health from 1964 until his defeat in the 1969 general election by Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia candidate Mustapha Hussain. Anwar's mother, Che Yan binti Hussein, was a housewife active in UMNO grassroots politics in Penang who served as head of the UMNO Women for Bukit Mertajam division in Penang.\nAnwar attended three primary schools, Sekolah Melayu Sungai Bakap (1955), Sekolah Melayu Cherok Tok Kun (1957) and Sekolah Rendah Stowell, Bukit Mertajam (1959) and undertook his secondary education at Bukit Mertajam High School (Malay: SMK Tinggi Bukit Mertajam) before continuing at Malay College Kuala Kangsar (MCKK). He attended Bukit Mertajam High School for three years, where he excelled academically. Anwar was selected to take a special examination for entry into Malay College Kuala Kangsar, one of only three students from Penang to be chosen for this prestigious institution. While at MCKK, he has been involved in various organised activities and represented MCKK in the debate competition between schools. He was also active in the Malay Language Association and his school oratory representative. While studying there, he got to know many future political leaders, like Sanusi Junid, Kamaruddin Jaafar and Yahaya Ahmad. He was the St John Ambulance's youth cadet. He also served as the Secretary of the Badan Revolusi Agama Association, where the Chairman was Sanusi Junid, his senior.\nAnwar later pursued higher education at the University of Malaya, earning a bachelor's degree of arts (BA) in Malay Studies. Anwar also worked on his Master of Arts (MA) in Literature through the National University of Malaysia while imprisoned from 1974 to 1975.\nEarly years and activism (1968–1982)\nFrom 1968 to 1971, as a student, Anwar was the president of the National Union of Malaysian Muslim Students. Around the same time, he was also the president of the University of Malaya Malay Language Society Persatuan Bahasa Melayu Universiti Malaya (PBMUM)). In 1971, he was a member of the pro tem committee of Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia (ABIM) or Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia, which he co-founded. At the same time, he was elected as the 2nd President of the Malaysian Youth Council or Majlis Belia Malaysia (MBM).\nIn 1974, Anwar was arrested during student protests against rural poverty and hunger. This came as a report surfaced stating that a family died from starvation in a village in Baling, in the state of Kedah, which was later demonstrated to be false. However, the rubber tappers in Baling were experiencing severe hardship as the price of rubber dropped in 1974. He was imprisoned under the Internal Security Act (ISA), which allowed for detention without trial and spent 20 months in the Kamunting Detention Centre.\nFrom 1975 until 1982, he served as a representative for Asia Pacific of the World Assembly of Muslim Youth (WAMY).\nAnwar Ibrahim is also the co-founder of the International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT) in the USA (founded in 1981). Anwar has been one of four acting directors, a board member of IIIT and a trustee. He was also a chancellor of International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) between 1988 and 1998.\nEarly political career (1982–1993)\nIn 1982, Anwar, who was the founding leader and second president of ABIM, joined the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), which was led by Mahathir Mohamad, who had become prime minister in 1981. Anwar's decision was influenced by the advice of Palestinian-American scholar Ismail al-Faruqi, who recognised the Mahathir administration's commitment to its Islamization agenda.\nIn the 1982 general election, he was elected as the MP for Permatang Pauh, which was created in the 1974 redistribution from parts of the Seberang Tengah constituency that his father had represented from 1959 to 1969. He defeated a candidate from PAS, even though the seat was regarded as a PAS stronghold.\nAnwar rapidly rose to high-ranking positions; he first entered cabinet in 1982 as Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's Department; his first ministerial office was that of Minister of Culture, Youth and Sports in 1983; after that, he headed the Agriculture Ministry in 1984 before becoming Minister of Education in 1986.\nDuring his tenure as education minister, Anwar introduced numerous policies in the national school curriculum. One of his major changes was to rename the national language from Bahasa Malaysia to Bahasa Melayu, a decision later reverted in 2007 under the premiership of Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. Analysts and politicians have also attributed the rise in social conservatism and Islamism among Malays to the reforms and Islamisation of the education system done under Anwar, with former law minister Zaid Ibrahim labelling Anwar an \"Islamist\".\nAs education minister, Anwar was elected as the 25th President of UNESCO's General Conference. In 1988, Anwar Ibrahim became the second President of IIUM.\nIn 1991, Anwar was appointed as Minister of Finance. During his tenure as finance minister, his impact was immediate; Malaysia enjoyed unprecedented prosperity and economic growth. Shortly after becoming Finance Minister, Euromoney named him as a top-four finance minister and in 1996 Asiamoney named him Finance Minister of the Year. In the midst of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Anwar, as a deputy prime minister and finance minister, was hailed for guiding Malaysia through the period of instability. Anwar backed free-market principles and highlighted the proximity of business and politics in Malaysia. He advocated greater accountability, refused to offer government bail-outs and instituted widespread spending cuts. In March 1998, Anwar was selected as the Chairman of the Development Committee of World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) from March 1998 until September 1998.\nDeputy premiership (1993–1998)\nIn 1993, he became Mahathir's deputy prime minister after beating Abdul Ghafar Baba for the position of Deputy President in UMNO. Anwar's allusions in public to his \"son-father\" relationship with Mahathir contributed to view that he was to be Mahathir's successor.\nIn May 1997, Mahathir appointed Anwar as Acting Prime Minister while he embarked on a two-month working holiday. In Mahathir's absence, Anwar had independently taken radical steps, which directly conflicted with Mahathir's policies, to change the country's governing mechanisms. Issues such as how Malaysia would respond to a financial crisis were often at the forefront of this conflict. Towards the end of the 1990s, his relationship with Mahathir began to deteriorate, triggered by their conflicting views on governance.\n(right) meets with Anwar Ibrahim (left) at the Pentagon 1998.]]\nFinancial crisis\nDuring the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, Anwar supported the IMF plan as a finance minister. He also instituted an austerity package that cut government spending by 18%, cut ministerial salaries and deferred major projects. \"Mega projects\", despite being a cornerstone of Mahathir's development strategy, were greatly curtailed.\nAlthough many Malaysian companies faced bankruptcy, Anwar declared: \"There is no question of any bailout. The banks will be allowed to protect themselves and the government will not interfere.\" Anwar advocated a free-market approach to the crisis, including foreign investment and trade liberalisation. Mahathir blamed currency speculators like George Soros for the crisis and supported currency controls and tighter regulation of foreign investment.\nFall from power and first sodomy conviction\nIn 1998 the Newsweek magazine named Anwar the \"Asian of the Year\" in spite of being beaten by the then Inspector General of Police. However, in that year, matters between Anwar and Mahathir came to a head around the quadrennial UMNO General Assembly. The Youth wing of UMNO, headed by Anwar's associate Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, gave notice that it would initiate a debate on \"cronyism and nepotism\".  At the General Assembly, a book by Khalid Jafri, \"50 Dalil Kenapa Anwar Tidak Boleh Jadi PM\" (\"50 Reasons Why Anwar Cannot Become Prime Minister\") was circulated containing graphic allegations of homosexuality, as well as accusations of corruption against Anwar. Khalid Jafri was an ex-editor of the government-controlled newspaper Utusan Malaysia and former editor-in-chief of a failed magazine, Harian National. Anwar obtained a court injunction to prevent further distribution of the book and filed a lawsuit against the author for defamation. Police charged the author of the book with malicious publishing of false news. The police were instructed to investigate the veracity of the claims.\nOn 2 September 1998, Anwar was fired from the Cabinet, and many reports state that he was under investigation for sodomy, an act that is illegal in Malaysia. The following day, he was expelled from UMNO. In what the Sydney Morning Herald termed a blatantly political fix-up, Anwar was arrested on 20 September 1998 and detained without trial under the country's controversial Internal Security Act (ISA). Weeks later, Anwar was charged with corruption for  allegedly interfering with his own police investigation. While he was in police custody in 1998, Anwar was beaten by the then Inspector General of Police, Abdul Rahim Mohd Noor. The public and the media only witnessed his black eye after being brought to Court for the first time. Rahim was subsequently found guilty of assault and jailed for two months in 2000. He made a public apology to Anwar and paid undisclosed damages.\nDuring the trial, a mattress supposedly stained with Anwar's semen was presented to the court as DNA evidence of Anwar's sexual acts. Anwar denied having anything to do with the mattress, although the DNA tests came out positive. Lim Kong Boon, a DNA chemist, testified during the trial that DNA taken from 10 of 13 semen stains on the mattress matched Anwar's DNA. The defence team implied that DNA samples may have been taken from Anwar, while unconscious, after his beating in police custody, to create false forensics evidence to frame Anwar; however, High Court Judge Augustine Paul accepted that DNA evidence.\nThe High Court eventually handed down its decision in April 1999, sentencing Anwar to six years' imprisonment for corruption and sodomy. Two months later, he was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment for sodomy, which he was ordered to serve after completing his six-year sentence for corruption. His trial and conviction were widely discredited by the international community. Amnesty International stated that the trial proceedings \"''exposed a pattern of political manipulation of key state institutions including the police, public prosecutor's office and the judiciary\" and declared Anwar a prisoner of conscience, stating that he had been arrested in order to silence him as a political opponent.\nThe Federal Court overturned his conviction and Anwar was finally released from solitary confinement on 2 September 2004.\nReformasi and formation of KEADILAN (1998–1999)\nShortly after Anwar was dismissed as deputy prime minister, Anwar and his supporters initiated the Reformasi movement. It consisted of several mass demonstrations and rallies against the long-standing Barisan Nasional coalition government.\nReformasi led to the formation of a new multiracial-based party named Parti Keadilan Nasional or National Justice Party (KEADILAN). In 1999, a general election was held. The new KEADILAN, Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), and Democratic Action Party (DAP) formed a Barisan Alternatif or Alternative Front (BA), in a combined initiative to replace the standing Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition government. In August 2003, KEADILAN merged with Parti Rakyat Malaysia'' or Malaysian's People Party (PRM) to form Parti Keadilan Rakyat or People's Justice Party (PKR) headed by Wan Azizah as president. PKR made huge gains in the 2008 general election, winning 31 seats and becoming the parliament's largest opposition party. In April 2008, PKR, PAS and DAP formed a new alliance named Pakatan Rakyat (PR).\nInterim years (1999–2007)\nFirst sodomy conviction\nIn 1999, Anwar brought suit against Prime Minister Mahathir for defamation for allegedly uttering accusations of immoral acts and calling Anwar a homosexual at a news conference in Malaysia.\nThe sodomy verdict was overturned in 2004, resulting in Anwar's release from prison as he had already served his sentence for the corruption offence. Anwar successfully sued Khalid Jafri for his 50 Dalil Kenapa Anwar Tidak Boleh Jadi PM book, but Khalid died in 2005 of complications from diabetes before the High Court found that he had committed libel and awarded Anwar millions of ringgit in compensation. The Federal Court on 8 March 2010 ruled that the 1998 dismissal of Anwar from his Cabinet posts by Mahathir was constitutional and valid, meaning Anwar had failed in his bid to challenge his sacking.\nAn appeal on the corruption charges was heard on 6 September 2004. Under Malaysian law, a person is banned from political activities for five years after the end of his sentence. Success in this appeal would have allowed him to return to politics immediately. On 7 September, the court agreed to hear Anwar's appeal. However, on 15 September, the Court of Appeal ruled unanimously that its previous decision to uphold a High Court ruling that found Anwar guilty was in order, relegating Anwar to the sidelines of Malaysian politics until 14 April 2008. The only way for Anwar to have been freed from this structure would have been for him to receive a pardon from the King of Malaysia.\nTeaching and non-profit work\nAfter his release from prison, Anwar held teaching positions at St Antony's College, Oxford, where he was a visiting fellow and senior associate member, at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, D.C., as a Distinguished Senior Visiting Fellow, and in 2005–2006 as a visiting professor at the Prince Alwaleed Center for Muslim–Christian Understanding in the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University. In March 2006 he was appointed as Honorary President of the London-based organisation AccountAbility (Institute of Social and Ethical AccountAbility).\nIn July 2006, Anwar was elected Chair of the Washington-based Foundation For the Future. In this capacity, he signed 1 October 2006 letter to Robin Cleveland of the World Bank, requesting the transfer of Shaha Riza from the US Department of State to the Foundation for the Future. This transaction led to Paul Wolfowitz's resignation as president of the organisation. He was one of the signatories of \"A Common Word Between Us and You\" in 2007, an open letter by Islamic scholars to Christian leaders, calling for peace and understanding.\nReturn to politics\nIn November 2006, Anwar announced he planned to run for Parliament in 2008 after his disqualification expired. Anwar was critical of government policies after his release from prison, most notably the New Economic Policy (NEP), which provided affirmative action for the Bumiputras. The policy set a number of quotas, such as for units of housing and initial public offerings, that must be met.\nBefore he became re-entitled to run for Parliament in 2008, he acted as an \"advisor\" of Parti Keadilan Rakyat, the party of which his wife Dr Wan Azizah was president. He was at the forefront in organising a November 2007 mass rally, called the 2007 Bersih Rally, which took place at Dataran Merdeka, Kuala Lumpur, to demand clean and fair elections. The gathering was organised by Bersih, a coalition comprising political parties and civil society groups, and drew supporters from all over the country.\nThe 2008 general election date was set for 8 March 2008, before Anwar's disqualification from politics expired, sparking criticisms that Barisan Nasional called for early elections in a bid to deny Anwar's plans for a return to Parliament. In response, Anwar's wife, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, declared that she would step down should she retain her Permatang Pauh parliamentary seat to force a by-election in which Anwar himself would contest.\nWhen asked about the possibility of Anwar becoming the next Prime Minister, former leader Tun Dr Mahathir reacted by saying, \"He would make a good Prime Minister of Israel\".\nOn 14 April 2008, Anwar celebrated his official return to the political stage, as his ban from public office expired a decade after he was fired as deputy prime minister. The opposition seized a third of parliamentary seats and five states in the worst-ever showing for the Barisan Nasional coalition that has ruled for half a century, with Anwar at the helm. A gathering of more than 40,000 supporters greeted Anwar in a rally welcoming his return to politics. Police interrupted Anwar after he had addressed the rally for nearly two hours and called for him to stop the gathering since there was no legal permission for the rally.\nOn 29 April 2008, after 10 years of absence, he returned to the Parliament, albeit upon invitation as a spouse guest of Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, People's Justice Party and the first female opposition leader in Malaysian Parliament's history.\nPermatang Pauh by-election\nAnwar Ibrahim was victorious in the Permatang Pauh by-election held on 26 August 2008. Muhammad Muhammad Taib, information chief of the UMNO, stated: \"Yes, of course we have lost ... we were the underdogs going into this race.\" Final results announced by the Election Commission revealed that Anwar Ibrahim won 31,195 of the estimated 47,000 votes cast in the district, while Arif Shah Omar Shah received 15,524 votes and a third candidate had 92 votes.\nOn 28 August 2008, Anwar, dressed in a dark blue traditional Malay outfit and black songkok hat, took the oath at the main chamber of Parliament house in Kuala Lumpur, as MP for Permatang Pauh at 10.03&nbsp;am before Speaker Tan Sri Pandikar Amin Mulia. He formally declared Anwar the leader of the 3-party opposition alliance. With his daughter Nurul Izzah Anwar, also a parliamentarian, Anwar announced: \"I'm glad to be back after a decade. The prime minister has lost the mandate of the country and the nation.\" At that time Anwar needed 30 government lawmakers to defect to the Opposition to form the next government.\nFirst term as Leader of the Opposition (2008–2015)\nOn 26 August 2008, Anwar won re-election in the Permatang Pauh by-election and returned to Parliament as Leader of the Opposition. He has stated the need for liberalisation, including an independent judiciary and free media, to combat the endemic corruption that he considers pushes Malaysia close to failed state status.\nPetition against Najib Razak\nAnwar continued to attack Najib on his first day as prime minister, stating he found inconsistencies in the latter's decision to release 13 Internal Security Act (ISA) detainees. He said as long as the ISA existed, Barisan Nasional could still detain citizens at will. In September 2011 Prime Minister Najib Razak acted to abolish the ISA and three other laws. Some members of the opposition did not view this in a positive way.\nParliamentary censure over APCO and 1Malaysia\nAnwar has made numerous remarks about a supposed conspiracy among the Malaysian government, APCO (a public relations firm retained by the Malaysian government), Israel, and the United States. Anwar condemned the Malaysian government for seeking advice from APCO. He claims that the firm is linked to the \"murder of Muslims in Palestine.\" He further claims to have given proof to a disciplinary committee of the Malaysian parliament, investigating his comments, that APCO is a front for the Israeli government. On another occasion, Anwar, speaking from the parliament, claimed that the firm was controlled by Jews and working on behalf of the American government to influence Malaysian foreign policy. He further implied that changes in Malaysian foreign policy could only be explained if Jews were manipulating Malaysia for the United States.\nOn 22 April 2010 Anwar was censured by Malaysia's parliament for remarks he made during a press conference in parliament on 30 March 2010. During the press conference, Anwar claimed to have documents linking 1Malaysia with One Israel and the public relations firm APCO but refused to allow access to the documents when challenged. The Malaysian government and APCO have both strongly denied Anwar's allegations. The censure motion passed by the House of Representatives referred Anwar's case to the Rights and Privileges Committee which will recommend a punishment for approval by the full chamber. Such punishment could include being banned from parliament. However Anwar retaliated against the Malaysian government attacks by producing two documents to support his claims of links between APCO and 1Malaysia.\nAttempts to form a majority coalition\nAnwar has missed several deadlines he personally set for the transfer of power. Anwar said he would need more time, and the recalibration of his message has not gone unnoticed: Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak chose that day to initiate a broadband internet program Anwar opposes, saying that he had not doubted that the government would still be in office on 16 September. Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi too pointed out that Anwar had missed his own deadline, and dismissed his claim to have secured the defection of 30 MPs.\nBy 25 September, Anwar had still not amassed enough votes, creating doubts for Malaysians about whether he was really ready to take power, particularly in light of his failure to meet his own 16 September deadline for the transition of power.  In the interim, UMNO had its own party meeting to broker Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi's step down from power in June 2009, a year earlier than previously promised.\nOn 24 October 2008, Anwar admitted problems with his stalled bid to topple the UMNO's majority, saying that Pakatan Rakyat is running out of options to create a majority. His \"credibility among ordinary Malaysians has been somewhat dented after Sept 16 and the new promise of forming the Government has not generated the sort of anticipation or excitement as before.\" Media within the country have taken an increasingly hostile view towards Anwar's protestations and failed threats to assemble a majority government.\n2013 general election\nIn the 2013 general election (GE13), Anwar Ibrahim, as the Leader of the Opposition, led his Pakatan Rakyat coalition (comprising the three parties DAP, PAS, and PKR) to contest in the election. On 25 February 2013, Pakatan Rakyat launched their manifesto titled ''The People's Manifesto: Pakatan the hope of the people, pledging to reduce their financial burden, among other promises. Anwar, who has taught at Oxford and Georgetown University, said he would return to academic life if he lost the next election to incumbent prime minister Najib Razak.\nPakatan Rakyat did not achieve the regime change target in the election despite obtaining 50.9% of the popular vote compared to the 47.4% gained by Barisan Nasional. This was attributed to the heavy malapportionment of the electoral districts. Pakatan Rakyat also gained 7 more parliamentary seats compared to the 12th general election.\nAnwar did not concede defeat, alleging widespread electoral fraud. Al Jazeera reported that Anwar Ibrahim came close to winning the election on 5 May 2013 but refused to admit defeat, and therefore also did not step down. In an interview for ABC News'', interviewer Jim Middleton suggested that Anwar Ibrahim was going to be the Lee Kuan Yew of the Malaysian opposition. Anwar answered that he was not at that stage yet.\nOn 7 May 2013, Anwar Ibrahim vowed to lead a \"fierce movement\" to reform the country's electoral system and challenge the results of an election he lost. On 8 May 2013, about 120,000 people wearing black gathered at Petaling Jaya Stadium, Kelana Jaya, Selangor, to attend a rally organised by Anwar to protest against the election results and demand a free and fair election. The #Black505 movement continued for another 2 months with touring all over the country. A successful fundraising #Black505 dinner was held in Thean Hou Temple hall on 22 June 2013, hosted by Wangsa Maju MP Datuk Dr Tan Kee Kwong on behalf of PKR. Anwar Ibrahim immediately launched electoral petitions for over 30 disputed parliamentary seats in July 2013. However, the cases were thrown off election court for technical reasons. Anwar described the decision as a bad decision and disgraced the name of the country's judicial institution.\nKajang Move\nOn 27 January 2014, the member of the Selangor State Legislative Assembly for Kajang, Lee Chin Cheh, resigned. This triggered a by-election. A day later, Anwar Ibrahim was announced as Pakatan Rakyat candidate for the by-election. Anwar's candidacy was originally to propel him to become Selangor's Menteri Besar. Later, this move was known as the \"Kajang Move\".\nThis move, however, did not materialise as he was sentenced to five years' prison after Malaysia's Court of Appeal overturned his sodomy acquittal, causing Anwar to lose his qualification to be the state assembly candidate. On 9 March 2014, PKR announced party president Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail as its new candidate for the Kajang by-election. Anwar's Datuk Seri title was stripped by the Sultan of Selangor for \"repeated questioning of the integrity\" of the state's ruler during the subsequent crisis that saw the Sultan refuse to appoint Wan Azizah as Menteri Besar. Anwar was able to continue using the \"Datuk Seri\" title because it had also been conferred on him by several other Malaysian states.\n2008–2014 sodomy trials\nOn 29 June 2008, online news portal Malaysiakini reported that a male aide of Anwar, Saiful Bukhari Azlan, had lodged a police report claiming that he had been sodomised by Anwar. Anwar said that the possibility of a prison sentence as a result of the allegations could be seen as an attempt to remove him from the leadership of the opposition following his growing support and by-election victories. He also reaffirmed his innocence and cited evidence in the form of medical reports. In July 2008, he was arrested over allegations of sodomy again, but was acquitted of the charge in January 2012 by The High Court. The presiding judge ruled that DNA evidence used in the case had been compromised and was unreliable. The prosecution filed an appeal against the acquittal.\nOn 7 March 2014, the Court of Appeal overturned the acquittal by unanimously deciding that the High Court failed to \"critically evaluate\" the evidence submitted by government chemist Dr Seah Lay Hong. The Court of Appeal rushed through a unanimous decision, signed by all three judges, and sentenced Anwar to five years imprisonment, disqualifying him from nomination in the Kajang by-election scheduled on 11 March. The conviction was viewed by some as a politically motivated attempt to prevent Anwar from contesting in the 2014 Kajang by-election, which he was expected to win and becoming Selangor's chief minister. Human Rights Watch and the International Commission of Jurists have accused the Malaysian government of meddling in this particular judicial matter and said the verdict was politically motivated. On 10 February 2015, the Federal Court of Malaysia upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal and affirmed the five-year prison sentence. He was sent immediately to Sungai Buloh Prison, Selangor, to serve the sentence.\nPakatan Harapan backbencher (2018–2020)\nRoyal pardon and release\nAfter the Pakatan Rakyat's dissolution during his imprisonment, a new opposition coalition named the Pakatan Harapan was formed with Anwar as the de facto leader in absentia. The coalition had come into power by overthrowing Barisan Nasional in the 2018 general election (GE14). Following the formation of the new ruling government, Anwar was given a full royal pardon and was released from prison on 16 May 2018. He was designated to take over the reins from interim Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad as planned and agreed by the coalition before GE14. In an interview, he justified his reluctance to immediately step into power on the basis that Mahathir appeared committed to the reform agenda, and was doing a good job tackling a \"disintegrating\" political system. He also added that he was keen to travel and honour speaking engagements. Anwar also indicated that he initially had reservations about Mahathir's \"reconciliation efforts\", but he eventually forgave his former enemy after Mahathir showed \"compassion and concern which (Anwar) thought was absent in the past\".\nReturn to parliament\nAnwar returned to Parliament through the Port Dickson by-election on 13 October 2018, after receiving a royal pardon for a sodomy conviction he maintained was politically motivated. He won the by-election with an increased majority, returning to Parliament for the first time in three years. The seat had been vacated by army veteran Danyal Balagopal Abdullah, a member of parliament for Anwar's PKR.\nSheraton Move and return to opposition\nIn late February 2020, the Pakatan Harapan government collapsed following defections by Anwar's deputy, Azmin Ali, and several MPs aligned to him, along with the withdrawal of BERSATU by Muhyiddin Yassin from the coalition. Mahathir promptly resigned from government, as well as from BERSATU. The political manoeuvring has been labelled the \"Sheraton Move\" for the hotel in Petaling Jaya at which defecting MPs gathered with the opposition to show support for a new government. Following the resignation of Mahathir, Anwar attempted to gather support for his appointment as prime minister. However, BERSATU president, Muhyiddin Yassin, was eventually appointed prime minister, with the support of a slender majority in the Dewan Rakyat. Thus, Pakatan Harapan returned to the opposition, with Anwar being named leader of the opposition.\nSecond term as Leader of the Opposition (2020–2022)\nWhile Muhyiddin formed a government under the auspices of a new coalition known as Perikatan Nasional, Mahathir attempted to regain his post with his Pakatan allies. However, under Anwar's leadership, KEADILAN refused to endorse Mahathir's bid for a third term as premier, claiming the nonagenarian had reneged on his repeated pledge to hand over the office to Anwar. Mahathir, in turn, refused to lend support to Anwar's candidacy, and nominated Sabah Chief Minister, Shafie Apdal, for the position of prime minister instead. Despite the support of allies DAP and Amanah for this compromise, KEADILAN again rejected the proposal and continued to propose Anwar as the coalition's candidate.\nCollaboration with UMNO\nIn September 2020, Anwar attempted to form a new government, claiming that he had amassed a \"formidable\" majority, and submitted the number of 120 members of parliament to the then-Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Abdullah of Pahang. However, this move failed and Anwar, speaking at a party congress in July 2022, claimed that he had been forced to back down after refusing to provide assurances to Barisan Nasional and UMNO leaders that he would discontinue their court cases. Zahid had previously admitted to writing a statutory declaration alongside Najib supporting Anwar for the position as prime minister in October 2020.\nIn April 2021, a four-minute voice recording of a purported conversation between Anwar and Zahid shortly after an UMNO general assembly was leaked online, where the former praised the latter for their speech seeking a mandate from the party's membership to end its alliance with Perikatan Nasional. Despite both Anwar and Zahid's denial of the recording's veracity, Anwar argued it proved no wrongdoing. Zahid later admitted that it was his voice in the recording in July the same year.\n2022 general election\nAt a pre-election Pakatan Harapan convention, the coalition officially announced Anwar Ibrahim as the coalition's candidate for prime minister in the 2022 general election. Anwar announced he would be contesting the Tambun parliamentary seat in the 2022 general election and that if he became prime minister, he would form a smaller cabinet and reduce cabinet ministers' salaries. The decision to contest in Tambun, where an easy victory was not expected, was motivated by the fact its incumbent member of parliament at the time was former chief minister of Perak and BERSATU member Ahmad Faizal Azumu, who had followed his party into the opposing Perikatan Nasional coalition during the Sheraton Move. For this, he was labelled a \"traitor\" by the Pakaran Harapan coalition.\nIn the 2022 Malaysian general election held on 19 November 2022, Anwar's Pakatan Harapan coalition won a plurality of 82 seats out of 222, below the 112 seats needed for a majority. On 20 November, Anwar said that Pakatan Harapan had negotiated with other parties to form the federal government with a majority pending approval by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, but Anwar refused to mention which other parties were cooperating with Pakatan Harapan. Also that day, Perikatan Nasional leader Muhyiddin Yassin claimed to have a sufficient majority to be appointed as prime minister, citing support from Perikatan Nasional, Barisan Nasional, Gabungan Parti Sarawak, and Gabungan Rakyat Sabah. On 21 November, Anwar was one of several Pakatan Harapan leaders that met with several Barisan Nasional leaders, including Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and Ismail Sabri Yaakob, at the Seri Pacific Hotel.\nOn 22 November, the royal palace stated that after the Yang di-Pertuan Agong reviewed the statutory declarations for prime minister, he found that \"no member of parliament has the majority support to be appointed prime minister\", so the Yang di-Pertuan Agong summoned Anwar and Muhyiddin to meet him. After the meeting, Muhyiddin said that the Yang di-Pertuan Agong proposed a unity government between Pakatan Harapan and Perikatan Nasional, but that Muhyiddin had rejected the idea as Perikatan Nasional \"will not cooperate\" with Pakatan Harapan; while Anwar acknowledged that the prime minister had yet to be determined, while stating \"given time, I think we will secure a simple majority\".\nAnwar was sworn in as Malaysia's 10th Prime Minister on 24 November 2022, by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Al-Sultan Abdullah, after consulting with the Conference of Rulers of Malaysia. However, Muhyiddin continued to insist that he had the support of a majority of 115 MPs to form the next government and called on Anwar to prove his majority by revealing his statutory declarations. As of 24 November, Anwar had received support from MPs from PH, BN, GPS, Warisan, MUDA and PBM, as well as independent MPs. Anwar pledged to hold a vote of confidence on 19 December 2022, once MPs had been sworn into the Dewan Rakyat.\nOn 25 November, both Anwar and Gabungan Rakyat Sabah leader Hajiji Noor stated that the latter's coalition had joined the unity government supporting Anwar; giving him a two-thirds majority in parliament. Muhyiddin congratulated and acknowledged Anwar as prime minister, but declined the latter's invitation to join the unity government, stating that Perikatan would play the role of a \"credible opposition\" to ensure \"corruption-free governance\". Anwar also reiterated that he will not be taking any form of government salary during his tenure as Prime Minister and Finance Minister as a sign of his leadership and to gain the confidence of the people.\nOn 19 December, a motion of confidence for Anwar was passed by the Dewan Rakyat through a voice vote, further solidifying his legitimacy as prime minister.\nPremiership (2022–present)\nCabinet appointments\nAnwar announced his cabinet on 2 December 2022, appointing himself as the Minister of Finance. He also appointed President of UMNO Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and the Parliamentary Whip of Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS) Fadillah Yusof as the Deputy Prime Ministers. This marked the first time Malaysia had two deputy prime ministers in office concurrently. Zahid's appointment was controversial due to his ongoing trials for money laundering, bribery and criminal breach of trust. The Straits Times of Singapore has referred to the Anwar cabinet as a \"kleptocrat\" cabinet as a result. On 12 December 2023, Anwar carried out the first cabinet reshuffle, appointing five new ministers and deputy ministers respectively.\nDomestic affairs\nAnwar has expressed support for changing method of teaching Islamic studies in schools to emphasise \"universal humanity values\", and teaching the history of Islamic civilisation at all levels. Anwar faced criticism after he expanded the role of Department of Islamic Development Malaysia (JAKIM) to include providing input on policy decisions, a move made in response to claims that his government had \"abandoned Islam\". He refuted claims that he was displaying a \"strong Islamist attitude\", arguing that the broadening of JAKIM's responsibilities is intended to allow for Muslims to gain a deeper knowledge of Islam, which Anwar claims would help avoid inter-community conflict. His government later approved an RM8.9 million allocation for Islamic religious institutions in the state of Kedah. Anwar has also defended the decision to introduce an appreciation module for Al-Nawawi's Forty Hadith in public schools, clarifying that it was not intended for non-Muslim students, with the education ministry stating the module was introduced \"with the aim of fostering the spirit of kindness and love\".\nAnwar has come under fire from many long-time supporters who accused him of not following through on past commitments. When Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi was discharged without amounting to an acquittal on some of the bribery charges against him, Anwar was accused of placing political power ahead of principles, with the Malaysian United Democratic Alliance (MUDA) leaving government and joining the opposition as a result. Polls have shown Anwar's popularity falling even as he attempted to garner more support from Malay-Muslim voters.\nThe government drew attention in 2023 when Swatch watches with LGBTQ themes and their related materials, including boxes, wrappers, and accessories were banned, making the possession of the rainbow-themed Swatch watches in Malaysia punishable by three years in jail.\nAnwar has publicly stated that he would be open to the inclusion of the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, a major component of the opposition Perikatan Nasional coalition, if they accepted his conditions; including ensuring every citizen regardless of religious identity a place in the country.\nIn October 2023, Anwar ordered government institutions not to entertain letters written in a language other than the national language, as part of an effort to promote and empower its use.\nOn 8 December 2023, Anwar and his \"unity government\" celebrated their first year in power with a three-day event. Analysts suggest that this grand celebration aims to highlight the ruling coalition's accomplishments and its capacity to uphold political stability.\nOn 28 January 2024, Anwar appointed pro-govt Bersatu Bukit Gantang MP Syed Abu Hussin Hafiz to lead the government committee on rising food prices and the cost of living. Syed Abu Hussein had declared his support for the prime minister during a Dewan Rakyat sitting on 28 November 2023.\nAnwar participated in the seventh Bumiputera Economic Congress convened by UMNO in February 2024 where he announced the allocation of RM1 billion to establish and grow a bumiputera entrepreneur class through government-linked and government-owned companies, despite having previously expressed the need to move beyond race-based affirmative action. In March, it was announced that he will chair a secretariat formed to monitor the implementation of policies and resolutions approved at the congress.\nIn April 2024, Anwar denied reports by Bloomberg News that the government was considering the opening of a new casino in Forest City, Johor, a residential development under the Belt and Road Initiative. The Bloomberg report implicated the Yang-di Pertuan Agong Ibrahim Iskandar, who is also Sultan of Johor. A political activist, Badrul Hisham Shaharin, also known as Chegubard, was arrested for under the Sedition Act making a post about the report, along with blogger Wan Muhammad Azri Wan Deris, also known as Papagomo, who alleged that Iskandar had ordered Chegubard be charged under the Sedition Act.\nInternational affairs\n]]\nOn 28 January 2023, Anwar announced that Malaysia would print one million copies of the Quran to be distributed worldwide in response to the 2023 Quran burnings in Sweden.\nIn response to the European Union's new environmental and deforestation regulations set to take effect in 2024, the Malaysian government sought to be classified as a low-risk country for deforestation, with Malaysia having previously lodged complaints against the European Union to the World Trade Organization. Palm oil is a major Malaysian export and has been linked with Deforestation in Malaysia.\nIn October 2023, Anwar publicly condemned Israel in the Gaza war and urged for a ceasefire, calling for Palestinians to be \"treated as human beings\". His government's education ministry launched a nationwide Palestine Solidarity Week in support of Palestine and was criticised after students were seen with mock guns in schools. Despite two formal démarches by the U.S. Embassy for the Malaysian foreign ministry to designate Hamas a terrorist group, Anwar has publicly refused to do so, and has said his government would continue its relations with Hamas regardless of U.S. pressure.\nOn 20 December 2023, Anwar announced an immediate ban on ships bearing the Israeli flag from docking in Malaysia. Additionally, vessels destined for Israel will be prohibited from loading cargo at Malaysian ports.\nat the Eastern Economic Forum in Primorsky Krai, Russia, 4 September 2024]]\nIn March 2024, on a trip to Germany, Anwar clarified that the Malaysian government only engages with Hamas' political wing and did not condone the killings of civilians. Anwar also called for the release of the hostages taken on 7 October by Hamas, but argued this alone would not be able to solve the conflict.\nOn 14 May 2024, Anwar met with top Hamas leaders in Qatar, a move that led to criticism.\nOn 18 June 2024, Anwar said Malaysia wants to join the BRICS grouping of emerging economies. He later sought to ease concerns about Malaysia's potential membership in the BRICS intergovernmental organisation, emphasising that it would not impact domestic politics. On 24 October 2024, Malaysia attained BRICS partner country status, with Rafizi Ramli representing Malaysia at the 16th BRICS Summit, strengthening Malaysia's economic and trade collaborations with BRICS nations.\nAnwar tweeted on X: \"Malaysia mourns the loss of a fighter and defender of the Palestinian people, Al Syahid Yahya Sinwar who was brutally murdered by the barbaric Zionist regime. Once again, the international community failed to fight and ensure that peace and justice were upheld thus worsening the conflict situation. Malaysia strongly condemned the killing, and it was clear that the regime's attempt to undermine the demand for release would not succeed. As a result, Malaysia insists that Israel's barbarity be contradicted by the international community and that the ongoing massacre of Palestinians must be stopped immediately.\"\nin Vientiane, Laos, on October 10, 2024.]]\nIn November 2024, Anwar undertook an official visit to Egypt at the invitation of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, marking the 65th anniversary of Malaysia-Egypt diplomatic relations. During this visit, Anwar emphasised Malaysia's commitment to strengthening educational and cultural ties between the two nations, securing additional scholarships for Malaysian students at Al-Azhar University in fields like medicine, engineering, and technology. He also encouraged students to integrate Islamic values with technological advancement, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence. Anwar and El-Sisi issued a joint statement condemning Israeli attacks in Gaza City and Lebanon, calling for an immediate ceasefire to prevent further humanitarian crises. This stance reinforced Anwar's ongoing support for Gaza and his recent advocacy with Western leaders to deliver humanitarian aid to the region. Anwar was advised to be careful with his rhetoric on the new U.S. administration policies on Gaza.\n, Thai prime minister Anutin Charnvirakul and Cambodian prime minister Hun Manet after the signing of the Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords, 26 October 2025.]]\nOn 28 July 2025, Anwar hosted negotiations in Kuala Lumpur between Thailand and Cambodia to end the 2025 Cambodia–Thailand border crisis, culminating with him declaring a ceasefire agreement between the warring countries, which resulted in the signing of the Kuala Lumpur Peace Accord on 26 October 2025.\nMalaysia-Sulu Case\nLitigation around the North Borneo dispute and the battle against the self-proclaimed heirs of the Sultan of Sulu has featured prominently in Anwar's premiership. His cabinet's response to the claims made by the purported Sulu descendants has been led by Azalina Othman Said, minister for Law and Institutional Reforms in the Malaysian Prime Minister's Department.\nHe has also been vocal about his criticism of the claimants as well as the arbitration award announced by Spanish lawyer and arbitrator Gonzalo Stampa, calling the decision \"sham and abusive\". Stampa had ruled in favour of the Sulu claimants and announced a settlement of US$14.9 billion payable by Malaysia, the largest arbitration award in history. The Malaysian government led by Anwar won a major battle early in 2023 when the Spanish Constitutional Court rejected Sulu claimants' appeal against the annulment of the appointment Gonzalo Stampa as the arbitrator. Later in June 2023, the Hague Court of Appeal also dismissed an appeal by the claimants to enforce the award in the Netherlands.\nAnwar hailed the decision as a \"landmark victory\", adding that it would put an end to \"the frivolous attempts\" of the claimants to enforce the award in foreign jurisdictions. He said the Malaysian government \"would not entertain any claims, be it by the Sulu claimants or the Philippine government, as Sabah is Malaysia's 'sacred' territory\".\nHe also said the Malaysian government \"would stop at nothing to protect the country's sovereignty, national security and national interest. The Sulu case demonstrates a grave violation of Malaysia's sovereign immunity, which matters to every citizen of Malaysia Madani\".\n\"We will take all necessary actions to recover the costs for the public resources that Malaysia has been forced to expend in dealing with these claims. The government is confident that justice will prevail for the people of Malaysia,\" he said.\nOn 17 May 2024 the Madrid Court of Appeal upheld the contempt of court conviction and sentence against Stampa, upholding his six-month prison sentence, and a one-year ban from practising as an arbitrator. Azalina Othman Said appreciated Anwar for \"his steadfast commitment and determination in protecting the sovereignty of Malaysia at all costs, and his undivided support to the Malaysian team fighting these frivolous claims\".\nThe committee formed by Ibrahim to take on the Sulu case achieved a major breakthrough in November 2024 when the French Court of Cassation — the highest court in the French judicial system — annulled the $15 billion arbitration ruling against Malaysia. The French court declared the arbitration clause in the case invalid because it had appointed the British Consul General in Brunei as arbitrator,  a position that ceased to exist decades ago. The verdict also stressed the need for international arbitration agreements to be interpreted in accordance with the principles of good faith and utility, \"without reference to the law of any State\".  A number of arbitration experts and several publications, including Law.com and Law360, backed the decision. Keith Ellison, former vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee and Minnesota attorney general, pointed out that the case highlighted the enormous scope for \"corruption,\" irresponsible profiteering, and foreign influence operations to subvert arbitration proceedings\".\nUniversity of Paris Cité Professor Caroline Kleiner claimed that the case marked a major shift in arbitration law and hearing. In her comments published by Kluwer Law International, Keleiner said the decision would help French courts participate in the development of international law on the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards per a universalist approach, rather than the trend of exceptionalism that is currently being pursued.\nPraising Ibrahim, Malaysian Minister of Entrepreneur Development and Cooperatives Ewon Benedick said the victory in the Sulu case was a legacy of the Madani government's success under the leadership of Prime Minister Ibrahim. Azalina Othman thanked Ibrahim for his \"continued support and unwavering trust in our ongoing effort to uphold Malaysia's position\".\nAlso in November 2024, Philippine president Bongbong Marcos signed the Philippine Maritime Zones Act and the Philippine Archipelagic Sea Lanes Act. These laws reaffirmed the Philippines' maritime territories and rights to natural resources across the South China Sea, including Sabah, drawing strong criticism from Malaysia. On 15 November 2024, Kuala Lumpur lodged a diplomatic protest against the two maritime laws, arguing that they infringed upon Malaysia's territorial boundaries in the South China Sea.\nControversies and issues\nOn 3 January 2023, Anwar appointed his daughter Nurul Izzah Anwar as the chief economic and financial advisor to the prime minister, which raised doubts and disagreements from all sides and garnered criticism for government nepotism. Despite reports indicating that Nurul Izzah was not getting paid for her position, she stepped down from her role as advisor in February 2023.\nOn 11 July 2023, Bersatu information committee member Badrul Hisham Shaharin urged Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) to investigate Anwar over the ownership of the latter's personal residence in Kajang, Selangor. Putrajaya police chief A. Asmadi Abdul Aziz, when contacted, confirmed receiving the report, saying that an investigation will be carried out. Anwar's political secretary Ahmad Farhan Fauzi saying that he had lodged a police report against Badrul Hisham, former Bersatu information chief Wan Saiful Wan Jan, and blogger Raggie Jessy Rithaudeen over their allegedly defamatory remarks.\nOn 18 August 2023, Anwar's open conversion of a Hindu youth to Islam after Friday prayers at a mosque in Klang, Selangor, has sparked criticism among non-Muslims. Several NGOs, including the Kuala Lumpur and Selangor Chinese Assembly Hall (KLSCAH) criticised Anwar for presiding over the ceremony. Former Penang deputy chief minister Ramasamy Palanisamy said that such an act shows that Anwar has no respect or gratitude towards the Indian community, which has sacrificed a lot for the welfare of the country. An activist who criticised Anwar's act of converting a Hindu man to Islam was questioned by the police.\nOn 4 September 2023, the High Court, upon request by deputy public prosecutor Mohd Dusuki Mukhtar decided to grant a discharge not amounting to an acquittal (DNAA) on all 47 embezzlement charges against Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi. This raised questions about the credibility of Anwar's reform agenda and his commitment to clean up the country's corruption-ridden politics. Zahid Hamidi's United Malays National Organization (UMNO) is a key component of Anwar's unity government, and the prosecutor's' decision to drop the charges caused concerns on the government's position on corruption cases. Specifically those involving other UMNO leaders, such as former Prime Minister Najib Razak.\nFormer Malaysian Bar president Ambiga Sreenevasan and former ambassador Dennis Ignatius has questioned the anti-corruption efforts by Anwar's Pakatan Harapan-led administration. Freelance writer P. Gunasegaram commented on Malaysiakini that the credibility of Anwar's vow to combat corruption in Malaysia had crumbled to dust. However, Anwar has denied having any involvement in the court's decision and stressed the independence of Malaysia's judiciary while mentioning that then attorney-general Idrus Harun insisted on seeking a conditional discharge. Upon calls to discuss the case in parliament, Anwar said that Parliament should not be turned into a court proceeding and stressed the need to understand the separation of powers between the executive, legislature, and judiciary. In the 2023 iteration of Transparency International's corruption perception index, Malaysia placed 57th out of 108 nations with 50 points, reversing a declining trend that started in 2019. On the final day of 2023, The Economist contends that Anwar is wasting his opportunity.\nPolitical positions and views\nAnwar has advocated for Islamic democracy and has expressed hope that Malaysia be an example of democratic practices in the Muslim world. He has been described as a \"liberal reformer, talented technocrat, genuine intellectual and perhaps even a man capable of bringing the spirit of the Arab Spring to one of Asia's largest majority Muslim nations.\" He has supported the Islamic concept of Ummah as a framework for democracy in Muslim countries, and called the three-world model \"redundant\" and \"simplistic\". Anwar has called for judicial independence, good governance and rejection of authoritarianism. During his time as a youth activist in his early career, he expressed his admiration for Philippine revolutionary José Rizal.\nDuring his early political career in the 1960s, Anwar said that he supported affirmative action policies for Malays due to his concern about the dominance of Malaysian Chinese in businesses, but later changed his views. After leaving prison, he said that he considered \"Malay supremacy\" a \"major problem\". Referencing longstanding affirmative action policies for Malays and other bumiputera, in 2019 he called for transitioning to \"affirmative-action policies [being] premised on need instead of race\" and that those living in poverty can receive government support regardless of their race.\nIn 2018, The Guardian described him as a \"uniting figure\" for the opposition throughout his imprisonment and trials.\nIsrael and Palestine\nIn a press conference at the London School of Economics in March 2010, Anwar stated that Jews should not be condemned, but rather only the state ideology of Zionism and the aggression and injustice perpetrated against the Palestinians. He also believes that there are good and bad Jews, just as there are good and bad Muslims. In May 2010, B'nai B'rith International, a prominent Jewish human rights organisation, argued that Anwar has used his position in Malaysian parliament to spread anti-Semitic propaganda, such as his claim that Israeli spies are \"directly involved in the running of the government\". B'nai B'rith asked US officials to suspend their ties with Anwar Ibrahim.\nIn a 2012 interview with The Wall Street Journal, Anwar Ibrahim stated that he believes the policy towards Israel and Palestine should be clear – protecting the security of Israel while also being firm in protecting the legitimate interests of the Palestinians. Anwar later clarified his stance, saying that the remarks were consistent with the two-state solution adopted by the United Nations and Malaysia itself.\nAnwar has also condemned US bias over the Israel-Palestine conflict, and called for Malaysia to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine.\nLGBTQ rights\nAnwar has expressed evolving views on LGBTQ rights throughout his political career. In a 2012 interview, Anwar suggested that Malaysia's sodomy laws, under which he had been prosecuted, were \"archaic\" and could be amended. He clarified that while he believed in the sanctity of marriage between men and women and did not want to legalise homosexuality or same-sex marriage, he also stated that it was not his business to attack or arrest people based on their sexual orientation.\nHowever, in 2018, Anwar urged religious people to counter the demand by \"super liberals\" to recognise LGBTQ lifestyle, claiming that these liberals should not force society to accept their views on LGBTQ rights. In 2022, he filed a defamation suit against Perak PAS Commissioner Razman Zakaria who claimed that Anwar would push the LGBTQ agenda and support communism, asserting that he has always denounced the LGBTQ agenda and has been an advocate of Islamic teachings and values.\nAs prime minister in 2023, Anwar assured that LGBTQ rights, secularism, and communism would never be recognised under his government. In a 2023 CNN interview, he stated that while excessive harassment of the LGBTQ community would not be condoned, Malaysia would not officially recognise LGBTQ rights due to the consensus among the population. He also suggested that the sodomy laws should be reviewed to prevent abuse and political persecution.\nPersonal life\nAnwar is an ethnic Malay and a Muslim. He married Wan Azizah Wan Ismail on 26 February 1980. They have five daughters and a son. His eldest daughter, Nurul Izzah Anwar, at the last general election failed to retain her position as the MP for Permatang Pauh.\nDuring his trials and time in prison in the 2000s, Anwar spent time in solitary confinement, and experienced frequent beatings which required him to undertake surgery in Germany upon his release. He once appeared in court with a black eye. Anwar has professed an interest in the works of William Shakespeare, and said that he read a copy of his complete works four and a half times during his imprisonment. He presented a paper to the World Shakespeare Congress in 2006. In prison, he also said he survived by singing songs and reading.\nCultural depictions\nBiographies and popular media\nAnwar early rise in politics have been depicted by Indonesian-Malaysian production film, Anwar: The Untold Story in 2023.\nElection results\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\"\n|+ Parliament of
