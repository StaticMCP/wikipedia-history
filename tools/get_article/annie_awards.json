Originally designed to celebrate lifetime or career contributions to animation, the award has been given to individual works since 1992, becoming the biggest awards ceremony in the United States for the animation industry.\nMembership in ASIFA-Hollywood is divided into three main categories: General Member (for professionals), Patron (for enthusiasts of animation), and Student Member. Members in each category pay a fee to belong to the branch. Selected professional members of the branch are permitted to vote to decide the awards.\nThe 48th and 49th Annie Awards ceremonies were held virtually on April 16, 2021, and March 12, 2022, respectively, due to the then ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nHistory\nIn 1972, June Foray first conceived the idea of awards for excellence in the field of animation. With the approval of ASIFA-Hollywood president Nick Bosustow, an Annie Award ceremony was organized. The first ceremony was held at the banquet room of Sportsmen's Lodge in Ventura Boulevard in Studio City, Los Angeles, California. Max Fleischer and Dave Fleischer were the first to be honored by the first Annie Awards for creating Betty Boop, bringing Popeye, and Olive Oyl to the animated screen, and for inventing the technique of rotoscoping.\nNaming \"Annie Awards\"\nAccording to Foray, her husband Hobart Donavan suggested that the awards be called \"Annie\", because they are presented for excellence in animation.\nTrophy\nThe first trophy for the Annie Award trophy was presented in the second award ceremony, to Walter Lantz, the founder of Walter Lantz Productions and creator of Woody Woodpecker. Made of wood and plastic, it was shaped like a zoetrope. The next year, Tom Woodward designed the trophy now presented.\nAward categories\nCurrent categories\nAs of 2025, 37 categories are presented including for film and television productions.\nProduction\n* Best Animated Feature\n* Best Animated Feature – Independent\n* Best Animated Special Production\n* Best Animated Short Subject\n* Best Animated Sponsored Production\n* Best General Audience Animated Television Broadcast Production\n* Best TV Production for Children\n* Best TV Production for Preschool Children\n* Best Student Film\n* Best TV/Media – Limited Series\nIndividual achievement in Film\n* Outstanding Animated Effects\n* Outstanding Character Animation – Animation\n* Outstanding Character Animation – Live Action\n* Outstanding Character Design\n* Outstanding Directing\n* Outstanding Editorial\n* Outstanding Music\n* Outstanding Production Design\n* Outstanding Storyboarding\n* Outstanding Voice Acting\n* Outstanding Writing\nIndividual achievement in Television, Broadcast and Video Game\n* Outstanding Animated Effects\n* Outstanding Character Animation – TV/Media\n* Outstanding Character Animation – Video Game\n* Outstanding Character Design\n* Outstanding Directing\n* Outstanding Editorial\n* Outstanding Music\n* Outstanding Producing\n* Outstanding Production Design\n* Outstanding Storyboarding\n* Outstanding Voice Acting\n* Outstanding Writing\nJuried awards\n* June Foray Award\n* Ub Iwerks Award\n* Winsor McCay Award\n* Special Achievement in Animation\n* Certificates of Merit\nDefunct categories\n* Best Animated Home Entertainment Production\n* Best Virtual Reality Production\n* Outstanding Animated Effects – Live Action\n* Best Animated Television Production\n* Best Animated Video Game\nBalloting controversies and criticism\n2008 Best Short Subject mixup\nIn 2008, the Annie Award nominees for Best Short Subject included two Walt Disney cartoons, a Pixar short, and two independent films: Picnic Pictures' The Chestnut Tree, and Don Hertzfeldt's short Everything Will Be OK. Official rules for the Annie Awards state that voting members must view all nominated achievements in their entirety before casting their ballot for a winner. Members are directed to view the nominated films on a secure website.\nWhen the online ballot launched on January 15, the two independent films were not included for voters to judge. ASIFA acknowledged this error over a week later, at which point all the votes were reportedly thrown out and the balloting system was reset. Voters were instructed to return and re-vote the category. \"The Chestnut Tree\" was now uploaded properly to the ballot; however, Everything Will Be OK was again not included: this time, the online ballot only played a portion of this film's 17-minute running time to voters, abruptly cutting out in the middle of a scene. ASIFA again took several days to repair the ballot, but this time allowed voting to continue.\nBy the time the ballot officially closed on February 1, Everything Will Be OK was only available to voters for less than 24 hours of the entire 18-day voting period. Even though ASIFA apologized to Hertzfeldt, they took no further action and carried on with the event, awarding the prize to the Pixar short, Your Friend the Rat. (Hertzfeldt would eventually win the award for his 2015 Oscar-nominated short film World of Tomorrow.)\nDreamworks upset and Disney boycott\nIn 2009, DreamWorks Animation's Kung Fu Panda swept the Annie Awards in a surprise upset over Pixar's WALL-E, which won no Annie Awards but did go on to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Many felt that the vote had been rigged: DreamWorks at the time gave each of their employees a free membership to ASIFA-Hollywood, which in turn conferred voting rights. (For most film awards, voting rights cannot be bought but must be conferred by one's peers.)\nAs a result, Walt Disney Studios decided to cease submissions and support for the 2010 Annie Awards from their two animated film divisions, Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar. Due to Disney's complaints, ASIFA-Hollywood changed the rules on voting for individual achievement categories, making those categories only available to professionals within those categories. ASIFA-Hollywood head Antran Manoogian also said that Annie voters would in the future have to be approved by a committee and non-professionals would now be ineligible to vote.\nThat was not enough for Disney president Ed Catmull, who had called for an advisory committee of relevant executives representing each studio to recommend rule changes to the ASIFA board. Catmull said, \"We believe there is an issue with the way the Annies are judged, and have been seeking a mutually agreeable solution with the board. Although some initial steps have been taken, the board informed us that no further changes would be made to address our concerns.\" ASIFA-Hollywood did not agree to this demand.\nDisney and Pixar rejoined the Annie Awards in 2011, with no formal announcement. Ironically, earlier that year, the Annie Awards had a near-exact replay of the 2009 results, with DreamWorks Animation's How to Train Your Dragon sweeping all the major Annie Awards over Pixar's Toy Story 3, which went on to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and also received a nomination for Best Picture.\nRecords\nFilm\nThe following nominees (motion pictures and direct-to-video films) received multiple nominations:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"55\" | Nominations\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\" | Film\n|-\n| rowspan=3 style=\"text-align:center\" | 16\n| The Incredibles\n|-\n| Kung Fu Panda\n|-\n| Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit\n|-\n| rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:center\" | 15\n| How to Train Your Dragon\n|-\n| The Iron Giant\n|-\n| rowspan=1 style=\"text-align:center\" | 14\n| Inside Out\n|-\n| rowspan=4 style=\"text-align:center\" | 13\n| Coco\n|-\n| The Boxtrolls\n|-\n| The Hunchback of Notre Dame\n|-\n| Ratatouille\n|-\n| rowspan=4 style=\"text-align:center\" | 12\n| Finding Nemo\n|-\n| Kung Fu Panda 2\n|-\n| Mulan\n|-\n| Shrek\n|-\n| rowspan=4 style=\"text-align:center\" | 11\n| ''The Emperor's New Groove\n|-\n| Tarzan\n|-\n| Zootopia\n|-\n| Incredibles 2\n|-\n| rowspan=17 style=\"text-align:center\" | 10\n| Brave\n|-\n| The Breadwinner\n|-\n| Coraline\n|-\n| Frozen\n|-\n| The Good Dinosaur\n|-\n| How to Train Your Dragon 2\n|-\n| Kubo and the Two Strings\n|-\n| Lilo & Stitch\n|-\n| Monsters University\n|-\n| Ralph Breaks the Internet\n|-\n| Raya and the Last Dragon\n|-\n| Rise of the Guardians\n|-\n| Soul\n|-\n| Surf's Up\n|-\n| Wolfwalkers\n|-\n| The Wild Robot\n|-\n| Wreck-It Ralph\n|-\n| rowspan=12 style=\"text-align:center\" | 9\n|-\n| Anastasia\n|-\n| Cars\n|-\n| Encanto\n|-\n| Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio\n|-\n| Madagascar\n|-\n| Nimona\n|-\n| Puss in Boots\n|-\n| Rango\n|-\n| Toy Story\n|-\n| Toy Story 2\n|-\n| Up\n|-\n| rowspan=16 style=\"text-align:center\" | 8\n|-\n| Cats Don't Dance\n|-\n| Flushed Away\n|-\n| Frozen II\n|-\n| Hotel Transylvania\n|-\n| Luca\n|-\n| Missing Link\n|-\n| The Mitchells vs. the Machines\n|-\n| Monsters, Inc.\n|-\n| Over the Hedge\n|-\n| ParaNorman\n|-\n| The Princess and the Frog\n|-\n| Rio\n|-\n| The Road to El Dorado\n|-\n| Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron\n|-\n| Winnie the Pooh\n|-\n| rowspan=21 style=\"text-align:center\" | 7\n| Big Hero 6\n|-\n| The Boy and the Heron\n|-\n| Brother Bear\n|-\n| Cars 2\n|-\n| Despicable Me\n|-\n| Early Man\n|-\n| Ice Age\n|-\n| Klaus\n|-\n| Minions\n|-\n| Onward\n|-\n| Pocahontas\n|-\n| Song of the Sea\n|-\n| Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\n|-\n| Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\n|-\n| Shark Tale\n|-\n| Shrek 2\n|-\n| Suzume\n|-\n| Treasure Planet\n|-\n| Turning Red\n|-\n| Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl\n|-\n| WALL-E\n|-\n| rowspan=22 style=\"text-align:center\" | 6\n| Hercules\n|-\n| Arthur Christmas\n|-\n| Atlantis: The Lost Empire\n|-\n| The Boss Baby\n|-\n| The Croods: A New Age\n|-\n| Elemental\n|-\n| Ernest & Celestine\n|-\n| How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World\n|-\n| I Lost My Body\n|-\n| The Lego Movie\n|-\n| The Lion King\n|-\n| Megamind\n|-\n| Moana\n|-\n| Monster House\n|-\n| Open Season\n|-\n| Osmosis Jones\n|-\n| Over the Moon\n|-\n| Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\n|-\n| The Sea Beast\n|-\n| Toy Story 4\n|-\n| Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\n|-\n| The Willoughbys\n|-\n| rowspan=26 style=\"text-align:center\" | 5\n| Anomalisa\n|-\n| The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn\n|-\n| The Bad Guys\n|-\n| Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas\n|-\n| Belle\n|-\n| Bolt\n|-\n| The Book of Life\n|-\n| Dinosaur\n|-\n| Fantasia 2000\n|-\n| Frankenweenie\n|-\n| A Goofy Movie\n|-\n| Ghost in the Shell\n|-\n| Horton Hears a Who!\n|-\n| The Jungle Book 2\n|-\n| The Illusionist\n|-\n| Inside Out 2\n|-\n| Mary Poppins Returns\n|-\n| The Peanuts Movie\n|-\n| The Pirates!
