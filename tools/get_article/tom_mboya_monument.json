It was erected in 2011 in honour of Tom Mboya, a Kenyan government minister who was assassinated in 1969. The monument stands about twenty metres from where Mboya was murdered.\nHistory\nThe monument was designed by sculptor Oshottoe Ondula, costing the Kenyan government KSh 20,000,000/=. The statue was unveiled on 19 October 2011. However, by mid-2019, it, along with another (that of Dedan Kimathi), had fallen into disrepair, and Governor of Machakos Alfred Mutua pledged to clean and repair them. The renovation was completed in April 2021.\nReferences"
