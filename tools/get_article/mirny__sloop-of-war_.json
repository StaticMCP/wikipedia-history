It was initially named Ladoga (after Lake Ladoga), but when the need arose for a new ship for an Antarctic expedition, the decision was taken not to build a completely new one, but to refit Ladoga. It was reconstructed under surveillance of its future commander Mikhail Lazarev.\nOn  Vostok under the captaincy of Commander Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen, the leader of the expedition, alongside Mirny under the command of Lieutenant Commander Mikhail Lazarev left Kronshtadt  and on  reached the shore of Antarctica, which was sighted for the first time in history. After repair in Sydney in Australia, the expedition explored the tropical parts of the Pacific, and on  again turned to Antarctica. On  the sloops reached the southernmost point of their voyage at 69° 53' S and 92° 19' W. On  they returned to Kronshtadt.\nIn 751 days they covered 49&nbsp;723 miles (approx. 92&nbsp;300&nbsp;km). Apart from the discovery of the world's sixth continent, Antarctica, 29 islands were mapped and complex oceanographic works carried out. A medal was issued by the Russian Admiralty to commemorate the expedition.\nNamed in honor\n* Mirny Rupes, a mountain chain on planet Mercury.\n* Mirny Peak, a prominent peak, 750 m, 4 nautical miles (7&nbsp;km) northeast of Enigma Peak in the north part of Rothschild Island, presumably first seen from a distance in 1821 by the First Russian Antarctic Expedition.\n* Mirny Station, a Russian Antarctic research station on the coast of the Davis Sea, established on February 13, 1956 by the 1st Soviet Antarctic Expedition.\n* Mirny Peninsula, on which Mirny Station is located.\n|alt=]]\nReferences\n* Морской энциклопедический словарь.
