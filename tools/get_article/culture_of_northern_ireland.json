Yellowman is a chewy toffee-textured honeycomb and is sold in non-standard blocks and chips and is associated with the Ould Lammas Fair in Ballycastle, County Antrim, where it is sold along with other confectionery and often dulse.\nDulse is commonly used in Ireland, where it can be used to make white soda bread. It can be found in many health food stores or fish markets and can be ordered directly from local distributors. it is also traditionally sold at the Ould Lammas Fair. It is particularly popular along the Causeway Coast. Although a fast-dying tradition, many gather their own dulse. Along the Ulster coastline from County Down to County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland, it is eaten dried and uncooked as a snack.\nLanguage\nin Northern Ireland as shown on this sign is displayed in English, Irish and Ulster Scots]]\nEnglish is the most spoken language in Northern Ireland. There are also two recognised regional languages in Northern Ireland: the Irish language (see Irish language in Northern Ireland) and the local variety of Scots known as Ulster Scots. Northern Ireland Sign Language and Irish Sign Language have been recognised since 29 March 2004. A third, British Sign Language is also used.\nAt the 2001 census, Chinese was the most widely spoken minority language in Northern Ireland, with Shelta, Arabic and Portuguese also spoken by a significant number of people. Since the census, however, an influx of people from recent EU accession states is likely to have significantly increased numbers of speakers of languages from these countries. Detailed figures on these changes are not yet available.\nSports\nSome team sports are played on an All-Ireland basis, while in others Northern Ireland fields its own team.\n* Belfast Giants\n* Gaelic football\n* Hurling\n* Gaelic handball\n* Milk Cup, an international youth association football competition held in Northern Ireland\n* Northern Ireland national football team\n* Royal Portrush Golf Club\n* Ulster GAA\n* Ulster Rugby\n*Rowing\nInternationally well-known sports people include:\n* George Best – footballer, born in Belfast\n* Sir Danny Blanchflower – footballer\n* Darren Clarke – golfer, born in Dungannon\n* Joey Dunlop\n* Jack Kyle\n* Dave Finlay\n* Paddy Hopkirk\n* John Watson (racing driver)\n* Mike Gibson (rugby union)\n* Mike Bull\n* Peter Chambers\n* Alex Higgins\n* David Humphreys\n* Eddie Irvine\n* Dave McAuley\n* Willie John McBride\n* Tony McCoy\n* Wayne McCullough\n* Dame Mary Peters\n* Ronan Rafferty\n* Dennis Taylor\n* Andrew Trimble\n* Norman Whiteside\n* Terry Moore (soccer)\n* Cormac McAnallen\n* Rory McIlroy\n* Daryl Gurney\nArts\nLiterature\n(1808–1895) in paving, Writers' Square, Belfast]]\nDespite its small geographical size, Northern Ireland prolifically produces internationally renowned writers and poets from a wide variety of disciplines. Irish language literature was the predominant literature in the pre-Plantation period. The Ulster Cycle is pertinent to the history of literature in the territory of present-day Northern Ireland.

Both sides also occasionally use the flags of secular and religious organisations they belong to. Some groups, including the Irish Rugby Football Union and the Church of Ireland use the Flag of St. Patrick as a symbol of Ireland which lacks the same nationalist or unionist connotations.\n.]]The flax flower, representing the linen industry, has been used as a neutral symbol – as for the Northern Ireland Assembly.\nSt. Patrick's Day is celebrated by both nationalists and unionists, while \"The Twelfth\" is celebrated only by unionists.\nCelebrations to mark the anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne are held every Twelfth of July and draw huge crowds.
