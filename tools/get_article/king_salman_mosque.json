With capacity for 10,000 worshippers, it is considerably one of the largest mosque in the Indian Ocean.\nThe construction of the mosque was funded in part by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and it is named after King Salman.\nHistory\nThe mosque was planned to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the independence of the Maldives. The construction of the mosque began in 2018. The opening of the mosque was scheduled in 2021, but was delayed as the structure remains unfinished. The mosque opened unofficially for prayers in April 2022. The official opening is yet to be announced. In May 2024 the Islamic Minister, Dr Mohamed Shaheem Ali Saeed, advised that Rf. 6&nbsp;million was needed in order to fix air conditioning issues in the building; and that the official opening was delayed until the funds could be secured.\nArchitecture\nThe six-storeyed mosque building is flanked by five minarets, representing the five pillars of Islam. The building lacks a traditional dome. Instead, the dome-like structure is designed to resemble a Bedouin desert tent in the Maldivian vernacular roof structure style.\nThe mosque complex also includes a library, an auditorium, classrooms, and a multi-purpose hall.\nSee also\n}}\n* Islam in the Maldives\n* List of mosques in the Maldives\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
