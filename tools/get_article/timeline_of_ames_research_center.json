Its report, released two years later, called for expanded facilities in the form of a new laboratory—an action underscored by Charles Lindbergh, who had just returned from a European tour warning that Germany clearly surpassed America in military aviation.\nThe Moffett Federal Airfield area is selected over dozens of competing sites by a federal committee headed by aviator Charles Lindbergh. Centrally located on the West Coast, protected by coastal mountains, next to a large body of water to transport heavy equipment, and with its mammoth, unmistakable Hangar One (Moffett Field, California) visible from the air, Naval Air Station Moffett Federal Airfield already had aircraft runways, good access to electricity and West Coast industrial centers. Stanford University, which had ongoing wind tunnel research with the Navy had a well-regarded aeronautics program, also creating a draw.\nA follow-up committee, chaired by Rear Admiral Arthur Cook, chief of the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics, recommended that the new facility should be located on the West Coast, where it could work closely with the growing aircraft industry in California and Washington.\nFollowing Congressional debate, the NACA received money for expanded facilities at Langley (pacifying the Virginia Congressman who ran the House Appropriations Committee) along with a new laboratory at Moffett Federal Airfield.\n1939\nAugust,\nNACA Charles Lindbergh Committee Established by Congress to evaluate the sites to build the west's NACA Aeronautical Laboratory\nSeptember 1,\nGerman planes, tanks, and troops invade Poland. and World War II begins.\nOctober,\n62 Acres adjacent to NAS Moffett Field are selected for an Aeronautical Laboratory\nDecember 20,\nGround is broken for the new aeronautical center\nUnder the leadership of director Smith De France, researchers came to this NACA Laboratory for more freedom to pursue new ideas. The resulting facility has been on the cutting edge of aeronautics research ever since.\n1940s\n* De-icing\n* Conical Chamber\n* Wind Tunnels\n* Flight Research\n* Swept wing\n* Transonic Theory\n1940\nThe NACA site at Moffett Federal Airfield becomes the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory, in honor of Dr. Joseph Ames, charter member of the NACA and its longtime chairman.\nKey personnel for the new laboratory came from Langley, and the junior lab tended to defer to Langley for some time.\n1941\n7 December,\nThe Japanese Attack Pearl Harbor Attack\n1945\n14 & 15 August\nEnd of World War II in Asia occurs, when armed forces of Japan surrendered to the forces of the Allied Powers\nAfter World War II\nAfter several years of managing their own wartime projects, the Ames laboratory felt less like an adolescent and more like a peer of Langley. The NACA, like NASA after it, became a family of labs, but with strong individual rivalries.\nThe Ames Aeronautical Laboratory at end of the war has 11 Navy aircraft, including the Ryan FR-1 Fireball, were assigned to the facility.\n1950s\n* Flight simulators\n* Arc Jets\n* Blunt Body ReEntry Vehicle Concept\n* Hyper-velocity Free Flight\n1950\nBuilding the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel Complex\nAt a cost of $32 million, construction of the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel at Ames began in 1950-1951 and continued until 1955.\nBecause no one wind tunnel could meet all the demands for additional research facilities simulating the entire range of aircraft and missile flight, NACA chose to build the Ames tunnel with three separate test sections drawing power from a common centralized power plant.\nThe Transonic test section spanned 11 by 11 feet, while the two Subsonic sections were smaller: nine by seven feet and eight by seven feet. Giant valves 20 feet in diameter supplied air from one supersonic leg to another.\n1955\nThe Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel Complex opens.  The American West Coast aircraft industry quickly capitalizes on the new research facility.\nFamed Boeing fleet of commercial transports and the Douglas DC-8, DC-9, and DC-10 were all tested here; as well as military aircraft such as the F-111 fighter, the C-5A transport and the B-1 bomber.\nUnitary Plan Wind Tunnel Complex facts:\nThe site Covers 11 Acres, the basic design integrates and embodies three test sections for different speeds so that a single model can be tested over the entire speed range from Mach 0.40 to Mach 3.45\n1958\nCongress creates NASA with the National Aeronautics and Space Act\nThe NACA Ames Aeronautical Laboratory was renamed NASA Ames Research Center and became a NASA field center.\n1960s\n* Lifting body\n* Project Mercury, Project Gemini, & Apollo Program Heat shield Tests\n* Apollo Program Guidance system\n* Apollo Program Re-Entry Shape\n* Tektites\n* Space Life Science\n1961\nMay 25,\nJohn F.

The NAS Moffett Federal Airfield name was changed to NASA Research Park (NRP), and the Moffett Federal Airfield (MFA).\nSupervision of Moffett Federal Airfield's two runways, three aircraft hangars, and 3.5 million square feet of facilities was turned over to the NASA Ames Research Center.\nAs the new federal custodian, NASA Ames operates the shared facility in the heart of \"Silicon Valley\" at the southern end of San Francisco Bay and serves as host to a number of other federal, civilian, and military resident agencies.\n1996\nMay\nThe American Society of Mechanical Engineers dedicated the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel complex as an International Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark.\n1997\nApril 30,\nThe Universities Space Research Association (USRA) purchases the aircraft for use as the Sofia Airborne Observatory\nOctober 27,\nNASA purchased the aircraft from the USRA\n1998\nMoffett Federal Airfield - Naval Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Toxic Remediation started.\n2000s\n* Planetary Science\n* Kepler program\n*\n* Nanotechnology\n* LCross\n* NASA Lunar Science Institute\n* Pleiades supercomputer\n2004\nNovember,\nColumbia supercomputer debuted as the second most powerful supercomputer on the TOP500 list.\n2007\nApril 26,\nSofia Airborne Observatory Maiden flight\n2009\nDecember 18,\nSofia Airborne Observatory performs the first test flight in which the telescope door was fully opened.
