It was first introduced in 1920 by American pathologists Aldred Scott Warthin (1866–1931) and Allen Chronister Starry (1890–1973), for the detection of spirochetes. It has been considered a standard stain for the detection of spirochetes, and is also used to stain Helicobacter pylori, Lawsonia intracellularis, Microsporidia, and particulates. It is also important for confirmation of Bartonella henselae, a causative organism in cat-scratch disease.\nWarthin–Starry stains organisms dark brown to black, and the background light golden brown/golden yellow.\nSee also\n*Dieterle stain\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
