It provides housing at rates pegged to the market, but without the fees associated with private renting in Japan (key money, renewal fee) or the need for a guarantor. As of 2014, it managed around 750,000 rental properties across Japan.\nHistory\nIt was founded in 1955 as the Japan Housing Corporation (Nihon Jūtaku Kōdan) to address the country's housing shortage due to post-war urbanisation. It was combined with other government organisations including the Japan Regional Development Corporation and semi-privatized in 2004 during the administration of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi (2001–06). The agency gave rise to the development of Danchi housing found in urban areas of post-war Japan.\nResidents\nAccording to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism,  public housing in Japan has priority admission, particularly those in need of stable housing, such as:\n# Elderly households\n# Households with disabilities\n# Households with significantly low income\n# Households raising children (including single-mother and single-father households, households with small children, and those with a high degree of housing distress)\n# Young couples\n# Households of victims of domestic violence\n# Households that have become unable to reside in their previous homes due to crime\n# Households of Japanese descendants remaining in China, etc.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  ([http://www.ur-net.go.jp/sitemap/english.html English])\n** [http://www.ur-net.go.jp/profile/ Profile] ([http://www.ur-net.go.jp/profile/english/ English])\n*"
