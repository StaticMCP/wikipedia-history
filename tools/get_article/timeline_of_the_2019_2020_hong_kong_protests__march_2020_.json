Protests activities largely centered around anniversaries of major events of the protests in 2019; there were also gatherings in shopping malls. Due to the growth of cases of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the city – which would not be checked until April –,  the protests were generally of considerably smaller size than before the pandemic. Police drew the dissatisfaction of demonstrators and pro-democratic politicians for their heavy-handed tactics, and for their perceived overuse of coronavirus restriction policies to dissolve rallies.\nEvents\n7 March\nTo commemorate the suicide of Marco Leung on 15 June 2019, protesters held a mourning event. At about 7 pm, over 150 people were mourning on the sidewalk outside Pacific Place and presenting flowers, lighting candles, chanting slogans, and singing \"Glory to Hong Kong\".\n8 March\n.]]\nFor the four-month milestone of Chow Tsz-lok's death, some protesters launched mourning activities in the Kwun Tong Promenade and the parking lot at Sheung Tak Estate in Tseung Kwan O. Before the event at Sheung Tak Estate began, a large number of riot police officers were patrolling the parking lot and searched private cars in the vicinity. At about 7:30 in the evening, more than 100 protesters went to the altar at a Christian cross mounted outside the car park to mourn, playing poetry and lighting candles. At 8:09, the time when Chow Tsz-lok died, people at the scene observed a minute of silence. At 8:20, police raised the blue warning flag, thereby giving warning that the assembly was unauthorised, and asked the protesters and journalists to leave. They sealed off a pedestrian road and checked ID cards and belongings of\nnearly 300 people, and raised the blue warning flag at least four more times. Video footage of a police clearance operation appeared to show a member of the riot police using his shield to push a female reporter, who was wearing a helmet and reflective vest, to the ground, with the reporter suffering injuries to the back of her head. A total of 46 men and 17 women, aged 14 to 37, were arrested at the scene for illegal assembly, possession of imitation firearms, and possession of offensive weapons. In addition, a mourning event was held at Kwun Tong Promenade. Some people mourned at the scene with a Lennon wall and wrote the words \"Keep up the heat and fight to the end\". Protests also erupted in Tai Po earlier that day at 2:00 in the afternoon.\nDozens of local residents gathered at the Tin Hau Temple for a rally to oppose the government's proposal to transform the Tai Po Jockey Club General Out-patient Clinic into a dedicated clinic for COVID-19 patients. At 3:15, police declared the assembly illegal. More than 100 protestors walked towards the Tai Po Centre, shouting slogans. Some protestors threw debris on the roads.

By 2 pm, the crowd dispersed peacefully.\n21 March\n]]\nFor the eight-month anniversary of the Yuen Long attack, in mid-afternoon, over 30 security guards and police were deployed at Yuen Long Station and over 50 riot police were stationed at the transport interchange outside the station. Police then set up roadblocks to inspect vehicles one by one at the Yuen Long section of Castle Peak Road.\nAt night, some protesters gathered in Yuen Long. During the time, some protesters blocked the road and threw petrol bombs in Qianse Square on Datang Road. Riot police fired multiple tear gas canisters without lifting the warning flag.

Police arrived only after the assailants had left, and investigated the incident.\n31 March\nOn occasion of the seven-month anniversary of the 2019 Prince Edward station attack, anti-government protesters gathered at the site of the incident. Some demonstrators gathered and hurled abuse at the police. After warning the demonstrators that they were part of an unlawful assembly, the police made 54 arrests.
