T_{0} = 0\n2. T_{0} is a constant scalar field\n3. T_{0} is a linear combination of products of delta functions \\delta_{a}^{b}\nDerivation\nA 1-parameter family of manifolds denoted by \\mathcal{M}_{\\epsilon} with \\mathcal{M}_{0} = \\mathcal{M}^{4} has metric g_{ik} = \\eta_{ik} + \\epsilon h_{ik}. These manifolds can be put together to form a 5-manifold \\mathcal{N}. A smooth curve \\gamma can be constructed through \\mathcal{N} with tangent 5-vector X, transverse to \\mathcal{M}_{\\epsilon}. If X is defined so that  if h_{t} is the family of 1-parameter maps which map \\mathcal{N} \\to \\mathcal{N} and p_{0} \\in \\mathcal{M}_{0} then a point p_{\\epsilon} \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\epsilon} can be written as h_{\\epsilon}(p_{0}). This also defines a pull back h_{\\epsilon}^{*} that maps a tensor field T_{\\epsilon} \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\epsilon}  back onto \\mathcal{M}_{0}. Given sufficient smoothness a Taylor expansion can be defined\n:h_{\\epsilon}^{*}(T_{\\epsilon}) = T_{0} + \\epsilon \\, h_{\\epsilon}^{*}(\\mathcal{L}_{X}T_{\\epsilon}) + O(\\epsilon^{2})\n\\delta T = \\epsilon h_{\\epsilon}^{*}(\\mathcal{L}_{X}T_{\\epsilon}) \\equiv \\epsilon (\\mathcal{L}_{X}T_{\\epsilon})_{0} is the linear perturbation of T. However, since the choice of X is dependent on the choice of gauge another gauge can be taken. Therefore the differences in gauge become \\Delta \\delta T = \\epsilon(\\mathcal{L}_{X}T_{\\epsilon})_0 - \\epsilon(\\mathcal{L}_{Y}T_{\\epsilon})_0 = \\epsilon(\\mathcal{L}_{X-Y}T_\\epsilon)_0. Picking a chart where X^{a} = (\\xi^\\mu,1) and Y^a = (0,1) then X^{a}-Y^{a} = (\\xi^{\\mu},0) which is a well defined vector in any \\mathcal{M}_\\epsilon and gives the result\n:\\Delta \\delta T = \\epsilon \\mathcal{L}_{\\xi}T_0.\nThe only three possible ways this can be satisfied are those of the lemma.\nSources\n*   Describes derivation of result in section on Lie derivatives"
