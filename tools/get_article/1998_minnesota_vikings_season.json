The Vikings became the third team in NFL history to win 15 games during the regular season, which earned them the National Football Conference (NFC) Central division championship and the first overall seed in the NFC playoffs. The team entered the playoffs as the favorite to win Super Bowl XXXIII, but their season ended when they were upset by the Atlanta Falcons 30–27 in the 1998 NFC Championship Game.\nThe 1998 Vikings team is known for its offense, which featured veteran quarterback Randall Cunningham, running back Robert Smith, and Hall of Fame wide receivers Cris Carter and rookie Randy Moss. The team scored an NFL record 556 points during the season, and Moss set an NFL record by catching 17 touchdown passes, the most ever by a rookie. On special teams, Gary Anderson became the first placekicker in NFL history to convert every field goal and extra point he attempted. The Vikings defense ranked sixth in the league in points allowed and was led by Hall of Fame defensive tackle John Randle.\nIn the NFC Championship Game, which was the first for the franchise in 11 years, Gary Anderson missed a field goal for the first time that season. Had the field goal been converted, it would have given the Vikings a nearly insurmountable 10-point lead late in the game. Instead, the Falcons tied the game on their ensuing drive and won by a field goal in sudden death overtime.\nThe 1998 Vikings were the first NFL team to compile a regular season record of 15–1 and not reach the Super Bowl. Their loss in the NFC Championship Game is also considered by their fans to be one of the most devastating losses in NFL history.\nThe 1998 Vikings are widely regarded as the greatest team in NFL history to not make the Super Bowl.\nDespite the team's dominance during the regular season, the Vikings only faced three teams that finished with a winning record: the Packers, the Jaguars (each of whom finished 11–5) and the Cowboys (who finished 10–6).\nOffseason\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Additions || Subtractions\n|-\n| K Gary Anderson (49ers) || CB Dewayne Washington (Steelers)\n|-\n| || LB Ron George (Chiefs)\n|-\n| || LB Jeff Brady (Panthers)\n|}\n1998 draft\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|style=\"background-color:lightsteelblue;border:1px solid #aaaaaa;width:2em\"|\n|Pro Bowler\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:gold;border:1px solid #aaaaaa;width:2em\"|\n|Pro Football Hall of Fame\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"6\" style=\"\"| 1998 Minnesota Vikings Draft\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Draft order\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Player name\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Position\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| College\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Notes\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Round\n!style=\"\"| Selection\n|-\n!1||21\n|bgcolor=gold|Randy Moss||Wide receiver||Marshall||\n|-\n!2||51\n|Kailee Wong||Linebacker||Stanford||\n|-\n!3||80\n|Ramos McDonald||Cornerback||New Mexico||\n|-\n!4||110\n|Kivuusama Mays||Linebacker||North Carolina||\n|-\n!5||144\n|Kerry Cooks||Safety||Iowa||\n|-\n!6||173\n|bgcolor=lightsteelblue|Matt Birk||Offensive tackle||Harvard||\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|7||208\n|Chester Burnett||Linebacker||Arizona||\n|-\n!225\n|Tony Darden||Cornerback||Texas Tech||Compensatory pick\n|}\nStaff\nRoster\n|Running Backs=\n|Wide Receivers=\n|Tight Ends=\n|Offensive Linemen=\n|Defensive Linemen=\n|Linebackers=\n|Defensive Backs=\n|Special Teams=\n|Reserve Lists=\n|Practice Squad=\n}}\nPreseason\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Week\n!style=\"\"| Date\n!style=\"\"| Opponent\n!style=\"\"| Result\n!style=\"\"| Record\n!style=\"\"| Venue\n!style=\"\"| Attendance\n|- style=\"background:#cfc\"\n! 1\n| August 9\n| at New England Patriots\n| W 28–0\n| 1–0\n| Foxboro Stadium\n| 54,111\n|- style=\"background:#cfc\"\n! 2\n|\n| Kansas City Chiefs\n| W 34–0\n| 2–0\n| Hubert H.

The NFL had not been happy with the Vikings' ownership arrangement of 10 owners with none owning more than 30 per cent. The ownership decided to sell the club. At first it appeared that Tom Clancy would become the new owner. However, his attempt to buy the team fell through. So in July 1998, the team was sold to McCombs, who was from San Antonio, Texas.\n1998 was a year to remember for the Minnesota Vikings. With a spectacular offense led by quarterback Randall Cunningham, who had the best year of his NFL career, running back Robert Smith, veteran wide receiver Cris Carter, and explosive rookie Randy Moss, the Vikings set a then-NFL record by scoring a total of 556 points, never scoring fewer than 24 in a game. The Vikings finished the season 15–1, their only loss by three points to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in week nine. 12 of their 15 wins came by a margin of at least 10 points.\nAccording to Football Outsiders, \"The Vikings led the league with 52 plays of 25+ yards. They had 22 offensive plays of 40+ yards; no other team had more than 16 plays of that length.\"\nSchedule\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Week\n!style=\"\"| Date\n!style=\"\"| Opponent\n!style=\"\"| Result\n!style=\"\"| Record\n!style=\"\"| Venue\n!style=\"\"| Attendance\n|- style=\"background:#cfc\"\n! 1\n| September 6\n| Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n| W 31–7\n| 1–0\n| Hubert H.

Future 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh threw a 42-yard touchdown to his former Colts teammate Floyd Turner while Corey Haris, David Palmer on kick returns and Priest Holmes on a two-yard run gave the Ravens the rest of their points scored in a 38–28 Vikings win.\nWeek 16: vs. Jacksonville Jaguars\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week 16: Jacksonville Jaguars at Minnesota Vikings&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=December 20\n|time=7:20&nbsp;p.m. CT\n|road=Jaguars\n|R1=0 |R2=3 |R3=0 |R4=7\n|home=Vikings\n|H1=3 |H2=9 |H3=14 |H4=24\n|stadium=Hubert H.

The Oilers clawed to a 13–8 halftime lead despite an intentional grounding penalty against Steve McNair that led to a safety. Two Randall Cunningham touchdowns in the third quarter put the game away to a 26–16 Vikings win, the 15th of the season. With this loss the Oilers became the first team in NFL history to have three straight 8–8 seasons.\nStandings\nPostseason\nIn the playoffs, the Vikings rolled past the Arizona Cardinals 41–21, and came into the Metrodome heavily favored for their NFC title showdown with the Atlanta Falcons, who had finished 14–2. Leading 20–7 just before halftime, the Vikings controversially called a deep pass play on third down, which led to a Cunningham fumble deep in Minnesota territory. Shortly thereafter, the Falcons scored to cut the lead to 20–14. The Vikings were again leading 27–20 with two minutes left in the fourth quarter and had a chance to potentially put the game out of reach with a field goal. However, kicker Gary Anderson, who had gone 35 for 35 in the regular season, missed a 39-yard attempt from the left hash. He pulled it left. With multiple defensive injuries for the Vikings the Falcons subsequently marched downfield and scored the game-tying touchdown several plays later.\nDennis Green instructed quarterback Randall Cunningham to take a knee on a third down deep in Viking territory with about 30 seconds remaining rather than risk having to punt back to Atlanta following their game-tying touchdown. Minnesota won the coin toss in overtime but failed to score in two overtime possessions. Atlanta eventually won 30–27 in overtime after Morten Andersen's 38-yard field goal.\nSchedule\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Round\n!style=\"\"| Date\n!style=\"\"| Opponent\n!style=\"\"| Result\n!style=\"\"| Record\n!style=\"\"| Venue\n!style=\"\"| Attendance\n|-style=\"background:#cfc\"\n!

Humphrey Metrodome and raced to a 20–7 lead in the second quarter off two Randall Cunningham touchdowns (one rushing and a throw to Randy Moss), but at the end of the first half Chris Chandler found Terance Mathis for a 14-yard score. After a Morten Andersen field goal made it 20–17 in the third, the Vikings moved back out to a 10-point lead on another Cunningham TD throw (this one to Matthew Hatchette). In the final 10 minutes of regulation, the Falcons were forced to turn the ball over on downs, but the Vikings fumbled it right back and Andersen kicked another field goal for a 27–20 score. In the final four minutes, Gary Anderson, who had not missed a field goal all season, shanked a 39-yarder to give the Falcons a chance. Chandler led the Falcons downfield and connected with Mathis in the end zone with 49 seconds remaining. The Vikings got the ball in overtime but Eugene Robinson stopped a deep pass to Moss and the Falcons got it back on a punt. Chandler led the Falcons downfield again and Andersen nailed a 38-yard field goal at 11:52 of the extra period; the 30–27 final sent the Falcons to Super Bowl XXXIII.\nStatistics\nTeam leaders\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=150px style=\"\"| Category\n!width=150px style=\"\"| Player(s)\n!width=75px style=\"\"| Value\n|-\n| Passing yards || Randall Cunningham || 3,704\n|-\n| Passing touchdowns || Randall Cunningham || 34\n|-\n| Rushing yards || Robert Smith || 1,187\n|-\n| Rushing touchdowns || Leroy Hoard || 9\n|-\n| Receiving yards || Randy Moss || 1,313\n|-\n| Receiving touchdowns || Randy Moss || 17 *\n|-\n| Points || Gary Anderson || 164 *\n|-\n| Kickoff return yards || David Palmer || 1,176\n|-\n| Punt return yards || David Palmer || 289\n|-\n| Tackles ||Ed McDaniel || 125\n|-\n| Sacks || John Randle || 10.5\n|-\n| Interceptions || Jimmy Hitchcock || 7\n|-\n| Forced fumbles || Ed McDanielJohn Randle || 3\n|}\n* Vikings single season record.\nBest performances\n* Randall Cunningham, 442 passing yards vs. Green Bay (October 5)\n* Randy Moss, 3 receptions, 163 yards, 3 TD at Dallas (November 26)\nLeague rankings\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=150px style=\"\"| Category\n!width=100px style=\"\"| Total yards\n!width=110px style=\"\"| Yards per game\n!width=80px style=\"\"| NFL rank\n|-\n| Passing offense || 4,328 || 270.5 || 1st\n|-\n| Rushing offense || 1,936 || 121.0 || 11th\n|-\n!

Moss also set the record for most receiving touchdowns for a rookie, 17, a record that still stands today.[http://www.nfl.com/players/randymoss/profile?id=MOS699912 Randy Moss]\n* The Vikings became just the third team to post a 15–1 win–loss record since the implementation of the 16-game schedule in 1978. They joined the 1984 San Francisco 49ers and the 1985 Chicago Bears, but became the first of those teams to fail to win the Super Bowl.\n* To date, the only teams to complete a 15–1 season (or better) are the 1984 San Francisco 49ers, the 1985 Chicago Bears, the 1998 Minnesota Vikings, the 2004 Pittsburgh Steelers, the 2007 New England Patriots, the 2011 Green Bay Packers and the 2015 Carolina Panthers. Only the 49ers and Bears capped their seasons with a Super Bowl victory, while the Packers were the only one of the group not to win a playoff game.\n* The Vikings' high-powered offense set a record, which stood until the 2007 season, for most points scored in a season with 556. They eclipsed the 1983 Washington Redskins, who scored 541. The 2007 New England Patriots beat the record by scoring 589 points. The 1998 Vikings now rank fifth all time, behind the 606 points scored by the 2013 Denver Broncos. It is worth noting that the 1998 Vikings followed in the footsteps of the 1983 Redskins and set a mark the 2007 Patriots and 2013 Broncos matched: none of these teams won the Super Bowl (in fact, the Vikings are the only one of these four squads not to have won their conference championship).\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/min1998.htm Pro Football Reference]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20000930001037/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/1998/playoffs/news/1999/01/17/falcons_first/index.html NFC Championship]"
