Specially for this project, McCartney also unveiled some new pieces, namely \"Haymakers\", \"Midwife\", \"Spiral\" and \"Tuesday\".  A different performance of \"A Leaf\" was originally released on 21 April 1995 on a CD single, and is presented here in a new recording.\nPerforming the new arrangements are the London Symphony Orchestra and the Loma Mar Quartet, with special orchestrations arranged by noted musicians Richard Rodney Bennett, Jonathan Tunick and Andy Stein.\nAlbum title\nThe title of this project is a pun on the phrase \"working class\", in the sense that McCartney, despite his elevated stature, still cherishes his Liverpool roots and is proud of them.  Mirroring this ideology is his pride in his rock and roll songs and willingness to transfer them into the \"elevated\" classical music genre.\nRelease and reception\n''Paul McCartney's Working Classical was another success in that genre, even though this time it failed to dent the regular US album charts, and was better received critically than his previous effort, Standing Stone''. His subsequent forays into the classical realm are 2006's Ecce Cor Meum and 2011's ''Ocean's Kingdom''.\nTrack listing\nAll pieces by Paul McCartney.\n#\"Junk\" – 2:49\n#\"A Leaf\" – 11:08\n#\"Haymakers\" – 3:33\n#\"Midwife\" – 3:33\n#\"Spiral\" – 10:02\n#\"Warm and Beautiful\" – 2:31\n#\"My Love\" – 3:48\n#\"Maybe I'm Amazed\" – 2:04\n#\"Calico Skies\" – 1:52\n#\"Golden Earth Girl\" – 1:57\n#\"Somedays\" – 3:05\n#\"Tuesday\" – 12:26\n#\"She's My Baby\" – 1:47\n#\"The Lovely Linda\" – 0:54\nReferences"
