The wedge is thickest in a band running from New York State to Quebec and extends from the Catskill mountains to Lake Huron.\nReferences\n*[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/486956/Queenston-Delta The Queenston Delta (Britannica)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081013131007/http://www.priweb.org/ed/TFGuide/NE/geo_history/history_files2/history_pdfs/ne_geohistory2.pdf Mountain Building:  The Taconic Mountains]"
