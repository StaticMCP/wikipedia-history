This was the first time that voters participating in the New Hampshire primary could vote directly for candidates, rather than for delegates to the Democratic National Convention.\nResults\nEstes Kefauver, a senator from Tennessee who made his claim to fame from his reputation as a crusader against crime and corruption, upset President Truman by a margin of 10.5 percentage points in the Granite State. Truman would soon drop out of the race, leaving the Democratic field wide open. Kefauver's victory over Truman in 1952 remains the only time an incumbent president of either party has lost the New Hampshire primary.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+New Hampshire Democratic primary, March 11, 1952\n!Candidate\n!Votes\n!Percentage\n|-\n|Estes Kefauver\n|19,800\n|54.6%\n|-\n|Harry S.
