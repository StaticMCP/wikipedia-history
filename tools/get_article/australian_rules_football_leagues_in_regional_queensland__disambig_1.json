In 1944, a league of servicemen was formed around the Atherton Tableland.  Teams represented included Wongabel, Wondelca, Kairi, Mareeba and Ravenshoe.   The league was a precursor to the nearby Cairns, Queensland league.\nIn 1955, the Townsville Australian Football League began.  Two years later the Cairns Australian Football League was formed. AFL was also introduced to Mount Isa. In the early 1970s, organised leagues started appearing in Mackay, the Darling Downs and Central Queensland.\nThe Australian Football League has occasionally played pre-season matches in Cairns and there have been semi-regular premiership matches on the Gold Coast.\nCurrent competitions\nAFL Cairns\nAFL Cairns is a semi-professional league that includes clubs from the Cairns region in Queensland, Australia.  It is widely regarded as the strongest regional Australian rules football league in Queensland and has a large base at Cazaly's Stadium which has staged Australian Football League matches.\nThe league has significant coverage in local media such as The Cairns Post. Each year the Grand Final attracts between 2,000–3,000 spectators.\nAFL Capricornia\nAFL Capricornia is an amateur competition played in the areas of Rockhampton, Gladstone and Yeppoon between the months of March and September in the cooler seasons of the Central Queensland climate.\nThe league is covered primarily by the Rockhampton Morning Bulletin in the local print media.\nAFL Darling Downs\nAFL Darling Downs is an amateur competition formed as the Darling Downs Australian Football League in 1971. It is based around the city of Toowoomba west of Brisbane. The senior representative team is known as the Demons and wear guernseys modelled on the Melbourne Demons guernseys. The Under 18 representative team who participate in the AFLQ Under 18 competition are known as the \"Crows\" and wear guernseys modelled on the Adelaide Crows guernseys.\nAFL Mackay\nAFL Mackay is an amateur competition formed as the Mackay Australian Football League in 1970. It is based around the city of Mackay with further clubs in Airlie Beach, Sarina, Alligator Creek, Pioneer Valley and Moranbah. The representative team is known as the Crows.\nAFL Mount Isa\nAFL Mount Isa is an amateur competition formed as the North West Australian Football League in 1967, changing its name to the Mount Isa AFL in 1969. Prior to this the game was played but was not organised. It is based around the city of Mount Isa.\nThe first matches in Mount Isa were played in 1932. The city had 3 clubs by 1933. Another league was formed in 1955. However the current league wasn't established until much later.\nCurrent clubs\n|zoom=7|width=650|height=550|label-color1=black|mark-coord1=|mark1=Red pog.svg|label1=Mount Isa Buffaloes|label-pos1=top|mark-coord2=|mark2=Red pog.svg|label2=Mount Isa Tigers|label-pos2=bottom|mark-coord3=|mark3=Red pog.svg|label3=Lake Nash|label-pos3=bottom|mark-coord4=|mark4=Red pog.svg|label4=Dajarra|label-pos4=right|caption=Locations of the AFL Mount Isa clubs|float=center}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Club\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Colours\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Nickname\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Home Ground\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Est.\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Years in MIAFL\n! colspan=\"2\" |MIAFL Senior Premierships\n|-\n!

Most of the previous clubs still exist and operate Auskick programs, including Dysart and Emerald.  The Moranbah Bulldogs moved to the Mackay Australian Football League after the league folded.\nThe league was a once flourishing competition with Clubs competing in Seniors, Reserves and juniors in Under 16's, 14's, and 12's.  Around 1994, the mines in the area shifted from a five-day week into a seven-day 12-hour roster, which in turn limited teams' playing rosters. The league then changed onfield playing numbers from 18 to 13 with unlimited bench players. Unfortunately this still did not help and most clubs were forced to cease operations due to lack of playing numbers and not of financial matters.\nPrior to the formation of the competition, Dysart, Middlemount and Moranbah had played in Mackay's competition.\nClubs\nFinal\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Club\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Colours\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Nickname\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Home Ground\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Former League\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Est.\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Years in CHAFL\n! colspan=\"2\" |CHAFL Senior Premierships\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Fate\n|-\n!
