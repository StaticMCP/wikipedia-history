The town of Mount Mowbullan () is located on the boundary of Bunya Mountains and the enclosed locality of Mowbullan. In the , Bunya Mountains had a population of 110 people.\nGeography\nThe locality is split between the two local government areas: the smaller north-eastern part of the locality in South Burnett Region and the larger south-western part in the Western Downs Region. The north-eastern part is almost entirely within the Bunya Mountains National Park, with a small portion of the south-western part also in the National Park. In contrast, most of the south-western part is freehold land used for agriculture. However, only a very small portion of the north-eastern part as freehold land, used for residential and agricultural purposes. The Bunya Mountain Road roughly follows the split between the two local government areas.\nThe Bunya Highway passes through the western corner of the locality.\nThe locality of Mowbullan (in the Western Downs Region) is completely enclosed by the locality of Bunya Mountains and does not form part of the national park. This enclosure within another locality is unusual in Queensland and contrary to the Queensland Government's normal policies.\nHistory\nThe locality name comes from the mountain range, Bunya Mountains, and is a Kabi language word bonyi or bunyi, indicating the Bunya pine tree (Araucaria bidwillii).\nSunnyvale State School (also known as Sunny Vale State School) opened on 11 July 1911 and closed in 1958. It was on a  site on the eastern corner of Sunnyvale Road and Blancks Road ().\nWoodlawn State School opened in early 1916. It closed circa 1944. It was on the southern corner of the junction of Woodlawn Road and Woodlawn School Road ().\nBunya Mountains Provisional School opened on 6 October 1919 and closed on 15 December 1922.\nA 670-metre tramway with a 250 metre descent from the mountain top to the bottom at Wengenville used winches, winders and flying foxes from 1923 to 1928. The logs were transferred to a horse-drawn tram for movement to a log dump.  A \"not to scale\" model of the tramway can be seen at the natural history museum at the Dandabah camping area.\nDemographics\nIn the , Bunya Mountains had a population of 144 people.\nIn the , Bunya Mountains had a population of 110 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in the locality of Bunya Mountains.
