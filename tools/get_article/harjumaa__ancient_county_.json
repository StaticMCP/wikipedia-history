Its territory roughly corresponds to modern-day Rapla County with the town of Rapla as the capital. According to the Livonian Chronicle of Henry, Raikila was the main village of Harjumaa, where annual gatherings of the surrounding tribes took place.\nDespite the name, the present-day Harju County covers only a small portion of the historical Harjumaa land, with most of its current territory corresponding to the ancient county of Revala.\nHistory\nBetween the 10th and 12th centuries, one of the largest trading centers in Haarjumaa was the Varbola Stronghold (). The first crusade to Haarjumaa occurred in the summer of 1216, initiated by the crusaders of Riga. It involved Livonians, Latgalians, and the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, led by Master Volkwin. To secure a truce, Volkwin demanded that the inhabitants of Varbola accept Christianity and release their prisoners.\nParishes\n*around Varbola\n*around Lohu\n*around Kose\nSee also\n*Danish Estonia\n*Harju County\n*Rapla County\n*History of Estonia\n*Livonian Crusade\n*Rulers of Estonia\n*St. George's Night Uprising\n*Varbola Stronghold\nReferences"
