They were joined by a few other families in 1853. In 1855, following a visit from President Brigham Young, Anson Call constructed a fort in the area, which would give the community its name for the next fifty years. Thomas Harper was hired to manage Call's farm in the spring of 1856. John Gibbs became the first branch leader (1853–1856, 1858–1860), and was succeeded by Joseph Tomlinson (1856–1858), Chester Loveland (1860–1865), James May (1865–1866), and Thomas Harper (1866–1877). Harper continued to preside over the area as bishop in 1877 when the Box Elder Stake was formed and the area was organized as the North Ward. Following Bishop Harper's death in 1899, the name of the ward was changed to Harper Ward in his honor on June 6, 1906. Harper Ward has also become the name of the associated geographical region, although its boundaries have not always been coterminous with those of the ecclesiastical unit.\nSee also\nReferences\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.boxeldercounty.org/harper-ward-history.htm Harper Ward History]"
