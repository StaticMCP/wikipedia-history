The awards are generally considered to be the highest national honors in their field, and are unofficially known as the \"Pulitzer Prizes of student journalism\".\nThe National Scholastic Press Association, headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, administers the contest for high school programs, while the Associated Collegiate Press administers the college and university contests. Pacemakers are awarded annually at the JEA/NSPA National Conference (for high schools) and the ACP/CMA National College Media Convention (for colleges) in the following categories: Newspaper, Online, Yearbook/Magazine, and Broadcast.\nNewspaper Pacemakers\nACP, NSPA and the Newspaper Association of America Foundation have co-sponsored the Pacemaker competition since 1961. NSPA began the awards in 1927. The Pacemaker competition was discontinued in 1948–49, then resumed in 1961. The awards, which are considered by many to be the highest national honors for student journalism, are unique in their judging. Several issues from each newspaper's production schedule are randomly selected to be judged, ensuring that to be competitive for a Pacemaker, a publication must show consistent quality over an entire academic year.\nJudges select Pacemaker Finalists and Pacemakers based on the following: coverage and content, quality of writing and reporting, leadership on the opinion page, evidence of in-depth reporting, design, photography, art and graphics.\nPacemakers are selected by the staff of a professional newspaper in the host city of the annual National College Media Convention, in the case of college papers, or the National High School Journalism Convention for high school publications.\nThere are multiple awards in each category every year: in 2006, there were 26 high school winners.[http://www.studentpress.org/nspa/winners/npm06.html NSPA – Contest Winners]\nOnline Pacemakers\nThis contest replaces the NSPA/ACP Best of the Net competition, which began in 1996. Member publication Web sites are not automatically entered in the Pacemaker competition; staffs must submit a Pacemaker entry form.\nOnline Pacemaker entries are judged during the months of February and March, based upon the following criteria: design, navigation, writing/editing, graphics and interactivity.[http://www.studentpress.org/nspa/contests.html#critiques NSPA – Contests]\nYearbook/Magazine Pacemakers\nYearbook/Magazine Pacemakers are judged based upon the following criteria: writing/editing, design, content, concept, photography, art and graphics.\nIn conjunction with the Yearbook Pacemaker competition, ACP/NSPA will recognize with an award of excellence the best interactive (CD/DVD) yearbooks in a separate contest. Interactive entries must include a copy of the printed book.\nBroadcast Pacemakers\nThe NSPA awards Broadcast Pacemaker awards for student-produced television news programs at high schools.\nAn entry consists of a student-produced news program or segment of a longer news program, on VHS format video tape. For the purposes of this competition, student-produced means that the majority of the planning, writing, scripting, taping and editing of the program was done by students.\nThis contest is unique to the high school level, as no similar award is offered by the ACP to college broadcast programs.\nPast winners\nThe following is a partial list of college and high school newspapers which have been
