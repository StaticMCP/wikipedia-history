He was on the books of Halifax Town without representing them in the League, and also played for Southern League clubs Mid-Rhondda United and Ebbw Vale.\nEdwards played for Wales in an amateur international match against England Amateurs in 1920. According to the Daily Express report, \"E.J. Edwards, the Merthyr outside left, was the star artist  of the Welsh attack, and his elusive runs and centres were a feature of the first half, but following change of ends he was kept well under control\"; his team lost 9–0.\nNotes\nReferences"
