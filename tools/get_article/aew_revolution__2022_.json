It is one of AEW's \"Big Four\" PPVs, which also includes Double or Nothing, All Out, and Full Gear, their four biggest domestic shows produced quarterly. During the December 8, 2021, episode of Wednesday Night Dynamite, AEW announced that the third Revolution event would take place on March 6, 2022, at the Addition Financial Arena in Orlando, Florida. Additionally, the go-home episode of Friday Night Rampage on March 4 as well as a fanfest on March 5—which included a concert featuring songs from the recently released AEW music album Who We Are: A Celebration of Excellence, Volume 1—were all held at the same venue, with the three-day event being promoted as a \"weekend spectacular.\" Tickets went on sale on December 17, 2021, with a limited number of combo packages for the three-day event also available.\nAEW partnered with Joe Hand Promotions to screen Revolution live across North America in select movie theaters. Immediately following the March 4 episode of Rampage, TNT aired a thirty-minute television special called Countdown to Revolution that previewed the event.\nStorylines\nRevolution featured professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing feuds and storylines. Storylines were produced on AEW's weekly television programs, Dynamite and Rampage, the supplementary online streaming shows, Dark and Elevation, and The Young Bucks' YouTube series Being The Elite.\nOn the February 9 episode of Dynamite,  after successfully defending the AEW World Championship, \"Hangman\" Adam Page was confronted by Adam Cole, who indicated his intentions to challenge Page for the championship as he had reached the top of the rankings to become the number one contender. The following week, the match was made official for Revolution.\nDuring Dynamites debut episode on TBS on January 5, 2022, Jurassic Express (Jungle Boy and Luchasaurus) defeated The Lucha Brothers (Penta El Zero Miedo and Rey Fénix) to win the AEW World Tag Team Championship. After numerous title defenses, it was announced on the February 16 episode that Jurassic Express would defend the title in a three-way tag team match at Revolution. Their opponents would be determined by a tag team battle royal on the February 23 episode and a Casino Tag Team Royale on the March 2 episode. reDRagon (Bobby Fish and Kyle O'Reilly) and The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) won the respective matches.\nOn the November 17, 2021, episode of Dynamite, CM Punk began feuding with MJF. After Punk defeated all of the other members of MJF's stable The Pinnacle over the next few weeks, the two finally faced each other on the February 2, 2022, episode where MJF won thanks to assistance from Wardlow, giving Punk his first loss in AEW, which was also in Punk's hometown of Chicago. On the February 9 episode, Punk demanded a rematch, which MJF would grant if Punk found a partner to defeat FTR (Cash Wheeler and Dax Harwood) in a tag team match that night. Jon Moxley was revealed as Punk's partner and they were victorious. The following week, Punk revealed the rematch against MJF would be a Dog Collar match at Revolution.\nAfter remaining undefeated for months, Thunder Rosa became the number one contender to Dr. Britt Baker, D.M.D.'s AEW Women's World Championship, reigniting an old feud between the two. The title match was made official for Revolution on the February 16 episode of Dynamite.\nOn the February 23 episode of Dynamite, after Jade Cargill retained the TBS Championship against The Bunny, she touted her undefeated record of 28–0 and issued an open challenge for the title. Tay Conti came out to accept the challenge, and the match was made official for Revolution.\nAt the 2021 Revolution, AEW held the Face of the Revolution ladder match, with the winner receiving a match for the TNT Championship. A second match was scheduled for the 2022 event, thus establishing the match as an annual tradition at Revolution.

The remaining spots were filled over the next couple of weeks, with Wardlow, Powerhouse Hobbs, Ricky Starks, Orange Cassidy, and Christian Cage each qualifying by defeating Max Caster, Dante Martin, The Dark Order's Preston \"10\" Vance, Anthony Bowens, and Ethan Page, respectively.\nChris Jericho and Eddie Kingston began feuding after Kingston began insinuating to his friends (and Jericho's Inner Circle teammates) Proud and Powerful (Santana and Ortiz) that they were being held back from their full potential and should branch out on their own, which Jericho took offense to. After confronting each other on the February 23 episode of Dynamite, a match between the two was scheduled for Revolution.\nOn the January 19 episode of Dynamite, Jon Moxley returned after taking time off to battle alcoholism. In the following weeks, Moxley would be approached by Bryan Danielson about teaming up to \"run\" AEW and mentor the younger generation of wrestlers. On the February 16 episode, Moxley responded that he had never defeated Danielson regardless of what promotion they were both in and that he would only consider teaming up if they \"bled together\" first, indicating that he wanted a match. The following week, after Moxley saved Danielson from an attack by 2point0 (Jeff Parker and Matt Lee) and Daniel Garcia, Danielson agreed to the match at Revolution.\nEvent\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ Other on-screen personnel\n!Role\n!Name\n|-\n|rowspan=4|Commentators\n|Jim Ross\n|-\n|Excalibur\n|-\n|Tony Schiavone\n|-\n|Taz\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Spanish commentators\n|Alex Abrahantes\n|-\n|Dasha Gonzalez\n|-\n|Jon Cruz\n|-\n|rowspan=2|French commentators\n|Alain Mistrangélo\n|-\n|Norbert Feuillan\n|-\n|rowspan=2|German commentators\n|Günter Zapf\n|-\n|Mike Ritter\n|-\n|rowspan=1|Ring announcer\n|Justin Roberts\n|-\n|rowspan=5|Referees\n|Aubrey Edwards\n|-\n|Bryce Remsburg\n|-\n|Paul Turner\n|-\n|Rick Knox\n|-\n|Stephon Smith\n|}\nThe Buy-In\nOn The Buy-In pre-show, three matches were contested.

For CBSSports.com, Brent Brookhouse wrote that the event was \"near-perfect\" and featured \"something for everyone, from brutal grudge matches to thrilling championship clashes.\" Kingston-Jericho was a \"brutal war\" and the \"best kind of wrestling\", the tag team championship three-way between Jurassic Express, reDRagon and The Young Bucks was \"a great spectacle\", Cargill-Conti was \"solid\", Punk-MJF was \"a near-perfect old-school dog collar match\", Baker-Rosa never \"really hit its stride\" and was \"quite disappointing\", Moxley-Danielson was \"pretty brutal\" despite a \"lackluster middle section\", and the main event was \"thrilling\" and a \"fun ride\".\nJustin Barrasso of Sports Illustrated opined that although Revolution \"wasn't a perfect show\", it was still \"an outstanding night of pro wrestling\". Barasso thought the main event match was \"superb\", the Punk-MJF match was a \"masterpiece\", Moxley-Danielson was \"physical\" and \"grisly\", and Kingston-Jericho was \"fantastic\". He was however disappointed by the women's championship match between Britt Baker and Thunder Rosa which he felt \"ran too long\" and suffered from an \"abundance of interference\".\nProfessional wrestling journalist Bryan Alvarez wrote that the event was \"wonderfully varied\" and featured five matches that could be plausibly considered the best of the night, with those being Kingston-Jericho, the three-way tag championship match, Punk-MJF, Moxley-Danielson and Page-Cole.\nCombat sports journalist Dave Meltzer assigned star ratings to the event, with Kingston-Jericho, the three-way tag match, Punk-MJF and Moxley-Danielson all receiving a rating of 4 stars out of 5. Elsewhere on the card, the main event received 4 stars, the pre-show six-man tag team was assigned 4 stars, and the six-man tornado tag match received 4 stars. The lowest rated match on the show was Cargill-Conti, which was given 2 stars.\nAftermath\nOrange Cassidy suffered an arm injury during the Face of the Revolution ladder match after he was thrown out of the ring by Keith Lee.\nResults\n|match1 = Leyla Hirsch defeated Kris Statlander by pinfall\n|stip1  = Singles match\n|time1  = 9:50\n|note1  = pre\n|match2 = Hook defeated Q.
