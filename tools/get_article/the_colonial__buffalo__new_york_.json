The building consists of three components: the 1896 five-story, brick \"Flats\" to the north; the 1900 three-story brick \"Annex\" at the south end, and a 1926 single-story precast concrete commercial storefront that unites the Flats and Annex along Delaware Avenue. The Flats and Annex are internally connected and share a similar Colonial Revival style.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.\nReferences"
