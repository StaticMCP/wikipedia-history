Warriors' head coach, Steve Kerr, has a significant connection to that Bulls team, as he previously served as a point guard during that specific season. Throughout the 2015-16 NBA season, Golden State broke over twenty-five NBA records and more than ten franchise records, including most wins ever recorded in an NBA season (regular-season and postseason combined); with 88. However, they were defeated in the NBA Finals by the LeBron James-led Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games, despite initially leading the series with a 3–1 advantage.\nThe Warriors began the 2015–16 season by winning their first 24 games, eclipsing the previous best start in NBA history, set by the 1993–94 Houston Rockets. Their record-setting start ended when they were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks on December 12, 2015. The Warriors broke a 131-year-old record of  set by the 1884 St. Louis Maroons baseball team, to claim the best start to a season in all of the major professional sports in America. They also won 28 consecutive regular-season games dating back to the 2014–15 season, eclipsing the 2012–13 Miami Heat for the second longest winning streak in NBA history. The Warriors also set an NBA record 54-straight regular-season home-game winning streak, which spanned from January 31, 2015, to March 29, 2016. The previous record of 44 was held by the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls. The Warriors also became the first team in NBA history to go the entire regular season without back-to-back losses and without losing to the same team twice.\nSteve Kerr was named Coach of the Year, the third coach in Warriors history to win the award. Stephen Curry was named Most Valuable Player for a second successive season and was the first unanimous winner in NBA history. Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson were all named to the All-Star Game, the first time the Warriors have had three All-Stars since 1976. Along with the All-Star selection, Klay Thompson was also named to the All-NBA Third Team. Draymond Green was named to the All-NBA Second Team while also being selected as an All-Star. Green was named to the All-Defensive First Team and he finished in second place in DPOY voting with 44 first-place votes. Andre Iguodala finished in second place in Sixth Man of the Year voting with 33 first-place votes. Curry broke his own NBA record for made three-pointers in a season of 286, finishing with 402. Curry won the scoring title, averaging 30.1 points per game and led the league in steals and had the best free throw percentage.

On November 24, the Warriors won at home, 111–77, against the visiting Lakers and became the first team in NBA History to start a season with a 16–0 record, besting the 15–0 record set by the 1947-48 Capitols and 1993-94 Rockets. On November 27, the Warriors set new franchise records for longest winning streak (17) and three-point field goals made (22) in a 135–116 victory over the Phoenix Suns. They also extended their streak of scoring at least 100 points in a game for 17 straight games, the first team to do since the 2009-10 Suns.\nDecember\nOn December 5, the Warriors beat the Toronto Raptors 112–109 to improve to 21–0 and set a new record for the best start to a season in all major professional sports in America, eclipsing the 20–0 mark set by the 1884 St. Louis Maroons baseball team of the Union Association. Also, with this 11th straight road victory, the Warriors set a new franchise-record for the longest road winning streak in their history.

During this game Draymond Green recorded a five-by-five game, with 24 points, 11 rebounds, 8 assists, 5 steals and 5 blocks. The feat of recording at least 20 points, 10 rebounds, five assists, five steals and five blocks has only been achieved seven times by three different players (including five times by Hakeem Olajuwon). Since the 1983–84 NBA season, only 16 players have recorded a 5x5 line. The winning streak to start the season ended at 24 games when they were beaten by the Milwaukee Bucks, 108–95. The loss also ended their 28-game winning streak (dating to the 2014–15 regular season), the second-longest in NBA history. The Warriors finished the 2015 calendar year with a 72–12 (.857) record between two seasons, the second-best winning percentage in NBA history.

They also became the fastest team ever in NBA history to clinch a playoff berth, accomplishing it in just 58 games. They bettered the 1985–86 Boston Celtics by just one day. This was also the earliest a team had clinched a playoff spot in February since the 1987–88 Los Angeles Lakers (although the  season started almost two weeks earlier than the  season did within their respective calendar years). In this game Stephen Curry also broke the single season three-point record (286), a record that he himself held, by making his 287th and 288th three-pointers of the season as two of his 12 three-pointers of the game, tying the single game NBA three-point record (jointly holding it with Kobe Bryant and Donyell Marshall).\nMarch\nOn March 3, the Warriors tied the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls for the longest regular-season home-game winning streak in NBA history (44 games), with a 121–106 victory at home against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Warriors' win streak dated back to the previous year. Entering the game on March 6, the Los Angeles Lakers (.190) and Golden State (.917) had a .727 difference in win percentage, making the Lakers' blowout 112–95 win the biggest upset in NBA history. On March 7, the Warriors won their 45th-straight regular season home game over the Orlando Magic, eclipsing the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls 44 wins in a row, to claim the NBA record.

With the win, Golden State tied their franchise record for home wins with 39, which they had set the previous season. The Warriors finished the season at an NBA-record 64 games above .500. Curry made 10 three-pointers against Memphis, making him the first player in NBA history to hit 400 threes in a single season; he finished with 402. Curry finished the season averaging 30.1 points per game, making him the first Warriors NBA scoring champion since Rick Barry in the 1966–67 NBA season. Curry became the seventh player to enter the 50–40–90 club, where he shot 50% for field goals, 45% for three-pointers and 91% for free throws during an entire regular season. This feat has only been achieved eleven times by seven players (Steve Nash having done it four times).\nPostseason\nled the Warriors to an NBA record 73–9 regular season, eclipsing the 72–10 of the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls team he was a player on.]]Golden State beat the Houston Rockets 121–94 on April 24 to go up 3–1 in the first round series, in doing so they set the NBA record for threes made in a playoff game, hitting 21-of-40 (.525).

Klay Thompson became the first player in NBA history to make at least seven three-pointers in consecutive playoff games.\nMay\nOn May 9, a 132–125 OT win over the Portland Trail Blazers put Golden State up 3–1 in the series, Steph Curry scored 40 points in his first game back after being out injured for 15 days with an MCL sprain. He scored 17 of his points in overtime, which broke the NBA record of 16 held by Gilbert Arenas for most points scored in an overtime period (regular-season or postseason). Stephen Curry was named Most Valuable Player on May 10, making it the third time a Warrior had won the award after Wilt Chamberlain won in the 1959–60 NBA season and Curry in 2014–15. Curry is the 11th player to win back-to-back MVP honors and is the first unanimous winner in NBA history with all 131 first-place votes. On May 11, the Warriors beat the Trail Blazers 125–121 in Game 5 to clinch the series and advance to the Western Conference finals for the second consecutive year, where they faced the Oklahoma City Thunder. In the game, Curry continued his streak of making a three-pointer in every playoff game he's ever played in and tied the NBA playoff record set by Reggie Miller of 44-straight.\nIn their 95th and 96th games of the season, Golden State lost back-to-back games for the first time all season (105–133 and 94–118 losses to the Thunder, putting them down 1–3 in the Western Conference finals). On May 26, Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson were named to the 2015–16 All-NBA Team, the first time three Warriors have earned the accolade since the 1955–56 season when Neil Johnston, Paul Arizin, and Jack George were selected. Curry was unanimously selected for first team honors, Green for the second team and Thompson got third team recognition. The Warriors tied the Western Conference finals series at 3–3 on May 28, with a 108–101 road win over the Thunder. Klay Thompson made eleven three-pointers, breaking the NBA playoff record of nine.

In Game 7, the Warriors defeated the Thunder 96–88, becoming only the 10th team (out of 233 teams) in NBA history to overcome a 3–1 series deficit. The win was their 85th of the year. It was the second time in NBA history that the defending champions came back from a 3–1 deficit in the conference finals, after the 1978–79 Washington Bullets. Golden State reached the NBA Finals for the second straight year, making this the franchise's first appearances in back-to-back NBA Finals since the 1946–47 season and 1947–48 season. The Warriors faced the Cleveland Cavaliers in a rematch of the 2015 NBA Finals.\nJune\nNBA Finals\nIn Game 1 on June 2, Golden State beat Cleveland 104–89. The Warriors were led by their bench, with Shaun Livingston scoring a team-high 20 points. The 35-point bench advantage (45–10) the Warriors had over the Cavs is the largest by any team in the Finals in the last 50 years. The Warriors won Game 2 by a blowout 110–77, to go up 2–0 in the series. Golden State won the first 2 games by a combined 48 points, the largest point-differential through first 2 games in NBA Finals history. After Golden State lost Game 3 by a blowout 120–90, they came back in Game 4 to win 108–97, to take a 3–1 series lead. The Warriors made 17 three-pointers, an NBA record for a single Finals game. The Warriors' win in Game 4 was their 88th of the season, which broke the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls record of 87 for most wins in an NBA season (regular-season and postseason combined). Late in the fourth quarter of Game 4, Draymond Green and LeBron James got into a scuffle. Green was retroactively charged with a Flagrant Foul 1 for swiping James in the groin and received a one-game suspension for Game 5, after accumulating his fourth flagrant foul point in the playoffs, and James was given a technical foul for taunting Green. The Cavaliers capitalized on Green's absence by beating the Warriors in Game 5 by a score of 112–97.\nAfter serving his suspension, Green returned to play in Game 6. Game 6 was played on June 16, exactly one year after Golden State won Game 6 of the 2015 NBA Finals, which was also played in Cleveland. Unlike in the 2015 NBA Finals, however, the Warriors failed to clinch the title in Game 6. The Warriors were outscored 31–11 by the Cavaliers in the first quarter, and Cleveland never relinquished their lead as Golden State lost 115–101. This was only the second time in 105 games this season (regular-season and postseason) that the Warriors lost consecutive games. The loss evened the series at three games apiece, forcing a Game 7, the first Game 7 in an NBA Finals appearance in Golden State franchise history. During the fourth quarter of Game 6, Stephen Curry, who set the record for most three-pointers in an NBA Finals series during the game (28), fouled out with his sixth personal foul. Curry angrily responded by throwing his mouthguard into the stands and hit a fan, which resulted in a technical foul and the first ejection of his career. It was the first time in 20 years that a player had been ejected from an NBA Finals game. After the game, Curry received a $25,000 fine for his actions, but was not suspended for Game 7. Warriors head coach Steve Kerr also received a $25,000 fine for his criticism of the officiating, which he felt was biased against Curry, in the post-game press conference.\nOn June 19, 2016, Golden State lost Game 7, 93–89, becoming the first team in NBA history to squander a 3–1 lead in the NBA Finals. They also became the first team in NBA history to overcome a 1–3 deficit and lose a 3–1 lead in the same playoffs. The Warriors are the 11th team in NBA history to lose a 3–1 series lead and just the fourth team in NBA history to lose an NBA Finals' Game 7 on their home court. The loss marked the first time since Steve Kerr became head coach that the Warriors had lost three straight games. Golden State became the first team in NBA history to finish with the same number of regular-season and postseason losses (9). They also became the first team in NBA history with 69 or more regular season wins that failed to win the NBA Championship.\nRecords\nGolden State broke numerous regular-season, postseason, and franchise records this year, both as a team and individually. set an NBA record for most three-pointers made in a playoff game with eleven.]]\nNBA records\nTeam\n* Best regular-season record: 73–9\n* Most wins (regular-season and postseason combined): 88 (88–18 overall record (0.830), the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls went 87–13 (.870), holding a better win percentage with only 3 postseason losses.)\n* Most road wins in a regular season: 34\n* Most road wins (regular-season and postseason combined): 38 (tied with the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls)\n* Best start: 24–0\n* Best road start: 14–0\n* Best start (number of losses): Golden State has the best start in NBA history for every number of losses from 0 to 9 except 3.
