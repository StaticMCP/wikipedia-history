Colombia is represented in the Czech Republic through its embassy in Vienna (Austria). The Czech Republic has an embassy in Bogotá and 3 honorary consulates (in Barranquilla, Cartagena and Medellín).\nHistory\nThe first connections between Czech lands and the area of current Colombia occurred in the times of colonial era, during missionary activities of Jesuits in that area. In 1860/1870s the Czech botanist Benedikt Roezl discovered the cycad plant Zamia roezlii on the Pacific coast in Colombia. The plant is named after him. In 1922 began the consulary activities between Czechoslovakia and Colombia. Since 1926 the Colombian consul has had his seat in Prague. In 1935 both countries agreed to exchange ambassadors.\nIn 2008, during his visit in Colombia, the Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek negotiated a potential sale of the combat aircraft Aero L-159 ALCA with Colombian President Álvaro Uribe.\nSee also\n* Foreign relations of Colombia\n* Foreign relations of the Czech Republic\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160125200642/http://www.embcol.or.at/index_eng.htm  Colombian embassy in Vienna (also accredited to the Czech Republic)]\n*[http://www.mzv.cz/wwwo/?zu=bogota  Czech embassy in Bogota (in Czech and Spanish only)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090223193009/http://www.camaracolombocheca.com/ Colombia-Czech Chamber of Commerce]\n* [http://www.mzv.cz/bogota/cz/vzajemne_vztahy/bilateralni_dohody_mezi_cr_a_kolumbii.html Bilateral treaties between Colombia and the Czech Republic from 1973 to 2009]\n* [http://www.czech.cz/cz/ceske-listy/aktuality/slavnostni-akt-zahajeni-cz-pres-v-kolumbii?i=4 CZ PRES agency opens its activity in Colombia]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090327190150/http://www.businessinfo.cz/cz/rubrika/kolumbie/1001054/ Detailed information about cooperation between Colombia and the Czech Republic at BusinessInfo.cz]"
