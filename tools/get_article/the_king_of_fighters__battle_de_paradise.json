It was released on June 6, 2000 by SNK in Japan. Based on The King of Fighters fighting game series by SNK, the story focuses on four characters created for this installment who are transferred into the game console and take on an adventure assisted by The King of Fighters characters and other SNK IPs. The game was rereleased on November 9, 2022 as part of the NEOGEO Pocket Color Selection Vol. 2 by SNK.\nGameplay\nThe game is a digital tabletop game similar to sugoroku where characters compete against each other in a map where they throw dices to progress and find enough stars to become the winner. There are four playable character:  Yu G, Ai, Masamune, and Hatako. The main game takes place on the map screen. Players first decide who will go first and who will go second, then roll the dice and move their pieces the number of times the dice rolls. Once they have completed the number of turns at the start, the game ends. If they land on a square along the way, a battle game or event may occur.\nPlayers are assisted by \"Strikers\", fighters created by SNK. The game ''The King of Fighters '99  features them. The new Strikers are Kyo Kusanagi, Athena Asamiya, Goro Daimon, Billy Kane, Ryuji Yamazaki, Chizuru Kagura, Syo Kirishima, Alfred, Fiolina Germi, and Gai Tendo. Points won in Battle de Paradise can be transferred to The King of Fighters '99: Evolution to speed up the leveling process for the Extra Strikers.\nEX Strikers have two attributes: good and evil, which the player can choose at the start of the game. The two attributes change their appearance, the content and options available during events, and the design of cards used. Depending on how the event unfolds, the attribute itself may change. Players start at level 1 and level up with the stars they obtain. There is a question mark on the EX Striker selection screen, and if the player meets certain conditions, they will be able to select the striker hidden behind the question mark.\nReception\nHardcore Gaming 101 said that that while the game could be labeled as a Mario Party focused on The King of Fighters based on similar gameplay, Japanese players played it more for the Dreamcast port of The King of Fighters '99'' which was inaccessible in Western regions. As a result, the writer believes the game did not age well for modern gamers he believes there is not much to attract returning fans.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20030218205307/http://www.personal.triticom.com/~erm/www.neogeo.co.jp/kof00/toppage/para_index.htm Official website (archived)]"
