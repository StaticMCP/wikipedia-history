After every ODI match, the two teams involved receive points based on a mathematical formula. Each team's points total is divided by their total number of matches played to give a rating, and all the teams are ranked in a table in order of rating.\nBy analogy to cricket batting averages, the points for winning an ODI match are always greater than the team's rating, increasing the rating, and the points for losing an ODI match are always less than the rating, reducing the rating. A drawn match between higher and lower rated teams will benefit the lower-rated team at the expense of the higher-rated team. An \"average\" team that wins as often as it loses while playing a mix of stronger and weaker teams should have a rating of 100.\nAs of 22 August 2025, India leads the ICC Men's ODI Team Rankings, with a rating of 999 from 36 weighted matches, while the lowest rated team, UAE, has a rating of 08 from 32 weighted matches.\nUntil 2013, the team ranked number one at the annual 1 April cut-off date received the ICC ODI Championship Shield and prize money. The rankings was used to award direct qualification for the Cricket World Cup in 2019 and will be used in the 2027.\nCurrent rankings\nAssociate rankings\nCaptain Paras Khadka batting during the 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three in Bermuda]]\nIn late 2005, the International Cricket Council ranked the top non-Test nations from 11–30 to complement the Test nations' rankings in the ICC Men's ODI Team Rankings. The ICC used the results from the 2005 ICC Trophy and WCQS Division 2 competition (i.e. the primary qualification mechanisms for the 2007 Cricket World Cup) to rank the nations.\nThese rankings were used to seed the initial stage of the global World Cricket League. Teams ranked 11–16 were placed into Division 1; teams 17–20 were placed into Division 2; teams 21–24 were placed into Division 3; the remaining teams were placed into the upper divisions of their respective regional qualifiers.\nBefore 19 April 2009, the top six associates gained one day status. Kenya and Ireland both qualified to appear on the main rating table, Kenya from its existing status and Ireland for its two victories in the 2007 World Cup.  Following their victory over Bangladesh in July 2010, the Netherlands joined the main table. Afghanistan, Canada and Scotland remained on the secondary table. In May 2009, the ICC added a rankings table for all associate members. This contained both global and regional placings. In June 2018, the four associates with ODI status were moved to the main ranking list.\nHistorical rankings\nThe ICC provides ratings for the end of each month back to October 2002. This table lists the teams that have successively held the highest rating since that date, by whole month periods.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Team\n! Start\n! End\n! Total months\n!

The table only begins from 1981 as, prior to this date, there is not enough data available due to the infrequency of matches and the small number of competing teams in the earlier periods.\nThe teams that have successively held the highest rating since January 1981 until September 2002, by whole month periods, are:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Like a 2 euro coin, the shield features an inner circle of gold-coloured metal and is surrounded by a ring of silver-coloured metal. It was first presented in December 2002, when Australian captain Ricky Ponting received the award.\nIt was last presented in July 2013, when Indian captain MS Dhoni received the award.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

To determine the teams' new ratings after a particular match, first calculate the points earned from the match:\nIf the gap between the ratings of the two teams before the match was less than 40 points, then:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background: #BFB6A3;\"| Match result\n! style=\"background: #BFB6A3;\"| Points earned\n|-\n| Win || Opponent's rating + 50\n|-\n| Tie || Opponent's rating\n|-\n| Lose || Opponent's rating − 50\n|}\nIf the gap between the ratings of the two teams before the match was at least 40 points, then:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background: #BFB6A3;\"| Match result\n! style=\"background: #BFB6A3;\"| Points earned\n|-\n| Stronger team wins || Own rating + 10\n|-\n| Weaker team loses || Own rating − 10\n|-\n| style=\"border-width:4px 1px 1px 1px;border-style:solid;border-color:pale grey\" | Stronger team ties || style=\"border-width:4px 1px 1px 1px;border-style:solid;border-color:pale grey\" | Own rating − 40\n|-\n| Weaker team ties || Own rating + 40\n|-\n| style=\"border-width:4px 1px 1px 1px;border-style:solid;border-color:pale grey\" | Stronger team loses || style=\"border-width:4px 1px 1px 1px;border-style:solid;border-color:pale grey\" | Own rating − 90\n|-\n| Weaker team wins || Own rating + 90\n|}\n* Each team's rating is equal to its total points scored divided by the total matches played. (Series are not significant in these calculations).\n* Add the match points scored to the points already scored (in previous matches as reflected by the Table), add one to the number of matches played, and determine the new rating.\n* Points earned by teams depend on the opponent's ratings, therefore this system needed to assign base ratings to teams when it started.\nSee also a detailed example at: ICC Men's T20I Team Rankings#Example\nYear end Historical Ranking\nIn 2011, David Kendix, the ICC's official statistician retrospectively applied its rating system to results since 1981, providing ratings for the end of each month back to 1981.\n{|\n|-valign=top\n|\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=55|Year\n!width=120|Team\n!width=55|Rating\n|-\n|1981\n|\n| 121\n|-\n|1982\n|rowspan=\"5\" |\n| 133\n|-\n|1983\n| 132\n|-\n|1984\n| 133\n|-\n|1985\n| 139\n|-\n|1986\n| 140\n|-\n|1987\n|rowspan=\"3\" |\n| 133\n|-\n|1988\n| 132\n|-\n|1989\n| 119\n|-\n|1990\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| 122\n|-\n|1991\n| 127\n|-\n|1992\n|\n| 120\n|-\n|1993\n|\n| 115\n|-\n|1994\n|\n| 114\n|-\n|1995\n|\n| 113\n|-\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=55|Year\n!width=120|Team\n!width=55|Rating\n|-\n|1996\n|rowspan=\"4\" |\n| 121\n|-\n|1997\n| 134\n|-\n|1998\n| 132\n|-\n|1999\n| 129\n|-\n|2000\n|rowspan=\"11\" |\n| 125\n|-\n|2001\n| 128\n|-\n|2002\n| 131\n|-\n|2003\n| 136\n|-\n|2004\n| 136\n|-\n|2005\n| 135\n|-\n|2006\n| 131\n|-\n|2007\n| 130\n|-\n|2008\n| 131\n|-\n|2009\n| 130\n|-\n|2010\n| 128\n|-\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=55|Year\n!width=120|Team\n!width=55|Rating\n|-\n|2011\n|\n| 130\n|-\n|2012\n|\n| 121\n|-\n|2013\n|\n| 120\n|-\n|2014\n|rowspan=\"3\" |\n| 117\n|-\n|2015\n| 127\n|-\n|2016\n| 120\n|-\n|2017\n|\n| 120\n|-\n|2018\n|rowspan=\"3\" |\n| 126\n|-\n|2019\n| 125\n|-\n|2020\n| 123\n|-\n|2021\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n| 121\n|-\n|2022\n| 116\n|-\n|2023\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n| 121\n|-\n|2024\n| 118\n|-\n|}\n|}\nSee also\n*ICC Men's Test Team Rankings\n*ICC Men's T20I Team Rankings\n*World Cricket League\n*International cricket\n*ICC Women's ODI and T20I rankings\n*ICC Player Rankings\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.icc-cricket.com/rankings/mens/team-rankings/odi ICC Men's ODI Team Rankings]"
