The song was her second time being nominated for the category and her third nomination overall. The song was also featured in the NBC sitcom Superstore, further highlighting its cultural resonance in television\nBackground\n\"'King of Anything' is sort of a 'f[uck] you' song,\" Bareilles said. \"I've had more unsolicited advice on my life than I care to mention, and this was how I dealt with it. It felt empowering to turn that frustration into music, especially a song that doesn't even sound angry. That's sort of what 'Love Song' was as well. Apparently, I don't get over things very quickly.\"\nRelease\n\"King of Anything\" was released to radio in the US on May 10, 2010. It was released for sale on June 22, 2010.\nIt was released in Europe in the spring of 2011.\nMusic video\nThe music video was released on June 29, 2010.
