      "text": "# Wrestle Kingdom\n\nWrestle Kingdom is a professional wrestling event produced annually by New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), a Japan-based professional wrestling promotion.\nSince 1992, NJPW has held their January 4 Tokyo Dome Show. The January 4 Tokyo Dome Show became NJPW's premier annual event and the biggest event in Japanese wrestling, similar to what WrestleMania is for WWE and American professional wrestling. It has been described as \"the largest professional wrestling show in the world outside of the United States\" and the \"Japanese equivalent to the Super Bowl\". From 1992 to 2006, the event was promoted under different names. In 2007, the event was rebranded as Wrestle Kingdom which has been the event name ever since.\nFrom 2007 until 2019, Wrestle Kingdom was held on January 4 on Tokyo Dome, but the show expanded to two nights in 2020. Wrestle Kingdom 14 was the first one to include matches on January 5, and further expanded to include a third night (January 8) in 2022.\nWrestle Kingdom VI drew the highest single-day attendance since the annual event was branded as Wrestle Kingdom, at 43,000. Counting events held over two nights, Wrestle Kingdom 14 had the highest overall attendance, with 40,008 announced for night one and 30,063 for night two, a total of 70,071 attendees.\nThe lowest attendance was for Wrestle Kingdom 15, held under attendance restrictions due to COVID-19; NJPW announced an attendance of 12,689 for the first night and 7,801 for the second. Prior to COVID-19, the Wrestle Kingdom I and Wrestle Kingdom V events drew the lowest unofficial gates, with only 18,000 in attendance.\nEvents\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" align=\"center\"\n!|#\n!|Event\n!|Date\n!|City\n!|Venue\n!|Main Event\n!|Ref\n|-\n|1\n|Wrestle Kingdom I\n|January 4, 2007\n| rowspan=\"19\" |Tokyo, Japan\n| rowspan=\"19\" |Tokyo Dome\n| align=\"left\" |Keiji Muto and Masahiro Chono vs. Tencozy (Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Satoshi Kojima)\n|\n|-\n|2\n|Wrestle Kingdom II\n|January 4, 2008\n|align=\"left\"|Hiroshi Tanahashi (c) vs. Shinsuke Nakamura for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship\n|\n|-\n|3\n|Wrestle Kingdom III\n|January 4, 2009\n|align=\"left\"|Keiji Muto (c) vs. Hiroshi Tanahashi for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship\n|\n|-\n|4\n|Wrestle Kingdom IV\n|January 4, 2010\n|align=\"left\"|Shinsuke Nakamura (c) vs. Yoshihiro Takayama for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship\n|\n|-\n|5\n|Wrestle Kingdom V\n|January 4, 2011\n|align=\"left\"|Satoshi Kojima (c) vs. Hiroshi Tanahashi for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship\n|\n|-\n|6\n|Wrestle Kingdom VI\n|January 4, 2012\n|align=\"left\"|Hiroshi Tanahashi (c) vs. Minoru Suzuki for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship\n|\n|-\n|7\n|Wrestle Kingdom 7\n|January 4, 2013\n|align=\"left\"|Hiroshi Tanahashi (c) vs. Kazuchika Okada for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship\n|\n|-\n|8\n|Wrestle Kingdom 8\n|January 4, 2014\n|align=\"left\"|Shinsuke Nakamura (c) vs. Hiroshi Tanahashi for the IWGP Intercontinental Championship\n|\n|-\n|9\n|Wrestle Kingdom 9\n|January 4, 2015\n|align=\"left\"|Hiroshi Tanahashi (c) vs. Kazuchika Okada for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship\n|\n|-\n|10\n|Wrestle Kingdom 10\n|January 4, 2016\n|align=\"left\"|Kazuchika Okada (c) vs. Hiroshi Tanahashi for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship\n|\n|-\n|11\n|Wrestle Kingdom 11\n|January 4, 2017\n|align=\"left\"|Kazuchika Okada (c) vs. Kenny Omega for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship\n|\n|-\n|12\n|Wrestle Kingdom 12\n|January 4, 2018\n|align=\"left\"|Kazuchika Okada (c) vs. Tetsuya Naito for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship\n|\n|-\n|13\n|Wrestle Kingdom 13\n|January 4, 2019\n|align=\"left\"|Kenny Omega (c) vs. Hiroshi Tanahashi for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|14\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Wrestle Kingdom 14\n|January 4, 2020\n| align=\"left\"|Kazuchika Okada (c) vs. Kota Ibushi for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n|January 5, 2020\n|Kazuchika Okada (Heavyweight) vs. Tetsuya Naito (Intercontinental) in a Double Gold Dash match for both the IWGP Heavyweight Championship and the IWGP Intercontinental Championship\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|15\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Wrestle Kingdom 15\n|January 4, 2021\n| align=\"left\" |Tetsuya Naito (c) vs. Kota Ibushi for both the IWGP Heavyweight Championship and the IWGP Intercontinental Championship\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n|January 5, 2021\n|Kota Ibushi (c) vs. Jay White for both the IWGP Heavyweight Championship and the IWGP Intercontinental Championship\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|16\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Wrestle Kingdom 16\n|January 4, 2022\n| align=\"left\" |Shingo Takagi (c) vs. Kazuchika Okada for the IWGP World Heavyweight Championship\n|rowspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n|January 5, 2022\n|Kazuchika Okada (c) vs. Will Ospreay for the IWGP World Heavyweight Championship\n|-\n|January 8, 2022\n|Yokohama, Japan\n|Yokohama Arena\n|Kazuchika Okada and Hiroshi Tanahashi vs. Keiji Muto and Kaito Kiyomiya\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|17\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Wrestle Kingdom 17\n|January 4, 2023\n|Tokyo, Japan\n|Tokyo Dome\n|align=\"left\"|Jay White (c) vs. Kazuchika Okada for the IWGP World Heavyweight Championship\n|\n|-\n|January 21, 2023\n|Yokohama, Japan\n|Yokohama Arena\n|Tetsuya Naito vs. Kenoh\n|\n|-\n|18\n|Wrestle Kingdom 18\n|January 4, 2024\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Tokyo, Japan\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Tokyo Dome\n|align=\"left\"|Sanada (c) vs. Tetsuya Naito for the IWGP World Heavyweight Championship\n|\n|-\n|19\n|Wrestle Kingdom 19\n|January 4, 2025\n|align=\"left\"| Zack Sabre Jr. (c) vs. Shota Umino for the IWGP World Heavyweight Championship\n|\n|-\n|20\n|Wrestle Kingdom 20\n|January 4, 2026\n|align=\"left\"| Konosuke Takeshita (World) vs. Yota Tsuji (Global) in a Winner Takes All match for the IWGP World Heavyweight Championship and IWGP Global Heavyweight Championship\n|\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\"|}}\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n*List of New Japan Pro-Wrestling pay-per-view events\n*Professional wrestling at the Tokyo Dome\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.njpw.co.jp/ The official New Japan website]"
