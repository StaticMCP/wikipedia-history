Each is listed below; where two dates are shown, the first indicates the date of receiving the title or award (the title as Prince Edward being given as from his birth) and the second indicates the date of its loss or renunciation.\nRoyal and noble titles and styles\n* 10 March 1964 – 19 June 1999: His Royal Highness The Prince Edward\n* 19 June 1999 – 10 March 2019: His Royal Highness The Earl of Wessex\n* 10 March 2019 – 10 March 2023: His Royal Highness The Earl of Wessex and Forfar\n* 10 March 2023 – present: His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh\nFrom birth until his marriage, Edward was known as \"His Royal Highness The Prince Edward\". Royal commentators conjectured that he – in line with standing tradition – might be granted a former royal dukedom upon marriage, e.g. that of Cambridge or Sussex. Instead, on 19 June 1999, he was created Earl of Wessex, and thus became \"His Royal Highness Prince Edward, The Earl of Wessex\". He was the first prince since the Tudors to be created an earl (thus reserving future advancement to a dukedom). The Sunday Telegraph reported that he was drawn to the earldom of Wessex after watching the 1998 film Shakespeare in Love, in which a minor character with that title was played by Colin Firth. Edward was also granted the subsidiary title of Viscount Severn. Buckingham Palace announced the intention that Edward would eventually be created Duke of Edinburgh, a title then held by his father, Prince Philip, once it had merged in the Crown upon the death of both his parents.\nOn 10 March 2019, his 55th birthday, Edward was granted the additional title of Earl of Forfar for use in Scotland. He was at times referred to as the \"Earl of Wessex and Forfar\", such as at the funeral of his father and the state funeral of his mother.\nOn his 59th birthday, 10 March 2023, Edward was created Duke of Edinburgh, thus becoming \"His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh\". All his peerage titles contain the standard remainder to 'heirs male of his body', except for his ducal title, which is not hereditary and will revert to the crown upon his death.\nMilitary ranks\n;\n*  Royal Marines\n** October 1986 – January 1987: Second Lieutenant\nCommonwealth honours\nCommonwealth realms\nAppointments (Shown in order in which appointments were made, not order of precedence)\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Appointments from Commonwealth realms\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Country\n! scope=\"col\"| Date\n! scope=\"col\"| Appointment\n! scope=\"col\"| Ribbon\n! scope=\"col\"| Post-nominalletters\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"|\n| 10 March 1989\n| Commander of the Royal Victorian Order\n| rowspan=\"3\"|\n| CVO\n|-\n| 2 June 2003\n| Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order\n| KCVO\n|-\n| 10 March 2011\n| Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order\n| GCVO\n|-\n|\n| 11 May 2005\n| Member of the Saskatchewan Order of Merit\n|\n| SOM\n|-\n|\n| 1 August 2004\n| Personal Aide-de-Camp to the Sovereign\n|\n| ADC\n|-\n|   England and Wales\n| 23 April 2006\n| Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter\n|\n| KG\n|-\n|\n| 10 March 2024\n| Extra Knight of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle\n|\n| KT\n|}\nDecorations and medals (Shown in order in which appointments were made, not order of precedence)\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:0.5em 1em 0.5em 0; border:1px solid #005566; border-collapse:collapse;\"\n!
