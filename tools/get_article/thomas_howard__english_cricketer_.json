He was mainly associated with Hampshire sides but also played for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), where he was employed as a ground staff bowler.\nHoward was a right-handed batsman and an occasional wicketkeeper but he was noted as a right arm fast medium bowler, using the underarm style.  He made 88 known appearances in first-class cricket and is one of a handful of players who appeared for both teams in the Gentlemen v Players series.\nHoward played for the Players in the inaugural and second Gentlemen v Players matches in 1806 and made further appearances for the Players to 1829.
