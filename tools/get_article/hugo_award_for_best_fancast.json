The Hugo Awards have been described as \"a fine showcase for speculative fiction\" and \"the best known literary award for science fiction writing\".\nTo be eligible for the award, a fancast must have released four or more episodes by the end of the previous calendar year, at least one of which appeared in that year, and it must not qualify for the dramatic presentation category. It must also not provide or be published by an entity that provides a quarter or more of the income of any one person working on the fancast. The name of the award is a portmanteau of fan and podcast. The Hugo Award for Best Fancast was first proposed as a category after the 2011 awards, and then appeared as a temporary category at the 2012 awards. Temporary awards are not required to be repeated in following years. The 2013 awards, however, did repeat the category, and afterwards it was ratified as a permanent category.\nDuring the 14 years the award has been active, 33 fancasts by 89 people have been finalists, and 10 of those fancasts have won. SF Squeecast, created by a team of five people, won the first two awards in 2012 and 2013, and Our Opinions Are Correct, by Annalee Newitz and Charlie Jane Anders, won three times. They are the only fancasts to win multiple times. The Coode Street Podcast, by Jonathan Strahan and Gary K. Wolfe, won in 2021, and has received the most final ballot nominations at eleven.\nSelection\nHugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual World Science Fiction Convention, or Worldcon, and the awards presentation constitutes its central event. Supporting members are those who do not attend the convention itself, and pay a smaller membership fee as a result. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as instant-runoff voting with six finalists, except in the case of a tie. The fancasts on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of fancasts that can be nominated. Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six finalists is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held. Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations. Worldcons are generally held near the start of September, and are held in a different city around the world each year. Members are permitted to vote \"no award\", if they feel that none of the finalists is deserving of the award that year, and in the case that \"no award\" takes the majority the Hugo is not given in that category. This happened in the Best Fancast category in 2016.\nWinners and finalists\nIn the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the story was first published.
