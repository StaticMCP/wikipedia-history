The old dictator fought at first and then decided that he had had enough. He left power in the hands of a military triumvirate”.\nThe new junta was made up of Buenaventura Pineda, Eduardo Villagrán, and Federico Ponce Vaides.\nOn July 4, the most ambitious member of the junta, General Ponce, easily convinced a Congress to elect him provisional president.\nPonce’s troops round up the congressional delegates and force them to vote for him.\nReferences"
