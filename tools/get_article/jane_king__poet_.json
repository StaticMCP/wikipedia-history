After St Joseph's Convent in St Lucia, she won a St Lucia island scholarship to study at the University of Edinburgh. Since 1976 she has taught in various institutions, including the Sir Arthur Lewis Community College in Castries, where she also served as the Dean of their Division of Arts and General Studies.\nKing has published three collections of poems: Into the Centre (1993), Fellow Traveller (1994) and Performance Anxiety (2013).Commonwealth Writers Prize, Caribbean and Canada, and James Rodway Memorial Prize). Her poems are known for the wry wit with which they address the place of a light-skinned narrator in a race-conscious Caribbean as well as concerns over the role of the creative imagination in Caribbean societies.\nShe is also an actor and theatre director, co-founder of St Lucia's Lighthouse Theatre Company.\nShe is married to poet Kendel Hippolyte.\nFurther reading\n* Kwame Dawes (ed), Talk Yuh Talk: Interviews With Anglophone Caribbean Poets, University Press of Virginia, 2001, pp.&nbsp;173–82. .\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://archive.today/20130414130903/http://www.commonwealthwriters.org/interview-with-st-lucian-poet-jane-king/ \"Interview with St Lucian poet, Jane King\", Commonwealth Writers, 22 April 2012.]"
