Although it was constitutionally stipulated that his term would end on 20 February 1892, Andueza planned to reform the Constitution in order to prolong his stay in power for two more years, which is why he was called a Continuationist.\nJoaquín Crespo took up arms on March 11 in his power base of \"El Totumo\", in Guárico state, starting the war that spread to the rest of the country. The government appointed General Sebastián Casañas, commander of the army, to fight the Revolution while Generals Ramón Guerra, Wenceslao Casado and José Manuel Hernández, known as \"El Mocho Hernández\", joined the Legalist movement of Joaquin Crespo.\nBattle of Jobo Mocho and international naval squadron\nOn 15 April 1892, Joaquin Crespo defeated the Minister of War Sebastián Casañas in the Battle of Jobo Mocho and made him retreat to Calabozo.

On May, General Cipriano Castro as presidente of Táchira state organized an army to confront the Legalist Revolution and launched a military campaign that began with the defeat of 2,000 men under the command of Espíritu Santo Morales and Eliseo Araujo. After successful battles in Palmira and San Juan de Lagunillas, he entered Mérida intending to march on Caracas, but Joaquín Crespo's advance against the Andueza troops, indicative of a massive victory for the revolution, forced him to abandon the campaign. During the unrest in Venezuela, locals had attacked European nationals who demanded coercity actions from its diplomats in Caracas.

The general Luciano Mendoza was appointed by President  Villegas as chief of the governmental army and was able to defeat Joaquín Crespo at the Cortada del Guayabo on July 1st. However, before the advances of the revolutionaries, general Mendoza must retreat to Caracas where he establishes a Military Triumvirate along with the general Julio Sarria (at that time Minister of War and Navy) and Domingo Monagas that attempted to confront, from Caracas, the forces of Crespo, and the establishment of a military dictatorship de fact. Manuel González Gil, a young man appointed by Crespo to protect his farms in Caura region received 700 men destined to introduce the Legalist revolution on Bolivar State. However, Gil was not welcome in the Roscio Division by order of Generals José Manuel Hernández and Domingo Sifontes the chiefs of revolution in the Yuruary Federal Territory. His only option was to return to Caura region and wait for the revolution triumph, which it did after the defeat of General Santo Carrera and the State President, Juan Teófilo Siegert Jr. in Orocopiche island.
