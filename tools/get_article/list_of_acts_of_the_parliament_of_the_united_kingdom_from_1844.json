For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".\nSome of these acts have a short title. Some of these acts have never had a short title. Some of these acts have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n7 & 8 Vict.\nThe fourth session of the 14th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 1 February 1844 until 5 September 1844.\nPublic general acts\nempowering the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Woods to raise Money for certain Improvements in the Metropolis, on the Security of the Land Revenues of the Crown within the County of Middlesex and City of London.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| or the Textile Factory Act 1844or '''Graham's Factory Act'''|public|15|06-06-1844|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to amend the Laws relating to Labour in Factories.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  for securing the Debt due by the City of Edinburgh to the Public.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|  for the better Prevention and Punishment of Assaults in Ireland.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  intituled \"An Act for extending to Ireland the Provisions not already in force there of an Act of the Third and Fourth Years of the Reign of the late King William the Fourth, intituled 'An Act for the Limitation of Actions and Suits relating to Real Property, and for simplifying the Remedies for trying the Rights thereto;' and to explain and amend the said Act.\"}}\n|  }}\n|  for the more effectual Prevention of Persons going armed by Night for the Destruction of Game.}}\n|  for the Appointment of a Stipendiary Magistrate to act within the Townships of Manchester and Salford.}}\n|\n| or the Peel Banking Act|public|32|19-07-1844|maintained=y|archived=n|An Act to regulate the Issue of Bank Notes, and for giving to the Bank of England certain Privileges for a limited Period.}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  for the Conveyance of Sites for Schools.}}\n|  to consolidate and amend the Laws for the Emulation of Charitable Loan Societies in Ireland.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n| or the '''Dissenters' Chapels Act 1844|public|45|19-07-1844|archived=n|An Act for the Regulation of Suits relating to Meeting Houses and other Property held for religious Purposes by Persons dissenting from the United Church of England and Ireland.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  for encouraging the Establishment of District Courts and Prisons.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  for the Appointment and Payment of Parish Constables.}}\n|  }}\n|  to amend the Laws relating to Loan Societies.|note4= }}\n| or the Copyhold Lands Act 1844'''|public|55|29-07-1844|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to amend and explain the Acts for the Commutation of certain Manorial Rights in respect of Lands of Copyhold and Customary Tenure, and in respect of other Lands subject to such Rights;
