The functions assigned these two commands had been previously performed by the Headquarters Command, Commander in Chief, Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean (CINCNELM). Personnel assigned upon this establishment were largely drawn from the CINCNELM staff.\nIn 1958, the US Naval Facility, London was designated as the US Naval Support Activity, London. As other Naval activities in the United Kingdom and Northwestern Europe were established, the command was designated by the Secretary of the Navy to its present title of US Naval Activities, United Kingdom (NAVACTUK). In August 1965, the US Naval Support Activities, London was disestablished and reassigned to COMNAVACTUK, consolidating the support activity and old facility into one command.\nCNAUK was disbanded on 14 September 2007 at RAF Daws Hill.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.cnauk.navy.mil COMNAVACTUK Official Web Site]\n* [http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/navy/unit/comnavbase.htm COMNAVBASE/COMNAVACTUK] Federation of American Scientists\n* Globalsecurity.org, [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/london.htm Facilities in London]"
