Brigadier Jerónimo Valdés and culminated with the defeat of Patriots whose army would be almost completely destroyed two days later at the Battle of Moquegua with support of General José de Canterac.\nThe battle\nAfter José de San Martín had abandoned Peru in September 1822, command of the United Peruvian army fell to General Rudecindo Alvarado, under whose command the United army was ordered to defeat the bulk of the Royalist troops that were still intact in the south and the country's mountains.  The first goal was to take the remaining ports under Spanish control, intermediate between Arequipa and Tarapacá. Therefore this expedition was called the First Intermediate Campaign.\nIn the first days of October, Alvarado's expedition, composed of approximately 4,300 troops and 10 pieces of artillery, sailed from Callao and on 6 December, it landed in Arica.\nSpanish Viceroy José de la Serna, located in Cusco, ordered Brigadier Gerónimo Valdés to immediately march to Arequipa to take command of the troops stationed there, and attack the army of Alvarado.\nBoth armies met at Torata and the battle ended in a defeat for the Patriots, mainly because of dissensions between the officers and a lack of discipline amongst the troops.\nReferences"
