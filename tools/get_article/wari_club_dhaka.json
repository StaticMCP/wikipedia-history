It  currently competes in the Bangladesh Championship League (BCL). Wari Club is the oldest football club in Bangladesh, established in 1898. The club's motto is One heart one mind.\nHistory\nIn 1898, after the discontinuation of Wellington Club, a few of its sports-loving members decided to form the Wari Club. During the British rule in India, Rai Bahadur Surendranath Rai played a key role in forming the club. After gaining popularity, the club in 1930, found their playing field at Paltan ground in Dacca. The first success came in 1910 at Cooch Behar, when Wari defeated the British King's House club at a tournament.\nIn the prestigious IFA Shield tournament, they had moderate success until 1945. One of their most noteworthy achievements came in 1917, when they defeated defending champions Lincoln Club in Calcutta.\nSince its establishment, the D.C. of Dhaka District became the clubs president without facing any competition. Wari Club gained popularity in 1978, as they defeated Abahani Krira Chakra in the First Division. The team is currently competing in the Bangladesh Championship League.\nCurrent squad\nOther departments\nThe club also has cricket, hockey, volleyball, and table tennis departments. The hockey team also started to do well as it became Dhaka Hockey League runners-up in 1953 and then champions in 1964.\nSuccess also followed the table tennis team, when Wari won the \"Akhtar Memorial Table Tennis Tournament\" in 1976 and 1977. Its volleyball team also achieved success as they became the dominant team in the 1970s and 80s, winning leagues on numerous occasions.\nTeam record\nHead coach record\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Head Coach\n!class=\"unsortable\"|From\n!class=\"unsortable\"|To\n!abbr=\"1\"|P\n!abbr=\"0\"|W\n!abbr=\"0\"|D\n!abbr=\"1\"|L\n!abbr=\"0\"|GS\n!abbr=\"1\"|GA\n!abbr=\"00\"|%W\n|-\n|align=left| Imtiaz Khan Labu\n|align=left|20 March 2020\n|align=left|5 December 2021\n|-\n|align=left| Abu Yusuf\n|align=left|3 June 2021\n|align=left|19 July 2021\n|-\n|align=left| Kamal Babu\n|align=left|20 December 2021\n|align=left|13 June 2022\n|-\n|align=left| Md Ekramur Rana\n|align=left|21 December 2022\n|align=left|19 April 2023\n|-\n|align=left| Md Rasidul Islam Shamim\n|align=left|19 February 2024\n|align=left|Present\n|-\n|align=left| Asharful Haque Apple\n|align=left|1 January 2025\n|align=left|Present\n|}\nPersonnel\nCurrent technical staff\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n!Position\n!Name\n|-\n| Head Coach\n|  Asharful Haque Apple\n|-\n|Team Manager\n| Obidur Rahman Ripon\n|-\n|Team Leader\n| J.A Naser\n|-\n|Technical Director\n| S.M Zakaria Babu\n|-\n|Media Officer\n| Kabir Uddin Sarker\n|-\n|Assistant Coach\n| Sarkar Hossain Chanchal\n|-\n|Physiotherapist\n| Mahbub Alam\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Masseur\n| Abdul Karim\n|-\n| Md Sabbif\n|-\n|Trainer\n| Abdullah Al Mamun\n|}\nHonours\n*Nar Narayan Shield\n**Winners (1): 1948\nSee also\n* List of football clubs in Bangladesh\n* History of football in Bangladesh\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*)|publisher=Bishhoshahitto Bhobon |isbn=978-984-93467-8-4}}\n*\n*\n*\n*)|publisher=Bishhoshahitto Bhobon|year=2020 |isbn=978-984-8218-31-0}}\n* ) |publisher=Bishhoshahitto Bhobon |year=2017 |language=bn |isbn=9789849134688}}\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://globalsportsarchive.com/team/soccer/wari-club/24750/ Wari Club Dhaka] at Global Sports Archive\n*\n*[https://elevensports.com/en/team/wari-club-cjryhanw9002e0huy0ts016so/matches Wari Club Dhaka] at Elevensports\n*[https://www.scorebing.com/team/34765 Wari Club Dhaka] at Scorebing"
