Her older half-sisters, Marie and Alix, were also older half-sisters of her future husband.\nShe was betrothed to Henry the Young King on 2 November 1160, who was actually the son of Eleanor of Aquitaine who was previously married to Margaret's father, Louis VII of France. Henry was the second son of King Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine. He was five years old at the time of this agreement while Margaret was about two. Margaret's dowry was the vital and much disputed territory of Vexin.\nQueen of England\nMargaret's husband became co-ruler with his father in 1170. Because Archbishop Thomas Becket was in exile, Margaret was not crowned along with her husband on 14 July 1170. This omission and the coronation being handled by a surrogate greatly angered her father. To please the French King, Henry II had his son and Margaret crowned together in Winchester Cathedral on 27 August 1172. When Margaret became pregnant, she held her confinement in Paris, where she gave birth prematurely to their only son William on 19 June 1177, who died three days later on 22 June. She had no further children, possibly due to infertility resulting from this birth.\nHer husband, Henry the Young King was generally well liked, but also highly impressionable and took part in a family rebellion against his father, King Henry II. Henry II's other sons and Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine took part in the rebellion, but it is unknown Margaret's part. She may have sided with her husband and mother-in-law, in regard to her husband's powerlessness and landless position. After the rebellion, both Queen Eleanor and Junior Queen Margaret were powerless.\nMargaret was accused in 1182 of having a love affair with William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, although contemporary chroniclers doubted the truth of these accusations. Henry the Young King may have started the process to have their marriage annulled ostensibly due to her adultery, or possibly due to the lack of children. The Young King's hesitation to act showed he was caught between believing and doubting the rumors, although due to her known piousness and lack of chroniclers hinting at a soiled reputation, it is likely that she was innocent of these charges of infidelity. Margaret was sent back to France, according to E. Hallam (The Plantagenets) and Amy Kelly (Eleonore of Aquitaine and the Four Kings), to ensure her safety during the civil war with Young Henry's brother Richard the Lionheart. Her husband died in 1183 while on campaign in the Dordogne region of France. The coronet he and she would have worn was chronicled in about 1218 as \"the traditional ring-of-roses coronet of the house of Anjou\". Margaret may have taken her coronet to Hungary in 1186 when she married King Bela III. A ring-of-roses coronet was discovered in a convent grave in Budapest in 1838, which may be the same one.\nQueen of Hungary\nAfter receiving a substantial pension in exchange for surrendering her dowry of Gisors and the Vexin, Margaret became the second wife of Béla III of Hungary in 1186. Béla III was searching for a wife and had heard of her piety and wisdom. As Queen of Hungary, she played a political role in 1189 by acting as a mediator to restore peace between Béla and his younger brother Géza, whom Béla had imprisoned as a contender for the throne. She helped intervene and settle the dispute between the brothers. Margaret's marriage to Béla III was also childless, but it did not cause any contention as Béla already had many children from his first marriage.\nShe was widowed for a second time in 1196. With no nearby male relative, and no heir, she went to the Holy Land and died on pilgrimage at St John of Acre in 1197, having only arrived eight days prior to her death.}} She was buried at the Cathedral of Tyre, according to Ernoul, the chronicler who continued the chronicles of William of Tyre.\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*Pellérdi, M., (2023).
