It influenced the 4X game genre.\nReception\nBrian J. Murphy of Creative Computing praised Andromeda Conquest for its playability and multi-player mode but criticized the solitaire game, describing it as \"dull\". Computer Gaming Worlds Floyd Mathews praised the game as \"relatively simple, but exciting\".
