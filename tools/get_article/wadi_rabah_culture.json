Kenyon has named this period in Jericho \"Pottery Neolithic B\". The name \"Wadi Rabah\" was since used in archaeologic literature thanks to the works of Israeli archaeologist Jacob Kaplan at the site of Wadi Rabah.\nSettlements\nThis culture is known from a small amount of sites, in some of which remains of small rectangular structures were discovered. Some larger structures were found in Munhata, Wadi Rabah and Ein el-Jarba, though Israeli archaeologist Yosef Garfinkel suggests that large courtyard structures were erected in that period, like the ones found at Sha'ar HaGolan of the preceding Yarmukian culture (c. 6400–6000 BCE) and Tel Tsaf of the following Early/Middle Chalcolithic period (c. 5300–4500 BCE).\nSites\n*Wadi Rabah\n* Baysamun\n* Dan\n* Kfar Giladi\n* HaGoshrim\n* Nahal Betzet\n* Tel Teo\n* Kabri\n* Horvat Uza\n* Kiryat Ata\n* Einot Tsipori\n* Tel Ali\n* Yizre'el\n* Tel Yosef\n* Abu Zurayq\n* Ein el-Jarba\n* Munhata\n* Nahal Zehora\n* Al-Shuna al-Shamalyah\n* En Esur\n* Abu Hamid\n* Habashan street\n* Lod\n* Tell es-Sultan\n* Kidron Valley\n* Atlit Yam\n* Teluliot Batashi\nSee also\n* Yarmukian culture\n* Lodian culture\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*"
