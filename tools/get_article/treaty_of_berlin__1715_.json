It formalized an alliance between George I of Great Britain (in his role as Elector of Hanover) and Denmark-Norway, in return for the cession of the Swedish dominion of Bremen-Verden to Hanover, which had been occupied by Denmark. With this treaty, Denmark and Hanover joined the Russo-Prussian coalition that had been established by the Treaty of Schwedt. Denmark was assured the gain of yet-to-be-conquered Stralsund.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110722015250/http://www.ieg-mainz.de/likecms/index.php?site=site.htm&dir=&nav=&siteid=133&treaty=120&lastsiteid=77&searchquery=&is_fts=1&filter_select=&filter_wt=&filter_id=&filter_l=&filter_p=&searchlang=de&searchstring=1710&date=&year_from=&year_till=&location= Scan of the treaty at IEG Mainz]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110722015358/http://www.ieg-mainz.de/likecms/index.php?site=comment.htm&dir=&treaty=120&comment=327&notrans=1 Annotated edition of the treaty at IEG Mainz]"
