He became an officer in 1689 who rose to become a general, and married a woman of high rank.\nAmerican colonies\nHe was a man of business whose first address to the New Jersey Assembly was barely 300 words long. In it, he stated, \"If honesty is the best policy, plainness must be the best oratory.\"\nHe was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Virginia in 1707, but was captured by a corsair on his way to Virginia, taken to France, and in 1709 exchanged for the French Bishop of Quebec. He was then appointed Governor of New York and sailed to America with 3,000 Palatine refugees as settlers in 1710. In 1715 he advocated the local minting of copper coins, but the king refused. Governor Hunter's philosophy was that \"the true Interests of the People and Government are the same, I mean A Government of Laws. No other deserves the Name, and are never Separated or Separable but in Imagination by Men of Craft.\"\nHunter was succeeded as Governor by Pieter Schuyler as acting governor from 1719 to 1720 and finally by William Burnet, whose post as Comptroller of Customs was given to Hunter in exchange.\nJamaica\nHunter was then Governor of Jamaica from 1727 until his death on 31 March 1734. While in Jamaica, Hunter waged an unsuccessful war against the Jamaican Maroons. He was a member of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May 1709.\nPersonal life\nHunter was married to Elizabeth ( Orby) Hay, the daughter of Sir Thomas Orby, 1st Baronet of Croyland. Elizabeth was the widow of Brig.-Gen. Lord John Hay, son of John Hay, 2nd Marquess of Tweeddale. Together, they were the parents of at least one son and three daughters (Henrietta Hunter, Catherine ( Hunter) Sloper, Charlotte Hunter), including:\n* Thomas Orby Hunter (–1769), MP for Winchelsea who married Jacomina Caroline Bullenden, the daughter of Colonel William Bullenden.\nHunter died on 31 March 1734 in Jamaica, West Indies.\nPlaywriting\nHis play, Androboros, written in 1714, was the first known play to be written and published in the North American British Colonies.\nSee also\n*List of colonial governors of New Jersey\n*List of colonial governors of New York\n*Androboros\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131112110947/http://slic.njstatelib.org/slic_files/imported/NJ_Information/Digital_Collections/Governors_of_New_Jersey/GHUNT.pdf Biography of Robert Hunter], New Jersey State Library\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121221180110/http://beatl.barnard.columbia.edu/kingsv1/NYGovs.htm Colonial Governors of New York]\n* [https://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/hunter.html Robert Hunter Papers, 1699-1744] New-York Historical Society"
