It was Biegański's most popular film, and displayed the influence of Soviet cinema on his work. The film is considered lost, so it is difficult to describe the plot in detail, but from what can be gathered the film appears to have been a murder mystery whodunit featuring a pair of Russian aristocrats who are determined to marry a wealthy father/daughter and murder them for their inheritance. Despite the title the film did not actually feature any vampires of the supernatural variety.\nActor Igo Sym, who later shared billing in films with top name stars like Marlene Dietrich, became a Nazi informant in WWII and turned in a number of fellow Polish actors and theater owners who were aligned with the Resistance forces in Poland. In 1941, some Polish freedom fighters assassinated Sym, and the Nazis retaliated by executing 21 hostages and sending dozens of others to Auschwitz.\nCast\n* Oktawian Kaczanowski as Pradowski\n* Halina Łabędzka as Urszula Pradowska\n* Maria Balcerkiewiczówna as Countess Tamarska\n* Igo Sym as Tadeusz Wyzewicz, lawyer\n* Lech Owron as Baron Kamiłow\n* Marian Kiernicki as Antoni, lokaj\n* Wiera Pogorzanka as Tonia\n* Katarzyna Dworkowska as Przelozona klasztoru\n* Piotr Hryniewicz as Prosecutor\n* K.
