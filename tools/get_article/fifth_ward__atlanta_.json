The Fifth Ward was laid out west of Ivy and north of A&W Railroad. This ward contained the large homes along Peachtree Street and the southern part, Fairlie-Poplar was also largely residential with warehousing along the western part.\n1871\nFifth Ward in purple (1871 to 1874)\nDuring a huge boom of post-war building, two new wards were added from parts of the First, Fourth and Fifth to reflect the changing look of the city. This would be the layout until the city limits were expanded in 1874.\nParts of the Fourth and Fifth Wards were taken to form a Seventh Ward (grey)  established on December 2, 1871. Specifically from the \"junction of Houston and Pryor streets, thence through lot nineteen, between blocks three, one and two, five and six, to the city limits; thence northerly along the city limits to Peachtree Street; thence south along Peachtree Street and Pryor Street to the beginning.\" And the Fourth was extended \"from Ivy Street west to Pryor, and from Houston Street south to the railroad, and that Pryor Street shall be the line between the fourth and fifth wards, and Pryor and Peachtree streets between the fifth and seventh wards.\" This gave the red-light district to the Fourth and created a new Ward of mostly farmers and to the west, fine residences along Ivy and the east side of Peachtree.\n1874\nFifth Ward in purple (1874 to 1883)\nA new city charter increased the radius of the city from one to one and a half miles, reduced the number of wards back to five and created a bicameral council of two councilmen from each ward and a second body of three at-large aldermen was established.\nThe new Fifth ward layout was from Pryor and tracks north-east to Peachtree, then West Peachtree to city limits, south-west to Foundry and W&A RR and east to origin. Two councilmen would be elected from each ward each year.\nIn late 1875, an ordinance passed where each year one councilman would be elected from each ward for a two-year term. The first year, 1876 just had one citywide alderman and a single councilman from each ward, and they would be fully staffed two years later.\n1883\nFifth Ward in purple (1883 to 1894)\nOn November 5, 1883 a Sixth Ward (beige) was carved out of the Fourth and Fifth Wards. In later years wards were added or modified to handle newly annexed parts of the city but the Fifth remained essentially unchanged. The city converted to a district system in 1954.\nSee also\n*Atlanta ward system\nReferences\n*"
