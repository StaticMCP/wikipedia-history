Incumbent President Aleksander Kwaśniewski was easily re-elected in the first round with more than 50% of the vote, the only time a direct presidential election in Poland has not gone to a second round. Kwaśniewski would be the last president to be re-elected until Andrzej Duda in 2020.\nElectoral system\nThe President of Poland is elected for a five-year term using the two-round system; if no candidate receives a majority of the vote in the first round, a run-off is held between the top two candidates. Presidents serve a five-year term and can be re-elected once. The president-elect takes the oath of office on the day the previous President's term expires before the National Assembly (a joint session of the Sejm and the Senate).\nIn order to be registered to contest the election, a candidate must be a Polish citizen, be at least 35 years old on the day of the first round of the election, and have collected at least 100,000 voters' signatures. In 2000, 13 candidates registered, but one - former Prime Minister Jan Olszewski - withdrew before the first round, so 12 valid candidates appeared on the ballot.\nBackground\nAleksander Kwaśniewski was elected in the 1995 presidential election and governed the country alongside the Democratic Left Alliance-Polish People's Party coalition until the 1997 parliamentary election, when the opposition, united under the Solidarity Electoral Action and led by the trade union's leader, Marian Krzaklewski, came to power, in a coalition with the Freedom Union. The coalition put up Jerzy Buzek as the next Prime Minister, as Krzaklewski had been seeking to challenge Kwaśniewski for the Presidency instead.\nCampaign\nPresident Kwaśniewski was seen as very likely to win re-election in the run up to the presidential election with polls showing that his popularity was high as 70% support. His main challenger was expected to be Marian Krzaklewski from the Solidarity Electoral Action, which had formed the government since winning the last parliamentary elections in 1997. The other main candidate was a former Foreign Minister and more liberal conservative Andrzej Olechowski, who won support from voters who were discontented with both of the other main candidates and in particular younger voters, businessmen and intellectuals.\nCandidates seen as having less of a chance included Andrzej Lepper, a populist farmers leader who opposed entry into the European Union and former president Lech Wałęsa. Wałęsa was rejected as the candidate for the Solidarity party he had won the presidency for, and thus ran separately in the election.\nIn order to be elected in the first round a candidate had to gain over 50% of the vote. If no candidate reached this level, then a second round would have been held between the top two candidates. As the campaign continued, the biggest question in the election was whether or not incumbent President Kwaśniewski would win the 50% required to avoid a second round.\nIn the August before the election Kwaśniewski and another former president and candidate Lech Wałęsa were investigated by a court on allegations that they had been informers for the Communist secret police. If they had been found guilty they could have been banned from seeking election to political office for 10 years. However they both claimed that the evidence had been manipulated by political opponents and were cleared by the court.\nSolidarity candidate Krzaklewski attacked Kwaśniewski for his past as a Communist party activist. However opinion polls in August showed this had little effect with Kwaśniewski well ahead with over 60% support, while Krzaklewski was second and Olechowski third, but both a long way behind. President Kwaśniewski's campaign focused on reconciling all of Poland with slogans including \"Poland, our common home\". Most voters felt he had done well as President and he was seen as having done a good job in guiding Poland to membership of NATO. Krzaklewski's popularity was not high due to the infighting in the government led by his Solidarity party since they had won the 1997 parliamentary election. Meanwhile, Lech Wałęsa trailed badly in the polls with only about 2% support, which Wałęsa saw as being due to voters seeing him as being responsible for the pain involved in the transition from communism.\nIn the election 3 candidates ran on platforms against the European Union. During the campaign one of them, Andrzej Lepper, was arrested for illegally blocking a customs post, however he claimed that this was an attempt to sabotage his campaign.\nAs the election neared Kwaśniewski dropped in the polls and it became uncertain whether he would win the 50% required to avoid a second round. This followed a television advertisement from Solidarity candidate Krzaklewski in which Kwaśniewski was accused of having mocked Pope John Paul II. The video showed Kwaśniewski apparently urging his security advisor to kiss the ground is a parody of the Pope, although Kwaśniewski claimed this was inaccurate. At least one poll showed Kwaśniewski's support having dropped by 10% in one week following this, however it was the other main candidate, Andrzej Olechowski, who benefited as Krzaklewski was seen as being tarnished for having run a negative campaign.\nCampaign spending\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n! colspan=2 rowspan=2 | Candidate\n! colspan=2 |\n! colspan=2 |\n|-\n!Spent\n!\n!Spent\n!\n|-\n| style=\"background: #E2001A\" |\n|align=left|Kwaśniewski\n| 11,572,000\n| 1,22\n| 5,176,889\n| 0,55\n|-\n| style=\"background: #516A95\" |\n|align=left|Olechowski\n| 1,965,000\n| 0,65\n| 879,069\n| 0,29\n|-\n| style=\"background: #C1C1C1\" |\n|align=left|Krzaklewski\n| 10,717,000\n| 3,91\n| 4,794,393\n| 1,75\n|-\n| style=\"background: #1BB100\" |\n|align=left|Kalinowski\n| 2,113,000\n| 2,02\n| 945,278\n| 0,90\n|-\n| style=\"background: #FCD600\" |\n|align=left|Lepper\n| 56,000\n| 0,10\n| 25,052\n| 0,04\n|-\n| style=\"background: #151A3A\" |\n|align=left|Korwin-Mikke\n| 75,000\n| 0,30\n| 33,552\n| 0,13\n|-\n| style=\"background: #800000\" |\n|align=left|Wałęsa\n| 299,000\n| 1,67\n| 133,761\n| 0,75\n|-\n| style=\"background: #4169E1\" |\n|align=left|Łopuszański\n| 292,000\n| 2,10\n| 130,630\n| 0,94\n|-\n| style=\"background: #EFC816\" |\n|align=left|Grabowski\n| 74,000\n| 0,83\n| 33,104\n| 0,37\n|-\n| style=\"background: #D62D32\" |\n|align=left|Ikonowicz\n| 29,000\n| 0,75\n| 12,973\n| 0,34\n|-\n| style=\"background: #180A9B\" |\n|align=left|Wilecki\n| 53,000\n| 1,82\n| 23,710\n| 0,81\n|-\n| style=\"background: #DCDCDC\" |\n|align=left|Pawłowski\n| 15,000\n| 0,87\n| 6710\n| 0,39\n|- class=sortbottom\n| colspan=6 align=left | Source: Dudek\n|}\nCandidates\nThere was no second round since Aleksander Kwaśniewski got over 50% in the first round.\nFirst Round\nFile:20080930 Dariusz Maciej Grabowski (cropped).jpg|Member of the Sejm Dariusz Grabowski (Coalition for Poland), 50\nFile:Piotr Ikonowicz - 2007.jpg|Member of the Sejm Piotr Ikonowicz (Polish Socialist Party), 44\nFile:Jan Łopuszański (cropped).jpg|Member of the Sejm Jan Łopuszański (Polish Agreement), 45\nFile:Kalinowski, Jaroslaw-2504.jpg|Former Deputy Prime Minister Jarosław Kalinowski (Polish People's Party), 38\nFile:Korwin.png|Former Member of the Sejm Janusz Korwin-Mikke (Real Politics Union), 57\nFile:Marian Krzaklewski 2007.jpg|Chairman of NSZZ Solidarity Marian Krzaklewski (Solidarity Electoral Action), 50\nFile:Aleksander_Kwaśniewski_2003.jpg|Incumbent President Aleksander Kwaśniewski (Independent), 45\nFile:Andrzej Lepper in his office 2002 (2) (cropped).jpg|Agriculturer Andrzej Lepper (Self-Defense), 46\nFile:Andrzej Olechowski candidate 2010.jpg|Former Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrzej Olechowski (Independent), 53\nFile:Lech Walesa.jpg|Former President Lech Wałęsa (Christian Democracy), 57\n* Businessman Bogdan Pawłowski (Independent), 55\n* Generał broni Tadeusz Wilecki (National Party), 55\nWithdrawn\nFile:Jan Olszewski by Foksal.jpg|Former Prime Minister Jan Olszewski (ROP), 70\nOpinion polls\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; line-height:14px;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Pollster\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Date of polling\n! style=\"width:60px;\" | Kwaśniewski\n! style=\"width:60px;\" | Olechowski\n! style=\"width:60px;\" | Krzaklewski\n! style=\"width:60px;\" | Kalinowski\n! style=\"width:60px;\" | Lepper\n! style=\"width:60px;\" | Korwin\n! style=\"width:60px;\" | Wałęsa\n! style=\"width:60px;\" |\n! style=\"width:60px;\" | Grabowski}}\n! style=\"width:60px;\" | Ikonowicz\n! style=\"width:60px;\" |\n! style=\"width:60px;\" |\n! style=\"width:60px;\" | Olszewski\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Others andUndecideds\n|-\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n| style=\"background:#516A95;\" |\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n| style=\"background:#800000;\" |\n| style=\"background:#4169E1;\" |\n| style=\"background:#EFC816;\" |\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n| style=\"background:#180A9B;\" |\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n| style=\"background:#BD0934;\" |\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" |Election results\n| 8 October 2000\n| style=\"background:#FF324C; color:white;\" | 53.90\n| style=\"background:#839CC7; color:white;\" | 17.30\n| 15.57\n| 5.95\n| 3.05\n| 1.43\n| 1.01\n| 0.79\n| 0.51\n| 0.22\n| 0.16\n| 0.10\n| -\n| -\n|-\n| colspan=\"16\" style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"|\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" |CBOS\n| Sept.-Oct. 2000\n| style=\"background:#FF324C; color:white;\" | 55\n| style=\"background:#839CC7; color:white;\" | 13\n| 7\n| 6\n| 3\n| 1\n| 1\n| 1\n|  Independent Andrzej Olechowski came second beating Solidarity candidate Krzaklewski into third place.
