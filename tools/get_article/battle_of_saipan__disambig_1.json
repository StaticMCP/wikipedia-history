The initial invasion triggered the Battle of the Philippine Sea, which effectively destroyed Japanese carrier-based airpower, and the battle resulted in the American capture of the island. Its occupation put the major cities of the Japanese home islands within the range of B-29 bombers, making them vulnerable to strategic bombing by the United States Army Air Forces. It also precipitated the resignation of Hideki Tōjō, the prime minister of Japan.\nSaipan was the first objective in Operation Forager, the campaign to occupy the Mariana Islands that got underway at the same time the Allies were invading France in Operation Overlord. After a two-day naval bombardment, the U.S. 2nd Marine Division, 4th Marine Division, and the Army's 27th Infantry Division, commanded by Lieutenant General Holland Smith, landed on the island and defeated the 43rd Infantry Division of the Imperial Japanese Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Yoshitsugu Saitō. Organized resistance ended when at least 3,000 Japanese soldiers died in a mass gyokusai attack, and afterward about 1,000 civilians committed suicide.\nThe capture of Saipan pierced the Japanese inner defense perimeter, and forced the Japanese government to inform its citizens for the first time that the war was not going well. The battle claimed more than 46,000 military casualties and at least 8,000 civilian deaths. The high percentage of casualties suffered during the battle influenced American planning for future assaults, including the projected invasion of Japan.\nBackground\nAmerican strategic objectives\nbe within the  range of the B-29 bomber|alt=map of the western Pacific. An orange line marking the Japanese defenses runs from the Kuriles to New Guinea and Java. There is an arc showing the range of B-29 bombers that overlaps with Japan and the Philippines]]\nUp to early 1944, Allied operations against the Japanese military in the Pacific were focused on securing the lines of communication between Australia and the United States. These operations had recaptured the Solomon Islands, eastern New Guinea, western New Britain, the Admiralty Islands, and the Gilbert and Marshall Islands.\nTo defeat Japan, Admiral Ernest J. King, Commander in Chief, United States Fleet, sought to execute War Plan Orange, 229]–[ 230]|Toll|2015|4p=[https://archive.org/details/conqueringtidewa0000toll/page/306 306]}} which the Naval War College had been developing for four decades in the event of a war. The plan envisioned an offensive through the Central Pacific that originated from Hawaii, island-hopped through Micronesia and the Philippines, forced a decisive battle with the Japanese Navy, and brought about an economic collapse of Japan.\nAs early as the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, King presented the case to the Combined Chiefs of Staff for an amphibious offensive in the Central Pacific – including the Marshall Islands and Truk – that would capture the Mariana Islands. He stated that the occupation of the Marianas – specifically Saipan, Tinian and Guam – would cut the sea and air route from the Japanese home islands to the western Pacific, for King's argument.}} but the Combined Chiefs of Staff made no commitment at the time. General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific Area, objected to King's proposed Central Pacific offensive. He argued that it would be costly and time-consuming and would pull resources away from his drive in the Southwest Pacific toward the Philippines. 232]}}\nAt the Quebec Conference in August 1943, King continued to advocate for including the Marianas in a Central Pacific offensive. He suggested that the strategic importance of the Marianas could draw the main Japanese fleet out for a major naval battle. 23]–[ 24]|2a1=Heinrichs|2a2=Gallicchio|2y=2017|2p=[https://archive.org/details/implacablefoeswa0000hein/page/92 92]|3a1=Symonds|3y=2022|3p=[ 275]|3ps=: See King's reply to Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Winston Churchill in .}} King's advocacy gained support from General Henry H. Arnold, Chief of the Army Air Forces, who wanted to use the newly developed B-29 bomber. The Marianas could provide secure airfields to sustain a strategic bombing offensive as the islands put much of Japan's population centers and industrial areas within the B-29's  mile combat radius. At the Cairo Conference in November 1943, the Combined Chiefs of Staff supported both MacArthur's offensive in the Southwest Pacific and King's in the Central Pacific, adding the Marianas as an objective for the Central Pacific offensive and setting 1 October 1944 as the date for their invasion.\nAdmiral Chester Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas led the Central Pacific offensive.  In January–February 1944, the Marshall Islands were quickly captured and a massive American carrier-based air attack on Truk demonstrated that it could be neutralized and bypassed. On 12 March 1944, the Joint Chiefs of Staff moved the date of the invasion up to 15 June with the goal of creating airfields for B-29s and developing secondary naval bases. Nimitz updated the plans for the Central Pacific offense, codenamed Granite II, and set the invasion of the Marianas, codenamed Forager, as its initial objective. Saipan would be the first assault.\nJapanese strategic plan\nThe Japanese Imperial War Council established the \"\", Zettai Kokubōken) in September 1943, which was bounded by southern half of Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, the Bonin Islands, the Marianas, Western New Guinea, Malaya, and Burma.

The defense forces in the attacked area would attempt to hold their positions while the Japanese Combined Fleet struck the Americans, sinking their carriers with land-based aircraft and finishing the fleet off with surface ships. As part of this plan the Japanese could deploy over 500 land-based planes – 147 of them immediately in the Marianas – that made up the 1st Air Fleet under the command of Vice Admiral Kakuji Kakuta whose headquarters was on Tinian.\nHistory and geography\nlooking southwest, 2017: Aslito Field is on the left, Charan Kanoa and invasion beaches are left of center, and Garapan is on the right|upright=1.2|alt=panorama of Saipan.

After Spain's defeat in the Spanish-American War, Saipan was sold to Germany in 1899. The island was occupied by the Japanese in 1914 during World War I, who made it the administrative center for the Mariana Islands – Saipan, Tinian and Rota – that were part of Japan's South Seas Mandate. 7]}}\nSaipan has a tropical marine climate with a mean annual temperature of  in the lowlands and  in the highlands.

Seventy percent of Saipan's acreage was dedicated to sugar cane. 7]}} It was so plentiful that a narrow-gauge railway was built around the perimeter of the island to facilitate its transportation. These cane fields were an obstacle to attackers: they were difficult to maneuver in and provided concealment for the defenders. 129]}}\nSaipan was the first island during the Pacific War where the United States forces encountered a substantial Japanese civilian population, and the first where U. S. Marines fought around urban areas. vii]}} Approximately 26,000 to 28,000 civilians lived on the island, primarily serving the sugar industry. 7]}} The majority of them were Japanese subjects, most of whom were from Okinawa and Korea; a minority were Chamorro people. The largest towns on the island were the administrative center of Garapan, which had a population of 10,000, Charan Kanoa, and Tanapag. They were on the western coast of the island, which was where the best landing beaches for an invasion were. 129]}}\nOpposing forces\nAmerican invasion force\ns heading for shore on 15 June.  in foreground; the cruiser firing in the distance is |alt=Two cruisers, one in front left foreground,a second in the upper distance is firing.

The M4 Sherman tank was superior to the medium tank used by the Japanese, the Type 97. 6]}} It was primarily used to support infantry and was considered one of the most effective weapons for destroying enemy emplacements. Flame throwers were extensively used. Smith had seen the need for motorized flamethrowers and had requested that the Army's Chemical Warfare Service (CWS) in Hawaii install them in M3 Stuart tanks. Seabees with the CWS had 24 tanks, nicknamed \"Satans\", converted to flamethrowing in time for the invasion. They were very effective for destroying pillboxes, cave defenses, buildings, canefields, and brush.\nJapanese defense preparations\ncoastal defense gun found on Saipan after the battle|alt=cannon in profile facing left with ocean in the background.]]\nAmerican intelligence had estimated that there would be between 15,000 and 18,000 Japanese troops on Saipan at the time of the invasion. 55]|Hoffman|1950|2p=[https://archive.org/details/saipanthebeginni00wash/page/26 26]}} In actuality, there were double that number. Nearly 32,000 Japanese military personnel were on the island, including 6,000 naval troops. The two major army units defending the island were the 43rd Division commanded by Lieutenant General Yoshitsugu Saitō and the 47th Independent Mixed Brigade commanded by Colonel Yoshira Oka. 55]}} Both units were assigned to the Thirty-First Army under the overall command of Lieutenant General Hideyoshi Obata.\nThe Japanese hurriedly reinforced the island before the invasion, but many of the troop transports were sunk by U.S. submarines. 31–32]}} For example, five of the seven ships transporting the 43rd Division were sunk. Most of the troops were saved, but the majority of their equipment–including hats and shoes–was lost, reducing their effectiveness. 31]}} Many soldiers were the stranded survivors of sunken ships headed to other islands. 29]}} There were about 80 tanks on the island, substantially more than the Americans had encountered in previous battles with the Japanese. 56]}}\nThe Japanese defenses were set up to defeat an invading force on Saipan's  beaches, where the invading troops were most vulnerable. These defenses focused on the most likely invasion locations, the western beaches south of Garapan. 339]–[ 340]}} This made the defenses weak.

Although Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo, Commander of the Central Pacific Area Fleet, had nominal oversight of the defenses in the Central Pacific, Obata refused to subordinate his army command to a naval officer. 338]}} Because Obata was on Guam and away from his Saipan headquarters when the invasion started, command of Saipan's army units fell to Saitō, who was the senior army officer on the island. 338]|Morison|1981|2p=[https://archive.org/details/newguineamariana0008samu/page/167 167]}} Obata's chief of staff, Major General Keiji Igeta, maintained a separate headquarters that was often out of touch with Saitō. 339]}}\nBattle\n11–14 June: Preparatory attacks\nof the destruction of the sugar mill at Charan Kanoa on 15 June (Navy Art Collection, Naval History and Heritage Command) |alt=Building on left with orange flames and a plume stretching to the right top corner.

The 2nd Marine Division which was on the western coast moved toward Garapan and Mount Tapatchou; the 4th Marine Division advanced along the eastern coast, which created gaps in the lines in the hilly ground between the two divisions. That evening, the 27th Infantry Division, less the regiment left to reduce Nafutan point, was ordered to move up into the difficult terrain between the two Marine divisions.\nThe next day, the Marine divisions on the flanks made progress, but the 27th Infantry Division, which started its attack late, stalled in its assault on a valley surrounding a low lying ridge that was defended by about 4,000 Japanese soldiers. 362]}} The battle around these features, which American soldiers nicknamed the \"Death Valley\" and \"Purple Heart Ridge\", began to bend the line of the American advance into a horseshoe, 362]}} creating gaps in the Marine divisions' flanks and forcing them to halt.\nFrustrated by what he saw as lack of progress by the 27th Division, Holland Smith relieved its commander, Major General Ralph Smith, and temporarily replaced him with another Army officer, Major General Sanderford Jarman. 356]|2a1=Shaw|2a2=Nalty|2a3=Turnbladh|2y=1989|2p=[https://archive.org/details/historyofusmarin03usma/page/317 317]|3a1=Smith|3a2=Finch|3y=1949|3pp=[https://archive.org/details/coralbrass0000holl/page/172 172–173]}} The debate over the appropriateness of Holland's Smith action–a Marine general dismissing an Army general–immediately created an inter-service controversy.

A cloud of dust is behind them.]]\nThe United States forces had built up substantial firepower to continue their northward drive. On 22 June, P-47s from the Seventh Air Force landed on Aslito Field and immediately began launching ground assault missions. On the same day, the XXIV Corps Artillery commanded by Brigadier General Arthur M. Harper moved 24 155 mm field guns and 24 155 mm howitzers into place to fire on Japanese positions.\nThe Americans also used truck-launched rockets for saturation barrages. Spotters flying in L-4 Grasshoppers helped direct ground artillery, and Navajo code talkers relayed information about Japanese troop movements.  In the hills, soldiers relied on personal flamethrowers, particularly in locations where the motorized flamethrowers could not reach. They gradually developed tactics for effectively reducing caves, using a combination of flamethrowers and demolition charges to clear them, or sometimes using demolitions to seal them off.\nBy 24 June, the American warships that had returned from the Battle of Philippine Sea were once more available to provide fire support.\nShip fire was particularly feared by the Japanese because it could strike from almost any direction. Saitō singled out naval gunfire undermining the Japanese' ability to fight successfully against the Americans. 332]|Morison|1981|2p=[https://archive.org/details/newguineamariana0008samu/page/326 326]}}\nThe ships were also well-supplied with star shells, providing illumination that disrupted Japanese night movements and counterattacks. This naval support was facilitated by joint assault signal companies that directed both naval and aerial firepower to where it was needed by the ground forces.\nAmerican advance and Japanese break out at Nafutan Point\nOn 25 June, the 27th Infantry Division was not able to make much headway in their fight for Death Valley, but the 2nd Marine Division to the west gained control of Mount Tapotchau, the key artillery observation posts in central Saipan. On the east coast, the 4th Marine Division quickly occupied most of the Kagman peninsula, meeting little organized resistance because the Japanese had evacuated the peninsula. Between 26 June and 30 June, the 2nd Marine Division and the 27th Infantry Division made little progress. The second Marines remained south of Garapan, slowly fighting their way north of Mount Tapotchau. The 4th Marine Division was able to advance up the eastern coast to a line just north of the village of Hashigoru.\nAbout 500 Japanese soldiers broke out of Nafutan Point on the night of 26 June. They headed toward Aslito Field, destroying one P-47 and damaging two others.\nThey then ran into a unit of Marines who were in reserve and a unit of Marine artillery. Almost all the Japanese soldiers were killed in the ensuing firefight. The next day, the elements of the 27th Infantry Division that had been fighting at the point moved in to occupy the area, no survivors were found.\nIgeta's 31st Army Headquarters sent a telegram from the island on 27 June,  stating the Japanese would not be able to hold due to the American preponderance in artillery, sea and air power, as well of a lack of equipment and supplies, including food and water. Water shortages were particularly acute in the limestone caves the Japanese soldiers used for defense. Igeta reported that some soldiers hadn't had water for three days and were surviving on snails and tree leaves. Japanese communications were so disrupted that at one point during the week, Igeta could only account for 950 of the Japanese soldiers.\nOn 28 June, Army Major General George Griner, who had been sent for from Hawaii, took over command of the 27th Infantry Division. Jarman, whose command had been temporary, returned to his assigned role as garrison commander of the island. On 30 June, the 27th Infantry Division captured Death Valley and Purple Heart Ridge, and advanced far enough to reestablish contact with the two Marine divisions on their flanks. Saitō's main line of defense in Central Saipan had been breached; and the Japanese began their retreat north to their final defensive line. To date, American casualties were about 11,000.\n1–6 July: Pursuit into northern Saipan\non 3 July|alt=two American soldiers running from left to right through a burning village]]\nSaitō intended to form a new line in northern Saipan that would be anchored on Tanapag on the west, running southeast to a village called Tarahoho, and through to the east coast. He wasn't able to. His army's cohesion was disintegrating: Some of the remaining forces retreated north, others holed up in whatever caves they could find, others put up disorganized resistance where they were. During 2–4 July, the 2nd Marine Division took the ruins of Garapan and its harbor. The 4th Marine Division quickly moved north on the west coast in the face of light resistance. As Saitō's attempt to form the defense line collapsed, he eventually moved his final headquarters near Makunsha village on the west coast north of Tanapag.\nOn 4 July, the 27th Infantry Division and 4th Marine Division headed northwest. The 27th division reached the west coast at Flores Point, south of Tanapag, cutting off any Japanese retreating from Garapan.\nThe 2nd Marine Division no longer faced organized resistance, and went into reserve. The 27th Infantry Division was to move up the east coast toward Tanapag, and the 4th Marine Division would advance northwest. On 5 July, the 27th Infantry Division encountered strong resistance in a narrow canyon on the east coast north of Tanapag that they dubbed \"Harikari Gulch\", which expanded into a two-day battle. for an in-depth description of the fighting.}}\nassault|upright=1.2]]\nThe 4th Marine Division continued to make rapid progress north during 4–5 July,\nand on 6 July, Holland Smith ordered them to head toward the eastern coast near Makunsha to cut off the Japanese forces fighting the 27th Infantry Division, then the Marines would complete the occupation of the rest of northern Saipan on their own.\nIn the evening, the Marines had taken Mount Petosukara, one of the last mountains before reaching the northern tip of the island, but the units that turned toward Makunsha encountered too much resistance to reach the eastern coast.\nSaitō realized he could not create a final defensive line. His headquarters, which had been under constant artillery attack for days, was now in range of American machine guns. What was left of his command was trapped in a northern corner of the island, almost out of food and water, and slowly being destroyed by overwhelming American firepower. 375–376]}} On 6 July, Saitō decided the situation was hopeless and sent out orders for the remainder of his forces to perform gyokusai, a final suicide attack to destroy as many of the enemy as possible. He set the attack for the following day to give the troops a chance to concentrate what was left of his forces and put his divisional chief of staff, Colonel Takuji Suzuki, in charge. That night, Saitō ate a last meal and committed seppuku; Nagumo killed himself at around the same time. 514, fn44]}} a captured public relations officer. who initially claimed to be Major Kiyoshi Yoshida, an intelligence officer who actually died in combat. 438]}} (cf., who describes the testimony of \"Kiyoshi Yoshida\").  514, fn44]}} points out that in early accounts, Saitō commits suicide alone (e.g.,see the early account in ), and a different Japanese survivor states that Nagumo committed suicide elsewhere. 514, fn44]|Morison|1981|2p=[https://archive.org/details/newguineamariana0008samu/page/337 337]}} , bases his account, in which Saitō, Nagumo, and Igeta die together on a much later interview with Hirakushi. 514, fn44]}}}} Takagi stated he would die attacking the enemy. 147]}}\n7–9 July: Gyokusai attack and battle's end\nadvancing north on Tanapag plain on 8 July after the gyokusai attack|alt=tank in mid-left heading down road from left to right.

After the fighting, General Griner of the 27th infantry Division counted 4,311 Japanese bodies in the area of the attack, but it was disputed whether all of them had died in the attack. A later commission ordered by Spruance put the number between 1,500–3,000, arguing that many of the bodies were from people who died before the attack. Smith eventually agreed with Spruance's report.}} They assembled near Makunsha. The force included naval personnel, support troops, civilians, and the walking wounded. It included three tanks, supporting mortars, and machine guns, but some troops were only armed with sticks with bayonets, knives, or grenades tied to poles. It would be the largest gyokusai attack of the Pacific War.\nAt around 04:00, Suzuki's force advanced south along the western coastal area, called the Tanapag plain, toward where his reconnaissance patrols had found a weak spot in the American line near Tanapag village: two battalions of the 105 Infantry Regiment of the 27th Infantry Division were isolated from the other American forces. The main force struck the two battalions at about 04:45, overrunning both. The two battalions suffered about 900 casualties, which was 80% of their effective force. 387]}} The charge continued toward Tanapag village, overrunning two batteries of Marine artillery, but was halted in the late morning by a hastily formed American line around the village. 104]}} The fighting continued throughout the day, as American soldiers struggled against scattered elements of the gyokusai attack and recaptured lost ground. 387]|2a1=Shaw|2a2=Nalty|2a3=Turnbladh|2y=1989|2p=[https://archive.org/details/historyofusmarin03usma/page/342 342]}}\nOn 8 July, most of the 27th Infantry Division, which had suffered high losses in the gyokusai attack, was placed into reserve. The 2nd Marine Division advanced up the Tanapag plain, looking for Japanese stragglers. The 4th Marine Division reached the western coast north of Makunsha and headed toward Marpi Point, near the island's northern-most tip. As they advanced, they saw hundreds of Japanese civilians die on inland and coastal cliffs. Some threw themselves off, others were thrown or pushed off. By the evening of 9 July, the 4th Marine Division had reached the northern end of the Island and Turner declared the island secure. 427]}} On the second day of the battle, he had estimated that Saipan would be captured in a week; it had taken 24 days. On 11 July, the Americans found General Saitō's body. He was buried on 13 July with full military honors in a coffin draped with the Japanese flag. 439]}}\nThough the island was declared secured, the fighting and suicides would continue. Clearing the hundreds of scattered Japanese soldiers hiding in caves would take many months, though responsibilities were handed over to the Army Garrison Force. One group of about 50 Japanese men—soldiers and civilians—was led by Captain Sakae Ōba, who survived the last gyokusai charge. 458]}} His group evaded capture and conducted guerrilla-style attacks, raiding American camps for supplies. Ōba's resistance earned him the nickname \"the Fox\". 458]}} His men held out for approximately 16 months before surrendering on 1 December 1945, three months after the official surrender of Japan. 463]}}\nCasualties\ntalks a woman with children and a dog into leaving a hillside cave on 21 June|alt=Women with children and dog sitting in cave on left facing a marine squatting on the right who is looking at her.]]\nAlmost the entire Japanese garrison—approximately 30,000 military personnel—were killed in the battle. Eventually 1,700, about half of whom were Korean workers, were taken prisoner. American forces suffered about 16,500 casualties—3,100 killed and 13,000 wounded—out of 71,000 who were part of the assault force. The casualty rate was over 20%, which was comparable to Tarawa. It was the Americans' most deadly battle in the Pacific up to that time.\nApproximately 40% of the civilians on Saipan were killed. An estimated 8,000 to 10,000 died during or shortly after the fighting, and the 14,000 survivors were interned. Many civilians died from the bombing, shelling and cross-fire. Others died because they hid in caves and shelters indistinguishable from Japanese combat positions, which the Marines typically destroyed with explosives, grenades and flamethrowers. Though many civilians were able to surrender early in the battle, surrender became more difficult as the battle moved into the northern mountains. Obscuring terrain made it hard to distinguish combatants and surrendering civilians, who risked being killed by both sides. Many refused to surrender because they believed rumors that the Japanese fleet was coming to rescue them. Some refused because of the fear spread by Japanese propaganda that Americans would rape, torture and kill them; others were coerced. Around 1,000 civilians committed suicide during the final days of the battle, some after 9 July when the island had been declared secure. Many died by throwing themselves off cliffs at places that would become known as \"Suicide Cliff\" and \"Banzai Cliff\". 25]}}\nLogistics\nComes Ashore, Saipan'', a 1944 oil painting by William Franklin Draper. (Navy Art Collection, Naval History and Heritage Command)|upright=1.2|alt=tracked landing vehicle on right, tree on left, in center and right are shirtless soldiers waiting around, ships are in the background.]]\nThe American forces brought their supplies with the invasion fleet, carrying over one ton of supplies per soldier: 32 days of rations, 30 days of medical supplies, 20 days of maintenance supplies, seven days of ammunition for ground weapons, and 10 days of anti-aircraft ammunition. Mobile reserves and an ammunition resupply train, as well as regular resupply shipments came from depots at Eniwetok, which was  from Saipan.\nDuring the early days of the invasion, LVTs dumped boxes of rations, water and ammunition on the beaches. Heavy swells on the first days forced many of the supplies to be loaded on only one beach, and LVTs were required to get over reefs that restricted access. Constant Japanese mortar and artillery fire interfered with organizing these supplies for the first three days. Unloading became haphazard, and some units had difficulty finding their equipment. The withdrawal of the transports for five days during the Battle of Philippine Sea also slowed down the delivery of supplies.\nThe 27th Infantry Division particularly suffered from this initial disorganization. No plans had been made for its landing and it did not have an assigned unloading area. Its equipment was mixed up with the Marine divisions and its artillery ammunition was misplaced. Because it arrived on Saipan after the Marine divisions, the 27th Infantry Division had less time to unload its supplies before the transports temporarily headed east on 18 June. Initially, the division only had enough infantry ammunition for four days. Food and artillery ammunition had to be borrowed from the Marines, and water had to be supplemented from cisterns captured at Aslito Field.\nLater in the campaign, mortar ammunition ran low as planners had underestimated how frequently they would be used, and there were shortages of motorized transportation, which was used for getting supplies from the beach to the frontline. Naval ships ran low on star shells due to their high demand, and their use had to be rationed. Despite these issues, the overall supply situation during the battle was good: the Americans had an abundance of materiel.\nThe Japanese troops had no chance of reinforcement. From January to June, the Japanese had tried to ship men and supplies to Saipan, but many ships around the island were torpedoed by American submarines. The Japanese government reported that one ship out of three sent to the Marianas was sunk and another was damaged. Though many of the men survived, almost all the materiel was lost. For example, on 25 May two freighters from Saipan to Palau were torpedoed, destroying 2,956 tons of food, 5,300 cans of aviation fuel, 2,500 cubic meters of ammunition, and 500 tons of cement. 137]}}\nAt the beginning of the battle, the Americans had six times the tanks, five times the artillery, three times as many small arms, and two times as many machine guns available as the Japanese. The Americans also had much more ammunition. The U.S. Navy fired 11,000 tons of shells during the battle, including over 14,000 rounds of 5-inch ammunition. Unlike the Americans, who could replenish their supplies, the Japanese were forced to rely on whatever was available when the invasion started, and when that ran out they were expected to die honorably, resisting until the end. 143]}}\nAftermath\nThe invasion of Saipan and the invasion of France in Operation Overlord demonstrated the dominance of American industrial power. Both were massive amphibious invasions—the two largest up to that time—and they were launched almost simultaneously on separate halves of the globe. Together, they were the greatest deployment of military resources by the United States at one time. Because the Battle of Saipan began just over a week after the 6 June landings for Overlord, its importance has often been overlooked, but just as Overlord was a major step in contributing to the fall of the Third Reich, Saipan marked a major step in the collapse of the Empire of Japan.\nImpact on American military strategy\n, filled with B-29 bombers, mid-1945|left|alt=Aerial view of over 120 bombers parked on large airfield running from lower left to upper right.]]\nThe availability of Saipan as an American airbase, along with the airbases already established in Chengdu, opened a new phase in the Pacific War, in which strategic bombing would play a major role.\nThe 15 June invasion of the island had been synchronized with bombing of the Yawata Steel Works by B-29s from bases in China. It was the first bombing of the Japan home islands by B-29s, signaling the beginning of a campaign that could strike deep into Japan's Absolute National Defense Zone.\nThe Army Air Force was confident that strategic bombing could destroy Japan's military production and that the Marianas provided excellent airbases for doing so because they were  miles from the Japanese home islands. This put almost all of Japan's industrial cities within striking distance of the B-29 bomber, and the airbases were easy to defend and supply.\nSaipan was the first island to base the B-29s. Construction of an aerodrome for B-29s began on Isely Field—the renamed Aslito Field—on 24 June, before the island was declared secure. The first runway was complete by 19 October and the second by 15 December. The 73rd Bombardment Wing began arriving on 12 October. On 24 November, 111 B-29s set out for Tokyo in the first strategic bombing mission against Japan from the Marianas. 458]}}\nThe casualties on Saipan were used by American planners to predict American losses in future engagements. vi]}} This \"Saipan ratio\"—one killed American and several wounded for every seven Japanese soldiers killed—became one of the justifications for American planners to increase conscription, projecting an increased need for replacements in the war on Japan. Its prediction of high casualties was part of the reason that the Joint Chiefs of Staff did not approve an invasion of Taiwan. The Saipan ratio guided the initial estimate that the invasion of Japan would cost up to 2,000,000 American casualties, including 500,000 killed. vi]}} Though these estimates would be revised downward later, they would still influence politicians' thinking about the war well into 1945.}}\nImpact on Japanese politics and morale\nSaipan's loss had a greater impact in Japan than any of its previous defeats. The Emperor of Japan, Hirohito, recognized that American control of the island would result in Tokyo being bombed. After the Japanese defeat at the Battle of Philippine Sea, he demanded that the Japanese General Staff plan another naval attack to prevent its fall. Hirohito only accepted Saipan's eventual fall on 25 June 1944 when his advisors told him all was lost. The defeat brought the collapse of Hideki Tōjō's government. Disappointed with the progress of the war, Hirohito withdrew his support for Tōjō, who resigned as prime minister of Japan on 18 July. He was replaced by former General Kuniaki Koiso, a less capable leader.\nSaipan's fall led the Japanese government's war reporting to admit for the first time that the war was going poorly. In July, Imperial General Headquarters published a statement providing a summary of the battle and the loss of the island, and the government allowed a translation of a Time magazine article, which included the civilian suicides on the last days of the battle, to be published in The Asahi Shimbun, Japan's largest newspaper, while the battle was in progress.}} Before the battle had ended, the Japanese government issued the \"Outline for the Evacuation of Schoolchildren\" in June, anticipating the bombing of Japan's cities. This evacuation, the only compulsory one enacted during the war, separated more than 350,000 third-through sixth-graders who lived in major cities from their families and sent them into the countryside.\nThe capture of Saipan pierced the Absolute National Defense Zone, forcing the Japanese leadership to reconsider the outcomes they could expect for the war. vi]|Kase|1950|2pp=[https://archive.org/details/journeytomissour0000tosh/page/73 73–78]}} In July, the Chief of the War Guidance department of Imperial General Headquarters, Colonel Sei Matsutani, 114]}} drafted a report stating that the conquest of Saipan destroyed all hope of winning the war. 129]–[ 130]}} After the war, many Japanese military and political leaders stated that Saipan was a turning point. 18]|ps=: see supporting quotes by several leaders on pp. [ 18–19]}} For example, Vice Admiral Shigeyoshi Miwa stated \"Our war was lost with the loss of Saipan,\"}} and Fleet Admiral Osami Nagano acknowledged the battle's importance, saying \"When we lost Saipan, Hell is on us.\"}}\nMemorials\nSuicide Cliff and Banzai Cliff, along with surviving isolated Japanese fortifications, are recognized as historic sites on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The cliffs are part of the National Historic Landmark District Landing Beaches; Aslito/Isley Field; & Marpi Point, Saipan Island, which includes the American landing beaches, the B-29 runways of Isley Field, and the surviving Japanese infrastructure of the Aslito and Marpi Point airfields. The Maritime Heritage Trail has a series of dive sites with submerged ships, planes and tanks from the battle.
