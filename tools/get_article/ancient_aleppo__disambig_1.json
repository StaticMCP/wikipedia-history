Prior to the Syrian Civil War, many districts of the ancient city remained essentially unchanged since they were initially constructed between the 11th and 16th centuries. Being subjected to constant invasions and political instability, the inhabitants of the city were forced to build economically independent cell-like quarters and districts, most of which were delineated along ethnic and religious lines. These urban subdistricts, along with the ancient walled city that they surround, comprise an approximate area of  and are home to more than 120,000 residents.\nCharacterized by its large mansions, narrow alleys, covered souqs and ancient caravanserais, the Ancient City of Aleppo became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986.\nAn estimated 30% of the Ancient City of Aleppo was destroyed in the Battle of Aleppo during the Syrian civil war, including many sections of the Al-Madina Souq and other structures dating back to medieval times.\nOrigins and founding\nLying on the left bank of Queiq River the ancient city was surrounded by a circle of eight hills surrounding a prominent central hill on which the castle (originally a temple dating to the 2nd millennium BC) was erected in the shape of an acropolis. The radius of the circle is about . The hills are Tell as-Sawda, Tell ʕāysha, Tell as-Sett, Tell al-Yāsmīn (Al-ʕaqaba), Tell al-Ansāri (Yārūqiyya), ʕan at-Tall, al-Jallūm, Baḥsīta. With an approximate area of , the ancient city was enclosed within a historic wall of  in circuit that was last rebuilt by the Mamlukes. The wall has since mostly disappeared. It had nine gates (5 of them are well preserved) and was surrounded by a broad deep ditch.\nThe newer Jdeydeh quarters of the old city were first built by the Christians during the early 15th century in the northern suburbs of the ancient city, after the Mongol withdrawal from Aleppo. Jdeydeh is one of the finest examples of a cell-like quarter in Aleppo. As a result of the economic development, many other quarters were established outside the walls of the ancient city during the 15th and 16th centuries.\nHistorical timeline\nThroughout its history, Aleppo has been part of the following states:\n– mid-23rd century BC, Kingdom of Armi\n*mid-23rd century BC – mid-22nd century BC, Akkadian Empire\n*21st century BC – 19th century BC, Eblaite Kingdom\n* – 1595 BC, Amorite Kingdom of Yamhad\n*1595 BC – , Hittite Kingdom\n*, Mitanni\n*, New Kingdom of Egypt\n* – early 12th century BC, Hittite Kingdom\n*11th century BC, Syro-Hittite kingdom of Palistin\n*10th century BC, Syro-Hittite kingdom of Bit Agusi\n*9th century BC – late 7th century BC, Neo-Assyrian Empire\n*early 6th century BC – mid-6th century BC, Chaldean Empire\n* – c. 350 BC, Persian Achaemenid Empire\n*333–312 BC, Macedonian Empire\n*312–88 BC, Seleucid Empire\n*88–64 BC, Armenian Empire\n*64–27 BC, Roman Republic\n*27 BC – 395 AD, Roman Empire\n*476–608, Byzantine Empire\n*608–622, Sassanid Persia\n*622–637, Byzantine Empire (restored)\n*637–661, Rashidun Caliphate\n*661–750, Umayyad Caliphate\n*750–878, Abbasid Caliphate\n*878–905, Tulunids\n*905–941, Abbasid Caliphate (restored)\n*941–944, Ikhshidids\n*944–1003, Hamdanids\n*1003–1038, Fatimid Caliphate\n*1038–1080, Mirdasids\n*1080–1086, Uqaylids\n*1086–1118, Seljuq Empire\n*1118–1128, Artuqids\n*1128–1183, Zengids\n*1183–1260, Ayyubids\n*1260 March–October, Mongol Empire\n*1260–1400, Mamluk Sultanate\n*1400 Timurid Empire\n*1400–1516, Mamluk Sultanate (restored)\n*1516–1918, Ottoman Empire\n*1920 March–July, Arab Kingdom of Syria\n*1920–1924, State of Aleppo under the French Mandate\n*1924–1946, French Mandate of Syria\n*1946–1958, Syrian Republic\n*1958–1961, United Arab Republic\n*1961–2024, Ba'athist Syria\n*2024–present, Syria\n}}\nPre-history and pre-classical era\n]]\nAleppo has scarcely been touched by archaeologists, since the modern city occupies its ancient site.\nEarly Bronze Age\nAleppo appears in historical records as an important city much earlier than Damascus. The first record of Aleppo may be from the third millennium BC if the identification of Aleppo as Armi, a city-state closely related to Ebla is correct. Armi has also been identified with the modern Tell Bazi. Giovanni Pettinato describes Armi as Ebla's alter ego. Naram-Sin of Akkad (or his grandfather Sargon) destroyed both Ebla and Arman in the 23rd century BC.\nMiddle Bronze Age\nIn the Old Babylonian period, Aleppo's name appears as Ḥalab (Ḥalba) for the first time. Aleppo was the capital of the important Amorite dynasty of Yamḥad. The kingdom of Yamḥad (c. 1800–1600&nbsp;BC), alternatively known as the 'land of Ḥalab', was the most powerful in the Near East at the time.\nYamḥad was destroyed by the Hittites under Mursilis I in the 16th century BC. However, Aleppo soon resumed its leading role in Syria when the Hittite power in the region waned due to internal strife.\nLate Bronze Age\nTaking advantage of the power vacuum in the region, Parshatatar, king of the Hurrian kingdom of Mitanni, conquered Aleppo in the 15th century BC. Subsequently, Aleppo found itself on the frontline in the struggle between the Mitanni and the Hittites and Egypt.\nThe Hittite Suppiluliumas I permanently defeated Mitanni and conquered Aleppo in the 14th century BC. Aleppo had cultic importance to the Hittites for being the center of worship of the Storm-God.\nIron Age\nWhen the Hittite kingdom collapsed in the 12th century BC, Aleppo became part of the Syro-Hittite kingdom of Palistin, then the Aramaean Syro-Hittite kingdom of Bit Agusi (which had its capital at Arpad), it stayed part of that kingdom until conquered by the Assyrians in the 9th century BC, and became part of the Neo-Assyrian Empire until the late 7th century BC, before passing through the hands of the Neo-Babylonians and the Achaemenid Persians.\nClassical antiquity\nAlexander the Great took over the city in 333 BC. Seleucus Nicator established a Hellenic settlement in the site between 301 and 286 BC. He called it Beroea (), after Beroea in Macedon.\nNorthern Syria was the centre of gravity of the Hellenistic colonizing activity, and therefore of Hellenistic culture in the Seleucid Empire. As did other Hellenized cities of the Seleucid kingdom, Beroea probably enjoyed a measure of local autonomy, with a local civic assembly or  composed of free Hellenes.\nBeroea remained under Seleucid rule for nearly 300 years until the last holdings of the Seleucid dynasty were handed over to Pompey in 64 BC, at which time they became a Roman province. Rome's presence afforded relative stability in northern Syria for over three centuries. Although the province was administered by a legate from Rome, Rome did not impose its administrative organization on the Greek-speaking ruling class.\nBeroea is mentioned in 2 Maccabees 13:4.\nMedieval period and the expansion of the city\nperiod]]\nThe Sassanid King Khosrow I pillaged and burned Aleppo in 540&nbsp;CE. Later on, the Sassanid Persians invaded Syria briefly in the early 7th century. Soon after, Aleppo fell to Arab Muslims under Khalid ibn al-Walid in 637. In 944, it became the seat of an independent emirate under the Hamdanid prince Sayf al-Daula, and enjoyed a period of great prosperity.\nOn 9 August 1138, a deadly earthquake ravaged the city and the surrounding area. Although estimates from this time are very unreliable, it is believed that 230,000 people died, making it the fifth deadliest earthquake in recorded history.\nAfter Tamerlane invaded Aleppo in 1400 and destroyed it, the Christians migrated out of the city walls and established their cell in 1420, at the northwestern suburbs of the city, thus founding the quarters of Jdeydeh. The inhabitants of Jdeydeh were mainly brokers who facilitated trade between foreign traders and local merchants. Many other districts were built outside the historic walls during the 15th and 16th centuries.\nMention is made of the city, by one of the witches, in William Shakespeare's Macbeth, written between 1603 and 1607.\nMain sights\nAleppo is characterized by mixed architectural styles, having been ruled, among the other, by Romans, Byzantines, Seljuqs, Mamluks and Ottomans.\nVarious types of 13th and 14th centuries constructions, such as caravanserais, caeserias, Quranic schools, hammams and religious buildings are found in the old city. The quarters of Jdeydeh district are home to numerous 16th and 17th-century houses of the  Aleppine bourgeoisie, featuring   stone engravings.\nSouqs and Khans\n]]\n]]\nThe city's strategic trading position attracted settlers of all races and beliefs who wished to take advantage of the commercial roads that met in Aleppo from as far as China and Mesopotamia to the east, Europe to the west, and the Fertile Crescent and Egypt to the south. The largest covered souq-market in the world is in Aleppo, with an approximate length of .\nAl-Madina Souq, as it is locally known, is an active trade centre for imported luxury goods, such as raw silk from Iran, spices and dyes from India, and coffee from Damascus. Souq al-Madina is also home to local products such as wool, agricultural products and soap. Most of the souqs  date back to the 14th century and are named after various professions and crafts, hence the wool souq, the copper souq, and so on. Aside from trading, the souq accommodated the traders and their goods in khans (caravanserais) and scattered in the souq. Other types of small market-places were called caeserias (قيساريات). Caeserias are smaller than khans in their sizes and functioned as workshops for craftsmen. Most of the khans took their names after their location in the souq and function, and are characterized with their beautiful façades and entrances with fortified wooden doors.\nThe most significant khans within and along the covered area of Souq al-Madina are: Khan al-Qadi from 1450, Khan al-Saboun from the early 16th century, Khan al-Nahhaseen from 1539, Khan al-Shouneh from 1546, Khan al-Jumrok from 1574, Souq Khan al-Wazir from 1682, Souq al-Farrayin, Souq al-Dira', Souq al-Hiraj, Souq al-Attarine, Souq az-Zirb, Souq Marcopoli, Souq as-Siyyagh, ''The Venetians' Khan,*Souq Khan al-Harir from the second half of the 16th century, Suweiqa, etc.\nOther traditional souqs and khans in Jdeydeh quarter (outside the walled city):\n*Souq al-Hokedun or \"Khan al-Quds\". Hokedun means \"the spiritual house\" in Armenian, as it was built to serve as a settlement for the Armenian pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem. The old part of the Hokedun dates back to the late 15th and early 16th centuries while the newer part was built during the 17th century. Nowadays, it is turned into a big souq with a large number of stores specialized in garment trade.\n*Souq as-Souf or the wool market, located at Salibeh street, surrounded with the old churches of the quarter.\n*Bawabet al-Qasab, a trade centre for wooden products.\nHistoric buildings\nThe most significant historic buildings of the ancient city include:\n]]\n-School]]\nArghun al-Kamili, 1354]]\n]]\n, 18th century]]\n*The Citadel, a large fortress built atop a huge, partially artificial mound rising  above the city, dates back to the first millennium BC. Recent excavations unearthed a temple and 25 statues dating back to the first millennium BC. Many of the current structures date from the 13th century.

Saint Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, built a great Byzantine cathedral here. When the Crusaders were pillaging the surrounding countryside, the city's chief judge converted the cathedral into a mosque.

After World War II, the city was significantly redesigned; in 1954 French architect André Gutton had a number of wide new roads cut through the city to allow easier passage for modern traffic. Between 1954–1983 many buildings in the old city were demolished to allow for the construction of modern apartment blocks, particularly in the northwestern areas (Bab al-Faraj and Bab al-Jinan). As awareness for the need to preserve this unique cultural heritage increased, Gutton's master plan was finally abandoned in 1979 to be replaced with a new plan presented by the Swiss expert and urban designer Stefano Bianca, which adopted the idea of \"preserving the traditional architectural style of Ancient Aleppo\" paving the way for prominent local activists, among them Adli Qudsi, to convince UNESCO to declare the Ancient City of Aleppo as a World Heritage Site in 1986.\nThe armed conflict in Syria started in March 2011 and has constantly escalated leading to significant violence and degradation of humanitarian conditions. Since the 39th session of the World Heritage Committee (Bonn, 2015), the armed conflict has caused severe damage to the inscribed properties and to the twelve sites inscribed on the Tentative List, by shelling, street fighting, underground explosions, extensive illegal excavations, military use, construction violations, quarrying, in addition to intentional destructions and inappropriate use of archaeological sites by internally displaced populations.\nSeveral international institutions joined efforts with local authorities and the Aleppo Archaeological Society, to rehabilitate the old city by accommodating contemporary life while preserving the old one. The governorate and the municipality were implementing serious programmes directed towards the enhancement of the ancient city and Jdeydeh quarter.\nThe German Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and Aga Khan Foundation (within the frames of Aga Khan Historic Cities Programme) had a great contribution in the preservation process of the old city. The local representative of the Aga Khan Trust for Culture from 1999 until 2008 was the architect Adli Qudsi, who played a large role in the protection of the Old City from the destructive forces of urban expansion.\nThe rehabilitation of the Old City of Aleppo has received the Veronica Rudge Green Prize in Urban Design from Harvard University's Graduate School of Design in 2005.\nSee also\n*Tourism in Syria\n*Al-Shibani Church\n*Aleppo Codex\n*Battle of Aleppo (2012–2016)\n*Central Synagogue of Aleppo\n*Dead Cities\n*Timeline of Aleppo\n*List of World Heritage in Danger\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120315104152/http://www.udp-aleppo.org/?id=155 3-D Old Aleppo map]\n*[http://www.esyria.sy/ealeppo/ Aleppo news and services (eAleppo)]\n*[http://www.ovpm.org/en/syrian_arab_rep/aleppo/ Organization of World Heritage Cities]\n*[http://collections.si.edu/search/results.jsp?date.slider=&date.slider=&date.slider=&q=ernst+herzfeld+&view=grid&fq=place:%22Aleppo+%28Syria%29%22 Ernst Herzfeld Papers, Series 5: Drawings and Maps, Records of Aleppo]  Collections Search Center, S.I.R.I.S., Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040817102050/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200402/suq.4000.years.behind.the.counter.in.aleppo.htm Louis Werner, 4000 Years Behind the Counters in Aleppo, 2004, Saudi Aramco World]"
