It was released in 1990 as Gabriel's first career retrospective, including songs from his first solo album Peter Gabriel (I or Car) (1977), through Passion: Music for The Last Temptation of Christ (1989). It was remastered with most of Gabriel's catalogue in 2002. The vinyl version of the album is called Shaking the Tree: Twelve Golden Greats.\nTrack selection\nThe tracks are creatively re-ordered, ignoring chronology. Some of the tracks were different from the album versions. New parts were recorded for several tracks in Gabriel's Real World Studios. Most songs are edited for time, either as radio, single, or video edit versions. \"Shakin' the Tree\"—a track from Youssou N'Dour's 1989 album The Lion—is a 1990 version featuring new vocals from Gabriel (and slightly revised title). \"I Have the Touch\" is listed as a 1983 remix, although it is actually the 1985 remix which appeared on the \"Sledgehammer\" single. (The 1985 remix is similar to the 1983 remix, which appeared as the B-side of the \"Walk Through the Fire\" single, but is edited down to 3m 45s)\n\"Here Comes the Flood\" is a new recording from 1990. This version is a piano and voice arrangement, that is far simpler than the highly produced version on Peter Gabriel (1977). Its sparseness is closer to the version Gabriel recorded with Robert Fripp on Fripp's Exposure (1979). In interviews, Gabriel has said that he preferred the 1979 version, which he also chose to overdub in German as the flipside of the single \"Biko\" released before Ein deutsches Album (1980).\nAlthough this album highlights songs from Peter Gabriel's earlier albums, tracks from Peter Gabriel (II, or Scratch) and the soundtrack to the film Birdy are not included. \"In Your Eyes\" is missing from the compilation. Say Anything..., in which it was played in a prominent scene, had been released the year before. Although this made \"In Your Eyes\" perhaps the most well known Peter Gabriel song aside from \"Sledgehammer\" in the U.S., it was not released as a single in Peter Gabriel's UK homeland. \"In Your Eyes\" was therefore omitted from the album in favour of five of the other eight tracks from So – four other hits and the album track \"Mercy Street\".\nRelease\nFor the album packaging, Gabriel decided to forgo longboxes in favor of a jewel box as a means of reducing waste. Robert Smith, who served as the head of marketing for Geffen Records, defended Gabriel's decision to exclusively release the album in a jewel box, saying that \"it is not a clause in his contract. It is Peter Gabriel's personal wishes, and we are respecting those wishes.\" Some record store outlets including Show Industries, Kemp Mill, and Music Plus refused to carry the album in their stores because of Gabriel's choice of packaging.\nMusic & Media called Shaking The Tree a \"quality compilation\" with \"intelligent, melodic pop songs, which, in all their diversity, possess the unmistakable Gabriel touch of genius\". Cashbox thought that the compilation served as \"an excellent introduction\" to Gabriel's solo discography.\nTrack listing\nTracks marked with (*) do not appear on the vinyl release of the album.\nPersonnel\n;\"Solsbury Hill\"\n*Bob Ezrin&nbsp;– production\n*Larry Fast&nbsp;– synthesizer\n*Robert Fripp&nbsp;– guitar\n*Peter Gabriel&nbsp;– vocals\n*Steve Hunter&nbsp;– guitar\n*Tony Levin&nbsp;– bass guitar\n*Alan Schwartzberg&nbsp;– drums\n;\"I Don't Remember\" (Edited version)\n*Larry Fast&nbsp;– processing\n*Robert Fripp&nbsp;– guitar\n*Peter Gabriel&nbsp;– piano, synthesizer, vocals, and production\n*Tony Levin&nbsp;– Chapman Stick\n*Jerry Marrotta&nbsp;– drums\n*David Rhodes&nbsp;– guitar\n*Peter Walsh&nbsp;– production\n;\"Sledgehammer\" (Single edit)\n*P.P.
