In 1928 he donated £2000 to the engineering school of the University of Melbourne for laboratory extensions.\nScholarship funds\nLewis bequeathed a £700,000 endowment that after his death established the Dafydd Lewis Trust. This provided scholarships for full-time degree courses (other than in theology, arts, music or education) at the University of Melbourne for boys from Victorian state schools whose parents could not afford to pay for a university education.\nAlthough the original scholarships helped to support post-graduate education as well as a first degree, as of 2024 only undergraduate study is supported, for up to three years.\nIn 2004 a parallel scholarship fund, the Mary Jane Lewis Foundation was established to give scholarships to female university students in Victoria at the undergraduate level. The fund is named after Dafydd Lewis' second wife Mary Jane Jones Evans.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100912181502/http://www.lewisscholarships.org.au/Dafydd-Lewis-Trust/index.html Dafydd Lewis Trust] retrieved 5 September 2010"
