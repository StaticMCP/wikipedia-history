In antiquity it was part of Laconia.\nHistory\nIn 424&nbsp;BCE, during the Peloponnesian War, the Athenians made an expedition against the island of Cythera, with sixty ships. When they reached the island they first took Scandeia and then they went against Cythera town, which was then far from the sea. Its inhabitants resisted a time but then they agreed to submit to the Athenians, who afterwards established a garrison there. Some inhabitants of Cythera were moved for security reasons and the rest of the inhabitants had to pay a tribute of four talents. In the Peace of Nicias of the year 421&nbsp;BCE it was stipulated that the Athenians should return Cythera to the Spartans; however, in the expedition to Sicily year 415&nbsp;BCE, the Cythereans fought beside the Athenians.\nIn the year 393&nbsp;BCE, an expedition under the command of Pharnabazus II occupied Cythera and its inhabitants were sent to Laconia. Pharnabazus had the walls repaired and left a garrison under the command of the Athenian Nicophemus.\nIn Strabo's time, Cythera was occupied as private property by the Spartan Gaius Julius Eurycles.\nPausanias located the city of Cythera at ten stadia from Scandeia and mentions that the townsfolk worshiped Aphrodite Urania and that the origin of this cult was Phoenician.\nIts site is located at Paleokastro.\nReferences"
