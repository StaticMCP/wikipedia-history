The ceremony took place at The O2 Arena in London, and was hosted by British comedian Mo Gilligan. Coverage of the red carpet was broadcast on ITV2 and presented by Clara Amfo and Maya Jama.\nThe BPI announced in November 2021 that the Brit Awards would no longer use gendered categories, and that it would also revive the categories for best Alternative/Rock Act, Dance Act, Hip Hop/Rap/Grime Act, and Pop/R&B Act. Nominations were announced on 18 December 2021, with Adele, Dave, Ed Sheeran, and Little Simz tied for the most nominations, and the largest number of nominations given to female acts since Brit Awards 2010.\nPerformances\nNominations show\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Performer(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Song\n!UK Singles Chart reaction(week ending 24 December 2021)\n!UK Albums Chart reaction(week ending 24 December 2021)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Anne-Marie\n| \"Kiss My (Uh-Oh)\"\n|\n| Therapy – 78 (re-entry)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Glass Animals\n| \"Heat Waves\"\n| 65 (–12)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Mimi Webb\n| \"Good Without\"\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Joel CorryGracey\n| \"Out Out\"\"Bed\"\"I Wish\"\n| N/AN/A45 (–9)\n|\n|}\nMain show\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"|Performer(s)\n! scope=\"col\"|Song\n!

To compensate for the removal of categories, four genre-based awards—Alternative/Rock Act, Dance Act, Hip Hop/Rap/Grime Act, and Pop/R&B Act—were reinstated.  These awards were voted on via TikTok.\nNominees for the Rising Star Award were announced on 30 November 2021 and the winner was announced on 9 December 2021. The nominees for the other categories were announced on 18 December 2021 during a televised special, The Brits Are Coming, which was hosted by Maya Jama and Clara Amfo.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%\"\n|+\n! width=\"50%\" |British Album of the Year(presented by Idris Elba)\n! width=\"50%\" |British Artist of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Adele – 30'\n** Dave – ''We're All Alone in This Together\n** Ed Sheeran – =\n** Little Simz – Sometimes I Might Be Introvert\n** Sam Fender – Seventeen Going Under''\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Adele\n** Dave\n** Ed Sheeran\n** Little Simz\n** Sam Fender\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" |British Group of the Year\n! width=\"50%\" |British Song of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Wolf Alice\n** Coldplay\n** D-Block Europe\n** Little Mix\n** London Grammar\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Adele – \"Easy on Me\"\n** A1 x J1 – \"Latest Trends\"\n** Anne-Marie, KSI & Digital Farm Animals – \"Don't Play\"\n** Becky Hill & David Guetta – \"Remember\"\n** Central Cee – \"Obsessed with You\"\n** Dave featuring Stormzy – \"Clash\"\n** Ed Sheeran – \"Bad Habits\"\n** Elton John & Dua Lipa – \"Cold Heart\"\n** Glass Animals – \"Heat Waves\"\n** Joel Corry, Raye & David Guetta – \"Bed\"\n** KSI – \"Holiday\"\n** Nathan Evans, 220 Kid & Billen Ted – \"Wellerman (220 Kid x Billen Ted remix)\"\n** Riton x Nightcrawlers featuring Mufasa & Hypeman – \"Friday\"\n** Tion Wayne & Russ Millions – \"Body\"\n** Tom Grennan – \"Little Bit of Love\"\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Pop/R&B Act\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Dance Act\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Dua Lipa\n** Adele\n** Ed Sheeran\n** Griff\n** Joy Crookes\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Becky Hill\n** Calvin Harris\n** Fred Again\n** Joel Corry\n** Raye\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" |Best New Artist\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Rock/Alternative Act\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Little Simz\n** Central Cee\n** Griff\n** Joy Crookes\n** Self Esteem\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Sam Fender\n** Coldplay\n** Glass Animals\n** Tom Grennan\n** Wolf Alice\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Hip Hop/Rap/Grime Act\n! width=\"50%\" |International Artist of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Dave\n** AJ Tracey\n** Central Cee\n** Ghetts\n** Little Simz\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Billie Eilish\n** Doja Cat\n** Lil Nas X\n** Olivia Rodrigo\n** Taylor Swift\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" |International Group of the Year\n! width=\"50%\" |Best International Song\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Silk Sonic\n** ABBA\n** BTS\n** Måneskin\n** The War on Drugs\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Olivia Rodrigo – \"Good 4 U\"\n** ATB, Topic & A7S – \"Your Love (9PM)\"\n** Billie Eilish – \"Happier Than Ever\"\n** CKay featuring Joeboy and Kuami Eugene – \"Love Nwantiti Remix (Ah Ah Ah)\"\n** Doja Cat featuring SZA – \"Kiss Me More\"\n** Drake featuring Lil Baby – \"Girls Want Girls\"\n** Galantis, David Guetta & Little Mix – \"Heartbreak Anthem\"\n** Jonasu – \"Black Magic\"\n** The Kid Laroi & Justin Bieber – \"Stay\"\n** Lil Nas X – \"Montero (Call Me by Your Name)\"\n** Lil Tjay & 6lack – \"Calling My Phone\"\n** Måneskin – \"I Wanna Be Your Slave\"\n** Polo G – \"Rapstar\"\n** Tiësto – \"The Business\"\n** The Weeknd – \"Save Your Tears\"\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" |Rising Star\n! width=\"50%\" |British Producer of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Holly Humberstone\n** Bree Runway\n** Lola Young\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Inflo\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" |Songwriter of the Year\n! width=\"50%\" |\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Ed Sheeran\n| valign=\"top\" |\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.brits.co.uk/ Brit Awards official website]"
