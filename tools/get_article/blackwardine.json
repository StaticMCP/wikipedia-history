A golden bracelet and ring have been found here, as well as many human remains. An 1885 account notes \"broken pieces of pottery were thickly scattered about and in one part of the railway cutting near the surface some 40 or  of charred material 18 inches thick were observed.\"\nBlackwardine is where Alfred Watkins first developed his theory of Ley lines on 30 June 1921. The place was excavated the same year.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.geograph.org.uk/search.php?i=3856032 Photos of Blackwardine and surrounding area on geograph]"
