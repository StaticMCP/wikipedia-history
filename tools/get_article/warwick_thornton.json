His debut feature film Samson and Delilah won the Caméra d'Or at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival and the award for Best Film at the Asia Pacific Screen Awards. He also won the Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Film in 2017 for Sweet Country. His latest film is Wolfram, which premieres at the Adelaide Film Festival on 26 October 2025.\nEarly life and education\nThornton is a Kaytetye man born and raised in Alice Springs. His mother, Freda Glynn, co-founded and was the first director of the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association (CAAMA) and was the director of Imparja Television for its first 10 years.\nAt 13, Thornton was sent to boarding school, Salvado College, in Australia's only monastic town, New Norcia, Western Australia, although he later declared he became angry with Christianity and did not consider himself religious.\nHe graduated in cinematography from the Australian Film, Television and Radio School.\nCareer\nThornton began his career making short films and achieved success with them at film festivals around the world, including the short film Payback (1996) at the Telluride Film Festival. He directed and wrote From Sand to Celluloid – Payback under the auspices of the Indigenous Branch of the Australian Film Commission, with production by Blackfella Films. Rachel Perkins was line producer on the film. Other films achieving international success were Green Bush and Nana, at the Berlin International Film Festival.\nHe describes his decision to become a filmmaker in an interview in 2007:\nWhere I grew up in Alice I was a DJ for a radio station (CAAMA). The station began a film unit and so I watched people pack cameras and equipment into cars and take off to make films. I was alone at the radio station and I thought that I really wanted to go with them. That's how it started, I made a film called Green Bush which is basically about that time. Eventually I went to AFTRS in Sydney and got really involved as a Director of Photography.\nThornton shared a personal as well as professional relationship with Beck Cole, and along with producer Kath Shelper called themselves \"the trinity\", working together from 2004.\nIn 2009 Thornton wrote, directed and shot his first feature film Samson & Delilah, which won awards including the Camera d’Or for best first feature film at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. The following year he filmed the documentary series Art + Soul about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artists, which was written and narrated by curator Hetti Perkins. The installation Mother Courage (inspired by Bertolt Brecht's 1939 character) was commissioned by dOCUMENTA and ACMI, and first exhibited in 2012.\nHis 2017 historical drama Sweet Country garnered critical acclaim and several awards, including the Special Jury Prize at the 74th Venice Film Festival; Platform Prize at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival; the Audience Award at the 2017 Adelaide Film Festival; and the Best Feature Film at the 2017 Asia Pacific Screen Awards.\nIn 2020 he directed a six-part documentary series called The Beach (2020), about himself in isolation on a beach on the remote Dampier Peninsula. The film was shot by his son Dylan River.\nThornton directed a video used to advocate for the \"Yes\" campaign in the 2023 Australian Indigenous Voice referendum, a vote to change the Australian Constitution to enshrine a Voice to Parliament for Indigenous Australians. The video, using John Farnham's iconic 1986 song \"You're the Voice\" as a soundtrack, was released on 3 September 2023 and was rolled out on social and other digital media and television. In 2024, Thornton told Virginia Trioli, when he appeared as her guest in an episode of the series Creative Types, that he was working on a film that represented his anger at the result of the 2023 Voice referendum.\nIn 2025, Thornton worked with the Westerman Jilya Institute for Indigenous Mental Health, founded by psychologist Tracy Westerman, to make a film about Aboriginal mental health, for their initiative called \"Change Direction\", which was launched nationwide in the lead-up to National Reconciliation Week in May 2025. Actor Pedrea Jackson featured in the film.\nHis 2025 film, Wolfram, premiered on the closing night of the Adelaide Film Festival on 26 October 2025. Based on a real story and set in 1932, the film stars Deborah Mailman as a mother longing for the return of her stolen children. It is a sequel to Sweet Country, and features some of the same characters. Thornton served as director and cinematographer on the film. Wolfram looks at the exploitation of First Nations child labour.\nOther activities\nIn 2020 Thornton was co-presenter, with Beck Cole, of a five-day development workshop called the Aboriginal Short Film Initiative, held at South Australian Film Corporation's Adelaide Studios.\nFamily and personal life\nThornton's sister, Erica Glynn, is also a film writer and director.\nThornton was formerly married to filmmaker Beck Cole, whom he met in 1999. They have a daughter, Luka May, an actress also known as Luka Magdeline Cole or Luka May Glynn-Cole. The couple shared a personal as well as professional relationship (see above). By 2018 Thornton and Cole had separated.\nThornton also has a son, Dylan River, who is a filmmaker who has worked with his father.\nHe also has another daughter, Rona Glynn-McDonald, whose mother is producer Penelope McDonald, principal of Chili Films. Glynn-McDonald is the founding CEO of Common Ground, an organisation focused on reconciliation, and co-founder of First Nations Futures. In 2019 she filmed a series of short films called \"Bedtime Stories\", based on Dreamtime stories. The films were produced by her mother, while her father and brother also assisted. In the same year, she won the Diana Award for her work in \"creating and sustaining positive change for Australia, primarily through sharing stories of First Nations people to a wide audience across Australia\".  Glynn-McDonald is in a relationship with AFL player and TV personality Tony Armstrong.\nThornton chooses to continue to live in Alice Springs, which, he says gives him \"strength and energy\".\nRecognition and awards\nCritic David Stratton describes Thornton as \"one of our greatest filmmakers\", while Cate Blanchett calls him \"the most brilliant visual storyteller\".\nAuthor and broadcaster Virginia Trioli writes that Thornton's work is \"driven by his emotional and intellectual response to the historical dispossession and contemporary despair of his people\", using his films to tell stories with the minimum of dialogue.\nIn 2009, Thorton was named Northern Territorian of the Year\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Film\n!Award\n!Festival\n|-\n|2007\n|Nana\n|Melbourne Airport Award for Emerging Talent\n|Melbourne International Film Festival\n|-\n|2007\n|Nana\n|Best Short Film\n|Inside Film Awards (IF Awards)\n|-\n|2008\n|Nana\n|Best Short Film\n|Berlin International Film Festival\n|-\n|2009\n|Samson and Delilah\n|Caméra d'Or\n|Cannes Film Festival\n|-\n|2009\n|Samson and Delilah\n|Feature Film Screenplay (Original)\n|Australian Writers' Guild Award\n|-\n|2009\n|Samson and Delilah\n|Outstanding Achievement in Film\n|Deadly Awards\n|-\n|2009\n|Samson and Delilah\n|Best Director, Best Script and Best Music\n|Inside Film Awards\n|-\n|2009\n|Nana\n|Best Short Film Director\n|Inside Film Awards\n|-\n|2009\n|Samson and Delilah\n|Best Film\n|Asia Pacific Screen Awards\n|-\n|2009\n|Samson and Delilah\n|Best Director and Best Original Screenplay\n|AFI Awards\n|-\n|2009\n|Samson and Delilah\n|Best Music\n|Dinosaur Design IF Award\n|-\n|2009\n|Samson and Delilah\n|Award for Best Direction\n|National Film and Sound Archive IF Award\n|-\n|-\n|2017\n|Sweet Country\n|Best Film\n|Asia Pacific Screen Awards\n|-\n|2017\n|Sweet Country\n|Platform Prize\n|Toronto International Film Festival\n|}\nFilmography\nAs director\n* From Sand to Celluloid – Payback (1996), Blackfella Films, short film, also writer\n* ''Willigan's Fitzroy (2000), documentary, also writer\n* Mimi (2002) Blackfella Films, short film, also director, starring Aaron Pedersen and Sophie Lee\n* Green Bush (2005), short film, also writer, starring David Page, produced by CAAMA Productions\n* The Old Man and the Inland Sea (2005), documentary, also writer\n* Burning Daylight (2007), documentary\n* Dark Science (2007), documentary, co-director\n* Nana (2007), short film\n* Samson and Delilah (2009)\n* Art + Soul (2010)\n* The Darkside (2013)\n* Words With Gods (2014)\n* We Don't Need a Map (2017), documentary\n* Sweet Country (2017)\n* Mystery Road series 2 (2020)\n*  The Beach (2020), documentary series\n*  Firebite (2021)\n*  The New Boy (2023)\n* Wolfram (2025)\nAs cinematographer\n* Marn Grook: An Aboriginal Perspective on Australian Rules Football (1997), documentary\n* Radiance (1998), feature film, directed by Rachel Perkins)\n* Buried Country (2000), documentary, directed by Andy Nehl, based on the book by Clinton Walker\n* Ngangkari Way (2001), documentary, directed by Erica Glynn\n* Flat (2001), short film, directed by Beck Cole\n* Mimi (2001), short film, directed by Thornton\n* Kurtal: Snake Spirit (2002), documentary, co-cinematographer\n* Queen of Hearts (2003), directed by Danielle MacLean\n* Wirriya: Small Boy (2004), documentary, co-cinematographer, directed by Beck Cole\n* Five Seasons (2005), documentary, directed by Steven McGregor\n* The Lore of Love (2005), documentary, directed by Beck Cole\n* My Brother Vinnie (2006), documentary, directed by Steven McGregor\n* Plains Empty (2006), short film, directed by Beck Cole\n* Green Bush (2006), short film, directed by Thornton\n* First Australians (2006), television series, directed by Beck Cole & Rachel Perkins\n* Samson & Delilah (2009), feature film, directed by Thornton\n* Here I Am (2011), feature film, directed by Beck Cole\n* The Sapphires (2012), feature film, directed by Wayne Blair\n* Sweet Country (2017), directed by Thornton\n* Wolfram'' (2025), directed by Thornton\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n* Book review and [https://web.archive.org/web/20181101085502/https://www.artshub.com.au/news-article/features/film/liam-egan/35000-feet-away-the-sound-of-planes-over-alice-springs-256736 extract].\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://filminjapan.blogspot.com/2010/09/samson-and-delilah-interview-and.html Interview with Warwick Thornton]"
