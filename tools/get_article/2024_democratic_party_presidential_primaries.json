The elections took place in all U.S. states except Florida and Delaware, in the District of Columbia, in five U.S. territories, and as organized by Democrats Abroad.\nIncumbent President Joe Biden had repeatedly expressed his intent to run for re-election since 2021, although there was speculation in the first two years of his presidency that he might not seek a second term due to his age and low approval ratings. Former Democratic House representatives, including Carolyn Maloney, Joe Cunningham, and Tim Ryan, had publicly said Biden should not run. On July 28, 2022, Representative Dean Phillips became the first incumbent Democratic member of Congress to say President Biden should not run for re-election and called for \"generational change\" pointing to Biden's age. There was also speculation that Biden might face a primary challenge, especially from a member of the Democratic Party's progressive faction.\nAfter Democrats outperformed expectations in the 2022 midterm elections, many believed the chances that Biden would run for and win his party's nomination had increased. On April 25, 2023, Biden announced via a video that he would be running for re-election. Eventually, three main primary opponents emerged; self-help author Marianne Williamson declared her candidacy in March, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist and environmental attorney, declared in April, while Representative Dean Phillips of Minnesota declared in October.\nPhillips campaigned as a younger and more centrist alternative to Biden, who would be a stronger opponent to Trump. Phillips argued that Biden would be a weak general election candidate due to his age and low approval ratings, so he should pass the torch to a new generation. Privately, Democrats shared his concerns. Before launching his campaign, Phillips reportedly reached out to other elected Democratic officials, such as Governors Gretchen Whitmer and JB Pritzker, to convince them to enter the presidential primary race to oppose Biden, but they declined to speak with him directly.\nAdditionally, the Uncommitted National Movement, supported by some Muslim Americans, Arab Americans, progressives, and socialists began advocating in 2024 for an \"uncommitted\" vote in protest against Biden due to his support for Israel during the Gaza war.\nKennedy withdrew from the Democratic primaries in October 2023 to run as an independent candidate. Williamson suspended her campaign following the Nevada primary in February 2024, before unsuspending her campaign following the Michigan primary later that month. On March 6, 2024, Phillips suspended his campaign and endorsed Biden. Phillips received the second-highest number of delegates in the primaries of any candidate (four delegates gained). Biden lost American Samoa to venture capitalist Jason Palmer, becoming the first incumbent president to lose a contest while appearing on the ballot since Jimmy Carter in 1980. However, he won every other contest by a large margin. Biden became the presumptive presidential nominee of the Democratic Party on March 12, 2024, by securing over 1,968 pledged delegates.\nPresident Biden withdrew his candidacy on July 21, following a series of age and health concerns, writing that doing so was \"in the best interest of my party and the country\". He endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor. And though Biden had endorsed Harris as the new candidate at the top of the ticket, there was no obligation for the delegates to follow suit. By the next day, Harris had secured the non-binding support of enough uncommitted delegates that were previously pledged to Biden to make her the presumptive nominee. Harris became the nominee following a virtual roll call with the support of approximately 97.21% of all the delegates and faced opposition from 52 delegates voting for other candidates which were counted as \"present\" as well as 79 abstentions, most notably from Representative Mary Peltola, Representative Jared Golden, and Senator Jon Tester. Harris became the first Democratic nominee to be nominated despite not actively campaigning in the primaries since Hubert Humphrey in the 1968 United States presidential election, and the first to be nominated without winning the primaries since the modern Democratic Party primary procedure was created in 1972.\nHarris and her running mate, Tim Walz, would go on to lose the election to the Republican ticket of Donald Trump and JD Vance.\nPledged delegates by candidate following primaries\nResults\n}}\n{| style=\"float; margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 0.5em\" class=\"infobox\"\n|+Map legend\n|-\n| style=\"padding: 0 5px;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"padding: 0 5px;\" |  Winner not yet declared\n|}\nFile:2024 Democratic Party presidential primary results by pledged delegate allocation.svg|Initial pledged delegate allocation\n{| style=\"float; margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 0.5em\" class=\"infobox\"\n|+Map legend\n|-\n| style=\"padding: 0 5px;\" |\nBiden\nPhillips\nPalmer\nLozada\nUncommitted\nNo votes\n|}\nFile:2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries results by county.svg|First-place results by county\nWrite-in vote totals are excluded from the above election data reporting for the following states, and are added to the total number of votes for candidates for the purposes of candidate vote share calculations:\nCandidates\nAs of April 2024, more than 190 candidates have filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2024.\nFollowing the withdrawal of President Biden on July 21, 2024, the race became an open contest to be decided at the Democratic National Convention.\nNominee\n}}\nDeclined after the primaries\nFile:Andy Beshear 2025.jpg |Andy Beshear, Governor of Kentucky ''(endorsed Biden, then Harris after Biden's withdrawal)\nFile:Pete Buttigieg, Secretary of Transportation.jpg|Pete Buttigieg, U.S. Secretary of Transportation and candidate for president in 2020 (endorsed Biden, then Harris after Biden's withdrawal)\nFile:Hillary Clinton by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|Hillary Clinton, 2016 Democrat nominee, and former U.S. Secretary of State (2009–2013),  U.S. Senator from New York (2001–2009), and First Lady of the United States (1993–2001) (endorsed Biden, then Harris after Biden's withdrawal)\nFile:Amy Klobuchar, official portrait, 113th Congress.jpg|Amy Klobuchar, U.S. Senator from Minnesota (2007–Present), candidate for president in 2020 (endorsed Biden, then Harris after Biden's withdrawal)\nFile:Senator Manchin (cropped 2).jpg|Joe Manchin, U.S. Senator from West Virginia, former Governor of West Virginia (2005–2010) (Independent; expressed interest in running after Biden withdrew, then declined)\nFile:Gavin Newsom official photo.jpg|Gavin Newsom, Governor of California (endorsed Biden, then Harris after Biden's withdrawal)\nFile:Michelle Obama 2013 official portrait.jpg|Michelle Obama, former First Lady of the United States (2009–2017) (endorsed Biden, then Harris after Biden's withdrawal)\nFile:Rep.

Some Democrats expressed skepticism about Biden choosing Harris again as his running mate, as she had also seen similar low approval ratings to Biden. In January 2023, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said in a radio interview that she supported Biden's reelection bid, but stopped short of supporting Harris. She later clarified her position, saying she supported the Biden–Harris ticket.\nFollowing Biden's withdrawal from the race in late July, it was reported that the Harris campaign was vetting nearly a dozen candidates to be her running mate. Several governors, including J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Roy Cooper of North Carolina, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, were considered top contenders. Also under consideration were U.S. Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg of Indiana, and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island. According to Mark Cuban, the Harris campaign reached out to him to express interest in vetting him for the position, but he declined.\nOn August 1, NBC News and The New York Times reported that Harris's final shortlist included Andy Beshear, Pete Buttigieg, Mark Kelly, J. B. Pritzker, Josh Shapiro, and Tim Walz. On August 6, 2024, Harris chose Tim Walz to be her running mate.\nPrimaries and caucus calendar\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Caucuses and primaries in the 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n!Date\n!colspan=2|Totaldelegates\n!Primaries/caucuses\n|-\n|January 23\n|colspan=2|0\n|New Hampshire primary The early date violates the DNC-approved calendar, which confirmed South Carolina as the first primary state.}}\n|-\n|February 3\n|colspan=2|55\n|South Carolina primary\n|-\n|February 6\n|colspan=2|36\n|Nevada primary\n|-\n|February 27\n|colspan=2|117\n|Michigan primary\n|-\n|rowspan=17|March 5(Super Tuesday)\n|rowspan=17|1420\n|-\n|52\n|Alabama primary\n|-\n|6\n|American Samoa caucuses\n|-\n|31\n|Arkansas primary\n|-\n|424\n|California primary\n|-\n|72\n|Colorado primary\n|-\n|40\n|Iowa caucuses}}\n|-\n|-\n|24\n|Maine primary\n|-\n|92\n|Massachusetts primary\n|-\n|75\n|Minnesota primary\n|-\n|116\n|North Carolina primary\n|-\n|36\n|Oklahoma primary\n|-\n|63\n|Tennessee primary\n|-\n|244\n|Texas primary\n|-\n|30\n|Utah primary\n|-\n|16\n|Vermont primary\n|-\n|99\n|Virginia primary\n|-\n|March 6\n|colspan=2|22\n|Hawaii caucuses\n|-\n|rowspan=6|March 12\n|rowspan=6|254\n|-\n|13\n|Democrats Abroad primary\n|-\n||108\n|Georgia primary\n|-\n||35\n|Mississippi primary\n|-\n||6\n|Northern Marianas caucuses\n|-\n||92\n|Washington primary\n|-\n|rowspan=4|March 19\n|rowspan=4|379\n|72\n|Arizona primary\n|-\n||147\n|Illinois primary\n|-\n||33\n|Kansas primary\n|-\n||127\n|Ohio primary\n|-\n|rowspan=3|March 23\n|rowspan=3|112\n|-\n|48\n|Louisiana primary\n|-\n||64\n|Missouri primary\n|-\n|March 30\n|colspan=2|13\n|North Dakota primary\n|-\n|rowspan=5|April 2\n|rowspan=5|436\n|-\n|60\n|Connecticut primary\n|-\n||268\n|New York primary\n|-\n||26\n|Rhode Island primary\n|-\n||82\n|Wisconsin primary\n|-\n|rowspan=2|April 13\n|rowspan=2|28\n|15\n|Alaska caucuses\n|-\n|13\n|Wyoming caucuses\n|-\n|April 23\n|colspan=2|159\n|Pennsylvania primary\n|-\n|April 27\n|colspan=2|25\n|New Hampshire primary\n|-\n|April 28\n|colspan=2|55\n|Puerto Rico primary\n|-\n|May 7\n|colspan=2|79\n|Indiana primary\n|-\n|rowspan=4|May 14\n|rowspan=4|144\n|-\n|95\n|Maryland primary\n|-\n||29\n|Nebraska primary\n|-\n||20\n|West Virginia primary\n|-\n|rowspan=3|May 21\n|rowspan=3|119\n|-\n|53\n|Kentucky primary\n|-\n||66\n|Oregon primary\n|-\n|May 23\n|colspan=2|23\n|Idaho caucuses\n|-\n|rowspan=6|June 4\n|rowspan=6|216\n|-\n|20\n|Washington D.C. primary\n|-\n||20\n|Montana primary\n|-\n||126\n|New Jersey primary\n|-\n||34\n|New Mexico primary\n|-\n||16\n|South Dakota primary\n|-\n|rowspan=3|June 8\n|rowspan=3|14\n|-\n|7\n|Guam caucuses\n|-\n|7\n|Virgin Islands caucuses\n|-\n|}\n* Canceled: Florida (224 delegates), Delaware (19 delegates)\nBallot access\nTimeline\n2023\nFebruary 2023\nOn February 4, the Democratic National Committee approves a new primary calendar, moving South Carolina to February 3, followed by Nevada and New Hampshire on February 6, Georgia on February 13, and Michigan on February 27. Iowa, which traditionally goes first, would then be held later in the primary season. The DNC gives Georgia and New Hampshire an extended deadline of June to modify their state laws so they can comply with the new dates (New Hampshire state law mandates them to hold the first primary in the country, while Georgia state law requires them to hold both the Democratic and Republican primaries on the same day), but this remains unlikely to happen since both states have Republican-controlled state legislatures.\nMarch 2023\nOn March 3, the DNC declares their full support for President Biden's re-election, stating they do not plan to host any official debates.\nOn March 4, author Marianne Williamson announces her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination as the first major primary challenger to incumbent President Biden.\nApril 2023\nOn April 6, Robert F.

Perez was the last of the three members in the Blue Dog Coalition caucus's leadership, who publicly announced that they were not endorsing Harris for president.\nOn July 29, Marianne Williamson ends her candidacy for the third and final time.\nAugust 2024\nOn August 2, Vice President Kamala Harris earns a majority of delegate votes in the DNC roll call.\nOn August 3, the Minnesota Star Tribune reports that Phillips said, \"If people write anything, I just hope that they might write if [Biden] had debated me then and he had been on one stage, unscripted, with a national audience, and he demonstrated that decline then, this would have been very different circumstances.\" He continued, \"And that's what I was trying to do.\"\nOn August 4, twenty-nine Uncommitted delegates from eight states take part in a virtual roll call where they voted for Palestinian victims over Harris.\nOn August 5, delegate voting closed, and Vice President Kamala Harris becomes the official presidential nominee for the Democratic Party. 52 delegates voted abstained or voted against Harris, including Representative Mary Peltola, Representative Jared Golden, and Senator Jon Tester.\nOn August 6, Harris chooses Governor Tim Walz as her vice presidential running mate.\nOverview\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/01/2023 till:10/31/2024\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = gridcolor:lightline unit:month increment:1 start:01/01/2023\nScaleMajor = gridcolor:darkline unit:year increment:1 start:01/01/2023\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\nBarData =\nbar:Harris\nbar:Williamson\nbar:Biden\nbar:Palmer\nbar:Phillips\nbar:Kennedy\nPlotData=\nwidth:15 fontsize:S textcolor:black anchor:till shift:(10,-4)\nbar:Harris\nfrom:07/21/2024 till:08/22/2024  color: Active text:\"Harris\"\nbar:Williamson\nfrom:03/04/2023 till:02/07/2024 color:Withdrawn\nfrom:02/28/2024 till:06/11/2024 color:Withdrawn\nfrom:07/02/2024 till:07/29/2024 color:Withdrawn text:\"Williamson\"\nbar:Biden\nfrom:04/25/2023 till:07/21/2024 color: Withdrawn text:\"Biden\"\nbar:Phillips\nfrom:10/26/2023 till:03/06/2024 color:Withdrawn text:\"Phillips\"\nbar:Palmer\nfrom:10/22/2023 till:05/15/2024 color:Withdrawn text:\"Palmer\"\nbar:Kennedy\nfrom:04/19/2023 till:10/09/2023 color:Withdrawn text:\"Kennedy\"\nLineData=\nlayer:front at:01/23/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:02/03/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:02/06/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:02/27/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:03/05/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:03/12/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:03/19/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:03/23/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:04/02/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:04/06/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:04/13/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:04/23/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:04/28/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:05/07/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:05/14/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:05/21/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:05/23/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:06/04/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:06/08/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:08/19/2024 width:4 color:blue\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#0000F5;\"|\n| Active campaign\n| style=\"background:#FFFF00;\"|\n| Exploratory committee\n| style=\"background:blue;\" rowspan=2|\n|  rowspan=2|Democratic National Convention\n|-\n| style=\"background:#4C4CB2;\"|\n| Withdrawn candidate\n| style=\"background:#FF0000;\"|\n| Primaries\n|}\nEarly developments\nBiden declared his intent in January 2022 to run for re-election, keeping Kamala Harris as his running mate. On September 15, he told Scott Pelley in a CBS 60 Minutes interview that he had not yet committed to run. In a private conversation with civil-rights activist Al Sharpton on October 3, he reportedly told Sharpton that he was seeking re-election. On October 11, he told Jake Tapper in an interview on CNN that he would decide whether or not to seek re-election after the 2022 midterm elections.\nThroughout 2022, several prominent Democrats publicly urged Biden not to run for a second term. On June 23, shortly after winning the Democratic nomination in the South Carolina gubernatorial race, former U.S. Representative Joe Cunningham told CNN that he believed Biden would be too old by the end of his second term and should not run in 2024. CNN pointed out that Biden had endorsed Cunningham in his 2018 and 2020 campaigns. In July, U.S. Representative Dean Phillips of Minnesota said he believed that Democrats should nominate someone from a younger generation in 2024, and fellow Minnesota Representative Angie Craig agreed with him the following week. On August 1, then-U.S. Representative Carolyn Maloney told The New York Times that she thought Biden should not run in 2024 and that she believed he would not run. She later apologized and said that he should run again, though she reiterated her belief that he would not. In September, U.S. Representative and Ohio U.S. Senate nominee Tim Ryan similarly called for a \"generational move\" away from Biden during an interview with a local TV station; Forbes Magazine noted that Biden, who had endorsed Ryan, headlined a rally with him just hours after the interview aired.\nIn April 2023, Christale Spain became the first black woman to be the Chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party; with the responsibility of organizing the party's first-in-the-nation primary.\nFormat changes\nDemocrats in Idaho, who held caucuses in 2012 and 2016 but switched to a firehouse primary by mail for the 2020 election, switched back to in-person caucuses due to the abolition of the presidential primary by the Idaho Legislature in 2023. Similarly, the abolition of the state-run presidential primary in Missouri in 2022 caused Democrats in Missouri to switch to a closed, ranked-choice firehouse presidential primary for 2024.\nControversies\nPrimary schedule\nPresident Biden sent a letter on December 1, 2022, to the Democratic National Committee (DNC), requesting that diversity should be emphasized in the 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries. On February 4, 2023, the DNC formally approved the new 2024 primary calendar, moving South Carolina to hold its race first on February 3, followed by Nevada and New Hampshire on February 6. One member of the Rules and Bylaws Committee who supported this new plan, Lee Saunders, further said it will give a better representation of the composition of the country. Members of the Iowa Democratic Party and the New Hampshire Democratic Party opposed the move, since they would no longer be the first two states to hold their races. The move was also criticized by some progressives, who argued that the move was intended to benefit more moderate candidates. On October 6, the DNC and the Iowa Democratic Party reached a compromise in which the in-person caucuses could still be held in January, but delegate-determining mail-in voting would be held through Super Tuesday, March 5.\nThe DNC and the New Hampshire Democratic Party did not reach a compromise. In October 2023, the manager for the Biden campaign, Julie Chávez Rodriguez, confirmed in a letter to the chair of the New Hampshire Democratic Party Raymond Buckley that Biden would not appear on the primary ballot in order to comply with the DNC's calendar. Pro-Biden New Hampshire Democrats, including Kathy Sullivan (the former chairwoman of the state Democratic party) and former Representatives Paul Hodes and Carol Shea-Porter, launched a formal write-in campaign on October 30. There were no delegates at stake in the New Hampshire primary because the Democratic National Committee said state party officials violated national party rules by scheduling its contest earlier than allowed. On January 8, 2024, after the Democratic national party dismissed the state of New Hampshire's upcoming primary as \"meaningless\" the New Hampshire Assistant Attorney General Brendan O’Donnell fired off a cease-and-desist order to the DNC, saying that instructing state Democrats to \"educate the public\" that the primary is \"meaningless\" violates the state's voter suppression laws.\nBallot access denials\nThe primaries in Florida and Delaware were canceled, with Biden receiving all pledged delegates, while in Alaska, North Carolina, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Indiana, no candidates other than Biden appeared on the ballot, partially due to decisions by the state Democratic parties in those states. In Guam, voters could only cast ballots for individuals elected to serve as national convention delegates, all of whom were pledged to support Biden. The Phillips and Williamson campaigns criticized many of the decisions as undemocratic. The primary challengers had not received the necessary number of signatures in Tennessee and North Carolina, while the Florida Democratic Party stated that the challengers did not reach out to them until November 29, 2023, one day before the Florida Secretary of State's November 30 deadline to submit candidates, and the state party had already made its submission ahead of the deadline before November 29. An attorney who supported Phillips}} questioned why the state party did not contact the challengers when it made its submission ahead of the deadline. Andrew Yang who was assisting Phillips' cause told ABC News, \"What's happening in Florida is important -- do we live in a democracy or not? If the Democrats can simply cancel their own primaries they should change their name to something else.\" On February 2, the Wisconsin Supreme Court unanimously ruled that election officials must include Phillips on the presidential primary ballot in Wisconsin. Phillips won his lawsuit against State Justice Department attorneys representing the elections commission who were attempting to keep him off the ballot.\nBiden's participation\nDespite no incumbent president ever having participated in a primary season debate, a June 2023 poll by USA Today and Suffolk University found that 8 in 10 Democratic voters wanted to see Biden debate the other major Democratic candidates. Among Biden supporters, 72% said they would like to see him debate in the primaries with other major Democratic candidates. Despite all this, the DNC did not support hosting any official debates, and Biden did not participate in the 2024 Democratic Party presidential debates and forums unsanctioned by the DNC.\nChallengers having difficulties\nOn May 5, 2023, Symone Sanders, the former spokesperson for Vice President Kamala Harris,  stated on MSNBC: \"The Democratic National Committee will not facilitate a primary process [in 2024]. There will be no debate stage for Robert Kennedy or Marianne Williamson or anybody else.\"\nPhillips accused representatives of the Biden campaign of using access to pressure liberal media outlets into blackballing and not platforming him. The New York Times reported that during his campaign, Phillips \"found himself “deplatformed,” taken off the ballot in some states, and rarely invited on television to make his case.\" Phillips argued that the Democratic establishment was choking off his challenge because it couldn't accept that ‘Biden is going to get creamed’ by Trump in November. Phillips also accused the Democratic National Committee of actively obstructing Democrats and Independents from ballot access — \"bleeding campaigns dry\" by handing out lawsuits against non-incumbent candidates and \"absurd signature requirements.\" When asserting that his campaign was hampered by ballot access policies and a lack of candidate debates, Phillips issued an apology to Bernie Sanders. He regretted his previous disbelief in Sanders's 2016 campaign's complaints of biased rules by the DNC governing the presidential primary and admitted that he now thought Sanders was right.\nPhillips also argued that Democrats who had concerns about President Biden were \"suppressed and disenfranchised\" during the 2024 primaries. Phillips said that the DNC's letter stating that New Hampshire's presidential primary was 'meaningless' and not to seat any delegates to the convention based on the results was, \"one of the most egregious affronts to democracy that I’ve ever seen in my entire lifetime as an American, period.\" In a statement to Politico, Phillips called the handling of the primary process by the Florida Democratic Party a \"blatant act of electoral corruption\" and demanded Biden \"condemn and immediately address\" it. He also said \"Americans would expect the absence of democracy in Tehran, not Tallahassee. The intentional disenfranchisement of voters runs counter to everything for which our Democratic Party and country stand. Our mission as Democrats is to defeat authoritarians, not become them.\" During an appearance on Meet the Press NOW, Phillips criticized Biden's re-election effort, stating that \"The president is not a threat to democracy, but running and suppressing other candidates is a threat when you are behind in the polls, like he is.\" Phillips also added, \"He’s a good man and someone I respect. But this delusion that he can win is a threat to democracy.\"\nKennedy accused the Democratic Party of \"fixing the process so it makes it almost impossible to have democracy function\" and \"disenfranchising the Democratic voters from having any choice in who becomes the Democratic nominee.\"\nKennedy's campaign manager, former Ohio Democratic congressman Dennis Kucinich, accused the DNC of attempting a \"hidden-ball trick\" by not publicizing a public meeting of the Rules and Bylaws committee where resolutions dealing with ballot access and delegate selection rules for Georgia, Iowa, New Hampshire, and other states were expected to be presented. In a release, Kucinich said, \"The DNC wants to carry on without public and media attention.\"\nWilliamson accused the Democratic National Committee of trying to \"suppress\" her candidacy in favor of incumbent President Joe Biden.\nFormer Secretary of housing and urban development Julian Castro alleged on MSNBC that potential Democratic rivals and even staffers \"got the message\" that their careers would be \"blackballed\" if they challenged Biden in the 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries.\nProcess following Biden's withdrawal\nWith Biden out, on July 21, Phillips proposed a straw poll of delegates ahead of the Democratic National Convention to determine the party's top four presidential contenders. Those four candidates would then take part in four town halls outlining their plans for the White House. Then, after all those town halls, the delegates would vote to choose their candidate to determine the nominee.\nFollowing Biden's suspension of his campaign and subsequent endorsement of Kamala Harris on July 21, Williamson called for an open convention, arguing that the vice president should not be \"anointed to the position of nominee.\"\nOn July 23, Black Lives Matter released a statement opposing the party's decision to nominate Harris for president without her participating as a candidate in a primary election, describing the process as \"anointing\" Harris as the nominee without a public vote. The organization argued that installing Harris as the Democratic nominee without a primary vote undermined democratic principles, stating that such a move \"would make the modern Democratic Party a party of hypocrites.\" BLM called on the Democratic National Committee to host a virtual primary to allow voter participation in the nomination process.\nRepresentative Nancy Pelosi told Semafor on September 18 that Harris earned her spot atop the Democratic presidential ticket because \"We had an open primary, and she won it. Nobody else got in the race.\" However, in the aftermath of the presidential election, Pelosi blamed Harris's loss on Biden's late exit and the lack of an open Democratic primary.\nDebates and forums\nOn December 6, 2023, TYT Network hosted a forum featuring primary candidates Williamson, Phillips and Uygur. Biden was invited but declined to attend. The candidates responded to the GOP debate being held in Tuscaloosa, which was scheduled to end at the same time. The discussion was moderated by John Iadarola, the main host of The Damage Report on the same network.\nOn January 8, 2024, Williamson and Phillips participated in a debate hosted by New England College in Manchester, New Hampshire. To qualify, candidates needed to be registered on the New Hampshire primary ballot and poll at more than five percent. The debate was broadcast on satellite radio by Sirius XM and was moderated by Josh McElveen, who was the former political director of WMUR.\nOn January 12, 2024, NewsNation hosted a second forum featuring Williamson, Phillips and Uygur. Biden was invited but did not attend. The discussion was moderated by Dan Abrams.\nOn January 18, 2024, Free & Equal Elections Foundation hosted a debate at Chelsea Television Studios in New York City. The debate was originally planned to be held in Los Angeles. Christina Tobin moderated the debate.\nAll candidates registered for the ballot \"in at least four states\" were invited: Biden, Phillips, Williamson, Uygur, Gabriel Cornejo, Stephen Lyons, Jason Palmer, and Frank Lozada. However, only the latter four candidates chose to participate.\nOn January 19, 2024, Phillips and Williamson were part of a forum held at the Artisan Hotel in Tuscan Village, Salem, New Hampshire. It was hosted by the Rotary Club and the Southern New Hampshire Chamber of Commerce.\nEndorsements\n}}\n}}\n(later endorsed Biden)\n;Notable individuals\n* Bill Ackman, Pershing Square Capital Management CEO\n* Jason Calacanis, angel investor and podcaster\n*Neal Khosla, son of Vinod Khosla and CEO of Curai Health\n*Jed McCaleb, entrepreneur and philanthropist\n*Michael Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Investment Partners\n* Steve Schmidt, political and corporate strategist (campaign advisor)\n* Jeffrey P.

Totals raised include individual contributions, loans from the candidate, and transfers from other campaign committees. Individual contributions are itemized (catalogued) by the FEC when the total value of contributions by an individual comes to more than $200. The last column, Cash On Hand, shows the remaining cash each campaign had available for its future spending as of December 31, 2023. Campaign finance reports for the first quarter of 2024 will become available on April 15, 2024.\nThis table does not include contributions made to Super PACs or party committees supporting the candidate.
