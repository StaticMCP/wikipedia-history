Historian David Glantz described it as part of a failed Soviet offensive in Romania, and considered it a reaction to the Soviet defeat at the First Battle of Târgu Frumos. While according to the Soviet account, the Red Army successfully repelled a German counter-stroke, according to German accounts, the Germans managed to drive the attacking Soviets back to the positions they held before the battle.\nAftermath\nThe region was still in Axis hands. Several months later, it was captured by the Red Army in the Jassy–Kishinev Offensive, from 21–23 August 1944.\nNotes\nExplanatory notes\nFootnotes\nReferences\n*\n}}\n\n---\n\n## Battle of podu iloaiei\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Podu Iloaiei"
