It is situated in the Freer Gallery of Art.\nIt depicts the emperor, seated upon a throne in the form of an hourglass, handing a book to a Sufi saint, while the Ottoman sultan and the king of England look on. The artist Bichitr himself is pictured in the bottom-left corner of the image, in a self-insert.\nDescription\n|left]]\nThe emperor Jahangir is depicted wearing a jama, with a halo around his face combining the imagery of the sun and the crescent moon. He is slightly larger than the other figures, in accordance with hierarchical proportion.\nHe is seated on a throne shaped like a European hourglass. The hourglass can be interpreted as a reference to the second Islamic millennium, which began in 1591-2, some time before Jahangir's accession to the throne in 1605. On the hourglass, a Persian inscription reads, \"God is great. O Shah, may the span of your reign be a thousand years\". This might indicate that the painting was presented to the emperor on his birthday.\nJahangir is seen offering a book to a bearded Sufi saint. The saint is Shaikh Hussain, a descendant of the revered Mu’in al-Din Chishti. The other men before him are the Ottoman sultan, the king of England and Scotland James VI and I, and the artist Bichitr himself. The depiction of the Ottoman sultan, which seems to be a general type rather than any specific portrait, draws from a work by Giovanni Bellini, and the depiction of James VI and I is taken from a work by John de Critz, brought to India by the English ambassador Thomas Roe.\nIn the bottom-left corner of the image is the artist Bichitr. He is portrayed wearing a Hindu-styled robe, and holding up a painting. Stuart C. Welch interprets this painting to be of Bichitr himself bowing to the emperor. This self-insertion as a sort of signature, became a custom in Mughal painting in the coming years.\nThe painting signifies Jahangir's reverence towards the saint, spurning the great monarchs vying for his audience. Even his love for art fails to distract him from the spiritual, as even the artist Bichitr in the bottom-left fails to get his attention. Its dating coincides with the period when he shifted the capital to the holy city of Ajmer from 1613 to 1616.\nA Venetian-styled carpet constitutes the lower half of the background, while the upper half is sky blue. Four putti are seen in the picture. Two of them are at the bottom of the hourglass, gathering the sand which has fallen into the bottom half, while two are flying in the background.\nTwo Persian couplets are inscribed above and below the painting, reading, \"By the grace of God is he truly a king both in form and spirit: the Shah Nur-ud Din Jahangir, son of Padshah Akbar; To all appearances, even as kings and potentates stand in attendance upon him, his gaze falls, inwardly, ever upon holy dervishes.\" These couplets, along with the border, are later additions.\nReferences"
