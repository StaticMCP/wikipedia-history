It is also the first and only polytechnic in Singapore to use the problem-based learning (PBL) pedagogy for all of its programs.\nUnder the problem-based learning (PBL) pedagogy, RP students will typically receive a problem statement from their lecturers at the start of each day before exploring the solutions to the problem in a group of three to five, and presenting the final solution to the class—where students will receive feedback from their lecturers and classmates.\nRP's alumni include seven-time Paralympic gold medalist Yip Pin Xiu, 2021 BWF World Championships gold medalist Loh Kean Yew, sprinter Shanti Pereira, and Benjamin Kheng of The Sam Willows.\nHistory\nRepublic Polytechnic was established in July 2002. First located at the former Ministry of Education headquarters at Tanglin, the polytechnic was established as a statutory board a month later. The polytechnic admitted its pioneer batch of students in July 2003 across three schools, Applied Science, Engineering and Information and Communications (now Infocomm). In 2005, the polytechnic opened two new schools, Technology for the Arts and Sports, Health and Leisure.\nConstruction of the new campus in Woodlands was completed in stages. The Republic Polytechnic Centre was opened in November 2005 by Tharman Shanmugaratnam who was the Minister for Education. In March 2006, the polytechnic officially moved to its Woodlands campus and was declared officially open by Lee Hsien Loong the Prime Minister in July 2007.\nIn March 2008, the polytechnic opened a fifth school, the School of Hospitality, to support the growing hospitality sector. In 2012, the polytechnic renamed the Centre for Professional Development as the Academy for Continuing Education @ RP and launched its first part-time diploma. That same year witnessed the launch of the Centre for Enterprise and Communication (later renamed as the School of Management and Communication in 2016) and an aerospace training facility, The Aerospace Hub.\nThe Centre of Innovation for Supply Chain Management (COI-SCM) was launched in 2013 and this was followed by an Aquaculture Centre in 2014. In 2016, the Republic Polytechnic Industry Centre was launched to deepen industry collaboration and support upskilling for individuals, housing a suite of laboratories and experiential learning facilities under one roof.\nThe polytechnic opened the Republic Polytechnic Academy for Continuing Education @ Paya Lebar (RP ACE @ Paya Lebar) in November 2018 to bring its Continuing Education and Training (CET) courses closer to the public. and launched Singapore's first-ever SkillsFuture Work-Study Programme where students worked full-time with participating companies and took classes towards obtaining a part-time diploma.\n2019 saw the polytechnic opening an agriculture technology laboratory that features urban farming facilities and the launch of a part-time Diploma in Applied Science (Urban Agricultural Technology).

Following his retirement, Jeanne Liew was appointed as the new Principal & CEO by the board of governors.\nIn October 2024, Republic Polytechnic revamped its curriculum and introduced the \"[https://www.rp.edu.sg/greater-me Becoming Greater Me]\" framework, for students joining the polytechnic from Academic Year 2025. This framework is designed to help students discover their purpose by aligning their passions with both their academic and life pursuits. Anchored in the discovery of purpose, the new framework provides more opportunities for specialised learning, community engagement, and personal development. The polytechnic also implemented the [https://www.rp.edu.sg/designing-your-life \"Designing Your Life\" (DYL)] concept, developed by Stanford University professors Bill Burnett and Dave Evans. This five-year student journey aims to empower students to pursue their life and career goals with intention and clarity.\nThe revamped curriculum also offers versatility by allowing students to design and pursue their own learning pathways. Students can enrol in a broad-based diploma across all academic schools and select their major and minor subjects in their second year.

Each year, final-year students are placed on internship with over 1,800 industry partners. The duration ranges from 10 to 14 weeks and is an integral part of the diploma programme. Some students have also pursued their internships overseas during their final-year of study at RP - which include Australia, China, Indonesia, Myanmar, the United States and New Zealand.\nRP's Continuing Education and Training (CET) is a learning arm for upskilling and lifelong learning.

The campus was designed by Japanese architect, Fumihiko Maki, and DP Architects. Completed in 2006, the new campus is able to cater 13,000 students. It is conceived as a campus with a central nucleus which contains 11 learning Pods (8–9 storeys high) which are unified by 2 elliptical decks of common facilities, namely The Lawn and The Agora.\nAlso known as a Paperless Campus, RP's Woodlands campus is backed by IT-supported network for both academic and administrative functions. Features such as fritted glasses, flooring made from recycled nylon and tyres, and sunshade louvres were integrated in the building design. Instead of the conventional air-conditioning system, the campus is equipped with tanks containing chilled water, which are recharged at night using low tariff electricity. This significantly reduces overall electric consumption.\nIn 2008, RP earned the ASEAN Best Practices for Energy Efficient Buildings Competition under the New and Existing Buildings category. RP was also honoured with the President's Design Award in 2009. The campus was also the first to win the First-ever Singapore Green Mark Plantinum award for its eco friendly design.\nFacilities\n* Republic Polytechnic Industry Centre (RPIC) – The RPIC is a six-storey building that houses laboratories and learning facilities to support research, innovation and enterprise across a range of industries that include food manufacturing, hospitality, advance manufacturing and logistics, among others.\n* The Republic Cultural Centre (TRCC) – Designed by Maki & Associates, TRCC has three main performing arts venues: a) 1,000-seat Theatre, b) 300-seat Studio and, c) 120-seat Lab.
