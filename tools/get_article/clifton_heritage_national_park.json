It is managed by the Clifton Heritage Authority and has an area of 208 acres. Notable as tribute to the cultural history of the Bahamas, it was established as a protected area in June 2004 and opened to the public in April 2009.\nHistory and culture\nClifton was originally inhabited by the indigenous Lucayans, and archaeological evidence of their presence dates back to 1100 AD. It was later occupied by buccaneers and freebooters. It became the site of a Loyalist plantation in the late 18th century, characterised as being remote from the hustle and bustle of Nassau. The great house was built by John Wood in 1788. The original architecture resembled that of Louisiana and South Carolina. It was later owned by William Wylly (or Whylly).\nOne of the ruins on the property is reportedly a tavern that was in use until the 1960s.\nLaurie Wilkes of the University of California, Berkeley and Paul Farnsworth of Louisiana State University carried out archaeological investigations of the site in the 1990s. They were primarily interested in uncovering the slave quarters, home to as many as 67 slaves. They also found evidence of pre-Loyalist inhabitation by the Lucayans and during the Conch Period.\nIn 2000, there were plans to bulldoze and develop the site into a gated community with a golf course. This idea was met with strong opposition from locals and those who wished to preserve Clifton's history, thus the plans fell through. It was established as public protected land in 2004. In 2006, the Clifton Heritage Authority and the Florida Museum of Natural History conducted an expedition to further investigate the Lucayan sites found, which turned out to be one large site.\nHistoric and archaeological sites:\n*Great House, now a ruin\n*Carriage House, which was originally used as a stable and store house and is now used as the gift shop\n*Slave village\n*Pirate Steps\nArt and monuments:\n* The Sacred Space, also known as the Genesis Garden, was created in a joint effort by Bahamian artists Antonius Roberts and Tyrone Ferguson.
