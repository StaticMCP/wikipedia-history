I never got over it . . . as an incomplete but indelible image of good public life\" (p.&nbsp;411).\nA \"soundtrack\" to Lipstick Traces, compiling many of the songs referenced in the book, was released by Rough Trade Records in 1993.\nThe name \"Lipstick Traces\" can be traced to the 1962 Benny Spellman song “Lipstick Traces (on a Cigarette)” [http://www.ubu.com/sound/lipstick.html]\nIn 1999, the book was adapted into a stage production by Rude Mechanicals (a.k.a. Rude Mechs) of Austin, TX.  The play has been performed all across the United States- including a stint Off-Broadway in 2001- and in Salzburg, Austria.  In 2005, the play was invited to join the New York Public Library's Dramatic Literature Archive.\nThe book also provided inspiration for the name of a compilation album of B-sides by the Welsh rock group Manic Street Preachers, entitled Lipstick Traces (A Secret History of Manic Street Preachers).\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674034808 Harvard University Press: Lipstick Traces]; publisher's site\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061019211608/http://www.rudemechs.com/shows/history/lipstick.htm Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the 20th Century]; a play created by [http://www.rudemechs.com \"Rude Mechs\"] in Austin, Texas (2000)\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=TVAoeipLL38C Preview] at Google books"
