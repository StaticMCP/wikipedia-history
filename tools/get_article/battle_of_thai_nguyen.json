The battle lasted from 17 to 25 August 1945.\nBattle\nOn 16 August 1945, the Viet Minh forces led by Võ Nguyên Giáp entered Thái Nguyên.\nDuring the battle itself, only sporadic fighting broke out, as a small group of Japanese army was situated in an old French fort and the Americans were all, except for Major Thomas, away from the battle in an outside safehouse. On 25 August the final battle at Thái Nguyên ended with the Japanese \"surrendering\" agreeing to stay confined to their post, the same day the Empire of Vietnam (Japan's puppet) collapsed when its emperor Bảo Đại abdicated. The government apparatus of the Empire of Vietnam in Thái Nguyên collapsed and its soldiers (lính bảo an) here automatically surrendered to the Viet Minh, and the Viet Minh established a government in this province on 28 August 1945.\nAccording to Thomas, the battle resulted in the deaths of six Japanese, three Viet Minh fighters and five civilians. After the battle, the Viet Minh (de facto led by communists) completely seized Thái Nguyên when Giáp founded the People's Revolutionary Committee in the province.\nSee also\n* People's Army of Vietnam\n* First Indochina War\n* Sino-Vietnamese conflicts (1945-1946)\nReferences"
