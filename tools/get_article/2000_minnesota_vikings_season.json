      "text": "# 2000 Minnesota Vikings season\n\nThe 2000 season was the Minnesota Vikings' 40th in the National Football League (NFL). They won the NFC Central division title with an 11–5 record. After not retaining either Randall Cunningham or Jeff George, the team was led by first-year starting quarterback Daunte Culpepper and running back Robert Smith, who ran for a then team record 1,521 yards and seven touchdowns. The Vikings started out 7–0 and were 11–2 after 14 weeks, but slumped briefly, losing their last three to the St. Louis Rams, Green Bay Packers and Indianapolis Colts while Culpepper was hampered by injury.\nAfter easily beating the New Orleans Saints in the Divisional game 34–16, they were defeated 41–0 by the New York Giants in the Conference Championship. Running back Robert Smith retired at the end of the year, after only playing eight NFL seasons. It would be 2004 before the Vikings returned to the playoffs.\nAfter a contract dispute, Hall of Fame defensive tackle John Randle was let go after 11 seasons with the Vikings. Randle had only eight sacks this year, ending a streak of eight consecutive seasons with 10+ sacks.\nSeven Vikings including Culpepper, Moss, Carter, Smith, Korey Stringer, Robert Griffith and Matt Birk were selected to play in the Pro Bowl after the season. It was Stringer's only Pro Bowl appearance before his death in 2001.\nThis would be the final full season for Dennis Green as the team's head coach, he was fired the next season with just one game remaining on the schedule.\nOffseason\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Additions || Subtractions\n|-\n|T Brad Badger (Redskins) || QB Randall Cunningham (Cowboys)\n|-\n|QB Bubby Brister (Broncos) || QB Jeff George (Redskins)\n|-\n|TE Johnny McWilliams (Cardinals) || TE Andrew Glover (Saints)\n|-\n|DE Bryce Paup (Jaguars) || G Randall McDaniel (Buccaneers)\n|-\n|LB Craig Sauer (Falcons) || C Jeff Christy (Buccaneers)\n|-\n|CB Cris Dishman (Chiefs) || WR Jake Reed (Saints)\n|-\n|LB Lemanski Hall (Cowboys) || DE Duane Clemons (Chiefs)\n|-\n| || CB Jimmy Hitchcock (Panthers)\n|-\n| || LB Rob Holmberg (Patriots)\n|}\n2000 draft\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"6\" style=\"\"| 2000 Minnesota Vikings Draft\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Draft order\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Player name\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Position\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| College\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Notes\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Round\n!style=\"\"| Selection\n|-\n!1!!25\n|Chris Hovan||Defensive tackle||Boston College||\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|2!!55\n|Fred Robbins||Defensive tackle||Wake Forest||\n|-\n!56\n|Michael Boireau||Defensive end||Miami (FL)||From Redskins\n|-\n!3!!88\n|Doug Chapman||Running back||Marshall||\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|4!!106\n|Antonio Wilson||Linebacker||Texas A&M||From Ravens\n|-\n!118\n|Tyrone Carter||Safety||Minnesota||\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|5!!155\n|colspan=\"3\"|Surrendered to the Washington Redskins||\n|-\n!165\n|Troy Walters||Wide receiver||Stanford||Compensatory pick\n|-\n!6!!191\n|colspan=\"3\"|Traded to the Baltimore Ravens||\n|-\n!rowspan=\"4\"|7!!232\n|colspan=\"3\"|Traded to the Cleveland Browns||\n|-\n!240\n|Mike Malano||Center||San Diego State||Compensatory pick\n|-\n!244\n|Giles Cole||Tight end||Texas||Compensatory pick\n|-\n!248\n|Lewis Kelly||Guard||South Carolina State||Compensatory pick\n|}\nNotes:\nUndrafted free agents\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ 2000 undrafted free agents of note\n!Player\n!Position\n!College\n|-\n|Billy Cockerham\n|Quarterback\n|Minnesota\n|-\n|Andy Crosland\n|Kicker\n|Miami (FL)\n|-\n|Tim Engelhardt\n|Defensive tackle\n|New Mexico State\n|-\n|Brody Liddiard\n|Tight end\n|Colorado\n|-\n|Lenny Lucas\n|Fullback\n|Troy State\n|-\n|Matt Wilson\n|Wide receiver\n|Bloomsburg\n|-\n|Antwone Young\n|Fullback\n|San Diego State\n|}\nStaff\nRoster\n|Running Backs=\n|Wide Receivers=\n|Tight Ends=\n|Offensive Linemen=\n|Defensive Linemen=\n|Linebackers=\n|Defensive Backs=\n|Special Teams=\n|Reserve Lists=\n|Practice Squad=\n}}\nPreseason\nSchedule\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
