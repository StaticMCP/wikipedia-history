All 95 seats in the Legislative Assembly were up for election, though 13 were uncontested.\nThis was the first election contested by the Labour Party, which was led by William Trenwith.\nBackground\nIn February 1892, Premier James Munro, who was deeply in debt, asked his Cabinet to appoint him Victorian Agent-General in London. He then resigned as Premier and immediately took ship from Port Melbourne.\nThe Liberals turned to William Shiels as a \"clean\" new leader, and he became the new Premier on 16 February 1892.\nResults\n13 seats were uncontested at this election, and therefore retained by the incumbent member:\n*Liberal: Ararat, Clunes and Allandale, Daylesford, Donald and Swan Hill, Gippsland East, Gippsland North, Numurkah and Nathalia, Warrenheip, Warrnambool (9)\n* Conservative: Bourke West, Evelyn, Melbourne, Portland (4)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; margin-bottom:0\"\n|+ Legislative Assembly (FPTP)\n! style=\"width:10px;\" colspan=3 | Party\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Votes\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| %\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Swing\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Seats\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Change\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"2\"| Liberal\n| style=\"width:70px;\"| 102,010\n| style=\"width:40px;\"| 52.91\n| style=\"width:45px;\"|\n| style=\"width:40px;\"| 56\n| style=\"width:55px;\"|\n|-\n| | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"2\"| Conservative\n| 52,260\n| 27.11\n|\n| 28\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"2\"| Labour\n| style=\"width:70px;\"| 37,777\n| style=\"width:40px;\"| 19.72\n| style=\"width:45px;\"| +19.72\n| style=\"width:40px;\"| 11\n| style=\"width:55px;\"|  11\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"2\"| Independent\n| style=\"width:70px;\"| 280\n| style=\"width:40px;\"| 0.15\n| style=\"width:45px;\"|\n| style=\"width:40px;\"| 0\n| style=\"width:55px;\"|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"2\"| Independent Labour\n| style=\"width:70px;\"| 205\n| style=\"width:40px;\"| 0.11\n| style=\"width:45px;\"|\n| style=\"width:40px;\"| 0\n| style=\"width:55px;\"|\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\"| &nbsp;Formal votes\n| 192,792\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nAftermath\nThe Shiels government was defeated on a vote of confidence on 18 January 1893, and was succeeded by Conservative James Patterson. Patterson himself was defeated on a vote of confidence on 28 August 1894, and sought a dissolution of the house. The Liberals returned to government in 1894, led by George Turner.\nReferences"
