The stop opened on 27 January 2014. It is built on the site of the former King Street Baptist Church, which occupied the site from 1862 to 2005.  The site was acquired by Compulsory Purchase Order in 2005, and the Church was rebuilt nearby in Chaucer Street with the compensation it received.  A plaque, acknowledging this, on a stone pillar from the original church stands on the corner of the site.\nService pattern\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://tfgm.com/public-transport/tram/stops/oldham-king-street-tram Metrolink stop information]\n*[https://tfgm.com/public-transport/tram/stops/oldham-king-street-tram/local-map Oldham King Street area map]"
