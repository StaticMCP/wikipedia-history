The song is the third single from their seventh studio album, One More Light and was released on July 25, 2017. The music video was released on July 20, 2017, the same day that Linkin Park's lead vocalist, Chester Bennington, was found dead by suicide. It is Chester Bennington's first posthumously released single.\nMusic video\nThe music video, which features footage of the band performing at various places and rehearsing, was edited and directed by Mark Fiore. It was released several hours before Chester Bennington was confirmed dead.\nThe music video reached over 10.1 million views on YouTube in one day, making it one of the most viewed online videos in the first 24 hours. The official video uploaded to Linkin Park's YouTube channel on July 20, 2017, was shorter than the previously released audio-only video and the video released to other sites such as Vevo; it was later fixed to play the full song, with the last shot being of Bennington in a vehicle looking out at a window.\nAs of September 2024, the music video for \"Talking to Myself\" has over 150 million views on YouTube.\nCritical reception\nThe song received mixed reviews from critics. Ian Gittins of The Guardian called it \"a sleek Justin Bieber-style pop-R&B nugget\". Allison Stewart of The Washington Post stated, \"the electro-poppy 'Talking to Myself' sounds like the work of a '90s boy band\". In a negative review, Anita Bhagwandas of NME commented that the song \"is full of unsophisticated hooks and forgettable melodies\". Jon Pareles of The New York Times described it as \"a pounding plaint about loneliness, alienation and 'all the walls that you keep building.\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Weekly chart performance for \"Talking to Myself\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017–18)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| France (SNEP)\n| 181\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Philippines (Philippine Hot 100)\n| 18\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| UK Audio Streaming (OCC)\n| 50\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Year-end chart performance for \"Talking to Myself\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Hungary (Rádiós Top 40)\n| 91\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Hungary (Single Top 40)\n| 67\n|}\nReferences"
