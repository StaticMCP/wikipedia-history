The town and parish contain over 360 listed buildings that are recorded in the National Heritage List for England.  Of these, four are listed at Grade&nbsp;I, the highest of the three grades, eleven are at Grade&nbsp;II*, the middle grade, and the others are at Grade&nbsp;II, the lowest grade.  The history of the town is reflected in its buildings, from the remains of the 12th-century castle, through a number of surviving timber framed  buildings, to the many Georgian buildings of the 18th&nbsp;century.  In the 15th and 16th&nbsp;centuries, wool merchants thrived in the town, followed by drapers, mercers and cloth merchants.  By the 18th&nbsp;century, the town was an important staging post on the Great North Road.  The town is on the River Trent, which was partly canalised in the late 18th&nbsp;century, encouraging industries including malting, brewing and engineering.\nMost of the listed buildings are houses and associated structures, shops and offices.  To the north of the town, the Great North Road is carried on a causeway including listed arches, culverts and a viaduct.  The other listed buildings include the remains of the castle, churches and chapels, public houses and hotels, a market cross, schools, warehouses, civic buildings, bridges, former maltings, breweries, a water pump and trough, cemetery buildings, railway buildings, banks, a drinking fountain, a war memorial and telephone kiosks.\n__NOTOC__\nKey\n{| class=\"wikitable\n|-\n!

There are three storeys and fronts of three and six bays.  In the ground floor is a modern shop front.  In the upper floors, the bays are divided by paired giant Ionic pilasters, and the recesses between contain a cross-casement window, above which is a French window with a wrought iron balcony.  The outer bays contain a slim casement window in each floor.\n|align=\"center\" |\n|-\n|Pair of telephone kiosks (northwest)\n|\n|align=\"center\"|1935\n|The K6 type telephone kiosk in Market Place were designed by Giles Gilbert Scott.
