Bush won by taking all the delegate votes, no other candidates appeared in the caucus.\nProcedure\nAmerican Samoa can only participate in Democratic and Republican primaries and caucuses and cannot participate in the presidential election because it is a U.S. territory and not a state, is it also illegal to take delegate votes from Electoral College votes like other territories.\nCandidates\nThere was only one candidate in here, Texas Governor George W. Bush.\nResults\nTexas Governor George W. Bush was the only one on the ballot, so he took all the delegates without popular vote, no candidate was in the ballot.\nSee also\n* 2000 United States presidential election\n* 2000 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n* 2000 United States elections\n* Elections in American Samoa\n* 2000 American Samoa Democratic presidential caucuses\n* 2000 American Samoa presidential caucuses\nReferences"
