Spicemania was at its height in the UK and the Spice Girls had just cracked the US as well, reaching number 1 with their debut single and album. Geri Halliwell captured the zeitgeist and became pin-up girl for Cool Britannia.\nHalliwell was originally going to wear an all-black dress, but she thought it was too boring so her sister sewed on a Union Jack tea-towel, with a 'peace' sign on the back, so as to not offend anyone. It was worn during the Spice Girls' performance of their number one song \"Who Do You Think You Are\". Later on she sold her dress in a charity auction to Hard Rock Cafe in Las Vegas for a record £41,320, giving Halliwell the Guinness World Record for the most expensive piece of pop star clothing ever sold. The performance won Most Memorable Performance Of 30 Years at the 2010 Brit Awards.\nAs well her famous Union Jack dress; Geri Halliwell wore a lengthy cut top red dress during the show. When walking up to the stage to collect their award; Geri Halliwell's right breast slipped out from her dress in front of cameras and host Ben Elton.\nMelanie C and Liam Gallagher\nBefore the ceremony, Oasis member Liam Gallagher told British media that he wasn't going to the Brit Awards because if he bumped into the Spice Girls, he would \"smack them\". During the group's acceptance speech for Best British Single, Sporty Spice Mel C responded to Gallagher, saying, \"Come and have a go if you think you're hard enough\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/1997 Brit Awards 1997 at Brits.co.uk]"
