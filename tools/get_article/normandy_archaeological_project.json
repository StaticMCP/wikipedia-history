After the construction of the dam, historic information about that area could not be accessed, so prior to the construction of the dam, as much research as possible had to be done on the area. This salvage effort was conducted in the Duck River Valley area, of middle Tennessee from March 1971 until the summer of 1975, prior to the completion of the dam in 1976. The fieldwork was done mainly by researchers from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, under contract to the Tennessee Valley Authority Contract and National Park. The dam creating the Normandy Reservoir was built on the Duck River at mile marker 248.6 in Coffee and Bedford County, Tennessee, named after the town of Normandy, Tennessee. The two nearest cities are Manchester and Tullahoma.\nLarge excavation projects need time for full evaluation of the project area in order to determine the relationship of the findings and obtain usable information through focusing on the hypothesis. In this way a wide view of the area and the time space within it was obtained. This large project also allowed a rare opportunity for young archaeologists to receive field training on a site soon to become forever inaccessible. The fieldwork on the Normandy project began with an investigation of surface collections to ascertain the intensity of prehistoric occupation in this portion of the valley. The sites were then mapped, with assistance from local collectors and the Coffee-Franklin County Chapter of the Tennessee Archaeological Society. Eighty three archaeological sites were found in the general project area twenty eight of which were determined to be out of the range of the maximum pool stage of the reservoir although still in danger of damage from development. Sixty-nine of the sites had previously been discovered prior to the excavations in the reservoir. Thirty of these sites were found by members of the Coffee-Franklin County Chapter of the Tennessee Archaeological Society. Although previous sites had been surveyed, the surrounding uplands were most often not included. Those typological areas are included in this project in an attempt to gain a better analysis of the patterns of culture and history of the ancient peoples of the Duck Valley.\nHistory\nPrehistoric environment\nThe Upper Duck Valley lies between the Highland Rim and the Nashville Basin in central Tennessee. The valley floor of the area lies in the basin while the rim of the valley is the highland. The Normandy Reservoir was to be built over these landscape formations. Each of these two areas were segmented into four different environmental zones; The floodplain, older alluvial terrace, valley slopes and bluffs, and uplands. Previous studies and information indicated large prehistoric sites were present in this area.\nThe subtropical climate of the area is characterized by hot summers and mild winters with the most rainfall occurring during the winter and spring, creating heavy stream flow in the Duck River from November to May.\nThe project area has four bio geographic zones: Flood Plain Zone, Older Alluvial Terrace Zone, Valley Slopes and Bluff Zone, and the Upland Zone. Each zone has varying vegetation and flood patterns. Since prehistoric settlement in the area was determined, in part, by the availability of natural resources it was assumed that by examining the sites and materials found in each zone one could determine habitation and subsistence patterns in the Duck Valley area for the native inhabitants. Major occupations were found spanning the period from the Late Archaic, through the Mississippian periods. Many of the earlier sites, dating to the late Pleistocene/early Holocene, were covered by later occupations. During the Middle Archaic period (c. 4000-6000 BC), larger sites appeared, with locations again guided by environmental factors, as was the case throughout prehistory.\nAgriculture and resources\nLithic resources\nLithics found in the greatest abundance in the Duck Valley included: cryptocrystalline quartz, blue-grey and tan chert, gray banded chert, fossiliferous chert, limestone, shale, mudstone, siltstone, and sandstone. Large quantities of chert artifacts were found indicating the importance of chert as a resource for tool making.\nSome lithic resources found in the reservoir are thought to have been derived locally, although there were also exotic materials present. These were most likely obtained through trade with peoples in the surrounding region. Some of the exotic materials included: cryptocrystalline quartz, blue-green nodular chert, Dover chert, novaculite, quartz, vein quartz, chalcedony, Horse Mountain agate, sandstone, hematite, steatite, slate, green slate, banded slate and igneous rock. These materials are, in some cases long distances from their source. Some came from as far away as the Great Lakes. This suggests that the groups of the upper Duck Valley were not secluded, but were instead active participants in established trade with other distant groups. The amount of lithic material suggests repeated use of the area over time, and was most frequently used during the Early Archaic and Late Archaic/Early Woodland periods.\nEscalation of increased contact with other groups throughout the Mid-South is suggested by the occurrence of steatite and Dover chert at the Banks I and Banks II sites indicating inter-regional trade in the Upper Duck Valley by 1000 BC.\nThe project was reported in a number of volumes written by Dr. Charles Faulkner and Major C.R. McCollough, the project directors.\nFaunal resources\nThe prehistoric Indians of the Duck Valley region could have utilized the rich faunal resources available. There are at least three hundred and three vertebrates, excluding fish, which were available. Mollusk species, many still present in the Duck River today, could have also been integrated into their subsistence system. One hundred seven species of fish were available in the Duck River. Turtles, alligators, turkey, owls, quail, waterfowl, deer, raccoon, gray fox, red fox, mink, muskrat, woodchuck, squirrel, opossum, eastern cottontail, and otter are some of the primary animal species available. Some large mammals that were without doubt utilized by these populations included elk, mountain lion, black bear, gray wolf, white-tailed deer, and bison. The white-tail remained as the most commonly used source of meat and very constant in the diet of the Duck River Valley inhabitants.\nFloral resources\nThe Duck Valley is a transitional zone between the Western and Mixed Mesophytic forests of the highland rim and Nashville Basin. The inhabitants of this area would have had ample natural resources at their disposal. The plant resources available in this region are closely tied to soil topography and climate. The types of plant resources dominant in the Nashville Basin are as follows:\nZones\nArchaeological sites in the Flood Plain Zone\nAlong the river, waterfowl, birds, fish, turtles, aquatic mammals and mollusk could all be utilized. Spring, early summer, late summer, and early fall would have been the most productive time for exploiting the resources of this region. Although resources may have been sparse in the winter months food would have still been available because of the variety of wildlife in this zone. Five sites have been recorded in this zone Although artifacts were found in this zone no well defined early assemblages were recovered. The rich biodiversity, fertile soil and available lithic resources made this area perhaps the most attractive zone to prehistoric inhabitants.\nArchaeological sites in the Older Alluvial Terrace Zone\nThe large number of sites (n-64) found at the older alluvial terrace is due to the topography of the area, since there were not many animal resources available in this zone. In the closed canopy the only mammal that would find this zone attractive would be the raccoon. Spring would be the most productive time for this zone.\nArchaeological sites in the Valley Slopes and Bluff Zone\nSpring, late summer, early summer, and fall would be the time of maximum productivity in this area. Only two sites documented in these zones.\nArchaeological sites in the Upland Zone\nLate summer, early fall and fall would be a productive time for this region. Fourteen sites were found at this zone.\n*Later discovered sites: Shelton Quarry 40BD80, Eoff IV 40CF119\nArchaeology\nSurvey of the Normandy Reservoir\nThe fieldwork in Normandy project began with an investigation of surface collections to ascertain the intensity of prehistoric occupation in this portion of the valley. The excavation was to take place between the years of 1971 to 1976. Each season would provide segmenting markers for the excavation. A volume of work was published following each complete seasonal cycle including some additional publications. The area of the Normandy project was naturally divided into two areas. The Upper Rim and the Nashville Basin, both of which were divided again for the purpose of the project, into four areas: the floodplain zone, older alluvial terrace, valley slopes, and uplands. The dam's scheduled construction was to begin in 1976.  Under this time constraint for such a large project, the project had to proceed efficiently. This is the planned and executed layout of the excavations that went underway including the most noted or distinguished sites. The course of action was to follow these steps:\n* Assess the reservoir and obtain assistance from the Coffee County Chapter of the Tennessee Archaeological Society.\n* Investigate and experiment the area under planned inundation.\n* Using the collected data to submit a proposal to request for funding from the Tennessee Valley Authority and National Park Service.\n* Publish the first tome which would including a description of the natural area of the reservoir, a description of the system of type classification, and a description of the primary inspection of the reservoir.\n*Devise a blueprint to mapping out the excavation and testing methods in efforts to answer the question of, what were the cultural, agricultural, cultivation, and population development patterns of the Duck River Valley inhabitants.\n* Continue to print a tome in correspondence with each passing investigation season spent in the basin.\nExcavation sites of interest\nPhase I: 1971-1972\nDuring this time, one-hundred and sixty eight sites were discovered with a total of two-hundred and forty five identifiable components. It is possible for a single site to have more than one component. The cultural phases associated with the components were determined by identifying the projectile points and ceramics associated with the component. These components are uncovered in phase I mainly by removal of the plow zone in search of features that may require further excavation. The component's phases identified as following: six Paleo-Indian/Clovis, ten Transitional Paleo-Archaic/Dalton/Big Sandy, seventeen Middle Archaic, twenty four Terminal Archaic/Wade, six Early Woodland/ Watts Bar/ Long Branch, forty Middle Woodland, sixteen late Woodland, ten Woodland, four Mississippian, and four late-eighteenth-to-nineteenth-century Euro-American sites.\n*Barton: Testing was done on a Cartesian grid with 5x5 units. This was done in order to gather a more comprehensive report on stratigraphy and concentration of features on the phase I sites. An encountered midden was excavated in .5-foot levels until the subsoil was contacted.\n*Banks III: A widespread midden was recovered and further excavated through block stripping and the removal of the plow zone. Following this and the mechanical removal of the plow zone, the site was intensively excavated by hand. Middle Woodland Owl Hollow –phase summer and winter houses were recovered.\n*Eoff I: A Woodland midden was discovered on this site as well with recommendations of further block excavation.\n*Eoff III: In the Floodplain zone, this was the only intensively occupied site. There were a quantity of Middle Archaic projectile points.\n*Hicks Site: Elements of the Late Archaic Ledbetter phase were recovered and recommended for further study.\n*Nowlin II: There was evidence of the Terminal Archaic Wade at this site which included a burial and several features.\n*Banks V: An Extensive and preserved midden was recovered and removed through controlled surface collection and plow zone removal. This was done using a smooth-bladed Tournapull pan to create a cruciform pattern of trenches to remove the plow zone.\n*Rhoton Cave: After removal of surface rock fall, excavation revealed an excellently preserved stratification of Woodland components with tremendous faunal preservation.\nPhase II: 1972-1973\nThis phase began in 1973 following the phase II, tested four large sites; Riddle, Boyd II, Wiser-Stephens, and Anthony II.. During this phase two sites with indication of heavy occupation were recovered.\n*Jernigan II: This site was very large, covering 2 acres, it was separated into seven areas for testing and controlled surface collection before excavation could commence. Frequent Ledbetter phase features, occasional midden deposits and atypical shaft-and-chamber burial dated to the Mason –phase, and characterized this large site.\n*Body II: A site with evidence of significant occupation and one of the largest in the upper reservoir zone with recommendation for further excavation.\nWiser-Stephens: Dating reveals this site to be associated with the Late Archaic period and Late Woodland period with greater occupation during the Late Woodland.\n*Ewell III: An upper reservoir site which also happened to be one of the largest.\nPhase III: 1973-1974\nIn the following spring, summer and fall of 1973, phase III progressed.\n*Hicks I: A 5x70 foot trench was dug through the archaic midden. Four levels were excavated and found to contain Ledbetter-phase basin hearths.\n*Eoff I: This site was split into two areas. On the north side was area A which was excavated with a large block. This revealed a Neal-phase occupation. A trench with a depth of two feet below the plow zone was placed through a stratified earth midden includes mostly Mason-phase components. Area B contained a 5x90 foot trench that was later converted into 20 10x10 foot unit blocks. Ledbetter, Wade, and McFarland phases were represented amongst the seventeen features that were recovered within this site. An unusually large and intensively deep stratified conical pit was recovered, but so massive that the entirety of its expansion could not be determined. The artifacts connected with it suggested it was an ancient spring that had been packed in.\n*Eoff III: This site on the floodplain lies adjacent to Eoff I site. Middle Archaic components radiocarbon dating to 4575 BC +\\- 165 were found here making it the earliest site surveyed in the reservoir although no proof of human inhabitation was recovered beneath the plow zone.\n*Banks V: Evidence of human occupation was implied by an Owl Howl winter house discovered. Total removal of the plow zone revealed many other features, most of which were in relation to this winter house. This site received the dedication of an entire volume from the Normandy collection. Ceramic analysis implies close association of this site with the Langston culture of northern Alabama.\n*Nowlin II: The Wright State University field school excavated this site under the direction of Bennie C. Keel\n*Ewell III: This site underwent further investigation, which involved stripping the alluvial terrace. This revealed Wade, McFarland, and Mason phase community patterns.\n*Jernigan II:Being the largest site in the lower reservoir zone on the right bank, it was stripped with a backhoe. Although this revealed no deposits before the Late Archaic.\nThe last two years: 1975-1976\nFocus was shifted during these last two years. This time would be spent on intensive excavation of the four sites with the most significant elements. This was done to maintain most focus on the initial hypotheses which asked the question; What was the relationship between environment and culture during the late Archaic and Mississippian periods, or the past 4000 yrs?\n*Nowlin II: Excavation on this site in the lower reservoir was done by the Wright State University field school and continued through June and July 1974.\n*Ewell III: Patterns indicating Wade, McFarland, and Mason phase inhabitance patterns were discovered in the alluvial terrace of the Ewell site.\n*Jernigan II: This site, the largest on the right bank of the lower reservoir, revealed no in situ deposits earlier than Late Archaic.on the right bank of the Duck River, was the most intensely occupied site in the lower reservoir. Within test Stratum 1 a Late Woodland Mason phase shaft-and-chamber grave was found containing the remains of a sixteen- to nineteen-year-old female year old. Radiocarbon dated to AD 770 plus or minus 85 years, this is the earliest occurrence of this grave type in the southeastern United States. The well preserved remains of an infant were also found on this site.\n*Eoff I: In 1975 excavation intensified in this area.\nInterpretations\nCultural phases\nThe following categorizations are the result of radiocarbon dates in association with the cultural components to draw an image of the passing cultural phases. This data was derived from a sample pool consisting of eighty two radiocarbon dates and seven archaeomagnetic dates. By combining these factors, cultural phases can be placed into the proper archaeological time periods. The following is an interpretation of the cultural phases within their associated time periods. By classifying artifacts, a picture of what cultures occupied the Basin during what times can be understood. In addition, a view of when the basin remained uninhabited can also be drawn. Identifying cultural time periods and phases, along with determining patterns of occupation, can also be very beneficial when determining the amount of contact between cultural phases and groups residing simultaneously.\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"8\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"center\"\n|+ Normandy Basin cultural phases present\n|-\n! colspan=\"1\" style=\"background: #efefef;\" | Paleoindian\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Archaic\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Woodland\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Mississippian\n|-\n| style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid grey;\" valign=\"top\" |&nbsp;\n| style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid grey;\" valign=\"top\" |Middle Archaic\n| style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid grey;\" valign=\"top\" |Late Archaic\n| style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid grey;\" valign=\"top\" |Early Woodland\n| style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid grey;\" valign=\"top\" |Early Middle Woodland\n| style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid grey;\" valign=\"top\" |Middle Woodland\n| style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid grey;\" valign=\"top\" |Late Middle Woodland\n| style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid grey;\" valign=\"top\" |Late Woodland\n| style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid grey;\" valign=\"top\" |Mississippian\n| style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid grey;\" valign=\"top\" |Late Mississippian\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| &nbsp;\n| Ledbetter Phase\n| Long Branch Phase\n| McFarland Phase\n| McFarland Phase\n| Owl Hollow Phase\n| Mason Phase\n| Emergent Mississippian Phase\n| &nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| &nbsp;\n| Hicks Phase\n| Watts Bar Phase\n| &nbsp;\n| Owl Hollow Phase\n| Mason Phase\n| &nbsp;\n| Early Mississippian Phase\n| &nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| &nbsp;\n| Wade Phase\n| Neel Phase\n| &nbsp;\n| Mason Phase\n| &nbsp;\n| &nbsp;\n| &nbsp;\n| &nbsp;\n|-\n|}\nConclusions\nSubsistence developments\nThe hypothesis concerning the usage of plants and animals in the culture and how that relates to settlement pattern, was focused on and tested against the materials found. The question of whether or not the patterns of hunting and gathering shifted into a more agricultural focus in coordination with the passage of time from Archaic to Mississippian. White tailed deer was the primary source of meat but other vertebrates were a constant alternative. When questioning which plants were a source of food, a variety of herbaceous annuals were utilized from the late archaic and increased onto the Middle Woodland. Maize was found in context with the Owl Hollow, while other food sources such as squash and gourd rind were also recovered. Domestication of herbaceous plants such as the chenopodium, marsh elder, and even the domestication of some of these plants was evident by the Middle Woodland period. This shift to intensive gardening seems to coincide with a shift from sparse settlements to condensed communities within the fertile floodplain of the lower reservoir zone in the Owl Hollow and Banks phases.\nSettlement and community patterns\nThe past four-thousand years was the time span in question and was concentrated on most intensively to determine whether or not the individuals were living a mobile hunter gatherer lifestyle of whether they were living in a permanent villages. In the early Middle woodland period, homes were found scattered throughout both reservoir zones, but these scattered temporary settlement patterns had shifted to more permanent homes found only in the lower reservoir by the late McFarland phase. This may have been a result of the efforts toward the construction of the Old Stone Fort enclosure. Permanent homes were found only in the lower reservoir zones during the Mississippian cultures and during the Owl Hollow phases. These observed shifts in settlement are explained with a correlation to their subsistence patterns, patterns of gardening herbaceous annuals, and some maize farming done by the Owl Hollow people. An alternative way of determining whether a home is temporary or permanent is to observe the frequency of food preparation and storage facilities. In the Archaic phase the only site with evidence of this time period is the Eoff III. The completeness of the components found here indicates the reduced frequency of use of this area as a temporary seasonal dwelling as the community shifted towards a less mobile lifestyle. In the Ledbetter phase, more storage pits, burials, and postholes are observed. Continuing in to the wade phase a greater degree of permanency is indicated by homes with walls and roofs. More exotic materials such as dover chert and steatite are seen in this phase which indicated a greater degree of complexity in trade and communication.\nMajor occupations were found in the area spanning from the Late Archaic period, through the Mississippian periods. \"From archaeological observation, there is no verification of late or protohistoric Mississippian occupation of the Reservoir area\".[5] Initial Native American populations were mobile hunter-gatherers living in small groups. Many of the earlier sites, dating to the late Pleistocene/early Holocene, were covered by later occupations. During the Middle Archaic period (c. 4000-6000 BC), larger sites appeared, with locations again guided by environmental factors, as was the case throughout prehistory.[5] Ceramics appeared after 1000 BC. during the Woodland period. Cultural continuation is evident between the Early Woodland Long Branch and Middle Woodland McFarland Phases. The latter phase of which seems to relate with the Copena culture of Northern Alabama. Connections to Scioto and Havana Hopewell in Ohio and Illinois and southern Hopewellian sites, like Tunacunnhee, are indicated by foreign grave goods, extravagant burial practices, and earthworks. With c. AD 200 comes the appearance of the Owl Hollow culture. There is little to no connection between the Owl culture and the Mason phase. Although some Mason culture traits, such as net impressed pottery and shaft-and-chamber graves are found in Late Woodland Cultures. Sites from the Woodland period remain small, little can be determined from this period. Only Jernigan II shows evidence of extended seasonal occupation even though occupation decreased on the Duck River during this time. Within the Upper Duck Valley, the Middle Woodland periods exhibits proof of having the densest population which consisted of 25-30 individuals, or three extended households. The upper duck river valleys continued to undergo testing to ascertain the subsistence and settlement patterns of the Middle Woodland phase.\nSurrounding sites\nNot far from Lake Normandy lies the Old Stone Fort Archaeological state park, a 2000 yr old Indian ceremonial site. Built by the people of the Middle Woodland culture, the walls and mounds that were once believed to be a fort are now thought to be a 50-acre enclosure making a ceremonial site and gathering place. The park is on the National Register of Historic Places.\nScientific publications\n*BACON, WILLARD S.\n**1982 Structural Data Recovered from the Banks I11 Site (40CF108) and the Parks Site (40CFSB), Normandy Reservoir, Coffee County, Tennessee.
