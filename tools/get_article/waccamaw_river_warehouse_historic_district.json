It includes three contributing buildings: a steamer terminal (ca. 1880), warehouse (ca. 1890), and tobacco warehouse (ca. 1900). These buildings illustrate the evolution of utilitarian structures at the end of the 19th century, documenting the shift from heavy-timber braced-frame structural members to smaller-member, balloon framing with multiple diagonal bracing and the use of a clerestory for additional light.  They are the last extant warehouses in Conway associated with the commercial trade on the Waccamaw River.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.\nGallery\nFile:Waccamaw_River_Warehouse_Historic_District_Steamer_Terminal_Jun_10.JPG|Steamer Terminal, June 2010\nFile:Waccamaw_River_Warehouse_Historic_District_Tobacco_Warehouse_Jun_10.JPG|Tobacco Warehouse, June 2010\nFile:Waccamaw_River_Warehouse_Historic_District_Warehouse_Jun_10.JPG|Warehouse, June 2010\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.palmettohistory.org/hpdistricts/waccamaw-river-warehouse-h.html Waccamaw River Warehouse Historic District Map]\n*[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM2HK1_Waccamaw_River_Warehouse_Historic_District_Conway_South_Carolina Waccamaw River Warehouse Historic District - Conway, South Carolina - U.S. National Register of Historic Places on Waymarking.com]"
