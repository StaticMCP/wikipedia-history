Initially, the house of culture was called the Palace of the Kievsky district of Moscow and was created as part of the infrastructure of the aircraft factory. The building was constructed in the style of constructivism in 1929–1938. The palace is named after aircraft design engineer .\nAmong the bands that have played concerts at Gorbunov Palace are Jethro Tull, Einstürzende Neubauten, Coil, Diamanda Galas, Nightwish, Therion, Laibach, Lacrimosa, DDT, Boris Grebenshchikov, Krematorij and others, \"Nashestvie\" (1999) and \"Uchites plavat\" (1995—1997) festivals.\nArchitecture\nThe building's exterior conforms to the Constructivist style, while the interior is decorated in the Art Deco style. The formal façade is combined with large glazing allowing plenty of natural light to enter. The outline of the building is reminiscent of an aeroplane wing, which emphasises its belonging to an aircraft factory.\nTwo wings of the cultural centre are connected by crosswalks on the first and second floors.\nSee also\n* Gorbushka\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.dkgorbunova.ru Official site]"
