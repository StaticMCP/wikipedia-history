In the , Newstead had a population of 7,496 people.\nGeography\nNewstead is  north-east of Brisbane central business district, bounded by Breakfast Creek to the north and the Brisbane River to the east.\nThe northern and western parts of the suburb, centred on Breakfast Creek Road, is predominantly commercial, with the remainder, particularly near the river, becoming increasingly residential.\nHistory\nRotunda in Newstead Park looking over the [[Brisbane River]]\nThe suburb takes its name from Newstead House, built and named in 1846 by pioneer grazier Patrick Leslie, which in turn takes its name from Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire, England.\nThe suburb's present role as an up-market residential suburb belies its industrial past. Timber yards, asbestos works, wharves and woolstores once dominated the eastern side of the suburb. The tall iron structure of the No. 2 gasholder on Skyring Terrace is a remnant of the Newstead Gasworks (), which was established in 1887 as Brisbane's second gas works. The structure, however, was originally located at the Petrie Bight gasworks, where it was erected in 1873.\nThe suburb was served by first horse drawn trams from 1885.  From 1897 electric trams ran along Commercial Road (until December 1962) and along Ann and Wickham Streets until April 1969.  Light Street tram and bus depot was located in the suburb.  It opened as a tram depot in 1885, saw its last trams in December 1968 and finally closed as a bus depot in the mid 1990s, making it one of Queensland's longest continually operating industrial sites.  All traces of the depot and its heritage have been obliterated and the site redeveloped, although a remnant of its trackwork – a unique three way set of points – has been preserved at the Brisbane Tramway Museum.\nIn 1888 the Booroodabin Bowls Club was established, making it the oldest bowls club still operating in Queensland. At that time, the club was within the local government area of Booroodabin Division, which was established in 1879 and amalgamated into the Town of Brisbane in 1903. The club's name presumably reflects the local government area. The name Booroodabin is an Aboriginal word meaning place of the she-oaks.\nBreakfast Creek State School opened on 7 July 1890 and closed on 11 August 1961.  It was on the western side of Agnes Street (, now in Albion). Following the closure of the school, the Fortitude Valley Opportunity School relocated into the buildings, becoming Newstead Opportunity School. Later it was renamed Newstead Special School (). It closed in 1996.\nThe suburb was served by the Bulimba Branch railway line, which branched off the main north coast line at Bowen Hills and descended towards the river and Breakfast Creek Road, crossing it to reach the industry, wool stores and wharves along the river. The line opened on 16 December 1897 and closed on 31 March 1990. Some remnants of the rail line have been preserved in the wool stores precinct. The name Bulimba'' reflects historic use of this name for both sides of the Bulimba Reach of the Brisbane River, but today it refers only to the suburb on the south side of the reach.\nNewstead Park contains the Australian American Memorial () which commemorates the United States of America's contribution to defending Australia during World War II, when General Douglas MacArthur based his headquarters in Brisbane. The foundation stone of the memorial was laid on 3 May 1951 during Coral Sea week (the Battle of the Coral Sea was fought from 4 to 8 May 1942). The completed memorial was unveiled on 3 May 1952 by Sir John Lavarack, then the Governor of Queensland.\nDemographics\nIn the , Newstead had a population of 836 people, 49.8% female and 50.2% male.

It is set in superb grounds overlooking the mouth of the creek and is within easy walking distance of the famed Breakfast Creek Hotel – a flamboyant Victorian structure which has been described as 'the very soul of Brisbane'. Newstead House's glory days came during the time of the residence of Captain John Clements Wickham, the official resident and magistrate of the Moreton Bay settlement and a noted and gracious host.  Wickham had previously been Commander of  and sailed with Charles Darwin. While an admission fee must be paid to visit the house, the gardens (now Newstead Park) are a public park.\nTransport\nTransport for Brisbane serves the suburb by bus.
