He inherited the baronetcy of Margam on the death of his brother Henry who died in infancy in around 1640.\nIn 1660, Mansel was elected Member of Parliament for Glamorgan in the Convention Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Glamorgan in 1670 for the Cavalier Parliament and sat until 1679. In 1681 he was re-elected MP for Glamorgan and held the seat until 1689. In 1660 he was appointed a commissioner of militia in Glamorgan and was the Colonel of the Glamorganshire Militia in 1665 and again, in 1697. In 1688, he was appointed High Sheriff of Glamorgan.\nMansel was an influential person in South Wales. The Duke of Beaufort, when Lord President of Wales, visited Margam during his \"Progress\" in 1684. Mansel died at the age of 69.\nFamily\nMansel married Martha Carne, daughter of Edward Carne of Ewenny, Glamorgan. His son, Thomas, succeeded to the baronetcy and was created Baron Mansel. His daughter Martha married Thomas Morgan of Tredegar, which marriage and its after-effects caused the baronet much trouble because Thomas Morgan was reluctant to return from a tour on the continent of Europe. His daughter Elizabeth married Sir Edward Stradling, 5th Baronet.\nReferences"
