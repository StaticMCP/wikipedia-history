He was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford.\nLord Stanley oversaw the loss of the family's ancestral estate at Alderley Park. With a fondness for gambling, wine and marriage, he had to pay for four divorce settlements, and death duties, even at pre-war levels, for both the 4th and 5th Barons. When the mansion at Alderley Park was destroyed by fire in 1931 he moved into the former farmhouse. When he sold the estate in 1938 to the property developers Hambling Crundall and Co Ltd., many of his older tenants were forced to leave the village.\nHe had four wives:\n* Lady Victoria Audrey Beatrice Chetwynd-Talbot (married 3 March 1932 – divorced 1936). Died 1994.\n* Edith Louisa Sylvia Ashley (married 18 January 1944 – divorced 1948). Died 1977.\n* Thérèse Husson (married 6 April 1951 – divorced 1957)\n* Kathleen Margaret Crane (née Wright) (married 15 September 1961 – his death 1971). Died 1996.\nHe and Victoria had one daughter, The Hon. Edwina Maureen Stanley (born 19 January 1933). On his death in 1971, his brother Lyulph Stanley succeeded to his titles, albeit only briefly.\nArms\n|escutcheon = Argent, on a bend azure, three bucks' heads cabossed or, a crescent for difference.\n|crest = On a chapeau gules, turned up ermine, an eagle with wings expanded or preying upon an infant proper, swaddled gules, handed argent.\n|supporters = Dexter, a stag or, gorged with a ducal crown, line reflexed over the back, and charged on the shoulder with a mullet azure; sinister, a lion reguardant proper, gorged with a plain collar argent charged with three escallops gules.\n|motto = Sans Changer \"Without Changing\"}}\nReferences"
