It was constructed of stone piers to support the wooden structure of the bridge, and had a total length of around . To cross the river it used three cast iron spans in the form of Gothic arches, each  long, with the main one being  high. It opened in 1831.\nHistory\nThe present viaduct was opened in 1849 by the Edinburgh and Hawick Railway to carry the Waverley Line, running between Edinburgh and Carlisle. The viaduct was designed by John Miller.\nIt was closed to passenger traffic in 1969 as a result of the Beeching cuts, and to freight in 1972. It was reopened in 2015 for the Borders Railway line between Edinburgh and Tweedbank. Some work was required on the viaduct to prepare it for the reopening of the railway, although it was still structurally sound.\nDesign\nIt has 23 nearly semicircular arches, with 14 spans of , seven of , one of  and one of . The piers are  thick at the foundations, tapering to  at the springing of the arches. The arches are lined with three layers of bricks. Most, but not all the arches are reinforced with iron strapping, as are nearly all of the piers. The long pier which sits in the river has a large cutwater.\nThe last arch at the south end is a skew arch to accommodate the A7 public road, which runs parallel to the viaduct before cutting underneath it. The viaduct is nearly straight, but with a slight curve at the northern end where it crosses the river. To the south of the viaduct is a caravan park.\nReferences\nExternal links"
