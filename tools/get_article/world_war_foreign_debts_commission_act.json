Great Britain's debt was reduced 19.7% to $4.6 billion with the interest rate reduced from 5% to 3% for the first ten years of payment to be raised to 3½% thereafter. France's debt was reduced by 52.8% to $4 billion, without any interest for the first five years of payment. It was then to be increased gradually to 3½%.\nSee also\n* Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red\n* Mellon–Berenger Agreement\n* Repudiation of debt at the Russian Revolution\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n* [https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1922v01/ch3 Negotiations on behalf of the World War Foreign Debt Commission for the settlement or refunding of debts owed the United States by foreign governments (Documents 116–143)]\n*\n*\n* }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* [http://www.tomsargent.com/research/IMF_final.pdf Complications for the United States from International Credits: 1913 -1940, George J.
