Flanking the steps are walls with moulded coping and square pedestals with square iron lanterns. The inset tablets hold the names of parishes, towns and villages in the city and county.\nThe gate pillars hold raised tablets with the names of men and women from St Mary’s parish who died in the First World War.\nThe memorial was restored in 2008 when new inscribed panels were installed.\nReferences"
