The battle took place 30 kilometers northwest of Genoa, which was at the time under French control but under siege by the Austrians. The skirmish at Sassello ended in favor of the Austrians, with either side losing about 1,000 men but with the Austrians being able to pursue their encirclement of Genoa.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Pigeard, Alain – Dictionnaire des batailles de Napoléon, Tallandier, Bibliothèque Napoléonienne, 2004,"
