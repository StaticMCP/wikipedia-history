Although this pronunciation is no longer taught in Latin classes, it is still broadly used in the fields of biology, law, and medicine.\nIn the Middle Ages speakers of English, from Middle English onward, pronounced Latin not as the ancient Romans did, but in the way that had developed among speakers of French. This traditional pronunciation then became closely linked to the pronunciation of English, and as the pronunciation of English changed with time, the English pronunciation of Latin changed as well.\nUntil the beginning of the 19th century all English speakers used this pronunciation, including Roman Catholics for liturgical purposes. Following Catholic emancipation in Britain in 1829 and the subsequent Oxford Movement, newly converted Catholics preferred the Italianate pronunciation, which became the norm for the Catholic liturgy. Meanwhile, scholarly proposals were made for a reconstructed Classical pronunciation, close to the pronunciation used in the late Roman Republic and early Empire, and with a more transparent relationship between spelling and pronunciation.\nOne immediate audible difference between the pronunciations is in the treatment of vowels. The English pronunciation of Latin applied vowel sound changes which had occurred within English itself, where stressed vowels in a word became quite different from their unstressed counterpart. In the other two pronunciations of Latin, vowel sounds were not changed. Among consonants, for example, the treatment of the letter c followed by a front vowel was one clear distinction. That is, the name Cicero is pronounced in English as  , in Ecclesiastical Latin as , and in restored Classical Latin as .\nThe competition between the three pronunciations grew towards the end of the 19th century.\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, however, a consensus for change had developed. The Classical Association, shortly after its foundation in 1903, put forward a detailed proposal for a reconstructed classical pronunciation. This was supported by other professional and learned bodies. Finally in February 1907 their proposal was officially recommended by the Board of Education. Adoption of the \"new pronunciation\" was a long, drawn-out process, but by the mid-20th century, classroom instruction in the traditional English pronunciation had ceased.\nIllustrative survivals\nThe traditional pronunciation survives in academic and general English vocabulary:\n* In a very large body of words used every day: album, apex, area, asylum, axis, basis, bonus, camera, census, cinema, circus, crisis, dilemma, error, focus, genesis, genius, hypothesis, icon, insignia, item, junior, major, medium, minor, murmur, onus, panacea, podium, ratio, sector, stamina, terminus, trivia; as well as such common phrases as ad infinitum, et cetera, non sequitur, quid pro quo, status quo, vice versa, etc.\n* In academic vocabulary: campus, syllabus, curriculum, diploma, alumnus\n* In anatomical vocabulary: aorta, biceps, cranium, patella, penis, sinus, vertebra, vagina, etc.\n* In astronomical nomenclature, including the names of planets, moons, asteroids, stars and constellations, such as Mars, Io, Ceres, Sirius, Ursa Major, nova, nebula, though many of these are irregular (e.g. expected  for Libra is less common than irregular )\n* In many biblical names: Ananias, Cornelius, Felix, Jesus, Judas, Lydia, Nicodemus, Nicolas, Priscilla, Sergius, Silas, Titus, Zacharias, etc.\n* In a number of historical terms and names, particularly those associated with Greek or Roman culture and politics: augur, bacchanal, consul, fibula, lictor, prætor, toga, Augustus, Cæsar, Cicero, Diocletian, Hypatia, Plato, Socrates, Trajan, etc.\n* In legal terminology and phrases: affidavit, alibi, alias, de jure, obiter dictum, sub judice, subpoena, etc. In many cases Classical pronunciation is used, however.\n* In the specialized terminology of literary studies: codex, colophon, epitome, index, periphrasis, parenthesis, etc.\n* In some mathematical terms: calculus, parabola, hyperbola, isosceles, rhombus, vector, etc.\n* In medical terminology describing diseases, symptoms and treatments: anaesthesia, bacterium, coma, lumbago, mucus, nausea, ophthalmia, rabies, tetanus, virus, rigor mortis. etc.\n* In words and names from classical mythology: Achilles, Argus, Calliope, Gorgon, Myrmidon, Sphinx, etc.\n* In many place names: Carolina, Judæa, Annapolis, Dalmatia, Ithaca, Nicæa, Pennsylvania, Romania, Salina, Virginia, etc.\n* In some religious terms: Angelus, basilica, Magi, martyr, presbyter, etc.\n* In many saints' names: Athanasius, Eugenia, Eusebius, Ignatius, Irene, Januarius, Leo, Macarius, Marcella, Theophilus, etc.\n* In certain sporting terms: gymnasium, stadium, discus, pentathlon\n* In the taxonomic nomenclature of botany and zoology: phylum, genus, species, chrysanthemum, hibiscus, rhododendron, foetus, larva, ovum, pupa, chameleon, lemur, platypus\nVowel length and stress\nIn most cases, the English pronunciation of Classical words and names is predictable from the orthography, as long as long and short vowels are distinguishable in the source. For Latin, Latinized Greek or for long versus short α, ι, υ Greek vowels, this means that macrons and breves must be used if the pronunciation is to be unambiguous. However, the conventions of biological nomenclature forbid the use of these diacritics, and in practice they are not found in astronomical names or in literature. Without this information, it may not be possible to ascertain the placement of stress, and therefore the pronunciation of the vowels in English.\nNote that the following rules are generalizations, and that many names have well-established idiosyncratic pronunciations.\nStress placement\nLatin stress is predictable. It falls on the penultimate syllable when that is \"heavy\", and on the antepenultimate syllable when the penult is \"light\".\nIn Greek, stress is not predictable, but it may be ignored when pronouncing Greek borrowings, as they have been filtered through Latin and have acquired the stress patterns of Latin words.\nA syllable is \"light\" if it ends in a single short vowel. For example, a, ca, sca, scra are all light syllables for the purposes of Latin stress assignment.\nAny other syllable is \"heavy\":\n*if it is closed (ended) by a consonant: an, can, scan, scran\n*if the vowel is long or a diphthong in Latin, or in the Latin transliteration of Greek: ā, cā, scā, scrā (a long vowel) or æ, cæ, scæ, scræ (a diphthong).\nLatin diphthongs may be written  or ,  or . Long vowels are written with a macron: ā ē ī ō ū ȳ, though this is a modern convention. Greek long vowels are ει, η, ου, ω, sometimes ι, υ, and occasionally α. (Long α is uncommon.) For example, Actaeon is pronounced   or  . A diaeresis indicates that the vowels do not form a diphthong: Arsinoë   (not *).\nThe importance of marking long vowels for Greek words can be illustrated with Ixion, from Greek Ἰξίων. As it is written, the English pronunciation might be expected to be * . However, length marking, Ixīōn, makes it clear that it should be pronounced  .\nWhen a consonant ends a word, or when more than a single consonant follows a vowel within a word, the syllable is closed and therefore heavy. (A consonant is not the same thing as a letter. The letters x  and z  each count as two consonants, but th , ch , and ph  count as one, as the pronunciations in brackets indicate.) The English letter j was originally an i, forming a diphthong with the preceding vowel, so it forces the stress just as æ, œ, z, and x do.\n* Exception: a consonant cluster of p, t, or c/k plus l or r is ambiguous. The preceding syllable was open in ordinary Latin. However, when a different stress placement was required by poetic meter, it could be treated as closed. Thus the name Chariclo (Chariklō) could be syllabified as either cha-ri-klō, with an open penult and stress on the cha (normal Latin), or cha-rik-lō, with a closed penult and stress on the rik (an optional poetic pronunciation), so both   and   are acceptable pronunciations in English.\nSecondary stress\nIf more than two syllables precede the stressed syllable, the same rules determine which is stressed. For example, in Cassiopeia (also Cassiopēa), syllabified cas-si-o-pei-a, the penult pei/pē contains a long vowel/diphthong and is therefore stressed. The second syllable preceding the stress, si, is light, so the stress must fall one syllable further back, on cas (which coincidentally happens to be a closed syllable and therefore heavy). Therefore, the standard English pronunciation is  . }} (Note however that this word also has an irregular pronunciation in English:  .)\nLong and short vowels\nWhether a vowel letter is pronounced \"long\" in English () or \"short\" () is unrelated to the length of the original Latin or Greek vowel. Instead it depends on position and stress. A vowel followed by a consonant at the end of a word is short in English, except that final -es is always long, as in Pales  . In the middle of a word, a vowel followed by more than one consonant is short, as in Hermippe  , while a vowel with no following consonant is long. However, when a vowel is followed by a single consonant (or by a cluster of p, t, c/k plus l, r) and then another vowel, it gets more complicated.\n*If the syllable is unstressed, it is open, and the vowel is often reduced to schwa.\n*If the penultimate syllable is stressed, it is open and the vowel long, as in Europa  .\n*If any other syllable is stressed, it is closed and the vowel is short, as in Ganymede   and Anaxagoras  .\nRegardless of position, stressed u stays long before a single consonant (or a cluster of p, t, c/k plus l, r), as in Jupiter  .\n*Exception: A stressed nonhigh vowel (a, e, o) stays long before a single consonant (or cluster of p, t, c/k plus l, r) followed by an  or   sound (e, i, y) plus another vowel at the end of a word: Proteus  , Demetrius  . This is because, historically and regionally, in many of these words the e, i, y is pronounced   and combines with the following syllable, so that the preceding syllable is penultimate and therefore open:  .\nTraditionally, English syllables have been described as 'open' when their vowel (in English) is long and they are followed by a single consonant followed by another vowel, and as 'closed' in the same environment when their vowel is short. However, it is debated how accurate this analysis is, as in English syllables tend to attract a following consonant, especially when they are stressed, so that all stressed syllables followed by a consonant are arguably 'closed'. Such following consonants are sometimes described as ambisyllabic. This effect is especially apparent in some dialects, such as RP, when the consonant in question is /r/, which affects the quality of the preceding vowel. None of this changes the patterns described in this article: The long-short distinction described above is maintained regardless. For example, the 'e' in Hera is long regardless of whether it is pronounced  or  in a particular dialect, or analyzed as open  or as closed . American dictionaries tend to follow the former transcription, and British dictionaries the latter, so  when the consonant 'r' is involved the rules for the English pronunciation of Latin words are more straightforward when using the conventions of American dictionaries.\nAlphabet\nAnglo-Latin includes all of the letters of the English alphabet except w, viz.: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v x y z. It differs from Classical Latin in distinguishing i from j and u from v.\nIn addition to these letters, the digraphs æ and œ may be used (as in Cæsar and phœnix). These two digraphs respectively represent mergers of the letters ae and oe (diphthongs, as are Greek αι and οι) and are often written that way (e.g., Caesar, phoenix). However, since in Anglo-Latin both ae and oe represent a simple vowel, not a diphthong, the use of the single letters æ and œ better represents the reality of Anglo-Latin pronunciation.\nDespite being written with two letters, the Greek sequences ch, ph, rh, th represent single sounds. The letters x and Greek z, on the other hand, are sequences of two sounds (being equivalent to cs and dz).\nConversion of Greek to Latin\nAnglo-Latin includes a large amount of Greek vocabulary; in principle, any Greek noun or adjective can be converted into an Anglo-Latin word. There is a conventional set of equivalents between the letters of the Greek and Roman alphabets, which differs in some respects from the current mode of Romanizing Greek. This is laid out in the tables below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"center\" colspan=\"11\"|Vowels || align=\"center\" colspan=\"7\"|Diphthongs\n|-\n| Greek letter || colspan=2| α || ε || η || colspan=2| ι || ο || colspan=2| υ || ω || αι || ει || οι || υι || αυ || ευ || ου\n|-\n| Romanization || a || ā || e || ē || i || ī || o || u || ū || ō || ai || ei || oi || ui || au || eu || ou\n|-\n| Conversion to Latin|| a || ā || e || ē || i || ī || o || y || ȳ || ō || æ || ī || œ || yi || au || eu || ū\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"center\" colspan=\"27\"|Consonants\n|-\n| Greek letter || ʻ || β || γ || γγ || γκ || γξ || γχ || δ || ζ || θ || κ || λ || μ || ν || ξ || π || ρ || ῤ || ῥ || ῤῥ || σ || ς || τ || φ || χ || ψ\n|-\n| Romanization || h || b || g || gg || gk || gx || gch || d || z || th || k || l || m || n || x || p || colspan=2| r || hr || rhr || colspan=2| s || t || ph || ch || ps\n|-\n| Conversion to Latin || h || b || g || ng || nc || nx || nch || d || z || th || c || l || m || n || x || p || colspan=2| r || rh|| rrh || colspan=2| s || t || ph ||ch ||ps\n|}\nRh is used for Greek ρ at the beginnings of words, e.g. ῥόμβος (rhombos) > rhombus.\nRarely (and mostly in words relatively recently adapted from Greek), k is used to represent Greek κ. In such cases it is always pronounced  and never  (as it might be if spelled c) : e.g. σκελετός (skeletos) > skeleton not \"sceleton\".\nGreek accent marks and breath marks, other than the \"rough breathing\" (first in the list of consonants above), are entirely disregarded; the Greek pitch accent is superseded by a Latin stress accent, which is described below.\nFrequently, but not universally, certain Greek nominative endings are changed to Latin ones that cannot be predicted from the tables above. Occasionally forms with both endings are found in Anglo-Latin, for instance Latinized hyperbola next to Greek hyperbole. The most usual equations are found below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"center\" colspan=\"8\"|Endings\n|-\n| Greek ending|| -η || -εια || -ον || -ειον || -ος || -ροςafter a consonant || -ειος\n|-\n| Romanization|| -ē || -eia || -on || -eion || -os || -ros || -eios\n|-\n| Latin ending || -ā || -ēa-īa || -um || -ēum-īum || -us || -er || -ēus-īus\n|}\nExamples:\n* Greek ἄγγελος (aggelos) > Latin angelus (γγ > ng, -ος > us)\n* Greek ἔλλειψις (elleipsis) > Latin ellipsis (ει > i (shortened before ps), ψ > ps)\n* Greek μουσεῖον (mouseion) > Latin mūsēum (ου > ū, ει > ē, -ον > um)\n* Greek μαίανδρος (maiandros) > Latin mæander (αι > æ, -ρος > er)\n* Greek χρυσάνθεμον (chrȳsanthemon) > Latin chrȳsanthemum (χ > ch, υ > y, θ > th, -ον > um)\n* Greek διάῤῥοια (diarroia) > Latin diarrhœa (ῤῥ > rrh, οι > œ)\nConsonants\nLetters and sounds\n* The letters b, f, k, l, m, p, v and z have each only one sound, which corresponds to the equivalent IPA symbols .\n* The letter j has the single sound .\n* The letter r has a single sound,  in rhotic dialects of English. In nonrhotic dialects, it varies according to placement in a syllable. At the beginning of a syllable, it is pronounced . At the end of a syllable, i.e. between a vowel and a consonant, or after a vowel at the end of a word, it is dropped—though not without, frequently, affecting the pronunciation of the previous vowel sound. If r occurs at the end of a word after a vowel, and the next word begins with a vowel, it is usually pronounced as the beginning of the first syllable of the next word. Rh and rrh are pronounced exactly like r and rr.\n* When followed by a vowel, the combinations qu (always) and gu and su (usually) stand for , , and  respectively.\n* The combination ph is pronounced .\n* The combination th is pronounced .\n* The combination ch is pronounced  in all environments - although in Scottish pronunciation it is pronounced  at the end of a syllable.\n* The letters c, d, g, h, n, s, t, x have different values depending upon surrounding sounds and syllable structure.\nPhonemes\nThe underlying consonantal phonemes of Anglo-Latin are close in most respects to those of Latin, the primary difference being that  and  are replaced in Anglo-Latin by   and  . The sound   was borrowed from Greek.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n! Labial\n! Dental\n! Alveolar\n! Palato-alveolar\n! Velar\n!

Voicing is more common in Latin than in Greek words, and never occurs in the common Greek ending -sis, where s is always voiceless: basis, crisis, genesis.\nPalatalization\nThe most common type of phonemic change in Anglo-Latin is palatalization. Anglo-Latin reflects the results of no less than four palatalization processes. The first of these occurred in Late Latin, the second in Proto-Gallo-Romance, the third and fourth within the history of English. While the first two palatalizations are universally used in variants of Anglo-Latin, the third and especially the fourth are incompletely observed in different varieties of Anglo-Latin, leading to some variant pronunciations.\n*Palatalization 1 affected only the sound of t, converting it to  when it preceded a semivowel i (at that stage pronounced ) and did not follow s, t, or x. This  sound eventually merged with  and was subject to further changes in Palatalization 3. When  followed  or  it did not change; in some cases it might later change to  by Palatalization 4. Note that t did not change to  before semivowel e, but remained  as in confiteor.\n*Palatalization 2 affected the sounds of c and g, converting them to  and ; the  arising from c merged with the  arising from t, and both shared further developments of this sound, turning to . When geminate (double), palatalized cc and gg were affected diversely; only the second c in cc was palatalized, producing the sound , as in successor; but both gs in gg were palatalized, producing a  sound, as in \"exaggerate\".\n*Palatalization 3 affected  and  of whatever origin, changing them to  and .\n*Palatalization 4 affected  and  exactly as Palatalization 3 did, but also affected  and , changing them to  and\nSome of the occasions on which palatalizations 3 and 4 fail to take effect should be noted:\n* Palatalization 3 fails: asphyxia, Cassiopeia, dyspepsia, excelsior, exeunt, gymnasium, symposium, trapezium. Note that the semivowel i is always pronounced as a full vowel  in these cases. In some dialects Palatalization 3 frequently fails when another  sound follows, as in \"enunciation\", \"pronunciation\", \"appreciation\", \"glaciation\", \"association\", with the  sound then generalized to closely related forms (\"enunciate\", \"appreciate\", \"associate\").\n*Palatalization 4 fails (in some dialects): cæsura, fistula, pæninsula, pendulum.\nSummary\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

That is, bb, dd, ff, ll, mm, nn, pp, rr, ss, tt became pronounced . However, for the purposes of determining whether a syllable is open or closed, these single consonants continue to act as consonant clusters.\nOther notable instances involving degemination include:\n*cc developed two pronunciations:\n**before a front vowel (e, æ, œ, i, y) cc is pronounced , and as it consists of two distinct sounds, is not degeminated.\n**before a back vowel (a, o, u) cc was pronounced  which degeminated to simply\n* cqu  degeminated to\n* gg also has two pronunciations:\n** before a front vowel, gg is pronounced  after degemination.\n** before a back vowel, gg is pronounced  after degemination.\n* sc before a front vowel was pronounced , and degeminated to .\n* sc and ss before the \"semivowel\" are pronounced\nThe following combinations, derived from Greek, are also pronounced as single consonants:\n* κχ cch is pronounced : Bacchus\n* πφ pph is pronounced : Sappho\n* τθ tth is pronounced : Pittheus\nSyllables\nThe simple vowels of Anglo-Latin (a, æ, e, ei, i, o, œ, u, y) can each have several phonetic values dependent upon their stress, position in the word, and syllable structure. Knowing which value to use requires an explanation of two syllabic characteristics, openness and stress.\nOpenness\nOpenness is a quality of syllables, by which they may be either open, semiopen, semiclosed, or fully closed.\nFully closed syllables\nFully closed syllables are those in which the vowel in the middle of the syllable (the vocalic nucleus) is followed by at least one consonant, which ends or \"closes\" the syllable. Vowels in fully closed syllables appear:\n* At the end of a word followed by at least one consonant, e.g. plus, crux, lynx.\n* In the middle of a word followed by two or more consonants. The first of these consonants \"closes\" the syllable, and the second begins the following syllable; thus a word like lector consists of the two closed syllables lec and tor. Sequences of three or more consonants may be broken up in different ways (e.g., sanc.tum, sculp.tor, ul.tra, ful.crum, ex.tra) but nothing depends upon the exact way in which this is done; any sequence of three or more consonants creates a closed syllable before it. The letter x is equivalent to cs, and as such also closes a syllable; a word like nexus is syllabified nec.sus, and consists of two closed syllables.\n* Two successive consonants of identical pronunciation are always pronounced as a single consonant in Anglo-Latin. When such a consonant sequence follows a penult syllable, the syllable counts as closed for the purposes of determining the position of stress: ba.cíl.lus, di.lém.ma, an.tén.na, co.lós.sus; they also prevent a penult syllable from lengthening, as in the previous examples and also pal.lor, com.ma, man.na, cir.rus, cas.si.a, pas.sim, glot.tis. They also count as closed for the purpose of determining whether a u is open or closed. In these respects they act precisely like syllable-closing consonant sequences, although they are pronounced as single sounds. (In words like successor the two c's do not merge, because each of them has a different sound— and , respectively.)\n* Certain sequences of consonants do not close syllables: these include all instances of obstruents (stops and fricatives) followed by r, including br, cr, chr, dr, gr, pr, tr, thr. Thus words like supra and matrix are syllabified as su.pra and ma.trix, and the first syllable of both words is open; likewise a.cro.po.lis, di.plo.ma, de.tri.tus. The sequence  (spelled qu) also does not close the preceding syllable; i.e., one syllabifies re.qui.em and not req.ui.em.\n* Sequences of obstruents followed by l are less consistent. The sequences cl, chl, gl and pl do not close a syllable, e.g. nu.cle.us, du.plex with open first syllables; but the sequences bl, tl, thl do close a syllable, producing the syllabifications Pub.li.us, at.las, pen.tath.lon, with closed syllables before the l.\nSemiclosed syllables\nSemiclosed syllables are closed, unstressed syllables that had been closed and became open due to the merger of two following consonants of the same sound. For the purpose of determining vowel reduction in initial unstressed syllables they count as open.\n*Double consonants following an initial syllable containing a, e, i, o merge to count as one consonant: a.(c)cumulator, a.(g)gres.sor, ca.(l)li.o.pe, a.(p)pen.dix, e.(l)lip.sis, co.(l)lec.tor, o.(p)pres.sor, o.(p)pro.bri.um. The first syllables of all these words are only partially closed, and the vowels are reduced.\n*The same phenomenon occurs after u, but note that the u is both closed and reduced: su.(p)pres.sor, su.(c)ces.sor, cu.(r)ri.cu.lum.\nSemi-open syllables\nSemiopen syllables are syllables that had been closed and unstressed, and that are followed by a sequence of consonants that can stand at the beginning of a syllable. Since instances of obstruents +r or l are already considered open, semiopen syllables are practically restricted to instances of s + obstruent, bl, and in some cases perhaps tl. Vowels in initial semiopen syllables may be treated as open for all purposes except for determining the value of u, which is still closed in semiopen syllables.\n*When s is followed by a consonant, s syllabifies with the following consonant: a.spa.ra.gus, pro.spec.tus, na.stur.ti.um, a.sphyc.si.a (asphyxia). S also syllabifies with a following palatalized c (pronounced ): a.sce.sis, pro.sce.ni.um. When s syllabifies with a following consonant, the preceding syllable counts as semi-open. Possible exceptions are pos.te.ri.or, tes.ta.tor.\n*Other sequences of consonants fully close an initial unstressed syllable and produce a short vowel: an.ten.na, am.ne.si.a, bac.te.ri.um, mag.ni.fi.cat, mac.sil.la (maxilla), spec.ta.tor, per.so.na, oph.thal.mi.a, tor.pe.do.\nSee further the section on initial unstressed syllables below.\nOpen syllables\nOpen syllables are those in which the nucleus is followed:\n* By no consonant at the end of the word: pro, qua.\n* By a vowel in the middle of a word : oph.thal.mi.a, fi.at, cor.ne.a, cha.os, chi.as.mus, a.ma.nu.en.sis.\n* By only a single consonant in the middle of a word: sta.men, æ.ther, hy.phen, phœ.nix, ter.mi.nus, a.pos.tro.phe.\n* By those consonant clusters that do not fully or partially close a syllable In the middle of a word :  ma.cron, du.plex, Cy.clops, tes.ta.trix, a.cro.po.lis.\nStress\nPrimary stress\nStress is another characteristic of syllables. In Anglo-Latin, it is marked by greater tension, higher pitch, lengthening of vowel, and (in certain cases) changes in vowel quality. Its exact concomitants in Classical Latin are uncertain. In Classical Latin the main, or primary stress is predictable, with a few exceptions, based on the following criteria:\n* In words of one syllable, stress falls on that syllable, as marked in the following syllables with an acute accent: quá, nón, pár.\n* In words of two syllables, stress falls on the first syllable of the word (the penult, or second from the end): e.g., bó.nus, cír.cus.\n* In words of three or more syllables, stress falls either on the penult or the antepenult (third from the end), according to these criteria:\n** If the penult contains a short vowel in an open syllable, the stress falls on the antepenult: e.g., stá.mi.na, hy.pó.the.sis.\n** If the penult contains a long vowel; a diphthong; a closed syllable (with any length of vowel); or is followed by z, the stress falls on the penult.\n*** Long vowel: cicāda > cicáda, exegēsis > exegésis.\n*** Diphthong: amóeba, Acháia, paranóia, thesáurus\n*** Closed syllable: aórta, interrégnum, prospéctus, rotúnda\n***z: horízon\nPrimary stress can therefore be determined in cases where the penult is either closed or contains a diphthong. When it contains a vowel that may have been either short or long in Classical Latin, stress is ambiguous. Since Anglo-Latin does not distinguish short from long vowels, stress becomes a lexical property of certain words and affixes. The fact that decorum is stressed on the penult, and exodus on the antepenult, is a fact about each of these words that must be memorized separately (unless one is already familiar with the Classical quantities, and in the former case, additionally with the fact that decus -ŏris n. with short -o- syllable became in late Latin decus/decor -ōris m. with long -o- syllable: Dómine, diléxi decórem domus tuæ).\nSecondary stress\nSecondary stress is dependent upon the placement of the primary stress. It appears only in words of four or more syllables. There may be more than one secondary stress in a word; however, stressed syllables may not be adjacent to each other, so there is always at least one unstressed syllable between the secondary and primary stress. Syllables containing semivowel e or i are never stressed.\n* If a four-syllable word has primary stress on the antepenult, there is no secondary stress: pa.rá.bo.la, me.tá.the.sis.\n* If a four-syllable word has primary stress on the penult, secondary stress is on the first syllable, marked hereafter with a grave accent: à.la.bás.ter, è.pi.dér.mis, sì.mu.lá.crum, prò.pa.gán.da, ùl.ti.má.tum.\n* If a 5-syllable word has primary stress on the antepenult, secondary stress is on the first syllable: hìp.po.pó.ta.mus, Sà.git.tá.ri.us, Phì.la.dél.phi.a.\nSecondary stress in words with three or more syllables before the primary stress is less predictable. Such words include those of five syllables with penult primary stress, and all words of six syllables in length or longer. The following generalizations about such long words may be made:\n* The syllable immediately before the primary stress is never stressed.\n* Words produced by derivation from a shorter word convert the primary (and, if any, secondary) stress of the stem into a secondary stress, as long as it does not fall immediately before the new primary stress: é.le.phant- + í.a.sis becomes è.le.phan.tí.a.sis\n* Compounds of which the compound element consists of more than one syllable likewise convert the primary stress of their elements into secondary stress: phár.ma.co- + póei.a becomes phàr.ma.co.póei.a.\n* If a primary stress is eliminated in compounding or derivation because it would stand next to another stress, secondary stress remains unchanged: pùsillánimus + itas becomes pùsillanímitas.\n* Single-syllable prefixes and single-syllable compound elements are generally unstressed: ac.cù.mu.lá.tor, im.pè.di.mén.ta, Her.mà.phro.dí.tus\n* In other cases where the composition of the word may be unclear, every other syllable before the primary stress may be stressed: a.mà.nu.én.sis, ò.no.mà.to.póei.a. In some cases the third syllable before the primary stress is stressed when the second syllable is light, just as when assigning the primary stress.\nUnstress\nUnstressed syllables are all others. They are always adjacent to a stressed syllable; that is, there can never be more than two unstressed syllables in a row, and that only when the first one follows a stressed syllable.\nSemivowel\nSeveral sound-changes in Anglo-Latin are due to the presence of the \"semivowel\", an alteration of certain front vowels. Originally ordinary vowels, they acquired at different points in history the value of the glide  (a y-sound like that in English canyon). Subsequently, their value has fluctuated through history between a consonant and a vowel; the term \"semivowel\" thus reflects the intermediate historical as well as phonetic position of this sound. The environment in which the semivowel was produced was as follows:\n# The vowel was e (æ, œ), i (ei), or y.\n# The vowel came immediately before a vowel or diphthong.\n# The vowel was not in the initial syllable: e, æ, ei, i and y in rhea, mæander, meiosis, fiat, diaspora, hyæna,  did not become semivowels.\n# The vowel was unstressed: e, æ, œ, ei, i in idea, Piræus, diarrhœa, Cassiopeia, calliope, elephantiasis did not become semivowels.\nExamples of words where e, i, y became semivowels include: miscellanea, chamæleon, nausea, geranium, rabies, Aries, acacia, ratio, fascia, inertia, halcyon, polyanthus, semiosis, mediator, Æthiopia, Ecclesiastes.\nThe effects of the semivowel include the following:\n# Though always in hiatus with a following vowel, semivowel i and y are never pronounced like long i or y (e.g. ); historically semivowel e could also be distinguished from \"long e\" (formerly  or ). In current varieties of Anglo-Latin, semivowels are pronounced in a variety of ways:\n#* Most frequently as : labia, radius, azalea, præmium, cornea, opium, Philadelphia, requiem, area, excelsior, symposium, Cynthia, trivia, trapezium. In British Received Pronunciation, the prescribed pronunciation was once .\n#* In some dialects or registers of English as , e.g. junior pronounced .\n#* Merged with a following -es or -e ending, as in Aries, scabies.\n#* They are usually deleted following the palatals , , and : Patricia, consortium, Persia, nausea, ambrosia, Belgium.\n#*Occasionally a semivowel is retained after a palatal sound: ratio, sometimes Elysium. This type of pronunciation is an artificiality, as the sounds  and  resulted from an absorption of the original  in the sequences , . The pronunciations with  and  result from a re-introduction of the i sound to conform with the spelling. This pronunciation was, however, recommended by academics, and as such is common in the pronunciation of Anglo-Latin phrases such as ab initio, in absentia, venire facias.\n# The consonant t changed to  and then to  before the semivowel arising from i: minutia, inertia, nasturtium.\n# The sibilants  (including ss, sc, c, and t) and  (usually spelled s) are usually palatalized before the semivowel:\n#*  > : cassia, fascia, species, militia\n#*  > : amnesia, ambrosia\n# The vowels a, e, æ, and o in an open antepenult syllable become long if a semivowel appears in the next syllable:\n#* radius, Asia, azalea, area\n#* anæmia, chamæleon\n#* genius, medium, interior\n#* odium, cochlea, victoria\n:This lengthening takes place regularly in antepenultimate syllables. It is less regular in syllables further back. On the one hand, there are words that do seem to lengthen before a semivowel in the next syllable:\n:* Æthiopia, Ecclesiastes, mediator, negotiator, variorum.\n:On the other hand, some words have short vowels:\n:* gladiator, apotheosis, Meleagrus, polyanthus (and other words containing poly- followed by a vowel).\n:In general, those words with lengthened vowels in pre-antepenult syllables before a semivowel in the next syllable are those that are derive from a word with a regularly lengthened vowel in an antepenult syllable, e.g., Æthiopia from Æthiops (\"Ethiopian\"), Ecclesiastes from ecclesia (\"church\"), mediator from medium, negotiator from negotium (\"business'), variorum from varius (\"manifold\"). The failure of gladiator (from gladius, \"sword\") to have a long vowel is anomalous.\nVowels\nMergers\nThe most notable distinction between Anglo-Latin and other varieties of Latin is in the treatment of the vowels. In Anglo-Latin, all original distinctions between long and short vowels have been obliterated; there is no distinction between the treatment of a and ā, etc., for instance. However, the subsequent development of the vowels depended to a large degree upon Latin word stress (which was preserved nearly unchanged in the medieval period), and as this was in part dependent upon vowel length, in certain cases Latin vowel length contrasts have been preserved as contrasts in both stress and quality. However, the immediate governing factor is not length but stress: short vowels that were stressed for various reasons are treated exactly like stressed long vowels.\nIn addition to the merger of long and short vowels, other vowel mergers took place:\n* the diphthongs æ and œ merged with e\n* the vowels i and y merged\n* the diphthong ei (also æi, œi), when still written distinctively, in pronunciation was merged with i or (more frequently) e\nThe merger of æ and œ with e was commonly recognized in writing. Sometimes forms written with æ and œ coexist with forms with e; in other cases the form with e has superseded the diphthong in Anglo-Latin. Consider the following:\n* æon and eon, æther and ether, amœba and ameba, anæmia and anemia, anæsthesia and anesthesia, cæsura and cesura, chamæleon and chameleon, dæmon and demon, diæresis and dieresis, encyclopædia and encyclopedia, fæces and feces, fœtus and fetus, hyæna and hyena, prætor and pretor\nThe following words are usually spelled with e, though they originally had æ:\n* ænigma > enigma, æquilibrium > equilibrium, æra > era, Æthiopia > Ethiopia, diarrhœa > diarrhea, mæander > meander, musæum > museum, œsophagus > esophagus, pæninsula > peninsula, præcentor > precentor, prædecessor > predecessor, præmium > premium, præsidium > presidium, tædium > tedium\nIn other cases, particularly names, the forms with the diphthongs are the only correct spelling, e.g., ægis, Cæsar, Crœsus, Œdipus, onomatopœia, pharmacopœia, Phœbe, phœnix, Piræus, sub pœna.\nThe sequences ei, æi, œi (distinguished in writing and pronunciation from ej, the vowel followed by a consonant, as in Sejanus) are sometimes retained in spelling preceding a vowel. In such cases the sequence is invariably pronounced as a simple vowel, sometimes i (as in meiosis, pronounced as if miosis), sometimes e (as in Cassiopeia, Deianira, onomatopœia, pronounced as if Cassiopea, Deanira, onomatopea), and sometimes either (Pleiades, commonly pronounced as if Pleades or Pliades).\nThe result was a system of five vowels, a, e, i, o, u. These would subsequently split, according to their environment, into long, short, and (eventually) unstressed variants; and these variants would eventually also be altered based on neighboring sounds. However, in phonemic terms, Anglo-Latin still has only five vowels, with multiple allophones.\nIn addition, there were the diphthongs, ai, oi, ui, au and eu. Of these, ai and au eventually monophthongized, eu merged with the open variant of u, and yi merged with the \"long\" i. Only oi and ui remained as true diphthongs, but both are extremely rare.\nRealizations of a, e, i and o\nThe vowels a, e, i, o each have three primary variants: long, short, and reduced. Each of these may, in turn, exhibit allophonic variation based on features of its phonetic environment, including whether it is stressed, whether it is in an open or closed syllable, where it is positioned in the word, and what consonants are next to it. One of the most common environmental causes of vowel alteration is the presence of a following r. Vowels altered by a following \"r\" are called \"r-colored\".\nShort vowels\nThis is the default value for vowels, observed:\n#In closed monosyllables\n# In stressed closed penult syllables\n#In all antepenult syllables, open or closed, which receive primary stress, except for those lengthened due to a following semivowel\n#In all syllables with secondary stress\n#In fully closed unstressed syllables which immediately precede, but do not follow, a primary or secondary stress (usually in the first syllable of a word), with exceptions for certain prefixes\nAll short vowels have variants colored by a following r sound when the r is followed by a different consonant (not r) or by the end of the word. In addition, there is a variant of short a that only appears after a  sound – chiefly found in the sound qu . This is a relatively recent phonetic development in English and Anglo-Latin, so it wasn't present in earlier stages of Anglo-Latin.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Short vowels\n! IPA\n! Type 1\n!

This pronunciation is borrowed from that of -es used as an ending.\nExceptions to the pronunciation of short y generally involve prefixed elements beginning with hy- in an open syllable, such as hydro- and hypo-; these are always pronounced with a long y, e.g. hydrophobia, hypochondria. This pronunciation is the result of hypercorrection; they used to be pronounced with a short , as is still the case in the word \"hypocrite\" and (for some speakers and formerly commonly) hypochondria.\nPrefixes may also behave in anomalous ways:\n# The prefix ob- in unstressed syllables may be reduced to , even when it closes a syllable: cf. \"obsession, oblivion\".\n# The Greek prefix en-, em- in a closed unstressed syllable may be reduced to , : encomium, emporium.\n# The prefix ex- in an unstressed syllable may be reduced to , , despite always being in a closed syllable: exterior, exemplar.\n# The prefix con-, com- is reduced to ,  when unstressed: consensus, compendium, regardless of whether the syllable is closed or not.\n# The preposition and prefix post(-) is anomalously pronounced with \"long o\": : post-mortem and cf. \"postpone\"; also thus in words in which post was originally a preposition (postea, postquam) but not in other derivatives, being pronounced with short o in posterus, posterior, postremo, postridie.\nLong vowels\nLong vowels are those that historically were lengthened. By virtue of subsequent sound changes, most of these are now diphthongs, and none is distinguished by vowel length&mdash;however, the term \"long\" for these vowels is traditional. \"Long\" vowels appear in three types of environments:\n# a, e, i and o are long in an open monosyllable\n# a, e, i and o are long in a stressed open penult syllable\n# a, e and o are long when in an open syllable followed by semivocalic i and e\n# a and o are long when they precede another vowel in hiatus; i and e are long in the same environments, but only when they are not semivocalic (i.&nbsp;e., when they are in the initial syllable or receive primary stress).

Two different types of variation can be distinguished; the older use of a \"long\" vowel for i, y, o (and their variants); and more recent variations in the value of the reduced vowel.\nNo completely general rule can be laid down for the appearance of an initial unstressed long vowel, although such vowels must have appeared before the shortening of geminate consonants, as they are restricted to fully open syllables. The most general tendency is for long vowels to appear when i and y are either preceded by no consonant or by h, e.g., idea, isosceles, hyperbola, hypothesis. The prefixes in and syn never have long vowels: inertia, synopsis. I and y also tend to be short when the next syllable contains an i or y, short or long: militia, divisor.\nO is a little less likely to appear with a long value in this location; or, at any rate, it is harder to distinguish the long value from the reduced vowel.\nUnstressed e and i in open syllables had merged by the early 17th century; their reduced reflex is often transcribed , but by many speakers is still pronounced as a high front lax vowel, distinct from the  derived from a, here transcribed .

The only diphthongs that are at all common are au and eu. For variations in the pronunciation of the latter, see Open u. Au is, rarely, reduced in an unstressed syllable to : Augustus pronounced as if \"Agustus\". Such words may be pronounced with the full value of the diphthong, however.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The monosyllabic words cui and huic were traditionally pronounced  and .\nIn general, ua, ue, ui, uo, and uu come immediately after q, g, or s. However, when they occur in the same syllable, as in suavitas, questus, anguis, aliquot, and equus, they are not considered diphthongs (except in the exceptional pronunciations of cui, huic, and the above examples). Accordingly, when these letter combinations occur in the penultimate syllable, it is not necessarily stressed (e.g., équitas, not equítas). Note that their second vowel may become reduced, r-colored, or take on a different quantity even in a monosyllable.\nEndings\nThe pronunciation of the final syllables of polysyllabic words do not always correspond to what might be expected from the constituent phonemes. Some endings also have more than one pronunciation, depending upon the degree of stress given to the ending.\nThree types of endings can be distinguished:\nVowel alone\nThe first class consists of vowels alone, i.e. -a, -e, -æ, -i, -o, -u, -y.

That this was not the usual pronunciation can be told from such forms as circa, infra, extra, in absentia, sub pœna, all of which have an originally long final vowel: circā, sub pœnā, etc. This use is distinct from the older tradition (in use in the 17th-18th centuries) had made all final a's \"long\", regardless of their Latin length.\nVowel before a consonant cluster\nThe second class consists of vowels followed by consonant clusters such as ns, nt, nx, ps, x. In this class, the vowels are always short, except for u, which may be reduced to .\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Letter\n! IPA\n!

The treatment of these endings is inconsistent. Generalizations include:\n# All vowels are reduced before final r for : Cæsar, pauper, triumvir, Mentor, sulfur, martyr.\n# All vowels are reduced to  before l: tribunal, Babel, pugil, consul.\n# Except sometimes before t, a is reduced to  before any of this class of consonant: animal, memoriam, titan, atlas.\n# All instances of u are reduced to  before any of this class of consonant: consul, dictum, locus.\nThe remaining endings are: -at, -em, -en, -es, -et, -im, -is, -it, -on, -os, -ot. Of these, -em, -im, -is, -it, -on, -ot have two possible pronunciations, one with a short vowel and one with . Final -es and -ies are alike pronounced . Final -eus, when derived from Greek -ευς -eus (as in Proteus) rather than from -εος -eos with the -os changed to -us in Latin, may be pronounced as a single syllable with a diphthong (), or as two syllables with a long (though unstressed) e followed by -us (). However, even when pronounced as two syllables, -eus counts as a single syllable for the purpose of determining vowel length – that is, the syllable preceding the -eus ending is considered the penult, just as happens in derivatives ending in -ian – though the placement of the stress shifts. E.g. Ἰλιονεύς Īlioneus  .\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Ending\n! IPA\n!

It generally conflates with  in RP and with schwa in Australia.\nThis last pronunciation of -os is the expected one; however, in the masculine accusative plural, where the ending is historically -ōs, the academic prescription was the pronunciation . Such an ending is not found in English loan words or proper names.\nAdjectives in -an and -ic\nEnglish adjectives formed from Greek and Latin roots often end in a suffix -an or -ic added to the oblique stem, sometimes retaining a preceding thematic vowel. These produce generally predictable sound changes in the stem though, depending on its source or simply due to confusion, English -ean may be either stressed or unstressed. The first derives from the Latin adjectival suffix -ānus, though it has far wider application in English than in Latin. (Pythian, for example, translates the Latin adjective Pythius.) The other suffix, -ic, derives from the Greek adjectival suffix -ικος -ĭkos.\nThe fact that these suffixes are added to the oblique stem is relevant with words of the third declension whose stems end in a consonant that alters or disappears in the nominative case, as is apparent in such English noun–adjective pairs as Pallas ~ Palladian, Mars ~ Martian, Venus ~ Venerian, and indeed from non-adjectival derivatives of these words such as 'palladium'. Some roots have more than one oblique stem, in which case they may have more than one adjectival form in English.\n;Stressed vowel plus -an and unstressed -ian\nThe forms of these suffixes depends on the first vowel of the nominal suffix in Latin or Greek. The resulting forms are carried over into Latin from Greek, and into English from Latin. English adjectives in -ean, where the e is inherited from the Greek, are stressed on the suffix, but there are also adjectives in -ean where the e originates in Latin, and those are not stressed.\n{|\n|+ Nominal and adjectival suffixes\n!

An example is Sisyphus:\n*Greek Sīsyphos > adjective Sīsyphios > Latin Sīsyphius > English 'Sisýphian'\n* (or, alternatively) > adjective Sīsypheios > Latin Sīsyphēus > English 'Sisyphéan'\nIn the opposite direction, ē-vowel Aristotelēs produces 'Aristotḗlian' alongside expected 'Aristoteléan'.\nThe final iota subscript in Greek feminine words ending in -ῳ -ōi is frequently omitted in Latin, – if an 'i' appears in English it may be taken directly from the Greek, – but words that end in plain -ω -ō in Greek may also have Greek adjectives in -ōios if the 'i' was historically present.\n;Unstressed -ean\nThere is another suffix spelled -ean in English, but this one unstressed. It corresponds to the unstressed Latin adjectival suffix -ĕus and does not derive from Greek. An example is Latin Herculēs > Latin adj. Herculĕus > English 'Hercúlean', alongside Greek Hēraklēs > Greek adj. Hērakleios > Latin Hēraclēus/Hēraclīus > English 'Heracléan'. The stress assignment of the 'Herculean' has been affected by 'Heraclean' (or perhaps simply by the ambiguity of having two suffixes spelled '-ean'), so the mixed form 'Herculéan' is now also heard.\n;Adjectives in -ic\nThe Greek suffix -ικος -ĭkos replaces the vowels of nominal endings apart from retaining a or ō, which will be stressed in English. Stress assignment (and the corresponding vowel quality) of English follows the Latin, as though the suffix were -icus in English as well and the last syllable of the stem were the antepenult when it English it's actually the penult. Thus English 'Homeric' is pronounced with a short stressed penultimate e, when in other English words from Latin an e in that position would be pronounced long. (Cf. botanic, which has the same stressed 'a' and same vowel quality as botanical.)\n{|\n|+ Nominal and adjectival suffixes\n! Greek noun !! Greek adj. !! Latin adj. !!

Kȳrēnaikos > Latin Cȳrēnaicus).\nHistory\nLatin as traditionally pronounced by English speakers is part of the living history of spoken Latin through medieval French into English.\nThree stages of development of Anglo-Latin can thus be distinguished:\nNote: The English pronunciation of Latin varies with accent as much as English itself, as the two's phonological systems are inseparably connected. For convenience's sake, the list below will end with approximately a received pronunciation accent. As the traditional pronunciation of Latin has evolved alongside English since the Middle Ages, the page detailing English's phonological evolution from Middle English (in this case, from the Middle-English-Latin pronunciation roughly midway through the 1400-1600 section) can give a better idea of what exactly has happened, and this is just an overview.\nStage I\nLatin from the period when its orthography and grammar became standardized through to the pronunciation changes of Late Latin, while it was still a living language. Changes that took place in this period included:\n* the merger of f and ph as\n* the change in pronunciation of v (formerly ) to  and of j (formerly ) to .\n* the merger of i and y as\n* the merger of e, æ and œ as\n* the change of non-initial, unstressed, prevocalic  and  to\n* the loss of distinctions of vowel length (merger of all long and short vowels)\n* the palatalization of t to  before\nStage II\nLatin spoken in the context of Gallo-Romance and French from approximately the 6th to the 11th-12th centuries. During this period, Latin became a primarily written language, separated from the ordinary spoken language of the people. While it escaped many of the changes of pronunciation and grammar of Gallo-Romance, it did share a few of the changes of the spoken language. This was for the most part a period of stability.\nChanges in this period included:\n* the palatalization of c and g to  and  before front vowels\n* the voicing of intervocalic s to\n* the fronting of u to\n* the restoration (based on spelling) of the vowels  and  from\nStage III\nLatin spoken in the context of English from the 11th/12th centuries to the present. This last stage provides the greatest and most complicated number of changes. It starts with the displacement of the native pronunciation of Latin under the Anglo-Saxon kings with that used in the north of France, around the time of the Norman conquest in 1066. The English and French pronunciations of Latin were probably identical down to the 13th century, but subsequently Latin as spoken in England began to share in specifically English sound changes. Latin, thus naturalized, acquired a distinctly English sound, increasingly different from the pronunciation of Latin in France or elsewhere on the Continent. For  example, Arthur, Prince of Wales and Catherine of Aragon corresponded for two years in Latin, but when they met in 1501 they  found that they could not understand each other's spoken conversation, because they had learned different Latin pronunciations.\nSome phases of development in this third stage can be reconstructed:\n1200–1400\n* The adaptation of the French sounds to English:\n**  was substituted for . (The French sound changed at about the same time; however, Anglo-Latin did not share related French simplifications such as  > .)\n** the vowels were given the values a , e , i , o , u\n**  was substituted for  in closed syllables, e.g. lux  > . [y] did not substitute out as [u] in unstressed open syllables, as it would have if the [y]~[u] distinction was solely length based: saeculum\n** At some point in the Middle English period, the distinctly French vowel  was substituted with the English diphthong . It is unclear when exactly this happened, and may have always been the English pronunciation of French (and consequently Latin) u.\n* Stressed open penultimate vowels were lengthened, creating the short/long contrasts:\n::a :, e (also ae, oe) :, i (also y) :, o :, u :\n1400–1600\n* Merger of unstressed open  with\n* Non-syllable-initial, unstressed, prevocalic  became  (a change almost identical to that of Late Latin)\n* Lengthening of the first of two vowels in hiatus\n* Lengthening of e , i , or o  in pretonic initial syllables\n* Diphthongization of  to\n* Lengthening of vowels in open syllables before  in the next syllable\n* Raising of  and  to  and .\n* Degemination of geminate consonants\n* Palatalization of  and  before\n* Fronting of  to\n1600–1800\n* Monophthongization of ai to  and au to\n* Change of  to  (later > ) in many words, restoring original syllabicity.\n* Change of fronted u () to\n* Palatalization of  before (usually unstressed)  (later > )\n* Lowering (and unrounding in the case of ) of short ,  to ,\n* Tensing of short e  to\n* Former long i  becomes\n* Fronting and raising of short a , long a , and long e  to   , creating the new contrasts: a : , e :, i :, o :\n* Beginning of vowel reductions to .\n* Short e, i and u before R; i.e. ,  and  are all merged to . (the NURSE merger)\n* Short a  is lowered and lengthened before r in a closed syllable, ultimately reaching modern\n1800–present\n* Breaking of  and  to diphthongs  and , and then laxing to  and the latter further to\n* In non-rhotic accents, syllable-final r  becomes a vowel . The vowel-R sequences simplify somewhat: arC  > , orC  > , erC, irC, urC  > .\n* Continued reduction of unstressed vowels to .\n* Shortening of a in a stressed open penult syllable, e.g., data (not for all speakers)\nOther languages\nA similar situation occurred in other regions, where the pronunciation of the local language influenced the pronunciation of Latin, eventually being replaced with reconstructed classical pronunciation. In German-speaking areas, traditional Germanized pronunciation of Latin is discussed at Deutsche Aussprache des Lateinischen , with reconstructed classical pronunciation at Schulaussprache des Lateinischen .\nReferences in literature\nIn Rattigan's play Separate Tables the following conversation takes place between Major Pollock, who has been lying about his background, and Mr Fowler, a retired schoolmaster:\n:Pollock: . . . Still, those days are past and gone. Eheu fugaces, Postume, Postume.\n:Fowler: (Correcting his accent) Eheu fugaces, Postume, Postume. Didn't they teach you the new pronunciation at Wellington?\n:Pollock: No. The old.\n:Fowler: When were you there?\n:Pollock: Now, let's think. It must have been nineteen eighteen I went up—\n:Fowler: But they were using the new pronunciation then, I know. . . .\nIn Goodbye, Mr. Chips, Chips says: \"Well, I—umph—I admit that I don't agree with the new pronunciation. I never did. Umph—a lot of nonsense, in my opinion. Making boys say 'Kickero' at school when— umph—for the rest of their lives they'll say 'Cicero'—if they ever—umph—say it at all. And instead of 'vicissim'— God bless my soul—you'd make them say, 'We kiss 'im'! Umph— umph!\"\nIn a fictional case Rex v. Venables and Others in A. P. Herbert's Uncommon Law, after a barrister uses phrases such as \"ooltrah weerayze\" (ultra vires) and \"preemah fakiay\" (prima facie) with the new Classics pronunciation he was taught at school, the Lord Chief Justice says \"You are not to be blamed, Mr. Wick. But I am bound to make it clear to you, to the rest of your gallant generation and to the generations that come after, that His Majesty's judges will not permit the speaking of the Latin tongue after that fashion in the King's Courts. I cannot hear you, Mr. Wick, for the very good reason that I cannot understand you. We are using different languages. ... The bitter conclusion is, Mr. Wick, that you must go away and learn to pronounce the Latin tongue correctly, according to the immemorial practice of your profession.\"\nSources\n* Andrews, E.
