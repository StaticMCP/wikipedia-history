It was made available by Atari Games in 1985 as a conversion kit for the original game. As in Star Wars, the player takes the role of Luke Skywalker in a set of battle sequences from a first-person perspective. The game features the Battle of Hoth and the subsequent escape of the Millennium Falcon through an asteroid field. It is the third Star Wars arcade title from Atari; the raster game Return of the Jedi came out the previous year.\nHome ports were released by Domark for the Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro, ZX Spectrum, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and Amiga.\nGameplay\nThe Imperial walkers stage\nIn the Hoth sequences, the player is flying a Rebel snowspeeder. The first section has the player patrolling in a search and destroy mission for Probots (Imperial Probe Droids). Imperial transmissions emanating from the Probots can be shot to prolong the stage. Once the transmission is completed, the player advances. To earn a Jedi letter, the player must eradicate the specified number of probots.\nThe second snowspeeder sequence involves the assault of AT-AT and AT-ST walkers against the Rebel shield generator. The walkers have to be either destroyed or avoided, as collisions will damage the aircraft. The player has four tow-cables which can be used to take down the AT-AT walkers instantly if fired at their legs. Otherwise, the player has to aim for the red cockpits to destroy the walkers. To earn a Jedi letter, the player must eradicate the specified number of walkers.\nIn the second half of the game, the player takes on the role of Han Solo piloting at the head of a convoy trying to escape the Imperial onslaught. First, the player encounters a swath of TIE fighters. To earn a Jedi letter, the player must eradicate the specified number of TIE fighters. When enough time expires, the player moves on to an asteroid field, where the goal is simply to survive. To earn a Jedi letter, the player must make it through the field without dying. Once the fourth stage is completed, the game starts back at the beginning of the Battle of Hoth on a higher difficulty level.\nCollecting all four Jedi letters instantly erases every enemy shot from the screen for a short time, and also adds a rank insignia next to the player's initials if they reach the high-score list. The player begins the game with a deflector shield that can absorb a set number of hits from enemies or projectiles before collapsing. If the player sustains a hit with the shield down, the game ends.\nVector objects are now much more noticeably detailed, and the asterisk-particle enemy shots resembling snowflakes from Star Wars are replaced with simpler and clearer vector star-shapes instead.\nReception\nAccording to the creators, the game received less attention as it was not as fresh as the previous game. Additionally, it was sold as an upgrade kit, so arcade operators that had Star Wars running and getting steady incomes from it did not go for the upgrade.\nLegacy\nThe game is included as an unlockable extra on Star Wars Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike for the GameCube.\nSee also\n* The Empire Strikes Back, a different game for the Atari 2600 and Intellivision based on the movie\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://gameroomblog.com/reviews/rare-game-room-gems-empire-strikes-back The GameRoom Blog: Rare Game Room Gems — Empire Strikes Back]"
