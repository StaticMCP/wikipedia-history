However, thanks to Tatsunoko Productions' continuous production of mecha action works such as Hurricane Polymar and Tekkaman: The Space Knight, he was able to continue his career as a mecha designer under Nakamura.\nHe designed his first main mecha in Gowappa 5 Gōdam. Until Tekkaman, Nakamura designed the main mecha and Okawara took care of the other sub-mechas, but Nakamura did not participate in this work and Okawara designed all the mecha, not just the main ones.\nOkawara worked for Tatsunoko as an employee for three years and became a part-time designer in his fourth year.\nSo he began to market himself to Sunrise, which had been on his radar for some time.\nHe came up with a transformation mechanism for Invincible Steel Man Daitarn 3 in response to a request from Eiji Yamaura, head of Sunrise's planning office and later president, and actually made his own mockup and presented it to the sponsors. Negotiations went well and he began to receive orders from Sunrise afterwards.\nMeanwhile, he continued to work with Tatsunoko after leaving the company, designing every guest mecha in Yatterman, the second series of Time Bokan series, and he replaced Nakamura to design the second main mecha, Yatterking, which appeared mid-series. He designed all the mecha from this onwards until the end of the series.\nAt the end of 1976, Nakamura left Tatsunoko, so Okawara co-founded Design Office Mechaman with him.\nAlthough Okawara still had less work (about one third of Nakamura's), he was paid the same salary as Nakamura because he had invested the same amount in the company as Nakamura. Okawara felt bad for Nakamura about it and went freelance a year later.\nOkawara was in charge of mecha design for the 1979 Sunrise production Mobile Suit Gundam, directed by Yoshiyuki Tomino, and designed Mobile Suit (MS), the robots that appeared in the series.\nThe die-cast metal character toys sold by Clover, the sponsor at the time of its broadcast, suffered poor sales and the show was discontinued.\nHowever, the programme gradually gained popularity through re-runs, and model magazines began to publish dioramas of battlefields created by readers using scratch-building techniques.\nBandai took note of this and launched a plastic model kits in 1980, which became an unprecedented hit, causing a social phenomenon in which products continued to be out of stock nationwide.\nThis was followed by the launch of the plastic model brand MSV (Mobile Suit Variations), a spin-off of the TV series designed by Okawara, and the boom continued until the mid-1980s.\nSunrise had commissioned designs from Studio Nue before Gundam, but animation director Yoshikazu Yasuhiko had disliked Studio Nue's insistence on sci-fi settings and their complex design proposals for some time, and wanted them removed from the project. That was why the emerging Mechaman, Okawara and Nakamura, were chosen.\nOkawara had joined the project halfway through, so the image of the work was not fully conveyed to him.\nSo Yasuhiko first drew a rough design based on an illustration of a Powered Suit designed by Kazutaka Miyatake in the Japanese edition of Robert A. Heinlein's science fiction novel Starship Troopers.\nOkawara then drew a design based on the space suit motif, but both were rejected as not suitable for the lead role.\nOkawara proposed a new robot with a samurai motif, which was the original idea for Gundam.\nYasuhiko modified that design overall, including covering the mouth with a mask, cleaning up it, and changing its coloring, and the Gundam design was born.\nThe sponsors wanted three different robots on the hero's side, so Okawara cleaned up Yasuhiko's design to create Guncannon, and then designed Guntank anew.\nWhile the design was being finalised, Okawara was taken by Yamaura to Clover to present the mechanism of the combined and transformable toy, which made a good impression on them.\nEnemy robots, on the other hand, were generally not intended for commercialisation at the time, and sponsors had fewer restrictions.\nTomino told Okawara that he could do whatever he wanted except for Mono-Eye, so he freely designed Zaku, Gouf, Dom, and other MS.\nWhen these enemy mecha, which were never intended to be toys, were released as plastic models, their design and concept, reminiscent of real weapons, met the demand of plastic model fans and became very popular.\nIn the second half of the season, Tomino, who was getting into the swing of things, began to draw his own rough designs, and Okawara, who was busy with other work, began to clean up the designs as they were.\nFor this reason, Okawara says that Tomino's contribution is also significant.\nOkawara then went on to design many Real Robots for Sunrise's TV anime series in the 1980s. After Gundam he continued to work with Bandai on Combat Mecha Xabungle and Ginga Hyōryū Vifam. In those series, Okawara was now in a position to design the main mecha, while young designers such as Yutaka Izubuchi and Mamoru Nagano designed other sub-mechas.\nSeeing Bandai's success, Takara approached Okawara to sell plastic model kits themselves, and they produced Fang of the Sun Dougram. Okawara designed the main robot, Combat Armour, without the human-like face and with a more military look than the Gundam.\nThe plastic models sold so well that the TV series was extended and all CB Armour was included in the product line-up, as well as tanks, helicopters and even trailers.\nThis gave Okawara even more challenging robot designs for the next Armored Trooper Votoms.\nOkawara was initially not scheduled to participate in the second Gundam series, Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, which was broadcast in 1985. This was because Tomino, who wanted to renew the design line, appointed Mamoru Nagano as the main designer, who alone would handle all the designs, including costumes and props, as well as the mecha.\nHowever, Nagano was removed from the Gundam design team before the show even started because of the sponsors' protests against his innovative designs. It was then decided that newcomer Kazumi Fujita would be selected and Okawara would return.\nWhile Fujita designed and cleaned up Zeta Gundam and other MS, Okawara designed the Gundam Mark II and several MS as a helper, and left the rest to younger workers.\nOkawara did not participate in the subsequent Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ and the film ''Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack, and Tomino again appointed Nagano as the main designer. However, Nagano was not only removed as Gundam designer for both works, but was also dropped from his position as main designer.\nMakoto Kobayashi designed Gundam ZZ, and Yutaka Izubuchi designed Nu Gundam for Char's Counterattack.\nIn 1991, Okawara returned as the main mecha designer for Mobile Suit Gundam F91'', in response to Sunrise's desire to return to its roots with the original staff. Since then, he has participated continuously in the Gundam series.\nWhen the 1990s saw a renewed demand for Hero Robots to replace Real Robots of the 1980s, he responded by designing Brave series of robots. At the same time, he also designed comically deformed robots such as the 2-head high SD Gundam.\nOkawara later expanded his activities beyond animation, working with industrial manufacturers and local authorities.\nIn recent years, he has been active both in Japan and abroad, designing the mascot character Inagi Nansuke for his home city of Inagi, Tokyo, the futuristic micro-mobility Machina, figures for offers from abroad, and a head-mounted display with a small camera, a work by Mathieu Briand, which was exhibited at the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa.\nHistory of works\n(Listed chronologically)\n*Science Ninja Team Gatchaman (1972–1974)\n:*Artist (enemy mechanical design)\n*Hurricane Polymer (1974)\n:*Mechanical design (Tatsunoko Mechaman Design Office)\n*Tekkaman: The Space Knight (1975)\n:*Mechanical design (Tatsunoko Mechaman Design Office)\n*Gowappā 5 Godam (1976)\n:*Primary mechanical design (Tatsunoko Mechaman Design Office)\n*Time Bokan (1976)\n*Blocker Gundan IV: Machine Blaster (1976)\n*Yattāman (1977)\n*Mechander Robo (1977)\n*Chōgattai Majutsu Robo Ginguiser (1977)\n*Tobidase!
