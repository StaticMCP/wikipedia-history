Standing on Broad Street, near its junction with Saracen Street, the building was built in 1752, the work of Thomas Jelly. It is now a Grade II* listed building, having been added in 1950.\nIt was King Edward's School from 1752 to 1990, after the school moved from the nave of the disused Church of St Mary's Northgate, where it had been for almost 200 years. In 1990, after just under 250 years, the junior school followed the secondary school's relocation to a new site on North Road at the southeastern edge of the city around 25 years earlier.\nIn 1997, an application to turn the building into a public house by Samuel Smith Old Brewery was refused, although it still owns the property. A scheme for use as a hotel has also been withdrawn.\nThe building remains on the Heritage at Risk Register. Proposals to use it as a temporary shelter for the homeless were rejected in 2018 by the brewery, claiming that work would be \"commencing very soon\". , it remains vacant and increasingly derelict, one of the most shocking examples of deliberate corporate neglect of a historic and architecturally significant building.\nArchitecture\nThe building, which stands on the former site of the Black Swann Inn, is two storeys with four dormers and five sash windows. It has a central pediment with a coat of arms and a central doorway with a pediment on Ionic half columns.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://issuu.com/kingedwardsschoolbath/docs/oelink2021-15-sp/s/13590848 \"As It Was in the Beginning\"] – Issuu"
