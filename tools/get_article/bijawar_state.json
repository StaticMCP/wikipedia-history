Forests covered nearly half the total area of the state, which was believed to be rich in minerals, but lack of transport facilities had hindered the development of its resources.\nHistory\nThe state takes its name from the chief town, Bijawar, which was founded by Bijai Singh, one of the Gond chiefs of Garha Mandla, in the 17th century. The first ruler of the state was Bir Singh Deo (1765–93). It was conquered in the 18th century by Chhatarsal, the founder of Panna, by whose descendants it is still held.\nBijawar became a British protectorate on March 27, 1811, and the rule of the territory was confirmed to Ratan Singh in 1811 by the British government for the usual deed of allegiance. In 1857 Bham Pratap Singh rendered signal services to the British during the Revolt of 1857, being rewarded with certain privileges and a hereditary salute of eleven guns. In 1866 he received the title of Maharaja, and the prefix Sawai in 1877. Bhan Pratap was succeeded on his death in 1899 by his adopted son, Sanwant Singh, a son of the Maharaja of Orchha.\nThe state acceded to India on January 1, 1950, and became part of the state of Vindhya Pradesh, which was merged into Madhya Pradesh on November 1, 1956.\nRulers\nThe rulers of the state belonged to the Bundela dynasty.\nRajas\n* 1765–1793: Bir Singh Deo\n* 1793–1802: Himmat Bahadur (usurper)\n* 1802–1810: Keshri Singh\n* 1811–1833: Ratan Singh\n* 1833–1847: Lakshman Singh\n* 1847–1877: Bham Pratap Singh\nSawai Maharajas\n* 1877–1899: Bham Pratap Singh\n* 1900–1940: Savant Singh\n* 1940–1947: Govind Singh\nTitular Maharaja\n* 1947–1983: Govind Singh\n* 1983–present: Jai Singh ju dev\nSee also\n*Panna State\n*Political integration of India\n*Bijawar-Panna Plateau\nReferences"
