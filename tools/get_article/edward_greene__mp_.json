He was a J.P. and Deputy Lieutenant for Suffolk and a master of the Suffolk Fox Hounds.\nGreene was elected at the 1865 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for Bury St Edmunds, and held the seat until the constituency was reduced to one member at the 1885 general election.\nHe did not stand in 1885, but at the 1886 general election he was elected for the Stowmarket constituency, and held that seat until his death in 1891, aged 75.\nGreene married firstly in 1840 Emily Smythies, daughter of Rev. G Smythies of Stanground near Peterborough, and secondly in 1870 Caroline Dorothea Hoste, daughter of Charles Prideaux Brune and widow of Rear Admiral Sir William Hoste.
