Among them, a special place is occupied by those that represent the development of art, such as the plastic monuments that are more frequent, and at the same time occupy an important place, because with the presentation of figures in relief and with numerous inscriptions they speak to us enough for this period.\nOverview\nDardania fell under Roman occupation in the first century AD, one of the last territories of Illyria to succumb. Being that Dardania had and today Kosovo has a central position between the road networks that connected the south Aegean with the Danube basin, and with the Adriatic Sea, it was a strategic jewel. It also was important for the Romans due to its rich mineral resources, which they exploited and benefited from. We see that most of the towns of ancient Dardania are located either close to a mine, or close to a road. The Dardanian identity has been disputed for a while, and it is known that it was distinctive, similar to the Illyrian, and also with a Roman or Thracian twist to it, due to the occupation and co-habitation. The archaeological surveys and studies of the last century are helping to establish this Dardanian identity in an objective manner, which will lead to a clearer study and explanation of the continuity of culture in this so much disputed region. Below is a listing of the prominent settlements during the Roman period and an explanation of what they were, when they were inhabited, and when they were founded, accompanied by an array of pictures that illustrate the archaeological finds and remnants.\nMunicipium Dardanorum\nMunicipium Dardanorum or Dardanicum is located in North Kosovo, approximately 27 kilometres north of Mitrovica, in the village of Sočanica, Leposavic municipality.

The site stretches in approximately 30 hectares.\nUlpiana\nUlpiana was a Roman town, established in the 1st century AD, receiving municipium status in 169 AD.\nVendenis\nStatio Vindenis was among three road stations that were constructed in Dardania during Roman rule.\nÇifllak archaeological site\nÇifllak site is situated near the Drini i Bardhë river stream, on the left side.\nDresnik archaeological site\nThe Archaeological Site of Dresnik is an archaeological site in the village of Dresnik.\nKllokot archaeological site\nThe site of Klokot is located close to Banja e Kllokotit.\nNerodime e Poshtme\nNerodimë e Poshtme site, uncovered in 1988.\nNikadin archaeological site\nNikadin.
