Due to the low annual rainfall, irrigation is used extensively.\nHistory\nYuwaalaraay (also known as Yuwalyai, Euahlayi, Yuwaaliyaay, Gamilaraay, Kamilaroi, Yuwaaliyaayi) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Yuwaalaraay country.

He is believed to have named the town using an Aboriginal word, meaning either broken forest country or chorus of frogs at night. The name may be derived from a Yuwaaliyaay dialect placename, Dhurrunbandaay, relating to dhurrun.gal (\"hairy caterpillars\") and baanda-y (\"move in single file\").\nOne hundred housing allotments were first set aside, followed by land for a police station, a state school, and post office.\nDirranbandi Provisional School opened on 9 June 1902, but closed in April 1905.

Noondoo railway station was approx  east of the town (); it was named by the Queensland Railways Department on 29 October after the Noondoo pastoral station which in turn is an Aboriginal name either for the spring near the homestead or the shrub growing near the spring.

Clayton was contracted to build an Anglican church in Dirranbandi to the design of Brisbane architect, S. W. Prior. It was intended to be serviced by the Bush Brotherhood.
