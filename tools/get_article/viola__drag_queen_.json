His initial drag style was inspired by Trixie Mattel, and his stage name, Viola, is a homage to the violin, an instrument that Stannard began playing at the age of seven. He additionally began playing the flute at age fourteen.\nViola was a contestant on the seventh series of ''RuPaul's Drag Race UK, where she placed in the bottom two on the second episode, but won a lip-sync contest against Pasty, and was safe from elimination. In the following episode, she placed in the bottom again; however, she lost a lip-sync against Nyongbella and became the second queen eliminated from the competition.\nPersonal life\nStannard was raised in Coventry and is currently based in Manchester. He attended Manchester Metropolitan University.\nFilmography\n* Queen of the Universe\n* RuPaul's Drag Race UK'' (series 7; 2025)\nReferences"
