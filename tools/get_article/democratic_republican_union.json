The party joined in the 1958 Puntofijo Pact, and its candidate in that year's presidential election, Wolfgang Larrazábal, was the runner-up. The party resigned from the Puntofijo Pact in 1962 in protest of the decision to exclude Cuba from the Organization of American States, which ended its time as a dominant political party. Its candidate Jóvito Villalba won 19% of the vote in the 1963 election, but only 3% in the 1973 election.\nPresidential candidates supported\nElections where the URD backed the winning candidate shown in bold.\n* 1952 election: Jóvito Villalba\n* 1958 election: Wolfgang Larrazábal (34.88% of vote)\n* 1963 election: Jóvito Villalba (18.89%)\n* 1968 election: Miguel Ángel Burelli Rivas (22.22%)\n* 1973 election: Jóvito Villalba (3.07%)\n* 1978 election: Luis Herrera Campins (COPEI candidate)\n* 1983 election: Jaime Lusinchi (Acción Democrática candidate)\n* 1988 election: Ismenia Villalba (0.84%)\n* 1993 election: Rafael Caldera (independent, backed by a coalition of anti-COPEI/Acción Democrática parties)\n* 1998 election: Luis Alfaro Ucero (0.60%)\n* 2000 election:\n* 2006 election: Manuel Rosales (A New Era candidate)\nReferences"
