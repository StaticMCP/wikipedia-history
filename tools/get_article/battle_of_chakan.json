Shaista Khan's Mughal forces emerged victorious by besieging the Chakan fort, leading to the surrender of the Maratha commander Firangoji.\nBattle\nIn 1660, Shaista Khan, the Mughal governor of Deccan invaded Pune, subsequently capturing and occupying the city. Consequently, he seized the northern segment of Shivaji's territories and stationed a garrison there. Shaista Khan was Aurangzeb's maternal uncle.\nThe fort of Chakan was under the Maratha leader Firangoji Narsala. Shaista Khan with his rajput commadars namely Rai Singh Sisodiya , ANVIT Singh Hada and Bhau Singh Hada marched towards the Chakan fort and besieged the fort for four months. The Mughals attacked and destroyed a part of wall by bombarding a mine. Chakan succumbed to a violent two-day assault, resulting in the massacre of most of the garrison, and Firangoji ultimately surrendered.}}\nReferences"
