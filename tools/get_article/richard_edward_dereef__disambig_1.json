      "text": "# Richard Edward Dereef__disambig_1\n\nRichard Edward Dereef (c. 1798–1876) was an African-American slave-owner, lumber trader, and politician.  A member of a wealthy family of mixed African and European descent, Dereef was a prominent member of South Carolinian society but was subject to discrimination due to his race. He was considered one of the wealthiest African-American men in Charleston, South Carolina and served as a city alderman during the Reconstruction era.\nBiography\nDereef was from a wealthy mixed race family in Charleston. Although well educated and wealthy, he was subject to discrimination due to his race. Unlike other freedmen, Dereef did not have to pay the Free Black Man's Tax, as he claimed Native American descent from his grandmother. In 1823 he and his cousin, John Cain, went to court and persuaded a Charleston magistrate that the Dereef and Cain families were legitimately descended from Native Americans, exempting them and their children from the tax.\nHe and his brother, Joseph Dereef (1802–1876) worked as wood factors. The family business operated from Dereef's Wharf. He also owned rental properties on the East Side of Charleston, and some of his tenants were white people. He was considered one of the richest black men in Charleston.\nDereef built a house in Wraggborough. He was owner of as many as 40 slaves. They were darker-skinned, whereas Dereef belonged to a lighter-skinned group that refused to associate with the darker-skinned group and regarded them with disdain in every aspect of life.\nDereef served as a city alderman, having been appointed by military authorities in 1868 during the Reconstruction era. He generally allied himself with Democrats.\nIn 1872, he was elected to the standing committee of the Brown Fellowship Society. He left a will and testament upon his death.\nLegacy\nDereef Court and Dereef Park in Charleston are named after him. In 2012, Dereef Park was slated to be developed with housing units despite protests. In 2017, a compromise was reached to incorporate a park and the historic praise house along with residential development.\nReferences"
