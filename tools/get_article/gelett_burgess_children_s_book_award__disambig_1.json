Named for Gelett Burgess, an artist and writer famous for his humorous Goops series (1900-1950), this award recognizes outstanding books that inspire imagination and creativity, and helps support childhood literacy and lifelong reading.\nHistory\nThe first award was granted in 2011 when Pat Mora won Book of the Year with Gracias Thanks''. In addition to the Book of the Year and several Burgess Honors, awards are granted each year in 40 categories, within 4 distinct groups: Lifestyle, Arts and Letters, Society and Culture, and Education.  The resulting list of award-winning titles is promoted throughout the year with additional activity and lesson plan resources made available.\nThe Gelett Burgess Children's Book Award seal was designed by the artist himself as a child.
