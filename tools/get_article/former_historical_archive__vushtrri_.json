The ground floor includes a renovated western façade with a shop window, but the first floor is preserved in its original form inside and out. The western and northern front façades have wood-framed lighting racks with metal railings and a jagged ceiling. The north side front door today has its original half-arch molding. The Communal Historical Archives were founded on 3 March 1968, initially run by the Legal and General Affairs Administrative Directorate of the Municipal Assembly of Vushtrri.\nSee also\n* Vushtrri\n* List of monuments in Vushtrri\nReferences"
