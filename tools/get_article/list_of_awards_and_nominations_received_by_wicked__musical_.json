It is based on the 1995 Gregory Maguire novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West (1995), which serves as a revisionist parallel novel to L. Frank Baum's classic story The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900) and the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. Wicked tells the story of Elphaba Thropp and Galinda Upland, two young women in the Land of Oz who are pushed into becoming the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda the Good, respectively. The musical was produced by Marc Platt, Jon B. Platt and David Stone through Universal Stage Productions, with direction by Joe Mantello and choreography by Wayne Cilento.\nAlthough the original Broadway production received mixed reviews and was initially panned by The New York Times, audience reception was much more positive. The success of Wicked on Broadway resulted in subsequent productions in Chicago, Los Angeles, London's West End, and San Francisco, as well as international productions in Japan, Germany, Australia and elsewhere. Additionally, two North American tours have visited over thirty cities in the United States and Canada. The show celebrated its 20th anniversary on October 30, 2023, and is currently the fourth-longest-running Broadway show in history, having played 7,774 performances as of December 24, 2023. Wicked has broken box office records around the world, holding weekly-gross-takings records in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, St. Louis, and London, and obtaining the record for biggest opening in the West End (£100,000 in the first hour on sale). In the week ending January 2, 2011, the London, Broadway, and both national touring productions all broke the record for the highest weekly gross. Both the West End production and the North American tour have been seen by over two million patrons. The original show was nominated for ten Tony Awards in 2004 and won three, including Best Actress in a Musical for Idina Menzel. It also won six Drama Desk Awards and one Grammy Award, while the London show has been the recipient of five Laurence Olivier Award nominations, winning one.\nAwards and nominations\nOriginal Broadway production\nSince its opening on October 30, 2003, the original Broadway production of Wicked has been consecutively nominated every year for at least one award. Accruing 64 nominations in 8 years, this production has won 33 of them. Amongst these 63 nominations include 10 Tony Awards (including the Tony Award for Best Musical), a Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album, 11 Drama Desk Awards, and 10 Outer Critics Circle Awards.\n{| class=wikitable width=100%\n|-\n!scope=col|Year\n!scope=col|Award ceremony\n!scope=col|Category\n!scope=col|Nominee\n!scope=col|Result\n|-\n|rowspan=35|2004\n|rowspan=10|Tony Awards\n|colspan=2|Best Musical\n|\n|-\n|Best Original Score\n|Stephen Schwartz\n|\n|-\n|Best Book of a Musical\n|Winnie Holzman\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Best Actress in a Musical\n|Idina Menzel\n|\n|-\n|Kristin Chenoweth\n|\n|-\n|Best Choreography\n|Wayne Cilento\n|\n|-\n|Best Orchestrations\n|William David Brohn\n|\n|-\n|Best Scenic Design\n|Eugene Lee\n|\n|-\n|Best Costume Design\n|Susan Hilferty\n|\n|-\n|Best Lighting Design\n|Kenneth Posner\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=11|Drama Desk Awards\n|colspan=2|Outstanding Musical\n|\n|-\n|Outstanding Music\n|rowspan=2|Stephen Schwartz\n|\n|-\n|Outstanding Lyrics\n|\n|-\n|Outstanding Book of a Musical\n|Winnie Holzman\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Outstanding Actress in a Musical\n|Kristin Chenoweth\n|\n|-\n|Idina Menzel\n|\n|-\n|Outstanding Director of a Musical\n|Joe Mantello\n|\n|-\n|Outstanding Orchestrations\n|William David Brohn\n|\n|-\n|Outstanding Set Design\n|Eugene Lee\n|\n|-\n|Outstanding Costume Design\n|Susan Hilferty\n|\n|-\n|Outstanding Lighting Design\n|Kenneth Posner\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Drama League Awards\n|colspan=2| Distinguished Production of a Musical\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Distinguished Performance\n|Kristin Chenoweth\n|\n|-\n|Idina Menzel\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=10|Outer Critics Circle Awards\n|colspan=2|Outstanding Broadway Musical\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Outstanding Actress in a Musical\n|Kristin Chenoweth\n|\n|-\n|Idina Menzel\n|\n|-\n|Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical\n|Joel Grey\n|\n|-\n|Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical\n|Carole Shelley\n|\n|-\n|Outstanding Director of a Musical\n|Joe Mantello\n|\n|-\n|Outstanding Choreography\n|Wayne Cilento\n|\n|-\n|Outstanding Set Design\n|Eugene Lee\n|\n|-\n|Outstanding Costume Design\n|Susan Hilferty\n|\n|-\n|Outstanding Lighting Design\n|Kenneth Posner\n|\n|-\n|Eddy Awards\n|Outstanding Costume Design\n|Susan Hilferty\n|\n|-\n|2005\n|Grammy Awards\n|Best Musical Show Album\n|Wicked (Original Broadway Cast Recording)\n|\n|}\nNorth American tours\nThe North American tours have been nominated 15 times for various awards, winning 13 of them.\n{| class=wikitable width=100%\n|-\n!scope=col|Year\n!scope=col|Award ceremony\n!scope=col|Category\n!scope=col|Nominee\n!scope=col|Result\n|-\n|rowspan=13|2006\n|rowspan=7|Carbonell Awards\n|colspan=2|Best Non-Resident Production\n|\n|-\n|Best Non-Resident Actress\n|Stephanie J.
