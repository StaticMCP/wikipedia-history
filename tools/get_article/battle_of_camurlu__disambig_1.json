The battle decided which son of Bayezid I would finally reunite the Ottoman Empire, with Mehmed Çelebi becoming Mehmed I of the Ottoman Empire.\nMehmed's invasion and final battle\nAfter suppressing Cüneyt Bey's revolt, Mehmed Çelebi gathered his troops at Ankara. With his Dulkadirid father-in-law, he began planning an invasion of Rumelia (the European part of the empire and Musa's stronghold) to defeat his brother, Musa. On his march to Bursa, Mehmed gained contingents of troops from western Anatolia. Upon reaching the straits, Mehmed's army was given passage by ships loaned from Manuel II Palaiologos, who supplied Mehmed with some troops.\nMehmed marched his army from Constantinople to Edirne. He then marched onto Kosovo to join forces with his ally (and also half-uncle) Serbian ruler Stefan Lazarević, along with receiving information from Evrenos concerning possible defections during the battle.\nBoth armies met at Çamurlu, near modern-day Samokov, south east of Sofia, Bulgaria. Initially, Musa appeared to be winning the battle despite the defection of Pasha Yigit and Sinan Bey of Trikkala. However, the tide of the battle turned in favor of Mehmed, with the help of Serb and Byzantine troops, and Musa Çelebi fled.\nAftermath\nFollowing the battle, Musa Çelebi was captured and strangled. This battle re-established the unity of the Ottoman state, under the control of Mehmed I.\nNotes"
