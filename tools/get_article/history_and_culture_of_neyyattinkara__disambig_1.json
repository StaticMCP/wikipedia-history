      "text": "# History and culture of Neyyattinkara__disambig_1\n\n]Cave pictures, probably by Neolithic people, are found in Pandavanpara, located in the North east side of Neyyattinkara towards Karakonam route. This famous cave will come under Perumkadavila panchayath. The name of this portion of land, before Marthanda Varma became the ruler of Travancore, was 'Thenganad'.\nThe megaliths recently unearthed at Vizhinjam shows a splendorous display of craftsmanship that was prevalent in the region from the Middle Eras. Studies are going on to ascertain the ancient history of this region. Some of the historic relics of NTA are:\n# Pandavan Para (believed to be having 5,000-year-old human inscriptions)\n# Vizhinjam Cave Temple (constructed by the rulers of the Ay kingdom)\n# Anantha Victoria Marthandan Canal (constructed during the British rule)\n# Neyyattinkara's first library Njanapradayini\nTimes of Travancore Dynasty\nSree Krishna Swami Temple in the town-centre stands as a rare example of merger between legend and reality. According to the legend it was here the Travancore king Marthanda Varma once hid inside the hollow trunk of a Jackfruit tree to escape from his enemies during his war against the Ettuveetil Pillamar (The Nair-Feudal Lords of the Eight Houses). The King prayed to Lord Krishna for helping him as he was being surrounded by the enemies. At that time, a mysterious child asked the King to hide himself inside the hollow trunk of a large jack tree standing there. The jack tree popularly known as 'Ammachiplavu' (Translating to \"Grandmother Jackfruit Tree\") since then, could still be seen preserved in the Shri Krishna Swamy Temple located in the heart of the town. This temple was built by Marthanda Varma in the year 1755, as a thanksgiving to the Lord Krishna, who helped him to win the ordeal.\nIndependence struggle\nNeyyattinkara is the birthplace of renowned revolutionaries like Swadeshabhimani Ramakrishna Pillai, Athazhamangalam VeeraRaghavan who fought for Indian independence and against the dictatorial rule of Travancore Diwans. Neyyattinkara is the land of many uprisings against British rule in India. The brutal crackdown by British military resulted in death of many freedom fighters including Veeraraghavan. A monument reminding the new generations of these struggles could be seen in the heart of the town, in front of the Town Police Station. The Father of Nation of India, Mahatma Gandhi, had spent a day at Madhavi Mandiram (name of a house) in Neyyattinkara.\nWards in Neyyattinkara Municipal Area\nNeyyattinkara Municipal Area is divided into 44 wards.
