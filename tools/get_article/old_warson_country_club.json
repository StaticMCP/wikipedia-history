Founded in 1953, it hosted the 1971 Ryder Cup and the 2009 U.S. Women's Amateur. The golf course was designed by Robert Trent Jones.\nHale Irwin, the winner of three U.S. Opens, joined the club in 1974 as a junior member; since 1977 he has been an active member.\nUntil 1991, Old Warson Country Club banned Black and Jewish people from joining. That year, it cancelled plans to host a PGA Senior Tour event rather than change its discriminatory rules. Several months later, the club admitted its first Black member: Frederick S. Wood, a retired executive vice president at General Dynamics.\nThe initiation fee was $45,000 ($}} today) in 1996 and $80,000 ($}} today) in 2006.\nMajor tournaments\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n!Year!!Tournament!!Winner\n|-\n| 1957 || Western Amateur || Ed Updegraff\n|-\n| 1962 || Trans-Mississippi Amateur  || Bob Ryan\n|-\n| 1971 || Ryder Cup || Team USA\n|-\n| 1999 || U.S. Mid-Amateur || Danny Green\n|-\n| 2009 || U.S. Women's Amateur  || Jennifer Song\n|-\n| 2016 || U.S. Senior Amateur || Dave Ryan\n|}\nNotes\nExternal links\n*[https://www.oldwarson.com/ Official website]"
