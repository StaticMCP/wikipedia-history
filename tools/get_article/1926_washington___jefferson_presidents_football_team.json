In their first season under head coach Andrew Kerr, the Presidents compiled a 7–1–1 record and outscored opponents by a total of 143 to 46. Their sole loss was by a 16-10 score against 1926 national champion Lafayette -- the narrowest margin of any team against Lafayette in its national championship season. In the penultimate game of the season, the Presidents played Pittsburgh to a scoreless tie before a crowd of 50,000 at Pitt Stadium. In a later ranking of 1926 college football teams by TipTop25, Washington & Jefferson was ranked No. 11.\nFullback Bill Amos was selected as a second-team All-American by the All-America Board, International News Service (INS), Billy Evans, and Walter Eckersall. He was also selected by the Associated Press (AP) as a first-team player on the 1926 All-Eastern football team.\nSchedule\n||Washington, PA|W 13-0||\n|October 2||Bucknell||Washington, PA|W 17-2||\n|October 9||Rutgers|College Field|Washington, PA|W 19-6|6,000|\n|October 16|at|Carnegie Tech||Pittsburgh, PA|W 17-6||\n|October 23|at|Fordham|Polo Grounds|New York, NY|W 28-13|8,000|\n|October 30|vs|Lafayette|Franklin Field|Philadelphia, PA|L 10-16|20,000|\n|November 6||||Washington, PA|W 26-0||\n|November 13|at|Pittsburgh|Pitt Stadium|Pittsburgh, PA|T 0-0|50,000|\n|November 25|at|West Virginia|Mountaineer Field|Morgantown, WV|W 13-3||\n}}\nReferences"
