It was claimed to have been sung to calm cows during milking, especially if their calf had died. It was recorded with music in 1703.\nThe lyrics are as follows:\n''Il a bho-lag-ain il bho m'agh-an\nIl a bho-lag-ain il bho m'agh-an\nIl a bho-lag-ain il bho m'agh-an\nMo chrodh laoigh air gach taobh an abh-ainn.\nEel-a vo-la-kin eel vo ma-an\nEel-a vo-la-kin eel vo ma-an\nEel-a vo-la-kin eel vo ma-an\nMó-chró lur air guch turv an a-van.''\nReferences"
