The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film was created in 1956 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to honour non-English-speaking films produced outside the United States. The award is handed out annually, and is accepted by the winning film's director, although it is considered an award for the submitting country as a whole. Countries are invited by the Academy to submit their best films for competition according to strict rules, with only one film being accepted from each country.\nFor the 44th Academy Awards, twenty films were submitted in the category Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Bulgaria and Canada submitted films for consideration for the first time. Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa gained his first nomination for the award (although he had received an honorary award at the 24th Academy Awards in 1951 for Rashomon) for ''Dodes'ka-den, a film which was a critical and commercial failure in his native Japan. The five nominated films came from Israel, Italy, Japan, Sweden and the Soviet Union.\nItaly won the award for the ninth time with The Garden of the Finzi-Continis by Vittorio De Sica, which was also nominated for Best Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium.\nSubmissions\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
