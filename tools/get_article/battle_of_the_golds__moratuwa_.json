It is known as The Battle of the Golds due to the colours of the two school's flags i.e. Purple, Gold and Maroon of Prince of Wales' College and Green, White & Gold of St. Sebastian's College.\nHistory\nThe encounter is considered to be one of the oldest big matches in Sri Lanka as it dates back to 1933. The first match in the sequence was played in 1933 under captain, Eugine Silva of St. Sebastian's College and Duncan Fernando of Prince of Wales College.  The inaugural match however ended in a low scoring draw. In 1935 the Cambrians  made history by recording the first win of the series with Ernie F. de Mel leading the side. De Mel's side registered a thrilling 4-wicket win against their rivals led by Earl Wijesinghe. The Cambrians led by KM Jayasekara went on to register back-to-back wins in the following two years by a thrilling 43-runs in 1936 and a comfortable innings and 87 runs in 1937. On both occasions, K.A.S Perera captained St. Sebastian's. There was a break in the series from 1938 to 1953.\nThe series resumed in 1954 with the match ending in a high-scoring draw. In 1955 Raymond de Silva's Sebastianites lost to the Cambrians for the fourth time by 9 wickets. Prince of Wales' was led by Stanley de Alwis. Draws followed for the next three years and Prince of Wales' expanded their winning tally to 5–nil in 1959 with an emphatic innings and 56-run win. Suranjith Mendis led the winning side while his counterpart was Sirimal Fernando. The encounter continued in stalemates for two years and in 1962 St. Sebastian's got their first-ever victory under Priyantha Fernando. They beat the Cambrians led by Hyasti Aponso by 5 wickets. After three consecutive draws, St. Sebastian's recorded their second win under Sarath Perera. Perera's side beat the Cambrians captained by Leslie de Silva by massive innings and 152 runs. Deadlocks followed for a decade until the Cambrians led by Pemlal Fernando recorded an 8-wicket win in a low-scoring encounter against Walter Fernando's Sebastianites.\nSince the start, the Cambrians have six wins while the Sebastianites have won four times in the series with the rest ending in draws. St Sebastian's had their last victory in 2024 under the guidance of Captain Manuja Chanthuka. Prince of Wales's has not won a match since 1977.\nAmong the outstanding performances in the encounter Nilantha Bopage from Prince of Wales holds the record for the highest run scorer in a match with 179 not out in 1991. For the Sebastian's Nalin Peiris was the highest scorer with two centuries in years 1957 and 1958. Among the leading wicket takers, the record for the most number of wickets in the series is held by Roger Wijesuriya taking 22 wickets for St. Sebastians from 1975 to 1979.\nLimited Over match started in 1981.

Overloaded cars with supporters singing and careering along the streets is a familiar sight during match days.\nThe match is looked forward to by both the young and old, male and female, and even those who had no connection with either school would turn up and enjoy the celebrations. It is more of an occasion for the old boys and present students of both schools coming together for 3 days of fun and revelry.
