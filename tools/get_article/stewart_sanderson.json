Stewart’s own research included studies of oral traditions of gypsies, material culture, fishing communities and folk beliefs, and he participated in field collection when possible.\nIn 1957 he became a Senior Research Fellow at the School and in the same year, became an Assistant Editor of the newly founded journal Scottish Studies.\nMoving to Leeds University in 1960 as a Lecturer in Folk Life Studies within the School of English, Stewart became Director of the newly created Institute of Dialect and Folklife Studies in 1964. There, he established both undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in Folk Life Studies - the first such courses in a UK university.\nAt Leeds University, a linguistic survey of England had been begun by Harold Orton in 1950.  In 1968, Sanderson agreed to co-edit with Orton a linguistic atlas based on the English survey, which was seen as the culmination of the project. This work, edited by Orton, Sanderson and John Widdowson, was finally published as The Linguistic Atlas of England (1978, with Harold Orton and Prof John Widdowson).  Further publications from the project edited by Sanderson followed, including Studies in Linguistic Geography (1985) with Widdowson and John M Kirk and Word Maps: A Dialect Atlas of England (1987) with Widdowson and Clive Upton.\nSanderson was also chairman of the School of English in Leeds from 1980-1983. During this time he arranged the transfer the archives of the Institute of Dialect and Folklife Studies for preservation in the special collections of the Brotherton Library, at the University of Leeds.  The Institute closed as a result of budget cuts in 1983.\nRecognition and later years\nSanderson was a Trustee of the Folklore Society from 1968-1979 and served as its President from 1970-1973. In 1981 he gave the Society’s inaugural Katharine Briggs Lecture on ‘The Modern Urban Legend’ and was awarded the Society’s Coote-Lake Research Medal in 1982.\nSanderson was a member of the committees of the International Commission for the Atlas of European Folk Culture and the International Society for Folk Narrative Research. He was a governor of the British Institute for Recorded Sound from 1979-1983.\nAfter retirement from academia, Sanderson remained active in Scottish literature circles. From 1983 to 1988 he chaired the Scottish Arts Council literature panel and also its grants to publishers panel, during a period which saw a significant revival of literature in Scotland.\nSelected works\n* Orton, Harold; Sanderson, Stewart; Widdowson, J.
