He has become a pacifist and is dismayed when his son enlists for what became World War II.\nCast\n*Corin Redgrave as Dr Edward Trenbow\n*Judy Morris as Deborah Trenbow\n*Gunter Meisner as Dr Karl Schneider\n*Arthur Dignam as Dr Peter Avante\n*Patricia Leehy as Marguerite\n*Jone Winchester as Deborah's mother\n*Brian James as Deborah's father\n*Reg Gillam as Trenbow's father\n*Betty Lucas as Trenbow's mother\n*Peter Cummins\n*Neil Fitzpatrick as Lance Backhouse\n* Reg Gorman as Orderly\n* John O'May as William Faulkner\n* Judy Lynne as Woman Officer\n* Colette Mann as student in revue\nProduction\nDirector Michael Thornhill was good friends with writer Frank Moorhouse and they had worked together on several short films. Moorehouse wrote the script in 1970, originally for television and it was revived a few years later. Half the budget came from the Australian Film Development Corporation and the other half from a property developer.\nFilming took place over six weeks in February and March 1974 with interiors at the former studios of Cinesound Productions at Bondi and locations in Gulgong and Melbourne. It was the first feature from cinematographer Russell Boyd.\nRelease\nThornhill decided to distribute the film himself at first. Initial reviews were good but the box office performance was not strong and distribution was taken over by the Vincent Library. The movie did not return its cost; a bigger \"flop\" than The Cars that Ate Paris.\nReception\nThe Canberra Times critic considered this an important Australian film, as distinct from the \"pot-boilers\" of the time — the \"Australian New Wave\" — Petersen, Stork, Stone and even Wake in Fright.\nHome media\nBetween Wars was released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment in January 2011. The DVD is compatible with all region codes.\nBy 2023 it was no longer in their catalogue.\nAwards\nIn 1976, the Australian Cinematographers Society awarded the film's cinematographer Russell Boyd with Cinematographer of the Year award for the film.\nSee also\n* Cinema of Australia\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9803EEDE1239F932A15751C0A963948260 Between Wars review] at The New York Times\n*[http://www.ozmovies.com.au/movie/between-wars Between Wars] at Oz Movies"
