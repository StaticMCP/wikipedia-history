Although Dominica is geographically part of the Leeward Islands, as it was part of the Windward Islands colony from 1940 until its independence, its cricket federation remains a part of the Windward Islands.\nHistory and formation\nThe Windward Islands Cricket Board was established in the 1980s to unify and coordinate cricket activities across the islands. Initially, cricket in the Windward Islands was managed independently by the individual islands, but as the sport grew in popularity, the need for a centralised body became apparent. The WICB was officially formed to streamline operations, facilitate inter-island competitions, and ensure representation in regional and international cricket .\nStructure and governance\nThe Windward Islands Cricket Board is composed of representatives from each of the member islands. Each island has its own cricket association that operates under the umbrella of the WICB. The Board's structure includes a president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer, and other executive members who are elected by the member associations. The WICB functions as a part of Cricket West Indies (CWI), which is the governing body for cricket in the West Indies.\nThe Secretariat of WICB is based in Grenada, while the franchise (Windwards Volcanoes) is based in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.\nThe most recent elections for the Board were held in May 2023, resulting in Mr. Dwain Gill being elected as president and Mr. Clement Marcellin as vice-president. Dr. Kishore Shallow had earlier relinquished the post after he was elected as the president of Cricket West Indies. Dr. Shallow had served as the WICB president from 2019 to 2023.\nRole and functions\nThe WICB is responsible for the administration of all cricket-related activities in the Windward Islands. This includes organising domestic competitions, developing cricket infrastructure, managing youth and development programs, and selecting teams for regional and international competitions. The Board also focuses on promoting the sport at the grassroots level to ensure a steady flow of talent for the future.\nDomestic competitions\nThe Windward Islands have a vibrant domestic cricket scene with several competitions held annually. The most prominent of these is the Windward Islands Cricket Championship, which features teams from the member islands competing against each other. Additionally, the Board oversees club competitions and various age-group tournaments to nurture young talent.\nYouth development\nThe WICB places a strong emphasis on youth development, running numerous programs to identify and train young cricketers. These initiatives include school cricket programs, talent scouting camps, and specialised coaching clinics. The Board also collaborates with schools and local communities to promote cricket as a means of personal development and social cohesion.\nAchievements and contributions\nThe region has produced several outstanding cricketers who have gone on to represent the West Indies at the international level. Notable players include Devon Smith, Daren Sammy, and Johnson Charles, who have all made substantial contributions to West Indies cricket.\nWindward Islands Constituent Associations\n*Dominica Cricket Association\n*Grenada Cricket Association\n*St. Lucia National Cricket Association\n*St. Vincent & the Grenadines Cricket Association\nPrincipals of Windward Islands Cricket Board\nList of WICB Presidents\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Office  holder\n!Tenure\n|-\n|Julian Hunte\n|\n|-\n|Lennox John\n|\n|-\n|Emmanual Nanthan\n|\n|-\n|Dr. Kishore Shallow\n|2019-2023\n|-\n|Dwain Gill\n|2023-present\n|}\nSee also\n* Windward Islands cricket team\n* List of Windward Islands first-class cricketers\n* List of international cricketers from the Windward Islands\n* Dominica national cricket team\n* Grenada national cricket team\n* Saint Vincent and the Grenadines national cricket team\n* Saint Lucia national cricket team\n* Cricket in the West Indies\nReferences"
