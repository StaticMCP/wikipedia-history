In 2013 the estimated population of the parish was 80.\nWarmwell contains several historic buildings, including a Jacobean manor house, and from May 1937 was the home of RAF Station Woodsford airfield (later renamed RAF Warmwell), which is now a popular holiday site and contains a caravan park and several other small businesses.\nOn the outskirts of the village is Warmwell Holiday Park, operated by Parkdean Resorts.
