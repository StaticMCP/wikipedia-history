Its remoteness and the fact that it is surrounded by several 14,000 foot peaks means that it is rarely climbed.\nDirections\nThe Pine Creek Trailhead lies at 8,800 feet. From US 24, 6.3 miles south of the U.S.24-CO 82 intersection, turn onto Chaffee County 388. Continue straight at 0.3 miles and around a sharp turn at 0.6 miles where the road gets a bit rougher. Low clearance cars might want to park here, while others may continue up the last tenth of a mile to the trailhead. The trailhead lies on the boundary of the private Pine Creek Ranch.\nSee also\n*List of Colorado mountain ranges\n*List of Colorado mountain summits\n**List of Colorado fourteeners\n**List of Colorado 4000 meter prominent summits\n**List of the most prominent summits of Colorado\n*List of Colorado county high points\nReferences\nExternal links"
