The seal is designated as a National Treasure of Japan. The seal is believed to have been cast in China and bestowed by Emperor Guangwu of Han upon a diplomatic official (envoy) visiting from Japan in the year 57&nbsp;AD. The five Chinese characters appearing on the seal identify it as the seal of the King of Na state of Wa, tributary state of the Han dynasty.\nThe seal is currently in the collection of the Fukuoka City Museum in Fukuoka, Japan. It is the first known textual record of Japan as a country, and is included in Japanese history books as a cultural asset that indicates how Japan came into being as a political entity.\nAppearance\nThe seal is composed of gold of 95% purity. It is made up of a square base, with the seal itself on the bottom face, and a handle on top of the base in the shape of a snake. It has a mass of . The total height from base to handle is . The base of the seal averages  on a side. This dimension roughly corresponds to the traditional Chinese standard unit of length of one cun, as used in the Later Han dynasty (about ).\nCharacters engraved on the seal\nThe five characters engraved on the seal are (in the order in which they are to be read):\n: 漢委奴國王\nThe meanings of these characters (in the context of this seal) are: \"Han\" (referring to the Han dynasty of China), \"Wa\" (an ancient name for Japan), \"Na\" (an ancient kingdom / state within Japan), \"state / country\", and \"ruler.\" Altogether, the meaning of the seal inscription is: \"(seal of) the King of the Na state of the Wa [vassal?] of the Han dynasty\".\nThe character 委 is a loan for 倭 (Wa), an instance of the common practice of loaning characters in Classical Chinese. The characters are engraved in the seal script style.\nHistory\nThe seal has been judged to be the one described in the Book of the Later Han, a Chinese chronicle of the history of the Eastern Han dynasty. According to the chronicle, the Chinese Emperor Guangwu conferred the seal on a diplomatic official visiting from Japan.\nContemporary description of conferral\nThe following is the original Chinese text from the chronicle:\n:建武中元二年，倭奴國奉貢朝賀，使人自稱大夫，倭國之極南界也。光武賜以印綬。\nThis passage can be translated into English as:\n:\"In the 2nd year of the jianwu zhongyuan reign period [AD 57], the Na state of Wa sent an envoy with tribute. The envoy introduced himself as a high official. The state lies in the far south of Wa. [Emperor] Guangwu bestowed on him a seal with a tassel.\"\nDuring the Han dynasty, similar seals were bestowed on other regional sovereigns, in an attempt by the dynasty to bring these sovereigns into the Han ruling order.\nRediscovery\nAfter being lost for an undetermined period of time, the seal was reportedly rediscovered on April 12, 1784, on Shika Island in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. According to contemporary reports, the seal was discovered by a farmer named Jinbei while repairing an irrigation ditch. It was found surrounded by stones forming a box-like structure around it. The stone above the seal required two adults to lift. After rediscovery, the seal was kept by the Kuroda clan, rulers of the Fukuoka Domain, and eventually donated by the Kuroda family to the city of Fukuoka in 1978.\nSee also\n* King of Dian gold seal\n* King of Nanyue gold seal\n* List of National Treasures of Japan (archaeological materials)\nReferences"
