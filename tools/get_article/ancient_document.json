A jury can still decide that the author of the document was lying or mistaken when the author wrote it.\nHearsay\nAncient documents also present an exception to the hearsay rule. FRE (16) applies this exception to all documents prepared before January 1, 1998. Because of their age, they may be presented as evidence of the truth of any statements contained therein. Many states follow this rule as well, but again most limit it to documents that dispose of property.\nReferences"
