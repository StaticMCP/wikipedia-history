The club relocated to Kingswood Oval in 1981 and adjusted its name to National Australia Bank Group Football Club in 1984.  The club renamed itself to the Kingswood Football Club in 1991 to appeal to a wider market, but this name was short-lived as the club folded at the end of that season.\nA-Grade Premierships\n* South Australian Amateur Football League A4 (1)\n** 1976\n* South Australian Amateur Football League A5 (1)\n** 1975\n* South Australian Amateur Football League A7 (1)\n** 1971\n** 1984\nReferences"
