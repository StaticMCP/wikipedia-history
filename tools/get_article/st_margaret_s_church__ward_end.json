The church may have been derelict from the reformation onwards as in 1833 an appeal was launched for its restoration.\nThe new church was erected and opened in 1834. It was consecrated on 23 October 1841 by the Bishop of Worcester. In 1870 land was taken from the parish of SS Peter and Paul's Church, Aston to form a new parish. Land was taken from St Margaret's parish in 1928 to form St Paul's Church, Bordesley Green, and St Mary and St John's Church, Shaw Hill in 1929.\nThe church was closed in 2005 and the parish was united with Christ Church, Ward End. In 2010 the St Margaret's Community Trust undertook a restoration.\nMemorials\n*Gothic memorial to William Hutton (1723&ndash;1815), a bust by Peter Hollins of 1848\nOrgan\nAn organ by J C Bishop was installed in 1845. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.\nReferences"
