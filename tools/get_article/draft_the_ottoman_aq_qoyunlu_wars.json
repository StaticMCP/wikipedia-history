These confrontations were driven by territorial disputes in eastern Anatolia, the collapse of Timurid authority in Persia, and a broader contest for dominance in the Islamic world following the decline of other regional powers such as the Kara Qoyunlu and the Karamanids.\nThe wars ultimately resulted in the '''Ottoman Empire's consolidation of Anatolia, the weakening of the Aq Qoyunlu state, and the geopolitical vacuum that led to the emergence of the Safavid dynasty in Iran.\n----\nBackground\nIn the mid-15th century, the Ottoman Empire, under Sultan Mehmed II, emerged as a dominant military and political force following the conquest of Constantinople in 1453. With the Balkans largely subdued, Mehmed turned his attention eastward to Anatolia, where semi-independent Turkic principalities such as the Karamanids continued to resist Ottoman rule.\nTo counter Ottoman expansion, the Aq Qoyunlu, a tribal Turkmen confederation based in Diyarbakır and later Tabriz, under Uzun Hasan, supported the Karamanids and formed an alliance with the Republic of Venice'''. This alliance was part of a broader anti-Ottoman coalition supported by various European powers, including the Papacy, who hoped Uzun Hasan would create a two-front war that would check the Ottomans' rapid rise.\nThe Aq Qoyunlu had recently supplanted their rivals, the Kara Qoyunlu, in Persia, and Uzun Hasan aimed to expand his influence further westward into Anatolia. His interference in Anatolian affairs, combined with support from Venice and other European states, led to a direct military confrontation with the Ottomans.\n----\nBuild-up to War\nBetween 1464 and 1471, Uzun Hasan provided direct support to the Karamanids, the last major obstacle to complete Ottoman domination of central Anatolia. This included military assistance and safe havens for exiled Karamanid leaders. During this period, Venice sent multiple embassies to Tabriz encouraging Uzun Hasan to wage war against Mehmed II in coordination with Christian forces in the west.\nMehmed responded by launching campaigns against the Karamanids, annexing their territory, and eliminating their power base by 1472. With central Anatolia secured, the Ottomans prepared to confront the Aq Qoyunlu directly.\n----\nBattle of Otlukbeli\nPrelude\nIn the summer of 1473, Sultan Mehmed II led an Ottoman army of approximately 60,000–70,000 troops eastward into the Erzincan region. Uzun Hasan assembled a much larger force, estimated at 80,000–100,000, composed mainly of light cavalry and tribal levies.\nUzun Hasan attempted to use the mountainous terrain around Otlukbeli to ambush the Ottoman army. However, Ottoman scouts and engineers anticipated the plan and fortified their position with trenches and artillery placements.\nArmy Composition\nThe Ottoman army consisted of:\n* Elite Janissaries (infantry with firearms)\n* Sipahis (provincial cavalry)\n* Azaps (irregular infantry)\n* Topçu (artillery corps, with around 100 field cannons)\n* Balkan and Anatolian auxiliaries\n* Engineering corps for fortifications and logistics\nThe Aq Qoyunlu forces relied primarily on:\n* Traditional Turkmen light cavalry\n* Elite ghulam heavy cavalry\n* Tribal auxiliaries and Kurdish contingents\n* Minimal infantry and no effective artillery\nBattle\nOn 11 August 1473, Uzun Hasan launched repeated cavalry assaults against the Ottoman flanks. The Ottoman defensive formation held firm, with artillery and Janissary volleys inflicting heavy casualties. The Aq Qoyunlu’s tactic of feigned retreats and rapid cavalry charges proved ineffective against the Ottomans' disciplined formations and firepower.\nAfter several hours of fighting, the Ottoman right wing overwhelmed the Aq Qoyunlu’s left flank. Ottoman reserves then moved to encircle Uzun Hasan’s center. His ghulams made a final stand, but the army collapsed under pressure. Uzun Hasan narrowly escaped with a small guard force.\nCasualties\nOttoman sources claim that 20,000–30,000 Aq Qoyunlu troops were killed or captured, while Ottoman losses were significantly lower, estimated at around 5,000–7,000.\n----\nAftermath\nThe defeat at Otlukbeli marked the end of Aq Qoyunlu influence in Anatolia. Uzun Hasan returned to Tabriz but was unable to recover militarily. He died in 1478, and his successors were soon embroiled in civil war.\nThe Ottomans annexed much of eastern Anatolia, while Venice abandoned hopes of a two-front war against the Ottomans. The defeat also highlighted the weakness of tribal cavalry-based armies when facing centralized states equipped with firearms and artillery.\nThe internal fragmentation of the Aq Qoyunlu state eventually paved the way for the rise of the Safavid dynasty, which would go on to establish a Shia theocratic state in Iran under Shah Ismail I, and become the primary eastern rival to the Sunni Ottoman Empire in the following century.\n----\nSignificance\nThe Ottoman–Aq Qoyunlu Wars, and especially the Battle of Otlukbeli, were among the first clear demonstrations of the effectiveness of gunpowder weaponry in open field battles in the Islamic world. The Ottomans’ centralized command structure, disciplined infantry, and superior logistics provided a model that would dominate regional warfare in the following centuries.\nThe defeat of Uzun Hasan also marked the decline of the Turkmen tribal confederation model and the rise of centralized empires with professional standing armies.\n----\nLegacy\nThe wars secured the Ottoman Empire’s control over all of Anatolia, ending centuries of division among Turkish principalities. The collapse of the Aq Qoyunlu allowed for the emergence of a new ideological and military rivalry between the Sunni Ottomans and the Shia Safavids, culminating in the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514.\nThe Ottomans emerged from the conflict as the undisputed hegemon of the region, with an empire spanning the Balkans, Anatolia, and increasingly the Middle East.\n----\nSee also\n* Mehmed the Conqueror\n* Uzun Hasan\n* Aq Qoyunlu\n* Battle of Chaldiran\n* Ottoman–Safavid Wars\n* Karamanids\n----\nReferences\n* Imber, Colin (2002).
