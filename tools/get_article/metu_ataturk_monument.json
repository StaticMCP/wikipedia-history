It is situated on the Ankara Campus of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Middle East Technical University (METU). The monument's design was selected through a competition initiated in 1965, with Şadi Çalık’s submission securing first place. Completed in 1966, the bronze structure holds the distinction of being Turkey's first abstract monument dedicated to Atatürk.\nEach November 10, on the anniversary of Atatürk's death, a commemoration is held by METU staff and students in front of the monument.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## METU Ataturk Monument\n\n#REDIRECT METU Atatürk Monument"
