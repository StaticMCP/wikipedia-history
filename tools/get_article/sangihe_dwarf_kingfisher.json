Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry forests. It is threatened by habitat loss.\nOnly six specimens are known, and it has not been definitively recorded since the 1870s, so it has been suggested to be probably extinct.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Sangihe Dwarf Kingfisher\n\n#REDIRECT Sangihe_dwarf_kingfisher\n}}"
