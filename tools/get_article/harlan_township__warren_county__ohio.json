It was created by the Ohio General Assembly by the Act of March 16, 1860 (Ohio Laws, volume 57, page 135), which took effect that day.  It divided the existing Salem Township into two parts, the northern part to be called Corwin Township, the southern to be called Harlan.\nGovernment\nThe township is governed by a three-member board of trustees, who are elected in November of odd-numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following January 1.  Two are elected in the year after the presidential election and one is elected in the year before it.  There is also an elected township fiscal officer, who serves a four-year term beginning on April 1 of the year after the election, which is held in November of the year before the presidential election.  Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees.\nPublic services\nThe Little Miami, Blanchester, Goshen, and Clinton Massie school districts serve the township.  Mail is delivered through the Pleasant Plain, Clarksville, Morrow, Goshen, and Blanchester post offices.
