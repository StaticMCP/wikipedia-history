As of  , , Perseverance has been on the planet for  sols ( total days; ). Ingenuity operated for  sols ( total days; ) until its rotor blades, possibly all four, were damaged during the landing of flight 72 on January 18, 2024, causing NASA to retire the craft.\nCurrent weather data on Mars is being monitored by the Curiosity rover and had previously been monitored by the Insight lander. The Perseverance rover is also collecting weather data. (See the External links section)\nOverview of mission\nPrelaunch (2012–2020)\nThe Mars 2020 mission was announced by NASA on December 4, 2012. In 2017 the three sites (Jezero crater, Northeastern Syrtis Major Planum, and Columbia Hills) were chosen as potential landing locations, with Jezero crater selected as the landing location, and launched on July 30th, 2020, from Cape Canaveral.\nLanding and initial tests (February–May 2021)\nAfter arriving on February 18, Perseverance focused on validating its systems. During this phase, it used its science instruments for the first time, generated oxygen on Mars with MOXIE, and deployed Ingenuity. Ingenuity began the technology demonstration phase of its mission, completing five flights before transitioning to the operations demonstration phase of its mission.\nCratered floor campaign (June 2021-April 2022)\nThe Cratered Floor Campaign was the first science campaign. It began on June 1, 2021, with the goal of exploring the Crater Floor Fractured Rough and Séítah geologic units. To avoid the sand dunes of the Séítah unit, Perseverance mostly traveled within the Crater Floor Fractured Rough geologic unit or along the boundary between the two units. The first nine of Perseverances sample tubes were to be filled during this expedition, including the first three 'witness tubes'.\nAfter collecting the samples, Perseverance returned to its landing site, before continuing to the delta for its second science campaign. Some of the sample tubes filled during this campaign were later stored in a designated area for the upcoming NASA-ESA Mars Sample Return mission, during the Delta Front Campaign. While Perseverance embarked on its first science campaign, Ingenuity continued to travel alongside the rover as part of its operations demonstration campaign.  ''Ingenuity's sixth through twenty-fifth flights were completed during this phase, achieving an at-the-time speed record of 5.5 meters per second.\nDelta front campaign (April 2022 - January 2023)\nThe Delta Front Campaign was the second science campaign of the Mars 2020 mission. The campaign began with Ingenuity continuing to travel alongside the rover as part of its operations demonstration campaign, and Perseverance leaving the rapid traverse mode it had entered at the end of the last mission to rapidly reach the delta.  During the campaign, Perseverance would take a further nine samples, in addition to two further witness tubes.  Ingenuity would make its 41th flight during this mission.  An incident occurred in which Ingenuity was unable to sufficiently charge during the night, leading to a change in how Ingenuity manages its heaters.  The MOXIE experiment continued to run, generating a record amount of oxygen-per-hour on Mars.  The campaign concluded with Perseverance reaching the top of the delta and the completion of its first sample depot.\nUpper fan campaign (January 2023 - September 2023)\nThe Upper Fan Campaign, also called the Delta Top Campaign, was the third science campaign of the Mars 2020 mission. Whereas prior campaigns investigated areas that are believed to have been submerged in an ancient lake, this campaign investigated one of the riverbeds that used to feed into the lake.  The MOXIE experiment completed its 16th, and final, oxygen generation test during this campaign.  Ingenuity completed its 54th flight during this campaign.  The helicopter experienced an anomaly that caused it to land outside the range of the rover, but this was ultimately resolved when the rover moved into a position that allowed contact to be restored.  The campaign ended with Perseverance reaching the margin carbonate geologic unit, after having taken three further rock samples (and 21 overall).\nMargin campaign (September 2023 - August 2024)\nThe Margin Campaign was the fourth of the Mars 2020 mission. The campaign was expected to last around 8 months, although it lasted closer to a year, after which point Perseverance began the Crater Rim Campaign. The campaign gets its name from the geological unit it aims to explore - the margin carbonate unit. Rocks in this unit are capable of containing traces of life, and their formation is tied to the presence of liquid water.\nDuring the campaign, Ingenuity achieved several records, including a max altitude of 24 meters (flight 61) and a maximum groundspeed of 10 meters per second (flight 62).  Unfortunately, due to a failure on the 72nd flight, the helicopter blades became too damaged to fly.  On January 25th, 2024, NASA declared the end of Ingenuity's'' mission - the helicopter's final resting place was named Valinor Hills, after a location in the Lord of the Rings franchise. Despite the loss of ''Ingenuity's blades, the core of the helicopter remained intact; it will continue to monitor atmospheric conditions for as long as it is able.  Perseverance took four further rock samples during this campaign (25 overall).  The campaign overlapped with solar conjunction, interfering with the ability to communicate with the rover from Earth.\nEngineers from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and AeroVironment are completing a detailed assessment of the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter’s final flight on January 18, 2024, the first of its kind on an extraterrestrial planet, concluding that the inability of Ingenuity’s navigation system to provide accurate data during the flight likely caused a chain of events that ended the mission.\nThe helicopter’s vision navigation system was designed to track visual features on the surface using a downward-looking camera over well-textured (pebbly) but flat terrain. This limited tracking capability was more than sufficient for carrying out Ingenuity’s first five flights, but by Flight 72 the helicopter was in a region of Jezero Crater filled with steep, relatively featureless sand ripples.\nOne of the navigation system’s main requirements was to provide velocity estimates that would enable the helicopter to land within a small envelope of vertical and horizontal velocities. Data sent down during Flight 72 shows that, around 20 seconds after takeoff, the navigation system couldn’t find enough surface features to track.\nPhotographs taken after the flight indicate the navigation errors created high horizontal velocities at touchdown. In the most likely scenario, the hard impact on the sand ripple’s slope caused Ingenuity to pitch and roll. The rapid attitude change resulted in loads on the fast-rotating rotor blades beyond their design limits, snapping all four of them off at their weakest point — about a third of the way from the tip. The damaged blades caused excessive vibration in the rotor system, ripping the remainder of one blade from its root and generating an excessive power demand that resulted in loss of communications.\nCrater rim campaign (August 2024 - present)\nThe Crater Rim Campaign is the fifth, currently ongoing science campaign, and the first new science campaign since the loss of the Ingenuity helicopter.  It is expected to last until the end of 2024, and will include a total elevation change of over 1000 feet (~300 meters).  The main focuses of the campaign are expected to be at the regions \"Pico Turquino\" and \"Witch Hazel Hill\", pictured above.  It is expected to encounter rocks as old as 4 billion years.\nSamples cached for the Mars sample-return mission\nSee also\n* Astrobiology\n* Composition of Mars\n* Curiosity rover\n* Exploration of Mars\n* Geography of Mars\n* Geology of Mars\n* InSight lander\n* List of missions to Mars\n* List of rocks on Mars\n* Mars Exploration Rover\n* Mars Express orbiter\n* Mars Odyssey Orbiter\n* Mars Orbiter Mission\n* Mars Pathfinder (Sojourner rover)\n* Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter\n* Mars 2020 rover mission\n* MAVEN orbiter\n* Moons of Mars\n* Phoenix lander\n* Robotic spacecraft\n* Scientific information from the Mars Exploration Rover mission\n* Space exploration\n* Timeline of Mars Science Laboratory\n* U.S. Space Exploration History on U.S. Stamps\n* Viking program\n* Water on Mars\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/weather Current Weather Report] on Mars by the Perseverance rover – [https://cab.inta-csic.es/noticias/meda-ya-funciona-en-marte/18/ MEDA]\n** ([https://twitter.com/MarsWxReport MarsWxReport/temp]; [https://web.archive.org/web/20210406202404/https://twitter.com/MarsWxReport/status/1379530268923600897 1st Report/6apr2021]; [https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8909/nasas-first-weather-report-from-jezero-crater-on-mars/ NASA-1]; [https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-first-weather-report-from-jezero-crater-on-mars NASA-2])\n** Mars Weather: [https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/weather/ Perseverance]*[https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/weather/ Curiosity]*[https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/weather/ InSight]\n* [https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/weather/ Current Weather Report] on Mars by the Curiosity rover\n* [https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/weather/ Current Weather Report] on Mars by the InSight lander\n* [https://www.nasa.gov/perseverance Perseverance rover: Official website]\n* [https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mars2020/ Mars 2020: Official website]\n* [https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/where-is-the-rover/ Mars 2020: Location Maps]\n*  ([https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA24663 related site]; [https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/archive/PIA24663_fullres.png 2GB PNG-image])\n*\n* [https://archive.today/20140627092658/https://webcast.stsci.edu/webcast/detail.xhtml?talkid=4006 Video (60:00) – Minerals and the Origins of Life] – (Robert Hazen; NASA; April 2014)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNjuz6MO0eU Video (86:49) – Search for Life in the Universe] – (NASA; July 2014)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRrFRL5v0ig Video (13:33) – Mars Perseverance rover/Ingenuity'' helicopter report] [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mars-ingenuity-helicopter-perseverance-rover-60-minutes-2021-05-09/ (9 May 2021; CBS-TV, 60 Minutes)]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOplTCgnJFQ Video (03:04) − Exploring Jezero Crater] − (NASA; December 2021)"
