Buchanan:   Dole:  Alexander:\n}}\nThe 1996 New Hampshire Republican presidential primary took place on February 20, 1996, as one of the Republican Party's statewide nomination contests ahead of the 1996 United States presidential election.\nDetails\nPaleo-conservative Journalist Pat Buchanan was making an insurgent rise, making a narrow upset victory frontrunner Bob Dole by a margin of just 1% of the vote. Buchanan had previously performed strongly in New Hampshire, during his 1992 challenge against incumbent president George H.W. Bush. Buchanan's momentum from his victory in New Hampshire would prove short-lived, as Dole would sweep every state on Super Tuesday on his way to the nomination. Dole eventually lost to incumbent Democratic President Bill Clinton in the 1996 general election.\nReferences"
