It contended the 2009 European Parliament elections under a common banner with Polish People's Party \"Piast\" (PSL Piast). It was formed mainly by former members of the League of Polish Families (LPR), including its leader Janusz Dobrosz.\nHistory\nThe party dated back to the Interim Executive Board made up of Sylwester Chruszcz (former president of the LPR), Bogusław Rogalski and Jan Szewczak. The inaugural Congress was held on 29 November 2008, the Interim Executive Board was replaced and its constituent declaration drawn up.\nForward Poland originally intended to be part of Libertas, the pan-European political organization founded by Declan Ganley. Ganley came to Poland on 7 January 2009 to discuss terms with representatives from Forward Poland, PSL Piast and Prawica Rzeczypospolitej (PR). Ganley insisted that the party used the word \"Libertas\" but the party politicians were concerned that the non-Polish name would deter voters. The name \"Forward Poland - Libertas\" (Naprzód Polsko – Libertas) was suggested as a compromise.\nAnother Congress took place on 25 January 2009 in Warsaw. The party signed a declaration of cooperation with PSL Piast. Letters of support were received from Krzysztof Wyszkowski, Declan Ganley and Czech President Václav Klaus. Talks were held with representatives from PR, Unia Polityki Realnej (UPR) and Libertas. Talks were also held with representatives from Radio Maryja, which NP politicians had connections with from their days in LPR.\nForward Poland rejected cooperation with Libertas because Forward Poland felt that Libertas did not reflect their desire for a more independent Poland. However, Forward Poland accepted political cooperation and joint programming with PSL Piast to contend the 2009 European Parliament elections under a common banner (\"Naprzód Polsko-Piast\"), and formally signed the agreement to that effect on March 1, 2009. Present during the signing of the agreement were representatives from Konfederacja Polski Niepodległej (KPN), Zjednoczenie Chrześcijańsko-Narodowe (ZChN-u), Niezależny Samorządny Związek Zawodowy Rolników Indywidualnych \"Solidarność\", Związek Zawodowy Rolników \"Ojczyzna\" and Niezależny Samorządny Związek Zawodowy \"Solidarność\" 80.\nOn the 19 May 2010 the party was de-registered as a political party and liquidation was concluded by 19 October 2010. Their members joined various different existing right-wing parties.\nStructure\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Position\n!Person\n|-\n|President\n|Janusz Dobrosz\n|-\n|Vice Presidents\n|Bogdan Pęk, Jan Szewczak\n|-\n|Secretary General\n|Sylwester Chruszcz\n|-\n|Chairman of the Policy Council\n|Dariusz Grabowski\n|-\n|Policy Council Vice President\n|Robert Rynkun-Werner\n|-\n|Treasurer\n|Andrzej Zapałowski\n|-\n|President of the Supreme Audit Commission\n|Peter Frosik\n|-\n|Spokesman\n|Bogusław Rogalski\n|}\nForward Poland in the European institutions\nForward Poland had the following MEPs in the 2004-2009 term of the European Parliament\n* Sylwester Chruszcz\n* Dariusz Grabowski\n* Bogdan Pęk\n* Bogusław Rogalski\n* Andrzej Zapałowski\nThey were all elected as members of LPR and all sat in the Union for Europe of the Nations group.\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081216003943/http://www.naprzodpolsko.pl/ Official site]\nReferences"
