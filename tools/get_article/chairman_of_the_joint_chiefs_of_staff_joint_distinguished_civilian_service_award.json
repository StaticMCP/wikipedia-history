The level of service for this award should have been given the direct attention or led to direct interaction with the CJCS.\nRecipients may receive the award only once, and the award cannot be received in conjunction with a Secretary of Defense award for the same service. Time in service is not necessarily a qualifying factor and military service should not be factored at all.\nDescription\nThe award is a gold plated medal with the Department of defense seal (eagle clutching arrows with an American shield in foreground) in front of two crossed swords and two vertical swords.  The medal is suspended from a white ribbon with a wide purple center stripe and six dashed pin stripes, three on each side.\nReferences"
