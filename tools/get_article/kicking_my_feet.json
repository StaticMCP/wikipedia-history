On 22 August 2025, Van Dijk announced that his second studio album would be released on 17 October 2025. He revealed that following the conclusion of his tour in 2023, he did not initially feel ready to begin work on a new project. However, after collaborating with new partners, he resumed writing. Van Dijk stated that he aimed to \"push himself\" artistically with this album, ultimately recording over 200 songs during the process. Van Dijk release\nUpon release, Ruel said \"There's no perfect message that I want to give anyone, because anyone can interpret something the way they want to. But on each song, I'm clearly trying to make you feel something, and I just hope it heightens that emotion on each one.\"\nComposition\nThe album contains eleven-tracks, and includes contributions from producers Julian Bunetta, Joel Little, Mark Schick, Ammo, M-Phazes, Leroy Clampitt, Dan Wilson, and Elias Danielsen.\nPromotion\nSingles\nThe album spawned three singles. \"I Can Die Now\", released on 17 July 2025, served as the album lead single. It was followed by \"The Suburbs\" and \"Wild Guess\" as the second and third singles in 2025. \"Not What's Going On\" was released alongside the album on 17 October 2025\nTour\nTo promote the album, Van Dijk is set to embark on his upcoming tour Kicking My Feet Tour.\nReception\n| rev2 = Dork\n| rev2score =\n}}\nKicking My Feet was met with positive reviews from music critics. Matthew Dwyer from PopMatters noted that the album allows Ruel to \"stand out in a crowded field of male pop stars,\" praising his \"sharp take on an existing formula,\" stating that \"while most pop stars could spend an entire album cycle deciding how confessional they want to be, he has struck an innate balance between fame and privacy as he has gradually ascended to stardom.\" Dwyer further praised the album’s \"shiny, highly-production,\" Ruel's husky vocals, and his songwriting abilities.\nJade Kennedy from The Music Network said the album showcases \"a confident evolution in sound and songwriting\" adding \"Kicking My Feet sees Ruel blending emotional depth with contemporary pop production.\"\nElla Sangster from Cosmopolitan said \"Kicking My Feet is impressively cohesive; with sleek, sharp pop and R&B inflections, threaded with lyrics demonstrating an introspection that only really comes from growing up.\"\nTrack listing\n| extra1        =\n| length1       = 2:31\n| title2        = Wild Guess\n| writer2       =\n| extra2        =\n| length2       = 2:46\n| title3        = When You Walk in the Room\n| writer3       = Ryan\n| extra3        = Ryan\n| length3       = 1:58\n| title4        = I Can Die Now\n| writer4       =\n| extra4        =\n| length4       = 2:51\n| title5        = Not What's Going On\n| writer5       =\n| extra5        = Ryan\n| length5       = 2:54\n| title6        = Destroyer\n| writer6       =\n| extra6        = Blume\n| length6       = 3:08\n| title7        = The Suburbs\n| writer7       =\n| extra7        =\n| length7       = 3:08\n| title8        = No News Is Good News\n| writer8       =\n| extra8        = Humble the Great\n| length8       = 3:46\n| title9        = Even Angels Won't\n| writer9       =\n| extra9        = Wilson\n| length9       = 3:17\n| title10       = Kicking My Feet\n| writer10      =\n| extra10       =\n| length10      = 3:18\n| title11       = DST (Outro)\n| writer11      =\n| extra11       = Taka Perry\n| length11      = 0:52\n| total_length  = 30:29\n}}\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\n* Ruel – vocals (all tracks), background vocals (tracks 1, 4, 5), guitar (2), piano (9)\n* Nathan Dantzler – mastering\n* Alex Ghenea – mixing (1–10)\n* John Ryan – background vocals, bass, drums, guitar, percussion (1, 3, 5); keyboards (1, 5)\n* Matt Zara – background vocals, bass, drums, guitar, keyboards, percussion (1, 5)\n* Dan Wilson – guitar (2, 6, 9), drums (2, 9), piano (2)\n* Leroy Clampitt – acoustic guitar, bass, electric guitar (2)\n* John Carroll Kirby – Rhodes piano (2)\n* Julian Bunetta – bass, drums, guitar, keyboards, percussion (4)\n* Joshua Coleman – guitar (4)\n* Mark Schick – guitar (4)\n* Harriston Tate – mastering assistance (4)\n* Kenneth Blume – bass, guitar (6)\n* Max Bassin – drums (6)\n* M-Phazes – synthesizer, engineering (7); background vocals (10)\n* Nick Lamb – piano, synthesizer (7)\n* William James Watson – background vocals, bass, drums, guitar (8)\n* Joe Avio – guitar (9)\n* Sara Mulford – piano, synthesizer (9)\n* Elias Danielsen – background vocals, bass, guitar (10)\n* Theremin – bells, guitar (10)\n* Quincy Bunn – drums (10)\n* Taka Perry – bass, guitar, synthesizer, mixing (11)\n* Theodore Lee – keyboards (11)\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for Kicking My Feet\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2025)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA)\n| 6\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| UK Physical Albums (OCC)\n| 100\n|-\n|-\n|}\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Kicking My Feet release history\n! scope=\"col\" |Region\n! scope=\"col\" |Date\n! scope=\"col\" |Format(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Label\n! scope=\"col\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Various\n|17 October 2025\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|}\nReferences"
