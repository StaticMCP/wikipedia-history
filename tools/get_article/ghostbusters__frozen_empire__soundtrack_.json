The film's original score was composed by Dario Marianelli, and was released through Sony Classical Records on March 22, 2024.\nBackground\nOn January 18, 2024, it was announced that Italian composer Dario Marianelli would score music for the film, replacing Rob Simonsen, who previously scored the predecessor; this film marked Marianelli's second collaboration with director Gil Kenan after A Boy Called Christmas (2021). He recorded the score at the Barbara Streisand Scoring Stage at the Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California.\nOn March 7, 2024, Japanese girl group Atarashii Gakko! released a track called \"Ghostbusters: Frozen Summer\" as a collaboration with Sony Pictures Entertainment Japan, which samples the titular song for the 1984 film by Ray Parker Jr. The score album was released through Sony Classical Records, digitally on March 22 and in physical CDs on April 12.\nCritical reception\nFilmtracks.com wrote \"Marianelli's competent and occasionally impressive toil for this film simply reinforces the achievement realized by Simonsen for the previous film.\" Anton Smit of Soundtrack World wrote \"Marianelli did a stellar job mixing his creative mind with Bernstein's legacy, which is worthy for the next generation of Ghostbusters.\"\nTrack listing\nChart performance\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Chart performance for Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n! scope=\"col\" | Chart (2024)\n! scope=\"col\" | Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Scottish Albums (OCC)\n| 72\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | UK Album Sales (OCC)\n| 49\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | UK Physical Albums (OCC)\n| 48\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | UK Soundtrack Albums (OCC)\n| 1\n|}\nReferences"
