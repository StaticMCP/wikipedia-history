He was also known as Atsunari-shinnō.\nAtsuhira was the second son of Emperor Ichijō.  His mother, Fujiwara no Akiko/Shōshi (藤原彰子) (988–1074), was a daughter of Fujiwara no Michinaga. In her later years, Ichijō's chūgo consort was known as Jōtō-mon In (上東門院).\nEvents of Go-Ichijō's life\nAtsuhira-shinnō was used as a pawn in Imperial court politics when he was only a child.\n* 1012 (Chōwa 1, 8th month): Prince Atsuhira marries a daughter of sesshō and later kampaku Fujiwara no Michinaga.\nAtsuhira became emperor at the age of 8, upon the abdication of his first cousin once removed, Emperor Sanjō.\n* March 10, 1016 (Chōwa 5, 29th day of the 1st month): In the 5th year of Emperor Sanjō's reign (三条天皇五年), he abdicated; and the succession (‘‘senso’’) was received by a cousin.  Shortly thereafter, Emperor Go-Ichijō is said to have acceded to the throne (‘‘sokui’’).\nDuring the initial years of Go-Ichijō's reign, Fujiwara no Michinaga actually ruled from his position as sesshō (regent).\n* June 5, 1017 (Kannin 1, 9th day of the 5th month): The former-Emperor Sanjō died at the age of 41.\n* 1017 (Kannin 1, 8th month): Prince Atsuakira, the eldest son of Emperor Sanjo, had been named Crown Prince.  But after he is struck by a skin disease and intense pressure from Michinaga; he withdrew from this role and his younger brother, Prince Atsunaga, was named Crown Prince in his place.\n* 1017 (Kannin 1, 9th month): Michinaga made a pilgrimage to the Iwashimizu Shrine accompanied by many courtiers.  The travelers divided themselves amongst 15 boats for a floating trip down the Yotogawa River.  One of the vessels overturned, and more than 30 people lost their lives.\n* 1017 (Kannin 1, 12th month): Michinaga was elevated to the office of Daijō-Diajin.\n* May 15, 1036 (Chōgen 9, 17th day of the 4th month): Emperor Go-Ichijō died at the age of 27.\nThe actual site of Go-Ichijō's grave is known.  This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (misasagi) at Kyoto.\nThe Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Go-Ichijō's mausoleum.  It is formally named Bodaijuin no misasagi.\nKugyō\nis a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court's actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.\nIn general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.  These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.  During Go-Ichijō's reign, this apex of the Daijō-kan included:\n* Sesshō, Fujiwara Michinaga, 966–1027.\n* Sesshō, Fujiwara Yorimichi, 992–1074.\n* Kampaku, Fujiwara Yorimichi.\n* Daijō-daijin, Fujiwara Michinaga.\n* Daijō-daijin, Kan'in Kinsue, 956–1029.\n* Sadaijin, Fujiwara Michinaga.\n* Sadaijin, Fujiwara Akimitsu, 944–1021.\n* Sadaijin, Fujiwara Yorimichi.\n* Udaijin, Fujiwara Sanesuke, 957–1046.\n* Nadaijin, Fujiwara Norimichi, 997–1075.\n* Dainagon\nEras of Go-Ichijō's reign\nThe years of Go-Ichijō's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or nengō.\n* Chōwa        (1012–1017)\n* Kannin             (1017–1021)\n* Jian    (1021–1024)\n* Manju  (1024–1028)\n* Chōgen      (1028–1037)\nConsort and children\nTomb of Emperor Go-Ichijō and one of his daughters, Kyoto\nGo-Ichijō had one Empress and two Imperial daughters.\nEmpress (Chūgū): Fujiwara no Ishi (藤原威子; 999–1036), Fujiwara no Michinaga’s third daughter\n* First Daughter: Imperial Princess Akiko/Shōshi (章子内親王) later Nijō-In (二条院), Empress (chūgū) to Emperor Go-Reizei\n* Second Daughter: Imperial Princess Kaoruko/Keishi (馨子内親王; 1029–1093) later Saien-no Kogo (西院皇后), Empress (chūgū) to Emperor Go-Sanjō\nAncestry\n|1= 1.
