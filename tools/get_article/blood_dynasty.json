The album was released on 28 March 2025. It is Arch Enemy's first studio album to feature guitarist Joey Concepcion, following the departure of Jeff Loomis from the band in 2023, although Loomis is featured on the bonus tracks \"Break the Spell\" and \"Moths\".\nPromotion\nOn 31 July 2024, Arch Enemy surprise-released their standalone single \"Dream Stealer\" and premiered its accompanying music video at 6 p.m. CET.\nThe band debuted the then-unreleased track \"Liars & Thieves\" live on 3 October 2024, during the opening concert of the Rising from the North tour, which featured In Flames as co-headliners and Soilwork as special guests. The following day, Arch Enemy officially announced their upcoming album Blood Dynasty, scheduled for release on 28 March 2025.\nOn 17 October 2024, the band released \"Liars & Thieves\" as the album's second single. A music video composed of live footage from the first two weeks of the Rising from the North tour accompanied the release.\nTo support the new album, Arch Enemy launched the Largo Camino Al Inframundo... tour in Mexico on 12 November 2024. Shortly thereafter, on 25 November, the band announced the European Blood Dynasty tour, a headlining run with support from Amorphis, Eluveitie, and Gatecreeper.\nOn 27 November 2024, Arch Enemy revealed that the album's title track would be released as the third single. It was officially released on 4 December 2024, with its music video premiering the same day on the band's official YouTube channel at 6 p.m. CET.\nFurther expanding their tour plans, the band announced the North American Blood Dynasty tour on 18 December 2024. This headlining tour, featuring support from Fit for an Autopsy, Baest, and Thrown into Exile, was the band's first tour to take place after the release of Blood Dynasty.\nOn 3 February 2025, it was confirmed that the fourth single, \"Paper Tiger\", would be released on 6 February, accompanied by a new music video.\nJust days after the album's release, the band announced on 31 March 2025 via social media a fifth music video, for the track \"A Million Suns\", which premiered on 2 April 2025.\nFollowing some teasers shared via the band's social media platforms, the sixth music video - for the song \"Illuminate the Path\" - premiered on 20 August 2025, directed by long-time collaborator Patric Ullaeus.\nOn 15 September 2025, less than one month since the previous single, the band announced that the bonus track \"Break the Spell\" (which was, at the time, exclusive to physical copies of the album) would be released as a single and video two days later. Alongside the release of the track on streaming platforms, the band announced a digital-exclusive re-release of Blood Dynasty, set to feature not only \"Break the Spell\" and \"Moths\", but also a brand new track, titled \"Lachrymatory\". The re-release of Blood Dynasty is scheduled for 10 October 2025, coinciding with the beginning of the band's European Blood Dynasty 2025 Tour; the album also has an alternate artwork than the original release.\nBackground\nThe cover artwork of Blood Dynasty was created by artist Alex Reisfar, who previously created the artworks for Arch Enemy's albums Will to Power (2017) and Deceivers (2022).\nUpon announcing the album, founding member and guitarist Michael Amott stated that Blood Dynasty will surpass fans' expectations for an Arch Enemy album, saying, \"This new album pushes the boundaries of what we've done before — it's everything you've come to expect from this band, and then some! We can't wait for you to hear it and feel the energy we've poured into every track. Welcome to the 'Blood Dynasty'!\"\nTrack 9 of Blood Dynasty is a cover of the song \"Vivre Libre\" by the French heavy metal band Blaspheme. This is the first time in their career that Arch Enemy have released a cover as a track on the standard edition of an album rather than on the deluxe edition. As there is a cover on the main track listing, two of the bonus tracks (\"Break the Spell\" and \"Moths\") are original songs written by Arch Enemy, and the third bonus track in the Japanese edition (\"Evil Dead\") is a Death cover.\nRelease formats\nBlood Dynasty has been available for pre-order since the album announcement in various CD and vinyl formats, including standard editions and multiple limited edition variants with exclusive colours and packaging. Preorder bundles including the album and merchandise such as t-shirts are also available through the Arch Enemy store and Rebellion Republic.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nArch Enemy\n* Alissa White-Gluz – vocals\n* Michael Amott – guitars\n* Joey Concepcion – guitars\n* Sharlee D'Angelo – bass\n* Daniel Erlandsson – drums, keyboards, sound effects\nAdditional personnel\n* Jens Bogren – production, engineering, mixing, mastering\n* Michael Amott – co-production\n* Daniel Erlandsson – co-production\n* Jacob Hansen – production, mixing, mastering\n* Tony Lindgren – mastering\n* Johan Martin – mixing assistance\n* Jeff Loomis – guitars\n* Raphael Liebermann – cello\n* Alexander Khromov – engineering\n* Francesco Ferrini – keys, orchestrations\n* Alexander Backlund – drum tech, tuning\n* S.
