The first citation mistakenly refers to this site as 'Musfa', a site which actually lies a few kilometres to the north. The Jebel is the adjacent mountain to the immediate north. The al-Salayli site (also termed al-Wuqbah or al-Wuqayb) attracted the attention of archaeologists because of an abandoned copper mine, extensive slag fields, ruined settlements and numerous Early Iron Age tombs. Nestled between the mountains, this site is still relatively well preserved. The settlement ruins date to the Early Iron Age and the Muslim Period. At the lower end of a wadi, the hut tombs, designated stie 1, lie 400 m west of an abandoned copper mine, to which they probably originally owed their existence.\nSee also\n* Archaeology of Oman\n* List of archaeological sites by country\n* Pre-Islamic recent period\nReferences\nSources\n*G.
