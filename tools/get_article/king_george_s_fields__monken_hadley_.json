The King George's Fields Foundation was established to give grants for the establishment of playing fields, the work of the foundation is now undertaken by charity Fields in Trust. King George's Fields (Monken Hadley) has been legally protected since July 1955.\nHabitat\nThe site consists of a patchwork of fields, intersected by overgrown hedgerows, narrow strips of woodland and small streams. There are a number of magnificent old oaks, and breeding birds include sparrowhawk, stock dove, bullfinch, willow warbler and chaffinch. There are also a number of common butterflies and the uncommon chimney sweeper moth.\nThe Shirebourne brook runs north–south through the fields.\nLocation\nThere are entrances from Hadley Green Road, Burnside Close and South Close. On the other side of Hadley Green Road is Hadley Green, the traditional site of the Battle of Barnet in the War of the Roses in 1471. The London Loop walk passes through the site.\nSee also\n* List of King George V Playing Fields in London\n* Barnet parks and open spaces\n* Nature reserves in Barnet\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links"
