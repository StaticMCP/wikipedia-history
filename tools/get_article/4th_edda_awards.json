The awards were hosted by TV presenters Valgerður Matthíasdóttir and the previous year's Best Television Personality Logi Bergmann Eiðsson.\nThe Professional Awards were divided into three categories (Screenplay, Visual Design and Sound and Cinematography). Short films got their own category as well. As in previous years the public was able to cast their votes online. The Icelandic Film and Television Academy had 70% say in the results and the public 30%. Except for the Best Television Personality where the public had 100% say in the results. Around 800 people cast their votes online up to the awards.\nThe film Hafið, directed by Baltasar Kormákur received most nominations. The film was nominated for twelve awards in nine categories and won eight. Kormákur personally won two of those awards for directing and screenwriting. He dedicated his Best Film award to the National Theater of Iceland with these words: \"Án leikhússins væri kvikmyndagerðin fátækari\" (\"Without this theater filmmaking would be poor\"). And that it pleased him to see so many great actors who had worked in the theater receive their awards that evening.\nAnother interesting film among the critics was the animated children's film , which was nominated in two categories and won one award.\nBest Actor Gunnar Eyjólfsson was away with the Icelandic national chess team in Slovenia on the night of the ceremony, and accepted his award through Kormákur's mobilephone to great amusement.\nNew categories\n* Edda Award for Best Visual Design\n* Edda Award for Best Sound and Cinema Photography\n* Edda Award for Best Short Film\n* Edda Award for Best Music Video\nResults\n]]\nThe nominees and winners were: (Winners highlighted in bold)\nBest Film:\n* Fálkar, directed by Friðrik Þór Friðriksson\n* Hafið, directed by Baltasar Kormákur\n* Regína, directed by María Sigurðardóttir\nBest Director:\n* Baltasar Kormákur, for Hafið\n* Gunnar Karlsson, for\n* Óskar Jónasson, for 20/20 og Áramótaskaupið 2001\nBest Actor:\n* Gunnar Eyjólfsson, for Hafið\n* Hilmir Snær Guðnason, for Hafið and Reykjavík Guesthouse Rent a Bike\n* Keith Carradine, for Fálkar\nBest Actress:\n* Elva Ósk Ólafsdóttir, for Hafið\n* Guðrún S.
