The conflict continued for much of the next decade as an insurgency emerged to oppose the coalition forces and the post-invasion Iraqi government. US troops were officially withdrawn in 2011. The invasion occurred as part of the George W. Bush administration's war on terror following the September 11 attacks.\nOverview of articles\nTop level overview articles\n* Iraq War\n* 2003 invasion of Iraq\nMajor overview subdivisions\n* Prelude to the Iraq War\n* Rationale for the Iraq War\n* Occupation of Iraq (2003–2011)\n** American occupation of Ramadi\n* Iraqi insurgency (2003–2011)\n* Anbar campaign (2003–2011)\n* Fallujah during the Iraq War\n* Execution of Saddam Hussein (2006)\n* Iraqi civil war (2006–2008)\n* Iraq War troop surge of 2007\n* Withdrawal of United States troops from Iraq (2007–2011)\nTimelines\n* Timeline of the Iraq War\n** Timeline of the 2003 invasion of Iraq\n** Timeline of the Iraq War troop surge of 2007\n* Iraq disarmament timeline 1990–2003\n* Timeline of Saddam–al-Qaeda conspiracy allegations\n* Timeline of the Plame affair\nYears in Iraq\n2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011\nBackground to the Iraq War\nHistorical background\n* Cold War\n* Iraqi–Kurdish conflict\n* British foreign policy in the Middle East\n** Iraq–United Kingdom relations\n* United States foreign policy in the Middle East\n** Iraq–United States relations\nBefore 1990\n* 14 July Revolution\n* Ramadan Revolution\n* 17 July Revolution\n* Iranian Revolution\n* 1979 Ba'ath Party Purge\n* Iran–Iraq War\n** United States support for Iraq during the Iran–Iraq War\n** British support for Iraq during the Iran–Iraq War\n*** Arms-to-Iraq affair (Scott Report)\n** Iraqi chemical attacks against Iran\n** Anfal campaign\n** Iran–Contra affair\n1990–2001\n* Gulf War (1990–1991)\n** Iraqi invasion of Kuwait\n** Nayirah testimony\n* International sanctions against Iraq (1990–2003)\n* Iraqi uprisings (1991)\n* Iraqi no-fly zones conflict (1991–2003)\n** Operation Provide Comfort\n* United Nations Special Commission regarding Iraq's use of weapons of mass destruction (1991–1998)\n* Oil-for-Food Programme (1995–2003)\n** Oil-for-Food Program Hearings (2004–2005)\n* Iraq Liberation Act (1998)\n* 1998 bombing of Iraq\n* September 11 attacks (2001)\n** Motives for the September 11 attacks\n** Aftermath of the September 11 attacks\n*** Authorization for Use of Military Force of 2001\n*** Patriot Act\n* War on terror\n* 2001 anthrax attacks\n* War in Afghanistan (2001–2021)\n** United States invasion of Afghanistan (2001)\nParticipants of the Iraq War\nMulti-National Force – Iraq\nescorting Iraqi prisoners of war to a holding area in the desert, 21 March 2003.]]\n* Balad Air Base\n* Multi-National Division - Baghdad\n* Multinational Division Central-South\n* Multi-National Division (South-East)\n* Multi-National Force West\n* Multi-National Security Transition Command – Iraq\nMarch 2003 invasion forces\n*  United States\n** Foreign policy of the George W.
