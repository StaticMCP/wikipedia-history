He advocated constitutional government, decreed the Imposed March Constitution in March 1849 which was never enacted, and in 1849 promulgated the Gemeinde (municipality) legislation that granted governmental autonomy to all municipalities in the Austrian empire.  Lewis Namier, in 1848: The Revolution of the Intellectuals (p. 18), calls him \"one of the most enlightened and efficient Austrian administrators.\"\nExternal links\n* [http://www.aeiou.at/aeiou.encyclop.s/s743774.htm;internal&action=_setlanguage.action?LANGUAGE=en AEIOU | Franz Stadion, Graf von Warthausen]\nBibliography\n* R.
