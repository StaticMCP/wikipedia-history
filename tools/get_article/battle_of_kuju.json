The Goryeo general Kang Kam-ch'an dammed a stream and released it as the Liao troops were crossing. Despite suffering significant casualties, Liao troops marched to Gaegyeong, the capital of Goryeo.\nDuring their campaign, general Kang Kam-ch'an cut the supplies of the Liao troops and harassed them relentlessly. Exhausted, the Liao troops decided to retreat hastily northward. Monitoring the movement of their troops, general Kang Kamch'an attacked them in the vicinity of Gwiju, ending in a complete victory for the Goryeo dynasty. The battle is considered one of the greatest victories in Korean military history.\nAftermath\nAfter the battle, peace negotiations followed and the Liao dynasty did not invade Korea again. Korea agreed to break off relations with the Song and have tributary relations with the Liao, but kept its newly gained territories at the Yalu river. According to historian Bielenstein however, Goryeo maintained diplomatic relations with Song rather than break relations, Hyeonjong kept his own reign title, and the Goryeo and Liao had concluded peace as equals in 1022. After the conflict's end, Korea entered in a long and peaceful period with its foreign neighbours across the Yalu River.\nSee also\n* Goryeo-Khitan Wars\n* First Goryeo-Khitan War\n* Second Goryeo-Khitan War\n* Third Goryeo-Khitan War\n* Kang Kamch'an\n* Siege of Kusong\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
