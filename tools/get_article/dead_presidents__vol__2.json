It was released on April 2, 1996, through Capitol Records. After the success of the first soundtrack, Capitol Records decided to release a second soundtrack. However, this one failed to match the success of the first, only reaching #45 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Like the first, it consists of 1970s era funk and soul music.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel and credits\n* Executive-Producer – Albert Hughes, Allen Hughes, Darryl Porter\n* Executive-Producer [Co-Executive] – Bonnie Greenberg\n* Art Direction – Jeff Fey\n* Soundtrack Coordinator – Kim Niemi, Lisa Brown\n* Design – Kevin Hosmann\n* Management – Ira Selsky, Jill Meyers\n* Mastered – Wally Traugott\n* Production Assistant – Annmarie Deringer, Tonya Sanders\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1996)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak position\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
