However the other USAAF support commands (Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); Air Transport Command (ATC) or Troop Carrier Command) commanded a significant number of airfields in a support roles.\nIt is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor airfields\nFirst Air Force\n* Dow AAF, Bangor\n: 7th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Was: Dow Air Force Base (1947 – 1968)\n: Now: Bangor Air National Guard Base and Bangor International Airport\nAir Transport Command\n* Presque Isle AAF, Presque Isle\n: North Atlantic Wing, ATC\n: 494th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Was: Presque Isle Air Force Base (1948 – 1961)\n: Now: Northern Maine Regional Airport at Presque Isle\n* Houlton AAF, Houlton\n: North Atlantic Wing, ATC\n: 378th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Now: Houlton International Airport\nBibliography\n* Maurer, Maurer.
