In 1893 he entered Cambridge University Library and served as an under-librarian.\nHis life was devoted to the library and to bibliography. He edited the Annals of the library, and his chief works for it were a Catalogue of Early English Printed Books, four vols., 1900–1907; a Catalogue of the Bradshaw Collection of Irish Books, three vols., 1916.
