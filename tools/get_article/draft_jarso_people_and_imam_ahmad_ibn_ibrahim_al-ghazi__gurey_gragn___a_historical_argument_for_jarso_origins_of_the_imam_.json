Today, major Jarso settlements include Tuliguled, Jigjiga, Biyada, Ejersa Goro, Jarso Woreda, Chinaksen (Jinacsani), Funyaan Bira, Hargaya, Gidaya and Hubat [1].\nA distinctive feature of Jarso society is its ancient customary law known as Xeerka Jaarso or Xeerka Lixda Jaarso, a codified clan-law system which, according to oral history, is over 1,200 years old [2]. This elaborate legal tradition suggests that the Jarso historically held prominent leadership roles in the region.\nThe Jarso in the Adal Sultanate\nDuring the 16th century, the Adal Sultanate was engaged in prolonged conflict with the Christian Abyssinian Empire. The Muslim leader Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi—known in Ethiopian chronicles as Ahmed Gragn (“the Left-Handed”)—launched his famous campaigns between 1529 and 1543.\nAccording to Arab Faqih’s Futūḥ al-Ḥabasha (“The Conquest of Abyssinia”), the first clans to heed the Imam’s call to jihad were from his immediate support base. Oral Jarso tradition maintains that the “Jairan” referenced in the chronicle were, in fact, the Jarso, and that they were entrusted with guarding the Imam’s left flank in battle [3].\nLocal historians argue that this early and privileged military role strongly suggests close kinship ties—possibly indicating that the Imam himself hailed from the Jarso.\nHargaya Sub-Clan Connection\nA branch of the Warra-Sayo division of the Jarso is known as Hargaya. Historically, Hargaya was also the name of a Muslim polity on the Harar plateau during the medieval period. Futūḥ al-Ḥabasha notes that people of Hargaya supplied soldiers to the Imam’s army [4].\nModern Jarso oral history merges these identities:\nThe Hargaya sub-clan of Warra-Sayo still inhabits Hubat, Gidaya, and Hargaya territories—precisely the same regions associated with the Imam’s family.\nSome scholars identify the Imam’s brother as the chief of Hargaya before the campaigns began [5].\nHarla, Assimilation, and Overlapping Territories\nAnother layer of complexity involves the Harla people, an extinct Cushitic-speaking Muslim group of the Horn of Africa. Some historians claim that Imam Ahmad was of Harla descent [6], while others argue he was Somali.\nThe Jarso are Somali in origin, speak the Oromo language, and share land and cultural ties with the Harari. Local tradition asserts that the Harla of this region were assimilated into the Warra-Sayo Jarso, merging both land and lineage over time.\nThis overlap means that—even if the Imam had Harla ancestry—by the 16th century his identity, political base, and loyalties may have been firmly Jarso within the Adal Sultanate.\nHistorical Argument for Jarso Origin\nFirst Responders: Oral tradition aligns with Futūḥ al-Ḥabasha in naming the Jarso/Warra-Sayo as among the earliest to answer the jihad call.\nMilitary Trust: Commanding the left flank suggests strong familial or clan loyalty.\nHargaya Link: His brother reportedly ruled Hargaya; the Jarso Hargaya sub-clan still inhabits the same region.\nCultural Leadership: Jarso’s codified xeer reflects a tradition of political authority capable of producing a leader like the Imam.\nAssimilation Factor: Possible Harla ancestry does not contradict Jarso identity due to integration and shared territory.\nTaken together, these strands of evidence present a compelling argument that Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi may have been from the Jarso clan—specifically the Warra-Sayo Hargaya branch.\nReferences\nLewis, I.M.
