It provides air charter and cargo services throughout the Eastern Caribbean.\nServices and fleet\nWindward Express operates chartered and cargo flights to 27 destinations throughout the Caribbean. The airline flies routes primarily to the Islands of St Barthélemy and Saba from Sint Maarten. It also offers day trips to Anguilla and Sint Eustatius.\nAs of summer 2024, Windward Express operates a single Britten-Norman BN-2 Islander (registered PJ-WED). Thanks to its STOL (short take-off and landing) capabilities, the type is ideal for operations at airports with short runways in the Caribbean such as Saint-Barthélemy, Baillif, Les Saints, and Saba.\nWindward Express is one of only three airlines certified to land at Saba's short runway.\nFormer fleet\ntaking off at Gustaf III Airport in 2007]]\nWindward Express's fleet has contracted in recent years. The airline used to operate the following additional aircraft:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Aircraft\n!No. of passengers\n!Regristration\n!Notes\n|-\n|Britten-Norman BN-2A-26 Islander\n|9\n|PJ-WEA\n|Destroyed in Hurricane Irma 2017\n|-\n|Britten-Norman BN-2B-20 Islander\n|9\n|PJ-WEB\n|Under possible rebuild after crash in Feb. 2023.\n|-\n|Piper PA-23 Aztec\n|4-5\n|PJ-WEC\n|Last confirmed flight: Jan. 2020\n|}\nAccidents\nOn 13 February 2023, a Windward Express BN-2B-20 Islander (registered PJ-WEB) sustained substantial damage while landing at the Saba-Juancho E. Yrausquin Airport (SAB / TNCS). The aircraft struck the ground to the left and approximately one meter before the threshold of runway 12. With the main landing gear severely bent, the aircraft subsequently made a hard landing on the runway. The pilot, two passengers, and a dog exited the aircraft unharmed.\nWeather was ruled as the main factor in the accident. Rain showers were reported in the area at the time of the accident, and a heavy downdraft likely forced the aircraft into the terrain.\nThe airframe of PJ-WEB was subsequently dismantled on the apron of the airport, suggesting an attempt to transport and/or rebuild the aircraft. Satellite data from March 2024 shows the pieces of the airframe still at Saba airport.\nSee also\n*List of airlines of the Netherlands Antilles\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.windwardexpress.com/ Windward Express]"
