It ended with a victory for the French, but the Russians retreated in good order to Smolensk.\nPrelude\nBagration had reinforced Neverovsky's division with some cavalry and left it at an advance position around Krasnoi (Krasny) to cover westwards in the direction of Orsha.\nBattle\nNey's infantry drove him out of Krasnoi and captured part of his artillery, the first trophies of the entire campaign. Neverovsky assembled his 6,000 to 7,000 men into a huge square Ney's cavalry could not break. The square moved across the field over a palisade fence and Ney's cavalry could not follow. Neverovsky's troops were able to get away in good order but left 1,500 men behind.\nИллюстрация к статье «Красный» № 1.
