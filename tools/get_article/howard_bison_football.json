The two schools call their intense rivalry Battle of \"The Real HU\".\nHoward also has a strong rivalry with Morgan State University in the Howard–Morgan State football rivalry.\nAnother of Howard's historic rivals is Morehouse College, more popularly known as the Howard/\"Spel-House\" rivalry due to Morehouse's close association with the all-women's HBCU Spelman College. This rivalry is not often played because Morehouse is a Division II athletic program, while Howard is Division I.\nSee also\n*List of black college football classics\nNotes\n:A.Howard went 9–1 and won the MEAC championship in 1987, however a later investigation by Howard University and MEAC found that coach Willie Jeffries used ineligible players. All wins from the 1987 season were vacated and the MEAC Championship was transferred to Delaware State, who had been the runner-up.\n:B.Rayford Petty was an assistant coach under Gary Harrell in 2011 and 2012. Gary Harrell stepped away from coaching Howard for the 2013 season for personal reasons, but remained under contract as the head coach to return in 2014. Rayford Petty was promoted to head coach for the 2013 season only, in a temporary role.\nFuture non-conference opponents\nAnnounced schedules as of August 18, 2025\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|-\n| vs Florida A&M (Miami Gardens, FL)\n| vs Alabama A&M (Atlanta, GA)\n|\n| Princeton\n| at Princeton\n| at San Jose State\n|-\n| at Temple\n| at  Indiana\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| vs Morehouse (East Rutherford, NJ)\n| at Rutgers\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| vs Hampton (Washington, DC)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| at Richmond\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| at Sacred Heart\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| at Tennessee State\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
