The Syrian government's reaction to the protests became violent on 16 March, and deadly on 18 March, when four unarmed protesters were killed in Daraa.\nFor the background of those protests, see: Background of the Syrian protests (2011).\nJanuary–February 2011\n* 26 or 28 January: In the large northern city of Al-Hasakah, a man, Hasan Ali Akleh, soaks himself with gasoline and sets himself on fire, in the same way Tunisian Mohamed Bouazizi had in Tunis on 17 December 2010. According to eyewitnesses, the action was \"a protest against the Syrian government\".\n* 28 January – An evening demonstration was held in Raqqa, to complain about the killing of two soldiers of Kurdish descent.\n* 31 January: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad criticizes Israel's external role in its domestic affairs\n* 2 February: Suhair Atassi leads a sit-in Bab Tuma to protest \"systematic looting and the continuing monopoly of Syria's two mobile phone operators, MTN and Syriatel.\" A group of 20 people in civilian clothing beat and dispersed 15 people who had been holding a candlelight vigil at Bab Tuma in Damascus for Egyptian demonstrators, Human Rights Watch reported.\n* 3 February: Syrian opposition groups call on Facebook and Twitter for a \"day of rage\" on Friday 4 February. This does not lead to protests in Syria on 4 February. A \"Day of Rage\" was called for in Syria from 4–5 February on social media sites Facebook and Twitter. Protesters demanded governmental reform.  Most protests took place outside of Syria, and were small. The protests were expected to begin on 4 February, as social media mobilised the Syrian people for rallies demanding freedom, human rights, and the end to the country's state of emergency. Protests were also scheduled for 5 February in front of the parliament in Damascus, and at Syrian embassies internationally. Al Jazeera reported increased security for the planned \"Days of Rage.\"\n* 4 February: Syrian protesters call for a day of anger against the government.\n* 5 February: In  Al-Hasakah, hundreds of people demonstrate for political reform and an end to emergency law. When hundreds of protesters in Al-Hasakah participated in a mass demonstration, calling for al-Assad's departure, Syrian authorities arrested dozens, and another demonstration was quickly triggered. Suhair Atassi, who runs the banned Jamal Atassi Forum, called for political reforms and the reinstatement of civil rights, as well as for an end to the emergency law that has been in place since 1962. However, no protests occurred on either date. After the failure of attempts to arrange a \"Day of Rage,\" Al Jazeera described the country as \"a kingdom of silence\".  It identified the key factors underlying Syrian stability as the country's strict security measures, the popularity of President Bashar al-Assad, and fear of potential sectarian violence in the aftermath of a government ouster (akin to neighbouring Iraq).\n* 17 February: A spontaneous demonstration broke out outside the Al-Hamidiyah Souq market in Damascus to protest a police beating of a shop keeper. Several men gathered and blocked a road, while chanting that \"The Syrian people will not be humiliated\". An eyewitness estimated that there were more than 1,500 demonstrators. Secret police officers arrived on the scene quickly, along with several government officials and finally Syria's interior minister, who dispersed the demonstrators, took the shop owner into his car, and promised an investigation. A couple of hours later, several videos of the events were posted on YouTube.\n* 23 February: Syria's justice minister defends the state of emergency by pointing at the state of war with Israel. A proposal of one parliament member to evaluate the harsh emergency laws was voted down with 249 against one MP. During a routine session of the Syrian Parliament, a member proposed that harsh emergency laws be reviewed. The issue was not scheduled for discussion, and its introduction came as a surprise. A pro-government official who was at the session recalled it with anger. The proposal was rapidly quashed, when the speaker put the proposed review to a vote in the chamber, but none of the other 249 MPs supported it.\n1–17 March\n* 6 March: In the southern city of Daraa, fifteen teenagers were arrested for writing \"\" – (\"the people want the regime to fall\" on walls across the city. The military police tortured them, or had carried  them handcuffed out of their classroom.\n:A number of boys under 15 years of age were arrested in Daraa, for writing on the walls of the city a slogan of the 2010–11 Arab uprisings that: \"the people want to overthrow the regime\".  In Lebanon, four brothers, all of them Syrian opposition activists, went missing shortly after passing out flyers in front of the Syrian embassy in Beirut, calling for a demonstration to oppose Syria's government. TIME said that the commitment could still be found among the Syrian youth, but that what was needed was a starting point. Ribal al-Assad said that it was almost time for Syria to be the next domino.\n* 7 March: One day before the 48th anniversary of the 8 March 1963 coup d'état, which led to a permanent state of emergency in force ever since, thirteen political prisoners in Syria went on hunger strike, demanding an end to political arrests and the restitution of rights that have been removed from civil and political life.\n* 7–13 March: Syrian political prisoners went on a hunger strike to protest against \"political detentions and oppression\" in Syria.

The Syrian Foreign Ministry stated that Syria was monitoring with high concern \"the tragic developments in the brotherly country of Libya\". Syrian newspaper Al-Watan said that the Syrian government welcomed the fall of Mubarak's regime, and was looking forward to a new leadership that does not \"cover for Israeli violations\". The Reform Party of Syria asserted that \"al-Assad is sending arms to Gaddafi to kill his people with\".\n* 11 March: Reuters reports ‘a large shipment of weapons and explosives and night-vision goggles … in a truck coming from Iraq’ carrying 'dozens of grenades and pistols as well as rifles and ammunition belts’ is seized at the southern Tanaf crossing near Jordan. The driver said the weapons had been loaded in Baghdad and he was to be paid $5,000 to deliver them to Syria.\n* 12 March: Thousands of Syrian Kurds protested in Qamishli and in al-Hasakah, on the day of Kurdish martyrs, commemorating the 30 Kurds that were killed by police after riots broke out at a football game in March 2004.\n:Thousands of Syrian Kurds in Qamishli and in al-Hasakah protested on the day of Kurdish martyr, which is an annual event since 2004, when many Syrian kurds died in anti-government demonstrations.\n* 13 March: Kamal Hussein Cheikho, a Kurdish member of the Committee for the Defence of Democratic Liberties and Human Rights in Syria (CDF), was released on bail of 500 Syrian pounds ($10).

There were also unconfirmed news that Syrian revolution supporters of Libyan descent, stormed into the Syrian Embassy in Paris.\n:Another recently released political figure, Suhair Atassi,  became an unofficial spokesperson for the \"Syrian revolution\", when she was interviewed by dozens of Arab and international media channels regarding the uprising.  There were reports of 6 arrested in Damascus. Atassi paid tribute to \"the Syrian people who took the initiative ahead of the opposition,\" recalling the popular uprisings that shook Tunisia and Egypt After the first day of the uprising there were reports about approximately 3000 arrests and a few \"martyrs\", but there are no official figures on the number of deaths.\n* 16 March: Demonstrations took place in Marjeh Square in Damascus, near the Interior Ministry, calling for release of political prisoners.

Al Arabiya reported that the protesters were a mix of activists and jurists, writers, journalists, young academics, and family members to people detained in Syrian prisons.

The security forces arrested a number of protestors, Al Jazeera reported 25, while Al Arabiya said 32 including activist and lawyer Suhair Atassi and Kamal Cheikho, an activist who had been released two days earlier. World Organisation Against Torture published list of arrests and demanded immediate release of them.\n:Mohamed al-Ali, a spokesman for the Syrian Interior Authority denied that any demonstrations took place in Syria and said that the Facebook-campaign has proved unsuccessful. According to the spokesperson, the \"claimed protests\" consisted of a bunch of people who were \"hiding\" among the already packed souq and tried to make it look like a demonstration. In another statement, he finally acknowledged the protest but then turned it around by saying that the demonstration which was outside the Interior Authority's building was actually in support of President Bashar al-Assad.\n* 17 March: Protests that had begun the previous day in Daraa continued.\n18–25 March\n* Friday 18 March: Named \"Friday of Dignity\" () by some protesters, after a call on Facebook page \"The Syrian Revolution 2011\"  protests for freedom and democracy and against corruption were held in several cities after Islamic Friday prayers, including Damascus, Daraa, Homs, Baniyas, Qamishli and Deir ez-Zor. It was called the most serious unrest to take place in Syria for decades.\n:In Daraa, possibly thousands of locals gathered – peacefully, according to some reports, but, according to a contemporary report by Israel's Arutz Sheva, armed – and marched through the city, chanting: \"God, Syria, Freedom\" and slogans against Rami Makhlouf, who is a cousin of al-Assad accused of benefitting from regime corruption. They demanded the release of the teenagers detained since 6 March and called for democracy, greater political freedom and an end to corruption.

Protesters call for Friday to be their biggest yet, in what they dub as \"the  Great Friday\" ().\n* Friday, 22 April: For the first time, major demonstrations occurred in Damascus itself. Other cities where protesting was particularly  strong were in Daraa, Baniyas, Qamishli, and Homs. The Douma and Harasta sections of Damascus were particularly filled with protesters. Firing throughout the country resulted 88 deaths among security forces and protesters, making it the bloodiest day so far.\n** Protests, slogans: On this day dubbed by activists \"Great Friday\" (), anti-government protests were held in at least 20 towns across Syria. Cries for vengeance mixed with calls for the government's fall. Security forces quelled the protests with live ammunition and tear gas. A protester from a Damascus suburb said via phone to  Al Jazeera  media network that peaceful demonstrators, going with olive branches, were surprised by the security forces’ shooting. A protester in Douma said to The New York Times: \"We are not scared anymore. We are sad and we are disappointed at this regime and at the president. Protests, demonstrations and death are now part of the daily routine\". In two Damascus suburbs, protesters tore down Assad's picture and demolished statues of Assad's father. In central Damascus after Friday Prayer at the al-Hassan Mosque, hundreds of people gathered. Some of them chanted: \"The people want the fall of the government\"; security forces dispersed the protests with tear gas, witnesses said.\n** Casualties: News media and war researchers are not unanimous on the number of civilian casualties on this day.  The New York Times  estimated on 23 April and on 6 May that number as: \"at least 109\". The Institute for the Study of War  in December 2011 agreed with that number and called 22 April the deadliest day in Syria between March and September 2011. But  Al Jazeera English  on 29 April 2011 estimated that on 22 April in Daraa alone already 100 people had been killed.  First counts of deaths were in Homs 21, in Izra 15 (for Daraa an initial death-toll was not published). Deaths also were reported in the Damascus suburbs Muadamiyat, Douma, Zamalka, Barza and Qabon.\n** Government reaction: At Friday night, Syrian state television aired a talk show where speakers blamed foreign media, like Al Jazeera, Al Arabiya and BBC Arabic, for inciting the protests. A New York Times reporter assumed that the Syrian government emphatically tried to keep the largest cities, Damascus and Aleppo, relatively subdued.\n* 23 April: In  Douma and Barza today tens of thousands buried protesters killed the previous day, when security forces fired into these crowds of mourners. Again 11 people were killed, activists and witnesses said. 250 Syrian soldiers were also sent to Harasta, another suburb of Damascus, to confront a \"violent gang\", a deserted soldier said in June 2011 to Amnesty International, but they did not find a gang there but only 2,000 unarmed protesters, and saw the secret police and security forces open fire on them.\n:The events of the previous, very bloody, day incited Al Jazeera to entitle the Syrian 2011 protests no longer as merely ‘protests’ but henceforward as an \"uprising\".\n:Throughout the country, funerals for fallen protesters occurred. Snipers reportedly fired, killing 8 people in Daraa with 5 members of the security forces among them.\n* 24 April: In the northern coastal city of Jableh a crackdown of security forces and Syrian army lasted into the night, killing twelve people. A resident said: \"The army is deployed all over the area (…) It’s a street war\". A Syrian human rights organisation said that nine civilians were killed in Jableh by security forces and pro-Assad gunmen.\n25–30 April\nAttack on Daraa\nBetween 25 April and 16 May 2011, the Syrian army attacked and occupied Daraa, since 18 March the most ardent centre of the Syrian protests. The army reportedly deployed 20 or 30 tanks, between hundreds and 6,000 troops, snipers on roofs, and helicopters with paratroopers for the final conquest of the focal Omari Mosque on Saturday 30 April. Presumably 244 civilians and 81 soldiers were killed; houses were reportedly searched to arrest protesters, houses were shelled; almost 1,000 men have reportedly been rounded up. \"They want to teach Syria a lesson by teaching Daraa a lesson\", a resident commented. There were rumours of soldiers, or an entire army division, having defected, and joined the protesters; these reports have not been independently verified.\nThe government claimed it was battling \"terrorist groups\" in Daraa. After withdrawal of part of the troops from Daraa on 5 May, army units remained deployed at the city's entrances.\n* 25 April: Tanks and soldiers entered Daraa and Douma. The border with Jordan was also closed. According to an activist, 18 people were killed in Daraa.\n* 27 April: The army continued its crack down into 27 April, and over the span of three days arrested over 500 people. Several dozen died from the raids. The Syrian government intensified their raids using more tanks and brigades. 2 Jordanian civilians were amongst those killed. On 27 April 233 members of the Ba'ath Party, amongst them parliament members, resigned over the violence against protesters and civilians.\n* 28 April: It has been confirmed that there are defections from within the Syrian army. Two battalions were sent into Deraa on 25 April, the fourth division and the fifth division. The fifth division refused to open fire on protesters, and there has been gun battles between the fourth and fifth divisions. The fourth division is controlled directly by Maher Assad, Bashar's brother.\n* 29 April: Bashar's forces have cut off Daraa's water supply and electricity several days ago, as well as other cities in Syria. They have confiscated flour and food as well, in an effort to starve the people of Daraa. Activists called for another Friday of protests, dubbed \"Solidarity with Daraa day\".\n:Protests occurred nationwide including in Damascus in order to show solidarity with Daraa. At least 62 civilians were reported killed, many from Daraa.\n* 30 April: The military increased their presence with more tanks and military helicopters. Snipers were positioned on buildings. Tanks began firing indiscriminately on houses, and also destroyed the local mosque. Snipers and military vehicles were also placed in other cities in the  country such as Homs. Activists had called for this week, starting this Sunday, to be the \"week of breaking the siege of Daraa\" with the aim of stopping the siege on Daraa.\nA video taken allegedly shows the dead bodies of protesters from Daraa wrapped in burial cloth and gathered and stored in a refrigerated room, as the people of Daraa are unable to burial them due to the military and sniper presence.\nBlockading of Douma\nDouma, a working-class suburb of capital Damascus that had also assumed a vital role in the Syrian protests (see reports 1, 3, 10, 15, 16, 22 and 23 April) was raided and blockaded by army and security forces for at least several days, end of April 2011.\n* Monday 25 April: In Douma security forces arrested probably handsful of people.\n* 26 April: According to a Human Rights Watch researcher, thousands of government troops raided homes in Douma to arrest suspected protesters.\n* 27+28 April: Douma was completely sealed off by security forces, with its residents in need of supplies.\nRemaining Syria\n* 25 April: The events of 25 April, especially those in Daraa (see above), incited the prominent international news media to entitle the Syrian protests since mid-March with hindsight no longer as merely ‘protests, but as an \"uprising\". Since 18 March 400 civilians and dozens of soldiers and policemen had been reported killed.\n:Apart from their actions in Daraa and Douma (see above), security forces also searched houses in Izra, 27 km north-north-east of Daraa, and entered Damascus-suburb Muadhamiya arresting probably handsful of people. Border crossings into Jordan near the southern town of Daraa were reportedly sealed.\n* 26 April: In the northern city of Jableh people were arrested, according to Rami Abdul-Rahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Syrian government said its actions are a response to an Islamist-inspired uprising.\n* 27 April: According to a report of refugees fled into Lebanon, on 27 April a massacre may have taken place in Talkalakh, 20 miles due west of Homs and near the north-Lebanese border. Syrian military allegedly separated Sunni Muslims from Alawi Shia Muslims; arrested a popular Sheikh; Sunnis took to the streets protesting; military in tanks opened fire, killing 40 residents. Also residents would have been dragged away and tortured. No other news channel has yet confirmed anything of this story.\n* 28 April: The leadership of the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood, in exile since in 1982 the Brotherhood was crushed by the government, has today for the first time since the demonstrations in Syria began in March, directly supported these protests: \"Do not let the regime besiege your compatriots. Chant with one voice for freedom and dignity. Do not allow the tyrant to enslave you. God is great.\"\n:Since March, 1,000 Syrians have crossed the border into Lebanon, most of them not via the official border crossings.\n* Friday 29 April: On this Friday dubbed \"day of rage\" in most major towns in Syria protests were held, like Homs, Baniyas, Latakia, Raqqa, Hama, Qamishli, Deir ez-Zor, and, for the first time, also in the heart of Damascus, in the Maidan district. 10,000 protesters in Baniyas reportedly shouted: \"liberty, solidarity with Daraa\" and \"down with the regime\", and 15,000 in Qamishli and surrounding towns were said to have yelled: \"With our soul and with our blood we will sacrifice ourselves for Daraa\". In Damascus-suburb Saqba protesters chanted: \"We’re the youth revolution, not thugs or terrorists\".\n:Apart from the 33 people killed in Daraa (see above), in Homs 25 people were reported killed, according to activists, and in  Rastan 17. The authorities said that today nine members of security forces were killed by \"terrorist groups\".\n:In Deir Ez-Zor, 1,000 people emerged from a mosque and were dispersed by security forces, told AFP.\n: In the small village Jiza near Daraa, 13-year-old boy Hamza al-Khatib was taken by his father to an anti-government rally. The boy disappeared,  taken in custody by Syrian officials according to Human Rights Watch. Almost a month later (see 25 or 28 May), according to activists, his tortured, badly injured, murdered body was returned to his parents; a video on YouTube purportedly showed gunshot wounds on Hamza’s body. Prominent Syrian activist Razan Zaitouneh considers this story plausible: she believes, the Syrian government wants the people to see this and understand that the most awful thing can happen to their family members in they continue to participate in this revolution. At that same demonstration, the 15-year-old boy Tamer Mohammed al Sharey from Jiza disappeared; a video released on 9 June by activists claimed his dead and tortured body also to be returned to his parents.\n* 30 April: Hassan Ismail Abdel Azim, a prominent human rights activist, is arrested from his office by Syrian authorities.\n:138 members of the Syrian Ba'ath Party quit in protest against the deadly crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, according to AFP information.
