In order in which they occur:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! English name\n! Local name\n! Description\n|----\n|Easter Monday\n|Lundi de Pâques\n|Monday after Easter\n|----\n|Ascension Day\n|Ascension\n|Thursday, 40 days after Easter\n|----\n|Whit Monday\n|Lundi de Pentecôte\n|Seventh Sunday after Easter\n|----\n|}\nNotes\nNew Year's Day, Easter, Labor Day, Independence Day, All Saints' Day and Christmas Day are widely recognized and celebrated holidays. The other holidays listed are officially recognized by the government's Department of Labor (Direction Départementale du Travail) and are granted to government workers; the government requires that businesses operating in the country also recognize them, though employees, if even familiar with them, tend to prefer working as usual (with government-mandated overtime wages) on those days.\nReferences\nSources\n*[http://mokili.free.fr/jours_feries.php Les jours fériés en République du Congo]"
