However, on Twitter, they revealed that they had taken a break from recording the album to collaborate with the multiplayer online battle arena game League of Legends, which was the band's favorite game at the time. They released \"Warriors\" for the game's 2014 World Championship. Following the music video being uploaded, \"Warriors\" was officially released as a single on September 18, 2014, through Kidinakorner and Interscope Records. Upon its release, Riot Games posted on their site regarding the song, \"To kick off the start of the action, we set out to craft a war cry to rally behind in a creative collaboration with Imagine Dragons. Whether you're a solo queue warrior or fighting off the LCS jitters –- every moment counts.\" The song also appears on the deluxe version of Smoke + Mirrors. In a 2021 interview with NME after the band released \"Enemy\" as a second collaboration with Riot Games for the League of Legends-adaptive show Arcane, Imagine Dragons frontman Dan Reynolds said that working with Riot Games \"just came out organically\" while playing for the 2014 World Championship in Seoul. He continued by saying that \"Nothing was forced, it was just fun. Playing Worlds was some of my favourite memories\".\n\"Warriors\" has been described as a rock and arena rock song. It was written by Imagine Dragons members Dan Reynolds, Wayne Sermon, Ben McKee, and Daniel Platzman, along with Josh Mosser and British record producer Alex da Kid, and produced by the band and Alex da Kid. It is two minutes and 50 seconds long and according to Universal Music Publishing Group's sheet music at Musicnotes.com, is in the key of E minor with a driving tempo with a 2 feel; it has a metronome of 152 beats per minute. Reynolds' vocals range two octaves throughout the song, from B3 to B5. Chris Payne of Billboard called the song \"anthemic\", whereas Alan Wen of NME said that it \"has the vibe of a tournament anthem\" and Ashima Grover of LeisureByte described the song as a \"Herculean track\". For Diffuser, Chuck Armstrong called the song \"grandiose\", featuring \"hard-hitting\" pianos and symphonic orchestral elements and that it could be a \"'let's get pumped up' jam\". The song begins with four quiet piano chords and then opens with the line \"As a child, you would wait / And watch from far away\"; other lyrics include \"Here we are, don't turn away now / We are the warriors that built this town / From dust\" and \"When you will have to rise / Above the best and prove yourself / Your spirit never dies\". Amanda \"Tania Mae\" Tan of One Esports noted that the lyrics \"speak to and speak about both pro players and League of Legends players... That is what sets 'Warriors' apart from all [other League of Legends World Championship songs]\".\nMusic video\n\"Warriors\" premiered with the debut of its music video on the League of Legends YouTube channel on September 17, 2014, to promote the 2014 League of Legends World Championship. Riot Games said in its description that \"We set out to craft a war cry to rally behind. Whether you’re a solo queue warrior or fighting off the LCS jitters – every moment counts.\" The scene aligned with the second verse of the song was particularly noted for involving two teams competing on opposite sides of a table on Summoner's Rift, \"a perfect reflection of 90s LAN gaming culture\".

It has been considered a fan-favorite amongst the League of Legends World Championship songs. Grover called it one of the game's songs that \"still reign supreme\", saying that it \"still sticks the landing as one of the most headstrong and best titles of the game. It both fits the game’s hype and builds a crescendo that is hard to beat to this date. Visualizing the gamers in their race to win the title, it’s still one of the grandest songs to invoke goosebumps\". In a 2025 ranking, members of the Esports.gg staff ranked it the third-best World Championship song out of the ones from 2014 to 2024, with their consensus being that that is \"timeless\", a \"classic\", and \"an anthem that has stood the test of time\", with members praising its build-up, chorus, and lyrics. The song topped the 2024 ranking of the Worlds songs by One Esports, for which Kristine \"Kurisu\" Tuting said \"Even after more than a decade, admit it you keep coming back to this classic\".\nUsage in media\n\"Warriors\" was used in the trailer for the 2015 film The Divergent Series: Insurgent and the final trailer for the 2017 film Wonder Woman. Slate's Matthew Dessem said regarding the latter trailer that when the song was paired with \"slow-motion footage of Wonder Woman single-handedly fighting World War I [...] the answer is a resounding 'who did you think was in charge here, anyway?'\" He also said that \"World War I [...] was decidedly less badass than an Imagine Dragons song, perhaps because Wonder Woman wasn't there\". Furthermore, he continued by stating that the Wonder Woman trailer would \"seamlessly\" blend in with other \"terrible\" DC films by using the song in the trailer, using The Skin I Live In as an example of being a \"more interesting movie buried under all the kickass guitar\" with Elena Anaya playing as a female counterpart of Fritz Haber.\nAdditionally, \"Warriors\" appears in the South Korean horror show Sweet Home. Alice O'Connor of Rock Paper Shotgun said that the song worked as \"the show's anthem for heroic moments\". It was also used as the official song for the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup. WWE Network also used the song as the official theme song for the WWE's Survivor Series 2015.\n(pictured) of Ateez released his own dance performance to \"Warriors\" in 2023.]]\nIn October 2023, San of South Korean boy band Ateez released a dance performance to \"Warriors\" to the group's channel. Choreography for the performance was also provided by BBtrippin and Tarzan. In the performance, San makes \"powerful\" moves and facial expressions to \"establish the vibe and fervour of the song's vibe\". The performance was met with praise from the group's fans, the Atinys, who compared his dancing to Ryomen Sukuna of Jujutsu Kaisen and that it \"can stand out as a music video on its own\". It was described by Grover as a \"ferocious anthem\" and that \"Even without the ATEEZ members by his side, his power-hungry roar can be heard from a distance\". In December of the same year, San also called \"Warriors\" one of his top picks for songs to listen to while traveling.\n2WEI and Edda Hayes version\nIn 2020, League of Legends collaborated with German composer team 2WEI and Edda Hayes for a cinematic music video with a cover of \"Warriors\" to begin the game's tenth season. The cover was described as \"grim, choral, and bwampy\", as well as \"slow and melodramatic\".\nThe music video begins with three concurrent scenes: a battle in a castle, a brawl in a building, and a creature-produced artifact. Throughout, it includes nine prior League of Legends champions with their own mini-stories. The video involves League of Legends characters Jayce, Lux, and Galio teaming up to win against Sylas and his followers. It also sees Marksman Champions Ezreal and Kai'Sa fight against various creatures and Vi be assisted by Cailyn for her sniper skills. Turing called the video \"absolutely spine-tingling\" and that \"Hayes' powerful vocals + 2WEI's composition = eargasm\" when writing about the cover for One Esports. Despite having minimal experience with League of Legends itself, Robert N. Adams of GameRevolution praised the video as \"some of the finest animation [he had] seen repping a video game in recent memory\".\nCredits and personnel\nCredits adapted from Apple Music and Spotify.\nImagine Dragons\n*Dan Reynolds – lead vocals, songwriter, producer\n*Wayne Sermon – guitar, songwriter, producer\n*Ben McKee – bass guitar, keyboards, songwriter, producer\n*Daniel Platzman – drums, percussion, songwriter, producer\nAdditional personnel\n*Christian Linke – string instrument, engineering\n*Josh Mosser – songwriter, recording\n*Alexander Grant – songwriter, producer\n*Sebastien Najand – orchestrator\n*Joe LaPorta – mastering\n*Manny Marroquin – mixing\n*Robert Root – engineering\nChart performance\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
