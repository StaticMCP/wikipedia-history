The first awards were made in 1931, and today, the Hopwood Program offers around $120,000 in prizes every year to aspiring writers at the University of Michigan. According to Nicholas Delbanco, UM English professor and former director of the Hopwood Awards Program, \"This is the oldest and best-known series of writing prizes in the country, and it is a very good indicator of future success.\"\nContests and prizes\nThe Graduate and Undergraduate Hopwood Contests\nAwards are offered in these genres: drama/screenplay, essay, the novel, short fiction, nonfiction, and poetry. These awards are classified under two categories, graduate or undergraduate, except the novel and drama/screenplay, which are combined categories. Award amounts for this contest vary, but usually fall in the range of $1000 to $6000.\nSummer Hopwood Contest\nThe Summer Hopwood Contest was discontinued in 2017, but archives of winning Summer Hopwood manuscripts continue to be held in the Hopwood Room. When it ran, the contest was open only to students who took writing courses during spring and summer terms. Awards were given in the categories of drama or screenplay, nonfiction, short fiction, and poetry. Novels were not eligible for the Summer Hopwood Contest.\nHopwood Underclassmen Contest\nThis contest is open only to freshmen and sophomores who are enrolled in writing courses. Awards are given in the categories of nonfiction, fiction, and poetry.\nHopwood Program\nThe Hopwood Program administers the Hopwood Award,  and several other awards in writing. It is located in the Hopwood Room at the University of Michigan and serves the needs and interests of Hopwood contestants. The room was established by Professor Roy W. Cowden, director of the Hopwood Awards from 1933 to 1952, who generously contributed a part of his library, which has grown through the addition of many volumes of contemporary literature. In addition to housing the winning manuscripts from the past years of the contests, the Hopwood Room has a lending library of 20th-century literature, a  generous supply of noncirculating current periodicals, some reference books on how to get published, information on graduate and summer writing\nprograms, and a collection of screen plays donated by former Hopwood winner Lawrence Kasdan.\nPrizes administered by the Hopwood Program\nThe Hopwood Program also administers these writing contests:\n{|\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* The Kasdan Scholarship in Creative Writing\n* Arthur Miller Award of the U-M Club of New York Scholarship\n* The Jeffery L.
