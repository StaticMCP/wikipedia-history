A posthumous publication is eligible only if the author has been deceased for over five years starting from the current year. The Akademi does not consider direct submissions from authors or publishers.\nSelection process\nThe Akademi will prepare a \"ground list\", shortlisted from a set of eligible books in each of the recognized languages. Each language will have an \"Advisory Board\" member, who will shortlist and form and send a panel consisting of not more than five members to the President of the Akademi.\nThe preliminary panel consists of ten referees, who are nominated by the President upon requests received from the members of the \"Advisory Board\". The recommendations received from members of the  \"Advisory Board\" of each languages will be compiled and sent to the corresponding referees, who in turn will select two entries.
