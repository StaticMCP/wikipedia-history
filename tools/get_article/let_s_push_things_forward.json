The song is performed by Mike Skinner and Kevin Mark Trail.\nCritical reception\n\"'Let's Push Things Forward' grew on me…\" remarked Pink Floyd's David Gilmour. \"It's forward-looking and anarchic. It has its own anti-big-company ethos, which I like. And it has strange little quirks of timing that I find very hard to use. Perhaps it will influence me in the future. I don't know. But it's nice to hear something that works which is outside your usual frame of reference.\"\nMusic video\nThe music video was directed by the Snorri Brothers and premiered in April 2002. It was filmed in South London with the first shot looking south in Deptford Church Street, London\nTrack listing\nCD 1\n# \"Let's Push Things Forward\" (Album Version)\n# \"Let's Push Things Forward\" (Studio Gangsters Mix)\n# \"Let's Push Things Forward\" (Zed Bias Dub Mix)\nCD 2\n# \"Let's Push Things Forward\" (Album Version)\n# \"All Got Our Runnins\"\n# \"Don't Mug Yourself\" (Instrumental)\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (2002)\n!align=\"center\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
