With only 20 working muskets and two shots per weapon, the troops refused to surrender. A British sergeant is said to have cried \"not bloody likely!\" when the Afghans tried to persuade the soldiers they would spare their lives.\nSniping then began, followed by a series of rushes; soon the hillock was overrun by tribesmen. An officer named Captain Thomas Alexander Souter was mistaken by the Afghans as a high-ranking officer because they thought he was wearing a general's yellow waistcoat. In fact the officer had wrapped the regimental colours of the 44th Foot around his body. He was dragged into captivity along with a sergeant named Fair and seven privates. The remaining troops were killed. Traces of weapons and equipment from the battle could be seen in the 1970s and as late as 2010, the bones of the dead still covered the hillside.\nReferences"
