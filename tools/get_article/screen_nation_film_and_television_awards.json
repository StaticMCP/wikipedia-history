A mask takes you from one state into another and in this case from being unrecognized and unrewarded to being recognized and celebrated\".\nAwards\nThe Screen Nation Film and TV Awards are given at a televised event that normally takes place in October during UK Black History Month. The awards ceremony—dubbed the \"Black BAFTAs\" by The Independent newspaper in 2003—brings together actors, actresses, directors and filmmakers from the British and international film and TV industry.\nIn 2016, Earl Cameron became the first inductee into the Screen Nation \"Hall of Frame\" at the BFI Southbank, where he was interviewed by Samira Ahmed.\nVoting\nThe Screen Nation Film and TV Awards are based on voting by the general public as well as the Screen Nation committee. The honorary and major awards, such as the Outstanding Contribution to Film and TV Award and the Edric Connor Inspiration Award, are decided by the Screen Nation Executive committee. The People's Choice categories—Favourite Male TV Star, Favourite Female TV Star, Favourite Music Performance on Film/TV, Favourite Presenter, Favourite Reality Star, International Film, US Male Screen Personality Film/TV, US Female Screen Personality Film/TV, West African Film Actor, West African Film Actress and West African Film—are all voted for by the public.\nThe 2007 awards ceremony saw actor Morgan Freeman honoured with the Outstanding Contribution Award, newsreader Moira Stuart honoured with the Edric Connor Inspiration Award and American TV director-producer Stan Lathan with the new Vanguard Award. A final honorary award - the Classic TV Award - was presented to the television series Roots in what was its 30th anniversary year.\nThe 2016 awards ceremony saw actor Wesley Snipes honoured with the Outstanding Contribution Award.\nIn 2017, the 12th Screen Nation awards took place. The Edric Connor Trailblazer award was given to Horace Ové.\n2018 winners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n! width=\"45%\" |Award\n! width=\"55%\" |Winner\n|-\n|Outstanding Contribution to Film and TV Award (Int) ||\n|-\n|Edric Connor Inspiration Award (UK) ||\n|-\n|Special Award ||\n|-\n|Rising Star||\n|-\n|Achievement in Film Production ||\n|-\n|Female Performance in Film ||\n|-\n|Male Performance in Film ||\n|-\n|Favourite International Movie ||\n|-\n|Favourite African UK Movie||\n|-\n|Favourite Film||\n|-\n|Favourite Male Screen Personality ||\n|-\n|Favourite Female Screen Personality ||\n|-\n|Independent Spirit Film Production ||\n|-\n|Male Performance in TV ||\n|-\n|Female Performance in TV ||\n|-\n|Favourite Male TV Personality ||\n|-\n|Favourite Female TV Personality ||\n|-\n|Emerging Talent ||\n|-\n|Diversity in Drama Production ||\n|-\n|Diversity in Factual Production ||\n|-\n|Favourite Grime Music Promo||\n|-\n|Favourite Comedy Production||Just a Couple by Sebastian Thiel\n|-\n|Favourite Black Broadcaster||\n|-\n| Favourite Reality TV Talent  ||\n|}\n|-\n|Outstanding Contribution to Film and TV Award (Int) ||Isaach De Bankole\n|-\n|Edric Connor Inspiration Award (UK) ||Horace Ove\n|-\n|Special Award ||Stephen Bourne\n|-\n|Rising Star||Sope Dirisu (Undercover, Black Mirror)\n|-\n|Achievement in Film Production ||Brotherhood by Noel Clarke\n|-\n|Female Performance in Film ||Ruth Negga for Loving\n|-\n|Male Performance in Film ||Arinze Kene (The Pass)\n|-\n|Favourite International Movie ||\n|-\n|Favourite African UK Movie||Oxford Gardens by Obi Emelonye\n|-\n|Favourite Film||\n|-\n|Favourite Male Screen Personality ||\n|-\n|Favourite Female Screen Personality ||\n|-\n|Independent Spirit Film Production ||A Moving Image by Shola Amoo\n|-\n|Male Performance in TV ||Malachi Kirby (Roots)\n|-\n|Female Performance in TV ||Judith Shekoni (Ice, Ordinary Lies and Heroes Reborn)\n|-\n|Favourite Male TV Personality ||Ore Oduba (Strictly Come Dancing)\n|-\n|Favourite Female TV Personality || Sandra Martin and Sandi Bogle (Gogglebox)\n|-\n|Emerging Talent ||Damson Idris (City of Tiny Lights, Snowfall and Casualty)\n|-\n|Diversity in Drama Production ||Damilola, Our Loved Boy (BBC1)\n|-\n|Diversity in Factual Production ||Black is the New Black (BBC2)\n|-\n|Favourite Grime Music Promo||\n|-\n|Favourite Comedy Production||\n|-\n|Favourite Black Broadcaster|| ABN TV\n|-\n| Favourite Reality TV Talent || Selasi Gbormittah (The Great British Bake Off)\n|}-->\n2016 winners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n! width=\"45%\" |Award\n! width=\"55%\" |Winner\n|-\n|Outstanding Contribution to Film and TV Award (Int) ||Wesley Snipes\n|-\n|Edric Connor Inspiration Award (UK) ||Carmen Munroe\n|-\n|Rising Star|| Malachi Kirby (Jekyll & Hyde, Dough)\n|-\n|Achievement in Film Production ||The Hard Stop\n|-\n|Female Performance in Film ||Nathalie Emmanuel (Fast & Furious 7)\n|-\n|Male Performance in Film ||John Boyega (Star Wars: Episode VII)\n|-\n|Favourite International Movie ||Beasts of No Nation – Idris Elba, Ama K.
