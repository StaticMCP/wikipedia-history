It is directed by Krish Jagarlamudi and Kangana Ranaut from a screenplay written by V. Vijayendra Prasad. Produced by Zee Studios, the film stars Ranaut in the title role.\nManikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi was released on 3700 screens in 50 countries worldwide on 25 January 2019. The film performed moderately well internationally and in India in its theatrical run. The film holds the record for highest opening weekend collections for a female-driven film in India. The film also became the highest Indian opener in Japan in January 2020. It is one of the highest grossing women-centric films in India.\nThe film opened to positive critical response. It was selected for the Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival. Ranaut's portrayal of Rani Lakshmi Bai garnered widespread critical acclaim winning her the National Film Award for Best Actress at the 67th National Film Awards.\nPlot\nIn 1828, Manikarnika is born in the ghats of Varanasi. She is raised by her father, Moropanth, and Peshwa Bajirao II in Bithoor. She is a favourite of the Peshwa and he has brought her up with a lot of love. One day Dixit Ji of Jhansi spots her facing a ferocious tiger fearlessly. Impressed, he asks Peshwa for her hand in marriage with Maharaja of the Maratha-ruled princely state of Jhansi, Gangadhar Rao. Dixit Ji is aware that the British are eyeing Jhansi and want to annexe the kingdom. He realises that her brave persona would play a crucial role in giving a tough fight to the British. The marriage takes place and as per the tradition, the king gives her a new name – ‘Laxmibai’ (or Lakshmi Bai). All these developments upset Gangadhar's brother Sadashiv Rao. He is friendly with the British and wants to usurp the throne.\nLaxmibai, after a few years, gives birth to Damodar and she is unable to contain her happiness. Her joy, however, is short-lived as Sadashiv surreptitiously poisons Damodar. Gangadhar, at the same time, falls ill too. Knowing that his death is near, he and Laxmibai decide to adopt a son who will rule Jhansi in the future. Much to Sadashiv's dismay, his son is not adopted, and instead, ‘Anand Rao’, the son of a courtier, is named the heir. He was renamed as Laxmibai instinctively calls him Damodar Rao. Gangadhar passes away, and the British attempt to annexe the throne. However, Laxmibai surprises everyone as she decides to take over the reins. She proclaims herself as the queen of Jhansi and challenges the British openly. When the British force her to vacate the palace, she walks gracefully into the village and is welcomed and greeted by a massive parade of villagers led by Jhalkaribai. She continues to live among the civilians quietly strategising to reclaim the throne.\nThe rebellions from the Indian Rebellion of 1857 reach Jhansi where the revolutionaries led by Sangram Singh kill General Gordon and his officers. They further attempt to kill their children and wives but their attempts are thwarted by Laxmibai. She plans to conquer the throne of Jhansi back while Sangram Singh and his men join the rebellion in Delhi. The East India Company requests the British government to appoint Sir Hugh Rose to salvage the situation and remove Laxmibai from the throne permanently.\nKnowing very well that she will soon be attacked again, Laxmibai begins training her own army, especially women, to fight. Laxmibai assembles an army of 20,000 troops, and Pathans join her later in 1858. During the siege of Jhansi, Laxmibai valiantly steps onto the battlefield to destroy the British cannons strategically placed in front of a temple. The strong fort walls keep Laxmibai and her army steady until Sadashiv Rao divulges secrets about the fort to the British, who finally break the siege and manage to storm the keep, resulting in the death of ‘Gaus-Baba’. Jhalkaribai, despite discovering that she is pregnant, acts as a decoy pretending to be the queen due to her striking resemblance to Laxmibai. She manages to distract the British army so that Laxmibai and Damodar can escape the castle safely. Jhalkaribai sacrifices herself in a major gunpowder explosion, killing numerous British officers along with her.\nLaxmibai escapes to Kalpi to reunite with Tatya Tope and other allies. She captures the princely state of Gwalior and motivates the troops to participate in the war. With a heavy heart, Laxmibai leaves Damodar and leads an attack on the British. Laxmibai bravely sets out to attack the huge British army even though she faces a certain defeat. Laxmibai gets shot by one of the British soldiers, and while taking her last breath she looks at Hugh Rose and immolates herself in a fire to avoid being captured and humiliated by the British. After Laxmibai's death, Jhansi is surrendered to the British Government in 1860 on behalf of Damodar Rao. Damodar Rao survives but lives a life suffering from prolonged illness and dire poverty, dying at the age of 58 in 1903. General Hugh Rose wrote about Rani Laxmibai's bravery and courage in his autobiography that \"She was the most dangerous of all rebel leaders, best and bravest of all, the only man among mutineers\".\nCast\n* Kangana Ranaut as Rani Lakshmi Bai (Manikarnika \"Manu\")\n* Jisshu Sengupta as Gangadhar Rao, Laxmibai's husband\n* Atul Kulkarni as Tatya Tope\n* Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub as Sadashiv Rao, Lakshmibai's brother-in-law\n* Danny Denzongpa as Ghulam Ghaus Khan\n* Richard Keep as General Hugh Rose\n* Suresh Oberoi as Bajirao II\n* Anil George as Pir Ali\n* Edward Sonnenblick as Captain Gordon\n* Vaibhav Tatwawaadi as Puran Singh\n* Ankita Lokhande as Jhalkari Bai\n* Yash Tonk as Rao Tula Ram\n* R.

Calling Ranaut's performance in the film \"fiery\" she wrote, \"Ranaut is on fire as the iconic Rani Lakshmi Bai. Her spine is erect, her eyes are unblinking and she seems propelled by some other-worldly power. She’s riding horses, wielding swords, leaping on elephants, and making it all look plausible. When she looks into the camera and insists on dying for the country, you want to follow her into battle\". Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film a rating of 3/5 and wrote, \"This is a deliberately simplistic film; an old-fashioned patriotic saga told in the broadest of strokes, and with full nationalist fervor\". Praising Ranaut's performance he further wrote, \"Ranaut’s extraordinary performance is the film’s biggest strength. She is unwavering in her portrayal of Rani Lakshmibai; There’s a hard-to-miss intensity in her eyes, and tenacity in her voice. She commands the screen with a fiery, arresting presence, never letting your attention wander away from her\". Namrata Joshi of The Hindu wrote, \"Ranaut doesn’t just share the director’s credit; she overshadows all of the cast, including veterans like Danny Denzongpa and consummate performers like Atul Kulkarni and Mohammad Zeeshan Ayub. It’s evident that Ranaut has put her all into the film and she's present in practically every frame\".

We know what this actress is capable of, and she gives even the weaker written parts of this film her all\".\nShibaji Roychoudhury of Times Now gave the film a rating of 4/5 and wrote, \"Manikarnika has many moments of genius and enough fire to keep you glued to the screen. Ranaut's performance as the iconic Rani of Jhansi is worth every penny spent\".

Her nuanced grasp of the rebel warrior-queen will certainly win you over\". Meena Iyer of DNA gave the film a rating of 4/5 and wrote, \"Ranaut, who wears two hats that of the protagonist and the co-director displays a certain maturity on both counts. As a queen, she displays steely resolve, managing to infuse life into her Laxmibai; As a director, she shares credit with Krish and has assuredly contributed to this big-ticket outing\". A. Ganesh Nadar of Rediff gave the film a rating of 4/5 and wrote, \"The film is as grand as the Baahubali films. Unsurprisingly, as both films have been written by the same writer, K. V. Vijayendra Prasad\". Bollywood Hungama gave the film a rating of 3.5/5 and wrote, \"Manikarnika is a well-made historical with the right scale, emotional quotient and battle sequences as its highpoint. Also, Kangana Ranaut's performance is the icing on the cake\". Praising Ranaut's performance they further wrote, \"Ranaut delivers a terrific performance and owns this challenging character.

For a first-time filmmaker, she undoubtedly shows spark and potential as a storyteller. Short of an epic, this larger-than-life war drama has enough valour and spirit to keep you engaged in these pages of history.\" Praising Ranaut's performance, he further wrote, \"Ranaut captivates your attention in every frame and grows from strength to strength as the film progresses.

Devesh Sharma of Filmfare gave the film a rating of 3.5/5 and wrote, \"Manikarnika manages to reintroduce one of the most awe-inspiring figures from India's past. A legend gets reborn, at least on screen, and maybe that's the only reality palatable to us right now\".

Praising Ranaut's performance she further wrote, \"Ranaut is undoubtedly magnificent as the titular character. She brings a righteous anger and otherworldly fury to the character. Ranaut plays The Rani of Jhansi with such conviction that one does not even pay attention to the weak script that makes her force-feed the audience with long expositions drowning is patriotic fervour\". Mayank Shekhar of Mid-Day gave the film a rating of 3/5 and wrote, \"Manikarnika is a big-budget, wholly star-driven, action-packed, period picture. Except the star is female, which is rare enough\". Praising Ranaut further he wrote, \"I can't imagine anybody as naturally earning that sobriquet as Ranaut. Dainty but fierce, Ranaut plays Rani Lakshmibai with the ferocity that suits her character best. She leads the charge not just as an actor, but also as director\".

Ranaut appears in top form and even proves she can hang as a director\". Praising Ranaut's performance he further wrote, \"Manikarnika is a one-woman-show. Ranaut, in an avatar never seen before, displays a determination, fury and softness in her composure, body language, movement and expressions to bring the iconic rebel to life\". Shilpa Jamkhandikar of Reuters wrote, \"Ranaut does her best. She is awkward and stilted as the demure bride but comes into her own as the warrior queen. She adds a swagger to her stride and a steely determination to her demeanour that are hard not to cheer for. She is the only thing that make this film worth a watch\". Ankur Pathak of HuffPost wrote, \"Ranaut plays the titular role of Rani Laxmibai with conviction and brings a sense of ferocious energy to her character.
