It had approximately 800 pupils, ages 11–16. The school was where a large portion of the motion picture Kes was filmed in 1969.\nThe school site was previously occupied by St Helens Comprehensive School, until being amalgamated with Edward Sheerien School in 1992. St Helen's opened on 22 November 1963 to cater for children from the Athersley South and Monk Bretton area of Barnsley. The original Edward Sheerien School was located on Newstead Road Athersley North.\nEdward Sheerien School closed in September 2009, merging with Royston High School to establish Carlton Community College. The school went on to relocate to a new site in 2011, and in 2016 became Outwood Academy Carlton.\nThe site of the school was demolished in early 2011.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311022006/http://www.dfes.gov.uk/cgi-bin/performancetables/dfe1x1_04.pl?Mode=Z&Code=&School=3704001&Type=&back=&No=370 Department for Education and Schools: Edward Sheerien School]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070312173138/http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/reports/index.cfm?fuseaction=summary&id=106645 Ofsted report: Edward Sheerien School]\n*"
