It is the sequel to the 2001 game Kingdom Under Fire: A War of Heroes, and continues its storyline. Kingdom Under Fire: The Crusaders combines third-person action and role-playing elements in its gameplay, which differs from its predecessor.\nIts prequel is Kingdom Under Fire: Heroes. Another sequel was released in late 2019 entitled Kingdom Under Fire II for Windows.\nA Windows port was released for Steam in February 2020, and resurrected by the co-developer of the original Xbox version, Blueside. A DRM-free version was released on GOG.com in early April 2020. The modern Windows release came with several enhancements including full controller support, plus an all-new mouse & keyboard mode (Though, a gamepad is recommended); modern resolutions and widescreen view.\nGameplay\nThe gameplay of Kingdom Under Fire: The Crusaders contains elements from the Dynasty Warriors games and aspects of Real-time strategy and role-playing games. As well as controlling the main character, the player fights with multiple armies or \"units\", which are controlled in real-time with either a minimap or the main screen. When the main character's unit engages in combat with an enemy unit, the gameplay is similar to Dynasty Warriors.\nAny unit in close-quarters combat cannot be used for anything else until the combat is resolved; an exception to this is when two units are in close-quarter combat with the enemy: one unit can retreat while the other keeps the enemy unit occupied.\nReception\n(PC) 60/100\n| Edge = 7/10\n| EGM = 7.83/10s review of the Xbox version, one critic gave it 7.5/10, and the rest gave it each a score of 8/10.}}\n| Fam = 29/40\n| GI = 7.75/10\n| GSpot = 8.5/10\n| GSpy =\n| GameZone = 8.5/10\n| IGN = 8.2/10\n| OXM = 8.4/10\n| XPlay =\n| rev1 = Detroit Free Press\n| rev1Score =\n| rev2 = The Digital Fix\n| rev2Score = (PC) 5/10\n}}\nThe Xbox version received \"favorable\" reviews, while the PC version received \"mixed\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.
