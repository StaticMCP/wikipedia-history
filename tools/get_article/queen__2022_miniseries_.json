Although Cierplikowski himself was not a drag queen, he was a gay man who had moved from Poland to Paris, became an extremely successful hairdresser, and returned to Poland at the end of his life. Ásgeirsson died in April 2021 before the series had finished production; the series is dedicated to his memory.\nThe series was filmed in Wrocław and Nowa Ruda in 2021. Exterior shots of a clothing factory in Gryfów Śląski are also featured in the series.\nReception\nReviewing the series' pilot episode, Joel Keller of Decider wrote that \"Queen is a gentle but powerful drama about a man who thought he was sure of who he is discovering things about himself at a late age, and being the better for it.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.netflix.com/watch/81387430 Queen] on Netflix\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt28658091/ Queen] on IMDb"
