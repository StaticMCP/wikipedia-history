It first gained notoriety in 1973 when they, along with American Indian Movement activists, held a standoff with the Quebec Provincial Police at Kahnawake, and another in Kanehsatake in 1990. The members of this society are known as Warriors.\nFlag\nThe Mohawk Warrior Flag was designed by Karoniaktajeh Louis Hall in 1974. Hall was an artist, writer, and activist from Kahnawake. It was initially called the \"unity flag\" or \"Indian flag\", depicting an Indigenous man with long hair over top a yellow sunburst and red banner. This was changed in the 1980's with the man being replaced with a Kanien’kehá:ka (Mohawk) warrior. The flag was highlighted in the media during the Oka Crisis and became a symbol of resistance for Kanien’kehá:ka people.\nGallery\nFile:Native American flag at Beyond NoDAPL March on Washington, DC.jpg|Mohawk Warrior Society flag at Beyond NoDAPL March on Washington, DC.\nFile:Native American speaker with his father and a drum.jpg|NoDAPL March on Washington, DC.\nFile:Native American flags at Beyond NoDAPL March on Washington, DC.jpg|Brother of Leonard Peltier speaking at Standing Rock and Beyond NoDAPL March on Washington, DC.\nFile:Flags at Trump Hotel and Native American Flag.jpg|Beyond NoDAPL March on Washington, DC.\nReferences"
