Many have found themselves at the centre of animal rights protests against animal testing.\nCampaign methods have included leafleting, demonstrations, verbal and physical intimidation, false accusations of criminal activity such as paedophilia, destruction of property, arson, the use of explosive devices and a grave-robbing.\nMany smaller breeders have gone out of business, concentrating the market around larger international companies, such as Charles River Laboratories.\nAfter Shamrock Farm closed in 2000, there were no commercial importers of laboratory primates left in the UK. To address this shortage, Cambridge University planned to build Europe's largest primate facility. However, they withdrew their plans following a concerted campaign by animal rights activists.\nIn 2004, the trend has been for companies that experiment on animals to threaten to pull out of the UK.\nReferences"
