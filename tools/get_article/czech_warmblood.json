In 2021 the population was reported as about ; the conservation status of the breed was listed as 'not at risk'.\nTwo other warmblood breeds of the area were formerly assimilated into the Czech Warmblood population: the Moravian Warmblood or ; and the Kinsky Horse or , sometimes also known as the Golden Horse of Bohemia. Separate stud-books for these were established in 2004 and 2005 respectively.\nCharacteristics\nThe horses usually stand between  at the withers and weigh approximately . The most usual coat colours are bay and chestnut; black, grey and dun also occur.\nUse\nThe horses are used principally in show-jumping and in dressage; they are also suitable for recreational riding.\nReferences\n.
