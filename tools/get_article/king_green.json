He currently competes in the Lightweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). A professional since 2008, Green is the former King of the Cage Lightweight Champion and Junior Welterweight Champion, and in addition he has also competed in Tachi Palace Fights, Strikeforce, and Affliction.\nBackground\nGreen was born in San Bernardino, California, and became a foster child when he was five years old, as his father was incarcerated and mother was unable to take care of her children due to a drug addiction. Green began wrestling in his sophomore year at A.B. Miller High School in Fontana, California, placing twice in the state tournament. Green began pursuing a career in professional mixed martial arts while he was also working at a warehouse to help support his son.\nMixed martial arts career\nEarly career\nGreen made his professional mixed martial arts debut in January 2008, and quickly amassed an 8–1 record while fighting on independent events.\nGreen drew the attention of Affliction Entertainment and fought on their second (and final) card Day of Reckoning. He lost to Dan Lauzon via submission in the first round. Green was docked two points in the first round, in what Sherdog has called one of the dirtiest fights in recent memory.\nFollowing the loss, Green began a successful run in the King of the Cage promotion.  On February 25, 2010,  Green defeated Ricky Legere via first-round TKO to win the King of the Cage Junior Welterweight Championship at KOTC Arrival at the San Manuel Casino in Highland, California.  He eventually defended the title once before losing it to Tim Means. On April 21, Green defeated Dom O'Grady by unanimous decision to win the King of the Cage Lightweight Championship.\nStrikeforce\nOn July 14, 2011, it was announced that Green had signed a four-fight deal with Strikeforce.
