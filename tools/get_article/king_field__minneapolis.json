Its boundaries are 36th Street to the north, Interstate 35W to the east, 46th Street to the south, and Lyndale Avenue to the west. King Field, within the King Field neighborhood, is a park named after Martin Luther King Jr.\nKingfield is a part of Minneapolis City Council ward 8 and state legislative districts 62A and 62B.\nHistory\nKing Field is named after Colonel William S. King. The neighborhood is in Minneapolis's Southwest community between Interstate 35W on the east and Lyndale Avenue on the west. The northern boundary is 36th Street and the southern boundary is 46th Street.\nIn 1885, the southern border of the city of Minneapolis was 38th Street. By 1887 the city had expanded its borders to 54th street, and thus the area which is now King Field became part of Minneapolis. King Field is mainly a residential area, with three-fourths of its single-family houses built before 1920. The King Field neighborhood has a number of amenities, including churches, schools, a park named after Martin Luther King Jr., and three to four dozen small businesses.\nEarly history\nThe area was farm country in the second half of the 19th century. Transportation was by horse and buggy. Fewer than 20 farms had been established by 1874. C.C. Garvey owned a dairy farm near 44th Street and Grand Ave. George Bichnell farmed  of land from Lyndale to Pleasant, 42nd to 43rd Streets. Hiram Van Nest farmed  of land from 40th to 42nd, Pleasant to Lyndale. The Farmsworth farm occupied  south of 47th Street and East of Nicollet.\nThe area between Lake Street and 40th Street was largely built between 1903 and 1914 with Colonial Revival houses and Craftsman bungalows. After World War I, the area south of 40th Street and north of Minnehaha Creek was developed. The Church of the Incarnation opened in 1918 at the intersection of 38th Street and Pleasant Avenue. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2022 and is a city of Minneapolis historic district.\nStreet names\nThe following is a list of streets in King Field, and the origin of their names:\n* Blaisdell Ave. named in honor of Robert Blaisdell, Sr. and his three sons, who were early pioneers here and lumbermen on the upper Mississippi river\n* Garfield Ave. named after President James Garfield\n* Grand Ave. from the French, meaning \"great\" or \"noble\"\n* Harriet Ave. named after the wife of Colonel Leavenworth, whose maiden name was Harriet Lovejoy.
