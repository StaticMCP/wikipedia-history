It came in the final round of the season, against St Kilda at Subiaco, with King contributing two goals and 21 disposals to the win. Just like his West Perth teammate Paul Mifka who shared a debut with him that day, King was not picked again. At the Adelaide Bicentennial Carnival the following season, King represented the Australian Amateurs team.\nKing died from cancer on 9 April 2025, at the age of 60.\nReferences\nSources\n* Holmesby, Russell and Main, Jim (2007).
