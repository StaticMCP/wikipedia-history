His father was a butler at Hall Place in the village and had played cricket for the village side in the 1840s, and King also played club cricket for the village side as well as for Canterbury Citizens, where he played alongside his brother George, and St Lawrence.\nThe only first-class match King played in was a June 1871 fixture for Kent against Sussex at the Royal Brunswick Ground in Hove. In a one-sided match which Sussex won easily, he opened the batting and scored a total of 11 runs, with a highest score of six made in the second innings and did not take a wicket when he bowled. He is also known to have played one match for the amateur Gentlemen of Kent side earlier in the same year.\nKing married Mary Clinch at Lenham in 1875. He studied agriculture and ran a farm at Coldred during the 1880s before moving to live at Hernhill. He died at the West London Hospital in Hammersmith in 1893 aged 42.\nReferences\nExternal links"
