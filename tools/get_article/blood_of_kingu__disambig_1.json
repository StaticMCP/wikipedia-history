The vocals include death growls as well as Tibetan chants..\nOn 7 December 2007, they released their first album, De occulta philosophia. It was re-released with alternate layout and packaging.\nTheir second album, Sun in the House of the Scorpion, was recorded in the autumn of 2009 and released on 24 May 2010 by Candlelight Records.\nOn mid-2016, Blood of Kingu had announced on their Facebook page that the band has ended. After that, Roman Saenko has started another new Black metal band called \"Windswept\" which its debut album will be released in March 2017 with its first track \"Blinding and Bottomless abyss is howling\".
