He played college football for the Georgia Bulldogs and was selected by the New England Patriots in the first round of the 1998 NFL draft with the 18th overall pick. Edwards also played in the NFL for the Miami Dolphins before moving to the CFL with the Montreal Alouettes and ending his career with the Toronto Argonauts.\nHe is the older brother of retired Winnipeg Blue Bombers receiver Terrence Edwards.\nRobert currently serves as the head coach of the Washington County Golden Hawks in Sandersville, Georgia.\nCollege career\nEdwards was a featured running back at the University of Georgia. He was originally recruited to play cornerback, where he was a starter through his sophomore year. After that season, he was converted to running back. As a running back he set a Bulldog record for scoring five touchdowns in one game against the University of South Carolina.\nThroughout his college career, Edwards was injury-prone. He never finished a full season in college due to knee problems, and missed an entire year due to a broken hand which allowed him to earn an injury redshirt for that season.\nStatistics\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!|\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#e7e3e7;\"| Rushing\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#e7e3e7;\"| Receiving\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#e7e3e7;\"| Defense\n|-\n!|YEAR\n!|ATT\n!|YDS\n!|AVG\n!|LNG\n!|TD\n!|NO.\n!|YDS\n!|AVG\n!|LNG\n!|TD\n!|TCK\n!|SCKS\n!|PD\n!|INT\n|-\n|1993||0||0||0.0||0||0||0||0||0.0||0||0||—||—||—||0\n|-\n|1994||0||0||0.0||0||0||0||0||0.0||0||0||—||—||—||4\n|-\n|1995||45||325||7.2||65||6||2||42||21.0||45||1||—||—||—||—\n|-\n|1996||184||809||4.4||32||9||23||199||8.7||34||1||—||—||—||—\n|-\n|1997||165||1200||5.5||80||12||23||214||9.3||27||1||—||—||—||—\n|-\n!Totals!!394!!2334!!5.2!!80!!27!!48!!455!!9.5!!45!!3!!—!!—!!—!!4\n|}\nPlaying career\nNational Football League\nEdwards was chosen by the New England Patriots in the first round of the 1998 NFL draft. He rushed for 1,115 yards for the Patriots in the 1998 National Football League season, before blowing out his knee at an NFL rookie flag football game in Hawaii during Pro Bowl week. Edwards barely escaped the injury without having his leg amputated below the knee, and he was told he might not walk again.\nEdwards would not play football again until 2002, when he made his return with the Miami Dolphins. In his first game back, against the Detroit Lions, Edwards caught a touchdown pass and ran for another score. He spent the rest of the season sharing third-down back duties with fellow running back Travis Minor. After the season, he lost his spot on the roster to Leonard Henry. Edwards was awarded the Pro Football Writers Association Halas Award for his comeback from his serious injury. Edwards holds the record for consecutive games with a touchdown to start a career. He had one rushing touchdown in each of the first six games and an additional receiving touchdown in Game 5 against the Kansas City Chiefs in his 1998 rookie season with the Patriots.\nStatistics\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!|\n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:#e7e3e7;\"| Rushing\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#e7e3e7;\"| Receiving\n|-\n!|YEAR\n!|TEAM\n!|ATT\n!|YDS\n!|AVG\n!|LNG\n!|TD\n!|NO.\n!|YDS\n!|AVG\n!|LNG\n!|TD\n|-\n|1998||NE||291||1,115||3.8||53||9||35||331||9.5||46||3\n|-\n|2002||MIA||20||107||5.4||19||1||18||126||7.0||14||1\n|-\n!Totals!!—!!311!!1,222!!3.9!!53!!10!!53!!457!!8.6!!46!!4\n|}\nCanadian Football League\nEdwards joined the CFL's Montreal Alouettes in 2005, and was the team's leading rusher, running for over 1,000 yards each of the first two seasons he played in Montreal.
