He has also been active in the theory of proof-theoretic ordinals. He earned his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago in 1956 for his dissertation \"k-fold recursion and well-ordering\". He was a student of Saunders Mac Lane.\nThe Howard ordinal (also known as the Bachmann–Howard ordinal) was named after him.\nHe was the first to carry out an ordinal analysis of the intuitionistic theory \\mathbf{ID}^i_1(\\mathcal O) of inductive definitions.p.27\nHe was elected to the 2018 class of fellows of the American Mathematical Society.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=6461 Entry for William Alvin Howard] at the Mathematics Genealogy Project\n*"
