Leaving four of his fourteen vessels to maintain the watch over Livorno, van Galen took his remaining ten ships to intercept Badiley's squadron. The two encountered each other between Montecristo and Elba Islands. The Phoenix was captured by the Jaarsveld, while the other English warships retreated into Porto Longone. The captured ship, Phoenix, was recaptured 2 months later during a night raid at Livorno.\nShips involved:\nNetherlands\n*Jaarsveld 44 (Rear-Admiral Johan van Galen)\n*Prinses Roijaal 34 (Albert Corneliszoon 't Hoen; killed)\n*Wapen van Zeeland 32 (Joost Willemszoon Block; killed)\n*Eendracht 40 (Vice-Admiral Jacob de Boer)\n*Maan 40 (David Janszoon Bondt; killed)\n*Vereenigde Provinciën/Zeven Provinciën 40 (Hendrick Claeszoon Swart; killed)\n*Haarlem 40 (Dirck Quiinen Verveen)\n*Maagd van Enkhuysen 34 (Cornelis Tromp)\n*Zeelandia 32 (Andries de Boer)\n*Jonge Prins 28 (Cornelis Barentszoon Slordt)\nThe Jaarsveld and four other ships of the squadron belonged to the Amsterdam Admiralty, but the Prinses Roijaal, Eendracht and Jonge Prins belonged to the Noorderkwartier Admiralty, while Wapen van Zeeland and Zeelandia belonged to the Zeeland Admiralty.\nEngland\n*Paragon 42 (Admiral Richard Badiley)\n*Elizabeth 38 (Capt.
