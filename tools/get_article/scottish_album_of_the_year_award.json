The award was launched in 2012 by the [http://www.smia.org.uk Scottish Music Industry Association] (SMIA) in partnership with Creative Scotland. The winner receives a £20,000 prize and the nine shortlisted artists receive £1,000.\nThe award ceremony is set to be hosted in Dundee up until 2027.\nProcess\nOnce all eligible albums have been collated, 100 impartial 'Nominators', chosen from sectors including journalism, broadcast and radio, music retail and live music venues, will consider the titles from The SAY Award's Eligible Albums list, nominating their five favourite albums and ranking them in order of preference. 'Nominators' include specialists in a variety of genres, such as jazz, classical, electronic and traditional folk, as well as key influencers from elsewhere in the arts, and cannot have a commercial interest in any of the albums being discussed. The SMIA assigns a score to each title in a Nominator's Top 5, before announcing the 20 highest scoring albums as The SAY Award Longlist.\nThe Longlist is then whittled down to a Shortlist of 10 albums, one of which will be chosen by music fans via an online public vote and the others decided by the SAY Award judging panel. Previous judges have included the composer Craig Armstrong, Turner Prize-winning artists Douglas Gordon and Susan Philipsz, filmmaker Lynne Ramsay, music editor of The Skinny Tallah Brash, DJ and promoter Sarra Wild, Edinburgh International Festival director Fergus Linehan, Sub Club partner/director Barry Price, and Scottish Ballet's Sophie Laplane.\nThe SAY Award Shortlist is then honoured at an exclusive ceremony, with each title receiving an award created by The SAY Award Design Commission winner and a minimum of £1,000. The SAY Award judging panel reconvene for the ceremony and decide who picks up the £20,000 first prize and coveted title of Scottish Album of the Year.\nHost cities and venues\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Years\n! scope=\"col\" | Host city\n! scope=\"col\" | Venue\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2012–2015\n| Glasgow\n| |O2 ABC (2015)}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2016–2018\n| Paisley\n| Paisley Town Hall|Summerhall (2020)|Usher Hall (2021)}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2022–2024\n| Stirling\n| Albert Halls\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2025–2027\n| Dundee\n| Caird Hall\n|}\nWinners and finalists\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Winner\n! scope=\"col\" | Shortlist\n! scope=\"col\" | Longlist\n! scope=\"col\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2012\n| Bill Wells and Aidan Moffat – ''Everything's Getting Older ||\n* Conquering Animal Sound – Kammerspiel\n*Happy Particles – Under Sleeping Waves\n* King Creosote & Jon Hopkins – Diamond Mine\n* Mogwai – Hardcore Will Never Die, But You Will''\n* Mungo's Hi Fi – Forward Ever\n* Remember Remember – The Quickening\n* Rustie – Glass Swords\n* Tommy Smith – Karma\n* Twin Atlantic – Free\n|\n* 6th Borough Project – One Night in the Borough\n* Bwani Junction – Fully Cocked\n* Chris Stout – Brazilian Theory\n* Found – factorycraft\n* Fudge Fingas – Now About How\n* Jonny – Jonny\n* Muscles of Joy – Muscles of Joy\n* Richard Craig – Inward\n* Steve Mason & Dennis Bovell – Ghosts Outside\n* We Were Promised Jetpacks – In the Pit of the Stomach\n||\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2013\n| RM Hubbert – Thirteen Lost & Found ||\n* Admiral Fallow – Tree Bursts in Snow\n* Django Django – Django Django\n* Human Don't Be Angry – ''Human Don't Be Angry\n* Karine Polwart – Traces\n* Lau – Race the Loser\n* Meursault – Something for the Weakened\n* Paul Buchanan – Mid-Air\n* Stanley Odd – Reject\n* The Twilight Sad – No One Can Ever Know\n|\n* Auntie Flo – Future Rhythm Machine\n* Calvin Harris – 18 Months\n* Dam Mantle – Brothers Fowl\n* Duncan Chisholm – Affric\n* Emeli Sandé – Our Version of Events\n* Errors – Have Some Faith in Magic\n* Konrad Wiszniewski & Euan Stevenson – New Focus\n* Miaoux Miaoux – Light of the North\n* Paws – Cokefloat!\n* The Unwinding Hours – Afterlives\n||\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2014\n| Young Fathers – Tape Two ||\n* Biffy Clyro – Opposites\n* Boards of Canada – Tomorrow's Harvest\n* Chvrches – The Bones of What You Believe\n* Edwyn Collins – Understated\n* Hector Bizerk – Nobody Seen Nothing\n* RM Hubbert – Breaks & Bone\n* Steve Mason – Monkey Minds in the Devil's Time\n* Mogwai – Les Revenants\n* The Pastels – Slow Summits\n|\n* Adam Holmes – Heirs and Graces\n* Adam Stafford – Imaginary Walls Collapse\n* Camera Obscura – Desire Lines\n* Dunedin Consort – J.S.
