The family consisted of Paul (Bradford Dillman), a recovering alcoholic hoping for a fresh start as an English professor at the town's college, his long-suffering wife Nan (Mary Frann), their two daughters, Carey (Jones), who becomes involved with stablehand Billy (Zippi), and Lauren (Hamilton), an aspiring pianist who falls in love with her piano teacher, symphony conductor Jonathan Hadary (Michael Zaslow).\nNan is trying re-establish a connection with her cold and distant Aunt Louisa Beauchamp (Beatrice Straight), who had never approved of Paul and resents Nan's attempts to reclaim the family home. Willa (Dorothy Meyer) is Louisa's black housekeeper, and Jillian (Clark) was Carey and Lauren's crippled and disturbed cousin who is discovered by Carey hidden away in family's attic. Louisa's attempts to hide family secrets and the true story behind Jillian's accident were not revealed before the show was canceled, however it strongly resembled the storyline involving Angela and Emma Channing on the other Lorimar production Falcon Crest, which aired at the same time on CBS.\nCast and characters\n*Bradford Dillman as Paul Hollister\n*Mary Frann as Nan Hollister\n*Linda Hamilton as Lauren Hollister\n*Doran Clark as Jillian Beauchamp\n*Marilyn Jones as Carey Hollister\n*Daniel Zippi as Billy McCall\n*Dorothy Meyer as Willa Bristol\n*and Beatrice Straight as Louisa Beauchamp\nEpisodes\n|ShortSummary=\n|Viewers=17.1\n|LineColor=FFFF8F\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|Viewers=12.3\n|LineColor=FFFF8F\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|Viewers=12.9\n|LineColor=FFFF8F\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|Viewers=10.2\n|LineColor=FFFF8F\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|Viewers=13.5\n|LineColor=FFFF8F\n}}\n|OriginalAirDate=\n|ShortSummary=\n|Viewers=11.4\n|LineColor=FFFF8F\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|Viewers=13.4\n|LineColor=FFFF8F\n}}\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
