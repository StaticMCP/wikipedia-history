It is Florida's second-most populous county after Miami-Dade County and the 17th-most populous in the United States, with 1,944,375 residents as of the 2020 census. Its county seat and most populous city is Fort Lauderdale, which had a population of 182,760 as of 2020. The county is part of the South Florida region of the state.\nBroward County is one of the three counties that make up the Miami metropolitan area, which is home to 6.14 million people as of 2020. It is also one of the most ethnically diverse counties in the entire country. As of 2022, Broward County has a gross domestic product of $124.8 billion, the second-largest GDP of Florida's 67 counties and the 25th-largest for the nation's 3,033 counties.\nHistory\nNative people\nThe earliest evidence of Native American settlement in the Miami region came from about 12,000 years ago. The first inhabitants settled on the banks of the Miami River, with the main villages on the northern banks.\nThe inhabitants at the time of first European contact were the Tequesta people, who controlled much of southeastern Florida, including what is now Miami-Dade County, Broward County, and the southern part of Palm Beach County. The Tequesta Indians fished, hunted, and gathered the fruit and roots of plants for food, but did not practice any form of agriculture. They buried the small bones of the deceased with the rest of the body, and put the larger bones in a box for the village people to see. The Tequesta are credited with making the Miami Circle.\nFounding of Broward\nBroward County was founded on April 30, 1915. It was intended to be named Everglades County, but then-Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives Ion Farris amended the bill that established the county to name it in honor of Napoleon Bonaparte Broward, governor of Florida from 1905 to 1909.\nThroughout his term as governor, Broward championed Everglades drainage and was remembered for his campaign to turn the Everglades into \"useful land\". This opened up much of today's urban Broward County for development, first as agricultural land and later as residential. A year before Broward became governor, Dania became the first incorporated community of what is now Broward County, followed by Pompano in 1908, and Fort Lauderdale in 1911.\nIn 1915, Palm Beach and Dade counties contributed nearly equal portions of land to create Broward County.\nBroward County began a huge development boom after its incorporation, with the first \"tourist hotel\", in Fort Lauderdale, opening in 1919. A year later, developers began dredging wetlands in the county to create island communities.\nLand boom and rapid growth\nBy 1925, the boom was considered to have reached its peak, but the 1926 Miami hurricane caused economic depression in the county. The county saw another population and development boom post-World War II when the transformation from agricultural to urbanized residential area began.\nIn 1967, Coconut Creek was incorporated.\nThe effects of a national recession hit the county in 1974 and the population growth finally slowed. This is from a peak growth percentage change of 297.9% which saw the population of Broward grow from 83,933 as of 1950 to 333,946 in 1960. The population subsequently experienced an 85.7% population growth which brought the population to a total of 620,100 in 1970.\nRecent history\nThe structure of the Broward County government was signed into law in 1975 with the passage of the Broward County charter. In the same year, the Seminole Tribe of Florida incorporated as a governing entity and began organizing cigarette sales, bingo and land leases that would bring millions of dollars in annual revenue in later years. In 1976, Interstate 95 was completed through Broward County.\nOn January 19, 1977, snow fell in South Florida for the first time in recorded history. Snow was seen across all of South Florida as far south as Homestead and even on Miami Beach. Snow was officially reported by weather observers in West Palm Beach, LaBelle, Hollywood, and Royal Palm Ranger Station in southern Miami-Dade County.\nIn the year 1980, the US census reported over 1 million people living in Broward County.\nOn August 24, 1992, Hurricane Andrew passed through Broward County  County, causing $100 million in damage in the county and leaving many residents homeless.\nIn the year 2000, the US census reported a total population of 1,623,018. The town of South West Ranches was incorporated this year.\nOn March 1, 2005, West Park became Broward County's 31st municipality to be incorporated.\nOn October 24, 2005, Hurricane Wilma hit South Florida leaving the entire area damaged and causing almost universal power outages. Wilma was the most damaging storm in Broward County since Hurricane King in 1950. Broward experienced wind speeds between  which endured for about five hours.\nOn February 14, 2018, the city of Parkland became the scene of a deadly mass shooting perpetrated by a 19-year-old former student of Stoneman Douglas High School. The trial of the perpetrator of the shooting, Nikolas Cruz, was held at the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida in Broward County in 2022 with Judge Elizabeth Scherer presiding. Cruz was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.\nIn June 2020, following the George Floyd protests, some residents called for the county to be renamed due to Governor Broward's support for segregation and the Back-to-Africa movement.\nGeography\n|56.2|75|2.7\n|57.9|77.2|2.6\n|60.9|79.7|3.7\n|64.1|83.3|2.9\n|68.7|87|4.3\n|72.9|89.6|8.6\n|74|91.2|6.9\n|74.4|91.3|7.7\n|73.9|89.5|7.9\n|70.2|85.8|5.1\n|64.6|80.9|3.4\n|59.1|76.6|2.2\n|units = imperial\n|float = right\n|clear = both }}According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has an area of , of which  is land and  (8.5%) is water.\nBroward County has an average elevation of  above sea level. It is rather new geologically and at the eastern edge of the Florida Platform, a carbonate plateau created millions of years ago. Broward County is composed of Oolite limestone while western Broward is composed mostly of Bryozoa. Broward is among the last areas of Florida to be created and populated with fauna and flora, mostly in the Pleistocene.\nOf developable land in Broward County, approximately , the majority is built upon, as the urban area is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Everglades Wildlife Management Area to the west. Within developable land, Broward County has a population density of 3,740 per square mile (1,444 per square kilometer).\nBroward approved the construction of Osborne Reef, an artificial reef made of tires off the Fort Lauderdale beach, but it has proven to be an environmental disaster.\nAdjacent counties\n* Palm Beach County - north\n* Miami-Dade County - south\n* Collier County - west\n* Hendry County - northwest\nDemographics\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census\n1920–1970 1980 19902000 2010 2020 2022\n}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;

The Board of County Commissioners is the legislative branch of Broward County Government. The County Commission is composed of nine members elected by district. Commissioners must be a resident of the district where they seek election. Each year the Commission elects a mayor and vice mayor. The mayor's functions are primarily ceremonial; serving as presiding officer and as the county's official representative. The Commission appoints the County Administrator, County Attorney and County Auditor. The commission also appoints numerous advisory and regulatory boards.\nThe County Commission meets in formal session the first four Tuesdays of each month at 10:00&nbsp;a.m. in Room 422 of the Broward County Governmental Center. Over 507,000 cable subscribers in Broward County have access to Government-access television (GATV) coverage of Commission meetings, which are broadcast live beginning at 10:00&nbsp;a.m. each Tuesday, and rebroadcast at 5:30&nbsp;p.m. the following Friday. Meetings can also be viewed via webcasting at www.broward.org.\nThe Broward County Sheriff's Office (BSO) has 5,400 employees, and is the largest sheriff's department in Florida. The BSO was founded in 1915. Sheriff Gregory Tony has been the Sheriff heading the agency since 2019, when he replaced Sheriff Scott Israel, who had been Sheriff since 2013.\nPolitics\nOverview\nBroward County has been a Democratic stronghold since 1992, voting for the party's presidential nominee in every election since then. It is now considered one of the most reliably Democratic counties in the state, still generally voting for Democrats even in statewide landslide losses, in presidential and gubernatorial elections.\nIt gave greater than 60% support to the Democratic party nominee in every election since 1996 until 2024. In 2024, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris won below 60% of the vote in the county for the first time since 1992. It had also given Democrat Charlie Crist less than 60% of the vote in the 2022 Florida gubernatorial election.\nFrom 1948 to 1988, the county leaned Republican, voting for the Republican nominee in every election except 1976, even supporting Republican Barry Goldwater by a 56–44 margin while he lost the national election in a landslide.\nUnlike Miami-Dade County to the south, where many of the immigrants are Republican-leaning Cuban-Americans, Cubans comprise only a small proportion of the immigrant population in Broward County.

The airport is bounded by the cities Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood and Dania Beach,  southwest of downtown Fort Lauderdale and  north of Miami. The airport is near cruise line terminals at Port Everglades and is popular among tourists bound for the Caribbean. Since the late 1990s, FLL has become an intercontinental gateway, although Miami International Airport still handles most long-haul flights. FLL is ranked as the 19th busiest airport (in terms of passenger traffic) in the United States, as well as the nation's 14th busiest international air gateway and one of the world's 50 busiest airports. FLL is classified by the US Federal Aviation Administration as a \"major hub\" facility serving commercial air traffic. In 2017 the airport processed 32,511,053 passengers (11.3% more than 2016) including 7,183,275 international passengers (18.6% more than 2016).\n* North Perry Airport\n* Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport\n* Pompano Beach Airpark\n* Downtown Fort Lauderdale Heliport\nPublic transportation\n* Broward County Transit\n* Sun Trolley\nMajor expressways\nas it passes through Fort Lauderdale.

Municipalities were often reluctant to annex neighborhoods which were not projected to yield enough tax revenue to cover the costs of providing services to those neighborhoods. In 2001 the Broward County Legislative Delegation adopted a policy encouraging the annexation of all unincorporated areas in Broward County into municipalities by October 1, 2005. Formerly unincorporated neighborhoods that have been annexed into existing municipalities or combined to form new municipalities  include:\n{|\n|-\n|valign=top|\n* Bonnie Loch-Woodsetter North in Deerfield Beach.\n* Broadview-Pompano Park in North Lauderdale.\n* Broward Estates in Lauderhill.\n* Carver Ranches in West Park.\n* Chambers Estates in Dania Beach.\n* Chula Vista Isles in Fort Lauderdale.\n* Collier Manor-Cresthaven in Pompano Beach.\n* Country Estates in Southwest Ranches.\n* Crystal Lake in Deerfield Beach.\n* Edgewater in Dania Beach.\n* Estates of Fort Lauderdale in Dania Beach, and partially in Hollywood.\n* Godfrey Road in Parkland.\n|valign=top|\n* Golden Heights in Fort Lauderdale.\n* Green Meadow in Southwest Ranches.\n* Hacienda Village in Davie.\n* Ivanhoe Estates in Southwest Ranches.\n* Kendall Green in Pompano Beach.\n* Lake Forest in West Park.\n* Leisureville in Pompano Beach.\n* Loch Lomond in Pompano Beach.\n|valign=top|\n* Melrose Park in Fort Lauderdale.\n* Miami Gardens in West Park.\n* North Andrews Gardens in Oakland Park.\n* Oak Point in Hollywood.\n* Palm Aire in Fort Lauderdale.\n* Pine Island Ridge in Davie.\n* Pompano Beach Highlands in Pompano Beach.\n* Pompano Estates in Pompano Beach.\n* Ramblewood East in Coral Springs.\n|valign=top|\n* Ravenswood Estates in Dania Beach.\n* Riverland Village in Fort Lauderdale.\n* Rock Island in Fort Lauderdale.\n* Rolling Oaks in Southwest Ranches.\n* Royal Palm Ranches in Cooper City.\n* St. George in Lauderhill.\n* Sunshine Acres in Davie.\n* Sunshine Ranches in Southwest Ranches.\n* Tedder in Deerfield Beach.\n* Terra Mar in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, and partially in Pompano Beach.\n* Twin Lakes North of Prospect Road, in Fort Lauderdale.

Other areas in the developed part of the county that are not in municipalities include the Hollywood Seminole Indian Reservation, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, several landfills and resource recovery facilities, and other scattered small parcels with few or no residents.\nSee also\n* List of tallest buildings in Fort Lauderdale\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Broward County, Florida\n* List of counties in Florida\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nGovernment links / constitutional offices\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090611140906/http://www.broward.org/ Broward County Government / Board of County Commissioners]\n* [http://www.browardsoe.org Broward County Supervisor of Elections]\n* [http://www.bcpa.net Broward County Property Appraiser]\n* [http://www.sheriff.org Broward County Sheriff's Office]\nSpecial districts\n* [http://www.browardschools.com Broward County Public Schools]\n* [http://www.browardhealth.org/ Broward Health (formerly North Broward Hospital District)]\n* [http://www.mhs.net/ South Broward Hospital District](Memorial Healthcare System)\n* [https://browardsoilandwater.org/ Broward Soil and Water Conservation District]\n* [http://www.sfwmd.gov South Florida Water Management District]\nJudicial branch\n* [http://www.browardclerk.org/ Broward County Clerk of Courts]\n* [http://www.clerk-17th-flcourts.org/ClerkWebsite/welcome2.aspx Broward County Clerk of Courts Records]\n* [http://www.browarddefender.org/ Broward County Public Defender]\n* [http://sao17.state.fl.us/ Broward State Attorney's Office, 17th Judicial Circuit]\n* [http://www.17th.flcourts.org/ Circuit and County Court for the 17th Judicial Circuit of Florida]\nTourism links\n* [http://www.sunny.org Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention and Visitors Bureau]\n* [http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00072837 The Waterfront News] local newspaper for Broward County, Florida fully and openly available in the [http://ufdc.ufl.edu/FDNL1 Florida Digital Newspaper Library]\nOfficial sites\n* [http://www.browardalliance.org/ The Broward Alliance] (Broward County's official public/private partnership for economic development)"
