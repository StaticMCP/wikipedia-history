After breaching the walls of Zaragoza and sacking the city of Villamayor de Monjardín and other towns of Navarre, he set off to take the mountain pass castle at Cellorigo.\nBattle\nThe results of the second campaign were worse than the previous attempt.  After he was initially repulsed by the Cellorigo defenders, al-Mundhir attempted a second assault on the castle at Pancorbo and another at Castrojeriz.  Both attempts were complete failures.  Further, the attacks resulted in great loss of life for the Muslim side.  Humiliated, al-Mundhir sent an envoy to King Alfonso III of Asturias to sue for peace.\nBibliography\n*\n*"
