It was founded as a direct replacement to the Piccadilly Medal tournament. Except in the first two years the official name took the form \"[Sponsor's name] TPC\". It was played in either England or Scotland. Having started as one of the richest events on the tour, it had below average prize money in later years.\nWinners of the Tournament Players Championship included two major champions, Nick Faldo of England and Bernhard Langer of Germany.\nSince the demise of the Tournament Players Championship, the TPC moniker has also been applied to the Lawrence Batley International T.P.C. in 1986, the Portuguese Open TPC in 1989 and 1990, and the Deutsche Bank Open TPC of Europe in Germany from 1995 to 2007. \"Tournament Players Championship\" was also the original name of the PGA Tour's Players Championship, which is the richest event on that tour\nWinners\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!Year !!
