''Burke's Peerage'' of 1850 and thereafter indicates that her birth name was Elizabeth Margaret Ward.|group=lower-alpha}}\nShe was an Austrian baroness who was the daughter of Baron Thomas Ward and his wife Louise Genthner, a Viennese commoner whom Thomas Ward had married in 1832.\nCareer\nAfter her marriage to a French marquis in 1868, Ward became an accomplished and successful painter in Paris, studying with Pierre Auguste Cot. She signed her paintings \"Louise Dubréau\", sometimes rendered \"Louise Dubreau\" or \"Louise du Bréau\", after her husband d'Hervey's estate Château du Bréau near Dourdan in Seine-et-Oise in the department of Yvelines.\nTwo of her best-known paintings are The Old Lodger (1877), which was exhibited at the Salon de 1877 and auctioned at Christie's in 2008; and Printemps (1882), which was exhibited at the Salon de 1882.\nPersonal life\nIn 1868, at the age of 18, she married French sinologist Marie-Jean-Léon, Marquis d'Hervey de Saint Denys. Her title became Marquise d'Hervey de Saint-Denys. The couple lived in Paris in their mansion at 9 Avenue Bosquet.\nIn Paris, Ward became a society belle (mondaine), and was known as a great beauty. Marcel Proust based at least one princess on her in his multi-volume novel series In Search of Lost Time.\nHer first husband, Hervey de Saint Denys, died in 1892. In 1896, Ward remarried, to French aristocrat and Olympic equestrian Jacques de Waru (1865–1911).\nWard died in February 1930, at the age of 80.\nNotable works\n*Ne dine jamais en ville [Never dine out] (known in English as The Old Lodger) (1877)\n*Chanteuse des rues [Street Singer] (1878)\n*''Jeanne d'Arc (1879)\n*Marchand de marrons [Chestnut Seller] (1880)\n*Printemps (1882)\nGallery\nFile:Louise Dubreau (Ward) - Ne dine jamais en ville (The Old Lodger).jpg|Ne dine jamais en ville [Never dine out], known in English as The Old Lodger (1877)\nFile:Louise Dubreau (Louise Ward) - Printemps, 1882.jpg|Printemps'' (1882)\nNotes\nReferences"
