The town consists of the two centres of Grebenhagen and Schwarzenborn.\nPolitics\nCoat of arms\nSchwarzenborn's civic coat of arms might be heraldically described thus: Argent a goat-headed spreadeagle sable langued gules, surmounted by an inescutcheon sable a mullet of six Or.\nSchwarzenborn's arms bear a likeness to both Neukirchen's and Schwalmstadt's. All three have the goat-headed spreadeagle and a star on the inescutcheon (small shield within the bigger one), but colouring varies among the three.\nTown partnerships\n*  Saint-Gervais-sur-Roubion, France since 7 May 2005\nEconomy and infrastructure\nThe town is well known for being a Bundeswehr base with a large training area, furnishing some 300 jobs to local civilians, making the Bundeswehr the town's biggest employer.
