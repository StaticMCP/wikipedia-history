He was replaced by Abdolrahim Mousavi.\nList of chiefs\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\" align=\"center\"| Chief of the Headquarters of the General Command of Forces\nyears\n| defence_branch    = none\n| acting            = y\n| ref               = –\n}}\nyears\n| defence_branch    = none\n| ref               = –\n}}\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\" align=\"center\"| Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces\n| defence_branch    = Basij\n| ref               =\n}}\n| died_year         = 2025\n| died              = y\n| term_start        = 28 June 2016\n| term_end          = 13 June 2025\n| timeinoffice      =\n| defence_branch    = IRGC\n| ref               =\n}}\n| defence_branch    = NEDAJA\n| acting            = y\n| ref               =\n}}\n| defence_branch    = NEZAJA\n| ref               =\n}}\nTimeline\nColors =\nid:iriaf value:Brightblue legend:Islamic_Republic_of_Iran_Armed_Forces\nid:gray1  value:gray(0.85)\nid:gray2  value:gray(0.95)\nDateFormat = yyyy\nPeriod     = from:1988 till:$now\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:5 start:1990\nScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:1988\nLegend     = columns:1 left:150 top:35 columnwidth:170\nTextData =\npos:(20,38) textcolor:black fontsize:M\ntext:\"Affiliation:\"\nBarData =\nbar:Rafsanjani\nbar:MHMousavi\nbar:Firouzabadi\nbar:Bagheri\nbar:Sayyari\nbar:AMousavi\nPlotData =\nwidth:5 align:left fontsize:9 shift:(5,-4) anchor:till\nbar: Rafsanjani\nfrom: 1988 till: 1988 color:iriaf text:\"Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (acting)\"\nbar: MHMousavi\nfrom: 1988 till: 1989 color:iriaf text:\"Mir-Hossein Mousavi\"\nbar: Firouzabadi\nfrom: 1989 till: 2016 color:iriaf text:\"Hassan Firouzabadi\"\nbar: Bagheri\nfrom: 2016 till: 2025 color:iriaf text:\"Mohammad Bagheri\"\nbar: Sayyari\nfrom: 2025 till: 2025 color:iriaf text:\"Habibollah Sayyari (acting)\"\nbar: AMousavi\nfrom: 2025 till: $now color:iriaf text:\"Abdolrahim Mousavi\"\n}}\nList of deputy chiefs\nyears\n| defence_branch    = Basij\n| alt_officeholder  = Mir-Hossein Mousavi\n| ref               = –\n}}\n| defence_branch    = IRGC\n| alt_officeholder  = Hassan Firouzabadi\n| ref               = –\n}}\n| defence_branch    = NEZAJA\n| alt_officeholder  = Hassan Firouzabadi\n| ref               = –\n}}\n| defence_branch    = IRGC\n| alt_officeholder  = Hassan Firouzabadi\n| ref               = –\n}}\n| defence_branch    = NEZAJA\n| alt_officeholder  = Mohammad Bagheri\n| ref               =\n}}\n| defence_branch    = NEZAJA\n| alt_officeholder  = Mohammad Bagheri\n| ref               =\n}}\n| died_year         =\n| term_start        = 2 July 2019\n| term_end          = 19 September 2021\n| timeinoffice      =\n| defence_branch    = NEZAJA\n| alt_officeholder  = Mohammad Bagheri\n| ref               =\n}}\n| defence_branch    = NAHAJA\n| alt_officeholder  = Mohammad Bagheri\n| ref               =\n}}\n| died_year         =\n| term_start        = 28 August 2024\n| timeinoffice      =\n| defence_branch    = NEZAJA\n| alt_officeholder  = Mohammad Bagheri\n| alt_officeholder2 = Abdolrahim Mousavi\n| ref               =\n}}\nTimeline\nColors =\nid:iriaf value:Brightblue legend:Islamic_Republic_of_Iran_Armed_Forces\nid:gray1  value:gray(0.85)\nid:gray2  value:gray(0.95)\nDateFormat = yyyy\nPeriod     = from:1988 till:$now\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:5 start:1990\nScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:1988\nLegend     = columns:1 left:150 top:35 columnwidth:170\nTextData =\npos:(20,38) textcolor:black fontsize:M\ntext:\"Affiliation:\"\nBarData =\nbar:Firouzabadi\nbar:Forouzandeh\nbar:Shirazi\nbar:Rashid\nbar:Mousavi\nbar:Salehi\nbar:Ashtiani\nbar:Nasirzadeh\nPlotData =\nwidth:5 align:left fontsize:9 shift:(5,-4) anchor:till\nbar: Firouzabadi\nfrom: 1988 till: 1989 color:iriaf text:\"Hassan Firouzabadi\"\nbar: Forouzandeh\nfrom: 1989 till: 1993 color:iriaf text:\"Mohammad Forouzandeh\"\nbar: Shirazi\nfrom: 1993 till: 1999 color:iriaf text:\"Ali Sayad Shirazi\"\nbar: Rashid\nfrom: 1999 till: 2016 color:iriaf text:\"Gholam Ali Rashid\"\nbar: Mousavi\nfrom: 2016 till: 2017 color:iriaf text:\"Abdolrahim Mousavi\"\nbar: Salehi\nfrom: 2017 till: 2019 color:iriaf text:\"Ataollah Salehi\"\nbar: Ashtiani\nfrom: 2019 till: 2021 color:iriaf\nfrom: 2024 till: $now color:iriaf text:\"Mohammad-Reza Gharaei Ashtiani\"\nbar: Nasirzadeh\nfrom: 2021 till: 2024 color:iriaf text:\"Aziz Nasirzadeh\"\n}}\nSee also\n* Joint Staff of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\n* Joint Staff of the Islamic Republic of Iran Army\nReferences"
