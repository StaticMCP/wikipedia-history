In the 1870s Brigham Young was encouraging communal living in United Order communities. The King families' United Order functioned from 1876 to 1883. Kingston became an incorporated town in 1935.\nThe members of the United Order\nbuilt the village of Kingston on ten acres of land east of Circleville.\n\"The town consisted of a central\ncommunity building for school, dances, church and\nother meetings.

Homes built in like style formed a fort around a ten-acre block. These\nfirst log houses had dirt floors and\nroofs. A communal kitchen and dining hall about seventy feet long stood in the center, with a large vegetable garden\nclose by.\"\nJust east of\nKingston the community had their industrial center in which buildings such as a\nflour mill, tannery, sawmill, and woolen mill were located.
