He received his BA Honours in History from the University of Winnipeg (1979), his MA in Canadian Art History from Concordia University, Montreal (1985), and his PhD in the History of Art from University College at the University of London (1991). From 1982, he taught art history in Montreal including in the Department of Art History at Concordia University (1988-2009; Full Professor from 2004), where he was also Associate Dean in the Faculty of Fine Arts (2002-2006, 2007-2009). In 2009 he became Professor of Art History, and Director of the School for Studies in Art and Culture (2009-2021), at Carleton University. From 2014 to 2015, he was the Craig Dobbin Visiting Professor of Canadian Studies, University College Dublin, Ireland. In addition to teaching, he has supervised M.A. and Ph.D. theses in the area of Canadian art history as well as commenting on radio on Canadian art.\nWriting\nFoss organized, co-organized or contributed essays to exhibitions on the art of Robert Harris (1991), Molly Lamb Bobak (1993), Miller Brittain (1998), Mary Hiester Reid (2000), and Edwin Holgate (2005), and has curated exhibitions on a broad range of subjects from the growth of the modern city to the development of art collections. He was the co-editor of The Visual Arts in Canada: The Twentieth Century (Oxford University Press, 2010) for which he also wrote the chapter on \"Into the New Century: Painting, 1890-1914\", and is author of the e-book Homer Watson: Life and Work (Art Canada Institute, 2018). With Jacques Des Rochers of the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Montréal he co-organized the monumental exhibition 1920s Modernism in Montreal: The Beaver Hall Group (2015), which took its curators ten years to put together, and which the Globe and Mail said dispelled the mythology surrounding the group and placed the artists in their proper context. He also wrote for the Beaver Hall exhibition catalogue the chapter on \"Out on the Town: Modernism, Arts and Entertainment in Montreal, 1920-1933\" and was featured in the CBC 1 documentary on the show.\nHis book War Paint: Art, War, State and Identity in Britain 1939-45 was published by Yale University Press (2007) and was one of the five books shortlisted for that year’s international William M.B.
