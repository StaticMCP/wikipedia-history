In 1934 it became the Secretariat for Press and Propaganda. It became a ministry in 1935 and was given its definitive designation in 1937. During its existence, it controlled most of the literary and radio channels in Italy. It was the Italian analogue of the German Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda.\nThe Ministry financed various Fascist publications, including La Difesa della Razza. It famously outlawed the importation and translation of all American comic books, with the lone exception of Mickey Mouse, in 1938.\nThe Ministry was officially suppressed by the Kingdom of Italy on 3 July 1944, having remained vacant ever since the overthrow of Benito Mussolini in the 25 Luglio coup a year earlier. During the Italian Social Republic, Mussolini revived the Ministry of Popular Culture and appointed Ferdinando Mezzasoma as its head.\nList of ministers\nKingdom of Italy\n;Parties\n*|National Fascist Party|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n;Coalitions\n*\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; style=\"width=95%\"\n|-\n! width=1% rowspan=2| Portrait\n! width=15% rowspan=2| Name(Born–Died)\n! width=30% colspan=3| Term of office\n! width=15% rowspan=2 colspan=2| Party\n! width=10% rowspan=2| Government\n! width=1% rowspan=2|\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! width=11%|Took office\n! width=11%|Left office\n! width=8%|Time in office\n|-\n! colspan=9| Minister of Press and Propaganda\n|-\n!\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight:normal\" |Galeazzo Ciano\n|23 June 1935\n|11 June 1936\n| }}\n! style=\"background:\" width=1%|\n|National Fascist Party\n|rowspan=2 bgcolor=#CFD5DA|Mussolini\n|\n|-\n!\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight:normal\" |Dino Alfieri\n|11 June 1936\n|27 May 1937\n| }}\n! style=\"background:\" width=1%|\n|National Fascist Party\n|\n|-\n! colspan=9| Minister of Popular Culture\n|-\n!\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight:normal\" |Dino Alfieri\n|27 May 1937\n|31 October 1939\n| }}\n! style=\"background:\" width=1%|\n|National Fascist Party\n|rowspan=3 bgcolor=#CFD5DA|Mussolini\n|\n|-\n!\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight:normal\" |Alessandro Pavolini\n|31 October 1939\n|6 February 1943\n| }}\n! style=\"background:\" width=1%|\n|National Fascist Party\n|\n|-\n!\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight:normal\" |Gaetano Polverelli\n|6 February 1943\n|25 July 1943\n| }}\n! style=\"background:\" width=1%|\n|National Fascist Party\n|\n|}\nItalian Social Republic\n;Parties\n*|Republican Fascist Party|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n;Coalitions\n*\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; style=\"width=95%\"\n|-\n! width=1% rowspan=2| Portrait\n! width=15% rowspan=2| Name(Born–Died)\n! width=30% colspan=3| Term of office\n! width=15% rowspan=2 colspan=2| Party\n! width=10% rowspan=2| Government\n! width=1% rowspan=2|\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! width=11%|Took office\n! width=11%|Left office\n! width=8%|Time in office\n|-\n! colspan=9| Minister of Popular Culture\n|-\n!\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight:normal\" |Ferdinando Mezzasoma\n|23 September 1943\n|25 April 1945\n| }}\n! style=\"background:\" width=1%|\n|Republican Fascist Party\n|bgcolor=#CFD5DA|Mussolini\n|\n|}\nSee also\n* Propaganda of Fascist Italy\n* Censorship in Italy\n* Reichs Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*"
