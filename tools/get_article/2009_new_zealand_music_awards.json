Finalists for the three technical awards were announced on 6 August 2009, with winners announced on 2 September at the Langham Hotel. Finalists for 14 'non-technical' categories were also revealed the same night. Five 'non-technical' awards were presented without a group of finalists being selected. The awards ceremony took place on 8 October 2009 at Vector Arena, Auckland. Broadcast live on television by C4, the ceremony was hosted by comedian Dai Henwood.\nLadyhawke won six awards, including Album and Single of the Year. This was the most awards won at a ceremony since 2004, when Scribe also won six. The People's Choice Award was won by Smashproof, who also claimed the award for the highest selling New Zealand Single. Fat Freddy's Drop were nominated in seven categories, including all three technical categories, and gained the Best Aotearoa Roots Album award. Midnight Youth were finalists in seven categories, and secured awards for Best Group, Best Rock Album and Best Engineer. The highest selling New Zealand Album was ''The Best: '98-'08'', a greatest hits album by rock group The Feelers, while Tiki Taane's \"Always on My Mind\" achieved the Radio Airplay Record of the Year award.
