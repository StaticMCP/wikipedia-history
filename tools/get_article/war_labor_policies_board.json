The National War Labor Board was a court of appeal where principles of the Labor Administration were involved in dispute\".  An early act was to adopt principles and policies of the National War Labor Board.  Frankfurter also had a seat on the War Industries Board.\nThe board formulated unified policies regarding labor administration during World War I.  It also promoted improved housing for workers during World War I. After the Armistice of 11 November 1918, the board reviewed how to cancel government contracts and demobilization.  It also studied wartime labor conditions at home and abroad, plus US postwar labor policies. Despite numerous recommendations from a member, Mary van Kleeck, who headed the Women in Industry Service group, the Board did not take action to address wage disparities between male and female workers during World War I.\n(1918) – indicates politico-socio-economic climate faced by  War Labor Policies Board of 1918-1919]]\nThe board had only one labor case referred to it by the National War Labor Board.\nThe board ended in March 1919.\nOrganization\nserved the board as the Navy's representative]]\nDepartmental members\nThe following departments and organizations had representatives on the board.:\n* Conditions of Living Committee\n* Conference Committee of National Labor Adjustment Agencies\n* Distribution of Milk, Ice, and Coal Committee\n* Enforcement of State Labor Laws Committee\n* Exemption of Skilled Laborers Committee\n* Insurance of Industrial Workers Committee\n* Price Control Committee\n* Relation of Military to Industrial Man-Power Committee\n* Standardization of Wages and Conditions of Work Committee\n* Stimulation of Production Committee\n* Workmen's Compensation Committee\n}}\nBoard members\nserved as the board's chairman]]\nThe following people served as executives of the board.  Hasse came to the board through Walter Weyl, who wrote on her behalf to Max Lowenthal.:\n** Mary Van Kleeck, director of the Women in Industry Service\n** Research Consultant: Grace Abbott\n** Researcher:  Adelaide Hasse\n* Executive Secretary:  George L. Bell\n* Business Adviser (also \"Industry Adviser\"):  Herbert F. Perkins\n* Economic Expert:  Walton H. Hamilton (and L.C. Marshall)\n* Labor Adviser:  John R. Alpine (American Federation of Labor)\n* Statistics Adviser:  F.W. Lamson\n* Staffer:  Helen Bary\n}}\nAt the time, Frankfurter was serving as Assistant to the Secretary of Labor.\nLegacy\nIn the immediate aftermath of WWI, the Bureau of Industrial Research assessed the War Labor Policies Board as follows:  Secretary of Labor Wilson was appointed by the President to act as War Labor Administrator, a power which he subsequently exercised in large measure through Mr. Frankfurter...  Thus Mr. Wilson combined in himself a dual authority... ... While created as a division of the Department of Labor, with a seat in the Labor Cabinet, this Board had virtually become the leglislative body of the National War Labor Administration and may thus be treated independently...    Among other things, the WLPB cemented a friendship between Roosevelt and Frankfurter, who had already met in 1906 and had continued to meet occasionally at the Harvard Club.\nLowenthal lived with Frankfurter in Washington, DC, at that time.\nThe United States National Archives and Records Administration houses the records of the WLPB.\nThese records have \"the distinction of being Record Group 1 because its records were the first records received by the National Archives in the mid-1930s. The records measure a mere 12 cubic feet, and there are only 7 record series.\"\nSee also\n* National War Labor Board (1918–1919)\n* Timeline of labor issues and events\n* American entry into World War I\n* United States home front during World War I\n* Food and Fuel Control Act\n* Victory garden\n* Liberty bond\n* United States in World War I\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.loc.gov/item/mm73047571/ Library of Congress]:  Felix Frankfurter papers, 1846-1966"
