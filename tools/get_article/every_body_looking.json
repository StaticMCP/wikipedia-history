A title to savor slowly, this is a captivating read, with even more depth imbued in the formatting and play with white space.\"\nBookPage wrote, \"Iloh movingly explores the concept of safety through Ada’s relationships with her parents, as well as in her evolving perspectives on money, potential careers and budding romantic crushes.
