It is dedicated to composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–1791).\nThis 7.5-meter-high statue was made by the architect  (1841–1915) and the sculptor Viktor Tilgner (1844–1896) and was unveiled at Albrechtsplatz (today ) on April 21, 1896, five days after Tilgner died. Tilgner's signature was completed with his death date.\nDescription\nThe sculptures are made of  from the Vinschgau, South Tyrol, whereas the steps of the foundation are made of dark diorite. The statue features componist Mozart with a music stand. The socle is adorned with ornaments, masks and wreaths and is framed within a semi-circular balustrade made of rough marble from Sterzing. The putti on the socle, which represent the power of Mozart's music, are stylistically suggestive of Art Nouveau.\nOn the front, a relief refers to two scenes of Mozart's opera Don Giovanni. The back side relief, based on a design by Louis Carmontelle, represents the six-year-old Mozart playing music with his father Leopold and his sister Nannerl.\nFile:Mozartdenkmal Wien Inschrift.jpg|Putti and Tilgner's signature\nFile:Mozartdenkmal z08.JPG|Relief on the back side\nFile:Mozart family crop.jpg|Louis Carmontelle's template for the back side of the monument\nHistory\nFunds were raised for a Mozart Monument 77 years before the statue was unveiled. But choosing the design and the location of the monument was problematic. Several proposals included Rathauspark, Stadtpark and Albrechtplatz. Two art competitions were organised to select the design of the monument. Tilgner's design came second in the professional jury's choice, but was selected by the Mozart Monument Committee over Edmund von Hellmer's draft.\nThe monument was damaged by the bombing of Vienna on March 12, 1945, before it was restored and placed at its actual location in the Burggaten on June 5, 1953. During the restoration, two sand-lime brick columns were added to the monument.\nIn 1992, the city of Vienna gifted a copy of the monument to Tokyo.\nFile:Mozart Denkmal in Wien.jpg|The monument at its original location (c. 1900)\nFile:USIS - Mozartdenkmal Burggarten 1 crop.jpg|The pedestal being installed in the Burggarten (April 17, 1953)\nFile:USIS - Mozartdenkmal Burggarten 3.jpg|The newly erected monument (June 17, 1953)\nFile:Mozart monument, Vienna, 2006 (01).jpg|Vienna Mozart statue and Sol key\nReferences"
