of the Coaches' Poll in 1999, the #1 ranking in the various weekly polls has been held by only a select group of teams.  Through the end of 2012, the team and the number of times they have held the #1 weekly ranking are shown below.  The number of times a team has been ranked #1 in the postseason poll (the national champion) is shown in parentheses.\nIn 1999, the results of a postseason poll, if one was conducted, are not known.  Therefore, an additional poll was presumed, and the #1 postseason ranking has been credited to the postseason tournament champion, the Northwestern Oklahoma State Rangers.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:40%;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#4169E1; color:white;\" |Team\n!style=\"background:#4169E1; color:white;\" |Total #1 Rankings\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|Carroll (MT)||56 (6)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||55 (3)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||25 (2)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||14 (1)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|Northwestern Oklahoma State||12 (1)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|Marian (IN)||8 (1)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||3\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|Saint Francis (IN)||3\n|}\nReferences"
