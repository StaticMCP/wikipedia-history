Launched under the aegis of the National Development Council, it seeks to achieve 4% annual growth in agriculture through development of Agriculture and its allied sectors (as defined by the Planning Commission) during the period under the 11th Five Year Plan (2007–11).\nAims\nThis programme is essentially a State Plan Scheme that seeks to provide the States and Territories of India with the autonomy to draw up plans for increased public investment in Agriculture by incorporating information on local requirements, geographical/climatic conditions, available natural resources/ technology and cropping patterns in their districts so as to significantly increase the productivity of Agriculture and its allied sectors and eventually maximize the returns of farmers in agriculture and its allied sectors.\nEligibility\nA State is eligible for funding under the RKVY if it maintains or increases the percentage of its expenditure on Agriculture and its Allied Sectors with respect to the total State Plan Expenditure, where the Base Line (which will move every year) for this expenditure is the average of the percentage of expenditure incurred by a State Government for the previous three years on Agriculture and its Allied Sectors minus any funds related to Agriculture and its allied sectors that it may already have received in that time under its State Plan.\nConsider the following hypothetical situation where a State seeks eligibility under the RKVY for the year 2010-11.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

During the first three years (2007–2010) of the implementation of the RKVY, an amount of , which is roughly 33% of the total allocation under the RKVY of .\nWhile presenting the Union Budget Of India, India's Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee stated that the allocation under the RKVY had been increased from the existing  in 2010-11 to  for the year 2011-12.\nStatus of release during 2016-17\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name of State\n!Amount (Rs. in Crore) and Release Date\n! rowspan=\"13\" |Data as on 24 August 2016\n|-\n|Andhra Pradesh\n|Rs.111.89 (19.08.2016)\n|-\n|Chhattisgarh\n|Rs.90.06 (23.05.2016)\n|-\n|Jammu & Kashmir\n|Rs.16.16 (19.08.2016)\n|-\n|Karnataka\n|Rs.202.93 (28.07.2016)\n|-\n|Madhya Pradesh\n|Rs.155.13 (23.05.2016)\n|-\n|Maharahstra\n|Rs.200.24 (24.05.2016)\n|-\n|Manipur\n|Rs.11.86 (15.07.2016)\n|-\n|Nagaland\n|Rs.14.86 (19.08.2016)\n|-\n|Odisha\n|Rs.45.86 (23.05.2016)\n|-\n|Rajasthan\n|Rs.198.71 (14.07.2016)\n|-\n|Tamil Nadu\n|Rs.152.87 (24.05.2016)\n|-\n|Uttarakhand\n|Rs.23.56 (15.07.2016)\n|}\nPerformance\nIn a press release by the Press Information Bureau dated 24 March 2011, a number of Indian states reported a significantly large increase in agricultural outlay as given below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
