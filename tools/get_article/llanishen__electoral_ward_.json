It covers the community of Llanishen (and until 2022 Thornhill, which was created  from the northern half of Llanishen in 2016).\nLlanishen is bordered to the north by the Lisvane and Thornhill ward, to the west by Rhiwbina, to the south by the Heath ward and to the southeast by Cyncoed.\nThe Llanishen ward elects two (formerly four) councillors to Cardiff Council and has been represented by a mixture of Conservative and Labour councillors.\nBetween 2014 and 2017 Llanishen councillor Phil Bale was the leader of Cardiff Council. On 2 August 2019 Phil Bale announced he was stepping down as councillor triggering a by-election on 21 November 2019. Labour subsequently lost its seat to the Conservative Party.\n2020 boundary review\nFollowing a Cardiff boundary review, intended to give better electoral parity, the new community of Thornhill was transferred from the Llanishen ward to the neighbouring Lisvane ward, effective from the 2022 Cardiff Council election. As a result, Llanishen's representation reduced from 4 to 2 councillors.\nRepresentation\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | Representation 1973 &ndash; date\n|-\n|-\n! valign=\"top\" | &nbsp;\n|\n! align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | Conservative\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | Ratepayer\n|-\n| 1973\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 6\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 0\n|-\n| 1976\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 5\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 1\n|-\n! valign=\"top\" | Election\n|\n! align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | Conservative\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labour&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|-\n| 1979\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 6\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 0\n|-\n| 1983\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 3\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 0\n|-\n| 1987\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 3\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 0\n|-\n| 1991\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 2\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 1\n|-\n| 1995\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 1\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 3\n|-\n| 1999\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 0\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 4\n|-\n| 2004\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 4\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 0\n|-\n| 2008\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 4\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 0\n|-\n| 2012\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 1\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 3\n|-\n| 2017\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 3\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 1\n|-\n| 2019BE\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 4\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 0\n|-\n| 2022\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 0\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 2\n|}\n= overall standing in the ward following a by-election\nOne of the four Conservative councillors who had represented the ward since 2004, Bob Smith, resigned from the Conservative party in November 2011, to sit as an Independent.
