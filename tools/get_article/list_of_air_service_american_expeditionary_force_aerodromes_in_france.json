It consisted of 1,120 personnel, of which 65 were officers. The Army was not ready for the deployment of aviation forces to Europe, and it became necessary to prepare after President Woodrow Wilson's declaration of war.\nOverview\nThe Fly Paper - 18 November 1918]]\nAs part of the buildup of US forces, aviation units were formed into aero squadrons primarily at Kelly Field, San Antonio, Texas, with additional units being formed at Rockwell Field, San Diego, California. Once formed, and prior to their deployment to Europe, Camp Taliaferro, north of Fort Worth, Texas, and several airfields near Toronto, Ontario, Canada were used by the British Royal Flying Corps (RFC) to perform flight training for the new aero squadrons. Camp Hancock, near Augusta, Georgia, was used for training service squadrons of aircraft mechanics as well as flight training.\nWhen ordered to deploy, units departed though Garden City, New York, which was the primary port of embarkment. Units there were loaded onto transport ships for the trans-Atlantic crossing. Upon arrival in Europe, Liverpool, England, and Brest, France, were the primary ports of disembarkation, although other ports were also used. Some aero squadrons arriving in England received additional training from the Royal Flying Corps, and later the Royal Air Force (RAF) once it was established, and were then attached to British squadrons, deploying with them to France. Others received further training and were sent to Winchester, Hampshire, where they awaited their cross-channel transfer to France, using the port of Southampton.\nAfter deployment to France, Air Service Replacement Concentration Barracks in St. Maixent was the primary reception center for new aero squadrons assigned to the American Expeditionary Force (AEF). There, units were classified as pursuit, bombardment or as observation units. Once processed, units were sent to one of several Air Instructional Centers (AIC) where they received additional training, then/or to the First Corps Observation Group School on Amanty Aerodrome or to the First Pursuit Organization and Training Center on Villeneuve-les-Vertus Aerodrome.\nAfter assignment, the Air Service's deployed units operated from grass aerodromes, at first using airfields already built by the French \"Aéronautique Militaire\", then from new aerodromes purposely built for the American forces. The exact location of many of these aerodromes is no longer certain as many archives have since disappeared, and as the facilities were only temporary, most of the traces have long vanished through ploughing.\nAfter the Armistice came into effect in November 1918, the wartime Air Service was demobilized. This process was completed within a year and the National Defense Act of 1920 then established the United States Army Air Service on a permanent basis, with several new units being formed. Later, some of the temporary wartime units were consolidated to retain the lineage and honors of their wartime service with the AEF.\nStations\nBelow is a list of the barracks and aerodromes used by the American Expeditionary Force that were sent to France during World War I. Most of the headquarters and command services used barracks or requisitioned properties not linked with flying grounds, yet some were installed on airfields as in Souilly, Saizerais or in Toul, where the \"Gengoult\" barracks had been built by the French \"Aeronautique Militaire\" on the northern edge of the Croix de Metz airfields (misspelt for \"Gengault\").\nAmerican sector\nCommand and control\n* Headquarters, Air Service, AEF, Chaumont, Champagne-Ardenne\n* First Army Air Service\n: Organized at: La Ferté-sous-Jouarre, Île-de-France, 10 August 1918\n: Moved to: Ligny-en-Barrois, Lorraine, 25 August 1918\n: Moved to: Souilly, Lorraine, 21 September – 11 November 1918\n* Second Army Air Service\n: Organized at: Toul, Lorraine, 12 October – 11 November 1918\n* Third Army Air Service\n: Organized at: Ligny-en-Barrois, Lorraine, 14 November 1918\n: Moved to: Longuyon, Lorraine, 22 November 1918\n: Moved to Germany.\n----\n* I Corps, Air Service, First Army\n: Organized at: Neufchâteau, Lorraine, 10 February 1918\n: Moved to: La Ferté-sous-Jouarre, Île-de-France, 1 July 1918\n: Moved to: Coincy, Picardy, 10 August 1918\n: Moved to: Toul, Lorraine, 16 August 1918\n: Moved to: Saizerais, Lorraine, 2 September 1918\n: Moved to: Rarécourt, Lorraine, 12 September 1918\n: Moved to: Chéhéry, Champagne-Ardenne, 2–11 November 1918\n* III Corps, Air Service, First Army\n: Organized at: Château-Thierry, Picardy, 2 August 1918\n: Moved to: Goussancourt, Picardy, 1 September 1918\n: Moved to: Malancourt, Lorraine, 24 October 1918\n: Moved to: Dun-sur-Meuse, Lorraine, 10–11 November 1918\n* V Corps, Air Service, First Army\n: Organized at: Luxeuil-les-Bains, Franche-Comté, 7 August 1918\n: Moved to: Souilly, Lorraine, 7 September 1918\n: Moved to: Fauconcourt, Lorraine, 20 September 1918\n: Moved to: Ville-sur-Cousances, Lorraine, 22 September 1918\n: Moved to: Cheppy, Lorraine, 31 October – 11 November 1918\n* VI Corps, Air Service, First Army\n: Located at: Saizerais, Lorraine, 23 October – 11 November 1918\nCombat aerodromes\n* Amanty Aerodrome\n: Located  NW of Amanty, Meuse\n: French, then American Air Service training and operational airfield\n:: I Corps Observation Group School\n:: Headquarters, I Corps Observation Group, 2 February-3 May 1918\n:: Headquarters, 1st Day Bombardment Group, 10–25 September 1918\n:: 1st Aero Squadron (training), 19 October 1917 – 4 April 1918\n:: 91st Aero Squadron (training), 14 December 1917 – 24 May 1918\n:: 88th Aero Squadron (training), 1 February – 28 May 1918\n:: 12th Aero Squadron (training, then observation), 2 February – 3 May 1918\n:: 90th Aero Squadron (training), 19 April – 13 June 1918\n:: 99th Aero Squadron (Observation School), 31 May – 1 July 1918\n:: 135th Aero Squadron (training), 19–30 July 1918\n:: 8th Aero Squadron (training), 31 July – 31 August 1918\n:: 50th Aero Squadron (training), 27 July – 4 September 1918\n:: 104th Aero Squadron (training), 1–4 August 1918\n:: 9th Aero Squadron (Night Army Observation) 28 August – 21 September 1918\n:: 96th Aero Squadron (Day Bombardment), 18 May – 23 September 1918\n:: 20th Aero Squadron (Day Bombardment), 7–23 September 1918\n:: 11th Aero Squadron (Day Bombardment), 6–24 September 1918\n:: 166th Aero Squadron (Day Bombardment), 21–25 September 1918\n* Autreville Aerodrome\n: Located  SSW of Autreville, Vosges\n: RAF operational, then American Air Service training and operational airfield\n:: 168th Aero Squadron (training) 2 Sept 1918 -
