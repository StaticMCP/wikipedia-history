The pageant is only open to children between five and six years old. The pageant in Confluence, Pennsylvania, gives titles to young children and babies with titles like Pumpkin Tot and Mister Pumpkin. The Spring Hope, North Carolina, Pumpkin Festival crowns a Baby Pumpkin Seed during their Pumpkin Festival.\nIn fiction\nA number of works of fiction have titles which include a Pumpkin Queen or Pumpkin Princess. Long Live the Pumpkin Queen is a book by Shea Ernshaw about a young girl (Sally, a fictional character from the Tim Burton film The Nightmare Before Christmas) who is crowned Pumpkin Queen: Queen of Halloween Town. The book was released as a commercial tie-in with the Tim Burton universe. The Pumpkin Queen is a short film directed by Angie Hansen. The film is about a scientist who wants revenge against the Monroe County Pumpkin Queen.\nIn 2007, author Marlane Kennedy wrote Me and the Pumpkin Queen, a novel centred entirely around the subject of a preteen girl, Mildred, and her best friend, local town boy Jacob, trying to grow the perfect pumpkin in honour of Mildred's deceased mother, a former Pumpkin Queen. Kennedy incorporated real-life references to Canadian varieties of special pumpkins, agricultural tips for growing pumpkins, rural lore about the culture of pumpkin-growing, and her own personal experiences attending the Circleville Pumpkin Show in her youth.\nSee also\n* Queens of Industry\nReferences"
