In August 1878 land in the new marine township of Scarborough went to auction, postponed some months until completion of the Scarborough Hotel, in order that perspective purchasers could obtain accommodation in the township while examining the allotments. Advertisements described the beach as \"unsurpassed in Australia, having splendid stretches of pure hard sand, perfectly innocent of mud or mangrove. .... a distinctive feature at this northern or Scarborough end should be recognised in the highly interesting chain of crescent-shaped bays, the waters of which wash the township cliffs, affording sheltered coves for boating purposes...\"\nIn 1882, the proprietors of the re-surveyed town of Scarborough offered for auction, with no reserve, the remaining 250 allotments, advertising in great detail the attractions of the area. These included the \"abundance of schnapper, whiting, turtle, crabs, oysters, etc awaiting capture.\" In 1884, land from Queen's Beach \"adjoins to and forms part of the property reserved for the Hon S.W. Griffith [Samuel Griffith] for the purpose of building a seaside residence\" was advertised.
