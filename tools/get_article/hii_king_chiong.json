In recognition of his meritorious philanthropist activities and contributions to the State of Sarawak, government, and the people, he was conferred with Ahli Bintang Sarawak (A.B.S.) – Member of the Order of the Star of Sarawak by The Governor of Sarawak.\nEarly life and education\nHii King Chiong is a Malaysian Chinese and of Foochow descent. He is married with Madam Ting Hua Eng with whom they had a son and a daughter. His father, YBhg. Datuk Hii Yii Peng who is a businessman in Sibu, always teach him the importance of contributing back to the society once successful. This has become his main life perspective. He was educated at Methodist Primary School and Sacred Heart Secondary School in Sibu.

He supports the party continuously by helping to campaign and making financial contributions. Hii served on the SUPP Piasau Branch Committee and as the Pro Tem chairman from 2012 to 2014. Hii's success in his political career is based largely on his accessibility to the community in Miri.\nIn 2016 he filed an election petition in Pujut, claiming that opposing candidate, Dr Ting Tiong Choon was ineligible to run in the election as he had dual citizenship. Despite this, Hii lost the election, but regularly campaigns on behalf of BN candidates in the region.\nOffices Commitment\nHii King Chiong has over numerous years, involved himself in different responsible capacities in various social bodies, including but not limited to schools, social associations, and so forth. He set-ups two service centres in Miri, recruited volunteers and has since solved many problems faced by the Miri Society.\nHii's philanthropy is focused on Chinese education, he works together with associations to negotiate the best for Chinese education and hoped that one day it would have the kind of recognition enjoyed by government schools.
