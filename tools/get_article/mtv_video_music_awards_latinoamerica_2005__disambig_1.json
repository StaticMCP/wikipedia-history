However, due to the approach of Hurricane Wilma towards the Mexican Riviera Maya, the show was moved from October 20 to the 19th, but it was eventually postponed. The date was then moved again, this time to December 22.\nA couple of months later, MTV decided that it was not feasible to have the show on the aforementioned scheduled date. Instead, the awards were given out on a half-hour special called \"Por Fin Los Premios MTV 2005\" where the winners received their awards after having practical jokes played on them (a la ''Punk'd''). Would-be hosts Molotov hosted this special and played live on a public concert in Playa del Carmen. A second special, called \"Lenguas en Vivo: Ganadores en Concierto\" (Tongues Live: Winners in Concert) aired that same day with some of the winners performing. Miranda! played from their studio in Argentina, two songs from Juanes's concert in Buenos Aires were also filmed by MTV for this special, and Panda and Reik also performed from MTV's studios in Mexico City. A third and final 1/2 hour special called \"El Show que Wilma se Voló\" was also broadcast that day showing how the show was supposed to happen and the reaction of the artists and MTV's workers after they found out about its cancellation.\nNominations\nWinners in bold.\nArtist of the Year\n* Café Tacuba\n* Diego Torres\n* Juanes\n* Miranda!\n* Shakira\nVideo of the Year\n* Juanes — \"La Camisa Negra\"\n* Miranda! — \"Don\"\n* Molotov — \"Amateur\"\n* Shakira — \"La Tortura (featuring Alejandro Sanz)\"\n* Shakira — \"No\"\nBest Male Artist\n* Alejandro Sanz\n* Daddy Yankee\n* Diego Torres\n* Juanes\n* Tiziano Ferro\nBest Female Artist\n* Andrea Echeverri\n* Belinda\n* Ely Guerra\n* Paulina Rubio\n* Shakira\nBest Group or Duet\n* Café Tacuba\n* La Ley\n* Miranda!\n* Molotov\n* Reik\nBest Pop Artist\n* Belinda\n* Diego Torres\n* Julieta Venegas\n* Reik\n* Shakira\nBest Rock Artist\n* Babasónicos\n* Catupecu Machu\n* Juanes\n* Lucybell\n* Moderatto\nBest Alternative Artist\n* Andrea Echeverri\n* Belanova\n* Miranda!\n* Molotov\n* Natalia y La Forquetina\nBest Independent Artist\n* La Etnnia\n* Los Natas\n*  Panda\n* Pornois\n* Thermo\nNo public voting\nBest Pop Artist — International\n* Ashlee Simpson\n* Backstreet Boys\n* Gwen Stefani\n* Hilary Duff\n* Kelly Clarkson\nBest Rock Artist — International\n* Coldplay\n* Foo Fighters\n* Good Charlotte\n* Green Day\n* Simple Plan\nBest Hip-Hop/R&B Artist — International\n* 50 Cent\n* Beastie Boys\n* The Black Eyed Peas\n* Missy Elliott\n* Eminem\nBest New Artist — International\n* Ashlee Simpson\n* Gwen Stefani\n* Kelly Clarkson\n* My Chemical Romance\n* The Killers\nBest Artist — North\n* Belanova\n* Café Tacuba\n* Moderatto\n* Molotov\n* Reik\nBest New Artist — North\n* Delux\n* Elli Noise\n* Mariana Ochoa\n* Reik\n* Thermo\nBest Artist — Central\n* Andrea Echeverri\n* Juanes\n* Kudai\n* La Ley\n* Shakira\nBest New Artist — Central\n* Andrea Echeverri\n* Ciudad Satélite\n* La Etnnia\n* Kudai\n* Los Píxel\nBest Artist — South\n* Árbol\n* Babasónicos\n* Bersuit Vergarabat\n* Catupecu Machu\n* Miranda!\nBest New Artist — South\n* Bahiano\n* Cuentos Borgeanos\n* Flavio y La Mandiga\n* Lourdes\n* Luciano Supervielle\nPerformances\nPor Fin Los Premios MTV 2005\n* Molotov — \"Mamar\"\nLenguas en Vivo: Ganadores en Concierto\n* Reik — \"Que Vida La Mía\" and \"Yo Quisiera\"\n* Miranda! — \"Don\"\n* Panda — \"Cita En El Quirófano\"\n* Juanes — \"La Camisa Negra\" and \"Dámelo\"\nMemorable Moments\n* The show being postponed twice and finally cancelled (due to the approach of Hurricane Wilma).\nReferences"
