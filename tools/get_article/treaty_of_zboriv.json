All infamies will be cancelled.\n* The Crown Forces are not allowed to be based in Cossack towns.\n* Jews are not allowed to be citizens of Cossack towns.\n* In the Kyiv Voivodeship, Bratslav Voivodeship and Chernihiv Voivodeship all offices can be held by Orthodox.\n* In the city of Kiev, because there are privileged Ruthenian schools, the Jesuit fathers are not to be founded there and in other Ukrainian cities, but to be transferred somewhere else. And all other schools, which were there in ancient times, are to be preserved.\nTo summarize the Polish army, Uniates, and Jews were banned from the territory of the Kyiv Voivodeship, Bratslav Voivodeship, and Chernihiv Voivodeship;  governmental offices in the Cossack Hetmanate could be held only by Eastern Orthodox nobility (either Polish or Ukrainian administration of Eastern Orthodox religion), the Orthodox Church was granted privileges and the Crimean Khanate was to be paid a large sum of money.\nThe treaty was ratified by the Diet, which was in session between November 1649 and January 1650, but hostilities resumed when Catholic bishops refused to recognise the provisions of the treaty (admission to the Senate of the Orthodox metropolitan of Kyiv, Sylvestr Kosiv).\nSee also\n*List of treaties\n*The Ruin (Ukrainian history)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Arkadii Zhukovsky.
