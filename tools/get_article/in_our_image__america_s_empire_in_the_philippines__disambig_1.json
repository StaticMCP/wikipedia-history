The book details the Philippine–American War (1899–1902) and the subsequent American occupation of the islands. Karnow described the book as \"the story of America's only major colonial experience. How did we perform? What did we do there? What have we left there?\" Karnow was a journalist in southeast Asia from 1959 to 1974. He made six trips to the Philippines for research while writing the book, and also drew heavily on archives.\nThe book was awarded the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for History.\nKarnow worked concurrently on, and was the ‘chief correspondent’ and narrator for, a companion three-part PBS television documentary, The U.S. and the Philippines: In Our Image, which aired in 1989.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.c-span.org/video/?7773-1/image Booknotes interview with Karnow on In Our Image, May 28, 1989.]"
