With the entry into force of a new constitution in 1975 and the finalization of the new political framework, elections were held for the first regular President of the Republic. The ruling conservative New Democracy, which had 215 MPs, supported conservative politician Konstantinos Tsatsos, while the second-largest party, Centre Union – New Forces, proposed another conservative politician and former Prime Minister of Greece, Panagiotis Kanellopoulos. In the ballot held on 19 June, Tsatsos was comfortably elected with 210 votes out of 295 MPs present, with Kanellopoulos receiving 65 votes and the 20 MPs of PASOK and United Left dropping blank votes.\nReferences"
