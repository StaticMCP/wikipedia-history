In March 1938 a huge Nationalist force of 150,000 men and more than 900 planes started an offensive in Aragon, breaking the Republican front. Most of the units of the Republican Army fled and the retreat became a rout, but in some points others fought bravely.\nBattle of Caspe\nOn 9 March the Nationalists advanced 36 kilometres, on 10 March they occupied Belchite held by the XV International Brigade, and pushed forward to Caspe. Then, the commander in chief of the Republican army, Vicente Rojo ordered to establish a defensive line with the town of Caspe at its centre. By 16 March three Nationalist divisions of the Varela's Army, led by Fernando Barrón, Muñoz Grandes and Bautista Sánchez, surrounded the town held by the XV International Brigade. The Brigade fought with great valour, but after two days of heavy fighting Caspe fell to the Nationalists.\nAftermath\nThe Nationalists continued their advance and by 3 April occupied Lérida.\nSee also\n* List of Spanish Nationalist military equipment of the Spanish Civil War\n* List of Spanish Republican military equipment of the Spanish Civil War\nNotes\nReferences\n*Beevor, Antony.
