Mojmilo Ridge was a critical position providing the Serb forces with a sniper advantage over southwestern parts of Sarajevo. The defense of the city relied on a combination of government police, local militias, support. Control of Mojmilo Hill was strategically significant, as it hindered enemy advancements toward key military installations such as the \"Viktor Bubanj\" and Nedžarići barracks. This defensive effort also thwarted attempts to encircle the Dobrinja area, contributing to the broader defense of the region.\nBattle\nIn June 1992, the Bosnian Government launched a coordinated operation to secure Mojmilo Ridge, a strategic high ground southwest of Sarajevo. The area had been used by Bosnian Serb forces to target the city with snipers and sporadic artillery fire. The ridge's capture was essential to reduce threats to the southwestern neighborhoods of Sarajevo.\nThe JNA attempted a major escalation against the city by sending two armored columns from garrisons outside Sarajevo. One column advanced from the west near the airport but was halted by improvised government defenses in the Stup neighborhood. Another column moved north from the Lukavica barracks toward the government-controlled city center. Bosnian forces, repelled the advance using Molotov cocktails, rifle grenades, and a makeshift artillery piece. Four tanks were destroyed, and the remaining vehicles retreated south with no ground gained, marking a significant psychological victory for Sarajevo's defenders.\nFollowing these clashes, the Bosnian Government organized attacks to secure hilltop positions overlooking the city. Their efforts were met with resistance, but they successfully captured Mojmilo Ridge. While some gains were temporary due to counterattacks and artillery fire, retaining control of the ridge removed the sniper threat to key parts of the city, providing Sarajevo with a crucial defensive advantage during the ongoing siege.\nSee also\n* Battle of Žuč\nReferences\n* [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015051811043&seq=192&format=plaintext Balkan Battlegrounds: Sarajevo Siege, 1992]"
