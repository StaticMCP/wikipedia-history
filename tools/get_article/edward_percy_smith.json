His plays included The Shop at Sly Corner and, with Reginald Denham, Ladies in Retirement. He also worked occasionally in television and film, including contributing to the screenplay for the 1960 Hammer horror film The Brides of Dracula. He died in Eastbourne aged 77.\nSmith has earned mild infamy among biologists for releasing 12 specimens of the marsh frog in his garden at Stone-in-Oxney, Kent, during the winter of 1934&ndash;5. These escaped into a nearby mere, before steadily spreading. Today, it is regarded as an invasive species which eats the tadpoles of the common frog and which it widely succeeds.\nSelected plays\n* The Last Straw (1937)\n* Suspect (1937)\n* The Shop at Sly Corner (1945)\nReferences\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*"
