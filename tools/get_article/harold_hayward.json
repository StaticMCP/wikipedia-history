His brother, Morgan, also represented New Zealand in rugby league.\nRugby union career\nGrowing up in Thames, Hayward played rugby union for the Goldfields sub-union and represented Auckland. His 33 appearances for Auckland between 1903 and 1911 were, however, sporadic – undoubtedly because he lived so far away from the city.\nHayward played for New Zealand against the touring Anglo-Welsh Lions in on 25 July 1908. He also made his sole appearance for the North Island in 1908.\nRugby league career\nHayward switched to rugby league in 1912 and made an immediate impact, playing for Thames, Auckland and touring Australia with New Zealand that year. Like Goldfields, Thames was a sub-league of the Auckland Rugby League at the time.\nHayward captained the 1913 New Zealand tour of Australia and played for Auckland against Great Britain in 1914.\nReturn to rugby union\nHayward returned to rugby union after World War One.\nReferences"
