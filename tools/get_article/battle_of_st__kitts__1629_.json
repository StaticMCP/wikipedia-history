English settlers had been recruited to the number of nearly 3,000, and guns and ammunition had been sent over. Orders were given to the commander of the outward bound Spanish fleet Armada de Sotavento to Mexico to clear out the heavily armed English and French colonies.\nRaid\nThe Spanish expedition, under the command of Admiral Fadrique Álvarez de Toledo Osorio, dropped anchor at Nevis Island and captured and destroyed several English ships anchored there. Spanish soldiers were then sent ashore to destroy the few newly built structures and capture the settlers.\nWhen Nevis was seized by the Spanish forces, the island's plantation owners were deserted by their indentured servants, who swam out to the Spanish ships to cries of \"Liberty, joyful Liberty\". Many of the indentured servants on the island were Irish Roman Catholics and as such preferred to join forces with the Catholic Spanish than remain with the Protestant plantation owners.\nOn 7 September 1629, the Spanish expedition moved on to the sister island Saint Kitts and burned the entire settlement.\nAftermath\nBy the terms of surrender, the Spanish allotted shipping to carry some 700 of the colonists back to England. But other colonists, variously estimated at 200 to 400, evaded capture by taking to the hills and woods.\nAfter an agreement between the Spanish and English crowns, the Spanish departed in 1630, handing the island to England. The fugitives returned to their plantations to form the nucleus of a new phase of colonization.\nFootnotes\nReferences\n*Robert L.
