The province is largely dependent on imported power from NB Power generation facilities in New Brunswick. Two 180 MW capacity submarine power lines provide more than 80% of the provincial load. Since the early 2000, the provincial government has promoted the province as an ideal location for developing wind farms.\nMaritime Electric, a subsidiary of St. John's-based Fortis Inc., operates the integrated public utility serving most of the province, with the exception of the City of Summerside which has had a municipal electric utility in operation since 1920; Summerside Electric purchases power from sources such as NB Power that is transmitted to the city through Maritime Electric's network. Both utilities own and operate generating stations (diesel combustion turbines); these plants are used as peakers or during emergencies.\nPetroleum\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! width=\"31%\" | Name\n! width=\"15%\" |Location\n! width=\"7%\" | Capacity (MW)\n! width=\"7%\" | Date\n! width=\"20%\" | Owner\n! width=\"10%\" | Type\n! width=\"7%\" |\n|-\n| Borden Generating Station |||| 42 ||  ||Maritime Electric || Combustion turbine (diesel) ||\n|-\n| Charlottetown Generating Station |||| 50 ||  ||Maritime Electric || Combustion turbine (diesel) ||\n|-\n|Harvard Street Generating Station |||| 25 ||  ||Summerside Electric || Combustion turbine (diesel) ||\n|}\nPhotovoltaic\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! width=\"31%\" | Name\n! width=\"15%\" |Location\n! width=\"7%\" | Capacity (MW)\n! width=\"7%\" | Date\n! width=\"20%\" | Owner\n! width=\"7%\" |\n|-\n|-\n|Summerside Sunbank |||| 21.6 ||  ||Summerside Electric||\n|-\n|}\nWind\nList of all wind farms in Prince Edward Island.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! width=\"31%\" | Name\n! width=\"15%\" |Location\n! width=\"7%\" | Capacity (MW)\n! width=\"7%\" | Date\n! width=\"20%\" | Owner\n! width=\"7%\" |\n|-\n|Eastern Kings Wind Farm |||| 30 ||  ||PEI Energy Corporation||\n|-\n|North Cape Wind Farm |||| 10.6 ||  ||PEI Energy Corporation||\n|-\n|Norway Wind Farm |||| 9 ||  ||Suez Renewable Energy||\n|-\n|Summerside Wind Farm |||| 12 ||  ||Summerside Electric||\n|-\n|West Cape Wind Farm |||| 99 ||  ||Suez Renewable Energy||\n|}\nDecommissioned stations\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! width=\"31%\" | Name\n! width=\"15%\" |Location\n! width=\"7%\" | Capacity (MW)\n! width=\"7%\" | Date\n! width=\"20%\" | Owner\n! width=\"10%\" | Type\n! width=\"7%\" |\n|-\n| Charlottetown Thermal Generating Station |||| 60 || 1960–2021 ||Maritime Electric || Thermal (fuel oil) ||\n|-\n|Knox's Dam ||||  || 1917–1955 ||Maritime Electric Company Limited|| Hydro (ROR) ||\n|-\n|}\nNotes and references\nSee also\n* Maritime Electric\n* Electricity sector in Canada\n* List of power stations in Canada"
