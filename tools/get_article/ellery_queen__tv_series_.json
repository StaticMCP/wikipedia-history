The series ran for a single season on NBC from September 11, 1975, to April 4, 1976. Jim Hutton stars as the eponymous sleuth, along with David Wayne as his father, Inspector Richard Queen.\nEach episode revolves around author Queen investigating a murder, usually with the assistance of his father. The series uses some of the same dramatic devices found in the early Queen novels and radio shows. This includes Hutton breaking the fourth wall, to challenge the viewer to solve the mystery.\nPlot\nSet in post-World War II New York City (the first episode is set on New Year's Eve of 1946) the show revolved around author and amateur detective Ellery Queen (Jim Hutton), a bachelor who lives with his widowed father, Inspector Richard Queen (David Wayne). Ellery solves cases while writing his latest book, usually with assistance from his father, and Inspector Queen's right-hand-man, Sergeant Velie (Tom Reese).\nSimilar to the early Queen books and radio episodes, the audience is challenged to solve the mystery. For the television series, this led to Hutton breaking the fourth wall before the confrontation scene. This gave the viewers a short exposition about the case, and leaving the viewer to put together the clues.\nThe final act always used the detective cliché of calling together all the suspects, with Ellery Queen presenting the solution (except in one episode when the elder Queen took over). The great detective's detailed exposition allowed audience members to assess how they had guessed right and wrong. In some episodes, Queen's explanation disproved the theory of a rival sleuth.\nThe series departed from the original stories in two respects. An element of mild humour was added by making the Ellery Queen character slightly physically clumsy, and the character of rival radio detective Simon Brimmer (John Hillerman) was created for the series.\nCast\n*Jim Hutton as Ellery Queen\n*David Wayne as Inspector Richard Queen\n*Tom Reese as Sgt. Thomas Velie\nRecurring\n*John Hillerman as Simon Brimmer, a radio host and Queen's frenemy. He frequently competes with Ellery, and jumps to conclusions about the murderer based on one piece of minor evidence.\n*Ken Swofford as Frank Flannigan, a reporter who competes with Queen on several cases.\n*Nina Roman as Grace, Inspector Queen's secretary.\n*Arch Johnson as Deputy Commissioner Hayes, Inspector Queen's boss.\n*Maggie Nelson as Vera, Frank Flannigan's secretary.\nGuest stars\n*Julie Adams\n*Rene Auberjonois\n*Don Ameche\n*Dana Andrews\n*Eve Arden\n*Jim Backus\n*Ken Berry\n*Lloyd Bochner\n*Tom Bosley\n*George Burns\n*Gretchen Corbett\n*Joan Collins\n*William Demarest\n*Troy Donohue\n*Rhonda Fleming\n*Anne Francis\n*Eva Gabor\n*Lynda Day George\n*Larry Hagman\n*Pat Harrington\n*Rosanna Huffman\n*Robert Loggia\n*Guy Lombardo\n*Ida Lupino\n*Nan Martin\n*Roddy McDowall\n*Ed McMahon\n*Vera Miles\n*Ray Milland\n*Sal Mineo\n*Dina Merrill\n*Donald O'Connor\n*Bert Parks\n*Walter Pidgeon\n*Vincent Price\n*Pernell Roberts\n*Cesar Romero\n*Barbara Rush\n*Dean Stockwell\n*Dee Wallace\n*Ray Walston\n*Betty White\nProduction\nRichard Levinson and William Link had previously written a pilot based on the Ellery Queen character, ''Ellery Queen: Don't Look Behind You, also produced by Universal. The pilot, directed by Barry Shear, aired as a television movie on NBC on November 19, 1971. Peter Lawford and Harry Morgan had portrayed Ellery and Inspector Queen, respectively, with E. G. Marshall and Stefanie Powers in co-starring roles, and Bill Zuckert as Sgt. Velie. However, Levinson and Link did not like the changes to the script made by producer Leonard Ackerman, and used the pseudonym Ted Leighton as the credited writer. NBC did not order a series from this pilot.\nIn 1974, Levinson and Link retooled their idea into a new pilot, this time with Jim Hutton and David Wayne as Ellery and Inspector Queen. A television pilot premiered on March 23, 1975, with the made-for-TV movie Ellery Queen: Too Many Suspects. Levinson and Link adapted the script from the 1965 Ellery Queen novel The Fourth Side of the Triangle. NBC ordered a series based on the pilot in May 1975.\nA single season of 22 episodes followed. The theme music was by Elmer Bernstein. The last episode aired on April 4, 1976, after which NBC cancelled the series. The series ranked 68 out of 97 shows that season. Levinson and Link later retooled the idea of an author and amateur sleuth who solves murders into the CBS series, Murder, She Wrote''.\nReception\nRichard Schickel, reviewing the series at its premiere in September 1975, called it \"a garage-sale period piece\"; he said \"the presence of Guy Lombardo, some ancient autos and the oldest of detective story conventions (all suspects are assembled in one room to await the results of the detective's ratiocinations) are supposed to evoke nostalgia. They do not&mdash;and the format's stasis is numbing.\"\nIn 1979, Levinson and Link won a Special Edgar Award for creating the Columbo and Ellery Queen TV series.\nEpisodes\n|ShortSummary    = 78-minute pilot: When a famous fashion designer is found murdered, Inspector Richard Queen of the NYPD is baffled by her dying clue (she pulled the plugs for her clock and TV set out of the wall at exactly 10:25 PM), prompting him to bring in his son, mystery writer Ellery Queen, to help in the investigation.\n|LineColor       = FFA500\n}}\n| ex1label =\n}}\n|OriginalAirDate =\n|ShortSummary    = Soon after a wealthy industrialist threatens to disinherit family and staff at a 1947 New Year's Eve party, he is found murdered in a nearby phone booth by fellow guest Inspector Queen, who calls on son Ellery to help unmask the killer.\n|LineColor       = FFA500\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = When an heiress is found dead from an apparent suicide, Ellery Queen suspects she was murdered, but the investigation is hindered by interference from radio detective Simon Brimmer.\n|LineColor       = FFA500\n}}\n| tlabel =\n}}\n|OriginalAirDate =\n|ShortSummary    = A fishing trip for Richard and Ellery Queen soon becomes a working vacation when they are asked to help investigate the murder of a small-town magnate who was whacked over the head with an ornamental dog figurine.\n|LineColor       = FFA500\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = A tyrannical comic book creator is shot to death in his office, and Ellery Queen becomes the prime suspect because of arguments over how he was portrayed in the victim's comics.\n|LineColor       = FFA500\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = Inspector Queen calls in his son Ellery to help investigate the murder of a newspaper publisher, who first disappears from his private express elevator and then is later found there dead by gunshot.\n|LineColor       = FFA500\n}}\n| ex1label =\n}}\n|OriginalAirDate =\n|ShortSummary    = Beloved Vera Bethune stars as Miss Aggie in a radio soap opera, but is about to be written out.
