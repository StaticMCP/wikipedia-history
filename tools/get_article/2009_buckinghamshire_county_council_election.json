Those who were temporarily away from their ordinary address (for example, away working, on holiday, in student accommodation or in hospital) were also entitled to vote in the local elections, although those who had moved abroad and registered as overseas electors cannot vote in the local elections. It is possible to register to vote at more than one address (such as a university student who had a term-time address and lives at home during holidays) at the discretion of the local Electoral Register Office, but it remains an offence to vote more than once in the same local government election.\nResults Summary\nThe overall turnout was 40.50% with a total of 190,795 valid votes cast. A total of 843 ballots were rejected.\nCouncil Composition\nFollowing the last election in 2005 the composition of the council was:\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ ↓\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:;; width:77.19%;\" | 44\n| style=\"background:; width:19.3%;\" | 11\n| style=\"background:; width:3.51%;\" | 2\n|-\n| Conservatives\n| Liberal Democrats\n| L\n|}\nAfter the election, the composition of the council was:\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ ↓\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:;; width:80.7%;\" | 46\n| style=\"background:; width:19.3%;\" | 11\n|-\n| Conservatives\n| Liberal Democrats\n|}\nL - Labour\nWard results\nAsterisks denote incumbent Councillors seeking re-election.
