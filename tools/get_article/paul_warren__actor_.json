He is best known for playing characters wearing heavy prosthetic makeup and/or creature suits, most notably in Star Wars and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, in films and television series such as Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), Thor: The Dark World (2013), Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015), Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017), Andor (2022), and The Marvels (2023).\nWarren also had creature acting roles in Beetlejuice Beetlejuice (2024), Clash of the Titans (2010), World War Z (2013), Ghost Stories (2017), Willow (2022) and Unwelcome (2023).\nEarly life\nPaul Warren was born in West London.\nCareer\nHe began his film career in 2006 as a body double for Daniel Radcliffe on the film Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007): \"I spent much of my time 20ft up in the air on the hydraulic broomstick system and doing other physically demanding activities during the shoot, whilst building a good rapport with the cast/crew and a reputation as a versatile performer\".\nLater that same year, he was recommended to Stan Winston Studio as a good choice to portray an emaciated version of the title character (played by Mike Vogel) in The Deaths of Ian Stone. Crediting Winston and his team, he said, \"This door opening into the world of acting under silicone and foam latex, is what ultimately led to a film career playing characters in heavy prosthetics and creature suits\".\nHis first creature performing role was in 2009, where he played a tortured soul who pulls the boat across the River Styx in the remake of Clash of the Titans.\nIn 2010, Warren was used as a visual effect double for skinny Steve Rogers in Captain America: The First Avenger. He was the original template for Skinny Steve in the pre-production VFX head replacement tests and was on set for the recruitment scene as a visual reference. Body double duties for the rest of production (which total about 5% according to director Joe Johnston) were performed by stage actor Leander Deeny.\nOn getting the role of Varmik, one of the Hassk triplet's in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, he says, \"It felt very surreal. I wasn't told what it was that I was being asked to go in for; only that the production was putting together a team of core creature performers for a film at Pinewood Studios. I had been recommended to them by creature designer and makeup artist Martin Rezard, who I had worked with previously on Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor: The Dark World.\"\nVarmik is of particular interest to Star Wars fans due to his origin: \"The character is based on 2 classic pieces of Ralph McQuarrie's Star Wars production art from 1975. The cantina showdown and early Chewbacca designs. The former is a particular favorite of J. J. Abrams' that he wanted to bring to life on screen.\"\nIn Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Warren plays a dowager alien called Gatha Elbaphay in the Canto Bight casino. The character created quite a buzz online when it was revealed by director Rian Johnson that the animatronic space pug Awgree she holds was based on Carrie Fisher's very own pet pooch Gary, affectionately known on set as Space Gary.\nWarren is credited as Quadpaw performer in the Star Wars television series Andor. He was also a Troll in episode 6, season 1 of the TV series Willow. Both were produced by Lucasfilm.\nDuring the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, Warren joined the cast and crew of the killer goblin film Unwelcome. As well as playing the Redcap goblin Mr. Sniff, he also took on a new role of Creature Movement Coach for Nick Chopping's stunt team.\n2023 saw Paul working once again with Neal Scanlan's creature workshop on the much anticipated sequel to Beetlejuice titled Beetlejuice Beetlejuice. He played the role of Shrinker Tom and was a puppeteer in the waiting room performing the hand for the man in a box.\nOccasionally he still steps out from behind the prosthetics, for example when he provided mime/movement for Steven Spielberg's Ready Player One in 2018 and when he was a special action performer on Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014) for that stunt scene in the church choreographed by the late Brad Allan.\nFilmography\nFilm\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
