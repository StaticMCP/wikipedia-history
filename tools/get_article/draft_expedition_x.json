It features biologist Phil Torres and television host/writer Jessica Chobot and is hosted by Josh Gates, though he does not usually join them in the field, and features topics more explicitly paranormal than those covered in Expedition Unknown.\nExpedition X premiered on Discovery Channel on February 12, 2020.\nJosh Gates has tapped scientist Phil Torres and paranormal researcher Jessica Chabot to investigate reports of supernatural encounters, mysterious creatures, and astonishing extraterrestrial phenomena. Whether trekking through the remote jungles of Cambodia in search of a legendary ape-man or exploring the secrets of Mexico's infamous Island of the Dolls, the team is searching for answers to the world's most extraordinary mysteries.\nSeason 8 saw a major change-up in personnel as longtime regular Jessica Chobot left the series, her position eventually being filled by Heather Amaro.\nSeries overview\n| end1        =\n| color2      = #004000\n| link2       = #Season 2 (2020)\n| episodes2   = 6\n| start2      =\n| end2        =\n| color3      = #77DDDD\n| link3       = #Season 3 (2021)\n| episodes3   = 7\n| start3      =\n| end3        =\n| color4      = #55BBDD\n| link4       = #Season 4 (2021)\n| episodes4   = 6\n| start4      =\n| end4        =\n| color5      = #349EE4\n| link5       = #Season 5 (2022)\n| episodes5   = 7\n| start5      =\n| end5        =\n| color6      = #6600CC\n| link6       = #Season 6 (2023)\n| episodes6   = 8\n| start6      =\n| end6        =\n| color7      = #8811BB\n| link7       = #Season 7 (2024)\n| episodes7   = 8\n| start7      =\n| end7        =\n| color8      = #008000\n| link8       = #Season 8 (2024)\n| episodes8   = 8\n| start8      =\n| end8        =\n| color9      = #4682B4\n| link9       = #Season 9 (2025)\n| episodes9   = 9\n| start9      =\n| end9        =\n| color10      = #FFCC00\n| link10       = #Season 10 (2025)\n| episodes10   =\n| start10      =\n| end10        =\n}}\nEpisodes\nSeason 1 (2020)\n|ShortSummary    = Phil and Jess travel to Point Pleasant, West Virginia in search of Mothman.\n|LineColor       = 33DD77\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = Phil and Jess investigate the tek tek, a Cambodian Bigfoot-like creature.\n|LineColor       = 33DD77\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = The team visits the infamous Island of the Dolls in Mexico City.\n|LineColor       = 33DD77\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = The team searches for ghostly phenomena at Mammoth Cave National Park.\n|LineColor       = 33DD77\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = The team visits the site of the Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting.\n|LineColor       = 33DD77\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = The Expedition X team heads up the Rio Negro river in the Amazon to investigate a haunted outpost.\n|LineColor       = 33DD77\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = The team dives into Lake Lanier, the so-called \"world's most haunted lake.\"\n|LineColor       = 33DD77\n}}\n}}\nSeason 2 (2020)\n|ShortSummary    = Phil and Jess investigate tales of curses and ghosts in Nevada City, Montana.\n|LineColor       = 77DD99\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = The team examines reports of cattle mutilations in the Pacific Northwest.\n|LineColor       = 77DD99\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = Phil and Jess delve into the legend of the Bell Witch in Tennessee.\n|LineColor       = 77DD99\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = The team investigates the mystery of the Light of Saratoga in the Big Thicket of Texas.\n|LineColor       = 77DD99\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = The X team heads to New Jersey to search for the Jersey Devil.\n|LineColor       = 77DD99\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = The team dives into Lake Champlain looking for the legendary Champ.\n|LineColor       = 77DD99\n}}\n}}\nSeason 3 (2021)\n|ShortSummary    = Josh Gates joins Jess and Phil in the field as they search for the Beast of Bray Road.\n|LineColor       = 77DDDD\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = Josh and the team continue their search for a legendary werewolf in rural Wisconsin.\n|LineColor       = 77DDDD\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = Phil and Jess head to Socorro, New Mexico the site of the Lonnie Zamora incident.\n|LineColor       = 77DDDD\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = The team investigates legends of hauntings on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal.\n|LineColor       = 77DDDD\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = Phil and Jess travel to Ape Canyon at Mount St. Helens in search of Bigfoot.\n|LineColor       = 77DDDD\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = The Expedition X team dive into the waters off Catalina Island to investigate unidentified objects as seen in the Pentagon UFO videos.\n|LineColor       = 77DDDD\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = The team are joined by Luis Elizondo as they continue to search the waters off Catalina, where they witness unexplained lights.\n|LineColor       = 77DDDD\n}}\n}}\nSeason 4 (2021)\n|ShortSummary    = Hikers are going missing amid reports of grotesque, human-like creatures prowling Appalachia's great smoky mountains.
