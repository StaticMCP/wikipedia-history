The government army carelessly besieged the fort (with no guards appointed), and the sudden sally of Lisovsky's men from the Zaraisk Kremlin scattered them with little resistance.\nAftermath\nAfter the victory at Zaraisk, Lisovskiy swiftly captured Kolomna, where he captured many heavy guns. The remnants of former Bolotnikovites strengthened the army. However, the detachment of Lisovsky, heavily burdened by the convoy, was defeated by the Tsar's army at Medvezhiy Brod.\nReferences"
