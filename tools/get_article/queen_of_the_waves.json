      "text": "# Queen of the Waves\n\nQueen of the Waves is a French Marian hymn (author unknown) sung by French fishermen seeking protection from storms.\nIn the United States, it became well known as a result of the Galveston Hurricane of 1900. The nuns of the St. Mary's Orphan asylum had the orphans sing this song (in English) in order to calm them. Of the 93 children and 10 sisters in the orphanage, only three teenage boys survived.\nAs a result of this event, the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word across the world sing this song every year on 8 September, and remember the sisters and orphans that died that day.\nThe Sisters of Charity recorded an audio CD titled Queen of the Waves: Centennial Remembrance of The Great Storm of 1900 available for purchase or free download.\nLyrics\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.1900storm.com/queenofwaves/ Story of the Orphanage]  told by the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word"
