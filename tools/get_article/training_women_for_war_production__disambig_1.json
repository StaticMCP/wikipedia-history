Whereas the NYA used to provide programs for youth, now it was concentrating on training young girls for war work. Then various scenes are shown explaining women's roles in various capacities, first focusing on traditionally feminine areas such as sewing parachutes and uniforms, nursing, and clerical work. However the latter part of the film increasingly shows the industrial side of war production, particularly the manufacturing of ammunition and weapons.\nAfrican-American women's efforts are highlighted in the film. Mrs. Roosevelt, an early champion of Civil Rights, noting that \"Negro girls have an important role in war work.\"\nSee also\n*List of Allied Propaganda Films of World War 2\nExternal links\n*[https://archive.org/details/TrainingWome Complete film at archive.org]"
