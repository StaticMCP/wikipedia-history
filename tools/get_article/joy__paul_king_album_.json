      "text": "# Joy (Paul King album)\n\nJoy is the only solo album by British singer Paul King, released in 1987, on CBS after King, the band he was lead singer for split up in 1986.\nThe album was produced by American musician Dan Hartman. It failed to chart, and only produced a minor hit out of two single releases: \"I Know\", which stalled at number 59, and \"Follow My Heart\", which failed to chart in the UK top 75.\nOverview\nThe album was more pop rock-oriented than the more new wave-sounding albums by the King group. The album contains extensive use of brass (being especially evident in the first single \"I Know\"), played by The Uptown Horns quartet, as well as background vocals, recorded in two separate sessions, one held in Detroit and the other in New York. The singer Nona Hendryx features on backing vocals on track \"Slow Motion\".\nThe song \"Star\" was co-written by Paul along with ex colleague Mike Roberts, keyboard player in the King band. Perry Haines' management and The Unity Club fan club were also unchanged.\nTrack listing\n#\"Follow My Heart\" - 4:43 (P. King/D. Hartman)\n#\"When You Smile\" - 4:24 (P. King/D.
