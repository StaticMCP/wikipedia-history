It was the follow-up to A Hard Road, also released in 1967. As with their two previous albums, Crusade was produced by Mike Vernon. The album was the first recordings of the then-18-year-old guitarist Mick Taylor.\nTrack listing\nOriginal release\nAll songs by John Mayall except as noted.\n\" (Ron Badger, Sheldon Feinberg, Robert Geddins) – 5:15\n|\"Snowy Wood\" (instrumental) (Mayall, Mick Taylor) – 3:41\n|\"Man of Stone\" (Eddie Kirkland) – 2:29\n|\"Tears in My Eyes\" – 4:20\n|\"Driving Sideways\" (instrumental) (Freddie King, Sonny Thompson) – 4:03\n|\"The Death of J.
