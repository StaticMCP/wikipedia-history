When available the house would be constructed of fieldstone such as the Abraham Manee House on Staten Island. The wood for the joists and rafters were trimmed with an adze from trees felled on or near the property.\nThe ceiling and interior walls when constructed after the initial construction were usually framed then plastered with clay from local deposits, mixed with horse hair for strength, over rough trimmed wood laths.\nCommon characteristics of Dutch colonial architecture are they typically, but not always, had Gambrel roofs with flared eaves, Dutch doors and brick chimneys built at the gable ends.\nFile:Schenk-crooke-house2.jpg|Jans Martense Schenck house\nFile:Maneeseguine5.jpg|Abraham Manee House\nFile:Van pelt manor house brooklyn.jpg|Van Pelt Manor house\nFile:C.1737 Luykas Van Alen House, Kinderhook, New York.jpg|alt=c.1737 Luykas Van Alen House|c.1737 Luykas Van Alen House, Kinderhook.\nFile:Hubbard House 1830.jpg|Hubbard House, Brooklyn c. 1830 photograph 1915\nFile:Vander Ende Onderdonk back jeh.jpg|Vander Ende-Onderdonk House\nFile:Wyckoff House.jpg|Pieter Claesen Wyckoff House (c. 1652)\nReferences"
