It is situated on Rua Serpa Pinto, at the south end of Plateau, the historic district of Praia. It was constructed around 1894 in neoclassical style as a residence of the Portuguese governor of Cape Verde. After Cape Verde gained independence in 1975, it became the presidential palace.\nSee also\n*List of buildings and structures in Santiago, Cape Verde\nReferences"
