Poet Randall Swingler wrote the lyrics.\nMusic\nThe piece begins with text evoking the fascist menace, with a minor key and staccato. The call to advance democracy is underlined by a bright C major.\nReferences\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2LiXo1It-E S:t Jacobs Ungdomskör - Benjamin Britten: Advance Democracy]"
