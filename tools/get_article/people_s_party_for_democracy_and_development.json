At its foundation, it served as the main opposition party in both houses of the Barbadian Parliament, with one seat in the House of Assembly and two seats in the Senate from 8 June 2019 till 19 January 2022.\nBackground\nThe initial grouping emerged shortly after the 2018 general elections, where the Barbados Labour Party (BLP) defeated the ruling Democratic Labour Party (DLP) to win all 30 seats in the House of Assembly.  This result left vacant the position of Leader of the Opposition and the two seats held by the second largest party in the Senate.  On 31 May 2018, Joseph Atherley, who had been elected for St. Michael West, announced that he would be leaving the party to become Leader of the Opposition, which enabled him to advise on the appointment of the two minority Senators.  He rejected suggestions of joining the DLP, and decided to proceed as an independent.\nOn 8 June 2019, Atherley publicly launched an opposition party, the People's Party for Democracy and Development (PdP).  With the slogan \"God, Growth, and Peace\", the party would be social democratic in orientation.  Atherley revealed that the PdP had been initially founded on 1 November 2018.\nAs of the party's foundation, Atherley was the only PdP member of the House of Assembly, which automatically made him Leader of the Opposition. Crystal Drakes and Caswell Franklyn represent the party in the Senate.\nOn 27 December 2021, Prime Minister of Barbados Mia Mottley dissolved parliament and called elections for 19 January 2022. The next week, on the 31 December 2021, Atherley  and Lynette Eastmond of the United Progressive Party announced an electoral alliance between their two parties to contest the 2022 general elections as the Alliance Party for Progress. It is headed by Atherley with Eastmond becoming deputy head.\nAfter the 2022 general elections, the party lost its sole seat in the House of Assembly and was reduced from being the main opposition party to being extra-parliamentary.\nElectoral history\nFor 2022 Barbadian general election, the PdP formed an electoral alliance with the United Progressive Party (Barbados) (UPP) and formed the Alliance Party for Progress and ran under that banner.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |Election\n! colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"2\" |Electoral Alliance\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Leader\n! colspan=\"2\" |Votes\n! colspan=\"2\" |Seats\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Position\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Government\n|-\n!
