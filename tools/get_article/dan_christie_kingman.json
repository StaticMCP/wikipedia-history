His father was John William Kingman (1821–1903), and his mother was Mary Spaulding Christie (1825-\n1866). His 7th great-grandparents were\nMayflower passengers John Howland and Elizabeth Tilley, and his 5th great-grandfather was Mayflower passenger Resolved White.\nHe was married to Eugenia Jennings (1852-\n1930), with whom he had four sons: Dan Christie Kingman Jr. (1879–1918), Colonel Ralph Willcox Kingman (1880–1950), Brigadier General John Jennings Kingman (1882–1948), and Lieutenant Frederick Eustis Kingman (1888–1915).\nMilitary career\nEntering the United States Military Academy, Kingman graduated second in the class of 1875 and was commissioned in the Corps of Engineers.  He served as an instructor at the Military Academy and as the engineer officer of the Army's Department of the Platte based at Fort Omaha. In 1883, he began the construction of roads and bridges in the new Yellowstone National Park. Kingman Pass on the Grand Loop Road between Mammoth Hot Springs and Norris is named for him.\nKingman directed improvements along the lower Mississippi River in 1886-90 and received the thanks of the Louisiana legislature for \"splendid service rendered\" during the 1890 flood. He oversaw harbor and fortification work on Lake Ontario in 1891-95 and improvements on the Tennessee River in the last half of that decade. In the latter assignment he initiated planning for federal cost-sharing with private hydroelectric-power investors for a lock and dam built below Chattanooga. Kingman oversaw substantial harbor improvements at Cleveland in 1901-05 and headed the Corps' Savannah District and Southeast Division in 1906–13. The Panama Canal was completed while he was Chief of Engineers. He retired from the army on March 6, 1916.\nLater life\nKingman died November 14, 1916, in Atlantic City, New Jersey. He was buried with high military honors in Arlington National Cemetery. Among the pallbearers were Chief of Staff General Hugh L. Scott and two former Chiefs of Engineers, Generals Mackenzie and Bixby.\nSee also\n* Kingman Pass\n* North Entrance Road Historic District\n* Kingman Island\n* Kingman Park\n* Kingman Lake\n* Battery Kingman\nNotes\nThis article contains public domain text from\nFurther reading\n*"
