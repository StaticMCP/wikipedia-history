The Chilean brigade arrived without fighting at the point where the rest of the landed army was waiting in Lurín and Curayaco, leaving the troops from Sevilla in the rear. Sevilla, who knew about the new landing in Lurín, thought that this wouldn't have occupied the interior, so he continued his journey relatively close to the coast and without outposts observing the road. He also sent a notice to Lima announcing his return and the itinerary he hoped to follow.\nThe Battle\nThe courier with the news was taken prisoner and with this information, Orozimbo Barbosa, head of the second brigade of the second division, prepared a trap for Sevilla and his cavalry.\nBarbosa arranged the , the , the  and the  in a staggered manner around the road that Sevilla had announced to Lima, taking advantage of the incompetence to avoid friendly fire\nThe unequal combat began on the night of December 27 and continued sporadically until dawn. On the next and subsequent day, a search and pursuit began for the horsemen who were able to escape.\nThe Capture\nEmilio Sotomayor Baeza, head of the II Division, was informed about the capture of the commander of the Rimac regiment, Colonel Sevilla , 9 officers, 1 surgeon, 1 intern, 1 telegraph operator and 120 troops. Barbosa also reported the capture of 100 Remington carbines, spears, sabers and 120 horses, and as a complement, more than 1000 animals including cattle, sheep and goats. Among the war material was also the telegraph apparatus, the instruments of his music band, the regiment's documentation and important private and official communications.\nThe Chileans had 5 casualties: 1 dead (José Olano) and 4 wounded. Peruvian casualties are not known.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n* [http://gdp1879.blogspot.de/2013/12/barbosa-sobre-el-manzano.html Parte de Orozimbo Barbosa sobre el Manzano]"
