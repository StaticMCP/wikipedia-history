It used the \"Winner takes most\" system of allocating delegates. This system states that a candidate must receive 15% of the vote to receive any delegates statewide or by congressional district, but only if the winner gets less than 50% of the aggregate vote. Should they do so, it becomes winner-take-all.\nResults\nThe following candidates are on the ballot.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"4\" |2020 Arkansas Republican presidential primary\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Candidate\n! colspan=\"2\" |Popular vote\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Delegates\n|-\n!Count\n!Percentage\n|- align=\"right\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|  Donald Trump\n|238,980\n|97.13%\n|40\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Bill Weld\n|5,216\n|2.12%\n|0\n|-  style=\"text-align:right;\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Rocky De La Fuente\n|1,848\n|0.75%\n|0\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|Total\n|246,044\n|100%\n|40\n|}\nSee also\n* 2020 Arkansas Democratic presidential primary\nReferences"
