The resort catered primarily to people interested in the curative powers of the mineral waters. Guests were accommodated in cabins or tents. At one time it had an official post office. The resort changed hands many times over the years, with various changes to the lodge, accommodations and bathhouses, until closing in 1970. For a period it was leased for geothermal exploration. Today it has reopened as a health resort.\nLocation\nHoward Springs is located  north-northeast of Whispering Pines.\nThey are  southwest of Lower Lake and  northwest of Middletown.\nIt is at an elevation of 2165 feet (660 m).\nSprings\nThe springs are in a line about  long at the foot of a slope along the south side of a drainage course.\nThey are on the edge of a small basin, surrounded by rolling hills.\nThere are about 40 separate flows, with temperatures that range from .\nThe springs all rise in an area of serpentinite within the shales and sandstones of which the hills in the vicinity are composed.\nAs of 1909 about 26 springs had been dug out and cemented to form drinking basins.\nThe most important for drinking, with their temperatures, were: Bohemia, ; Neptune, ; Lithia,  and Magnesia Twins, .\nBohemia discharged about  per minute.\nThe three largest springs were mainly used for bathing.\nHot Soda or Hot Sulphur Spring had a temperature of  and discharged about  per minute into a plunge bath.\nExcelsior or Borax Spring had a temperature of  and discharged about  per minute into a plunge bath.\nEureka Spring had a temperature of  and was piped to tub baths.\nHistory\nThe first settler at what became Howard Springs seems to have been J.M. Collins, who arrived in 1863 and stayed for a year.\nJames W. Howard bought the Cushman Farm in Seigler valley on 4 December 1869, excluding the springs.\nHe later acquired the springs, which are shown as \"Howard's Springs\" on an 1875 map, and published his first advertisement for Howard Springs on 13 March 1876.\nIn 1877 C.W. Howard opened the springs to the public.\nHe provided camping space and built a lodge, cabins and bathing pools.\nEarly in 1878 Howard sold the springs resort to August Heisch.\nHeisch had died by August 1882, and his widow Caroline Heisch became owner.\nIn October 1887 she sold the resort to Philip and Margaretha Sieben.\nOn 30 April 1891 Charles Louis Adolph Scott bought the property.\nIn 1892 it became home to the Putah Post Office and Scott was appointed postmaster.\nMrs. R.J. Beeby bought the resort in 1896, and took over as postmaster.\nAt this time there was an L-shaped lodge and a 2-story annex.\nThe post office closed in 1900.\nThere is a gap in the ownership records, but on 29 October 1907 Minnie W. and Edgar E. Laymance sold the resort to the Howard Springs Company, partly owned by the Laymance fsmily.\nThe resort by 1909 had a stable, two large lodge buildings, cabins, tent platforms and bathhouses.\nSale of bottled water from Lithia, Bohemia and Eureka springs had been discontinued some years before 1909.\nIn 1909 there was a hotel building with a large annex, the baths and four or five small cottages.\nAs of 1914 only 14 springs were in active use.\nThey were owned by W.J. Laymance of Oakland and leased by R.J. Yates.\nThere were accommodations for 80, mostly in cottages.\nWater from the Hot Iron & Sulphur spring was fed to the bath house.\nOn 11 May 1921 Harold W. Jewett bought the resort.\nBy 1926 Jesse P. Francisco was the owner, and ran it with his wife Cora.\nIn November 1929 the lodge and other buildings burned down, apart from two cabins and two bathhouses.\nThe Franciscos built a large new 2-story lodge in a new location, and several small cabins.\nThe pools and bathhouses were rebuilt in concrete.\nFrancisco sold the resort to the Pappas brothers in October 1945.\nThey made various renovations and additions to the buildings, and by 1948 had 64 cabin units, some in multi-unit buildings.\nThey ran the resort until after the 1970 season, when it was finally closed.\nFrom 1975 to 1983 Republic Geothermal had leases for exploration on , including Howard Springs.\nThey made two  test wells on the property.\nToday the property is called Avalon Springs.\nIt is described as an \"experiential learning environment, anchored by a healing hot springs retreat center and eco-village.\"\nReferences\nReference bibliography\n* }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
