The album, described by Chris Rizik of SoulTracks as \"a critical favorite\", charted at number 34 on the Billboard Top Black Albums chart. In his review of the album, music critic Robert Christgau praised husband Cecil Womack and wife Linda Womack as \"[a]ce singers and songwriters (as opposed to singer-songwriters)\", noting that \"their lyrics about loss and conflict are sharper than those about love and happiness\".\nTwo singles from the album, \"Love Wars\" and \"Baby I'm Scared of You\", were hits in the UK, reaching number 14 and number 72 on the UK Singles Chart, respectively. The album was ranked number 4 among the \"Albums of the Year\" for 1984 by NME, and the single \"Love Wars\" was ranked as the year's number 1 song.\nTrack listing\nExcept where otherwise noted, all tracks by Cecil Womack and Linda Womack.\n#\"Love Wars\" – 5:58\n#\"Express Myself\" – 4:52\n#\"Baby I'm Scared of You\" (Eddie Noble, Jr., C.
