Providing a comparison of American and British politics and society, Freedland offers an argument for the introduction of Republicanism in Britain. The book was awarded the Somerset Maugham Award in 1999.\nSynopsis\nJournalist and broadcaster Jonathan Freedland takes a meandering tour through the stubbornly varied states and regions of the United States meeting people of all racial and cultural persuasions and of all religious and political beliefs in his effort to build an accurate picture of modern American society and the ways in which these people can and often do affect the way politics is carried out in their country, both locally and nationally. From these encounters Freedland learns the values of a republican government and how these values can be brought back across the Atlantic to Britain and benefit the very people who first created many elements of this republican ideology.\nReferences"
