He played college football for the Hampton Pirates.\nWhile Warren played football at John F. Kennedy High School in Suffolk, Virginia, he became better known as a sprinter. In 1988, as a high school senior, Warren anchored the United States 400 meter relay team to a gold medal in the IAAF World Junior Track and Field Championships in Sudbury, Ontario. He played both sports at Hampton University, where he set several sprinting records and was a two-time NCAA Division II national champion in the 200 meter dash. He was selected by the Seattle Seahawks in the fifth round of the 1993 NFL draft. After two years in Seattle, he played briefly for the San Francisco 49ers. After his stint in San Francisco, he signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars, though he never played for the team due to injury. Warren was inducted into the Hampton University Athletics Hall of Fame on January 14, 2011, and the Central Intercollegiate Athletic (CIAA) Hall of Fame on February 27, 2015.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.nfl.com/players/terrencewarren/profile?id=WAR716423 NFL player profile]\n*[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WarrTe20.htm Pro Football Reference profile]"
