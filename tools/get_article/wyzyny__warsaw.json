It was designed by Jacek Jan Nowicki.\nIn 1990, the neighbourhood had a population of thirteen thousand people.\nSince 1994, in the neighbourhood operates the Wyżyny Housing Association (Polish: Spółdzielnia Mieszkaniowa „Wyżyny”), which had splintered from the Natolin House Constitution Association (Polish: Spółdzielnia Budownictwa Mieszkaniowego „Natolin”).\nBetween 1993 and 2003, at 21  Stryjeńskich Street, was constructed the Catholic Church of the Presentation of Jesus.\nIn 2016, to the south from Pileckiego Street was opened the Silent Unseen Park.\nCharacteristics\nThe neighbourhood is located in the district of Ursynów, within the City Information System area of Natolin.
