He was the son of John P. Breen, manager of the Phillips House.\nBreen attended Corpus Christi Grammar School and earned his bachelor's degree from the University of Dayton. After attending Ohio State University, Breen returned to Dayton to work in the hotel business, where he ran the Hilton Biltmore Hotel and later the Van Cleve Hotel.\nDuring the Second World War, Breen, a Roman Catholic by faith, served as a Major (United States) in the United States Army Air Forces. He saw active duty in North Africa and in Italy. He was released from active duty and awarded the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Infantry Reserve.\nIn 1945, Breen was elected to the Board of Commissioners of Dayton, Ohio. His fellow commissioners elected him mayor.\nIn 1948, Breen resigned his seat on the city commission in order to seek the Democratic nomination for a seat in the United States House of Representatives. In that election, Breen successfully unseated Republican incumbent Raymond H. Burke. In 1950, Breen won re-election to the House, defeating Republican challenger Paul F. Schenck. However, ill health prompted Breen to resign from his seat early, on October 1, 1951. His old opponent Schenck was elected in a special election in 1951 to complete his term.\nReturning to Dayton, Breen worked in the real estate and insurance industries. A few years later, he re-entered politics, running successfully for a seat on the Board of Commissioners of Montgomery County, Ohio, serving in that capacity from 1955 to 1960.\nIn 1956 he married Constance Focke and they had two children.  Edward Grimes Breen is buried at Calvary Cemetery in Dayton. His son has written a book about his father called \"Lucky Eddie\". http://www.thelocalhistorycompany.com/books/9780977042982/pages/9780977042982.html\nSee also\n*Ohio's 3rd congressional district\nReferences\nRetrieved on 2008-03-19\n* Flynn, Adrianne. “Ex-Mayor Edward Breen, 82, Dies; Served As U.S. Rep, County Commission President.” Dayton Daily News, May 9, 1991, page 3A.\nExternal links\n*[http://www.libraries.wright.edu/special/collection_guides/guide_files/ms409.pdf Congressman Edward G.
