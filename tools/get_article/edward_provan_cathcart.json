He is also remembered as Chairman of the Scottish Health Board Committee 1933-1936. The Cathcart Committee (named after him) was critical to the Scottish input to the foundation of the National Health Service after World War II. His obituary described his as a \"life well spent in the service of mankind\".\nLife\nHe was born in Ayr on 18 July 1877, the son of Margaret Miller, from a family of rivet and bolt manufacturers, and Edward Moore Cathcart, a merchant in the town.

In 1917 he was transferred to the same role in relation to the Home Services.
