When ignited in a cylindrical tube, the reaction produces a bright flash and a loud \"woof\" - reminiscent of a barking dog.\nIn simple terms, the 'Barking Dog' reaction is a combustion process, in which a fuel (carbon disulfide, CS2) reacts with an oxidizing agent (nitrous oxide, N2O), producing heat and elemental sulfur.  The flame front in the reaction is a zone of very hot, luminous gas, produced by the reactants decomposing.\n:8 N2O + 4 CS2 → S8 + 4 CO2 + 8 N2\nIn April 1853, Justus von Liebig performed the demonstration in front of the Bavarian royal family; however, the glass container shattered, and shards of glass inflicted minor injuries on the faces of Queen Therese, her son Prince Luitpold, and Liebig himself.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3fJRRCAIdk Barking Dog (slow motion) - Periodic Table of Videos, University of Nottingham]\n* [http://www.chem.leeds.ac.uk/delights/texts/expt_22.html University of Leeds Barking Dog site]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJOzQFXT54M   Elementary Productions: Small scale Barking Dog reaction @  youtube]\n* [http://chemistry.about.com/od/chemistrydemonstrations/a/barkingdog.htm  Barking Dog Reaction How to Do the Barking Dog Chemistry Demonstration]"
