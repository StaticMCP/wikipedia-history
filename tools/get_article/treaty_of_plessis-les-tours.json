Based on the terms of the treaty, François assumed the title of \"Protector of the Liberty of the Netherlands\" and became sovereign of the Dutch Republic. The accord was ratified at Bordeaux on 23 January 1581.\nWhen François attempted to take Antwerp in the French Fury on 17 January 1583, the citizens massacred his army.  He withdrew from the Low Countries in June and died of malaria the following year.\nSee also\n*List of treaties\nExternal links\n*[http://www.bookrags.com/ebooks/4833/1.html The Rise of the Dutch Republic - John Lothrop Motley]"
