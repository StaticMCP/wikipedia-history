It is an alternative term for prime minister, premier, chief minister, or first minister and very similar to the title of president of the council of ministers.\nTerminology\nIn English-speaking countries, similar institutions may be called premiers or first ministers (typically at the subnational level) or prime ministers (typically at the national level). The plural is sometimes formed by adding an s to minister and sometimes by adding an s to president.\nThe term is used, for instance, as a translation (calque) of the German word .\nAustria\nFrom 1867 to 1918, the first minister of the government was known as  (minister-president), before that  (state chancellor). Today the head of the Austrian Federal Government is called the  (federal chancellor), while the head of a state government is called the  (literally 'state captain'), not . In the city-state of Vienna the head of the state government is called the  (Mayor and state captain).\nBelgium\nThe term minister-president (, , ) is also used in Belgium to describe the head of government of a Belgian region or linguistic community, but not the head of the Belgian federal government who is referred to as the prime minister (, , ).\nAccording to the Belgian constitution, the federal prime minister is appointed by the king, and approved by the federal parliament with a vote of confidence (in practice the king usually appoints the leader of the winning party as  to form a government). The federal ministers later swear an oath of allegiance to the king. The minister-presidents of the regions and linguistic communities are not appointed by the king, but are directly appointed by their respective parliament. Ministers of the regions and linguistic communities are not required to swear allegiance to the king but simply take an oath in their respective parliament.\nSee:\n* Minister-President of the Brussels-Capital Region\n* Minister-President of Flanders\n* Minister-President of the French Community\n* Minister-President of Wallonia\n* Minister-President of the German-speaking Community\nGermany\nA Minister President () is the head of government in 13 of the 16 States of Germany. Exceptions are the city-states of Berlin, Hamburg and  Bremen, where the head of government is called, respectively, the Governing Mayor (), First Mayor () and Mayor and President of the Senate (). On the federal level, the head of the federal government (with an effectively identical function as leader of the cabinet) is called the Chancellor or Federal Chancellor ( or ). The positions of Minister-president in the German states (during the monarchy days) were mostly established in response to the 1848 German revolutions. The Minister-President of Prussia usually served simultaneously as the Imperial Chancellor.\nHungary\nThe title of Hungary's head of government in Hungarian is  which literally translated means \"minister-president\". However, because \"prime minister\" or \"premier\" is the more usual title in a parliamentary system for a head of government in English-speaking nations,  is almost always translated as \"prime minister.\"\nLatvia\nThe Minister president is the head of government. \"Minister-President\" in the Constitution of Latvia of February 15, 1922, arose when the German term  (minister-president) was translated; the term  (literally 'president of ministers', in Latvian) was coined by the member of the Constitutional Assembly of Latvia, Latvian writer Kārlis Skalbe.\nNetherlands\nIn the Netherlands the prime minister is officially referred to as \"minister-president\", although the informal term \"premier\" is also frequently used. His responsibilities are defined in the constitution of 1848 as the  ('chair of the council of ministers'). The title of minister-president has been in use since 1945 and officially added to the constitution in 1983.\nNorway\nIn Norway, Vidkun Quisling, head of the collaborationist government from 1942 to 1945 during the German occupation in World War II, held the title of Minister-President ().\nRussian Republic\nDuring the short lived Russian Republic, the role of a Minister-President was established. Alexander Kerensky was chosen to lead the provisional government.\nNotes\nReferences"
