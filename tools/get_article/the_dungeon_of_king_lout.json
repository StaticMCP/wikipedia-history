David George reviewed The Dungeon of King Lout in The Space Gamer No. 53. George commented that \"As good as just about anything else on the market, The Dungeon of King Lout is fine if the GM doesn't mind fleshing out details and statistics.  As is, though, most GMs could do as well on their own without much more effort.  At [the price], it's not worth it.\"\nDave Nalle reviewed The Dungeon of King Lout for Different Worlds magazine and stated that \"This product is ridiculously overpriced, almost contentless, and an affront to my pride as a gamer. There is no reason why anyone would buy this. You can design your own random and unrealistic dungeon (if you want) in the same time it would take you to prepare The Dungeon of King Lout, and you would save [money].\"\nReferences"
