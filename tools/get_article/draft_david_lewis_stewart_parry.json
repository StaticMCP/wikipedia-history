He  began his professional life outside of academic science. After getting divorced he moved to china where he started to catalog his research into cosmology and later turned to theoretical research, developing his ideas independently, through a combination of cosmology, thermodynamics, and information theory.\nHis writing style blends mathematics with narrative, often describing physical law through rhythm, symmetry, and curvature.\nResearch and ideas\nThe Parry Cosmology Framework consolidates several connected theories. Those theories consist of Cosmology, Thermodynamics, 4th Dimensional Law,   :\nThe Universal Heartbeat Theory, The Parry Tensional Phase Collapse, and The Energy Feedback Controller (PEFC)\n* The Universal Heartbeat: Entropy, Symmetry, and the Rhythm of Cosmic Rebirth (2025)\n* The Fourth-Dimensional Curvature Law (2025, ResearchGate)\nSelected archives:\n* [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16948782 Parry Cosmology: Thermodynamic Curvature and PTPC Methods]\n* [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17274926 A Parameter–Minimal Fix for the Bounce Trigger]\n* [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17339451 The Fourth-Dimensional Curvature Law]\nApplications\nDavid Parry has also explored how theoretical curvature feedback appears in computation. Using an algorithm that is based on the PTPC,\nHe has developed prototype controllers that monitor energy flow in GPUs and CPUs, modeling the thermodynamic “heartbeat” of active systems, showing the heavier the load, the greater the control mimicking the results found with entropy based PTPC bounce.\nThese experiments among others are all documented in his technical papers and simulation datasets. all are freely available to check , test and expand on.\nReception\nAs of 2025, David Parry’s cosmological framework remains independent without institutional funding and independently published and has not undergone formal peer review as of yet.\nthere is interest within open-access research communities for its mathematical coherence and reproducible simulation codes.\nExternal links\n* [https://orcid.org/0009-0007-3700-9614 ORCID record]\n* [https://zenodo.org/records/16948782 Zenodo repository]\n* [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David-Parry-19 ResearchGate profile]\n* [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=David+Lewis+Stewart+Parry Amazon author page]\nReferences\nWhile not yet peer-reviewed within mainstream journals, the framework has been cited in open-access repositories for its unified approach."
