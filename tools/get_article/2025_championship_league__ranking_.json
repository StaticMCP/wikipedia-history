It was the sixth staging of the ranking edition of the tournament, which was first held in 2020. Organised by Matchroom Sport, it was the first ranking event of the 2025–26 snooker season, preceding the 2025 Saudi Arabia Snooker Masters. The winner received £33,000 from a total prize fund of £328,000.\nAli Carter was the defending champion, having defeated Jackson Page 31 in the final of the previous ranking edition, but he was eliminated in stage one. By topping her group in stage one, Ng On-yee became the first woman to reach the last 32 of a professional ranking event. Stephen Maguire won the tournament, beating Joe O'Connor 31 in the final to claim the seventh ranking title of his career and his first since winning the 2020 Tour Championship over five years earlier. Maguire's win secured him a place in the 2025 Champion of Champions tournament, while O'Connor's defeat meant that he had lost all three of the ranking finals he had played.\nThe event produced 109 century breaks (86 in stage one, 19 in stage two, and 4 in stage three), of which the highest was a maximum break by Fan Zhengyi in his stage one match against Xu Si. The second maximum of Fan's career, it was the first maximum of the season and the 218th official maximum in professional competition.\nFormat\nThe competition began with 32 rounds of group matches with each group consisting of four players. Two groups were played to a finish every day using a twotable setup in the arena. The groups were contested using a roundrobin format, with six matches played in each group. All matches in group play were played as bestoffour , with three points awarded for a win and one point for a draw. Group positions were determined by points scored, frame difference and then headtohead results between players who were tied. Places that were still tied were then determined by the highest  made in the group. If the highest break was also tied, the next highest break made by the players was used.\nThe 32 players that toppped the group tables qualified for the group winners' stage, consisting of eight groups of four players. The eight winners from the group winners' stage qualified for the two final groups, with the final taking place later on the same day. The winner received the Championship League title and a place in the 2025 Champion of Champions.\nParticipants\nNo player in the top eight of the world rankings entered the event. Only five top-16 players featured—Barry Hawkins, Zhang Anda, Shaun Murphy, Si Jiahui, and Chris Wakelin. Outside the top 16, Hossein Vafaei, Anthony McGill, Ishpreet Singh Chadha, Sunny Akani, and Ken Doherty also did not enter. Luca Brecel and Jimmy White entered but subsequently withdrew. The tournament featured 24 amateur players, not currently on the World Snooker Tour, indicated by (a) in the tables below.\nBroadcasters\nThe event was broadcast by Fox Sports in Australia; Nova in Czechia and Slovakia; Maincast in Ukraine; Rigour in China; Viaplay in Iceland, and the Netherlands; Viasat in Scandinavia; and by Matchroom's YouTube channels in all other territories.  DAZN was not announced as one of the broadcast partners, contrary to the previous editions.\nPrize fund\nThe breakdown of prize money for the tournament is shown below.\n*Stage one\n*Winner: £3,000\n*Runner-up: £2,000\n*Third place: £1,000\n*Fourth place: £0\n*Stage two\n*Winner: £4,000\n*Runner-up: £3,000\n*Third place: £2,000\n*Fourth place: £1,000\n*Stage three\n*Winner: £6,000\n*Runner-up: £4,000\n*Third place: £2,000\n*Fourth place: £1,000\n*Final\n*Winner: £20,000\n*Runner-up: £10,000\n* Tournament total: £328,000\nNote: The champion received a total of £33,000 (£3,000 + £4,000 + £6,000 + £20,000).\nStage one\nStage one consisted of 32 groups, each having four players. Numbers in parentheses after the players' names denote the players' seeding, and (a) indicates amateur players not on the main World Snooker Tour. Unlike other tournaments, where the defending champion is usually the top seed, the players were seeded according to their ranking, and the top 32 seeds were allocated to the 32 groups. One exception to this was Group 27, because Luca Brecel, seeded 27, withdrew.\nOrder of play\nOrder of play as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Date\n!
