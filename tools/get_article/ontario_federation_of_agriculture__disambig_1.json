In January 27, 1936, representatives of Ontario’s farm groups held a meeting at the Royal York Hotel in Toronto in response to the creation of the Canadian Chamber of Agriculture in 1935, later renamed the Canadian Federation of Agriculture. The new organization was created to establish a provincial brand, named the Ontario Agricultural Conference. The first chairman was Herbert H. Hannam.\nIn 1940, it changed its name to the Ontario Federation of Agriculture. In 1943, the United Farmers of Ontario dissolved and its remnants were absorbed by the OFA.\nSee also\n*United Farmers of Ontario\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ofa.on.ca/ Official site]"
