He took part in the Inchon Landing and recapture of Seoul in September 1950 and received Air Medal while engaged in observation flights over enemy held territory.\nOn November 27, 1950, Chinese launched massive offensive and sent 9th Army to infiltrate the northeastern part of North Korea. They surprised the X Corps units at the Chosin Reservoir area and quickly encircled 30,000 United Nations troops. The Chinese enriclement was later broken and U.N. forces retreated to the port city of Hungnam for evacuation. Colonel Forney was appointed Hungnam evacuation officer by General Almond and organized the withdrawal of over 100,000 servicemen – and their equipment, supplies, and vehicles – and evacuated over 100,000 North Korean refugees, the largest U.S. amphibious evacuation of civilians, under combat conditions, in American history.\nForney was decorated with second Legion of Merit for the organization of Hungnam evacuation and subsequently took part in the blockade of Wonsan.

In this capacity he served as U.S. Marine Corps advisor to the Republic of Korea Marine Corps. During this time, Forney helped establish the 1st Marine Division base in Pohang, for which the division named a road in his honor in 2010. Forney retired from the Marine Corps after 28 years of active service in June 1959 and was advanced to the rank of brigadier general for having been specially commended in combat. He also received Army Commendation Medal for his second tour of duty in Korea.\nVietnam War\nFollowing his retirement from the Marines, Forney assumed assignment as the Public Safety Advisor with the U.S. Operations Mission (USOM), Agency for International Development at the U.S. Embassy in Saigon, South Vietnam. While in this capacity, he had an opportunity to analyse the situation in the country and relationship between Vietnamese civilians and U.S. military. As a veteran of Haitian campaign, he used his own experiences and proposed that the United States operation in South Vietnam should not be tied in with the MAAG; but rather an effort to be linked with the Civil Guard, the Self-Defense Corps, and the local Militia in the village and boondock level. This would be similar to the Guardia effort in Nicaragua or the Gendarmerie operation in Haiti and Santo Domingo.\nForney met with then-Chief of Staff, Headquarters Marine Corps, Lieutenant general Wallace M. Greene in Saigon in February 1963 and discuss his conclusions with him. Unfortunately Forney's health began failing and he was diagnosed with the cancer.
