He coined the binomial name Fringilla thoracica. This species was traditionally placed in the genus Poospiza. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2014 found that the genus was polyphyletic. In the subsequent reorganisation the bay-chested warbling finch was moved to its own newly erected genus Castanozoster. The name combines the Ancient Greek καστανό meaning \"chestnut\" with ζωστήρ meaning \"belt\". The bay-chested warbling finch is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.xeno-canto.org/species/Poospiza-thoracica Xeno-canto: audio recordings of the bay-chested warbling finch]"
