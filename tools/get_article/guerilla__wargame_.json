The designer and rulebook cover artist are uncredited. Maplay went on to publish one more game in 1976, a Napoleonic wargame titled Salamanca, before it went out of business.\nReception\nIn Issue 23 of Moves (Oct-Nov 1975), Richard Berg commented, \"Of more than usual interest is Maplay's Guerrilla, another game published in England. A tactical-level game that seems to be more operational than anything, this simulation of the guerrilla warfare in Indonesia in the '60's is a great deal of fun with its surprise attacks, helicopters and canoes and unknown victory conditions.\"  Berg concluded, \"A gruelling game for both players, Guerrilla is the quintessential 'amateur' game: good, playable and flavorful, with that touch of individuality that is so often lacking from the larger companies.\"\nIn the 1977 book The Comprehensive Guide to Board Wargaming, game critic Charles Vasey complimented \"A large map and neat counters.\" He concluded, \"Great attention to detail, but supply rules [are] odd; movement uses a rather old-fashioned method.\"\nIn Issue 11 of Simulacrum, Joe Scolari noted the unusual and possibly unique setting, saying, \"Games like Guerilla are a breath of fresh air for wargamers tired of endlessly recycled topics like Gettysburg, D-Day and the Bulge.\" Scolari pointed out that in 1974, Guerillas small platoon-sized combats \"had few peers when published since there were only a handful of games at that time using squad level units.\" He admitted the components were not well-produced but thought the game was still good, saying, \"While Guerilla is rough around the edges (including some amateur production values), the design itself shows quite a bit of creativity. This is especially true in comparison to its squad level contemporaries. Even today it is possibly (albeit by default) the definitive tactical treatment of the conflict.\"\nReferences"
