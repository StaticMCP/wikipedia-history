Later, during the British Raj, it was the name in Anglo-Indian usage for a horse-soldier belonging to the cavalry troops of the native armies of British India and the feudal states. It is also used more specifically of a mounted orderly, escort or guard. It was also the rank held by ordinary cavalry troopers, equivalent to sepoy in the infantry — this rank has been inherited by the modern armies of India and Pakistan. The rank higher is Acting Lance Daffadar.\nHistory\nAn image from the Carnatic Wars features a Sowar armed with a musket.\nSowar has been used as the name of a line of wrist-watches by the Swiss West End Watch Co.\nSee also\n* Suvari\nReferences\n*\n, noting two officers who were \"killed by their own sowars\" in the Indian Rebellion of 1857.]]\nfr:Sepoy"
