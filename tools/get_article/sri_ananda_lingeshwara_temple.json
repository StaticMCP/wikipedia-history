In 2013 a Kala Bairaveshwara idol was installed in a cave towards east of the hill.\nSri Kaala Bairaveshwara Cave\nSource:\nThe Kaala Bairaveshwara is also known as Kshetra Paalaka that means the protector of the area. According to \" Shiva purana \" the devotees had to first devote the Kaala Bairaveshwara god before seeing the main God.\nThe idol was installed and modified by Sri Ananda Lingeshwara Kshetra Trust in the year 2009. The cave has a secret escape route to Nandi hills.\nTunnel to Nandi Hill\nA secret passage on the west is believed to have helped the kings to escape during unforeseen attacks on Nandi Hills, situated in present Chickaballapura district, before it comes under Chickkaballapura Talaq, Bangalore. The tunnel connects Ananda Giri to Nandi Hill, by 57&nbsp;km by road, and 49&nbsp;km by tunnel. Because of urbanization (construction) the link of the tunnel has been closed in between.\nOther temples surrounding the hill\n# Ganesha temple (1 towards west, 1 towards north)\n# Muneshwara Temple, towards north\n# Kaateramma devi temple, towards north east\n# Santoshi mata mandir (in Garasia colony)\n# Aadi shakthi Mandir (in Garasia colony)\n# Sri Vishnu Shakti (Lakshmi) Mandir (in Garasia colony)\n# Ayyappa temple towards east\n# Shanimahtma temple towards south east\n# Kalabairaveshwara temple towards east side of temple.\nMaha Shivaraatri\nMaha Shivratri is a Hindu festival celebrated every year in reverence of Lord Shiva.
