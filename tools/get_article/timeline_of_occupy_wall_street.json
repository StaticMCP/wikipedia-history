      "text": "# Timeline of Occupy Wall Street\n\nThe following is a timeline of Occupy Wall Street (OWS), a protest which began on September 17, 2011 on Wall Street, the financial district of New York City and included the occupation of Zuccotti Park, where protesters established a permanent encampment. The Occupy movement splintered after NYC Mayor Bloomberg had police raid the encampment in Zuccotti Park on November 15, 2011. The timeline here is limited to this particular protest during this approximate time-frame (e.g., September 17 to November 15, 2011).\nHowever, the chronology does encompass subsequent events if they are specific to both OWS and Zuccotti Park. After November 2011, various events and protests have continued at Zuccotti Park that claim to be associated with OWS. But permanent encampments, including extended protests and occupations of Zuccotti Park, are no longer permitted.\nChronology of events\n2011\nPre-Occupy Wall Street\n* June 9&nbsp;– Kalle Lasn from Adbusters (a Canadian anti-consumerist organization) registers the [http://www.OccupyWallStreet.org OccupyWallStreet.org] web address.\n* July 13&nbsp;– Adbusters makes the initial proposal for a peaceful demonstration to occupy Wall Street.\n* August 2&nbsp;– with the \"debt-ceiling deadline\" of midnight August 2 drawing near (see: United States debt-ceiling crisis), a group calling itself \"New Yorkers Against Budget Cuts\" chose August 2 to incorporate a \"General Assembly\" with another group holding a strategy session for OWS. The two groups join in a demonstration at the Charging Bull sculpture, which stands in Bowling Green park in Lower Manhattan, at 4:30&nbsp;p.m. Afterwards, these two groups \"gather[ed] into working groups to plan for the September 17 event\".\n* August 9&nbsp;– Dylan Ratigan criticizes US political-banking ties on MSNBC's The Dylan Ratigan Show.\n* August 14&nbsp;– Warren Buffett publishes the editorial \"Stop Coddling the Super Rich\" in the New York Times Op-Ed section.\n* August 23&nbsp;– The hacktivist group Anonymous encourages its followers to take part in the protest.\nSeptember 2011\n* September 3&nbsp;– Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich publishes a long opinion article in The New York Times claiming that the productivity gains in the last 30 years have gone mostly to the top fifth of earners.\n]]\n* September 17&nbsp;– The first day of the OWS gathering. An estimated 1,000 people attend on the first day. The original location for the protest was One Chase Manhattan Plaza, with Bowling Green Park (the site of the \"Charging Bull\") and Zuccotti Park as alternate choices. Police discovered this before the protest began and fenced off two locations; but they left Zuccotti Park, the group's third choice, open. Since the park was private property, police could not legally force protesters to leave without being requested to do so by the property owner. In the beginning, officers of the New York City Police Department (NYPD) prohibited protesters from erecting tents, citing loitering rules.\n* September 19&nbsp;– Keith Olbermann, of Current TV, becomes the first major journalist to focus on the protests.\n* September 20&nbsp;– Police arrest mask-wearing protesters, using a law which bans masked gatherings unless part of \"a masquerade party or like entertainment\".\n* September 21&nbsp;– The Colbert Report satirizes the protests and major newspapers including The Guardian and The New York Times begin reporting on the protests.\n* September 24&nbsp;– At least 80 arrests are made by the NYPD after protesters begin marching uptown, forcing the closure of several streets.\n* September 25&nbsp;– YouTube discloses that the group Anonymous uploads a video around 4:30&nbsp;pm on this day, threatening the NYPD: \"If we hear of brutality in the next 36 hours then we will take you down from the internet as you have taken the protesters[sic] voices from the airwaves.\"\n* September 26&nbsp;– The name of the police officer who maced some young women on September 24 is revealed as Anthony Bologna by Anonymous.

Later, Dr. Cornel West spoke at the park and opened the daily General Assembly.\n* September 28&nbsp;– The board of the local union of the Transport Workers Union of America (TWU Local-100) voted to support Occupy Wall Street. Police Commissioner Kelly publicly stated that the NYPD cannot bar protesters from Zuccotti Park since it is a privately owned public park and plaza that is required to stay open 24 hours a day.\n* September 30&nbsp;– More than 1,000 demonstrators, including representatives from various labor organizations, hold a peaceful march to the NYPD headquarters, a few blocks north of nearby New York City Hall, to protest what they said was a heavy-handed police response the previous week. No arrests are reported.\nOctober 2011\n* October 1&nbsp;– Protesters set out to march across the Brooklyn Bridge. The New York Times reported that more than 700 arrests were made. Some said the police had tricked protesters, allowing them onto the bridge, and even escorting them partway across. Jesse A. Myerson, a media coordinator for Occupy Wall Street said, \"The cops watched and did nothing, indeed, seemed to guide us onto the roadway.\" However, some statements by protesters supported descriptions of the event given by police: for example, one protester Tweeted that \"The police didn't lead us on to the bridge. They were backing the [expletive] up.\" A spokesman for the New York Police Department, Paul Browne, said that protesters were given multiple warnings to stay on the sidewalk and not block the street, and were arrested when they refused. By October 2, all but 20 of the arrestees had been released with citations for disorderly conduct and a New York City Criminal Court summons.\n* October 5&nbsp;– An estimated 5,000 to 15,000 demonstrators marching from lower Manhattan's Foley Square to Zuccotti Park. The march is mostly peaceful until after nightfall, when some demonstrators are arrested after 200 people storm barricades blocking them from Wall Street.\nof Rage Against the Machine on October 13, 2011]]\n* October 10&nbsp;– NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg states that so long as protesters operate under the law, they will not be arrested.

Big win!\"\n* October 13&nbsp;– Mayor Bloomberg told demonstrators they would need to clear Zuccotti Park for it to be cleaned.

City Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez is reported to have been arrested when he and a group of other protesters tried to push their way through a line of police officers who were trying to prevent additional protesters from entering the park. The official statement released by Mayor Bloomberg's office explained the purpose of the late-night eviction:\nThis action was taken at this time of day to reduce the risk of confrontation in the park, and to minimize disruption to the surrounding neighborhood...[Mayor Bloomberg] [has] become increasingly concerned – as had the park's owner, Brookfield Properties – that the occupation was coming to pose a health and fire safety hazard to the protestors and to the surrounding community.\nJournalists have been barred from entering immediate area of eviction since the raid began, and Mayor Bloomberg cited this as a way \"to protect members of the press,\" and \"to prevent a situation from getting worse\". A CBS press helicopter was not allowed into the airspace above the park, which has been interpreted as an effort to limit media coverage of the event. A judge has issued a temporary restraining order in favor of the protestors, requiring Mayor Bloomberg to show cause for eviction. Mayor Bloomberg is scheduled to address the court order at 11:30am ET. Occupy Wall Street's statement released in response to the eviction cited exercising their right to assemble and the need to create a \"civic space\" as essential to changing public discourse. The Mayor's Office released statement addressing the complaints of protesters, including the following:\n: Some media outlets report that in the process of clearing out the park, 5,554 books at The People's Library are taken by police and stored at a sanitation facility to be picked up later by protesters.\n:Other media sources report that 2800 books were destroyed by the police and that OWS eventually settled a lawsuit with the city, collecting $232K.\nwith an LRAD unit near the Brooklyn Bridge during the arrests on the evening of November 17]]\n* November 17 – More than 30,000 demonstrated in and around Zuccotti Park, Union Square, Foley Square, the Brooklyn Bridge, and other locations through the city.
