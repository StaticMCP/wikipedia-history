A Republican division from Saumur led by Antoine Joseph Santerre beat Royalist Vendeans at Doué-la-Fontaine on 15 September and at Vihiers on the 17th. However, on 18 September Santerre's division blundered into an ambush between Vihiers and Coron set by Louis Marie de Lescure and Dominique Piron. The Republican column was routed and lost all its artillery. A few days later, a flanking Republican division under Charles François Duhoux was beaten in the Battle of Pont-Barré. In mid-September the Republican Army of the Coasts of La Rochelle under Jean Antoine Rossignol advanced into the Vendée from the south and east at the same time as the Army of the Coasts of Brest and the Army of Mainz commanded by Jean Baptiste Camille Canclaux marched in from the west. In battles at Coron, Pont-Barré, Tiffauges, Montaigu and Saint-Fulgent, the Vendean rebels massed against and defeated each Republican invading column.\nReferences\n*\n*"
