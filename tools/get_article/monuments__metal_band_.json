The band has released four studio albums through Century Media Records: Gnosis (2012), The Amanuensis (2014), Phronesis (2018) and In Stasis (2022).\nHistory\nThe band was formed by Fellsilent guitarist John Browne and the Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza guitarist Josh Travis filling in for vocals in 2007. After the departure of vocalists Neema Askari and Greg Pope, the band signed with Century Media Records in 2012, announcing the addition of singer Matt Rose the same day. Their debut album, Gnosis, came out on 28 August 2012.\nThe band took part in the Euroblast European Tour with Jeff Loomis, Vildhjarta, and Stealing Axion. Another European tour with Born of Osiris and After the Burial and The HAARP Machine followed in early 2013. By March 2013, the band parted ways with vocalist Matt Rose. In July 2013, it was announced that former Periphery and Friend For a Foe, current Ever Forthright and The HAARP Machine vocalist Chris Barretto had joined the band.\nIn December 2013, the band announced via Facebook that they had completed their second album. The drums were recorded in Monnow Valley Studio, Wales with Romesh Dodangoda (Motörhead, Sylosis, Bring Me the Horizon), while the rest of the instruments were tracked DIY by Browne, and the vocals were done with Eyal Levi. In April 2014, it was formally announced that their new album, The Amanuensis, would be released on 23 June 2014.\nThe band played on the Red Bull Studios Live Stage at Download on Sunday 15 June 2014. In March and April 2015, they supported Australian band Karnivool on their UK and European headline tour. Drummer Mike Malyan left the band during August 2015 due to injuries on his back and shoulder and was replaced by Anup Sastry, the former Intervals drummer. They played at Hevy music festival later that month.\nOn 16 June 2016, Anup Sastry announced on his Facebook page that he was amicably leaving the band, although he returned in 2018 to record drums for the new album, Phronesis.\nIn support of the release of the new album, Monuments performed a 31-date tour of the United Kingdom and mainland Europe over October and November with main support from Vola. In January 2019 Monuments performed headline shows in New Zealand, then on the Australian multi-date music festival Progfest.\nOn 1 July 2019, Monuments announced that Chris Barretto had departed the band due to \"personal reasons.\" They also announced YouTuber Andy Cizek as their fill-in vocalist for the rest of the tour. On 11 October 2019, Monuments announced that Andy Cizek is now their official vocalist. Less than two months later, former drummer Mike Malyan rejoined the band.\nOn 12 July 2021, Monuments announced that guitarist Olly Steele had left the band to pursue other musical projects. In January 2022, Monuments' fourth album, In Stasis, was announced with a release date of April 15, 2022. In Stasis features Mick Gordon as co-producer, with Spencer Sotelo of Periphery and ex-vocalist Neema Askari as guests. On 31 January 2023, Monuments announced departure of the bassist Adam Swan to pursue his environmental efforts with Soil Ecology Agriculture. His spot was filled with Dutch bassist Werner Erkelens of Aviations.\nOn May 25, 2023, the band released the standalone single \"Nefarious\", as a promotion for Charles White's comic book series GodSlap, along with a music video featuring an animation based on the comics.\nOn April 16, 2024, it was announced Mike Malyan left Monuments for the second time, citing emotional health as the reason for departure.\nOn August 9, 2024, Monuments announced that guitarist John Browne would take a break due to the ankylosing spondylitis he was diagnosed with a few years earlier, and that the band would go on an indefinite hiatus, withdrawing from a planned US tour with Leprous and Fight the Fight.\nBand members\nCurrent members\n* John Browne&nbsp;– guitars (2007–2024)\n* Andy Cizek&nbsp;– vocals (2019–2024)\n* Werner Erkelens&nbsp;– bass (2023–2024; touring member 2022)\nFormer members\n* Josh Travis – vocals, guitars (2007–2010)\n* Neema Askari&nbsp;– vocals (2010–2011)\n* Greg Pope&nbsp;– vocals (2010–2011)\n* Matt Rose&nbsp;– vocals (2012–2013)\n* Anup Sastry&nbsp;– drums (2015–2016, 2018)\n* Daniel Lang&nbsp;– drums (2016–2018, 2018–2019)\n* Chris Barretto&nbsp;– vocals (2013–2019)\n* Olly Steele&nbsp;– guitars (2011–2021)\n* Adam Swan&nbsp;– bass (2010–2023)\n* Mike Malyan&nbsp;– drums (2010–2015, 2019–2024); samples (2014–2015, 2019–2024)\nTouring musicians\n* Jake Monson – guitars (2010)\n* Paul Ortiz – guitars (2010–2011)\n* Kaan Tasan&nbsp;– vocals (2010)\n* John Gillen&nbsp;– drums (2014)\n* Alex Rüdinger&nbsp;– drums (2014)\nTimeline\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nScaleMajor = increment:1 start:2007\nLegend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom\nLineData =\ncolor:black layer:back\nat:28/08/2012\nat:23/06/2014\nat:05/10/2018\nat:15/04/2022\nColors =\nid:Vocals  value:red     legend:Vocals\nid:Guitar  value:green   legend:Guitars\nid:Bass    value:blue    legend:Bass\nid:Drums   value:orange  legend:Drums\nid:Samps   value:purple  legend:Samples\nid:black   value:black   legend:Studio_album\nBarData =\nbar:josh    text:Josh Travis\nbar:neem    text:Neema Askari\nbar:greg    text:Greg Pope\nbar:matt    text:Matt Rose\nbar:chris   text:Chris Barretto\nbar:andy    text:Andy Cizek\nbar:john    text:John Browne\nbar:olly    text:Olly Steele\nbar:adam    text:Adam Swan\nbar:werner  text:Werner Erkelens\nbar:mike    text:Mike Malyan\nbar:anup    text:Anup Sastry\nbar:daniel  text:Daniel Lang\nPlotData =\nwidth:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(11,-4)\nbar:josh   from:01/01/2007 till:05/04/2010   color:Vocals\nbar:neem   from:05/04/2010 till:24/05/2011   color:Vocals\nbar:greg   from:05/04/2010 till:24/05/2011   color:Vocals\nbar:matt   from:01/01/2012 till:24/03/2013   color:Vocals\nbar:chris  from:27/06/2013 till:01/07/2019   color:Vocals\nbar:andy   from:11/10/2019 till:end          color:Vocals\nbar:john   from:01/01/2007 till:end          color:Guitar\nbar:josh   from:01/01/2007 till:05/04/2010   color:Guitar width:3\nbar:olly   from:01/01/2011 till:12/07/2021   color:Guitar\nbar:adam   from:05/04/2010 till:31/01/2023   color:Bass\nbar:werner from:31/01/2023 till:end          color:Bass\nbar:mike   from:05/04/2010 till:09/08/2015   color:Drums\nbar:mike   from:03/12/2019 till:16/04/2024          color:Drums\nbar:mike   from:01/04/2014 till:09/08/2015   color:Samps width:3\nbar:mike   from:03/12/2019 till:16/04/2024          color:Samps width:3\nbar:anup   from:09/08/2015 till:16/06/2016   color:Drums\nbar:anup   from:01/03/2018 till:10/11/2018   color:Drums\nbar:daniel from:16/06/2016 till:01/03/2018   color:Drums\nbar:daniel from:10/11/2018 till:03/12/2019   color:Drums\n}}\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n*Gnosis (2012, Century Media Records)\n*The Amanuensis (2014, Century Media Records)\n*Phronesis (2018, Century Media Records)\n*In Stasis (2022, Century Media Records)\nDemos\n*...And It Will End in Dissonance (2006)\n*We Are the Foundation (2010)\nSingles\n*\"Doxa\" (2012)\n*\"Degenerate\" (2012)\n*\"I, the Creator\" (2014)\n*\"Origin of Escape\" (2014)\n*\"The Alchemist\" (2014)\n*\"Atlas\" (2014)\n*\"A.W.O.L\" (2018)\n*\"Leviathan\" (2018)\n*\"Mirror Image\" (2018)\n*\"Animus\" (2020)\n*\"Deadnest\" (2021)\n*\"Lavos\" (2021)\n*\"Cardinal Red\" (2022)\n*\"False Providence\" (2022)\n*\"Nefarious\" (2023)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
