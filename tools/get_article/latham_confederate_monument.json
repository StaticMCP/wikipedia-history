Latham, desired that deceased veterans on both sides in Hopkinsville be buried together.   Latham was a millionaire in the cotton business, who fought for the Confederate States of America during the conflict.  However, most of the Union veterans had already been buried at the Fort Donelson National Cemetery, so instead the mass burial would involve only Confederate veterans, 101 in total, that were scattered at various burial locations.  Latham gave $14,000 to the city of Hopkinsville for the project.  The dedication of the monument and the accompanying graves was on May 19, 1887, with a book, The Story of a Monument, was published by Dennison & Brown in 1888 with notes about the monument and its dedication.  Latham would also donate $50,000 for the construction of turnpikes.[http://www.trailsrus.com/monuments/reg2/hopkinsville.html Civil War in Kentucky][https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00088LXLO Amazon.com: The story of a monument: Memorial of the unveiling of the monument to the unknown confederate dead, May 19, 1887, at Hopkinsville, Ky: S.
