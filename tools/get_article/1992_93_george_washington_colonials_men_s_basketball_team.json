The team was coached by Mike Jarvis and played their home games at the Charles E. Smith Athletic Center. The Colonials finished in a four-way tie for second place in the regular season conference standings. After being knocked out in the opening round of the A-10 tournament, GW received an at-large bid to the 1993 NCAA tournament as No. 12 seed in the West region. The Colonials made a run to the Sweet Sixteen by defeating No. 5 seed New Mexico and No. 13 seed Southern. The team was eliminated from the tournament by the famed Fab Five from Michigan, 72–64, to finish with a record of 21–9 (8–6 A-10).\nRoster\n)\n|asst_coach=\n*\n|roster_url=https://gwsports.com/sports/mens-basketball/schedule/1992-93\n|accessdate=\n}}\nSchedule and results\n|-\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular season\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = Boylan Gymnasium\n| site_cityst  = West Long Branch, New Jersey\n| gamename     =\n| score        = 76–54\n| overtime     =\n| attend       =\n| record       = 1–0\n}}\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = Edmunds Center\n| site_cityst  = DeLand, Florida\n| gamename     = Hatter Classic\n| score        = 87–66\n| overtime     =\n| attend       =\n| record       = 2–0\n}}\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = Edmunds Center\n| site_cityst  = DeLand, Florida\n| gamename     = Hatter Classic\n| score        = 65–45\n| overtime     =\n| attend       =\n| record       = 3–0\n}}\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = Charles E.
