Maloney (May 21, 1928 – August 19, 2016) was an American aviation historian based in Southern California.\nLife\nDuring World War II, he joined the Civil Air Patrol. He later attended UCLA before transferring to Claremont Men's College, where he graduated in 1952.\nMaloney began building model airplanes when he was 12 years old and by May 1953 he had a collection of over 200 of them.\nBy early 1961, he was chairman of the Pomona Exchange Club.\nHe assembled much of the collection of historic airframes displayed at the Planes of Fame Museum at Chino Airport, Chino, California.\nMaloney believed that today's scrap is tomorrow's history, and in 1946 began collecting odd airframes for a future museum.  His first item was reportedly a Mitsubishi J8M rocket-powered interceptor.\nMaloney opened his first aviation museum at Claremont, California, on January 12, 1957, and then moved to Ontario International Airport in Ontario, California, in the 1960s.  His collection included several military aircraft including a rare P-26 Peashooter, a P-51A, a Hanriot HD.1, a Heinkel He 162, the Northrop N9M flying wing testbed, the nose section of a B-36 Peacemaker bomber. It also includes the last B-17 Flying Fortress bomber in United States Air Force operation, the drone-director Piccadilly Lilly II (44-83684).  This B-17 starred in the ''12 O'Clock High'' television series from 1964 to 1966. Interactive displays included a vintage World War II gunnery training machine.\nIn 1969, Maloney was forced to move his collection from the Ontario Airport hangar, and chose its present location at Chino Airport.\nMaloney was inducted in the EAA Warbirds of America Hall of Fame in 2001.\nPersonal life\nMaloney married Alice Louise Bromley on 26 November 1949 and had four children. His daughter, Karen, married Steve Hinton. His son, Jim, was killed in the crash of a PT-22 on 21 May 1983. He died on 19 August 2016.\nReferences"
