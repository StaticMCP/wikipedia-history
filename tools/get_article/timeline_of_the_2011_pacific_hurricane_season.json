      "text": "# Timeline of the 2011 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 2011 Pacific hurricane season consisted of the events that occurred in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation over the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and east of the International Date Line. The official bounds of each Pacific hurricane season are dates that conventionally delineate the period each year during which tropical cyclones tend to form in the basin according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), beginning on May&nbsp;15 in the Eastern Pacific proper (east of 140°W) and June&nbsp;1 in the Central Pacific (140°W to the International Date Line), and ending on November&nbsp;30 in both areas. However, tropical cyclogenesis is possible at any time of year. The season generated eleven&nbsp;tropical storms, which is below the 1991–2020 average of fifteen. However, all but one became hurricanes and six further strengthened into major hurricanes, eclipsing the 1991–2020 averages of eight&nbsp;hurricanes and four&nbsp;major hurricanes. There were also two tropical depressions that remained below tropical storm status. The first system, Hurricane Adrian, formed on June&nbsp;7; the final, Hurricane Kenneth, was the latest in a calendar year to exist east of 140°W since 1983, dissipating on November&nbsp;25.\nSeveral tropical cyclones impacted land during the 2011 season. The deadliest was Tropical Depression , which was part of a large area of torrential rains over Central America in mid-October. Widespread and destructive flooding and mudslides occurred in southeastern Mexico and Guatemala; at least thirty-six&nbsp;fatalities were directly attributed to the tropical depression itself, with many more in Central America being blamed on the overall weather system.|group=\"nb\"}} On the same day that  made landfall, Hurricane Jova came ashore further to the west, in the Mexican state of Jalisco, at Category&nbsp;2 strength; high winds and heavy rains killed nine&nbsp;people and caused at least MX$3.164&nbsp;billion (US$254.3&nbsp;million) in losses.MX$885&nbsp;million (US$71.1&nbsp;million) in Jalisco; and CENAPREDMX$2.279&nbsp;billion (US$183.2&nbsp;million) in Colima.|group=\"nb\"}} Hurricane Beatriz in June claimed four&nbsp;lives when it passed a short distance off the Mexican state of Colima, producing strong winds and locally significant flooding on land. Hurricanes Adrian in early June, Dora in July, and Hilary in late September all threatened or brushed the Pacific coast of Mexico but only caused minor peripheral effects.\nPrior to 2015, two time zones were utilized in the Eastern Pacific basin: Pacific east of 140°W, and Hawaii−Aleutian from 140°W to the International Date Line. For convenience, each event is listed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) first, using the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight&nbsp;UTC), with the respective local time included in parentheses. Figures for maximum sustained winds and position estimates are rounded to the nearest five&nbsp;units (knots, miles, or kilometers) and averaged over one&nbsp;minute, following National Hurricane Center practice. Direct wind observations are rounded to the nearest whole number. Atmospheric pressures are listed to the nearest millibar and nearest hundredth of an inch of mercury. This timeline documents the formation of tropical cyclones as well as the strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It also includes information that was not released while the storm was active, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center is included.\nTimeline of events\nMay\nMay 15\n* The 2011 East Pacific hurricane season officially begins.\nJune\nJune 1\n* The 2011 Central Pacific hurricane season officially begins.\nJune 7\n|alt=A map of the path of a hurricane off the Pacific coast of Mexico, generally moving to the west-northwest throughout its duration]]\n*12:00&nbsp;UTC (5:00&nbsp;a.m. PDT) at A tropical depression develops from an area of low pressure about 370&nbsp;mi (595&nbsp;km) south of Acapulco, Guerrero.\nJune 8\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC (5:00&nbsp;p.m. PDT, June&nbsp;7) at The aforementioned tropical depression strengthens into Tropical Storm Adrian about 355&nbsp;mi (575&nbsp;km) south of Acapulco, Guerrero.\nJune 9\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC (5:00&nbsp;p.m. PDT, June&nbsp;8) at Tropical Storm Adrian strengthens into a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane about 270&nbsp;mi (435&nbsp;km) south-southwest of Acapulco, Guerrero.\n*12:00&nbsp;UTC (5:00&nbsp;a.m. PDT) at Hurricane Adrian strengthens to Category&nbsp;2 intensity about 310&nbsp;mi (500&nbsp;km) southwest of Acapulco, Guerrero.\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;a.m. PDT) at Hurricane Adrian strengthens to Category&nbsp;3 intensity about 350&nbsp;mi (565&nbsp;km) west-southwest of Acapulco, Guerrero, making it the first major hurricane of the season.\nJune 10\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC (5:00&nbsp;p.m. PDT, June&nbsp;9) at Hurricane Adrian strengthens to Category&nbsp;4 intensity about 395&nbsp;mi (640&nbsp;km) west-southwest of Acapulco, Guerrero; it simultaneously attains peak winds of 140&nbsp;mph (220&nbsp;km/h).\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;p.m. PDT, June&nbsp;9) at Hurricane Adrian attains a minimum barometric pressure of  about 445&nbsp;mi (715&nbsp;km) west-southwest of Acapulco, Guerrero.\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;a.m. PDT) at Hurricane Adrian weakens to Category&nbsp;3 intensity about 530&nbsp;mi (850&nbsp;km) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur.\nJune 11\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;p.m. PDT, June&nbsp;10) at Hurricane Adrian rapidly weakens to Category&nbsp;1 intensity, skipping Category&nbsp;2 status, about 500&nbsp;mi (805&nbsp;km) south of Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur.\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;a.m. PDT) at Hurricane Adrian weakens into a tropical storm about 530&nbsp;mi (850&nbsp;km) south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur.\nJune 12\n*12:00&nbsp;UTC (5:00&nbsp;a.m. PDT) at Tropical Storm Adrian degenerates into a post-tropical cyclone about 570&nbsp;mi (915&nbsp;km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur.\nJune 19\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;p.m. PDT, June&nbsp;18) at A tropical depression develops from an area of low pressure about 265&nbsp;mi (425&nbsp;km) south-southeast of Acapulco, Guerrero.\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;a.m. PDT) at The tropical depression strengthens into Tropical Storm Beatriz about 195&nbsp;mi (315&nbsp;km) south-southwest of Acapulco, Guerrero.\nJune 20\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;a.m. PDT) at Tropical Storm Beatriz strengthens into a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane about 190&nbsp;mi (305&nbsp;km) south-southeast of Manzanillo, Colima.\nJune 21\nsatellite image of Hurricane Beatriz making its closest approach to Mexico early on June&nbsp;21|alt=A photograph of a hurricane very close to the Pacific coast of Mexico.
