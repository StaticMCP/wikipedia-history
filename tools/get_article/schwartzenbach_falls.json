With an overall height of , it is the 4th tallest waterfall in Canada and the tallest in Canada outside of British Columbia.\nName origin\nThe Inuktitut name for the waterfall is Qulitasaniakvik, which means \"place to get caribou skins\". The name refers to the valley above the falls being a good place to hunt for caribou.\nStructure\nThe falls form from an unnamed stream that plummets  down the western wall of the Weasel River Valley. The initial drop leaps  over the edge of an inclined cliff and takes the form of a horsetail. This is followed by a series of four smaller cascades that descend an additional  before the cliff gives way to a collection of talus deposits.\nSee also\n*List of waterfalls\n*List of waterfalls of Canada\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://journeyscope.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_9881-1024x768.jpg View of the entirety of Schwartzenbach Falls, August 2016]"
