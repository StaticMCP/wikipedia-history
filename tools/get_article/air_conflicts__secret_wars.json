Alongside with her friends Tommy Carter and Clive, the players progress through the game. From Tobruk to Russia to the Balkans and finally to Berlin, Tommy and Clive both die while progressing. In the Berlin campaign, she finds out that one friend killed her father in WW1 because her father couldn't stand watching bombers drop chemical gas on a village.
