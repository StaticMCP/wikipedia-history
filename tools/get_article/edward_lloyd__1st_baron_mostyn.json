On 11 February 1794 he married Elizabeth, third daughter of Sir Roger Mostyn, 5th Baronet.\nHe was High Sheriff of Flintshire for 1796, High Sheriff of Caernarvonshire for 1797 and High Sheriff of Merionethshire for 1804. In 1806 he was elected to the House of Commons for Flint Boroughs, a seat he held until 1807 and again from 1812 to 1831 and also represented Beaumaris between 1807 and 1812. In 1831, after his wife had inherited the main estates of the unmarried Sir Thomas Mostyn, 6th Baronet, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Mostyn, of Mostyn in County Flint.\nHe lived at Pengwern, between Rhuddlan and St Asaph in Flintshire, in a house that had been built by his great uncle, Sir Edward Lloyd. A guide book to the area published in 1847 described him as  \"a genuine Welshman [who] speaks with fluency the language of his country\", adding that \"his lordship keeps two packs of hounds for the amusement of his friends and the neighbouring gentry; and though in the 78th year of his age, seldom misses mounting his scarlet, particularly if the hounds turn out within eight or ten miles of his mansion.\"\nIn 1840 a group of friends and admirers presented him with a portrait of himself, painted by Mary Martha Pearson.\nLord Mostyn died in April 1854, aged 85, and was succeeded in his titles by his son Edward.\nIssue\n1.
