It flows eastward from headwaters  at a small unnamed lake in the Taylor Mountains to its confluence with the larger river about  north of Nushagak Bay.\nThere are many rivers in Alaska bearing the name King Salmon River, including tributaries to the Egegik River and Ugashik River systems in southwest Alaska alone.  The name is also occasionally confused with that given the Kenai River, a popular fishing stream located in the Cook Inlet drainage of southcentral Alaska.\nBesides king salmon, the river is also hosts pink salmon, grayling, burbot, whitefish and Arctic char.\nSee also\n*List of rivers of Alaska\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090925021552/http://www.akfishingexpeditions.com/ Float fishing the King Salmon river.]"
