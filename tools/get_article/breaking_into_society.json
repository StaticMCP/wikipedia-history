Determined to achieve a position in society, they settle Pasadena and entertain there in a lavish scale. However, their manners and disposition to rush matters get them into various scrapes. The final touch comes when a boxer and his bride from Chatham Square, an old pal of Tim O'Toole from the Alley days, without waiting for an invitation, pays the family a visit. A lurid time results, as stories of former fights are related and profusely illustrated, and all table rules are ruthlessly smashed. Finally, the horrified guests make a hasty getaway.\nCast\nSee also\n* List of American films of 1923\n* Social mobility\n* List of lost films\n* Cinema of the United States\n* Satire (film and television)\nPreservation\nWith no prints of Breaking Into Society located in any film archives, it is considered a lost film.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Munden, Kenneth White.
