Soon after the performance, Brian May indicated to Rolling Stone that he was considering Lambert as a front-man for Queen. In November 2011, Adam Lambert joined Queen for a special performance at the MTV Europe Awards in Belfast. It was then reported in December 2011 that Taylor and May had begun discussions with Lambert for him to front Queen in concert.\nThe tour began in June 2012 at Kyiv's Independence Square, a joint show with Elton John in aid of the Elena Pinchuk ANTIAIDS Foundation. Following the Kyiv concert, the group was set to play a number of festival dates. The UK Sonisphere Festival was cancelled and Queen and Lambert instead performed three sold out concerts at London's Hammersmith Apollo to wrap up the tour.\nSetlist\n| content =\n# \"Flash\" (tape)\n# \"Seven Seas of Rhye\"\n# \"Keep Yourself Alive\"\n# \"We Will Rock You\" (Fast)\n# \"Fat Bottomed Girls\"\n# \"Don't Stop Me Now\"\n# \"Under Pressure\"\n# \"I Want It All\"\n# \"Who Wants to Live Forever\"\n# \"A Kind of Magic\"\n# \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\"\n# \"Life Is Real (Song for Lennon)\" (played once on 3 July)\n# \"You're My Best Friend\" (excerpt played acoustically on 14 July)\n# \"Love of My Life\"\n# \"'39\"\n# \"Dragon Attack\"\n# \"Drum Battle\"\n# \"Guitar Solo\"\n# \"Somebody to Love\" (played at every show including an excerpt played acoustically instead of normal version on 12 July before \"Love of My Life\" and it was performed after \"I Want It All\" on 14 July)\n# \"I Want to Break Free\"\n# \"Another One Bites the Dust\"\n# \"Radio Ga Ga\"\n# \"The Show Must Go On\" (played at every show including an excerpt played acoustically instead of normal version on 11 July before \"Love of My Life\")\n# \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\"\n# \"Bohemian Rhapsody\"\n#;Encore\n# \"Tie Your Mother Down\"\n# \"We Will Rock You\"\n# \"We Are the Champions\"\n# \"God Save the Queen\" (tape)\n}}\nTour dates\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!width=\"150\"|Date\n!width=\"150\"|City\n!width=\"150\"|Country\n!width=\"275\"|Venue\n!width=\"175\"|Tickets sold/available\n!width=\"100\"|Box office\n|-\n!colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:#ddd;\"|Europe\n|-\n|30 June 2012\n|Kyiv\n|Ukraine\n|Maidan Nezalezhnosti\n|colspan=\"2\"| —\n|-\n|3 July 2012\n|Moscow\n|Russia\n|Olimpiyskiy\n|\n|\n|-\n|7 July 2012\n|Wrocław\n|Poland\n|Stadion Miejski\n|colspan=\"2\"| —\n|-\n|11 July 2012\n|rowspan=\"3\"|London\n|rowspan=\"3\"|England\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Hammersmith Apollo\n|\n|\n|-\n|12 July 2012\n|\n|\n|-\n|14 July 2012\n|\n|\n|}\nPersonnel\n* Brian May – electric and acoustic guitars, vocals\n* Roger Taylor – drums, percussion, vocals\n* Adam Lambert – lead vocals\n* Freddie Mercury – lead vocals (pre-recorded)\nAdditional musicians\n* Spike Edney – keyboards, backing vocals\n* Neil Fairclough – bass guitar, backing vocals\n* Rufus Tiger Taylor – percussion, additional drums, backing vocals\nNotes\nCancellations and rescheduled shows\n{| cellpadding=\"2\" style=\"border: 0px solid darkgray; font-size:90%\"\n! width=\"150\" |\n! width=\"175\" |\n! width=\"200\" |\n! width=\"450\" |\n|- border=\"0\"\n|July 7, 2012\n|Stevenage\n|Sonisphere Festival\n|Cancelled.\n|-\n|30 June 2012\n|Moscow\n|Olimpiyskiy\n|Rescheduled to 3 July 2012.\n|}\nReferences"
