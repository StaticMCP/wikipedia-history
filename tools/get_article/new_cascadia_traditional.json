According to Nicholas DeRenzo of Yahoo! Life, the business is \"all about non-traditional flours—such as millet, tapioca, sorghum, teff, and brown rice\". The menu has included bagels, breads (including baguettes, challah, hoagie rolls, and sandwich loaves), cheddar-chive biscuits, cakes, cinnamon rolls, cookies, doughnuts, maple bars, pizzas, potato pancakes, and sandwiches. The bakery has also offered vegan options.\nHistory\nNCT is Portland's first gluten-free retail bakery. Spouses and co-owners Chris Gumke and Teresa Atkins started the bakery in 2007. Initially, the couple sold products at farmers' markets (including the Portland Farmers Market) before opening a brick and mortar shop in southeast Portland in 2008. The business has been featured in an episode of Cupcake Wars.\nReception\nAllison Jones and Tuck Woodstock included the bakery in Portland Monthly's 2014 \"Essential Gluten-Free Food & Drink Guide\". In 2020, Nicholas DeRenzo included NCT in Yahoo! Life's list of \"8 Specialty Bakeries That Ship Bread Nationwide\", in which he wrote, \"Luckily, a dedication to whole grains, naturally fermented starters, and no preservatives yields loaves that are surprisingly Old World in their texture and taste. If your local grocery store has a limited gluten-free selection, you'll want to fill your freezer with New Cascadia's baguettes, buns, egg-free challahs, and crusty loaves.\"\nCami Hughes included the business in Portland Monthly 2021 overview of \"The Top-Tier Gluten-Free Bakeries in Town\" and recommended the maple bar donut. Sararosa Davies and Pechluck Laskey included NCT in Eater Portland 2022 list of \"Portland’s Knockout Gluten-Free Restaurants and Bakeries\". Davies also included NCT in Eater Portland 2025 overview of the city's best gluten-free restaurants and bakeries. The Food Network has said the bakery \"has become a favorite among the vegan and gluten-free communities in Portland\".\nSee also\n* List of bakeries\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
