The county board is also responsible for the Warwickshire county teams.\nHistory\nHurling has been played in the Birmingham area since 1907 when the Erin's Hope team arranged games against teams from Liverpool, Manchester and London. A period of decline followed and, in spite of various clubs forming from time to time, there were no organised competitions. In 1935, the British GAA Council arranged a meeting with the intention of forming a county board. A committee was established and some progress was made before the outbreak of World War II made it difficult to continue.\nDue to efforts of the John Mitchel's Hurling Club, and in response to a request from the Lancashire County Board, the Warwickshire County Board was formed in 1941. Clubs were subsequently formed in Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Coventry and Redditch and by 1959 there were 40 teams playing hurling and Gaelic football in Warwickshire.\nCounty team\nin 2024]]\nBetween 1946 and 1990 the Warwickshire inter-county teams reached 18 All-Ireland junior finals, divided equally amongst both Gaelic football and hurling. Warwickshire lost all nine All-Ireland JFC finals, however, All-Ireland JHC titles were won in 1968, 1969 and 1973. There was also a defeat by Antrim in the 1970 All-Ireland IHC final.\nA restructuring of the entire hurling championship system in 2005 resulted in Warwickshire fielding a team in the third tier Nicky Rackard Cup. The team later dropped down to the fourth tier and won Lory Meagher Cup titles in 2013 and 2017.\nGrounds\nGames were initially played at Glebe Farm in Birmingham. Páirc na hÉireann in Solihull is the current headquarters of Warwickshire GAA.\nHonours\n*All-Ireland Junior Hurling Championship (3): 1968, 1969, 1973\n*Lory Meagher Cup (2): 2013, 2017\n*All-British Junior Football Championship (6): 1968, 1969, 1973, 2006, 2021, 2023\n*National Hurling League Division 3A (1): 2018\n*National Hurling League Division 3B (2): 2015, 2024\nNotable players\n* Liam Watson: Lory Meagher Cup-winner (2017)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://warwickshire.gaa.ie/ Warwickshire GAA website]"
