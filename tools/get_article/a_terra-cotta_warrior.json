Warner Bros. has included the film in the catalogue of Warner Archive Collection.\nPlot\nThe First Emperor searches for the elixir of immortality, and he despatches 500 teenage boys and girls to help him accomplish this task.

When their forbidden love is exposed, the girl reveals she has found the elusive elixir and secretly gives it to Meng. The emperor orders their execution and the soldier is sentenced to death by being encased alive in clay as a terracotta warrior, only to be reawakened in the 1930s when a struggling actress, Zhu Lili, the reincarnation of the girl who remembers nothing of her past life, accidentally stumbles upon the tomb of the First Emperor.
