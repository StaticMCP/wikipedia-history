In 1861, Governor Bowen declared a wide area that included Eight Mile Plains to Stretton as a Brisbane Agricultural Reserve. This agricultural reserve was originally used as a source of timber, but when it was found to be good farming land, settlers quickly turned it into farms that produced sought-after fruit, vegetables, and poultry.\nA military map from 1922 shows only four houses in the area that is now Stretton.\nStretton was gazetted as a suburb of Brisbane in 1972, and was named after George Stretton, a settler, postmaster and hotelier at Browns Plains in the 1870s.\nIn 1989, there was controversy regarding the sale of land to Asian investors.\nStretton State College opened on 1 January 2006.\nDemographics\nIn the , Stretton had a population of 4,067 people, 51.5% female and 48.5% male.
