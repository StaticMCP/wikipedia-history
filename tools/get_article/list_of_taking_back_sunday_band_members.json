The group was originally formed by Antonio Longo, John Nolan, Eddie Reyes, Jesse Lacey, and Steven DeJoseph. The band has gone through multiple line-up changes in their career spanning eight studio albums. There have been eleven official members of Taking Back Sunday, four touring members, and twenty-three session members.\nThe band's first line-up change was in 2001, with the departure of bassist Jesse Lacey and drummer Steven DeJoseph, who were replaced by current members Adam Lazzara and Mark O'Connell. Not long after, original lead vocalist Antonio Longo also departed from the band, leaving Lazzara on lead vocals duty. Being left without a bassist, Eddie Reyes brought in Shaun Cooper to play bass guitar for the band. Soon after the band headed to the studio to record and release their debut studio album, Tell All Your Friends.\nThe band's second line-up change came when founding member and guitarist, keyboardist, and vocalist John Nolan and bassist Shaun Cooper announced their departure from the band in 2003. Nolan and Cooper were replaced by Fred Mascherino and Matt Rubano, with Mascherino performing guitars and vocals, along with Rubano performing bass guitar. With a fresh line-up, the band went onto release two more studio albums, Where You Want to Be and major label debut, Louder Now.\nThe band's third line-up change came in 2007, when Fred Mascherino left the band to pursue his solo project, The Color Fred and later his current band, Terrible Things. He was replaced by Matthew Fazzi, who was announced to be an official member on 2008, providing guitars, keyboards, and vocals. Mascherino went on to reveal in later interviews stating, \"There were just problems between the five of us about writing, who was going to do it and how we were going to do it, we weren't being very productive because we were fighting too much about that stuff. The band was more about cooking food than making music.\" With continued extensive touring with the new line-up, the band went on to release their only studio album with Fazzi, New Again.\nThe next line-up change came in 2010 when Matt Rubano and Matthew Fazzi announced that they were no longer members of Taking Back Sunday. Later it was announced that John Nolan and Shaun Cooper had re-joined the band. With the reunion of the Tell All Your Friends line-up in seven years, the band went onto release Taking Back Sunday, Happiness Is, and Tidal Wave.\nThe next line-up change wouldn't come until 2018, when the band announced that they have parted ways with founding member and guitarist, Eddie Reyes for \"personal reasons\". This was later confirmed by Reyes stating the reason for his departure was due to his battle with alcoholism. The band released their eighth studio album 152 in 2023.\nLongtime drummer O'Connell announced his departure in 2024. In July 2025, it was announced that former guitarist Fred Mascherino would return to the band as a touring member, originally temporarily bases while Nolan went to spend time with his family. Mascherino would later appear on stage with Nolan. No plans of Mascherino's status with the band has been announced.\nOfficial members\nCurrent\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" width=100%\n|-\n! width=\"75\" |Image\n! width=\"150\" |Name\n!
