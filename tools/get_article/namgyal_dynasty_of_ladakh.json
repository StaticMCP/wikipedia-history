The Namgyal dynasty succeeded the first dynasty of Maryul and had several conflicts with the neighboring Mughal Empire and various dynasties of Tibet, including the Tibet–Ladakh–Mughal War. The dynasty eventually fell to the Sikh Empire and Dogras of Jammu. Most of its known history is written in the Ladakh Chronicles.\nHistory\nFounding\nAccording to the Ladakh Chronicles, the Namgyal dynasty was founded by Bhagan, the son of Bhara in the kingdom of Maryul. Bhagan was described as warlike, and established the Namgyal dynasty in 1460 after he formed an alliance with the people of Leh and dethroned the Maryul king Lodrö Chokden (''Blo-gros-mc'og-ldan) and his brothers Drünpa Aliand Lapten Dargyé (Slab-bstan-dar-rgyas).\nHe took the surname Namgyal (meaning victorious) and founded a new dynasty which still survives today. King Tashi Namgyal (1555–1575) managed to repel most Central Asian raiders, and built a royal fort on the top of the Namgyal Peak. Tsewang Namgyal (1575–1595) extended his kingdom as far as Nepal.\n, based in Leh.]]Sengge Namgyal (r. 1616-1642), known as the \"Lion\" King, made efforts to restore Ladakh to its old glory by an ambitious and energetic building program including the Leh Palace and the rebuilding of several gompas, the most famous of which are Hemis and Hanle.\nHe expanded the kingdom into Zanskar and Spiti, but was defeated by the Mughals, who had already occupied Kashmir and Baltistan. His son Deldan Namgyal (1642–1694) had to placate the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb by building a mosque in Leh. However, he defeated the Mughal army in Baltistan. His son Delek sided with Bhutan in a religious dispute between Tibet and Bhutan, which resulted in an invasion by the Fifth Dalai Lama. Delek Namgyal sought assistance from the Mughal Empire who drove out the Tibetan forces. The Mughuls withdrew after being paid off by the 5th Dalai Lama.\nDownfall\nThe Namgyal dynasty ended in 1842 after an invasion of Ladakh by the Dogra general Zorawar Singh and its subsequent annexation.\nBy the beginning of the 19th century, the Mughal empire had collapsed and Sikh rule had been established in Punjab and Kashmir. However the Dogra region of Jammu remained under its Rajput rulers (who ruled under the maharaja ranjit singh) Rajput ruler were given the control of their states but under the name of Punjab and they were part of khalsa empire, General Zorawar Singh invaded Ladakh in 1834. King Tshespal Namgyal was dethroned and exiled to Stok where they still had a small jagir until the post independence political integration of India.\nList of kings\nThe kings of Namgyal dynasty along with their periods of reign are as follows:\n#Lhachen Bhagan (c. 1460-1485)\n#Unknown (c. 1485-1510)\n#Lata Jughdan (c. 1510-1535)\n#Kunga Namgyal I (c. 1535-1555)\n#Tashi Namgyal I ('BKra‐śis‐rnam‐rgyal, c. 1555-1575) son\n#Tsewang Namgyal I (Ts'e-dbaṅ‐rnam‐rgyal, c. 1575-1595) nephew\n#Namgyal Gonpo (rNam-rgyal-mgon-po, c. 1595-1600) brother\n#Jamyang Namgyal (Jams-dbyang-rnam-rgyal, c. 1595-1616) brother\n#Sengge Namgyal (Seng-ge-rnam-rgyal, first time, 1616–1623) son\n#Norbu Namgyal (1623–1624) brother\n#Sengge Namgyal (second time, 1624–1642)\n#Deldan Namgyal (Bde-ldan-rnam-rgyal, 1647–1694) son\n#Delek Namgyal  (Bde-legs-rnam-rgyal, 1678–1691) son (prince regent)\n#Nyima Namgyal  (Ñi-ma-rnam-rgyal, 1691–1729) son\n#Deskyong Namgyal (Bde‐skyoṅ‐rnam‐rgyal, 1729–1739) son\n#Phuntsog Namgyal (P'un‐ts'ogs‐rnam‐rgyal, 1739–1753) son\n#Tsewang Namgyal II (Ts'e‐dbaṅ-rnam‐rgyal, 1753–1782) son\n#Tseten Namgyal  (Ts'e‐brtan‐rnam‐rgyal, 1782-1802) son\n#Tsepal Dondup Namgyal (Ts'e‐dpal‐don‐grub‐rnam‐rgyal, 1802–1837, 1839–1840) brother\n#Kunga Namgyal II (Kun‐dga'‐rnam‐rgyal'', 1840–1842) grandson\nGallery\nFile:Leh Palace Morning View.jpg|Leh Palace\nFile:Namgyal Palace in Stok.jpg|The Stok Royal Palace, residence of the descendants of Namgyal dynasty\nFile:Leh, Tsemo Monastery, Tsemo Castle, Ladakh, India.jpg|Tsemo Castle\nSee also\n* History of Ladakh\n* Stok\n* Zhabdrung\n*Parvati Devi (Ladakh politician) – Queen mother of Ladakh and former MP\nReferences\nBibliography\n* }}\n* }}\nExternal links\n*[http://india.journeymart.com/ladakh/history.asp History of Ladakh]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061030023958/http://www.himalmag.com/2006/august/special_report_1.htm History of Sikkim] (archived)"
