Alex started performing drag in 2014 at Jagriti, The Humming Tree, and gave many performances at Rangashankara, Opus and Alliance Franciase among others. Alex is also an actor, singer, motivational speaker and a corporate employee.\nBiography\nAlex was born and raised in Thiruvananthapuram. Alex is one of India's first drag artists who started performing in the city of Bengaluru. Mathew acknowledged he was queer in September 2014, and credits his mother for the courage to do so.  He was inspired by RuPaul and Bianca Del Rio.  He has promoted local cultural identity in the drag art form, performed in many places in India, given multiple TEDx talks, and conducted workshops.  Prasad Bidapa did a photo shoot with him in 2017.  As an activist, Mathew engages in the issues of gender and feminism.  He has performed at live events, and hosted the talk show Chaaya with Maya, thanking Keshav Suri for giving him the confidence to become Maya.\nTalking about the relationship with Bengaluru as a city of drag Alex said \"“I had dressed up as Nagavalli (a character from the Malayalam movie Manichitrathazhu) for a fancy dress competition. I did not intend to win a prize; I just wanted to express my feminity.” Now, having been part of Bengaluru’s drag scene for about a decade, Bengaluru has been very open to outsiders as well as new experiences.”. Alex believed that the repealing of 377 was one of the key moment for kickstarting drag in India, Alex said \"“We had very few people attending before. But post that, we saw an influx of crowds. Now people know that there are people like us. They are more aware,” he says when asked about the boom of Indian drag.\nAlex Methodology of drag is driven from the Indian pop culture and current politics of the society, Alex Said \"I started performing drag in September 2014. The reason I started doing it was because it was fun, the idea of dressing up and entertaining people. But around that time, there was a 4-year-old girl child who was raped here in Bengaluru. Keeping this and Nirbhaya in my mind, I felt I had to make a change when it comes to individualism, gender equality, and feminism. In my own way. That’s when I created Mayamma, the drag queen, who is from Kuttanad. I started including messages in my performance and people liked it,\" Alex Inaugurated a pride cafe in Bengaluru in Jan2023.\nAlex as Maya has been featured in a French documentary by Nickie Doll titled The Queer Explorer.\nPersonal life\nAlex came out his family in a couple of months since his first performance. Speaking about his experience to come out to his mother Alex said \"That day, my mother gave away the sari reluctantly because she couldn't approve of my drag identity,\" says Mathew, an artist manager who lives in the southern city of Bangalore. \"Now she packs my suitcase whenever I step out of the city for performance. It took her three years to accept my drag identity and understand that I perform in a sari to break the gender stereotypes of this patriarchal world.\"\nAlex has faced a lot of discrimination due to their Malayali accent, he was trolled and subjected to bullying due to the same.  Alex said \" I admired my Malayali accent. And that’s when I came across this movie called Mrs. Doubtfire. Also, the Indianized version in Bollywood is Chachi 420. So that’s when I was like, if Robin Williams and Kamal Hassan can dress up as a woman I can do too. That’s how I started. After my first performance as Maya, I came out of the closet, as a queer man. Through Drag, I could express my femininity, and accentuate it on stage. It's a form of entertainment, it’s a form of expression. And it's something that not many people from the LGBTQIA+ community have the chance to do.\"\nMusic\n* Proud Maya\n* Drag Queens\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkCz5Y1jrqQ An unapologetic drag queen of India | Alex Mathew | TEDxSGGSCC]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfqFaF7SPcI We are Queer & We are Here | Maya the Drag Queen | Alex Mathew | TEDxIITRoorkee]\n* [https://www.ted.com/talks/alex_mathew_your_identity_is_upon_you_to_define_alex_mathew_tedxmica Your identity is upon you to define | Alex Mathew | TEDxMICA]"
