A Weight for Age race open to horses age three and older, it was contested on dirt over a distance of a mile and a half (12 furlongs).\nRun as the Century Stakes until 1908, the race was last run in September 1909 after the Republican controlled New York Legislature under Governor Charles Evans Hughes passed the Hart–Agnew anti-betting legislation on June 11, 1908. The owners of Sheepshead Bay Race Track, and other racing facilities in New York State, struggled to stay in business without betting. However, further restrictive legislation was passed by the New York Legislature in 1910 which resulted in the deepening of the financial crisis for track operators and led to a complete shut down of racing across the state during 1911 and 1912. When a Court ruling saw racing return in 1913 it was too late for the Sheepshead Bay facility and it never reopened.\nRecords\nSpeed record:\n*  2:30.60 – Ballot (1908) (new track record)\nMost wins:\n* 2 – Ballot (1907, 1908)\nMost wins by a jockey:\n* 2 – David Nicol (1905, 1907)\nMost wins by a trainer:\n* 3 – James G.
