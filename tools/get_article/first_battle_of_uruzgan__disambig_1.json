There, he engaged the Uruzgani Hazaras in battle but suffered significant losses, losing 1,000 men. Following the defeat, Faiz retreated to a nearby Afghan fort, where he and his remaining troops were besieged by the Hazaras.\nAfter enduring a month-long siege, Faiz Mohammad Khan ultimately surrendered to the Hazaras. The Hazaras then took control of the fort, massacred the Afghan troops inside, and hunted down the remaining survivors.\nSee also\n* Battle of Uruzgan\nReferences"
