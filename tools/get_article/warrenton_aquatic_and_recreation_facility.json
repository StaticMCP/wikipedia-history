Fitch Warrenton Aquatic and Recreation Facility, commonly acronymized as The WARF, is a town-owned recreation center and accompanying park in Warrenton, Virginia. The Town of Warrenton Parks and Recreation Department is situated within the facility.\nThe facility offers a variety of memberships and day passes to individuals based on their residency. The WARF also hosts various fitness classes and special events for holidays and reservations.\nHistory\nThe WARF opened in September, 2007 after 18 months of construction.\nThe WARF temporarily closed to the public in March, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The closure followed orders from the Virginia Governor and the U.S. President regarding the pandemic. The WARF reopened in July, 2020.\nA graduate student from George Mason University surveyed WARF members in 2021 to determine their desire to return to the WARF after the COVID-19 pandemic as part of a required independent study course.\nIn April, 2023 a water main break caused damage to the walkway leading to the facility's main entrance. Construction to repair this began in December, 2024 and will be completed in 2025.\nDesign and Facilities\nThe building's design was inspired by historical farming of the Virginia Piedmont region, on which the WARF is situated. Because of this, the building has a vestibule inspired by a grain silo, a broad gable roof inspire by farmhouses, and a warm interior pallet largely consisting of exposed wood.\nThe recreation center consists of three floors: a lower floor, a main floor, and two penthouses. The main floor consists largely of a reception area, spectator seating, a cylindrical vestibule, fitness rooms, and office space. The lower floor contains a 364,000 gallon competition pool, a 68,000 gallon leisure pool, a 3,600 gallon hot tub, and a water slide.\nThe building was built on a large piece of land, with various rectangular playing fields situated around it. Additionally, there are a variety of paved walking paths, a year-round outdoor ice skating rink, a playground, and a skateboard park on the grounds.\nAwards\nThe facility and its contractors have won two awards. The Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC) Metro Washington awarded Forrester Construction Company with a 2008 Excellence in Construction Award for the WARF. The Commercial Real Estate Development Association (NAIOP) Northern Virginia awarded Forrester Construction Company a 2008 Award of Merit for the WARF, as well.\nReferences"
