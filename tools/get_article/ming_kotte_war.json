The conflict happened when Ming China's treasure fleet arrived at Sri Lanka in 1410 or 1411. It resulted in the overthrow of King Alakeshvara and the ascension of Parakramabahu VI.\nBackground\nThe kingdoms of Gampola and Jaffna had been in wars against each other. In these wars, Alakeshvara of the Alagakkonara family gained prestige due to his military successes. He had the de facto rule over Gampola under a puppet king from the previous royal dynasty and eventually usurped the throne of the kingdom.\nDuring the Ming treasure voyages, a large Chinese fleet, led by Admiral Zheng He, arrived into local waters to establish Chinese control and stability of the maritime routes in the waters around Sri Lanka and southern India. Alakeshvara posed a threat to Chinese trade by committing piracy and hostilities in the local waters.\nDue to Alakeshvara's hostilities against the Chinese presence in Sri Lanka during the first Ming treasure voyage, Zheng decided to leave the island for other destinations. It is probable that the then-prince Parakramabahu VI or others acting on his behalf solicited aid from Zheng during this time, so the Chinese admiral adopted a hostile attitude to Alakeshvara and espoused the cause of this prince. During the third Ming treasure voyage, the Chinese fleet returned to the Gampola Kingdom. This time, the Chinese came to depose Alakeshvara by military force.  states that the confrontation against Alakeshvara in Sri Lanka most likely happened during the outward journey of the Chinese fleet in 1410, rather than the homeward journey in 1411, but he also notes that most authorities think that the confrontation happened during the homeward journey in 1411.\nWar\nOn their return to Sri Lanka, the Chinese were overbearing and contemptuous of the Sinhalese, whom they considered to be rude, disrespectful, and hostile. They also resented that the Sinhalese were committing hostilities towards neighboring countries that had diplomatic relations with Ming China. Zheng He and a contingent of 2,000 Chinese troops traveled overland into Gampola, because Alakeshvara had lured them into his territory. Alakeshvara cut off Zheng and his troops from the Chinese treasure fleet anchored at Colombo. He planned to launch a surprise attack on the fleet.\nIn response, Zheng and his contingent of troops invaded Gampola and conquered its capital. They captured Alakeshvara with his family and principal officials. For six days hereafter, they fought their way back to the fleet. The Sinhalese army hastily returned and surrounded the capital, but was repeatedly defeated in battle by the invading Chinese troops.\n|align = right\n|width =\n|border = 1px\n|fontsize = 88%\n|bgcolor = #F9F9F9\n|qalign = left\n|quoted =\n|salign = right\n}}\nThe conflict resulted in the overthrow of King Alakeshvara of the Alagakkonara family. After their voyage, Zheng He returned to Nanjing on 6 July 1411 and presented the Sinhalese captives to the Yongle Emperor, who eventually decided to free Alakeshvara and return him to Sri Lanka.\nThe Chinese were allied with Parakramabahu VI and dethroned Alakeshvara in favor of him. The Yongle Emperor requested from the Ministry of Rites to recommend someone to serve as the new king of Gampola. As documented in Chinese records, Parakramabahu VI was elected by the Sinhalese present at the Ming court, nominated by the Ming emperor, and installed with the backing of Zheng and his fleet. Both economic and diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka improved, with Parakramavahu VI as the ruler in Sri Lanka. The Chinese treasure fleet experienced no hostilities during visits to Sri Lanka on subsequent voyages.\nOn 13 September 1411, the emperor granted both rewards and promotions for those who participated in the Sinhalese confrontation after the joint recommendation of the Ministry of War and the Ministry of Rites.\nSee also\n* Battle of Palembang (1407)\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
