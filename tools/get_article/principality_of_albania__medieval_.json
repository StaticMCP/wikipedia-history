The first notable ruler was Tanusio Thopia, who became Count of Mat in 1328. The principality would reach its zenith during the rule of Karl Thopia, who emerged in 1359 after the Battle of Achelous, conquering the cities of Durrës and Krujë and consolidating his rule of central Albania between the rivers of Mat and Shkumbin. The principality would last up until 1415, when it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire.\nHistory\nReign of Tanusio Thopia\nThe principality emerged with Tanusio Thopia, mentioned in 1329 as the count of Albania. In an act of Robert, King of Naples in 15 April 1338, Tanusio was mentioned as Count of Mat (conte di Matia), which reconfirmed Thopia's relations to the Angevins from the time of Philip I. By 1340 the Thopia controlled much of the territory between the rivers Mati and Shkumbin rivers. Together with the Muzaka family, they agreed to recognize Angevin suzerainty after rebelling against the Serbs. However except for Andrea Muzaka who defeated the Serbs in a battle in the Peristeri mountains, no action was taken to realize the treaty with the Angevins.\nDuring 1342–1343, Stefan Dušan had conquered almost all of Albania, except for Durrës which remained under Angevin-Albanian rule, despite heavy Serbian pressure, marking thus the end of Byzantine rule over Albania. After Stefan Dušan's death in 1355 the Thopia family regained its domains and ruled most of central Albania.\nReign of Karl Thopia\nTanusio had one son, Andrea Thopia, who became the son-in-law of Robert, King of Naples without his consent. Robert had sent his daughter to get married in Morea, however during the journey she met Andrea in Durrës, and the couple got married and had two children, Gjergj and Karl Thopia. Robert, enraged, invited the couple to Naples in 1342 on the pretext of wanting to reconcile with them, where he had them both executed.\n, Ardenica Monastery]]\nThe Thopias became prominent in the 1350s and 60s, expanding their holdings and subjugating local nobles and tribes. In 1359, Tanusio died and was succeeded by Karl Thopia.\nKarl took part in the Battle of Achelous against Nikephoros II Orsini, the Despot of Epirus, where he led the Albanian tribes against the despotate. Orisni was killed during the battle by Karl and his army was destroyed, resulting in an Albanian victory. Thus, Epirus was left without a ruler and the vacuum was filled by Gjin Bue Shpata and Pjetër Losha, who would establish the Despotate of Angelokastron and Lepanto and the Despotate of Arta south of the domains of the principality.\nSince 1362, Karl sought to capture Durrës, which was in the possession of the Duchess Johanna of Anjou. The first, certainly still unsuccessful siege lasted from April 1362 until May 1363. Then, Karl had to withdraw his troops, who were weakened by an epidemic disease. By 1363, he had captured territories around Durrës, as well as Krujë, which would serve as his headquarters. Karl was ultimately able to conquer Durrës in March of 1368. This was the last hold of the Angevins in Albania, thus putting an end to the medieval Kingdom of Albania. Karl forged close ties with Venice and gained their support, who recognized him as Prince of Albania.\nAround 1370, Karl attacked the dominions of the Muzaka family to their south and managed to capture from them the territory between Shkumbin and Seman, marking the maximum extent of the territory held by the principate.\nBalša II made a fourth attempt to conquer Durrës, which had become an important commercial and strategic center. In 1382, Balša II began a war and seized Durrës. In 1385, the defeated Karl Thopia, appealed to Murad I for support against his rivals, the Balsha noble family of the Principality of Zeta. This was the equivalent of inviting the Ottoman Empire into Albania in order to help him defeat his rivals in Zeta.\nThis attempt caused an Ottoman force, led by Hayreddin Pasha, to quickly march into Albania along the Via Egnatia. The Ottoman force routed the enemy by inflicting heavy defeats on Balša II's forces. Balša II himself was killed in a big battle on Saurian Field near Lushnje (Battle of Savra) in 1385, ending the Balsha family's rule over Durrës.\nin Elbasan. The inscription, written in Latin with fraktur letters, commemorates the church's construction in 1381 under Prince Karl Thopia, with his son, Lord Gjergj, during the 22nd year of his reign.]]\nReign of Gjergj Thopia\nAfter Karls death in 1388, he was succeeded by his ill son, Gjergj Thopia. Due to the growing power of the Ottomans, the pressure from the Balsha noble family in the north and Gjergj's illness, Thopia rule was on the verge of collapse. Thus, Venice was concerned about Durrës falling into the hands of the Ottomans and made immediate plans to take it over through diplomatic means. By securing Durrës, Venice could keep a watchful eye on the Adriatic, secure the transit of galleys and safely benefit from Durrës' salt. In the summer of 1392, Gjergj surrendered Durrës and in return requested assistance in acquiring other lands and castles, securing the safe return of Albanians from Ottoman occupied territories and financial aid. Gjergj died in September 1392., reinforcing it with several guard towers.]]\nLater Decades\nWith the exception of Durrës, the majority of the principality went to his sister, Helena Thopia. Helena was married to a Venetian nobleman, Marco Barbarigo, who resided in Krujë and was the de facto ruler the possessions of Thopia. Marco ruled for a period of time under Venetian suzerainty. The Ottomans had set to increase their influence over Albanian lands. Presumably due to Ottoman threat of attack, Marco switched loyalty to the Ottomans and began to raid Venetian lands around Durrës. As a result, Niketa Thopia, a son of Karl and the governor of Durrës under the Venetians, attacked Barbarigo with their support and defeated him badly, forcing Barbarigo to seek refuge in the court of Gjergj Strez Balsha. However it was Kostandin Balsha who would rule Krujë, starting from late 1394. He soon married Helena and inherited her hereditary rights to Krujë.\nAfter the Battle of Ankara and subsequently the death of Bayezid I, many Albanian lords recognized Venetian suzerainty instead of Ottoman, such Koja Zaharia, Dhimitër Jonima and various members of the Dukagjin family. Konstantin Balsha, under the vassalage of the Ottomans, attempted to take Durrës in 1402, where he failed and was killed. Following his death, Niketa quickly retook Krujë on his own behalf, and the Venetians recognized him by 1404 as governor of Krujë and regarded him as an ally rather than a deputy of Venice. By 1410, Niketa ruled the territory between Krujë and the Shkumbin river and served under Venetian vassalage. In late 1411, Niketa was captured by Theodor Corona Musachi after a skirmish and was retained as a prisoner. He was released in July 1413 and returned to Krujë, where would continue to rule until 1415 when Albania fell under the Ottoman Empire and was incorporated into the Sanjak of Albania.\nRulers\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|--\n!
