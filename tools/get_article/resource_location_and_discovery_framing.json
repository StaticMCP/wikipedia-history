A P2P signalling protocol provides its clients with an abstract storage and messaging service between a set of cooperating peers that form the overlay network.  RELOAD is designed to support a peer-to-peer SIP network, but can be utilized by other applications with similar requirements by defining new usages that specify the kinds of data that must be stored for a particular application.  RELOAD defines a security model based on a certificate enrollment service that provides unique identities.  NAT traversal is a fundamental service of the protocol.  RELOAD also allows access from \"client\" nodes that do not need to route traffic or store data for others.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## REsource LOcation And Discovery Framing\n\n#REDIRECT Resource Location and Discovery Framing\n}}"
