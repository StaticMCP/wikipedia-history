It is known only from the San Francisco area in California and Klamath County in Oregon.\nThe length of the forewings is 13.4&nbsp;mm. Adults have been recorded on wing from May to June. A few September records possibly indicate a second generation.\nThis species was formerly a member of the genus Grammia, but was moved to Apantesis along with the other species of the genera Grammia, Holarctia, and Notarctia.\n}}\n* [http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/research/projects/butmoth/search/GenusList3.dsml?searchPageURL=index.dsml&SUPERFAMIL=&FAMILYqtype=starts+with&FAMILY=arctiidae&SUBFAMILYqtype=starts+with&SUBFAMILY=&TRIBEqtype=starts+with&TRIBE=&SUBTRIBEqtype=starts+with&SUBTRIBE=&GENUSqtype=starts+with&GENUS=&AUTHORqtype=starts+with&AUTHOR=&YEARqtype=equals&YEAR=&sort=GENUS Natural History Museum Lepidoptera generic names catalog]"
