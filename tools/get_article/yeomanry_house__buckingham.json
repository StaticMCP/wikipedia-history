It is a Grade II listed building.\nHistory\nThe building, which has a dull pink render, was built in the early 19th century as the offices and home of the commanding officer of the Buckinghamshire Yeomanry.  The men of the regiment were accommodated at a depot and storehouse in West Street which was completed in 1802. The regiment was mobilised in Buckingham in August 1914 before being deployed to Gallipoli and, ultimately, to the Western Front.\nAfter the First World War the regimental headquarters moved to Aylesbury and, by the 1960s, the Hunter Street area became very dilapidated. Yeomanry House was acquired by the University College at Buckingham in 1974 and, following extensive refurbishment work in the early 1980s, now serves as the main reception building and registered office of the University of Buckingham.\nReferences"
