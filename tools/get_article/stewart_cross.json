His first post was as a curate at Hexham.  From 1960 to 1963 he was Precentor of St&nbsp;Albans Cathedral then moved to Manchester to serve St&nbsp;Ambrose Church in Chorlton-on-Medlock.\nFrom 1968 to 1976 he was a producer and broadcaster for BBC religious broadcasting at Manchester, which included a TV Songs of Praise from Blackburn Cathedral, whose diocese he would later serve as bishop.\nIn 1976 he was ordained to the episcopate, first serving as suffragan Bishop of Doncaster. His consecration was on 2 July 1976 at York Minster, by Stuart Blanch, Archbishop of York. Then in 1982 he was appointed diocesan Bishop of Blackburn, serving until his premature death from cancer in 1989. He was survived by his wife, Mary, a son and two daughters.\nHe is today perhaps best known for his hymn \"Father, Lord of all creation\", published in several English-language hymnbooks.\nSee also\n*\nReferences"
