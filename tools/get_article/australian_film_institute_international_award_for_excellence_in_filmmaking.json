The award was presented in 2001 as a special achievement award before it was made into a competitive award in 2006, but from 2007-2009 it was only handed out as a career based award \"acknowledging the continued contribution of an Australian practitioner to international productions\", and not for a particular film.\nWinners\nIn the following table, in 2006 winners are listed first, in boldface and highlighted in gold; those listed below the winner that are not in boldface or highlighted are the nominees; in 2005, and from 2007-2009, the award was presented as a special award and those winners will be marked in a different colour. The third column lists the country that the film was made for, from 2005-2007.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#bebebe;\"\n! style=\"width:5%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:19%;\"| Recipient(s)\n! style=\"width:19%;\"| Film\n! style=\"width:19%;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:19%;\"| Craft\n|- style=\"background:#91CFF6\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2005(47th)\n| Roger Savage\n| House of Flying Daggers\n|\n| Sound\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2006(48th)\n| Dion Beebe\n| Memoirs of a Geisha\n|\n| Cinematography\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2006(48th)\n| Donald McAlpine\n| The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\n|\n| Cinematography\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2006(48th)\n| Roger Ford\n| The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\n|\n| Production design\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2006(48th)\n| Roger Donaldson\n| ''The World's Fastest Indian''\n|\n| Production, direction and screenplay\n|- style=\"background:#91CFF6\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2007(49th)\n| Jill Bilcock\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| &ndash;\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| &ndash;\n| Editing\n|- style=\"background:#91CFF6\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2008(50th)\n| Peter James\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| &ndash;\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| &ndash;\n| Cinematography\n|- style=\"background:#91CFF6\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2009(51st)\n| Nathan McGuinness\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| &ndash;\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| &ndash;\n| Senior visual effects supervisor\n|}\nSee also\n*AACTA Awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.aacta.org/ The Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts Official website]"
