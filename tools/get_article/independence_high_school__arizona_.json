The school's name was picked by the school board because of the bicentennial observance.  The school was scheduled to open in the summer of 1976, but was postponed due to construction and lack of demand from the district's student population. It opened during the 1977–1978 school year under principal Fed McClure.  The initial enrollment was 420 students consisting of freshman and sophomore students only. The first graduating class was in 1980.  The school celebrated its thirtieth anniversary during the 2007–2008 school year.\nThe school was designed by the local architecture firm Varney, Sexton, Sydnor Associates and built in the Brutalist style.\nTwo weeks after the school opened, a fire broke out destroying parts of the lower level, however classes resumed a few days later.  A formal dedication was held on November 17, 1977, with the Honorable Bob Stump, representative, as guest speaker.\nOn February 12, 2016, the school was the site of a murder suicide shooting that killed two 15-year-old girls.\nEthnic diversity\nIndependence's student ethnic diversity as of November 2023:\n* Asian: 81 (3.95%)\n* American Indian/Alaskan Native: Not Specified\n* Black/African American: 130 (6.34%)\n* Hispanic/Latino: 1633 (79.7%)\n* Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander: Not Specified\n* Multiple Races: 27 (1.32%)\n* White: 154 (7.52%)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
