In 1890 Bokar Biro took power in a coup after assassinating his brother, and began placing men loyal to him in positions of authority.  A see-saw power struggle commenced, in which Bokar Biro more than once lost and regained power.\nThe French decided to intervene, and sent a small force demanding a treaty with terms that favored their interests against the British.\nBokar Biro pretended to sign the treaty, but when the document was examined in Saint Louis, it turned out that in place of his signature Bokar Biro had written \"Bismillah\", meaning \"in the name of God\".\nBattle\nAt the end of the rainy season in late 1896 the French dispatched troops from Senegal, Guinea and the Sudan, converging on Futa Jallon. A French column captured Timbo on 3 November 1896. Bokar Biro was unable to enlist the support of the chiefs in resisting the French.\nOn 13 November 1896 Bokar Biro fought a pitched battle on the plain of Porédaka. He was opposed by a combined force of French troops and Fulbe led by Umaru Bademba Barry. Biro chose the battlefield poorly, as his forces were armed with muskets of poor quality and very limited range, while the tirailleurs were able to mow down the enemy from a distance. After a battle of about an hour's duration Bokar's forces counted 150 dead and 300 wounded, in striking contrast to the tirailleurs' three slightly wounded men.\nThe French artillery destroyed his army. A poet who described the battle said that Bokar Biro kept his word.  He did not flee from the French, but was killed by the blast of the cannon. Other sources claim he was captured and killed while attempting to flee.\nBokar Biro's son died with him.\nResults\nThe French installed a resident at Timbo. They recognized the independence of Alfa Yaya, a chief who had supported them, and appointed Umaru Bademba as the almani.  A few months later a protectorate treaty was signed and in June 1897 Ernest Noirot became administrator of the state. Noirot dedicated himself to eliminating the institution of slavery.\nAt first the French kept the existing system of chiefs in place, although they removed any who were hostile.\nIn 1904 the French restructured the administration, removing the power of the chiefs. In 1905 they arrested Alfa Yaya and sent him into exile.\nNotes and references\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*"
