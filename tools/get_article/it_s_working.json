The album covers were made by So Me.\nSonic Boom's commentary on the track, before the Congratulations sessions at the Blanker Unsinn Studio on 2010, is \"Love? Or Confusion? Reality? Contusion? Subterranea or Sub-fusion. The Quest begins.\"\nHistory\nThe single was added to BBC Radio 1's C-Playlist in May 2010 and later upgraded to the B-Playlist.\nOn June 29, the single was released as a digital download on iTunes, with the name of \"It's Working Digital 45\" and contains the Air and Violens remix.\nOn June 30, the remix by Air was given as a free download on RCRD LBL.\nMusic video\nMGMT said in an interview for Pitchfork about the song, \"We just shot the coolest video in Paris with director So Me [Justice's \"D.A.N.C.E.\"] for 'It's Working'. In it, Ben and I find this box and these instructions to put together a machine that's constantly changing, and we end up losing control over it. Saying this now, it sounds so metaphorical for our musical career, which is really funny.\"\nThe video was premiered on June 15 on their website.\nThe video has Andrew VanWyngarden and Ben Goldwasser finding a box that contains a giant machine. They find a booklet with the title \"Construction Manual\" on it. They look through it and push different buttons on the machine. While VanWyngarden and Goldwasser push the buttons a woman walks past but they do not take any notice of her and the machine takes photos of her that MGMT show to a photo booth. While the song keeps playing, VanWyngarden and Goldwasser do various things with the machine such as pour ice cream all over a sombrero on Will Berman's head and locking Matthew Asti in with a giant gopher. Near the end of the video, the machine starts shrinking VanWyngarden tries looking for Goldwasser and finds him in bed with the woman from before as the song starts fading. He wakes Goldwasser up and try getting out of the machine. VanWyngarden, Richardson and Asti escape but VanWyngarden goes back for Goldwasser who gets stuck in the machine along with VanWyngarden. The video ends with the box closing itself and a man (played by the video's director, So Me), picking up the box.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n* Andrew VanWyngarden – vocals, guitar, bass guitar\n* Ben Goldwasser – synthesizer and samples, omnichord\n* James Richardson – guitar\n* Matt Asti – guitar\n* Will Berman – drums\n* Britta Phillips – additional vocals\n* Gillian Rivers – strings\nReferences"
