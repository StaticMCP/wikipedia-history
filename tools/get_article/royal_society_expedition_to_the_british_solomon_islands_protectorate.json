Prior to the expedition, the Royal Society stated \"[the expedition] can make a highly significant contribution to scientific knowledge, not only because of the light it can throw on the migration of plants and animals in the past, but also because of the knowledge of the rules which govern such movements.\" This could inform how distributions may change in the future.\nVoyage\nLed by Edred John Henry Corner, the expedition departed in July 1965, returning in December that year, following a preliminary visit in 1964.\nThe expedition was split between marine and land parties. The marine party was led by John Morton, on the vessel A. K. Maroro captained by Captain S. Brown. The land party made multiple surveys of two to four weeks duration at several locations including Guadalcanal, San Cristobal, and others.\nParticipants\nParticipants came from British, New Zealand, and Australian institutions.\n* E.
