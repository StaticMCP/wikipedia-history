The awards show was hosted by Steve Allen and Dick Clark and broadcast on NBC. For the second year in a row, the top series awards went to the same shows, Taxi and Lou Grant. Lou Grant was the most successful show of the night winning five major awards. It also received 14 major nominations, tying the record for most major nominations by a drama series, set by Playhouse 90 in 1959.\nThe ceremony was held in the midst of a strike by members of the Screen Actors Guild; in a show of support for their union, 51 of the 52 nominated performers boycotted the event. Powers Boothe was the only nominated actor to attend; acknowledging his presence in his acceptance speech, he remarked, \"This is either the most courageous moment of my career or the stupidest.\"\nWinners and nominees\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Taxi (ABC)'\n** Barney Miller (ABC)\n** M*A*S*H (CBS)\n** Soap (ABC)\n** WKRP in Cincinnati (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Lou Grant (CBS)'\n** Dallas (CBS)\n** Family (ABC)\n** The Rockford Files (NBC)\n** The White Shadow (CBS)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'The Miracle Worker (NBC)'\n** All Quiet on the Western Front (CBS)\n** Amber Waves (ABC)\n** ''Gideon's Trumpet (CBS)\n** Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'Edward & Mrs. Simpson (Syndicated)'\n** Disraeli: Portrait of a Romantic (PBS)\n** The Duchess of Duke Street (PBS)\n** Moviola (NBC)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" colspan=\"2\"|\n* 'Baryshnikov on Broadway (ABC)'\n** The Benny Hill Show (Syndicated)\n** Goldie and Liza Together (CBS)\n** The Muppet Show (Syndicated)\n** Shirley MacLaine...
