      "text": "# Austin Revolution Film Festival\n\nAustin Revolution Film Festival (ARFF) is an annual film festival in Austin, Texas.\nHistory\nJames Christopher is the festival director and founder. Christopher said the festival is focused on indie filmmakers who are creative without large budgets. The festival made MovieMaker's \"50 Film Festivals Worth the Entry Fee in 2018\". That year the festival awarded Overwood, a script by Scott Cobb, as a semi-finalist. It was later revoked after Cobb complained about the festival being heartless, promoting gun violence by branding themselves with revolvers on their laurels.\nIn 2022, the festival held extended in person screenings of films from the 9th and 10th festival at the Crown Plaza Austin Hotel because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.coloradoriverscreenplays.com/ARFF2016.php 2016 Film reviews]\n* [https://www.meiermovies.com/arff-barks-again/ Post COVID-19 review]"
