He has seven siblings, among them the award-winning historian and biographer Lady Antonia Fraser (who is the widow of playwright Harold Pinter); Lady Rachel Billington, also a writer (and the widow of the director Kevin Billington); Lady Judith Kazantzis, a poet; and The Hon. Kevin Pakenham, who worked in the City of London. He is also a cousin of the former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman.\nPakenham was educated at Belvedere College, a private Jesuit school in Dublin, and at Magdalen College, Oxford. After graduating in 1955, he travelled around Ethiopia, a journey that he described in his first book, The Mountains of Rasselas (1959).\nLater life\nAfter returning to Britain, Pakenham worked on the editorial staff of the Times Educational Supplement and later for The Sunday Telegraph and The Observer''. He now divides his time between London and County Westmeath, Ireland, where he is the Chairman of the Irish Tree Society and honorary custodian of Tullynally Castle.\nPakenham owned Longford Greyhound Stadium until 1966, when he sold it to Longford Sports Ltd.\nPakenham does not use the title Earl of Longford and, before succeeding his father in 2001, did not use the courtesy title Lord Silchester. However, he has not disclaimed his British titles of Baron Silchester and Baron Pakenham under the Peerage Act 1963 and his Irish earldom cannot be disclaimed as it is not covered by the Act.  Following the House of Lords Act 1999, Pakenham is not entitled as an hereditary peer to a seat in the House of Lords. His father had previously been created a life peer in addition to his hereditary titles in order to retain his seat.\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2016.\nMarriage and children\nIn 1964, Pakenham married Valerie Susan McNair Scott. They have four children.\n* Lady Anna Maria Pakenham  (born 26 July 1965)\n* Lady Eliza Pakenham (born 3 November 1966)\n* Edward Melchior Pakenham, Lord Silchester (born 6 January 1970), heir apparent to the earldom.\n* Hon Frederick Augustus Pakenham (born 27 November 1971)\nValerie Pakenham died on 22 January 2023 at the age of 83.\nBibliography\n* The Mountains of Rasselas: An Ethiopian Adventure, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1959.
