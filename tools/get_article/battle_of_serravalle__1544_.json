At the insistence of Francis I of France, the French army resumed the Siege of Carignano, where Pirro Colonna held out for several weeks. Soon after the city's surrender, the impending invasion of France itself by the forces of the Emperor Charles and Henry VIII of England, forced Francis to recall much of his army from Piedmont, leaving the Count of Enghien without the troops he needed to take Milan.\nThe Spaniards, holding all the strong places of Lombardy, were enabled to prevent d'Enghien from any further success.\nBattle\nby Titian.]]\nfamily of the Strozzi.]]\nPietro Strozzi, an Italian military leader in French service, who had collected an army of over 10,000 soldiers at Mirandola, advanced boldly to Milan, in the hopes of joining d'Enghien there, but on 2–4 June, the Imperial-Spanish army commanded by Don Alfonso d'Avalos intercepted and defeated the Franco-Italian army of Pietro Strozzi and the Count of Pitigliano. The Strozzi's army was destroyed and the Spaniards obtained the total control of the Lombardy, ending the French offensive of the François de Bourbon, Count of Enghien, to try to capture the Duchy of Milan.\nThe brilliant French victory at Ceresole occurred two months earlier, finally resulted useless.\nConsequences\nThe Milanese would remain in the hands of the Emperor Charles, and in the end of the war saw a return to the status-quo in northern Italy. In May, the Emperor invaded France with two armies. One of them, led by the Imperial commander Ferrante Gonzaga, Viceroy of Sicily, captured Luxembourg and moved towards Commercy and Ligny. On 8 July, Ferrante Gonzaga besieged Saint-Dizier, and the second army led by the Emperor Charles stationed in the Electorate of the Palatinate, soon joined him.\nMeanwhile, Henry VIII, had sent an army of some 40,000 men to Calais under the command of Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, and Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk.\nSee also\n*List of battles of the Italian Wars\n*Siege of St. Dizier\n*Sieges of Boulogne (1544–1546)\n*Italian Wars\nNotes\nReferences\n* Scotto, Andrea.
