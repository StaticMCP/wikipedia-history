According to Jupiter Film, they own the rights to the original script for The Face Reader with a \"one source multi use\" clause, for the express purpose of producing a film, a book series, and a television series based on the story about a face-reading fortuneteller who gets caught up in a political battle for the throne. The film sold 9 million tickets in 2013, and two books in the series (backstories for the characters in the film) have been released thus far. Jupiter Film said they approached KBS Media in 2012 about a 24-episode TV drama adaptation of The Face Reader and handed over scripts and outlines, and mentioned War of Money screenwriter Lee Hyang-hee as a good candidate for penning the remake. But KBS Media and Jupiter Film could not agree on terms and negotiations fell through. Jupiter Film alleged that after KBS Media backed out of the deal, the latter took the idea and made their own version, including hiring the screenwriter they'd suggested.\nKBS in turn issued the following statement: \"''The King's Face is a totally different drama in people, era, and setting, with different plot and conflict structure, and mode of expression from The Face Reader''.\" While waiting for the court's final decision, KBS decided to go ahead with the production and made casting announcements. The court ruling in November 2014 was in KBS's favor, stating that there was no plagiarism involved.\nInternational broadcast\n*  Myanmar – MRTV-4 (2015)\n*  Indonesia - RTV (April 23, 2016)\n* Thailand – Channel 3 (January 10, 2017)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
