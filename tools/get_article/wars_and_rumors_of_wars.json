The album is unique in that, the first 25,000 CD cases were hand stamped, signed and numbered by the band, every member stamping 5,000 each. Similarly, the first 300 were stamped in red ink for a special pre-order. They have stated this was done because they felt that CDs were becoming too impersonal, meaning that bands did not have much to do with a CD after the recording was finished, as the artwork would be designed by someone else, and then the whole package would be sent to the printer. The album is the only release by the band to feature guitarists Dan Vokey and Brian Russell Taylor.\nTrack listing\nAll lyrics written by Josh Scogin and composed by The Chariot\nPersonnel\n;The Chariot\n* Josh Scogin - vocals\n* Dan Vokey - guitar\n* Bryan Russell Taylor - guitar\n* Jon \"KC Wolf\" Kindler - bass\n* David Kennedy – drums\n;Additional Instrumentation\n*Jeff Gingrich - Cello (\"Never I\")\nTrivia\n* There is a hidden message in the song titles.
