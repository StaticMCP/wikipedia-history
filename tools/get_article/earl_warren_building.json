The building was completed in 1922, and is named for 30th governor of California and 14th Chief Justice of the United States, Earl Warren. The Supreme Court first held oral argument in the building in 1923. The building is part of the Ronald M. George State Office Complex (the San Francisco Civic Center Complex) along with the Hiram W. Johnson State Office Building.\nThe building's facade features granite and terra-cotta masonry and is done in the Beaux-Arts architectural style. Inside, the courtroom for the Supreme Court is paneled in oak and features a coffered ceiling and a skylight 30 feet in height.  A mural above the judges' bench depicts a California landscape. After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the court vacated the building, eventually returning in 1999.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
