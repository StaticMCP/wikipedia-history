In return, Germany recognized British authority in Zanzibar. Heligoland was needed to control the new Kiel Canal and the approaches to Germany's North Sea ports. Britain used Zanzibar as a key link in the British control of East Africa.\nTerms\nin Zanzibar with its staff (1890)]]\nGermany gained the islands of Heligoland () in the North Sea, originally possession of the dukes of Holstein-Gottorp but since 1814 a British possession, the so-called Caprivi Strip in what is now Namibia, and a free hand to control and acquire the coast of Dar es Salaam that would form the core of German East Africa (later Tanganyika, now the mainland component of Tanzania).\nIn exchange, Germany handed over to Britain the protectorate over the small sultanate of Wituland (, on the Kenyan coast) and parts of East Africa vital for the British to build a railway to Lake Victoria, and pledged not to interfere with British actions vis-à-vis the independent Sultanate of Zanzibar (i.e. the islands of Unguja and Pemba). In addition, the treaty established the German sphere of interest in German South West Africa (most of present-day Namibia) and settled the borders between German Togoland and the British Gold Coast (now Ghana), as well as between German Kamerun and British Nigeria.\nConsequences\nBritain divested itself of a naval base which covered the approaches to the main German naval bases in the North Sea.  It immediately declared a protectorate over Zanzibar and, in the subsequent 1896 Anglo-Zanzibar War, gained full control of the sultanate.\nThe treaty served German chancellor Leo von Caprivi's aims for a settlement with the British. After the 1884 Berlin Conference, Germany had been losing out in the \"Scramble for Africa\". The German East Africa Company under Carl Peters had acquired a strip of land on the Tanganyikan coast (leading to the 1888 Abushiri Revolt), but had never had any control over the islands of the Zanzibar sultanate. The treaty gave away no vital German interests, while acquiring Heligoland, an island which was strategically placed for control over the German Bight. With the construction of the Kiel Canal from 1887 onward, control of the German Bight had become essential to Emperor Wilhelm's II plans for expansion of the Imperial Navy. Wilhelm's naval policies aborted an accommodation with the British and ultimately led to a rapprochement between Britain and France, sealed with the Entente cordiale in 1904.\nThe misleading name for the treaty was introduced by ex-Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who intended to attack his despised successor Caprivi for concluding an agreement that Bismarck himself had arranged during his incumbency. However, Bismarck's nomenclature implied that Germany had swapped an African empire for tiny Heligoland (\"trousers for a button\"). This was eagerly adopted by imperialists, who complained about \"treason\" against German interests. Carl Peters and Alfred Hugenberg appealed for the foundation of the  (\"Pan-German League\") which took place in 1891.\nNotes\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*  Includes the citation of the English version of the contract.\nExternal links\n*[http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=782 Vertrag zwischen dem Deutschen Reich und dem Vereinigten Königreich über die Kolonien und Helgoland vom 1.&nbsp;Juli 1890], Deutsche Geschichte in Dokumenten und Bildern (DGDB), Transcription of: Das Staatsarchiv.
