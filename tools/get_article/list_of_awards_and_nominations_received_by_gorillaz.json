While watching MTV, Hewlett came up with the idea to create the band, and later commented, \"If you watch MTV for too long, it's a bit like hell – there's nothing of substance there. So we got this idea for a cartoon band, something that would be a comment on that.\" Gorillaz is a virtual band consisting of four cartoon characters: 2D, Murdoc, Noodle, and Russel. They are used in promotional material such as album covers, posters, and in concerts, during which holographic versions of the characters are used. The band's music is usually a collaboration between various musicians; Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor. Gorillaz have released eight studio albums, all on the Parlophone and Virgin record labels: Gorillaz (2001), Demon Days (2005), Plastic Beach (2010), The Fall (digital in 2010, physical in 2011), Humanz (2017), The Now Now (2018), Song Machine, Season One: Strange Timez (2020), and Cracker Island (2023).\nGorillaz have received eleven BRIT Award nominations: six in 2002, two in 2006, one in 2011, one in 2018 and one in 2019. In 2006, Gorillaz received their only Grammy Award, the Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals award for the song \"Feel Good Inc.\" The band has received fifteen nominations from the MTV Europe Music Awards, winning four of them: Best Dance Act and Best Song for \"Clint Eastwood\" in 2001, and Best Group in 2005. At the MTV Video Music Awards, Gorillaz received both the Best Special Effects and Breakthrough Video awards for \"Feel Good Inc.\" in 2005. In 2023, at the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards, Gorillaz received a nomination in the category of  Outstanding Emerging Media Program for Song Machine, a series of music videos made to accompany their seventh studio album, Song Machine, Season One: Strange Timez. Overall, Gorillaz have received 27 awards from 81 nominations.\nMercury Prize Award\nThe Mercury Prize are the annual awards by the British Phonographic Industry and British Association of Record Dealers. In 2001, their debut album, Gorillaz, was nominated for a Mercury Prize, but it was later withdrawn at the band's request. Murdoc Niccals, the virtual bassist of the band, described the nomination as, \"It's like carrying a dead albatross round your neck for eternity\". This is the only time that Gorillaz has ever withdrawn for an award nomination.\nBillboard Video Music Awards\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"| 2001 || rowspan=\"3\"| \"Clint Eastwood\" || Maximum Vision Award ||\n|-\n|Best Modern Rock New Artist Clip ||\n|-\n|Best Rap/Hip-Hop New Artist Clip ||\n|-\n|Jamie Hewlett/Pete Candeland || Director of the Year (for \"Clint Eastwood\") ||\nBrit Awards\nThe Brit Awards are the British Phonographic Industry's annual pop music awards.

The prize was conceived by Popjustice founder Peter Robinson in 2003 as a reaction to what he perceived as the pompous and elitist nature of the existing Mercury Prize, which recognises the best album of the previous year, and in particular its exclusion of pop music acts in favour of those from more esoteric genres. The shortlist for the Popjustice prize is announced in September of each year and the winner named the following month, to coincide with the presentation of the Mercury Prize. Popjustice gives a token prize of £20 to the winner of its award, in contrast to the £20,000 given to the winner of the Mercury Prize.\n|-\n| 2006\n| \"Dare\"\n| Best British Pop Single\n|\nQ Awards\nThe Q Awards is an annual awards ceremony founded by the music magazine Q.
