The organization was established by a group of civil activists, university professors, journalists, lawyers, doctors, women, and youth. Its mission is to raise awareness and promote the establishment of a democratic governmental structure based on human rights, sustainable development, and political decentralization in Iran, particularly in the Azerbaijan region.\nObjectives\nThe center defines itself as a democratic, participatory, secular, and development-oriented institution. Its main objectives include:\n* Strengthening democratic culture and civic engagement in Iranian society\n* Promoting decentralization of the political and administrative structure of the country\n* Combating linguistic, ethnic, religious, and gender discrimination\n* Supporting the rights of Turks (Azerbaijanis) and other nationalities in Iran\n* Promoting balanced and sustainable development across the country, particularly in Turkic-populated regions\n* Building connections with Iranian civil and democratic forces based on principles of peace, non-violence, and political rationality\nPrinciples and Values\nThe center’s founding declaration and official documents outline a set of core principles:\n* Participatory democracy, decentralization of power, and equitable wealth distribution\n* Secularism: freedom of belief and separation of religion from government\n* Gender equality\n* Identity pluralism against racist and assimilationist policies\n* Right to self-determination through a federal republic structure within Iran\n* Environmental protection\n* Individual rights and freedoms\n* Social justice, protection of workers’ rights, and support for labor unions\n* Rights of children, elderly, and people with different physical characteristics\n* Full respect for international law and the principle of peace in international relations\nHistory\nThe Azerbaijan Center for Democracy and Development emerged from several years of dialogue and cooperation among political and civil activists from various ethnic backgrounds inside and outside Iran. Following the initial idea and drafting of its charter, the center was officially established in December 2023.\nCentral Council Members\nThe center’s central council consists of seventeen members. Some notable members include:\n* Alireza Ardabili – Journalist\n* Ayaz Ebadi – Human development researcher\n* Oumay Radmehr – Women’s rights activist\n* Ghazal Rasouli – Intersectional feminist\n* Esmail Jamili – Poet, writer, and cultural activist\n* Afshar Abbasi – PhD in biotechnology and civil activist\n* Amir Mahdipour – Lawyer and human rights activist\n* Pinar Vosoughi – PhD in educational sciences\n* Mamad Ansa – PhD in music\n* Milad Talebi – Civil engineer and civil activist\nActivities\nIn its initial months, the center focused on publishing political statements, social analyses, organizing academic and political conferences, and holding specialized training sessions. Key focus areas include:\n* Azerbaijan and the transition to sustainable democracy\n* Regional development and administrative decentralization\n* Identity, language, and ethnic issues\n* Environmental crises, such as Lake Urmia\n* Women’s rights, youth, and minority issues\nViews\nThe center accuses the Islamic Republic of Iran of centralization, structural discrimination, political repression, and chronic economic and environmental crises. Its founding statement asserts:\nThe people of Iran, particularly residents of non-Persian regions, do not have equal opportunities. The linguistic, cultural, and social rights of Turks (Azerbaijanis) have long been ignored. A priority for the center is to facilitate a peaceful transition while avoiding ethnic tension and civil conflict in Iran.\nRelations with Other Groups\nThe center has declared its readiness to cooperate with other democratic forces in Iran, including national, civil, and human rights groups, based on principles of peace, non-violence, and political rationality.\nCriticism\nAs of Nov 2025, no specific criticism has been published by official institutions or independent groups regarding the center's activities. However, its decentralization stance and advocacy for linguistic rights may face opposition from centralist nationalist currents in Iran.\nReferences\n* [https://azdemocracy.org/%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87%DB%8C-%DA%A9%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%AF%D9%85%D9%88%DA%A9%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B3%DB%8C-%D9%88-%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B9%D9%87-%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7/#03 \"Official founding statement of the Azerbaijan Center for Democracy and Development\"], Official website, December 2023.\n* [https://azdemocracy.org/%d9%85%d8%b1%d8%a7%d9%85%d9%86%d8%a7%d9%85%d9%87-%da%a9%d8%a7%d9%86%d9%88%d9%86-%d8%af%d9%85%d9%88%da%a9%d8%b1%d8%a7%d8%b3%db%8c-%d9%88-%d8%aa%d9%88%d8%b3%d8%b9%d9%87-%d8%a2%d8%b0%d8%b1%d8%a8%d8%a7/ \"Charter\"], Official website of the center.\n* [https://azdemocracy.org/%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87%DB%8C-%DA%A9%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%AF%D9%85%D9%88%DA%A9%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B3%DB%8C-%D9%88-%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B9%D9%87-%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7/#02 \"Spokesperson and members of the Central Council\"], Azerbaijan Center.\nExternal Links\n* Web Site: https://azdemocracy.org/\n* Twitter/X: https://x.com/AzDemocracy"
