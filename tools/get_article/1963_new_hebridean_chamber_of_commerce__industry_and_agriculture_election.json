They were the first elections in the territory's history.\nBackground\nAn Advisory Council was set up in 1958, with all members appointed. A 20-member Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture was subsequently created in 1963, with 12 members appointed by the British and French Resident Commissioners (eight from the indigenous population and four Europeans) and eight elected European members, four from the agriculture sector and four from the commerce and industry sector. The right to vote was limited to people with a trading licence, and only around 230 people – mostly Europeans – were eligible to vote.\nResults\n{| class=wikitable\n!Type\n!Member\n|-\n|rowspan=4|Elected Europeans(agriculture)||Gabriel des Granges\n|-\n|J.
