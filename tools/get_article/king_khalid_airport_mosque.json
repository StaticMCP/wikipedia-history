Built in 1983, the mosque covers an area of  in a hexagonal plan and was designed by the US-based architectural firm HOK. It incorporates elements of traditional Islamic architecture and primarily serves Muslim passengers arriving or departing through Riyadh.\nOverview\nThe mosque was constructed alongside the King Khalid International Airport by American architectural firm, HOK, in 1983. It was opened to worshippers in 1984.\nBesides weekly Friday prayers, the mosque also hosts the annual Salat al-Eid prayers in its precincts during the Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha occasions.\nThe airport was the first in Saudi Arabia to be built to then-contemporary engineering standards and the mosque was at the time of its construction the most modern mosque in the world, notable for its use of advances in construction and engineering to create a modern complex in a vernacular Arabic style, and for its program of integral art, at that time the largest in the world, marrying traditional Islamic decorative elements with, and interpreted through, the work of contemporary artists.\nThe King Khalid International Airport offers free shuttle services to the mosque for arriving and departing passengers.\nArchitecture\nHexagonal in plan, and enclosing an area of over , its scale, location and design make it the most dominant building in the passenger complex. The mosque can accommodate 5,000 worshippers inside, with capacity for an additional 4,000 in the surrounding plaza. The mosque's dome,  in diameter and internally clad in polished bronze, is internally separated from the lower roof of the building by a  clerestory ring of stained glass windows, below which runs a calligraphic mosaic band designed by Iranian-Armenian painter Edman Ayvazyan. The dome's apex, at  above the arrivals level roadway, is higher than all the other structures in the passenger complex with the exception of the airport control tower and the mosque's minaret.\nThe hand-cut glass and marble mosaic, measuring  and fabricated with the assistance of Brian Clarke, a British architectural artist, was the largest in the world. At the time of its construction, the programme of decorative and integral art for the mosque constituted one of the largest single art projects of the period. In the northeast corner of the mosque plaza, a minaret rises  above the plaza level. A spiral stairway inside the minaret provides access to loudspeakers that broadcast the prayer calls five times daily. There are  of floor space on the main floor of the mosque and another  on the mezzanine floor. A Koranic library off of the main mosque floor has  of user space and the same amount for storage space. The library, private offices, and lavatories are located along the southeast on the southwest walls.\nIn 1982, through the Vesti Corporation, Brian Clarke was commissioned to conceive of a scheme of stained glass artworks for the interior of the Royal Mosque. Clarke made a study of Islamic ornament at the Quran schools in Fez and Tangiers for six weeks, and produced a series of abstract designs that engaged with historical pan-Islamic decorative tradition. Completed in 1982 and containing , the interior of the mosque features artwork, carved marble banks, stained-glass windows and skylights, intricate ceramic-tile patterns, and carved wooden doors and screens which make it a showplace of traditional Islamic art. Passages from the Quran are also carved in the Kufic style of calligraphy form the unifying motif.\nSee also\n}}\n* Islam in Saudi Arabia\n* List of mosques in Saudi Arabia\n* List of things named after Saudi kings\nReferences\nExternal links"
