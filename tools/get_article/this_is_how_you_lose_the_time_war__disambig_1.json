It was first published by Simon & Schuster. It won the BSFA Award for Best Shorter Fiction, the 2019 Nebula Award for Best Novella, the 2020 Locus Award for Best Novella, the 2020 Hugo Award for Best Novella, and the 2020 Ignyte Award for Best Novella.\nPlot\nAgents Red and Blue travel back and forth through time, altering the history of multiple universes on behalf of their warring empires, whose timelines are mutually exclusive. In secret, the two begin leaving each other messages — initially taunting, but gradually developing into flirtation, and then love. When Red's commanding officer detects the interaction between Red and Blue, she forces Red to send Blue a message that will poison her when read. Even though Red warns Blue of the danger, she reads the message and succumbs to the poison anyway, fearing Red’s treason will be discovered if she does not.\nSome time later, Red, now listless and distraught, finds another message hinting that Blue faked her own death. Red returns to each point in their correspondence and collects traces of Blue’s DNA from her letters, allowing her to sneak into Blue's empire and give her immunity to the poison during childhood, an episode related in an earlier letter. This incident is discovered and Red is arrested by her own empire; the day before her scheduled execution, Red receives a final letter from Blue indicating that she is breaking her out of prison and inviting her to fight together against both their empires.\nWriting process\nRed's letters were written entirely by Gladstone, and Blue's by El-Mohtar. Although they wrote a general outline beforehand, \"the reactions of each character were developed with a genuine element of surprise on receiving each letter, and the scenes accompanying [the letters] were written using that emotional response\".\nReception\nPublishers Weekly called This Is How You Lose the Time War \"exquisitely crafted\" and \"dazzling\", with \"increasingly intricate wordplay\", and stated that it \"warrants multiple readings\". NPRs Jason Sheehan compared it to the film The Lake House (if one \"strapped [The Lake House] up in body armor, covered it with razors, dipped it in poison and set it loose to murder and burn its way across worlds and centuries\"), and said that the book makes a virtue of what he felt to be the characteristic weaknesses of both the time travel genre and the epistolary format.\nCheryl Morgan argued that its central message—\"soldiers on either side of a war often have far more in common with each other than they do with the people who sit safely at home and issue orders\"—is one \"that the world needs to hear\". Tor.com's Lee Mandelo found in the book \"a poetic internal structure\", prose that was \"sharp, almost crisp\" rather than \"lush\", and a \"focus [which] remains on the personal as opposed to the global\"; Mandelo also observed that it \"has an argument to make—several, actually—about conflict, love, and resistance\", and treats the time war as \"an object lesson, a conceit, the unending and reason-less conflict that consumes generations, centuries, now and forever.\"\nDen of Geeks Natalie Zutter praised the novel's approach to gender identity: Red and Blue \"both use she/her pronouns, but neither fits the heteronormative mold of femininity\"; each of them \"performs gender in a dozen different ways\", such that \"[t]he more that Blue and Red appear in different forms, the less their gender actually matters.\"\nAt Strange Horizons, Adri Joy  lauded the novel as \"an absolute emotional masterpiece, sending readers on a gut-wrenching feelings rollercoaster of the highest calibre.\"  She noted that \"the Time War itself [...] is largely incomprehensible beyond its most basic points\", but specified that \"every little aside of... description works to set the scene in the most effective possible way\", including the \"impermanence\" of the messages delivered between Red and Blue.\nBlack Gate found it to be neither \"a riddle to parse\" nor \"a tangled, hard sci-fi puzzle-box of time travel to unravel\", with its final revelation being \"fairly obvious from the first chapter\", but emphasized that the revelation in question was nonetheless \"quite emotionally fulfilling\", ultimately concluding that \"it's fun to watch goddesses fall in love [...] and Blue and Red feel very much human.\"\nAwards\nThis Is How You Lose the Time War won the BSFA Award for Best Shorter Fiction, the Nebula Award for Best Novella of 2019, the 2020 Locus Award for Best Novella, the 2020 Hugo Award for Best Novella, the 2020 Aurora Award for Best Short Fiction, the 2020 Ignyte Award for Best Novella, and was a finalist for the 2019 Shirley Jackson Award in the Novella category. Additionally, it was a finalist for the inaugural Ray Bradbury Award for Science Fiction, Fantasy & Speculative Fiction at the 2019 Los Angeles Times Book Prizes; and for the 2019 Kitschies in the Novel category; and achieved second place in the 2020 Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award.\nSocial media\nIn May 2023, three years after its release, This Is How You Lose the Time War received an unexpected boost in popularity, ascending Amazon's bestseller rankings to number three overall and number one in science fiction. This was because of a series of viral tweets by a fan of the manga and anime series Trigun with the display name \"bigolas dickolas wolfwood\" who recommended the book to their followers. \"I do not understand what is happening but I am incomprehensibly grateful to bigolas dickolas\", El-Mohtar wrote in response. \"Wolfwood\" was subsequently nominated for the 2024 Hugo Award for Best Related Work for their tweets, but declined to appear on the ballot.\nAdaptation\nEl-Mohtar announced in 2019 that the book has been optioned for television, with scripts to be written by herself and Gladstone. She also specified that the genders of the characters \"are not up for negotiation\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.cbc.ca/books/this-is-how-you-lose-the-time-war-1.5214675 Audio interview with Amal El-Mohtar], at CBC.ca"
