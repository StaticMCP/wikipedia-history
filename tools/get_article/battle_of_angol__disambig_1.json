A Mapuche detachment located themselves in a third position awaiting reinforcements from their main body at the old position. Seeing that this position was weak the Spanish engaged this position. In the battle the Spanish drove the Mapuche out of their pukara and pursued them down to the river bank and drove them into the river, where they were trapped and 1,000 Mapuches were killed, including the toqui Illanguelén.\nHistory\nIn Los Infantes captain Lorenzo Bernal del Mercado had discovered that the rebels had constructed a pukara close by, establishing a blockade of the city. Lorenzo Bernal ordered a reconnaissance patrol and he observed that the natives under the toqui Illangulién had chosen an impregnable position in a marsh and chose to retire. Illangulién's troops then moved to a second position, nearer to Angol, to which captain Lorenzo Bernal responded with a new reconnaissance.\nFinding that this new position also was impregnable he again retired. Feeling victorious and believing the destruction of Angol was imminent, a Mapuche detachment located themselves in a third position awaiting reinforcements from their main body at the old position. This time, seeing their dangerous proximity to Los Infantes, captain Bernal chose to attack the position before more Mapuches arrived. In the battle the Spanish drove the Mapuche out of their pukara and pursued them down to the river bank and drove them into the river, where they were trapped and 1,000 Mapuches were killed, including the toqui Illanguelén, and many more were wounded or captured. Bernal ordered some of the captives killed and others lost hands or feet. When the news reached the rest of the Mapuche army coming to attack Angol, they dispersed.\nReferences\nSources\n* Alonso de Góngora Marmolejo, [http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/FichaObra.html?Ref=1102&portal=157  Historia de Todas las Cosas que han Acaecido en el Reino de Chile y de los que lo han gobernado (1536-1575) (History of All the Things that Have happened in the Kingdom of Chile and of those that have governed it (1536-1575))], Edición digital a partir de Crónicas del Reino de Chile, Madrid, Atlas, 1960, pp.&nbsp;75–224, (on line in Spanish)\n** [http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/bameric/02582741011358306311291/p0000003.htm#I_47_  Capítulo XLVI De cómo se juntaron los indios de la comarca de Angol y vinieron sobre la ciudad por tres partes, y fueron desbaratados por el capitán Lorenzo Bernal]\n* Pedro Mariño de Lobera, [http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/13582842323460728544424/index.htm  Crónica del Reino de Chile, escrita por el capitán Pedro Mariño de Lobera....reducido a nuevo método y estilo por el Padre Bartolomé de Escobar.
