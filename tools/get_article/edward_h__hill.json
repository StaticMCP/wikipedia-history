Hill (c. 1844–1904) was a physician who founded Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston, Maine.\nHe was born in Harrison, Maine in about 1844 and attended Bridgton Academy, Bates College (1863) (then called the Maine State Seminary) and Harvard Medical School (1867). After initially starting to practice in Durham, Maine, he shortly moved to Lewiston where he became a partner of Alonzo Garcelon, a future governor and developed an active surgery practice. Seeing a need for an emergency room in the Lewiston and Auburn area, in 1871 Hill published an article advocating for a public hospital. After the city failed to act for several years, Hill purchased a house and land for a hospital himself and transferred it to the hospital corporation. The legislature finally provided support in 1888, thereby officially creating Central Maine Hospital (later renamed Central Maine Medical Center). Hill was an active member of the Maine Medical Society where he presented a well known paper on “Perineal Urethrotomy” in 1885.  After severe suffering from arthritis for over a decade, he died in 1904. In 1872  Hill married Charlotte C. Thompson, and they had two children.\nReferences"
