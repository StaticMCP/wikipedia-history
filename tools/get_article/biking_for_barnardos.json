Their route took them through France, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Ukraine, Russia (three times), Kazakhstan, Mongolia and the USA. They returned to Morecambe on 4 October 2008, having successfully completed the circumnavigation.\nCiting inspiration from Ted Simon's ''Jupiter's Travels'' and Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman's Long Way Round. The route they followed is similar (but not identical to) the route of Long Way Round, however, unlike Long Way Round, there was no support crew and a very modest budget.\nBikes\nSnelling and Murphy rode identical Suzuki V-Strom 650 motorcycles with few modifications apart from luggage. Because of their tight budget, they did not use off road tyres at any point.\nExternal links\n*http://www.bikingforbarnardos.com/\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20110718164115/http://www.suzuki-gb.co.uk/onroad/news/000845/"
