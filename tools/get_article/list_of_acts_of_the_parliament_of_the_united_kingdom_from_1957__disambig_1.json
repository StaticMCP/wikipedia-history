For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\n5 & 6 Eliz. 2\nContinuing the second session of the 41st Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 6 November 1956 until 1 November 1957.\nPublic general acts\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  as to the sufficiency of the Commission's revenue to meet revenue charges, to authorise advances out of the Consolidated Fund of sums so borrowed, and for purposes connected therewith.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  in connection with such applications in so far as any such extensions may have been invalid;
