In February 2017 Bonhôte, and Ettedgui proposed their idea to several film distributors. The film was financed within three days, and director Ian Bonhôte added, \"We wanted to make a really respectful cinematic version of Lee’s story\".\nThe production team took the project, with \"zero access and zero original archive at our fingertips\", and worked 18-20 hour days for a year to finish the project.\nReception\nBox office\nMcQueen grossed $868,544 in the United Kingdom, and grossed $205,045 in Australia, for a total worldwide gross of $2,638,552.

The website's critical consensus reads, \"McQueen offers an intimate, well-sourced, and overall moving look at a young life and brilliant career that were tragically cut short.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 84 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating \"Universal acclaim\".\nPeter Travers of the Rolling Stone wrote, \"McQueen is an empathetic, ravishing and scorchingly outspoken look at why, eight years after his death, he still leaves us transfixed\". Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post wrote, \"McQueen” makes the case that its subject was an artist whose clay was clothing. It also, despite giving short shrift to psychoanalysis, reminds us that everything you might want to know about the artist can be found in the art\". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"If you live and die for fashion, a documentary called “McQueen” could tell only one story, that of designer Alexander McQueen, whose extraordinary gifts, dark preoccupations and tragic death make for a completely engrossing, compulsively watchable film\".\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Award\n!Category\n!Result\n!Refs.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |2018\n|Tribeca Film Festival\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Best Documentary\n|\n|\n|-\n|Transatlantyk Festival\n|\n|\n|-\n|Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival\n|Best Social Political Documentary\n|\n|\n|-\n|Hamburg Film Festival\n|Best Feature\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" |2019\n|GALECA: The Society of LGBTQ Entertainment Critics\n|LGBTQ Documentary of the Year\n|\n|\n|-\n|Motion Picture Sound Editors\n|Golden Reel Award\n|\n|\n|-\n|London Critics Circle Film Awards\n|Documentary of the Year\n|\n|\n|-\n|International Film Music Critics Award (IFMCA)\n|Best Original Score for a Documentary Film (IFMCA Award)\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |British Academy Film Awards\n|Outstanding British Film of the Year\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|Best Documentary\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
