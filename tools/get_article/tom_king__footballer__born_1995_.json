He went on to make 20 appearances for the \"Wings\", before he was recalled by Millwall on 21 December.\nKing returned to the National League on 19 February 2016, joining Braintree Town for an initial 28-day emergency loan. In his second appearance for the club, against Guiseley at Nethermoor Park, King became involved in a controversial incident during an 1–1 draw. He conceded the equalising goal after Oliver Norburn broke a fair play protocol and lobbed him from 30-yards out rather than passing the ball to him, after Braintree had kicked the ball into touch to allow an injured Braintree player to receive treatment; a five-minute fracas followed but the goal was allowed to stand after security staff separated the players and management, and Guiseley manager Mark Bower refused to allow Braintree to walk through and score. Bower went on to say: \"Their keeper stood there with his arms in the air and allowed the ball to into the net. It put us in a really difficult position whether we should allow them to score or not but we decided no. I think their keeper was trying to be clever and had simply let the ball go in.\" King said he was \"bewildered\" by Bower's statement, and speaking on the incident itself said that: \"It is one of those things that will be remembered for a long time, I'll be remembered for a long time and it will carry on forever\". The incident was described as \"one of the biggest on-field controversies seen in non-league football\", and Braintree manager Danny Cowley said that: \"it's the worst thing I've seen on a football pitch and it was disgraceful unsporting behaviour on their part\". The following week, Guiseley chairman Phil Rogerson released a statement recognising the fair-play convention had not been followed: \"... myself, Mark [Bower] and the club find the situation most regrettable and not in line with the general ethos of Guiseley AFC. Fair play is and always has been at the heart of the club. The decision to continue playing as normal after the goal was taken on the spur of the moment and under extreme pressure, not helped at all by the heated atmosphere.\" King went on to extend his loan at Cressing Road until the end of the 2015–16 season, and Braintree qualified for the play-offs, losing out to Grimsby Town at the semi-final stage following a 2–1 aggregate defeat.\nKing made his first team debut for Millwall in a 2–1 defeat to Nottingham Forest in an EFL Cup Second Round match at The Den on 23 August 2016.\nKing signed an 18-month contract extension with Millwall on 4 January 2018. On the same day, he joined League Two side Stevenage on loan for the rest of the 2017–18 season. King made his debut for Stevenage two days after signing, keeping a clean sheet in the club's 0–0 home draw with Reading in the Third Round of the FA Cup.\nOn 27 June 2018 King joined AFC Wimbledon on a season long loan. King started the season as first choice goalkeeper but soon fell behind the Dons reserve goalkeeper Joe McDonnell in the pecking order as the Dons struggled at the bottom of the table. His season-long loan was cut short when recalled by Millwall in January having started only 11 League games for the Dons, who had already replaced him with the loan of Aaron Ramsdale on loan from Bournemouth.\nNewport County\nOn 7 June 2019, King joined League Two club Newport County on a two-year contract. On 3 August 2019 he made his debut for Newport in a 2–2 draw against Mansfield Town, saving a second half penalty. In September 2019, King was nominated for the August PFA League Two Player of the Month Award, after five successive clean sheets, and more than 500 minutes of football played without conceding for the South Wales side, who had climbed to second place in the league.\nKing scored the first goal of his career on 19 January 2021, with a wind-assisted goal kick in the 12th minute of Newport's 1–1 League Two draw at Cheltenham Town. On 21 January 2021, his goal was confirmed to have broken the Guinness World Record for longest football goal, with a distance of , a record previously held, since November 2013, by Asmir Begović. King played for Newport in the League Two playoff final at Wembley Stadium on 31 May 2021 which Newport lost to Morecambe, 1–0 after a 107th-minute penalty. On 4 June 2021 it was announced that he would leave Newport County at the end of the 2020–21 season, following the expiration of his contract.\nSalford City\nOn 7 July 2021, Salford City confirmed that they had signed King on a two-year deal.\nNorthampton Town\nOn 14 January 2023, King signed for fellow League Two club Northampton Town on a six-month deal after agreeing a release from his Salford contract. Having been dropped for Alex Cairns, King's availability arrived at a good moment for Northampton due to an injury to Lee Burge.\nWolverhampton Wanderers\nOn 3 July 2023, King joined Wolverhampton Wanderers on a free transfer following his release from Northampton Town. He featured as a 78th minute substitute in a friendly against Stade Rennais in Wolves' 3–1 win. This marked his debut for the club. In February 2024 King signed a two-year contract extension with Wolves. King made his Premier League debut for Wolves at the age of 30 in the 1–1 draw against Brentford on 25 May 2025 as a second half substitute.\nEverton\nOn 15 August 2025 King joined Everton on a two year contract.\nInternational career\nKing was capped by England at under-16 and under-17 level. He also qualified for Wales as his mother was born in Cardiff as well as being eligible for Gibraltar through residency, having spent several years there as a child, where he first started playing football in the youth ranks at Manchester United (Gibraltar).\nOn 7 November 2019, King was called up to the Wales national football team for the first time for the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying matches against Azerbaijan and Hungary. In August 2021, following the withdrawal of Adam Davies due to a positive COVID-19 test, King was called up in the squad for the September international fixtures—a friendly against Finland and 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Belarus and Estonia.\nOn 6 June 2024, King finally made his international debut for Wales in a friendly match against Gibraltar, coming on as a substitute for Adam Davies in a 0–0 draw.\nCareer statistics\nClub\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Club\n!rowspan=2|Season\n!colspan=3|League\n!colspan=2|FA Cup\n!colspan=2|EFL Cup\n!colspan=2|Other\n!colspan=2|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=6|Millwall\n|2014–15\n|Championship\n|0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=2|—||0||0\n|-\n|2015–16\n|League One\n|0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0\n|-\n|2016–17\n|League One\n|11||0||1||0||1||0||4||0||17||0\n|-\n|2017–18\n|Championship\n|0||0||0||0||2||0||colspan=2|—||2||0\n|-\n|2018–19\n|Championship\n|0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=2|—||0||0\n|-\n!colspan=2|Total\n!11||0||1||0||3||0||4||0||19||0\n|-\n|Welling United (loan)\n|2015–16\n|National League\n|20||0||0||0||colspan=2|—||0||0||20||0\n|-\n|Braintree Town (loan)\n|2015–16\n|National League\n|16||0||0||0||colspan=2|—||2||0||18||0\n|-\n|Stevenage (loan)\n|2017–18\n|League Two\n|18||0||2||0||0||0||0||0||20||0\n|-\n|AFC Wimbledon (loan)\n|2018–19\n|League One\n|12||0||0||0||2||0||2||0||16||0\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Newport County\n|2019–20\n|League Two\n|31||0||2||0||0||0||2||0||35||0\n|-\n|2020–21\n|League Two\n|9||1||2||0||1||0||2||0||14||1\n|-\n!colspan=2|Total\n!40||1||4||0||1||0||4||0||49||1\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Salford City\n|2021–22\n|League Two\n|36||0||1||0||1||0||0||0||38||0\n|-\n|2022–23\n|League Two\n|21||0||2||0||1||0||2||0||26||0\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n!57||0||3||0||2||0||2||0||64||0\n|-\n|Northampton Town\n|2022–23\n|League Two\n|7||0||colspan=2|—||colspan=2|—||colspan=2|—||7||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\" |Career total\n!181||1||10||0||8||0||14||0||213||1\n|}\nInternational\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by national team and year\n|-\n!National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|Wales\n|2024||1||0\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total!!1!!0\n|}\nHonours\nMillwall\n*EFL League One play-offs: 2017\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.wolves.co.uk/teams/mens-first-team/tom-king/ Profile] at the Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. website\n*"
