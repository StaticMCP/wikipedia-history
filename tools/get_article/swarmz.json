He was featured on \"Houdini\" with KSI and Tion Wayne which reached number 6 in the UK Singles Chart. He then began releasing diss tracks to coincide with his boxing career starting with \"KSI Diss Track.\"\nHe made his boxing debut as a last minute replacement for KSI at MF & DAZN: X Series 001 and lost via 2nd round knockout. He returned and fought Ryan Taylor at X Series 004 and won via 1st round technical knockout. He then fought Deji Olatunji at X Series 007 and lost via unanimous decision. He then fought BDave, NichLmao and Ryan Johnston in a survival tag match at X Series 008. He was scheduled to rematch Taylor at X Series 10 – The Prime Card, but on October 11, 2023, Taylor was reportedly arrested, forcing him to pull of the fight, and leaving Ed Matthews to step in as a last-minute replacement. He lost via knockout in the first round.\nEarly and personal life\nBrandon Scott was born in the borough of Greenwich, London. He is of Barbadian and\nJamaican descent. During his childhood, Scott was heavily inspired by the music his family was listening to, including a variety of Jamaican artists. By the time he was attending school, he and his friends had started rapping.\nOn 24 May 2020, Scott was involved in a car crash near London's Trafalgar Square. A Ferrari 488 rented for a music video shoot crashed into a London bus on Northumberland Avenue. After the crash, he posted videos of the smashed car onto his Instagram account. No injuries were sustained and no arrests were made.\nFootball career\nScott is a lifelong Arsenal supporter. During his teenage years, Scott was a talented footballer and played for the youth academies of Fulham, Charlton Athletic and Southend United. While at Southend, he had a short loan spell at National League South club East Thurrock United. He was then released by Southend in 2016.\nAfter being released, Scott signed for Isthmian League side Cray Wanderers. In 2017, Scott signed for National League South club Whitehawk. In 2018, he quit football to pursue his music career.\nMusic career\n2017–2022: Early releases and breakout\nScott started making music as a hobby alongside his youth football career.  He originally started making freestyles on SoundCloud, where he went by the name Swarmzy-B, which he later shortened to Swarmz when he started making music professionally. He released his first video, titled \"Money\" in 2017 which picked up over 200k views on YouTube. He then released another single, titled \"Murda\" in early 2018.  His breakthrough single, \"Lyca\", was released later that year.  After the single went viral, he was signed to Virgin Records. The artist then proceeded to become a well-known name after releasing tracks such as \"Bally\" and \"Motorola\" which were brought to light after encouragement from friend Red Jackson.\nIn March 2020, Scott featured alongside Tion Wayne in KSI's single \"Houdini\", which reached number 6 in the UK Singles Chart.\n2022–present: Break and boxing diss tracks\nIn August 2022, Scott was scheduled to face KSI in a boxing match after Alex Wassabi withdrew, thus leading to Scott taking an indefinite break from his music career. On 16 August, Scott released a diss track to promote the bout directly at KSI titled \"KSI Diss Track.\" On 7 January 2023, Scott released \"Redemption\", a diss track aimed at YouTuber Ryan Taylor ahead of their bout on 14 January. On 10 May, Scott released a diss track aimed at YouTuber Deji Olatunji ahead of their bout on 13 May.\nBoxing career\nSwarmz vs KSI\nOn 7 August 2022, it was announced that Scott would be participating in a MF-professional boxing match against English YouTuber KSI at The O2 Arena, in London as the headliner for MF & DAZN: X Series 001. Originally, KSI was scheduled to face Alex Wassabi, however, due to a concussion, Wassabi was replaced by Scott whom had previously called out KSI on a TikTok live. However, Scott's bout with KSI was lowered to the opening bout as it was announced that KSI would be fighting twice on X Series 001, now headlining against Mexican professional boxer Luis Alcaraz Pineda. KSI defeated Scott via first round knockout and won the inaugural MFB cruiserweight title.\nScott was scheduled to return to the ring against English YouTuber Kristen Hanby on the undercard of X Series 002 at the Sheffield Arena in Sheffield on 15 October, but withdrew on 28 September as Scott required \"more time to prepare.\"\nSwarmz vs Taylor\nOn 5 December, Scott's return was announced against English BMX YouTuber Ryan Taylor on the undercard of X Series 004 at Wembley Arena in London on 14 January 2024. Scott won the bout via first-round technical knockout after Taylor suffered an eye injury and was forced to quit after two minutes and twelve seconds. On 10 February, it was announced that Scott had signed a multi-fight deal with Misfits Boxing.\nSwarmz vs Deji\nAfter his bout with Taylor, Swarmz proceeded to call out YouTubers King Kenny and KSI's younger brother Deji Olatunji. On 13 April 2024 the bout between Scott and Olatunji was announced as the co-feature for X Series 007 at Wembley Arena in London on 14 May. Olatunji defeated Scott via unanimous decision.\nSurvivor Tag\nOn 14 June, it was announced that Scott would compete in the first ever survivor tag crossover boxing match between three other fighters as the headliner for X Series 008 at the Nashville Municipal Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee, US on 22 July. The bout included Singaporean YouTuber NichLmao, American YouTuber BDave and Canadian YouTuber Ryan Johnston. NichLmao won the bout via a points decision victory securing 117 points.\nSwarmz vs Matthews\nOn 23 September, during the broadcast of X Series 009, it was announced that Scott and Taylor would have a rematch on the X Series 10 – The Prime Card preliminary card at Manchester Arena in Manchester on 14 October. The pair got into a brawl during their face off where Scott mentioned Taylor's child. However, on 11 October, Taylor was forced to withdraw from the bout after getting arrested. On 12 October, English TikToker Ed Matthews was announced as the replacement opponent. Matthews defeated Scott via first round knockout after thirty seconds. Scott later revealed he fractured his ankle during the bout.\nSwarmz vs Pineda\nAfter Scott had his bout with Olatunji at X Series 007, Luis Alcaraz Pineda called out Scott to a bout in the ring. On 21 November 2024, it was announced that Scott would return to the ring against Pineda—the same opponent KSI fought on the night when Scott was defeated by KSI—on the X Series 19 – Qatar: The Supercard Misfits Kick-Offs at the Lusail Sports Arena in Doha, Qatar on 28 November. Pineda defeated Scott via unanimous decision.\nDiscography\nSingles\nAs lead artist\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20em;\" | Title\n!
