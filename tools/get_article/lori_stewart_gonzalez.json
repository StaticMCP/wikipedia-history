She delivered maiden speeches and toured the facilities at each regionalized campus to promote a \"one university\" organizational model and strengthen bonds with each of their unique towns; and she instituted University Updates, a monthly announcement and forum session held at the Baker University Center to provide administrative insights and share in community dialogues.  Her first year's efforts were favorable with the Board of Trustees, and they voted to give her a raise.\nReferences"
