Another cause of controversy was that the series was filmed in English and then dubbed into Spanish. Finally,  there were irregularities with the credits, with some scriptwriters who were named on the script for the pilot episode do not feature on the show's credits, or have a page on IMDb.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/reinas/ List of complete seasons]"
