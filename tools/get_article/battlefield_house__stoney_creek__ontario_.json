It was built in 1796. The house and  of parkland (Battlefield Park), were the property of the Women's Wentworth Historical Society, (1899-1962), and given by this society to the Niagara Parks Commission on January 19, 1962.  The park was designated a National Historic Site in 1960.\nNestled under the Niagara Escarpment, this historic site is located on  of park land linked to the Bruce Trail. Also located on the property are the Battlefield Monument and the Grandview (Nash-Jackson House) building. Smith's Knoll Cemetery is also nearby, across King Street East from the park. During the first weekend in June, a re-enactment of the Battle of Stoney Creek is held with re-enactors in full regalia, representing both the British and American sides. The 2016 event was the 35th such re-enactment.\nThe re-enactments scheduled for 2020 and 2021 were cancelled due to the covid-19 pandemic. In mid-May 2022 it was revealed that the upcoming re-enactment would also be cancelled due to \"uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 restrictions\" and construction taking place at Battlefield House, but would return in 2023. However, at a meeting held on May 19, it was revealed that the re-enactment would be \"permanently\" cancelled.  Friends of Battlefield Museum withdrew its support for the museum following the meeting.  As of 2025, the Re-enactments have been restarted, and the 2025 events are scheduled for the weekend of June 7-8, 2025 at Battlefield House and Park.\nBritish units made a night attack on an American encampment. Due in large part to the capture of both American brigadier generals by Sgt Alexander Fraser, and an overestimation of British strength by the Americans, the battle was a victory for the British, and a turning point in the defence of Upper Canada.\nThe museum is affiliated with: CMA,  CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.\nFile:Battlefield Museum.JPG\nFile:Battle of Stoney Creek.JPG|Battle of Stoney Creek\nFile:Battlefield House A.JPG|Stoney Creek Battlefield House\nFile:Battlefield Park.JPG|Battlefield Park Entrance\nFile:War of 1812 Re-enactment, Battle of Stoney Creek (ontario); June 2016.jpg|Re-enactors (in UK uniforms) fire muskets toward the \"Americans\" in annual commemorations\nFile:Battlefield House in Stoney Creek (I0005660).tif|Battlefield House in Stoney Creek, 1959\nFile:Battlefield House in Stoney Creek (I0005661).tif|Battlefield House in Stoney Creek, 1959\nSee also\n* List of attractions in Hamilton, Ontario\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.battlefieldhouse.ca/ Battlefield House Museum & Park (Official Site)]\n*[http://www.hamilton.ca/attractions/hamilton-civic-museums/battlefield-house-museum-park-national-historic-site Hamilton Civic Museums]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080516091702/http://www.visit1812.com/historic-sites/BattlefieldHouseMuseumand.html Official War of 1812 Bicentennial website: Battlefield House]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080705012512/http://www.generalbrock.com/pages/buzz/1003.html \"Musket escapes fiery end; finds a home at Stoney Creek Battlefield House Museum.\" (www.GeneralBrock.com)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080720004727/http://www.galafilm.com/1812/e/people/green.html Battle of 1812- People & Stories: Billy Green]\n*[http://www.hamiltonpostcards.com/pages/stoneycreek.html Vintage Hamilton Postcards: Battlefield House]\n*[http://www.torontoghosts.org/hamilton/battlefieldhouse.htm Ontario Ghosts & Hauntings Research Society: Battlefield House]"
