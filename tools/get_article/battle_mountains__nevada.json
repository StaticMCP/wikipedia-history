The communities of Battle Mountain and Valmy lie just to the east and north respectively along Interstate 80 in the Humboldt River valley. Nevada State Route 305 runs along the southeast side of the range from Battle Mountain toward Austin to the south.\nThe range is roughly circular in shape and exhibits radial drainage. The Humboldt River Valley lies to the northeast with the Sheep Creek Range beyond. To the northwest and west is Buffalo Valley with Buffalo Mountain and the Tobin Range beyond. The Fish Creek Range lies to the southwest and the Reese River Valley and Shoshone Range to the southeast.\nPeaks\nNamed peaks include:\n{| style=\"width: 60%; height: 200px\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n| Peak || Peak elevation || Coordinates\n|-\n| North Peak ||  || 40° 40′ 31″ N 117° 08′ 00″ W\n|-\n|  Antler Peak ||  || 40° 35′ 57″ N 117° 08′ 03″ W\n|-\n| Long Peak ||  || 40° 37′ 08″ N 117° 06′ 08″ W\n|-\n| Chessor Mountain ||  || 40° 31′ 59″ N 117° 06′ 09″ W\n|-\n| Elephant Head ||  || 40° 36′ 42″ N 117° 01′ 09″ W\n|}\nMining in the Battle Mountains\nThe range has a long history of mining following the original discovery in 1866. The earliest mining was around the old mining camp of Copper Basin in Long Canyon which lies  west of the current town of Battle Mountain. The Copper Basin area was the original location of the Battle Mountain mining camp which later moved to the current location on the Humboldt as a mining support town. To the southwest about  in Galena Canyon, the mining camps of Bannock, Copper Canyon and Galena were later developed  with the Bannock camp established in 1909.\nThe area produced copper, gold, silver, antimony, lead, zinc, tungsten, molybdenum, arsenic, turquoise, and nickel. The Marigold Gold mine is located in the north end of the range.\nReferences"
