It is a sequel to the 1991 game King of the Monsters. In this game, three of the previous game's surviving monsters return and battle across the globe against giant alien monsters that threaten the Earth. The game was later ported to the Super NES and Sega Genesis by Takara.\nPlot\nThree years after the events of the first game, only three monsters have survived what is known in history books as the \"King of the Monsters Massacre\". They have become more advanced and dangerous than ever before. But now in 1999, a powerful alien monster and his wave of minions threaten to conquer the Earth. The surviving monsters must defeat the alien menace and once again prove who is the King of the Monsters.\nGameplay\nPlayers choose one of 3 monsters for battle, and two players can join forces to fight the monsters together. Unlike the previous game this game features side scrolling levels in areas around the world which ends in a boss battle. During the boss battle the same kind of button mashing that was featured in the first game to win grapples returns.\nThe game consists of 7 total levels which take place in areas around the World. The game begins in American City followed by French City, Grand Canyon, Desert, Sea Bed, Lava Zone and ends in Enemy Hideout. After the player(s) clear the first 6 levels, they then enter the final stage where they must fight all the bosses again before encountering the final boss of the game. After the final boss is defeated the player(s) must destroy his small remnants within a time limit. If the player(s) fail to do so,  the game has a \"bad ending\", but if the remnants are destroyed within the time limit the player(s) receive the \"good ending\".\nOutside of the levels the game features 2 bonus stages as well as a ranking at the end of the level according to how well the player(s) performed correlating with the number of points the player(s) receive as the end level bonus. These rankings and points are \"Good\" (1000), \"Very Good\" (3000), \"Nice Going\" (5000), \"That's Strong\" (8000), \"Congratulations\" (10,000), \"Ahhhh\" (20,000), \"Great\" (30,000), \"Miraculous\" (40,000), \"Great Player\" (50,000), and \"Mystery Zone!!\" (100,000).\nCharacters\nPlayable Monsters\nThree of the previous game's monsters return with modified bodies, powers, and names.\n*Super Geon:  Geon returns from the first game, now mutated and appearing more dragon-like.\n*Cyber Woo:  Woo returns from the first game now refurbished into a cyborg resembling Mechani-Kong.\n*Atomic Guy:  Astro Guy returns from the first game now more powered up and with a new costume.\nBosses\nThe boss monsters had different names in the Japanese and American/European ports of the game:\n*Huge Keal (Japanese) or Huge Frogger (American/European):  The Stage 1 boss.

The  Genesis version was developed by Betop and differs significantly from the original version of the game. Rather than being a side-scrolling beat 'em up, this version plays like a one on one fighting game. This version also gives the player the ability to play as the various boss monsters. All characters (excluding Famardy) are playable and have all been given special attacks executed using standard fighting game motions. Players must destroy all other monsters, one after the other, without any of the scrolling stages in the Neo-Geo version and then defeat a clone of the player's monster to win the game. This version of the game also takes place in 3 extra cities in Kyoto City, Tokyo City, and Osaka City.\nReception\nSNES: SMD: Neo Geo:\n| EGM = NEOGEO: 23/40SMD: 39/50SNES: 29/40\n| GameFan = 240/300\n| GamePro = NEOGEO: 17/20SMD: 10/20SNES: 11.5/20\n| GameZone = 55/100\n| HC = 89/100\n| NP = 12.5/20\n| ONM = 64/100\n| SUser = 57/100\n| VGCE = NEOGOE: 7/10SMD: 6/10\n| rev1 = Flux\n| rev1Score = 6/10\n| rev2 = Mega\n| rev2Score = 48%\n| rev3 = MegaTech\n| rev3Score = 69%\n}}\nIn Japan, Game Machine listed King of the Monsters 2 on their July 1, 1992 issue as being the eleventh most-successful table arcade unit of the month.
