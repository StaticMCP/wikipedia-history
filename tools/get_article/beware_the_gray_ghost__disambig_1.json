It was directed by series regular Boyd Kirkland and was first aired on November 4, 1992. The episode features guest star Adam West, best known for his portrayal of Batman in the 1960s Batman television series. West plays an actor known for his role as the Gray Ghost, a character that resembles Batman antecedent The Shadow.\nPlot\nThe episode opens with a flashback of a young Bruce Wayne watching The Gray Ghost, a black-and-white television show, and the episode cuts between the flashback and events in the present mirroring the show: a whirring sound is heard, a building is destroyed by an explosion, the Gray Ghost goes into action while Batman does the same in reality, and the police receive a ransom letter in both settings from the villainous \"Mad Bomber\".\nIn the present Batman makes the connection between the explosions and the television show but does not remember the full synopsis. To get information, he tracks down Simon Trent, who portrayed the Gray Ghost and is now unemployed due to typecasting, and short of money as Simon ducks his landlord. Simon's agent Frankie calls him up telling him that he didn't get the part he was auditioning for and that an opportunity will come for him at some point. After Simon trashes the glass containers containing his memorabilia out of frustration, he eventually sells his Gray Ghost costume and other memorabilia to toy shop owner and collector Ted Dymer to make ends meet, but the next morning finds that Batman has returned it and repaired the broken cases with a letter telling him to meet him in an alley. Unsure of handling the case, he gives Batman a copy of the show from his personal archive, as the production copies were destroyed long ago in a vault fire.\nLearning the source of the whirring noises are remote-control toy cars armed with explosives, Bruce realizes the next target will be the Gotham Library. He defends the library and is overwhelmed but rescued by Trent, who is now wearing the Gray Ghost costume.\nAt the Batcave Batman reveals his own treasured collection of Gray Ghost memorabilia, citing his fictional exploits as a strong influence in his own career. However, they discover a captured toy car has Trent's fingerprints on it, implicating Trent in the bombing, but a stunned Trent realizes in horror that the Mad Bomber is Dymer, who is carrying out the attacks to raise money as he is obsessed with toys. Batman and Trent capture Dymer, and indirectly destroy his toy store and weaponry. Dymer then weeps over the loss of his toys.\nTrent is recognized as a real-life hero, prompting a resurgence in the Gray Ghost's popularity. His complete archive of the Gray Ghost series is re-released, providing him with fresh income from distribution, massive increase in the value of his merchandise, and a revitalized career. Bruce visits him at the product launch and asks for an autograph, repeating what he said earlier: the Gray Ghost was, and still is, his childhood hero. Realizing that Bruce is Batman, Trent smiles. The scene then pans upward to show a poster cover of People Magazine with the Gray Ghost's return on the cover with a silhouette of a bat behind him.\nVoice cast\n* Kevin Conroy as Bruce Wayne / Batman and Thomas Wayne (credited)\n* Bob Hastings as Commissioner Gordon\n* Efrem Zimbalist Jr. as Alfred Pennyworth, Piedmont Police Chief (uncredited) and Frankie (uncredited)\n* Mari Devon as Summer Gleeson\n* Joe Leahy as Narrator\n* Bruce W.
