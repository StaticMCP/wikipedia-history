The Selectric was a major step up from the teletypes (TTY) associated with Unix and smaller systems, but still clunky. The video consoles provided with certain models were not considered particularly user friendly, and they ignored two thirds of IBM's mainframe market, DOS and its VSE descendants.\nDOCS  replaced or supplanted the typewriter interface with a video screen. In practice, it worked a little like present-day instant messenger programs (ICQ, QQ, AIM, Adium, iChat, etc.), with a data entry line at the bottom and messages scrolling in real time up the screen. The commands were otherwise identical.\nDOCS was available for DOS, DOS/VS, DOS/VSE, and came packaged with third-party operating systems, such as EDOS from The Computer Software Company, later acquired by Nixdorf.\nPlatforms\nSoftware\nThe product ran under several DOS-related platforms:\n* DOS/VS\n* DOS/VSE\n* DOS, modified\n* EDOS\n* vDOS\nHardware\nSeveral vendors offered DOCS as part of their OS:\n* Amdahl\n* Fujitsu\n* Hitachi\n* Magnuson\n* RCA\nDevelopment\nDOCS was developed by CFS, Inc. of Brookline, Massachusetts at the Kayser-Roth data center in Whitman, Massachusetts. Dick Goran wrote the video interface. Leigh Lundin wrote the operating system interface and transcript recorder.\nFx\nDOCS required a dedicated partition. With DOS having only three partitions and DOS/VS seven, giving up a partition to DOCS placed a crimp in practicability.\nLeigh Lundin designed Fx, a pseudo-partition that relieved the user from relinquishing a working partition. Fx appeared in the DOS/VS version of SDI's Grasp as F0.\nMarketing\nDOCS was sold in North America by CFS, Inc, Brookline, Ma.\nFor overseas sales, CFS engaged in both mail order and local vendors. The product was also embedded in third party operating system packages, such as EDOS and vDOS.\nReferences"
