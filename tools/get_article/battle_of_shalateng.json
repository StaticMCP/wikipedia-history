It was a decisive battle that resulted in the halting of the Pakistani offensive and the beginning of the Indian counter offensive.\nBuild-up\nThe Battle of Badgam had taken place just 4 days earlier, in which the advance of Tribal lashkars of Pakistan was halted and the Srinagar airport was secured, allowing more forces to be flown in.\nOn 6 November, an aerial patrol observed a significant gathering of tribesmen in the Zainakot area near Shalateng village, facing the defences of 1 Sikh on the outskirts of Srinagar town. This group was observed engaging in digging activities, signalling preparations for an imminent assault on the town.\nThe plan was to encircle them through a flanking maneuver led by 1 Kumaon (Para) on the southern side of the Sikhs, and 4 Kumaon on the right flank. Early morning on 7 November, a squadron of four Daimler armoured cars of 7 Light Cavalry was inducted. Two  armoured cars were deployed in support of 1 Sikh, and two were sent to reconnoitre, and positioned themselves behind the tribal lashkar forces.\nThe battle\nOnce the tribesmen were surrounded, the Indian forces opened up and strafing air support was also provided by Spitfires of the Airforce. The tribesmen were taken by surprise and broke ranks and fled, leaving over 600 dead and much of their arms, ammunition and equipment.\nAftermath\nThe Pakistani raiders fled with the Indian Army in hot pursuit. By evening, 1 Sikh had recaptured Pattan, and at around midnight, 1 Kumaon (Para) along with the armoured cars and a troop of 25 pounder guns advanced towards Baramulla, which was occupied by 5.30 pm on 8 November.\nBy 13 November, territory up to Uri was recaptured and Kashmir Valley was brought firmly in India's control.\nSee also\nIndo-Pakistani war of 1947–1948\n* Operation Easy\n* Battle of Pandu\n* Operation Bison 1948\n* Battle of Chunj\n* Battle of Muzaffarabad\nReferences\nBibliography\n* }}"
