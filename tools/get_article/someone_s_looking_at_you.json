It peaked at number two on the Irish Singles Chart and number 4 on the UK Singles Chart in February 1980.\nIt is an organ-based song that paints a humid picture of 1984-style government surveillance and has been described as a \"gently humorous song about paranoia\". The second verse starts ''\"They saw me there in the square when I was shooting my mouth off about saving some fish. Now could that be construed as some radical's views or some liberals' wish\"''. This refers to singer Bob Geldof's participation in a Greenpeace anti-whaling rally in London's Trafalgar Square. Geldof's website describes the song as a personal statement on fame.\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1980)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
