Notable groups of Latvian-born migrants historically also included people of Latvian Jewish, Baltic German and Latvian Russian origin.\nSignificant numbers of Latvians moved to the UK after World War II in 1947 under a government-backed scheme called 'Westward Ho!' recruiting workers from among displaced persons (DPs). The first group were women called the 'Balt Cygnets' who arrived in the UK from displaced persons camps in the British occupation zone in Germany in 1947.\nThe 2001 UK Census had recorded 4,275 UK residents born in Latvia.\nAnother wave of Latvian migration to the United Kingdom came after the 2004 accession of Latvia to the European Union, of which the UK was then a fellow member.\nThe 2011 UK Census already recorded 53,977 Latvian-born residents in England, 692 in Wales, 4,475 in Scotland, and 2,297 in Northern Ireland.\nIn 2021, there were approximately 90,000 Latvian nationals estimated to be residing in the United Kingdom. Historically, the highest estimated number of Latvian nationals residing in the United Kingdom was in 2017, when there were 117,000.\nThere is a Latvian section at Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey.\nLatvian burial ground, Brookwood Cemetery\nFile:Latvian burial grounds monument.jpg|Main monument at the Latvian burial ground at Brookwood Cemetery\nFile:Latvian burials Brookwood.jpg|Latvian burials at Brookwood Cemetery\nFile:Latvian burial ground entrance.jpg|Entrance to the Latvian burial ground\nFile:Grave of ambassador Karlis Zarins.jpg|Grave of diplomat Kārlis Zariņš, envoy and consul general of Latvia in the UK who headed the Latvian diplomatic service in exile\nFile:Latvian burials Brookwood Leonards Berzins.jpg\nFile:Latvian burials Brookwood Arturs Lacitis.jpg\nNotable British people of Latvian descent\nSee :Category:British people of Latvian descent\n* Martin Blunos, TV chef\n* Leonard Fenton, actor, director and painter\n* Dora Gaitskell, Baroness Gaitskell, Labour Party politician\n* Gustav Holst, composer\n* Anatol Lieven, journalist and policy analyst\n* Arnold Mikelson, artist\n* Viktoria Modesta, singer-songwriter\n* Imants Priede, zoologist\nSee also\n* Baltic people in the United Kingdom\n* Estonians in the United Kingdom\n* European Voluntary Workers\n* Immigration to the United Kingdom\n* Latvia–United Kingdom relations\n* Latvian diaspora\n* Lithuanians in the United Kingdom\n* Siege of Sidney Street\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Burrell, Kathy and Panayi, Panikos: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KK0GR2ZrVL4C&dq=%22Lithuanians+in+Britain%22&pg=PA89 Histories and Memories: Latvians and Their History in Britain]"
