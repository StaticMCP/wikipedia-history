Voters chose five representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nNew Hampshire was won by former California Senator John C. Frémont, who won the state by a narrow vote margin of less than 6,000 votes. He then lost nationally to former United States Minister to the United Kingdom James Buchanan.\nThis was a realigning election for New Hampshire, which had been a Democrat-dominated state since the Jackson Administration. The new Republican Party quickly established itself and the Granite State would not be carried by a Democrat presidential candidate again until 1912. New Hampshire was the home state of then-President Franklin Pierce, whom supported James Buchanan in this election.\nResults\n}}\nResults by County\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+1856 United States Presidential Election in New Hampshire (By County)\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |County\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |John C.
