After service in Maryland and Virginia he was commissioned colonel of the 13th Connecticut Infantry in February 1862 and was placed in command of the defenses of New Orleans. In December of the latter year he was appointed to the command of a brigade, which he retained through the first Red River Campaign and at the siege of Port Hudson. He was raised to the rank of brigadier general in September 1863, served in the second Red River expedition, and subsequently commanded at Baton Rouge. In 1864 he was assigned to the command of the second division of the XIX Corps. He participated in the battles of General Sheridan's campaign in the Shenandoah valley, and in February and March 1865, was appointed to the command of the defenses of Savannah. His brigade fought in the Carolinas campaign. After General Joseph E. Johnston surrendered, Birge again commanded the district of Savannah.\nOn February 25, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Birge for the award of the brevet major general, to rank from February 25, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the award on March 3, 1865. Birge resigned from the army on October 18, 1865.\nSee also\n*List of American Civil War generals (Union)\nReferences\nSources\n:\n* Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands.
