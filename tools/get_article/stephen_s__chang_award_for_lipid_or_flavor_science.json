It is awarded to a member of the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) who has made significant contributions to lipid or flavor science. This award is named for Stephen S. Chang (1918-1996), a Chinese-born food scientist who later became a food science professor at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey specializing in lipid and flavor research. It was the second IFT award to be named for a living person.\nAward winners receive a USD 3000 honorarium and a Steuben crystal from the Stephen S.
