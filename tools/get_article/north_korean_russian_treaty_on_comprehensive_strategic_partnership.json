It was signed on 18 June 2024 during a visit by Russian president Vladimir Putin to North Korea.\nHistory\nThe treaty was signed on 18 June 2024 by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian president Vladimir Putin in Pyongyang. It came amidst deepening ties between Russia and North Korea and suspected North Korean support for Russia during its war with Ukraine. Kim described the relationship between two nations as a \"fiery friendship\" and called the treaty the \"strongest ever treaty\", while Putin praised it as a \"breakthrough document\".\nContent\nThe treaty is composed of a preamble and 23 articles. It covers political, trade, investment, and security cooperation.\nArticle 3 states \"in case a direct threat of armed invasion is created\", the two nations \"shall immediately operate the channel of bilateral negotiations for the purpose of adjusting their stands\" and \"discussing feasible practical measures\". Article 4 of the treaty states that should either nation \"put in a state of war by an armed invasion\", the other \"provide military and other assistance with all means in its possession without delay\" in accordance \"with Article 51 of the UN Charter and the laws of the DPRK and the Russian Federation\".\nArticle 8 states the two sides \"shall establish mechanisms\" to \"strengthen defense capabilities to prevent war\". Article 10 states that the parties \"develop exchanges and cooperation\" in areas such as science and \"peaceful nuclear energy\". The treaty also expresses opposition to \"unilateral coercive measures of an extraterritorial nature.\" Article 16 state the two nations \"consider the implementation of such measures to be illegal and acts that violate the U.N. Charter and international norms\".\nRatification\nOn 24 October 2024, the State Duma unanimously voted to ratify the agreement; the Federation Council ratified the treaty on 6 November, in a similar unanimous vote. On 9 November, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the North Korea-Russia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Treaty into law. Kim Jong Un in his capacity as the President of the State Affairs Commission of North Korea signed a decree which ratified the treaty on 11 November. The treaty officially came into force on 4 December after the exchange of ratification instruments.\nAftermath\nIn October 2024, according to South Korea's intelligence agency, North Korea sent 1,500 special operation forces in Russia to prepare for battle in Ukraine. In December, Aleksandr Matsegora, the Russian ambassador to North Korea, hosted a reception to mark the signature of the treaty.\nSee also\n* Iranian–Russian Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership\n* Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance between China and the DPRK\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://kcnawatch.org/newstream/1718870859-459880358/dprk-russia-treaty-on-comprehensive-strategic-partnership/ The Text of the Treaty] — Korean Central Television"
