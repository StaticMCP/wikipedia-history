It was acquired by Warwickshire County Council and converted in a drill hall for the Warwickshire Rifle Volunteers in the mid-19th century. This unit evolved to become 2nd Volunteer Battalion, The Royal Warwickshire Regiment in 1883 and 7th Battalion, the Royal Warwickshire Regiment in 1908. Although the headquarters moved to Coventry in 1908, the regiment maintained a company, G Company, in Warwick for a while.\nMeanwhile, the drill hall had also become the headquarters of the Warwickshire Yeomanry in the mid-19th century. The regiment was mobilised at the drill hall in August 1914 before being deployed to Gallipoli. After the Second World War the yeomanry moved their headquarters to Coventry, but maintained one squadron, B Squadron, in Warwick. After the regiment amalgamated with the Queen's Own Worcestershire Hussars to form the Queen's Own Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry in 1956, the building was converted back for residential use.\nReferences"
