In addition to the dates mandated by the relevant federal laws, such as those in the U.S. Constitution and the Electoral Count Act, several milestones have consistently been observed since the adoption of the conclusions of the 1971 McGovern–Fraser Commission.\n2032\n* November 2: The 2032 presidential election will be held.\n* December 18: Electors to the Electoral College will meet at their respective state capitals on the first Monday after the second Wednesday of December and formally cast their votes for President and Vice President.\n2033\n* January 20:The winner of the 2032 presidential election will be inaugurated as 49th president of the United States.\n2034\n* November 3: The 2034 United States midterm elections will be held.\n2035\nAccording to The Washington Post, presidential candidates tend to declare their candidacies about a year and a half before Election Day, with the median date in mid-March. However, some candidates declare much earlier, such as Donald Trump 721 days before Election Day, Andrew Yang 997 days before, and John Delaney 1,194 days before, while some candidates declare at the very end, such as Kamala Harris 107 days before Election Day, following Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race.\n2036\n* Late September: Early voting will begin in some states.\n* November 4: The 2036 United States presidential election will be held.\n* December 18: Electors to the Electoral College will meet at their respective state capitals on the first Monday after the second Wednesday of December and formally cast their votes for President and Vice President.\n2037\n* January 6: At 1:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, the United States Congress will meet in a joint session to tabulate the Electoral College votes; the president of the Senate formally announce the electoral result.\n* January 20: At noon Eastern Standard Time, the president-elect and vice president-elect will be inaugurated.\nReferences"
