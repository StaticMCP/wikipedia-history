It is a dialect of Qimant. It is nearly extinct. Several early Falashan manuscripts, using the Ge'ez script, exist; in more recent times, the language has been recorded by several linguists and travellers, starting with Flad in 1866.\nQwareña was on the decline in the early 20th  century because it was being replaced by Amharic. During Operation Solomon, most of its remaining speakers were airlifted to Israel, where it continues to lose ground to Modern Hebrew.\nSee also\n*Kayla dialect\nReferences\nFurther reading\n#\n#Flad, J.
