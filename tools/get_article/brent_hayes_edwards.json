It examines black writers in the interwar period, focusing on sites of interaction between Anglophone and Francophone black writers to develop an argument about the generative potential of translation, specifically in the black diaspora. Among other influences, Edwards draws on Stuart Hall's use of the concept of articulation to develop a theoretical use of the French term décalage, \"referring to a shift in space or time or the gap that results from it...[Edwards argues] that these disparate locations are, like joints, sites of potential forward motion.\"\nEdwards also edited the collection Uptown Conversation: The New Jazz Studies (Columbia University Press, 2004) with Farah Griffin and Robert G. O'Meally.\nIn 2009, Edwards edited a new printing of W. E. B. Du Bois's The Souls of Black Folk from Oxford University Press.\nEdwards serves on the editorial boards of Callaloo and Transition.\nIn 2023, Edwards co-wrote and edited the autobiography of jazz musician Henry Threadgill, Easily Slip into Another World: A Life in Music.\nClaude McKay manuscript discovery\nIn 2009, Edwards's graduate student Jean-Christophe Cloutier discovered a manuscript in Columbia's Rare Book and Manuscript Library in the papers of writer Samuel Roth. In 2012, Edwards and Cloutier, in consultation with other experts and after examining archival materials and personal correspondence, authenticated the manuscript as a previously unknown 1941 work by Claude McKay, called Amiable With Big Teeth: A Novel of the Love Affair Between the Communists and the Poor Black Sheep of Harlem. Henry Louis Gates, who served as one of the experts evaluating the manuscript's authenticity, called it a \"major discovery...It dramatically expands the canon of novels written by Harlem Renaissance writers.\"\nAwards\nIn 2004, Edwards's book The Practice of Diaspora won the John Hope Franklin Prize from the American Studies Association and the Gilbert Chinard Prize of the Society for French Historical Studies, and an honorable mention for the James Russell Lowell Prize of the Modern Language Association.\nIn 2005, Edwards won the New York Public Library's Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Fellowship, to spend one year researching a project on jazz in New York in the 1970s.\nIn 2015, Edwards was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to pursue a book project entitled \"The Art of the Lecture\".\nIn 2024 he received a PEN Oakland – Josephine Miles Award for Easily Slip into Another World: A Life in Music, coauthored with Henry Threadgill.\nExternal links\n* [http://english.columbia.edu/people/profile/381 Brent Hayes Edwards] at Columbia University\nReferences"
