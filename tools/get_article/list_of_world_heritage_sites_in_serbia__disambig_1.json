Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural heritage consists of natural features (physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty. Serbia succeeded the convention on 11 September 2001, following the breakup of Yugoslavia.\n, there are five sites in Serbia on the list and eleven on the tentative list. The first site in Serbia to be added to the list was Stari Ras and Sopoćani, inscribed at the 3rd UNESCO session in 1979. Further sites were added to the list in 1986, 2004, 2007, and 2017. All are listed as cultural sites, as determined by the organization's selection criteria. Four out of five sites date to the medieval period while the fifth, the Gamzigrad complex, dates to late antiquity. The Medieval Monuments in Kosovo site, first added to the list in 2004 and expanded two years later, has been on UNESCO's list of endangered sites since 2006 due to difficulties in its management and conservation stemming from the region's political instability. It has been recognized as an independent state by 101 countries . Serbia considers Kosovo as a part of its sovereign territory while the United Nations is strictly neutral on whether or not Kosovo is an independent state. In April 2013, Serbia and Kosovo began to formalize relations under the Brussels Agreement. Kosovo unsuccessfully attempted to become a member of UNESCO in 2015. In 2017, the government decided to postpone future bids.}} The Stećci Medieval Tombstones Graveyards site is a transnational entry, shared with three neighboring countries.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria.
