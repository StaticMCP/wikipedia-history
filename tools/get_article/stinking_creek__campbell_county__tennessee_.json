      "text": "# Stinking Creek (Campbell County, Tennessee)\n\nStinking Creek is a stream in Campbell County, Tennessee, in the United States.\nStinking Creek, a sulphur spring, was named on account of its naturally occurring unpleasant odor.\nAnother theory for the creek's name dates to 1779–1780. This was attributed to many animal deaths during an unusually cold winter and the resulting carrion stench the following spring.\nSee also\n*List of rivers of Tennessee\nReferences"
