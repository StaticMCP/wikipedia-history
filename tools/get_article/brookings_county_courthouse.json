The courthouse was built in 1912 to replace the county's original courthouse, which was erected in 1883. Architects C. E. Bell, Tyrie & Chapman designed the courthouse in the Renaissance Revival style, which was common in early 20th century buildings. The J. B. Nelson Construction Company erected the courthouse.\nThe courthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 12, 1976. In 2011, the county began a $1 million renovation of the courthouse in order to meet the local circuit court's needs.\nReferences"
