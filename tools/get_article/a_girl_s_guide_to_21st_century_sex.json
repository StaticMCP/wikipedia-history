Ofcom ruled that there was no rule banning the showing of genuine sexual acts on free-to-air television, and that \"in [their] view the portrayal of sex in this programme genuinely sought to inform and educate on sex\", concluding that \"whilst the visuals were explicit at times, nothing was transmitted in a manner that could be construed as having the potential to harm people under the age of 18\", particularly given its context as a serious factual programme, and as such, it was ruled that the episodes were not in breach of any broadcasting regulations.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
