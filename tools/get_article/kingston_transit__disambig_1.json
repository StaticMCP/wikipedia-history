Daily and Weekly passes are also available from various transit locations.\nKingston Transit employs a smart card payment system for monthly passes (My Pass) and tickets (My Tickets), which was introduced in August 2008.\nTransfers are free for cash fares but must be obtained at the time fare is paid. They are valid for 90 minutes. Payments using My Tickets have transfers automatically stored inside the card.\nQueen's University students, who are members of the AMS or SGPS, as well as St. Lawrence College students can ride free, as part of a U-Pass program.\nKingston Transit did not increased fares till 2025 to encourage more individuals to ride transit in the years following the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRack and Roll\nThe current \"Rack and Roll\" system is used for bicycle transportation. If a customer wishes to bring a bicycle onto the bus, a pull-down rack is located at the outside front of the bus. The rack can currently hold 2 bicycles.  It involves 2 slots which the bicycle's wheels fit into.  Then, a curved hook fits around the front tire to secure the bike from falling.  Rack and Roll is available during the cycling season.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/transit Kingston Transit Official Website]\n* [http://www.busdrawings.com/Transit/ontario/kingston/index.htm Drawings and photos of Kingston Transit buses]\n* [https://cptdb.ca/wiki/index.php/Kingston_Transit CPTDB]"
