Congress authorized the coins to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the United States’ involvement in World War II. The act allowed the coins to be struck in both proof and uncirculated finishes. Released on May 28, 1993, the coins feature the dual date “1991-1995”, which represents the 50th anniversary of American involvement in the war from 1941 to 1945.\nDesigns\nHalf Dollar\nThe obverse of the World War II 50th Anniversary commemorative half dollar, designed by George Klauba, features the faces of three U.S. service personnel superimposed upon the \"V\" for victory symbol at center, beneath a B-17 bomber with five stars above the bomber at the top.
