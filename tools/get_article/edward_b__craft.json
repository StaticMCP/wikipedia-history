In New York he was from 1907 to 1918 (with interruption by military service in WW I) a development engineer and from 1918 to 1922 assistant chief engineer in charge of development and design. In 1922 he was appointed Western Electric's chief engineer as successor to Frank B. Jewett. Craft was responsible for over 70 patents in electrical communication. In 1925 Craft was appointed Executive Vice President of Bell Telephone Laboratories. He worked with Edwin H. Colpitts, Harold D. Arnold, and Frank B.

On 27 October 1926, Craft presented to the New York Society of Electrical Engineers the  sound film The Voice from the Screen starring the vaudeville duo Witt & Berg. The following year The Jazz Singer premiered.\nBy 1928 the sound film equipment developed under Craft's direction had overwhelming dominance among the Hollywood studios.\nOn 21 October 1902 in Ironton, Ohio, he married Mary R.
