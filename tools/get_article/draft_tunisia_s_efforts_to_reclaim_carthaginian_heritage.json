Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Carthage's ruins are seen as a source of national pride and a cornerstone of Tunisian identity. The legacy of Carthage is reflected in Tunisia's language, customs, traditions, and cultural events, which often celebrate the ancient civilization.\nConservation and Restoration Efforts\nTunisia has undertaken significant efforts to conserve and restore Carthage's heritage. Key projects include the rehabilitation of the Carthage National Museum and its surroundings, supported by international partners such as the European Union and French development agencies. These initiatives aim to modernize museum facilities, improve visitor experiences, and integrate heritage sites into broader tourism and educational strategies.\nThe UNESCO \"Save Carthage\" campaign, launched in the early 1970s, brought together international teams to survey, excavate, and stabilize the site. This campaign highlighted the challenges of balancing urban development with heritage preservation and underscored the importance of international cooperation in protecting Carthage.\nChallenges and Policy Responses\nCarthage faces threats from uncontrolled urban sprawl and unauthorized construction, which have led to the demolition of homes and buildings within the site's boundaries to protect its archaeological integrity. The Tunisian government, in collaboration with UNESCO, has implemented strict regulations on development and has carried out numerous demolitions to safeguard the site.\nEfforts have also focused on revising and implementing management plans, establishing buffer zones, and coordinating stakeholders to ensure the long-term preservation of Carthage's heritage.\nCultural and Economic Impact\nPreserving Carthage's heritage is central to Tunisia's national identity and has significant economic benefits. The site attracts tourists from around the world, generating revenue and supporting local businesses. Educational programs and cultural events highlight the importance of Carthage in Tunisia's history, fostering a sense of pride and continuity among Tunisians.\nSee also\n* Carthage\n* UNESCO World Heritage Site\n* Cultural heritage\n* Archaeological site\n* Tunisia\nReferences"
