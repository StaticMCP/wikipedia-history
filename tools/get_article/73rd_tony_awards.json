As noted by The Hollywood Reporter \"Presenting the play nominees has always been the telecast's biggest challenge, and having the writers themselves take the stage to discuss the genesis and themes of their work felt particularly appropriate in such an uncommonly strong season for new plays. It helped that they were so entertaining.\" The playwrights included James Graham (Ink), Jez Butterworth (The Ferryman), Tarell Alvin McCraney (Choir Boy), Taylor Mac (Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus) and Heidi Schreck (What the Constitution Means to Me).\nBroadway Karaoke\nDuring the broadcast's commercial breaks, Corden started Broadway Karaoke, whereby Broadway performers in the audience would karaoke a show tune without preplanning or rehearsal. Equipped with a songbook, microphone, and with a pianist to accompany, Corden would pick various stars to sing during three of the telecast commercials. Although the performances weren't broadcast, audience members and Corden's own film crew recorded the proceedings with some videos being posted online. Corden, whose own late-night show has a successful and similar ongoing segment, Carpool Karaoke, which led to television's Carpool Karaoke: The Series, revealed the scheme on his show the following night of the Tonys.\nThe first of three karaokes was Dear Evan Hansen's Ben Platt who sang \"Tomorrow\" from Annie. During the next karaoke break was a performance of \"96,000\" from In the Heights by the upcoming film's Anthony Ramos who plays Usnavi, who was soon duetting with Christopher Jackson, who originated the role of Benny. The third performance was a \"showstopper\" shared by Corden on his show the next night, weaving online videos as well as from his own crew. Toward the end of the show he approached Pose's Billy Porter, who garnered media attention for his red and pink haute couture gown upcycled from Kinky Boots' curtains, to deliver what Corden said was an incredible performance of \"Everything's Coming up Roses\" from Gypsy, which received a standing ovation from the roughly 6,000 attendees.\nNon-competitive awards\nThe non-competitive Special Tony Award was presented to Rosemary Harris, Terrence McNally and Harold Wheeler for Lifetime Achievement in the Theatre.\nThe Isabelle Stevenson Award was awarded to Judith Light for her work to end HIV/AIDS and support for LGBTQ+ and human rights.\nThe Excellence In Theatre Education Award recipient was Madeleine Michel of Monticello High School in Charlottesville, Virginia.\nThe Regional Theatre Tony Award winner was TheatreWorks (Silicon Valley), Palo Alto, California.\nThe Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre was awarded to Broadway Inspirational Voices; Peter Entin, retired vice president of Theatre Operations for the Shubert Organization; Joseph Blakely Forbes, founder and president of Scenic Art Studios, Inc.; and FDNY Engine 54, Ladder 4, Battalion 9 (firehouse, New York City).\nSpecial Tony Awards were presented to the late Marin Mazzie, music director Jason Michael Webb, and Sonny Tilders and Creature Technology Company, creator of the gorilla in King Kong among others.\nWinners and nominees\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n!width:50%;\"| Best Play ‡\n!width:50%;\"| Best Musical ‡\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" |\n*'The Ferryman – Jez Butterworth'\n**Choir Boy – Tarell Alvin McCraney\n**Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus – Taylor Mac\n**Ink – James Graham\n**What the Constitution Means to Me – Heidi Schreck\n|valign=\"top\" |\n*Hadestown\n**''Ain't Too Proud\n**Beetlejuice\n**The Prom\n**Tootsie\n|-\n!width=\"50% |Best Revival of a Play ‡\n!width=\"50% |Best Revival of a Musical ‡\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" |\n*The Boys in the Band\n**All My Sons\n**Burn This\n**Torch Song\n**The Waverly Gallery\n|valign=\"top\" |\n*Oklahoma!\n**Kiss Me, Kate\n|-\n!width=\"50% |Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play\n!width=\"50% |Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" |\n*'Bryan Cranston – Network as Howard Beale'\n**Paddy Considine – The Ferryman as Quinn Carney\n**Jeff Daniels – To Kill a Mockingbird as Atticus Finch\n**Adam Driver – Burn This as Pale\n**Jeremy Pope – Choir Boy as Pharus Jonathan Young\n|valign=\"top\" |\n*'Elaine May – The Waverly Gallery as Gladys Green'\n**Annette Bening – All My Sons as Kate Keller\n**Laura Donnelly – The Ferryman as Caitlin Carney\n**Janet McTeer – Bernhardt/Hamlet as Sarah Bernhardt\n**Laurie Metcalf – Hillary and Clinton as Hillary\n**Heidi Schreck – What the Constitution Means to Me as Heidi Schreck\n|-\n!width=\"50% |Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical\n!width=\"50% |Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" |\n*'Santino Fontana – Tootsie as Michael Dorsey / Dorothy Michaels'\n**Brooks Ashmanskas – The Prom as Barry Glickman\n**Derrick Baskin – Ain't Too Proud as Otis Williams\n**Alex Brightman – Beetlejuice as Betelgeuse\n**Damon Daunno – Oklahoma! as Curly McLain\n|valign=\"top\" |\n*'Stephanie J.

On Metacritic, the ceremony has a weighted average score of 46 out of 100, based 6 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". The Hollywood Reporter columnist David Rooney remarked, \"The host started strong and had one sharp musical interlude mid-show, but elsewhere delivered strained comedy bits that felt familiar, safe and thematically generic.\" The New York Times'' theatre critic Mike Hale commented, \"But after his verbal dexterity enlivened an overcrowded and bland opening number that did little to showcase the season's musicals, the material continually failed him, whether it was a tortured audience-participation gag about putting on a loser's face for the cameras, or a tortured audience-participation gag about generating some rap-style beefs between Broadway stars.\" Daniel D'Addario from Variety wrote, \"The quality of showmanship — the simple sense of taking joy in a production having been brought across well — seemed painfully absent from a broadcast that has little other reason to exist. Many, many people who watch the Tonys never have seen and never will see a nominated show in Manhattan; for that audience, a production brought off well before the cameras is the ceremony's point vastly more than is a list of winners.\"\nIn addition, Caroline Siede from The A.V. Club gave the show a B−, expanding in her review, \"All in all, this was a mostly satisfying, if not completely exhilarating year for the Tonys. I'll remember the winners and I'll remember some of the musical performances, but I doubt I'll remember James Corden's opening number in the way I still do with Neil Patrick Harris' \"Bigger\" or last year's Sara Bareilles and Josh Groban's tribute to losers.\" New York Post critic Michael Riedel wrote, \"As for Corden, this was not his finest hour. The opening number, written especially for the telecast, was a dud, and he seemed a bit tired throughout the evening. There was a skit where he had Broadway actors dissing each other, and I can only hope he did not have script approval on that one.\" Theatre critic Charles McNulty of the Los Angeles Times remarked, \"James Corden sprinkled in crowd-pleasing pokes at annoying audience members' phones ringing during shows, how expensive Broadway tickets have become and how low the industry's paychecks and the CBS telecast's ratings tend to be.\"\nBe More Chill parody controversy\nOf the ten nominated musicals, Be More Chill was the only one to not have a performance or segment on the telecast. Host Corden, with Josh Groban and Sara Bareilles, performed a parody of  \"Michael in the Bathroom\", a song from the show. Joe Iconis, the show's composer and sole Tony nominee, praised the parody for giving the show exposure on a large scale, but the award ceremony was nevertheless criticized by fans for not crediting the source material. New York Post's Riedel noted Broadway League chief Charlotte St. Martin talked about the importance of getting young people to the theater, while the ceremony almost entirely ignored a show about teenagers whose target audience was mostly teenagers. The day after the ceremony, both Corden and Groban credited the show. St. Martin said, \"We are doing everything we can to rectify [the situation].\" CBS's Facebook post of the number was later revised to credit Iconis and Be More Chill as the parody's source.\nRatings\nThe ceremony averaged a Nielsen 4.3 ratings/8 share, and was watched by 5.4 million viewers. The ratings was a 10 percent decrease from previous ceremony's viewership of 6.3 million, becoming the lowest in its entire history.\nIn Memoriam\nBroadway actor Cynthia Erivo performed \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" from The Lion King as images of theatre personalities who died in the past year were shown in the following order.\n*Marin Mazzie\n*Carol Channing\n*Alan Wasser\n*Philip Bosco\n*William Craver\n*Merle Debuskey\n*Georgia Engel\n*Ralph Koltai\n*Alvin Epstein\n*Maria Irene Fornes\n*Kaye Ballard\n*Jerry Frankel\n*William Goldman\n*Barbara Harris\n*Robert Kamlot\n*Terry Allen Kramer\n*Gary Beach\n*Jo Sullivan Loesser\n*Gillian Lynne\n*Eric LaJuan Summers\n*Galt MacDermot\n*Joe Masteroff\n*Vivian Matalon\n*Harvey Sabinson\n*Mark Medoff\n*Shirley Prendergast\n*Roger O.
