Shiva is worshipped as Thirumakaraleeswarar, and is represented by the lingam. His consort Parvati is depicted as Tribuvananayagi. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th-century CE Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the Nayanmars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam.\nThe temple complex covers two acres and it houses a five-tier gateway tower known as gopurams, axially facing the Thirumakaraleeswarar shrine.

The Brahmotsavam festival celebrated during Masi (February–March) is the most prominent festival.\nThe original complex is believed to have been built by Cholas, while the present masonry structure was built during the Vijayanagar Empire Nayak during the 16th century. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu.\nLegend\nAs per Hindu legend, Indra, the king of celestial deities, presented his white elephant to Muruga, the son of Shiva, during his marriage at Thiruparakundram. The divine couple travelled on the elephant. When Vishnu wanted to view the couple, they appeared at Thirumagaral.\nAs per another legend, a ruler of the region wanted the fruit from a jack fruit tree in the place wanted it to be offered to Chidambaram Nataraja Temple every day and subsequently to him. He ordered the local public to carry out the activity every day. Once it was a turn of a boy in the village to carry the fruit. He felt that the king has made an undue order and wanted it to be eliminated. He burnt the tree thinking that the villagers would be relieved off the duty. The king enquired the boy, who fearlessly narrated the truth. The king was angry with him and started chasing him to punish. He found a golden iguana cross his way to an anthill. The king dug the anthill only to see blood oozing out. A divine voice told him that it was Shiva who appeared that and the king had to build a temple for his propitiation.
