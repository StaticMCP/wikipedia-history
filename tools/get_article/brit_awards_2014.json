The awards ceremony was held at The O2 Arena in London and was presented by James Corden for the fourth consecutive year. Leading the nominations was Ellie Goulding with five nominations. Arctic Monkeys and One Direction both won the most awards, winning two awards each.\nFor the first time ever, a backstage livestream was broadcast on the internet, via YouTube. The stream was hosted by internet vloggers Daniel Howell and Phil Lester, with guests including One Direction and Ellie Goulding. 67-year-old David Bowie became the oldest winner to date of the British Male Solo Artist award.\nA new glossy black finish design statue designed by fashion designer Philip Treacy was presented for the first time.\nStatuette design\nThe statuette for the 2014 BRIT Awards was designed by Irish milliner Philip Treacy. Taking the form of Britannia (the national personification of Britain), the trophy has been redesigned by various artists since the BRIT Awards revamp in 2011. Treacy stated that music has always been his inspiration, with the 2014 trophy being inspired by \"a uniquely British genre of music, Punk.\" It was unveiled on 28 November 2013. The statuette has a glossy black finish, with a black and white circular hat that represents a mohawk, which sits atop the helmet at the apex of the trophy.\nPerformances\nThe Brits Are Coming: Nominations Launch Party\nNick Grimshaw hosted the launch show inside the ITV Studios in London on Thursday 9 January.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Artist(s)\n!Song(s)\n!UK Singles Chart reaction\n|-\n|Tinie Tempah\n|\"Children of the Sun\"\"Lover Not a Fighter\"\n|did not chart42 (+78)\n|-\n|Pixie Lott\n|\"Nasty\"\n|9 (debut)\n|-\n|Sam Smith\n| \"Money on My Mind\"\n|1 (debut)\n|-\n|Rudimental\n| \"Not Giving In\"\n|84 (−17)\n|}\nMain show performances\nThe following performances took place during the live broadcast on 19 February 2014.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
