Pitchfork reviewer Sheldon Pearce hailed it as \"another big, long flex from one of the most skilled rappers to emerge in the last five years\". In his \"Consumer Guide\" column, Robert Christgau said, \"It's a woman's voice with a brawny, low-pitched masculinity to it, articulated with no show of care and every well-chosen word distinct. The hook-free beats are as utilitarian and accomplished as vocals that always take the rhymes where they want to go\".\nTrack listing\nCredits adapted from Tidal and Respect.\n| extra1 = Kofi Black & Southside Gang (WBM)\n| length1 = 2:11\n| title2 = Da Come Up\n| writer2 =\n| extra2 =\n| length2 = 2:41\n| title3 = Big\n| writer3 =\n| extra3 = Mike Zombie\n| length3 = 3:45\n| title4 = Kold World\n| writer4 =\n| extra4 = Zaytoven\n| length4 = 3:57\n| title5 = PettyWap\n| writer5 =\n| extra5 =\n| length5 = 2:56\n| title6 = The Lyfestyle\n| writer6 =\n| extra6 = NY Bangers\n| length6 = 3:25\n| title7 = Smoove Kriminal\n| writer7 =\n| extra7 =\n| length7 = 2:41\n| title8 = Stubborn Ass\n| writer8 =\n| extra8 =\n| length8 = 3:20\n| title9 = RNID (abbreviated as Rich Nigga ID)\n| writer9 =\n| extra9 =\n| length9 = 3:23\n| title10 = She Like I'm Like\n| writer10 =\n| extra10 =\n| length10 = 3:11\n| title11 = Numb\n| writer11 =\n| extra11 =\n| length11 = 2:51\n| title12 = Bipolar\n| writer12 = Marrero\n| extra12 =\n| length12 = 1:58\n| title13 = Bleed\n| writer13 =\n| extra13 = NY Bangers\n| length13 = 3:30\n| title14 = No Love\n| writer14 =\n| extra14 = NY Bangers\n| length14 = 3:19\n| title15 = Car Confessions\n| writer15 =\n| extra15 =\n| length15 = 4:21\n| title16 = Foreign\n| writer16 =\n| extra16 =\n| length16 = 3:26\n| title17 = NNAN (abbreviated as Never Need a Nigga)\n| note17 = featuring Relle Bey and Max YB\n| writer17 =\n| extra17 =\n| length17 = 3:13\n| title18 = My Hitta\n| writer18 =\n| extra18 =\n| length18 = 3:05\n| title19 = Sober Thoughts\n| note19 = featuring Max YB\n| writer19 =\n| extra19 = NY Bangers\n| length19 = 4:26\n| title20 = Crime Poetry (Outro)\n| writer20 =\n| extra20 = NY Bangers\n| length20 = 3:16\n| title21 = PettyWap 2\n| note21 = bonus\n| writer21 =\n| extra21 = NY Bangers\n| length21 = 2:36\n}}\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
