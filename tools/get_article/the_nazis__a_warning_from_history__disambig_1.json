This was followed by the 18 July 2006 four-disc DVD set () from BBC Home Entertainment for which the BBC commissioned Time-Life (whose book division had actually already released the precursory The Third Reich book series that dealt with the same subject matter) for the retail distribution and promotional services, which included at least one television commercial. An American reissue has followed suit on 25 August 2015 ().\nSpain saw the \"Nazis: un aviso de la historia\" two-disc DVD set release by Divisa Red, S.A.U. in May 2005 (), which the company reissued on 29 October 2008 (). A three-disc Benelux DVD version was released twice in 2006 by Just Entertainment (), while  France had its two-disc set released by Koba Films on 4 June 2014 as \"Nazis, un avertissement de l'histoire\" (). The documentary had not seen a home video format in Germany itself, though the companion book was published in translation, which it had not been in the other European countries, the UK excepted.\nThe UK and Benelux DVD sets all featured a band mentioning \"Best Factual Series\", the category which had earned the documentary its 1998 BAFTA Award, whereas the French release had the fact mentioned on the back cover of the set. Neither Spanish release had the fact mentioned though.\nCompanion book\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nEpisodes\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n!
