The treaty delimited the borders of the Spanish colonies in the Sahara desert (Río de Oro, part of Spanish Sahara) and Equatorial Africa (Spanish Guinea) with respect to the adjoining French colonies on Africa.\nHistory\nBased on the terms of the treaty, Río Muni was relieved of all conflicting claims. Spain was left with a mere 26,000 km2 out of the 300,000 stretching east to the Ubangi River which they initially claimed. Moreover, the treaty granted the French the right to pre-emptively seize all territories if Spain decided to abandon its possessions in Río Muni.\nGallery\nFile:CostaAOE1896g.jpg|Map detailing the coast of Río de Oro (part of Spanish Sahara colony) in 1896.\nFile:Mapa del Magreb (1956).svg|Borders raised by this treaty after 1900 of the Spanish territories of Spanish West Africa until 1956, including Río de Oro within Spanish Sahara.\nFile:(1897) Golfo de Guinea.jpg|Map of Spanish possessions in the Gulf of Guinea in 1897, before the Treaty of Paris (1900).\nFile:Eq_Guinea_1900_ES.PNG|Borders after the agreement of 1900 on the land that would become Spanish Guinea (now Equatorial Guinea).\nSee also\n* Río Muni\n* Equatorial Guinea\n* History of Equatorial Guinea\n* Spanish Empire\n* Spanish Africa\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20030329113612/http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS102.pdf Cameroon-Chad Boundary]"
