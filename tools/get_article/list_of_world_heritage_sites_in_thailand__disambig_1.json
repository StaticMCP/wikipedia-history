Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural heritage consists of natural features (physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty. Thailand ratified the convention on 17 September 1987.\n, Thailand has eight sites on the list. The first three sites were listed in 1991: Historic Town of Sukhothai and Associated Historic Towns, Historic City of Ayutthaya, and Thungyai–Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuaries. The most recent site listed was Phu Phrabat, a testimony to the Sīma stone tradition of the Dvaravati period, in 2024. Five of Thailand's sites are cultural and three are natural. Thailand also has seven sites on the tentative list.\n__TOC__\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria.
