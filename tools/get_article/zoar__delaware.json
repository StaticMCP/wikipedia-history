The community lies between Stockley and Hollyville. It is near Mount Joy.\nHistory\nThe Zoar Methodist Church was founded in the late 18th century. Originally a log building, around 1802, the original Zoar Church was replaced by a cypress-shingle structure. The church was incorporated in 1810. A fire destroyed the second church in 1910, and the present structure was built. A historical marker was placed by the Delaware Public Archives in 1994. This church still operates, and is now known as the Zoar United Methodist Church.\nAccording to the State Archives, Zoar camp meetings began being held soon after the 1802 land purchase. These religious revival meetings were held in the grove adjoining the church. By 1893, the Zoar Camp was being called one of the oldest and most successful camps in Sussex County. The last meeting was held in 1918.\nBy the middle of the 20th century, Zoar had become a settlement, located 5.5 miles southeast of Georgetown. County Road 48 is now known as Zoar Road in honor of the community. This road forms part of the boundary of Delaware's 19th Senate district, bisecting the community.\nIn 2019, Delaware Electric Cooperative announced plans to build a second substation in Zoar. By 2020, plans had shifted, and the original Zoar substation would be replaced; according to representatives, the upgrades were necessary due to the rapid population growth in the area, and were projected to cost between $5&nbsp;million and $6&nbsp;million.\nReferences"
