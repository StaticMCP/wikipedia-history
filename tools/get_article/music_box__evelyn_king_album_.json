The album was digitally remastered and reissued on CD with bonus tracks in 2011 by Funky Town Grooves Records.\nCritical reception\n}}\nThe Bay State Banner wrote that \"King sounds like Michael Jackson, her lyrics are a sight-seer's tour of disco clubs, and her music is bubblegum with a Sylvers' accent... What saves the King performance from being prissy is her part tomboy, part kitten voice.\"\nTrack listing\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Chart (1979)\n!Peak\n|-\n|U.S. Billboard Top LPs\n|align=\"center\"|35\n|-\n|U.S. Billboard Top Soul LPs\n|align=\"center\"|12\n|-\n|}\n;Singles\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Single\n! colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"40\"| US\n! width=\"40\"| USR&B\n! width=\"40\"| USDance\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|1979\n| align=\"left\"| \"Music Box\"\n| 75\n| 14\n| 78\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| \"Out There\"\n| &mdash;\n| 34\n| &mdash;\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
