Due to the relatively short time over which aerial combat has developed air wargaming periods tend to break down into three broad periods:\n* World War I – from the earliest air combat to the 1920s\n* World War II – 1930s to the early 1950s\n* \"Modern\" – the missile age\nTo this can be added science fiction and \"alternate history\" such as the various incarnations of Crimson Skies or Victorian Science Fiction such as Aeronef.\nAir wargaming is served by a specialist wargames society, AirWarSoc, which was formed by Steve Blease (founder of the Society of Fantasy and Science Fiction Wargamers); AirWarSoc currently exists as an online entity. The development of military flight occurred during the period covered by the Society of Twentieth Century Wargamers and air wargaming articles appear frequently in its quarterly Journal.\nBoard games\nWW1\n* Ace of Aces (Flying Buffalo, Inc.)   combat game that simulates a dogfight between World War I aircraft using two booklets\n* Age of Dogfights: WWI (Forsage Games)\n* Blue Max\n* Dawn Patrol (TSR)\n* Flying Circus (Simulations Publications Inc.)\n* Knights of the Air (Avalon Hill)\n* ''Richthofen's War (Avalon Hill)\n* Winged Victory (WBS Games)\n* Wings (Yaquinto, Excalibre)\n* Wings of War: Dawn of War (Fantasy Flight Games)\nWW2\n* Achtung Spitfire – Fighting Wings Series – (Clash of Arms)\n* Air Force and the Dauntless expansion pack (Avalon Hill)\n* B-17: Queen of the Skies (Avalon Hill) solitaire game\n* Down in Flames (GMT)\n* Memoir '44: Air Pack and Memoir '44: New Flight Plan (Days of Wonder)\n* Over the Reich – Fighting Wings Series – (Clash of Arms)\n* Skies Above the Reich GMT Games\n* Spitfire (Simulations Publications Inc.)\n* Whistling Death – Fighting Wings Series – (Clash of Arms)\n* Wing Leader GMT Games\n* Wings of War: Famous Aces (Fantasy Flight Games)\nModern\n* Air Scarmush (Christophe W.
