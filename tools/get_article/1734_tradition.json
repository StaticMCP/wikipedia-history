It is largely based upon the teachings he received from an English traditional witch named Robert Cochrane, the founder of Cochrane's Craft, and from Ruth Wynn-Owen, whom he called the matriarch of Y Plant Bran (\"the child of Bran\").\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.1734-witchcraft.org/ 1734 Witchcraft: The Authentic Method of Robert Cochrane and Joseph Bearwalker Wilson]\n\n---\n\n## 1734 tradition\n\n#REDIRECT 1734 Tradition\n}}"
