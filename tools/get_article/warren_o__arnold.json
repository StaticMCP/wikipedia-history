He engaged in mercantile pursuits at Coventry from 1857 to 1864. He was a manufacturer of cotton goods in Chepachet and Westerly, Rhode Island, until 1866 when he began the manufacture of woolen goods.\nArnold was elected as a Republican to the Fiftieth and Fifty-first Congresses (March 4, 1887 – March 3, 1891). He was a candidate for re-election in 1890 to the Fifty-second Congress. But, as neither candidate received a majority the general assembly ordered a new election, in which he declined to be a participant.\nArnold was elected to the Fifty-fourth Congress (March 4, 1895 – March 3, 1897). He declined to be a candidate for renomination in 1896. He continued his former manufacturing pursuits until his death in Westerly, Washington County, Rhode Island on April 1, 1910, aged 70.
