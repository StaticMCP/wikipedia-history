From the tower's galleries there is a unique view not only of Hradec Králové, but also of the distant peaks of the Giant Mountains and the Orlické Mountains. In recent years the tower came back to life with the exhibitions and became the center of tourism and cultural events. The White Tower houses the third largest and heaviest bell in the Czech Republic – the Augustine Bell.\nHistory\nOn 7 June 1574 the construction of the White Tower started in the middle of the western side of the Great Square in Hradec Králové. The construction was funded by charity gifts of the citizens of the city. In the course of the next six years a tower  tall was built.\nThe White Tower is the highest dominating monument of the city of Hradec Králové and most likely the highest building in Eastern Bohemia. In May 1581 the impressive Augustine Bell,  high and  wide was hanged on the fourth floor of the tower during a festive celebration. The bell was cast already in 1509 by famous Hradec bell founder Ondřej Žáček at the expense of the city and the commons. There is only one bell in Bohemia that is bigger. It is the famous Zikmund Bell that can be found in St. Vitus Cathedral at Prague Castle.\nInteresting facts\nThe White Tower was named after its building material, which is white stone. The Augustine Bell weighs 10 tonnes. On special occasions it rings even nowadays.\nIf the hands on the clock seem to you to be the wrong way round, then your eyes are not deceiving you. One of the explanations is that in the past minutes were not as important and it was possible to see the large hand from a greater distance – e.g. from a nearby field.\nOpening hours\nIt is possible to visit the White Tower from 1 April to 30 September,  daily from 09:00-12:00 and 13:00-17:00. The White Tower is possible to visit exceptionally on the night tours as well.\nReferences"
