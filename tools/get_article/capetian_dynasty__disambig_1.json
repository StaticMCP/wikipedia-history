It is among the largest and oldest royal houses in Europe and the world, and consists of Hugh Capet, the founder of the dynasty, and his male-line descendants, who ruled in France without interruption from 987 to 1792, and again from 1814 to 1848. The senior line from the House of Capet ruled in France from the election of Hugh Capet in 987 until the death of Charles IV in 1328. That line was succeeded by cadet branches, first the House of Valois, and succeeding them the House of Bourbon, which ruled until the French Revolution abolished the monarchy in 1792 and tried and executed King Louis XVI in 1793. The Bourbons were restored in 1814 in the aftermath of Napoleon's defeat, but had to vacate the throne again in 1830 in favor of the last Capetian monarch of France, Louis Philippe I, who belonged to the House of Orléans, a cadet branch of the Bourbons. Cadet branches of the Capetian House of Bourbon are still reigning over Spain and Luxembourg.\nThe dynasty had a crucial role in the formation of the French state. From a power base initially confined to their own demesne, the Île-de-France, the Capetian kings slowly but steadily increased their power and influence until it grew to cover the entirety of their realm. For a detailed narration on the growth of French royal power, see Crown lands of France. Members of the dynasty were traditionally Catholic, and the early Capetians had an alliance with the Church. The French were also the most active participants in the Crusades, culminating in a series of five Crusader kings – Louis VII, Philip Augustus, Louis VIII, Louis IX, and Philip III. The Capetian alliance with the papacy suffered a severe blow after the disaster of the Aragonese Crusade. Philip III's son and successor, Philip IV, arrested Pope Boniface VIII and brought the papacy under French control. The later Valois, starting with Francis I, ignored religious differences and allied with the Ottoman sultan to counter the growing power of the Holy Roman Empire. Henry IV was a Protestant at the time of his accession, but realized the necessity of conversion after four years of religious warfare.\nThe Capetians generally enjoyed a harmonious family relationship. By tradition, younger sons and brothers of the king of France were given appanages for them to maintain their rank and to dissuade them from claiming the French crown itself. When Capetian cadets did aspire for kingship, their ambitions were directed not at the French throne, but at foreign thrones. As a result, the Capetians have reigned at different times in the kingdoms of Portugal, Sicily and Naples, Navarre, Hungary and Croatia, Poland, Spain and Sardinia, grand dukedoms of Lithuania and Luxembourg, and in Latin and Brazilian empires. In modern times, King Felipe VI of Spain is a member of this family, while Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg is related to the family by agnatic kinship; both through the Bourbon branch of the dynasty. Along with the House of Habsburg, arguably its greatest historic rival, it was one of the two oldest European royal dynasties. It was also one of the most powerful royal families in European history, having played a major role in its politics for much of its existence. According to Oxford University, 75% of all royal families in European history are related to the Capetian dynasty.\nName origins and usage\nThe name of the dynasty derives from its founder, King Hugh, who was known as \"Hugh Capet\". The meaning of \"Capet\" (a nickname rather than a surname of the modern sort) is unknown. While folk etymology identifies it with \"cape\", other suggestions indicate it might be connected to the Latin word caput (\"head\"), and explain it as meaning \"chief\" or \"head\".\nHistorians in the 19th century (see House of France) came to apply the name \"Capetian\" to both the ruling house of France and to the wider-spread male-line descendants of Hugh Capet. It was not a contemporary practice. The name \"Capet\" has also been used as a surname for French royalty, particularly but not exclusively those of the House of Capet. One notable use was during the French Revolution, when the dethroned King Louis XVI (a member of the House of Bourbon and a direct male-line descendant of Hugh Capet) and Queen Marie Antoinette (a member of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine) were referred to as \"Louis and Antoinette Capet\" (the queen being addressed as \"the Widow Capet\" after the execution of her husband).\nCapetian miracle\nThe Capetian miracle () refers to the dynasty's ability to attain and hold onto the French crown.\nIn 987, Hugh Capet was elected to succeed Louis V of the Carolingian dynasty that had ruled France for over three centuries. By a process of associating elder sons with them in the kingship, the early Capetians established the hereditary succession in their family and transformed a theoretically electoral kingship into a sacral one. By the time of Philip II Augustus, who became king in 1180, the Capetian hold on power was so strong that the practice of associate kingship was dropped. While the Capetian monarchy began as one of the weakest in Europe, drastically eclipsed by the new Anglo-Norman realm in England (who, as dukes of Normandy, were technically their vassals) and even other great lords of France, the political value of orderly succession in the Middle Ages cannot be overstated. The orderly succession of power from father to son over such a long period of time meant that the French monarchs, who originally were essentially just the direct rulers of the Île-de-France, were able to preserve and extend their power, while over the course of centuries the great peers of the realm would eventually lose their power in one succession crisis or another.\nBy comparison, the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem was constantly beset with internal succession disputes because each generation only produced female heirs who tended to die young. Even the English monarchy encountered severe succession crises, such as The Anarchy of the 1120s between Stephen and Matilda, and the murder of Arthur I, Duke of Brittany, the primogeniture heir of Richard I of England. The latter case would deal a severe blow to the prestige of King John, leading to the eventual destruction of Angevin hegemony in France. In contrast, the French kings were able to maintain uncontested father-to-son succession from the time of Hugh Capet until the succession crisis which began the Hundred Years' War of the 14th century.\nCapetians through history\n'']]\nOver the succeeding centuries, Capetians spread throughout Europe, ruling every form of provincial unit from kingdoms to manors.\nSalic law\nSalic law, re-established during the Hundred Years' War from an ancient Frankish tradition, caused the French monarchy to permit only male (agnatic) descendants of Hugh to succeed to the throne of France.\nWithout Salic law, upon the death of John I, the crown would have passed to his half-sister, Joan (later Joan II of Navarre). However, Joan's paternity was suspect due to her mother's adultery in the Tour de Nesle Affair; the French magnates adopted Salic law to avoid the succession of a possible bastard.\nIn 1328, King Charles IV of France died without male heirs, as his brothers did before him. Philip of Valois, the late king's first cousin, acted as regent, pending the birth of the king's posthumous child, which proved to be a girl. Isabella of France, sister of Charles IV, claimed the throne for her son, Edward III of England. The English king did not find support among the French lords, who made Philip of Valois their king. From then on the French succession not only excluded females but also rejected claims based on the female line of descent.\nThus the French crown passed from the House of Capet after the death of Charles IV to Philip VI of France of the House of Valois, a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty,\n*then to Louis II, Duke of Orléans, of the Orléans branch of the Valois, who became Louis XII,\n*then to Francis, Duke of Valois, Count of Angoulème, who became Francis I of France, and his descendants, of the Orléans-Angoulème,\n*then to Henry III of Navarre, who became Henry IV of France, of the House of Bourbon, a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty.\nThis did not affect monarchies not under that law such as Portugal, Spain, Navarre, and various smaller duchies and counties. Therefore, many royal families appear and disappear in the French succession or become cadet branches upon marriage. A complete list of the senior-most line of Capetians is available below.\nCapetian cadet branches\nThe Capetian dynasty has been broken many times into (sometimes rival) cadet branches. A cadet branch is a line of descent from another line than the senior-most.

Only in the time before Hugh Capet took the crown for himself and after the reign of Charles X is there a distinction such that the senior Capet must be identified independently from succession to the French Crown. However, since primogeniture and the Salic law provided for the succession of the French throne for most of French history, here is a list of all the French kings from Hugh until Charles, and all the Legitimist pretenders thereafter. All dates are for seniority, not reign.\nKing of France:\n* Hugh, King of France (987–996)\n* Robert II, King of France (996–1031)\n* Henry I, King of France (1031–1060)\n* Philip I, King of France (1060–1108)\n* Louis VI, King of France (1108–1137)\n* Louis VII, King of France (1137–1180)\n* Philip II, King of France (1180–1223)\n* Louis VIII, King of France (1223–1226)\n* Louis IX, King of France (1226–1270)\n* Philip III, King of France (1271–1285)\n* Philip IV, King of France (1285–1314)\n* Louis X, King of France (1314–1316)\n* John I, King of France (1316–1316)\n* Philip V, King of France (1316–1322)\n* Charles IV, King of France (1322–1328)\n* Philip VI, King of France (1328–1350)\n* John II, King of France (1350–1364)\n* Charles V, King of France (1364–1380)\n* Charles VI, King of France (1380–1422)\n* Charles VII, King of France (1422–1461)\n* Louis XI, King of France (1461–1483)\n* Charles VIII, King of France (1483–1498)\n* Louis XII, King of France (1498–1515)\n* Francis I, King of France (1515–1547)\n* Henry II, King of France (1547–1559)\n* Francis II, King of France (1559–1560)\n* Charles IX, King of France (1560–1574)\n* Henry III, King of France (1574–1589)\n* Henry IV, King of France (1589–1610)\n* Louis XIII, King of France (1610–1643)\n* Louis XIV, King of France (1643–1715)\n* Louis XV, King of France (1715–1774)\n* Louis XVI, King of France (1774–1793)\n* Louis XVII, King of France (1793–1795)\n* Louis XVIII, King of France (1795–1824)\n* Charles X, King of France (1824–1836)\nLegitimist Pretenders:\n* Louis Anthony, Duke of Angoulême (1836–1844)\n* Henry, Count of Chambord (1844–1883)\n* John, Count of Montizón (1883–1887)\n* Charles, Duke of Madrid (1887–1909)\n* James, Duke of Anjou and Madrid (1909–1931)\n* Alphonse Charles, Duke of San Jaime (1931–1936)\n* Alphonse XIII, King of Spain (1936–1941)\n* James Henry, Duke of Anjou and Segovia (1941–1975)\n* Alphonse, Duke of Anjou and Cádiz (1975–1989)\n* Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou (1989–)\nThe Capetian dynasty today\nMany years have passed since the Capetian monarchs ruled a large part of Europe; however, they still remain as kings, as well as other titles. Currently two Capetian monarchs still rule in Spain and Luxembourg. In addition, seven pretenders represent exiled dynastic monarchies in Brazil, France, Spain, Portugal, Parma and Two Sicilies. The current legitimate, senior family member is Louis-Alphonse de Bourbon, known by his supporters as Duke of Anjou, who also holds the Legitimist (''Blancs d'Espagne'') claim to the French throne. Overall, dozens of branches of the Capetian dynasty still exist throughout Europe.\nExcept for the House of Braganza (founded by an illegitimate son of King John I of Portugal, who was himself illegitimate), all current major Capetian branches are of the Bourbon cadet branch. Within the House of Bourbon, many of these lines are themselves well-defined cadet lines of the House.\nCurrent Capetian rulers\n* Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg (since 2000)\n*Felipe VI, King of Spain (since 2014)\nCurrent Capetian pretenders\n* Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou, Legitimist pretender to the Kingdom of France since 1989.\n* Prince Pedro, Duke of Calabria, Calabrian pretender to the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies since 2015.\n* Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro, Castroist pretender to the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies since 2008.\n* Carlos, Duke of Parma, pretender to the Duchy of Parma since 2010 and one of the Carlist pretenders to the Kingdom of Spain since 2010.\n* Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma, the other Carlist pretender to the Kingdom of Spain since 1979.\n* Jean, Count of Paris, Orléanist pretender to the Kingdom of France since 2019.\n* Prince Pedro Carlos of Orléans-Braganza, Petrópolis pretender to the Empire of Brazil since 2007.\n* Prince Bertrand of Orléans-Braganza, Vassouras pretender to the Empire of Brazil since 2022.\n* Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza, pretender to the Kingdom of Portugal since 1976.\n* Balthazar Napoleon IV de Bourbon, Raja of Bhopal of the Bourbon-Bhopal dynasty\n* Philippe, Count of Châlus of Bourbon-Busset\nArms of cadet branches\nFamily tree\nMale, male-line, legitimate, non-morganatic members of the house who either lived to adulthood, or who held a title as a child, are included.
