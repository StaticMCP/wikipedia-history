It was essentially the same role as the Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff: the post holder initially was the operational head of the Royal Navy and reported directly to the First Sea Lord.\nIn 1946 the office of the Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff was revived and the Vice Chief of the Naval Staff from that point reported to the Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff.\nFollowing internal re-structuring within the Ministry of Defence the position of Vice Chief of the Naval Staff was abolished in 1985.\nVice Chiefs of the Naval Staff\nVice Chiefs of the Naval Staff included:\nNote: reports to the First Sea Lord from 1941 to 1946  then reports to the DCNS from 1947 until 1985\n| ref               =\n}}\n| ref               =\n}}\n| ref               =\n}}\n| ref               =\n}}\n| ref               =\n}}\n| ref               =\n}}\n| ref               =\n}}\n| ref               =\n}}\n| ref               =\n}}\n| ref               =\n}}\n| ref               =\n}}\n| ref               =\n}}\n| ref               =\n}}\n| ref               =\n}}\n| ref               =\n}}\n| ref               =\n}}\n| ref               =\n}}\n| ref               =\n}}\n| ref               =\n}}\n| ref               =\n}}\nSee also\n*Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff\n*Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff\n*First Sea Lord\n*Second Sea Lord\n*Third Sea Lord\n*Fourth Sea Lord\n*Fifth Sea Lord\nReferences\nGeneral references\n*Primary source for this article is by Harley Simon, Lovell Tony, (2017), Vice Chief of Naval Staff, http://www.dreadnoughtproject.org.\n*[http://www.dreadnoughtproject.org/tfs/index.php?title=Assistant_Chief_of_Naval_Staff&redirect=no http://www.dreadnoughtproject.org/Assistant Chief of Naval Staff]\n*[http://www.gulabin.com/ http://www.gulabin.com/Royal Navy - Senior Appointments]\nExternal links"
