According to the lore, Goddess Lakshmi, despite being spouseless, worshipped Lord Shiva with the intention of marrying Lord Vishnu. This divine act led to the town being named Thiruthavathurai.\nFurthermore, the name of Lord Shiva associated with this temple, Saptharesheswarar, is derived from another significant event involving the Saptarishi. These revered sages, including Vasishtha, Atri, Bhrigu, Pulathiyar, Gowthamar, Angirasa, and Marichi, once worshipped the presiding deity of the temple. However, they were cursed because their wives neglected to feed baby Murugan and instead prioritized their service to their husbands during a pooja.\nUpon realizing the gravity of their actions, Karthikeya, also known as Murugan, reflected their curses back onto the sages. In order to absolve themselves of these curses, the Saptarishi undertook intense penance and worship, ultimately attaining liberation and ascending as seven stars in the sky.\nHence, the name Saptharesheswarar is a testament to this divine episode, signifying the connection between the seven sages and Lord Shiva, as well as their eventual attainment of moksha through penance and devotion.\nVaippu Sthalam\nIt is one of the shrines of the Vaippu Sthalams sung by Tamil Saivite Nayanar Appar. This place is also known as Thavathurai. In Thandakam this place is mentioned as Eluvar Thavathurai. As per Hindu legend, the seven stars or the Saptarishi are believed to have worshipped the presiding deity of the temple after which the temple came to be known as Saptharishishwarar.\nPresiding deity\nThe presiding deity in the garbhagriha, represented by the lingam, is known as Saptharishishwarar. The Goddess is known as Mahasampath Gowri and Periyanayaki.srimathi, perunduraiperatiyar. The lingam has some cracks on it.\nSpecialities\nShiva sculpture is found with Khaṭvāṅga in this temple, Ekambaranathar Temple and Valisvarar Temple.  Their sculptures are found in this temple. This place is also sung of in the Thiruppugazh. Inscriptions with Thiruppugazh songs are found next to the shrine of Vinayaka. Tyagaraja came here and sang five kirtanas. They are found in the inscriptions. Paraitthurai, Thenpalaithurai, Thavathurai, Mayiladuthurai, Kadambandurai, and Avaduthurai are the places where Shiva is residing and should be worshipped by one and all. Among them this place is also found.\nFestivals\nSivarathri, Karthikai, Margazhi Tiruvathirai, Panguni Ther Thiruvizha  are held in this temple.\nLalgudi Big Chariot\nThe festival commences with five major chariots: Vinayagar, Murugan, Shvan (Saptharesiawarar), Amman (Perunduraiperatiyar/Srimahi Amman), and Chandegeswarar chariots. The Lalgudi Saptharesiswarar Temple chariots holds a rich historical significance dating back to ancient times, when the chariot was originally known as \"Theruadachan\", signifying the seemingly endless nature of its procession along the streets. Notably, it took nearly six months to complete a single circuit round along the four streets, with the assistance of elephants and the participation of six surrounding villagers. However, in 1936, the chariot faced temporary closure due to issues related to independence struggles and the scarcity of elephants. After a hiatus of 75 years, in 2011, Minister K. N. Nehru oversaw extensive renovations, costing ₹1 crore, with assistance from BHEL Trichy. The chariot was reinstated for the public's delight, now featuring six iron wheels, three hydraulic brakes, and iron plates. Adorned with over 2000+ sculptures crafted from mahua tree woods, the imposing 30-foot-tall wooden chariot with 4 major outer iron wheels with a height of 9&nbsp;ft and 2 inner iron wheels with a height of 7&nbsp;ft stands as the largest and highest in Trichy. During the Panguni Ther Thiruvizha festival held in March/April, the chariot is beautifully decorated, reaching a total height of 96–100&nbsp;ft. It is noteworthy that this chariot ranks as the second-highest/tallest chariot and is among the top 10 largest chariots in Tamil Nadu.\nLocation\nThe temple is located at Lalgudi, very near to Trichy. After crossing the railway line in Lalgudi on the bus route, the temple can be reached at a distance of 2 km.  It is opened for worship from 6.00 to 11.30 a.m. and 4.00 to 9.00 p.m.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?pagename=Saptharishishwarar_Temple,_Lalgudi&params=10_52_13_N_78_49_14_E_type:landmark GeoHack - Saptharishishwarar Temple, Lalgudi]"
