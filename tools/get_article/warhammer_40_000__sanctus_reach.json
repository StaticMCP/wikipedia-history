A few teething issues, but nothing to really worry about.\" Robinson also reviewed the second DLC pack, Sons of Cadia, saying: \"Sons of Cadia can feel a bit more of a slog than the other campaigns at times, but the devs creativity and reverence does still shine In moments of glory.\" Alex Connolly reviewed the third DLC pack, Horrors of the Warp, for Strategy Gamer and said that \"[i]f Straylight are able to loosen up the persnickety interface and inject as much pizzazz into map and mission design as they have with the unit models, expansions like Horrors of the Warp would soar. As it stands right now, the expansion is merely ‘good’, and the only modifier would be how much Chaos floats your boat.\"\nIn a retrospective, Jody Macgregor of PC Gamer said the game is \"[...] not bad, but it is basic\" and \"everything on the presentation side, from unit types to animation to level furniture, feels like the absolute minimum, where 40K should be all about maximalism.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
