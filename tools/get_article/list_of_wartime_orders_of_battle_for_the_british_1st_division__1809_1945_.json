It can provide information on the strength of that formation and the equipment used. An order of battle is not necessarily a set structure, and it can change depending on tactical or strategic developments, or the evolution of military doctrine. For example, a division could be altered radically from one campaign to another through the adding or removing of subunits but retain its identity and prior history. The size of a division can vary dramatically as a result of what forces are assigned and the doctrine employed at that time.\nThe 1st Division was an infantry division of the British Army, which was formed numerous times from 1809 to present. Several formations bore the name \"1st Division\", from 1809 through to the end of the 19th century. Per the 1st Division's official website, its lineage is described as including the Peninsular War, the Battle of Waterloo, the Crimean War, the Anglo-Zulu War, and the Second Boer War. In 1902, following reforms within the British Army, a permanent 1st Division was formed that fought in both world wars.\nThe original 1st Division, formed in 1809, was around 6,000 men strong. This formation did not include supporting weapons such as artillery. In comparison, when the formation fought in the Second World War, it was over 18,000 men strong, supported by 72 artillery pieces, and numerous other support weapons. Each war that the division fought in, from inception up until the end of the Second World War, has a corresponding order of battle section.\nNapoleonic Wars\n, John Coape Sherbrooke; Oil-on-canvas painting by Robert Field, .]]\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815), the British Army grew in size. On 18 June 1809, Lieutenant-General Arthur Wellesley, commander of the British forces in Spain and Portugal, ordered the creation of four divisions, including the 1st Division. During the division's first action of the Peninsular War (the name given to Napoleonic Wars fought in Spain and Portugal), the Battle of Talavera (1809), it was 5,964 men strong. It roughly maintained this strength for the rest of the Peninsular War, for example being 4,854 men strong at the Battle of Vittoria in 1813. It was disbanded when the fighting ended in 1814. It was reformed on 11 April 1815, in the Southern Netherlands (modern-day Belgium), upon the resumption of hostilities. It fought at the Battle of Waterloo, where it had a strength of 4,061 men. It then marched into France. Shortly after, the Napoleonic Wars came to a conclusion. The division remained in the restored French kingdom, as part of the British Army of Occupation. In December 1818, the Army of Occupation and the division were disbanded, and the troops returned to Britain.\nTalavera campaign (July 1809)\n1st Division\nCampbell's Brigade:\n* 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards\n* 1st Battalion, 3rd Regiment of Foot Guards\n* 5th Battalion, 60th (Royal American) Regiment (one company)\nCameron's Brigade:\n* 1st Battalion, 61st (South Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot\n* 2nd Battalion, 83rd (County of Dublin) Regiment of Foot\n* 5th Battalion, 60th (Royal American) Regiment (one company)\nLangwerth's Brigade:\n* 1st Line Battalion, King's German Legion\n* 2nd Line Battalion, King's German Legion\n* Light Companies, King's German Legion\nLow's Brigade:\n* 5th Line Battalion, King's German Legion\n* 7th Line Battalion, King's German Legion\nBattle of Bussaco (September 1810)\nDuring this period, brigades were referred to by their commander's names.

The division proceeded to the Crimea, where it landed on 14 September. It was then engaged in the Siege of Sevastopol, including action at the battles of Alma and the Inkerman. At full strength, the division would have been around 4,800 men strong although at the Battle of Inkerman it contained a mere 1,200 infantry. The division remained in the Crimea until 1856, and demobilised following the conclusion of hostilities.\nAugust–October 1854\n1st Division\n1st Guards Brigade\n* 3rd Battalion, Grenadier Guards\n* 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards\n* 1st Battalion, Scots Guards\n2nd Highland Brigade\n* 42nd (Highland) Regiment of Foot\n* 79th (The Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders) Regiment of Foot\n* 93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot (detached in October 1854)\nDivisional Artillery:\n* A Field Battery (2nd Company, 8th Battalion)\n* H Field Battery (5th Company, 11th Battalion)\nNovember 1854–May 1855\n1st Division\n1st Guards Brigade\n* 3rd Battalion, Grenadier Guards\n* 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards\n* 1st Battalion, Scots Guards\n* 97th (The Earl of Ulster's) Regiment of Foot (had joined by January 1855)\nDivisional Artillery:\n* A Field Battery (2nd Company, 8th Battalion)\n* H Field Battery (5th Company, 11th Battalion)\nJune 1855\n1st Division\n1st Guards Brigade\n* 3rd Battalion, Grenadier Guards\n* 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards\n* 1st Battalion, Scots Guards\n2nd Highland Brigade\n* 42nd (Highland) Regiment of Foot\n* 79th (The Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders) Regiment of Foot\n* 93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot\nAugust 1855–end of the war\n1st Division\n1st Guards Brigade\n* 3rd Battalion, Grenadier Guards\n* 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards\n* 1st Battalion, Scots Guards\n2nd Brigade\n* 9th Regiment of Foot\n* 13th Regiment of Foot\n* 31st (Huntingdonshire) Regiment of Foot\n* 2nd Battalion, Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort's Own) (had left by September)\n* 56th (West Essex) Regiment of Foot (had joined by September)\nDivisional Artillery:\n* X Field Battery (temporarily detached from the division during September fighting)\nAnglo-Zulu War\nThe Anglo-Zulu War broke out in January 1879. After three months of back and forth fighting, which saw the battles of Isandlwana and Rorke's Drift, reinforcements were dispatched to Natal for a renewed offensive. This saw the creation of No. 1 Division, which was just over 9,000 men strong. The force comprised 6,508 British regulars and colonial irregular troops, supplemented by 2,707 Africans that included 151 mounted troops. The division saw little fighting and was largely engaged in engineering work. When the war ended, the division was broken-up in July.\nwarrior from this period; National Army Museum, London]]\nNo. 1 Division\n1st brigade\n* 2nd Battalion, 3rd Regiment of Foot\n* 88th Regiment of Foot (Connaught Rangers)\n* 99th (Lanarkshire) Regiment of Foot\n2nd Brigade\n* 57th (West Middlesex) Regiment of Foot\n* 3rd Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps\n* 91st (Argyllshire Highlanders) Regiment of Foot\nDivisional troops\n* Three batteries, Royal Artillery\n* Naval Brigade (artillery)\n* Ammunition column, Royal Artillery\n* 30th Company, Royal Engineers\n* 4th Battalion, Natal Native Contingent\n* 5th Battalion, Natal Native Contingent\n* John Robert Dunn's scouts\n* Attached mounted troops\nSecond Boer War\nA new 1st Division was mobilised in England, following the outbreak of the Second Boer War with the South African Republic and the Orange Free State. On mobilisation, the division consisted of 10,075 men, 745 horses, and 26 guns. It was transported to southern Africa, and then fought a series of battles as part of the attempt to lift the Siege of Kimberley, with mixed results and heavy casualties. During the opening months of 1900, the division held a largely defensive role although it did commit raids to destroy farms, crops, and to seize livestock. Between April and early June, it engaged various Boer Commandos as it marched through the Orange Free State and Transvaal. In mid-June, the division was radically changed in an effort to form a more mobile force to counter the Boer guerrilla warfare tactics. By the end of the year, it had been disbanded as the counter-guerrilla strategy was further refined.\nAt its first engagement, the Battle of Belmont, the formation consisted of 10,012 troops, 2,299 animals, 16 pieces of artillery, and 10 machine guns. A fortnight later, the division was reinforced for the Battle of Magersfontein and mustered 14,964 men supported by 3,723 animals, 33 artillery pieces, and 16 machine guns. In June 1900, when the division was reformed into a flying column, there was a significant reduction in manpower in order to be more mobile. At that time, it consisted of 1,200 mounted troops, 2,400 infantry, 12 field guns, two  howitzers, and 11 machine guns.\nOn mobilisation in 1899\n1st Division\n1st Infantry Brigade\n* 3rd Battalion, Grenadier Guards\n* 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards\n* 2nd battalion, Coldstream Guards\n* 1st Battalion, Scots Guards\n* No. 1 Bearer Company\n* No. 1 Field Hospital\n2nd Infantry Brigade\n* 2nd Battalion, Royal West Surrey Regiment\n* 2nd Battalion, Devonshire Regiment\n* 2nd Battalion, West Yorkshire Regiment\n* 2nd Battalion, East Surrey Regiment\n* No. 4 Bearer Company\n* No. 3 Field Hospital\nDivisional Troops\n* Divisional artillery, Royal Field Artillery\n** 7th Battery\n** 14th Battery\n** 66th Battery\n** Ammunition column\n* Divisional engineers, Royal Engineers\n* No. 7 Field Hospital\n* A Squadron, 1st Life Guards\nBelmont to Magersfontein (November–December 1899)\n1st Division\n1st (Guards) Brigade\n* 3rd Battalion, Grenadier Guards\n* 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards\n* 2nd battalion, Coldstream Guards\n* 1st Battalion, Scots Guards\n9th Infantry Brigade\n* 1st Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers\n* 1st Battalion, Loyal North Lancashire Regiment (only half the battalion was present, the remainder formed part of the Kimberley garrison)\n* 2nd Battalion, Northamptonshire Regiment\n* 2nd Battalion, King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry\n* No. 1 Field Hospital\n3rd (Highland) Brigade (arrived by 10 December for Magersfontein)\n* 2nd Battalion, Royal Highlanders (Black Watch)\n* 2nd Battalion, Seaforth Highlanders\n* 1st Battalion, Highland Light Infantry\n* 1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders\n* No. 2 Field Hospital\n* 'A' Bearer Company\nDivisional Mounted Troops\n* 9th Lancers\n* 12th Lancers (arrived by 10 December for Magersfontein)\n* One company of mounted infantry, Northumberland Fusiliers\n* One company of mounted infantry, Loyal North Lancashire Regiment\n* Half a company of mounted infantry, King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry\n* Detachment from the New South Wales Lancers\n* Rimington's Guides\nDivisional Troops\n* Divisional artillery, Royal Field Artillery\n** 18th Battery\n** 75th Battery\n** 62nd Battery (arrived in time for Modder River)\n** 65th (Howitzer) Battery (arrived by 10 December for Magersfontein)\n* G Battery, Royal Horse Artillery (arrived by 10 December for Magersfontein)\n* Divisional engineers, Royal Engineers\n** 7th Field Company\n** 8th Railway Company\n** 11th Field Company\n** 30th Fortress Company\n** Telegraph section\n* No. 3 Field Hospital\n* Naval Brigade\n* 1st Battalion, Gordon Highlanders (arrived by 10 December for Magersfontein)\nBased out of Kimberley (late February–May 1900)\n1st Division\nLeo Amery, in The Times History of the War in South Africa 1899–1902, provided the following order of battle:\n9th Brigade: 1st Northumberland Fusiliers, 1st Loyal North Lancashire Regiment, 3rd South Wales Borderers, 2nd Northamptonshire Regiment\n20th Brigade: 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers, 2nd Yorkshire Light Infantry, 4th Scottish Rifles, 4th South Staffordshire Regiment\nImperial Yeomanry brigade: 3rd, 5th, 10th, and 15th Battalions, and Warwick's Scouts\nDivisional artillery: 4th, 20th, and 38th Field Batteries, Royal Field Artillery; 37th Howitzer Battery, Royal Field Artillery; 'H' Section, pom-poms; Diamond Fields Artillery; 23rd Company, Royal Garrison Artillery\nDivisional troops: 11th Company, Royal Engineers}}\n9th Brigade\n* 1st Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers\n* 1st Battalion, Loyal North Lancashire Regiment\n* 3rd Battalion, South Wales Borderers\n* 4th Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)\n* Detachment from the Army Service Corps\n* No. 1 Bearer Company\n* No. 19 Field Hospital\n20th Brigade\n* 2nd Battalion, Northamptonshire Regiment\n* 2nd Battalion, King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry\n* 1st Battalion, Royal Munster Fusiliers\n* 4th Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment\n* Detachment from the Army Service Corps\n* Ad hoc bearer company\n* No. 8 Field Hospital\nImperial Yeomanry brigade\n* 3rd Battalion\n* 5th Battalion\n* 10th Battalion\n* Kimberley Mounted Corps\nDivisional Troops\n* Divisional artillery, Royal Field Artillery\n** 4th Battery\n** 20th Battery\n** 38th Battery\n** 37th Howitzer Battery\n** Diamond Fields Artillery\nJune 1900 onwards\n1st Division (Methuen's Column)\n* 1st Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers\n* 2nd Northamptonshire Regiment\n* 1st Loyal North Lancashire Regiment\n* Imperial Yeomanry\n** 5th Battalion\n** 10th Battalion\n** 15th Battalion\n* Detachment of mounted infantry\n* Detachment of Warwick's Scouts\n* Divisional artillery, Royal Field Artillery\n** 4th Battery\n** 20th Battery\n** 38th Battery\n* Three sections, 11th Field Company, Royal Engineers\nFirst World War\nOn 28 July 1914, the First World War began. On 4 August, Germany invaded Belgium and the United Kingdom entered the war against the German Empire. The division soon deployed to France, as part of the British Expeditionary Force, and it then served on the Western Front between 1914 and 1918.\nThe war establishment (on-paper strength), of an infantry division in 1914 was 18,179 men, 5,594 horses, 18 motor vehicles, 76 pieces of artillery, and 24 machine guns. While there was a small alteration to the number of men and horses were supposed to be in a division in 1915, the main change was the decrease in artillery pieces to 48 and an increase in motor vehicles to 54. The establishment in 1916 increased the division size to 19,372 men, 5,145 horses, 61 motor vehicles, 64 artillery pieces, 40 trench mortars, and 200 machine guns. The 1917 changes saw a decrease to 18,825 men, 4,342 horses, 57 motor vehicles, and 48 artillery pieces, although the number of trench mortars remained the same, and the number of machine guns increased to 264. By 1918, the number of front line infantry within the British Army in France had decreased because of casualties and a lack of eligible replacements, and this led to a manpower crisis. To consolidate manpower and to increase the ratio of machine guns and artillery support available to the infantry, the number of battalions in a division was reduced from twelve to nine. This resulted in the 1918 establishment of 16,035 men, 3,838 horses, 79 motor vehicles, 48 artillery pieces, 36 trench mortars, and 400 machine guns.\nFirst World War (1914–1918)\n1st Division\n1st

following the German invasion of Poland, the United Kingdom declared war in support of the latter and entered the Second World War. The division, now styled as an infantry division, saw combat in France in 1940. After the British Army's defeat, the division returned to—and defended—the UK. Between June and November 1942, it was reorganised as a \"mixed division\", which saw an infantry brigade removed replaced by a brigade of tanks. Afterwards, it reverted to an infantry division and was deployed to fight in the Tunisian campaign in 1943. It then seized the island of Pantelleria and subsequently fought in the Italian campaign until January 1945. Afterwards, it was withdrawn to Palestine, where it spent the remainder of the war.\nThe war establishment of the infantry division in 1939 was 13,863 men, 2,993 vehicles, 72 artillery pieces, 48 anti-tank guns, 361 anti-tank rifles, 126 mortars, and 700 machine guns.
