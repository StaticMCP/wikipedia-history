In the March 1, 2016, primary she received 27% of the vote, with Dawn Buckingham receiving 25% of the vote. Because neither candidate received a majority, they advanced to a runoff election in May. After a contentious campaign focusing on the records and geographic profiles of the two candidates, Buckingham won the runoff with over 60% of the vote.\nAfter leaving politics she obtained her master’s degree in social work and Christian ministry at Abilene Christian University.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://ballotpedia.org/Susan_King Susan King] at Ballotpedia"
