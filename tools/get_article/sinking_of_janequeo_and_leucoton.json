As the anchor chain broke, the ship ran aground. The naval authorities immediately sent Janequeo under the command of Marcelo Léniz Bennet, to free Leucotón. On board was a rescue team of fixed men under the command of Claudio Hemmerdinger.\nThe crew of Leucotón made it safely to shore but despite days of effort, she could not be freed.\nAt 16:00 on 14 August, a tow-line got entangled in the propeller of Janequeo. Despite the intensive work of Hemmerdinger's frogmen, it was not possible to free the screw. Casma and Yelcho were now ordered to the rescue, but they could not enter Manquemapu Bay, due to waves over  high. That day Janequeo repeatedly struck the rock Campanario, and although still afloat, was partially flooded.\nAt 9:20 on 15 August, Janequeo broke in two. Only 28 men of the crew survived and made it safely to shore, but 51 men were lost.\nAftermath\nOn 15 September 1965 appeared the first edition of the Chilean magazine Punto Final with an analysis of the disaster of Janequeo. Journalist Miguel Torres accused the admiralty of the Chilean Navy for the disaster.\nThe Leucotón shipwreck is still rusting on the beach of Manquemapu.\nThe patrol boat Fuentealba (15 t), the landing ship Hemmerdinger (1500 t) and patrol boat Odger (215 t) of the Chilean Navy are named after three of the sailors who died in the disaster.\nSee also\n* List of decommissioned ships of the Chilean Navy\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Omar Valdivieso Véliz, [http://www.ligamar.cl/revis10/81.htm Los Condenados de la Mar], retrieved on 25 September 2013\n* Fotos of the ships in [https://web.archive.org/web/20100914052850/http://base.mforos.com/1716041/4905767-patrulleros-clase-sotoyomo-pp-62-lautaro-pp-60-lientur-ypp-61-leucoton/ webarchiv] of [http://base.mforos.com/1716041/4905767-patrulleros-clase-sotoyomo-pp-62-lautaro-pp-60-lientur-ypp-61-leucoton/]\n* Pamela Altamirano Cárdenas and Miriam Margarita Bernal Poblete [https://web.archive.org/web/20130927015617/http://www.migranchile.cl/maravpurranque33.html Caleta Manquemapu]"
