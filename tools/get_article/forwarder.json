Forwarders can use rubber tires or tracks. Unlike a skidder, a forwarder carries logs clear of the ground, which can reduce soil impacts but tends to limit the size of the logs it can move. Forwarders are typically employed together with harvesters in cut-to-length logging operations. Forwarders originated in Scandinavia.\nLoad capacity\nForwarders are commonly categorized by their load carrying capabilities. Other classifications include whether they are wheeled or tracked and the axle arrangement. The smallest are trailers designed for towing behind all-terrain vehicles which can carry a load between 1 and 3&nbsp;tonnes. Agricultural self-loading trailers designed to be towed by farm tractors can handle load weights up to around 12 to 15&nbsp;tonnes. Light weight purpose-built machines utilised in commercial logging and early thinning operations can handle payloads of up to 8 tonnes. Medium-sized forwarders used in clearfells and later thinnings carry between 12 and 16&nbsp;tonnes. The largest class specialized for clearfells handles up to 25&nbsp;tonnes. Forwarders also carry their load at least 2&nbsp;feet above the ground.\nManufacturers\n* Barko Hydraulics, LLC\n* Caterpillar Inc.\n* John Deere (Timberjack)\n* EcoLog\n* Fabtek\n* HSM\n* HSM (Hohenloher Spezial Maschinenbau GmbH, Germany)\n* Komatsu Forest (Valmet)\n* Kronos\n* Logset\n* Malwa\n* Neuson Forest\n* PM Pfanzelt Maschinenbau\n* Ponsse\n* Rottne\n* Strojirna Novotny\n* Tigercat\n* Timber Pro\n* Zanello\n*\nReferences\nExternal links"
