The oldest part of the current building is at the rear of the site, facing onto Pump Court.  It is a three-storey timber framed building, dating from the 16th century, and both the upper storeys are jettied.  It appears that this building suffered some subsidence, and several braces were added, to counter this.\nThe front block of the building is also three storeys high.  It was originally timber-framed and jettied, but in 1755 it was remodelled, and the front wall was rebuilt in brick.  In the 19th century, shop windows were added on the ground floor of the building.\nThe entire building was largely rebuilt in 1951.  The front retains only the cornice of the 1755 structure, but other features such as its windows, and a drainpipe head dated 1755, are copies of the 18th-century work.  Inside, some beams and a fireplace survive from the 18th-century building.  In the rear block, much of the second-floor frame is 16th century, in addition to a few ground-floor beams.  The basement has stone walls, reused square stone column bases, and massive oak posts.\nThe building was Grade II listed in 1954.\nReferences"
