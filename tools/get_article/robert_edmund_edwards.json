Edwards, was a British-born Australian mathematician who specialized in functional analysis.\nHe is the author of several volumes in Springer's Graduate Texts in Mathematics.\nHe received his PhD at Birkbeck College, University of London in 1951 under Lionel Cooper. His dissertation topic was Theory of Normed Rings, and Translations in Function Spaces. He continued to teach there as a lecturer until 1959, and then spent a few years at Manchester, before migrating to Australia in 1961, where he worked at the Institute of Advanced Studies at ANU as a professorial fellow (1961-1970) and professor of mathematics (1970-1978).\nSelected publications\n*Functional Analysis: Theory and Applications.
