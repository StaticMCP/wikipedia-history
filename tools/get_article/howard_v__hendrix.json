The purpose of the posting was to explain, in part, why he would not be seeking the presidency of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America after having served as its vice president. He criticized authors who offer their works for free on the internet, either as written works, or recorded as podcasts. His comments have drawn criticism from a number of other authors, such as Jo Walton, Michael A. Stackpole, John Scalzi, and David Wellington, and resulted in International Pixel-Stained Technopeasant Day.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://archive.today/20120712231621/http://papersky.livejournal.com/320114.html Celebration of International Pixel-Stained Technopeasant Day]\n*"
