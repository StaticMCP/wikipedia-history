Since 2002, Cinema for Peace has been inviting film makers, humanitarian and human rights activists, and public figures to its annual awards ceremony in Berlin to honor a selection of cinematic works on humanitarian and environmental issues. The event occurs at the same time as (but not as part of) the Berlin International Film Festival.\nHistory\nFollowing the September 11 attacks in 2001, Jaka Bizilj launched the Cinema for Peace initiative with the annual gala as a platform for communicating humanitarian, political and social issues through the medium of film. Bob Geldof described the awards gala as \"the Oscars with brains\".\nActivities\nCinema for Peace as global initiative regularly acts in many countries. Cinema for Peace screenings, campaigns, advocacy events, and galas have been taking place for example at the Filmfestival in Cannes, in Los Angeles on the occasions of the Golden Globes  and on Oscar weekend, in Uganda at the conference of the International Criminal Court, and in Berlin, where Cinema for Peace annually highlights the most valuable films of the year at the Cinema for Peace Gala.\nThe Cinema for Peace Foundation organizes various monthly screenings, mainly through partnering cinemas, such as the Schikaneder in Vienna\nCinema for Peace distributed the Bosnian Oscar-winning war satire ''No Man's Land by Danis Tanovic.\nIn 2014, Jaka Bizilj as the Founder of Cinema for Peace invited Pussy Riot to the Olympic Games in Sochi and brought them to Hollywood and to Washington in order to promote global human rights responsibility and advocate a global Sanction List for human rights offenders.\nCommittee and supporters\nAmong the Cinema for Peace speakers have been: Buzz Aldrin, Antonio Banderas, Deepak Chopra, George Clooney, Catherine Deneuve, Leonardo DiCaprio, Bob Geldof, Richard Gere, Dustin Hoffman, Elton John, Nicole Kidman, Sir Christopher Lee, Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon, Hilary Swank, Wim Wenders, Ban Ki-moon, Luis Moreno-Ocampo and Fatou Bensouda as well as Mikhail Gorbachev.\nAwards\n2004\n* The Cinema for Peace Dove for The Most Valuable Film of the Year: Country of My Skull by John Boorman\n2005\n* The Cinema for Peace Dove for The Most Valuable Film of the Year: Hotel Rwanda by Terry George\n2006\n* The Cinema for Peace Dove for The Most Valuable Film of the Year: Good Night, and Good Luck by George Clooney\n2007\n* The Cinema for Peace Dove for The Most Valuable Film of the Year: Flags of Our Fathers by Clint Eastwood;  Letters from Iwo Jima by Clint Eastwood\n2008\n*The Cinema for Peace Dove for The Most Valuable Film of the Year:  Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud\n*The Cinema for Peace Dove for The Most Valuable Documentary of the Year: Trouble - Teatime in Heiligendamm by Mind Pirates Community\n* The International Green Film Award:  Earth by Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield\n* Special Award: the makers of The Experimental Witch'', initiated by Paolo Coelho and created with the original work of 14 filmmakers from around the world.\n2009\n*The Cinema for Peace Dove for The Most Valuable Film of the Year: Milk by Gus Van Sant\n*The Cinema for Peace Dove for The Most Valuable Documentary of the Year: Das Herz von Jenin by Marcus Vetter and Lior Geller\n* The Cinema for Peace Dove for Justice: Pray the Devil Back to Hell by Gini Reticker\n* The International Green Film Award:  Fields of Fuel by Josh Tickell\n2010\n*The Cinema for Peace Dove for The Most Valuable Film of the Year: The White Ribbon by Michael Haneke\n*The Cinema for Peace Dove for The Most Valuable Documentary of the Year: Das Mädchen und das Foto by Marc Wiese\n* The Cinema for Peace Dove for Justice: Children of War by Bryan Single; The Stoning of Soraya M. by Cyrus Nowrasteh\n* The International Green Film Award:  Crude by Joe Berlinger\n2011\n*The Cinema for Peace Dove for The Most Valuable Film of the Year: Of Gods and Men by Xavier Beauvois\n* The Cinema for Peace Dove for The Most Valuable Documentary of the Year: Skateistan: Four Wheels and a Board in Kabul by Kai Sehr\n* The Cinema for Peace Dove for Justice: Blood in the Mobile by Frank Piasecki Poulsen\n* The International Green Film Award:  Message from Pandora by James Cameron, Harmony: A New Way of Looking at Our World by Julie Bergman, Sender Stuart Sender; Jane's Journey by Lorenz Knauer\n2012\n*The Cinema for Peace Dove for The Most Valuable Film of the Year: In the Land of Blood and Honey by Angelina Jolie\n* The Cinema for Peace Dove for The Most Valuable Documentary of the Year: Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory by Joe Berlinger\n* The Cinema for Peace Dove for Justice: Granito by Pamela Yates; Justice for Sergei by Hans Hermans and Martin Maat\n* The International Green Film Award:  Burning in the Sun by Cambria Matlow and  Morgan Robinson\n2013\n*The Cinema for Peace Dove for The Most Valuable Film of the Year: Lincoln by Steven Spielberg\n* The Cinema for Peace Dove for The Most Valuable Documentary of the Year:  Searching for Sugar Man by Malik Bendjelloul; The Gatekeepers by Dror Moreh\n* The Cinema for Peace Dove for Justice: No by Pablo Larraín\n* The International Green Film Award:  Bitter Seeds by Micha X.
