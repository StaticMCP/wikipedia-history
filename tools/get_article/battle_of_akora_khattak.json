The attack was successful, resulting in significant casualties for the opposition.\nBattle\nAkora, located 18 miles from Attock across the Indus, held strategic importance. The area was inhabited by Khattak Afghans led by Najaf Khan, who retreated into the hills when the Sikhs conquered Peshawar. At this time, Budh Singh Sandhanwalia was stationed in Akora with 4,000 troops. Sayyid Ahmad Barelvi gathered his soldiers for a nocturnal assault. In the early morning of 21 December 1826, when the Sikhs were sleeping in the bitter cold, Allahbakhsh Khan led the Ghazis in their attack and repulsed the Sikhs. Sayyid's forces lost 36 Hindustanis and 46 Kandaharis, including Patna's Maulvi Baqar Ali and their leader Allahbakhsh Khan, while the Sikhs lost between 500 and 700 well-equipped soldiers.\nAftermath\nFollowing the successful guerrilla attack, the Yusufzai and Khattak tribesmen, having suffered very few casualties, returned to the hills. Subsequently, these tribesmen launched numerous guerrilla attacks against the Sikhs. The Sayyid's army again attacked the Sikhs which ultimately led to the Battle of Shaidu.\nSee also\n* Battle of Shaidu\n* Battle of Haidru (1828)\n* Battle of Balakot\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n* [https://archive.org/details/HistoryOfTheSikhsVol.VTheSikhLionOfLahoremaharajaRanjitSingh/page/n173/mode/2up?view=theater&q=Akora]"
