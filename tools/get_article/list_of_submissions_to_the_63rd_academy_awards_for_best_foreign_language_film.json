The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film was created in 1956 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to honour non-English-speaking films produced outside the United States. The award is handed out annually, and is accepted by the winning film's director, although it is considered an award for the submitting country as a whole. Countries are invited by the Academy to submit their best films for competition according to strict rules, with only one film being accepted from each country.\nFor the 63rd Academy Awards, thirty-seven films were submitted in the category Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The five nominated films came from China, France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland. Chile submitted a film for the first time. While Germany submitted for the first time after its reunification, previously submitting as East Germany and West Germany.\nSwitzerland won for the second time with Journey of Hope by Xavier Koller.\nSubmissions\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!

The film was officially selected by China's national film board, which later unsuccessfully tried to persuade the Academy to withdraw the film.\n* The 1981 Romanian film Carnival Scenes had been banned in Romania and was not released in local theatres. Since the film had never been released, the Academy initially accepted it as a new film. However, while the film was listed on AMPAS' Fall 1991 press release, it was not listed in a 2007 updated list. It is unknown whether the film actually screened or was disqualified.\nReferences\n;General\n*\n;Specific"
