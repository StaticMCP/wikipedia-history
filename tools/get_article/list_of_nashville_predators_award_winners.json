Sixteen All-Star Games have been held since the Nashville Predators entered the league in 1998, with at least one player chosen to represent the Predators in eleven of the games. The All-Star game has not been held in various years: 1979 and 1987 due to the 1979 Challenge Cup and Rendez-vous '87 series between the NHL and the Soviet national team, respectively, 1995, 2005, and 2013 as a result of labor stoppages, 2006, 2010, and 2014 because of the Winter Olympic Games, 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2025 when it was replaced by the 2025 4 Nations Face-Off. Nashville has hosted one of the games. The 61st was held at Bridgestone Arena.\n* Selected by fan vote\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n|+Nashville Predators players and coaches selected to the All-Star Game\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Game\n!scope=\"col\" | Year\n!scope=\"col\" | Name\n!scope=\"col\" | Position\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| References\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 49th\n| 1999\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 50th\n|2000\n| (Did not play)\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 51st\n|2001\n|No Predators selected\n|—\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 52nd\n|2002\n|No Predators selected\n|—\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 53rd\n|2003\n|No Predators selected\n|—\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 54th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2004\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 55th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2007\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 56th\n|2008\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 57th\n|2009\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 58th\n|2011\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 59th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2012\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" | 60th\n|rowspan=\"4\" |2015\n| (Replaced Evgeni Malkin)\n|\n|rowspan=\"4\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n| (Did not play)\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" | 61st\n|rowspan=\"4\" |2016\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"4\" |\n|-\n| (Replaced Jonathan Toews)\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 62nd\n|2017\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" | 63rd\n|rowspan=\"3\" |2018\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 64th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2019\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 65th\n|2020\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 66th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2022\n| (Replaced Nathan MacKinnon)\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 67th\n|2023\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 68th\n|2024\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nCareer achievements\nHockey Hall of Fame\nThe following is a list of Nashville Predators who have been enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n|+Nashville Predators inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame\n! scope=\"col\" |Individual\n! scope=\"col\" |Category\n! scope=\"col\" |Year inducted\n! scope=\"col\" |Years with Predators in category\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |References\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2014\n|2007\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2017\n|2005–2007\n|\n|}\nLester Patrick Trophy\nThe Lester Patrick Trophy has been presented by the National Hockey League and USA Hockey since 1966 to honor a recipient's contribution to ice hockey in the United States.
