Depending on departmental policy, this could mean it is either unit #4854 (identifying a specific officer and assignment), or car #4854 (identifying a specific vehicle in the agency's fleet).]]\nAerial roof markings are symbols, letters, or numbers on the top of fleet vehicles to allow aircraft or closed-circuit television cameras to identify them from overhead. The purpose of these marking vary, but are generally used to identify a specific vehicle, vehicle type, operator, assignment, or role. The markings are commonly placed on the roof of the vehicle, but can also be placed on the hood, trunk, or other parts of the vehicle visible from above. They are commonly found on emergency vehicles such as police vehicles, fire engines, ambulances, and coast guard vehicles, but also cash-in-transit vans, buses, and boats.\nAustralia\nDifferent state police forces in Australia use different aerial roof markings to designate specific vehicles, duty types and areas.\nNew South Wales Police Force\nRedfern Local Area Command 35, displaying aerial markings on the roof and bonnet. \"RF\" denotes the Command, being Redfern, while \"35\" denotes its use as a general duties sedan.\nLocal Area Commands vehicle bonnet/roof codes\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n!

Example: \"BF-07967\" allocates an aerial ID of \"7967\". These markings do not denote a vehicles callsign.\nThe South Australian Country Fire Service have an infrared beacon on the roof of most new appliances and the vehicle call sign. As all trucks are named and numbered according to their location, capacity and capability (e.g. Hynam 34, Location: Hynam, 3000L, 4WD or Belair 34P, Location Belair, 3000L, 4WD, Pumper), their call sign is also placed on the roof of the cab in a red text on white roof fashion. Older State Emergency Service vehicles, primarily in country areas, may have their call sign on the roof as well.\nUnited Kingdom\nPolice vehicles\nPolice vehicles in the United Kingdom have markings of symbols, letters and numbers on their tops to enable aircraft to identify them.  These markings show the use of the vehicle, its force code and a vehicle identifying mark or the police division to which the vehicle belongs.\nNot every vehicle displays markings, but those involved in response and traffic generally do.  This factor stems from guidelines of the Association of Chief Police Officers relating to police air operations and pursuit management.\nVehicle usage markings\n* Armed response vehicle (ARV) used by armed police from various police units – 5 point asterisk *\n* General (incident response vehicle or area car)/Traffic – a circle symbol ●\n* Dog support unit (DSU) – triangle ▲\n* Public order (PO) personnel carrier – square ◼\n*Police medics. Some policing vehicles like ARVs and IRVs may have major first aid and fire equipment installed with trained officers aboard – green cross +\nOn a typical vehicle roof layout, the vehicle usage marking is preceded by an integer PNC Force Identifier; the individual (and within each organisation, unique) Vehicle Identifier, commonly alphanumeric, should occupy a second line all by itself.\nUnique PNC force code\nThe Police National Computer (PNC) is used by UK police forces and other government agencies to store and retrieve data about people, vehicles, plant and government locations. Regarding roof markings, their inscription helps identifying the regional or institutional affiliation of each vehicle. PNC force codes are also used when custody records are created, when items are submitted to places such as the Forensic Science Service laboratory, when evidence is stored, or when documents are to be passed from one force to another. They also form the first two digits of any certificate issued under the Firearms Act since the introduction of the National Firearms Licensing Management System. For example, a licence issued by the Metropolitan Police will start with '02'.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! PNC Code !!

Colour images show the flashing blue lights but other details are lost, and a thermal camera image would show the vehicles and surroundings, but the livery and roofbar lighting could not be seen. The preferred solution was to make the police vehicle distinguishable when viewed with a thermal camera.\nWorking with Qinetiq, they developed a thermally reflective marking film and issued the publication \"Thermal Roof Markings for Police Vehicles 43/04\". These markings reflect infrared light back to the thermal imager, resulting in a contrast between the cold reflection and the ground or vehicle temperature. Being passive in nature, they require no activity on the part of the air observer or vehicle crew, nor any power from the vehicle.\nPublic buses\n]]\nFrom 2006 onwards, single and double-decker buses operating London Buses services began having their roofs painted in heat-reflective white as part of a scheme to cool down their interiors in hot summer weather. This would eventually coincide with the introduction of roof markings, as shown in the image opposite. The first three letters denote the operator (GAG is Go-Ahead Group) and the remaining letters and numbers are the fleet number (SEe200), which also appears on the front and rear of the vehicle.\nFrom 2023, lozenge-shaped stickers denoting the type of fuel the bus runs on (grey for diesel and 'smart' or 'mild hybrids', orange for electric, blue for hydrogen), placed on the roof below the fleet number of the bus, were rolled out onto every London bus by Transport for London contracted bus operators for ease of identification by the emergency services.\nOperator codes include:\n*ARL, Arriva London\n*GAG, Go-Ahead Group\n*MTG, Metroline\n*ABL, Transport UK (formerly known as Abellio)\n*SCG, Stagecoach Group\n*LUB, First Bus London (formerly known as RATP Dev Transit London)\nGermany\nFire vehicles\ncity fire service]]\nIn Germany, DIN 14035, \"Dachkennzeichen für Feuerwehrfahrzeuge\" (Roof Marking of Fire Engines), issued in November 1981, defines that fire engines should carry their registration plate number; these include the one-to-three letter abbreviation code of the corresponding Landkreis, thus making regional origin self-evident. The inscription is recommended to be at least 40&nbsp;cm in size; the font color should, in terms of roof painting, be \"white on red\", or \"black on white and aluminium/metallic\".\nAs DIN standards are, however, not generally binding in Germany, but mere recommendations, the scheme is not used everywhere, with some fire companies preferring visually appealing inscriptions like company name or logo. Many others show their cars' radio call signs (traditionally \"Florian ##\", cf. de:Funkrufname); over the years, various local efforts have been made to match both designations, aided by district administrations that reserved registered car like designations on principle.\nEuropean Union\nAmbulances\nCEN 1789, \"Medical vehicles and their equipment - Road ambulances\", reissued in 2007, recommends in its \"informative\" annex A \"Recognition\", that roofs of ambulance vehicles should bear the Red Cross/Crescent Emblems or the Star of Life.\nCanada\nAerial roof markings are used by Toronto Police Service (# of cruiser) and Toronto EMS (Toronto EMS with region and number) to provide identification from the air. In the Metro Vancouver, British Columbia area, the various police forces have their specific municipal code and vehicle number on the roof for airborne identification.\nReferences\nExternal links"
