Each club played a differing number of fixtures, depending upon the closeness of neighbours, ease of travel etc., with Brighouse Rangers and Barrow playing 17 games each while Broughton Rangers played 35 and several other clubs 32.\nSeason summary\nThe war was starting its third year and the Rugby League decided to continue with the Wartime Emergency League. This arrangement, as in other sports, meant that the sport could continue, which in turn would boost the public’s moral. The fixtures were usually quite local, thus cutting down on travelling time and costs, whilst not wasting precious war resources.\nSeveral clubs did not participate during this season :-\n:The Featherstone Rovers who joined for the previous season 1915–16 left the league and the name did not appear in the (semi) professional ranks until they joined the Northern Rugby Football League for the 1921–22 season.\n:Keighley again did not take part and in fact did not re-enter the league until the first peacetime League in 1919–20.\nSeveral of the clubs who had not participated in the competition in the previous season, now re-joined the League :-\n:Wakefield Trinity\n:Warrington\n:Widnes\nNo new clubs joined the league for this season.\nDewsbury (81.25%) again finished the regular season top of the league, with Leeds (80.65%) again second.\nDewsbury had played one game more, winning this and gaining two points more than Leeds, thus ending the season with a better win percentage.\nDewsbury again took the title.\nThere were no other trophies to play for during this season.\nChampionship\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=20 abbr=\"Position\" |\n!width=175 |Team\n!width=25 abbr=\"Played\" |P\n!width=25 abbr=\"Won\" |W\n!width=25 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D\n!width=25 abbr=\"Lost\" |L\n!width=25 abbr=\"Points for\" |PF\n!width=25 abbr=\"Points against\" |PA\n!width=30 abbr=\"Points difference\" |diff\n!width=25 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts\n!width=30 abbr=”Win Percentage” |%\n!width=40 abbr=\"comments” |Note\n!width=20 abbr=”Reference” |ref\n|-\n|- align=center style=\"background:#FFD700;\"\n|1||Dewsbury||32||26||0||6||542||170||372||52||81.25||||\n|- align=center style=\"background:\"\n|2||Leeds||31||23||4||4||452||107||345||50||80.65||||\n|-\n|3||Leigh||28||20||2||6||317||143||174||42||75||||\n|-\n|4||Barrow||17||12||0||5||225||57||168||24||70.59||||\n|-\n|5||Wigan||32||21||0||11||340||168||172||42||65.63||||\n|-\n|6||Batley||29||16||6||7||309||176||133||38||65.52||||\n|-\n|7||Hull||31||18||1||12||439||319||120||37||59.68||||\n|-\n|8||Swinton||32||17||1||14||252||197||55||35||54.69||||\n|-\n|9||Hull Kingston Rovers||25||12||3||10||180||241||-61||27||54||||\n|-\n|10||Halifax||28||14||2||12||182||226||-44||30||53.57||||\n|-\n|11||Widnes|||21||10||2||9||145||122||23||22||52.38|| 1 ||\n|-\n|12||Warrington||30||14||2||14||258||205||53||30||50|| 1 ||\n|-\n|13||St Helens Recs||30||14||1||15||228||211||17||29||48.33||||\n|-\n|14||Bradford Northern\n||26||12||1||13||190||226||-36||25||48.08||||\n|-\n|15||Bramley\n||24||9||5||10||150||156||-6||23||47.92||||\n|-\n|16||Wakefield Trinity\n||18||7||3||8||119||141||-22||17||47.22|| 1 ||\n|-\n|17||Oldham\n||23||10||1||12||138||221||-83||21||45.65||||\n|-\n|18||Hunslet||30||12||3||15||266||297||-31||27||45||||\n|-\n|19||Broughton Rangers||35||15||1||19||228||266||-38||31||44.29||||\n|-\n|20||Salford\n||30||12||1||17||194||228||-34||25||41.67||||\n|-\n|21||St. Helens||23||8||0||15||138||266||-128||16||34.78||||\n|-\n|22||Runcorn\n||18||5||0||13||56||265||-209||10||27.78||||\n|-\n|23||Huddersfield||26||4||4||18||129||368||-239||12||23.08||||\n|-\n|24||Rochdale Hornets||26||5||1||20||73||283||-210||11||21.15||||\n|-\n|25||Brighouse Rangers\n||17||1||0||16||59||311||-252||2||5.88||||\n|-\n|26||York||18||1||0||17||81||320||-239||2||5.56||||\n|}\nChallenge Cup\nThe Challenge Cup Competition was suspended for the duration of the war.\nThe majority of the trophies, such as the County Leagues and County Cups were also suspended for the duration of the First World War.\nNotes and Comments\n1 - re-joined the League\nSee also\nBritish rugby league system\n1915–16 Northern Rugby Football Union Wartime Emergency League season\n1917–18 Northern Rugby Football Union Wartime Emergency League season\n1918–1919 (January) Northern Rugby Football Union Wartime Emergency League season\n1919 (Feb-May) Northern Rugby Football Union Victory season\nThe Great Schism – Rugby League View\nThe Great Schism – Rugby Union View\nList of defunct rugby league clubs\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://wigan.rlfans.com/fusion_pages/index.php?page_id=319 1896–97 Northern Rugby Football Union season at wigan.rlfans.com]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120302024838/http://www.hullfc.com/FixturesAndResults.aspx?sg=12&gi=3 Hull&Proud Fixtures & Results 1896/1897]\n*[http://www.rugby.widnes.tv/seasonreview.php?mid=1896&smid=1896-97&mids=1896  Widnes Vikings - One team, one passion Season In Review - 1896-97]\n*[http://www.saints.org.uk/saints.org.uk/home/viewpage.php?page_id=9 Saints Heritage Society]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100706041344/http://www.warringtonwolves.org/results-archive?y=1900 Warrington History]\n*[http://wigan.rlfans.com/news.php Wigan Archives - Cherry and white]"
