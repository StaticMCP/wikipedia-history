It was an open primary. The primary marked the end of Missouri's use of the caucus system, which it had used almost exclusively until 2000. Missouri's primary was held on Super Tuesday, alongside fifteen other states.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Candidate\n! Votes\n! Percentage\n! Delegates\n|-\n|George W.
