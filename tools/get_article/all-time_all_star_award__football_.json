In existence from 1980 until 1994 the award was presented to a former player who, more than likely, would have received an All Star had the awards scheme been in existence during their playing days.\nList of winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Year!!Recipients!!County\n|-\n|1980||Larry Stanley||Kildare\n|-\n|1981||Tommy Murphy|| Laois\n|-\n|1982||Paddy Moclair||Mayo\n|-\n|1983||Jim McCullough|| Armagh\n|-\n|-\n|1985||J.J.
