This was the nation's tenth appearance at the Summer Olympics since its debut in 1968. Central African Republic failed to register any athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, and was part of the African and United States-led boycotts in 1976 and 1980, respectively.\nSix athletes, three per gender, were selected to the Central African Republic team across four different sports (athletics, boxing, swimming, and taekwondo) for the Games, matching their roster size at London 2012. Half of the nation's roster made their Olympic debut in Rio de Janeiro, with middle-distance runner Elisabeth Mandaba, swimmer Christian Nassif, and taekwondo fighter David Boui returning for their second appearance. Meanwhile, Chloe Sauvourel, the youngest athlete on the team (aged 17), served as the nation's flag bearer in the opening ceremony.\nCentral African Republic, however, has yet to win its first Olympic medal.\nAthletics\nCentral African Republic received universality slots from IAAF to send two athletes (one male and one female) to the Olympics.\n;Key\n* Note – Ranks given for track events are within the athlete's heat only\n* Q = Qualified for the next round\n* q = Qualified for the next round as a fastest loser or, in field events, by position without achieving the qualifying target\n* NR = National record\n* N/A = Round not applicable for the event\n* Bye = Athlete not required to compete in round\n;Track & road events\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Event\n!colspan=\"2\"|Heat\n!colspan=\"2\"|Semifinal\n!colspan=\"2\"|Final\n|-style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!Result\n!Rank\n!Result\n!Rank\n!Result\n!Rank\n|-align=center\n|align=left|Francky-Edgard Mbotto\n|align=left|Men's 800 m\n|1:52.97\n|7\n|colspan=4|Did not advance\n|-align=center\n|align=left|Elisabeth Mandaba\n|align=left|Women's 800 m\n|2:11.70 NR\n|8\n|colspan=4|Did not advance\n|}\nBoxing\nCentral African Republic received an invitation from the Tripartite Commission to send a female boxer competing in the flyweight division to the Games, signifying the nation's return to the sport after an eight-year hiatus.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Event\n!Round of 16\n!Quarterfinals\n!Semifinals\n!colspan=2|Final\n|- style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!OppositionResult\n!OppositionResult\n!OppositionResult\n!OppositionResult\n!Rank\n|- align=center\n|align=left|Judith Mbougnade\n|align=left|Women's flyweight\n|L\n|colspan=4|Did not advance\n|}\nSwimming\nCentral African Republic received a Universality invitation from FINA to send two swimmers (one male and one female) to the Olympics.\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Event\n!colspan=\"2\"|Heat\n!colspan=\"2\"|Semifinal\n!colspan=\"2\"|Final\n|-style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!Time\n!Rank\n!Time\n!Rank\n!Time\n!Rank\n|-align=center\n|align=left|Christian Nassif\n|align=left|Men's 50 m freestyle\n|30.00\n|84\n|colspan=4|Did not advance\n|-align=center\n|align=left|Chloe Sauvourel\n|align=left|Women's 50 m freestyle\n|37.15\n|85\n|colspan=4|Did not advance\n|}\nTaekwondo\nThe Central African Republic received an invitation from the Tripartite Commission to send London 2012 Olympian David Boui in the men's lightweight category (68&nbsp;kg) into the Olympic taekwondo competition.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Athlete\n!rowspan=2|Event\n!Round of 16\n!Quarterfinals\n!Semifinals\n!Repechage\n!colspan=2|Final /\n|-style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!OppositionResult\n!OppositionResult\n!OppositionResult\n!OppositionResult\n!OppositionResult\n!Rank\n|-align=center\n|align=left|David Boui\n|align=left|Men's −68 kg\n|L 0–6\n|colspan=5|Did not advance\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
