The game is a turn-based strategy set in World War II.\nGameplay\nBattlefront is a corps-level simulation wargame. Upon starting the game, player chooses from one of four scenarios that depict battles of World War II. The scenarios are based on Battle of Crete, Operation Winter Storm, Battle of Saipan, and Siege of Bastogne.\nDevelopment\nThe game was designed and programmed in 14 weeks. Roger Keating created a dedicated disc operating system for the game that allowed rapid access to the data stored on the disc with subsequent reloading of the game screen. Additionally, Keating wrote a novel pathfinding routine that helped to minimize memory usage.\nReception\nJay Selover reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \"Battlefront is a very good game which does an excellent job of putting the player into an authentic combat role: that of a Corps commander.\"\nA reviewer of Computer and Video Games praised the game's historical accuracy and the possibility to create custom scenarios, but criticised the graphics. He stated that Battlefront \"is a very good attempt, but it is not the perfect game that it might have been\".\nThe game was nominated by Computer Gaming World for Strategy Game of the Year in 1987, but lost to Gettysburg: The Turning Point by Chuck Kroegel. Bruce Geryk in his article \"Innovation Wars\", published in 2006 in Computer Gaming World described Battlefront as legendary and said that \"its landmark gameplay revolutionized the genre\".\nReferences"
