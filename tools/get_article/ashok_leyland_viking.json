      "text": "# Ashok Leyland Viking\n\nThe Ashok Leyland Viking is a front engined bus chassis manufactured by Ashok Leyland that is primarily intended for intercity, urban to rural duties and was introduced in 1976. It was based on the English Albion Viking. Since then, Viking has attracted a lot of buyers in private and government sectors in India. It was the first bus with an alternator in India. The Viking chassis also has a larger front overhang that facilitates placing the front door before front axle.\nIn 1997, a naturally aspirated CNG engine option specifically designed for BEST was introduced. The company also launched a two step entry Viking bus chassis in 2003, as an alternative to the three step entry buses of that time. This chassis had a floor height of 860mm.\nCurrently the Viking lineup consists of diesel and CNG engines conforming to BS VI norms. The chassis is also available in 4 wheelbase options. The chassis has an intelligent exhaust gas recirculation ('iEGR) system, which is a modified version of the original exhaust gas recirculation system.\nReferences\nExternal links"
