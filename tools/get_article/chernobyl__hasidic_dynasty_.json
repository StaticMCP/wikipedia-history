The dynasty is named after the northern Ukrainian city of Chernobyl, where Rabbi Nachum was the maggid (). The lineage continues to exist, although not always with the name Chernobyl. Several rebbes are named Chernobyl. The central court is in Bnei Brak, headed by Rabbi Menachem Nachum Twersky.\n\"Chernobyl dynasty\" is also used as a general term for the sects of the descendants of Rabbi Mordechai of Chernobyl; the dynasties of Chernobyl, Skver, Trisk, Rachmastrivka, Hornosteipel, and the past dynasty of Machnovka. It is similar to the Belz, Makarov and Shpikov dynasties and their offshoots.\nFounders\n* Rabbi Menachem Nachum of Chernobyl, founder of the dynasty, was a disciple of the Baal Shem Tov (founder of the Hasidic movement) and the Maggid of Mezritch and author of the books ''Me'or Einayim and Yesamach Lev. His father was Rabbi Zvi Hirsch, son of Rabbi Nachum Gaon of Narinsk. He was a maggid meisharim in the communities of Narynsk, Pogrebishti and Chernobyl, and was poor most of his life. He died on 11 Cheshvan in 1798.\n* Rabbi Mordechai Twersky of Chernobyl, known as the Maggid of Chernobyl, was the son of Rabbi Menachem Nachum and Sarah. He was married to the daughter of Rabbi Aharon the Great of Karlin and then to Feiga, the daughter of Rabbi Dovid Leikas. Unlike his father, he was rich and traveled in a horse-drawn carriage. His teachings were collected in the book, Likutei Torah''. He died on 24 May 1837 and was buried in Ignatowka, near Kyiv, survived by eight sons and three daughters.\n* Rabbi Aaron Twersky of Chernobyl was the son of Rabbi Mordechai and Chaya Sara. Born in 1784, he was named after his grandfather, Rabbi Aharon the Great of Karlin. In his youth his father forced him to serve as rebbe, and he traveled extensively through the surrounding cities. At his father's death, he assumed the leadership of his community and the surrounding area. Active in strengthening settlement of the land of Israel, he died on 21 November 1871 and was survived by six children with his second wife.\nLineage\n*Grand Rabbi Menachem Nochum Twersky of Chernobyl (1730–1797) – author of Meor Einayim, disciple of the Baal Shem Tov\n**Grand Rabbi Mordechai Twersky (1770–1837) – the Chernobyler Maggid, son of the Meor Einayim.
