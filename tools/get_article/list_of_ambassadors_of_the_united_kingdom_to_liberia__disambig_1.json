From 1991 to 2003 the British ambassador to Ivory Coast was non-resident ambassador to Liberia, and from 2003 to 2013 the British high commissioner to Sierra Leone was non-resident ambassador. From 2013 the UK again has a resident ambassador at Monrovia.\nList of heads of mission\nConsuls\n*1847\n*1902&ndash;1905: Capt Charles Francis Cromie, for Republic of Liberia, and for French Western Africa\nEnvoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary\n*1946–1949: John Bowering\n*1949–1951: John Baillie\n*1951–1952: Charles Capper\nAmbassadors extraordinary and plenipotentiary\n*1952–1957: Charles Capper\n*1957–1960: Guy Clarke\n*1960–1963: Harold Brown\n*1963–1967: Malcolm Walker\n*1967–1970: John Curle\n*1970–1973: Martin Moynihan\n*1973–1978: John Reiss\n*1978–1980: John Gordon Doubleday\n*1980–1985: Dougal Reid\n*1985–1987: Alec Ibbott\n*1988–1990: Michael Gore\n*1990–1997: Margaret Rothwell (non-resident)\n*1997–2001: Haydon Warren-Gash (non-resident)\n*2001–2003: Francois Gordon (non-resident)\n*2003&ndash;2006: John Mitchiner (non-resident)\n*2006&ndash;2008: Sarah MacIntosh (non-resident)\n*2009&ndash;2013: Ian Hughes (non-resident)\n*2013–2015: Fergus Cochrane-Dyet\n*2015–2020 David Belgrove\n*2020–2023: Neil Bradley\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.gov.uk/government/world/liberia UK and Liberia] – gov.uk"
