He was educated at Rugby School and at Worcester College, Oxford.

He was re-elected in 1880, and held the seat until his defeat at the 1885 general election.\nHe did not stand in 1886, and at the 1892 general election he unsuccessfully contested the Clitheroe division of Lancashire as a Unionist, though it is unclear whether his candidacy was sponsored by the Liberal Unionist Party or the Conservative Party.\nBriggs married Mary Vicars in 1871.
