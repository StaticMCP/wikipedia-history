In an attempt to resolve the inheritance of Navarre, Louis declined Theobald's request until he reconciled with his sister, Blanche of Brittany. Upon the reconciliation, Louis agreed to Isabella marrying Theobald.  The Archbishop of Rouen celebrated the marriage between Isabella and Theobald II, King of Navarre and Count of Champagne, on 6 April 1255 in Melun. Isabelle became Queen consort of Navarre.\nTogether with her husband and her father, the very pious Isabella travelled with the Eighth Crusade in July 1270. Her father died there in August of the same year. Then, in December, Isabella's husband died of an epidemic while in Sicily. After the deaths of both her father and husband, Isabella returned to France and lived in Provence until her death only two months later in 1271.\nIsabella is buried next to her husband in Provins.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*"
