He enjoyed a great reputation as an engraver of small book-illustrations during the last 20 years of his life. His engraved plates of Robert Smirke in the English editions of the Arabian Nights (1802), Gil Blas (1809), and Don Quixote (1818), were very successful. His Broken Jar (after David Wilkie), one of the illustrations to poet Peter Coxe's Social Day, was considered a masterpiece of its kind.\nOther publications to which he contributed were Kearsley's edition of The Plays of William Shakespeare, Du Roveray's edition of The Poetical Works of Alexander Pope, ''Walker's British Classics'', John Sharpe's Classics, Suttaby's Poets, and Physiognomical Portraits.\nWarren was an active member of the Society of Arts and also of the Artists' Fund Society, of which he was president from 1812 to 1815. In 1823, he was awarded the large gold medal of the Society of Arts for valuable improvements which he made in the preparation of steel plates for engraving, but he did not live to receive his award, dying suddenly in Wandsworth, London on 21 April of that year. He was buried at St. Sepulchre's, Newgate Street.\nThere is a portrait of Warren from a sketch by William Mulready in John Pye's Patronage of British Art.\nAmbrose William Warren (c.&nbsp;1781 – 1856), the brother of Charles Warren, was also a line-engraver of note. Examples of his work can be found in Cattermole's 'Book of the Cartoons' (Houlston and Hughes, 1840), the 'Gem' (1830–31), and 'Ancient Marbles in the British Museum.' His most important single plates are 'The Beggar's Petition' (after W. F. Witherington, 1827), and 'The New Coat' (after David Wilkie, 1832). He died in 1856.\nReferences\nSources\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait.php?sText=Charles+warren&submitSearchTerm_x=8&submitSearchTerm_y=8&search=ss&OConly=true&firstRun=true&LinkID=mp50983&rNo=0&role=sit Portrait sculpture of Charles Warren] (National Portrait Gallery, London)\n* Engraving by Ambrose William Warren of , by Joshua Reynolds for The Easter Gift, 1832, with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon"
