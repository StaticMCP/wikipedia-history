At the turn of 1709-10, the Austrian armies continued their gradual advance in the territory of Nógrád County under the command of Count Johann von Sickingen.\nRákóczi's army, reinforced with Swedish and Polish troops was marching towards Érsekújvár,when they were intercepted by a 1,500-man cavalry unit led by von Sickingen, who underestimated the number of Hungarian troops.\nThe Kurucs, with an 8-to-1 advantage, overwhelmed the Imperials and were close to victory, when their undisciplined units began to plunder and disintegrated. This allowed the Imperial troops to regroup and turn the tide of the battle until both sides retreated.\nConsequences\nThe remaining Hungarian, Polish and Swedish units gathered on the south side of the stream, and the imperial ones gathered near Érsekvadkert. The Swedes and Poles wanted to persuade Rákóczi to launch a new attack, but he, seeing the poor performance of his troops, decided against it. von Sickingen had suffered heavy losses (half of his army) and was also unable to attack with his exhausted troops, so the battle ended.\nBoth sides regarded the battle as their own victory. Today, it can be considered a draw. Despite their initial success, the Kuruc troops, who outnumbered the enemy eight (8!) times, could not defeat the well-trained Imperials due to their lack of discipline.\nAccording to György Ottlyk, head master of Rákóczi: Last Wednesday, we beat Habsburg gloriously, but we ignominiously ran away from the battlefield.\nAlthough the losses of the Imperials were greater in number and proportion, at the end of the battle they still dominated the battlefield. However, Rákóczi's army did not break up, so the Austrians could not make good use of their situation. In fact, the prince also achieved his original goal: he managed to bring supplies to Érsekújvár.\nCommemoration\nThe monument to the battle stands next to the road leading from Romhány to Szátok, on the edge of the village. The 8-meter high obelisk was inaugurated in 1932 and was built by Dezső Magos based on the plans of János Istók. On the top, there is a turul bird, on the side there are reliefs of Rákóczi and Károlyi, as well as Hungarian, Polish and Swedish commemorations.\nAnother monument to the battle stands next to the road leading Romhány to Kétbodony.\nReferences"
