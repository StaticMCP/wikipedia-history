The club grew out of the earlier women's suffrage movement in New York which led to the Nineteenth Amendment. The club built its third and current home at 3 West 51st Street, New York City in 1934.  That Neo-Georgian style building was built on the former site of Andrew Carnegie's home and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.\nThe club continues to serve its members with guest rooms and dining, in addition to political lectures.  It allows men to join as associate members.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
