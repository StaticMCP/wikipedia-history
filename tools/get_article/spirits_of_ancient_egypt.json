Denny Laine sings lead vocals on the track.\nBackground\n\"Spirits of Ancient Egypt\" was written after Paul McCartney read a tome on the history of Egypt.\nFurther releases\nA live version has appeared on the 1976 live album Wings Over America.\nReception\nAuthor Peter Ames Carlin stated that it \"evoked shimmery kinds of mystery, but to no discernible end. The spirits get hung up on the telephone and we’re left with someone making dinner with a pound of love.\" Music critic Eoghan Lang states that \"English's percussion can be heard loudly, filling in the air holes that permeate in 'Spirits of Ancient Egypt', a jaunty tune ably sung by bassist Denny Laine.\". Ultimate Classic Rock critic Nick DeRiso rated it as Laine's 9th best song, stating that McCartney's \"counterpoint vocal\" is \"great\" and particularly praising the live version from Wings Over America.\nPersonnel\nThe personnel is as follows:\n* Paul McCartney – bass, backing vocals, electric guitar, synthesizer, gismo, moog\n* Linda McCartney – organ, synthesizer, backing vocals, string machine\n* Denny Laine – electric guitar, vocals\n* Jimmy McCulloch – guitar, vocals\n* Joe English – backing vocals, drums, gong\n* Alan O'Duffy – backing vocals\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
