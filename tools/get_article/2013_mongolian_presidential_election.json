The Democratic Party nominee, incumbent President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj was re-elected, defeating both Mongolian People's Party nominee of parliament member Badmaanyambuugiin Bat-Erdene and Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party nominee Natsagiin Udval, who was Minister of Health at the time of the election. Elbegdorj was inaugurated on 10 July 2013 for his second term in office.\nBoth Elbegdorj and Bat-Erdene saw backing from the urban population in Ulan Bator, Bat-Erdene having more of a conservative following and the incumbent president supported by the middle class. Elbegdorj won the election with 50.9% of the popular votes, a nearly 9% margin over Bat-Erdene. Udval received 6.6% of the popular vote. Elbegdorj's re-election keeps the Democratic Party in power both in the presidency and the State Great Khural.\nElectoral system\nThe election was held using the two-round system; if no candidate had received a majority of the vote in the first round, a second round would have been held. The second round was to be scheduled on 10 July 2013 if necessary. Only parties with seats in the State Great Khural were allowed to nominate candidates.\nThe elections were the first in which Mongolians living abroad were allowed to vote, with an estimated 39,800 Mongolian citizens living outside Mongolia at the time of the election. Other reforms had been made since the 2012 parliamentary elections, including limits on money spent by candidates on campaigning and advertising. As in the 2012 elections, the presidential election used electronic voting machines from Dominion Voting Systems.\nCampaign laws\nChanges to campaign laws were made in 2011 which restricted the amount of television and poster advertising a candidate could use. It also increased penalties for violators. The intent was to have the candidates judged on the merit of their platform rather than the budget of their campaign. This change increased the role of social networking such as Facebook and Twitter in candidates campaigns.\nCandidates\nThree parties nominated candidates for the presidency.\nTsakhiagiin Elbegdorj\nIncumbent president Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj was renominated by Democratic Party, and was also endorsed by Civil Will-Green Party and Mongolian National Democratic Party, both of which have seats in both the parliament and the government cabinet. Republican Party and Motherland Party expressed their full support for Elbegdorj's candidacy also.\nElbegdorj was Prime Minister of Mongolia for two terms prior to his election as president in 2009. The incumbent president was \"heavily backed by the urban middle class\" of Ulaanbaatar. Elbegdorj was one of the leaders of the democratic revolution in 1990 that saw the fall of the People's Republic of Mongolia.\nBadmaanyambuugiin Bat-Erdene\nThe opposition Mongolian People's Party nominated parliament member Badmaanyambuugiin Bat-Erdene. Bat-Erdene is a former wrestling champion and was the first wrestler to be announced as a presidential candidate in Mongolia. Bat-Erdene had a more conservative backing within Ulan Bator. Mongolian People's Party was the former communist party in power prior to the democratic revolution in 1990.\nNatsagiin Udval\nThe Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party was initially unsure if it was going to field a candidate in the election, or support another party's candidate. It eventually nominated Natsagiin Udval to run. Udval is the Minister of Health and the Secretary-General of Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party. She was also the first woman to run for the presidency. Udval supports former president Nambaryn Enkhbayar who is in prison on corruption charges and who is chairman of Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party.\nResults\nIncumbent President Elbegdorj won the election with 50.23% of total votes, with Baterdene Badmaanyambuu and Natsagiin Udval getting 41.97% and 6.5% respectively.\nFollowing the announcement Mongolian Prime Minister Norovyn Altankhuyag pledged work with President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj to fight corruption in Mongolia. A political analyst said having the parliament and presidency represented by a single party would be good for foreign investment, as it shows a \"politically stable\" environment.\nBy province\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=text-align:center\n!rowspan=\"3\"|Subdivision\n!
