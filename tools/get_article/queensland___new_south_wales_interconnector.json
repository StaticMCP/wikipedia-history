It consisted of double-circuit 330&nbsp;kV lines between Armidale, Dumaresq Substation, Bulli Creek and Braemar and a double-circuit 275&nbsp;kV line between Braemar and Tarong.\nThere is an additional 330&nbsp;kV Dual Circuit to complement the QNI from Bulli Ck Switching Station (27°55'15.8\"S 150°50'34.8\"E) via Millmerran Power Station & Switching Stations (27°57'53.7\"S 151°16'26.9\"E) to Middle Ridge Switching Station & 330/275/110&nbsp;kV Sub, South of Toowoomba (27°37'22.2\"S 151°56'43.0\"E).\nThe Dumaresq Switching Station (29° 12' 12\"S 151° 19' 44\"E) is in a rural area along Bruxner Way on the New South Wales side of the border with Queensland, and is located 21&nbsp;km south-east of Bonshaw.\nThe original maximum transfer capacity was 300 to 350&nbsp;MW in both directions. This has been progressively increased to 700&nbsp;MW from New South Wales to Queensland and 1,200&nbsp;MW from Queensland to New South Wales.\nThe interconnector is operated by TransGrid and Powerlink Queensland.\nReferences"
