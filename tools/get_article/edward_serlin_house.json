The community is now known as the Usonia Historic District and is located in Pleasantville, New York. The community was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.\nThe home has three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and is on a five-foot square module, with a shed roof over the living room. Construction was supervised by former Wright apprentice, David Henken, with additions to the design made by Aaron L. Resnick.\nSee also\n* List of Frank Lloyd Wright works\nReferences\n*  (S.317)\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110904065440/http://www.arcaid.co.uk/search.php?inc=quickSearch&search=10274- Photos on Arcaid]"
