The vote took place at the Chung-Shan Hall in Taipei. Incumbent President Chiang Kai-shek and Vice President Chen Cheng was re-elected.\nBefore the election, the National Assembly amended the Temporary Provisions against the Communist Rebellion which allowed the President and Vice-President to seek a third term, which superseded the Article 47 of the Constitution of the Republic of China, in order to make way for Chiang to be re-elected. As a result, Chiang received 1,481 votes of the 1,576 National Assembly members, while his running mate Chen Cheng was re-elected with 1,381 votes. The term began on May 20, 1960.\nElectors\nThe election was conducted by the National Assembly in its meeting place Chung-Shan Hall in Taipei.
