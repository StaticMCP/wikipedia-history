It serves as a sequel to Grigsby's earlier game Warship, adapted to warfare in the Atlantic Ocean. The game reuses its predecessor's game engine and mechanics, and has been described as a \"clone\" of Warship with an expanded scope.\n| rev2 = Current Notes\n| rev2Score =\n| rev3 = Page 6\n| rev3Score =\n}}\nReviewing Battle Cruiser for Computer Gaming World, Bob Proctor called it \"the exact same game [as Warship] with new Ship and Weapon Tables.\" M. Evan Brooks of Current Notes offered a similar opinion, but felt that Battle Cruiser was \"a better bargain\". In Antic, Rich Moore opined that the game's \"graphics aren't great, but this quickly becomes secondary\".\nIn a 1988 Page 6 survey of wargames for Atari computers, Brooks wrote of Battle Cruiser, \"No new ground is broken, although this is the better bargain given its more extensive coverage.\" In his similar 1989 survey, J. L. Miller wrote in Computer Play that Battle Cruiser was \"historically accurate and recommended for the naval buff.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
