The Decree was amended four times, in 1919, 1920, 1927 and 1939.\nEligibility\nTo qualify for the Commemorative Cross, recipients, civilians or military personnel of any rank, had to be mobilised for war service on any campaign between 1916 and 1918. This was later extended to 1919, thus being included the combatants from the Hungarian–Romanian War as well.\nIt was awarded for a lifetime, but it could have been lost if the recipient would have lost his Romanian citizenship, or would have suffered a penal sentence.\nWhile initially the medal was to be used only by the recipient, in 1939 King Carol II of Romania authorised, for superior ranks only, the inheritance of the medal by the eldest son or older brother of the deceased recipient, who would become an active army officer. The inherited medal would receive a new clasp, inscribed Tradiție (tradition), and would have to be confirmed by royal decree\nDescription\nThe dark iron cross has a diameter of 40&nbsp;mm. Each rhombic arm measures 10&nbsp;mm on the exterior and 7&nbsp;mm on the interior. In the center of the cross, there is a 13&nbsp;mm circle. The external borders of the cross and the circle have 1.3&nbsp;mm. Inside the circle, on the obverse, there is the royal cypher of King Ferdinand I of Romania (two Fs facing away with a royal crown on top), while on the reverse there is inscribed 1916|1918 on the early models and 1916|1919 on later models, in two rows.\nThe 30&nbsp;mm ribbon alternates four equal bars of dark blue with three equal bars of green.\nClasps\nSeventeen clasps were approved for the medal: eleven in the original Decree from 1918, three in 1919, one in 1920, one in 1927 and one in 1939. These clasps consist of small metal bars into which the name of the relevant campaign or theatre of operations was moulded (except for the last one). The clasps were then attached transversally to the medal's suspension bar.\n# Ardeal\n# Cerna\n# Jiul - actually Jiu on existing clasps\n# Carpați\n# Oituz\n# București\n# Turtucaia\n# Dobrogea\n# Mărăști\n# Mărășești\n# Târgu-Ocna\n# Dunărea\n# 1918\n# 1919\n# Siberia\n# Italia\n# Tradiție\nUsage and hierarchy\nThe medal was displayed on official occasions and ceremonies on the left breast of the jacket. On other occasions, it was customary to display only the ribbon bar, pinned on the left buttonhole. In the hierarchy of the Romanian military and civil awards and decorations from the mid 1930s, the Commemorative Cross held the very low 32nd place. The customary hierarchy of the military decorations was (not including those from the Independence War):\n# Order of Michael the Brave\n# The Military Virtue\n# The Aeronautical Virtue\n# The Cross of Queen Marie\n# The Sanitary Merit Cross\n# Valour and Faith with swords\n# The Country's Momentum\n# The Commemorative Cross 1916-1918\n# Victory Medal\nSee also\n*Victory Medal (Romania)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://decoratiiromanesti.blogspot.ro/2007/07/crucea-comemorativ-rzboiului-1916-1919.html Romanian Commemorative Cross of the 1916–1918 War] at \"Romanian Medals & Orders\"."
