The ceremony streamed live on Netflix's YouTube channel, starting at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. EST / 5:00&nbsp;p.m. PST. The nominees were announced on January 11, 2023, by Ashley Park and Haley Lu Richardson via Instagram Live.\nIn May 2022, it was confirmed that the ceremony would no longer air on TNT and TBS (the ceremony had aired on TNT since 1998 and had been also broadcast on TBS since 2006); a spokesperson insisted that finding a new home for the ceremony \"is not unusual and has occurred several times over the history of the SAG Awards. This is no different\". The day of the nominations announcement, it was confirmed that the ceremony would stream live on Netflix's YouTube channel.\nThe Banshees of Inisherin and Everything Everywhere All at Once both received five nominations, tying the record for the most nominations in SAG Awards history with Shakespeare in Love (1998), Chicago (2002), and Doubt (2008). Everything Everywhere All at Once ultimately won the most awards of the ceremony with four wins, the most for any film in SAG Awards history, with Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan both becoming the first Asian actors to win for individual categories: Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role and Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role, respectively.\nSally Field was announced as the 2022 SAG Life Achievement Award recipient on January 17, 2023.\nWinners and nominees\n* Note: Winners are listed first and highlighted in boldface.\n, Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role winner]]\n, Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role winner]]\n, Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role winner]]\n, Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role winner]]\n, Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Television Movie or Limited Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Limited Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series winner]]\nFilm\n{| class=wikitable style=font-size:100%\n|+\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Brendan Fraser – The Whale as Charlie'\n** Austin Butler – Elvis as Elvis Presley\n** Colin Farrell – The Banshees of Inisherin as Pádraic Súilleabháin\n** Bill Nighy – Living as Mr. Williams\n** Adam Sandler – Hustle as Stanley Sugerman\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Michelle Yeoh – Everything Everywhere All at Once as Evelyn Quan Wang'\n** Cate Blanchett – Tár as Lydia Tár\n** Viola Davis – The Woman King as General Nanisca\n** Ana de Armas – Blonde as Norma Jeane Mortensen / Marilyn Monroe\n** Danielle Deadwyler – Till as Mamie Till-Mobley\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Ke Huy Quan – Everything Everywhere All at Once as Waymond Wang'\n** Paul Dano – The Fabelmans as Burt Fabelman\n** Brendan Gleeson – The Banshees of Inisherin as Colm Doherty\n** Barry Keoghan – The Banshees of Inisherin as Dominic Kearney\n** Eddie Redmayne – The Good Nurse as Charlie Cullen\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Jamie Lee Curtis – Everything Everywhere All at Once as Deirdre Beaubeirdre'\n** Angela Bassett – Black Panther: Wakanda Forever as Queen Ramonda\n** Hong Chau – The Whale as Liz\n** Kerry Condon – The Banshees of Inisherin as Siobhán Súilleabháin\n** Stephanie Hsu – Everything Everywhere All at Once as Joy Wang / Jobu Tupaki\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" colspan=\"2\" |\n* 'Everything Everywhere All at Once – Jamie Lee Curtis, James Hong, Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, Harry Shum Jr., Jenny Slate, and Michelle Yeoh'\n** Babylon – Jovan Adepo, P.
