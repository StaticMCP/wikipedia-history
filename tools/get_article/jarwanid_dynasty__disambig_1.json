It is disputed whether they belonged to the Banu Uqayl—the tribe of their predecessors the Usfurids and their successors the Jabrids—or to the Banu Abdul Qays, to whom the Uyunid dynasty (1076-1235) belonged.Abdulkhaliq Al-Janbi, an online article on the history of eastern Arabia (Arabic)[http://www.rasid.com/print.php?id=6965 عبدالخالق الجنبي، جروان الأحساء غير جروان القطيف]   The Jarwanids came to power some time in the 14th century, after expelling the forces of Sa'eed ibn Mughamis, the chief of the Muntafiq tribe based in the Iraqi city of Basrah.\nContemporary sources such Ibn Battuta and Ibn Hajar describe the Jarwanids as being \"extreme Rawafidh,\" a term for Shi'ites who rejected the first three Caliphs, while a 15th-century Sunni scholar from Egypt describes them as being \"remnants of the Qarmatians.\"  Historian Juan Cole concludes from this that they were Isma'ilis.  However, the Twelver Shi'ite sect was promoted under their rule, and Twelver scholars held the judgeships and other important positions, including the chief of the hisba.  Also, unlike under the Qarmatians, Islamic prayers were held in the mosques under Jarwanid rule, and prayer was called under the Shi'ite formula.  A Twelver scholar of the 14th century, Jamaluddeen Al-Mutawwa', belonged to the house of Jarwan.'Ali b.
