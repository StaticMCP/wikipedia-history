It is an iconic landform of Monument Valley and can be seen from Highway 163. Precipitation runoff from this landform's slopes drains into the San Juan River drainage basin. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises  above the surrounding terrain in 0.2&nbsp;mile (0.32&nbsp;km). This landform's toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names. It is so named because the butte resembles a king sitting on a throne looking south to the valley. The first ascent of the summit was made in 1967 by Fred Beckey, Marlene Dalluge, Joe Brown, and Don Liska.\nGeology\nKing-on-his-Throne is composed of two principal strata. The bottom layer is slope-forming Organ Rock Shale and the upper stratum is cliff-forming De Chelly Sandstone. The rock was deposited during the Permian period. The buttes and mesas of Monument Valley are the result of the Organ Rock Shale being more easily eroded than the overlaying sandstone.\nClimate\nSpring and fall are the most favorable seasons to visit King-on-his-Throne. According to the Köppen climate classification system, it is located in a semi-arid climate zone with cold winters and hot summers. Summers average 54 days above  annually, and highs rarely exceed .
