To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Golden Raspberry Awards, four special categories—Worst Razzie Loser of Our First 25 Years, Worst \"Comedy\" of Our First 25 Years, Worst \"Drama\" of Our First 25 Years, and Worst \"Musical\" of Our First 25 Years—were created.\nLeading the pack was a tie between the late summer film Catwoman and Fahrenheit 9/11, each of which won four Razzies, even though the latter was not nominated for Worst Picture. Catwoman received the greatest number of nominations (seven), followed by Alexander with six nominations.\nThe Ivar Theatre was rented using proceeds from an auction of Ben Affleck's broken trophy from the previous year, which Affleck smashed during an appearance on Larry King Live.\nHalle Berry collected her award in person. She was the first to do so since 2001, when Tom Green arrived to receive his five Razzies for Freddy Got Fingered. Berry was quoted as saying \"If you aren't able to be a good loser you're not able to be a good winner.\" Berry mocked her 2002 Oscar acceptance speech, acting tearful and saying, \"I never thought this would happen to me.\" She then responded to some critics by holding up her Oscar and saying, \"They can't take it away, my name's on it!\" Screenwriter Michael Ferris also appeared to pick his Worst Screenplay award.\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\" align=\"centre\"\n|-\n!

It received nominations not because the movie itself was of poor quality, but because the film depicted political figures' mishandling of the September 11 attacks and the Iraq War. The Razzies, which had previously steered clear of politics, received criticism from some quarters for nominating the stock footage \"performances\" of George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, and Condoleezza Rice. (The former two won their awards while Britney Spears won the Razzie for Worst Supporting Actress over Rice; her role in Fahrenheit 9/11 is just fifteen seconds long.\nFilms with multiple nominations\nThese films received multiple nominations:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Nominations\n!Films\n|-\n|7\n|Catwoman\n|-\n|6\n|Alexander\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |5\n|Fahrenheit 9/11\n|-\n|White Chicks\n|-\n|4\n|Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |3\n|Jersey Girl\n|-\n|Surviving Christmas\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |2\n|Around the World in 80 Days\n|-\n|Exorcist: The Beginning\n|-\n|New York Minute\n|-\n|Starsky & Hutch\n|}\nSee also\n* 2004 in film\n* 77th Academy Awards\n* 58th British Academy Film Awards\n* 62nd Golden Globe Awards\n* 11th Screen Actors Guild Awards\nReferences"
