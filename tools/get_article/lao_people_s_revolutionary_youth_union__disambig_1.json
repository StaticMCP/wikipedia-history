It is the youth wing of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, the ruling party of Laos.\nOriginating in 1955 as the Youth Combatant Association and now comprising some 243,500 registered members (aged 15–35), the Lao People's Revolutionary Youth Union has a particular focus on the fields of information, media, entertainment, art and music. The LPRYU operates at central, provincial, municipal, district and village levels and co-operates with foreign countries and international organisations in a wide range of programme activities.
