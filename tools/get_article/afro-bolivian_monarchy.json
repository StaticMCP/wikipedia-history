It was established in 1823 with the coronation of King Uchicho and is centered in Mururata, a village in the Yungas region of Bolivia. The monarchy is treated as a customary leader of the Afro-Bolivian community. The powers of the Afro-Bolivian king are similar to those of a traditional king, representing the Afro-Bolivian community. The current Afro-Bolivian monarchs are King Julio Pinedo and Queen Angélica Larrea.\nHistory\nThe components of this royal house are the descendants of an old African tribal monarchy that were brought to Bolivia as slaves. The founding monarch, Uchicho, was allegedly of Kongo and Senegalese origin, and was brought to the hacienda of the Marquis de Pinedo, in the area of Los Yungas in what is now La Paz Department. Other slaves allegedly recognized him as a man of regal background (a prince from the ancient Kingdom of Kongo) when seeing his torso exposed with royal tribal marks only held by royalty. He was crowned in 1823, and was succeeded by Bonifaz, who adopted the surname of Pinedo, the plantation owner. Bonifaz was succeeded by Don José and Don Bonifacio, the latter of whom was born in 1880 and crowned in 1932. When Bonifacio died in 1954, the house was led by his oldest daughter Doña Aurora Pinedo. Because of the lack of a male heir, the kingdom was left without a king for 38 years. Aurora's oldest son, Julio Pinedo, was given the title of king in 1992. His wife, Angélica Larrea, became queen upon her husband's ascension.\nThe Royal House was officially recognized by the Bolivian state in 2007 with the public coronation of Julio, the current King of the Afro-Bolivian community, which was done by the authorities of the La Paz Department. They are a ceremonial monarchy, similar to a traditional tribal chiefdom, and have no police force nor do they collect taxes from citizens.\nKing Julio has a son, Prince Rolando, who was born in 1994. By 2021 he was studying law at the Universidad de Los Andes in La Paz and preparing for his prospective role as king, stating that his ambitions were to \"keep pushing forward to make the Afro-Bolivian community more recognised and visible, the way my father has done until now\".\nList of monarchs\n* Uchicho\n* Bonifaz Pinedo\n* José Pinedo\n* Bonifacio Pinedo\n* Aurora Pinedo (as princess regent)\n* Julio Pinedo\nThe heir apparent is the present king's nephew and adopted son, Crown Prince Rolando Julio Pinedo Larrea.\nOrder of Merit\nKing Julio I established a dynastic order and order of merit, named in honor of the first Afro-Bolivian king, on 5 January 2012.
