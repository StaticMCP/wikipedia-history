      "text": "# Houston: We Have a Drinking Problem__disambig_1\n\nHouston: We Have a Drinking Problem is the second studio album by Bad Astronaut, released in 2002 on the Honest Don's independent record label.  The title is a reference to the quote \"Houston, we have a problem,\" which is somewhat inaccurately attributed to astronaut Jim Lovell aboard the Apollo 13 spacecraft when an explosion in the Service Module endangered the crew.  The track \"Our Greatest Year\" features a harmonica solo by John Popper of Blues Traveler fame.\nThe album features two covers. \"Break Your Frame\" is originally performed by Armchair Martian, and \"Solar Sister\" is originally performed by The Posies.\nTrack listing\n#\"These Days\" - 4:17\n#\"Clear Cutting\" - 1:40\n#\"Single\" - 3:01\n#\"Break Your Frame\" (Jon Snodgrass) - 3:20\n#\"Disarm\" - 4:26\n#\"Not a Dull Moment\" - 2:36\n#\"You Deserve This\" - 3:05\n#\"If I Had a Son\" - 3:52\n#\"Solar Sister\" (Jon Auer & Ken Stringfellow) - 3:18\n#\"Off the Wagon\" - 3:09\n#\"Another Dead Romance\" - 3:29\n#\"Killers and Liars\" - 3:04\n#\"Our Greatest Year\" - 3:44\n#\"The Passenger\" - 4:03\n(original performers / writers shown in parentheses)\nReferences\n*"
