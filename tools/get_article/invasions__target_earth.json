This includes what types of aliens to use, from robots to demons, as well as setting up the invaders' command structure and firepower, and a complete timeline of the invasion.\nThe book also includes a 13-part scenario titled \"The Invasion\".\nPublication history\nIn 1981, Hero Games published the superhero role-playing game (RPG) Champions but ran into financial difficulty in the mid-1980s, and was eventually taken over as a subsidiary of I.C.E. In 1989, Hero Games/I.C.E. published a fourth edition of Champions, and many adventures and supplements followed, including 1990's Invasion, a 48-page softcover book written by Cyrus Harris, with interior art by Colleen Doran, and cover art by Jackson Guice.\nReception\nIn the January 1991 edition of Dragon (#165), Allen Varney warned that \"The scenario outlines here need fleshing out, but Invasions takes you a long way toward turning your campaign world upside down and righting it again.\" He concluded with a recommendation to buy this product, saying, \"Start filling your game's skies with enemy ships.\"\nReferences"
