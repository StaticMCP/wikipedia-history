      "text": "# The Road Back Home (The Flower Kings album)\n\n}}\nThe Road Back Home is the second compilation album by the Swedish progressive rock band The Flower Kings.\nIt is a double album with some of the group's shorter and more straightforward songs, rather than their usual long/complex epic songs. All of the songs have been remastered and most have been remixed. Some have even been reworked, with new guitar solos, or new lead vocals, or different backing vocals, etc.\nRoine Stolt personally made all the remakes, between December 2006 and January 2007, and gives comments for each track in the album's booklet. The album includes a previously unreleased track from The Rainmaker sessions and a cover version of Genesis' famous song \"The Cinema Show\".\nTrack listing\nAll songs by Roine Stolt except where noted.\nDisc One\nDisc Two\nPersonnel\nThe Flower Kings\n* Roine Stolt: lead and backing vocals, guitars, keyboards, percussion (all); bass guitar (Space Revolver, \"Paradox Hotel\")\n* Tomas Bodin: keyboards (all); backing vocal (\"Touch My Heaven\")\n* Hasse Fröberg: lead and backing vocals, guitars (all, except \"My Cosmic Lover\", \"The Road Back Home\", \"Rhythm of the Sea\")\n* Michael Stolt: bass guitar (1995–1999); vocal (\"My Cosmic Lover\")\n* Jaime Salazar: drums, percussion (1995–2001)\n* Jonas Reingold: bass guitar, vocals (2000–2006)\n* Zoltan Csörsz: drums (2002–2004)\n* Daniel Gildenlöw: vocals (2002)\n* Marcus Liliequist: drums, vocals (2006)\nGuests\n* Ulf Wallander: soprano and tenor saxophones (1995–1997, 2000–2002)\n* Hasse Bruniusson: percussion, voices (1996–2004)\n* Håkan Almkvist: sitar, tabla (1997)\nReferences"
