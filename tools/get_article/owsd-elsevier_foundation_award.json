The award program is open to female scientists who live and work in one of 81 developing countries. Nominations are generally submitted within ten years of the nominee earning a PhD.\nThe maximum number of recipients is currently restricted to five per year: one from each of the four OWSD-recognized regions, plus one additional outstanding candidate, and the awards are granted with a rotating theme annually among three general fields: biological sciences (agriculture, biology and medicine), engineering/innovation & technology, and physical sciences (including chemistry, mathematics and physics). There were six awardees in 2022 as two outstanding candidates were recognised.\nAs of 2014, the award included an honorarium of 5,000, an entire year of access to Elsevier's ScienceDirect publication database, and an expense-paid trip to the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, where the awarding ceremony is held.\nRecipients\nRecipients have included:\n2011\nThe 2011 awards recognized eleven contributors to biology, physics, and chemistry.\n* Mahfuza Begum, biologist, Bangladesh\n* Rukmani Mohanta, physicist, India\n* Farzana Shaheen, chemist, Pakistan\n* Janet Ayobami Adermola, physicist, Nigeria\n* Aderoju Amoke Osowole, chemist, Nigeria\n* Denise Evans, biologist, South Africa\n* Nahla Ismail, chemist, Egypt\n* Lubna Tahtamoouni, biologist, Jordan\n* María Magdalena González Sánchez, astrophysicist, Mexico\n* Lisset Hermida Cruz, biologist, Cuba\n* Silvina Pellegrinet, chemist, Argentina\n2013\nThe 2013 awards were focused on medical science and public health.\n*Adediwura Fred-Jaiyesimi, pharmacologist, Nigeria\n*Nasima Akhter, medical scientist, Bangladesh\n*Dionicia Gamboa, molecular biologist, Peru\n*Namjil Erdenechimeg, biochemist, Mongolia\n*Huda Omer Basaleem, community health researcher, Yemen\n2014\nThe 2014 awards were focused on chemistry.\n*Nilufar Mamadalieva, bioorganic chemist, Uzbekistan\n*Leni Ritmaleni, pharmaceutical chemist, Indonesia\n*Simone Ann Marie Badal McCreath, biochemistry researcher, Jamaica\n*Eqbal Mohammed Abdu Dauqan, biotechnologist, Yemen\n*Taiwo Olayemi Elufioye, pharmacologist, Nigeria\n2015\nIn 2015, the awards were focused on physics and mathematics.\n*Nashwa Eassa,  nano-particle physicist, Sudan\n*Dang Thi Oanh, computational mathematician, Thailand\n*Mojisola Oluwyemisi Adeniyi, atmospheric physicist, Nigeria\n*Mojisola Usikalu, radiation physicist, Nigeria\n*Rabia Salihu Sa'id, environmental physicist, Nigeria\n2016\nThe 2016 awards focused on medical science and public health.\n*Sri Fatmawati, pharmacologist, Indonesia\n*Sushila Maharjan, biochemistry researcher, Nepal\n*Magaly Blas, public health specialist, Peru\n*Etheldreda Nakimuli-Mpungu, psychiatric epidemiologist, Uganda\n*Ghanya Naji Mohammed Al-Naqeb, nutritional researcher, Yemen\n2017\nThe 2017 awards were focused on engineering and technology.\n*Tanzima Hashem, computer scientist, Bangladesh\n*María Fernanda Rivera Velásquez, environmentalist, Ecuador\n*Felycia Edi Soetaredjo, environmental energy specialist, Indonesia\n*Grace Ofori-Sarpong, environmental resource management, Ghana\n*Rania Mokhtar, scientific project coordinator, Sudan\n2018\nThe 2018 awards focused on mathematics, chemistry, and physics.\n*Hasibun Naher, applied mathematician, Bangladesh\n*Germaine Djuidje Kenmoe, physicist, Cameroon\n*Silvia González Pérez, computational chemist, Ecuador\n*Dawn Iona Fox, environmental chemist, Guyana\n*Witri Wahyu Lestari, organometallic chemist, Indonesia\n2019\nThe 2019 awards focused on medical science and public health.\n* Narel Y.
