The Farrells divorced in 1929 and eventually their daughter Ammie took over management of the farm and became an award-winning livestock breeder before her death in 1972.  The farm was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. In 1986 the farm opened as a living museum utilizing the remaining 4.5 acres surrounding the home. The museum is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Collin County, Texas\n*Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks in Collin County\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.heritagefarmstead.org/ Heritage Farmstead Museum]"
