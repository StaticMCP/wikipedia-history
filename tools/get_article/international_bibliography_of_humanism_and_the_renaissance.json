Its geographical scope extends outside Europe by including publications on European interactions with the wider world. Chronologically, it extends beyond the Renaissance through the inclusion of modern hermeneutics and reception studies.\nThe database currently comprises over 355,000 records on every aspect of the Renaissance humanist period. Annually, about 20.000 records are added. Publications in English, French, German, Greek, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Hungarian, Romanian, Dutch, Polish, Russian, Swedish and Japanese are eligible for inclusion.\nBetween 1965 and 2013, the Bibliographie internationale de l’Humanisme et de la Renaissance was coordinated and published by Librairie Droz in Geneva, Switzerland. Brepols Publishers of Turnhout, Belgium, acquired the rights to the bibliography in 2013 and has since developed it into an online database.\nReferences"
