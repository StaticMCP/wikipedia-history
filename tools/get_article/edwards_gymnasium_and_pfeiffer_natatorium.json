Inaugurated in 1906, it was designed by architect J.W. Yost and was built by Feick & Son. Edwards Hall is a 1,800-seat multi-purpose arena. Located at the south end of the campus in Delaware, Ohio, it was home to the OWU Battling Bishops men's and women's swimming and women's handball teams.\nOverview\nIt has a stone entry portico and a \"dominant\" red tile roof with dormers. The gymnasium is named for alumnus John Edwards of Leipsic, Ohio, who served on the board of trustees of the university and was a major benefactor to the university.\nIn 1985, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places along with the natatorium named for benefactor Annie Merner Pfeiffer.\nThe Pfeiffer Natatorium was the competition pool for OWU from 1954 to 2010.\nBasketball and volleyball competition, and other indoor sports, were moved to the 2,300 seat Branch Rickey Arena, built adjacent to Edwards Gymnasium, upon its completion in 1976.\nThe Edwards Gymnasium was then renovated to accommodate the Pfeiffer Natatorium, named for donor Annie Merner Pfeiffer.\nIt is  in plan. Built mainly of light-colored brick, it has a hipped red clay-tiled roof with dormers at both ends and sides.\nThe entrance has carved stone pillars.\nThe complex was listed on the National Register as part of a 1984 study of historic resources on the OWU campus.\nAll the OWU sites listed together on the National Register in 1985 are:\n* Austin Hall, W.
