It peaked at No. 48 on the UK singles chart and at No. 47 in Australia. It was also a hit on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart where it reached No. 27.\nCritical reception\nSpin said the song was, \"pop in every sense of the word\" but the meaning was, \"too precious and couched in metaphor and the whole mix was too crowded with different sounds and instruments to be considered strictly pop. It was more than the average listener could decipher while watching MTV or tuning his car radio.\"\nTrack listing\nUK 7\" single / 7\" silver vinyl\n# \"Working with Fire and Steel\"\n# \"Dockland\"\n# \"Forever I and I\"\nUK 12\" single\n# \"Working with Fire and Steel\n# \"Fire and Steel\" (Mix)\n# \"Dockland\"\n# \"Forever I and I\"\nUS 12\" single (Warner Bros.)\n# \"Working with Fire and Steel\"\n# \"Fire and Steel\" (Mix)\n# \"Dockland\"\n# \"Forever I and I\"\nCanada 7\" single (Virgin)\n# \"Working with Fire and Steel\"\n# \"Dockland\"\nEurope 7\" single\n# \"Working with Fire and Steel\"\n# \"Forever I and I\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
