      "text": "# Kingsley, Staffordshire\n\nKingsley is a small village in the Staffordshire Moorlands near to Cheadle, and situated on the A52 from Stoke on Trent to Ashbourne. The civil parish population taken at the 2011 census was 2,204.\nNowadays Kingsley is a quiet rural village, but until the early 20th century it was the centre of the Churnet Valley iron mining industry. Partly as a result the village then had many pubs but none exist today. The Bull's Head closed in 2019 and re-opened in October 2022 as a shop; The Old Swan Pub has been converted into a large family house; and The Plough has been demolished and houses have been built where the pub and its car park once were. There are no longer any other shops within the village when there once were butchers shops, grocery shops, a haberdashers etc.\nThe village is close to Alton Towers.\nThe one school is called St Werburghs Primary School, named after the local Church of England parish church.\nSee also\n*Listed buildings in Kingsley, Staffordshire\nReferences\njust east of Kingsley]]\nExternal links"
