They went on to develop a reputation for wild shows and the ability to play anywhere— from suburban trains for Rockin' the Rails gigs, a boat for Rockin' the Docks, a float at the Moomba Parade to the 20th floor of a building site and on a picket line. The original lineup last played more than 20 years ago, but felt that they never had proper closure on their career.\nAward nominees and winners\nWinners indicated below in boldface\n{| class=wikitable style=\"width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#64C2ED; width=;\"50%\"| Best Album\n! style=\"background:#64C2ED; width=;\"50%\"| Best Song\n|-\n|\n*\n**Paul Dempsey\n**The Temper Trap\n**Wagons\n|\n*\n|-\n! style=\"background:#64C2ED; width=;\"50%\"| Best Male\n! style=\"background:#64C2ED; width=;\"50%\"| Best Female\n|-\n|\n**Paul Dempsey\n**Tex Perkins\n**Phrase\n|\n**Claire Bowditch\n**Sarah Blasko\n**Sia\n**Pikelet\n|-\n! style=\"background:#64C2ED; width=;\"50%\"| Best Band\n! style=\"background:#64C2ED; width=;\"50%\"| Best New Talent\n|-\n|\n**The Temper Trap\n**Wagons\n|\n*Diafrix\n|-\n! style=\"background:#64C2ED; width=;\"50%\"| Best Tour\n! style=\"background:#64C2ED; width=;\"50%\"|\n|-\n|\n**Neil Young\n**Leonard Cohen\n**Flaming Lips\n|\n|}\nReferences"
