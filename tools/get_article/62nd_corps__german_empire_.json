It was formed in January 1917 and dissolved in October 1918.\nChronicle\nThe 62nd Corps (z.b.V.) was formed in January 1917.\nWith the onset of trench warfare, the German Army recognised that it was no longer possible to maintain the traditional Corps unit, that is, one made up of two divisions.  Whereas at some times (and in some places) a Corps of two divisions was sufficient, at other times 5 or 6 divisions were necessary.  Therefore, under the Hindenburg regime (from summer 1916), new Corps headquarters were created without organic divisions.  These new Corps were designated\nGeneral Commands for Special Use ().\nThe 62nd Corps was dissolved in October 1918.\nCommanders\nThe 62nd Corps had the following commanders during its existence:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
