      "text": "# Mountain Empire District\n\nThe Mountain Empire District is a high school conference of the Virginia High School League which draws its members from Southwest Virginia, west of the Roanoke metropolitan area.\nThe schools in the Mountain Empire District compete in Region D with the schools of the Pioneer District. Mount Rogers is one of the two remaining consolidated K-12 schools in Virginia, due to its position at the extreme western end of Grayson County making it inadvisable to consolidate it into Grayson County High School. Its enrollment is typically around 25-30 students in grades 9-12, and so its participation in VHSL team activities will be sporadic. Pocahontas High School used to be in the Mountain Empire District but the school closed at the end of the 2007-2008 academic year. Graham High School (Bluefield, Virginia), left the district after 6 years in 2017.\nMount Rogers is now part of Grayson County High School.  The MED re-formed this year to include Rural Retreat, George Wythe and Auburn which was a former member prior to joining the Three Rivers District.  Graham returned to the Southwest District where they were a long time member and Narrows joined the Pioneer District.\nMember schools\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
