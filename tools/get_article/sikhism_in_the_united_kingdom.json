Decades before the last Sikh King, Duleep Singh, stepped onto British soil in the middle of the 19th century, there had been Anglo-Sikh contact as far back as the 1800s in the Punjab with his father Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Since then, even though this relationship has changed in nature many times, both communities have left a strong permanent influence on each other. For instance, in such varied parts of British society as food, language, political systems, soldiering and of course cricket, the British-Sikh relationship has given rise to many new facets of modern British and Indian society.\nMigration of Sikhs to Britain\nThe first permanent Sikh in Britain was Maharaja Duleep Singh (1838-1893), the last Sikh Emperor of the Imperial Sukerchakia Dynasty, from 1844 to 1849. He arrived in England in the year 1854, having been exiled from his kingdom by the East India Company. His mother, Empress Jind Kaur (1817-1863), arrived in 1860 at Kensington in Victorian London and settled permanently, after being at war with Britain for an extended period of time until the fall of the Sikh Dynasty in 1849. She was given permission by Parliament to settle on English soil.\nThe First Sikh Settlers started migrating from the Punjab in 1911, when the first Sikh Gurdwara was opened in London. During the start of the First and Second World Wars respectively, there was already an established Sikh presence in many parts of England. Britain's first south Asian immigrants after the war were Pakistani Muslims and Punjabi Sikhs from the Jullundur Doab. They tended to settle in midland towns such as Birmingham and Leeds, as well as in the London borough of Southall.\nPresent\nIn 2019, Seema Malhotra MP set up the first debate in Parliament to discuss the positive contribution of the Sikh community over the last 70 years.\nDespite the existence of advocacy organisations like the British Sikh Report, there is very little systematic research on British Sikhs. The only major academic work that is comprehensive, systematic and a through history of the community is by Gurharpal Singh and Darshan S. Tatla, Sikhs in Britain: The Making of a Community (Zed, 2006). This work needs updating in light of the impending Census 2021 to reflect changes in the community's profile.\nDemography\nAccording to the 2021 United Kingdom census, Sikhs in England & Wales enumerated 524,140, or 0.9% of the population.\nPlace of birth\nAccording to the 2017 British Sikh Report which surveys the community in the UK, 71% were born in England, followed by 15% in India, 8% in East Africa, 2% in Scotland, and 1% in Afghanistan.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible sortable\"\n|+ Birthplace of Sikhs in England and Wales (2001−2021)\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Place of birth\n! colspan=\"2\" |2021\n! colspan=\"2\" |2011\n! colspan=\"2\" |2001\n|-\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n| UK\n| 300,075\n|\n|   239,360\n|\n|   184,612\n|\n|-\n| Non-UK\n| 224,065\n|\n|    183,798\n|\n|   144,744\n|\n|-\n!

The first Sikh MP, Piara Singh Khabra was elected in 1992 from Ealing Southall and the first Sikh peer was Tarsem King of West Bromwich, appointed in 1999. Currently, there are seven Sikh peers and eleven Sikh MPs; Sikhs make up  of the House of Lords and  of the House of Commons, while making up  of the British population.\nThe seven incumbent Sikh peers include four Conservatives (Baron Rana of Malone in Antrim, Baroness Verma of Leicester, Baron Suri of Ealing, and Baron Ranger of Mayfair), two crossbenchers (Baron Singh of Wimbledon and Baron Ranger of Northwood)) and  one Labour member (Baron Sahota of Telford).\nA 2023 poll indicated that 43% of British Sikhs would vote for Labour, 20% Conservative and 4% each for the Liberal Democrats and Greens in the next general election.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible sortable\"\n|+ Sikh MPs (2024 United Kingdom general election)\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Party\n!  |MP\n! |Constituency\n!  |Region\n!  |Sikh pop. share (%)\n!  |First elected\n! |Notes\n|-\n|style=\"width:1px; background:; \" |\n|Labour\n|Jas Athwal\n|Ilford South\n|London\n|\n|2024\n|\n|-\n|style=\"width:1px; background:; \" |\n|Labour\n|Tan Dhesi\n|Slough\n|South East\n|\n|2017\n|\n|-\n|style=\"width:1px; background:; \" |\n|Labour\n|Kirith Entwistle\n|Bolton North East\n|North West\n|\n|2024\n|\n|-\n|style=\"width:1px; background:; \" |\n|Labour\n|Preet Gill\n|Birmingham Edgbaston\n|West Midlands\n|\n|2017\n|\n|-\n|style=\"width:1px; background:; \" |\n|Labour\n|Gurinder Josan\n|Smethwick\n|West Midlands\n|\n|2024\n|\n|-\n|style=\"width:1px; background:; \" |\n|Labour\n|Warinder Juss\n|Wolverhampton West\n|West Midlands\n|\n|2024\n|\n|-\n|style=\"width:1px; background:; \" |\n|Labour\n|Satvir Kaur\n|Southampton Test\n|South East\n|\n|2024\n|\n|-\n|style=\"width:1px; background:; \" |\n|Labour\n|Sonia Kumar\n|Dudley\n|West Midlands\n|\n|2024\n|\n|-\n|style=\"width:1px; background:; \" |\n|Labour\n|Jeevun Sandher\n|Loughborough\n|East Midlands\n|\n|2024\n|\n|-\n|style=\"width:1px; background:; \" |\n|Labour\n|Baggy Shanker\n|Derby South\n|East Midlands\n|\n|2024\n|\n|-\n|style=\"width:1px; background:; \" |\n|Labour\n|Harpreet Uppal\n|Huddersfield\n|Yorkshire and the Humber\n|\n|2024\n|\n|-\n|}\nEducation\n65% percent of British Sikhs have a graduate level qualification or above. Sikhs in the 20 - 34 age group have the highest level of graduates (55%) within the Sikh community. The highest level of postgraduate qualifications of Master's degrees (22%) is in the 35 - 49 age group. Eight percent of Sikhs aged 65 and over\nhave a PhD. The split of formal education between women and men is roughly equal, with slightly more women holding a university degree or equivalent (48% of women, 42% of men).\nEmployment\nThe most popular employment sectors for British Sikhs include: Healthcare (10%), IT and Technology (8%), Teaching and Education (9%), Accountancy and Financial Management (7%), indicating that Sikhs tend to favour professional and technical employment sectors over others. Healthcare is a popular sector for all age groups. Teaching and Education is more common in the 35 - 49 and the 50 - 64 age groups than others, whereas accountancy and financial management is more popular with the 20 - 34 age group (9%) compared with 6% respectively for both the 35 - 49 and the 50 - 64 age groups. The top career choices for Sikh women are Healthcare (14%) and Teaching and Education (15%). Healthcare is also a joint second most popular choice for Sikh men along with Accountancy and Financial Management, the most popular sector being IT and Technology (13%).\nIntegration\nBritish Sikhs have been praised as an example of positive cultural integration in the United Kingdom, many having achieved success due to a strong cultural work ethic combined with an emphasis on the importance of the family.\nWealth\nHome ownership\nThe 2021 census for England and Wales recorded 75.3% of Sikhs either owning their home with a mortgage (45.7%) or outright (29.6%). 18.9% rent privately or live rent free and the remaining 5.7% live in social housing. Across religious groups, Sikhs held the highest rates of home ownership (compared to 62.8% of the wider population) and were the least likely to live in social housing (compared to 17.1% of the wider population).\nHome ownership is very high amongst British Sikhs with the British Sikh Report in 2014 recording 87% of households owning at least a portion of their home. Thirty percent of British Sikh households own their homes outright and only 9% rent their properties. Only 1% of British Sikhs claim Housing Benefit. This represents the highest level of private home ownership rate over any other community in the UK. In addition, half of all British Sikh families (49%) own more than one property in the UK, with a similar number (50%) owning at least one property in India, apparently indicating that property ownership is used as a top means of building assets for the future. 6% of British Sikhs own property elsewhere in Europe.\nIncome\nRelative to the national average income at approximately £40,000 before tax (according to the British Sikh Report), it found that Sikh households tend to be affluent. Two in every three British Sikh households (66%) have pre-tax incomes in excess of £40,000, and over a third (34%) have an income in excess of £80,000, giving a value for the Sikh Pound of 7.63 billion.\nHowever this data appears to be contradicted by research carried out by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which actually states Sikhs have the second highest poverty rate in the UK, with 27% of British Sikhs living below the poverty line; this is in comparison to 18% of the population as a whole.\nAbout one in three British Sikh families (34%) own a business in the UK.\nCharitable giving and volunteering\nPerforming Seva (selfless service) is a basic tenet of Sikhism, and Sikhs are also expected to share at least 10 per cent of their earnings with those less fortunate and for good causes (Dasvandh).\nSixty-four percent of British Sikhs engage in some volunteering work, and 40% give between one and five hours per week on voluntary activities, including Seva at their Gurdwara, whilst more than 2% spend over 25 hours on such activities, spending about on average 200 hours per year on voluntary activities. Ninety-three percent claim to donate some money to charity every month, with 50% donating between £1 and £20 every month, and 7% donating more than £100 per month. It is estimated that Sikhs in Britain donate around £380 per year to charity on average. Taken as a whole, Sikhs in the UK are estimated to donate about £125 million to charity per annum and spend over 65 million hours each year on voluntary activities.\nCare of the elderly\nSikhs prefer to live in extended family households as they grow older - 61% of males and 52% of females. The second highest preference is in their own home (44% males and 41% females) and the third preference is in a retirement village  (31% females and 24% males).\nGeographical distribution\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable floatright\"\n|+ Top ten English local authorities by Sikh population, 2021\n!

The equivalent census was recorded a year later in Scotland with a population of 10,988, making up 0.2% of the population.\nIn the 2021 census for England and Wales, the main places of birth were the United Kingdom at 299,104 people (57.1% of the total Sikh population), South Asia at 192,485 (36.7%), South and Eastern Africa at 17,659 (3.4%) and other parts of Europe at 8,277 (1.6%). Among individual countries outside of the UK, the countries of: India, Kenya, Afghanistan, Italy, Uganda, Tanzania and Malaysia made up the most common countries of birth for Sikhs residing in England and Wales. 73.8% of Sikhs identified as Indian, 0.1% as either Pakistani or Bangladeshi, 7.3% were of other Asian heritage, 1.3% were of Mixed heritage, 0.7% as White, 0.1% identified as Black and the remaining 16.7% identified with other ethnic groups.\nThe largest ethnic group within the 'other ethnic group' category were Sikhs, with 76,535 using the write-in response option to declare they held Sikh ethnicity. A further 22,814 self-declared that Sikh was their ethnicity within the 'other Asian' category. 426,230 people in England and Wales identified as Sikh through the religion question alone, 1,725 through the ethnic group question alone and 97,910 through both questions together.\nAccording to the 2017 British Sikh Report which surveys the community in the UK, 71% were born in England, followed by 15% in India, 8% in East Africa, 2% in Scotland, and 1% in Afghanistan.\nWest Midlands\nWest Midlands has the highest Sikh population and Sikh proportion of any English region, with 172,398 Sikhs making up 2.9% of the region's population at the 2021 census. The five West Midlands local authorities with the highest Sikh population are Sandwell (39,252), Birmingham (33,126), Wolverhampton (31,769), Coventry (17,297), and Walsall (17,148). The five West Midlands local authorities with the highest Sikh proportion are Wolverhampton (12.0%), Sandwell (11.5%), Walsall (6.0%), Coventry (5.0%), and Warwick (4.2%).

The majority live in West Bromwich and Smethwick. Sandwell's first gurdwara was built in Smethwick, and is the largest outside of London.\nBirmingham\nBirmingham has a large Sikh community numbering 33,126 at the 2021 census (the second-largest of any local authority in England) and making up 2.9% of the city's population. In 2021, Sikhs were the second-largest religious group in Handsworth, where they numbered 5,064 and made up 24.8% of the population.\nWolverhampton\nWolverhampton has a large Sikh community numbering 31,769 at the 2021 census (the third-largest of any local authority in England) and making up 12.0% of the city's population (the largest proportion of any local authority in England). Blakenhall, in Wolverhampton, was home to 5,131 Sikhs in 2021 and had a 40.7% Sikh plurality.\nLondon\nWith 144,543 Sikhs living in London at the 2021 census (1.6% of London's population), the area is home to the second-largest Sikh community in the UK. The five London boroughs with the highest Sikh population are Ealing (28,491), Hillingdon (26,339), Hounslow (24,677), Redbridge (17,622), and Newham (5,638). The five London boroughs with the highest Sikh proportion are Hillingdon (8.6%), Hounslow (8.6%), Ealing (7.8%), Redbridge (5.7%), and Bexley (2.1%).\nEaling\nThe area of Southall in Ealing, also known as \"Little Punjab\", was home to 20,843 Sikhs at the 2021 census and had a 28.2% Sikh plurality.\nHounslow\nHeston, in Hounslow, was home to 10,692 Sikhs in 2021 and had a 25.8% Sikh plurality.\nSouth East\nWith 74,348 Sikhs living in the South East at the 2021 census (0.8% of the region's population), the area is home to the third-largest Sikh community in the UK.

Southall hosts one of the largest Vaisakhi street processions in Europe. Since 2009, both Vaisakhi and Diwali have been celebrated every year at 10 Downing Street, the residence of the British Prime Minister.\nExemptions in British law for Sikhs\nSikhs are exempt from a few British laws on account of religious reasons. For example, men wearing a Dastar (turban) may ride a motorcycle without a helmet, and are permitted to wear their Kirpan as religious dress rather than offensive weapon in certain situations. In February 2010, Sir Mota Singh, Britain's first Asian judge, criticised the banning of the Kirpan in public places such as schools. The tenth and final guru, Guru Gobind Singh formally included the Kirpan as a mandatory article of faith for all baptised Sikhs, making it a duty for Sikhs to be able to defend the needy, suppressed ones, to defend righteousness and the freedom of expression.\nBritish converts to Sikhism\nvisiting the UK and speaking at an event in Parliament with British Sikhs.|alt=|left]]\n* Vic Briggs - former blues musician, now Vikram Singh Khalsa; became the first non-subcontinental to perform kirtan at Harimandir Sahib\n* Max Arthur Macauliffe (1841–1913) - senior administrator of the British Raj who was posted in the Punjab; prolific scholar and author; converted to Sikhism in the 1860s\nDiscrimination\nIn an online survey of 650 Sikhs in the UK, three-quarters of them said they had experienced racism. In spite of this, 95% said they are proud of being born or living in Britain. 43% of the women surveyed said they had experienced discrimination on the basis of gender, and 71% of those had also experienced it within their extended family.\nInfluential British Sikh organisations\nThe Gurdwara remains the focal point of the Sikh community. There are also now a variety of notable organisations which have been setup by Sikhs to support the community:\n* British Sikh Report\n* Basics of Sikhi\n* Central Gurdwara (Khalsa Jatha) London\n* Gurdwara Sahib Leamington and Warwick\n* Guru Nanak Nishkam Sevak Jatha\n* Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha Southall\n* Guru Nanak Gurdwara Smethwick\n* Guru Nanak Darbar Gurdwara\n* Nishkam SWAT\n* Sangat TV\n* Sikh Pioneers & Sikh Light Infantry Association UK\n* Sikh Channel\n* Sikh Federation (UK)\n* The Sikh Awards\n* The Sikh Court\nControversies\nAttitudes towards women\nIn November 2021, according to a report by Sikh Women’s Aid (SWA) organisation, about 70% of the women in UK sikh community has suffered domestic abuse. Over a third of the respondents suffered child sexual abuse. Most of the victims knew their abusers and about half of the incidents took place in home.\nCensus data\nIn 2018, some Sikh organisations requested the ONS to include an ethnic tick box for Sikhs,  creating an ongoing dispute between various Sikh organisations.  The ONS rejected the request. The ONS rejected the demand in their published paper.\nInter-faith marriages\nHolding an Anand Karaj wedding ceremony between a Sikh and a non-Sikh has become a contentious issue. In 2016, armed police arrested scores of protesters at Gurdwara Sahib in Leamington Spa, which The Telegraph claims \"has a history of tensions over mixed marriages\". Sikh Youth UK, who were behind the protest, blamed \"a rogue Gurdwara committee creating discord\".\nOne Sikh journalist called the issue a \"deepening schism\" while another expressed dismay at the protesters' use of masks, and the way their actions allowed the kirpan (ceremonial dagger) to be seen as a bladed weapon rather than traditional dress, thus giving \"the racists and the bigots justifications for their ignorant hatred\". An investigation on BBC Asian Network found that these disruptions over interfaith marriage had been going on for years.\nAlleged grooming of Sikh girls by Muslim men\nA BBC Inside Out (London) programme televised in September 2013 interviewed several young Sikh women who were allegedly groomed and sexually abused by Muslim men, with one alleged ex-groomer even admitting that they specifically targeted Sikh girls. Bhai Mohan Singh, working for the Sikh Awareness Society (SAS), told the BBC he was investigating 19 alleged cases where Sikh girls were allegedly being groomed by older Muslim men, of which one ended with a successful conviction. In August 2013 four Muslims and two Hindus were convicted at Leicester Crown Court of paying a \"vulnerable and damaged\" 16-year-old Sikh girl for sex, the investigation having been opened due to evidence Bhai Mohan Singh had presented to the police.\nHowever, a report published the previous year by Faith Matters (which runs the TELL MAMA anti-Muslim violence helpline and works closely with the Jewish Community Security Trust) claimed that the Sikh Awareness Society included radical anti-Muslim elements among its members; Faith Matters furthermore alleged it was a matter of \"common consensus\" that the radical Sikhs said to have had secret meetings with the English Defence League were members of the SAS. The SAS denied allegations and distanced themselves from the organization, a spokesperson telling Hope not Hate: \"We would have nothing to do with any racist or fascist group, certainly one that uses religion to divide people…I know nothing about this and no, we are not in any kind of talks and discussion with them\". The Nihal Show on the BBC Asian Network discussed the issue and debated the merits of the grooming claims in September 2013.\nIn 2018, a report by a Sikh activist organisation, Sikh Youth UK, entitled “The Religiously Aggravated Sexual Exploitation of Young Sikh Women Across the UK\" made allegations of similarities between the case of Sikh Women and the Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal. However in 2019 this report was criticised by researchers and an official UK government report led by two Sikh academics for false and misleading information. It noted: \"The RASE report lacks solid data, methodological transparency and rigour. It is filled instead with sweeping generalisations and poorly substantiated claims around the nature and scale of abuse of Sikh girls and causal factors driving it. It appealed heavily to historical tensions between Sikhs and Muslims and narratives of honour in a way that seemed designed to whip up fear and hate\".\nAllegations of forced conversions of Sikh girls to Islam\nIn 2007, a Sikh girl's family claimed that she had been forcibly converted to Islam, and after being attacked by an armed gang, they received a police guard. In response to these news stories, an open letter to Sir Ian Blair signed by ten academics argued that claims that Hindu and Sikh girls were being forcefully converted were \"part of an arsenal of myths propagated by right-wing Hindu supremacist organisations in India\". The Muslim Council of Britain issued a press release pointing out there was a lack of evidence of any forced conversions and suggested it was an underhand attempt to smear the British Muslim population.\nAn academic paper by Katy Sian published in the journal South Asian Popular Culture in 2011 explored the question of how \"forced conversion narratives\" arose around the Sikh diaspora in the United Kingdom. Sian, who reports that claims of conversion through courtship on campuses are widespread in the UK, says that rather than relying on actual evidence they primarily rest on the word of \"a friend of a friend\" or on personal anecdote. According to Sian, the narrative is similar to accusations of \"white slavery\" lodged against the Jewish community and foreigners to the UK and the US, with the former having ties to antisemitism that mirror the Islamophobia betrayed by the modern narrative. Sian expanded on these views in 2013's Mistaken Identities, Forced Conversions, and Postcolonial Formations.\nSee also\n*List of British Sikhs\n*Sikhism in England\n*Sikhism in Northern Ireland\n*Sikhism in Scotland\n*Sikhism in Wales\n*British Indians\n*British Punjabis\n*British Sikh Report\n*Sikhism by country\n* Sikhism in Australia\n* Sikhism in Canada\n* Sikhism in the United States\n* Sikhism in New Zealand\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Sikhs in Britain: the making of a community  (Zed, 2006) by Prof. Gurharpal Singh and Dr. Darshan Singh Tatla.\nExternal links\n*[http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/Collections/Onlineresources/RWWC/themes/1301/1217 Reassessing what we collect website&nbsp;– Sikh London] History of Sikh London with objects and images"
