      "text": "# 1862 Morpeth colonial by-election\n\nA by-election was held for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly electorate of Morpeth on 18 September 1862 because David Buchanan was insolvent and resigned his seat. Buchanan had unsuccessfully sued the Sydney Morning Herald for libel and was required to pay their legal costs. He was unable to pay and declared himself bankrupt and resigned from parliament. Buchanan re-contested the seat at the resulting by-election but was defeated, with Edward Close Jr. being elected from that electoral district.\nDates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Date !!
