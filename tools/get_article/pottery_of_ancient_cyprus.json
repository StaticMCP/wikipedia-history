Cypriot ceramics demonstrate many connections with cultures from around the Mediterranean. During the Early and Middle Bronze Ages, it is especially imaginative in shape and decoration. There are also many early terracotta figurines that were produced depicting female figures.\nThe typo-chronology of Cypriot pottery for the Iron Age was established by Einar Gjerstad based on material excavated by the Swedish Cyprus Expedition. Gjerstad divided the Iron Age into three periods, the Cypro-Geometric (1050–750 BC), the Cypro-Archaic (750–480 BC) and the Cypro-Classical (480–310 BC), which are in turn subdivided;CG I–III, CA I–II and CC I–II. Each period corresponds to one pottery type, with a total of seven, Types I–VII. The exact dates of the chronology of Gjerstad have been slightly revised following more current research. The typochronology is explained in his main work Swedish Cyprus Expedition IV, 2. The Cypro-geometric, Cypro-archaic and Cypro-classical Periods (1948) with further remarks made in the article Pottery Types, Cypro-Geometric to Cypro-Classical (1960).\nNeolithic Age\nThe earliest widely used ceramics during the 5th millennium BC are of the dark faced burnished ware type. This ceramic technique was followed by the following techniques:\n* Red on White ware\n* \"Combed ware\"\n* Painted and Combed ware, a combination of the two previous types\nBronze Age\n\"Red Polished Ware\" has been found from the start of the Bronze Age in Cyprus.\nWhite-slip Ware was made .\nBase-ring Ware is also considered to be a \"typical Cypriot\" ceramic \"of the Late Bronze Age\".\nRed polished cypriot flask Antikensammlung Kiel.jpg|Cypriot Red Polished Ware II–III, 2200–1700 BC.

Intricate 'Free-field' compositions graced juglets and jars. Ubiquitous concentric circles were applied to jars, juglets, bowls and kraters using multiple brushes. Finer wares like plates, bowls and jugs were made on the fast wheel, while larger forms like amphoras, amphoroid kraters and pithoi were built with a combination of techniques: wheel throwing, hand coiling or molding.\"\nCypro-Geometric I\nFrom 1050 to 950 BC, characteristic pottery were\n* \"White Painted I\"\n* \"Bichrome I Ware\"\n* \"Plain White I\"\n* \"Black Slip I\"\nBowl - White Painted Ware I – Iron Age.JPG|Cypriot White Painted I Ware, Iron Age.
