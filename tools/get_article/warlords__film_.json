The action scenes are dire – people jump off cliffs before the explosions that are meant to throw them go off, others stand still for people to turn around and shoot them. There is an extremely bad creature in a bag effect that is accompanied by an unbelievably annoying squeaky voice over.\" John McCarthy, in his book about B-movies, found that \"No word can describe how bad it was.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096419/ Warlords] at IMDb\n*[https://letterboxd.com/film/warlords/ Warlords] at Letterbox DVD"
