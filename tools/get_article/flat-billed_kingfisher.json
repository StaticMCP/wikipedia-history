It is endemic to Samoa.\nDistribution\nFlat-billed kingfishers are found on the islands of Upolu and Savai'i in lowland and coastal areas.  They were found not found in upland forests above 1,200m, most likely because food items become increasingly scarce with increased elevation.\nEcology\nLike other species of kingfishers, the flat-billed kingfisher eats a variety of different food sources.  However, they appear to be somewhat reliant on large insects and reptiles as part of their diet.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Flat-billed Kingfisher\n\n#REDIRECT Flat-billed kingfisher\n}}"
