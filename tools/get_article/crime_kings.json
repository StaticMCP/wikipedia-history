The film is based on the real life story of Suea Bai, a bandit who stole from the rich, and was prominent in 1940’s Central Thailand, and is considered to be the Thai equivalent of Robin Hood. It is one of the several films that is based on the story of Suea Bai.\nPlot\nIn 1946, after World War II, Siam was in turmoil. The land was engulfed in flames, and chaos spread across the country. Poverty and hardship were rampant, with criminals and bandits looting everywhere, especially in the central region. However, a notorious outlaw from Lopburi, known as Suea Bai (Amphon Lamphun), was different—he stole from corrupt wealthy individuals to help the poor.\nTo stop him, the police department assigned Captain Yodying Suwannakhiri (Dom Hetrakul), a skilled officer, to capture Suea Bai. Suea Bai had a loyal right-hand man, Suea Yod, a dual-pistol gunslinger (Suphakorn Kistuwon).\nWhen the two finally crossed paths, Captain Yodying uncovered Suea Bai’s true identity—he was not just an ordinary bandit but actually Rewat Wichuprapha, the son of Phra Ya Borirak Pracharat (Lt. Col. Krisada Arunwong na Ayutthaya), a former high-ranking official who was falsely accused after the political transition. As a result, he was forced out of government service and hunted down, leaving his only son with no choice but to flee into the jungle and become an outlaw.\nDespite Captain Yodying's efforts to persuade him to change his ways, Suea Bai refused. In the end, the two were left with no choice but to settle their fates in a deadly gun duel.\nCast\n* Amphon Lamphun - Suea Bai / Rewat Wichuprapha\n* Dom Hetrakul - Captain Yodying Suwannakhon\n* Supakorn Kitsuwon - Suea Yot, the Twin-Gun Tiger\n* Sananthinee Phanchujit - Philaiwan\n* Suphawat Amprasit - Suea Phao\n* Peter Maiocchi - Lieutenant Manoch\n* Yodrak Salakjai - Dr. Kiatt\n* Suthep Hope - Sun\n* Khajonsak Rattananissai - Nivat\n* Sirilak Thakingsuk - Burong\n* Captain Kritsada Arunwong na Ayutthaya - Phraya Borirak Pracharat\n* Cris Horwang - Nu Tiw\n* Khaosai Galaxy - Suea Muay\n* Witit Lat - Suea Jerd\n* Korakot Thanapat - Suea Ched\n* Jenphop Chobkrabuanwan - Nai Prathuang\n* Nonthree Nimibutr - Suea Oui\n* Khajonsak Rattananissai - Nivat\n* Kraisri Kaewwimon - Director-General of the Police Department\n* Thanin Sanguanwong - Lieutenant Prasit\n* Wiput Kulwong - Lieutenant Sathaan\n* Somdej Santipracha - Nai Sanit\n*  Udom Udomroj - Nai Chamnarn\n* Sakchai Sriboonnak - Suea Phiw\n* Rittichai Rodsattru - Suea Choi\n* Decha Senawat - Suea Kob\n* Khemachart Yennum - Suea Pad\n* Thiranit Thamrongwinitchai - Nai Kosin\n* Ratch Boonchum - Captain Atth\n* Jakkrit Maneenil - Lieutenant Somyot\n* Kanchana Saengsi - Bua\n* Jenjira Chansuda - Krathin\n* Phannee To-na-yee - Ratree\n* Manatchanok Maneethong - Buaphan\n* Chaiya Sudjaidee - Suea Dee\n* Suwajanee Chaimusik - The woman sitting on the bus\n* Dr. Apiwat Wattanangkur - Minister's Secretary\n* Michael Welch - Suea Noi\n* Suchin Khwansanguan - The policeman welcoming Captain Yodying\nBehind the Scenes\nCrime Kings is adapted from the novel Suea Bai by P.
