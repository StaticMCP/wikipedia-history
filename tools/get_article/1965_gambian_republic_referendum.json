If the referendum had passed, the post of president would have replaced Elizabeth II as head of state, and thus eliminated the post of Governor-General.\nThere were 154,626 registered voters for the referendum, with 93,484 valid votes cast. 65.85% of voters voted for the proposal, but failed to reach the two-thirds support required for the proposal to be accepted.\nA second referendum was held in 1970, which resulted in a successful \"yes\" vote. Prime Minister Dawda Jawara was elected president by the parliament, replacing Elizabeth II (represented by Farimang Mamadi Singateh) as head of state on 24 April 1970.\nResult\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n!Choice\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n|align=left|For||61,563||65.85\n|-\n|align=left|Against||31,921||34.15\n|-\n|align=left|Total||93,484||100\n|-\n|align=left|Registered voters/turnout||154,626||60.46\n|-\n|align=left colspan=3|Source: [http://africanelections.tripod.com/gm.html#1965_Plebiscite African Elections database]\n|}\nReferences"
