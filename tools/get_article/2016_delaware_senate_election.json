The election coincided with the elections for other offices, including the Presidency, U.S. House of Representatives, and state house. The primary election was held on September 13, 2016.\nDelaware Republicans needed to have a net gain of two seats to flip the chamber from the Democrats. However, they gained only one seat (winning 10 seats compared to 11 seats for the Democrats).\nResults summary\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:14px;\"\n! colspan=\"1\" |District\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Incumbent\n! colspan=\"2\" |Party\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Elected Senator\n! colspan=\"2\" |Party\n|-\n! 1\n| Harris McDowell III\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Dem\n| Harris McDowell III\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Dem\n|-\n! 5\n| Catherine Cloutier\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Rep\n| Catherine Cloutier\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Rep\n|-\n! 7\n| Patti Blevins\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Dem\n| Anthony Delcollo\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Rep\n|-\n! 8\n| David Sokola\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Dem\n| David Sokola\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Dem\n|-\n! 9\n| Karen Peterson\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Dem\n|  Jack Walsh\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Dem\n|-\n! 12\n| Nicole Poore\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Dem\n| Nicole Poore\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Dem\n|-\n! 13\n| David McBride\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Dem\n| David McBride\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Dem\n|-\n! 14\n| Bruce Ennis\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Dem\n| Bruce Ennis\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Dem\n|-\n! 15\n| David Lawson\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Rep\n| David Lawson\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Rep\n|-\n! 19\n| Brian Pettyjohn\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Rep\n| Brian Pettyjohn\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Rep\n|-\n! 20\n| Gerald Hocker\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Rep\n| Gerald Hocker\n| style=\"background:;\" |\n|Rep\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 rowspan=2|Party !! rowspan=2|Candi-dates !! colspan=2|Votes !! colspan=3|Seats\n|-\n!
