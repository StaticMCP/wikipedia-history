Today it is indistinguishable from the extended village of Burnham and is no longer marked on Ordnance Survey 1:50000 maps as a separate settlement. It is to the west of Burnham, close to the village of Taplow, and adjacent to the common on which Burnham Beeches stands.\nThe village name 'Hitcham' is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means 'Hycga's homestead'. In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village was recorded as Hucheham.\nIn 1931 the parish had a population of 886. The civil parish of Hitcham was abolished on 1 April 1934 under a County Review Order, with the urban part going to Burnham parish, a larger but less populous part going to Taplow, and a tiny sliver going to Dorney.\nThe road Hitcham Lane still exists, and features Hitcham House, a large Manor House, now subdivided into several private residential properties.\nReferences\nExternal links"
