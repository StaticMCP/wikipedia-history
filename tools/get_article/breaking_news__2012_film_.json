Rangayana Raghu is at his best as a politician. Music by Stephen Prayag has some catchy tunes. Camera by AV Krishnakumar is good\". Srikanth Srinivasa from Rediff.com scored the film at 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"The music by Stephen Prayog is okay. The film falls below the benchmark Nagathihalli Chandrashekar set with his earlier films. Krishna Kumar's camera work is just average. Breaking News is a light-hearted movie with bad production values\". Shruti I. L from DNA wrote \"Ramakrishna, Sangeetha and Doddanna are all well-placed. Hopefully, ‘Malebillhe’ will be the last such role for Digant.  Finally, rainbow is known as Kamanabillu or Malebillu in Kannada, not ‘Malebillhe’ or ‘Malebille’!\". A critic from Bangalore Mirror wrote  \"Throughout the film, Ajai Rao acts like a trainee reporter who has just been handed a mike and a cameraman to tow him. Only Anant Nag has a real role to play in the film. The rest — from Rangayana Raghu to Sadhu Kokila —  were perhaps roped in for a circus show. The songs have a sense of purpose and are set to good tunes\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
