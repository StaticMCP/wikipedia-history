This kingdom is surrounded by other Urhobo communities in the locality.\nThe traditional seat of government in this kingdom is located at Isiokolo.\nHistory\nOral tradition speaks of migrations from the ancient Benin Kingdom by the Urhobos that gave rise to this area.\nThe founders of Agbon migrated through Kwale, probably from Erhowa, settled at Ehwen and Erhivwi or Irri in present Isoko division of Delta State. From there they moved down to Utokori, close to Ughwerun; then to Olomu and through the present Ughelli territory of Ekuigbo to found '''Otorho r' Agbon''' now known as Isiokolo.\nIsiokolo is now the recognised ancestral place of leadership by the members of this kingdom.\nLocation\nAgbon Kingdom covers about 375 square kilometres. The land is bounded in the north by Abraka kingdom, and Orhionmwon Local Government Area in neighbouring Edo State, On the east, it is bounded by Orogun, Agbahra Otor, Agbarho Kingdoms, Ujode River, and Ekrerhavwe, all of them Urhobo communities in Ughelli North Local Government Area. In Agbon's west and south lies Aghalokpe and Orerokpe of Okpe Local Government Area.\nLeadership\nHis Royal Majesty, Ogurime-Rime Ukori I is the current King and Ovie of Agbon Kingdom.\nHe was crowned Ovie in February 2013 succeeding the late Ogurime-Rime Okpara I\nNatural resources\nThis kingdom produces a variety of food crops, mostly yam, plantain and cassava. Cash crops as palm produce and rubber plantations also flourish here. Agbon holds a large reservoir of crude oil which is a major source of income to Nigeria; the Erhorike oil wells are considered to be among the shallowest in the world and are found here.\nPopulation\nThe kingdom is highly populated as it has an extensive range of towns and villages under its territorial domain. It has been ranked the second most populous cultural unit in Urhobo land, coming only after Okpe. The population of this kingdom alone amounts for more than 40% of the Delta state population.\nLanguage\nThe people of Agbon speak Urhobo as their mother tongue with little or no dialectical forms. The Nigerian pidgin is also widespread in this kingdom as well as English, the lingua franca of Nigeria.\nComposition\nThis kingdom is made up of a wide array of sub-kingdoms and villages or towns. These sub-kingdoms are the consequences of migrations from one terrain to another.\nSub-kingdoms\n* Okpara  (first son)\n* Kokori (second son)\n* Orhoakpor (third son)\n* Ovu (descendant of Okpara)\n* Igun\nTowns and villages\nSome Of The Towns In Agbon Kingdom;\n* Isiokolo\n* Ekrebuo\n* Kokori\n* Erhomeghwu\n* Okuidjerhe\n* Samagidi\n* Egbogho\n* Urhwokpe\n* Ekraka\n* Erhonaka\n* Erhorike\n* Okpara Inland\n* Okurutuyo\n* Okuekpagha\n* Unumane\n* Okoradaode\n* Okurufor\n* Okururhujevwe\n* Umiaghwa\n* Okurihohi\n* Okuibada\n* Erhokori\n* Orhoakpor\n* Ekrudu\n* Okukpokpo\n* Okureghwro\n* Eku\n* Igun\n* Otumara\n* Okpara W/S\n* Okorogba\n* Okurekpo\n* Okuredafe\n* Oviorie\n* Ovu Inland\n* Okuemeka\n* Okurekpagha\n* Okuogbamu\n* Ovwere\n* Urhodo\n* Okumodje\n* Obadjere\n* Ekpan\n* Igwevwore\n* Okwokpokpo\n* Ekusioro\n* Okurobi\n* Okuronika\n* Okuighele\n* Ekirugbo.\n* okuomoise\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120618072649/http://asemeyese.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1298&Itemid=798 Agbon Kingdom] at Asemeyese.com\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
