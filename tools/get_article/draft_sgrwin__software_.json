It targets mission-critical communications in sectors such as electric utilities, transportation and public infrastructure, and is used to manage combined IT and OT environments in the context of IT/OT convergence. The product implements functions aligned with the FCAPS model and supports a broad range of telecom and industrial protocols, including IEC 61850.\nHistory\nSGRwin was released by CIC in 1995 as a Windows-based network management solution for mission-critical companies. Over time it expanded from PDH/SDH networks to IP/Ethernet devices, incorporating OSS-type capabilities (e.g., end-to-end circuit provisioning and inventory) and support for substation automation (IEC 61850).\nArchitecture and features\nSGRwin acts as a vendor-agnostic umbrella NMS for mixed IT/OT environments, facilitating IT/OT convergence in critical infrastructure. It consolidates data from heterogeneous equipment and EMSs into a unified web console and maps its modules to the FCAPS model.\nThe platform is deployed on-premises on Windows Server and supports distributed/multi-region and high-availability deployments. It exposes APIs for integration with OSS/BSS and ITSM, and supports IT protocols (SNMP, Syslog, SSH/SFTP, WMI, HTTPS APIs) and OT/telecom protocols (PDH/SDH, MPLS-TP, TETRA, GSM/LTE, IEC 61850/IEC 60870-5, Modbus).\nFault management\nReal-time alarms, correlation and root-cause analysis with noise reduction and geographic visualization.\nConfiguration management\nUnified multi-vendor configuration, backups/restores and end-to-end (E2E) service/circuit provisioning.\nInventory / resources (Accounting)\nAuto-discovery and asset inventory (model, firmware, location), capacity reporting and service impact mapping.\nPerformance and SLA\nTraffic and health KPIs, thresholds, historical trends and SLA reporting.\nSecurity\nRole-based access control, auditing, LDAP/AD integrations and AI-assisted anomaly detection (AIOps).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ SGRwin capabilities overview\n! Scope !! Summary\n|-\n| Approach || Vendor-agnostic umbrella NMS for IT/OT convergence in critical networks.\n|-\n| FCAPS || Fault: alarms & correlation; Configuration: unified config, backups & E2E; Accounting: inventory/resources; Performance: KPIs & SLA; Security: access control & auditing.\n|-\n| Protocols (OT/IT) || Examples: IT (SNMP, Syslog, SSH/SFTP, WMI, HTTPS APIs); OT/telecom (PDH/SDH, MPLS-TP, TETRA, IEC 61850, IEC 60870-5, Modbus).\n|-\n| Typical devices || PDH/SDH multiplexers, IP/MPLS routers, microwave radios, power line carrier, substation IEDs, RTUs, industrial switches.\n|-\n| Deployment || On-premises Windows Server; distributed/multi-region and HA options; integration with OSS/BSS and ITSM via APIs.\n|-\n| Security & compliance || Roles, auditing and config integrity; alignment with ENS and objectives of the EU NIS2.\n|}\nProtocols and supported devices\nSupport for IT protocols (e.g., SNMP v1/v2c/v3, Syslog, SSH/SFTP, WMI, HTTPS APIs) and OT/telecom protocols (e.g., PDH, SDH, MPLS-TP, TETRA, GSM/LTE). For the power sector it supports IEC 61850 (GOOSE, MMS, SV) and IEC 60870-5-101/104, as well as Modbus.\nDeployment\nOn-premises installation on Windows Server with a web client; single-site or distributed/multi-region architectures and high-availability options. Integrates with OSS/BSS and ITSM tools via APIs.\nSecurity and compliance\nThe system includes access controls, activity auditing, configuration integrity checks and reporting to support regulatory frameworks (e.g., Spain’s ENS) and alignment with EU NIS2 objectives.\nUse cases\nSGRwin is used by electric utilities, transportation operators and service providers as a converged NMS for mixed OT/IT environments. Public cases include deployments in Iceland (utility telecom, multi-vendor environment) and references in Finland’s transmission grid domain.\nIn the context of replacing historical SNMP managers, SGRwin has been deployed as a replacement for SNMPc (by Castle Rock Computing) in certain environments, according to independent distributors; Castle Rock itself indicates that SNMPc is available only to U.S. Government and existing customers, a circumstance that has driven migrations to other solutions.\nIn the Nordic region, technology partners have publicized specific SGRwin functionality such as a geographical map add-on for real-time visualization of assets and incidents.\nSee also\n* Network management system\n* FCAPS\n* IT/OT convergence\n* IEC 61850\n* Operations support system\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.sgrwin.com Official website]"
