It is a single story wood-frame structure, with a stone veneer exterior, cream-colored brick trim, and a gabled roof.  A gabled porch projects from the center of the modest house, with an arched opening lined with bricks.  The house was built in 1949 by African-American mason Silas Owens, Sr., and is the only house he is known to have done in granite instead of his preferred sandstone.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Faulkner County, Arkansas\nReferences"
