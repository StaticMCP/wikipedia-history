It is named for its location in the city's former fourth political ward. The district is almost entirely residential and developed at a \"leisurely pace\" between the 1880s and 1930s. As a result, it includes houses in a wide variety of sizes and styles including Queen Anne, Italianate, Tudor, Dutch Colonial, Prairie School, Mediterranean, Pueblo, Territorial, Mission, and Bungalow. The district was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1979 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\nThe district includes two properties which are also individually listed on the National Register, the J. H. O'Rielly House and Berthold Spitz House.\nReferences"
