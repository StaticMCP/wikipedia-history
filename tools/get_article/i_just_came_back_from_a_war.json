The strain of war must be incredible.\" He adds, \"This song is from the soldier's perspective and the message is, 'Hey man, cut me a little slack if I need a little time to re-adjust here. I'll get there but be a little patient with me - I just came back from a war.\"\nMusic video\nThe music video was directed by Jacob Hatley and premiered in December 7, 2006.
