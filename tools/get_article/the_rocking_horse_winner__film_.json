It is an adaptation of the D. H. Lawrence short story The Rocking-Horse Winner'' and starred Valerie Hobson, John Howard Davies and Ronald Squire. Producer of the film John Mills also acted in the film.\nIt was shot at Denham Studios with sets designed by the art director Carmen Dillon.\nPlot\nThe upper middle-class Grahame family are beset by money troubles, because of the lavish tastes of Hester who spends far more than their income. Her husband responds by gambling at cards, but just loses more money. Her elder brother Oscar bails her out several times but warns that he will not do so in future. Meanwhile her son Paul strikes up a friendship with Bassett, the new handyman and a former jockey. Paul is delighted when he receives a rocking horse for Christmas and shortly afterwards a whip. Concerns about the family's finances and his mother's unhappiness and lack of luck begin to affect Paul who is convinced that the house is whispering about them. He is seen riding his rocking horse in a total frenzy, terrifying his younger sisters.\nConvinced that he is lucky, Paul asks Bassett to place a small wager on a horse. Proving to be able to pick winners consistently, which he claims to discover while riding his rocking horse, he forms a secret syndicate with Bassett and his uncle which is soon thousands of pounds in profit. Meanwhile, Hester is struggling with bailiffs and forced to pawn clothes. Desperate to help his mother, Paul agrees that thousands of pounds be given to his mother without her knowing its true source. They pretend this is an inheritance from a distant relative.\nRather than making her happier, Hester becomes even more driven in her reckless spending. Then Paul's apparent gift at picking winners vanishes, and the syndicate loses most of its winnings. Convinced that everything rides on choosing the victor for the Derby, Paul frantically rides on his horse. Eventually he cries out \"Malabar\" before suffering a seizure. Bassett places the money on the horse, in line with Paul's instructions, and wins £70,000. Shortly after the stricken boy is told of this, he reconnects with his mother telling her that he was 'lucky' and then dies. A distraught Hester instructs Bassett to burn the rocking horse, which he does, and also the money, which he refuses to do, stating he will give it to the family solicitor to find some good to do with it, as Paul would have wanted.\nCast\n* Valerie Hobson as Hester Grahame\n* John Howard Davies as Paul Grahame\n* Ronald Squire as Oscar Cresswell\n* John Mills as Bassett\n* Hugh Sinclair as Richard Grahame\n* Charles Goldner as Mr. Tsaldouris\n* Susan Richards as the nannie\n* Cyril Smith as the bailiff\n* Anthony Holles as Bowler Hat\n* Michael Ripper as 2nd Chauffeur\n* Johnnie Schofield as 1st Chauffeur\n* Caroline Steer as Joan Grahame\n* Melanie Mackenzie as Matilda Grahame\nReception\nThe film was considered a faithful adaptation of Lawrence's story.\nSee also\n* List of films about horse racing\nReferences\nBibliography\n* The Great British Films, pp.&nbsp;137–139, Jerry Vermilye, 1978, Citadel Press, .\nExternal links\n*\n*"
