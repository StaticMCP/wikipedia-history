CWDIS considered itself a direct successor of the Union of Bolshevik-Leninists, founded by Leon Trotsky in 1928. The organization was engaged in the distribution of its propaganda materials and actively participated in the events of 1991 and 1993 in Moscow, opposed the introduction of the \"anti-worker\" Code of Labor Laws. The committee published the newspaper \"Workers' Democracy\". In 1993, the organization split over the issue of membership in the CWI. As a result, two groups with the same name were formed.\nCWDIS, section of CWI\nWas engaged in the publication of the newspaper \"Workers' Democracy. In 1998, the organization changed its name to Socialist Resistance and the newspaper to Left Vanguard.\nCWDIS\nMembers of the organization advocated the creation of a \"revolutionary workers' party\", are not used with any structures. CWDIS began a unifying discussion with the Marxist Workers' Party, in the framework of which several seminars were held on the class nature of the USSR. However, the unification never took place. In 1998, at the Sixth Congress of the CWDIS in Moscow, one of the leaders of the organization, Sergei Biets, proposed to join the Committee for the Marxist International (KMI). His proposal then did not find support.\nIn January 1999, the Seventh Congress was held, at which the organization decided to join the KMI. At the same congress, the CWDIS was renamed the Revolutionary Workers' Party. At the same congress Boris Stomakhin was expelled from the organization.\nSee also\n* Revolutionary Workers' Party\n* Socialist Resistance\nReferences"
