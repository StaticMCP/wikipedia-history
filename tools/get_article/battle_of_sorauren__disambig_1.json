In the battle, the French attacked up the slope of the Oricain Ridge and failed. Historian Michael Glover states that this defensive position was almost as strong as that which Wellesley occupied at Bussaco in 1810. He also points out that the French were nearly out of supplies in the lead-up to the battle.\nPrelude\nWith sizable Anglo-Portuguese forces tied up in assaulting San Sebastián and besieging Pamplona, the new French commander Marshal Soult launched a counterattack with the ''Armée d'Espagne'' through Maya and Roncesvalles. Although the French initially enjoyed local superiority, the tough terrain combined with stubborn British and Portuguese resistance slowed the French advance to a crawl. Before the battle at Sorauren, Soult called for his mid-day meal and afterwards refreshed himself with a short sleep. \"Meanwhile Clausel was leaning against an oak tree beating his forehead with rage and muttering, 'Who could go to sleep at a moment like this?'\"\nBattle\nThe main French column of about 36,000 men under Clausel and Reille marched to attack Sorauren. On the 27July the heavily outnumbered British forces there were drawn up on the Oricain Ridge. Wellesley made a dramatic ride along the ridge in front of the cheering British and Portuguese troops and Soult postponed the attack until the next day. By the time the French attack was launched, reinforcements had arrived, bringing the total allied force to about 24,000 men.\nOn the 28th the fighting at the top of the ridge was bitter and bloody, but the defenders held the French off. About midday, the 6th Division arrived and Wellesley sent them to assault the French right flank. More fresh units reached the field and Soult soon ordered a withdrawal. The French suffered between 3,000 and 4,000 casualties, while Wellesley's army lost 2,652, namely, 1,358 British, 1,102 Portuguese and 192 Spaniards.\nOn the 30July the retreat from Sorauren cost the French 3,500 casualties, as they tried to get between Wellesley's army and San Sebastián. At Beunza, 5,100 Portuguese and 4,000 British fended off another attempt.\nAftermath\nWith his momentum lost, Soult withdrew into France to prepare his defence against the imminent Allied offensive.\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
