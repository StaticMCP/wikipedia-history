The film was released on October 10, 2015.\nPlot\nIt is a time in which the expression of thought is censored, and the media is tightly controlled. Bearing up under a harsh regimen of instruction under the terrifying Atsushi Dojo, Iku Kasahara is now a full-fledged member of the Library Defense ‘Task Force’, and divides her time between hard physical training and regular library work. Dojo and the rest of the Task Force are ordered to guard a public exhibition featuring ‘The Handbook of Library Law’, a book widely seen as the symbol of freedom, of which there is only one existing copy. The assignment seems easy enough, but this is in fact a trap designed to wipe out and thus disband the Task Force and restore a twisted society to the correct moral path.\nCast\n*Junichi Okada - Atsushi Dojo\n*Nana Eikura - Iku Kasahara\n*Kei Tanaka - Mikihisa Komaki\n*Sota Fukushi - Hikaru Tezuka\n*Naomi Nishida - Maki Orikuchi\n* - Ryusuke Kenta\n*Tao Tsuchiya - Marie Nakazawa\n*Aoi Nakamura - Shuji Asahina\n*Kazuyuki Aijima - Hajime Biitani\n*Kiyoshi Kodama\n*Tori Matsuzaka - Satoshi Tezuka\n*Chiaki Kuriyama - Asako Shibasaki\nReception\nLibrary Wars: The Last Mission grossed US$16.8 million in Japan.
