Several weeks before the award ceremony, ten nominees for each category are announced. Fans can cast one vote a day on each category by giving the nominees 1 to 10 points. Each week, the nominee who has the fewest points is eliminated from contention until only five candidates remain. The finalist who makes it to the end of the voting period with the most points is the winner.\nHistory\n{| class=wikitable\n! Year !! Date !! Venue !!
