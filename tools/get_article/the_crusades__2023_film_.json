The film begins with the boys training Jack for a fight with a deaf student at a rival school, St. Matthews. The fight, taking place at a baseball diamond, results in Jack getting beaten up badly. Before the fight can end, the police show up and the boys, as well as dozens of onlookers scatter. Leo hops on a bike with Sean riding on the back. As they are racing away from the scene of the crime, they run over the leg of Ryan, a girl from their sister school.\nThe next school day, Jack is called into the dean’s office to discuss what took place. He denies everything, and Dean Whitman has more important things to attend to. The dean announces to the school that there are discussions taking place about a possible merger with St. Matthews. Vince, Ryan’s boyfriend, is a student at St. Matthews and knows Leo and Sean broke Ryan’s leg fleeing from the fight. The boys try to figure out how they can navigate this possible merger and not get killed by Vince.\nLeo has to navigate a high school crush for his Italian teacher, Ms. Kerpial, while ignoring advances from Ryan, who doesn’t know he broke her leg. Sean must balance his time with his girlfriend Jess while making sure his friends don’t get killed by Vince. Jack is seeking the attention of any girl who will take him seriously.\nThe boys try to hide out from Vince at a party, but he finds them. Sean abandons Jess to try to protect his friends. A pursuit ensues, and Vince and his gang, \"The Wrecking Crew\", catch the boys and beat them up. They are rescued by a retired neighbor, Mr. Podkowa, who they had previously taunted. Vince decides to tell all after getting caught. He reveals he was in a relationship with Ms. Kerpial, who gets arrested for child molestation. He also reveals to Ryan that Leo broke her leg.
