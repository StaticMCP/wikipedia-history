It was declared bien de interés cultural'' in 2008.\nA new restoration, intending to consolidate the monument by installing a core of reinforced concrete, also recovering elements of the original work, such as an Earth orb or a crown, took place in the 2010s. Works finished by 2014, and the monument, standing 54,90 metre high including the recovered elements, was re-inaugurated on 31 July 2014.
