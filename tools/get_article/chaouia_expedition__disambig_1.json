Instead, the king decided to respond to an appeal made to him by Mawlāy Abū al-Ḥadjdjādj Yūsuf ibn Zayyān (Mulei Befageja in Portuguese), a close relative of the Wattasid Sultan, to conduct a punitive expedition against the inhabitants of Chaouia (Enxovia in Portuguese) between Anfa and Larache, who had revolted.\nThe expedition departed on August 1487 carrying 150 horsemen and 1000 infantry among crossbowmen and arquebusiers, under the overall command of Dom Diogo Fernandes de Almeida, with Dom João de Ataíde as second-in-command. It anchored in the harbour of Anfa, destroyed in a previous attack in 1469, and Dom Diogo sent scouts or spies ashore to reconnoitre the land.\nA number of Andaluzi horsemen joined the Portuguese. Having identified a number of settlements inland, the Portuguese disembarked that night and proceeded to devastate the villages and camps along the coast between Anfa and a region north of Sebou River and five leagues to the south of Larache, which the Portuguese identified as \"Alagoas\", killing 900 and capturing 300, 400 or 900 persons, horses and cattle.\nSee also\n*Conquest of Ceuta\n*Anfa Expedition (1468)\n*Conquest of Asilah\n*Portuguese Asilah\n*Portuguese Tangier\nReferences"
