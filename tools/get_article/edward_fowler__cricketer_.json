He was educated at Uppingham School, before going up to St Peter's College, Oxford. While studying at Oxford, he made two appearances in first-class cricket for Oxford University in 1993, at Oxford against Hampshire and Middlesex. After graduating from Oxford, he was admitted to practice as a solicitor in 1998 and later became a partner at Northampton law firm Scott Fowler.
