This is implicitly also the invention of the Geiger Muller counter.\n* 1934 - Ernest Lawrence and Stan Livingston invent the cyclotron.\n* 1945 - Edwin McMillan devises a synchrotron.\n* 1952 - Donald Glaser develops the bubble chamber.\n* 1968 - Georges Charpak and Roger Bouclier build the first multiwire proportional mode particle detection chamber."
