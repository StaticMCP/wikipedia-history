Developed for television by Frank Darabont, the series is based on the eponymous series of comic books by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard. It was executive produced by Darabont, Kirkman, Glen Mazzara, David Alpert, and Gale Anne Hurd, with Mazzara assuming the role of showrunner after Darabont's departure from the series.\nThe season was well received by critics. It won Best Television Presentation at the 38th Saturn Awards and Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup for a Series, Miniseries, Movie, or Special at the 64th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards. The season finale was viewed by 9 million viewers, making it the highest-rated episode of the series up to that point and the most viewed episode of an original series on AMC in history, up until the premiere of the series' third season, which was watched by 10.9 million viewers.\nThis season adapts material from issues #6–19 of the comic book series and introduces notable comic characters Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson) and his daughter, Maggie (Lauren Cohan). Mainly set at the Greene Family Farm, the season continues the story of Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) and his group of survivors as they continue to survive in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by flesh-eating zombies, dubbed \"walkers\". After leaving Atlanta, Rick and the group are stopped on a highway by a novel threat. While searching for someone who has gone missing, the group discovers an isolated farm, where tensions and complex relationships arise with its owners. The increasing revelations pit Rick against Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal), each holding a different vision for leading the group.\nProduction\nin 2011; (left to right): executive producer Gale Anne Hurd, Andrew Lincoln (Rick Grimes), Sarah Wayne Callies (Lori Grimes), Jon Bernthal (Shane Walsh), Laurie Holden (Andrea), Steven Yeun (Glenn Rhee), and Emma Bell (Amy)]]\nAfter the first season aired, Deadline Hollywood reported that series developer and showrunner Frank Darabont had let go the entire writing staff and planned to use only freelance writers for the second season. This turned out to be not entirely accurate, and Robert Kirkman was quoted as saying the changes to the writing staff would not affect the production of the show. In February 2011, it was announced that Glen Mazzara, who had written the first season episode \"Wildfire\", had been hired again as a writer/executive producer for the second season and will put together a staff of five more writers.\nAt C2E2 members of the cast confirmed that the second season would begin shooting on June 1, 2011, and that Darabont would write the season premiere episode. At the same event, cast members speculated that acclaimed author and long-time Darabont collaborator Stephen King may write an episode. Kirkman later confirmed that along with himself, Darabont and Mazzara the writing staff will consist of Scott M. Gimple, Evan Reilly, Angela Kang and one freelance writer, David Leslie Johnson. Four actors have joined the cast as new characters for season 2—Scott Wilson as Hershel Greene, Lauren Cohan as his daughter Maggie Greene, Pruitt Taylor Vince as Hershel's ranch hand, Otis, and Michael Zegen as Randall.\nA preview of season 2 was shown during the fourth season premiere of Breaking Bad on July 17, 2011 and a full length trailer was released to promote season 2 at San Diego Comic-Con on July 22, 2011.\nIn July 2011, Deadline Hollywood reported that Darabont stepped down from his position as showrunner for the series, amidst rumors that he was unable to adjust to the schedule of running a television series. Executive producer Glen Mazzara succeeded Darabont as showrunner for the series. Darabont's sudden departure further sparked controversy in August when The Hollywood Reporter broke a story revealing that Darabont had in fact been fired due to issues of the show's reduced budget and a strained relationship with AMC executives.\nThe premiere aired in an extended 90-minute time slot, similar to the pilot episode. After the first seven episodes aired, the series went on a hiatus and returned on February 12, 2012, with the final six episodes of the season airing until its conclusion on March 18, 2012.\nWebisodes\nTorn Apart, a six-part web series, premiered on October 3, 2011 on AMC's official website. The web series is directed by special effects makeup artist and co-executive producer Greg Nicotero and tells the origin story of Hannah, also known as \"Bicycle Girl\", the walker whom Rick Grimes mercy killed in the pilot episode.\nTalking Dead\nFollowing the encore presentation of the second season premiere on October 16, 2011, a live after-show titled Talking Dead, hosted by Chris Hardwick, premiered. The series airs after encore presentations of The Walking Dead on Sunday nights. It features host Chris Hardwick discussing the latest episode with fans, actors, and producers of the show.\nCast\n, Sophia, Carol, Lori, Carl, T-Dog, Glenn, Andrea, Dale, Daryl, and Shane]]\nMain cast\nThe second season features eight actors receiving opening credits billing, all returning from the first season; seven are listed as main cast members in the first season, while Norman Reedus and Melissa McBride were promoted from recurring status.

On Metacritic, the season holds a score of 80 out of 100, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews, based on 22 critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the season holds an 80% with an average rating of 8.05 out of 10, based on 24 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: \"The second season of The Walking Dead fleshes out the characters while maintaining the grueling tension and gore that made the show a hit.\" Linda Stasi of the New York Post wrote: \"You'll be happy to know that at least as far as the first two episodes go ... the show is better than ever – which would have seemed impossible.\" Robert Bianco of USA Today also praised the direction in which the second season was heading stating that the show delivers \"edge-of-your-chair tension\" and also noting that \"what separates this fine series from similar shows is the honesty of its human interactions\".\nConversely, some critics were less enthused midway through the second season, including Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly who described the season as \"a nighttime soap with occasional appearances by deceased but moving, flesh-rotting, flesh-eating cameo monsters\" adding that it \"had not been dramatic enough\" or had a \"tendency ... to botch truly dramatic situations\". Nate Rawlings of Time magazine criticized the season's pacing, writing: \"The first half of this season has been brutally slow.\" Following the season's finale, Scott Wampler of Collider described the second half of the season as \"far more intense, more interesting, better written\" despite \"a helluva lot of water-treading\" in the first half. Kevin Yeoman of Screen Rant further emphasized this point, writing: \"It was with the last half of season 2 – arguably the last four episodes – where the writers succeeded in unshackling themselves from the intermittent monotony brought about by the serial nature of the show.\"\n|90|67|79|50|71|75|93|67|75|85|62|100|92}}\nAccolades\nThe second season of The Walking Dead received three nominations for the 64th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, winning Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup for a Series, Miniseries, Movie, or Special (for the episode \"What Lies Ahead\"), and received nominations for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series and Outstanding Special Visual Effects (both for the episode \"Beside the Dying Fire\").\nThe season also won Best Television Presentation, for the second consecutive year, at the 38th Saturn Awards, while Norman Reedus was nominated for Best Supporting Actor on Television.
