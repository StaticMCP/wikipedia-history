Hugh Weston was his great-uncle. Edward matriculated at Lincoln College on 20 March 1579. Afterwards he was put under the tuition of John Case.\nAfter he had spent at least five years at Oxford, his parents, who were Catholics, took him from the university and sent him to France, where for a short time he settled in the English College at Reims. He was sent on 8 March 1585 to the English College, Rome, where he spent six years in studying philosophy and theology, and was ordained priest. He was created D.D. by the university of Monreale. Then he returned to Reims, where, on 3 November 1592, he began a course of lectures on cases of conscience. In 1593 the college moved to Douai, where Weston lectured in divinity for about ten years. Later he went on mission in England, returning to Douai on 23 September 1612.\nHe maintained a correspondence with Cardinal Robert Bellarmine, who held similar political views. He was dismissed from Douai in 1617 by Matthew Kellison. Later he was made canon of the collegiate church of St. Mary, Bruges, where, according to Hippolyte-Romain-Joseph Duthillœul, he died in 1635.\nWorks\nHis works are:\n* ‘De triplici Hominis Officio, ex notione ipsius Naturali, Morali, ac Theologica; Institutiones orthodoxæ, contra Atheos, Politicos, Sectarios,’ Antwerp, 1602.\n* ‘Juris Pontificii Sanctuarium.
