M. Elliott for the loss of three games. \"The winner was much the more versatile player, was quicker in court, placed the more skilfully, and seldom chased a hopeless return.\" He reached the quarterfinals of Wimbledon (beating Max Decugis before losing to Jacques Brugnon) and the final of Monte Carlo in 1926. Kingsley won the Welsh Championships in 1929 beating William Powell in the final.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
