No. 130. Since the death of Bhagat Puran Singh in 1992, it is headed by Dr. Inderjit Kaur who is a physician by training and also runs a private maternity clinic in Sangrur, Punjab.\nServices\nAlmshouse\nPingalwara operates a house for destitutes in Amritsar in northern Indian state of Punjab. It is housed in a three-storey building near the main Amritsar bus stand on the National Highway no. 1, also known as G.T. Road. In this house all the handicapped/diseased people are provided such a shelter that is more like a home. The workers treat all like gifted rather than destitutes. Under the name of this building, there are many other places working selflessly for the same cause that are run by the main organisation. This remarkable institution is the real example of selfless good deeds. Children, widows and old people are able to find that little feeling of love at the most unbearable movements of their lives. The rising number of volunteers show that the people of Amritsar are controlled by the graciousness of the heart.\nCurrently Pingalwara has facilities for 1080 patients who are fed, housed and looked after thanks to generous support of various philanthropists. The unclaimed bodies of the deceased are donated to Government Medical College, Amritsar for research and teaching purposes.\nThe main branch houses the Administrative Complex, A Female ward, Children's ward, Rehabilitation Centre, Printing Press, Dispensary, Medical Lab, Dental Centre and the Common Kitchen.\nEnvironmentalism\nPingalwara is also involved environmental efforts.\nSee also\n* Bhagat Puran Singh\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.pingalwara.org/ Pingalwara Web site]"
