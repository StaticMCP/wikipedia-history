It took no part in natural disaster operations other than operations following Cyclone Althea in December 1971.  In November 1973, a tornado caused considerable damage in the Brisbane area and the QCDO was activated to assist in disaster relief. The QCDO saw a much larger involvement in natural disasters during the 1974 Brisbane flood.\nIn 1975, the State Government introduced the [https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/repealed/current/act-1975-040 State Counter-Disaster Organisation Act 1975], which was proclaimed on 11 December 1975. The Act established two organisations, the State Counter-Disaster Organisation (SCDO), and the State Emergency Service (SES).\nIn accordance with section 14 of the Act, the SES was established because there was a need for a service that was capable of dealing with natural disasters, separate to a civil defence role.\n; 2000s\nDuring 2002–03 the Department of Emergency Services undertook a comprehensive review of the State Counter-Disaster Organisation Act 1975 in consultation with a wide range of stakeholders. The review resulted in the development of the Disaster Management Act 2003, which commenced by proclamation on 31 March 2004.  Following legislation updates on 21 May 2014 the SES was now established under the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services Act 1990.\nThe Act maintained many elements of the existing system established under the State Counter-Disaster Organisation Act, while adding contemporary elements such as a focus on comprehensive disaster management, which includes disaster mitigation, prevention, preparedness, response and recovery.\n; 2010s\nIn 2011, the SES was a recipient of the Queensland Greats Awards.\n; 2020s\nIn October 2022, following a review by State Disaster Coordinator Steve Gollschewski, it was announced the QFES would be dissolved in June 2024, resulting in the largest reform of emergency services in Queensland since 1990. The Queensland Fire and Rescue Service along with the Rural Fire Service would form the Queensland Fire Department, with a new central headquarters. On Monday 3 June 2024 the SES was transitioned to the Queensland Police Service, and along with a newly created Marine Rescue Queensland (MRQ), were made part of the Queensland emergency services; in accordance with the State Emergency Service Act 2024 and Marine Rescue Queensland Act 2024 respectively.\nOn 25 September 2024, the organisation moved from its headquarters at Kedron to a new headquarters at 1231 Sandgate Road, Nundah, co-sharing with Marine Rescue Queensland.\nRole\nThe SES is a volunteer-based community-located emergency support service, providing emergency and rescue services in times of natural disasters, and other emergencies. The main roles are preparing for, and responding to different type of emergencies and disasters from a local level to a national disaster much like the 2010–2011 Queensland floods and Cyclone Yasi.\nUnits are established at local government level, to provide emergency support functions to local communities.  These units have separate groups established, depending on population and geographical needs. At present, there are 337 SES groups.  The SES is designed to empower people to help themselves and others in their community in times of emergency and disaster.  The basic concept is one of self-help and mutual assistance within each community.\nThe SES are trained and equipped to deal with emergencies like:\n*Cyclones and storms\n*Floods\n*Urban search and rescue\n*Emergency traffic management\n*Vertical rescue\n*Road crash rescue\n*Searches for missing persons/land searches\n*Incident management\n*Community education\n*Agency support\nLeadership\nThe following list chronologically records those who have held the post of SES Chief Officer.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
