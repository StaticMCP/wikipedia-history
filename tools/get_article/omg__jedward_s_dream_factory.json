For its third series, following the departure of Jedward, the series was relaunched as 'Una's Dream Ticket', now hosted by The Saturdays member Una Healy.\nIn each episode, the hosts helped to fulfil the wishes of children who had written in to the show, as their \"Dream Tickets\" (Golden Tickets based on those from Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). The wishes involve such activities as meeting players from Manchester United, swimming with a dolphin, interviewing TV presenter Ryan Tubridy, meeting pop group The Saturdays and reading the television news, as well as wishes involving Jedward themselves. Every episode begins with a musical performance from Jedward.\nThe first series was nominated for best Children's/Youth Programme in the 2012 Irish Film & Television Academy Awards and won best Online PR Campaign in the 2012 Bord Gáis Energy Social Media Awards.
