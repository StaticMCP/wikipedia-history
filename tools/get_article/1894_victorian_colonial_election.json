All 95 seats in the Legislative Assembly were up for election, though 16 were uncontested.\nBackground\nThe Electoral Act Amendment Act of 1888 had increased the number seats in the Legislative Assembly from 86 to 95, and the number of electoral districts from 55 to 84 (73 single-member electorates, 11 two-member electorates). Plural voting was permitted for people who had property in more than one electorate.\nThe Liberals were split between Oppositionists, led by George Turner, and Ministerialists, led by Conservative Premier James Patterson.\nEnrolments in most seats was lower than at the 1892 election, as a result of the Purification of the Rolls Act of 1891. It had the effect of disenfranchising large numbers of\nvoters, mostly the working class, who had changed their residence in the year before the election.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; margin-bottom:0\"\n|+ Legislative Assembly (FPTP)\n! style=\"width:10px;\" colspan=3 | Party\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Votes\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| %\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Swing\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Seats\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Change\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"2\"| Liberal Oppositionists\n| style=\"width:70px;\"| 75,404\n| style=\"width:40px;\"| 46.03\n| style=\"width:45px;\"|\n| style=\"width:40px;\"| 47\n| style=\"width:55px;\"|  9\n|-\n| | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"2\"| Conservative Ministerialists\n| 44,479\n| 27.15\n|\n| 27\n|  1\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"2\"| United Labour and Liberal\n| style=\"width:70px;\"| 32,474\n| style=\"width:40px;\"| 19.82\n| style=\"width:45px;\"|\n| style=\"width:40px;\"| 18\n| style=\"width:55px;\"|  9\n|-\n| | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"2\"| Liberal Ministerialists\n| 11,448\n| 6.99\n|\n| 3\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\"| &nbsp;Formal votes\n| 163,805\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\"| &nbsp;Informal votes\n| 754\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\"| &nbsp;Total\n| 164,559\n|\n|\n| 95\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\"| &nbsp;Registered voters / turnout\n| 234,552\n| 70.85\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
