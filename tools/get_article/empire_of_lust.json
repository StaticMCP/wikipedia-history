He keeps a close eye on Yi Bang-won (Jang Hyuk), the fifth son of King Taejo (Son Byong-ho), whom he believes has ambitions of seizing the throne. Jin (Kang Ha-neul) is Kim Min-jae's son and the King's son-in-law. Due to his position as the King's son-in-law, he is unable to take part in politics and only seeks out pleasure. Yi Bang-won was instrumental in helping his father overthrow the Goryeo dynasty and found the Joseon, but was passed over when Taejo chose his successor. Meanwhile, Kim Min-jae falls in love for the first time with a gisaeng named Ka-hee (Kang Han-na), whom he takes as his concubine, not realizing that she aims to carry out a vendetta against him.\nCast\n*Shin Ha-kyun as Kim Min-jae\n**Sung Yoo-bin as young Kim Min-jae\n*Jang Hyuk as Yi Bang-won, Grand Prince Jeongan\n*Kang Han-na as Ka-hee\n*Kang Ha-neul as Kim Jin (Kim Min-jae's son)\n*Son Byong-ho as King Taejo\n*Lee Jae-yong as Jeong Do-jeon\n*Choi Moo-sung as\n*Kang Kyung-hun as Lady Jeong (Kim Min-jae's wife)\n*Kim Da-ye as Princess Gyeongsun (Kim Jin's wife)\n*Kim Gu-taek as Ha Ryun\n*Gi Ju-bong as\n*Kim Seung-gi as\n*Lee So-yoon as Sun-bun (Ka-hee's personal servant)\n*Hwang Geum-hee as Mae-hyang\n*Sa-hee as Lady Min (Yi Bang-won's wife)\n*Kim Young as Kim Min-jae's old servant\n*Moon Young-dong as\n*Yang Young-jo as\n*Oh Ha-nee as Chwihangru gisaeng\n*Noh Haeng-ha as Chun Hyang-ru\n*Kim Wang-geun as the Head Eunuch\n*Hyun Seok-jun as the Crown Prince\n*Jo Hee-bong as Hwajeon shop owner (cameo)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*"
