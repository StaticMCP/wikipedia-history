Broad's batting style is unknown, though it is known he played as a wicket-keeper. He was born at Nelson, New Zealand.\nBroad was educated at Nelson College from 1886 to 1892. He made a single first-class appearance for Nelson against Wellington at Trafalgar Park in December 1891. Broad ended Nelson's first-innings of 106 all out unbeaten on 0, while in Wellington's first-innings of 128 all out he took three catches. In Nelson's second-innings of 111 all out, he scored 13 runs before he was dismissed by William Ogier. In Wellington's one wicket victory, he also claimed a single catch in their second-innings chase.\nHe was struck by a train while riding his motor cycle across a level crossing at Marton, Manawatu, on 16 April 1913, and died of his injuries at Marton the next day. He left a widow, four sons and a daughter.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
