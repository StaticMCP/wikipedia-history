      "text": "# Timeline of Christianity\n\nThe purpose of this timeline is to give a detailed historical account of the real historical events of Christianity from the beginning of the current era  (CE / AD) to the present. A.D. is the abbreviation of the Latin term \"anno Domini\" which translates to \"the year of our Lord\".  Among English speakers, A.D. was used with the words spelled out in Latin or in English on official documents and private letters before the 21st century. Question marks ('?') below on dates indicate approximate dates.  Christian events include miracles and fufilled Hebrew prophecies.\nThe year one is the first year in the Christian calendar (there is no year zero), which is the calendar presently used (in unison with the Gregorian calendar) almost everywhere in the world. Traditionally, this was held to be the year Jesus was born; however, most modern scholars argue for an earlier or later date, the most agreed upon being between 6 BC and 4 BC.\nBackground historical timeline\n*6 AD Herod Archelaus deposed by Augustus; Samaria, Judea and Idumea annexed as Iudaea Province under direct Roman administration, capital at Caesarea. Quirinius became Legate (Governor) of Syria, conducted Census of Quirinius, opposed by Zealots (, )\n*7–26 Brief period of peace, relatively free of revolt and bloodshed in Judea and Galilee\n*9 Pharisee leader Hillel the Elder dies, temporary rise of Shammai\n*14–37 Tiberius, Roman Emperor\n*18–36 Caiaphas, appointed High Priest of Herod's Temple by Prefect Valerius Gratus, deposed by Syrian Legate Lucius Vitellius\n*19 Jews, Jewish proselytes, astrologers, expelled from RomeSuetonius, Lives of the Twelve Caesars, [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#36 Tiberius 36];\n*[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12816-rome#anchor2 Jewish Encyclopedia: Rome: Expelled Under Tiberius]: \"The Jewish deputation which petitioned for the deposition of the royal house of the Idumeans was joined by 8,000 Jewish residents of Rome. Several Romans adopted Jewish customs, and some, as the rhetor Cilicius of Kalakte, a friend of Dionysius of Halicarnassus, even embraced Judaism (Müller, \"Fragmenta Historicorum Græcorum\", iii. 331). The reign of Tiberius (until the removal of his minister Sejanus) was fraught with misfortune for the Jews. When the cult of Isis was driven out of Rome (19 CE.) the Jews also were expelled, because a Roman lady who inclined toward Judaism had been deceived by Jewish swindlers. The synagogues were closed, the vessels burned, and 4,000 Jewish youths were sent upon military service to Sardinia. After the death of Sejanus (31) the emperor allowed the Jews to return.\";\n*Haim Hillel Ben-Sasson (and Abraham Malamat contributor) [https://books.google.com/books?id=2kSovzudhFUC&q=Explicit+evidence&pg=PA288 A History of the Jewish People], Harvard University Press, 1976, , page 288 quote: \"Explicit evidence of a systematic attempt to propagate the Jewish faith in the city of Rome is found as early as 139 BCE. With the increase of the Jewish population of Rome, the Jews intensified their efforts to make converts among the Romans. Although the activity of Jewish missionaries in Roman society caused Tiberius to expel them from that city in 19 CE, they soon returned, and Jewish religious propaganda was resumed and maintained even after the destruction of the Temple. Tacitus mentions it regretfully ([https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Tacitus/Histories/5A*.html Histories 5.5]), and Juvenal, in his Fourteenth Satire (11. 96ff.), describes how Roman families 'degenerated' into Judaism: the fathers permitted themselves to adopt some of its customs and the sons became Jews in every respect.\" ...

Non-Catholic historians and the Catholic Church teaches that the gospel accounts depict historic events.
