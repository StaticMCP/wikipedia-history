This is the first album since 1999's Tuonela to feature original bassist Olli-Pekka Laine who rejoined the band in 2017, making this the first time since 1994's Tales from the Thousand Lakes that all four original band members played together on an album. The album was produced by Jens Bogren, who was described as \"a true brother in spirit.\"\nCritical reception\nQueen of Time received positive reviews upon release.\nBlabbermouth praised the use of a variety of instruments such as flutes, saxophone, reeds, or xylophones, calling the compositions \"long, layered and resonant\".\nLouder wrote: \"Amorphis are incredible songwriters; everything from stirring opener The Bee through to lavish, dramatic closer Pyres On The Coast boasts at least one life-affirming hook, and vocalist Tomi Joutsen has never sounded more commanding.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nAmorphis\n* Tomi Joutsen – vocals\n* Esa Holopainen – lead guitar\n* Tomi Koivusaari – rhythm guitar\n* Olli-Pekka Laine – bass\n* Santeri Kallio – keyboards, engineering (church organ)\n* Jan Rechberger – drums\nMiscellaneous staff\n* Chrigel Glanzmann – tin whistle, low whistle\n* Noa Gruman – arrangements (choirs), conductor\n* Albert Kuvezin – laryngeal singing on \"The Bee\"\n* Akira Takasaki – guitar solo on \"Honeyflow\" (bonus track)\n* Jørgen Munkeby – saxophone on \"Daughter of Hate\"\n* Linus Corneliusson – mixing assistance\n* Valnoir Mortasonge – artwork\nAdditional vocalists\n* Anneke van Giersbergen – female vocals on \"Amongst Stars\"\n* Noa Gruman – female vocals (additional) (tracks 1, 2, 4)\n* Hellscore Choir – choir vocals (tracks 2, 3, 5, 6, 8)\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak position\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Spanish Albums (PROMUSICAE)\n| 98\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Swedish Albums (Sverigetopplistan)\n| 45\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
