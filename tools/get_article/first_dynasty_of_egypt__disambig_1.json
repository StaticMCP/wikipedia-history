It immediately follows the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, by Menes, or Narmer, and marks the beginning of the Early Dynastic Period, when power was centered at Thinis.\nThe date of this period is subject to scholarly debate about the Egyptian chronology. It falls within the early Bronze Age and is variously estimated to have begun anywhere between the 34th and the 30th centuriesBC. In a 2013 study based on radiocarbon dates, the accession of Hor-Aha, the second king of the First Dynasty, was placed between 3111 and 3045 BC with 68% confidence, and between 3218 and 3035 with 95% confidence. The same study placed the accession of Den, the sixth king of the dynasty, between 2928 and 2911 BC with 68% confidence, although a 2023 radiocarbon analysis placed Den's accession potentially earlier, between 3011 and 2921, within a broader window of 3104 to 2913.\nThe dynasty\nInformation about this dynasty is derived from a few monuments and other objects bearing royal names, the most important being the Narmer Palette and Narmer Macehead, as well as Den and Qa'a king lists. No detailed records of the first two dynasties have survived, except for the terse lists on the Palermo Stone. The account in Manetho's Aegyptiaca contradicts both the archeological evidence and the other historical records: Manetho names nine rulers of the First Dynasty, only one of whose names matches the other sources, and offers information for only four of them. Egyptian hieroglyphs were fully developed by then, and their shapes would be used with little change for more than three thousand years.\nAlena Buis noted:  }}\nA study on First Dynasty crania from the royal tombs in Abydos generally demonstrated greater affinity with Kerma Kushites, and Upper Nile Valley groups. Moreover, the analysis too found clear change from earlier craniometric trends, as \"lower Egyptian, Maghrebian, and European patterns are observed also, thus making for great diversity\". The gene flow and movement of northern officials to the important southern city may explain the findings.\nFile:Alabaster vessels from a 1st Dynasty cemetery, Abu Roach.

Various ethnic types seems to be represented: Asiatic-looking foreigners with full beards and straight hair, possibly alluding to vanquished people from the eastern parts of the Nile delta, or naked individuals with curly hair, possibly Libyan tribes from the western Nile delta. Depiction of West-Asiatic-looking foreigners were found in the tomb of Pharaoh Qa'a, and the Narmer Palette also exhibits similar scenes of conquest over alien people.\nFile:EB1911 Egypt - Early Art - King Narmer, Slate Palette.jpg|The Narmer Palette, Pharaoh Narmer subduing an enemy\nFile:Captive with feather in the hair.

First Dynasty, 2960–2770, Tomb of Menes B17, Abydos.\nHuman sacrifice\n]]\nHuman sacrifice was practiced as part of the funerary rituals associated with all of the pharaohs of the first dynasty.  It is clearly demonstrated as existing during this dynasty by retainers being buried near each pharaoh's tomb as well as animals sacrificed for the burial. The tomb of Djer is associated with the burials of 338 individuals.  The people and animals sacrificed, such as donkeys, were expected to assist the pharaoh in the afterlife. For unknown reasons, this practice ended with the conclusion of the dynasty.\nAccording to American historian and linguist, Christopher Ehret, the ritual practice of retainer sacrifice originated from the southern region in the Middle Nile. Ehret also stated that this cultural practice was shared with the Kerma kingdom of the Upper Nubian Nile region.\nRulers\nKnown rulers in the history of Egypt for the First Dynasty are as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! width=\"15%\" | Name\n! width=\"15%\" | Image\n! width=\"35%\" | Comments\n! width=\"20%\" | Start of Reign\n!Length of Reign\n! width=\"15%\" | Family\n|-\n| Narmer/ Menes\n|\n| Believed to be the same person as Menes and to have unified Upper and Lower Egypt.
