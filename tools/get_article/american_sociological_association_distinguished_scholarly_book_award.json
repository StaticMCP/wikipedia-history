Since then, this award has gone through a number of changes, and is now known as the Distinguished Scholarly Book Award.\nAs it is currently named, the Distinguished Scholarly Book Award of the ASA was first given in 1986, and is presented at the ASA Annual Meeting every August. It is an ASA Major Award, given at association-level, in contrast to the various section-level ASA awards.\nMembers of the ASA make nominations for the prize. The Distinguished Scholarly Book Award selection committee, whose members serve two-year terms, selects award recipients.\nList of recipients\n*2020 - Tey Meadow, Trans Kids: Being Gendered in the Twenty-First Century\n*2020 - Hector Carrillo, Pathways of Desire: The Sexual Migration of Mexican Gay Men Honorable Mention: Anju Mary Paul Multinational Maids: Stepwise Migration in a Global Labor Market\n*2019 - Nicole Gonzalez Van Cleve, ''Crook County: Racism and Injustice in America's Largest Criminal Court (Stanford University Press, 2016)\n*2018 - Lauren B.
