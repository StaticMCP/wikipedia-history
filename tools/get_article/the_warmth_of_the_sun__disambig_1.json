It was released on their 1964 album Shut Down Volume 2 and as the B-side of the \"Dance, Dance, Dance\" single, which charted at No. 8 in the U.S. and No. 24 in the UK. Brian Wilson produced the song, and the rest of the album.\nComposition\nWilson and Love began composing the song on November 22, 1963, the day of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, although the two co-authors give different accounts of the timing and whether it was begun before or after the killing. The subsequent recording of the song was informed by the emotional shock felt by its authors in the wake of Kennedy's death.\nAccording to Mike Love:\n}}\nIn his 2016 autobiography, I Am Brian Wilson, Wilson recalled that the song was written the day of the assassination, and in response to it:\n}}\nCritical response\nCash Box described it as \"an ultra-lovely, lazy paced ballad that the boys deliver in oh-so-smooth, ear-arresting fashion.\"  Reviewing the song for AllMusic, Donald A. Guarisco stated, \"The sublime balance of lush vocals and sensitive songwriting made 'The Warmth of the Sun' one of the Beach Boys' finest and most moving ballads.\"  Brian Wilson pioneered the use of adventurous chord changes in pop—\"The Warmth of the Sun\"'s transitions from C to A-minor to E-flat, were unheard of in 1964.\nPersonnel\nCredits from Craig Slowinski.\nThe Beach Boys\n* Al Jardine – backing vocals, rhythm guitar\n* Mike Love – backing vocals\n* Brian Wilson – lead and backing vocals, piano\n* Carl Wilson – backing vocals, lead guitar (with tremolo)\n* Dennis Wilson – backing vocals, drums\nAdditional musicians\n* Ray Pohlman – bass guitar\n* Hal Blaine – bell tree, clinking percussion\n* Steve Douglas – tenor saxophone\n* Jay Migliori – baritone saxophone\nAppearances\nThe song was featured on the soundtrack of the film Good Morning, Vietnam (1987).\nWilson also rerecorded the song for his second solo album, ''I Just Wasn't Made for These Times (1995).\nAdditionally, Willie Nelson performed a version of the song with lead vocals on Stars and Stripes Vol. 1 (1996).\nThe song also appears on the 2002 compilation album Classics Selected by Brian Wilson'', a collection of Wilson's personal favorite Beach Boys songs at the time.\nReferences"
