His first book, Friends and Strangers: The Making of a Creole Culture in Colonial Pennsylvania, looks at Pennsylvania's turbulent early history as an example of the creolization process through which American colonists changed Old World cultural habits into New World cultural identities. This book represents one of the first attempts to use the creolization paradigm to analyze the development of the Anglo-American colonies. His published essays similarly draw upon concepts like performance theory (see performance studies) and speech act theory popularized in the social sciences and cultural studies.\nSmolenski is currently an associate professor of history at the University of California, Davis.\nWorks include\n*Friends and Strangers: The Making of a Creole Culture in Colonial Pennsylvania.
