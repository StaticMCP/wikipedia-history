Both schools have academic reputations that have labeled them as Public Ivies. Both schools are also colonial colleges, having been founded before the United States became independent in 1776; W&M was founded in 1693 and UD's predecessor school was founded in 1743.\nThe football series began in 1915 and has been played a total of 44 times as of 2022.\nOn November 27, 2023, it was announced that the Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens football program had accepted an invitation to move up to the FBS Subdivision and would join Conference USA prior to the 2025 football season. There are no future meetings scheduled.\nHistory\nThe game has been a conference matchup in CAA Football and its two direct predecessors of the Atlantic 10 Conference and Yankee Conference since W&M joined the Yankee Conference in 1993. During CAA Football's divisional eras (2007–2009, plus the COVID-disrupted 2020–21 season), both teams played in the league's South Division. During this period, the two teams have combined for one National Championship (Delaware in 2003), two shared Conference Championships (2004 and 2010) and seven standalone conference titles (Delaware in 1995, 2000, 2003, and 2010 and William & Mary in 1996 and 2001). With the exception of the 1915 game held at Frazer Field, all of Delaware's home games have been hosted at Delaware Stadium in Newark, Delaware. William & Mary has hosted its contests at Zable Stadium in Williamsburg, Virginia; as of 2019, no games have been played on a neutral field.\nGame results\n| team2 = William & Mary\n| team2style =\n| November 25, 1915 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 93 | William & Mary | 0\n| November 10, 1923 | Williamsburg, VA | William & Mary | 14 | Delaware | 0\n| October 9, 1976 | Williamsburg, VA | Delaware | 15 | William & Mary | 13\n| October 27, 1979 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 40 | William & Mary | 0\n| October 25, 1980 | Williamsburg, VA | Delaware | 7 | William & Mary | 3\n| October 30, 1982 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 62 | William & Mary | 21\n| September 17, 1983 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 30 | William & Mary | 13\n| September 15, 1984 | Newark, DE | William & Mary | 23 | Delaware | 21\n| September 21, 1985 | Williamsburg, VA | William & Mary | 17 | Delaware | 16\n| October 18, 1986 | Newark, DE | William & Mary | 24 | Delaware | 18\n|  | Williamsburg, VA | Delaware | 51 | William & Mary | 17\n| October 17, 1987 | Williamsburg, VA | Delaware | 38 | William & Mary | 14\n| October 8, 1988 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 38 | William & Mary | 35\n| October 7, 1989 | Williamsburg, VA | William & Mary | 27 | Delaware | 24\n| October 6, 1990 | Newark, DE | William & Mary | 22 | Delaware | 12\n| September 14, 1991 | Williamsburg, VA | Delaware | 28 | William & Mary | 21\n| September 11, 1993 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 42 | William & Mary | 35\n| September 10, 1994 | Williamsburg, VA | William & Mary | 31 | Delaware | 7\n| November 4, 1995 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 42 | William & Mary | 35\n| November 2, 1996 | Williamsburg, VA | William & Mary | 10 | Delaware | 7 (OT)\n| November 1, 1997 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 14 | William & Mary | 0\n| October 10, 1998 | Williamsburg, VA | William & Mary | 52 | Delaware | 45\n| September 2, 1999 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 34 | William & Mary | 27 (2OT)\n| October 14, 2000 | Williamsburg, VA  | Delaware | 28 | William & Mary | 17\n| October 20, 2001 | Newark, DE | William & Mary | 21 | Delaware | 17\n| September 28, 2002 | Williamsburg, VA | William & Mary | 45 | Delaware | 42\n| October 4, 2003 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 41 | William & Mary | 27\n| October 23, 2004 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 31 | William & Mary | 28\n|  | Williamsburg, VA | William & Mary | 44 | Delaware | 38 (OT)\n| November 12, 2005 | Williamsburg, VA  | Delaware | 22 | William & Mary | 21\n| November 11, 2006 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 28 | William & Mary | 14\n| August 30, 2007 | Williamsburg, VA | Delaware | 49 | William & Mary | 31\n| October 18, 2008 | Newark, DE | William & Mary | 27 | Delaware | 3\n| September 26, 2009 | Williamsburg, VA | William & Mary | 30 | Delaware | 20\n| October 23, 2010 | Williamsburg, VA | William & Mary | 17 | Delaware | 16\n| October 8, 2011 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 21 | William & Mary | 0\n| September 22, 2012 | Williamsburg, VA | Delaware | 51 | William & Mary | 21\n| November 9, 2013 | Newark, DE | William & Mary | 24 | Delaware | 10\n| October 25, 2014 | Williamsburg, VA | William & Mary | 31 | Delaware | 17\n| October 3, 2015 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 24 | William & Mary | 23\n| October 15, 2016 | Williamsburg, VA | William & Mary | 24 | Delaware | 17\n| October 14, 2017 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 17 | William & Mary | 0\n| November 6, 2021 | Newark, DE | Delaware | 24 | William & Mary | 3\n| October 8, 2022 | Williamsburg, VA | William & Mary | 27 | Delaware | 21\n}}\nSee also\n* List of NCAA college football rivalry games\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.dailypress.com/2002/09/25/hens-tribe-rivalry-provides-its-thrills/ Hens-Tribe Rivalry Provides Its Thrills] .
