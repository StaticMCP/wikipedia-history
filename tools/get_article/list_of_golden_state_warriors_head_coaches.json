The franchise had been known as the Philadelphia Warriors and the San Francisco Warriors, due to it previously being based in or near those cities. The team is a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Warriors initially joined the Basketball Association of America (BAA) as the Philadelphia Warriors in 1946, and won the first BAA championship title in the same year under coach Eddie Gottlieb. The Warriors later joined the NBA at its foundation in 1949. The Warriors' record was 26–42 in their first NBA season and lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Syracuse Nationals. Franklin Mieuli and the Diners Club put together a group of 40 local investors to move the Warriors to San Francisco before the 1962–63 NBA season, with Mieuli eventually buying all the shares of the franchise to keep the team from collapsing and to keep it in the area. The team became the Golden State Warriors and moved to Oakland before the 1971–72 NBA season.\nThere have been 25&nbsp;head coaches for the Warriors franchise. The franchise won their first NBA championship as the Philadelphia Warriors in the 1956 NBA Finals, and were coached by George Senesky. Their second title was won as the Golden State Warriors in 1975, under coach Al Attles, who played with and coached the Warriors for 25 seasons. He was also the franchise's all-time leader in regular season games coached and wins until March 2025 when his record was surpassed by Steve Kerr, who coached the Warriors to four championships in , ,  and . Kerr also leads the franchise in winning percentage for games coached, as well as playoff games coached and wins.\nFrank McGuire is one of the members of the franchise that has been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame as coaches, while being the only one to do so that has spent his whole career with the franchise. Alex Hannum, Don Nelson, and Bill Sharman are the only other members of the franchise that have been inducted into the Hall of Fame. Hannum,  Nelson, and Kerr have both received the NBA Coach of the Year award once. Nelson has also been named one of the top 10 coaches in NBA history. Four former players for the Warriors, Attles, Johnston, George Lee, and Senesky went on to coach for the franchise.\nKey\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|GC\n|Games coached\n|-\n|W\n|Wins\n|-\n|L\n|Losses\n|-\n|Win%\n|Winning percentage\n|-\n|#\n|Number of coaches\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD; width:6em\"|\n|Elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#ddffdd; width:6em\"|*\n|Spent entire NBA head coaching career with the Warriors\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:silver; width:6em\"|*\n|Elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coachand spent entire NBA head coaching career with the Warriors\n|}\nCoaches\nNote: Statistics are correct through the end of the .\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"| #\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Name\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Term\n!
