It is located a short distance downstream of and southwest from the outlet of Berg Lake.\nStature\nThe falls stand 142 feet high, 5300&nbsp;ft above sea level.  After dropping over the edge of the cliff the water strikes a ledge just under halfway down, this causes the formation of a roostertail which produces a large amount of spray.\nAccess\nTo get to the falls, you hike along the Berg Lake trail for approximately 15&nbsp;km, during which time you will gain about 2500 feet of elevation. A more complete description of the hike can be found in the Berg Lake article.\nSee also\n*Mount Robson Provincial Park\n*Berg Lake\n*List of waterfalls\n*List of waterfalls of Canada\n*List of waterfalls in British Columbia\nReferences\nExternal links"
