Its motto is \"Ready and Able\", with the Cougar adopted as the squadron's motif.\nUnit history\nFormed initially on 16 September 1992 at Sembawang Air Base, the 126 Squadron consisted of fourteen newly purchased Aérospatiale AS532UL Cougar medium lift helicopters, which were an upgraded version of the Super Puma helicopters then used by its sister squadron&nbsp;– 125 SQN.\nIn 1998, the squadron was temporarily deployed at Oakey Airbase, for operators to train with the Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma in a large training airspace.\nIn 2023, a 25th-anniversary celebration was held at Oakey, which involved several high ranking dignitaries visiting and the unveiling of a commemorative tail design painted on a RSAF Chinook.\nAfter the CH-47F attained full operational capability for the RSAF, the squadron transitioned to a mix of CH-47SDs and CH-47Fs.\nRoles and Missions\nIn May 1993, the RSAF deployed four Super Puma helicopters and 65 personnel to assist with the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia in conducting the 1993 Cambodian general election, where they ferried election officials and conducted aerial policing. This was the RSAF's first every UN peacekeeping mission.\nAircraft operated\n#14× AS532UL Cougars (1996–2023)\n#??x CH-47SD Chinooks (2023–present)\n#??x CH-47F Chinooks (2023–present)\nPhoto gallery\nFile:RSAF Aerospatiale AS-332M1 Super Puma Vabre.jpg|126 Sqn's AS532UL Cougar at Avalon Airport, 2009.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/atozlistings/air_force/assets/airbases_and_squadrons/Sembawang_Air_Base.html RSAF web page on 126 Sqn & Sembawang Air Base(SBAB)]"
