These fields include astrophysics, which studies how planets and stars form, interact and die; particle physics, which has revealed how matter behaves at the smallest scales; evolutionary biology, which studies how life evolves over time; plate tectonics, which shows how continents shift over millennia; and sociology, which examines how human societies and cultures evolve.\nThese timelines begin at the start of the 4th millennium in 3001 CE, and continue until the furthest and most remote reaches of future time. They include alternative future events that address unresolved scientific questions, such as whether humans will become extinct, whether the Earth survives when the Sun expands to become a red giant and whether proton decay will be the eventual end of all matter in the universe.\nEarth, the Solar System, and the universe\nAll projections of the future of Earth, the Solar System and the universe must account for the second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy, or a loss of the energy available to do work, must rise over time. Stars will eventually exhaust their supply of hydrogen fuel via fusion and burn out. The Sun will likely expand sufficiently to overwhelm most of the inner planets (Mercury, Venus, and possibly Earth) but not the giant planets, including Jupiter and Saturn. Afterwards, the Sun will be reduced to the size of a white dwarf, and the outer planets and their moons will continue to orbit this diminutive solar remnant. This future situation may be similar to the white dwarf star MOA-2010-BLG-477L and the Jupiter-sized exoplanet orbiting it.\nLong after the death of the Solar System, physicists expect that matter itself will eventually disintegrate under the influence of radioactive decay, as even the most stable materials break apart into subatomic particles. Current data suggest that the universe has a flat geometry (or very close to flat) and will therefore not collapse in on itself after a finite time. This infinite future could allow for the occurrence of massively improbable events, such as the formation of Boltzmann brains or spontaneous inflation triggering a new Big Bang.\nKeys\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background: lavender;\" |\n| Astronomy and astrophysics\n|-\n| style=\"background: #f0dc82;\" |\n| Geology and planetary science\n|-\n| style=\"background: #CEFF00;\" |\n| Biology\n|-\n| style=\"background: #FFE4E1;\" |\n| Particle physics\n|-\n|\n| Technology and culture\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%; margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Event\n|-\n| style=\"background: lavender;\" |\n| 1,000\n| Due to the lunar tides decelerating the Earth's rotation, the average length of a solar day will be  of an SI second longer than it is today.

In this scenario, the mid-ocean ridge between South America and Africa will probably be subducted first; the Atlantic Ocean is predicted to narrow as a result of subduction beneath the Americas. The Indian Ocean is also predicted to be smaller due to northward subduction of oceanic crust into the Central Indian trench.

Four potential arrangements of this configuration have been dubbed Amasia, Novopangaea, Pangaea Proxima and Aurica. This will likely result in a glacial period, lowering sea levels and increasing oxygen levels, further lowering global temperatures.\n|-\n| style=\"background: #CEFF00;\" |\n| >&nbsp;250 million\n| The supercontinent's formation, thanks to a combination of continentality increasing distance from the ocean, an increase in volcanic activity resulting in atmospheric CO2 at double current levels, increased interspecific competition, and a 2.5&nbsp;percent increase in solar flux, is likely to trigger an extinction event comparable to the Great Dying 250 million years ago. Mammals in particular are unlikely to survive, assuming they still exist in their current forms by this point.\n|-\n| style=\"background: #f0dc82;\" |\n| 300 million\n| Due to a shift in the equatorial Hadley cells to roughly 40° north and south, the amount of arid land will increase by 25%.\n|-\n| style=\"background: #f0dc82;\" |\n| 300–600 million\n| The estimated time for Venus's mantle temperature to reach its maximum.

However, the supernova would have to be precisely oriented relative to Earth to have such effect.\n|-\n| style=\"background: lavender;\" |\n| 600 million\n| Tidal acceleration moves the Moon far enough from Earth that total solar eclipses are no longer possible.\n|-\n| style=\"background: #f0dc82;\" |\n| 500–600 million\n| The Sun's increasing luminosity begins to disrupt the carbonate–silicate cycle; higher luminosity increases weathering of surface rocks, which traps carbon dioxide in the ground as carbonate. As water evaporates from the Earth's surface, rocks harden, causing plate tectonics to slow and eventually stop once the oceans evaporate completely. With less volcanism to recycle carbon into the Earth's atmosphere, carbon dioxide levels begin to fall. By this time, carbon dioxide levels will fall to the point at which  photosynthesis is no longer possible. All plants that use  photosynthesis (roughly 99&nbsp;percent of present-day species) will die. The extinction of  plant life is likely to be a long-term decline rather than a sharp drop. It is likely that plant groups will die one by one well before the critical carbon dioxide level is reached. The first plants to disappear will be  herbaceous plants, followed by deciduous forests, evergreen broad-leaf forests, and finally evergreen conifers.\nHowever, a 2024 paper by RJ Graham et al. argues that silicate weathering is far less temperature-dependent than initially thought, and that falling carbon dioxide levels are unlikely to lead to the death of life on Earth.\n|-\n| style=\"background: #CEFF00;\" |\n| 500–800 million\n| As Earth begins to warm and carbon dioxide levels fall, plants—and, by extension, animals—could survive longer by evolving other strategies such as requiring less carbon dioxide for photosynthetic processes, becoming carnivorous, adapting to desiccation, or associating with fungi. These adaptations are likely to appear near the beginning of the moist greenhouse. The decrease in plant life will result in less oxygen in the atmosphere, allowing for more DNA-damaging ultraviolet radiation to reach the surface. The rising temperatures will increase chemical reactions in the atmosphere, further lowering oxygen levels. Plant and animal communities become increasingly sparse and isolated as the Earth becomes more barren. Flying animals would be better off because of their ability to travel large distances looking for cooler temperatures. Many animals may be driven to the poles or possibly underground. These creatures would become active during the polar night and aestivate during the polar day due to the intense heat and radiation. Much of the land would become a barren desert, and plants and animals would primarily be found in the oceans.\n|-\n| style=\"background: #f0dc82;\" |\n| 500–800 million\n| As pointed out by Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee in their book The Life and Death of Planet Earth, according to NASA Ames scientist Kevin Zahnle, this is the earliest time for plate tectonics to eventually stop, due to the gradual cooling of the Earth's core, which could potentially turn the Earth back into a water world. This would, in turn, likely cause the extinction of Earth's remaining land life.\n|-\n| style=\"background: #CEFF00;\" |\n| 800–900 million\n| Carbon dioxide levels will fall to the point at which  photosynthesis is no longer possible. Without plant life to recycle oxygen in the atmosphere, free oxygen and the ozone layer will disappear from the atmosphere allowing for intense levels of deadly UV light to reach the surface. Animals in food chains that were dependent on live plants will disappear shortly afterward. At most, animal life could survive about 3&nbsp;to 100&nbsp;million years after plant life dies out. Just like plants, the extinction of animals will likely coincide with the loss of plants. It will start with large animals, then smaller animals and flying creatures, then amphibians, followed by reptiles and, finally, invertebrates. In the book The Life and Death of Planet Earth, authors Peter D. Ward and Donald Brownlee state that some animal life may be able to survive in the oceans. Eventually, however, all multicellular life will die out. The first sea animals to go extinct will be large fish, followed by small fish and then, finally, invertebrates. The last animals to go extinct will be animals that do not depend on living plants, such as termites, or those near hydrothermal vents, such as worms of the genus Riftia. The only life left on the Earth after this will be single-celled organisms.\n|-\n| style=\"background: #f0dc82;\" |\n| 1 billion\n| 27% of the ocean's mass will have been subducted into the mantle.
