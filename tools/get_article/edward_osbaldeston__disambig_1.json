Не was hanged, drawn and quartered at York, 16 November 1594.\nLife\nEdward Osbaldeston was born about 1560 at Osbaldeston Hall near Blackburn, Lancashire. He was the son of Thomas Osbaldeston, and nephew of Edward Osbaldeston, of Osbaldeston Hall. He went to the English College of Douai, then at Reims, where he was ordained deacon in December 1583, and priest 21 September 1585.  He had said his first Mass on the feast day of St. Jerome, and in consequence had a great devotion to that saint.\nHe was sent on the English mission 27 April 1589, and was apprehended at night through the instrumentality of an Anglican priest named Thomas Clark at an inn at Tollerton, Yorkshire, upon St. Jerome's day, 30 September 1594.\nThe day following his arrest he was taken to York where he was tried at the next assizes and attained of high treason for being a priest.\nBishop Richard Challoner prints the greater part of a letter addressed by the martyr to his fellow-prisoners in York Castle,  the full text of which is still extant, and which reveals the great humility and serene trust in God with which he anticipated his death.\nEdward Osbaldeston was among the eighty-five martyrs of England and Wales beatified by Pope John Paul II on 22 November 1987.\nSee also\n* Catholic Church in the United Kingdom\n* Douai Martyrs\nReferences"
