The unit is jointly composed of members of the Dominican armed forces and the National Police.\nHistory\nCUSEP was created on June 7, 1929 by direction of then President Horacio Vásquez and was originally given the name of the Assistant Corps ().\nIn 1947, the organization was reorganized as the Corps of Military Assistants.\nIn September of 2013, the Congress of the Dominican Republic again re-organized the Corps under its current name.\nOrganization\nThe existence of certain sub-component units within CUSEP have been publicly acknowledged by the Dominican government, including the following.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Unit Identifier !! Unit Name (English) !! Unit Name (Spanish)\n|-\n| S-1 || Directorate of Human Resources || Dirección de Recursos Humanos\n|-\n| S-2 || Directorate of Intelligence || Dirección de Inteligencia\n|-\n| S-5 || Purchasing and Contracting Department  || Departamento de Compras y Contrataciones\n|}\nThe identity and purpose of units S-3 and S-4 are unclear. Additionally, there are known to be units responsible for Public Relations, Psychology, and K-9 operations.\nAuthority\nThe Corps derives its current organization, mission, and authorities from Article 56 of the Organic Law of the Armed Forces.\nEmbezzlement Accusations\nOn April 24, 2021, the Attorney General of the Dominican Republic and the Special Prosecutor’s Office for the Persecution of Administrative Corruption announced the arrest of General Adan B. Cáceres Silvestre, the chief of CUSEP from 2012 to 2020 under an anti-corruption investigation code-named Operation Coral. General Cáceres is one of 48 individuals charged with involvement in a network which allegedly abused their authority to embezzle over four billion pesos from the Dominican state.\nReferences"
