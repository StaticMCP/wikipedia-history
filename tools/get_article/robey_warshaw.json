The firm was founded in 2013 and is led by investment bankers Sir Simon Robey, Philip Apostolides, and Simon Warshaw.\nHistory\nRobey, Apostolides and Warshaw were prominent dealmakers in the City of London prior to setting up the firm. Robey was a former co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley, Warshaw was a co-head of investment banking at UBS, while Apostolides was a managing director in Morgan Stanley's financial sponsors group. In 2020, former Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne joined the firm as the first new Partner since its founding.\nAccording to The Observer, banking experts have attributed Robey Warshaw's early success to the connections of its founders and its ability to remain discreet during negotiations owing to its small size, at fewer than 20 employees.
