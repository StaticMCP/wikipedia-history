The Zulus attacked at night, and in a mutual bloodbath, the Boers lost 56 killed and 3 wounded, while the Zulus suffered 52 killed and 48 wounded. This battle was the last victory of the abaQulusi to date.\nFurther reading\n* Ian Knight, Companion to the Anglo-Zulu War, Pen and Sword military, UK, 2008\n*\nExternal links\n* Military History of South Africa [https://militaryhistorysa.wordpress.com/2017/04/07/2-the-battle-at-holkrantz-6th-may-1902/]\nReferences"
