The toys are all there, but they could do with a better box.\"\nBattlesector was included on Eurogamer's list of \"The best Warhammer 40k games to play in 2022\". PC Gamer listed the game 10th on its list of best Warhammer 40,000 games.\nSee also\n*Battlestar Galactica: Deadlock, the previous strategy game by the same developer and publisher\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://blacklab.games/games/warhammer-40000-battlesector Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector] at Black Lab Games"
