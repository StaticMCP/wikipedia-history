It was signed on 10 March 1909 in Bangkok, with ratifications exchanged in London on 9 July 1909. The treaty established the modern border between Malaysia and Thailand. Areas around modern Pattani, Narathiwat, southern Songkhla, Satun and Yala remained under Thai control, later becoming the site of the South Thailand insurgency.\nUnder the treaty, Thailand relinquished claims to Kedah (), Kelantan (, ), Perlis (, ) and Terengganu (, ), which entered the British sphere of influence as protectorates. During World War II, Thailand briefly reclaimed these territories with Japanese permission, but they were returned to British control after the defeat of the Axis powers. These four states, together with Johor, later became known as the Unfederated Malay States, eventually joining the Federation of Malaya and forming part of present-day Malaysia.\nBackground\nThe Kingdom of Siam was controlled by the monarch. Although there were many previous monarchs, those most responsible for maintaining Siam's independence begins with Rama I (r. 1782–1809). Unlike previous rulers, Rama I was a technocratic ruler who consulted with social elites on political matters and Sangha (Buddhist monks) on religious matters. His consultations with the Siamese elites became  for his successors. Rama I was succeeded by Rama II (r. 1809–1824). Rama II's greatest accomplishment was the establishment of a government of ministers. Near the end of his reign, in 1820, the British came on the scene seeking control of Penang. Rama II was followed by Rama III (r. 1824–1851). He granted concessions to the British in exchange for their support. The same would be done later with the French.\nIn 1826, in an effort to establish independence, Rama III and British officials signed the Burney Treaty. The treaty affirmed British assent that Kedah, Perlis, Terengganu and Patani were Thai provinces while Penang and Province Wellesley belonged to the British and that the Siamese would permit British trade in Kelantan and Terengganu. After Rama III's reign, a succession crisis brought Mongkut (r. 1851–1868) to power. Under Mongkut's leadership the Bowring Treaty of 1855 was signed. It provided British subjects in Siam with extraterritoriality, meaning that Britons would have British laws applied to them rather than Siamese. Mongkut constantly made concessions to the British and French to maintain independence in Siam until, in 1868, he was succeeded by Chulalongkorn, who ruled from 1868 to 1910. Chulalongkorn was a moderniser, similar to his predecessors. He abolished slavery, centralised revenues, created a national educational system, and safeguarded Siamese independence.\nTreaty\nThe Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909, signed under the leadership of Chulalongkorn, consists of eight articles. In return for the four provinces Siam ceded in the treaty, extraterritorial protections for most Asian subjects of Britain were removed, and the Siamese government received a loan at 4 percent interest from the Federated Malay States to build a railway in southern Siam.\nArticle 1\n\"The Siamese government transfers to the British government all rights of suzerainty, protection, administration and control whatsoever which they possess over the states of Kelantan, Tringganu, Kedah, Perlis, and adjacent islands.
