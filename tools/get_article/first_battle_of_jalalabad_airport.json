It was part of the Battle of Jalalabad and the greater Afghan Civil War that began after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in February 1989. A second battle broke out at the airport on 9 March 1989, where the airport was recaptured by the government.\nBackground\nIn February 1989, the Soviet Union withdrew its forces from the Republic of Afghanistan as part of the Geneva Accords. In March 1989, the Afghan Interim Government launched an attack on the Eastern city of Jalalabad with the support of the Pakistani Inter-Service Intelligence. The Americans were reportedly motivated by their wish to humiliate the Marxists and send them out of Afghanistan, \"clinging to their helicopters\", thus avenge the fall of South Vietnam; Pakistan wished to establish a friendly government in Kabul led by the Peshawar Seven.\nSee also\n* Battle of Jalalabad (1989)\n* Afghan Civil War (1989–1992)\n* Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan\nReferences"
