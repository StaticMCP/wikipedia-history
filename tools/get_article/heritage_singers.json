Based near Placerville, California, the group has traveled to over 65 countries, performed over 7,000 concerts, produced 200 episodes for television programs, and recorded over 200 albums.\nHistory\nAfter four years of performing with the Rose City Singers, a patriotic/folk singing group sponsored by Portland-based United Medical Laboratories, the Maces decided to resign from their hospital duties and form a Christian group in 1971.  Founding member Jerry Leiske named the group Heritage Singers, based on Bible scripture equating saints with God's \"heritage ... objects of His special care.\"\nJerry and Rita Leiske left a short time thereafter and returned to their home in Alberta, Canada to form their own singing group.\nThe first year, they released two albums (Hymns We Remember and Come Along with the Heritage Singers), and performed their first public concert on June 4, 1971. Original accompanists included Bob Silverman on piano and Gerald Allen on bass guitar. After a few months, Jeff Wood would replace Allen and Pete McLeod would join on guitar. Even later on, the Heritage Singers collaborated with Ronn Huff, who arranged many of their early albums with full orchestration. One of Max's nephews, Terry Mace, ran the sound system for the group for one year in 1972 until Max's son Greg took over at the age of 13 in 1973; he has been the group's sound tech since.\nHeritage Singers bought a touring bus (a former Greyhound PD-4501 Scenicruiser they named \"Old Blue\") from a lot in San Francisco, which remained in their service for 10 years.\nAs their popularity grew, they formed a second group in September 1973, dubbed Heritage II, (subsequently named New Creation) to perform mostly at cities located in the eastern half of the United States;, and a third group in 1995,  dubbed Heritage Español, which toured South America singing Spanish versions of the group's signature songs. Almost 300 people have performed as members of The Heritage Singers; however, the Mace family has remained at its core. As for the religious affiliation of its members, Max Mace has stated that while a majority of them are Seventh-day Adventists, that's not in itself a requirement. \"They have to be a born-again Christian and receptive to the Adventist message.\"\nThroughout the 1980s, the group televised a program called \"Keep on Singing\" and was aired on Trinity Broadcasting Network. Many of the  programs  are currently available on YouTube under the name \"Heritage Singers Classics\". Around the same time this program was aired, Heritage Singers began performing for Loma Linda University Church and have done so ever since. Individual members have also been invited to sing at various services there.\nStarting in 1985, the group collaborated with Art Mapa, a Philippine-born sound producer, arranger, guitarist, and composer. Mapa would later marry the Maces' daughter Val. Soon after, Turning Point Studio was built on the Maces' expensive property near Placerville, CA that serves as the home base for the Heritage Singers. Their albums have been recorded there since. Not long after, Tim Davis came along and has been arranging and coaching vocals since 1992, joining them on stage a few concerts at a time.\nReunions\nCelebratory reunion concerts have been held in 1979 (Swing Auditorium), 1986 (Anaheim Convention Center), 2001 (Ontario Convention Center), and 2005 (Crystal Cathedral). A final 45th anniversary reunion was held at the Citizens Business Bank Arena on July 30, 2016, with 126 singers on stage.\nDeath of founder\nFollowing a battle with cancer, Max Mace died at the Heritage Ranch in Placerville on November 4, 2020, one day short of his 83rd birthday. At his funeral, his daughter Val announced that the group planned to continue with her as the director.\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n|+ List of albums with release dates and with record catalog numbers\n!
