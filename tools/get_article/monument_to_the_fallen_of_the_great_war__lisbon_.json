The monument was designed by architects Guilherme Rebelo de Andrade and Carlos Rebello de Andrade, and the sculptures by Maximiano Alves. The groundbreaking was held on 9 April 1923, when President of Portugal, António José de Almeida, laid the first stone. It was unveiled on 22 November 1931, in the presence of the President of Portugal, Óscar Carmona, and the Mayor of Lisbon, José Vicente de Freitas.\nCharacteristics\nThe monument is placed at Liberty Avenue, near the intersection with Salitre Street. It is made from white stone, features a personification of the Fatherland, in form of a man in robes and bearing flag, crowning a soldier of the Portuguese Army, that kneels in front of it, with a bronze laurel wreath. They are placed on a large stone pedestal, with a shield at the front, that bears the following inspiration: \"Ao serviço da Pátria, o esforço da Grei\". It is a quote of poet Augusto Casimiro, which translates from Portuguese to \"In the service of the Fatherland, the effort of its People\". Each side of the pedestal feature large inscription that reads: \"Grande Guerra\", meaning  the \"Great War\". On the sides of the pedestal are, two large stone figures of men, bent under the main part of the monument, symbolising their strive to keep the Fatherland standing.
