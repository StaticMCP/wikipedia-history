Barton reviewed Expedition to Zhodane in The Space Gamer No. 47. Barton commented that \"while not as exciting as a situation as, say, ''Twilight's Peak was, Expedition to Zhodane should prove sufficient for several sessions of intriguing Traveller play.\"\nTony Watson reviewed Expedition to Zhodane for Different Worlds magazine and stated that \"In summation, I would recommend this booklet to the Traveller gamemaster who is looking for a long, fairly complex, adventure to administer over a couple of playing sessions. As usual with GDW products, this is well thought out and interesting.\"\nSee also\n* Classic Traveller'' adventures\nReferences"
