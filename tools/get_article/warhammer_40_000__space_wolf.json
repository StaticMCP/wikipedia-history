A card-based system is used to control the main characters’ combat actions and movements. Player's equipment, powers and skills are also represented by cards. Cards vary in rarity and maximum level (how many times players can upgrade the card). Cards can be levelled by combining two cards of the same type. Players can create their own decks, picking the cards that fit their gameplay style and needs.\nDevelopment\nThe game was announced in August 2013 with a free-to-play business model.

The Space Wolves fight the Word Bearers despite being outnumbered and discover Oriax in an alien temple performing a ritual to awaken a Keeper of Secrets, a Great Daemon of the Chaos God Slaneesh. Oriax is defeated.\nSaga of the Great Awakening DLC\nOriax was defeated but his ritual has now awoken the Necrons, the builders of the temple, who now emerge and attack both the Space Wolves and the Word Bearers.Valgard and his Space Wolves fight their way out of the temple and realising they are heavily outnumbered decide to focus on destroying the new Necron threat.

The Space Wolves arrive too late and the daemon possesses Frells' body. Valgard manages to defeat the Keeper of Secrets and banishes it. With the Chaos forces dealt with Valgard begins attacking the Necron forces.
