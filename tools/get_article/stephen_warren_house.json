It has elements of Greek Revival, including brick pilasters supporting a wood entablature.\nIt was deemed \"architecturally significant as a good local example of vernacular Greek Revival\", potentially competing examples having been compromised, and as the \"last tangible reminder of Hartland's founder\".\nHistory\nThe house belongs to Stephen Warren. Both Stephen and his younger brother, Dewey, would become members of the Wisconsin State Assembly. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 and to the State Register of Historic Places in 1989.\nReferences"
