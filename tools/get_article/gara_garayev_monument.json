It is made of granite.\nThe monument is located behind the Nizami cinema, next to the Baku Music Academy and the residential building where the composer lived.\nThe monument's authors are the People's Artist of Azerbaijan, the sculptor Fazil Najafov and the Honoured Architect of Azerbaijan Rahim Seifullayev.\nBefore starting the work, Najafov studied the life and the work of Gara Garayev, according to the sculptor: “Garayev's music has filled my soul”. He understood that the statue should be complex, ambiguously perceived, carry something new, depicting non-conventional features...\nInitially, they thought to create the sculpture quickly, the authors planned that the statue would be a seated or standing figure, but several versions were made, the work took three years.\nUnveiling\nThe unveiling ceremony of the monument to the composer Gara Garayev took place on 3 February 2014 with the participation of the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, the First Lady Mehriban Aliyeva, and the son of the composer Faraj Garayev.\nSee also\n* Aliagha Vahid Monument\n* Jafar Jabbarli Monument\n* Mustafa Kemal Atatürk Monument, Baku\nReferences"
