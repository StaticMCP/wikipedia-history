The precinct is located in the suburb of South Brisbane, on the southern bank of the Brisbane River.\nHistory\nThe South Bank area was a central point for immigration in Brisbane in the 1840s and by the 1850s had become the city's main business district. After the 1893 flood, the central business district was moved to the north side of the river. By the 1930s the area was a busy industrial area and port.\nWorld Expo 88 and Parklands opening\nIn 1984, South Bank was chosen to host World Expo 88. The event lasted from 30 April to 30 October 1988 and brought in 18 million visitors during its run. After the expo was finished, the land where it was hosted was cleared and was originally going to be sold. However, public lobbying resulted in the site being turned into public parklands instead. On 20 June 1992 the South Bank Parklands were opened to the public.\nOn 31 August 2008 the Wheel of Brisbane, a 60-metre tall Ferris wheel was installed in the parklands. The wheel was installed to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Expo 88. The wheel was damaged in 2011 during a river flood.\nLandmarks\nSouth Bank Parklands\nThe South Bank Parklands, which were established on the former site of World Expo 88, are one of Brisbane's most popular tourist attractions.
