This is distinct from circumstances where a minister's appointment was terminated by the Taoiseach, in some instances where the minister refused to comply with a request to resign. Ministers may become disqualified if they cease to be members of the Oireachtas (other than at a general election) or where there is a statutory disqualification on them remaining in office.\nPrior to 1937, the head of government was the President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, rather than the Taoiseach.\nGovernment ministers\nMembers of the government are appointed by the president on the nomination of the Taoiseach and approval of the Dáil. The president accepts the resignation or terminates the appointment of a minister on the advice of the Taoiseach. This is governed by Articles 13 and 28 of the Constitution of Ireland.\nResignations\n{| class=\"wikitable
