In Roman legend, it was founded by the first king of Rome, Romulus, honoring a pledge he had made during a battle between the Romans and the Sabines. However, no temple seems to have been built on the site until the early 3rd century BC.\nLegend\nThe Battle of the Lacus Curtius took place in the Forum area between the Romans and Sabines. The Romans under Romulus had been forced to retreat uphill on the Via Sacra. According to Livy 1.12.6, in the vicinity of the Porta Mugonia Romulus prayed to Jupiter, vowing to build a temple on that site if the god stemmed the Sabine advance. The Romans regrouped and held their ground, staving off defeat.\nIn Livy 10.36.11 the same story is told about the consul Marcus Atilius Regulus, who made a similar vow in a similar situation, when the Romans were losing a battle against the Samnites in 294 BC, but they miraculously turned around, regrouped and held their ground against the enemy. Some scholars believe that the story of the earlier foundation by Romulus was a later pseudo-tradition. Livy himself (10.37.15) explains that the earlier temple was merely a , that is, consecrated ground where a temple was to be built later.\nOn November 8, 63 BC, it was in this temple, close to the Palatine Hill, that the senate convened to hear the consul Marcus Tullius Cicero deliver the first of his famous Catiline Orations against his enemy Lucius Catilina. This temple was also the place where Cicero imagined himself, 19 years later, delivering his Second Philippic oration against Mark Antony, although that speech was never actually given.\nThe temple was destroyed in the Great Fire of Rome during Nero's reign in July of 64 CE.\nLocation\nWritten sources locate the temple just in front of the gate of the Palatine Hill leading to the Sacred Way. For example, Ovid (Fasti 6.794) mentions the temple of Stator \"which Romulus once founded in front of the mouth of the Palatine Hill\" (). However, the exact location of this gate, the Porta Mugonia, is not known with absolute certainty.\nLivy states that the temple was located near the royal palace at the time of the death of Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, near the \"new street\" (nova via) and that Queen Tanaquil addressed the people from the palace window.\nThere is a fair amount of consensus on a location just besides the Arch of Titus on the northern slope of the Palatine Hill. When a medieval tower was demolished in 1827, the ruins of an ancient building appeared, and the remains are frequently identified as the foundations of the temple.\nThe Italian archaeologist Filippo Coarelli places it closer to the forum, between the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina and the Basilica of Maxentius, where the Temple of Romulus stands. His line of reasoning is based on the course of the Via Sacra before the construction of the Basilica of Maxentius, the known borders of the ancient administrative regions of the city and the literary sources listing the monuments in each region. The location near the Arch of Titus does not fit since it is in the wrong administrative region and not in the right position relative to the other buildings listed by ancient writers, but the Temple of Romulus on the Via Sacra is a perfect match.\nThe name Stator\nThe Latin word  (the a is short, cf. Ovid Fasti 6.794, Tristia 3.1.31) has two possible meanings, one \"stander, attendant\" from the intransitive verb  \"I stand\", the other \"he who makes someone stand\", from the transitive verb  \"I cause to stand\". The second meaning is the one intended here. The Oxford Latin Dictionary translates it as \"one who establishes or upholds\", Lewis and Short's Latin Dictionary as \"stayer, supporter\".\nLivy similarly connects the name  with the verb  in Romulus's prayer to Jupiter made at the moment when Romulus vowed to build a temple: \"Take away the Romans' terror, and stay their disgraceful fleeing (); here I vow a temple to you, the Stayer Jupiter, to be a reminder to posterity that the city was saved with your present help.\" In his account of the year 294 BC, he connects it with  \"I stand firm\":  \"(Regulus) vowed a temple to Jupiter the Stayer, if the Roman battle line stood firm\".\nSee also\n*List of Ancient Roman temples\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*  |year=1992 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-0-8018-4300-6 |lccn=91-45046 |page=225 }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://sights.seindal.dk/sight/971_Temple_of_Jupiter_Stator.html Sights]\n* [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Aedes_Jovis_Statoris.html Forum  temple]"
