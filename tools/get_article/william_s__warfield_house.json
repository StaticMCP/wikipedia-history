Warfield House is a historic house located at 1624 Maine Street in Quincy, Illinois. The house was built in 1886 for William S. Warfield, who founded the Warfield Grocery Co.; Warfield was one of many prominent Quincy residents to build a large house on Maine Street. Architect Joseph Lyman Silsbee designed the house in a blend of the Richardsonian Romanesque and Queen Anne styles; his design popularized Romanesque architecture, and the blend with Queen Anne in particular, in Quincy. The house features a stone exterior with terra cotta decorations, a massive plan, and a large western porch as well as several smaller porches throughout.\nThe house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 21, 1979.\nReferences"
