The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final.\nBefore Eurovision\nA Song for Europe 1980\nA Song for Europe 1980 was held on 26 March 1980 at the BBC Television Theatre in London and was hosted by Terry Wogan. The BBC Concert Orchestra under the direction of John Coleman as conductor accompanied all the songs, but all the music was pre-recorded. 12 songs were chosen by the Music Publisher's Association.\nFollowing his second place in the 1979 contest, songwriter Richard Gillinson was asked to submit a song to replace the disqualified entry \"Tell Me\" by the New Seekers, which was eliminated two weeks before the final after the group began promoting the track before the contest. Gillinson's song \"Surrender\" was performed by the same artist who presented his 1979 song, Kim Clark. The lead vocal of \"Tell Me\" was taken by New Seeker Nicola Kerr, who had been one of the 'Plus Two' who had finished 3rd for .\nThe twelve songs were voted on by 14 regional juries, who awarded 1-12 points to each song. Each of the 11 jurors awarded 1-5 points to each song, the total scores being added up, with the song earning the most points being awarded 12 points, the second placed song earned 11, the third 10 and so on, down to 1 point for the song with the fewest votes.\nThe jury spokesperson could be seen on screen awarding the votes, sometimes with the jury members in vision. These were broadcast from the BBC's 14 regional news studios.\nOwing to a tie break and with the live show quickly running out of time, a clearly flustered Terry Wogan, unsure of what to do in this unprecedented circumstance, returned to the 14 juries who were hastily asked to pick their favourite between songs two and five.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center\"\n|-\n|+ A Song for Europe 198026 March 1980\n|-\n!
