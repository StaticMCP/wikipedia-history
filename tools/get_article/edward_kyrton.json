He supported the Royalist side in the English Civil War.\nBiography\nKyrton, baptised on 15 May 1585 was the son of Daniel Kirton (died 1591) of Almsford Park, Somerset,  and Frances. He graduated from Oxford with an MA in 1643 (the Royalist capital during the Civil War).\nKyrton lived at Castle Cary, and was steward to the Marquis of Hertford.\nIn 1621 he was returned as Member of Parliament for Newcastle-Under-Lyme In 1624 he was returned MP for Ludgershall, Wiltshire. He was returned MP for Marlborough in 1625 and 1626. In 1628 he was elected MP for Great Bedwyn and sat until 1629 when King Charles I decided to rule without parliament for eleven years.\nIn April 1640, Kyrton was elected MP for Milborne Port, Somerset in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Milborne Port in November 1640 for the Long Parliament.  His support for the Royalist cause led to his being disabled from sitting in the Westminster Parliament in August 1642, and his subsequent sitting in King Charles's Oxford Parliament (1644–1645).\nAfter the Battle of Worcester the young King Charles II stopped with Kyrton at Castle Cary during his flight to France. Kyrton died and was buried on 30 January 1654.\nFamily\nIn 1618 Kyrton married Margaret Baud, daughter of Ferdinando Baud of Walgrave, Northants who survived him. It is unknown if they had children, but none survived him.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n|-"
