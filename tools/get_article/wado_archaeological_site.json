The site is famous for the 708 CE discovery of native copper, which prompted the issuance of Japan’s first official coin, the Wadōkaichin (和同開珎), and the start of the Wadō era.\nHistory\nIn 708, copper ore was discovered in the region then known as Musashi Province. The finding was reported to Empress Genmei, who celebrated the discovery by naming the era “Wadō” (和銅, “Japanese copper”) and commissioning the minting of Japan's first state-sanctioned coin, the Wadōkaichin.\nThe copper mined at Wado became a symbol of national prosperity and marked the beginning of a centralized monetary economy in Japan. Mining activity continued intermittently through the Nara and Edo periods and ceased entirely by the late 20th century.\nArchaeological Features\nThe Wado Archaeological Site includes remains of copper mining operations such as shafts, slag deposits, stone markers, and smelting traces. Interpretive signs and monuments have been installed, and nearby shrines and museums commemorate the site’s historical and cultural value.\nA large replica of the Wadōkaichin coin stands near the site, and the adjacent Wadō Park offers educational exhibits and nature trails.\nDesignation\nThe site is recognized as a historic cultural property by Saitama Prefecture and is preserved as an educational and heritage tourism location. It features prominently in local history education and is a pilgrimage site for those interested in Japanese coinage and early mining history.\nLegacy\nThe name “Wadō” survives in regional place names and historical commemorations. The coin that originated here remains one of Japan’s most iconic artifacts, and replicas are used in talismans for wealth and prosperity.\nSee also\n* Wadōkaichin\n* Chichibu\n* Empress Genmei\n* Mining in Japan\n* List of Historic Sites of Japan (Saitama)\nGallery\nFile:Wado-CopperMineSite-WadōkaichinMonument-WithMineArea.jpg|Wadōkaichin Coin Monument with Mine Area\nFile:Wado-CopperMineSite.jpg|Copper Mine Site\nFile:Wado Copper Mine Archaeological Site - Descriptive Sign.jpg|Copper Mine Site Descriptive Sign\nFile:Wado-CopperMineSite-DescriptiveSignWithMap.jpg|Descriptive Sign With Map\nFile:Wado-CopperMineSite-DescriptiveSignWithPhoto.jpg|Descriptive Sign With Photo\nFile:Wado-HijiriJinjaShrineBuilding.jpg|Hijiri Jinja Shrine\nFile:Wado-HijiriJinjaShrine-WadōkaichinWithSign.jpg|Wadōkaichin with Descriptive Sign\nReferences"
