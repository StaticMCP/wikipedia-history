Candidates must be Czech citizens under the age of 35.\nHistory\nThe prize was established in 1990 by Václav Havel, Jiří Kolář and Theodor Pištěk. Until 2000, it was awarded in cooperation with the National Gallery in Prague, but following a dispute between Milan Knížák and David Černý the administration was moved to Brno (Dům umění města Brna and Dům pánů z Kunštátu).\nBackground\nThe prize is awarded by an independent jury, and is managed by the civic association Jindřich Chalupecký Society (). It is named after the art critic and art historian Jindřich Chalupecký.\nThe winner receives CZK 50,000 together with a further CZK 100,000 for an exhibition, project or catalogue, and a six-week scholarship in New York.\nThe awards are announced in the magazine Reflex, and an award based on the voting on the website of the magazine carries CZK 30,000 and an auction of works by the finalists.\nLaureates\nSource: [https://web.archive.org/web/20150202235539/http://www.cjch.cz/en/laureate Jindřich Chalupecký Society]\n*2010 – Vasil Artamonov and Alexey Klyuykov\n*2011 – Mark Ther\n*2012 – Vladimír Houdek\n*2013 - Dominik Lang\n*2014 - Roman Štětina\n*2015 - Barbora Kleinhamplová\n*2016 - Matyáš Chochola\n}}\nSee also\n*List of European art awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.cjch.cz/ Jindřich Chalupecký Society]\n*[http://www.reflex.cz/clanek25128.html Jindřich Chalupecký Award in Reflex]\n*[http://vvp.avu.cz/idatum/search/instituce-21 Jindřich Chalupecký Award in VVP AVU]"
