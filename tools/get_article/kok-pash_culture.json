The Kok-Pash monuments appeared in Altai Mountains in the second half of the 3rd century AD and coexisted with the Bulan-Koba culture.\nArchaeology and Anthropology\nContrary to the Europoid groups such as Pazyryk and Bulan-Koba culture, the Kok-Pash skeletal remains exhibit pronounced East Asian (Mongoloid) features, marking a new population influx in Altai mountains from the East in the 3rd century CE.\nThe Kok-Pash burials share similarities to the Kokel culture in Tuva. in the 3rd century CE the Kok-Pash people annexed parts of territories of the Bulan-Koba culture in south and southeastern parts of the Altai Mountain of Russia and coexisted with the remnants of the Bulan-koba culture in the north and northwestern parts of the Altai Mountains until the 5th century CE. The burials of Kok-Pash culture consists of wooden coffins in narrow pits beneath rectangular mounds with a north-south orientation. grave goods are no different from Bulan-Koba culture. the Kok-Pash and Bulan-koba cultures were both replaced by Turkic burial traditions in Altai mountains.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
