The 1st Edition set of rules was published in 2002.\nFlames of War allows players to wargame company-level battles from the European, Pacific, and North African Theatres of World War II, using 1/100 scale miniatures (15&nbsp;mm figure scale) and miniature armor. In the 1st Edition rulebook, basic army lists were provided for the mid-war period (1942–1943), while Battlefront published early (1939–1941) and late war (1944–1945) army lists on their website (subsequently these early and late war lists were removed). The 2nd Edition of the rulebook was published in 2006. The 3rd Edition was released on March 10, 2012. The 4th Edition was released in March 2017.\nGameplay\nThe gameplay takes place over a series of turns, with players alternating movement, shooting, and close assault. The game is optimized for two players, although it can be played by a larger number of players playing against each other or grouped in teams.\nThe play revolves around company-level tactics, with each stand or element representing an infantry fireteam (half-squad/section), an artillery piece and its crew, or a single vehicle (such as a tank, jeep, or armored car). Air support is also available, in the form of fighter bombers (such as the Hawker Hurricane) and ground attack aircraft (such as the Ilyushin Il-2 \"Shturmovik\"), with aircraft generally being represented by 1:144 scale models.\nThe main rulebook has scenarios that players can use for their games, with all of these scenarios centered on capturing objectives. Additional army sourcebooks contain further scenarios, usually centered on historical events relevant to that particular book. Game play utilizes six-sided dice to pass various skill tests used to shoot at enemies or pass motivation-based tests. Movement distances and weapon ranges are provided in both inches and centimeters and are usually measured with tape measures or other measuring aides. Tokens are used to indicate pinned-down troops, bogged down vehicles, etc.\nCurrent army sourcebooks are based on particular campaigns and include army lists for the German forces (such as Afrika Korps, Waffen SS and Luftwaffe ground troops), the U.S. Army (including Rangers and Airborne units), the armies of United Kingdom and Commonwealth (India, Australia, Canada, South Africa, and New Zealand), the Red Army of the Soviet Union, (including the Soviet 8ya Gvardeyskiy Strelkovy Korpus), the Italian army (including elite Bersaglieri and Paracadutisti, regular Fucilieri, and fascist Blackshirts paramilitaries), as well as nations that played as smaller role such as the Polish, Hungarians, Finnish, Romanians, as well as the Japanese and United States Marines for the Pacific Theatre campaign.\nRules and sourcebooks\nBattlefront divides World War II into three periods: early-war (1939–41), mid-war (1942–43) and late-war (1944–45). Each period has its own point values aimed at recreating actual battle situations that would have occurred during the respective time periods. Sourcebooks are compiled to represent forces from one of the time periods, some only cover specific battles (Blood, Guts, and Glory, ''Devil's Charge, etc.) while other books cover broad campaigns with lists that span multiple years (North Africa, Eastern Front, etc.).\nFourth Edition Rulebooks, Starter/Army box sets and Sourcebooks\n* Flames of War - Rule Book V4, released in 2017, FW007 covers Mid-War period only.\n* Flames of War - Rule Book V4, released in 2017, FW008 covers Early-War & Late-War period.\nMid-War period Sourcebooks\n* Desert Rats released in Feb 2017 covers North Africa British desert forces 1942–43, and was quickly superseded with the publication of Armored Fist.\n* Afrika Korps released in Mar 2017 covers North African German desert forces 1942-43.\n* Avanti released in Jan 2018 covers Italian North African desert forces 1942-43.\n* Fighting First released in Dec 2017 covers U.S. Army forces in the North Africa desert Area 1942-43.\n* Armored Fist released in April 2018, supersedes Desert Rats and like that covers North African desert British forces 1942-43.\n* Iron Cross released in late 2018, covers German forces at the Battle of Stalingrad 1942-1943.\n* Enemy at the Gates released in late 2018, covers Soviet forces 1942 though the Battle of Stalingrad 1942-1943.\n* Red Banner released in early 2019, covers Soviet forces during the Battle of Kursk 1943.\n* Ghost Panzers released in early 2019, covers German forces during the Battle of Kursk 1943.\n* North Africa: Mid-War released in March 2022, includes all content from Armored Fist, Fighting First, Afrika Korp, Avanti, and mid-war Airborne forces.\n* Eastern Front: Mid-war released in August 2022, includes all content from Iron Cross, Ghost Panzer, Red Banner, Enemy at the Gates, White Death, Hungarian Steel, and Brave Romania.\nMid-War period Force Booklets\n* All American released in November 2019, covers American Airborne and Rangers during mid-war campaigns 1942-1943.\n* Death From Above released in November 2019, covers German and Italian Airborne forces during mid-war campaigns 1942-1943.\n* Red Devils released in May 2020, covers British Airborne and Commando forces during mid-war campaigns 1942-1943.\nLate-War period Source Books\n* Armies Of Late War, released in early 2018, covers the US, German, British, and Soviet forces.\n* Fortress Europe, released in May 2019 covering American, German, British and Soviet forces in a simple introductory manner with simple list of forces.\n* D-Day American Forces In Normandy, released in May 2019 covering the Normandy Invasion, Operation Overlord, to the Breakout during Operation Cobra and on to the Fall of Brest and Paris in late August–September 1944.\n* D-Day German Forces in Normandy, released in September 2019 covering the Defense of the Atlantic War in Normandy, the Defense of Saint Lo then the following Battle in Brittany.\n* D-Day British Forces in Normandy, released in 2020 covering British and Commonwealth forces from the D-Day amphibious and airborne landings through to the Normandy Breakout.\n* D-Day Waffen SS, released in August 2020 covering the quickly mobilized army of veteran-led conscripts to counter-attack the Allied invasion front in France in 1944.\n* Bagration Soviet'', released in September 2020 covering the events of Operation Bagration and the Soviet Army's offensive against Germany in Byelorussia on June 22, 1944.\n* Bagration German, released in March 2021 covering the German forces fighting from Finland to Romania to repel the vicious Russian offensives from January 1944-45.\n* Bulge American, released in November 2021 covering the American forces defending against the German Ardennes Counteroffensive from December 1944 to January 1945.\n* Bulge German, released in May 2022 covering the German forces attacking through Ardennes from December 1944 to January 1945.\n* Bulge British, released in October 2022 covering the British forces involved in Operation Market Garden through the Battle of the Bulge and the end of the war.\n* ''Berlin Soviet', released in March 2023.\n* Berlin German, released in April 2023.\nThird Edition sourcebooks\nEarly-War period\n* Barbarossa, released in Oct 2014 covers German forces invading the Soviet Union.\n* Rising Sun covers the Soviet Union's early war operations in the Winter War against Finland, as well as their operations against the Japanese Empire during the Battles of Khalkhin Gol.\nLate-War period\n* Berlin, released in June 2015, covers Soviet forces during the Battle of Berlin.\n* Nachtjager, which means 'Night Hunter', released in Dec 2012, covers The Battle For Northern Germany in the months of March - May 1945.\n* The Battle of the Bulge, released in Sept 2016, covers Allied Forces on the German Border, Sep 1944 – Feb 1945 and The Ardennes Offensive: German Forces in Lorraine and the Ardennes, Sep 1944 – Feb 1945.

These lists are official Battlefront lists and are eligible to be played in many tournaments. Additionally, Battlefront will host \"unofficial\" briefings developed by fans, although such lists are generally not eligible for tournament play.\nModels and availability\nBattlefront Miniatures is releasing at 15mm/ 1/100 scale, made up mostly of plastic models (some vehicles and figures remain in the original resin and white metal), for use in playing Flames of War. This includes models for ground forces, such as infantry, vehicles and field guns, along with a limited range of 1/144 model aircraft. The models are sold in blister packs and assorted boxed sets with 3-5 models each for vehicles and often up to 100 models for infantry boxes.\nOther manufacturers, such as Plastic Soldier Company, produce 15mm figures for war gaming World War II, which can be used in addition to or instead of Battlefront's figures, in either private or tournament play. Battlefront allows the use of third party models even in officially run tournaments, which is rare among wargames companies that sell their own lines of models.\nTournaments\nBattlefront supports the tournament scene that revolves around Flames of War. Flames of War tournaments are held across the world and through the Flames of War website players have access to listings of upcoming events through the Flames of War Events Calendar. Each area of the world has a specific events calendar that players can use to find events near them. In North America Battlefront promotes a National Tournament Season in which winners of regional tournaments are qualified to play in any of the three National Tournaments. Players winning an Overall Championship or Best General Award from the three Nationals receives an automatic invitation to the North America Masters tournament. Other spots on the Masters Tournament are filled by the top ranked players on the Rankings HQ website. Individuals, clubs, or shops wishing to run a Flames of War sponsored tournament can contact Battlefront through Battlefront's website.\nReception\nAt the 2004 Origins Awards Flames of War was one of the winners of the Vanguard Awards.\nWilliam Jones comments: \"Historical miniature gamers will certainly continue the quest for the perfect new rules systems — the same quest that, in part, brought Phil Yates to create Flames of War. But his marvelous design offers quite a lot, especially to those tabletop tacticians who long for a game where strategy is dominant, who want to dedicate more time to plotting a battleplan and less to worrying about the rules. Flames of War boasts a wonderful balance between speed of play, detail, and flavor\".\nSuccessor games\nIn November 2009, Battlefront announced Flames of War Vietnam - The Battle for la Drang. This rule set was released in Wargames Illustrated Magazine #266, and received a limited release of supporting models. In April 2011 Flames of War Vietnam was made a permanent rule set when the first sourcebook was added as a free addition to Wargames Illustrated Magazine #282, along with the re-release of the original miniatures (in new packaging) and several new box sets. In March 2013 the first softback released through the Flames of War brand rather than Wargames Illustrated was released. This book contained several lists previously seen in releases from Wargames Illustrated such as those for the United States as well as PAVN and will be supported by a full range of models.
