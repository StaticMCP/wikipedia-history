It is in the West Pennine Moors north of Bolton.\nThe reservoir did not supply drinking water but was built to supply water to Rycroft Works in the early 19th century. It was enlarged in 1893 by Deacons who used the water to supply Belmont Bleachworks.\nIt holds 150,000 cubic metres of water, with a surface area of 28,000 square metres, when full. Most of the reservoir is only a few feet deep, but it has a depth of about  at its deepest point.\nThe reservoir was drained by its owner, Belmont Holdings, in 2010, despite efforts by local residents to save it. It had fallen into a state of disrepair following the closure of the bleachworks, and was considered a flood risk by the Environment Agency.\nBy the end of August 2010 heavy rain had refilled the reservoir, and in September 2010 it was sold for £50,000. The buyer is thought to be a Horwich-based consortium who will renovate and develop the reservoir for recreational use.\nReferences"
