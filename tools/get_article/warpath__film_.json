He finds one of them, Woodson, and kills him in a gunfight, but not before learning from him that the other two men have joined the United States Army cavalry, and, unbeknownst to him, are in the ill-fated  7th Cavalry Regiment.\nVickers travels to the upper western   Dakota Territory (now North Dakota), where he plans to reenlist in the Army as a buck private recruit under the command of General George Armstrong Custer (1839–1876), (James Millican), at Fort Abraham Lincoln, to continue his search in the ranks of the Army cavalry. En route he sees a sergeant named O'Hara (Forrest Tucker) physically manhandling an attractive young woman and intervenes. Molly Quade (Polly Bergen),  is grateful for his intervention, but Sgt. O'Hara gets even later when Vickers coincidentally ends up serving under him at the fort, giving Vickers the most unpleasant menial dirty duties and assignments.\nMolly has come to the fort to help her father Sam Quade (Dean Jagger) run a general store. He is opposed to her attraction to this new recruit Vickers. While out on an assigned mission, a troop of soldiers led by Captain Gregson (Harry Carey Jr.), are badly outnumbered by a band of Lakota Sioux warriors until being rescued by General Custer and his troops. Vickers is recognized by General Custer as a former Union Army officer from his Civil War days a decade before and is promoted to first sergeant.\nO'Hara realizes that Vickers suspects him to be one of the killers of his fiancée. An ambush attempt fails, so the Sergeant deserts the Army and flees. A military wagon train is formed to evacuate civilians from the fort while Custer prepares to do battle with the Sioux natives near the Little Bighorn River further west in the southeastern portion of the adjacent Montana Territory at what turns out to be the later tragedy of the famous Battle of the Little Bighorn in June 1876/ Along the way, Molly, her father, Vickers and several others are taken captive. They see that ex-Sgt. O'Hara is a prisoner too, and when he learns Custer's men will be hopelessly outnumbered and probably slaughtered, he, despite his earlier crimes and desertion, tries to go warn the general and sacrifices his own life running through a gauntlet line in the village, distracting the Sioux until the others led by Vickers can escape.\nMolly, her father and Vickers grab some unguarded horses behind their tent and ride off and hide from the Indians until daylight. Molly becomes aware that her father is the third killer that Sgt. Vickers has been seeking for years. Before she can persuade Vickers not to kill him, Sam Quade rides off in the darkness by himself to try to warn Custer, which will certainly lead to his own death.\nCast\n* Edmond O'Brien as John Vickers\n* Dean Jagger as Sam Quade\n* Forrest Tucker as Sgt.
