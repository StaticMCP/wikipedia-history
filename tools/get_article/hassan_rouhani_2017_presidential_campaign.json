The election itself and related events received international media attention with many issues being raised. Rouhani achieved a decisive victory after the May 2017 vote, with Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli announcing that out of 41.3 million total votes cast Rouhani got 23.6 million. Ebrahim Raisi, Rouhani's closest rival, had picked up 15.8 million votes in contrast.\nEarly stages\nThe incumbent President Hassan Rouhani was considered a potential candidate in 2015.

On 13 January 2017, Mahmoud Vaezi said Moderation and Development Party will back Rouhani in the election. Rouhani himself never announced bid for re-election.\nBranding and record\nIn the summer of 2013 Rouhani was up against serious problems in almost every key sector of the Iranian economy. The economic picture is incomparably better today than it was three years ago. Inflation has declined from 40 to 10%, and the rial’s exchange rate has stabilized at its level from the year President Rouhani was elected.\nRouhani has restored a sense of security by preventing hyperinflation and shortages. Peace with world major powers on the basis of Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action at the time he was done. Removing the nuclear sanctions was among Rouhani campaign promises in 2013 and according to his administration, all nuclear-related sanctions, except for certain restrictions in banking, have been lifted following the nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers.\nThe administration Rouhani also succeeded in increasing Iran’s revenues via boosting oil and gas outputs and growing gas condensate exports. Iran oil exports have doubled since the deal took effect and major problems in the way of securing insurance for cargoes carrying oil from Iran have been resolved. Iran there has been an uptick in Asian and European trade with Iran, mainly due to the expansion of Iranian oil exports, which now stand at 2.5 million bpd. Foreigners have shown interest in making investments in the country and sharing their technologic know-how in various industrial fields. Consequently, the Rouhani administration succeeded in signing various agreements to attract foreign investments for implementing infrastructure projects to revamp road, rail, and air transport systems.\nHe extension government campaign by name \"Again Iran\" and We cannot go back.

Addressing a stadium packed with tens of thousands of supporters, Rouhani, who seeks another four-year term in office in the May 19 vote, said the nation on Election day should show the world that it is \"determined for the future of Iran, not to sell it out. Rouhani said 12th government to promote justice, reforms Iran spared no efforts to transform the image of extremism and violence to image of hope and justice and reformist way.\nPositions\nEconomics\nRouhani said \"If we want a better economy, we should not let groups with security and political backing to get involved in the economy,\" Rouhani said during the debate, in an unmistakable swipe at the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite military force with a vast business empire, which has backed his main hardline opponent Ebrahim Raisi. Rouhani said at telecast “Some believe that unemployment can be tackled simply by distributing money or claiming to create plenty of jobs, while what is actually required to raise employment is making people look hopefully at future and feel calm and safe”.\nForeign policy\nRouhani said at Isfahan and Mazandaran \"Dear people of Iran, vote for freedom. I am ready to get the remaining sanctions lifted if elected. Rouhani said, \"Lifting the remaining sanctions would be difficult, as Khamenei, who has the last say on all state matters, has flatly rejected normalization of ties with the United States.\"\nSocial rights\nRouhani said in Shiroudi hall meeting, “We won’t accept gender discrimination, we won’t accept gender oppression we want social and political freedom,” he said amid occasional eruptions of chants in support of opposition leaders under house arrest, Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi and Mohammad Khatami dear for people.

Rouhani advocates the free functioning of social networks.\nRouhani to say Ebrahim Raisi, \"I am surprised. Those of you who talk about freedom of speech these days\".\nYoung generation\nRouhani against rivals said “We are here to tell pro-violence extremists that your era has come to an end”, “You hardliners cannot stand against our youth’s choice of freedom and progress.”\nProvincial visits\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
