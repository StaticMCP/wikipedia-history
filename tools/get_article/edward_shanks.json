He also wrote some science fiction.\nHe was born in London, and educated at Merchant Taylors' School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He passed his B.A. in history in 1913. He was editor of Granta from 1912 to 1913. He served in World War I with the British Army in France, but was invalided out in 1915, and did administrative work until war's end.\nHe was later a literary reviewer, working for the London Mercury (1919–22) and for a short while a lecturer at the University of Liverpool (1926). He was the chief leader-writer for the Evening Standard from 1928 to 1935.\nThe People of the Ruins (1920) was a science-fiction novel in which a man wakes after being put into suspended animation in 1924, to discover a devastated Britain 150 years in the future.
