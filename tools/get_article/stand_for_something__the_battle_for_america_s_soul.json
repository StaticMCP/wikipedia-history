Among the political leaders he admires for pursuing the public good are civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. and presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, each of whom he views as inspiring people \"to do better in their own lives.\"\nThe book includes descriptions of his working-class childhood in McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania, the son of a letter carrier.  He discloses to his readers that although he served as an altar boy in his childhood parish, he liked girls \"too much\" to seriously contemplate entering the priesthood.\nReferences"
