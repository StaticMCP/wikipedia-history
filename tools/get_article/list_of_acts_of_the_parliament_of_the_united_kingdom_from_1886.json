For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\". Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\nAll modern acts have a short title, e.g. the Local Government Act 2003. Some earlier acts also have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n49 & 50 Vict.\nThe 23rd Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 12 January 1886 until 25 June 1886.\nPublic general acts\n|  so far as regards Eels.}}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  so far as regards the Superannuation of Prison Officers.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  and to reduce for a like period the Permanent Annual Charge of the National Debt.|note4= }}\n| or the Drowned Persons (Discovery and Interment) Act 1886|public|20|04-06-1886|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to amend the Law in respect to the Discovery and Interment of Persons drowned.|note4= }}\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|  1867, 1870, 1877, 1879, 1880, and 1883. }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n| or the '''Crofters' Act 1886|public|29|25-06-1886|maintained=y|archived=n|An Act to amend the Law relating to the Tenure of Land by Crofters in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, and for other purposes relating thereto.}}\n|  and 1881. }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n| known in Canada as the Constitution Act, 1886|public|35|25-06-1886|maintained=y|archived=n|An Act respecting the representation in the Parliament of Canada of territories which for the time being form part of the Dominion of Canada, but are not included in any province.}}\n|\n|  so far as respects the drawings by which specifications are required to be accompanied and as respects exhibitions.}}\n|  }}\n|\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| or the Public Works Loans (Tramways, Ireland) Act 1886'''|public|46|25-06-1886|archived=n|An Act to amend the Act of the sixth and seventh years of William the Fourth, chapter one hundred and eight. }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|\n}}\nLocal acts\nand the Acts amending the same, relating to the Glasheen River Drainage District, in the County of Cork.|po1=In the matter of the Glasheen River Drainage District, in the county of Cork.|po1short=n|}}\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  and for other purposes.}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  and the Metropolitan Commons Amendment Act, 1869, relating to Chislehurst Common.|po1=Scheme with respect to Chiselhurst Common.|po1short=n|}}\n| |po1=Provisional Order for the Regulation of Stoke Common.|po1short=n}}\n|\n|\n|po2=Great Harwood Order 1886|Provisional Order for partially repealing a Confirming Act.\n|po3=Leek Order 1886|Provisional Order for altering the Leek Improvement Act, 1855.\n|po4=Bognor Order (1) 1886|Provisional Order to enable the Sanitary Authority for the Urban Sanitary District of Bognor to put in force the Compulsory Clauses of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Acts.\n|po5=Bognor Order (2) 1886|Provisional Order for altering a Confirming Act.\n|po6=Shepton Mallet Order 1886|Provisional Order for altering the area of the Local Government District of Shepton Mallet.\n|po7=Weston-super-Mare Order 1886|Provisional Order for altering a Local Act. }}\n|\n|  as extended by the Poor Law Act, 1879, relating to the Townships of Manchester and Hulme.|po1=Manchester and Hulme Order 1886|Provisional Order for altering the Manchester Overseers Act, 1858.}}\n|  as amended and extended by the Poor Law Act, 1879, relating to the Parishes of Glinton, Greetwell, Mappleton, Maxey, Newborough, Northborough, Okeover, Peakirk, Snelston, Thorpe, and Willingham Cherry; to the Townships of Alkmonton, Biggin, Calwich, Clifton and Compton, Ellastone, Hollington, Hulland, Longford, Mayfield, Newball, Newton Grange, Prestwood, Rand, and Shirley; to the Chapelries of Bullington and Fulnetby; and to the Liberty of Offcote and Underwood.|po1=Alkmonton, &c.
