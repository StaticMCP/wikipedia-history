The Fibonacci numbers, often presented in conjunction with the golden ratio, are a popular theme in culture. They have been mentioned in novels, films, television shows, and songs. The numbers have also been used in the creation of music, visual art, and architecture.\nArchitecture\nThe sequence has been used in the design of a building, the Core, at the Eden Project, near St Austell, Cornwall, England.\nFile:Fibonacci Terrace, Science Centre Singapore - 20151121.jpg|The Fibonacci Terrace at the Science Centre Singapore.
