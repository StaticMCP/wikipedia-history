      "text": "# Timeline of the 1985 Atlantic hurricane season\n\nThe 1985 Atlantic hurricane season was an event in the annual Atlantic hurricane season in the north Atlantic Ocean. It featured average activity overall, with thirteen tropical cyclones, eleven tropical storms, seven hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. The season officially began on June&nbsp;1, 1985 and ended November&nbsp;30, 1985. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most systems form. The season's first storm, Tropical Storm Ana, developed on July&nbsp;15; the season's final storm, Tropical Depression Thirteen, dissipated on December&nbsp;9.\nThe 1985 season was particularly destructive and disruptive for the United States, with damage amounting to a then-record US$4&nbsp;billion. The entire coastline from Brownsville, Texas, to Eastport, Maine, was under a gale warning at some point during the year and a portion of every coastal state was under a hurricane warning. Eight tropical cyclones made landfall in the United States, including a record-tying six hurricanes, the most in a single year since 1916.\nThis timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It includes information that was not released throughout the season, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not initially warned upon, has been included.\nBy convention, meteorologists one time zone when issuing forecasts and making observations: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and also use the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight UTC). In this time line, all information is listed by UTC first with the respective local time included in parentheses.\nTimeline\nJune\n;June 1\n*The 1985 Atlantic hurricane season officially begins.\nJuly\n;July&nbsp;15\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;p.m. AST) &ndash; Tropical Depression One forms approximately  south-southeast of Bermuda.\n;July&nbsp;16\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;p.m. AST) &ndash; Tropical Depression One strengthens into Tropical Storm Ana about  southwest of Bermuda.\n;July&nbsp;19\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;p.m. AST, July&nbsp;18) &ndash; Tropical Storm Ana achieves its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of  and a minimum barometric pressure of 996&nbsp;mbar (hPa; 29.42&nbsp;inHg) roughly  northwest of Sable Island, Canada.\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;am AST) &ndash; Tropical Storm Ana transitions into an extratropical cyclone about  east-southeast of Glace Bay, Nova Scotia.\n;July&nbsp;21\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;a.m. EDT) &ndash; Tropical Depression Two forms over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico roughly  west-southwest of Cape Coral, Florida.\n;July&nbsp;22\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT) &ndash; Tropical Depression Two strengthens into Tropical Storm Bob about  west-southwest of Cape Coral, Florida.\n;July&nbsp;23\n*Between 12:00 and 18:00&nbsp;UTC (between 8:00&nbsp;a.m. and 2:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT) &ndash; Tropical Storm Bob makes landfall near Bonita Springs, Florida with winds of .\n;July&nbsp;24\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT) &ndash; Tropical Storm Bob intensifies into a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane approximately  east-northeast of Jacksonville, Florida.\n;July&nbsp;25\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT, July&nbsp;24) &ndash; Hurricane Bob attains its peak intensity with winds of  and a minimum pressure of 102 mbar (hPa;  roughly  southeast of Savannah, Georgia.\n*03:00&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;pm EDT, July&nbsp;24) &ndash; Hurricane Bob makes landfall near Beaufort, South Carolina, with winds of .\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;am EDT) &ndash; Hurricane Bob weakens to a tropical storm about  west-northwest of Charleston, South Carolina.\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;pm EDT) &ndash; Tropical Storm Bob degrades to a tropical depression roughly  northwest of Greensboro, North Carolina.\n;July&nbsp;26\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;pm EDT, July&nbsp;25) &ndash; Tropical Depression Bob merges with a trough, marking its dissipation, over the Appalachian Mountains along the Virginia–West Virginia border.\nAugust\n;August&nbsp;9\n:*18:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT) &ndash; A subtropical depression develops about  southeast of Savannah, Georgia.\n;August&nbsp;9\n:*00:00&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT, August&nbsp;8) &ndash; The subtropical depression acquires a warm core, spiral banding, and gale-force winds.
