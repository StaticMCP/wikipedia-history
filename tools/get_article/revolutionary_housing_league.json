It has carried out direct action by squatting in empty buildings. The group is affiliated with Anti-Imperialist Action Ireland.\nHistory\nIn May 2022 a group calling themselves the Revolutionary Workers Union (RWU) began squatting in a building on Eden Quay in Dublin and dubbed it \"James Connolly House\". The building was owned by the Salvation Army and was reportedly being refurbished for use by Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion. The Salvation Army said the refurbishment had to be stopped because of the squatters. The RWU claimed there was no evidence that the building was being refurbished before their arrival. The group claimed to refurbish the building themselves, which they said was derelict, and were operating it as a homeless shelter amongst other uses. In late May, the High Court ruled that the squatters must leave and in early June, after the RWU said they would not abide by the order, they were evicted by the Garda Síochána.\nFollowing their expulsion from Eden Quay in June 2022, the Revolutionary Housing League was created as a separate organisation from the Revolutionary Workers Union.\nIn June 2023, several court hearings were held in relation to a Dublin City property being developed to house the elderly being squatted by the RHL.\nIdeology\nAs part of printed material distributed by RHL during campaigning, the group states that it \"opposes the dominance of vulture funds, Airbnbs and multinationals over Irish housing\". A Socialist and Irish Republican organisation, RHL has stated that \"the housing crisis can not be resolved through the present political system\" and has invoked the phrase \"all right to public property must be subordinated to the public right and welfare\" from the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil in its material.\nRHL is heavily affiliated with another Socialist Irish Republican group called Anti-Imperialist Action Ireland.\nSee also\n* Irish National Land League\n* Community Action Tenants Union\n* Dublin Housing Action Committee\n* Derry Housing Action Committee\n* Landless People's Movement\n* Squatting in Ireland\n* Tenants union\nReferences"
