At UCH, he held training posts, including registrar in radiology. He graduated with the higher MD degree from UCH in 1938.\nIn WWII, Nicholson joined the RAMC. He departed from England in 1941 to serve in Palestine and Egypt as part of a chest surgical team headed by Andrew Logan, who used a multidisciplinary approach to teamwork. Nicholson was promoted to lieutenant colonel before demobilization, when he was appointed registrar and then chief assistant at the Brompton Hospital.}}\nNicholson was elected FRCP in 1949 and was appointed Goulstonian Lecturer in 1950. In the 1950s he was one of the pioneers of antibacterial therapy for tuberculosis. With Clifford Hoyle and other colleagues, he published two of the first papers on long-term combination anti-bacterial therapy for tuberculosis to reduce the relapse rate following conventional short courses.\nNicholson married in 1941. His wife died in 2001. They had no children.\nSelected publications\n*\n*\n*\n*with Clifford Hoyle and J. Dawson:\nReferences"
