It is over }} long and }} wide, extending from King Island in the west to the mainland in the east. The pluton is exposed in }} cliffs along the Dean and Burke channels west of Bella Coola.\nThe King Island Pluton is petrographically similar to the shield volcanoes in the central Anahim Volcanic Belt. As a result, the pluton is thought to represent the magma chamber of an extinct volcanic centre that has since eroded away. At the time of its formation, the pluton was emplaced }} below the surface.\nReferences"
