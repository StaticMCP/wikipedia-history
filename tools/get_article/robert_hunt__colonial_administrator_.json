This soon became an important source of profit.\nThus the Company made an agreement with the merchant Maurice Thompson under which Thompson could use the island as a base in return for 20% of the booty.\nProvidence Island\nIn March 1636 the Company dispatched Captain Robert Hunt on the Blessing to assume the governorship of what was now viewed as a base for privateering.\nHunt was a protege of Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke, and was described as a godly man.\nHe had served with Protestant forces in the Netherlands and at the siege of La Rochelle.\nHis departure was slightly delayed until he could find ministers and men of worth to transport.\nCaptain Hunt was also to be Governor of Cape Gratia de Dios on the Mosquito Coast,\nwhere the English were engaged in trading with the Indians for Camock's Flax.\nThis was to be a refuge for the settlers if the Spanish took Providence Island.\nGiven the threat from the Spanish. Hunt was ordered to ensure the settlers were \"very regmentlie exercised, especially upon the first comeing to p[er]sons to the Island till they be brought to a p[er]fect knowledge of the use of armes.\"\nHunt arrived at Providence in May 1636 with three ships, the Blessing, the Expectation and the Hopewell.\nHis passage and that of his wife and three children was paid, and he received one hundred acres of land with twenty servants to work it, but he was paid no salary.\nAlso, the Company refused to pay for the defence of the island.\nOn the other hand, the colonists were encouraged to engage in privateering, paying the Company one fifth of the value of the plunder.}}\nSoon after Hunt's arrival, the Blessing and Hopewell were dispatched on a raid against Santa Marta under Captain William Rous. The raid was not successful and the force had to surrender.\nNathaniel Butler, a former Governor of Bermuda, replaced Robert Hunt in 1638.  Hunt remained on the island.\nIn July 1638 the company appointed a council of war for the island consisting of Captains Nathaniel Butler, Robert Hunt, Samuel Axe and Andrew Carter, \"the King having permitted the Company to right themselves in hostile manner in the West Indies, upon the ships and goods of Spanish subjects\".\nReferences\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
