The film depicts several patients walking in four directions against a black background before and after treatment.\nMarinescu came to the idea of making the film after having used chronophotography under the influence of Étienne-Jules Marey. Marinescu praised the use of the cinematographic techniques in the scientific investigation.\nOther documentary films\n* A Case of Hysterical Hemiplegia Cured Through Hypnotic Suggestion (1899)\n* Walking Difficulties Due to Progressive Locomotary Ataxia (1900)\n* Pseudo-Hypertrophic or Myosclerotic Paralysis Among Myopathies (1901)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5nzx1_studies-on-human-pathological-locom_shortfilms Walking Troubles of Organic Hemiplegy on Dailymotion]\n* [http://www.victorian-cinema.net/marinescu.htm Dr Gh.
