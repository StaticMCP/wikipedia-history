It is now defunct, as the remainder of the township was incorporated in 1895, when a complete reorganization of the wards took place.\nHistory\nThe area of Toxteth Park was originally a large deer hunting royal park which by the early 17th century had begun to be dis-parked and farmed. As Liverpool expanded during the 19th century the township became increasingly urbanised. Within the municipal borough of Liverpool, the ward structure in the 19th century included wards designated as “North Toxteth” and “South Toxteth”. The former divisions within the borough of Liverpool, up until 1895, were known as North Toxteth and South Toxteth. When the remainder of the township was incorporated in 1895, a complete reorganization of the wards was carried out.\nGeography\nSouth Toxteth comprised the southern portion of the township of Toxteth Park, lying south of areas later defined as “North Toxteth”. Historical maps of 1890 show the south sheet of Liverpool including Toxteth, Dingle and the area around Princes Park. South Toxteth covered the southern portion of the Toxteth Park area, which is now generally associated with parts of modern Toxteth, Princes Park and surrounding streets. Historical plans and 19th-century maps show dense Victorian terraces laid out across the area by the late 1800s, which the same urban expansion that prompted changes to Liverpool’s ward structure. Because the ward was an historical municipal unit, its exact boundaries moved as the borough boundary and internal warding arrangements were changed.\nGovernance\nThe ward elected local councillors / aldermen to Liverpool’s municipal government under the borough arrangements in force at the time. Late-Victorian municipal reform and the inclusion of additional township areas within Liverpool led to an 1890s reorganisation of wards: the former North and South Toxteth arrangement was abandoned in favour of a larger number of more finely divided wards and the borough moved from a small number of large wards to several smaller wards with standardised representation. Following subsequent 20th- and 21st-century boundary reviews the names and borders of Liverpool wards changed many times. The neighbourhood that was once covered by South Toxteth now lies within modern wards such as Toxteth/Princes Park and adjacent divisions established by later reviews.\nElections\n1835\nPolling place : At the southernmost of the Shops recently built by Dr. Hughes, on the west side of Park-road.\n1836\n1837\n1838\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Time\n! colspan=\"2\" | John Cropper\n! colspan=\"2\" | Thomas Murray Gladstone\n|-\n!
