The house was built between 1931 and 1933, and consists of a 1 to -story, five-bay, Classical Revival style main block with a four-part plan. The attached sections are a one-story pantry and kitchen wing and garage attached by a four-bay arcade. The main block features a prominent two-story, four-bay, pedimented portico has four extraordinary fluted Tower of the Winds columns. Also on the property are the contributing Italianate style brick stable (c. 1847); a brick smokehouse; and an agent's cottage, tile barn, corn house, spring house and summerhouse built between 1928 and 1930; garage with servants' quarters, greenhouse, log cabin, potato house, pump house, chicken house and field shed built between 1931 and 1945; the mansion landscape and scene of the 1881 duel; and a windmill. In September 1881, it was the site of one of the last four duels in Virginia, prior to enactment of anti-duel legislation in 1882.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.\nReferences"
