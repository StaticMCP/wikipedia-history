It was released by Activision, alongside the console versions of the game, in November 2008. The game takes place during World War II and features many elements of gameplay typical to the series, including vehicular missions and the usage of iron sights.\nGameplay\nGameplay and controls in World at War remain similar to Modern Warfare. The directional pad controls movement. The touch screen is utilized for aiming, as well as switching and reloading weapons, and several minigames. The shoulder buttons are used to fire whatever weapon is equipped. The player double-taps the touch screen, or taps an icon on the touch screen, to go in and out of \"aim-down sight\" mode, which uses the weapon's iron sights to aim more accurately.\nThe game includes a campaign with a series of missions based in World War II's Pacific Ocean theater of World War II and Eastern front with American, British and Soviet campaigns. Missions are chronological and often sequential. World at War offers a quick play mode that lets the player access any mission they have won in the campaign.\nWorld at War features console-style achievements, where the player receives an award for accomplishing a specific feat during gameplay, such as finishing a campaign or killing a certain number of enemies. There are also \"collectables\", star-shaped pickups, hidden in each mission. A challenge mode exists in which the player must complete a level segment in a limited time while fulfilling special goals such as scoring a certain number of grenade and melee kills.\nCompared to the previous title developed by N-Space, World at War had improved in-level geometry, more responsive sprints and crouches, and 3D-modeled iron sights. The game runs at 30 frames per second.\nThere are several \"minigames\" based on real tasks undertaken in the field. Touchscreen-based minigames place the player in charge of defusing mines, sending Morse code radio messages, and bandaging wounded allies, as well as rotating wheels to aim mortar and artillery weapons. The player mans additional emplacements including machine-gun turrets and anti-aircraft guns. There is a parachuting segment of one mission. There are also tank levels in which player controls the tank's turret and machine-gun.\nWorld at War includes online multiplayer as well as local multiplayer.\n| ONM = 83%\n| GMaster = 82%\n| 1UP = A\n| IGN = 8.3/10\n| GameZone = 8/10\n| GSpot = 8/10\n| NG = 78%\n| GRadar = 7/10\n| EuroG = 8/10\n| MC = 75/100\n}}\nThe Nintendo DS version received an average score of 75 out of 100 based on 12 reviews on Metacritic, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nIGN scored Call of Duty: World at War version at 8.3/10, praising elements including a surprising level of complexity for the hardware, \"impressive sound production all around\", fun gameplay and great multiplayer.
