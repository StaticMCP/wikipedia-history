The small  island is the smallest of a cluster of delta islands including Eucalyptus Island, Widdows Island, Victoria Island, and Coney Island, adjacent to Clifton Court Forebay. At  above sea level with the surrounding waters kept a bay by a levee system, the island is accessible only by the one road from the Clifton Court levee or by boat. It appears on a 1978 United States Geological Survey map of the area.\n}}\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110128195901/http://kingsisland-ca.com/ Kings Island Community website]"
