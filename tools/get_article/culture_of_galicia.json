      "text": "# Culture of Galicia\n\nThe culture of Galicia encompasses the customs, practices, artistic expressions, and social norms associated with the Galician people of northwestern Spain. It is characterized by a distinct language (Galician), a rich tradition of music featuring the gaita (bagpipe), and a cultural heritage with historical connections to Celtic traditions. Mythology and folklore are significant parts of Galician culture, featuring figures such as Breogán, the legendary founder; the Mouros, associated with ancient sites; and the meigas, or witches. Important traditions include Entroido, the Galician equivalent of Carnival; and the numerous local \"festas\" or festivals, often centered around religious or agricultural cycles. Galicia also has a distinctive cuisine, architecture (including the characteristic \"hórreos\" or granaries), and a strong sense of regional identity.\nLiterature\n(13th century),[https://archive.org/stream/spanishgalicia00bellrich#page/162/mode/2up translation by Aubrey F. G. Bell]\n|align  = left\n}}\nAs with many other Romance languages, Galician-Portuguese emerged as a literary language in the Middle Ages, during the 12th-13th century, when a rich lyric tradition developed. However, in the face of the hegemony of Castilian Spanish, during the so-called Séculos Escuros (\"Dark Centuries\"), from 1530 to 1800, it fell from major literary or legal use, revived again during the 19th century Rexurdimento with such writers as Rosalía de Castro, Manuel Murguía,  , and Eduardo Pondal. In the 20th century, before the Spanish Civil War the Irmandades da Fala (\"Brotherhood of the Language\") and Grupo Nós included such writers as Vicente Risco,  and Castelao; the Seminario de Estudos Galegos promoted the study of the language. Public use of Galician was largely suppressed in Francoist Spain but has been resurgent since the restoration of democracy. Contemporary Writers in Galician include Xosé Luís Méndez Ferrín, Manuel Rivas, and Suso de Toro.\nCuisine\n]]\nPolbo á feira\nGalician cuisine often uses fish and shellfish. The empanada is a meat or fish pie, with a bread-like base, top and crust with the meat or fish filling usually being in a tomato sauce including onions and garlic. Caldo galego is a hearty soup whose main ingredients are potatoes and a local vegetable named grelo (Broccoli rabe). The latter is also employed in Lacón con grelos, a typical carnival dish, consisting of pork shoulder boiled with grelos, potatoes and chorizo. Centolla is the equivalent of King Crab. It is prepared by being boiled alive, having its main body opened like a shell, and then having its innards mixed vigorously. Another popular dish is octopus, boiled (traditionally in a copper pot) and served in a wooden plate, cut into small pieces and laced with olive oil, sea salt and pimentón (Spanish paprika). This dish is called Pulpo a la gallega or in Galician \"Polbo á Feira\", which roughly translates as \"Galician-style Octopus\". There are several regional varieties of cheese. The best-known one is the so-called tetilla, named after its breast-like shape. Other highly regarded varieties include the San Simón cheese from Vilalba and the creamy cheese produced in the Arzúa-Curtis area. The latter area produces also high-quality beef. A classical dessert is filloas'', crêpe-like pancakes made with flour, broth or milk, and eggs. When cooked at a pig slaughter festival, they may also contain the animal's blood. A famous almond cake called Tarta de Santiago (St. James' cake) is a Galician sweet speciality mainly produced in Santiago de Compostela.\nGalicia has 30 products with Denominación de orixe (D.O.), some of them with Denominación de Origen Protegida (D.O.P.). D.O. and D.O.P. are part of a system of regulation of quality and geographical origin among Spain's finest producers. Galicia produces a number of high-quality wines, including Albariño, Ribeiro, Ribeira Sacra,   Monterrei and Valdeorras. The grape varieties used are local and rarely found outside Galicia and Northern Portugal. Just as notably from Galicia comes the spirit Aguardente—the name means burning water—often referred to as Orujo in Spain and internationally or as caña in Galicia. This spirit is made from the distillation of the pomace of grapes.\nSport\nAs in the rest of Spain, football is the most popular sport in Galicia. Deportivo de La Coruña, from the city of A Coruña, is the region's most successful club. Celta de Vigo, from Vigo, are also a major club and are Deportivo's principal regional rivals. When the two sides play, it is referred to as the Galician derby. SD Compostela from Santiago de Compostela and Racing Ferrol from Ferrol are two other notable club sides. Similarly to Catalonia and the Basque Country, Galicia also periodically fields a regional team against the international opposition (see Galicia autonomous football team).\nOther popular sports in Galicia include futsal (a variety of indoor football), handball and basketball. Galicia is also noted for a great tradition of maritime sports, both sea and river-based - sports such as rowing, yachting, canoeing and surfing.  Gaelic football is also a growing sport in the region, with multiple teams from Galicia playing in GAA Europe competitions.\nContemporary music\n]]\nPop and rock\n*Los Suaves: hard rock/heavy metal band active since the early 1980s, from Ourense\n*Deluxe: pop/rock band from A Coruña led by Xoel López\n*Los Limones: indie rock/indie pop/post-rock group from Ferrol led by Ferrol born Santi Santos, active since the early '80s\n*Siniestro Total: punk rock band\n*Os Resentidos: led by Antón Reixa in the 1980s\n*Heredeiros da Crus: rock band singing in Galician language\n*Triángulo de Amor Bizarro: indie rock/noise pop/post-punk band\nFolk and traditionally based music\n*Luar na Lubre: a band inspired by traditional Galician Celtic music.
