It was a proxy battle of World War I and the Second Saud-Rashidi War between the British-supported Saudis and the Ottoman-supported Rashidis.\nRashidi forces led by young Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Rashid defeated the forces of Ibn Saud. The main significance of the battle was the death of Ibn Saud's British Military Advisor, Captain William Shakespear. The reason for the defeat of Ibn Saud's forces is given by both Arabic and British sources as the withdrawal of the Ajman tribe led by Dhaydan bin Hithlain from the battlefield.\nThe defeat and the death of William Shakespear diminished the relationship between Ibn Saud and the British changing the course of the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. It also resulted other negative conclusions for Ibn Saud, including a year-long struggle with the Ajman tribe, namely the Battle of Kanzan, and the decrease in his newly emerged prestige.\nSee also\n* List of wars involving Saudi Arabia\nReferences\nLiterature\n*Travellers in Arabia, Eid Al Yahya, Stacey International (2006).
