It marked the first time in the history of the awards that the winner of the Gold Logie did not personally accept the statuette. Wendt was required to stay in the Sydney-based studios after the end of A Current Affair for an extended period to be able to cover any late breaking stories for time zones that would normally get ACA on a delay. TV Week claimed that they knew about a week in advance, three weeks after Wendt had posed with her fellow Gold Logie nominees for a TV Week photo shoot, that she may be missing from the awards presentation. Nine Network executives were said to be able to work around the challenges of ACAs production schedule if TV Week could assure them that Wendt was going to win the Gold. TV Week chose not to disclose that information to Nine, citing \"the interests of maintaining the integrity and security of the Logies\". The offer of a specially arranged flight to get Wendt from Sydney to Melbourne after ACA in time to witness the announcement of the Gold Logie winner was not enough to sway Nine's executives. Wendt's Gold Logie was ultimately accepted by Nine's head of current affairs at the time, Peter Meakin.\nReception\nWriting for The Sydney Morning Herald, Peter Luck gave the ceremony a mixed to negative review, calling it \"the pits.\" He wrote \"The setting was ordinary, the jokes were bad – and cruel to boot (even about the network that was putting them on) – and the entertainment was abysmal.\" Luck singled out Dannii Minogue's performance, which he thought might have been hampered by a sound problem, and a comedy routine with Magda Szubanski and actor Dennis Waterman as examples of how bad he thought the entertainment was. Luck believed the Logies had chosen the winners well though, citing Wendt, Byrnes, McTernan and Four Corners as deserving of their accolades.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
