We wrote it in a day after a big night in Los Angeles. It's about waking up to something that feels unexpectedly right.\"\nIn July 2025, the song was certified 2× platinum in Australia.\nReception\nAAA Backstage said \"'Waking Up Easy' is a little acoustic number filled with enough reverb and sparkly production to bring on those summertime vibes. Perfectly paired with some seriously chilled out and mellow vibes, the song is captures the feeling of waking up after a big night.\"\nCertifications\nReferences"
