The category was established at the 1st Children's and Family Emmy Awards in 2022 and is a sister category to the Children's and Family Emmy Award for Outstanding Young Teen Series and the Children's and Family Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's or Family Viewing Series, which target shows aimed at older audiences.\nThe inaugural winner of the award was Sesame Street, which also leads in overall nominations, with three. It is followed by ''Blue's Clues & You! and Waffles + Mochi'' which each have two nominations respectively.\nDue to a consistent lack of submissions since it's inception, the category was discontinued after the 3rd Children's and Family Emmy Awards. It has been merged with the Outstanding Children's or Family Viewing Series category as of the 2026 ceremony.\nBackground\nOn November 17, 2021, the NATAS announced the creation of the Children's and Family Emmy Awards to recognize the best in children's and family television. The organization cited an \"explosive growth in the quantity and quality of children’s and family programming\" as justification for a dedicated ceremony. Many categories of the awards were previously presented at the Daytime Emmy Awards. Programming aimed towards children and young adults was honored from 1974 to 2021 with the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Series, which was presented under various names across its lifespan, and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program, which was presented from 1950 to 2020. Following the establishment of the Children's and Family Emmy Awards, both categories were discontinued.\nWinners and nominations\n2020s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n!
