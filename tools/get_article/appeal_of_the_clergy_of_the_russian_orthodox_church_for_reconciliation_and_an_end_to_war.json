      "text": "# Appeal of the Clergy of the Russian Orthodox Church for Reconciliation and an End to War\n\n| organizers = Nearly 300 priests and deacons of the Moscow Patriarchate\n}}\nIn 2022, 233 priests and deacons from the Moscow Patriarchate have collectively petitioned Patriarch Kirill for reconciliation and an immediate ceasefire in the Ukrainian war. The appeal, timed just after the Sunday of the Last Judgement, emphasized the inevitability of divine judgment, expressed sorrow for the suffering in Ukraine, and called for the safe return of soldiers. The clergy advocates for bridging divides, respecting human freedom, and choosing peace independently. They caution against the consequences of ignoring pleas for peace and emphasize the importance of dialogue. The appeal concludes with a call to embrace Great Lent in the spirit of faith, hope, and love. Additionally, the Orthodox  Peace Fellowship is actively involved in peace efforts and invites support for their initiatives.\nReferences\nExternal links\n[https://belarus2020.churchby.info/appeal-of-clergy-of-the-russian-orthodox-church-for-reconciliation-and-ending-the-war/ Full text of clergy letter]"
