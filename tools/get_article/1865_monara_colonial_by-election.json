No poll was required as William Grahame was the only candidate nominated. The by-election was triggered by the resignation of James Martin. At the 1864–65 New South Wales colonial election, Martin had been defeated at elections for East Sydney (22 November), Tumut (10 December) and Wellington (21 December), before being elected to both Monara (24 December) and The Lachlan (28 December). Martin chose to resign from Monara.\nDates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Date !!
