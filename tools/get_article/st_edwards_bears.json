Although they share a name with St Edward's College, East Gosford, the Bears operate as an independent community club and are not administered by the college.\nHistory\nThe club was founded in 1970 and initially competed as a junior rugby league organisation. St Edwards quickly became one of the leading junior clubs on the Central Coast, winning the junior club championship in 1971 and again in 1972, 1973 and 1974.\nFor much of its history the club fielded multiple junior teams across the local Central Coast competition. Over time the junior program declined, and the club eventually ceased entering junior sides.\nSenior team\nIn 2013 the club entered a team in the Open Age competition for the first time. Following the discontinuation of the junior program, the Open Age side became the club’s sole remaining team. The senior squad is largely composed of former St Edward’s College students and past juniors who continue to represent the club and maintain its identity.\nSince the inception of the senior side, the Bears have appeared in four Open Age Grand Finals, though they were unsuccessful in each attempt. The team was coached during this period by Mark Churcher, who led the side during all four Grand Final campaigns.\nAs of 2025, the team is captain-coached by Dale Wilson.\nClub structure and identity\nThe Bears do not operate with a permanent clubhouse or dedicated home ground, instead utilising available fields within the Central Coast competition schedule. Despite this, the club has retained a continuous presence in the local rugby league community through its senior team. The club's traditional colours are red and black.\nHonours\n* Junior Club Champions (7): 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 2014, 2018, 2019\n* Under 16 (2): 1994, 1997\n* Under 16 Division 2 (1): 2005\n* Under 10 Division 3 (1): 2014\n* Under 14 Division 3 (1): 2018\n* Under 15 Division 3 (1): 2019\nSee also\n* List of NSW Central Coast Rugby League First Grade Premiers\nHistory\nThe club was founded in 1970 and initially competed as a junior rugby league organisation.
