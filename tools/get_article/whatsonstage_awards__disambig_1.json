The awards celebrate outstanding achievements in UK theatre, with categories covering both regional productions and shows in London's West End.\nDistinctive among major theatre honours in the UK, the WhatsOnStage Awards are decided entirely by public vote. Theatre audiences nominate and select the winners, making the awards a reflection of popular opinion rather than industry panels or critics.\nThe ceremony is typically held each year in February or March. From 2012 to 2023, it took place at the Prince of Wales Theatre. Since 2024, the event has been hosted at The London Palladium, owned and run by Andrew Lloyd Webber.\nThe awards are currently produced by Alex Wood and Darius Thompson (for WhatsOnStage) with co-producers Alex Parker and Damian Sandys.\nHistory\nThe origins of the WhatsOnStage Awards date back to early 2001, when WhatsOnStage invited its readers to vote online for their preferred winners of that year’s Laurence Olivier Awards. Within two weeks, over 5,000 people participated, with the public’s choices diverging significantly from those of the official Olivier judging panel. Encouraged by the strong response, the site’s editors created independent shortlists for the 2002 awards. In 2003, WhatsOnStage hosted its first launch event to announce the shortlists to an audience of approximately 200 theatre industry guests. The awards continued to evolve, and in 2008, the first full-scale concert and ceremony was introduced to formally celebrate the winners.\nSince 2023, WhatsOnStage adopted more inclusive awards by replacing gender-specific categories such as \"Best Actor\" and \"Best Actress\" with the gender-neutral \"Best Performer\" categories, reflecting a broader commitment to inclusivity in recognising performance talent.\nJudging\nEach year thousands of theatregoers submit nominations online across more than 20 award categories. The official nominations are revealed at a high-profile launch event, typically held in early December.\nPublic voting then opens and continues through to the end of January. During the 2012–2013 awards season, over 60,000 theatre fans participated in the voting process, with leading contenders in several categories shifting frequently as votes were cast.\nCeremony\n2025 (The Silver Anniversary Concert)\nThe 2025 WhatsOnStage Awards concert and ceremony were held on 9 February 2025 at the London Palladium and were hosted by Gina Murray and Mazz Murray.\n2024\nThe 2024 WhatsOnStage Awards concert and ceremony were held on 11 February 2024 at the London Palladium and were hosted by Bonnie Langford and Melanie La Barrie.\n2023\nThe 2023 WhatsOnStage Awards concert and ceremony were held on 12 February 2023 at the Prince of Wales Theatre and were hosted by Courtney Bowman, Laurie Kynaston and Billy Luke Nevers.\n2022\nThe 2022 WhatsOnStage Awards concert and ceremony were held on 27 February 2022 at the Prince of Wales Theatre and were hosted by Jodie Prenger and Tom Read Wilson.\n2021\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2021 WhatsOnStage Awards were held virtually. They did not honour creatives as they traditionally did but instead recognised 21 members of the public who had supported the theatre industry during the pandemic.\n2020\nThe 2020 WhatsOnStage Awards concert and ceremony took place on 1 March 2020 at the Prince of Wales Theatre and were hosted by Jodie Prenger and Tom Read Wilson. The event was broadcast live on BBC Radio 2, hosted by Elaine Paige and Paddy O'Connell.\n2019\nThe 2019 WhatsOnStage Awards concert and ceremony took place on 3 March 2019 at the Prince of Wales Theatre and were hosted by Vicky Vox and Kobna Holdbrook-Smith.\n2018\nThe 2018 WhatsOnStage Awards concert and ceremony took place on 25 February 2018 at the Prince of Wales Theatre and were hosted by Simon Lipkin and Vikki Stone.\n2017\nThe 2017 WhatsOnStage Awards concert and ceremony took place on 19 February 2017 at the Prince of Wales Theatre and were hosted by Simon Lipkin and Vikki Stone.\n2016\nThe 2016 WhatsOnStage Awards concert and ceremony took place on 21 February at the Prince of Wales Theatre and were hosted by Mel Giedroyc and Steve Furst.\n2015\nThe 2015 WhatsOnStage Awards concert and ceremony took place on 15 February at the Prince of Wales Theatre and were hosted by Mel Giedroyc and Steve Furst.\n2014\nThe 2014 WhatsOnStage Awards concert and ceremony took place on 22 February at the Prince of Wales Theatre and were hosted by Stephen Fry and Julian Clary.\n2013\nThe 2013 WhatsOnStage Awards concert and ceremony took place on 18 February at the Palace Theatre and were hosted by Mel Giedroyc and Rufus Hound.\n2012\nThe 2012 WhatsOnStage Awards concert and ceremony took place on 20 February at the Prince of Wales Theatre and were hosted by Sheridan Smith, Alan Davies and Jenny Eclair.\n2011\nThe 2011 WhatsOnStage Awards concert and ceremony took place on 19 February at the Prince of Wales Theatre and were hosted by Sheridan Smith, Christopher Biggins and Miranda Hart.\n2010\nThe 2010 WhatsOnStage Awards concert and ceremony took place on 14 February at the Prince of Wales Theatre and were hosted by Christopher Biggins and Mel Giedroyc.\n2009\nThe 2009 WhatsOnStage Awards concert and ceremony took place on 15 February at the Prince of Wales Theatre and were hosted by James Corden and Sheridan Smith.\n2008\nThe 2008 WhatsOnStage Awards concert and ceremony took place on 22 February at the Lyric Theatre and were hosted by James Corden and Sheridan Smith.\nVenues\nThe inaugural WhatsOnStage Awards launch party was held at The Venue, before relocating to the Dominion Theatre in 2004. In 2005 and 2006, the event took place at Planet Hollywood, followed by a move to Café de Paris, where it was held annually—with the exception of 2009, when the launch was hosted at the London Hippodrome as part of a campaign to preserve the venue as a performance space.\nThe first full-scale WhatsOnStage Awards concert and ceremony was introduced in 2008 at the 960-seat Lyric Theatre. In 2009, the event moved to the larger 1,100-seat Prince of Wales Theatre, where it sold out for four consecutive years from 2009 to 2012. The 2013 ceremony was held at the Palace Theatre, but the event returned to the Prince of Wales Theatre in 2014. Since 2024, the WhatsOnStage Awards have been staged at The London Palladium.\nCurrent Award Categories\nPerformance categories\n* Best Performer in a Play\n* Best Performer in a Musical\n* Best
