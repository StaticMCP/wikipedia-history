It was released on 24 March 2008 as a limited edition 7\" single and digital download.\nThe b-side to \"Century\", \"The Unbearable Lightness of Buildings\", was written specifically for Tate Modern as part of their 12-week-long Tate Tracks that was held at the beginning of April 2007.[https://www.nme.com/news/the-long-blondes/27514 The Long Blondes to debut new material | News | NME.COM] The idea was Tate invited The Long Blondes to walk around the gallery and find a work of art that would inspire them to write a track. In the end, it was Jannis Kounellis's Untitled that grabbed their attention. They said \"Untitled caught our eye because we saw the stark industrial landscape and pictured ourselves within it\".[http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/tatetracks/longblondes_kounellis.shtm Tate | Tate Tracks]\nTrack listing\n:A: \"Century\"\n:B: \"The Unbearable Lightness of Buildings\"\nAll lyrics written by Kate Jackson and Dorian Cox, music by The Long Blondes.\nReferences"
