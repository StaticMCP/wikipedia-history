The agency is a member of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).\nHistory\nThe agency moved from its previous office at 841 Silver Lake Blvd in Dover, Delaware to its current office at 1351 West North Street in Denver in 2019.\nIn 2022, the Department of Insurance released a study in conjunction with the Consumer Federation of America (CFA) that found that some auto insurance companies charge women up to 21% more in premium costs compared to men. The findings led to Kyle Evans Gay, a member of the Delaware Senate, to introduce a bill that would outlaw insurance companies in the state from considering gender when charging drivers.\nLeadership\nThe agency is led by the Delaware Insurance Commissioner, an elected office in the U.S. State of Delaware. The current Delaware Insurance Commissioner is Democrat Trinidad Navarro, who was re-elected to a second consecutive term in office in the 2020 election.\nFormer Insurance Commissioners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!Name\n!Political Party\n!# of Terms Served\n!Date First Elected\n!Date Assumed Office\n!Final Day in Office\n|-\n|Trinidad Navarro\n|Democrat\n|2\n|November 8, 2016\n|January 3, 2017\n|Still in office\n|-\n|Karen Weldin Stewart\n|Democrat\n|2\n|November 4, 2008\n|January 4, 2009\n|January 3, 2017\n|-\n|Matthew Denn\n|Democrat\n|1\n|November 2, 2004\n|January 4, 2005\n|January 4, 2009\n|-\n|Donna Lee Harpster Williams\n|Republican\n|3\n|November 3, 1992\n|January 5, 1993\n|January 4, 2005\n|-\n|David N.
