The park was part of the U.S. Headquarters Command Center for the Marshall Islands, which was responsible for administering the Marshall Islands following World War II. It was located next to the main U.S. airfield on the atoll until 1971, when a new airfield opened; it then became a collection point for World War II artifacts. The park includes weaponry and vehicles, such as Zeros and large ammunition pieces, from throughout the islands.\nThe park was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on September 30, 1976. At the time, the Marshall Islands were part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.\nReferences"
