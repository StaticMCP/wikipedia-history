It is located in the northernmost row of the city's five rows of squares, on Habersham Street and East St. Julian Street. It is east of Reynolds Square, west of Washington Square and north of Columbia Square. The oldest building on the square is the Spencer–Woodbridge House, at 22 Habersham Street, which dates to 1790. The Lincoln Street Parking Garage occupies the entire western side of the square.\nThe square was laid out in 1791 and is named for General Joseph Warren, a Revolutionary War hero killed at the Battle of Bunker Hill and who had served as president of the Provincial Government of Massachusetts.  British gunpowder seized by Savannahians had been sent to aid the Americans at Bunker Hill. The \"sister city\" relationship between Savannah and Boston survived even the Civil War, and Bostonians sent shiploads of provisions to Savannah shortly after the city surrendered to General Sherman in 1864.\nDedication\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
