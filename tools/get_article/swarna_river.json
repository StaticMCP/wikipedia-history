      "text": "# Swarna River\n\nSwarna River (also spelled Suvarna River) is a river located in the Udupi district of Karnataka, India. It is a west-flowing river that originates in the Western Ghats and empties into the Arabian Sea. There is one CWC Hydrological Observation Station at Yennehole on this river.\nCourse\nThe Swarna River originates in the foothills of the Western Ghats and flows westward through several villages, including Yennehole Perdoor, Hiriadka, Parkala, Manipal, Perampalli, and Uppoor, before reaching its confluence with the Arabian Sea near Kodi Bengre. It covers a distance of approximately 55 kilometers.\nHydrology\nThe Swarna River is primarily rain-fed and experiences peak flow during the monsoon season, typically from June to September. The river has tributaries, including the Yennehole and Kaud Hole, which merge to form the main river.\nDams and water supply\nThree dams have been constructed along the Swarna River, one at Yennehole village, the second at Hiriyadka and the third at Shiroor. The first dam- constructed in Yennehole- is providing water supply for agriculture and drinking to nearby villages like Hermunde, Ajekar and Yennehole. Another two dams are crucial for supplying drinking water to Udupi City and the surrounding areas. The river also supports agriculture, particularly rice and coconut farming, in the region.\nEcological and environmental aspects\nThe river supports a diverse ecosystem, including a variety of aquatic life and vegetation along its banks. However, concerns over pollution and reduced water levels have been raised due to increasing urbanization and deforestation in the catchment area. Conservation efforts have been initiated to maintain the river's ecological balance.\nTourism and cultural significance\nThe Swarna River is an important geographical feature in the Udupi district and contributes to local tourism. The End Point in Manipal offers a scenic view of the river, attracting visitors. At Kodi Bengre, the river forms an estuary before meeting the Arabian Sea, creating a picturesque landscape that is popular among tourists and local fishermen.\nSee also\n* Udupi district\n* Western Ghats\n* Arabian Sea\n* List of rivers of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts\nReferences"
