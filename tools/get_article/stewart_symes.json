Symes took part in the Battle of Rooiwal and was stationed for a while in Potchefstroom.  He later stayed briefly in the town of Hermanus which he described as \"peaceful.\" Later that year he was posted in the Aden Hinterland, where he served 1903–1904. He is said to have been the only British army officer to be awarded a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for services in the hinterland.\nHe was Governor of the Palestine North District from 1920 to 1925, Chief Secretary to the Government of Palestine from 1925 to 1928, Resident at Aden from 1928 to 1931, Governor of Tanganyika from 1931 to 1934 and Governor-General of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan from 1934 to 1940. During his time in Tanganyika he gained a reputation for governing in the interest of the indigenous African population. This led to him becoming unpopular with some of the white settlers in that country and in neighboring Kenya, and he was known as being one of the most \"pro-African\" colonial governors.\nOn every issue in which there was conflict between indigenous Africans and European settlers he governed in favor of the Africans. On multiple occasions he had European settlers deported from the country on the grounds they were mistreating Africans. There were British District Commissioners who were administrators under previous governors, and during their time in Tanganyika had learned to speak the Tongwe and Bende languages before being rotated out, Symes had them recalled to Tanganyika and stationed in areas that spoke Tongwe and Bende. He also devoted government resources towards water purification projects, literacy programs and the administration of antibiotics to natives.\nOn numerous issues he promoted encouraging the native population to vote on matters that affected them.  He also insisted, as did his predecessor, that Africans be paid the same wages as Europeans and Indians for the same work. When asked in the 1950s if he supported African independence movements he said that he did.\nReferences\n* Symes, Stewart.
