She appeared on twelve posters, of which a total of 94 million copies were distributed.\nShe was born in Wabash, Indiana and graduated from Wabash High School in 1937. She then attended Indiana University Bloomington. She became a model and appeared in about 20 RKO movies, often in uncredited roles. Among her roles was that of Marjorie Forrester, Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve's niece, in ''Gildersleeve's Ghost''.\nIn addition to appearing in the posters, Stewart toured the U.S. as one of the four members of a group called the Bondbardiers, accompanied by various Hollywood stars, to sell war bonds. In 1945, she toured Europe and was one of the first civilians to enter Germany after the end of the war. Her appearance in London's Hyde Park \"caused gridlock.\"\nModeling\nDescribed as \"the U.S. military's official pinup\" during World War II, Stewart worked as a model for posters to boost the morale of men in the United States armed forces during that war. A 1943 news brief noted, \"Though she quit as a poster model to become a movie starlet ... Margie Stewart will ... appear on two special posters to be circulated by the army among overseas troops -- for morale effect.\" In 1944, Stewart was described in a photo caption as \"credited with being the favorite poster girl of men in the U.S. Army.\" She also posed for posters on the home front, \"promoting everything from war bonds to security.\"\nShe once estimated that more than 94 million of her posters were distributed worldwide during the war.\nLater life\nStewart and her husband lived in Studio City, California, and produced concerts at the Hollywood Bowl. She also did volunteer work at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center.\nPersonal life\nIn 1945, she married Jerry Jeroske, an army captain. The Jeroskes later changed their last name to Johnson. They had one child, Stephen, and three grandchildren. Jerry Johnson died in 2003.\nDeath\nStewart died of pneumonia on April 26, 2012, at a hospital in Burbank, California.\nFilmography\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year !! Title !! Role !!
