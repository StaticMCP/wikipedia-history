It is currently the dominant party in the state, and has been for almost all of its history. It currently holds Utah's entire congressional delegation, all statewide executive offices, and supermajorities in both state legislative chambers.\nHistory\nThe state of Utah politics was reorganized after the 1890 Manifesto led by Wilford Woodruff. The 1890 Manifesto officially ended the traditionally Mormon practice of Polygamy. Many prominent polygamist Mormons were imprisoned, punished and harassed since the 1890 Manifesto prohibited plural marriage. This action granted the Utah Territory statehood in 1896 on the condition that polygamy was banned in the state constitution. The Republican Frank J. Cannon was the first delegate elected to congress by the state of Utah in 1894.\nAlthough Utah was generally considered a Democratic-leaning area (or an area that would lean Democratic) before statehood, the state of Utah rapidly gained overwhelming support for the Republican Party after 1896. Although the Republican Party had been strongly opposed to polygamy since its inception and had played a major part in abolishing polygamy, the Republican U.S. Senator Reed Smoot rose to political power. Smoot led a political alliance of Mormons and non-Mormons that created a strong Republican party in many parts of the state.\nThe Republican Party is currently dominant in Utah politics: no Democrat has won statewide office since 1996, when Jan Graham was elected attorney general; and when Mia Love replaced Jim Matheson in congress in 2014, Utah's congressional delegation became all-Republican. When Love lost her seat to Ben McAdams in the 2018 election, Democrats regained one of Utah's four seats. After the 2020 election Ben McAdams lost his seat to Burgess Owens and Utah's congressional delegation became all-Republican again.\nCurrent elected officials\nThe Utah Republican Party controls all five statewide offices and holds a supermajority in the Utah House of Representatives and the Utah State Senate. Republicans also hold both of the state's U.S. Senate seats and all four of the state's U.S. House seats.\nMembers of Congress\nU.S. Senate\nFile:Mike Lee, official portrait (cropped).jpg|Senior U.S. Senator\nFile:Senator John Curtis Official Portrait (cropped).jpg|Junior U.S. Senator\nU.S. House of Representatives\n*UT-1st: Blake Moore\n*UT-2nd: Celeste Maloy\n*UT-3rd: Mike Kennedy\n*UT-4th: Burgess Owens\nStatewide offices\n*Governor: Spencer Cox\n*Lieutenant Governor: Deidre Henderson\n*Attorney General: Derek Brown\n*State Treasurer: Marlo Oaks\n*State Auditor: Tina Cannon\nState Legislature\n*President of the Senate: J.

The state party officers are elected for a term of two (2) years.\nCentral Committee\nThe State Central Committee (SCC) has representatives from every county in Utah.  Along with the automatic members, each county chair and vice-chair, counties are allocated representative based on the number of voting republicans in that county.  These representatives are chosen in elections which take place in the Republican county conventions held in odd-numbered years.\nAuxiliaries\nThe Utah Republican Party has seven (7) registered auxiliaries. This list includes: Utah Elephant Club, Utah Federation of Republican Women, Utah Young Republicans, Utah Federation of College Republicans, Utah Native American Caucus, Utah Republican Women's Liberty Caucus, and Utah Republican Veterans' Caucus.\nUtah Federation of College Republicans\nThe Utah Federation of College Republicans (UFCR) is a state-level organization in Utah that oversees College Republican chapters at colleges and universities across the state. It is affiliated with the College Republicans of America (CRA), a national organization established in 2023, and works to promote conservative values, support Republican candidates, and engage college students in political activism. The UFCR operates as an official auxiliary of the Utah Republican Party, it collaborates closely with the state party to advance shared goals.\nThe UFCR holds chapters at Brigham Young University, University of Utah, Utah State University, Weber State University, and more.\nElection results\nPresidential\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Utah Republican Party presidential election results\n!Election\n!Presidential ticket\n!Votes\n!Vote %\n!Electoral votes\n!Result\n|-\n|1896\n|William McKinley/Garret Hobart\n|13,491\n|17.27%\n|}}\n|\n|-\n|1900\n|William McKinley/Theodore Roosevelt\n|47,139\n|50.65%\n|}}\n|\n|-\n|1904\n|Theodore Roosevelt/Charles W.

In 2014 the state legislature passed SB54 which created a pathway by which candidates from all parties in Utah could bypass the nominating conventions and qualify directly for the primary ballot by collecting a required number of signatures.\nSB54 forced the parties in Utah to have open primaries, among other demands.  The SCC directed its party chairman, James Evans, to file a lawsuit, which sought, among other things, to overturn the use of open primaries.  The Utah Republican Party prevailed on this point, which required the state elections office to defer to the Utah Republican Party as to whether the primary would be open or closed and whether unaffiliated voters would be eligible to sign ballot-access petitions for Republican candidates.\nThe party filed two more lawsuits to try to overturn SB54's signature path to the ballot, but lost those cases.  They appealed to the 10th Circuit Court which upheld the lower courts ruling and a subsequent appeal to the US Supreme Court was denied.\nState Party Caucuses\nParty Caucuses are held every two years in Utah.\nCounty party organizations\nEach of Utah's 29 counties has a party organization, which operates within that county and sends delegates to the State Central Committee.\n{|class=wikitable\n!
