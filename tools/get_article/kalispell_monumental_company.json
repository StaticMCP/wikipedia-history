It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.\nIt was built to serve as a tombstone and monument retail company store, as a branch of Spokane's Sammis\nMonumental Company.  Because it would receive and process marble and other stone blocks, being located next to a railway was necessary.\nIt was designed by Kalispell architect Joseph Gibson and was built at cost of $12,000.\nIt later served as Main Street Motors and as Glory Day Emporium.\nReferences"
