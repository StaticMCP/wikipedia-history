The Kuruc army was defeated in the battle. Although the Austrian army retired to Austria after the battle, the Kuruc positions in Transdanubia remained uncertain until 1705 because of the fiasco near Koroncó.\nPrelude\nGeneral Simon Forgách had invaded Transdanubia in May 1704. General Sándor Károlyi won the battle of Smolenice and  defeated the Danish auxiliaries in the battle of Biskupice. In addition the Kuruc forces raided in Austria, Moravia and Styria.\nDuring these operations, the Kuruc forces tried to liberate Transdanubia and oust the Austrian army from Hungary. Two Kuruc armies und Forgách and under Károlyi operated near the Rába and Danube rivers. Károlyi and Forgách sought to unite and join forces to beat the army of Sigbert Heister. Vienna became afraid of a Kuruc attack on the capital and assigned general Heister to prevent this. But Heister's army encamped near Koroncó  on 10 June and fearing encirclement, did not advance further northwest. Luckily, Károlyi also did not move to Győr.\nOpposing forces\nKurucs\nForgách's army was composed of some 17–18,000 fighters. The elite corps of the army were 3,000 Veteran Haiduks from the Great Turkish War. The other forces were irregular, untrained and very undisciplined soldiers. Antal Esterházy was the commander of the Kuruc cavalry\nKárolyi's army was composed of 4,000 men near Győr, but didn't receive orders from general Miklós Bercsényi to help Forgách's army.\nThe Kuruc army was formed by Hungarians, Slovaks and some Croats (Burgenland Croats).\nAustrians\nHeister's army was constituted by forces from Austria, Holy Roman Empire, Prussia, Denmark, Croatia and Serbs from Southern-Hungary, ca. 3600–6100 men. Heister fortified his camp with entrenchments and the Serbian cavalry repulsed the raiding attacks of the Kurucs.\nThe composition of the army:\n* 473 infantry under von Deutschmeister\n* 450 infantry under Heister\n* 465 infantry under colonel Virmond\n* 144 Prussian infantry under Scipio Bagni\n* 129 infantry from the Herzogtum Holstein-Plön\n* 500 Danish infantry from the regiment of the deceased Christian Frederik Haxthausen (d. 1694)\n* 500 Danish infantry under Colonel Masting\n* 573 Danish infantry under Colonel Ende\n* 884 cuirassiers under Georges de La Tour\n* 800 dragoons under Leopold Schlick\n* 800 dragoons from Bayreuth\n* 400 Croatian and Serbian lighthorsemen\nThe battle\nHeister was the initiator in the battle: on 13 June the Austrian army launched an attack against the Kuruc forces. Forgách with 11,000 men held his position, and the remaining 6–7,000 men began the encirclement of the enemy.\nThe Kurucs routed the Serbian-Croatian cavalry in the skirmisher battle. Esterházy skillfully encircled Heister's army, but the numerical superiority of the Austrian guns kept the Kuruc forces at a distance. The Austrian and Danish infantry fired so fast, that the Hungarian irregular soldiers recoiled, although the retreat of the Serbian auxiliaries also broke the front of Heister's army.\nForgách ordered a final attack against the Austrian cannons, although the Kuruc cavalry was not formed for such an attack. The Austrians guns disrupted the Kuruc cavalry. Forgách retreated and confusion arose among the Kuruc army. Heister then launched a counter-attack against the Kuruc infantry and scattered the Hungarians.\nAftermath\nCa. 2000 Kurucs were killed in the battle, the casualties of the Austrian army was 100 killed.\nHeister felt that Vienna was at risk (Károlyi's army was still intact) and therefore retreated in Lower Austria. But Károlyi didn't march into Austria. On 4 July Károlyi's army with the Hungarian Slovenes triumphed near Szentgotthárd over the Styrian army, nevertheless the Kurucs were unable to hold on to Transdanubia.\nThe battle of Koroncó proved that an irregular Kuruc army was unable to win a great open battle against a regular Imperial army.\nJános Bottyán in 1705 permanently liberated Transdanubia when he triumphed over Hannibal Heister in the second battle of Szentgotthárd.\nReferences\nSources\n* [http://mek.oszk.hu/09400/09477/html/0018/1566.html#note21 Bánlaky József: A magyar nemzet hadtörténete – A koroncói csata 1704. június 13-án]\nLiterature\n* Magyarország hadtörténete, Zrínyi katonai kiadó, Budapest 1985. szerk.: Liptai Ervin"
