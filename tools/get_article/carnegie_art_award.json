With a total prize sum of SEK 2.1m, the Carnegie Art Award was one of the world’s largest art awards.\nThe event took place every second year from 2003 to 2014 and consisted of four parts: an exhibition on tour in all Nordic countries, a book and a film presenting the artists and their work, and the awards proper to the three winning artists. Further, one young artist was awarded a scholarship.\nIn order to participate, artists had to be born or live in one of the Nordic countries. They could then be nominated by one of about 30 professionals in the field of contemporary art. A jury then selected the works to be included in the exhibition and the award winners.\nLaureates\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!width=5%|Year\n!width=16%|First Prize SEK 1,000,000\n!width=16%|Second Prize SEK 600,000\n!width=16%|Third Prize SEK 400,000\n!width=16%|Scholarship SEK 100,000\n|-\n|align=center| 1998\n|Ulrik Samuelsson,\n|Torsten Andersson,\n|Jussi Niva,\n|-\n|align=center| 1999\n|Rolf Hansson,\n|Silja Rantanen,\n|Clay Ketter,\n|Tal R,\n|-\n|align=center| 2000\n|Mari Slaattelid,\n|Hreinn Friðfinnsson,\n|Petri Hytönen,\n|John Kørner,\n|-\n|align=center| 2001\n|Jan Håfström,\n|Carolus Enckell,\n|Johan Scott,\n|Jens Fänge,\n|-\n|align=center| 2002\n|Troels Wörsel,\n|Lena Cronqvist,\n|Tal R,\n|David Svensson,\n|-\n|align=center| 2004\n|Anette H.
