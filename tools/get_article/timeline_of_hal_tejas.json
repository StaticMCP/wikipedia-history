      "text": "# Timeline of HAL Tejas\n\nThis is a timeline of the development of the HAL Tejas, a light-weight, multirole fighter aircraft manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited.\n1980s\n1983\n* The DRDO obtains permission to initiate a programme to design and develop a light combat aircraft.\n1984\n* Government of India set up Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) in 1984 as the nodal agency for managing and developing the LCA.\n1985\n* IAF submitted Air Staff Requirements (ASR) for LCA in October 1985. This was initiated by the then Air Chief Marshal Idris Hassan Latif.\n1986\n* Government allocates  for the LCA programme.\n* Programme to develop an indigenous powerplant (engine)-Kaveri was launched at GTRE.\n1987\n* Project definition commenced in October 1987 with French Dassault-Breguet Aviation as consultants. Dassault-Breguet were to assist in the design and systems integration of the aircraft, with 30 top-flight engineers reported to have flown to India to act as technical advisers to IADA, in exchange for $100m.\n1989\n* Government review committee expresses confidence in LCA programme. It was decided that the programme will be carried out in two phases.\n1990s\n1990\n* Design of LCA was finalised as a small delta winged relaxed static stability aircraft.\n* Phase 1 of the development was commenced to create the proof of concept system. Financial problems within India prevented full scale operations from starting.\n1993\n* Full funding started from April 1993 full-scale development work for phase 1 started in June.\n1995\n* First technology demonstrator, TD-1, rolled out on 17 November 1995 and was followed by TD-2 in 1998. However, technical problems in flight control systems and structural deficiencies plagued the prototypes and they remained grounded.\n1997\n* Multi-Mode Radar (MMR) for LCA design work started at HAL's Hyderabad division and the LRDE.\n2000s\n2001\n* 4 January – LCA's maiden flight successfully completed by Technology Demonstrator TD-1, on 2001. Prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee renames LCA as Tejas.\n* Development assistance sought from Snecma on the Kaveri engine.\n2002\n* 6 June – TD-2 makes a successful maiden flight.\n* MMR system was reported to be not working as per the criteria laid down in requirements.\n2003\n*Tejas crossed the sonic barrier for the first time\n* 25 November – PV-1 makes a successful maiden flight.\n2005\n* 1 December – PV-2 makes a successful maiden flight.\n2006\n* 31 March - Indian Government places an initial order for twenty LCA Tejas from HAL, for delivery by December 2011. The order comprised 4 twin seat trainers, and 16 single seat LCA.\n* 14 May – The PV-2 went supersonic again, but this time in a weaponised state (i.e., carrying weapons such as missiles and an internal gun).\n* 1 December – The PV-3 flew for the first time for 27 minutes at an altitude of 2.5&nbsp;km and at a speed of Mach&nbsp;0.8. The PV-3 was equipped with a more advanced pilot interface, refined avionics and higher control law capabilities compared with the previous versions.\n2007\n* 25 April – The first Limited Series Production LCA (LSP-1) made its first flight and it reached a speed of Mach 1.1.\n* PV-2 and PV-3 underwent sea-level trials at INS Rajali Naval Air Station, Arakkonam to study the effects of flying at sea-level, as all earlier trials have been conducted at Bangalore which is  above sea-level. The reliability of the LCA systems under the hot and humid conditions, as well as low level flight characteristics was tested. It is due to this intense flight testing schedule that the LCA was not able to fly at the Paris air show-2007, as was originally planned.\n* 7 September – Tejas Prototype Vehicle (PV-1) made a successful maiden flight with two 800-litre drop tanks.\n* 25 October – Tejas PV-1 fired a Vympel R-73 missile for first time. The trials were conducted off the Goa coast at INS Hansa Naval Air Station.\n* 11 December – LITENING targeting pod was successfully tested on Tejas PV-2.\n2008\nsuccessfully completed by December 2008.]]\n* 7 February – Tejas Prototype Vehicle (PV-1) made a successful flight powered by fuel from two 800-litre drop tanks. It made a 1-hour-24-minute-long sortie. On internal fuel LCA can perform a 40-minute sortie.\n* April – First flight with HMDS\n* May – LCA Tejas prototypes PV-2 and PV-3 underwent hot weather flight trials at Air Force Station, Nagpur from 28 May 2008 to 4 June 2008. The trials were declared successful.\n* 16 June – Tejas second Limited Series Production LCA (LSP-2) made its first flight and it reached a speed of Mach 1.1.\n* 7 November – LCA Prototype Vehicle-3 made its first successful night flight.\n* 13 December – PV-3 and LSP-2 completed the high-altitude trials at the Leh air base.\nLCA Tejas division, Bengaluru for structural coupling test.]]\n2009\n* 22 January – Tejas completed 1000 flights.\n* February – the live bombs test were successfully carried out.\n* October – PV-3 and LSP-2 completed visual target elimination and air-to-ground weapons delivery trials.\n* 26 November – Two seater (Trainer) version of Tejas(PV-5) made its maiden flight on 26 Nov 2009.\n* 7 December – Tejas passed flight flutter test diving from an altitude of four kilometers to almost sea level at . Tejas recorded a speed over 1350&nbsp;km/h. These tests were conducted at INS Hansa, Goa.\n* 15 December – Indian government sanctioned Rs 80&nbsp;billion to begin production of the fighter jet for the Indian Air Force and Indian Navy.\n2010s\n2010\n* 23 April – LCA Tejas LSP-3 Makes Maiden Flight. LSP-3 is almost the final configuration including the new air-data computers, Hybrid Multi Mode Radar, new communication and navigation equipment and radar warning receiver. With this the LCA programme has completed 1350 test flights logging about 800 flying hours.\n* 2 June – LCA Tejas LSP-4 Makes maiden flight. The flight marks the first time for a Tejas aircraft flying in the configuration that will be finally delivered to the Indian Air Force. In addition to the Hybrid MMR, the aircraft also flew with a functioning Countermeasure Dispensing System\n* 19 November – LCA Tejas LSP-5 Makes Maiden Flight.
