The Municipal Agency of Tourism took account of the situation, and it established the awards, namely the Estrella de Mar (Sea Star), to promote the quality of the spectacles and to attract the interest of entrepreneurs. Although the mainstream stage was in the hands of national-level actors and producers, the contest is a genuine local product. The following two decades consolidated the prestige of the awards, and the producers and directors see Estrella the Mar as formidable publicity for their works and careers.\nCategories\nThe main categories are for best actor, best actress, breakthrough artist, best director, best screenplayer and best local play. The trophy consists of a bronze-covered starfish. The ceremony takes place the second Monday of February each year.\nExternal links\n* [http://www.mardelplata.gob.ar/Contenido/premio-estrella-de-mar Premios Estrella de Mar]"
