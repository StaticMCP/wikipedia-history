The Rainbows fall to the Town Team by a score of 14–7 in front of 12,000 fans on Armistice Day.\n*1935 – Rainbow running back and future coach Tom Kaulukukui becomes Hawaii's first All-American player. Kaulukukui starred on Hawaii's 1934 undefeated team and set a school record in 1935 with a 103-yard kick return touchdown during a 19–6 loss to UCLA in Los Angeles. Kaulukukui's number 32 is later retired by the University and remained the only number to be retired in Hawaii in football history until Colt Brennan's No. 15 was retired in 2021.\nEugene Gill era (1940–1941)\n*1942 – Following the Attack on Pearl Harbor and the United States' entry into World War II, Hawaii cancels the 1942, 1943, 1944, and 1945 football seasons.\nTom Kaulukukui era (1946–1950)\n*1946 – Hawaii resumes football play after a four-year hiatus as a member of the NCAA.

Earlier that day, BYU quarterback Ty Detmer won the Heisman Trophy.\n*1992 – Hawaii wins a share of its first-ever WAC championship which qualifies it for the Thrifty Car Rental Holiday Bowl. In the game, the Rainbow Warriors earn their first bowl victory, a 27–17 defeat of Illinois. Hawaii would finish the season ranked 20th in the nation and post a team-record 11 victories. The 1992 Rainbows had 10 regular season victories and two future NFL veterans: defensive end Maa Tanuvasa, who played seven seasons; and place kicker Jason Elam, who played 17 seasons and was selected to three Pro Bowls.\nFred von Appen era (1996–1998)\n*1996 – Rich Ellerson extends coaching tree for former UH Warriors by being named as Head Football Coach for Southern Utah. In his single season, Ellerson accrued a 4–7 record.\n*1998 – Hawaii suffers through the program's first-ever winless season, going 0–12 under head coach Fred von Appen.

Hawaiʻi quarterback Timmy Chang would also become the NCAA's all-time leader in passing yards with 17,072 over the course of his career, eclipsing the old mark (15,031) set by former BYU quarterback Ty Detmer.\n*2005 – Hawaii finishes 5–7 and misses out on playing in a bowl game for the first time since 2001, despite a breakout year for quarterback Colt Brennan.\n*2006 – Quarterback Colt Brennan sets NCAA single-season records for touchdown passes (58) and passer efficiency rating (185.78), on his way to a sixth-place finish in the Heisman Trophy voting.

Hawaii head coach June Jones passes Dick Tomey to become the winningest head coach in school history.\n*2007 – Brennan adds to his collection of NCAA records, breaking Detmer's career records for TD passes and total TDs passing, rushing and receiving. He and wide receiver Davone Bess also tied an NCAA record for most career TDs by a quarterback-receiver combination. The Warriors are unbeaten, with a breakthrough win against Boise State, giving the Warriors their first win ever over the Broncos as a WAC member and their first outright WAC title ever. A 35–28 win over Washington in the season finale on December 1 resulted in them finishing No. 12 in the BCS rankings and earning a berth in the Sugar Bowl. This is the first regular season Hawaiʻi has ever gone undefeated. Hawaiʻi was also the sole undefeated college football team for the season. Hawaii then played Georgia on January 1, 2008 in New Orleans, losing 41–10. Ken Niumatalolo extends coaching tree for former UH Warriors by being named as Head Football Coach for Navy.  Quarterback Colt Brennan was selected for the second year in a row as a Heisman Finalist, this time finishing in third place behind Tim Tebow and Darren McFadden.\nGreg McMackin era (2008–2011)\n*2008 – Head coach June Jones resigns shortly after the 2007 season, ending his nine-year coaching run to become the new head coach at Southern Methodist University. On January 15, Greg McMackin, formerly the defensive coordinator under June Jones, accepted the position of head coach.

Boise State started playing in the MWC starting in 2011, while Hawaii along with Fresno State and Nevada made their MWC debuts in 2012.\n*2011 – Coach Greg McMackin resigns as head coach citing \"being forced out under pressure\" from the past season's record. Utah offensive coordinator Norm Chow was chosen to succeed McMackin.\nNorm Chow era (2012–2015)\nbefore a 2012 game at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]]\n*2012 – After 13 years of the pass–heavy run and shoot offense installed by former head coach June Jones, former Tennessee Titans offensive coordinator and new Hawaii head coach Norm Chow implements his more balanced pro-style offense. The Warriors go 3–9 on the season, with the only wins coming against UNLV and FCS opponents South Alabama and Lamar.\n*2013 –  Norm Chow and the Rainbow Warriors fall to 1–11, defeating only Army in the last game of the season.\n*2014 – The season started with promise under new starter Ikaika Woolsey, but during a game versus Northern Iowa, the frustrated crowd of 20,000 was audibly booing the offense for continually running with limited passing plays. Chow described the 27–24 win as \"joyless\", but following a tough loss to former WAC foe Rice, the 'Bows put together the best performance of the season with a wild 38–28 win over Wyoming, capturing the Paniolo Trophy for the first time since 1992. But the team fell apart, culminating in a disheartening 28–21 loss to Fresno State following a wild 37–35 victory over UNLV. The loss salted already smashed hopes of a division title, ending the 'Bows season at 4–9.\n*2015 – The season started out with a big win for the program over Colorado but the team slumped to 2–7 and Norm Chow was fired following a program-worst 51-point conference home loss to Air Force, 58–7, with the Falcons retaining the Kuter Trophy. Chris Naeole was named the interim head coach the Sunday following the game. Later, defensive coordinator Tom Mason was reassigned to an administrative role before the season finale. But the Rainbow Warriors fought on, winning their final game of the season and finishing with an overall record of 3–10.  On November 27, Nevada offensive coordinator and former UH Warrior Nick Rolovich took over as head coach, succeeding Naeole. The 107,145 in attendance for the game against Ohio State at Ohio Stadium on September 12 is the second largest crowd to ever attend a University of Hawaii football game.\nNick Rolovich era (2016–2019)\n*2016 – The 2016 college football season started with a new head coach on August 27 at the ANZ Stadium in Sydney, Australia, for a game between the Cal Golden Bears and the Hawai'i Rainbow Warriors, the first international football game for UH. Like those before it, the season started with a 51–31 loss, further heightened by a 63–3 thrashing at the hands of national power Michigan. The 110,222 in attendance for the game against Michigan at Michigan Stadium on September 3 is the largest crowd to ever attend a University of Hawaii football game. This broke the previous record attendance, which was set in 2015. The team also saw the largest ticket attendance since 2014, 28,687 in a 41–38 loss to UNLV on Homecoming Night.\n*2017 – The season saw Hawaii win their first two games over UMass and Western Carolina, but injuries to key players such as John Ursua lead to the Warriors losing 9 of their last 10 games of the season.\n*2018 – Coming off a 3–9 season, head coach Nick Rolovich decides to switch from a balanced spread option offense to the pass oriented run and shoot offense. Led by redshirt sophomore quarterback Cole McDonald, Hawaii starts the season off with a 6–1 record, before proceeding to lose the next 4 games to BYU, Nevada, Fresno State, and Utah State. Hawaii becomes bowl eligible with a 35–28 win over UNLV behind backup quarterback and true freshman Chevan Cordeiro's 3 TD passes on 5 pass attempts. Hawaii loses to former WAC rival Louisiana Tech in the Hawaii Bowl by a score of 31–14.\n*2019 – Coming off of their most successful season in 8 years, Hawaii entered the season winning a 45–38 thriller against Arizona, stopping Arizona quarterback Khalil Tate 1 yard short of the end zone as time expired. Hawaii spent the season with alternating quarterback play, with Cole McDonald starting 13 games, and Chevan Cordeiro starting 2 and replacing McDonald as starter in 10 of McDonald's 13 starts. Hawaii won their final regular season conference game against San Diego State 14–11, clinching their first division title in the history of Hawaii's play in the Mountain West Conference. Hawaii lost their Mountain West Championship to Boise State 31–10, but won their bowl game to BYU 38–34 behind Hawaii QB Cole McDonald's 493 yards and 4 TDs. Hawaii finished the season 10–5, their first ten win season since 2010, and just the seventh in program history. Head coach Nick Rolovich was named Mountain West Coach of the Year as a result, becoming the first coach to win from Hawaii during their tenure in the Mountain West.\nTodd Graham era (2020–2021)\n*2020 – Coming off a ten win season and a division title, head coach Nick Rolovich suddenly departs from the program to take the head coaching position at Washington State University, taking most of his coaching staff and support staff with him. Starting quarterback Cole McDonald also departs from Hawaii, declaring for the NFL Draft. Approximately 1 week later, athletic director David Matlin announces the hire of former Arizona State head coach Todd Graham. Graham retains two assistants, Jacob Yoro and Abe Elimimian from Rolovich's staff, and hires G. J. Kinne and former Hawaii linebacker Victor Santa Cruz as offensive coordinator and defensive coordinator respectively. The Rainbow Warriors win their first game of the season against rival Fresno State, 34–19, accumulating over 300 yards of rushing and forcing four turnovers; Graham becomes the first UH head coach to win in his debut since Bob Wagner in 1987. The season was also highlighted by an upset of previously undefeated Nevada, which effectively gave the Rainbow Warriors a bowl berth ahead of San Diego State and Fresno State on a tiebreaker. They capped off the year by winning the New Mexico Bowl over Houston, 28–14. The bowl victory clinched a third straight winning season and the 100th win in Graham’s career.\n*2021 – Issues with Aloha Stadium led to that venue halting the scheduling of new events as of December 2020. As a result, the Rainbow Warriors announced plans to play home games on campus at the Clarence T. C. Ching Athletics Complex \"for at least the next three years\". Despite a season that saw the team reach a program-record fourth consecutive bowl game even with a 6–7 record, an upset over Fresno State, and reclaiming the Paniolo Trophy with a 38–14 win over Wyoming in Laramie, Graham resigned after multiple reports surfaced of player mistreatment on January 14, 2022. It was also later discovered the Hawaii Bowl was only canceled because Hawaii players refused to play in the game due to injuries, COVID-19 issues, and competitive disadvantages, done by a players-only vote without Graham's knowledge.\nTimmy Chang era (2022–present)\nball-carrier during a game in 2022]]\n*2022 – Following the resignation of Graham in January 2022, Hawaii signs former quarterback Timmy Chang to a four-year deal to be head coach. Jacob Yoro and Abe Elimimian were once again retained as part of the staff, but most of the rest of the staff was new, including Ian Shoemaker as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. 19 players from the 2021 team transferred elsewhere in the fallout of Graham's tenure as coach, leaving the 2022 team depleted of depth. With these issues, the team struggled much of the season, recording a 3–10 record and a 2–6 record in conference.\n*2023 - In Chang's second season, Hawaii finished 5-8 with nonconference games against Vanderbilt, Stanford, Albany, and New Mexico State. San Jose state shutout Hawaii 35-0 in the Dick Tomey Legacy game. Hawaii did not qualify for a bowl.\nConference affiliations\n* Independent (1909–1978)\n* Western Athletic Conference (1979–2011)\n* Mountain West Conference (2012–present)\nChampionships\nConference championships\nHawaii has won four conference championships, with one being outright.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|-\n| 1992† || rowspan=\"4\"|WAC || Bob Wagner || 11–2 || 6–2\n|-\n| 1999† || rowspan=\"2\"|June Jones || 9–4 || 5–2\n|-\n| 2007 || 12–1 || 8–0\n|-\n| 2010† || Greg McMackin || 10–4 || 7–1\n|}\n† Co-champions\nDivision championships\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| 2019† || Mountain West || West || Nick Rolovich  || 5–3 || 10–5 || Boise State || L 10–31\n|}\nBowl games\nBowl games played from 1934 to 1952 were not NCAA-sanctioned.

Coaches from both schools have accused each side of various episodes of poor sportsmanship over the years, and both schools have some of the nation's rowdiest home fans. The rivalry has featured some lopsided results, including a 70–14 Fresno victory over Hawaiʻi in 2004 and a 68–37 Warriors victory in 2006 over Fresno. In 2007, allegations that Fresno State fans were physically and verbally abused by hometown Hawaiʻi fans circulated the internet and television media added to this rivalry.\nIt was being reported that several Fresno State fans attempted to warn Boise State fans from attending Hawaii football games due to potential violence against them, however no incidents were reported by Boise State fans and many photographs from Hawaii-based publications covered incidents where Hawaii and Boise State fans were seen mingling together before and after their 2007 game. The rivalry still continues to be one that is anticipated by both sides and continues to the present, with Fresno State having joined the Mountain West Conference in 2012, reuniting it with Hawaiʻi and other former WAC members in Nevada and Boise State.\nIt is Hawaii's most-played rivalry series. The two teams have met 56 times, with Fresno State leading the all-time series 30–25–1 through the 2024 season.\nAir Force\nBattle for the Kuter Trophy\nThis is one of the oldest rivalries involving Hawaii, along with the Fresno State rivalry. This rivalry is attributed to the late General Laurence S. Kuter, who was stationed on Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam as commander of the Pacific Air Forces. This led to the creation of the Kuter Trophy, a symbol of sportsmanship and school pride, but also the eternal friendship between the Air Force and Hawaii. The Falcons are in possession of the trophy following a 56–26 win in Honolulu in 2019.\nThe two teams have met 22 times, with Air Force leading the series 14–7–1.\nWyoming\nBattle for the Paniolo Trophy\nThe rivalry began in 1978, when Hawaii joined the Western Athletic Conference, and was played annually until 1997, shortly before Wyoming departed from the WAC and joined the newly formed Mountain West Conference. The rivalry was renewed in 2013 when Hawaii joined the MW as a football-only affiliate member. The teams have met 26 times, with Wyoming leading the series 16–11. Wyoming and Hawaii play for the Paniolo Trophy. 'Paniolo' is a Hawaiian word meaning “cowboy”, and the trophy featured a bronze cowboy on horseback, twirling a lariat. The trophy was donated to the two schools by the Wyoming Paniolo Society, a group of Hawaii residents with Wyoming roots. Because the two teams could not find the original trophy, a new trophy was modeled after a statue that stands in Waimea on the Big Island at the Parker Ranch Center. Wyoming won that game in Laramie 59–56 in overtime. Before that, the last time the two schools met was in 1997 in the old Western Athletic Conference with Wyoming winning 35–6 in Honolulu. Hawaii holds the Paniolo Trophy as they won the most recent meeting, 38–14 in Laramie, their first since 1991.\nSan Jose State\nDick Tomey Legacy Game\nThe two schools were each led by legendary coach Dick Tomey, who died in 2019. The winner of the rivalry game each year takes possession of the Dick Tomey Legacy Trophy. San Jose State currently holds the trophy after winning the last 4 meetings, the most recent in Oahu, Hawaii in 2023.\nThe two schools first met in 1936. The  Rainbow Warriors and Spartans have played each other 46 times as of the 2023 season.\nAs of 2023, the Spartans lead the series 23–22–1.\nUNLV\nNinth Island Showdown\nBeginning in 2017, the annual game between UNLV and Hawai'i, Ninth Island Showdown or, The Battle for the Golden Pineapple gained a rivalry trophy when the California Hotel and Casino donated the \"Golden Pineapple\" to the winner of the game. Las Vegas, Nevada has long been a popular destination for Hawaiians for both pleasure and relocation, so much so that it has been dubbed \"the Ninth Island\", with the  Cal Hotel in particular aggressively marketing itself to Hawaiian tourists. UNLV is one of Hawaii's two protected Mountain West Conference rivalries when the conference shifts to one division in 2023, meaning they will play every year. The 'Bows lead the all-time series between the two schools 19–13 as of 2022.\nBYU\nHawaii has a historic rivalry with the BYU Cougars. Both were members of the WAC from 1979 to 1998. BYU operates a satellite campus in Laie, Hawaii and there are a large number of LDS church members in the state. As well, both schools have a significant number of Polynesian descent players.\nIn 1990, Hawaii upset #4 ranked BYU and Heisman trophy winner, Ty Detmer, 59–28. In 2001, Hawaii upset undefeated #9 BYU, 72–45. In 2019, Hawaii defeated BYU in the Hawaii Bowl, 38–34.\nStadiums\nwas the Warriors former home for over 4 decades]]\n* Moiliili Field (1909–1926)\n* Honolulu Stadium (1926–1974)\n* Aloha Stadium (1975–2020)\n* Clarence T.

This rule was modified before the 2016 season; Hawaii is now open to play before Labor Day Weekend (during FCS Kickoff Week).\nThe exemption was modified to avoid a 13-game schedule with no bye weeks.\nAnnounced schedules as of October 9, 2025.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|-\n| at Stanford\n| at UMass\n| Kansas\n| Arizona\n| at Stanford\n|\n| at Kansas\n|-\n| New Mexico State\n| Northwestern State\n| Fordham\n| San Diego State\n| at Washington\n|\n|-\n| at Arizona State\n| at New Mexico State\n| at UCLA\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| UMass\n| UCLA\n| at San Diego State\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
