They are currently members of the  and are ground sharing with Harrowby United F.C. in Grantham.\nHistory\nFounded in 1901 as A.J. Simpson and Co., the football club began life in the Newark Ironmongers’ League. No records survive from those early days, but it is known that in 1935 the club, now renamed Worthington Simpson, entered the Nottingham Spartan League.\nAfter winning back-to-back titles, Simmo’s or the Works (as the club became known locally) joined the Notts Alliance League in 1949, going on to win that title in the momentous football years of 1953 and 1966.\nThe Notts Alliance Cup brought the club’s greatest success up to that point, first in 1970 beating Notts Combined Police two-nil in a replay at Notts County’s Meadow Lane ground and then the trophy returning to Newark in 1972 after an epic five-three extra time victory. The trophy returned to Newark again 1981, 1989 and finally 1999.\nName changes followed in the late ‘90s, first to IDP and then to Newark Flowserve, and in 2004 the club’s name was entered into the first level of the FA’s national pyramid by joining the Central Midlands League Premier Division.\nFollowing a short break, the first team re-formed in 2013 and finished a creditable third in Notts\nSenior League (NSL) Division Two, securing promotion to the First Division. Another successful campaign followed a year later when the team finished runners-up and clinched their place in the NSL Premier Division, taking the club back to step seven football.\nIn 2001 they changed name again, to Newark Flowserve, and in 2004 they opted to join the Central Midlands League. After a  five-year stint in the CML, Flowserve joined the Nottinghamshire Senior League.\nIn 2018, the club won 31 of its 34 league matches to secure the league championship, and with it promotion to Step 6. In May 2018 their promotion to the East Midlands Counties League was ratified by the Football Association League Committee.\nThe club won promotion to the Midland league at the end of the 2018/19 season.\nIn May 2020 the club was again renamed, to Newark. At the end of the 2020–21 season they were transferred to the Premier Division North of the United Counties League. The end of the 2020/21 witnessed the final ever game at Lowfields following their ground being sold to a property developer. The club played their home games for the season 2021/22 at Basford Utd's Greenwich Ave ground.  In May 2022 the club again changed name, this time to Newark and Sherwood United F.C. and the club moved to share with Collingham F.C. at Station Road, Collingham.
