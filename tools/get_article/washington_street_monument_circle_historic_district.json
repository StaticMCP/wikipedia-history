As was traditional for the IHSAA champions, the Attucks team participated in their parade. Although it wound around Monument Circle, their bus did not stop at the circle as previous parades for white championship teams had. Instead, the parade continued on to Northwestern Park. When the team won their second consecutive championship in 1956, the parade again skipped Monument Circle.\nOn May 23, 2015, nine members of the 1955 Crispus Attucks High School basketball team served as grand marshals for the 2015 IPL 500 Festival Parade and made their trip through Monument Circle. These members included Oscar Robertson, Lavern Benson, James Enoch, John Gipson, Bill Hampton, Albert Maxey, Willie Merriweather, Shedrick Mitchell and Henry Robertson.\nIndiana Pride\nIn 1984, hundreds of LGBTQ+ Hoosiers gathered at Monument Circle, marking the first large public gathering for Indiana Pride. Previously, Pride Week had been celebrated through brunches at the Essex Hotel House, fundraising for various causes, and food donations for the poor. After several years of private celebrations, LGBTQ+ Hoosiers again gathered at the circle in 1990. In 2021, the Indiana Historical Bureau and Indy Pride installed the \"Origins of Indiana Pride - Indiana LGBTQ Pride\" historical marker at 40 Monument Circle to commemorate the 1990 \"Celebration on the Circle.\"\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Center Township, Marion County, Indiana\nReferences"
