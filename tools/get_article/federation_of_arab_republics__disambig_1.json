Although approved by a referendum in each country on 1 September 1971, the three countries disagreed on the specific terms of the merger. The federation lasted from 1 January 1972 to 19 November 1977.\nHistory\nIn 1969, Arab nationalist military officers seized power in Libya. The ideological influence of Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser over the new Libyan government was immediately apparent. The administration was immediately recognized by the Arab nationalist governments in Egypt, Iraq, Sudan and Syria with Egypt sending experts to aid Libya's inexperienced government. Gaddafi propounded Pan-Arab ideas, proclaiming the need for a single Arab state stretching across North Africa and the Middle East. In December 1969, Libya founded the Arab Revolutionary Front with Egypt and Sudan as a step towards political unification, and in 1970 Syria stated its intention to join.\nAfter Nasser's death in September 1970, his successor, Anwar Sadat, suggested that rather than a unified state, they create a political federation. It was implemented in April 1971 which enabled Egypt, Syria and Sudan to get large grants of Libyan oil money. In September 1972, Gaddafi and Sadat signed an unofficial charter of merger, but it was never implemented as relations broke down the following year. Sadat became increasingly wary of Libya's radical direction, and the September 1973 deadline for implementing the Federation passed by with no action taken. In October 1973 Egypt and Syria, without consulting Libya, launched a coordinated attack on Israel, initiating the October war. Sadat agreed to open negotiations with Israel, seeking the return of the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt in exchange for a guarantee to not engage in further attacks on the country. Gaddafi was angered by the war's limited objectives and the ceasefire, and accused Sadat of cowardice, undermining the FAR, and betraying the Arab cause. Sadat responded by revealing he had intervened earlier that year to prevent Libya from sinking a civilian passenger ship carrying Jewish tourists in the Mediterranean Sea. Thereafter Egyptian–Libyan relations were marked by frequent accusations against each country's leaders, and further discussions regarding the pursuit of unity were abandoned.\nReferendums\nThree simultaneous referendums on the Federation of Arab Republics were held on 1 September 1971, in Egypt, Libya and Syria. In the Egyptian referendum the proposal was approved by 99.96% of voters, in the Libyan referendum it was approved by 98.6% of voters, whilst in Syria 96.4% voted in favour.\nOther Federations of Arab Republics\n*Federation of Egypt, Libya and Sudan (1969/70–1971)\n*Federation of Egypt, Libya and Syria (1971/72–1974/77)\n*Union between Egypt and Libya within the Federation (1972–1973/74)\n*Union between Egypt and Syria within the Federation (1976–1977)\n*Federation comprising Egypt, Sudan and Syria (1977)\nFile:FAR 1970.png|FAR 1970, Syria intends to join the Egyptian-Libyan-Sudanese Federation\nFile:FAR 1971.png|FAR 1971, Sudan is said to join later but keeps outside the Federation\nFile:FAR 1972.png|FAR 1972, Iraq is invited to join the Egyptian-Libyan-Syrian Federation\nFile:FAR 1973.png|FAR 1973, Egypt and Libya fail to form a Union within the Federation\nFile:FAR 1976.png|FAR 1976, Egypt and Syria intend to form a Union within the Federation\nFile:FAR 1977.png|FAR 1977, Sudan intends to join the Egypt-Syrian Federation\nSymbols of member states\nFlags\nFlag of Egypt (1972-1984).svg|Egyptian flag used until 1984, 7 years after the dissolution\nFlag of Libya (1972–1977).svg|Libyan flag used until 1977\nFlag of Syria (1972–1980).svg|Syrian flag used until 1980, 3 years after the dissolution\nCoats of arms\nCoat of arms of Egypt (1972-1984).svg|Egyptian coat of arms used until 1984, 7 years after the dissolution\nCoat of arms of Libya (1972–1977).svg|Libyan coat of arms used until 1977\nCoat of arms of the Federation of Arab Republics (1972–1977).svg|Syrian coat of arms used until 1980, 3 years after the dissolution\nMaps\nLocationEgypt.svg|Location of Egypt\nLocationLibya.svg|Location of Libya\nLocationSyria.svg|Location of Syria\nSee also\n*Union of Arab Republics, Iraqi counter-proposal to the Federation of Arab Republics\n*Arab Federation, a confederation between Iraq and Jordan (1958)\n*Arab Islamic Republic, a proposed union of Libya and Tunisia (1974)\n*United Arab Emirates, a union of seven Arab states (1971–present day)\n*United Arab Republic, a union between Egypt and Syria (1958–61)\n*United Arab States, a confederation between the United Arab Republic and the Kingdom of Yemen (1958–61)\n*Unified Political Command, merger projects between Egypt and Iraq as well as between Egypt and North Yemen\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
