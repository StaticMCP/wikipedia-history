The congress decided in favour of an alliance with the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and elected its Central Executive Committee ().\nIt was reformed on March 19, 1918, at the Second All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets in Yekaterinoslav, following the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk by the Russian Russian SFSR on March 3. After the victory of the Soviet government in Ukraine, the Ukrainian People's Republic was officially rebranded as the Ukrainian Soviet Republic and then the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic (UkSSR) which became a co-founder of the Soviet Union.\nMilitary forces of Soviet government of Ukrainian Republic of that time are known as Red Cossacks Army, later integral part of Red Army of the Soviet Union.\nThe USR united the Ukrainian People's Republic of Soviets, the Donetsk–Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic and the Odessa Soviet Republic as part of the Russian SFSR. It was soon overrun, however, by forces of the Central Powers and the Ukrainian People's Republic.\nIn March-April 1918, the capital was Taganrog. On April 18, 1918, in Taganrog, the next session of the Central Executive Committee of Soviets announced that the government of Soviet Ukraine, the Central Executive Committee of Ukraine and the People's Secretariat were now combined as the \"Ukrainian Bureau\" to guide the insurgent struggle against the German occupation.\nReferences"
