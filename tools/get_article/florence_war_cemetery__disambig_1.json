The majority of the graves are occupied by soldiers who lost their lives fighting in the Florence area, after it was captured by allied forces in August 1944. The town was in the middle of the Arno Line, defensive positions formed by the retreating German forces, and the bodies of the soldiers killed during fighting from July to September 1944 are buried here. 83 graves from the nearby Arrow Route Cemetery were moved here after the war.\nSee also\n* Florence American Cemetery and Memorial\n* Jewish monumental cemetery, Florence\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
