A blue milk glass called “Delphite” (Delfite, Jeannette Glass) and \"Azur-ite\" (Anchor Hocking) was also produced for several years.\nHistory\nMcKee Glass introduced their jade green (trade name “Skokie” green) colored kitchen and tableware in 1930. Shortly after in 1932, Jeannette Glass began their production of this color glass, in doing so coining the term Jadite. In the mid-1940's, Jade-ite was produced by Anchor Hocking. Early versions produced by McKee Glass Company and Jeannette Glass Company (both of Jeannette, PA) are a type of uranium glass that will glow under UV light.\nWhile McKee Glass was the first to produce tableware in this jadeite color glass, the history of this color dates back to the 19th century. Other U.S. and European glassmakers produced items in this color. Examples can be seen from various makers such as Tarentum Glass, Challinor Taylor, and Portieux Vallerysthal of France.\nJadeite glass experienced a resurgence of popularity in the late 20th century, initially in the 1970s through the “heritage” revival of U.S. glassmakers like Fenton and Westmoreland Glass. Westmoreland produced new glassware made in historical and current molds to cater to the color trends at the time.\nBut the true increase in popularity was largely due to the influence of Martha Stewart, who began showcasing her collection of vintage glass on her television show. Interest continued to intensify during the release of her own line of jadeite - sold initially through the Martha by Mail catalogs in the late 1990s. Domestic glassmakers L.E. Smith, Fenton, and more recently Mosser Glass have contributed to the Martha Stewart lines with heritage molded pieces in jadeite glass. The molds for these pieces were both original and reproduction patterns of glassware made by their own companies, as well as molds previously owned by companies such as Portieaux Vallerysthal of France. This glassware was made in the same old-world method that these companies had been producing with throughout the 20th century.\nThe release of the Martha by Mail jadeite line in the late 1990s renewed interest in this glass color, and spurred a surge in collecting of this color of glass. Today, companies both domestically and internationally produce jadeite glass. You can find imported jadeite items from brands such as Pioneer Woman, Gibson, Grace Mitchell, Tablecraft, and others. Mosser Glass currently produces hand-made jadeite glass pieces in their factory in Cambridge, Ohio.\nToday collectors are able to procure a variety of original, original reproduction, and new/fantasy jadeite glass pieces.\nJadeite Fire King\nThe \"Jadeite Fire King\" brand was first produced by the United States glassware firm Anchor Hocking in the 1940s. Most of Anchor Hocking's output of Jadeite was between 1945 and 1975. A durable product in a fashionable color, it became the most popular product made by Anchor Hocking.\nUnlike the earlier items from McKee and Jeannette, Fire King items do not contain uranium and are a slightly different shade of green. Uranium was removed from glass mixes in the early 1940s due to war efforts. These Fire King items will not fluoresce under UV light.\nReproduction items from the Fire King 2000 line of Jadeite were produced by Anchor Hocking. Anchor Hocking designed variations into these reproductions so that they are not mistaken for originals, maintaining the integrity of the original status of their mid-century Jadeite articles.\nSimilar products\nKitchenware in other materials, such as aluminum canisters and bread containers, were produced in the mid-to late 20th century (and currently) in a similar shade of Jadeite green, to match the glassware. However, only glassware in the jadeite color is considered to be jadeite by collectors.\nOther glass held in regard by collectors are adjacent colors of glass such as clambroth green. 20th century glassmakers such as New Martinsville, Fenton, Stueben, and Jobling (England) produced items that are also sought after by jadeite collectors, and are considered part of the overall “family” of colored glassware by collectors.\nSee also\n*Depression glass\n*Milk glass\nReferences"
