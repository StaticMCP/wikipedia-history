He was destined to become a Policeman.. His father before him was a Policeman  It was so cold the week of his birth that local Gorges were blocked due to heavy snowfall; there was good news that the Ship the Albion had docked from the Suez bringing 2 weeks worth of mail from Europe. There had been a record number of horses sold at the local sale yard, and it was announced that local Trout had started spawning (in record numbers).  Construction of the new local railway was to be commenced and 136,606 gallons of spirits were cleared by customs at the colony; ( not to mention the 60,440 gallons of ale that were already cleared).
