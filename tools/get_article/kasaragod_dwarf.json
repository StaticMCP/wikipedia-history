They grow to a height of 1 metre on average and are therefore easy to maintain. The cows are known for their high milking ability and give mineral rich milk with high feed to milk ratio. The cattle require almost zero inputs and can be free ranged. They are known for their intelligence and can find their way back to their homes after grazing. They are one among the four prime dwarf cattles in India along with Malnad Gidda, Punganur, and Vechur cattle.\nCharacteristics\nHeight averages at 107.3 cms. for males and 95.83 cms. for females.\nFile:Kasaragod Dwarf cow at Neelamperoor 01.jpg|Cow\nFile:Kasaragod Dwarf cow at Neelamperoor 02.jpg|Cow\nFile:Kasaragod Dwarf ox at Madikai Chathurakkinar-Vijayanrajapuram 02.jpg|Bull\nFile:Kasaragod Dwarf ox at Madikai Chathurakkinar-Vijayanrajapuram 03.jpg|Bull\nReferences"
