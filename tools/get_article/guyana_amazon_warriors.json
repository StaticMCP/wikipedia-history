It represents Guyana in the league and was established in 2013 for the inaugural season.[https://www.cplt20.com/teams/mens/221]\nThe team plays home games at Providence Stadium in Guyana. They recruit players mainly from West Indian domestic teams. They have reached six CPL finals and won their first tournament in 2023.\nHistory\nThe Guyana Amazon Warriors were among the six teams established for the inaugural season of the Caribbean Premier League in 2013. In that same year, they finished as runners-up in the tournament, losing to the Jamaica Tallawahs by 7 wickets at Queen’s Park Oval in Port of Spain, Trinidad. The team, led by Ramnaresh Sarwan, featured notable international players like Tillakaratne Dilshan, James Franklin, Lasith Malinga, and West Indian stars Sunil Narine, Lendl Simmons, and Denesh Ramdin. Krishmar Santokie emerged as the highest wicket-taker of the season.\nIn the 2014 Caribbean Premier League, the Amazon Warriors finished second in the group stage and were then defeated by the Barbados Tridents by 8 runs (D/L) in the final at Warner Park, Basseterre, St Kitts. Captained by Sunil Narine, the team included players like Martin Guptill, Mohammad Hafeez, Jimmy Neesham, Krishmar Santokie, Lendl Simmons, and Denesh Ramdin. Simmons was named player of the series with 445 runs that season..\nIn the 2015 Caribbean Premier League, they again finished second in the group stage behind Barbados Tridents. However, they lost to Trinbago Knight Riders in the semi-final by 6 wickets at Queen’s Park Oval in Port of Spain, Trinidad. The team, captained by Denesh Ramdin, had a star-studded lineup that included players like Lasith Malinga, Thisara Perera, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Brad Hodge, Marchant de Lange, David Wiese, Umar Akmal, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Veerasammy Permaul, Lendl Simmons, and Sunil Narine.\nIn the 2016 Caribbean Premier League, Martin Guptill took over as captain, replacing Denesh Ramdin. The team also added international players Sohail Tanvir, Dwayne Smith, Chris Lynn, Adam Zampa, as well as local stars Chris Barnwell, Jason Mohammed, and Rayad Emrit.\nImran Tahir led the Guyana Amazon Warriors to their first championship title in the 2023 Caribbean Premier League, with Romario Shepherd as Vice-Captain and Lance Klusener as head coach.  This victory came after being runner ups five times, defeating the Trinbago Knight Riders at the Providence Stadium in Guyana.\nCurrent squad\n* Players with international caps are listed in bold.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n|-\n!No.\n!Name\n!Nationality\n!Birth date\n!Batting style\n!Bowling style\n!Year signed\n!Notes\n|-\n! colspan=\"9\"  style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center;\"| Batsmen\n|-\n|\n|Kevlon Anderson\n|\n|\n|Right-handed\n|Right-arm fast-medium\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2025\n|\n|-\n|\n|Shamarh Brooks\n|\n|\n|Right-handed\n|Right-arm legbreak\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2025\n|\n|-\n|\n|Shimron Hetmyer\n|\n|\n|Left-handed\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2016\n|\n|-\n|\n|Ben McDermott\n|\n|\n|Right-handed\n|Right-arm medium\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2025\n|Overseas, Replacement player\n|-\n! colspan=\"9\"  style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center;\"| All-rounders\n|-\n|\n|Moeen Ali\n|\n|\n|Left-handed\n|Right-arm off-break\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2024\n|Overseas\n|-\n|\n|Riyad Latif\n|\n|(age 17)\n|Right-handed\n|Right-arm legbreak\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2025\n|\n|-\n|\n|Keemo Paul\n|\n|\n|Right-handed\n|Right-arm medium-fast\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2022\n|\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#FFCCCC\"\n|\n|Glenn Phillips\n|\n|\n|Right-handed\n|Right-arm off break\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2025\n|Overseas, Ruled out through injury\n|-\n|\n|Dwaine Pretorius\n|\n|\n|Right-handed\n|Right-arm medium-fast\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2023\n|Overseas\n|-\n|\n|Quentin Sampson\n|\n|\n|Right-handed\n|Right-arm medium-fast\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2025\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"9\"  style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center;\"| Wicket-keepers\n|-\n|\n|Shai Hope\n|\n|\n|Right-handed\n|Left-arm medium\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2022\n|\n|-\n|\n|Kemol Savory\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2025\n|-\n! colspan=\"9\"  style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center;\"| Spin bowlers\n|-\n|\n|Hassan Khan\n|\n|\n|Right-handed\n|Left-arm orthodox\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2025\n|Overseas\n|-\n|\n|Gudakesh Motie\n|\n|\n|Left-handed\n|Left-arm orthodox\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2021\n|\n|-\n|\n|Imran Tahir\n|\n|\n|Right-handed\n|Right-arm legbreak\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2018\n|Captain, Overseas\n|-\n! colspan=\"9\"  style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center;\"| Pace bowlers\n|-\n|\n|Jediah Blades\n|\n|\n|Right-handed\n|Left-arm fast-medium\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2025\n|\n|-\n|\n|Shamar Joseph\n|\n|\n|Left-handed\n|Right-arm fast\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2023\n|\n|-\n|\n|Romario Shepherd\n|\n|\n|Right-handed\n|Right-arm fast-medium\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2018\n|Vice-Captain\n|}\n*Source: [https://www.cplt20.com/teams/guyana-amazon-warriors Guyana Amazon Warriors Players]\nResults summary\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ CPL summary of results\n|-\n!Year\n!Played\n!Wins\n!Losses\n!Tied\n!NR\n!Win %\n!Position\n|-\n! 2013\n| 9 || 6 || 3 || 0 || 0 || 66.67% || 2/6\n|-\n! 2014\n| 11 || 7 || 4 || 0 || 0 || 63.63% || 2/6\n|-\n! 2015\n| 11 || 5 || 5 || 0 || 1 || 50% || 3/6\n|-\n! 2016\n|  12 || 8 || 4 || 0 || 0 || 66.67% || 2/6\n|-\n! 2017\n|  12 || 6 || 6 || 0 || 0 || 50% || 3/6\n|-\n! 2018\n| 12 || 7 || 5 || 0 || 0 || 58.33% || 2/6\n|-\n! 2019\n| 12 || 11 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 91.67% || 2/6\n|-\n! 2020\n| 11 || 6 || 5 || 0 || 0 || 54.54% || 3/6\n|-\n! 2021\n| 11 || 6  || 5|| 0 || 0 || 54.54% || 4/6\n|-\n!2022\n|12\n|5\n|6\n|0\n|1\n|45.45%\n|2/6\n|-\n!2023\n|13\n|10\n|2\n|0\n|1\n|83.33%\n|1/6\n|-\n!2024\n|13\n|8\n|5\n|0\n|0\n|61.53%\n|1/6\n|-\n!2025\n|12\n|7\n|5\n|0\n|0\n|58.33%\n|2/6\n|-\n!
