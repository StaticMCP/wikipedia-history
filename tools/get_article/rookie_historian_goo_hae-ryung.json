It is also a fictionalisation of part of the story of the Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty and their right to be considered a true history.\nThe series aired on MBC's Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:00 KST from July 17 to September 26, 2019, with Netflix carrying the series internationally.\nSynopsis\nThe scenario intertwines two storylines. One of them occurs in a \"nowadays\" placed in the early 19th century of Joseon. The other occurs twenty years earlier (white horse year, 1810). The first one is treated lightly, in the Sungkyunkwan Scandal vein, with caricatures, jokes, gimmicks, students fights,  etc. The second one, only depicted by short flash-backs, is about the unjust situation of the rank and file people, and the brutal suppression of anyone who embraces Western ideas.\nNowadays, Nokseodang\n]] In the Joseon period, women were objectified and undervalued. But free-spirited lady Goo Hae-ryung is brave enough to follow her own view of life. Still single at 26 years old, she focuses on studying and gaining knowledge, and in defending those who are wronged and abused.\nMeanwhile, the young and handsome 20-year-old Prince Dowon has been living his life alone at the Nokseodang (). Isolated inside the Huwon Garden, he has to stay away from the royal Court and finds comfort by writing Hangul romance novels. Published under the art name Maehwa (), these novels become famous all over Hanyang, especially to women readers.\nThe two main characters meet, and this first meeting sparks a war of preferences. But politics disturb the romance. Suddenly, Korean books and European translations are banned, confiscated and burned. All the beard bearing red robes at court are infuriated that \"so many noble ladies ran away to find the love of their life after reading Maehwa's books\". But this is only a \"just cause\". The real target is \"The Story of Hodam\", a book about events that occurred twenty years earlier.\nIn their frenzy to search and destroy every single copy of this book, the king and councilor Min Ik-pyeong go so far as ask for the recruitment of female historians, with the intent of planting spies in each chamber of the Royal Palace. As a result, four female apprentices (Goo Hae-ryung among them) are selected and added to the existing eight recorders. They write the conversations between the royals and their subjects in the everyday collection of sachaek 사책 which will be compiled into the Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty. Many gender stereotypes surface, only to be derided... and overcome. The twelve historians become embroiled in disputes with the Court, asserting their right under law to record all conversations between the royal family and courtiers, and even go on strike against the king.\nA smallpox epidemic will be the event that reconnects the two storylines. On the one hand, members of the court speculate on traditional remedies, and even attempt to kill the Prince by sending him to the infested provinces. On the other hand, Dowon organizes the state answer, seizing and distributing food while applying the 牛痘種書, 瑛眼 (vaccination treaty, by Yeongan) that was provided by the mysterious Moh-wa. Hae-ryung remembers being vaccinated by her father in the past and convinces the Prince to prove the method by being the first patient to be inoculated.\nTwenty years ago, Seoraewon\nA series of flash-backs running through the episodes describes the events of \"twenty years ago\". The former King, Yi Gyeom, Prince Huiyeong, styled Hodam, founded Seoraewon, together with Seo Mun-jik, styled Yeongan. The latter was Seoraewon's dean, while Hodam was one of its teachers. The teachin team was completed by Barthelemy Dominique, a medicine teacher, who was sent by the Paris Foreign Missions Society. As a result, Seoraewon was a school of Western studies aimed at educating people regardless of social class or gender. \"Seoraewon\" () means \"Where Dawn Arrives\".\nThis is where Moh-wa learned vaccination and surgery.\nA conservative reaction ensued, led by Min Ik-pyeong. A forged letter of the King, allegedly saying \"send more priests, and turn Joseon into a Catholic country\" served as \"just cause\"  for a massacre. Among the rare escapees were Dowon, the newborn son of Hodam,  and the 6 year-old Hae-ryung, the daughter of Yeongan.\nThe series ends three years after \"nowadays\". Min Ik-pyeong and his proxy king are gone and Seoraewon is reinstated. Prince Yi Jinhas been enthroned. Dowon lives in leisure outside of the Palace, wandering across the world, while Hae-ryung has become a full-ranked member of the Yemungwan. Prince Yi Rim (Dowon) and Hae-ryung are still in a relationship but not married.\nQuotation\n(Goo Hae-ryung). \"Even if you slash my throat, our brushes will not stop writing. If I die, another historian will take my place; if you kill that historian, another will take their place. Even if you kill every historian in this land, and take away all the paper and brushes, you won't be able to stop us. From mouth to mouth, teacher to student, elder to child, history will be told. That is the power of truth.\"\nCast\nMain\nIn the Netflix release, the following three characters are put forward in the opening sequence of each episode:\n* Shin Se-kyung as Goo Hae-ryung (born Seo Hee-yeon)\n:A noble lady who becomes one of the four female historians of the royal court.
