They contain primarily texts of poetry and prose, some of which are contemporary and others which may have originated from traditions dating back to as early as the sixth and seventh centuries.  These also contain some of the earliest native Welsh references to King Arthur.\nThe four books included by Skene in his list are:\n* The Black Book of Carmarthen\n* The Book of Taliesin\n* The Book of Aneirin\n* The Red Book of Hergest\nThe principal texts of the Four Ancient Books of Wales were edited and translated in a two volume compilation by William Forbes Skene in 1868. By the standards of modern scholarship the edition is seriously flawed with numerous transcription errors and consequently inaccurate translating. Skene was assisted by Daniel Silvan Evans who was probably responsible for most of the translations.\nImage:Black Book of Carmarthen (f.4.r).jpg|Facsimile of a page from the Black Book of Carmarthen\nImage:Book.of.Aneirin.facsimile.png|Facsimile of a page from the Book of Aneirin\nImage:Book.of.Taliesin.facsimile.png|Facsimile of a page from the Book of Taliesin (Folio 13)\nImage:Red.Book.of.Hergest.facsimile.png|Facsimile of Part of Column 579 from the Red Book of Hergest\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
