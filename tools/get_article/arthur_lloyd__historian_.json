      "text": "# Arthur Lloyd (historian)\n\nArthur Thomas Lloyd (1917–2009) was a local historian of the New Forest region of Hampshire, England, and a writer and teacher.\nLife\nArthur Lloyd was a history teacher at Ashley Secondary School in New Milton from 1946 until his retirement from teaching in 1977. From the 1960s, he wrote articles in the Hampshire Magazine and in the publications of the Hampshire Field Club and Archaeological Society on a variety of local subjects. Of particular value was his analysis of the death of William II where he demonstrated that the traditional location for the King's death marked by the Rufus Stone near Minstead was the result of little more than a 17th-century story. Lloyd himself argued that William II had been killed somewhere near Beaulieu. His other works included accounts of the medieval salt-making industry in southwest Hampshire. From 1988, he was the honorific President of the Lymington and District Historical Society.\nHe was the first recipient of New Milton's Citizen of the Year award in 2005. Mosaics in Station Road, New Milton, were dedicated to his memory in 2009.\nWritten works\nArticles\n*A. T. Lloyd, (1961) The Shakers of Hordle. Hampshire Magazine, November 1961\n*A. T.
