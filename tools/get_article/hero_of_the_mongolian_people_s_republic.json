It was modeled on the Soviet Union's highest award, the Hero of the Soviet Union title.\nHistory\nSoon after the victory of the Mongolian Revolution of 1921, the new government formed high degrees of distinction, which was appropriated by the Provisional People's Government . The first such title was the title of \"Fearless Hero of the Mongolian People's State\", which was awarded on September 23, 1922, to Damdin Sükhbaatar. On April 24, 1924, the title of \"Unyielding People's Hero\" was awarded to his colleague Khatanbaatar Magsarjav. Two more Mongolian servicemen were awarded this title for heroism in battles on the border with Manchuria in 1936. In 1945, a special insignia was introduced for those awarded the title of Hero of the Mongolian People's Republic: the Gold Star of the Hero of the MPR.\nNotable Recipients\nMongolian\n* Damdin Sükhbaatar – Minister of War of Mongolia\n* Khatanbaatar Magsarjav – Former Prime Minister of Mongolia\n* Khorloogiin Choibalsan – Marshal of the Mongolian People's Republic\n* Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal – Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Great Khural\n* Batyn Dorj – Minister of Defense of the Mongolian People's Republic\n* Butochiyn Tsog – Mongolian general\n* Jügderdemidiin Gürragchaa – Mongolian Cosmonaut\n* Bagziin Givaan – Veteran of Border Guards who took part in the Battle of Baitag Bogd.\nFile:Sukhbaatar.jpg|Damdin Sükhbaatar\nFile:Jügderdemidiin Gürragchaa.jpeg|Jügderdemidiin Gürragchaa\nFile:Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal Berlin, VIII.jpg|Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal\nFile:Kh.
