A. Ward is one of the whistle makers that little is known about, and most of it is revealed by his designs and stamps, which testify to an innovative maker of high-quality whistles. All his whistles are rare and some were discovered only in the last year or two (2008).\nDuring 1889–1890 he had some partnership with a Birmingham whistle maker named Peter McDonald and they applied for a patent # 2980 in February 1890, the patent was never granted, it was for a Glasgow-style escargot-type whistle constructed of 6 parts in a way similar to one that S Auld received a patent for in the same year.\nModels and types\n* Escargot-type whistles; H A Ward may have made the First model of the famous \"Thunderer\" London style whistle, later to be become popular by with numerous whistle manufacturers until J Hudson and co. were granted the registered trade mark at 1927 after years of legal fights and claims.

It may be noted here that B Lily & sons were located at the same street as J Hudson & Co at the time and sold other makers but Hudson's. and supplied whistles ordered from Ward, De Courcy and T Yates among others.\n* Round pea whistles some stamped and some not, Many named; 'Midget', 'Express', made for B Lily & Sons\n* Two pipes or multi tube whistles with inline mouthpiece.\nBody stamps\n* 'H.A.W', 'Thunderer', 'The City Whistle'\n* 'The City Police', 'The Standart Police or Fire', 'L.M.S'  London Midland & Scottish Railway.\n* 'The City Police or Fire Whistle' in 5 Lines & in 3 Lines along the whistle cylindrical body.\n* 'Express' on a round pea whistle, 'Speedwell' on a Double pipe type.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\"[https://archive.today/20130209074055/http://whistlemuseum.com/2009/02/06/h-a-ward-double-pipe---the-city-whistle--c-1890s-birmingham-whistle-museum--all-rights-reserved.aspx H A Ward whistle manufacturer History & Samples, Double pipe 'The City Whistle' c 1890s, Birmingham, A.Strauss]\", WhistleMuseum.com."
