This is because the word \"road\" did not come to its current definition until around the 16th century. However, boundary changes in 1994 put part of Goswell Road in the City of London.\nCulture\nSome older road names that were created in an innocuous or matter-of-fact way, and that were accepted at that time, are nowadays considered rude e.g. Gropecunt Lane.\nRoad numbering\nList\nLondon\n* Street names of Belgravia\n* Street names of Bloomsbury\n* Street names of Clerkenwell and Finsbury\n* Street names of Covent Garden\n* Street names of Fitzrovia\n* Street names of Holborn\n* Street names of Kennington and Lambeth\n* Street names of Lisson Grove\n* Street names of Marylebone\n* Street names of Mayfair\n* Street names of Pimlico and Victoria\n* Street names of Regent's Park\n* Street names of Sheffield\n* Street names of Soho\n* Street names of Southwark\n* Street names of the City of London\n* Street names of Vauxhall\n* Street names of Waterloo\n* Street names of Westminster\nReferences\nSee also\n* Odonymy\n* Odonymy in France\n* Lists of roads in the United Kingdom\n* List of road junctions in the United Kingdom"
