He played his junior rugby league for the Commercial Football Club, before making his senior debut with Brisbane club Valleys in 1923. Brisbane representative honours came only two games into his career and he made his debut for Queensland during his second year of senior rugby league.\nEdwards was Australia's halfback in a 1928 home international against Great Britain. He also toured England with the national team at the end of 1929, but was unable to displace Joe Busch at halfback for the Test matches.\nWith prior experience as coach of Gympie, Edwards was appointed playing-coach of North Sydney for the 1933 NSWRFL season, but had to resign nine rounds into the season due to injury and joined Goulburn as coach.\nEdwards was the grandfather of broadcaster Laurel Edwards.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/players/arthur-edwards/summary.html Arthur Edwards] at Rugby League Project (credits Edwards as coach for entire 1933 season)"
