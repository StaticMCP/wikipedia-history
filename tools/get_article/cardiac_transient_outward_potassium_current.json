Ito1 is active during phase 1, causing a fast repolarization of the action potential\nThe cardiac transient outward potassium current (referred to as Ito1 or Ito) is one of the ion currents across the cell membrane of heart muscle cells. It is responsible for the (brief) repolarizing phase 1 of the cardiac action potential (which succeeds depolarisation, and precedes the plateau phase). The Ito is produced by movement of positively charged potassium (K+) ions from the intracellular into the extracellular space. It exhibits rapid activation and inactivation. Ito1 is complemented with Ito2 resulting from Cl− ions to form the transient outward current Ito.\nThe Ito1 is generated by voltage-gated K+ channels Kv1.4, Kv4.2, and (especially) Kv4.3; these channels undergo ball-and-chain inactivation to terminate the current.\nIt occurs in atrial, ventricular, and conduction system cells. In ventricular myocardium, it is more potent in the epicardium than the endocardium; this transmural Ito1 gradient underlies the J wave ECG finding.\nRole in disease\n*Reduction in Ito1 density is associated with prolonged action potentials and is a common finding in cardiac disease.\n:*Ito1 density is significantly lower in the cells of a failing heart in comparison to the cells of a healthy heart.\n:*There is correlation between decreased Ito1 density and atrial fibrillation.\n:*Ito activation is inhibited by thyrotropin (TSH). This mechanisms may be one of the reasons for the observation that both bradycardia and atrial fibrillation are common in hypothyroidism.\n*An increase in the Ito1 density caused by a mutation in Kv4.3 can be a cause of Brugada Syndrome.\nReferences"
