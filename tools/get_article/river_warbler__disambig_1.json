It breeds in eastern and central Europe, and into the western Palearctic. It is migratory, wintering in inland southern Africa, from around the Zambezi River south to the vicinity of Pretoria in South Africa.\nTaxonomy and etymology\nThe genus name Locustella is from Latin and is a diminutive of locusta,  \"grasshopper\". This refers to the song of the common grasshopper warbler and some others in this genus. The specific fluviatilis is Latin for \"of a river\".\nIt's a monotypic species.\nDescription\nThis is a largish warbler. The adult has an unstreaked grey-brown back, whitish grey underparts, and a darker undertail, which has white feather tips giving a contrasting pattern. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are yellower below. Some birds can show reduced dark markings on the undertail coverts (caused by more extensive than usual white tips) and thus are closer in appearance to Savi's warbler than typical river warblers. However, they typically still have a streaked breast and more olive colouration on the upperparts.\nThis is a skulking species which is very difficult to see except sometimes when singing. It creeps through grass and low foliage.\nThe song is a monotonous mechanical insect-like reeling, often given at dusk. It is similar to the song of other species in the group, but has more of a sewing machine quality, and may be produced for long periods.\nEcology\nThis small passerine bird is a species found in dense deciduous vegetation close to water in bogs or near a river. Five to seven eggs are laid in a nest in a tussock or on the ground. This species is a rare vagrant to western Europe. In Britain, a small number of males have set up territories in spring, including a bird in Greater Manchester in 1995. One exceptional vagrant was photographed in Gambell, Alaska, in October 2017.\nLike most warblers, it is insectivorous.\nStatus\nThe river warbler has an extensive range and a large population size. Although its population trend appears to be declining, the rate of decline is not considered rapid enough to meet the thresholds for Vulnerability. As a result, the species is classified as \"Least Concern\" on the IUCN Red List.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.naturlichter.de/gallery2/main.php?g2_view=keyalbum.KeywordAlbum&g2_keyword=Schlagschwirl Images at www.naturlichter.com]"
