This edition featured 32 categories, including new categories for Best Background Art, Best Isekai Anime, and Best VA Performance (Hindi). Categories were revealed on December 6. Nominees were revealed on the first day of public voting, April 3. Voting closed on April 14. Presenters for the ceremony on May 25 was announced on April 3, and included presenters such as Brazilian drag pop icon and musician Pabllo Vittar, Canadian actor Finn Wolfhard, and Japanese comedy duo Chocolate Planet, with Sony Group Corporation CEO and President Hiroki Totoki giving opening remarks.\nControversies\nSolo Leveling winning Anime of the Year was described as an upset by news outlets, as it is widely expected that the award would be won by ''Frieren: Beyond Journey's End. The win sparked a debate among fans and critics; while Solo Leveling enjoyed significant popularity and won multiple categories, critics argued that Frieren'' had broader critical acclaim and a more consistent narrative. The decision led some viewers to question whether the awards were prioritizing hype and recency over artistic merit. However, it is widely accepted that due to the popularity and appeal of Solo Leveling over Frieren, Solo Leveling deserved the title.  Despite receiving 16 nominations, including Anime of the Year and Best Animation, Netflix's Delicious in Dungeon did not win a single award. This outcome led to speculation about a potential bias against non-Crunchyroll platforms, with many fans questioning whether the series was deliberately overlooked.\nNotes\nReferences"
