Dart, FAIA (May 28, 1922 – July 9, 1975), born Edouard Dupaquier Dart and known as Ned by those close to him, was a Mid-Century modern American architect.\nEarly life\nDart was born in New Orleans to parents of French descent. Dart attended the Isidore Newman School in New Orleans and the Woodberry Forest School on Virginia. After two years at the University of Virginia, he would enlist in the marines. His pilot training would begin in June 1942. Dart flew bombers in the pacific during World War II.\nOn January 19, 1946, Dart married the former Wilhelmina Plansoen, a Duke University alumna.\nAfter the military he enrolled at Yale. He studied under the tutelage of Richard M. Bennett at Yale School of Architecture, whence he graduated in 1949. At Yale Dart also studied under Pietro Belluschi, Marcel Breuer, Richard Neutra, Louis Kahn, Eero Saarinen, Harold Spitznagel, and Paul Schweikher, whom he later worked under in Roselle, IL from 1949 to 1950.\nCareer\nOne of Chicago's most distinguished architects, Dart was made a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects at age 44 and garnered 18 AIA awards. He developed his personal design style of using natural materials, incorporating a building into its site and free- flowing spaces while at Yale.\nDeath and legacy\nDart died suddenly on July 9, 1975. At the time of his death, he was a resident of Barrington Hills, Illinois. The cause of death was an aneurysm while completing a significant commercial development, Water Tower Place.
