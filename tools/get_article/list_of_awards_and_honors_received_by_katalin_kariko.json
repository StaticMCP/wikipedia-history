Karikó laid the scientific groundwork for mRNA vaccines and received numerous awards, honors, degrees and other distinctions, including the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.\nKatalin Karikó who works at the University of Pennsylvania is credited with one of the most important scientific discoveries of the 21st century. Her development of Messenger RNA-based technology and the two most effective vaccines based on it, BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna, paved the way for the effective fight against the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. Her discovery also holds promise for future cures for many other diseases.\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced on 2 October 2023 that the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine was awarded to Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman for the development of mRNA technology. The Nobel Prize in Medicine has been awarded to 227 scientists since 1901, with Katalin Karikó being the thirteenth woman to receive the prize. Together with her, and Ferenc Krausz, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics the next day, the number of Hungarian Nobel laureates born in Hungary rose to twelve.\nFifteen Nobel laureates were born in Hungary and eighteen in the former Austro-Hungarian Monarchy (including Alfred Fried, Robert Bárány, and Richard Zsigmondy), with twenty-seven recognized as Hungarian citizens in total (see also: List of Hungarian Nobel laureates).\nKarikó is the sixth laureate born as a Hungarian citizen in Physiology or Medicine and the first Hungarian woman to receive a Nobel Prize in any category.\nThis list covers only the most authoritative international scientific institutions and the most prestigious awards, and it is not intended to be exhaustive.\nAwards and honors in 2020\n* Rosenstiel Award 2020 | Brandeis University | Drew Weissman |\nAwards and honors in 2021\n* Albany Medical Center Prize | Albany Medical | Barney Graham, Drew Weissman |\n* Princess of Asturias Award | Princess of Asturias Foundation | Drew Weissman, Philip Felgner, Uğur Şahin, Özlem Türeci, Derrick Rossi, Sarah Gilbert |\n* Dr. Paul Janssen Award | Johnson & Johnson | Drew Weissman |\n* Debrecen Award for Molecular Medicine | University of Debrecen |\n* German Future Prize | Federal President for Technology and Innovation | Uğur Şahin, Özlem Türeci, Christoph Huber |\n* Golden Goose | National Institutes of Health, Tennessee | Drew Weissman |\n* Golden Plate Award | Academy of Achievement |\n* Grande Médaille | French Academy of Sciences |\n* Harvey Prize | Technion – Israel Institute of Technology | Drew Weissman, Pieter Cullis |\n* Hawking Fellowship | Professor Hawking Fellowship Committee, Cambridge, UK |\n* John Scott Award | Philadelphia University | Drew Weissman |\n* Keio Medical Science Prize 2021 | Keio University | Osamu Nureki |\n* Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award | Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation | Drew Weissman |\n* Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize | Columbia University | Drew Weissman |\n* Prince Mahidol Award | Prince Mahidol Award Foundation under the Royal Patronage, Bangkok | Drew Weissman, Pieter Cullis |\n* Széchenyi Prize | Government of Hungary |\n* Time 100 – The 100 Most Influential People of 2021 | Time magazine |\n* Time – 2021 Heroes of the Year | Time magazine | Kizzmekia Corbett, Barney Graham and Drew Weissman |\n* VinFuture Grand Prize | VinFuture Foundation | Drew Weissman, Pieter Cullis |\n* Wilhelm Exner Medal | Austrian Industrial Association | Luisa Torsi |\n* William B.
