The award is given separately for a player in both the American League Championship Series and the National League Championship Series. It has been presented in the National League (NL) since 1977, and in the American League (AL) since 1980. Dusty Baker won the inaugural award in 1977 with the Los Angeles Dodgers, and Frank White won the first AL award in 1980 with the Kansas City Royals. Twelve LCS MVP winners have been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame: Roberto Alomar, George Brett, Dennis Eckersley, Rickey Henderson, David Ortiz, Kirby Puckett, CC Sabathia, Ozzie Smith, Mariano Rivera, Iván Rodríguez, John Smoltz, and Willie Stargell.\nThree players have won the award twice: Steve Garvey (1978, 1984), Dave Stewart (1990, 1993), and Orel Hershiser (1988, 1995). Incidentally, all three of these players won their two awards with two different teams. Building off of this, Garvey is the only player to win NLCS MVP twice, Stewart the only player to win ALCS MVP twice, and Hershiser the only one to win in both leagues. Nine players have gone on to win the World Series MVP Award in the same season in which they won the LCS MVP—eight from the NL and one from the AL. Three players have won while playing for the losing team in the series: Fred Lynn played for the 1982 California Angels; Mike Scott pitched for the 1986 Houston Astros; and Jeffrey Leonard played for the 1987 San Francisco Giants. Two players have shared the award in the same year three times, all in the NL; Rob Dibble and Randy Myers for the 1990 Cincinnati Reds, the Chicago Cubs' Jon Lester and Javier Báez in 2016, and Chris Taylor and Justin Turner of the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2017.\nAdam Kennedy won the 2002 ALCS MVP when he hit three home runs in a single game; he had hit 7 during the regular season and hit 80 in his 14-year career. Nelson Cruz won the award in the 2011 ALCS after hitting six home runs in the series. Adolis García won the award after having 15 RBIs during the 2023 ALCS. From the pitcher's mound, Steve Avery threw  innings without giving up a run in the 1991 NLCS, and John Smoltz amassed 19 strikeouts the following year to win MVP honours. Liván Hernández won the 1997 NLCS MVP after winning his only start and earning a win out of the bullpen in relief; he struck out 16 in  innings. Daniel Murphy won the 2015 NLCS MVP after hitting home runs in six consecutive games (including the final two games of the preceding division series), setting a major league record for consecutive postseason games with a home run. Shohei Ohtani won the 2025 NLCS MVP after hitting three home runs and pitching six shutout innings with 10 strikeouts in Game 4.\nLiván Hernández (1997, NL) and his half-brother Orlando Hernández (1999, AL) are the only family pair to have won the award. The only rookies to have won the award are Mike Boddicker (1983, AL), Liván Hernández (1997, NL), Michael Wacha (2013, NL), Randy Arozarena (2020, AL) and Jeremy Peña (2022, AL).\nKey\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Year || Links to the article about that corresponding ALCS or NLCS\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#ffffbb\"|  || Member of the Baseball Hall of Fame\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#bbddff\"|  || Indicates that the player won the World Series MVP Award the same year\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#ffbbbb\"|  || Indicates that the player's team lost the series\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\"|  || Indicates multiple award winners in the same year\n|-\n| || Indicates number of times winning League Championship Series MVP at that point (if he won multiple times)\n|}\nAmerican League winners\n(2025 ALCS MVP)]]\n(2024 ALCS MVP)]]\n(2023 ALCS MVP)]]\n(2022 ALCS MVP)]]\n(2021 ALCS MVP)]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
