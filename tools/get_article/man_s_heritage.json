It was a religious program featuring prolific American actor Raymond Massey. Few details about this little-noted series have been recorded. The series aired during 1956 and was 30 minutes long. However, a 10-minute-long program named ''Man's Heritage'' aired during Autumn 1954. In each episode, Mr. Massey would narrate stories from the Bible. The series also aired in parts of Canada.\nMassey told stories from the Bible \"against a backdrop of famous paintings, sculptures, and tapestries and appropriate classical music\".
