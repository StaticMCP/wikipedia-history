It was built in two sections, with the oldest built between 1808 and 1828. The older section forms the basis of the current rear wing. About 1828, a -story, Federal style, side-hall plan was added at a right angle to the original structure. The house was enlarged and remodeled in 1907. It has a two-story, two-bay addition and a two-story rear addition built in 1855. It features a hip roof front porch. Also on the property are the contributing two smokehouses, the kitchen, and an office. Noted landscape artist Francis Speight was born in the house in 1896.\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.\nReferences"
