In the , Chelmer had a population of 3,325.\nGeography\nChelmer is  by road from Brisbane GPO. Chelmer is zoned as a residential area, and consists of low-density housing. It has many fine Queenslanders, characterised by wooden verandahs, wide stairways and roofing of galvanized iron, but in recent years solid brick homes have been built also.\nChelmer is located on a bend of the Brisbane River, between the Chelmer Reach () and the Indooroopilly Reach (), with all sides except south bounded by the median of the river.\nThere are four bridges across the Brisbane River from Chelmer to Indooroopilly to the north (from west to east):\n* Walter Taylor Bridge, a road bridge ()\n* Indooroopilly Railway Bridge, a rail bridge ()\n* Albert Bridge, a rail bridge ()\n* Jack Pesch Bridge, for pedestrians and cyclists ()\nChelmer railway station is a railway station on the Main Line railway ().\nThere are two foot bridges over the railway line (from north to south):\n* from Honour Avenue to Halsbury Street just north of the Chelmer railway station ()\n* from Honour Avenue near Richmond Street to Appel Street, south of the railway station ()\nHistory\nThe suburb takes its name from the Chelmer railway station, which was named in 1881 probably after the Chelmer River in Essex, England. The station was previously known as Oxley Point and Riverton.\nChelmer, along with its neighbors to the south was originally known as Boyland's Pocket after Thomas Boyland who leased the area for cattle and sheep grazing\nThe first railway station opened north of the current Chelmer railway station in 1876 as Oxley's Point railway station. In 1888, the station was renamed Riverton. A siding was built at the current station location in 1881, which was later converted into the current Chelmer railway station in 1889 with Riverton closing that same year.\nIn 1879, the local government area of Yeerongpilly Division was created. In 1891, parts of Yeerongpilly Division were excised to create Sherwood Division becoming a Shire in 1903 which contained the suburb of Chelmer. In 1925, the Shire of Sherwood was amalgamated into the City of Brisbane.\nIn July 1884, 226 subdivided allotments of \"Township of Riverton on the Brisbane River\" Estate were auctioned by E. Hooker & Son. A map advertising the auction shows the area to be on the Regatta Reach of the Brisbane River.\nIn November 1901, 168 subdivided allotments of \"Chelmer Estate\" were auctioned by John W. Todd Auctioneer. A map advertising the auction shows the estate to be near the Brisbane River, Chelmer railway station and the golf club.\nIn June 1914, 114 choice allotments of \"Chelmer Railway Station Estate\" were auctioned by Chandler & Russell, Land and Estate Agents. A map advertising the auction shows the estate to be near Chelmer Railway Station. Newspaper advertising states the estate is \"right at railway station, surrounded by reserve, park and railway line.\"\nIn October 1922, 135 allotments of \"Chelmer Park, No. 5\" were auctioned by Isles, Love & Co. Limited, Auctioneers. A map advertising the auction shows the estate to be on the Brisbane River.

In 1968 it became Chelmer Public Hall and is now known as Chelmer Community Centre.\nIn August 1923, 82 subdivided allotments of \"Chelmer Park Estate\" were auctioned by Isles, Love & Co. Auctioneers. A map advertising the auction states the Estate was close to the Chelmer Railway Station and the Brisbane River.\nThe Indooroopilly Toll Bridge was proposed, designed, privately funded, and built by Walter Taylor. It was opened on 14 February 1936 and replaced the Chelmer-Indooroopilly ferry service. It was renamed Walter Taylor Bridge after his death in 1956. The private company he established, Indooroopilly Toll Bridge Ltd, collected a toll at the Indooroopilly end of the bridge until 1965 when the Brisbane City Council took over the bridge.\nOn Sunday 17 December 1939, Archbishop William Wand laid the foundation stone for St David's Anglican Church with over 300 people attending. It was dedicated in 1939 and consecrated in 1971. In 2019 St David's entered in a partnership with the Anglican parish of Crows Nest (which includes the churches in Crows Nest and Goombungee) to share their ministry through a combination of services at the various churches combined with online services broadcast from St David's. It is an experiment in how the Anglican Church may operate in the future.\nChelmer Special School opened on 20 February 1978 and closed on 8 May 1992.\nMilpera Special School opened on 1 January 1984. On 28 September 1998, it was renamed Milpera State High School.\nIn 1999, Laurel Avenue was voted Brisbane's Best Street for its trees and grand homes.
