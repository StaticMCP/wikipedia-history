Blaengwawr no longer forms an electoral ward and is part of Aberaman.\nBlaengwawr became an electoral ward in the late nineteenth century with the formation of Glamorgan County Council. Blaengwawr was also one of the five electoral wards of the Aberdare Urban District Council from its formation in 1894. The other wards were Aberaman, Aberdare Town, Gadlys and Llwydcoed.\nHistory 1889-1914\nBlaengwawr first became an electoral ward in the late nineteenth century with the formation of Aberdare Urban District Council. From 1895, Blaengwawr was also an electoral ward for the purposes of elections to Glamorgan County Council following reorganisation of wards in the Aberdare area.\nGlamorgan County Council\nIn 1895, John Howell, who was already a district councillor, became the first member to represent the ward.\nHowell was again elected unopposed in 1898\nIn 1901, Howell appears to have been again returned without opposition although the result cannot be traced.\nAt the 1904 election, Howell was opposed by another Liberal candidate, Gwilym Treharne, who came within 71 votes of victory.\nTreharne intended to oppose Howell again in 1907 but withdrew before the poll.\nIn 1910, however, Treharne finally succeeded in ousting Howell, who lost his seat after fifteen years.\nIt can be seen, therefore, that Labour made no challenge for this seat at county level. The position in district election was, however, a different one.\nAberdare Urban District Council\nBlaengwawr was also an electoral ward of the Aberdare Urban District Council from its formation in 1894.\nIn 1899, John Howell was again returned unopposed.\nIn 1900, David Price Davies was returned without opposition.\nIn 1901, Llewellyn was re-elected by a large majority.\nThe 1902 result cannot be traced but in 1903,  J.W. Evans was re-elected unopposed.\nIn 1904 an additional seat was created, allowing T. Walter Williams to be returned alongside Rees Llewellyn.\nReferences"
