The house underwent five distinct periods of growth and in the process has grown from a one-room-plan plank house to an extended rambling two-story structure. The earliest section was built about 1780, with the first modification made in the early-19th century. It was later expanded during the Victorian era with wings.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.\nVandergrift-Biddle House, Junction of US Route 13 and County Road 2, Saint Georges Hundred, Biddles Corner, New Castle County, DE HABS DEL,2-BIDCO,1- (sheet 5 of 8).png|HABS documentation\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
