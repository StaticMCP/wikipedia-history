The Khitans were a nomadic people in Northeast Asia related to the Xianbei. Following the collapse of the Tang dynasty, they established the Liao dynasty in 916, encompassing parts of modern-day China, Mongolia, North Korea, and Russia. The Liao dynasty was eventually conquered by the Jin dynasty in 1125. Remnants of the Liao court led by Yelü Dashi fled westward to Central Asia where they established the Western Liao dynasty. In 1211, the Western Liao throne was usurped by a Naiman called Kuchlug. In 1218, the Mongol Empire defeated and conquered the Western Liao dynasty.\n4th century\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n! style=\"width:6%\" | Year || style=\"width:10%\" | Date || Event\n|-\n| 388 || || The Kumo Xi are defeated by the Northern Wei.
