They were mostly the daughters of newly rich American men, who married the men with aristocratic titles to improve the social standing of their family in America. In return, these American heiress brought their wealth in the form of dowries to the homes of the British aristocracy. The trend only slowed when the women of newly rich families, who had been shunned by the American high society, began to be accepted by them.\nDuring the Second World War, the first influx of American troops arrived in Britain on January 26, 1942 in Belfast, Northern Ireland. More than 1,600,000 American servicemen and servicewomen were in Great Britain by June 6, 1944, when the Normandy invasion was launched. Troop numbers gradually came down after that.\nPopulation\nThe 2001 UK Census recorded 158,434 people born in the United States.

The Office for National Statistics estimates that 197,000 US-born immigrants were resident in the UK in 2013.

This is because of the legacy of the Cold War and NATO cooperation. 17.28% of Mildenhall's population were born in the United States. In London, the majority of Americans are businesspeople and their families which ties in with the strong economic relations between the City of London and New York City or Washington, D.C. Chelsea (where 6.53% of residents were born in the US in 2001) and Kensington (5.81%) have large American communities.\nPrior to the end of the Cold War, the highest proportion of Americans resident in the United Kingdom per head of population was centred on the Scottish seaside town of Dunoon, Argyll and Bute, the former site of the Holy Loch US Navy base. At its height in the early 1990s, around one quarter of Dunoon's population was American.\nIn the 2000s, some Americans in the UK were older, ex-servicemen who returned to Britain after being based in the UK during World War II.\nCulture\nSports\nThe British National Baseball League features many American expatriates.\nNotable people\nNancy Astor, Britain's second female Member of Parliament and first to take her seat, and thus the first female sitting member of Parliament, was born in Virginia and married into the wealthy Anglo-American Astor family.\nHenry James, considered one of the greatest novelists in the English language, was born to a Boston Brahmin family and moved to London in 1869.

The Revolution began in the thirteen American colonies and United States in the late-1770s. The British promised freedom to any slave or rebel who fought the Americans on their behalf. African Americans made up over 20% of the American population at the time, which was the second-largest ethnic group in British North America only after the English and as many as 30,000 slaves escaped to British lines. The largest regiment was the Black Pioneers who followed troops under Sir General Henry Clinton. Working as soldiers, labourers, pilots, cooks, and musicians, they were a major part of the unsuccessful British war effort. African Americans who fought against the British were known as Black Patriots (modern day African Americans in the US), but rather if they were fighting for the Crown or American Independence both were mostly doing it in return for promises of freedom from enslavement or indentured servitude.\nThe British-American Commission identified the Black people who had joined the British before the surrender, and issued \"certificates of freedom\" signed by General Birch or General Musgrave. Those who chose to emigrate were evacuated by ship. The fallout of the Revolution resulted in an estimated 75,000 to 100,000 Black Americans scattering across the Atlantic world, profoundly affecting the development of Nova Scotia, the Bahamas, Jamaica, and the African nation of Sierra Leone as prominent leaders in the emerging freed black communities. To make sure no one attempted to leave who did not have a certificate of freedom, the name of any Black person on board a vessel, whether slave, indentured servant, or free, was recorded, along with the details of enslavement, escape, and military service, in a document called the Book of Negroes. Between 400 and 1,000 African Americans emigrated to London and were later given the title of Black Loyalist for their service in the British Armed forces and formed the core of the early Black British community.\nAfrican-American guitarist and singer Jimi Hendrix started to get his big break in London as part of his band The Jimi Hendrix Experience.
