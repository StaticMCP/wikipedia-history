It controlled Chattis Hill Aerodrome and Lopcombe Corner Aerodrome until 12 October 1918 when it was disbanded.\nSecond World War\nNo. 34 (Army Co-operation) Wing RAF was formed on 22 August 1941 for Army Eastern Command attached to Eastern Command HQ at Luton Hoo under RAF Army Cooperation Command controlling Army co-operations units based at RAF Bottisham, RAF Sawbridgeworth, RAF Snailwell, RAF Stapleford Tawney, RAF Twinwood Farm and RAF Westley. It was renamed to No. 34 Strategic Reconnaissance Wing RAF on 1 June 1943 with No. 12 Group RAF, RAF Fighter Command attached to the RAF Second Tactical Air Force. On 30 June 1943 the wing moved to RAF Blackbushe, then to RAF Northolt on 8 April 1944, on 1 September 1944 the wing moved to mainland Europe and used A.12 Balleroy, B.47 Amiens and Eindhoven before being disbanded on 30 September 1945.\nIt controlled various squadrons including: 2, 4, 16, 69, 140, 168, 170, 182, 231, 239, 241, 268, 309, 613, 652, 654, 656, 657.\nD-Day\nFor Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944, No. 34  was a reconnaissance wing in RAF Second Tactical Air Force at RAF Northolt with Nos 16 (Spitfire PRXI), 69 (Wellington XIII) and 140 (Mosquito PRIX/XVI) Squadrons;\nOperation Bodenplatte\nNo. 34 Wing was based at B.56 Brussels-Melsbroek during Operation Bodenplatte, the German aerial attack of 1 January 1945. The Germans hit Melsbroek hard. According to Emil Clade (leading III./JG 27), the anti-aircraft gun positions were not manned, and aircraft were bunched together or in lines, which made perfect targets. The attack caused considerable damage among the units based there and was a great success. The reconnaissance wings lost two entire squadrons worth of machines. No. 69 Squadron RAF lost 11 Vickers Wellingtons and two damaged. Possibly all No. 140 Squadron RAF′s de Havilland Mosquitoes were lost. At least five Supermarine Spitfires from No. 16 Squadron RAF were destroyed. No. 271 Squadron RAF lost at least seven Handley Page Harrow transports \"out of action\".
