In 2017, the award was changed to Best Pop Artist. The change was made to all the genre-specific awards, and was to reflect the changing release climate in which full albums had become less common. Under the new rules, an artist who has released \"an album OR a minimum of five tracks\" can be nominated.\nBenee has the most awards with four wins, followed by Lorde, Kimbra, and Broods who have all won it twice each.\nRecipients\nBest Pop Album (2010 - 2016)\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
