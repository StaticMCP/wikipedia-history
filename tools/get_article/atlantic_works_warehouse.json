Located at 80 Border Street at its junction with Maverick Street, it was built in 1893 as the offices for Bethlehem Atlantic Works, a subsidiary of Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, which was in business from 1853 until 1984 and produced steamship boilers and engines. It was the largest manufacturing company in East Boston for over a century.\nThe company moved here from Chelsea and Marion Streets, a few blocks to the northeast. The building was renovated in 2010. As of 2021, it is the home of Atlantic Works Cultural Center and Atlantic Works Gallery, an artists' space.\nPopular culture\nThe building appears in the 2015 film Black Mass in the scene in which Johnny Depp's character Whitey Bulger picks up his new recruit, Kevin Weeks.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://atlanticworks.org/ Atlantic Works Gallery official website]"
