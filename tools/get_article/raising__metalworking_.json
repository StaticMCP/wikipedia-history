A sheet metal worker is often required to raise, or bump, the work into form from the flat metal by means of a raising hammer and raising block.  The raising block is made from substance giving resistance to the blows.\nA modern term is synclastic raising, the dominant curves of the object being forged are at right angles and move in the same direction; as in a bowl. This results in a surface possessing elliptic geometry.\nAnticlastic raising, on the other hand, refers to shaping an object where the dominant axes move in opposite directions; a familiar example of this is a potato crisp. This results in a surface possessing hyperbolic geometry.\nSee also\n* Planishing\n* Sinking (metalworking)\nReferences\nBibliography\n*Finegold, Rupert and William Seitz. Silversmithing.
