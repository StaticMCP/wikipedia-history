It is made of Indiana Limestone and measures approximately  x  x . The piece was commissioned by TriMet for $25,000; twenty percent of the funds came from TriMet and eighty percent came from the United States Department of Transportation. It was originally installed in the Transit Mall in 1977, along with ten other sculptures, to make the area \"more people oriented and attractive\". Its condition was deemed \"treatment needed\" by the Smithsonian Institution's \"Save Outdoor Sculpture!\" program in October 1993. In 2008, it was relocated to the intersection of Southwest 5th Avenue and Southwest Washington Street as part of the Portland Mall Revitalization Project.\nSee also\n* 1977 in art\n* Holon (1978–1979; re-carved 2003–2004), another Portland sculpture by Wilson\nReferences"
