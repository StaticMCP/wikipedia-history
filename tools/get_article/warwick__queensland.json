The Cunningham Highway then continues west towards Goondiwindi, while the New England Highway heads south towards Stanthorpe.\nThe Condamine River often floods, which can disconnect the northern and southern parts of Warwick and close the highways. Gauges that measure river height are used to provide flood alerts to residents.

Queens Park is a major park based around the river and the highway crossing.\nThe Warwick central business district is laid out on a grid pattern and lies within one or two blocks of the long main street, Palmerin Street with Grafton Street the major cross-street. The statue of former Queensland Premier Thomas Byrnes is located at their intersection.\nHistory\nThe Gidhabal (also known as Githabal, Gidabal, Kitabal) language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Southern Downs Regional Council, particularly Warwick, Killarney and Woodenbong extending into New South Wales.
