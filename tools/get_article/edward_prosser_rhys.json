Before going into publishing he worked as a clerk at the Western Ocean Colliery in Nant-y-moel, Ogmore Valley. He later moved to Aberystwyth where he married Mary Prudence Rhys (née Hughes) in 1928, where they then lived for the rest of his life.\nHis poem \"\" ('Memory') won the National Eisteddfod in Pontypool in 1924, although it was controversial due to its homosexual content. The poem is extensively about sex, most often heterosexual but there is a short section about a gay experience. It has been speculated that it could be about Morris T. Williams, a close male acquaintance of Prosser Rhys who at the time was married to Kate Roberts.\nHe formed the publisher  in 1928. He also founded The Welsh Books Club in 1937, following a canvas for public interest in subscriptions of Welsh literature, where the reader would receive 4 books a year for the cost of half a crown.\nHe was also editor of  (Banner and Welsh Times) 1923–1945.\nOn  there is a monument to Prosser Rhys and three other notable poets from local villages who competed at the National Eisteddfod: T. Hughes Jones (1895–1966), B. T. Hopkins (1897–1981) and J. M. Edwards (1903–1978). It is located just south of  near . His grave also has an epitaph quote written by T. Gwynn Jones.\nProsser Rhys' archives of personal papers are held at the National Library of Wales.\nReferences"
