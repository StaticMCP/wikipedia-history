Such signs may be placed to deter burglary even if there is no dog, or if the dog is not actually a competent guard dog.\nHistory\nat the entrance to the House of the Tragic Poet in Pompeii, Italy, 1st century AD]]\nWarning signs of this sort have been found in ancient Roman buildings such as the House of the Tragic Poet in Pompeii, which contains a mosaic with the caption  (). The Roman work Satyricon, written by Petronius, includes a passage mentioning the phrase  painted on a wall with large letters, in the chapter Dinner with Trimalchio.\nPhilippians 3:2 is translated as \"beware of the dogs\" or \"beware of dogs\" in the King James Bible and many other editions. For example:\nThis is often interpreted as a euphemism, bad people having been described as dogs in a number of previous biblical passages. Nonetheless, the yard signs are sometimes alluded to in reference to the passage. The use of such signs in the Roman world may have influenced the author of the passage, and conversely the passage may have influenced the wording of the more modern yard signs.\nLaw\nUnder English law, placing such a sign does not relieve the owner of responsibility for any harm which may come to people attacked by the dog. Where a company employs the services of a guard dog, Section 1(3) of the Guard Dogs Act 1975 requires \"a notice containing a warning that a guard dog is present is clearly exhibited at each entrance to the premises.\" In many cases, security signs integrate both CCTV warnings and Guard Dog warnings into the same signage.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1975/50/pdfs/ukpga_19750050_en.pdf Guard Dogs Act 1975]\n* [https://www.mockofun.com/template/beware-of-dog-sign-printable/  Beware of Dog Sign Printable]"
