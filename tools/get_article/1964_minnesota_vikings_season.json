      "text": "# 1964 Minnesota Vikings season\n\nThe 1964 season was the Minnesota Vikings' fourth in the National Football League. Under head coach Norm Van Brocklin, the team finished with an 8–5–1 record for their first winning season and a franchise-best until 1969. They tied with the Green Bay Packers for second place in the Western conference, who gained the berth in the third-place Playoff Bowl in Miami on January&nbsp;3. The two teams had split their season series, with the road teams winning, but the Packers won the tiebreaker on point differential: the Vikings' victory was by just one point, while Green Bay won by over four touchdowns. In the season opener, the Vikings upset eventual Western champion Baltimore.\nTo date, this is the only season the Vikings wore white jerseys for all their home games. In January 1964, the NFL owners had approved a new rule which allowed home teams to wear the jersey color of their choice.\nThis was the first season for the forty-man roster, an increase of three.\nOffseason\n1964 draft\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:lightsteelblue;border:1px solid #aaaaaa;width:2em\"|\n|Pro Bowler\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#FFCC00;border:1px solid #aaaaaa;width:2em\"|\n|Hall of Famer\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"6\" style=\"\"| 1964 Minnesota Vikings Draft\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Draft order\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Player name\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Position\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| College\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Notes\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Round\n!style=\"\"| Selection\n|-\n!1||6\n|bgcolor=#FFCC00|Carl Eller||Defensive tackle||Minnesota||\n|-\n!2||19\n|Hal Bedsole||Wide receiver||USC||\n|-\n!3||34\n|George Rose||Running back||Auburn||\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|4||47\n|colspan=\"3\"|Traded to the Chicago Bears||\n|-\n!53\n|Tom Keating||Defensive tackle||Michigan||from Giants\n|-\n!5||62\n|John Kirby||Linebacker||Nebraska||\n|-\n!6||75\n|Bob Lacey||Wide receiver||North Carolina||\n|-\n!7||90\n|Wes Bryant||Defensive tackle||Arkansas||\n|-\n!8||103\n|Bill McWatters||Fullback||North Texas State||\n|-\n!9||118\n|Darrell Lester||Fullback||McNeese State||\n|-\n!10||131\n|colspan=\"3\"|Traded to the Los Angeles Rams||\n|-\n!11||146\n|H.

In the fourth quarter, 49er halfback Billy Kilmer caught a pass from rookie quarterback George Mira and fumbled the ball forward, which was scooped up in stride by Marshall. He unknowingly ran 66 yards with it the wrong way into his own end zone; thinking he scored a touchdown, he tossed the ball in the air throwing it out of bounds, resulting in a safety. The Vikings had a 27–17 lead at the time, and it narrowed the gap to eight points.\nOn the previous possession, Marshall had forced a Mira fumble in the collapsing pocket and defensive end Carl Eller had scooped up the loose ball and ran it back 45 yards for a touchdown. Just before that, Viking linebacker Roy Winston had intercepted a Mira pass early in the fourth quarter and returned it to the 49er eleven-yard line, setting up a touchdown run by quarterback Fran Tarkenton to take the lead.  Two weeks later in Minnesota, the Vikings defeated the 49ers again, by a score of 24–7.\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiMVv-0uek0 YouTube] – NFL Films – Jim Marshall's Wrong Way Run\nStandings\nStatistics\nTeam leaders\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=150px style=\"\"| Category\n!width=150px style=\"\"| Player(s)\n!width=75px style=\"\"| Value\n|-\n| Passing yards || Fran Tarkenton || 2,506\n|-\n| Passing touchdowns || Fran Tarkenton || 22\n|-\n| Rushing yards || Bill Brown || 866\n|-\n| Rushing touchdowns || Bill Brown || 7\n|-\n| Receiving yards || Bill Brown || 703\n|-\n| Receiving touchdowns || Bill Brown || 9\n|-\n| Points || Fred Cox || 103\n|-\n| Kickoff return yards || Bill Butler || 597\n|-\n| Punt return yards || Bill Butler || 156\n|-\n| Interceptions || George Rose || 6\n|-\n|Sacks\n|Jim Marshall\n|11.5\n|}\nNote that sack totals from 1960 to 1981 are considered unofficial by the NFL.\nLeague rankings\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=150px style=\"\"| Category\n!width=100px style=\"\"| Total yards\n!width=110px style=\"\"| Yards per game\n!width=80px style=\"\"| NFL rank\n|-\n| Passing offense || 2,123 || 151.6 || 11th\n|-\n| Rushing offense || 2,183 || 155.9 || 2nd\n|-\n!
