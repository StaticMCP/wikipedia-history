Over millions of years, this reflex has persisted as a vestigial trait, despite significant physiological changes in modern homeothermic organisms.\n''This review examines how this condition evolved from an aneural heart to the modern autonomic nervous system, with particular emphasis on the vagus nerve's development and its role from early vertebrates. It discusses the transition from cold-blooded to warm-blooded life forms, highlighting how changes in metabolic demands and circulatory regulation have rendered the once-beneficial cardioinhibitory reflex into a maladaptive in present-day humans.''\nIntroduction\nThis review offers an evolutionary perspective on neurocardiogenic syncope[1] (NCS), integrating clinical insights from cardioneuroablation[2] (CNA) with comparative phylogenetic, paleogenetic, and optogenetic data. Despite the lack of preserved neural tissues in the fossil record, indirect evidence reveals a compelling evolutionary narrative. NCS arises from a primitive vasovagal reflex, once adaptive in cold-blooded aquatic life but now often maladaptive in modern mammals. While typically benign, its disproportionate activation in some individuals leads to debilitating symptoms. Rooted in the ancient cardiac autonomic nervous system and vagus nerve, structures predating the vertebral column, NCS reflects a vestigial mechanism deeply embedded in vertebrate evolution.\nNeurocardiogenic syncope evokes profound evolutionary questions:\n1.   Why would nature create a neural mechanism to stop the heart?\n2.   What survival advantage could possibly reside in a reflex that silences the heartbeat, risking collapse, injury, or even death?\nIn this review, we show that this reflex likely evolved in primitive aquatic organisms to minimize blood loss by sharply reducing cardiac output.\nObservations from our research on patients with NCS suggest that this condition is not a disease per se, but rather a trait encoded in our DNA, a “vestigial maladaptive reflex” that once played a crucial role in the survival of ancient organisms by increasing their chances of reducing blood loss.\nVestigial Structures and Reflexes\nVestigial structures are remnants of organs or systems that have lost their original function through evolutionary processes but remain present in the body. Examples include the “pelvic bones” in whales[3], and in humans, the “appendix”[4], “embryonic tail”[5], and “auricular muscles”[6].\nThere are also vestigial reflexes like the mammalian diving reflex[7], the palmar grasp reflex[8] in newborns and the Moro reflex[9].\nIn the same way, we could consider that NCS exemplifies a “vestigial reflex” that has persisted despite losing its main original purpose. Over time, this reflex, though enhanced by evolutionary processes, has become maladaptive due to significant changes in vertebrate physiology. These include the transition to homeothermy (warm-bloodedness), the development of a brain highly sensitive to hypoxia, and the adoption of bipedal posture.\nHemorrhagic Risk in Primitive Animals\nApproximately 600 million years ago, biological mechanisms aimed at preserving life facing a hemorrhage were still under development. Several physiological and anatomical conditions at that time markedly increased the risk of mortality in the event of bleeding:\n1.     The autonomous (myogenic) heart\n2.     The closed circulatory system\n3.     A primitive and inefficient hemostasis and coagulation\nAutonomous (Myogenic) Heart\nThe first heart had autonomous rhythmic activity – capable of generating its own contractions independently of nervous system input. It probably emerged in a common ancestor of bilaterian animals over 520 million years ago, during the Cambrian Explosion[10],[11],[12],[13]. This type of heart initiates its rhythm intrinsically within the cardiac muscle tissue itself, independent from neural stimulation for the onset of contraction[14]. This estimation is supported by fossil evidence and by current understanding of the evolutionary development of the circulatory system and of the specialized pacemaker cells[15].\nThe earliest \"hearts\" were likely simple contractile muscular tubes whose primary function was to propel fluids throughout the body, enabling the transport of nutrients and oxygen23. The most direct fossil evidence of a preserved heart comes from an arthropod that lived approximately 520 million years ago[16]. However, the convergence of fossil evidence with cellular and evolutionary biology studies indicates that the first heart capable of autonomous rhythmic contraction likely emerged between 700 and 520 million years ago[17].\nClosed Circulatory System: An Innovation of the Cambrian Period\nThe first closed circulatory system, in which blood flows exclusively within vessels, emerged approximately 540 to 510 million years ago, during the Cambrian Explosion[18]. This innovation evolved independently (convergent evolution) in multiple groups, including annelids, cephalopods (such as octopuses and squids), and vertebrates. More efficient than the open circulatory model, the closed system enables higher vascular pressure and faster oxygen transport, representing a prerequisite for the evolution of larger body sizes and more active lifestyles, including predation, however, this system is highly vulnerable to bleeding.\nHemostasis and Coagulation\nThe earliest known blood coagulation mechanism, which emerged over 600 million years ago in the common ancestor of bilaterian animals, involved the aggregation of immune cells, such as hemocytes or amebocytes, that formed a physical plug to seal wounds[19].\nSubsequently, around 500 million years ago, invertebrates such as arthropods developed a gelation-based system with a protein activation to form a gel-like barrier without involvement of prothrombin[20].\nThe complex coagulation system of vertebrates, which enabled the evolution of high-pressure circulation, is a more recent innovation, between 550 and 500 million years ago. Its central advancement is the introduction of prothrombin (Factor II) and thrombin, which converts fibrinogen into fibrin, thereby forming a stable clot[21]. Genomic analyses suggest that these proteins, were evolutionarily adapted from more ancient molecules that originally served unrelated functions, such as digestion or immunity, in early vertebrate ancestors after their divergence from invertebrate chordates[22].\nThe Origin of Neurocardiogenic Syncope: Enhancing Survival During Hemorrhage\nOne of the major risks faced by early animals during hemorrhage was the myogenic heart, which maintained its contractions indefinitely, thereby sustaining blood loss in the absence of regulatory control. Compounding this vulnerability, early organisms lacked efficient coagulation systems and vasomotor responses. Specifically, vasoconstriction evolved later, initially through intrinsic vascular myogenic mechanisms and subsequently through hormonal control involving the chromaffin system before specific neural structures. This function was further refined by the sympathetic nervous system, which appeared approximately 450 million years ago, during the post-Cambrian period[23].\nThe Myogenic Heart\nThe myogenic heart model[24] was a pivotal factor in the evolutionary pressure for cardioinhibition, and consequently, of NCS. Though radical, the most effective way to halt bleeding is to stop the heart. In the primitive model of the myogenic heart, lacking neural control, cardiac pulsatility persisted indefinitely, leading to continuous blood loss in the event of hemorrhage.\nNatural evolution addressed this critical vulnerability by developing neuronal cells capable of acting directly on the intrinsic cardiac pacemaker, inducing immediate cessation of its function via membrane hyperpolarization[25],[26],[27]. These cells are the evolutionary precursors of the vagal parasympathetic neurons currently found within the atrial walls32.\nThe neurotransmitter responsible for this inhibition was likely acetylcholine, one of the most ancient neurotransmitters, with origins traced back to the Ediacaran period (~700 million years ago)[28]. This primitive neural regulation of the heart represents the ancestral form of parasympathetic control, which predates the emergence of the sympathetic nervous system by tens of millions of years.\nGiven that these early animals were extremely primitive, exhibited low metabolic rates, and lacked a central nervous system with high oxygen dependency, cardiac arrest could be tolerated for prolonged periods. This allowed time for even rudimentary hemostatic mechanisms to partially mitigate blood loss, through processes such as aggregation of circulating cells, mucus secretion at the injury site, and gelation of primitive proteins like coagulin, all of which predated the evolution of the coagulation cascade.\nAdditionally, being cold-blooded aquatic organisms, cardiac arrest facilitated diving into deeper waters, where external hydrostatic pressure helped reduce ongoing hemorrhage. Within this evolutionary context, the later emergence of metabolic torpor mechanisms (e.g., hibernation[29],[30]) significantly increased both tolerance and duration of periods of asystole and low-output cardiac states.\nThe Phylogenetic Evolution of Neurocardiogenic Syncope\nFigure 1 – Diagram representing the physiological response of a very primitive animal model to bleeding. Since the heart is autonomous, the absence of a nervous system means there is no reflex bradycardia or cardiac arrest in response to bleeding. The only way to reduce the bleeding is through hypocontractility mediated by the Frank-Starling mechanism.\nFigure 1 illustrates the physiological response to bleeding of an extremely primitive organism, represented here by the Amphioxus or the Hagfish, which lacks a central nervous system, and bones. Considering that the Frank-Starling law is inherent to the myocardium and sinus node, a reduction in venous return naturally leads to less filling, reduced distension and subsequently, decreased contractility and heart rate. This results in lower cardiac output which may help to mitigate blood loss. However, it is not a reflex response or a specific mechanism.\nThe top table summarizes some characteristics of this model:\nA. There is undeveloped nervous system.\nB. A hypothetical injury causes bleeding.\nC. There is no pain awareness, no conscience.\nD. There is no reflex bradycardia.\nE. There is no vasodilation due to the absence of the sympathetic nervous system's vasomotor control.\nF. The only probable mediator of the cardiac response is the Frank-Starling law.\nG. This animal model is estimated to have existed more than 550 million years ago. Currently they are represented by the hagfish or amphioxus.\nThis model, therefore, relies solely on intrinsic myogenic autoregulation governed by the Frank-Starling law, given the absence of neurogenic regulation. As their hearts are myogenic, they have no specific way to reduce bleeding.\nFigure 2 – Diagram of the physiological response of a primitive animal model to hemorrhage. In this new phase, there is a very primitive visceral neural system.\nFigure 2 depicts the first natural model with a primitive nervous system, consisting of a cholinergic visceral neuron located in the heart wall (neuron 1), analogous to the parietal neurons of the Meissner and Auerbach plexuses in the intestine. In chicken embryos, evidence suggests that primitive cardiac neurons develop in the cardiac wall before the neural crest. This supports the idea that these early neurons, responsible for regulating heart function, emerge independently of the neural crest, derived from placoderm, which later contributes significantly to the autonomic nervous system, including the development of more complex ganglionic structures and innervation[31],[32]. Since it is inhibitory as the atria have muscarinic M2 receptors, in cases of bleeding and reduced venous return, this neuron inhibits chronotropy, leading to bradycardia. These neurons are precursors of parasympathetic postganglionic neurons. In this very primitive animal model, bradycardia was highly beneficial, as it played a crucial role in reducing blood loss. Thus, in addition to the reduction in inotropy caused by the Frank-Starling law, bradycardia now may occur by neural drive, which is a decisive factor in decreasing bleeding and favoring coagulation. Tunicates are the most likely group representing these animals[33].\nThe upper table summarizes some characteristics of this model:\nA. There is now a primitive visceral neuron with a short postganglionic axon able to directly inhibit the heart to reduce bleeding.\nB. A hypothetical injury causes bleeding.\nC. There is no awareness of pain due to the lack of a central nervous system.\nD. Now there may be a certain degree of visceral neural reflex bradycardia by local effect.\nE. There is no vasodilation due to the absence of the sympathetic nervous system's vasomotor control.\nF. Mediators of the cardiac response are the Frank-Starling law and primitive visceral neurons.\nG. This animal model is estimated to have existed more than 550 million years ago.\nFigure 3 – Diagram of the physiological response of a primitive animal model to hemorrhage. In this case, the animal has a very primitive visceral neural system and ganglionated plexi.\nFigure 3 depicts the animal model with a primitive visceral nervous system, consisting of a cholinergic visceral neuron located in the heart wall. However, there was a significant evolutionary leap: the appearance of intervisceral nervous integration through a primitive ganglionic system (neuron 2). This system is a precursor to the cardiac ganglion plexuses and is analogous to the abdominal ganglia, such as the celiac and mesenteric ganglia. It is the “second neuron”, the ganglia neuron, that began to control the first visceral neuron 1. It is probable that a thorax had not yet developed. The major advancement in this model is that, in the event of fluid loss due to visceral bleeding, the heart would be inhibited to reduce cardiac output, decrease bleeding favoring survival. The presence of more complex neural control offers the significant advantage of acting quickly, with some degree of anticipation, before a drastic reduction in venous return. Thus, in addition to the reduction in inotropy due to the Frank-Starling law, neural bradycardia could occur by neuron 1 and in response to stimuli from any visceral organ due to interganglia connections. The development of multiple visceral sensors connected to the cardiac ganglionic system allows for the detection of potential injuries and bleeding, even before significant blood volume loss occurs. This physiology may explain some cases of NCS caused by pathologies of the abdominal viscera and mediated by a viscero-visceral reflex, without the participation of the central nervous system[34],[35].\nThe upper table summarizes some characteristics of this new evolutionary model:\nA. There are now primitive ganglionic plexuses also with short postganglionic axons capable of directly inhibiting the heart to reduce bleeding, even before a drastic reduction in venous return.\nB. A hypothetical injury causes bleeding.\nC. There is no awareness of pain due to the lack of a central nervous system.\nD. Reflex bradycardia is now mediated by the cardiac parietal neuron and by cardiac and visceral ganglionic neurons, Figure 5. This makes the response faster, more intense, and capable of reacting to distant viscera.\nE. There is no vasodilation due to the absence of the sympathetic nervous system's vasomotor control.\nF. In addition to the previous mediators, the cardiac response is now also mediated by the visceral ganglion plexuses.\nG. It is believed that this cold-blooded animal model existed more than 480 million years ago, just before the emergence of bony fishes and the neural sympathetic nervous system.  There are several surviving animals that may represent this group, with the Horseshoe Crab being one of the most studied. It is like a living fossil and has a remarkable history dating back nearly 480 million years to the Ordovician period, Figure 4. Its lineage predates the appearance of dinosaurs and even the existence of trees. This ancient creature has survived five mass extinctions, making it one of the most resilient species on Earth. The horseshoe crab's cardiac nervous system is a fascinating example of its primitive yet efficient design. Beyond the visceral neurons they have visceral ganglia that are clusters of neurons located outside the heart. They receive sensory information from various organs, such as the gut and gills, and send signals to the cardiac visceral neurons to modulate heart function.\nFigure 4 - An ancient horseshoe crab in a prehistoric marine environment. See text for details.\nThe horseshoe crab's remarkable evolutionary history and unique cardiac nervous system make it a fascinating subject of study. The Figure 5 illustrates the behavior of the cardiovascular system during volume withdrawal, simulating bleeding in a crab. At rest, the heart rate fluctuates between 85 and 110 bpm. The data show that when endolymphatic pressure drops by more than 50%, a sudden asystole occurs, followed by bradycardia (cardioinhibition) and a period of arrhythmia. Cardiac arrest and bradycardia appear to be primitive mechanisms for reducing blood loss. This response is analogous to NCS, observed in a highly primitive animal.\nFigure 5 - Cardioinhibitory response in a crab following progressive blood removal. The graph illustrates the physiological effects of hemolymph withdrawal on cardiac activity. Initially, the heart rate remains stable despite decreasing blood volume. However, after a critical threshold of blood loss, a pronounced cardioinhibitory response occurs, characterized by a marked bradycardia and transient cardiac arrest (asystole). This reflex is likely mediated by visceral cardiac neurons responding to hemolymph depletion. The phenomenon suggests an evolutionarily conserved neurogenic protective mechanism, possibly analogous to neurocardiogenic reflexes observed in vertebrates.\nFigure 6 – Diagram of the physiological response of an ancient animal model to bleeding. In this case, there is a very primitive visceral neural system, ganglionated plexi, and the emergence of a rudimentary central nervous system, giving rise to the vagus nerve.\nFigure 6 illustrates the evolution of the model depicted in Figure 3. In addition to the visceral and ganglionic neurons with short postganglionic axons, a significant advancement occurs with the development of a very primitive central nervous system, represented by the ancestor of the medulla oblongata. During this period, the appearance of Hox genes led to bilateral symmetry, a defining characteristic of the Bilateria Clade, which emerged over 500 million years ago. This symmetry enabled the connection between the visceral and ganglionic nervous systems and the central nervous system through two primitive vagus nerves, consisting of neurons with long preganglionic axons (neuron 3).\nHowever, the notochord was just beginning to emerge, and neither the vertebral column nor the spinal canal existed. Consequently, the vagus nerves traveled directly through the viscera to the effector organs without passing through the spinal canal. This evolutionary model demonstrates not only visceral ganglionic neural integration but also central management. The presence of neural control offered a significant advantage by acting quickly and with some degree of anticipation, before a drastic reduction in venous return would occur.\nThus, alongside the reduction in inotropy resulting from the Frank-Starling law and neural bradycardia from visceral neurons and ganglia, bradycardia could be strongly potentiated by the vagus nerves, which originated from centers in the central nervous system. It is highly likely that baroreceptor precursors also emerged in this model. However, the animals were still cold-blooded, and the sympathetic nervous system had not yet evolved.\nFigure 7 - Illustration showing the emergence of the vagus nerves in ancient ancestors with bilateral symmetry, such as lampreys and elasmobranchs (Chondrichthyes), which still lack a cardiac sympathetic nervous system, compared to the current model in higher mammals.\nThe table in Figure 6 summarizes some characteristics of this new evolutionary model:\nA.  Vagus nerves now connect visceral and ganglionic neurons to the medulla oblongata via long preganglionic neurons. This central command exerts a significant effect on the heart, resulting in bradycardia and even asystole.\nB.   As in earlier models, a hypothetical injury causes bleeding.\nC.  Yet, there is no conscious awareness of pain due to the absence of the thalamus and hypothalamus. However, primitive pain reflexes mediated by the vagus nerve exist, as typically 70% of vagal fibers are sensory, including pain fibers originating from the viscera. In this model, vagal responses could occur through primitive pain reflexes triggered by injury, even before major blood loss, despite the absence of pain awareness.\nD.  Reflex bradycardia now may be mediated by the cardiac parietal neuron, by the visceral ganglionic neurons, and by the vagus nerves, making it faster, more intense and capable of being anticipated.\nE.   There is no vasodilation due to the absence of the sympathetic nervous system's vasomotor control.\nF.   In addition to earlier mediators, the vagus nerve and medulla oblongata now also mediate the cardiac response. This model is likely a precursor of the current neurocardiogenic cardioinhibitory syncope.\nG.  This cold-blooded animal model is estimated to have existed approximately 450 million years ago, just before the emergence of bony fishes, and the sympathetic nervous system being the Lamprey the typical remnant.\nH.  Apparently, to enhance the defense against bleeding, the Bezold-Jarisch Reflex (BJR) is estimated to have emerged as a parallel feature during this time. This will be discussed later.\nFigure 8 - Schematic morphology of the lamprey primitive vagal cardiac nerve.\nA major evolutionary advancement seen in lampreys is the emergence of a primitive neural cardiac system featuring extracardiac neural control for the first time. It is interesting that, despite having no vertebral column, and no sympathetic system, the lamprey has two vagal nerves[36], Figure 8, composed of two ancient cranial nerve X, which provide regulatory input to the heart from the primitive bulbus. Unlike invertebrates and earlier chordates that relied primarily on intrinsic cardiac innervation, lampreys introduced a more centralized control mechanism, enabling greater adaptability to physiological demands and environmental changes. However, they have no sympathetic system.\nThe vagus nerves in lampreys play a crucial role in modulating heart rate and cardiac output, marking a significant evolutionary step towards the sophisticated autonomic nervous system observed in higher vertebrates. This extracardiac neural control allowed for more efficient cardiovascular regulation, supporting the lamprey's active predatory lifestyle and complex locomotion.\nFigure 9 – Diagram of the physiological response of an ancestral animal model to bleeding. In this case, there is a very primitive visceral neural system, ganglionated plexi, and a rudimentary central nervous system giving rise to an elementary bilateral vagus nerve. The major evolutionary advancement in this model was the development of the hypothalamus and thalamus, which gave rise to the neural sympathetic nervous system.\nThe table in Figure 9 summarizes some features of this new evolutionary step:\nA.  In addition to the vagus nerves connecting the central nervous system to visceral neurons and ganglia, the sympathetic nervous system now emerges, originating from the hypothalamus and acting directly on the heart and blood vessels. The central command has become much more complex, as it can now exert a strong vagal effect on the heart, resulting in bradycardia and even asystole, while also inducing intense vasodilation, contributing to a drastic additional reduction in blood pressure, further reducing blood loss.\nB.   As in previous models, a hypothetical injury causes bleeding and pain.\nC.  There is now pain awareness due to the presence of the thalamus, hypothalamus, and a more developed brainstem. Pain reflexes mediated by the vagus nerve can now also be processed by the sympathetic nervous system, originating from all the viscera and the skin. This provides significant anticipation, even before blood loss occurs.\nD.  Reflex bradycardia is now mediated by stimulation of the cardiac parietal neuron, cardiac ganglionic and visceral ganglionic neurons, vagus nerves, and inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system. Additionally, this model includes vasodilation to reduce blood pressure and further minimize bleeding. As a result, the response becomes faster, more intense, and defensive.\nE.   A new important feature is vasodilation, which further reduces blood pressure and helps attenuate blood loss. This enhancement makes the prevention of blood loss more efficient and rapid. This model serves as a precursor to mixed and vasodepressor NCS.\nF.   In addition to the previous mediators, the vagus nerve, medulla oblongata, and hypothalamus now also mediate the cardiac response, reducing the cardiac action of the sympathetic nervous system to lower blood pressure.\nG.  This animal model is estimated to have existed approximately 400 million years ago, coinciding with the emergence of chordates, bony fish, the vertebral column, and the spinal canal. The appearance of the musculoskeletal system created a strong evolutionary pressure for the development of the sympathetic nervous system[37], which emerged shortly after the vertebral column. Consequently, the sympathetic system is distributed through the spinal cord, forming the thoraco-lumbar paravertebral sympathetic chain. Unlike the parasympathetic system, the sympathetic postganglionic neurons have long axons, as they are far from the viscera. The vagus nerve, having evolved much earlier than the vertebral column, still maintains its extramedullary path to this day. The development of the musculoskeletal system and the sympathetic nervous system marked another significant evolutionary advancement and, approximately 250 million years ago, led to the rise of homeothermic animals. These animals had a significant evolutionary advantage: the ability to maintain body temperature and superior metabolic conditions in cold environments, where cold-blooded are disadvantaged by a drop in body temperature.\nH.  The Bezold-Jarisch Reflex (BJR), which also emerged in this phase, will be discussed later.\nFigure 10 - Diagram of the physiological response of a primitive animal model to bleeding. In this case, there is a very primitive visceral neural system, ganglionated plexi, a rudimentary central nervous system giving rise to a bilateral vagus nerve, and also the development of the hypothalamus and thalamus, which originated  the sympathetic nervous system. However, the main feature at this stage was the appearance of the brain, the most advanced superior neural system.\nThe table in Figure 10 summarizes some characteristics of this new evolutionary model:\nA.  In addition to the vagus nerves connecting the central nervous system to visceral neurons and ganglia, the sympathetic nervous system is now present. It originates from the hypothalamus and acts directly on the heart and blood vessels. The central command has become much more complex (neuron 4), as it not only exerts a strong vagal effect on the heart, resulting in bradycardia and even asystole, but also induces intense vasodilation, contributing to a drastic reduction in blood pressure, further reducing blood loss.\nB.   In this example, again a hypothetical injury causes pain and bleeding, however now it may be only pain[38], even without bleeding.\nC.  Nevertheless, there is now fear and awareness of pain due to the presence of the thalamus, hypothalamus, brainstem, a consciousness center, and a cerebral cortex. These structures enhance the response to harmful stimuli and provides the very important learning of the risk. Pain reflexes mediated by the vagus nerve and the sympathetic system, along with sensory neurons, can now also be mediated by the afferent sympathetic nervous systems, originating from all the viscera and the skin. In this model, vagal and sympathetic responses could occur through primitive pain reflexes from the viscera and, even earlier, from the skin, providing significant anticipation before major blood loss occurs.\nD.  Reflex bradycardia is may be now mediated by the cardiac parietal neuron, cardiac and visceral ganglionic neurons, the vagus nerves, and inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system. Additionally, this model includes vasodilation to reduce blood pressure and further minimize bleeding. As a result, the response becomes faster, more intense, and proactive.\nE.   An important feature of this model is vasodilation, which aims to reduce blood pressure and further attenuate blood loss. As noted earlier, this model serves as a precursor to mixed and vasodepressor NCS.\nF.   In addition to the previous mediators, the vagus nerve, medulla oblongata, hypothalamus (which regulates and reduces sympathetic activity), and the cerebral cortex (which amplifies pain and instills fear) now mediate the cardiac response. This response is capable of triggering syncope due to the perception of risk in the face of impending injury without injury.\nG.  This animal model, consisting of homeothermic animals (birds and mammals), is estimated to have appeared approximately 200 million years ago, with the significant development of the cerebral neocortex.\nH.  As the new player, the sympathetic system, may maintain the blood pressure in an initial phase of the bleeding nature had to create new alternatives like the Bezold-Jarisch Reflex (BJR), which will be discussed later.\nFigure 11 - Diagram of the physiological evolution of the response to bleeding. See text for details.\nIn addition to all the evolutionary stages previously discussed, the Figure 11 illustrates significant progress with the refinement of the cerebral cortex and the development of imagination. This ability can trigger defensive reflexes based entirely on fictitious injuries, originating from threats created by thoughts without the presence of real harm.\nIn this case, NCS may be directly generated in the cerebral cortex as a response to an imagined threat. Injury, receptors and afferent pathways are not necessary. This explains the psychogenic NCS and provides insight into the wide range of clinical conditions that may contribute to this condition. It also clarifies why many legitimate syncopal events are not reproduced by the tilt test, as it is impossible to replicate imaginary triggers.\nThe Bezold-Jarish Reflex (BJR)\nFigure 12 – Bezold-Jarish reflex diagram. See text for details.\nIn animals having only a parasympathetic nervous system, the detection of bleeding was immediate, primarily due to a decrease in atrial filling. However, with the appearance of the sympathetic nervous system, this detection became less apparent, as the sympathetic response can sustain blood pressure even in cases of significant blood loss. Consequently, the earlier mechanism of detecting bleeding—relying solely on the reduction of venous return—proved to be insufficiently reliable.\nThis evolutionary challenge likely contributed to the development of the Bezold-Jarisch reflex, which beyond atrial introduced ventricular sensors (mechanoreceptors) capable of detecting hemodynamic changes in a different way. With this adaptation, the cardioinhibitory reflex can now be triggered by two key conditions: excessive ventricular contraction coupled with low ventricular volume, irrespective of blood pressure levels. This sophisticated mechanism ensures cardiac inhibition even in the absence of severe hypotension, offering a crucial evolutionary advantage.\nFurthermore, neuropeptide Y (NPY) plays a vital protective role by directly safeguarding brainstem neurons. It achieves this by inducing a form of intracellular hibernation, which rapidly reduces the production of free radicals and enhances tolerance to periods of low cardiac output. This neuroprotective mechanism is essential in maintaining brain function during hemodynamic stress.\nReceptors\nUnlike older visceral vagal neurons, the BJR is initiated by differentiated neurons located in the ventricular walls, particularly in the left ventricle—known as mechanoreceptors (Figure 13).\nFigure 13 – Histology of the mechanoreceptors of the Bezold-Jarish reflex located in the ventricle.\nThese receptors are distinct in that they are activated by extreme ventricular contraction and/or ischemia of the heart, such as during severe blood loss (hemorrhage) or hypovolemia. This intense, volume-deprived contraction triggers these mechanoreceptors, signaling the need for a rapid cardiovascular response to prevent further stress on the heart. Additionally, chemical agents such as hypoxia, serotonin, bradykinin, and histamine can activate these mechanoreceptors, especially during ischemia or stress.\nAfferents\nThe afferent signals of the BJR are carried by unmyelinated C-fibers through the vagus nerve, transmitting sensory input from the heart to the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in the medulla oblongata. The area postrema, a chemoreceptive zone in the medulla sensitive to blood-borne signals, works in tandem with the NTS to process the incoming information, particularly during blood loss or ischemia.\nNeuropeptide Y (NPY): An Interesting Evolutionary Component\nAn evolutionary advancement in mammals is the ability of NPY to reduce neural metabolism in a large, fundamental brain area, thus increasing its tolerance to hypotension. This has been demonstrated through electroencephalogram studies in rats39.\nFigure 14 – The protective effect of  neuropeptide-Y during the Bezold-Jarish reflex.[39] Brainstem stimulation of NPY2R VSNs induces syncope.
