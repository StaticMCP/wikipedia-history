It has a \"Target Lock\" mode for tracking moving targets and enables accurate target location data.\nWarmate-TL\nThe Warmate-TL (Tube Launch) is a variant that can be launched from man-portable or vehicle-mounted tubular launchers and can be integrated with multiple different platforms such as ground vehicles, helicopters, or warships.\n\"3.0\" generation\nThe \"3.0\" generation of the Warmate system has been refined based on the inputs from customers and their combat experiences. The system is characterized by:\n*  radio range with control handover support for a total operational range of ,\n* 70 minute flight endurance,\n* Warheads designed for better firepower against high-value targets, incl. persons and reconnaissance, communications and EW systems,\n* Quiet low-RPM engine that can be shut down during the engagement to avoid detection,\n* Ability to fold the propeller blades in the final attack phase of flight,\n* Ability to operate in all weather conditions,\n* Extra control surfaces on the wings for improved maneuverability, and\n* Integration with other WB Electronics systems such as the FlyEye mini reconnaissance drone or Topaz battle management system.\nWarmate 2\nThe Warmate 2 is a newer, larger, and heavier version of the original Warmate drone to be launched from elastomeric vehicle-mounted launchers.\nThis new model features an increased  maximum take-off weight and heavier  high-explosive-fragmentation (HE-FRAG), fuel-air explosive (FAE) and HEAT warheads designed to destroy armored vehicles, command outposts and other hardened targets. The HEAT warhead is capable of penetration of 400mm of RHA. The manufacturer promotes this variant as a viable alternative to anti-tank guided missiles, allowing for engagements at standoff distances, while also simplifying target acquisition. The rest of the warheads has a  fragmentation (HE) or implosion (FAE) effect.\nThe radio range of Warmate 2 has been extended to  for a total operational range of , which translates to a 2 hour flight endurance. The flight altitude was lowered to  for lower probability of intercept.\nThe flight control is fully automatic with waypoint navigation, and an automatic video tracker with EO and thermal IR cameras allowing for all-weather operations and night combat.\nDeployment\nThe Warmate has been operated in various countries, notably participating in 2025 India–Pakistan strikes.\nUkraine has received several units of the Warmate drones as part of Poland's military assistance in the wake of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. This includes both the inter-government arms transfers and private fundraisers. Similar private fundraisers had been organized in other countries such as Lithuania, to support Ukraine in the ongoing conflict.\nOperators\nCurrent operators\n*\n**Unspecified NATO member\n*\n**Polish Armed Forces\n***Polish Special Forces\n***Territorial Defence Force\n*\n**Armed Forces of Ukraine\n*\n**Including Warmate 2\n*\n*\n**100 units\n*\n**Produced domestically by Delta-WB LTD joint venture\n*\n**Libyan National Army\n***Acquired by the United Arab Emirates in 2020\n*Unspecified Middle-Eastern operator.\nFuture operators\n*\n**ROK Armed Forces\n***Ten sets with nearly two hundred Warmate 3 strike systems in combat and training variants ordered\nSpecifications\nWarmate\n* Length:\n* Wingspan: ~\n* Empty weight:\n* Payload weight:\n* Max take-off weight:\n* Cruise airspeed:\n* Max horizontal speed:\n* Max attack airspeed:\n* Range:\n* Endurance: 60 minutes\n* Cruise altitude:  AGL\n* Flight ceiling:  AMSL\n* Warhead: Training, HE-FRAG with 300g of TNT or HEAT (penetration 200–240mm against RHA)\n* CEP: 1.5m\n* Propulsion: Electric motor\nFlight modes\n* AUTO: follows a pre-programmed route.\n* HOLD: orbits a point over the ground.\n* FLY TO: fly to the selected point with a stable altitude.\n* CRUISE: keep a particular altitude and flight direction, semi-manual control supported by autopilot in the camera direction.\n* SEARCH: slow diving flight necessary for proper target selection.\n* ATTACK: initiates the strike. The automated video tracker allows for a precise target hit even after the loss of communication.\nWarmate R\n* Range:\n* Endurance: 80 minutes\n* Weight:\n* Operation ceiling:\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.wbgroup.pl/en/produkt/warmate-loitering-munnitions/ Warmate] WB Group website\n* [http://www.defence24.com/358359,warmate-polish-loitering-munition-two-export-agreements-have-been-already-signed Warmate: Polish Loitering Munition. “Two Export Agreements Have Been Already Signed”]\n*  Mariusz Cielma, Warmate - nowy powietrzny środek wsparcia ogniowego, „Nowa Technika Wojskowa”, nr 5 (2016), s. 92–95, .\n*  Bartosz Głowacki, Uniwersalny towarzysz broni, „Rapot”, nr 5 (2016), s. 24–28, .\n*  [http://wb.com.pl/warmate-en/?lang=en Manufacturer's webpage]"
