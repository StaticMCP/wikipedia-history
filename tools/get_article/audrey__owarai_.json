The duo won 2nd place in the M-1 Grand Prix 2008 competition. The duo belongs to the management company K Dash Stage Co., Ltd.\nBiography\nFormed under the name of  in 2000, Kasuga initially was the tsukkomi (\"straight man\") and Wakabayashi the boke (\"funny man\"). After almost 6 years of unsuccessful activities, Wakabayashi was one day told by a TV playwright in person that his mate, Kasuga, is  as a tsukkomi, and that he had \"better look for another mate\". When Wakabayashi tried to explain to Kasuga what he had been told, Kasuga \"thought he was just joking.\" Rejecting the idea but swapping their roles instead, they finally started to make first appearances on terrestrial TV broadcasts in 2008. On December 21, 2008, the two made it all the way to the final round of the M-1 Grand Prix of the year from the consolation. After the first session of the final, competed and broadcast live on the same day, they were temporarily in the top position ahead of the other eight duos, but ended up 2nd overall behind NON STYLE.\nThe manzai performed by Audrey is characterized by Kasuga's trying to shoot tsukkomi but each time turning out to be terribly off-the-line boke, interrupting Wakabayashi's talks with delayed responses and frequent gags. Wakabayashi, on the other hand, either reacts fast and hard with his tsukkomi in return, or sometimes just \"ignores\" him.\nIn 2009, they were on TV commercials for major global companies such as Toyota Motor, Nintendo and KFC.\nLittle Toos\nOn the May 19, 2012 broadcast of All Night Nippon, Wakabayashi decided to call their regular listeners , combining Lady Gaga's fandom name \"Little Monsters\" and Kasuga's catchphrase, \"Toos!\" Since then, several Japanese entertainers have proclaimed themselves Little Tooses, such as Hokuto Matsumura, Yugo Kochi, Meru Nukumi, Hikaru Takahashi, and Konoka Matsuda.\nEvent at Tokyo Dome\nOn February 18, 2024, their All Night Nippon radio show event was held at Tokyo Dome. The audience at the venue was 53,000, with another 52,000 people attending the live viewing at movie theaters and 55,000 people watching the live online streaming, for a total of 160,000 viewers.\nMembers\n;\n* Date of Birth: February 9, 1979\n* 175&nbsp;cm  88&nbsp;kg  B101  W83  H98  F28.5&nbsp;cm\n* Birthplace: Tokorozawa, Saitama\n* Manzai Role: Boke\n;\n* Date of Birth: September 20, 1978\n* 168&nbsp;cm  60&nbsp;kg  B87  W75  H80  F26.5&nbsp;cm\n* Birthplace: Chūō, Tokyo\n* Manzai Role: Tsukkomi\n* Writes the material for the unit\nMedia\nTV\nRegular\n* (ヒルナンデス!) -- Nippon Television (10/5/2011-) *Every Wednesday\n* (いきなり! 黄金伝説。) -- TV Asahi (4/15/2010-) *Every Thursday\n* (キャンパスナイト･フジ) -- Fuji Television/CX (4/10/2009-)\n* (スクール革命!) -- Nippon Television (4/5/2009-)\n* (メレンゲの気持ち) -- Nippon Television (4/25/2009-) *Every three weeks\n* (ぜんぶウソ) -- Nippon Television (10/3/2009-)\n* (森田一義アワー笑っていいとも！) -- Fuji Television (10/9/2009-9/26/2011) *Every Friday\n* (オードリーさん、ぜひ会ってほしい人がいるんです。) -- Chūkyō Television Broadcasting (4/8/2012-)\n* (AKB_チーム8のブンブン!エイト大放送) -- Nippon Television (1/28/2017-4/1/2017)\n*Hiragana Oshi (ひらがな推し) →Hinatazaka de Aimashō（日向坂で会いましょう）-- TV Tokyo (08/4/2018-)\nIrregular\n* (快盗!!シノビーナ) -- TV Asahi (1/17/2009-)\n* (クイズプレゼンバラエティー Qさま!!}) -- TV Asahi\nRadio\n* (オードリーのシャンプーおじさん) -- Nippon Cultural Broadcasting (4/7/2009-) *Every Tuesday\n*All Night Nippon (オールナイトニッポン) -- Nippon Broadcasting System (10/10/2009-) *Every Sunday from 1:00 am\nInternet TV\nRegular\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090525090324/http://www.gyao.jp/sityou/catelist/pac_id/pac0007862/ Sora o Minakya Komaruyo!
