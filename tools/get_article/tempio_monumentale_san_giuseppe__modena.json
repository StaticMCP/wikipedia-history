It is a Roman Catholic parish. It is located on Piazzale Natale Bruni, just off the Northwest corner of the Este Ducal Gardens, now the University of Modena Botanical Gardens.\nThe names of the fallen are inscribed in gilded letters on the walls of the crypt. The cornerstone was laid on December 8, 1923, in a ceremony with king Vittorio Emanuele III and Monsignor Natale Bruni, bishop of Modena, presiding. The church was inaugurated on 3 November 1929. The church was designed by Domenico Barbanti and Achille Casanova. The façade decoration however was not completed till 1931 with engraved bas-reliefs by Adamo and Rubens Pedrazzi. The façade lunette over the portal was frescoed by Evaristo Cappelli, and depicts the Resurrection of Christ and the Nation takes the dead soldiers in its arms.\nThe layout of the church is a Greek cross, rising in the dome with a diameter of 15.8 meters with four octagonal towers at the corners.
