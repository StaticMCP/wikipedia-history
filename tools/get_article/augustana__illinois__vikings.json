This athletic program is not to be confused with the program of Augustana University of South Dakota, also nicknamed Vikings.\nMost teams compete in the NCAA Division III College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin (CCIW). The men's and women's water polo teams, plus the women's wrestling team, are de facto Division I members. The NCAA sponsors single championship events open to members of all three divisions (what it calls the \"National Collegiate\" format) in men's and women's water polo. After several years as part of the NCAA Emerging Sports for Women program, women's wrestling will become an official NCAA championship sport in the 2025–26 school year, also using the National Collegiate format. Men's water polo competes in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, women's water polo in the Collegiate Water Polo Association, and women's wrestling in the CCIW.\nThe university operates a number of athletic facilities, including Charles D. Lindberg Stadium for football, the Roy J. Carver Center for both men's and women's basketball and men's and women's volleyball, Swanson Stadium/Brunner Field for baseball, the Anne Greve Lund Natatorium for men's and women's swimming and diving, the Lower Campus Courts for men's and women's tennis, Carver Field for softball, Carver Wrestling Arena for men's and women's wrestling, Thorson-Lucken Field for men's and women's soccer, and the Austin E. Knowlton Outdoor Athletic Complex for men's and women's outdoor track and field.\nSports sponsored\nThe university offers 14 men's and 14 women's varsity sports.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"; style= \"text-align: \"\n! width= 150px style=\"\"| Men's sports\n! width= 150px style=\"\"| Women's sports\n|-\n|Baseball\n|Basketball\n|-\n|Basketball\n|Bowling\n|-\n|Cross Country\n|Cross Country\n|-\n|Esports\n|Esports\n|-\n|Football\n|Golf\n|-\n|Golf\n|Lacrosse\n|-\n|Lacrosse\n|Soccer\n|-\n|Soccer\n|Softball\n|-\n|Swimming and Diving\n|Swimming and Diving\n|-\n|Tennis\n|Tennis\n|-\n|Track and Field\n|Track and Field\n|-\n|Volleyball\n|Volleyball\n|-\n|Water Polo\n|Water Polo\n|-\n|Wrestling\n|Wrestling\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
