      "text": "# Micky Ward\n\n| birth_place = Lowell, Massachusetts, U.S.\n| style = Orthodox\n| total = 51\n| wins = 38\n| KO = 27\n| losses = 13\n}}\nGeorge Michael Ward Jr. (born October 4, 1965), often known by his nickname, \"Irish\" Micky Ward, is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1985 to 2003. He challenged once for the IBF light welterweight title in 1997, and held the WBU light welterweight title in 2000. Ward is widely known for his trilogy of fights with Arturo Gatti, two of which received Fight of the Year awards by The Ring magazine, as well as his devastating left hook to the body and his relentless pressure fighting style. From 2001 to 2003, Ward featured in three straight Fights of the Year. He was portrayed by Mark Wahlberg in the 2010 film The Fighter, which was based on his early career. After retirement he has become a philanthropist.\nAfter winning numerous titles at the amateur level Ward turned pro in 1985. His career was separated into 2 parts with him going into his first retirement in 1991. Then making a comeback in 1994 where he would go on to reach the top of the boxing world. With his first bout Vs Arturo Gatti being viewed as one of the best of all time by fans and writers alike.\nThroughout his career Ward was able to win over fans over with his toughness, entertaining fights and his Blue-Collar life style which has led to him being referred to as \"The real life Rocky\"\nHe is also known for having one of the biggest hearts in all of boxing never giving up no matter how much the odds were stacked against him. Managing to come back in several fights that he was seemingly compromised in.\nHe is viewed as a legendary figure in his hometown of Lowell as well as the boxing world as a whole.\nAncestry and early life\nWard's maternal great-grandmother, Annie Greenhalge (Carroll), was born in Ireland, the daughter of Michael and Mary (Flood) Carroll. His maternal great-great-great grandparents, Peter McMahon and Ann Quinn, were from County Tyrone, Ireland. They fled Ireland during the 1850s to escape poverty and arrived in Boston, Massachusetts. They settled in the Acre neighborhood of Lowell, and worked as laborers and millworkers. Ward was born to his parents Alice and George Sr. Born George Michael Ward Jr he was nicknamed Micky by his family at an early age. He grew up in Lowell with his brother Dicky along with seven sisters. Besides boxing, Ward also played a variety of other sports growing up, such as baseball, as well as earning a reputation as a formidable free safety on the gridiron and establishing himself as a worthy wrestler on the mats, even winning a Lowell city tournament in junior high. Ward attended Lowell High school.\nAt the age of 12 Ward sat ringside when his brother Dicky fought Sugar Ray Leonard. Ward later credited his brother as his inspiration for starting his boxing career. Dicky struggled with legal and substance abuse problems, but still served as Ward's trainer for his entire career.\nWards Mother Alice would serve as his manager for much of his early boxing career.\nAt an early age Ward started working as a road-paver. One time while on the job a Ward suffered a freak accident where a hand tamper went up his rear side. This left Ward in critical condition resulting in him needing reconstructive surgery. In later interviews Ward has jokingly referred to the incident as \"The biggest pain in the ass he has ever had\". Ward was fighting pro while this happened and made a full recovery 10 months later.\nAmateur career\nIn 1972, at age seven, Ward competed in his first amateur bout, the start of a successful amateur career. In 1977, at age eleven, he entered and advanced to the finals of the New England Junior Olympics, before dropping a close decision to a fighter from Lynn in the championship. However, he ended up winning the tournament the following year in 1978. With his brother Dicky by his side, Ward climbed up the amateur rankings. In 1980, he won gold in the 90-pound division at Silver Mittens after finishing runner up in 1978 and 1979. In 1983, he fought and won the New England AAU tournament, earning a trip to Lake Placid, New York for the regional finals. There, he met and befriended a 16-year-old Mike Tyson, who was also competing in the tournament's heavyweight division. Ward won the regional tournament at the 139 pound division, then earning a trip to the nationals in Colorado Springs. Ward was also a three-time New England Golden Gloves champion boxer. He finished with an amateur record of 62-10.\nProfessional career\nEarly career\nWard had his first professional bout on June 13, 1985 in Lawrence, Massachusetts, defeating David Morin by TKO in the first round. He won his second fight in his hometown of Lowell, getting a 4th round TKO victory over Greg Young.\nComing off back-to-back knockout wins in his home state of Massachusetts, Ward traveled to Atlantic City to meet matchmaker Teddy Brenner. Looking to push his career forward, Ward quickly applied to on a card down in Atlantic City. However, New Jersey Athletic Commission rules stated that fighters must wait a mandatory two weeks between bouts, so when Ward's team was filling out the paperwork to be on the Atlantic City card, they bumped up the date of his last fight in order to fall into the criteria of this mandate. The NJ athletic commissioner Joe Walcott caught the oversight and suspended Ward for an unspecified period. Walcott retired in December 1985, and Larry Hazzard took over his position, lifting Ward's suspension immediately and giving him a clean slate. Hazzard later stated, \"Waiving Micky Ward's suspension is one of the best decisions I've ever made.\"\nWith his suspension lifted, Ward made his Atlantic City debut on January 10, 1986 with a 3rd round TKO of Chris Bajor. This kicked off Ward's relationship with the city, as his next six fights would all take place there. He won all six, four of them coming by way of KO. His time in Atlantic City helped his career due to the exposure he received on national television through ESPN's Top Rank Boxing program, which dubbed Atlantic City their home base for their weekly Saturday night fights. Ward ended up with a record 28 fights on ESPN.\nHowever, for his 10th professional fight, Top Rank Boxing followed Ward back to his home town of Lowell. There, he faced a fellow top prospect out of Massachusetts, John Rafuse. The fight ended in an 8th round unanimous decision for Ward. Two more convincing wins followed, bringing his record to 12-0.\nWard got the call to be on the undercard for the April 6, 1987 \"Fight of the Century\", marking the first time he would head out west to fight in Las Vegas. Ward made the most of this opportunity, beating Kelly Koble via TKO in the 4th round. He returned to Atlantic City for his next bout vs Derrick McGuire, once again winning by TKO in the 4th round, improving to 14-0. During his next fight he came up short to Edwin Curet by split decision, losing his first professional fight. He recovered nicely though, as he got a first round TKO of Joey Ferrell in his next fight. He then picked up back-to-back unanimous decision victories over Joey Oliver and David Silva. In Ward's next fight he faced Mike Mungin. Mungin, a replacement for Ward's original opponent, came into the fight 20 pounds of muscle overweight. Even giving though Ward gave up nearly three weight classes, he was still able to put up a close fight, but ultimately lost via unanimous decision. Coming off this frustrating loss, he scored a 3rd round TKO of Francisco Tomas da Cruz in his following bout. After accumulating a 19-2 record, Ward would earn his first title shot when he fought Frankie Warren for the USBA light welterweight title, but he failed to capture the title, losing in a unanimous decision.  Ward won his next two bouts, getting a 5th round TKO of Clarence Coleman and a split decision over David Rivello. However, his career leveled off, and after some tough match making he lost his next four fights in 1990/91 (two of which were title bouts). Ward decided to go into his first retirement from boxing to focus on being a father to his daughter Kasie, and to work and live a regular blue-collar life.\nHiatus\nDuring Ward's time away from the sport, he used funds from his day job on a road-paving crew to have surgery on his right hand, which had given him problems during several bouts. The surgery used some of the bone from his pelvis to strengthen and fuse the bones in his hand. During this period Ward also worked as a correctional officer at the Middlesex House of Correction.\nDuring his hiatus many of Wards family and friends would ask him if he missed the sport he later recalled “I would tell them I was good with where I am at. I’m happy doing what I’m doing.” Ward eventually found himself back in a boxing gym when Lowell Police Chief Mickey O'Keefe asked Ward to come by his gym and work out with him a little. \"It was a no pressure offer so I did. As soon as I got back in there it felt good. I did miss it. Slowly I started getting in there a little more and more and before you knew it we were training somewhat regularly.\" O'Keefe implemented strength-based drills and exercises. The results gave Ward a new level of raw strength and confidence, helping lead him to his eventual return to the ring. Besides Ward's physical changes, there was a second noticeable change as well. Before his retirement in 1991, his style had been similar to his brother Dicky's, with lots of movement. With his new physique and his increased power, he wanted to refine his approach in the ring. Ward stated, \"I wasn't going to be dancing anymore. I was going to move forward and punch with intention.\" When his longtime head trainer, his brother Dicky, was released from jail, Ward was finally ready to make a comeback.\nWard still worked his road paving job throughout the rest of his boxing career in between fights.\nComeback\nWard made a successful comeback, having his first bout in nearly three years on June 17, 1994. He got a 5th round TKO vs Luis Castillo. He won his next four fights, all coming by KO/TKO. This led to him earning a shot at the WBU intercontinental light welterweight title vs the undefeated 31-0 Louis Veader. The bout took place at the FleetCenter in Boston Massachusetts. Ward dropped Veader with a left hook to the body in the 9th round, winning the title by TKO. He granted Veader an immediate rematch three months later, successfully defending the title, winning by unanimous decision.\nComing off back-to-back big wins, Ward was scheduled to fight Julio Cesar Chavez on December 6, 1996. The bout would be the biggest of his career. On December 1, five days before the fight, Chavez pulled out of the match, claiming he had hurt his hand while training. Against the advice of his team, Ward took a last-minute replacement fight vs Manny Castillo. The fight was a 10 round slugfest, but Ward ultimately won via split decision.\nDuring his next fight in a spot of the main card of Pernell Whitaker vs. Oscar De La Hoya, a 1997 match that would come to typify the exceptional power of Ward's left hook to the body, he scored a 7th-round knockout against the then-undefeated 16-0 Mexican Alfonso Sanchez in a fight that Ward, up to then, was clearly losing on points. Shortly before the punch, Emanuel Augustus said the fight should be stopped (which referee Mitch Halpern had threatened to do if Ward didn't \"show [him] something\"). Afterwards, HBO boxing commentator Larry Merchant called it one of the most extraordinary things he'd ever seen in boxing.\nWard's left hook to the body later resulted in a first-round knockout of Steve Quinonez, and a nine-count knockdown of Arturo Gatti in their first fight.\nAfter going on a nine-fight winning streak since his comeback, Ward earned a 1997 IBF Light Welterweight Championship fight against champion Vince Phillips, but did not win the championship, as the fight was stopped in the third round due to cuts, and Phillips was awarded the bout via TKO. This was the only stoppage loss of Ward's entire career. After the fight, he was told by his doctor that if the cut had gone any deeper, he could have lost sight in his eye. Ward took eight months off to fully recover.\nMaking his return on April 14, 1998, he got a 3rd round KO victory over Mark Fernandez. However, Ward again came up short in a title fight, as he would give Zab Judah a good fight but ultimately lost a 12-round decision. Judah later credited Ward as the toughest fight of his career. After this, Ward strung together back-to-back wins, beating Jose Mendez by 3rd round TKO and forcing a 5th round RTD of Jermal Corbin.\nWard vs. Reggie Green\nWard then found himself back in another high caliber match up vs WBA contender Reggie Green, who had taken then-WBA light welterweight champion Sharmba Mitchell to a majority decision in his previous fight. Green dominated most of the early rounds, resulting in multiple cuts on Ward's face and splitting his lip. He had Ward up against the ropes on staggery legs during the 3rd round, but he somehow didn't go down. For the next five rounds, the two swung at a frantic pace. Throughout the fight, Ward was willing to take two punches to give one, and keep pushing forward, even though this strategy had him falling behind on points. Green led on the scorecards going into the final round. Ward slowly climbed back into the fight, eventually hitting Green with a flurry of body shots, resulting in a 10th round TKO with just 30 seconds left in the fight. The bout became an instant classic, and was runner up for the 1999 fight of the year.\nAfter the fight, Teddy Atlas remarked, \"That was truly fighting. This is a barbaric thing at the core of it. It ain't always pretty but it's real. Like the mobsters say, that was a real guy up there. When it came down to what a fighter is about, Micky Ward was it. That is what a fight is and you don't see it too often no more\".\nWard vs. Shea Neary\nAfter coming off his big win vs Green, Ward traveled to London in March 2000 to challenge the undefeated 22-0 WBU Light Welterweight Champion, Shea Neary, in the co-main event of Naseem Hamed vs. Vuyani Bungu. The fight was a high-paced, action-packed slugfest. Ward hurt Neary early on in the fight with two big shots in the 1st and 4th rounds, but Neary slowly started to take over the middle rounds, being up on the score cards going into the 8th. Ward started to take over during the that round knocking Neary down with a body hook/left uppercut combo, then earning a TKO soon after winning the WBU world title and silencing the London crowd. This put a end to Neary's four year reign. At the end of the fight, HBO commentator Larry Merchant simply stated, \"He's done it again folks\".\nWard, however, never defended the title. In his next fight, he ended up in a contenders' bout vs Antonio Díaz. The fight was competitive, resulting in a razor-thin unanimous 95-94 decision loss for Ward. He then faced Steve Quinonez, making quick work of him with an impressive 1st round KO, drilling Quinonez with a double left hook to the head before curling him up with that signature hook to the body.\nWard vs. Emanuel Augustus\nWard's following fight, which saw him get a ten-round unanimous decision victory over Emanuel Augustus (then known as Emanuel Burton), was voted The Ring magazine's 2001 Fight of the Year as well as ESPN's 2001 Fight of the Year. The majority of the fight saw the two men standing right in front of each other. Ward was able to walk Augustus against the ropes for a good portion of the evening, where Augustus was more than comfortable exchanging punches. The fight has also been described as thirty minutes of chaotic, intense, non-stop carnage with both fighters throwing punches to the point of exhaustion, with Ward scoring a knockdown in the 9th round with a left hook to the body. At the end of the 4th round, Teddy Atlas stated, \"Fans, at this break, call all your friends. We're in the midst of a classic.\" The fight was later voted by network viewers as ESPN's fight of the decade.\nWard vs. Jesse James Leija\nAfter his fight of the year, Ward had a meeting with Lou DiBella to lay out a three-fight proposal for Ward. These would earn him some big money, as well as give him good opponents to enhance his growing legacy. The proposal consisted of fighting contender Jesse James Leija and then either a title shot vs Kostya Tszyu or a bout vs Arturo Gatti.\nWard faced Jesse James Leija in Leija's home state of Texas. Ward started the fight by landing a hard left hook to the head in the first, as blood began to trickle out of Leija's eyebrow. However, referee Laurence Cole paused the fight. Cole told the ringside judges to ignore the impact of the cut, because, he claimed, it was the result of an accidental headbutt. Later, multiple replay angles confirmed this to be an incorrect ruling by Cole. The fight was stopped after the 4th round, resulting in a controversial split technical decision loss for Ward.\nAfter the fight, DiBella assured Ward that he would not be penalized for the controversial loss and their previous agreement was still on.\nWard vs. Gatti trilogy\nOn May 18, 2002, Ward faced the opponent with whom he became most identified, Arturo Gatti. Little did both men know that it would end up being one of the best bouts of all time. The fight was a wild one, highlighted by its intense back-and-forth nature. Gatti came out fast, leaving a cut near Ward's eye not even halfway through the first round. The two men continued to exchange shots, but Gatti hit Ward with a low blow in the third round. The fight picked up intensity during the fifth round, a barbaric round that epitomized the next 25 minutes between the two men. Ward began to turn the bout into his type of fight: he wanted a brawl. Gatti unloaded a flurry of 12 unanswered punches that backed Ward to the ropes. Just as Gatti took a step back to catch his breath, Ward responded with his own 12-punch combo that sent Gatti spiraling back. By the start of the 6th round, both men were a bloody mess. Gatti started to take over the next two rounds. However, during the 8th, when Gatti was moving forward, unleashing combination after combination, he was stopped in his tracks by one pinpoint left from Ward, a punch which clearly hurt him. Gatti began backpedaling as Ward started to unloaded with everything he had as the 8th round came to an end. What came next was the one of the most notable rounds in all of boxing. The 9th round started with Ward walking Gatti down, hitting him with his signature tap to the head, then hitting his signature left hook to the liver, gaining a crucial knockdown. Gatti miraculously got up, and the two men continued to throw punch after punch in dramatic fashion. During the ninth round alone, Gatti landed over 40 power punches and Ward landed over 60. After one more round, the fight came to a end, with Ward winning a majority decision. It was the chance Ward had been waiting for his entire career.\nThis was named the 2002 Ring magazine fight of the year, as well as the Boxing Writers Association of America fight of the year. The bout has been acclaimed as the \"Fight of the Century\" by boxing fans and writers. The 9th round of the fight, which saw both men exchange brutal shot after brutal shot, has been referred to as the Round of the Century by Emanuel Steward and other boxing writers. It was also named the The Ring magazine Round of the Year and USA Todays round of the year. Both fighters needed care in a trauma center after the match.\nThe two agreed to an immediate rematch. In November, Gatti won the second wild fight, knocking Ward down in the third round, although he survived to finish the fight. Gatti paid tribute to Ward's tenacity after the fight, saying, \"I used to wonder what would happen if I fought my twin. Now I know.\"\nThey agreed to a third straight fight, and again the fight was back-and-forth and chaotic. Gatti pounded Ward with punch after punch early on, but Ward fought back and managed a sixth round knockdown. Before Gatti could get up, or the referee's count could hit ten, the bell sounded to end the round. The two men continued to crack each other with big shots, but Gatti ultimately won via a unanimous decision. Again, both men needed a trip to the hospital, due to the injuries they suffered. The fight was named the 2003 Ring magazine fight of the year, the third straight for Ward. Ward was the first fighter to achieve this since Rocky Marciano and Carmen Basilio had done so in the 1950s.\nWard made approximately $3 million in earnings for his trilogy with Gatti; these were the most lucrative fights of his career.\nGatti vs Ward I & III are also part of HBO's 10 best fights of the decade.\nBefore the third fight, Ward announced it would be his last. Even after promoters loosely floated a couple of potential big money fights his way, he stayed true to his word and retired.\nBy the end of the trilogy, Ward and Gatti had created a strong friendship. When asked about their bond after Gatti's death, Ward said, \"We were more than fighters; we were brothers. Every punch we threw at each other brought us closer. Losing him was like losing a part of myself.\"\nWard's fights with Gatti are still looked back on fondly by many fans and writers, and the trilogy is listed as one of the greatest of all time.\nOn August 14, 2003 a retirement party for Ward was held at Mohegan Sun in Connecticut. Jim Lampley, Larry Merchant and Lou DiBella all gave speeches at the event and Arturo Gatti gifted Ward a diamond ring in celebration of their trilogy and then showed him a matching ring he had got for himself.\nWard is still remembered for his unmatched heart, grit, brutal fights and devastating left hook to the liver.  New England sports writer Joe Gil summed up Ward's career, stating, \"After setbacks in his professional and personal lives, Ward was able to rise to the top of the boxing world due to his determination and undying desire. He was a man of the blue collared people of Lowell and took them all on an incredible journey.\"\nLife after boxing\nWard still lives in Lowell, where he is part owner of both a boxing gym as well as an outdoor hockey rink.\nHe is married to Charlene Fleming, his longtime girlfriend, who is also a former athlete.

The abuse began when Ward was nine years old and continued for approximately three years, until he gained the confidence to confront his attacker. Ward eventually faced off against Hammer in one of his first amateur bouts, winning by unanimous decision.\nWard has become a strong proponent of brain trauma education.

Having the ability to tear opponents apart with shots to the body. This includes his devastating left hook to the liver that was usually set up with a tap to the head. He had the ability to withstand lots of punishment while waiting to land the shot, suddenly dropping opponents as seen in his fight with Alfonso Sanchez.\nWards former opponent, undisputed champion Zab Judah, later stated, \"Ward had a body shot that would stop a donkey.\"\nA perennial underdog Ward was also known for his conditioning and unbreakable chin being part of many action-packed slugfests throughout his career as seen in his trilogy with Arturo Gatti.\nIt has also been stated that Ward has one of the biggest hearts in all of boxing.\nWard also very rarely relied on his defense, being much more of a hit-or-be-hit fighter. His style of fighting didn't just make him a hero in his hometown of Lowell, but also a favorite among all boxing fans.\nWhen asked about his style of fighting Ward stated \"Sometimes it wasn't the smartest thing,\" \"That's the only way I know how to do it, is fight.\" \"Boxing is a craft of hit and not get hit,\". \"With me, it was hit and get hit more.\"\nProfessional boxing
