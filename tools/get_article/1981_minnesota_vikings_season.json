They finished with a 7–9 record, and missed the playoffs for the second time in three seasons.\nThe Vikings attempted 709 passes in 1981 (44.3 per game), a league record that stood for 30 years until it was broken by the 2012 Detroit Lions.\nThis would be the final season that the Vikings played their home games outdoors until 2014.\nOffseason\n1981 draft\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|style=\"background-color:lightsteelblue;border:1px solid #aaaaaa;width:2em\"|\n|Pro Bowler\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"6\" style=\"\"| 1981 Minnesota Vikings Draft\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Draft order\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Player name\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Position\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| College\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Notes\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Round\n!style=\"\"| Selection\n|-\n! 1 || 18\n|colspan=\"3\"|Traded to the Baltimore Colts ||\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"| 2 || 39\n| Mardye McDole || Wide receiver || Mississippi State || from Colts\n|-\n! 45\n| Robin Sendlein || Linebacker || Texas ||\n|-\n! 52\n| Jarvis Redwine || Running back || Nebraska || from Rams via Redskins and Colts\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 3 || 71\n|colspan=\"3\"| Traded to the New Orleans Saints ||\n|-\n! 74\n| Tim Irwin || Offensive tackle || Tennessee || from Patriots\n|-\n! 4 || 101\n| John Swain || Cornerback || Miami (FL) ||\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 5 || 123\n| Wendell Ray || Defensive end || Missouri || from Colts\n|-\n! 128\n|colspan=\"3\"| Traded to the New Orleans Saints ||\n|-\n! 6 || 154\n|colspan=\"3\"| Traded to the Miami Dolphins ||\n|-\n! 7 || 184\n| Don Shaver || Running back || Kutztown ||\n|-\n! 8 || 210\n|bgcolor=lightsteelblue| Wade Wilson || Quarterback || East Texas State ||\n|-\n! 9 || 237\n|colspan=\"3\"| Traded to the Seattle Seahawks ||\n|-\n! 10 || 266\n| James Murphy || Wide receiver || Utah State ||\n|-\n! 11 || 293\n| Bill Stephanos || Offensive tackle || Boston College ||\n|-\n! 12 || 320\n| Brian Williams || Tight end || Southern ||\n|}\nNotes\nRoster\n|Running Backs=\n|Wide Receivers=\n|Tight Ends=\n|Offensive Linemen=\n|Defensive Linemen=\n|Linebackers=\n|Defensive Backs=\n|Special Teams=\n|Reserve Lists=\n|Practice Squad=\n}}\nPreseason\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

After splitting their next four games, the Vikings were 7–4 and poised for a playoff run—however, they lost their last five games to close out the year.\nThe Vikings were led by quarterback Tommy Kramer, who enjoyed the most productive season of his career, throwing for 3,912 yards and 26 touchdowns. However, Kramer also threw 24 interceptions in 1981. The Vikings set an NFL record for pass attempts with 709.\nA trio of offensive standouts paced the Vikings in 1981 at the skill positions. Running back Ted Brown was the team's main ball carrier, rushing for 1,063 yards, and also came in third in the NFL with 83 pass receptions; he scored eight touchdowns. Veteran wide receiver Sammy White also eclipsed the 1,000 yard mark for the first time in his career (1,001) and tight end Joe Senser, who would later become a color analyst on radio for the Vikings, logged 1,004 yards receiving with eight touchdowns; Senser went to the Pro Bowl for the 1981 season.\nSchedule\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
