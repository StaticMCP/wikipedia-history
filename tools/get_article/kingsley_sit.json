In the 1988 Legislative Council election, he successfully gained a seat in the South Kowloon electoral college.\nIn June 1991, Sit put forward a motion to urge the government to resume the carrying out of the death penalty immediately. The death penalty in Hong Kong was mandatory sentence for murder, however no executive had been carried out since 1967. The motion was defeated and Martin Lee's amended motion of abolishing the death penalty was passed. The death penalty was repealed in 1993.\nKingsley Sit strongly opposed the decriminalisation of homosexuality. In the council meeting on 10 July 1991, he stated that  \"decriminalization, of homosexuality is contrary to the moral standards of the traditional Chinese society.\"\nSit was defeated in the elections to the Legislative Council in September 1991 general election, 1991 by-election in December 1995 and 1996 election within the Selection Committee for the Provisional Legislative Council.\nAfter the handover of Hong Kong, he was elected to the 800-member Election Committee which is responsible for electing the Chief Executive of Hong Kong in 2005 and 2006 through Heung Yee Kuk.\nThe powerful Heung Yee Kuk chairman Lau Wong-fat is the brother of Kingsley Sit's wife.\nReferences"
