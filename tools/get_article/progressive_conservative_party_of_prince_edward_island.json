The party and its rival, the Prince Edward Island Liberal Party, have alternated in power since responsible government was granted in 1851.\nHistory\nThe policies of the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives (PCs) are very similar. The major differences are in their allegiances to federal parties and in personalities. The PC Party began as the Conservative Party of Prince Edward Island, and changed its name in 1942 to reflect the development of the federal Progressive Conservative Party.\nThe Progressive Conservatives formed the government in Prince Edward Island under Premier Pat Binns, starting in 1996. The party lost its bid for a fourth mandate in 2007.\nIn October 2010, following the resignation of Binns as party leader (in 2007), a leadership election was held. Jim Bagnall became interim leader of the party in 2010 when previous interim leader MLA Olive Crane resigned the post to seek the permanent leadership of the party.\nCrane won the PC leadership in October 2010, and served for over two years. She resigned as party leader on 31 January 2013, and was succeeded by Steven Myers as interim leader.\nRob Lantz was elected leader of the party at a leadership election on February 28, 2015, at the University of Prince Edward Island Sports Centre, but resigned on September 23, 2015, after failing to win a seat in the 2015 provincial election.\nOn October 15, 2015, the party chose Borden-Kinkora MLA Jamie Fox as interim leader\nJames Aylward, MLA for Stratford-Kinlock, defeated Brad Trivers and was chosen leader on October 19, 2017, replacing interim leader Jamie Fox.\nOn September 17, 2018, Aylward announced his pending resignation as leader, effective upon the election of his successor on February 9, 2019.\nDennis King was elected leader of the party, succeeding Aylward. King resigned in 2025 and was replaced by former leader Lantz as interim leader.\nTraditionally, the Tories have done better among Protestant voters, while Liberals have had more support from Catholics. Politics on the island, however, has never been sectarian, and both parties have always had voters and members from both populations. Indeed, it has been the custom until recently for a Liberal incumbent of one denomination to be opposed by a Tory challenger of the same denomination and vice versa. This had tended to minimise religious sectarianism within the parties. The Liberals have also traditionally enjoyed the support of the province's small Acadian population concentrated in Prince County at the west end of the island. Progressive Conservative support has tended to be greater on the eastern half of the island.\nCurrent MLAs\n* Gilles Arsenault, Evangeline-Miscouche\n* Zack Bell, Charlottetown-Winsloe\n* Jill Burridge, Stratford-Keppoch\n* Darlene Compton, Belfast-Murray River\n* Robin Croucher, Souris-Elmira\n* Cory Deagle, Montague-Kilmuir\n* Tyler DesRoches, Summerside-Wilmot\n* Susie Dillon, Charlottetown-Belvedere\n* Kent Dollar, Brackley-Hunter River\n* Rob Lantz, Charlottetown-Brighton\n* Ernie Hudson, Alberton-Bloomfield\n* Sidney MacEwen, Morell-Donagh\n* Hilton MacLennan, Tyne Valley-Sherbrooke\n* Mark McLane, Cornwall-Meadowbank\n* Matthew MacKay, Kensington-Malpeque\n* Barb Ramsay, Summerside-South Drive\n* Jenn Redmond, Mermaid-Stratford\n* Bloyce Thompson, Stanhope-Marshfield\n* Brad Trivers, Rustico-Emerald\nElectoral performance\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!
