It evaluates these conformity assessment bodies and then accredits them where they are found to meet relevant internationally specified standards.\nFunctions\n*UKAS assesses conformity assessment bodies for competence against internationally recognised standards\n*UKAS accredits (recognising competence of organisations to provide conformity assessment tasks)\n*UKAS issues accreditation certificates and schedules showing the limits of the accreditation for a particular conformity assessment body and permits the use of the UKAS mark on accredited certification provided that it is accompanied by the UKAS Accreditation Number of the accredited body.  The validity of an accreditation should be checked on the UKAS website. UKAS certificates do not bear an expiry date.\nHistory\nUKAS was set up in 1995 under a memorandum of understanding with the British government (between UKAS and the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry). It resulted from the merger in 1995 of NAMAS (National Measurement Accreditation Service) and NACCB (National Accreditation Council for Certification Bodies). NAMAS was itself the result of a merger in 1985 of NATLAS (National Testing Laboratory Accreditation Scheme) formed in 1981 and BCS (British Calibration Service) formed in 1966.\nStructure\nUKAS is a non-profit-distributing private company. It is operated in the public interest as a company limited by guarantee.
