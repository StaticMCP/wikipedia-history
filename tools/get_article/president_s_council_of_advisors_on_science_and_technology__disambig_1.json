Bush, was re-chartered by Barack Obama's April 21, 2010, , by Donald Trump's October 22, 2019, , by Joe Biden's February 1, 2021,  and by Donald Trump again on January 23, 2025 with [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/presidents-council-of-advisors-on-science-and-technology/ Executive Order 14177].\nHistory\nThe council follows a tradition of presidential advisory panels focused on science and technology that dates back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Science Advisory Board, continued by President Harry Truman. Renamed the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) by Dwight Eisenhower, it was disbanded by President Richard Nixon.\nReagan science advisor Jay Keyworth re-established a smaller \"White House Science Council\" It reported, however, to him, not directly to the president. Renamed PCAST, and reporting directly to the president, a new council was chartered by President George H.&nbsp;W. Bush in 1990, enabling the president to receive advice directly from the private and academic sectors on technology, scientific research priorities, and mathematics and science education.\nMission\nThe President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology mission is to provide advice to the president and the Executive Office of the President. PCAST makes policy recommendations in areas such as understanding of science, technology, and innovation. PCAST is administered by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP).\nRecent PCAST reports have addressed antibiotic resistance, education technology (with a focus on MOOCs), cybersecurity, climate change,  networking and information technology, and agricultural preparedness, among many others.\nMembers and structure\nPCAST has been enlarged since its inception and currently consists of 24 members and three co-chairs. The council members, distinguished individuals appointed by the president, are drawn from industry, education, research institutions, and other NGOs. The council is administered by an executive director.\nPCAST membership under President Biden\nOn February 1, 2021, less than a month into his presidency, President Biden issued an executive order reestablishing the PCAST.
