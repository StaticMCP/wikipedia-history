It offers higher-secondary education (HSC), bachelor's degree and master's degree programs that were affiliated to the University of Dhaka from February 2017 to January 2025.\nHistory\nGovernment Shaheed Suhrawardy College was established on 11 November 1949 as the Quaid-i-Azam College. Professor Syed Zahir Ahsan of the Bihar Provincial Service became the first principal of the college in 1950. On 15 April 1954, A. M. A. R. Fatemi became principal of the college.\nThe Governor of East Pakistan, A. K. Fazlul Huq, inaugurated science courses in 1956. Governor of East Pakistan, Zakir Husain, inaugurated graduate courses at the college.\nAfter the Independence of Bangladesh in 1971, the college was renamed as Shaheed Suhrawardy College. In 1984, the college was nationalized and the word government added to the name.\nIn September 2005, the president of the college unit of the Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal was gunned down in the college.\nGovernment Shaheed Suhrawardy College is one of seven affiliated colleges under the University of Dhaka since 2017. The other affiliated colleges are Begum Badrunnesa Government Girls' College, Dhaka College, Eden Mohila College, Government Bangla College, Government Titumir College, and Kabi Nazrul Government College. The affiliation has drawn criticism from students of the University of Dhaka and the affiliated colleges who claim that the University of Dhaka does not have the manpower to run the seven colleges.\nAcademics\nFaculty of Arts\n* Bangla\n* English\n* History\n* Philosophy\n* Islamic History and Culture\n* Islamic Studies\nFaculty of Social Science\n* Economics\n* Political Science\n* Social Work\nFaculty of Science\n* Physics\n* Chemistry\n* Zoology\n* Botany\n* Soil Science\n* Mathematics\n* Geography and Environment\nFaculty of Business Administration\n* Accounting\n* Management\nInternational Club:\n* Leo Club of Government Shahid Suhrawardy College\nSince 24 October, 2024\nFounder: Leo Md.
