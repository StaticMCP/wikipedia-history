After taking power, Archaeanax caused the cities of Theodosia and Nymphaeum to withdraw from the league. Throughout their reign, Panticapaeum and her surrounding cities had an age of economic growth as well as the construction of new temples and replanning of all city parts. They were later succeeded by a hellenized family of Thracians, called the Spartocids.\nReferences"
