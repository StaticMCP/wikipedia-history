The 2008 Pacific typhoon season officially started on January 1, 2008 and ended on January 1, 2009.\nThe first tropical cyclone of the season formed on January 13.  The timeline also includes information which was not operationally released, meaning that information from post-storm reviews by the various warning agencies, such as information on a storm that was not operationally warned on, has been included.\nDuring the year, a total of 40 systems were designated as Tropical Depressions by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), who run the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in Tokyo, Japan. The JMA assigns names to Tropical Depressions should they intensify into a tropical storm.\nThe Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also assigns local names to tropical depressions which form within their area of responsibility. These names aren’t in common use outside of PAGASA's \"Area of Responsibility\". The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and other National Meteorological and Hydrological Services also issue warnings for the North-Western Pacific Ocean. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center warnings are referred to numerically to avoid confusion, as the JTWC sometimes recognises a storm at a different intensity compared to the JMA.\nFor the PAGASA, 21 systems formed or entered in their area during 2008, which 10 of them directly made landfall over the Philippines\nTimeline\nImageSize = width:1030 height:275\nPlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20
