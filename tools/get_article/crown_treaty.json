In return, the emperor promised that Frederick's future self-coronation as \"King in Prussia\" would be recognised across Europe and the Holy Roman Empire. The relevant negotiations were mainly undertaken by Charles Ancillon. The coronation took place on 18 January 1701 in Königsberg; from April 1701 the now entitled \"Royal Prussian Contingent\" deployed to the Lower Rhine at Wesel. In April 1702, it took part in hostilities for the first time at the Siege of Kaiserswerth.\nSources and references\n* Hamish Scott & Brendan Simms, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pBF7lodVd4EC&dq=%22Crown+Treaty%22+1700&pg=PA24 Cultures of Power in Europe During the Long Eighteenth Century], Cambridge University Press, 05/07/2007\n* Peter Wilson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u_WNAgAAQBAJ&dq=%22Crown+Treaty%22+1700&pg=PA195 German Armies: War and German Society, 1648-1806], Routledge, 2002\n* Thomas Henry Dyer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ppJCAAAAYAAJ&q=%22treaty+of+the+Crown%22+1700.
