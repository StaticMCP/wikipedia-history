It encompasses two scenic volcanoes in the Camiguin Mindanao range that span the core of Camiguin: Mount Mambajao, which includes Mount Timpoong, its highest peak, and Mount Catarman, which includes Mount Hibok-Hibok, the island's only currently active volcano. Established in 2004 through Proclamation No. 570 issued by President Gloria Arroyo, the natural monument is an important watershed containing the only remaining rainforest on Camiguin. It supports a variety of endemic flora and fauna and is also noted for its waterfalls, rivers and springs.\nDuring the 13th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on the Environment in 2015, the Timpoong and Hibok-Hibok monument was formally declared an ASEAN Heritage Park.\nDescription\nThe  protected area stretches along the central and western interior of the island of Camiguin.

It is also the location of the Hibok-Hibok Volcano Observatory of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology.\nFlora and fauna\nTimpoong and Hibok-Hibok comprises about  of mossy forests at elevations above ,  of residual lowland dipterocarp forests at elevations above , and brush lands and open grasslands covering the remaining . The natural monument was established for the conservation of endangered and endemic fauna that live within those forests.
