Details about them are unknown. According to written records in China, their names were San (), Chin (), Sai (), Kō () and Bu ().\nTitles bestowed on the Kings of Wa\nIn general, five kings of Wa were bestowed the titles  (Antō [Dai-]Shōgun, Wa-kokuō, [Grand] General of Antō, King of Wa). In the Southern Dynasties of China in this period, there were three ranks of General titles which were bestowed to the chiefs of the subject state (located in the East of China) who sent envoy to the emperor of the Dynasty. The highest general title was  (Seitō Dai-Shōgun, Grand General conquering the East). The next high title was  (Chintō Dai-Shōgun, Grand General appeasing the East). The third high title and the lowest among three was  (Antō Dai-Shōgun, Grand General pacifying the East).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | 2rd rank General !! &nbsp;&nbsp; || colspan=\"3\" | 3rd rank General\n|-\n!

However, the Song Emperor bestowed the third general title,  (Grand General pacifying the East) on the King of Wa. There are interpretations on this fact that the King of Goguryeo stood in the highest rank, and the King of Wa stood in the lowest rank, while the King of Baekje stood between Goguryeo and Wa. But there are also other opinions against this interpretation.) or General Seitō (). The five Kings of Wa always asked or styled \"[Grand] General Antō ()\". If there was substantial difference in status among the Three General titles, King Chin and King Bu could ask the title of \"General Chintō\" or \"General Seitō\". But they did not. In addition, if the Kings of Wa stood in lower status due to their General title than the Kings of Baekje, it is strange that King Chin and King Bu asked the title of Military Governor which has the power of ruling the land of Baekje whose King had the higher General title.}} The difference of general ranks among the three states (Goguryo, Baekje, and Wa) was due to the order which each state had first sent envoy to the dynasty, and it cannot be said that the ranks of Goguryeo and Baekje were substantially higher than that of Wa. Sakamoto also points out the different view on these general titles.\nChinese records and the bestowed titles on the kings of Wa\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Gregorian date (AD)\n!

There are no records that any Daiō (great kings) of the Yamato Kingship sent envoys to Chinese emperors at all. On the other hand, the five Kings of Wa were clearly recorded in Chinese official histories. In order to explain this situation, two kinds of interpretations have been proposed and discussed.\n# The five Kings of Wa and their diplomatic activities had really existed, but the formal history book, Nihon Shoki, intentionally omitted these facts. The reason might be a policy which the Yamato kingship had adopted since the late sixth century. That is, Japan (Wa, Yamato) would not be involved in the Chinese Sakuhō tributary system and would not be a subject state of China. Crown Prince Shōtoku advocated this policy. Even in this interpretation there were still other problems, including why the Kings of Wa had only named themselves with unusual single kanji letter names such as San or Chin.\n# The other interpretation is that the five Kings of Wa were not Yamato kings, but rather local chiefs such as the kings of the Kyūshū dynasty. They sent envoys under the self-declared title of King of Wa. This interpretation could explain the strange one letter names of the five Kings. Therefore, the Nihon Shoki had not intentionally omitted the historical facts recorded by Chinese sources.\nThe first interpretation is traditional and the major stream of historical study of ancient Japan. But in this view, the identification problems arise. Many disputes have taken place over which \"King of Wa\" corresponds to which Emperor in the Nihon Shoki.\nIdentification problems\nAs the name of kings recorded in Chinese history are very different from the names of Emperors in the Nihon Shoki, the specification of which emperor was the one recorded is the subject of numerous disputes which have endured for centuries. Most contemporary historians assign the five Japanese kings to the following emperors (two possibilities are identified for the Kings San and Chin), mostly based on the individual features of their genealogies reported in the Chinese sources.\nOn the other hand, archeological evidence, such as the  inscriptions on the Inariyama and Eta Funayama Sword, also supports the idea that Bu is an equivalent of Emperor Yūryaku, who was called Wakatakeru Ōkimi by his contemporaries.\n*San  : Emperor Nintoku or Emperor Richū\n*Chin : Emperor Hanzei or Emperor Nintoku\n*Sai  : Emperor Ingyō\n*Kō   : Emperor Ankō\n*Bu   : Emperor Yūryaku\nSince Bu is most likely to be Yūryaku, Kō, who is said to be Bu's older brother, is likely to be an equivalent of Ankō, who is also noted in the Nihonshoki as an elder brother to Yūryaku. However, the Book of Song records Kō as \"Crown Prince Kō\"; there is a possibility that he is not Ankō, but rather Prince Kinashi no Karu, who was a crown prince of Ingyō.\nMeanings of titles bestowed on the kings of Wa\nIn the age of the Song Dynasty and the Southern Dynasties, there were various titles for high officials and military lords of the empire. These titles were also bestowed on the monarchs of the subject States in the Sakuhō System.\nThe King of Wa was usually granted the two titles, \"(Grand) General Antō\" (, Antō (Dai) Shōgun) and \"King of Wa\" (, Wa-Kokuō). Some Kings of Wa, such as King Chin or King Bu, asked for titles of higher ranks. The Emperor of Chinese Dynasty bestowed some of them, but did not approve every title requested.\nKing Chin asked for the titles \"\" (Shijisetsu, Totoku, Wa, Baekje, Silla, Mimana, Shinkan, Bokan, Rokkoku-Shogunji, Antō-Dai-Shōgun, Wa-Kokuō). This contains the Five Titles.\n# , Shijisetsu : Highest Rank Military Commander (General) Shijisetsu, the next higher rank was  Jisetsu, the lowest rank was  Kasetsu.  setsu is a small wand indicating that emperor gave the  formal mission to one who holds it.}}\n# , Totoku : Military Governor\n# , Totoku - Region - Shogunji : Governor/Commander ruling all the military matters of the said Region (Region, State, Province, etc.)\n# , Antō Dai-Shōgun : Grand General of Antō (Grand General pacifying the East)\n# , Wa-Kokuō : King of Wa State\nTherefore, ”\" means 1) Highest Rank Military General, 2) Governor ruling all the military matters of the Six States - Wa, Baekje, Silla, Mimana, Shinkan and Bokan, 3) Grand General pacifying the East, 4) King of Wa. The Song court did not approve the Title of  (Totoku - Baekje - Shogunji). The Song did not approve that King Chin would hold the power of militarily ruling the State area of Baekje. (King Bu also asked this power - militarily ruling the Baekje State - but the Song did not approve his request either.)\nKing Bu asked the Title  (Kaifu Gidō-Sanshi). This Title Kaifu Gidō-Sanshi is particularly high rank. The Emperor of Song did not approve, and instead bestowed the Titles \"\" (Shijisetsu, Totoku, Wa, Silla, Mimana, Kara (Gaya), Shinkan, Bokan, Rokkoku-Shogunji, Antō Dai-Shōgun, Wa-Kokuō).\n#  Kaifu Gidō-Sanshi : Person whose Position is equivalent or corresponds to the \"Three Lords\" (Highest Ranking Officials in the old Imperial Chinese governments. That is,  Jōshō (Shito),  Taii,  Gyoshi-Taifu (Shikū). (Chancellor), 2)  (Grand Commandant), 3)  (Grand Secretary).}}\nSee also\n*Kofun Period\n* Wakoku\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n* 熊谷公男『日本の歴史 03 大王から天皇へ』2001, Kodansha,\nExternal links\n* 石井正敏 (2005年6月).
