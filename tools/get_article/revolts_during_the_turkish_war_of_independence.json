      "text": "# Revolts during the Turkish War of Independence\n\nA number of revolts against the Turkish Revolutionaries broke out during the Turkish War of Independence.\nMustafa Kemal, who was the leader of the nationalist government of Turkey during the war of independence was primarily concerned about subduing the internal revolts and establishing domestic security. To achieve this, the parliament passed the Law of Treachery to the Homeland and established Mobile Gendarmerie Troops.  These revolts delayed the nationalist movement's struggle against the occupying foreign forces on several fronts. These revolts, such as those by Ahmed Anzavur, were put down with some difficulty by nationalist forces.\n{|style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:85%;\"\n|-\n|Name\n|Date\n|Area\n|Opponent\n|Goal\n|Conclusion\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"lightblue\" colspan=\"6\"| Ottoman Controlled\n|-\n| Revolt of Ahmet Anzavur\n| (2 November 1919-16 April 1920)\n| Manyas, Susurluk, Gönen\n| Kuva-yi Seyyare\n| ?\n| ?\n|-\n| Kuva-yi Inzibatiye\n| (18 April 1920-25 June 1920)\n| Bolu, Düzce, Hendek, Adapazarı\n| Kuva-yi Seyyare\n| Caliphate army, sympathetic to Islamism and the ailing monarchy, armed by the British\n| Prevention of National Forces towards the straits\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"lightblue\" colspan=\"6\"| Feudal Originated Riots\n|-\n| Yozgat Rebellion\n| ?\n| Yozgat\n| Kuva-yi Seyyare\n| 1) Çerkez Ethem, 2) Turkish National Forces\n| ?\n|-\n| Çopur Musa Rebellion\n| ?\n| Afyon\n| Kuva-yi Seyyare\n| Supported by Greeks to prevent organization of national forces.\n| ?\n|-\n| Konya Rebellion\n| ?\n| Konya\n| Turkish National Forces\n| Supported by French, British, and Italian military.
