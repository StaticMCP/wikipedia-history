For example, in the episode \"Fu Dog Day Afternoon\", Barry found an art piece worth $6,000, but he was given a credit of zero because he intended to keep it. In many cases, the values of items are estimates made on the spot by the cast members, and are not necessarily actual profits or losses. Some of the episodes were not aired in the order that they were filmed.
