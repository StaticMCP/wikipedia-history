From the 1940s through the 1960s, under the banner of the Redpath Lecture Bureau (previously Boston Lyceum Bureau), he made lecture appearances demonstrating a mnemonic approach to remembering names and faces. During the late 1950s he lectured on improved executive skills and memory for the Dale Carnegie Institute.\nEarly life, marriage, and family\nSmith was born in Ong, Nebraska in 1894 and attended Peru State College, where he received his A.B. and M.Ed and served as editor of The Peru Normalite. Smith moved to Chicago in 1920 where he married Mildred Adee and had two sons, Ivan Smith (b. 1922) and Gregg Smith (b. 1931). In 1936 he married Elisabeth Ross and had a daughter, Karen (b. 1937).\nReferences"
