Marichal also served as a professor at Harvard University. Marichal spent years in exile during the Francoist State following the end of the Spanish Civil War.\nMarichal was born on 2 February 1922 in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain. He moved with his family to Madrid in 1935. However, he soon relocated to both Valencia and Barcelona before attending school in Paris, France.

Marichal received his Ph.D. in modern languages and literature from Princeton University in 1949 after completing a doctoral dissertation titled \"Feijoo y el ensayiamo hispanico.\"\nMarichal taught literature at Harvard University in Massachusetts after obtaining his doctorate, where his courses, which focused on Spain and the Spanish language, included El Cid. He later spent more than 10 years writing his most famous work, The Complete Works of Manuel Azaña, a Spanish politician. He also published the writings and works of his father-in-law, Spanish poet Pedro Salinas, Three Voices of Pedro Salinas, in 1976. Marichal was a recipient of the Spain National Prize in Literature in 1996 for his work as a historian and was awarded the Canary Prize for Literature in 1987.\nJuan Marichal died on 9 August 2010 at his home in Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico, at the age of 88. His death was announced by the regional government of the Canary Islands. He was predeceased by his wife, Solita, the daughter of poet Pedro Salinas.
