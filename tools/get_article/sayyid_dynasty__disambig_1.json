The first ruler of the dynasty, Khizr Khan, who was the Timurid vassal of Multan, conquered Delhi in 1414, while the rulers proclaimed themselves the Sultans of the Delhi Sultanate under Mubarak Shah, which succeeded the Tughlaq dynasty and ruled the Sultanate until they were displaced by the Lodi dynasty in 1451.\nOrigins\nAccording to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, the family claimed descent from Muhammad, which is why they held the title of Sayyid. This is attested by a contemporary writer Yahya bin Ahmad Sirhindi who mentions in his Tarikh-i-Mubarak Shahi that Khizr Khan was a descendant of Muhammad. Members of the dynasty derived their title, Sayyid, or the descendants of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, based on the claim that they belonged to his lineage through his daughter Fatima. In the \"History and Culture of Indian People\" the author believes the family to have originated from Arabia however he doubts the lineage and states that Yahya Sirhindi based his conclusions on unsubstantial evidence, the first being a casual recognition by the famous saint Sayyid Jalaluddin Bukhari of Uch Sharif of his Sayyid heritage in the household of his adoptive grandfather Malik Mardan Daulat who is also referred to as Malik Mardan Bhatti by Yahya, and the second being the Sultan's noble character which distinguished him as possessing the moral qualities of Muhammad's descendant.\nAbraham Eraly also thinks that Khizr Khan's ancestors were likely descendants of an Arab family who had long ago settled in the region of Multan during the early Tughluq period, but he doubts his Sayyid lineage. A.L. Srivastava shares a similar viewpoint. According to Richard M. Eaton and oriental scholar Simon Digby, Khizr Khan was a Punjabi chieftain belonging to the Khokhar clan, who was sent to Timur as an ambassador and negotiator from the most adjacent area, the Punjab, ultimately becoming the power holder in Delhi, thanks to the contacts he had acquired.\nHistory\nat Lodi Gardens, New Delhi.]]\nKhizr Khan was originally a noble in the Delhi Sultanate during the Tughlaq Dynasty and was the governor of Multan under Sultan Firuz Shah. He was expelled from the city by the Muin tribes under Sarang Khan who occupied Multan in 1395, an Indian Muslim and the brother of Mallu Iqbal Khan, who was the de-facto ruler of Delhi. Sarang Khan was aided by the servants of Malik Mardan Bhatti, a former governor of Multan and the grandfather of Khizr Khan by adoption.\nFollowing Timur's 1398 Sack of Delhi, he appointed Khizr Khan as deputy of Multan (Punjab). He held Lahore, Dipalpur, Multan and Upper Sindh. Collecting his forces in Multan, Khizr Khan defeated and killed Mallu Iqbal Khan in Delhi in 1405. He then captured Delhi on 28 May 1414 thereby establishing the Sayyid dynasty. Khizr Khan did not take up the title of Sultan, but continued the fiction of his allegiance to Timur as Rayat-i-Ala (vassal) of the Timurids - initially that of Timur, and later his son Shah Rukh. After the accession of Khizr Khan, the Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Sindh were reunited under the Delhi Sultanate, where he spent his time subduing rebellions.\nKhizr Khan was succeeded by his son Sayyid Mubarak Shah after his death on 20 May 1421. Mubarak Shah referred to himself as Muizz-ud-Din Mubarak Shah on his coins, removing the Timurid name with the name of the Caliph, and declared himself a Shah. A detailed account of his reign is available in the Tarikh-i-Mubarak Shahi written by Yahya-bin-Ahmad Sirhindi. After the death of Mubarak Shah, his nephew, Muhammad Shah ascended the throne and styled himself as Sultan Muhammad Shah. Just before his death, he called his son Sayyid Ala-ud-Din Shah from Badaun, and nominated him as successor.\nThe last ruler of the Sayyids, Ala-ud-Din, voluntarily abdicated the throne of the Delhi Sultanate in favour of Bahlul Khan Lodi on 19 April 1451, and left for Badaun, where he died in 1478.\nRulers\nKhizr Khan\nMain page: Khizr Khan\n.]]\nKhizr Khan was the governor of Multan under Firuz Shah Tughlaq. When Timur invaded India, Khizr Khan, a Sayyid from Multan, joined him. Timur appointed him the governor of Multan and Lahore. He then conquered the city of Delhi and started the rule of the Sayyids in 1414. He was ruling in the name of Timur. He could not assume an independent position in all respects. As a mark of recognition of the suzerainty of the Timurids, the name of the Timurid ruler (Shah Rukh) was recited in the khutba. Still, as an interesting innovation, the name of Khizr Khan was also attached to it. But strangely enough, the name of the Timurid ruler was not inscribed on the coins, and the name of the old Tughlaq sultan continued on the currency. No coins are known in the name of Khizr Khan.\nMubarak Shah\nMain page: Mubarak Shah\nMubarak Shah was the son of Khizr Khan, who ascended the throne in the year 1421. Mubarak Shah discontinued his father's nominal allegiance to Timur. He freely used the royal title of Shah along with his own name, and professed allegiance to the Khalifah alone. He was the ablest ruler of the Sayyid dynasty. He defeated the advancing Hoshang Shah Ghori, the ruler of the Malwa Sultanate and forced him to pay heavy tribute early in his reign. Mubarak Shah also put down the rebellion of Jasrath Khokhar and failed to fend off several invasions by the Timurids in Kabul.and He Became a Vassal of Shah Rukh\nMuhammad Shah\nMain page: Muhammad Shah\n.]]\nMuhammad Shah was a nephew of Mubarak Shah. He ruled from 1434 to 1443. Muhammad Shah acceded to the throne with the help of Sarwar ul Mulk. After that Shah wanted to free himself from the domination of Sarwar ul Mulk with the help of his faithful vizier Kamal ul Mulk. His reign was marked by many rebellions and conspiracies, and he died in the year 1445. Multan became independent under the Langahs during his rule.\nAlam Shah\nThe last ruler of the Sayyid dynasty, Alauddin Alam Shah, ruled from 1445 to 1451. He proved an ineffective ruler, delegating his duties to his minister Hamid Khan. Hamid Khan summoned Bahlol Lodi to attack the dynasty. The Shah was defeated by him, who started the Lodi dynasty.\nSee also\n* List of Sunni Muslim dynasties\n* Persianate states\n* Saadat-e-Bara\n* Sadaat-e-Bilgram\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sayyid-dynasty Encyclopædia Britannica – Sayyid dynasty]\n*[http://www.zeno.ru/showgallery.php?cat=6708 Coin Gallery – Sayyid dynasty]"
