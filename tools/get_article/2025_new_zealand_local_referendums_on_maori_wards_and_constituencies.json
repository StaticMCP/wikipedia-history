The referendums occurred alongside that year's nation-wide local elections. The referendums were held for 37 local councils and 5 regional councils, in total 42 councils.\nThe referendums were slated to occur following the passing of legislation requiring them, a reversal by the incumbent National government of a change made by the previous Labour government.\nThe major left-of-centre political parties (Labour, Greens, and Te Pāti Māori) all endorsed the pro-ward position whilst ACT endorsed the anti-wards position. The other two government parties (National and NZ First) did not endorse either side. Most incumbent mayors endorsed the pro-ward position.\nThe final results of the referendums were that 18 councils voted to keep Māori wards and 24 councils voted to remove them, though across the country there were almost 75,000 more keep votes.\nKey dates\nKey dates relating to the local referendums are as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|early April\n|Electoral Commission sent out enrolment update packs.\n|-\n|10 July\n|Enrolment closes for switching to the Māori or general roll.\n|-\n|1 August\n|Enrolment closes for the printed electoral roll.\n|-\n|9 September\n|Postal voting opens.\n|-\n|10 October\n|Last day to enrol to vote.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |11 October\n|Polling day — The voting documents must be at the council before voting closes at midday/12:00pm.\n|-\n|Preliminary results to be released as soon as readily available afterwards.\n|}\nBackground\nThe referendums were spurred by the ruling National-led coalition government's passing of the Local Government (Electoral Legislation and Māori Wards and Māori Constituencies) Amendment Act 2024, reinstating the requirement that councils must hold referendums before establishing Māori wards that the previous Labour government had removed. Councils that had introduced Māori wards without holding a referendum were required to hold a poll at the 2025 elections if they wished to keep them.\nOnly two of the 45 councils with current or proposed Māori wards voted against holding a poll to determine their future. Several councils said they wanted to look into legal advice with regards to ignoring the government's requirement to hold polls. Tauranga City Council is not holding a referendum because they already held local elections recently in 2024. The cost of the referendums was projected to be over $2 million.\nTe Rūnanga o Ngāti Whātua appealed the decision of the Kaipara District Council to abolish its Māori wards rather than hold a referendum, losing in the High Court in December 2024. Kaipara District Council and Upper Hutt City Council were the only two councils to abolish existing or planned Māori wards.\nThe referendums followed a period of increased pro-Māori activism (including Hīkoi mō te Tiriti), spurred on by perceived anti-Māori policies by central government.\nPublic opinion\nPreviously held referendums on the issue have generally resulted against Māori wards. In the Far North, for example, residents voted 2-to-1 against them in a 2015 poll held for that district's representation review for the 2016 and 2019 elections.\nWhanganui District Council chief executive David Langford said that in submissions to the council on the topic, 53% had been in support of Māori Wards.\nIn Hawke's Bay, Hastings District Council saw 76% support for Māori Wards amongst submissions made to the council on the topic in 2021; Napier City Council saw 60% of 2300 submissions in support in August 2024.\nDebate\nArguments in support of Māori wards\nSocial justice and representation\nBridget Bell, a Māori ward councillor in the Manawatū District, said that an \"immense\" amount of effort had been made by iwi to secure their voice on council, and that the wards were crucial to ensuring they were heard and that equity was fought for. As an example, she claimed that Marae in the district now received a similar level of support as rural villages, unlike previously.\nKassie Hartendorp, in an op-ed for E-Tangata, said that Māori wards were about \"equity\". She said that getting rid of the them would \"reverse\" progress on Māori representation at the local level, pointing to a [https://tikatangata.org.nz/our-work/maori-representation-in-local-government report] by the Human Rights Commission that Māori were underrepresented on councils; as an example, only 5% of successful candidates in 2007 were Māori, despite comprising 15% of the population. She pointed to colonisation as the root course of this discrepancy. She said that through her work at ActionStation with community members, she had heard of the positive contributions and relationships that had formed between council and iwi groups as a result of the increased Māori  representation brought about by the introduction of Māori wards. She called out racism as a major driving factor of the anti-Māori ward side. She said that in a claim that she and ActionStation brought before the Waitangi Tribunal related to the Local Government (Māori Wards) Amendment Act, that the tribunal found that the law change was a direct breach of the Treaty of Waitangi.\nPere Paniora, a Māori ward councillor in the Kaipara District (whose council voted to abolish their Māori ward), said that \"undoubtedly\" council will lose their connection to the Māori community. She went on to say, \"I've spoken to many rangatahi who are proud to have a face and a council that represents them, that looks like them, that comes from the same background as them.\"\nCost savings\nWhakatāne Māori ward councillor Toni Boynton argued that the existence of the district's Māori ward has helped save the council hundreds in thousands of dollars in legal costs; local iwi had repeatedly taken the council to court over decisions they felt had been made without consulting them with regards to issues that affect Māori. Since the introduction of the ward there has been no litigation.\nArguments against Māori wards\nDemocracy and equal rights\nIn a press release, David Seymour (leader of ACT New Zealand) called Māori wards \"undemocratic\". He railed against co-governance, saying it placed group identity over individual dignity. He said that abolishing Māori wards would restore democracy to local communities.\nThe right-wing news website Centrist released an op-ed explaining some arguments against Māori wards. They said that separate representation for Māori would disrupt unity, and cause tension and resentment in communities. The op-ed said that Māori already have the same opportunities as other New Zealanders, and thus there is no need to have Māori wards since Māori should be able to be elected on their own merits as individuals. The op-ed said that proponents of Māori wards were advocating for equity of outcomes rather than equality of opportunity. Kaipara mayor Craig Jepson was quoted as saying that pro-Māori ward arguments feed into a \"false narrative\" that was \"condescending\" to Māori. The op-ed also alleged that the mainstream media was biased against anti-Māori ward proponents, saying they would focus on framing them as racist rather than engaging with the issue.\nCampaign\nPro-Māori wards\nLabour, the Greens, and Te Pāti Māori would all campaign in support of Māori wards.\nIn April, Māori ward councillors from across the country met in Taupō as part of the annual meeting of Local Government New Zealand's subcommittee for Māori elected members, Te Maruata. Many were up for re-election, and faced having to campaign both for themselves and for the continued existence of Māori wards.\nA group called Stronger Together Keep Māori Wards formed in Palmerston North, organised by Unions Manawatū. A group called For Wards Hawke’s Bay formed to support the pro-ward position at the referendums in Hawke's Bay.\nIn August, the Christian social justice organisation \"Common Grace Aotearoa\" announce it would organise workshops in 100 churches across 42 districts to promote support for Māori wards, with a focus on Pākehā audiences. Several Christian leaders including retired Anglican Archbishop Sir David Moxon, Methodist Church President Te Aroha Rountree, Catholic Church Bishop Peter Cullinae, Anglican Taranaki Cathedral Dean Jay Ruka and New Zealand Baptist Missionary Society national director Alan Jamieson have expressed support for retaining Māori wards.\nAnti-Māori wards\nACT New Zealand for the first time would put forward candidates in local elections; candidates from the group would campaign against Māori wards.\nHobson's Pledge billboard controversies\nThe lobby group Hobson's Pledge released a series of advertisements featuring a stock photo of a Māori woman with a moko kauae and the message \"My mana doesn't need a mandate – Vote no to Māori wards\". The individual woman pictured did not consent to her image being used and was distraught that her image was being used to promote a view she was \"staunchly\" opposed to. The photo was released on iStock and Shutterstock and labelled \"editorial use only\"; Hobson's Pledge said that they had followed all legal requirements for their use of the photo. The group took down the billboards.\nIn late September 2025, media company Stuff removed a Hobson's Pledge advertisement opposing Māori wards from its websites after receiving feedback on 20 September that the ad was linking to an external website that did not meet the company's terms and conditions.  Meanwhile, media company New Zealand Media and Entertainment (NZME) maintained the same advertisement on its websites, stating that it met their criteria for advocacy advertising. In response, Hobson's Pledge's leader Don Brash accused Stuff of cowering to bullying and intimidation while praising NZ for upholding lawful advocacy in a \"free press.\"\nEndorsements\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|+Organisations and community groups\n! style=\"width:50%\" | For  (Keep)\n! style=\"width:50%\" | Against  (Repeal)\n|-\n|\n* For Wards Hawke's Bay\n* Ngāti Kahungunu Iwi Inc.\n* Stronger Together Keep Māori Wards\n|\n* Hobson's Pledge\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|+Incumbent mayors\n! style=\"width:50%\" | For  (Keep)\n! style=\"width:50%\" | Against  (Repeal)\n|-\n|\n* Toby Adams (Hauraki)\n* Anita Baker (Porirua)\n* Campbell Barry (Lower Hutt)\n* Max Baxter (Ōtorohanga)\n* Gary Caffell (Masterton)\n* Jacqui Church (Waikato)\n* Martin Connelly (South Wairarapa)\n* Tracey Collis (Tararua)\n* James Denyer (Western Bay of Plenty)\n* Sandra Hazlehurst (Hastings)\n* Janet Holborow (Kāpiti Coast)\n* Tim King (Tasman)\n* Weston Kirton (Ruapehu)\n* Craig Little (Wairoa)\n* Phil Nixon (South Taranaki)\n* Susan O'Regan (Waipā)\n* Grant Smith (Palmerston North)\n* Nadine Taylor (Marlborough)\n* Moko Tepania (Far North)\n* David Trewavas (Taupō)\n* Alex Walker (Central Hawke's Bay)\n* Bernie Wanden (Horowhenua)\n* Andy Watson (Rangitikei)\n* Tory Whanau (Wellington)\n* Kirsten Wise (Napier)\n|\n* Craig Jepson (Kaipara)\n* John Robertson (Waitomo)\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|+Political parties\n! style=\"width:50%\" | For  (Keep)\n! style=\"width:50%\" | Against  (Repeal)\n|-\n|\n* New Zealand Labour Party\n* Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand\n* Te Pāti Māori\n|\n* ACT New Zealand\n|}\nQuestion\nVoters had the choice of ticking either the box that says \"I vote to keep the Māori ward/constituency\" or the box that says \"I vote to remove the Māori ward/constituency\".\nIssues\nIn mid-September 2025, Radio New Zealand reported that the candidate profiles for Māori ward candidates in the Ōpōtiki, Whanganui, South Wairarapa and Manawatū districts had been accidentally excluded from voting packs due to printing errors. Electoral officer Warwick Lamp confirmed that Māori ward electors would be sent an individual letter containing candidate profiles. In response, the Green Party's Democracy and Electoral Reform spokesperson and Member of Parliament Celia Wade-Brown called for an extension of the voting period in Māori wards. In addition, Te Pāti Māori called on the Whanganui District Council to provide Māori ward voters with correct candidate information and a full independent investigation.\nResults\nBy council\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;text-align:right\"\n|+\n!Council\n!Margin\n!%\n!
