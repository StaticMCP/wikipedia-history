It is also known as the Emille Bell (), after a legend about its casting, and as the Bell of Bongdeoksa, where it was first housed. The bell was also previously housed at Gyeongjueupseong.\nThe bell was commissioned by King Gyeongdeok to honor his father, King Seongdeok. However, King Gyeongdeok never lived to see the casting of the bell, as he died in AD 765. The bell was finally cast in AD 771, during the reign of Gyeongdeok's son, King Hyegong.\nNow housed in the Gyeongju National Museum, the bell was designated as the 29th national treasure of Korea on December 12, 1962. It measures  high,  in diameter at the lip, and  in wall thickness. The Gyeongju National Museum weighed it in 1997, and found that its weight was 18.9 tons.\nArtistic characteristics\nThe bell is considered a masterpiece of Unified Silla art. It is unique among Korean bronze bells because of the presence of delicate designs and the title text, written in an elegant literary language. The whole structure, including its decorative elements, produces a wide range of sound frequencies; the sound tube absorbs high frequency waves, contributing to a distinctive beat.\nThe hook of the bell is in the shape of a dragon's head. There are many relief patterns on the bell, including flower patterns along the rim and shoulder. There are also reliefs of lotus flowers, grass, and a pair of two apsaras (heavenly maidens). The striking point of the bell (dangjwa) is also in the shape of a lotus and sits between two of the apsara reliefs. The bottom of the bell is in a rhombic shape, designed to augment the sound reverberation.\nThe inscriptions on the bell (the title text), over a thousand Hanja, are a fine example of Korean calligraphy and carving. They provide detailed information about the bell and why it was cast.\nThe column the bell hangs on is quite firm. Even a column of the same diameter, made of a modern alloy, might bend under the weight of the bell, yet the bell still hangs on an ancient column that has lasted for several centuries.\nFile:Apsara relief.

Emile, pronounced /em-ee-leh/, is an ancient Silla term for \"mommy\".\nAccording to legend, the first bell that was cast produced no sound when it was struck. The bell was recast many times but with no success. The king that had commissioned the bell died thereafter and his young son took over the project with the help of the queen. The son carried out what his father had started but he too had little success. Later, a monk dreamed that if a child was cast into the metal, the bell would ring. The monk then took a child from the village and had her cast into the metal. When the bell was complete, the bell made the most beautiful sound when struck.\nHowever, some believe the legend may actually be a modern invention and that the story and name originated in the 1920s. A story that was published about the \"Eomilne bell\" or \"Earmilne bell\" (어밀네 종) may have been distorted in its retelling. Recent arguments suggest that the legend about bell above may have been confused with the legend of the Emile bell.\nSee also\n*Korean Bell of Friendship\n*Bell of Yongjusa\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111107024724/http://english.cha.go.kr/ Cultural Heritage Administration]"
