Established in 2007 along with the other wards, it elects four Councillors. As its name suggests, the ward's territory is based around the community of Morningside to the south of the city centre, also including Braid Hills, Bruntsfield, Burghmuirhead (Church Hill and Holy Corner), Greenbank, Greenhill, Marchmont, Merchiston and Polwarth.\nA minor 2017 boundary change in the north of the ward saw the loss of the densely populated Tollcross neighbourhood, but the overall population increased slightly due to housebuilding in other areas. At that time, the ward's name was also amended from its original title of Morningside/Meadows – the well-known Meadows park area to which this referred had never been fully within its boundaries. In 2021, the ward had a population of 31,379.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Mark McInnes(Conservative)\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Paul Godzik(Labour)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Marilyne Angela MacLaren(Liberal Democrats)\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Alison Johnstone(Greens)\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Sandy Howat(SNP)\n|rowspan=2|Melanie Main(Greens)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=1|Nick Cook(Conservative)\n|rowspan=2|Mandy Watt(Labour)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Neil Ross(Liberal Democrats)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1|Marie-Clair Munro(Conservative)\n|rowspan=1|Ben Parker(Greens)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2017 election\n2017 City of Edinburgh Council election\n2012 election\n2012 City of Edinburgh Council election\n2007 election\n2007 City of Edinburgh Council election\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/scotland/morningside-ward-city-of-edinburgh Listed Buildings in Morningside Ward, City of Edinburgh] at British Listed Buildings"
