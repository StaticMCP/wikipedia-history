      "text": "# The Tone Rebellion\n\n\"The Tone Rebellion is now available...\"\n|genre = Real-time strategy (4X)\n|modes = Single player, Multiplayer\n|platforms = Windows\n}}\nThe Tone Rebellion is a science fiction real-time strategy game created by The Logic Factory. Released in 1997, it was the company's second release after Ascendancy, a space strategy game.\nGameplay\nThe Tone Rebellion is a game in which players command a race of jellyfish-like beings called Floaters in a cosmic struggle against the malevolent Leviathan. The game unfolds across horizontal \"islands\" suspended in space, where players manage resources known as \"Tone\"—the essence of life used for building structures, training units, healing, and casting spells. Strategic expansion occurs through building on Tone Nodes and deploying \"Spreaders\" to unlock more territory. Rather than progressing through disconnected missions, the gameplay centers on preparing for the climactic showdown with Leviathan. Players contend with hostile forces, rival Floater races, and frequent incursions from enemy Spawners that swiftly disrupt resource pools. Adventure-style puzzles are featured, such as collecting artifacts and unlocking bridges to new islands. Units—fighters, workers, and magic-users—are trained in specialized buildings. Diplomacy allows minor alliances or skirmishes with other races..\nDevelopment\nThe Tone Rebellion was announced in March 1997. It was developed in 18 months. In August 1997, shortly before the game's release, The Logic Factory announced they had split with Broderbund and would publish The Tone Rebellion under Virgin Interactive.\nReception\n|rev2=PC Gamer\n|rev2Score=35%\n}}\nPC Gamer said \"Maybe if Logic Factory had spent less time on metaphysical trappings and more on gameplay, this would have been an interesting game\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n* (archived)\n*"
