It should not be confused with the Syriac Orthodox Anaphora of the Twelve Apostles, which is similar, and may be one of several liturgies derived from this Anaphora, yet is considerably longer and more ornate.\nIt was used extensively by Gregory Dix in his research for his book The Shape of the Liturgy published in 1945 and subsequently by theologians such as Dr. Charles (Ted) Hackett and Dr. Don Saliers among others in preparing reforms for the Book of Common Prayer and the United Methodist Liturgies found in the current United Methodist Hymnal. This anaphora is also the inspiration for the Roman Rite's Eucharistic Prayer II in the Mass of Paul VI.\nDate and origin\nThe dating of this anaphora is strictly related to the attribution of the Apostolic Tradition which includes it. In 1906 Eduard von der Goltz was the first to suggest that the anonymous manuscript discovered in the 19th century was the Apostolic Tradition historically attributed to Hippolytus of Rome, thus dating the anaphora to the mid 3rd century AD and using it in reconstructing the early worship in Rome. This understanding was subsequently accepted by the great majority of scholars of the 20th century, including Gregory Dix, and played a crucial role in the liturgical reforms of main mainstream Christian bodies.\nSome scholarship questions the attribution to Hippolytus and the Apostolic Tradition is viewed as a composite work modified over the centuries. According to this view, the anaphora probably attained its final form around the middle of the 4th century and is not related to Rome but to West Syria or even to Egypt. Some scholars also suggest that the Apostolic Tradition portrays a liturgy that was never celebrated.  However, in Eastern Orthodox ecclesiology, the attribution to Hippolytus remains generally accepted.\nContents of the Anaphora\nThis anaphora is minimal compared with the longer and more ornate forms of the Roman Canon, and the Anaphorae of the Divine Liturgy of St. Basil the Great, and the Liturgy of St. James the Just; it is widely believed that these ancient liturgies are themselves either derived from, or closely related to, this liturgy.  This liturgy, in its brevity, lacks a Sanctus or Trisagion; additionally, the Epiclesis does not unequivocally affirm a real change of the Eucharistic gifts of bread and wine into the body and blood of Jesus Christ.  Finally, the text of the Anaphora assumes it is to be said by a bishop; in the Early Church each congregation was presided over by a bishop, whose duties included the normal celebration of the Eucharist; later, this function in most parishes was delegated to presbyters and special rubrics developed for services celebrated by a bishop, which came to be known in the East as Hierarchical Divine Liturgies, and in the Roman church, as the Pontifical High Mass.  In modern liturgies based on this anaphora, such as Eucharistic Prayer II of the Roman Rite Mass, either a priest or a bishop might preside.\nSursum Corda\nThe Bishop begins:\nThe Lord be with you.\nAnd all reply:\nAnd with thy spirit.\nThe Bishop continues:\nLift up your hearts.\nCongregation:\nWe lift them up unto the Lord.\nBishop:\nLet us give thanks to the Lord.\nCongregation:\nIt is right and just.\nThanksgiving\nThe Bishop continues:\nWe give thanks to you God,\nthrough your beloved son Jesus Christ,\nwhom you sent to us in former times\nas Savior, Redeemer, and Messenger of your Will,\nwho is your inseparable Word,\nthrough whom you made all,\nand in whom you were well-pleased,\nwhom you sent from heaven into the womb of a virgin,\nwho, being conceived within her, was made flesh,\nand appeared as your Son,\nborn of the Holy Spirit and the virgin.\nIt is he who, fulfilling your will\nand acquiring for you a holy people,\nextended his hands in suffering,\nin order to liberate from sufferings\nthose who believe in you.\nWords of Institution\nWho, when he was delivered to voluntary suffering,\nin order to dissolve death,\nand break the chains of the devil,\nand tread down hell,\nand bring the just to the light,\nand set the limit,\nand manifest the resurrection,\ntaking the bread, and giving thanks to you, said,\n\"Take, eat, for this is my body which is broken for you.\"\nLikewise the chalice, saying,\nThis is my blood which is shed for you.\nWhenever you do this, do this [in] memory of me.\nAnamnesis and Oblation\nTherefore, remembering his death and resurrection,\nwe offer to you the bread and the chalice,\ngiving thanks to you, who has made us worthy\nto stand before you and to serve as your priests.\nEpiclesis\nAnd we pray that you would send your Holy Spirit\nto the oblation of your Holy Church.\nIn their gathering together,\ngive to all those who partake of your holy mysteries the fullness of the Holy Spirit,\ntoward the strengthening of the faith in truth,\nDoxology\nthat we may praise you and glorify you,\nthrough your son Jesus Christ,\nthrough whom to you be glory and honor,\nFather and Son,\nwith the Holy Spirit,\nin your Holy Church,\nnow and always, [Amen].\nReferences\n*Dom Gregory Dix, The Shape of the Liturgy, 1945.\n*Lucien Deiss, Springtime of the Liturgy, 1979\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070702184415/http://www.stjosephplacentia.org/RCath-L/history2.htm Anaphora of Hippolytus], Latin text."
