The team has previously competed in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, the NTT IndyCar Series, and Asian Le Mans.\nHistory\nThe organizational roots of RWR date back to Ware & Sons Racing with Rick and his father John Ware competing in the SCCA Series. They raced under the banner \"Ware & Sons\" as early as the 1960s when Rick went go-kart racing. Once of legal driving age, Rick joined his father John Ware in the SCCA and IMSA Series.\nIn 1983, Ware & Sons won Rookie of the Year in the California Sports Car Club with Rick behind the wheel. Ware & Sons with Rick as the driver went on to win several titles in that series, as well as the SCCA and IMSA Championship.\nAfter a stint as a driver in the NASCAR Cup Series, Ware renamed the organization Ware Racing Enterprises in the 1990s and eventually Rick Ware Racing in 2004.\nThe team's shop was previously located in Thomasville, North Carolina. In 2020, they moved to Mooresville, North Carolina during the two months (March to May) that the series could not race due to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The move coincided with RWR buying Premium Motorsports, which added their No. 15 car as a fourth full-time car in their stable, causing the team to need more space. Before the 2023 season, RWR moved from Mooresville to a shop in Concord, North Carolina on the campus of RFK Racing, which the team began an alliance with in 2023. On April 9, RWR appointed Tommy Baldwin Jr. as competition director.\nNASCAR\nNASCAR Cup Series\nEarly years (1998–2012)\nIn 1998, Rick Ware attempted to qualify a Ware Racing Enterprises Ford in the Winston Cup event at Sonoma Raceway but failed to make the race.\nRick Ware Racing (RWR) had made a handful of attempts in the NASCAR Cup Series beginning in 2004 with Stanton Barrett in the No. 52. In 2005, the organization made attempts with Larry Gunselman, José Luis Ramírez and Derrike Cope. In 2006, Larry Gunselman, Steve Portenga, and Stanton Barrett in the No. 52 and No. 30 respectively.\nIn 2007, Barrett attempted to make the Daytona 500 only to miss the race by a single position.\nIn 2011, Rick Ware Racing allied with the No. 37 Front Row Motorsports/Max Q Motorsports Team. American Le Mans Series driver Tomy Drissi qualified for the Sonoma Cup Race race, but NASCAR would not approve him for competition; Chris Cook drove the 37 to a 27th-place finish.\nFor 2012, Rick Ware Racing again allied with Max Q Motorsports to run Timmy Hill for the majority of the season in the No. 37 to vie for Rookie of the Year honors. After Mike Wallace failed to make Daytona, Hill DNQ'd the next race, but qualified in Vegas; he finished 42nd after a crash. When the team missed five races in six attempts, they were outside the top 35 and Ware moved Hill back to Nationwide, ending the partnership.\nFull-time (2017–present)\nIn 2017, Rick Ware Racing came back to the Cup Series with the No. 51 Chevrolet for most of the schedule.\nIn 2018, Rick Ware Racing ran with all three manufacturers and the team also secured a charter for the No. 51 car.  Later in the season, the team fielded a part-time No. 52 car.\nFor the 2019 season, Rick Ware Racing dropped Toyota to focus on running Chevrolets and Fords. The No. 51 team was registered as Petty Ware Racing after RWR leased the charter from Richard Petty Motorsports. In addition, RWR secured a full-time schedule for the No. 52 team after purchasing a charter from Front Row Motorsports, who had leased it to the now-defunct TriStar Motorsports. Starting with the 2019 Coca-Cola 600, RWR fielded a third team, the No. 53, on a part-time basis.  Starting with the 2019 Bass Pro Shops NRA Night Race, RWR fielded a fourth team, the No. 54, on a part-time basis.  On November 27, 2019, NASCAR imposed penalties to Rick Ware Racing, Premium Motorsports, and Spire Motorsports for manipulating their finishing order at Homestead. Each team was docked 50 owners' points and fined 50,000. In addition, competition directors Kenneth Evans of Rick Ware Racing and Scott Eggleston of Premium Motorsports were suspended indefinitely and fined 25,000 each.\nFor the 2020 season, RWR took a lease of the former charter of Front Row Motorsports' No. 36 team, allowing the No. 53 to run a full-time schedule. On May 13, 2020, Fox Sports' Bob Pockrass confirmed that Rick Ware Racing had purchased Premium Motorsports and their charter for the No. 15 car from former owner Jay Robinson. Rick Ware Racing continued to run the No. 15 full-time for Brennan Poole under the Premium Motorsports name in 2020.\nOn October 10, 2021, it was reported that RWR was going into an alliance with Stewart–Haas Racing and Roush Yates Engines beginning in 2022 as they would focus on running Fords.  However beginning in 2023, RWR would switch their alliance to be with RFK Racing.\nLawsuit against Legacy Motor Club\nOn April 1, 2025, Legacy Motor Club sued RWR over the sale of a charter. On March 3, both teams signed a deal for RWR to sell a charter to LMC, but RWR has allegedly backed out on the deal. RWR claims the agreement would go in effect in 2027, but LMC changed the terms to 2026 without any communication with RWR.\nOn April 9, LMC obtained a temporary restraining order preventing RWR from selling, leasing, or otherwise encumbering the charter in question for at least ten days or until agreement by LMC and RWR. However, a North Carolina judge denied LMC the injunction. It was revealed that the lawsuit resulted from a confusion over which of RWR's two charters was in the transaction. The agreement stated Charter 36 (currently used by the No. 51 car) was to be sold for 45 million; LMC's attorney argued that the contract listed Charter 27 (which was leased to RFK Racing for the No. 60 car in 2025). RWR's attorney claimed that two weeks after the agreement was signed, LMC offered to pay RWR an additional 5 million for Charter 27 for 2026. RFK has an agreement to lease Charter 36 in 2026, as teams are allowed to lease charters once every seven years.\nOn June 18, RWR filed a countersuit against LMC, citing LMC made a false claim of purchasing the charter for 2026.\nOn July 14, The courts granted LMC permission to depose RWR following the recent revelation that T.J. Puchyr intends to purchase the race team. On July 16, LMC filed a lawsuit against TJ Puchyr for tortious interference, alleging that he attempted to purchase RWR and violated the state’s Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act by using insider knowledge and a position of trust to interfere with Legacy’s agreement with RWR.\nOn September 19, 2025, it was announced that LMC and RWR ended their lawsuit under a settlement, with RWR selling the charter to LMC; the rest of their settlement agreement is still unknown.\nPossible sale of NASCAR team\nOn June 26, 2025, it was announced that T. J. Puchyr, who co-founded Spire Motorsports in 2016, entered an agreement to purchase RWR's NASCAR team. The deal will retain Rick Ware as a partner and Cody Ware as the driver of the No. 51 car, as well as all of the current RWR employees. On July 31, a judge granted LMC a temporary restraining order against RWR, preventing RWR from closing the team's sale to Puchyr for ten days.\nCar No. 01 history\nOn January 27, 2025, it was announced that Corey LaJoie would run a part-time schedule with Rick Ware Racing, driving the No. 01.\nCar No. 01 results\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:75%\"\n|-\n!

However, the 15 still ran under the Premium Motorsports banner. Poole ran all but one race (the Bristol Night Race, where he was replaced by J. J. Yeley) for the rest of the season. Following 2020, Poole left the team.\nIn 2021, the team would officially be run under the RWR banner. The team announced that 1990 Daytona 500 winner Derrike Cope would make his final career start in the Daytona 500 in the car. The car was also fielded in a collaboration with Cope's team, StarCom Racing. However, after qualifying, Cope was penalized for electrical issues and failing numerous inspections and his qualifying time was disallowed. Also during the duels, Cope had issues with the car, placing seventeenth in his duel race, only completing 59 laps out the 63. Cope started 32nd in the race and only ran three laps before crashing on lap four, ending his day. After the 500, the team used multiple drivers for the 15 team through the rest of the season. James Davison made the most starts for the team with seventeen starts, and gave the team's best finish with a 22nd-place finish in the Blue-Emu Maximum Pain Relief 500 at Martinsville. Dirt racer Chris Windom made his NASCAR Cup Series debut with the team at Bristol Dirt Race, driving the car. However, an engine failure caused Windom to drop out of the race and place the car 33rd. Later in April, Jennifer Jo Cobb was set to make her NASCAR Cup debut at the GEICO 500 at Talladega; however, NASCAR announced on April 19 that she would not be approved to run the race. This was likely due to how the race itself would have been her first time in a Cup car because of the lack of practice and qualifying. Joey Gase would drive the car at Las Vegas, Kansas, Nashville, and Daytona. At the fall Las Vegas race, Gase was involved in a scary crash when the car lost a tire and slammed the wall, sending the car airborne. Gase was transported to the hospital and released a few hours later. At the Go Bowling at The Glen, R. C. Enerson would make his NASCAR Cup debut for the team at the race. Enerson would drive the 15 to a 34th-place finish. Bayley Currey drove at Atlanta in July. Ryan Ellis drove at Kansas in October. He received the ride to make amends with the Ware family following a late wreck with Cody Ware during the Xfinity Race at Mid-Ohio. Josh Bilicki would drive the 15 at the Roval event while Joey Hand drove Bilicki's usual No. 52. Garrett Smithley would then finish out the year in the car. The team placed 35th in the owners points.\nThe No. 15 started the 2022 season with David Ragan, scoring an eighth-place finish at the 2022 Daytona 500, the team's highest finish since its acquisition from Premium Motorsports. The car was shared with Smithley, Hand, Yeley, Ryan Preece, and Parker Kligerman. At Michigan, Yeley triggered a massive pileup on lap 25 that took Austin Cindric and Kyle Busch out of contention.\nThe No. 15 started the 2023 season with Riley Herbst finishing 10th in the Daytona 500. The car was shared with J.J. Yeley, Todd Gilliland, Jenson Button, Brennan Poole, Gray Gaulding, Andy Lally, and Ryan Newman. At COTA, Button finished 18th in his NASCAR debut.\nIn 2024, Kaz Grala drove in 25 races starting at Atlanta. Cody Ware drove the No. 15 in nine races. Riley Herbst drove at the 2024 Daytona 500, as well as several other races. Following the end of the season, RWR leased out the No. 15's charter to RFK Racing for the No. 60 in 2025.\nOn December 17, 2024, it was announced that Tim Brown will run the No. 15 at the Clash at Bowman Gray Stadium in 2025. Brown had previously worked with the team as a suspension and drivetrain specialist.\nCar No. 15 results\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:75%\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Driver\n!

American Le Mans Series driver Tomy Drissi qualified for the Sonoma Cup Race race, but NASCAR would not approve him for competition; Chris Cook drove the 37 to a 27th-place finish.\nFor 2012, Rick Ware Racing again allied with Max Q Motorsports to run Timmy Hill for the majority of the season in the No. 37 for Rookie of the Year honors. After Mike Wallace failed to make Daytona, Hill DNQ'd the next race, but qualified in Vegas; he finished 42nd after a crash. When the team missed five races in six attempts, they were outside the top 35 and Ware moved Hill back to Nationwide, ending the partnership.\nCar No. 37 results\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:75%\"\n|-\n!

However things did not go according to the plan: Timmy Hill attempted the Daytona 500, but missed the field, the team then had Cody Ware make his debut at the next race in the Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 at Atlanta, driving the No. 51 with sponsorship from Spoonful of Music and Bubba Burger. Ware qualified for the race as he started and finished 39th, retiring from the race on lap 74 with steering problems.  Hill drove the car in the next seven races until RWR withdrew the 51 at Talladega. the 51 and Hill returned for the next two races at Kansas Speedway, and the Coke 600. Cody Ware returned and did both the Dover and Pocono, Ware's No. 51 acquired sponsorship from East Carolina University and Clemson University, respectively, with the latter also featuring logos celebrating the football team's 2017 College Football Playoff National Championship win earlier in the year. During the Dover race, Ware withdrew from the event after 283 of 406 laps after suffering from back pain. A week later at Pocono, he left the race after completing 35 laps, again for back problems. Ware was going to race at Michigan but he decided to stay out of the car for the race and the team did not find a replacement driver in time, forcing them to miss their third race of the year.\nJosh Bilicki joined the team for the race at Sonoma and New Hampshire, while Kyle Weatherman, B. J. McLeod and Ray Black Jr. joined the team for races in the mid-to-late portions of the season. By the end of the year, the team only participated in 29 of the 36 races that season.\nOn November 22, 2017, it was announced that Black would return to the 51 for a full 2018 season with a charter. The team did not disclose how they had acquired the charter. However, the deal with Black soon fell apart, leaving the 51 open for another driver. Justin Marks drove the No. 51 at the Daytona 500, finishing twelfth. The car was fielded in partnership with Premium Motorsports, powered by ECR Engines, and was sponsored by Harry's. Harrison Rhodes joined the team for a one-off the following week at Atlanta to make his Cup debut. A partnership with Stewart–Haas Racing brought Cole Custer to the car the following week at the spring Las Vegas race for his Cup debut. Timmy Hill was brought in for the next two races, finishing 33rd at both the spring Phoenix race and Fontana. Rhodes returned to the car for the next four races. Timmy Hill drove the car at the spring Talladega race. Cody Ware made his first start of the season at the spring Dover race. McLeod drove the car at the spring Kansas race and the 2018 Coca-Cola 600. Custer returned to the No. 51 at the Pocono 400 Chris Cook drove the No. 51 at Sonoma. Jeb Burton drove the No. 51 at the fall Martinsville race.\nFor the 2019 season, The No. 51 team was registered as Petty Ware Racing after RWR leased the charter from Richard Petty Motorsports. At the 2019 Daytona 500, both RWR cars triggered an unusual crash on lap 159. As several cars were entering pit road, Cody Ware and McLeod collided, sending McLeod to the infield grass and Ware slamming into Tyler Reddick, who inflicted serious damage on Jimmie Johnson's left rear quarter panel. Ware then hit Ricky Stenhouse Jr. from behind before resting on the infield grass, causing Stenhouse to collide with Reddick. McLeod, who drove the 51, finished the race 19th.  Andy Seuss joined the team for his Cup debut at New Hampshire Motor Speedway in July.\nFor the 2020 season, Joey Gase became the primary driver while Garrett Smithley drove the car at three races, James Davison doing four races, and Bilicki returned for the Charlotte Roval. The team finished the season 38th in the points standings.\nFor the 2021 season, Cody Ware returned as the primary driver for the No. 51 Nurtec ODT Chevrolet. Smithley returned for two races while J. J. Yeley ran two races and Davison returned for Watkins Glen. The No. 51 finished the season 34th in points. On December 1, RWR lost its lease to the No. 51's charter after GMS Racing purchased a majority stake in Richard Petty Motorsports. The charter was transferred to Petty GMS Motorsports' No. 42 car.\nCody Ware returned to the No. 51 for the 2022 season, using the former No. 52's charter. He scored a career-best 17th-place finish at the 2022 Daytona 500. At Sonoma, the No. 51 failed pre-race inspection four times and was hit with an L1 penalty, resulting in a start at the back of the field and a pass-through penalty on the first lap. In addition, the team was deducted 20 owner and driver points. On August 23, crew chief Billy Plourde was suspended for four races after the No. 51 lost a ballast during the Watkins Glen race. At Texas, Ware survived a hard crash, colliding with the turn 4 wall before violently hitting the pit wall. He sustained an impaction fracture on his ankle from the crash. Ware missed the Charlotte Roval race due to his injury, with J. J. Yeley substituting him in the No. 51.\nWare started the 2023 season with a fourteenth place finish at the 2023 Daytona 500. On April 10, Ware was indefinitely suspended by NASCAR after being arrested and charged with a felony assault by strangulation as well as a misdemeanor assault on a woman in Iredell County, North Carolina. Matt Crafton replaced Ware for the Bristol Dirt Race (at the time of the change, Ware's arrest had not yet been revealed), with the team using variety of drivers following the race, beginning from Zane Smith for Martinsville, Yeley for Talladega, Todd Gilliland for Charlotte and Sonoma, Ryan Newman for the All-Star Race and the championship race, Andy Lally for the Chicago street race, and Cole Custer for Atlanta, New Hampshire, and Pocono. Despite the team finishing in the bottom three among the 36 chartered teams on the owner standings for the past three consecutive years, NASCAR decided not to repossess the No. 51's charter at the end of the season.\nIn 2024, Justin Haley drove the No. 51 full-time in a multi-year deal. At the Circuit of the Americas, he finished seventeenth, but was later disqualified after post-race inspection revealed his car did not meet the minimum weight requirement. During the season, Haley scored two ninth-place finishes at Darlington and Gateway. On September 20, RWR and Spire Motorsports made a driver swap for the remainder of the 2024 season, with Haley moving to the Spire No. 7 and Corey LaJoie taking over the No. 51.\nin the No. 51 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway in 2025]]\nCody Ware returned to the No. 51 car full-time in 2025. After finishing 25th at the 2025 Daytona 500, the No. 51 team was docked ten driver and owner points for improperly securing the car's ballasts. On February 20, Arby's signed a deal to sponsor the No. 51 car for twelve races. Harrison Burton drove the No. 51 car at the 2025 NASCAR All-Star Race, as his win with Wood Brothers Racing at the 2024 Daytona summer race qualified him for the exhibition race. Burton finished 20th out of 23 participants.\nCar No. 51 results\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:75%\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Driver\n! No.\n!

The No. 52 car was set to make its debut at the Coca-Cola 600 with B. J. McLeod behind the wheel as Cody Ware was to drive the 51; however, the entry was withdrawn and McLeod was moved to the No. 51 car. The No. 52 instead made its debut with Cody Ware at Sonoma. J. J. Yeley, Gray Gaulding and Harrison Rhodes also drove the 52. At season's end, the No. 52 did a total of six starts in the season with five different drivers, with its best finish being 30th at Indianapolis.\nIn 2019, RWR secured a full-time schedule for the No. 52 team after purchasing a charter from Front Row Motorsports, who had leased it to the now-defunct TriStar Motorsports. At the 2019 Daytona 500, both RWR cars triggered an unusual crash on lap 159. As several cars were entering pit road, Cody Ware and McLeod collided, sending McLeod to the infield grass and Ware slamming into Tyler Reddick, who inflicted serious damage on Jimmie Johnson's left rear quarter panel. Ware then hit Ricky Stenhouse Jr. from behind before resting on the infield grass, causing Stenhouse to collide with Reddick. Ware, who drove the 52, finished 39th. Prior to the Atlanta race, car chief Mike Chance was ejected from the track after the No. 52 failed pre-qualifying inspection multiple times. During the race, McLeod was involved in his second consecutive pit road incident when he pulled towards his pit stall and Ryan Preece slammed into the back of his car. McLeod's car then slammed into Chris Buescher's pit box and hit fueler Anthony Pasut, who suffered a broken fibula, a torn ACL, and other injuries to his right leg. The collision put Preece's car out of commission with a 35th-place finish while McLeod and Ware finished 32nd and 33rd, respectively. In March, Bayley Currey made his Cup debut in the No. 52 at Phoenix. On August 15, 2019, Currey was indefinitely suspended for violating NASCAR's Substance Abuse Policy. On September 18, Currey was reinstated by NASCAR after he successfully completed his Road to Recovery Program. Prior to the Talladega race, the No. 52's hauler caught fire at the garage due to an electrical short. The No. 52 finished 38th in the points standings.\nIn 2020, the No. 52 ran the first four races of the season with McLeod doing the 500 and Yeley running the following three races. However, after the organization purchased Premium Motorsports, the No. 52 switched the number to Premium's No. 27, owing to sponsorship considerations. Yeley did the most starts in the 27 in 2020 with 24 starts; his best finish was 21st at Indianapolis. Gaulding did nine starts with his best finish being 25th at Texas) while Josh Bilicki and Cody Ware did the remaining two starts. Bilicki drove the 27 at Atlanta where he finished 34th. Cody Ware participated at the Talladega fall race. Towards the end of the race, due to a lot of front runners being involved in crashes, Ware was racing in the top ten until he crashed on the backstretch on the final lap, but was able to finish nineteenth for his first Cup Series top-twenty. The No. 52 finished 33rd in the points standings.\nIn 2021, the 27 would revert into the 52 with Bilicki as the full-time driver. At the Daytona night race, Bilicki scored both his and the 52's first top-ten by finishing tenth in the race. That same year, Joey Hand made his debut at the Charlotte Roval. Just like the previous season, the No. 52 finished 33rd in the points standings. At the end the 2021 season, the charter for the No. 52 was moved to the No. 51 car and the team was shut down.\nCar No. 52 results\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:75%\"\n|-\n!

The No. 53 made its debut at the 2019 Coca-Cola 600 with B. J. McLeod. Other drivers such as Josh Bilicki, Joey Gase, Spencer Boyd, and J. J. Yeley also drove the car. The No. 53 finished the season 39th in the points standings.\nIn 2020, RWR took lease of the former charter of Front Row Motorsports' No. 36 team, allowing the No. 53 to run a full-time schedule. The No. 53 car was renumbered to the No. 36 for the 2020 Daytona 500 with David Ragan as the driver. Front Row Motorsports prepared the car. The No. 53 finished the season 36th in points.\nIn 2021, The 53 car was returned to full-time competition with Garrett Smithley as the primary driver. However, during the spring Talladega weekend, The No. 53 was switched to No. 28 and ran as a tribute to Davey Allison with Gase as the driver. Just like the previous season, the No. 53 finished the season 36th in the points standings. At the end of the season, the No. 53 team was shut down and its charter was sold to Spire Motorsports for the No. 7 driven by Corey LaJoie.\nCar No. 53 results\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:75%\"\n|-\n!

The team planned to compete at the Bristol night race, with J. J. Yeley behind the wheel. The team originally received sponsorship from the thrash metal band Slayer to promote the band's final tour. However, some controversial incidents around metal bands caused Slayer to pull their sponsorship. RWR replaced the sponsor with PODS for the race. Yeley drove the car to a 28th-place finish. Garrett Smithley then raced a Lennie Pond throwback-paint-job at Darlington and finished 35th. Yeley returned to the team at Indianapolis and finished 26th, the No. 54's best finish. Smithley returned at Dover and finished 33rd.\nIn 2020, Yeley attempted the Daytona 500 in the car, but missed the field.

Stanton Barrett, Stan Boyd, Kim Crosby, Bobby Dotter, David Eshleman, Kenny Hendrick, Travis Powell, Morgan Shepherd, Shane Sieg, Dana White and J. J. Yeley all took turns at the wheel for RWR in their inaugural debut in the series under the No. 51 and No. 57 banner.\nThe organization took a five-year hiatus from the series to focus on the Motocross, Supercross, Arenacross, and Women's Motocross series' only to make a return in 2009.\nWith a new attitude, the organization returned under the Chevrolet banner and numbers 31 and 41.  RWR purchased equipment from Stanton Barrett Motorsports to start the season and quickly moved to ECR engines after power issues hindered the team.\nDrivers Stanton Barrett, Derrike Cope, Tim Andrews, Travis Kittleson, Kerry Earnhardt, Tom Hubert, Kevin Hamlin, Daryl Harr and Justin Hobgood all split the time between the two cars. RWR later signed developmental driver Jeffrey Earnhardt, the grandson of Dale Earnhardt.  Jeffrey Earnhardt's series debut at Dover was cut short with a late crash in practice and a subsequent DNQ.\n2009 was a significant year for RW. At Lowes Motor Speedway, Stanton Barrett qualified the No. 31 in the 11th position. Kerry Earnhardt finished 12th at Talladega Speedway and also qualified 8th at Daytona International Speedway, both organizational benchmarks. Tim Andrews went into the history books as he was led by crew chief and father Paul Andrews, marking the first time in NASCAR history that a father was a crew chief for a son in the Nationwide Series.\nIn 2010, RWR ran in select races as it focused on the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series. At Daytona, RWR went into the record books again, this time with driver Chrissy Wallace.  Wallace became the first female driver to make her series debut at Daytona in the No. 41 Chevrolet. Danica Patrick also accomplished the feat in the same event.  Stanton Barrett competed in the No. 31 Fuel Doctor Chevy at Daytona.\nBarrett rallied to a fourteenth-place finish at Darlington Raceway while leading laps for the first time in RWR history. Barrett competed in five races for RWR in 2010 in both the 31 and 41 Chevrolet. J.C. Stout also made a race for Ware Racing at ORP.\n]]\nFor 2011, RWR returned to the Nationwide Series, running the No. 15 car with Ford's purchased from Roush Fenway Racing. Ware ran ARCA development driver Timmy Hill for Rookie of the Year honors. Hill won Rookie of the Year but was forced to miss the season opener at Daytona because Hill didn't turn 18 (NASCAR's minimum age to drive in the three national series) until February 25. Germain Racing ran the No. 15 Toyota in Hill's place with Todd Bodine at Daytona before selling the points to RWR. RWR also ran the No. 41 Ford with drivers Patrick Sheltra, Carl Long, Jennifer Jo Cobb and Doug Harrington. RWR also formed a partnership with Fleur-de-lis Motorsports, fielding the No. 68 for Tim Andrews, Carl Long and Matt Carter. Clay Greenfield made his NASCAR Nationwide Series debut for the team in their No. 71 car in Atlanta Motor Speedway but was pinched up into the wall just under 100 laps into the race and finished 35th after starting in the 43rd position. Hill would eventually win Rookie of the Year over primary rivals Blake Koch and Ryan Truex.\nIn 2012, Koch joined RWR full-time as Hill moved up to RWR's Sprint Cup program. Hill ran the season-opening race at Daytona before the No. 15 was moved to a limited schedule with Jeffrey Earnhardt driving at Bristol with Sam's Club. Koch's original sponsor dropped their agreement due to ESPN not showing the sponsor's ad due to Koch being an outspoken Christian. Hill returned to Nationwide after a failed Rookie of the Year run in Cup, and drove the 41 while Koch drove the 15 as an occasional start and park. Riggs started and parked for Ware in the 75.\nIn 2013, the team returned with the No. 15 Ford Mustang driven by Juan Carlos Blum and Harrison Rhodes. The team also fielded cars for Carl Long. For 2014, RWR drove primarily with Carlos Contreras, Hill, and Josh Reaume.\nIn 2015, the team reunited with Contreras and Hill, but also ran with B. J. McLeod and Jimmy Weller III. For 2016, the team celebrated its 25th anniversary, The team partnered with B. J. McLeod Motorsports to share the No. 15, while RWR runs the 25. The team shut down the Xfinity program after the 2016 season to focus on the Truck Series.\nIn 2017, despite this announcement, the team returned at Road America in a partnership with Mike Harmon Racing. John Graham drove the No. 74 (usually Harmon's number) for RWR because the car was locked in the race and Harmon's driver: Nicolas Hammann drove the No. 17 (usually RWR's number) and would have to qualify on time but since other cars withdrew both cars make the race. Cody Ware also drove for Harmon in a collaborative effort between RWR and MHR and he continues to drive the No. 74 car part-time for 2018.\nIn 2019, the team announced a full-time car numbered 17. Chris Cockrum drove at Daytona and Talladega. Bayley Currey ran most of the races. Kyle Weatherman ran at Bristol and other races. Starting sometime around the Charlotte race in May, RWR partnered with Mike Harmon Racing (again) to field the No. 17 car together for the remainder of the season. The font that Harmon uses on his No. 74 car is now used on the No. 17 as well. Camden Murphy drove at Charlotte and Pocono. The team withdrew at Iowa and was not entered at Daytona. The team sold their owner points before Iowa to the new No. 28 H2 Motorsports car driven by Shane Lee, which indicated that the team may only run part-time for the rest of the year. Josh Bilicki drove at Chicagoland after Currey qualified the car while Bilicki failed to qualify his own No. 38 car for RSS Racing. Both Murphy and Currey would return for Kentucky and New Hampshire, respectfully. Part-time ARCA Menards Series driver Mark Meunier attempted to make his Xfinity debut at Iowa in July but failed to qualify. The No. 17 would also skip both road course races at Watkins Glen and Mid-Ohio.\nIn May 2020, Ware formed a partnership with SS-Green Light Racing to field his drivers in the latter's No. 07 car; Ware is close friends with SS-Green Light owner Bobby Dotter. The collaboration spawned after the No. 07's regular driver Ray Black Jr. was forced to exit full-time racing to focus on his family business. Garrett Smithley took over the car for the partnership's first race at Charlotte.\nIn 2021, Ware's partnership with Dotter continued by Ware using Dotter's No. 08 owner points to field the No. 17 car. At the Alsco Uniforms 302, RWR fielded the No. 52 Toyota for Carson Ware using Jimmy Means Racing's owner points.\nCar No. 15 results\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:75%\"\n|-\n!

In 1999, RWR made two starts, one with Randy MacDonald and the other with driver-owner Rick Ware in trucks 51 and 81.\nIn 2000, the organization was set to run the entire season with two teams, the 51 and 81 when Rick Ware was injured in a head-on crash at California Speedway that resulted in a career-ending fractured vertebra to the neck.  Ware moved into the ownership role to continue the team. Drivers Tom Boston, David Starr, Michael Dokken and Donnie Neuenberger finished out the twenty race schedule. Dokken produced an eighth place finish at Loudon and led at Nazareth. Rick Ware finished a career-high of thirteenth at Texas.\nFor 2001, Brian Rose ran 15 races before heading off to Bobby Hamilton Racing. Nathan Buttke, Travis Clark, Dokken, Coy Gibbs, Donnie Neuenberger, Trent Owens, Jonathon Price, Sammy Ragan, Michael Ritch, Jerry Robertson, Brian Sockwell, Jason Thom and Rich Woodland Jr. completed the roster that watched Rick Ware Racing expand to a three and an occasional four race team with numbers 51, 71, 81, 91.\nDokken had a season-high of 11th at Nazareth, Rose finished twelfth at Fontana and many others finished in the top-twenty with laps being led by Dokken and Ritch for the season.\nIn 2002, Rick Ware Racing switched to Dodge and fielded the 5, 51 and 81 entries for several drivers. Lance Hooper ran the most races for the team with a total of twelve events. Randy Briggs, Mike Cofer, Michael Dokken, Jason Hedlesky, Ryan Hemphill, Scott Kirkpatrick, Scott Kuhn, Carl Long, Blake Mallory, Donny Morelock, Donnie Neuenberger, Jonathon Price, Michael Ritch, Brian Rose, Morgan Shepherd, Jason Thom, Andy Thurman, Jason White and Angie Wilson all competed for the team. Most drivers finished in the top 15 with Hooper leading a lap at Darlington.\nDuring the 2003 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series season, Rick Ware Racing decided to focus on one driver for a full season. Jerry Hill was slated for the task. Hill competed in 22 of the 25 events and finished 18th in the drivers' standings in the No. 5 Dodge. Ware also raced the number 51 and 81 with a number of drivers such as Rusty Alton, Stan Boyd, Randy Briggs, Doug Keller, Carl Long, Blake Mallory, G. J. Mennen Jr., Chase Montgomery and Brian Sockwell.\nAfter taking a leave from the series, Ware returned to the newly named NASCAR Camping World Truck Series for just two races in 2009 while competing in the Nationwide Series full-time. Chrissy Wallace in the No. 08 for Ware competed against her father, Mike Wallace, as it marked the first time a father and daughter raced in the same event in any of the top three NASCAR Series'. Chrissy finished in front of her father in the thirteenth position, marking the second highest finish by a female in NASCAR history.\nTim Brown, coming off his record-breaking 8th Championship at Bowman-Gray Stadium in the NASCAR Whelen Modified Series raced the truck at Martinsville as a celebration of their title earlier that month. RWR returned to the Truck Series with two full-time teams and an occasional third, using the 6, 47, and 16. Brett Butler competed in fifteen races for Rookie of the Year. Neuenberger finished 9th at Daytona as Butler finished eleventh. Bobby Hamilton Jr. qualified and finished tenth on two occasions each. Travis Kvapil along with Hamilton Jr. and Butler all led laps during the season. Amber Cope, Jeffrey Earnhardt, Ken Butler III, J. C. Stout, Brian Rose, Mike Guerity, C. E. Falk, Ryan Rust, Carl Long, Derek White, Lance Fenton, Clay Greenfield, Justin Hobgood and D. J. Kennington all drove the No. 6 for 2010 in mostly 1–2 race deals.\nJeffrey Earnhardt, the fourth generation driver of the Earnhardt family, made his series debut at Gateway. Amber Cope and Angela Cope, the twin daughters of Daytona 500 winner Derrike Cope, made their respective debuts at Martinsville Speedway, as the two became the first twins to compete against each other.\nFor 2011, Jeffrey Earnhardt was to run for the Rookie of the Year title in the No. 1 Fuel Doctor Chevy. However, after only 3 races, the team was hit with the double tragedy of losing two crew members and Fuel Doctor announcing it could no longer sponsor RWR. Earnhardt was released from RWR after Fuel Doctor's announcement, but the two mended fences and raced again at Martinsville. However, Earnhardt was caught up in a crash running seventh with just 25 laps remaining. Bobby Hamilton Jr. raced the truck at Nashville and Carl Long and Dover before the team took a temporary break to focus on the Nationwide Series where Earnhardt would drive select races in the No. 41 car.\nThe Truck team would return in 2013 with multiple drivers. The program was revived in 2017, fielding the No. 12 Chevrolet Silverado for Spencer Boyd, Jordan Anderson, and Cody Ware. The No. 12 team failed to qualify the season opener at Daytona, with Boyd blowing up an engine during qualifying. The truck operation was dissolved after the fifth race of the season.\nWhelen Modified Series\nRick Ware Racing joined the NASCAR Whelen Modified Series in conjunction with Tim Brown Motorsports. Brown and Ware's relationship dates back to the '90s when Ware made his own NASCAR Sprint Cup Series debut with the help of a young mechanic, Tim Brown. Ware promised the youngster that he would help his career once he got going but Brown needed little help.\nIn 2009, Brown and Ware struck a deal to partner together for his attempt at a historic 8th Championship at the famous Bowman-Gray Stadium, the oldest NASCAR sanctioned track, located in nearby Winston-Salem, NC.  Brown won five races en route to the title and the first for Ware in the series in the No. 83 Circle K/Hayes Jewelers entry. The entire season was caught on film for the series, Madhouse featured on The History Channel.\nAs true to their word, Ware promised Brown a NASCAR Camping World Truck Series debut if he won the title. Tim Brown made his Truck Series debut at Martinsville Speedway where he finished 27th in the No. 08.\nPinty's Series\nIn 2021, Rick Ware Racing made their Pinty's Series debut with Andrew Ranger as the full-time driver in the No. 51. Ware also fielded the No. 52 full-time for Alex Guenette.\nThe team earned their first victory in the series on September 12, 2021, at Flamboro Speedway, with Ranger behind the wheel. It was also the RWR's first victory at a NASCAR-sanctioned event.\nSports car racing\nRolex Sports Car Series\nRick Ware Racing returned to its roots of road racing as it did with Ware & Sons in the 1980s for the running of the Grand-Am Rolex 24 Hours of Daytona in 2011.\nRWR competed in the GT3 Cup Division at Daytona International Speedway for the historic Rolex 24 Hours of Daytona and finished eleventh in class and 25th overall with drivers, Brett Sandberg, Scott Monroe, Maurice Hull, Jeffrey Earnhardt and Doug Harrington.\nThe event marked the 10th anniversary of Jeffrey Earnhardt's grandfather, Dale Earnhardt and uncle Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s run in the same event.\nFuel Doctor was the primary of the No. 47 Porsche.\nAsian Le Mans\nIn 2019, RWR began competing in the Asian Le Mans Series, fielding two Ligier JS P2s in the LMPS Am class for Cody Ware and Mark Kvamme. In their first race at Shanghai International Circuit, the team missed qualifying and much of practice as their cars were plagued by shipping delays; to ensure their cars would be up to par, the team formed a partnership with ARC Bratislava. Although the No. 25 was unable to compete in the race, Ware and Kvappe drove the No. 52 to a fourteenth-overall finish and second place in their class. At The Bend Motorsport Park, the team scored the LMP2 Am Trophy class win as they finished fifth overall with Ware and Gustas Grinbergas; at sixteen years of age, Grinbergas became the youngest driver to win an Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO)-sanctioned race.\nIMSA Weathertech SportsCar Championship\nIn August 2019, RWR announced that they will be entering the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship for the 2020 season with an updated Riley Mk. 30 in the PRO/AM LMP2 class.\nIn 2021, RWR formed alliance with Eurasia Motorsport to field the No. 51 Nurtec ODT Ligier for the 24 Hours of Daytona LMP2 class with drivers Cody Ware, Austin Dillon, Sven Müller, and Salih Yoluç.\nIn 2022, RWR fielded the No. 51 Nurtec ODT Acura in the GTD class for Ryan Eversley and Aidan Read.\nIn 2023, RWR terminated the GTD program and moved onto fielding an Oreca 07 in the LMP2 class full time, with Eric Lux, Pietro Fittipaldi, and Devlin DeFrancesco as drivers, with Austin Cindric racing the 24 Hours of Daytona. Juan Pablo Montoya had also been announced to be in the car for the rounds at Laguna Seca, Road America, and Indianapolis Motor Speedway. After a DNF at Watkins Glen caused by wheel hub problem, the team did not enter any more races in the 2023 season, despite their plans to run the full season. The reasons for this are currently unknown to the public, and they have not announced any plans for IMSA in 2024.\nIMSA VP Racing SportsCar Challenge\nIn 2024, RWR fielded the No. 51 in the LMP3 class in the VP Racing SportsCar Challenge and the Roar before the 24 with Cody Ware behind the wheel.\nMotorcycle racing\nAMA Arenacross Series\nRick Ware Racing has always had its heart in two-wheel racing. Rick Ware had raced a few seasons in the AMA Supercross Series in the late '80s at places like the Superdome.  In 2007, Rick Ware partnered with Tuf Honda owner, Dave Antolak and put together one of the most impressive organizations in AMA Arenacross history.\nRWR with Tuf Honda with sponsorship from Bad Boy Power Drinks and Mahindra Tractors won the championship in 2007 with rider Danny Smith.  In 2008, Chad Johnson won the organization's second title in a row, and in 2009, rider Jeff Gibson made it a record three championships consecutively.\nTuf Honda with Dave Antolak has a total of 5 Championships, the most in the series history with three of those titles coming in partnership with Rick Ware Racing\nAMA Supercross Series\nRick Ware Racing dates back in the Supercross to 1986 when the owner first raced in the series. In 2007, Ware focused on putting together a team in his return that would compete with factory teams, yet remain a small independent. Brock Sellards, Tyler Bright, Jeff Dement and Tyson Hadsell completed the team under the Yamaha flagship alongside Bad Boy Power Drinks and Pro30.\nTyler Bright captured a holeshot award at Detroit (1) in the Superlites and Jeff Dement captured a holeshot award at Phoenix.\nIn 2008, Jake Marsack joined the organization and success followed. Marsack finished 4th at San Francisco, just one spot from the podium, and on a muddy evening in Daytona, Jake Marsack raced his way through the mud to a 3rd-place finish on the podium, marking the first time in modern-day history that an independent team finished that high.\nAMA Motocross Series\nRWR completed the three major series in AMA with the addition of the Motocross Series in 2007.  Riders Tyler Bright, Tyson Hadsell and Jake Marsack raced for Ware on Yamaha's with Bad Boy Power Drinks and Pro30 on board.\nThe team came back in 2008 and made several main events but trouble kept them from competing with the bigger budget teams in the series.\nIn 2009, Ware went to a single rider team with Tyler Bright on a Honda with Mahindra Tractors on board in sponsorship.\nWMA Motocross Series\nFew teams have scored as much success in the WMA Motocross Series, a motocross series for female riders, as Rick Ware Racing.

Patterson backed that title up in 2007 with Ware, becoming the most successful female rider in AMA Motocross history. During the two years with RWR, Patterson captured 10 holeshot awards and 13 victories, never failing to make a podium during the two-year stint.\nWare went in a different direction after the 2007 season to focus more on the NASCAR, Motocross, and X-Games Series, after making his mark in the history books in the WMA Series\nSummer X Games\nRick Ware Racing became interested in the crowd and excitement surrounding the X Games since its inception. In 2009, RWR finally took the step into the events with Women's Motocross rider, Sherri Cruse for X-Games 15.\nCruse had captured the bronze medal in 2008 was highly favored in the event. With Circle K and Fastwax on board, Cruse stumbled early in the event and charged from last place to fourth in the shorted race due to a television schedule.\nWare had faith in Cruse and went back to X-Games 15 in 2010 for the same event. Cruse had suffered an injury just weeks before the event and still completed the event after falling during the race. Cruse finished eighth.\nRWR returned to the X Games in 2011 with a new rider in the Women's Moto X, Vicki Golden. Golden had competed with RWR and Tuf Honda during the 2011 AMA Arenacross Series and gave her the nod for X Games 17.  Vicki Golden grabbed the holeshot for the event and went on to win gold for the organizations first gold medal in the X Games.\nOther series\nAllison Legacy Series\nIn 2012, Rick Ware Racing joined the Allison Legacy Series with Tyler Hill, the brother of Timmy Hill.
