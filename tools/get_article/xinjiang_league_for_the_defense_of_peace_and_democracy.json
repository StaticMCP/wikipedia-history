It was led by former progressive leaders of the Second East Turkestan Republic and Coalition Government of Xinjiang Province, including Ehmetjan Qasimi (as chairman), Asgat Iskhakov, Seypidin Azizi, and Abdukerim Abbasov.\nThe Xinjiang League was formed on 1 August 1948 by 30 representatives of various leftist groups, chief among them the Democratic Revolutionary Party, the founding of which had been encouraged by the CCP. At its first and only congress in March 1950, the Xinjiang League voted to transform itself into the '''Xinjiang People's Democratic League'''.\nReferences"
