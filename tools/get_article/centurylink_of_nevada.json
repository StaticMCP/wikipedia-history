Its largest market is Las Vegas\nHistory\nThe company was established in 1971 as a subsidiary of Centel providing service in parts of North Carolina, Florida, and Nevada. In 1992, Centel was acquired by Sprint, which merged Centel's Florida operations into its existing Florida subsidiary, but the Central Telephone Company retained its corporate name and North Carolina and Nevada operations. In 2006, Sprint spun off its local telephone business as Embarq, which was then acquired by CenturyTel (now Lumen Technologies) in 2009.\nSale of North Carolina assets\nOn August 3, 2021, Lumen announced its sale of its ILEC telephone assets in 20 states to Apollo Global Management, including North Carolina. The divested assets now operate as Brightspeed. Lumen continues to provide services in Nevada through CenturyLink of Nevada..\nReferences"
