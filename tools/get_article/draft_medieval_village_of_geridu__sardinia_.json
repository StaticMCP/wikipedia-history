It is the only medieval site on the island where large-scale excavations have been conducted.\nThe site of the medieval village of Geridu was already inhabited before the Middle Ages, during Late Antiquity it was occupied by a farm or rural settlement linked to the exploitation of agricultural resources. The decline of '''Geridu's population''' began in the late 14th century, and according to historical sources, the village was abandoned in the early 15th century, sometime before 1427.\nThe site continues to be promoted by cultural organizations in Sardinia as a place of archaeological and historical interest.\nGeridu is under protection of the Italian Ministry of Culture, which lists it among abandoned medieval heritage site.\nLocation\nThe medieval village of Geridu is located within the municipal territory of Sorso, northern Sardinia. The site is about 2 kilometers from the village of Sorso and 10 kilometers from the city of Sassari. The Village is  situated near the St.Andrew's \"cave\" and alongside Provincial Road 25, which connects the town of Sorso with nearby Sennori.\nThe village is located on a hill in the Nurra plain, from which it is possible to see the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Gulf of Asinara. The area of the plain is rural; in fact, there are no significant modern constructions. The soil is particularly fertile, supporting various crops, among which vineyards and olive groves are the most prominent.\nEtymology\nThe first mention of the village's name appeared in the  Condaghe di San Pietro di Silki       (1122) where the form Gereti appeared, a term likely derived from the Latin word for \"villa Gereti\", a hypothesis that would explain the genitive ending.  The first form, Geriti, considered the most correct spelling, prevailed from 1287 and continued throughout the fourteenth century; despite this, several variants appeared in literature and written sources.\nDuring the 14th century, in fact, the form Geriti began to alternate in Aragonese documents with other different forms such as:\n* Leriti\n* Giriti\n* Gireti\n* Girate\nmore rarely:\n* Gerta\n* Geritino: Latin translation of the Catalan Geritì\nThe form Geredi appeared in 1426, due to the Sardinian linguistic phenomenon that transformed the intervocalic letter t into d. In 1629, the form Heredi appeared, which seems to reflect the Castilian pronunciation.\nFrom the 16th century, the variants Geridi and Geridu became widespread, and today the place name is attested as Geridu (in Sorso and Sassari) and Zeridu (in Sennori).\nThe name of the village has sometimes been distorted, both in ancient sources and in later literature, due to biblical influence. In particular, the phonetic similarity between Geriti and Gerici has led several authors and copyists to confuse the two terms, mistakenly linking the toponym to the biblical city of Jericho. This misinterpretation has also given rise to the hypothesis, never confirmed by documentary evidence, of the presence of a Jewish community in the area in the past, just as occurred in the nearby village of Sennori.\nThe origin of this error can be traced to the frequent confusion, in medieval paleography, between the letters c and t. Non-Sardinian scribes, who often copied texts without direct knowledge of the territory or local pronunciation, could have read Gerici instead of Geriti when transcribing.\nThis type of misunderstanding could have lead to other confusion with other Sardinian villages, such as Gèsico (province of Cagliari)and Silìqua (province of Cagliari), attested in fourteenth-century sources with the forms Yelicho and Xilico.\nHistory\nEarly occupation\nThe site of Geridu was first inhabited in pre-medieval times, during the protohistoric and Roman periods. In Late Antiquity it housed a farm or rural settlement linked to the exploitation of the surrounding land. Current research has not yet pinpointed the exact date of the medieval settlement of Geridu, but some scholars suggest that a new village was founded around the year 1100 on top of an earlier Roman occupation. The Condaghe di San Pietro documents the existence of Geridu in entries dated 1112 and 1129....entries dated 1112 and 1129.\nMedieval foundation and regional context\nThe choice of the site was not accidental: the hill offered fertile soils, abundant water resources, a mild climate and a strategic position close to both the coast and the city of Sassari. These conditions made Geridu an important reference point for rural communities in northern Sardinia throughout the Middle Ages. The village lay within the Curatoria of Romangia, an administrative district of the Judicate of Torres, together with nearby settlements such as Sorso, Sennori, Gennor, Taniga and Uruspe, which formed one of the most economically active areas of the Logudoro region.\nReliable written information is scarce before the late thirteenth century, but sources indicate that by this time Geridu had developed into a substantial rural centre. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries it was one of the most populous settlements in Romangia, reaching a peak of about 1,250 inhabitants around 1320.\nEconomy and trade\nDuring its peak, Geridu benefited from a flourishing agrarian economy based on cereal cultivation, vineyards, orchards, gardens and livestock farming on the surrounding pastures. Documentary and archaeological evidence point to close links with merchants from Pisa and Genoa, and to the presence of monastic communities active in the cultural and economic development of inland Logudoro.\nExcavations conducted by University of Sassari's researchers have brought to light numerous coins and imported ceramics alongside local pottery, indicating that the inhabitants participated in wider Mediterranean trade networks and were able to acquire non-essential and prestige goods. Recent discoveries of Sicilian and Tunisian wares dated to the eleventh and twelfth centuries suggest that the area was already economically active before the high medieval peak, and that the standard of living in Geridu was comparable to that of urban mercantile communities such as Pisa and Genoa.\nPolitical framework and fourteenth-century crises\nAfter the conquest of Sardinia by the Crown of Aragon (1323–1326), Geridu became involved in the changing balance of power between the municipality of Sassari, royal authority and local feudal lords. Although treaties initially stipulated that Sassari and its dependent villages could not be separated from the royal domain, Geridu was repeatedly granted as a fief to Catalan nobles in return for military and financial obligations, provoking protests and legal disputes from the city.\nDuring the fourteenth century the village alternated between direct royal administration and private lordship, while the wider region was affected by conflicts involving Sassari, powerful noble families and the Judicate of Arborea, as well as anti-Aragonese revolts. These political tensions, together with heavier fiscal pressure, social conflict and episodes of violence, contributed to a gradual worsening of living conditions in the countryside. From the mid-fourteenth century onward, repeated crises, warfare and epidemic disease set the stage for the progressive depopulation and eventual abandonment of Geridu in the early fifteenth century (see Village abandonment below).\nVillage abandonment\nArchaeological, documentary and stratigraphic evidence indicate that the medieval village of Geridu was progressively abandoned between the second half of the fourteenth century and the early fifteenth century, during the Arborean occupation of Romangia (1366–1388). Depopulation was not the result of a single event but of the combined effects of heavy fiscal pressure, local warfare, economic contraction and epidemic disease in the region.\nExcavations show phases of destruction, partial reuse and the stripping of building materials: some houses were damaged by fire and later reoccupied on a more limited scale, while others were dismantled and their stones, roof timbers and tiles reused in neighbouring settlements.  By the early fifteenth century Geridu no longer functioned as a permanent village. Only a few rural churches, such as San Biagio and Sant'Andrea, remained in use for some time to serve the surrounding rural population, before Sant'Andrea was eventually demolished in the nineteenth century to make way for the parish church of San Pantaleo in Sorso.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Geridu - Political and Institutional Framework (1323-1444)\n|before 1323 - 1325\n|Municipality of Sassari\n|-\n|1324\n|nominal Aragonese enfeoffment to Guillem Oulomar\n|-\n|1325 -1334\n|Fief of Thomas Ça-Costa\n|-\n|1327 or 1328\n|vicarius (?)

The remaining numbers correspond to vicars, procurators, mayors, and village chiefs.\nArchaeological, documentary, and stratigraphic evidence show that the medieval village of Geridu was gradually abandoned between the second half of the 14th century and the early 15th century, during the Alborense occupation of Romangia (1366-1388). The depopulation did not occur all at once; it was the result of a long process driven by events such as economic crises, plagues, wars, and episodes of violence and destruction. The ruined buildings were sometimes reused in a partial and sporadic manner.\nCauses and Dynamics of Depopulation\nScholars show that there is not a single cause for the abandonment; it was caused by the combination of several different factors:\n# Heavy fiscal and economic pressure: After the Catalan-Aragonese feudalization process, rural communities had to face a heavy tax burden, as they were subjected both to the fiscal pressure imposed by the Municipality of Sassari and to that of the Catalan authorities. In an already fragile context, loans were often granted on usurious terms, a fact that significantly increased debt and worsened the population’s living conditions.\n# Local conflicts and wars: Geridu was heavily affected by the conflict involving Sassari, the Doria family, and the Giudicato of Arborea, followed by anti-Aragonese rebellions. Numerous traces of destruction show that repeated military incursions and indirect wartime damage, such as ruined crops, loss of agricultural labour caused by forced recruitment, arrests, or deportations, forced the inhabitants to abandon the village and move to safer fortified centres like Sassari or Osilo.\n# Episodes of Destruction and Spoliation: Archaeological studies show that several structures bear evidence of violent destruction. Some buildings show collapsed, others were set on fire.\n# Plagues and epidemics: Anthropological and paleopathological analyses have uncovered signs, such as mass graves that can be attributed to epidemic diseases, which may correspond to the great waves of the Black Death that struck the island in the 14th century. Sources report that, following these epidemics, the population of Geridu declined drastically, being reduced by half.\n# Economic Crisis and Reduction in Coinage in Use: Numismatic evidence suggests that coins became less common after the first decades of Aragonese settlement. Coins from the second half of the 14th century are rarely found in archaeological contexts, pointing to a gradual economic slowdown and a reduction in trade.\nThe Process of Abandonment\nThe decline of the village was a gradual process. After most of the inhabitants had left, the buildings were slowly stripped of materials and only sporadically used after collapsing.\nStratigraphic evidence and material findings, such as ceramics and coins, suggest that some reuse and occasional occupation continued into the first half of the 15th century, even though the village no longer existed as a stable community. Indeed, during the Arborean occupation of Romangia (1366–1388), depopulation became definitively irreversible, and between the late 14th and early 15th centuries, Geridu was completely abandoned.\nFrom that moment, it became a sort of quarry for building materials: door jambs, stones, roof timber, and tiles were recovered and reused by the inhabitants of the surrounding areas.\nIn the village, only a few rural churches remained, such as San Biagio and, Sant'Andrea, which was still active in the 16th century but was demolished in the mid-19th century to make way for the parish church of San Pantaleo in Sorso.\nSite and archaeology\nBackground and Research Objectives\nResearch on the medieval village of Geridu began in the mid-1990s and continued until the early 2000s, under the direction of archaeologist Marco Milanese of the University of Sassari. This project aimed to study the history and structure of the archaeological site and learn more about abandoned sites.\nA significant portion of the research focused on analyzing historical sources held at the Archives of the Crown of Aragon in Barcelona, ​​which were consulted and studied by Professors G. Meloni and A. Soddu. These documents allowed them to connect archaeological data with information from medieval texts, thus providing a more complete picture of village life. During the first phase of research, which took place between 1995 and 1996, researchers focused on analyzing and assessing the stratigraphic potential of the area to understand its archaeological richness. In the years that followed, the focus shifted to broader and more diverse topics, such as:\n* village's organization\n* daily lives of its inhabitants\n* village's infrastructure\n* agricultural landscape\n* village's commercial activities\n* social differences within the community.\nTo advance the studies, various disciplines were involved and collaborations were established with other university departments, combining expertise in archaeology, history, botany, and anthropology. However, some planned methods, such as geophysical surveys, were not implemented due to lack of funding.\nFrom 1997 to 1999, research focused specifically on studying the boundaries of the settlement, which must have covered approximately 9–10 hectares. During this period, the main excavation site, covering approximately 1,000 m² and known as Area 3000, was opened. At least fifteen buildings were identified in that area, and their layout and the relationships between them were analyzed.\nThe studies were not limited to this main area, but extended to various parts of the site. Stratigraphic surveys and verification tests were conducted, which helped to provide a better idea of the village's general appearance and understand how it evolved over time.\nLe ricerche archeologiche\nGli scavi recenti hanno confermato la localizzazione esatta del villaggio e hanno permesso di ottenere importanti risultati per la conoscenza non solo di Geridu, ma anche dei villaggi rurali medievali della Sardegna.\nLe indagini, guidate dal Dipartimento di Storia dell’Università di Sassari, hanno permesso di:\n* verificare e confermare molte informazioni ricavate dai documenti medievali,\n* correggere o rivedere conoscenze prima incomplete,\n* ampliare notevolmente i dati disponibili grazie anche a nuove ricerche d’archivio.\nOggi Geridu è uno dei villaggi medievali sardi meglio documentati, grazie alla combinazione di:\n* fonti scritte,\n* scavi archeologici,\n* studi multidisciplinari.\nArchaeological Survey (1996–1998)\nBetween 1996 and 1998, four archaeological survey campaigns were conducted in the area of ​​the medieval village of Geridu and its immediate vicinity. These activities aimed to gather preliminary information on the site's size and structure before beginning stratigraphic excavations. They were directed by Barbara Boero, Consuelo Sozzi, and Marco Milanese.\nThe project was organized into two different levels of study: extensive and intensive.\nExtensive Survey\nIn the first phase, an attempt was made to define the village's boundaries and determine whether any minor settlements existed nearby. The exploration covered an area of ​​approximately 2 square kilometers and involved 3 to 15 researchers. The intensity of the work was calculated at 55 man-days per square kilometer, while visibility of the terrain was generally low due to vegetation and soil conditions.\nThrough this phase, it was possible to estimate the size of the village to be between 9 and 10 hectares. During the research, a small secondary settlement was also identified in the locality of Santu Biasu.\nIntensive and systematic survey\nIn the second phase, the research became more targeted and methodical. Several sample areas (called areas 4000, 6000, and 10000) were selected for more detailed analysis.\nThe survey covered approximately 0.037 km² and involved 4 to 15 operators, with a work intensity of 1,500 man-days per square kilometer, much higher than that of extensive surveys.\nTo collect the data, close transects were used, spaced between 3 and 12 meters, which allowed for a precise observation of how the finds were distributed and a better understanding of the layout of the settlement compared to the agricultural areas. Visibility of the terrain varied greatly: in unworked fields, it was reduced, while in deeply plowed land (up to 50 cm) it was excellent.\nDuring the surveys, in area 6000, an area characterized by dark soil, with traces of ash and charcoal, was identified, which was likely used as a vegetable garden or agricultural land in medieval times.\nThe information obtained through the reconnaissance was subsequently verified with control stratigraphic tests opened in sectors called: 4000, 4500, 10000, 11000 and 12000. The results of these checks confirmed the topographic precision and validity of the surface data obtained in this research phase.\nTopography\nBetween 1997 and 1999, a series of archaeological excavations were carried out, to better understand how the medieval village was organized and how it developed over time. This project aimed to reconstruct the layout of the settlement, identifying the main residential areas, open spaces, and the location of the cemetery. Researchers also looked at evidence for religious and administrative buildings, as well as traces of productive and agricultural activities connected to the village.\nOne of the most important excavation areas, called Area 3000, is located north of a church, on a slope, and extends over approximately 1,000 square meters. In this area, researchers identified fifteen rooms, nine of which overlook a large open courtyard. This courtyard, which included a bread oven, appears to have been shared by several families and was used both for harvesting and for daily social life.\nThe houses in the village of Geridu were generally rectangular and ranged in size from approximately 26 to 66 square meters. They were built with local limestone, forming double-sided walls, which were filled with smaller stones and debris. The corners, doorposts, and thresholds were made of roughly squared blocks. The builders used clay as mortar, and the roofs were covered with curved terracotta tiles supported by wooden beams, the recesses of which are still visible in the walls.\nThe floors were made of beaten earth, and in the center of each room was a wooden post supporting the main roof beam. To allow smoke to escape, it is assumed that a raised fireplace was placed near the door, as no chimney structure was found. The corners of the rooms often housed storerooms, which contained large Iberian jars for water, oil, or grain; while underground, lined silos were used to store food supplies.\nBehind the main houses were narrow alleys that separated the buildings and also helped drain rainwater from the roofs.\nThe connection between this residential, northern part of the village and the necropolis remains unclear. The cemetery, located around the church of Sant'Andrea, has not been fully delineated, but numerous external ossuaries have been found near the church. The ossuaries contained human bones that had been moved from temporary earthen tombs, sometimes even before the decomposition process was complete.\nThe church (built around 1330 in Gothic-Catalan style) and a large adjacent structure, discovered in 1999 within Area 4000 (with a western wall approximately 20 meters long), were built using a much more sophisticated technique than common dwellings. Both buildings were constructed by skilled masons; their walls are made of carefully selected stone blocks, joined with high-quality lime mortar, unlike the clay masonry of the village houses.\nBoth structures were built on a raised terrace, protected by a slope. Their elevated position and excellent construction quality suggest that this area served as the religious and administrative center of Geridu. The terrace dominates the northern part of the settlement and marks its western boundary, demonstrating the social and spatial hierarchy of the village community.\nExcavation of the Geridu Village (1996–2000)\nThe excavation campaigns conducted between 1996 and 2000 provided insight into the organization and appearance of the medieval village of Geridu, clearly revealing the characteristics of its urban structure and the daily life of its inhabitants.\nThe settlement consisted of rectangular dwellings, built with limestone blocks bound with clay, with floors made of rammed earth. The roofs were made of tiles supported by wooden beams and a central pole, which was necessary to support the entire structure.\nDuring the investigations, numerous everyday objects emerged: agricultural tools, ceramics, kitchen utensils, and fragments of rainwater harvesting systems, testifying to the rural nature of the village. Other significant finds included pots, pans, jugs, and a wooden chest (type of furniture typical of medieval homes).\nArchaeological campaigns\nAt the center of the village was a large courtyard, approximately 250 square meters, overlooked by at least six buildings (with two more to be verified).\nExcavations conducted between 1997 and 1999 revealed that this area constituted the heart of the settlement. The living spaces and those intended for work and service activities were arranged around the courtyard.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Building\n!Excavation Area\n!Size & Layout\n!Wall Structure & Roof\n!Internal Features\n!Function/interpretation\n!Main Finds\n!Phases & Reuse\n|-\n|1\n|Area 3100 (northern sector)\n|ca. 43 m², rectangular\n|Double-faced limestone masonry with clay plaster; gabled roof with central wooden post\n|Two rooms: kitchen/living area with clay hearth and pantry (jars, carbonized grain); second room used as stable\n|Domestic dwelling (living space + animal shelter)\n|Carbonized grain, domestic tools, weapons\n|Abandoned suddenly after a fire\n|-\n|2\n|Area 3100, south of Building 1\n|30 m² → reduced to 20 m²\n|Double-faced limestone walls\n|Two hearths built with Silurian phyllite (refractory stones); no partitions\n|Workshop or production space (agricultural/pastoral processing)\n|“Alfonsino” coin of James II of Aragon (20m long\n|Mortared masonry (rare at Geridu); same technique as village church\n|Secondary rooms with earthen walls, stone crawl space, brick gutters, slab of burnt clay; rock-cut basin (2.6 × 1.5 × 0.8 m) for rainwater\n|Elite residence or public building\n|\n|Partial reuse (stone blocks reused in Building 6)\n|}\nAnthropological Research\nThe anthropological research conducted at Geridu aimed to reconstruct the medieval village's population, combining excavation data with biological and documentary evidence. The study was divided into three main sections: analysis of human remains, examination of the cemetery area, and demographic research based on modern-era parish registers.\nAnalysis of Human Remains\nScholars examined the human remains found at the site. They come from 25 individuals in total and are relatively well preserved. Infant remains were almost absent: only one newborn was found, a relatively low percentage for a medieval society, where infant mortality could exceed 50% within the first year of life. Among the adult remains, 16 in number, males appear to be slightly more prevalent.\nCemetery Excavation\nExcavations conducted in the burial area identified various phases of use and various types of burials. In sector 2800, a large ossuary was uncovered containing remains belonging to hundreds of individuals, a find that provided a very large sample for the study of the village's population and the health status of the people of Geridu.\nIn sector 2500, however, individual earthen graves were found, dug approximately 40 centimeters deep, with stone markers placed from head to toe of the deceased. The graves were arranged in an orderly fashion and did not overlap, a sign of a certain level of organization. This phase has been dated to the first half of the 14th century.\nExcavations uncovered 25 individual graves in pits dated between the late 13th and the first half of the 14th century. These included the skeleton of an adult female with signs of congenital brachymetatarsia, believed to be the only such case in paleopathology.\nStudy of the Parish Registers\nTo complement the data obtained from the excavations, research was undertaken on the quinque libri, the parish registers that served as a sort of census of the faithful, as they documented baptisms, marriages, deaths, and confirmations.\nThese documents began to be compiled in the province of Sassari towards the end of the 16th century and represent a very useful source for understanding the composition of the Sardinian population after the abandonment of Geridu.\nThe study focused specifically on the Sorso registers, which begin in 1614. However, only in the Spanish era are the ages of the deceased indicated, allowing scholars to conduct more precise analyses.\nInterpretation of the results\nBy combining archaeological, anthropological, and documentary investigations, it was possible to reconstruct a more complete picture of the Geridu community. The studies shed light on funerary practices and cemetery organization, and provided a better understanding of the population's biology, living conditions, and relationships with neighboring communities.\nGallery\nFile:Archaeological_site_of_Geridu_1.jpg|Stone remains of a medieval building at Geridu\nFile:Archaeological_site_of_Geridu_2.jpg|General view of the archaeological site of Geridu\nBotanical and Faunal Evidence\nBotanical remains\nThe site of Geridu lies within one of the few landscapes on Sardinia that has undergone intense transformation as a result of human agricultural activities over the centuries with the creation of olive groves, vineyards, and orchards. The natural vegetation includes holm oaks, mastic trees, and hornbeams, and is similar to what probably existed between the 12th and the 14th centuries.\nSince 1996, an archaeobotanical research program has been active to study the environment and the activities carried out on the site through the analysis of carbonised plant remains. These studies highlight the presence of numerous plant species, some still common in Sardinia, others now absent but related to specific ancient uses.\nAnthracological analyses (on burnt wood remains) showed that the plants used by the people of Geridu included chestnut, deciduous oaks, and hop hornbeam; these would be mainly used as building material or fuel. Mastic and heather are common Mediterranean species and were used as domestic firewood. Other fragments belonged to species not native to Sardinia, such as silver fir and beech, which are likely to have been imported as timber from the Italian mainland.\nThe presence of carbonised remnants of vines, fruit trees, willows, and reeds, together with thousands of charred seeds of cereals and legumes, indicate intensive agricultural usage in the area, typical of a well-organized rural community.\nBiddas Museum\nFindings from Geridu are preserved and exhibited at the Biddas Museum, an cultural space that is about to open again together with a new phase of excavations, hosted in the Baronial Palace of Sorso. This cultural space is dedicated to the history of abandoned medieval villages in Sardinia and has received the 2013 Francovich Award for its ability to combine innovation and tradition through modern communication.\nThe museum showcases a selection of artifacts unearthed at Geridu, including ceramics and other medieval objects, giving visitors a clearer sense of what everyday life was for settlers of Geridu, along with exhibits that interpret the phenomenon of depopulation in Sardinia.\nSoft walking trails and agricultural landscapes make the area accessible to visitors interested in combining historical and nature tourism. The site is particularly valued by those exploring rural Sardinia and cultural heritage itineraries in the Sassari region.\nSee also\n* Medieval archaeology\n* List of archaeological sites in Italy\n* Judicate of Logudoro\n* History of Sardinia\n* Italy in the Middle Ages\n*Cosmeston Medieval Village\n*Hundatorra\n* Medieval archaeology\n* History of Sardinia\n* List of archaeological sites in Italy\n*National Archaeological Museum, Cagliari\n*National Archaeological Museum, Naples\n*National Archaeological Museum, Florence\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://beniabbandonati.cultura.gov.it/beni/villaggio-medievale-di-geridu/ Official listing on the Italian Ministry of Culture website]\n* [https://www.comune.sorso.ss.it/ Municipality of Sorso – Geridu project page]\n* [https://www.museobiddas.it/ Biddas Museum official site]\n* [https://www.isoladisardegna.com/isola/la-romangia.html La Romangia - Isola di Sardegna]\n* [https://www.uniss.it/it Home page | Università degli Studi di Sassari]\n* [https://www.visitsorso.it/territorio/archeologia/il-villaggio-medioevale-di-geridu/?utm_source=chatgpt.com Il villaggio medioevale di Geridu | Visitsorso]"
