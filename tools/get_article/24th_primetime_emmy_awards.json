The ceremony was hosted by Johnny Carson.  Winners are listed in bold and series' networks are in parentheses.\nThe top shows of the night were All in the Family and Elizabeth R. All in the Family set numerous records during the night, it became the first show to win six major awards, (although one came in a tie, this record would be broken by other shows that won six major awards outright). It also became the first non-anthology drama to receive at least ten major nominations.\nA milestone was set when All in the Family and Columbo each received every nomination in a major category, both for writing. This feat has become extremely rare as the field of nominees expanded to five and later six.\nGlenda Jackson also made history by receiving three acting nominations for the same performance as Queen Elizabeth I in Elizabeth R.  Rule changes have made this impossible in later ceremonies. In addition, by beating the Big Three TV networks, this was PBS' first win for Outstanding Drama. (Though the N.E.T. network was the first to win this award, against the Big Three, in 1969, NET would eventually dissolve, but would become the direct predecessor to PBS.)  This show was also the first non-American made show to win this award.\nWinners and nominees\nSource:\nNote: Winners are listed in bold type.\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'All in the Family (CBS)'\n** The Mary Tyler Moore Show (CBS)\n** The Odd Couple (ABC)\n** Sanford and Son (NBC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Elizabeth R (PBS)'\n** Columbo (NBC)\n** Mannix (CBS)\n** Marcus Welby, M.D. (ABC)\n** The Six Wives of Henry VIII (CBS)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'The Carol Burnett Show (CBS)'\n** The Dean Martin Comedy Hour (NBC)\n** The Flip Wilson Show (NBC)\n** The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'The Dick Cavett Show (ABC)'\n** The David Frost Show (Syndicated)\n** The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (NBC)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* S Wonderful 'S Marvelous 'S Gershwin (NBC)'\n** The Flip Wilson Show (NBC): \"Sammy Davis Jr., Lily Tomlin and Ed McMahon\"\n** Julie and Carol at Lincoln Center (CBS)\n** The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour (CBS): \"Tony Randall and Honey Cone\"\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'Bernstein on Beethoven: A Celebration in Vienna (CBS)'\n** Heifetz (NBC)\n** The Peking Ballet: First Spectacular from China (NBC)\n** The Trial of Mary Lincoln (PBS)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'The Doctors (NBC)'\n** General Hospital (ABC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'Sesame Street (PBS)'\n** The Electric Company (PBS)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'ABC's Wide World of Sports (ABC)\n* 1971 AFC Championship Game (NBC)'\n** NFL Monday Night Football (ABC)\n** Rose Bowl Game (NBC)\n** World Series (NBC)\n** XI Olympic Winter Games (NBC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'Brian's Song (ABC)'\n** All in the Family (CBS): \"Sammy's Visit\"\n** Elizabeth R (PBS): \"The Lion's Cub\"\n** The Snow Goose (NBC)\n** The Six Wives of Henry VIII (CBS): \"Jane Seymour\"\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" colspan=\"2\"|\n*'Elizabeth R (PBS)'\n** Columbo (NBC)\n** Sanford and Son (NBC)\n** The Six Wives of Henry VIII (CBS)\n** The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour (CBS)\n|}\nActing\nLead performances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'''Carroll O'Connor as Archie Bunker in All in the Family (CBS)'\n**Redd Foxx as Fred G.
