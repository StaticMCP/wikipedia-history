It is located at the Oliver D. Filley House on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.\nHistory\nOn May 18, 1954, the institute was incorporated as a non-political, non-profit organization under the laws of the State of New York.\nIn 1965, the philanthropist Margaret Rockefeller Strong, saved the landmark building 684 Park Avenue from destruction. With her support and funding from McMicking Foundation, the institute made this building its headquarters.\nThe institute was renamed in 2003, to recognize Queen Sofía of Spain as its patroness.\nIn 2014, the building was sold.
