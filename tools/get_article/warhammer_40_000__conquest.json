The game featured two players competing to win a series of battles on a different planets while simultaneously securing the resources of other planets that will have battles on subsequent turns. Fans of the game praised the strategic element of having multiple distinct battle fields as a feature that distinguished it from other card games. On September 9, 2016, Games Workshop announced that Conquest would be discontinued in February 2017, as a result of Games Workshop's failure to renew Fantasy Flight Games' contract because of a conflict between Games Workshop and Fantasy Flight Games' parent company, Asmodee.  The game still has a small community of players who play with the cards that were printed before the game's discontinuation in 2017, and some fans have made unofficial expansions to expand the small card pool.\nExtensions\nCore set\nCore Set includes 7 playable factions: Space Marines, Chaos, Eldar, Dark Eldar, Tau, Orks, and Astra Militarum (former Imperial Guard).\nDeluxe extensions\nEach deluxe expansion contains 3 copies of every card.\n:* The Great Devourer which adds Tyranids as a playable faction.\n:* Legions of Death which adds Necrons as a playable faction.\nCycles\nEvery cycle has 6 packs associated with it.
