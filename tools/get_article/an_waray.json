An Waray Party List is a democratic multi-sectoral party-list organization that envisions a just, progressive and peaceful Filipino society characterized by its principles katilingban (sense of community), kahimyang (peace) and kauswagan (progress) through the adoption of a community-based and peace oriented development agenda.\nAn Waray had its registration cancelled by the Commission on Elections for letting its second nominee assume office in 2013 despite being entitled to only a seat, violating the Party-List System Act. The ruling was affirmed on August 14, 2023, by the commission en banc; and was upheld by the Supreme Court in a decision promulgated on August 6, 2024.\nElectoral performance\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n!Election !!
