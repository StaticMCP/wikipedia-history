The winner received £30,000, and the five shortlisted writers each received £1,000. A longlist of 16 was also announced. The award was established in 2010 by Cathy Galvin of The Sunday Times newspaper and Sir Matthew Evans of EFG Private Bank (and formerly of Faber and Faber). In 2019, award sponsorship changed to Audible, which withdrew its sponsorship after the 2021 award. It has been called the richest prize in the world for a single short story.\nAnother major single-short-story award in the UK is the BBC National Short Story Award, which was called the richest prize in the world for a single short story at £15,000 in 2008; however, as of 2013, The Sunday Times award was twice as large.\nThe Bookseller reported in July 2022 that the prize was \"in danger of being discontinued\" as Audible had withdrawn their sponsorship the previous year. At that time Andrew Holgate, literary editor of the Sunday Times, said that the prize had had to be delayed for a year as no replacement sponsor had been found.\nWinners and shortlisted nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+Sunday Times Short Story Award winners and shortlists\n!Year\n!Author\n!Title\n!Result\n!Ref.\n|- style=background:#cddeff\n! rowspan=\"5\" |2010\n|\n|\"Last Season's Man\"\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n|\n|\"Nothing but Grass\"\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n|\"Critical Responses to My Last Relationship\"\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n|\"Fewer Things\"\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n|\"It's Not Yours\"\n|Shortlist\n|\n|- style=background:#cddeff\n! rowspan=\"5\" |2011\n|\n|\"\"\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n|\n|\"East Coast – West Coast\"\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n|\"\"\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n|\"\"\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n|\"\"\n|Shortlist\n|\n|- style=background:#cddeff\n! rowspan=\"6\" |2012\n|\n|\"Beer Trip to Llandudno\"\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"\"\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"Nickel Mines Hardware\"\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"Where the Gods Fly\"\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"\"\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"El Aziz: Some Pages from His Notebook\"\n|Shortlist\n|\n|- style=background:#cddeff\n! rowspan=\"6\" |2013\n|\n| \"Miss Lora\"\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"\"\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"Evie\"\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"\"\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"Call It 'The Bug' Because I Have No Time to Think of a Better Title\"\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"\"\n|Shortlist\n|\n|- style=background:#cddeff\n! rowspan=\"6\" |2014\n|\n| \"Nirvana\"\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"Anwar Gets Everything\"\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"Othello\"\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"Number Three\"\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"Snow Blind\"\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"\"\n|Shortlist\n|\n|- style=background:#cddeff\n! rowspan=\"6\" |2015\n|\n| \"\"\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"\"\n| Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"Hungry\"\n| Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"False River\"\n| Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"Interstellar Space\"\n| Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"\"\n| Shortlist\n|\n|- style=background:#cddeff\n! rowspan=\"6\" |2016\n|\n| \"\"\n| Winner\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"\"\n| Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"\"\n| Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"What Time Is It Now, Where You Are?\"\n| Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"Unbechert\"\n| Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"\"\n| Shortlist\n|\n|- style=background:#cddeff\n! rowspan=\"6\" |2017\n|\n| \"Half of What Atlee Rouse Knows About Horses\"\n| Winner\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"Reputation Management\"\n| Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"\"\n| Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"\"\n| Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"Every Little Thing\"\n| Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| \"Mr Salary\"\n| Shortlist\n|\n|- style=background:#cddeff\n! rowspan=\"6\" |2018\n|\n|Peanuts Aren't Nuts\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n|\n| F.A.Q.s\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| Herman Melville, Volume 1\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| Life on Earth\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| Do-Over\n|Shortlist\n|\n|- style=background:#cddeff\n! rowspan=\"6\" |2019\n|\n|\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| What Can You Do with a General\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| All The Poems Contained Within Will Mean Everything to Everyone\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| In Silhouette\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| Comme\n|Shortlist\n|\n|- style=background:#cddeff\n! rowspan=\"5\" |2020\n|\n|Love Many\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n|\n| Sparing the Heather\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| Simon\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| Take It\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| Granma's Porch\n|Shortlist\n|\n|- style=background:#cddeff\n! rowspan=\"6\" |2021\n|\n|Flashlight\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| Sleeping Beauty\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n| Call\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|Shortlist\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140203024643/http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/public/stefg/ Sunday Times Short Story Award], official website"
