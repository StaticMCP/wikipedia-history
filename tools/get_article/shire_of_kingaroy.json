The shire covered an area of , and existed as a local government area from 1912 until 2008, when it amalgamated with a number of other local government areas in the South Burnett area to become the South Burnett Region.\nThe seat of the shire was the town of Kingaroy, which continues as the set of the South Burnett Region.\nThe shire's name derives from the Wakka Wakka Aboriginal words \"king dhu'roi\", meaning \"ant hungry\". While land use was dominantly pastoral in the area's early European history, dairying, beef, small crops and in particular peanut farming became mainstays of Kingaroy's economy.\nHistory\nKingaroy was originally part of the Barambah (later Nanango) Divisional Board, which was created on 11 November 1879 under the Divisional Boards Act 1879. With the passage of the Local Authorities Act 1902, Nanango became a shire council on 31 March 1903.\nThe town of Kingaroy started to grow after the arrival of the railway in 1904, and on 12 January 1912, the Shire of Kingaroy was proclaimed.\nIn 1923, Dr Ellen Kent Hughes was elected to the Kingaroy Shire Council, the first woman council member elected to a local government council in Queensland.\nOn 15 March 2008, under the Local Government (Reform Implementation) Act 2007 passed by the Parliament of Queensland on 10 August 2007, the Shire of Kingaroy merged with the Shires of Murgon, Nanango and Wondai to form the South Burnett Regional Council.\nTowns and localities\nThe Shire of Kingaroy included the following settlements:\n* Kingaroy\n* Coolabunia\n* Goodger\n* Inverlaw\n* Kumbia\n* Memerambi\n* Taabinga\n* Wooroolin\nChairmen\n* 1927: R.
