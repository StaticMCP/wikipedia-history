He served as Dean for Medical Education at Harvard Medical School (HMS) from 2014 to 2023 and was previously President of Case Western Reserve University (2002–2006), Dean of the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, and Associate Dean for Student Affairs at HMS. Hundert is currently a senior lecturer in global health and social medicine and Associate Director of the Center for Bioethics at HMS.\nBiography\nHundert was born in Woodbridge, New Jersey, and graduated from Yale University in 1978 with a B.S. summa cum laude in mathematics and the history of science and medicine. He then attended Oxford University as a Marshall Scholar, earning an M.A. (Oxon.) in Philosophy, Politics and Economics in 1980. In 1984, he received his M.D. from Harvard Medical School, where he also completed his residency training in psychiatry at McLean Hospital (serving as chief resident).\nHundert spent the early part of his career at Harvard Medical School, rising to Associate Professor of Psychiatry and serving as Associate Dean for Student Affairs from 1990 to 1997. In 1997, he joined the University of Rochester, where he became Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Professor of Psychiatry and Medical Humanities. He was appointed Dean of the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry in 2000, a position he held until 2002. During his tenure at Rochester, Hundert led the creation of the school's \"Double Helix Curriculum,\" integrating basic and clinical sciences across all four years of medical training.\nIn August 2002, Hundert became the 6th President of Case Western Reserve University, serving in that role until 2006. As president, he oversaw the expansion of Case Western's medical school in partnership with the Cleveland Clinic, establishing the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, a unique five-year program focused on training physician-scientists. Hundert then returned to the faculty at Harvard Medical School and was appointed HMS Dean for Medical Education in 2014, leading the school's MD program until stepping down in 2023. He continues to teach at HMS and contribute to its bioethics and global health programs in his current roles.\nResearch and Contributions\nHundert's scholarly work spans medical ethics, professionalism in medicine, and curriculum innovation. In 1987, he proposed a theoretical model for ethical problem-solving in clinical medicine, offering a structured process to help physicians resolve value conflicts in patient care. He has been a leading voice on professionalism and the \"hidden curriculum\" in medical training – his 1996 article, \"Characteristics of the Informal Curriculum and Trainees' Ethical Choices,\" became an influential publication in Academic Medicine and was later included in the journal's Classics Collection.\nIn 2002, Hundert co-authored \"Defining and Assessing Professional Competence\" with Ronald M. Epstein in JAMA. The article proposed an expanded framework for evaluating physician performance that included communication, professionalism, and lifelong learning, alongside clinical skill and knowledge.\nAs an educator, Hundert has led curriculum reform at multiple institutions. At Rochester, he launched the Double Helix Curriculum, noted for integrating science and clinical medicine across all four years of training. At Harvard, he spearheaded the design and rollout of the Pathways curriculum, introduced in 2015, which restructured the M.D. program around case-based collaborative learning, early exposure to primary care, and longitudinal professional development. In 2020, he was senior author on an Academic Medicine article documenting the Pathways approach.\nHundert is also the author of two books. His 1989 work, Philosophy, Psychiatry, and Neuroscience: Three Approaches to the Mind, explores theories of knowledge through a multidisciplinary synthesis. His 1995 book, Lessons from an Optical Illusion: On Nature and Nurture, Knowledge and Values, examines how perception and cognition inform philosophical debates about knowledge, ethics, and the mind.\nSelected Publications\n* Hundert EM (1987). \"A model for ethical problem solving in medicine, with practical applications.\" American Journal of Psychiatry, 144(7): 839–846.\n* Hundert EM, Hafferty F, Christakis D (1996). \"Characteristics of the informal curriculum and trainees' ethical choices.\" Academic Medicine, 71(6): 624–632.\n* Epstein RM, Hundert EM (2002). \"Defining and assessing professional competence.\" JAMA, 287(2): 226–235.\n* Schwartzstein RM, Dienstag JL, King RW, Chang BS, Flanagan JG, et al.
