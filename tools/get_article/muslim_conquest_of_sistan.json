A treaty was concluded, forcing the Sistanis to pay the Kharaj. From that point, there were many conflicts with the Turks, who resided in the area from Kandahar to Kabul.\nLike other provinces of the Persian Empire, Sistan broke into revolt during Uthman's reign in 649 CE. Uthman directed the governor of Busra, Abdullah ibn Aamir to re-conquer the province. A column was sent to Sistan under the command of Rabeah ibn Ziyad. He re-conquered it up to what is now Zaranj in Afghanistan. Rabeah ibn Ziyad was made governor of Sistan. He remained there for years, then he left for Busra, and the province again broke into revolt in a larger area.\nAbdullah ibn Aamir sent Abdulrehman ibn Sumra to undertake the operation. Abdur Rahman ibn Sumra led the Muslim forces to Sistan and after crossing the frontier and overcoming resistance in the border towns advanced to Zaranj, which at the time was named Zahidan. Once Zaranj was captured Abdulrehman marched into Afghanistan and conquered it north up to Kabul after proceeding to Hindu Kush mountain range, Zamindawar and the mountain of Ghor, which at the time was named Mandesh. During this campaign he destroyed some golden Idols and successfully captured the local Kushan Sahi king. He returned to Zaranj and remained governor until Uthman's death in 656.\n}}\nThe Campaign\nAbd al-Rahman ibn Samura installed a Rashidun governor of Sistan. He made an expedition against Kabul's king and defeated him and forced him to sign a treaty. After that Abd al-Rahman ibn Samura marched against Zabulistan, Bost and Arachosia and added these regions to the Muslim Empire. At the same time the ruler of Kabul broke the treaty and forced Abd al-Rahman ibn Samura to march against him and recapture Kabul. The ruler of Kabul was taken captive and embraced Islam.\nThe invasion ended the principality of the Nezak Huns which had been established since 484 CE.\nSee also\n*Islamization of Iran\n*History of Arabs in Afghanistan\n*History of Iran\n*Military history of Iran\nNotes"
