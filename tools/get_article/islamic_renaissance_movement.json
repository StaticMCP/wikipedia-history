Jamiyat al-Nahda had been established in 1988 by Abdallah Djaballah, and he decided to form the MRI after the Islamic Salvation Front rejected calls for an Islamic alliance. Its foundation was also a response to the FIS claim to hold a monopoly on Islamist politics.\nIn the 1991 parliamentary elections the party received 2.2% of the vote, failing to win a seat. The 1997 elections saw its vote share increase to 8.7%, resulting in it winning 34 of the 231 seats. However, it received just 0.6% of the vote in the 2002 elections, reducing it to a single seat. It recovered in the 2007 elections, receiving 3.4% of the vote and winning five of the 389 seats.\nThe party contested the 2012 elections as part of the Islamist Green Algeria Alliance. The alliance received 6.2% of the vote, winning 49 seats, down from the combined 60 won in 2007.\nSee also\n* List of Islamic political parties\nReferences"
