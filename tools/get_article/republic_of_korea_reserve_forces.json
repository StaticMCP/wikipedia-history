During wartime, about 5 divisions would be formed under the Mobilization Reserves, and deployed to the war zone to provide support and regional stabilization. In the meantime, the Homeland Reserve would defend the homeland from any possible attacks from the enemy.\nHistory\nThe Homeland Reserve Force was established in April 1968 as part of a nationwide program to increase emergency defense capabilities in response to increased North Korean infiltration. In January 1968, a North Korean commando unit infiltrated Seoul and attacked the Blue House Presidential residence in an attempt to assassinate South Korean dictator Park Chung Hee.\nThat same month, two additional North Korean commando units launched attacks on towns on the Korean east coast in attempts to create an insurgency.\nCivil defense\nIn 1980 there were over 90,000 civil defense personnel in the country. By 1990 there were more than 3.5 million civil defense personnel in reserve. Their missions included air raid defense, search and rescue missions, building and road repair.\nMost of the units are now stationary since the threat of North Korean attacks are not increasingly present. However, some units still maintain active training duties, and can be spotted in military installations.\nEquipment\nSmall Arms\n* Daewoo K2\n* M16A1\n* M1 Garand(out of service)\n* M1 Carbine\n* M1911\n* Panzerfaust 3\n* Daewoo Precision Industries K3\n* M72 LAW\n* M60 machine gun\nVehicles\n* M113(Replaced by other armored vehicles)\n* M48A3K\n* K1 88-Tank\n* Raycolt KLTV\n* M35 series 2½-ton 6×6 cargo truck\n* T-80(for pre-active personnel only)\nSee also\n* Military reserve force\n* National Defense Corps incident\n* Republic of Korea Armed Forces\n* Republic Of Korea Civil Defense Corps\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  (In Korean)\n* [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/rok/hrf.htm Globalsecurity on Homeland Reserve Forces]\n* [http://www.fas.org/irp/world/rok/hrf.htm Federation of American Scientists on HRF]"
