It won the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction.\nSummary\nThe book provides an in-depth account of Central Intelligence Agency activity in Afghanistan from the time of the Soviet invasion to the aftermath of attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Coll particularly notes the interplay between the CIA and its counterpart in Pakistan, Inter-Services Intelligence, which used CIA and Saudi Arabian funding to build militant Mujahideen training camps along the Pakistan–Afghanistan border in an effort to create radicalized, militant fighters sourced from many Arab countries to attack the Soviet occupation. Invariably, as Coll shows, this decision had long-lasting effects on the region.\nExpanded edition and follow-up\n*\n*\nPenguin published a slightly expanded edition in 2005 that added the work of the 9/11 Commission.\nIn 2011, Coll announced a follow-up to Ghost Wars. When asked about a release date for the book, Coll said \"It will take a while. ... I'd like the second volume to hold up over time.\"\nAwards\nSteve Coll won the 2004 Lionel Gelber Prize for Ghost Wars. The work also received the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction.\nSee also\n*''Charlie Wilson's War: The Extraordinary Story of the Largest Covert Operation in History\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*[http://www.pritzkermilitary.org/whats_on/pritzker-military-presents/steve-coll-ghost-wars/ Steve Coll discusses Ghost Wars''] at the Pritzker Military Museum & Library"
