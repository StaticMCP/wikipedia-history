It is part of the Salem Metropolitan Statistical Area. Thirty square blocks of the oldest part of Independence form the National Register of Historic Places-listed Independence Historic District.\nThe population was 9,828 at the 2020 census.\nHistory\nIndependence was founded by pioneers who migrated from Independence, Missouri. Elvin A. Thorp arrived in the Independence area in 1845 and staked a claim north of Ash Creek in June of that year. He platted a small townsite that later became known as \"Thorp's Town of Independence\" or the \"Original Town of Independence\", now known as \"Old Town\". Thorp named the town for his eponymous hometown in Missouri, as well as in honor of Andrew Jackson's characteristic of \"Independence\".\nIn 1847, Henry Hill came across the plains looking for a level piece of ground on which to raise stock. On November 14, 1847, he found his location on the west bank of the Willamette River (south of Ash Street) and marked off his donation land claim, which was  square.  In 1867, after returning from the California gold mines, Hill platted  for a townsite, thereafter to be referred to as Henry Hill's Town of Independence. The city charter bill of February 26, 1885, incorporated E.A. Thorp's Independence and Henry Hill's Independence.  Henry Hill Elementary School was named in honor of the latter.\nFlood of 1861\nWhen the pioneers first arrived in Independence, the Kalapuya people, who had lived in the area for centuries, warned them about the dangers of flooding along the Willamette River. The Kalapuya had experienced devastating floods in the past, which had even swept away their horses.\nIn December 1861, a devastating flood struck Independence, wiping out the town's commercial district, farms, and livestock. The flood was the result of a prolonged period of rain that began in October and continued into November, compounded by snow accumulation in the Cascades. As temperatures rose in late November, the snow melted, leading to severe flooding by the first week of December.\nMrs. Cora Hubbard, in her book Early Settlement of Independence, states that during the flood \"a person could row a boat across Thorp’s entire Town of Independence.\" The flood destroyed much of the town's infrastructure, including warehouses, docks, and ferries along Water Street. A warehouse filled with wheat was also destroyed.\nAfter the waters receded, the residents of Independence, along with Henry Hill returning from the California Gold Mines, began considering the possibility of rebuilding the town on higher ground, just across Ash Creek. They came up with a plan to establish a new townsite on more stable land. In 1867, Hill made the decision to move forward with the plan, choosing a 40-acre plot of land that bordered the Willamette River south of Ash Creek to build his \"Henry Hill's Town of Independence\".\nEconomic History and Transportation Development\nIndependence thrived as a shipping point, by both rail and boat, for agricultural products and lumber until the 1950s. The city was known for its hops production from the 1890s through the 1940s, hosting a festival called the \"Hops Fiesta\" from the early 1930s to the mid-1950s.  When hop production began to decline in the early 1950s, the city's fortunes also began to decline.\nDowntown Independence was bypassed by major freeways in the 1960s, though the period saw an alternative form of transportation enabled by the construction of the Independence State Airport, which was dedicated on August 14, 1964.\nGeography\nIndependence is located at . According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which  is land and  is water. Ash Creek flows through Independence, where it meets the Willamette River.\nDemographics\n}}\n2010 census\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 8,590 people, 2,857 households, and 2,021 families residing in the city.
