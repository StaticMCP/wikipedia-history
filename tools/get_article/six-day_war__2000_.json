The war formed part of the wider Second Congo War (1998–2003).\nKisangani was also a scene of violence between Rwandan and Ugandan troops in August 1999 and 5 May 2000. However, the conflicts of June 2000 were the most lethal and seriously damaged a large part of the city, with more than 6,600 rounds fired.[http://www.lepotentiel.com/afficher_article.php?id_edition=&id_article=29525 Kisangani : commémoration du 6e anniversaire de la guerre de six jours], David Tshiala, Le Potentiel, 15 juin 2006.\nAccording to Justice et Libération, a human rights organisation based in Kisangani, the violence resulted in around 1,000 deaths and wounded at least 3,000, the majority of whom were civilians. An entire brigade was wiped out at Bangoka Airport and another was destroyed at Simsimi Airport and the Sotexki textile industry.\nIn culture\nThe 2020 documentary film \"Downstream to Kinshasa\" () by director Dieudo Hamadi centers on survivors of the Six-Day War, in which the victims travel to Kinshasa to seek compensation from the government.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110713182921/http://www.laconscience.com/article.php?id_article=6148 Kisangani : Guerre de six jours : Amnésie collective], Alex Engwete, 8 June 2007, on laconscience.com.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080704084052/http://act-intl.org/news/dt_nr_2000/dtdrc0300.html Working for hope], December 2000, ACT International\n* [https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/785089.stm Heavy fighting resumes in Kisangani], 10 June 2000, BBC."
