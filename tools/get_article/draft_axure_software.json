The company is best known for Axure RP, a prototyping application used by product managers, business analysts, and UX designers to create interactive wireframes and prototypes.\nHistory\nAxure Software Solutions was founded in 2002 and is headquartered in San Diego, California.. The company released its flagship product, Axure RP, in 2003. RP (short for Rapid Prototyping) was designed to enable UX professionals to create interactive prototypes without writing code. Over time, the application evolved to support advanced interaction design, adaptive views for responsive layouts, and documentation for specifications.\nIn 2018, Axure introduced Axure Cloud (previously Axure Share), a platform for hosting, sharing, and collaborating on prototypes and design documents. Axure Cloud expanded the company’s focus from desktop prototyping to team-based collaboration and feedback.\nProducts\nAxure RP\nAxure RP is a desktop application for Windows and macOS used to design wireframes and interactive prototypes.
