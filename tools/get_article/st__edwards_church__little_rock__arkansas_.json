Built in 1901, it is a handsome Gothic Revival structure, built out of brick with stone trim.  A pair of buttressed towers flank a central gabled section, with entrance in each of the three parts set in Gothic-arched openings.   A large rose window stands above the center entrance below the gable, where there is a narrow Gothic-arched louver.  Designed by Charles L. Thompson, it is the most academically formal example of the Gothic Revival in his portfolio of work.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Little Rock, Arkansas\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.saintedwards.net/ St. Edwards web site]"
