They are signed to WWE, where they perform on the Raw brand and are the current WWE Women's Tag Team Champions in their third reign. As part of the team, Asuka is a former one-time WWE Raw Women's Champion and had won the 2020 Women's Money in the Bank.\nThe team originally formed as faces in April 2019 with Paige as their manager before both of them turned heel and kicked Paige out in October of the same year. Asuka and Sane amicably split up in July 2020 when the latter left WWE to return to Japan. Sane returned to WWE in November 2023 at Crown Jewel and the pair immediately reunited.\nHistory\nFormation and championship reigns (2019–2020)\nWWE Women's Tag Team Champions (2019–2020)\nAfter spending some weeks away to promote the movie Fighting with My Family, retired WWE wrestler Paige made a backstage appearance on the April 9, 2019, episode of SmackDown, where she announced that she would be bringing a new tag team to the SmackDown women's division to feud with The IIconics (Billie Kay and Peyton Royce) for the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship. A week later, Paige introduced the newly formed team of Asuka and Kairi Sane, dubbed \"The Kabuki Warriors\", who subsequently made their debut as a team by teaming with Bayley and Ember Moon to defeat The IIconics and the team of Mandy Rose and Sonya Deville. Kabuki Warriors would then pick up wins over local wrestlers on the April 30 episode of SmackDown and the team of Rose and Deville on the May 14 SmackDown, before beginning a feud with The IIconics over the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship throughout the summer. After defeating The IIconics at live events in Tokyo on June 28, The Kabuki Warriors received an opportunity against The IIconics for the tag team championship on the July 16 episode of SmackDown which they won by count out; however, The IIconics retained as titles do not change hands by count out unless stipulated.\nOn the August 5 episode of Raw, The Kabuki Warriors participated in a fatal four-way tag team elimination match for the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship but were the last ones eliminated by Alexa Bliss and Nikki Cross. They unsuccessfully challenged Bliss and Cross for the titles on the August 12 episode of Raw. The Kabuki Warriors received another title shot against Bliss and Cross at the Hell in a Cell event, where The Kabuki Warriors won the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship, after Asuka used green mist on Cross, thus showing signs of a villainous turn. The Kabuki Warriors were then drafted to the Raw brand on the October 14 episode of Raw. They solidified their status as villains on the October 28 episode of Raw by turning on their manager Paige when Asuka spat mist into Paige's face and thus ending their association with her.\nThe Kabuki Warriors retained the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship against Dakota Kai and Tegan Nox on the October 30 episode of NXT and Becky Lynch and Charlotte Flair on the November 11 episode of Raw. At Survivor Series, The Kabuki Warriors represented Raw in the 5-on-5-on-5 women's Survivor Series match against Team SmackDown and Team NXT, which Team NXT won. During the match, Asuka turned on her teammate Flair by spitting green mist on her, causing Flair to get eliminated, which led to The Kabuki Warriors beginning a feud with Lynch and Flair. They successfully defended the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship against Lynch and Flair, Alexa Bliss and Nikki Cross, and Bayley and Sasha Banks in a fatal four-way match at Starrcade. The Kabuki Warriors continued their feud with Lynch and Flair, which led to them defending the titles against Lynch and Flair in the namesake main event of the TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs event, which Kabuki Warriors retained. This led to Asuka entering a feud with Lynch in 2020 over the latter's Raw Women's Championship, which Asuka failed to win in subsequent matches at the Royal Rumble and the February 10 episode of Raw.\nThe Kabuki Warriors would then begin feuding with Alexa Bliss and Nikki Cross, which led to a match between the two teams at WrestleMania 36, where The Kabuki Warriors lost the titles back to Bliss and Cross. They unsuccessfully challenged Bliss and Cross for the titles in a rematch on the April 10 episode of SmackDown.\nAsuka's Raw Women's Championship reign and disbandment (2020)\nOn the April 13, 2020 episode of Raw, Asuka defeated Ruby Riott to qualify for the women's Money in the Bank ladder match while Kairi Sane lost to Nia Jax in a qualifying match. Asuka went on to win the match at the namesake event, thus winning the women's Money in the Bank contract which allowed her to cash in for a future title shot at the time and place of her choosing. The following night on Raw, however, Asuka was awarded the Raw Women's Championship by former champion Becky Lynch, who gave the title to Asuka due to her pregnancy, which led to Asuka embracing Lynch and it resulted in The Kabuki Warriors turning into fan favorites.\nAs the Raw Women's Champion, Asuka became the second Women's Grand Slam winner and the third Women's Triple Crown winner. The Kabuki Warriors then began feuding with Sasha Banks and Bayley as Banks and Asuka fought to a no contest at The Horror Show at Extreme Rules after Bayley interfered and counted the pinfall for Banks though Banks was not recognized as champion. On the July 27 episode of Raw, Sane was viciously attacked by Bayley backstage during the Raw Women's Championship match between Asuka and Sasha Banks which led to Asuka running to the backstage area where she was counted out and lost the title. This was done to write Sane out of the storylines as she announced her departure from WWE on Twitter as she was heading back to Japan to be with her husband, effectively disbanding The Kabuki Warriors.\nReunion (2023–current)\nDamage CTRL (2023–2025)\n(from left to right: Dakota Kai, Kairi Sane, and Asuka) at WrestleMania XL.]]\nSane returned to WWE at Crown Jewel on November 4, 2023, and assisted Iyo Sky in retaining her WWE Women's Championship, re-establishing herself as a heel. On the following episode of SmackDown, Sane forgave Bayley for her actions back in 2020 and joined Damage CTRL. Later that night, during a six-woman tag team match pitting Asuka with Bianca Belair and Charlotte Flair against Damage CTRL (Bayley, Sky, and Sane), Asuka turned on her teammates to reunite with Sane and Sky and subsequently joined Damage CTRL the following week. Damage CTRL faced the team of Belair, Flair, Shotzi and Becky Lynch in a WarGames match at Survivor Series: WarGames but were defeated after Lynch pinned Bayley. On the December 15 episode of SmackDown, Asuka and Sane defeated Michin and Zelina Vega in their first return tag team match as The Kabuki Warriors.\nOn the January 26, 2024 episode of SmackDown, The Kabuki Warriors defeated Katana Chance and Kayden Carter to become the new WWE Women's Tag Team Champions.

At Backlash France on May 4, The Kabuki Warriors lost the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship to the team of Bianca Belair and Jade Cargill, ending their second reign at 99 days. Asuka later revealed that she was suffering from knee injury for months and had successfully undergo surgery. On the December 16 episode of Raw, Sane was found attacked backstage that was meant to write her off due to a legitimate injury. Sane was supposed to participate in the tournament to crown the inaugural Women's Intercontinental Champion alongside fellow Damage CTRL member Dakota Kai and was replaced by Sky. Damage CTRL was silently disbanded in May 2025.\nReturn from injuries and Heel turn (2025–present)\nin 2025.]]\nSane returned from injury on the May 19 episode of Raw, where she participated in the triple threat match to qualify for the women's Money in the Bank ladder match, which was won by Rhea Ripley whereas Asuka returned from injury on the June 16 episode of Raw, where she won a fatal four-way first round qualifier of the Queen of the Ring tournament. Asuka made it to the tournament final at Night of Champions where she lost to Jade Cargill. On the July 7 episode of Raw, Asuka came to the aid of Sane from an attack by The Judgment Day (Raquel Rodriguez and Roxanne Perez). The Kabuki Warriors were subsequently scheduled to challenge for the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship held by Rodriguez and Perez in a fatal four-way tag team match at Evolution on July 13, where Rodriguez and Perez successfully retained their titles.\nIn August, tensions rise between Asuka and Sky, where the former contents that the latter should be accepting her help to win the Women's World Championship.
