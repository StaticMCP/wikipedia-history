The awards also honor the best work in all areas of film and video game marketing, including posters, television advertisements and other media, in 108 categories.\nIt has been called \"the Hollywood Awards show for the post-MTV era\"  and by its founders as celebrating \"the people who condense 120 minutes into a two-minute minor opus.\"\nOverview\nThe 1st Golden Trailer Awards ceremony was held on September 21, 1999, in New York and had 19 categories. This jury consisted of Quentin Tarantino, Stephen Woolley, United Artists executive Jeff Kleeman, and Miramax executive David Kaminow. The cofounders, sisters Evelyn Watters and Monica Brady, promoted their inaugural festival by screening the nominated trailers inside a gold-painted Airstream trailer at the 2000 Sundance festival.\nThe ceremonies moved to Los Angeles in 2002. Notable jurors in subsequent years have included Pedro Almodovar, Joel Siegel, Ben Stiller, Benicio Del Toro, Glenn Close, and Brett Ratner. Even as the ceremonies have expanded to include 108 categories (show and non-show), they have made a point of remaining short (at 70 minutes) — like the works they are recognizing. All editions have been broadcast online; more recent years have been televised on various networks including HDNet, ReelzChannel and Fox's MyNetworkTV.\nNotable additions to the award list include the \"Golden Fleece\" award, given to the trailer that gives a bad movie the most appeal. Executive Director Evelyn Watters describes it as celebrating the \"pure art of cutting\"; Executive Producer Monica Brady describes it as recognizing \"a great trailer for a movie that is not so great.\" It has also been called \"the most anticipated [award] of the evening.\"\nHosts for the awards ceremonies have included Kathy Griffin (2002), Dennis Miller (2003), Tom Green (2004), Sinbad (2008), Natasha Leggero (2011), TJ Miller (2015) and Wayne Brady (2016, 2017). The award was designed by artist Jim Bachor.\nThe 9th Annual Golden Trailer Awards (broadcast as the Movie Preview Awards on MyNetworkTV), in 2008 were at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles. The Dark Knight won three awards: Best Action, Best Summer Blockbuster Poster and Trailer of the Year in the public vote held by USA Today.\nThe 19th annual awards ceremony was held on May 31, 2018, at the Theater at Ace Hotel in Los Angeles. Michelle Buteau was host and master of ceremonies, and the presenters included Kate Flannery, Lea DeLaria, Yvette Nicole Brown, Nicole Sullivan and Missi Pyle. Paul Dergarabedian of comScore presented the Box Office Weekend Award (The Bow) to Avengers: Infinity War for the highest three day gross between May 1, 2017, and April 30, 2018.\n1999\nThe 1st Golden Trailer Awards were held in 1999, the winners were:\n* Best Action: The Matrix\n* Best Animation/Family: ''A Bug's Life\n* Best Art Commerce: The Matrix\n* Best Comedy: Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\n* Best Documentary: Return with Honor\n* Best Drama: Good Will Hunting\n* Best Edit: The Matrix\n* Best Foreign: Three Seasons\n* Best Horror/Thriller: The Blair Witch Project\n* Best Music: Out of Sight\n* Best Romance: Great Expectations\n* Best Trailer – No Budget: For Return of the Masterminds\n* Best Voice Over: The Blair Witch Project\n* Best of Show: The Matrix\n* Best of the Decade: Se7en\n* Most Original: Run Lola Run\n* The Dark and Stormy Night: 8MM\n* Trashiest: Cruel Intentions\n* Golden Fleece: 8MM\n2000s\nNote: no ceremony was held for the year 2000.\n2001\nThe 2nd Golden Trailer Award ceremony was held in 2001, winners are listed as follows:\n* Best Action: Gone in Sixty Seconds tied with Vertical Limit\n* Best Animation/Family: Chicken Run\n* Best Art and Commerce: Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\n* Best Comedy: Best in Show\n* Best Documentary: Running on the Sun: The Badwater 135\n* Best Drama: Gladiator (for the teaser)\n* Best Foreign: Billy Elliot\n* Best Horror/Thriller: Unbreakable (for the teaser #1)\n* Best Music: Almost Famous\n* Best Romance: Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (for the trailer)\n* Best Trailer – No Budget: The Big Split\n* Best Trailer – No Movie: \"AKA\"\n* Best Voice Over: Valentine\n* Best of Show: Requiem for a Dream\n* Most Original: Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\n* The Dark and Stormy Night: Hollow Man\n* Trashiest: A Table for One\n* Best Title Sequence: Bedazzled\n* Golden Fleece: Hollow Man\n2002\nThe 3rd Golden Trailer Award ceremony was held in 2002, the winners were:\n* Best Action: A Knight's Tale\n* Best Animation/Family: Monsters, Inc.\n* Best Comedy: The Royal Tenenbaums\n* Best Documentary: Go Tigers!\n* Best Drama: Memento\n* Best Foreign: Amelie\n* Best Independent: Series 7: The Contenders (for the redband trailer)\n* Best Music: The Royal Tenenbaums\n* Best Romance: Moulin Rouge!
