      "text": "# Battle of Vinland (1003)\n\n}}\nThe First Battle of Vindland was the first ever recorded battle in North America which occurred between Norse settlers and Native Americans in modern-day Newfoundland, Canada.\nThe battle began when an Indigenous group (called skraelings by the Vikings) were startled by a bull that escaped a Norse encampment, causing them to flee. Three weeks after, the natives returned with large numbers of warriors who attacked the Norse settlement. The Norse lead by Thorvald Ericksson, retreated to a rocky outcrop, where they were forced to fight back and eventually won with only losing 2 people (Including Ericksson), while the natives suffered many casualties. Despite the Norse military victory, there leader had been killed and they knew it wasn't possible to make a peaceful settlement in Vinland, causing many Nordic settlers to return to Greenland."
