The systematic development of the area started under the Nizamshahi of Ahmadnagar. The area was named Murtazabad after the sultan ruling at that time.\nIn 1728, the Peshwa ruler, Bajirao I moved his administration from nearby Saswad to Pune, and in the process, laid the foundation for turning Pune into a large city. Before Bajirao I made Pune his headquarters, the town already had six \"Peths\" or wards, namely, Kasba, Shaniwar, Raviwar, Somwar, Mangalwar, and Budhwar. Bajirao also started construction of a palace called Shaniwar Wada on the eastern bank of the Mutha River and at the northern end of shaniwar peth. The construction was completed in 1730, ushering in the era of Peshwa control over the city.\nMany senior officials of the Maratha empire built their own residence in Shaniwar Peth close to Shanwar Wada.\nBusinesses and Amenities\n]]\nShaniwar is primarily a residential locality but has pockets of commercial activities.
