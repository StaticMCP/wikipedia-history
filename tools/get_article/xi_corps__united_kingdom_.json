It was recreated as part of Home Forces defending the United Kingdom during the Second World War.\nFirst World War\nWestern Front\nXI Corps was formed in France on 29 August 1915 under Lieutenant-General Richard Haking. Its first serious engagement (as part of the First Army, Sir Charles Monro) was the Battle of Fromelles (19 July 1916), a diversion to the Somme offensive in which two untried divisions were launched into an ill-planned subsidiary attack in Flanders. It achieved nothing but cost thousands of casualties and caused great resentment in Australia.\n;Order of Battle at Fromelles\nGeneral Officer Commanding Lieutenant-General Richard Haking\n* 61st (2nd South Midland) Division\n* 5th Australian Division\nItalian Front\nXI Corps was one of two corps HQs moved to the Italian Front in November 1917.\n;Order of Battle in Italy 1 December 1917\nGOC Lieutenant-General Sir Richard Haking\nCorps Troops:\n* 1/1st King Edward's Horse\n* HQ Corps Heavy Artillery Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA)\n* 11th Cyclist Battalion Army Cyclist Corps\n* Corps Topographical Section Royal Engineers (RE)\n* Signal Troops RE (L Corps Signal Company; 27 (Motor) Airline Section; R and LC Cable Sections, *Corps Heavy Artillery Signal Section RGA)\n* Corps Siege Park Army Service Corps (ASC)\n* Corps Ammunition Park (345 (MT) Company (25 Ammunition Sub-Park) ASC)\n* 491 (MT) Company ASC, attached Corps Heavy Artillery\n* 5th (Light) Mobile Workshop Army Ordnance Corps (AOC)\n* Area Employment Company\n* Corps School\nReturn to the Western Front\nXI Corps returned to the Western Front in March 1918 in time to take part in the defence against the German spring offensive (the Battle of the Lys) and the final battles of the war as part of the Fifth Army (Sir William Birdwood).\nOrder of Battle 27 September 1918\nCorps Headquarters Command Staff\n* GOC Lt-Gen Sir Richard Haking\n* Brigadier-General, General Staff: Brig-Gen John Brind\n* Deputy Adjutant & Quartermaster-General: Brigadier-General Arthur Green\n* Assistant Director Ordnance Services, Lt Col Alfred Herbert, NZAOC\n* Commander, Royal Artillery: Brig-Gen S.F.
