In the , Clayfield had a population of 10,897 people.\nGeography\nClayfield is  by road from the Brisbane CBD. Clayfield is bordered to the north by Nundah, to the east by Ascot and Hendra, to the west by Wooloowin and to the south by Albion.\nIts name derives from the fine white-grey sedimentary clay mined in Albion, between Morgan and Sykes Street, used in the brickworks that once existed between Oriel Road and Reeve Street near Sandgate Road. This industry, once known as \"the clay fields\", was instrumental in the residential surge of European settlement of inner-north Brisbane.\nKalinga Park and the Kalinga locality lay on the northern limit. Clayfield also encompasses the locality of Eagle Junction.\nHistory\nIn 1874 a Baptist Church opened in Hendra/Clayfield.\nIn October 1885, \"Sefton Estate\" consisting of 254 16 perch allotments were auctioned by John Cameron, Auctioneer. The land for sale is re-subdivisions of subdivisions 2 to 3 of Portions 78 and 79, Parish of Toombul. A map advertising the auction provides a local sketch of the area.\nIn January 1886, 392 allotments of land of \"Noble Estate\", were advertised for auction by R.D. Graham & Son, Auctioneers. A map advertising the auction states the land is situated on the main Sandgate Road and Kedron Brook.\nIn February 1888, \"Isleton Estate\" made up of 236 allotments were auctioned by R. R. Cottell. A map advertising the auction states the Estate was exactly opposite Eagle Junction Railway Station with 30 trains passing a day.\nIn June 1888 \"The Eagle Farm and Sandgate Estate\", made up of 75 16 perch allotments, was advertised for auction by G.T. Bell, Auctioneer. The land for sale is re-subdivisions of subdivisions 13 to 25 of allotment 4 of Portion 5, Parish of Toombul. A map advertising the auction includes a local sketch of the area that shows close proximity to the railway line.\nA United Methodist Free Church was built circa 1889 at present-day 221 Bonney Avenue (). In 1901, not wishing to be part of the amalgamation of the Methodist denominations into the new Methodist Church of Australasia, the congregation decided to become Eagle Junction Congregational Church. In December, a Sunday School hall was added to the northern side of the church on the corner of Norman Parade.\nClayfield State School opened on 8 July 1895. In July 1901 it was renamed Eagle Junction State School.\nOn 28 October 1899, sixty allotments of land of \"Albion Hill Estate\", being re-subdivisions 1 to 60, of subdivision of section 3 of portion 162, Parish of Enoggera, were advertised for auction by Isles, Love & Co. The advertising map states the estate's proximity to Albion Train Station, with 76 trains daily. The land for sale was situated between Camden St, Albion, and Ford St and Old Sandgate Rd (now Bonney Ave), Clayfield.\nA stump-capping ceremony for Wooloowin Methodist Church was held on Saturday 30 November 1901. The site was on Old Sandgate Road at the junction with Bayview Terrace (now 170 Bonney Avenue). While the church was being built, it was destroyed by a cyclone in January 1901. The church was re-built and opened on Sunday 13 April 1902 by Reverend Robert Stewart, President of the Queensland Methodist Conference. In 1975 Wooloowin Methodist Church amalgamated with Eagle Junction Congregational Church (at 211 Bonney Avenue) to form the Bonney Avenue Cooperative Parish. Following the amalgamation that created the Uniting Church in Australia in 1977, it was renamed Clayfield Uniting Church and decided to operate exclusively from the site of the Wooloowin Methodist Church. The Eagle Junction Congregational Church and its adjacent hall at 5 Norman Parade were sold into private ownership; both buildings still exist and are listed on the Brisbane Heritage Register. The foundation stone of the current Clayfield Uniting Church building was laid on Sunday 2 March 1986 by Reverend Leslie Tiplin Vickery and it was opened and dedicated on 5 April 1987 by Reverend Barry Dangerfield.\nIn February 1920 ,\"The Drane Estate\", made up of 71/2 allotments plus a substantial residence on 2 1/2 allotments, was advertised for auction by Thorpe & Sharp, Auctioneers. A map advertising the auction states the estate is overlooking Clayfoeld Station, 6 minutes from Eagle Junction Railway Station and 3 minutes from Clayfield Tram Terminus.\nIn April 1920, \"Insulae Park Estate\" made up of 23 allotments was advertised for auction by Thorpe & Son, Auctioneers.
