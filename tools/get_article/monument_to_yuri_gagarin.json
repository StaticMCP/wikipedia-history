It is located at Leninsky Prospekt in Moscow. The pedestal is designed to be reminiscent of a rocket exhaust. The statue is made of titanium, a metal often used in spacecraft, and weighs 12 tons.\nDescription\nThe monument to Yuri Gagarin was built for the 1980 Olympic Games. It stands in Gagarin Square on Leninsky Avenue. The creators of the monument are the sculptor Pavel Bondarenko, architects Yakov Belopolsky, F.M. Gazhevsky, and designer A.F. Sudakov. The monument is made of titanium and mounted on a high ribbed pedestal. The total height of the monument is , the total weight is 12 tons. At the foot of the monument is a copy of the Vostok descent vehicle, which was flown on April 12, 1961, when Yuri Gagarin made the first crewed flight into space.\nThe statue creators turned to the specialists at the All-Russian Institute Of Aviation Materials (VIAM) for help, who recommended the sculpture use the titanium casting alloy VT5L, which has a shiny surface and acceptable color. In addition, specialists at VIAM developed technical processes used by VSMPO to cast ingots of VT5L alloy with a low oxygen content (0.12%).\nThe monument was made in less than a year at the Balashikha Foundry and Mechanical Plant. The titanium sculpture of Yuri Gagarin was assembled from 238 cast segments, which were connected with bolts and welding. The greatest problems arose with the manufacture of the largest segment – the cosmonaut's face. Its weight was , which was too heavy for melting in a vacuum oven. The Monument to Yuri Gagarin is the world's first large-scale monument made of titanium.\nThe figure of Gagarin is facing upward. The high ribbed pedestal is an important part of the composition and symbolizes the launch of the space rocket. The inscription at the base of the monument reads (in Russian):\nCommemorative coin\nThe monument to Yuri Gagarin is depicted on the reverse side of a non-circulating 1 oz silver 3 rouble coin. This coin was minted in 1991 to honor the 30th anniversary of human spaceflight.  An image of the monument is depicted on the back side of the coin, along with the words (in Russian) \"30 years of human spaceflight\".\nRestoration 2024\nIn 2024 the monument was restored. The restoration is carried out under the supervision of specialists from the Department of Cultural Heritage of Moscow, as the monument is an object of cultural heritage.\nWorks such as cleaning the stylobate from dirt and paint stains, replacing destroyed cladding blocks and slabs, and waxing stones were carried out. The monument was cleaned of dirt, corrosion, and all titanium plates were washed.\nSee also\n* Statue of Yuri Gagarin, Greenwich\n* Monument to the Conquerors of Space\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
