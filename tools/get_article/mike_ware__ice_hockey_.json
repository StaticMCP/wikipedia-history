At the end of his rookie season with the Steelhawks, he was selected by the Edmonton Oilers, 62nd overall in the\n1985 NHL Entry Draft. He played a second season in Hamilton, before moving to the Cornwall Royals. Following his season in Eastern Ontario he turned professional.\nWare signed with the Oilers AHL affiliate Nova Scotia Oilers where he registered 253 PIM and 8 points as a rookie during the 1987-88 season. The farm team relocated within the province and became the Cape Breton Oilers. Ware remained with the team, but also played two games in the NHL, making his debut in January 1989 in a game against the Los Angeles Kings, where early in his first (and only) shift of the night, he fought Jay Miller. In his next game against the Vancouver Canucks, Ware registered his only point in the NHL, an assist on a Miroslav Fryčer goal. Whilst playing for the affiliate team, his production increased, tallying 12 points and 317 PIM whilst in Cape Breton. For the 1989-90 season, Ware primarily played in Cape Breton, whilst also playing 3 games in NHL. Ware returned to Nova Scotia for the 1990-91 season, registering 12 points and  176 PIM in 43 games. During his time in Cape Breton, Ware received a 20-game suspension for breaking his stick over the glass, and subsequently throwing it at a referee.\nFor the 1991-92 season, Ware moved to the U.K. to play for the Murrayfield Racers of the British Hockey League. In Edinburgh he had a stellar season, scoring 60 points in 33 games, whilst also accruing 218 PIM. The team finished 2nd in the league, before being beaten 9-0 in the playoff semifinals to eventual champions the Cardiff Devils. Ware returned to the Racers for the following season, again increasing his scoring output, with 71 points in 43 games; the team finished mid-table and didn't make it out the group stages during the playoffs. The team changed its name to the Edinburgh Racers for the 1994-95 season, which saw Ware have a career year, with 79 points in 40 games, and the Racers reached the playoff final, ultimately losing to the Sheffield Steelers. The following season, Ware remained in the BHL, but moved to the Cardiff Devils, beginning his association with the club. The Devils had a strong season, finishing 2nd in the league, but they crashed out in the group stages of the playoffs.\nFollowing the culmination of the 1995-96 season, the BHL folded, and the BISL took its place as the top tier of hockey in the U.K., of which Cardiff was a founding member. Ware remained with the team and was named captain. In the maiden BISL season, The Devils were named league champions, however, they lost in the play semifinals to eventual winners Sheffield Steelers. Ware subsequently joined the Steelers in the off-season, but the team struggled, thanks in no small part to the Ayr Scottish Eagles completing the British Grand Slam. For the 1998-99 season, Ware moved to Germany, to play for DEL side Hannover Scorpions. There, Ware managed only 6 points in 44 games, whilst registering 103 PIM. Ware returned to the U.K. the following season, signing for the London Knights. With the Knights, Ware totalled 8 points and 90 PIM in 26 games, as the Knights were crowned British champions after beating the Newcastle Riverkings 7-3 in the playoff final.\nWare returned to the Devils for the 2000-01 season, where he registered 10 points and 155 PIM in 40 games. The team performed well, finishing 2nd in the league, however, they didn't make it past the group stages in the playoffs.  At the end of the season the Cardiff Devils went into voluntary liquidation, and as a result, were stripped of their BISL franchise. The team eventually reformed and participated in the British National League, which was at the time the second tier of ice hockey in the UK.  As a result, Ware moved back to the London Knights for the following season, linking up with former Devils teammates Ian MacIntyre, Kim Ahlroos, Steve Thornton and Vezio Sacratini. The team struggled, finishing 6th out of 7 teams, with Ware producing only 6 points and 33 PIM in 35 games.\nThe Terminator, as he was known to fans, returned to the Welsh capital for the third time and was named team captain for the 2002-03 season. The Devils made it to the BNL finals, ultimately losing to the Coventry Blaze. Ware had a good season, tallying 32 points and 96 PIM in 30 games.\nFollowing the culmination of the 2002-03 season, the London Knights, as well as the Manchester Storm and Ayr Scottish Eagles all folded, whilst the Bracknell Bees dropped down the BNL. This resulted in the demise of the BISL. Cardiff was a founding member of the EIHL, which became the new top tier of hockey in the U.K., and as such Ware remained with the team for the inaugural EIHL season where he remained as team captain. During the season, the Devils awarded Ware a testimonial game as a result of his service with the team, and popularity with the fans. The team reached the playoff semifinals, before losing to the Sheffield Steelers, following which Ware retired from hockey.\nAwards and achievements\n* BISL League champion (1997)\n* British champion (2000)\nCareer statistics\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" |\n! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" |\n! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season\n! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" |\n! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs\n|- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n!
