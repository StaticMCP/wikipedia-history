Ben Haas hit .341 to lead the league, while pitcher Chick Brandom paced the circuit with 16 wins and 121 strikeouts.\nThe Kansas State League folded after the season, and the Coyotes moved to the Oklahoma–Arkansas–Kansas League and became known as the Independence Champs.

Brandom would end up winning the World Series with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1909.\nYear-by-year record\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Year !! Record !! Finish !!
