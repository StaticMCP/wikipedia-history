The play then opened on Broadway at the Morosco Theatre on December 8, 1958, and closed on March 21, 1959, running a total of 120 performances. The play was directed by Harold Clurman. For her performance, Maureen Stapleton was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play.\nThe New York Times said in their review \"If there was a little more time at the moment, it would be possible to express gratitude to all the actors and everyone else concerned, they deserve it.
