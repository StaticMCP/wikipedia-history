The victory was won by the liberal side.\nThe liberal brigadier, Manuel Garcia Pueblita, then commander of the division of Michoacán was near San Felipe del Progreso, when he was notified via military information that a conservative force was garrisoned in the town of Ixtlahuaca. He quickly led his troops to that town, arriving on 18 September 1858 at 10:00 hours. The battle ended at about 13:30 hours. Pueblita achieved victory and won the square. He retired to Tepetitlán with the Treasury, yielding the town to Benito Juárez.\nReferences"
