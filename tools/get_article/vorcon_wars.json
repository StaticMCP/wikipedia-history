It was published by Vorcon Games. John Nicholson of Vorcon Games created the game. The game shares some similarities with Starlord, but with added options. The game was computer moderated.\nSuper Vorcon Wars\nBy 1986, Vorcon Games published an updated version called Super Vorcon Wars while ran alongside the original game. It was \"a more complicated version which involves infectious diseases destroying food supplies, multi-commander player positions, more aggressive native Vorcons and other such wonders\" according to reviewer Brendon Kavanagh in Crash''.\nGameplay\n16 players vie for control of the planet Vorcon following its leader's death. Gameplay occurred on a hex map with over 1,000 hexes of varying types and resources. Players see their hex and 18 surrounding hexes per turn as they strive for expansion through combat and other means.\nReception\nTim Lewis and Williams McCarthy reviewed Vorcon Wars in the Spring 1984 issue of Flagship. They generally felt positively about the game, noting drawbacks in the lack of awareness outside of the hex maps provided per turn and the time needed at the outset to meet other players. In 1989, Vorcon Wars placed second in the non-fantasy wargames section of ''Flagship's Spring 1989 Award Winners (after Domination'').\nSee also\n* List of play-by-mail games\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*"
