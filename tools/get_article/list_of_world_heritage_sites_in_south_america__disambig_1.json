Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage.\nFor the purposes of this list South America is defined according to the United Nations geoscheme: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela. Some territories which are not independent countries are also included. These are the French territory of French Guiana, the British territories of the Falkland Islands and Guyana, the Norwegian territories of Bouvet Island and South Georgia and the Sandwich Islands\nThe World Heritage Committee may also specify that a site is endangered, citing \"conditions which threaten the very characteristics for which a property was inscribed on the World Heritage List.\"\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n! style=\"width:15%;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! scope=\"col\" | Location\n! scope=\"col\" | Criteria\n! scope=\"col\"| Areaha (acre)\n! scope=\"col\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Refs\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Atlantic Forest South-East Reserves\n|\n| BrazilParaná, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states,\n| Natural:(vii), (ix), (x)\n| ; buffer zone\n| align=\"center\" |1999\n| The site comprises some of the last remaining Atlantic Forests and shows a very high diversity with many rare and endemic species.
