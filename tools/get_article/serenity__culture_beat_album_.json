It includes the single \"Mr. Vain\", which topped the charts across Europe and Australia.\nBackground\nThe line-up of Culture Beat changed slightly from their previous album released two years earlier, with Tania Evans becoming the new singer, joining Jay Supreme who remained the rapper. A total of five singles were released from the album: \"Mr. Vain\", \"Got to Get It\", \"Anything\", \"World in Your Hands\" and \"Adelante\".\nThe album won the 1993 Echo award for Most Successful German Album Abroad which is the highest German music industry award. It went on to sell almost two million copies worldwide.\nCritical reception\nAllMusic editor William Cooper opined that \"Serenity is an okay listen, albeit a repetitious one. \"Got to Get It\" is a virtual rewrite of \"Mr. Vain\", and the beat-heavy tracks \"World in Your Hands\" and \"The Other Side of Me\" are unremarkable but competent and entertaining. Serenity may lack substance, but the album should please fans of pleasant, non-threatening dance music.\" James Muretich from Calgary Herald commented, \"Culture Beat has co-ruled the dance clubs with hit after hit after hit recently and Serenity gathers them together, including its recent \"Mr. Vain\" smash, adds some new tunes and, presto, it's dance party time. A tight, techno, soulful serving of dance grooves, raps and singing, Culture Beat easily ranks a notch above its beats-per-minute competitors.\" Alan Jones from Music Week wrote that \"Germany's latest hitmakers make their album debut, which simply proves the huge debt they owe to fellow countrymen Snap.\" He felt that \"there's little of distinction here with none of the tracks sounding likely to emulate the singles success of \"Mr. Vain\".\"\nTrack listing\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Serenity track listing\n! scope=\"col\"| #\n! scope=\"col\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\"| Length\n|-\n||1.\n|\"Serenity (Prolog)\"\n|2:16\n|-\n||2.\n|\"Mr. Vain\"\n|5:37\n|-\n||3.\n|\"Got to Get It\"\n|5:21\n|-\n||4.\n|\"World in Your Hands\"\n|5:33\n|-\n||5.\n|\"Adelante!\"\n|5:38\n|-\n||6.\n|\"Rocket to the Moon\"\n|5:47\n|-\n||7.\n|\"Anything\"\n|6:24\n|-\n||8.\n|\"Key to Your Heart\"\n|4:09\n|-\n||9.\n|\"The Other Side of Me\"\n|4:52\n|-\n||10.\n|\"The Hurt\"\n|4:15\n|-\n||11.\n|\"Mother Earth\"\n|6:11\n|-\n||12.\n|\"Serenity (Epilog)\"\n|7:51\n|-\n||13.\n|\"ID Tania\"\n|0:06\n|-\n||14.\n|\"ID Jay\"\n|0:09\n|}\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Weekly chart performance for Serenity\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1993–1994)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| European Albums (European Top 100 Albums)\n| 15\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Finnish Albums (Suomen virallinen lista)\n| 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | French Albums (SNEP)\n| 25\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 1993 year-end chart performance for Serenity\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1993)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| European Albums (European Top 100 Albums)\n| 59\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| German Albums (Offizielle Top 100)\n| 28\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Swiss Albums (Schweizer Hitparade)\n| 30\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 1994 year-end chart performance for Serenity\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1994)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australian Albums (ARIA)\n| 51\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Dutch Albums (Album Top 100)\n| 58\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| German Albums (Offizielle Top 100)\n| 66\n|}\nCertifications\n}}\nReferences"
