It overlaps with the 4th, 13th, 19th, and 21st districts of the Delaware House of Representatives.\nRecent election results\nDelaware Senators are elected to staggered four-year terms. Under normal circumstances, the 7th district holds elections in presidential years, except immediately after redistricting, when all seats are up for election regardless of usual cycle.\n2020\n}}\n2016\n2012\nFederal and statewide results\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! width=\"30\" | Year\n! width=\"60\" | Office\n! width=\"180\" | Results\n|-\n| 2020\n| President\n| align=\"right\"  | Biden 61.9 – 36.3%\n|-\n| 2016\n| President\n| align=\"right\"  | Clinton 55.3 – 39.1%\n|-\n| 2014\n| Senate\n| align=\"right\"  | Coons 59.7 – 37.6%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 2012\n| President\n| align=\"right\"  | Obama 63.7 – 34.6%\n|-\n| Senate\n| align=\"right\"  | Carper 71.2 – 24.5%\n|-\n| Governor\n| align=\"right\"  | Markell 74.1 – 23.6%\n|}\nReferences"
