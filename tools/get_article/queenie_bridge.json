Opened in 1954, it connects Bridge Street and Greenhill Road in the town's harbour area. It replaced a swing bridge which had stood on the site since 1850 and was built at a cost of £8,000. There has been a crossing at this point in the harbour since at least 1739.\nThe bridge's name is a play on Quinzie (the Scots version of the French word coin, which signifies a corner), the historic name of the area of town to the south of Port Henry, which was constructed in 1593. Quinzie was a causeway of boulders, covered only by spring tides, which linked the islands of Keith Inch and Greenhill to the mainland.\nReferences"
