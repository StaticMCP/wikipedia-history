He argues that the current cultural establishment is dominated by leftists and Jews, who use World War II and the Holocaust in order to ostracise important parts of the German cultural heritage.\nReception\nThe book gave rise to an infected debate in German newspapers, known as the \"Syberberg debate\", which lasted throughout the summer and autumn of 1990. The liberal press was highly critical of the book and Syberberg's opinions. Hellmuth Karasek of Der Spiegel reviewed the book under the heading \"Neo-Nazism\" and condemned both Syberberg as a person and his oeuvre in its entirety. In Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Werner Fuld described the essay as a \"frontal attack against democracy and art\".\nAlthough critical of the views presented in the book, Susan Sontag and other critics who in the past had praised Syberberg continued to defend his films as great and important works of art.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://arktos.com/product/on-the-fortunes-and-misfortunes-of-art-in-post-war-germany/ Presentation] at the English-language publisher's website"
