The British claim in Antarctica is shown in shaded blue.]]\nThe United Kingdom's exclusive economic zone is the fifth largest in the world at . It comprises the exclusive economic zones surrounding the United Kingdom, the Crown Dependencies, and the British Overseas Territories. The figure does not include the EEZ of the British Antarctic Territory.\nThe UK was late to establish an EEZ, relying on overlapping maritime zones for fisheries, pollution control, and energy matters. The Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 gave the powers to establish an EEZ, with the zone defined by the Exclusive Economic Zone Order 2013 which came into force on 31 March 2014.\nThe United Kingdom has not claimed an EEZ extending from Gibraltar or Akrotiri and Dhekelia.\nGeography\nhas territorial waters, it does not establish an EEZ by itself, instead falling within the EEZ of the rest of the UK.]]\nThe United Kingdom's EEZ in Europe is .

The UK negotiated individual borders of the EEZ with specific countries, bilaterally.  This was standardised and rationalised by the Order through explicit boundaries, uniform across all purposes.\nThe Order implements the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea(UNCLOS).\nThe Order is made under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009.\nThe boundaries defined in the Order has been used to analyse maritime and coastal energy projections, varying from renewable energy, blue hydrogen and petroleum. The boundaries defined in the Order have been used to analyse disruption at UK ports.\nIn 2014, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office published a map showing the differences between the boundaries described by the Exclusive Economic Zone Order 2013 and the boundaries described by the Continental Shelf (Designation of Areas) Order 2013.\nDisputes\n* The exclusive economic zones associated with the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are disputed by Argentina.\n* The EEZ of the Chagos Archipelago, also known as the British Indian Ocean Territory, is disputed by Mauritius, which considers the archipelago as a part of its territory. Sovereignty ceded to Mauritius.\n* Gibraltar is disputed by Spain.\n* Since the approval of Brexit in 2020 there have been disputes with the European Union about fishing rights in UK's territorial waters.\n* The area around the uninhabited island Rockall is also disputed.\nSee also\n* Geography of the United Kingdom\n* Exclusive economic zone of France\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://legacy.iho.int/mtg_docs/com_wg/ABLOS/ABLOS_Conf6/S9P3-P.pdf Does Ascension Island have an outer continental shelf?]"
