It is the sequel to Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021), the fourth mainline installment, and the fifth film overall in the Ghostbusters franchise. The film stars Paul Rudd, Carrie Coon, Finn Wolfhard, Mckenna Grace, Celeste O'Connor and Logan Kim reprising their roles from Afterlife, alongside Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts and William Atherton reprising their characters from the earlier films. Kumail Nanjiani, Patton Oswalt, Emily Alyn Lind and James Acaster also join the cast. Set three years after the events of Afterlife, It sees the veteran Ghostbusters returning to New York City and collaborating with their successors to save the world from a new ancient evil.\nFollowing the success of Afterlife, Sony Pictures announced the sequel in April 2022, with Reitman returning as director. Co-writer and executive producer Kenan later took over as director that December, with Reitman staying on as a co-writer and co-producer. That same month, Rudd, Coon, Grace, Wolfhard, O'Connor, Kim, Murray, Aykroyd, Hudson, Potts and Atherton were all confirmed to reprise their roles. New cast members including Nanjiani, Oswalt, Lind, and Acaster were announced in March 2023, with principal photography commencing that month and wrapping in June. Dario Marianelli was hired to compose the film's score, replacing Afterlife composer Rob Simonsen. As the first film in the Ghostbusters franchise to be released following the death of the franchise's co-creator and Jason Reitman's father Ivan Reitman, who posthumously receives credit as a producer alongside his son and Jason Blumenfeld, the film is dedicated to his memory and celebrates the 40th anniversary of Ghostbusters.\nGhostbusters: Frozen Empire had its world premiere at the AMC 13 Theater at Lincoln Square in New York City on March 14, 2024, and was released in the United States on March 22 by Columbia Pictures (via Sony Pictures Releasing). It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $202 million worldwide. A sequel is in development.\nPlot\nThree years after the events in Summerville, Oklahoma, Callie Spengler, her boyfriend Gary Grooberson, her children Trevor and Phoebe, and their friends Lucky Domingo and Podcast, relocate to New York City to aid Winston Zeddemore and Ray Stantz in re-establishing the Ghostbusters. After the group captures a ghost known as the Hell's Kitchen Sewer Dragon, Walter Peck, the Ghostbusters' long-time opponent and the city's mayor, threatens to close them down. To appease Peck, Callie removes Phoebe from the team for being underage. Upset, Phoebe plays chess in a nearby park, where she encounters and befriends Melody, a ghost of a teenage girl killed in a fire.\nRay and Podcast collect cursed objects for examination. Nadeem Razmaadi sells them a strange brass orb with ritual markings written in Mesopotamian Arabic. Ray determines it is an apotropaic trap due to copper alloys typically being used in rituals since the Bronze Age, believed to have spiritual conductivity.\nWhen Ray evaluates its psychokinetic energy levels, the orb emits broad-spectrum psionic energy. A cold wave travels from the orb to the Ghostbusters' firehouse headquarters and damages the ecto-containment unit, which is at near capacity. Winston takes the orb to his company's paranormal research and development center, run by Dr. Lars Pinfield. Using an experimental extraction device, he is unable to extract any orenda from it. The orb's captive psychically sabotages one of the center's ecto-confinements, allowing a ghost known as The Possessor to escape and hide in Podcast's equipment. To learn more, Lars joins Trevor and Lucky to see Nadeem, who reveals that his grandmother kept the orb hidden within a brass-lined chamber. Peter Venkman, brought in to help, discovers Nadeem has latent pyrokinesis.\nRay, accompanied by Phoebe and Podcast, visits Dr. Hubert Wartzki, a New York Public Library research librarian and anthropologist, who explains the orb was built over four thousand years ago in Southwest Asia by sorcerers known as the Firemasters to imprison Garraka, a demigod who sought to conquer humanity with endowment of \"Kusharit Umoti\", or the Death Chill, which can kill living creatures through fear alone. Nadeem's grandmother was of the lineage of the Firemasters, who prevented Garraka from escaping the orb in 1904 during a mock ritual conducted by members of the Manhattan Adventurers' Society, whom he froze to death. Garraka was confined in the orb due to being vulnerable to brass. This, combined with fire, and the removal of his horns trapped him within the orb.\nWhen the trio attempts to stop the escaped Possessor from stealing a phonographic recording of the club's ritual, Peck exploits Phoebe's involvement to shut down the Ghostbusters. After an argument with Gary and her mother, Phoebe runs away and takes Melody to Winston's research center. She uses his extraction equipment to project herself as a ghost for two minutes so the duo can physically interact.\nMelody reveals she had been secretly working with Garraka, who has offered her passage to the afterlife. By controlling Phoebe's disembodied spirit, Garraka forces her physical body to recite the ritual chant. He then escapes, recovers his removed horns at Nadeem's residence and begins freezing the city. Realizing Garraka will free the ghosts in the containment unit after freeing ones at the center, the Ghostbusters gather to defend their headquarters. They are aided by Nadeem, who dons the Firemaster brass armor kept by his grandmother and attempts to master his powers.\nGarraka overpowers them and breaches the containment unit. Phoebe electroplates Egon Spengler's proton pack with brass to strengthen it; Melody atones for her misdeeds by helping Nadeem utilize his powers to weaken Garraka. Ray, with help from his fellow veteran Ghostbusters (including Janine Melnitz), captures Garraka by turning the ruptured containment unit into a giant ghost trap. A passage is opened for Melody, and she reconciles with Phoebe before departing for the afterlife to reunite with her family. As the city thaws, the Ghostbusters are hailed as heroes again, with Peck forced to support the team and reinstate Phoebe. The Ghostbusters begin pursuing escaped ghosts, including the Sewer Dragon and Slimer across New York City.\nCast\n* Celeste O'Connor as Lucky Domingo\n* Logan Kim as Podcast\n* Emily Alyn Lind as Melody\n* James Acaster as Dr. Lars Pinfield\n* Bill Murray as Dr. Peter Venkman\n* Dan Aykroyd as Dr. Raymond \"Ray\" Stantz\n* Ernie Hudson as Dr. Winston Zeddemore\n* Annie Potts as Janine Melnitz\n* William Atherton as Mayor Walter Peck}}\nAdditionally, Kevin Mangold and Ian Whyte serve as the puppeteers for Slimer and Garraka, respectively, though the latter's voice performers were uncredited.

It was also announced that Paul Rudd, Finn Wolfhard and Carrie Coon would return. In March 2023, it was announced that Kumail Nanjiani, Patton Oswalt, James Acaster and Emily Alyn Lind had been cast in the film. Lind's role was established in secrecy during pre-production. She met Reitman, Kenan, and casting director John Papsidera, and was not aware that she had the role until shortly before filming.\nAccording to Nanjiani, the filmmakers drew inspiration from the animated series The Real Ghostbusters (1986–1991), noting they \"wanted to make a long episode of the animated series\".\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on March 20, 2023, in London, Winnersh Film Studios, and Shinfield Studios, under the working title Firehouse, with Eric Steelberg serving as the cinematographer. On April 25, 2023, Hudson indicated that Aykroyd, Murray and Potts would reprise their roles from previous Ghostbusters movies in the film; Aykroyd confirmed he would return for the sequel in June 2023.\nFilming was spotted in New York City, where Casey Neistat was caught filming a stunt scene in a video posted on June 7, 2023, while documenting the effects of the 2023 Canadian wildfires in New York City. Filming wrapped on June 23.\nMusic\nOn January 18, 2024, Dario Marianelli was confirmed to compose the film's score, replacing Afterlife composer Rob Simonsen.

He recorded his score on the Barbra Streisand Scoring Stage in the John Williams Music Building on the Sony Pictures Studios lot in Culver City. The original film's composer Elmer Bernstein's son, Peter Bernstein, returned as score consultant, after doing so for Afterlife. In addition to using some of the elder Bernstein's original scores on some of the film's scenes, the song \"Ghostbusters\", which was performed by Ray Parker Jr., is heard during the film's end credits. Other songs \"Home on the Range\", arranged by Kenan and Reitman, \"Melano\" by Caino x Jun R.O.T., and \"Love Is Strange\" by Mickey & Sylvia are used in the film.\nOn March 7, 2024, Japanese girl group Atarashii Gakko! released a track called \"Ghostbusters: Frozen Summer\" as a collaboration with Sony Pictures Entertainment Japan.\nRelease\nTheatrical\nGhostbusters: Frozen Empire was scheduled to be released on December 20, 2023, but was delayed due to the SAG-AFTRA strike and rescheduled for March 29, 2024 (taking over the original release date of Sony Pictures Animation's Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse). The film had its world premiere in New York City on March 14, 2024, and was released by Sony Pictures Releasing on March 22, 2024.\nHome media\nIn April 2021, Sony signed deals with Netflix and Disney for the rights to their 2022 to 2026 film slate, following the film's theatrical and home media windows. Netflix signed for exclusive \"pay 1 window\" streaming rights, which is typically an 18-month window, and included Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire and past Ghostbusters films. Disney signed for \"pay 2 windows\" rights for the films, which would be streamed on Disney+ and/or Hulu as well as broadcast on Disney's linear television networks.\nGhostbusters: Frozen Empire was released digitally on May 7, 2024, and on 4K Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on June 25, 2024.\nReception\nBox office\nGhostbusters: Frozen Empire grossed $113.4&nbsp;million in the United States and Canada and $88.6&nbsp;million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $202&nbsp;million.\nIn the United States and Canada, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire was released alongside Immaculate and Late Night with the Devil, and was projected to gross $43–45 million from 4,345 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $16 million on its first day, including $4.7 million from Thursday night previews, slightly topping Afterlifes $4.5 million. It went on to debut at $45 million, landing between the opening weekends of Ghostbusters ($46 million in 2016) and Afterlife ($44 million in 2021), topping the box office, and pushing the Ghostbusters franchise past the $1 billion mark. Deadline Hollywood credited Sony's marketing efforts for boosting the opening weekend, but suggested that the franchise would perform better if it returned to the original movie's focus on \"wall-to-wall humor\" and \"big comedy stars.\" In its second weekend the film made $15.7 million (a drop of 65%), finishing second behind newcomer Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire. Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire finished in third place during its third weekend with $9 million (a drop of 42%).\nCritical response\nIt is the lowest-rated installment in the franchise on the site.  Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it an 80% overall positive score, with 64% saying they would recommend the film.\nJake Wilson of The Age gave it 2.5 out of 5 stars, writing, \"Aykroyd and Grace are the soul of the thing, to whatever degree a soul exists. At this point, Aykroyd has shed any pretense of ironic distance, emerging as the mournful weirdo he surely always was.\" CNN's Brian Lowry called it \"a very busy movie that lacks the emotional hook of its predecessor while spending too much time on the wrong characters in a way that yields a rather lifeless, chilly affair.\"\nRichard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three out of four stars, writing that it \"carries the same endearingly goofy, science-nerd spirit of the first film and delivers a delightful balance of slimy ghost stuff, sharp one-liners, terrific VFX and a steady stream of callbacks to various characters, human and otherwise, from the 1984 movie.\" Jake Coyle of the Associated Press gave it 2.5 out of 4 stars, saying that it was \"A significant upgrade from Afterlife\" and \"a breezier, more serviceable sequel that has a modest charm as an '80-tinged family adventure.\"\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders col6center\"\n|+\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" | Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| Favorite Movie\n| Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n| Favorite Movie Actor\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" | Saturn Awards\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n| Best Fantasy Film\n| Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire\n|\n| rowspan=\"4\"|\n|-\n| Best Film Costume Design\n| Alex Fortes & Ruth Myers\n|\n|-\n| Best Film Music\n|\n|\n|-\n| Best Younger Performer in a Film\n|\n|\n|}\nFuture\nIn February 2024, Kenan revealed that ideas for multiple future films in the Ghostbusters franchise had been discussed.
