Voters chose four representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nMissouri voted for the Democratic Party candidate, Andrew Jackson, over the National Republican candidate, Henry Clay. Jackson won Missouri by a margin of 30.33%. It is frequently reported that Jackson's popular vote win was unanimous, having received 5,159 or 5,192 votes. However, this was likely a reference to Jackson's plurality over Clay that was confounded with his total vote.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1832 United States presidential election in Missouri\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic\n| Andrew Jackson (incumbent)\n| align=\"right\" | 8,904\n| align=\"right\" | 65.16%\n| align=\"right\" | 4\n|-\n!  width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | National Republican\n| Henry Clay\n| align=\"right\" | 4,760\n| align=\"right\" | 34.84%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Totals\n| align=\"right\" | 13,664\n| align=\"right\" | 100.0%\n| align=\"right\" | 4\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Missouri\nReferences"
