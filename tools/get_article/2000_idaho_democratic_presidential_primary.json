The Idaho primary was an open primary, allowing voting of any registration to participate, and awarded 23 delegates towards the 2000 Democratic National Convention, of whom 18 were pledged delegates allocated, but not on the basis of the primary results. The Idaho caucus earlier in the year was the binding contest, where as the primary was simply a preference vote.\nVice president Al Gore and Lyndon LaRouche Jr. were the only candidates on the ballot, and Gore won the primary with almost 75% of the vote, but did not receive any delegates, as he had already won the caucus in March.\nProcedure\nIdaho was one of three states, along with Arkansas and Kentucky that held primaries on May 23, 2000, one week after the Oregon primary.\nVoting took place throughout the state from 8:00&nbsp;a.m. until 8:00&nbsp;p.m. local time.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;float:none;padding:5px;\"\n! colspan=\"2\"| Pledged nationalconvention delegates\n|-\n!
