It was agreed and signed in the French settlement of Puducherry in French India. The favoured British candidate Mohamed Ali Khan Walajan was recognized as the Nawab of the Carnatic. Despite intending to be a lasting solution, a Third Carnatic War broke out just two years later in 1756.\nSee also\n* France in the Seven Years War\n* Great Britain in the Seven Years' War\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Keay, John.
