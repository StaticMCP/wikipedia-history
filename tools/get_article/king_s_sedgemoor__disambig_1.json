It is adjacent to the Greylake SSSI.\nKing's Sedgemoor Drain, originally constructed in 1797-8, proved inadequate for draining the village of Chedzoy's moors, so in 1861 the Chedzoy Internal Drainage District built a small pumping station on the River Parrett, in Westonzoyland parish, to drain the Chedzoy moors southwards.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060519072134/http://www.bopcris.ac.uk/bop1700/ref14693.html 1771 Parliamentary summary on petitions for/against drainage]\n*[http://www.somerset.gov.uk/celebratingsomerset/angling/ Angling in Somerset - guide to King's Sedgmoor Drain]\n*[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/image.aspx?compid=15100&filename=fig04.gif&pubid=62 Map - Inclosure of King's Sedgemoor 1795]"
