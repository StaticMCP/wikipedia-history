The game is primarily set in the Ancient and Medieval time periods of European and Middle Eastern History. There are also plans to expand the game to include the Renaissance and Napoleonic Wars. Each new setting will have its own rules system and set of companion books.\nA game engine built by Slitherine was used on the TV series Deadliest Warrior''.\nMilitary Applications\nA number of Slitherine's games have been used for the purposes of military application. Matrix Games the arm of Slitherine who specialise in such applications lists, The US Air Force, [dstl], US Marine Corps, US Navy, Luftwaffe, Boeing, BAE Systems, and Lockheed Martin as the organisations Slitherine works with to develop wargames. In 2015 Slitherine collaberated with BAE Systems for Command: Modern Air/Naval Operations to be used for their purposes. In 2016 Slitherine's developers were invited to the Pentagon to demonstrate how their Command series could be used to simulate a number of potential scenarios. In an interview with People Make Games, a representative of the company claimed that the Pentagon was getting greater utility from Slitherine's games than their own internally produced wargames.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://www.mobygames.com/company/3775/slitherine-ltd/ Slitherine Ltd.] at MobyGames"
