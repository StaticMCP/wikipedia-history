According to the 2001 census it had a population of 1,168, reducing to 1,098 in 2011 but increasing to 1,288 in 2021.\nHistory\nThe parish church of All Saints is mostly of the 13th century, though the exterior is apparently 15th century. The west tower has buttresses, battlements, gargoyles and pinnacles. There is a north chancel chapel and sedilia. It is a Grade II* listed building.\nA tower windmill was built some time prior to 1840 to the north of the village (). The tower was straight-sided. In 1841 the mill had 2 pairs of millstones driven by 4 common sails, described as \"self-regulating cloth and rollers to the sails\". By 1850 the mill had been fitted with a pair of patent sails, retaining one pair of rollers; these drove 3 pairs of millstones.\nAlthough an independent parish, it still shares a parish council with neighbouring Saundby.\nBeckingham Marshes\nBeckingham Marshes is a RSPB nature reserve. Nearby there is a crude oil and gas production field run by IGas Energy. The wells in the field were fracked using the older less controversial technique.\nSee also\n* Listed buildings in Beckingham, Nottinghamshire\n* East Midlands Oil Province\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.beckingham-northnotts.org.uk Beckingham Village information site]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuIPn_pvZNM YouTube video - parish visit journal]"
