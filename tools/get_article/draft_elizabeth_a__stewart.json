Dr. Stewart is also known for her research and contributions and research of uterine fibroids. She is a Harvard Alumna from the Class of 1985, and her currently practice is at the Mayo Clinic. There she is a Fellowship Director for the Reproductive Endocrinology program.\nEducation\nDr. Stewart is an alumna of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. She holds a Bachelor of Arts in Molecular Biology, having graduated Magna Cum Laude. Dr. Stewart is also an alumna of Harvard Medical School. Having graduated Harvard Medical School, Dr. Stewart started her medical career with an Internship for Obstetrics and Gynecology at Magee Women's Hospital of the University of Pittsburg. Following her internship, she also completed her residency at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital of Harvard Medical School. After her residency, she completed a fellowship at Brigham and Women's Hospital of Harvard Medical School for Reproductive Endocrinology. She had also completed a fellowship for the Laboratory of Naji Abumrad, MD in the Diabetes Center of the Vanderbilt School of Medicine. She is an advocate for quality of life impacts for women with reproductive issues and the LGBTQ+ community.\nMedical Career\nCurrently, Dr. Stewart is employed at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. She is known well for her studies of Uterine Fibroids, adenomyosis, and infertility. She has participated in over 200 medical studies and clinical trials since starting her professional career in 1989. Her first publication, A controlled trial of intrauterine insemination for cervical factor and male factor: a preliminary report was coauthored with three other researchers in May 1989 in the International Journal of Infertility. Her studies of Uterine Fibroids around 1990, partially due to the lack of research on women's health. The founding of advocacy groups such as Society of Women's Health Research would help bring attention to the disparity of women's health. Dr. Stewart'a first study of Uterine Fibroids would not be until 2004, which specifically focused on African American women who have a greater risk of developing them. This study was impactful since African American women only made up around 15% of studies. Her other publications include other medical research, cultural barriers, and discrimination towards minority women seeking treatment.\nIn 2014, she published a study calling the disproportionate impacts of uterine fibroids among African-American women a public health issue in American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. In that same year, she was appointed clinical leader for Comparing Options for Management: Patient-Centered Results for Uterine Fibroids (COMPARE-UF), a joint project by Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). She was tasked with creating a registry to track uterine fibroid registry and the effectiveness of treatment, both short and long term, from women of all demographics. During this time, she was responsible for nine clinics across the United States, and the study was concluded in 2018. The results were published in 2018 in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology and consisted of over 1,000 women.\nIn 2023, the Mayo Clinic was awarded a $7.5 million grant because of her studies for COMPARE-UF to construct a new center named Collaboration for Equity in Uterine Leiomyomas Center, in which Dr. Stewart will lead. The grant was awarded by Eunice Kennedy Shiver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health (NIH).\nPublications\nDr. Stewart is the author of two books, both related to her studies. Her first publication came in 2007, with the release of Uterine Fibroids: The Complete Guide (A Johns Hopkins Press Health Book). This book The book is a comprehensive guide for women impacted by uterine fibroids and discusses alternative, less invasive treatments for the condition, other than a hysterectomy, which had been the standard treatment.\nHer second publication came in 2018 with the release of Mayo Clinic Guide to Fertility and Conception, that was co-authored by Dr. Jani R. Jensen who is a reproductive endocrinologist at Mayo Clinic. This publication is a collection of experiences of families who have struggled with fertility and offers medical and lifestyle advice for conceiving and throughout pregnancy.\nAwards\n- Roy M.
