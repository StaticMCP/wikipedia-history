An archery duel by champions on both sides preceded general fighting, which included several celebrated instances of single combat. Victory went to the Minamoto.  However, Yoshinaka's old retainer, Saito Sanemori, was a casualty.\nSee also\n* Sanemori (Noh play)\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Battle of shinohara\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Shinohara"
