      "text": "# Timeline of the 2025 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 2025 Pacific hurricane season is the current tropical cyclone season in the Pacific Ocean east of the International Date Line (IDL) in the Northern Hemisphere. It officially began on May&nbsp;15 in the eastern Pacific (east of 140°W), and on June&nbsp;1 in the central Pacific (from the IDL east to 140°W); it will end in both on November&nbsp;30. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most tropical cyclogenesis occurs in these regions of the Pacific. The season's first system, Tropical Storm Alvin, developed on May&nbsp;28.\nThis timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It includes information that was not released throughout the season, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not initially warned upon, has been included.\nBy convention, meteorologists use one time zone when issuing forecasts and making observations: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and also use the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight&nbsp;UTC). Tropical cyclone advisories in the Eastern North Pacific basin use both UTC&nbsp;and the nautical time zone where the center of the tropical cyclone is currently located. Time zones utilized (east to west) are: Central, Mountain, Pacific and Hawaii. In this timeline, all information is listed by UTC first, with the respective regional time zone included in parentheses. Additionally, figures for maximum sustained winds and position estimates are rounded to the nearest 5&nbsp;units (knots, miles, or kilometers), following National Hurricane Center practice. Direct wind observations are rounded to the nearest whole number. Atmospheric pressures are listed to the nearest millibar and nearest hundredth of an inch of mercury.\n__TOC__\nTimeline\nMay\nMay 15\n* The Eastern Pacific hurricane season officially begins.\nMay
