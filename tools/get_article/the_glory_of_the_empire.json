It is written as a history book about a fictional ancient empire. The book was awarded the 1971 Grand Prix du roman de l'Académie française.\nWilliam Beauchamp of The New York Times described the book as a satire that \"undermines important assumptions of the reigning ideology: that history is objective; narratives, neutral; that language transmits pre‐existing truth\", and wrote that Ormesson's status in the French establishment contributes to making the book subversive.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.nyrb.com/products/the-glory-of-the-empire NYRB]\n* [https://www.gallimard.fr/catalogue/la-gloire-de-l-empire/9782070280353 Gallimard]"
