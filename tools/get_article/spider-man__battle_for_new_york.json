It was released for the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS on November 14, 2006. The game features Spider-Man and the Green Goblin as the main characters and is a re-imagining of their first encounter within the Ultimate universe. Battle for New York features the Green Goblin as a playable character. The cutscenes in the game are drawn by Marvel Comics artist Ron Lim.\nPlot\nAfter finding out Spider-Man's true identity and how he gained his super powers, Norman Osborn tries to recreate the process on himself, thinking that his superior knowledge and access to his ‘Oz Formula’ would get a better result. He then turns himself into the Green Goblin (with a few side effects). Thinking his experiment to be a success, he then starts to use his formula on other people, creating a goblin army. It's now up to Spider-Man to figure out what's going on and put a stop to the Goblin's plans before he can take over New York City.\nSpider-Man ultimately thwarts the Goblin, who is then incarcerated by The Ultimates (the Ultimate Universe variants of The Avengers).\nGameplay\nPeter Parker/Spider-Man is the eponymous protagonist. Spidey's game play is almost identical to that of its predecessor, whereby he has to go around and save any civilians that are in trouble, engage in combat with thugs and (in the Nintendo DS version) take part in 3 touch screen mini-games: The stroke game, the web draw and the arm/disarm games.\nNorman Osborn/Green Goblin is the main antagonist and a playable character. Green Goblin's game play is slightly different. Unlike Venom who could be controlled via the touch screen, the Goblin is controlled with the d-pad and face buttons only. His game play involves destroying objects and fighting security guards and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. The Goblin does not take part in any touch screen mini-games.\nExclusive to the DS version, both Spider-Man and Goblin have access to 4 special moves which appear on the bottom screen, landing hits on opponents increases a special meter that, once full, will allow them to use one of the 4 moves available.\nThe player will also have to keep an eye out for the Threat Assessment Meter (or TAM for short); when it appears, it will point towards where Spidey and Goblin have to go next and also tell the player how much time they have left to solve the problem. If they fail to sort out the problem when the TAM meter runs out, the player will receive a game over.\nMusic\nOriginal music for the game was composed by Finn Robertson. It also reused Kevin Manthei's music from the previous Ultimate Spider-Man game in its cutscenes.\nReception\n(GBA) 41/100\n| 1UP = C+\n| GSpot = (DS) 7/10(GBA) 4/10\n| GameZone = 7.5/10\n| IGN = 4.5/10\n| NP = 6/10\n| NWR = 6.5/10\n}}\nSpider-Man: Battle for New York received \"mixed or average\" for the DS version and \"generally unfavorable\" reviews for the GBA according to review aggregator Metacritic.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
