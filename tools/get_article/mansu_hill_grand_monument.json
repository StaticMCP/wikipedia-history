There are 229 figures in all, commemorating the history of the revolutionary struggle of the Korean people, and especially their leaders. The central part of the monument consists of two  bronze statues of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il.\nHistory\nIn April 1972, Kim Jong Il erected the monument in honor of Kim Il Sung's 60th birthday. The monument features the Great Leader alone overlooking Pyongyang. Five years later, the statue was covered in gold leaf. Soon after, this gold plating was removed after a visit from Deng Xiaoping, who, after seeing the monument, expressed displeasure with how Chinese aid was being spent.\nFollowing Kim Jong Il's death in 2011, a similar statue of him was erected on the north side of Kim Il Sung. At the same time, Kim Il Sung's statue was altered to portray him at a later age and smiling. Kim Il Sung's original Mao suit was also replaced with a Western-style suit. The statue of Kim Jong Il initially featured a long coat but it was promptly changed to his signature parka. South Korean sources have estimated the cost of the additional statue at $10 million, with North Korean workers working overseas being ordered to donate $150 each towards the monument.\nDaily NK reported that satellite images showed construction activity (cranes and canopy) around the statues from late April until early June of 2024. According to Daily NK, construction activity included: cleaning, polishing, painting, plating, rust removal, upgrading the lightning rods, and upgrading the sound system which plays solemn music around the clock. They also reported that during the construction period, maintenance was also performed on a hydraulic elevator system in a tunnel under the statues.\nDescription\nBehind the central statues is a wall of the Korean Revolution Museum building, displaying a mosaic mural showing a scene from Mount Paektu, considered to be the sacred mountain of revolution. On either side of the statues, leading away from the building, are two monuments consisting of statues of different soldiers, workers, and farmers in their anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle and socialist revolution. The long line of human figures depicted on them are on average  tall.\nAn official North Korean website describes it thus:\n}}\nAll visitors to the site, both locals and foreigners, are expected to bow to show respect. Locals are required to leave flowers in order to show respect and foreigners are also given the option. Photos of the statues are permitted, but the photos must capture the statues in their entirety. Close-up photos of any part of the leader's statues are strictly forbidden.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
