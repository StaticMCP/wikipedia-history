The work does not record his name, but states that he was the progenitor of the first Serbian dynasty, known in historiography as the Vlastimirović dynasty.\nHistorians have variously referenced this person as 'unknown archon' or 'unnamed Serbian archon' (), with the title of archon usually translated as a ruler or prince or knez.\nAccording to De Administrando Imperio, this ruler died before the arrival of the Bulgars on the Balkans (680), succeeded by his line of descendants.\nDe Administrando Imperio\n(It should be known) that the country of the Terbounians and the Kanalites is one. The inhabitants are descended from the unbaptized Serbs, from that archon who refuged to the Emperor Heraclius from unbaptized Serbia, until the time of Vlastimer archon of Serbia.}}\nStudies\nAccording to the accounts in DAI the first Christianization of the Serbs should be dated to 632–638; this could be interpreted at first glance as Porphyrogenitus' invention, or might have actually taken place, encompassing a limited group of chiefs and then very poorly received by the wider layers of the tribe. In early historical assessment like that of German historian Ludwig Albrecht Gebhardi (1735–1802), the Serb archon was a son of Dervan, who was the Duke (dux) of the Surbi, east of the Saale. Francis Dvornik (1962) and Relja Novaković (1977) argued the possibility that they were brothers or other relatives.\nIn contemporary historiography and archaeology, the narratives of De Administrando Imperio have been reassessed as they contain anachronisms and factual mistakes. The account in DAI about the Serbs mentions that they requested from the Byzantine commander of present-day Belgrade to settle in the theme of Thessalonica, which was formed ca. 150 years after the reign of Heraclius which was in the 7th century. For the purposes of its narrative, the DAI formulates a mistaken etymology of the Serbian ethnonym which it derives from Latin servi (serfs).\nAs the Byzantine Empire sought to establish its hegemony towards the Serbs, the narrative of the DAI sought to establish a historical hegemony over the Serbs by claiming that their arrival, settlement and conversion to Christianity was the direct result of the Byzantine interference in the centuries which preceded the writing of DAI. D. Dzino (2010) considers that the story of the migration from White Serbia after the invitation of Heraclius as a means of explanation of the settlement of the Serbs is a form of rationalization of the social and cultural change which the Balkans had undergone via the misinterpretation of historical events placed in late antiquity.\nSee also\n* List of Serbian monarchs\n* Anonym\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n*\n* |year=1962|publisher=The Athlone Press, University of London|title=De Administrando Imperio: Volume II Commentary |url=https://archive.org/details/dli.ernet.168258 |location=London |isbn=9780884020219}}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n|name=Unnamed Prince of Serbia}}\n610–641}}"
