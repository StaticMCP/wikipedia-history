It was published on February 1, 1999. It marks the first appearance of the Turbo Toilet 2000, the Talking Toilets, and the Incredible Robo-Plunger, as well as George and Harold's nerdy tattletale nemesis Melvin Sneedly.\nPlot\nWith Jerome Horwitz Elementary School holding its Invention Convention, George Beard and Harold Hutchins are forced by Mr. Krupp to stay in study hall all day due to them glueing everyone to their seats the previous year. While getting ready to secretly sabotage everyone's inventions, the two boys run into Melvin Sneedly, working late on his invention, a photocopier that can turn a picture of something into a real being. George and Harold promise not to sabotage it, as long as he doesn't report them. The convention soon has to be called off, and Melvin breaks his promise on purpose and tattles after Krupp is left confused.\nAn infuriated Krupp puts them on detention for the rest of the school year, threatening them with suspension if they leave their detention once. George and Harold get assigned writing lines for two hours after school. With each boy using a quick line-writing device, they write all their lines in three-and-a-half minutes, then makes a Underpants comic. However, the copy machine is surrounded by teachers, so they copy off of Melvin's machine, but  the talking toilets come to life. While fleeing, George and Harold are caught by Krupp and suspended. The boys try to explain what happened in the gym, but he tells them to go home, anyway. All the teachers celebrate in the gym, but Mr. Meaner, the gym teacher, is promptly eaten by one of the toilets. Ms. Ribble then snaps her fingers at a toilet, making Krupp turn into Underpants. George and Harold chase him as he takes several pairs of underwear from unsuspecting clotheslines.\nBack at school, the trio finds only Ribble on the toilet table. The trio slings chipped beef with his underwear, and the Toilets vomit all the teachers out and die. Soon after, the Turbo Toilet 2000 bursts out of the school and despite Underpants's efforts, is  swallowed whole. The boys sneak in to Melvin's machine to make a super-powered robot called the Incredible Robo-Plunger, which plunges into the Turbo's mouth, letting the boys save Krupp. He fears that he will be fired for the damages, but the Robo-Plunger repairs all of it, and flies off to Uranus with the command never to return. In return, Krupp cancels their detention and as the principals, the boys hold an all-day carnival for the students and put the teachers (and Melvin) in detention. At the end of the day, Krupp questions how the carnival will be paid for; the boys reveal they sold his antique furniture, as well as all the furniture in the teacher's lounge. Krupp is outraged, and Miss Anthrope snaps her fingers after the boys, making Krupp become Underpants again.\nTitle change\nEarly versions of the book say \"Another Epic Novel by Dav Pilkey\" instead of \"The Second Epic Novel by Dav Pilkey\".\nSee also\n* The Adventures of Captain Underpants, the first Captain Underpants novel that Dav Pilkey made in 1997.\n* Captain Underpants and the Invasion of the Incredibly Naughty Cafeteria Ladies from Outer Space (and the Subsequent Assault of the Equally-Evil Lunchroom Zombie Nerds), the book that follows this one.\n*Children's literature\n*Dav Pilkey\n*Captain Underpants, the series Dav Pilkey made.\n* Captain Underpants and the Tyrannical Retaliation of the Turbo Toilet 2000\nReferences"
