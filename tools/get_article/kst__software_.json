It is a general purpose plotting software program that evolved out of a need to visualize and analyze astronomical data, but has also found subsequent use in the real time display of graphical information.  Kst is a KDE application and is freely available for anyone to download and use under the terms of the GPL.  It is noted for being able to graph real-time data acquisition.\nHistory\nKst was initially developed by Barth Netterfield, an astrophysicist as a personal project.  By 2004 it had begun to be used in various universities and the European Space Agency and development was funded by the Canadian Space Agency.  Kst is written in C++ and based upon (but does not use) the Tk toolkit.  It is targeted towards large (million element) data sets.\nFeatures\nkst is a fast real-time large-dataset plotting and viewing tool with basic data analysis functionality.\nPlot types\nkst is able to plot histograms and 3-D with color and contour mapping for 3-D images.  It is also able to process Network Common Data Form (NETCDF) files for 2-d plotting\nReal-time plotting capability\nKst has been chosen where there is a need to present plots in real-time.\nApplications\nReal-time applications vary in size from simple graphing of a sensor from a microcontroller such as arduino that may be set up by a hobbyist to a simple sensor to plotting of real time date from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope.  The program has been recommended for real time graphical display of an open energy monitoring project.\nInputs\nKst is able to accept a number input formats with Dirfiles being particularly suitable for streaming applications and plug-in extension filters enabling other input stream types and file formats to be added.\nScripting language\nThe tool offers a scripting language, termed KstScript based upon JavaScript syntax which can help automate workflows.\nAlternatives\nSome alternatives include MATLAB, Qtiplot, SciDAVis, Grace and LabPlot. However, some of these are part of a numerical analysis package.\nSpin-off developments\nDirfile format\nIn the process of developing the kst application a spin-off was the emergence of the Dirfile file format standard for time-ordered binary data in an efficient manner.  It was developed under the Getdata project into an independent standard with its own API.\n}}"
