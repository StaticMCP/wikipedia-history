However, the other USAAF support commands (Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); Air Transport Command (ATC) or Troop Carrier Command) commanded a significant number of airfields in support roles.\nIt is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, returned to agriculture, or retained as United States Air Force installations that served as front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor airfields\nSecond Air Force\n* Cut Bank Army Airfield, Cut Bank\n: II Fighter Command\n: Now: Cut Bank Municipal Airport\n* Glasgow Army Airfield, Glasgow\n: II Fighter Command\n: Now: Glasgow International Airport\n:: Note: Glasgow Air Force Base (1957-1976) is NOT the World War II Airfield.\n* Great Falls Army Airfield, Great Falls\n: 352d Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Was: Great Falls Air Force Base (1947-1955)\n: Now:  Malmstrom Air Force Base (1955–present; runway inactive since 1997, limited to rotary-wing ops)\n* Lewistown Army Airfield, Lewistown\n: II Bomber Command\n: Now: Lewistown Municipal Airport\nAir Transport Command\n* Gore Army Airfield, Great Falls\n: Joint use USAAF/Civil Airport\n: 7th Ferrying Group\n: 385th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Now: Great Falls International Airport\n: And:  Great Falls Air National Guard Base\n* Helena Army Airfield, Helena\n: Joint use USAAF/Civil Airport\n: Now: Helena Regional Airport\nReferences\n* Maurer, Maurer (1983).
