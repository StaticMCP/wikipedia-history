Growing to  tall by  broad, it is evergreen with arching fronds. The pinnae have curved, finely-toothed segments. The plant derives its common name from the linked sori on the undersides of the fronds.\nThe specific epithet radicans means \"with stems that take root\", referring to rooting plantlets appearing at the tips of the fronds.\nThis plant is cultivated as an ornamental, and in the UK has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Unlike its hardier cousin Woodwardia unigemmata, it is prone to frost damage and requires protection in colder areas.\nReferences"
