      "text": "# Oregon Battle of the Books\n\nOregon Battle of the Books (OBOB) is a trivia-style reading competition for students in the U.S. state of Oregon. Students in grades 3 to 12 compete against one another by answering a series of questions about a list of books they are given at the beginning of the year. The list is around 15 books long, and questions are asked of any of the books for that age division in the style of Jeopardy!, an American quiz show.\nThe preliminary tournament starts off in pool play style tournaments, then the next round is in the style of stepladder or bracket play. Students can choose to participate in the local, district, regional, and state level of the program.\nHistory\nThe Oregon Battle of the Books Committee is a volunteer-based group established in 2006 and supported by the Oregon Association of School Libraries (OASL). The idea was sparked by the Chicago Public Library, which had a radio show with a similar concept in the mid-20th century. In the 1970s, author Sybilla Cook introduced the idea in Oregon, but it was not until 2006 that it got funding from the State Library of Oregon.\nRegions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+OBOB Regions by County\n!Regions\n!Divisions 3-5\n!Divisions 6-8\n!Divisions 9-12\n|-\n|1\n|Clatsop\n|Clatsop\n|Clatsop\n|-\n|\n|Columbia\n|Columbia\n|Columbia\n|-\n|\n|Tillamook\n|Tillamook\n|Tillamook\n|-\n|\n|Washington\n|Washington\n|Washington\n|-\n|2\n|\n|Marion\n|Marion\n|-\n|\n|\n|Linn\n|Linn\n|-\n|\n|\n|Yamhill\n|Yamhill\n|-\n|\n|\n|Polk\n|Polk\n|-\n|\n|\n|Lincoln\n|Lincoln\n|-\n|\n|\n|Benton\n|Benton\n|-\n|2 East\n|Marion\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Linn\n|\n|\n|-\n|2 West\n|Yamhill\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Polk\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Lincoln\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Benton\n|\n|\n|-\n|3 North\n|Lane\n|Lane\n|Lane\n|-\n|3 South\n|Coos\n|Coos\n|Coos\n|-\n|\n|Douglas\n|Douglas\n|Douglas\n|-\n|4 North\n|Multnomah\n|Multnomah\n|Multnomah\n|-\n|\n|Hood River\n|Hood River\n|Hood River\n|-\n|4 South\n|Clackamas\n|Clackamas\n|Clackamas\n|-\n|\n|Wasco\n|Wasco\n|Wasco\n|-\n|5\n|Lake\n|Lake\n|Lake\n|-\n|\n|Klamath\n|Klamath\n|Klamath\n|-\n|\n|Jackson\n|Jackson\n|Jackson\n|-\n|\n|Josephine\n|Josephine\n|Josephine\n|-\n|\n|Curry\n|Curry\n|Curry\n|-\n|6\n|Sherman\n|Sherman\n|Sherman\n|-\n|\n|Gilliam\n|Gilliam\n|Gilliam\n|-\n|\n|Morrow\n|Morrow\n|Morrow\n|-\n|\n|Umatilla\n|Umatilla\n|Umatilla\n|-\n|\n|Union\n|Union\n|Union\n|-\n|\n|Wallowa\n|Wallowa\n|Wallowa\n|-\n|\n|Baker\n|Baker\n|Baker\n|-\n|\n|Malheur\n|Malheur\n|Malheur\n|-\n|7\n|Jefferson\n|Jefferson\n|Jefferson\n|-\n|\n|Deschutes\n|Deschutes\n|Deschutes\n|-\n|\n|Crook\n|Crook\n|Crook\n|-\n|\n|Wheeler\n|Wheeler\n|Wheeler\n|-\n|\n|Grant\n|Grant\n|Grant\n|-\n|\n|Harney\n|Harney\n|Harney\n|}\nControversy\nFor the 2018–19 school year, Alex Gino's book George (which has been published under the title Melissa since April 2022) was one of the 16 novels selected for students to read. It is a novel about a 10-year-old transgender girl who goes by the name of Melissa. It is a coming of age novel targeted for students aged 8 to 12. Despite all the praise the book received from its initial release, it was featured two years in a row on the American Library Association's list titled \"10 Most Challenged Books\" for years 2016 and 2017.\nTwo school districts, Hermiston School District and Cascade School District, both decided to drop from the competition. They claimed that the content of the book was too mature for the students but mentioned that it had nothing to do with transgender rights.\nSee also\n* List of libraries in Oregon\n* Oregon Department of Education\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
