      "text": "# The Partisan in War\n\nThe Partisan in War is a pamphlet written by the German soldier Andreas Emmerich (born 1739; also known as Colonel Andrew Emmerick).\nIt is a treatise on light infantry tactics learned in the Seven Years' War under Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick, and in the American Revolutionary War. Emmerich had commanded the British ''Emmerich's Chasseurs regiment during the Revolutionary War. The treatise was dedicated in 1789 to Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany; the same year it was first published in English in London.  Emmerich had joined the Danish army in 1788 and rose to the rank of lieutenant-general.  He was executed by occupying French Napoleonic forces in 1809 after leading an anti-French rising at Marburg.\nSee also\n*Partisan (military)\nExternal links\n*[http://www.loyalamericanregiment.org/The%20Partisan%20in%20War.pdf The Partisan in War'' complete text]\nReferences"
