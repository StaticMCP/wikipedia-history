The Byzantine had already arrived in Kayseri where the Seljuk army was approaching.\nBattle\nUpon learning of the 400 Franks' flight, Isaac briefly considered dispatching a troop under the command of his brother Alexios to hunt them down. However, word soon spread that a Seljuk force was on its way. Isaac traveled to the Cappadocian frontier to meet the Seljuks, leaving Alexios in charge of a small guard to watch over the Byzantine camp.\nIsaac attacked the Seljuks, however, the Byzantines were overwhelmed and ambushed by the large number of the Seljuks, many of his men were killed and taken prisoners. Isaac fell from his horse after attempting to stop his men from retreating only to be taken prisoner by the Seljuks.\nThe Seljuks then attacked the Byzantine camp. Alexios tried to raise to troops moral, only to find himself abandoned by his men and therefore forced to retreat. the Seljuks looted the camp and its baggage. Alexios retreated to Ankara.\nAftermath\nAt Ankara, Alexios learned about his brother's fate. Isaac managed to ransom himself along number of hostages and follow up with his brother at Ankara.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*"
