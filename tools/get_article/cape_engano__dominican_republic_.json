Cape Engaño contains dangerous reefs near Santo Domingo. Punta Cana International Airport, the nation's busiest, lies slightly south of the cape.\nIn 1502, a large part of a Spanish fleet of 30-32 ships filled with treasures and colonists and other men bound for Spain sunk during a violent storm, somewhere close to Cape Engaño. This fleet was sent by order of governor Nicolas Ovando. 5-10 ships, although damaged, survived and returned to the port of departure, except for only one, the \"Aguja\", which safely reached Spain.\nClimate\n| source 2 = NOAA\n}}\nSee also\n}}\n* Lists of lighthouses and lightvessels\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Cape Engano (Dominican Republic)\n\n#REDIRECT Cape Engaño (Dominican Republic)"
