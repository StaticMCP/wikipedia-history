It has a varied program, divided between exhibitions, launching of publications, colloquiums, training sessions or study trips, also developing projects in partnership with counterparts from other European countries and hosting interns and foreign artists throughout the year.\nOn June 9, 1995, it was made Honorary Member of the Order of Infante D. Henrique, and on May 10, 2005, it was made Honorary Member of the Order of Liberty.\nThe CNC belongs to several international cultural networks and is the representative entity of Europa Nostra in Portugal.\nThe CNC's Board is chaired by Maria Calado, the Grand Council by Guilherme d'Oliveira Martis, and the General Assembly by Gonçalo Ribeiro Telles.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.cnc.pt/ CNC website]"
