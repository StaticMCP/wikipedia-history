There's a banknote printer with a gambling debt, revolutionaries with a counterfeiting plan, an armed robbery, a bomb, a touch of adultery and a speeding plane finale. Not one character rings true nor is one fragment of the storyline credible.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-great-armored-car-swindle-am239443 The Breaking Point at AllMovie]\n*"
