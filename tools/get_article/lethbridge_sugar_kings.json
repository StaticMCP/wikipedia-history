The team folded following the 1972–73 season with the forthcoming arrival of major junior hockey to Lethbridge. The team was saved by a different ownership group and renamed the Lethbridge Longhorns for the 1973–74 season, but lasted only two seasons due to competition with major junior hockey. The Lethbridge Broncos of the Western Hockey League arrived from Swift Current in 1974.\nSeason-by-season record\nNote: GP = games played, W = wins, L = losses, OTL = overtime losses, Pts = points, GF = goals for, GA = goals against, PIM = penalties in minutes\n{| style=\"width:40%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#dddddd\"\n! width=\"12%\" |Season\n! width=\"8%\" |GP\n! width=\"8%\" |W\n! width=\"8%\" |L\n! width=\"8%\" |OTL\n! width=\"8%\" |Pts\n! width=\"8%\" |GF\n! width=\"8%\" |GA\n! width=\"8%\" |PIM\n! width=\"9%\" |Finish\n! width=\"13%\" |Playoffs\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n| 1963–64 || &nbsp; ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n| 1964–65 || &nbsp; ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n| 1965–66 || &nbsp; ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n| 1966–67 || &nbsp; ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n| 1967–68 || &nbsp; ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n| 1968–69 || &nbsp; ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n| 1969–70 || &nbsp; ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n| 1970–71 || &nbsp; ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n| 1971–72 || &nbsp; ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n| 1972–73 || &nbsp; ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n|}\nSee also\n* List of ice hockey teams in Alberta\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.ajhl.ca Alberta Junior Hockey League]"
