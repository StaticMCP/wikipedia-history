His speech was followed by rapturous applause after concluding it with the official dedication stating, \"We now dedicate this site to the memory of brave men, loyalty, patriotism and honor.\"\nThe monument itself was dedicated on 30 May 1897 by surviving American Civil War veterans.  The monument was financed by monthly contributions from the pay of the officers and soldiers of the Regular Army.  The granite column, standing  tall and  in diameter, was quarried from Branford, Connecticut, and is reputed to be the largest column of polished granite in the Western Hemisphere.  Inscribed on bronze straps belting the eight monumental \"cannon balls\"  circling the column are the names of 2,230 Regular Army officers and soldiers who died for the Union during the Civil War.\nA female statue designed by Frederick MacMonnies sits atop the monument, representing Fame.  The statue that now tops the monument is actually the second version of the statue.  Just months after it was unveiled, MacMonnies agreed to replace the original statue after complaints that it was too large and awkward.\nTraditionally, the plebes at West Point made reference to the statue of Fame when giving the following reply to any upperclassman demanding to know \"How are they all?\":  \"They are all fickle but one, sir.\" \"Who is the one?\" \"She who stands atop Battle Monument, for she has been on the same shaft since 1897;\" however, this is no longer current practice.\nImage gallery\nImage:Battle Monument USMA in Winter.JPG|After heavy winter snow\nImage:Battle Monument Gettysburg Cannon.JPG|The cannons bear the names of major Civil War battles\nImage:Battle Monument's \"Fame\" at West Point.JPG|Statue of Fame atop the monument\nImage:Original_Statue_on_West_Point's_Battle_Monument.jpg|Original statue in 1897\nImage:Battle_Monument_(West_Point)_July_2009.JPG|Summer 2009\nSources\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&profile=all&source=~!siartinventories&uri=full=3100001~!344097~!0#focus Save Outdoor Sculptures!]\n* [http://www3.nd.edu/~archlib/Rare-Books/McKMW-Monograph-v1.pdf Photographs and architectural sketches of the Battle Monument] , Battle Monument plans on page 76."
