Ware's Quartet which was recorded in 1999 but not released on the Thirsty Ear label until 2006.\nReception\n| rev2 = PopMatters\n| rev2Score =\n|rev3 = The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings\n|rev3score  =\n}}\nIn his review for AllMusic, Thom Jurek states \"This is a gorgeous and moving recording, one that may show Ware's snobbish, academic detractors that it's time to shut up and listen, but it doesn't matter. What's here is a document of another of Ware's many facets as a leader, soloist, and composer. For the curious, it is also a solid introduction to the man and his work. This is the sound of tenderness and an open heart: come on in\". PopMatters observed \"This release contains more soul in a couple of randomly chosen seconds than most of today’s singers could muster in an entire career. You want to know the trick of it? David S. Ware ain’t fooling around here. He means every single moment of it\".\nThe All About Jazz review said \"Not just an exercise in restraint, BalladWare is a melancholy investigation of roads rarely traveled, and quite rich in simmering detailit seems that Ware is once again searching for some new musical plane that may be unknown but definitely makes the journey interesting\".\nTrack listing\nAll compositions by David S.
