She studied English at the University of Manchester, where she developed an interest with Old English and Middle English texts.\nBefore her writing career, Ware worked as a waitress, a bookseller and a publicist. She also spent time in Paris, teaching English as a foreign language.\nCareer\nWare’s novels include In a Dark, Dark Wood (2015), The Woman in Cabin 10 (2016), The Lying Game (2017), The Death of Mrs Westaway (2018), The Turn of the Key (2019), One by One (2020), The It Girl (2022), Zero Days (2023), One Perfect Couple (2024), and The Woman In Suite 11 (2025). Both In a Dark, Dark Wood and The Woman in Cabin 10 were on the UK's Sunday Times and The New York Times top ten bestseller lists.  She is represented by Eve White of the Eve White Literary Agency. She switched to the pen name Ruth Ware to distinguish her crime novels from the young-adult fantasy novels published under her birth name.\nWriting style\nIn her crime books, Ware's writing style is often compared to that of Agatha Christie. Ware has said that some aspects of her writing are directly inspired by Christie. Ware's protagonists are usually ordinary women who find themselves in dangerous situations involving a crime. The first two of Ware's novels feature a murder mystery with a group of people trapped, or otherwise restricted from immediately escaping the dangerous environment.  Christie was famously known for utilizing this plot device, in novels such as Murder on the Orient Express. Ware and Christie both choose settings and situations that foster the sense of dread that propels their characters to paranoia and often they react violently as a result. These environments create a sense of isolation for the events to unfold in. Ware's settings play a key role in drawing in the reader and are as essential and integral to her story as the characters.\nReception\nReviews of Ware's psychological crime thrillers have been generally positive.\nThe Independent named In A Dark, Dark Wood as \"this year's hottest crime novel\", and The Guardian praised its \"excellent characterisation\" and called the book's ending \"mesmerising\".\nIn a four-star review, The Independent described The Lying Game as \"gripping enough to be devoured in a single sitting,\" and Kirkus Reviews writer said \"cancel your plans for the weekend when you sit down with this book, because you won’t want to move until it’s over.\"\nBibliography\nYoung adult fiction\nBefore writing under the pen name Ruth Ware, she wrote five young-adult fantasy novels, all of which were published by Hodder's Children Books.\n* A Witch Alone (2013) 978-1444904710\n* A Witch in Winter (2013) 978-1444904697\n* A Witch in Love (2013) 978-1444904703\n* Witch Finder (2014) 978-1444914467\n* Witch Hunt (2014) 978-1444914481\nAs Ruth Ware\n* In a Dark, Dark Wood (2015) is about a woman who attends a bachelorette party (hen do) of a childhood friend whom she hasn't heard from in years.
