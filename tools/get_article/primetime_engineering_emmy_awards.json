The Primetime Engineering Emmys are presented by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (ATAS), while the separate Technology and Engineering Emmy Awards are given by its sister organization, the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS).\nThe Primetime Engineering Emmy is presented to an individual, company or organization for engineering developments so significant an improvement on existing methods or so innovative in nature that they materially affect the transmission, recording or reception of television. The award is determined by a jury of highly qualified, experienced engineers in the television industry. In addition, since 2003 the ATAS also bestows in most years the Philo T. Farnsworth Award, which is a Primetime Engineering Emmy Award given to honor companies and organizations that have significantly affected the state of television and broadcast engineering over a long period of time, and the Charles F. Jenkins Lifetime Achievement Award, which has been given in most years since 1991 to one or more individuals whose contributions over time have significantly affected the state of television technology and engineering.\nThe Primetime Emmy Awards have been given since 1949 to recognize outstanding achievements in primetime television for performance, for the Creative Arts, and for Engineering.  The Primetime Engineering Emmys have separately been given annually since 1978 (the year that ATAS and the NATAS agreed to split ties), although Special Emmys for Outstanding Achievement in Engineering Development were occasionally bestowed in prior years. The awards which have been given include the Engineering Emmys, which are accorded the Emmy Statuette, and two other levels of recognition, the Engineering Plaque, and the Engineering Citation\nAwards\n;1978\n*Engineering Emmy Award: Petro Vlahos for the ULTIMATTE Video-Matting Device\n*Engineering Citation: To the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE)\n;1979\n*Engineering Emmy Award: Ampex Corporation for the Automatic Scan Tracking System for Helical Video Tape Equipment\n*Engineering Citation: Magicam, Inc. for the Development of Real Time Tracking of Independent Scenes\n;1980\n*Engineering Emmy Award: National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), and American Broadcasting Company (ABC) for Closed Captioning for the Deaf System\n*Engineering Emmy Citation: David Bargan for the '409' and 'TRACE' Computer Programs used for Off-line Videotape Editing\n*Engineering Emmy Citation: Vital Industries for its Pioneering Development of Digital Video Manipulation Technology\n*Engineering Emmy Citation: Convergence Corporation for the ECS-100 Video Tape Editing Systems\n;1981\n*Engineering Emmy Award: Rank Cintel for the Mark III Flying Spot Telecine\n;1982\n*Engineering Emmy Award: Hal Collins for Contributions to the Art and Development of Videotape Editing (posthumous)\n*Engineering Emmy Award: Dubner Computer Systems, Inc., and the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) for the Dubner CBG-2 Electronic Character and Background Generator\n*Engineering Citation: Chapman Studio Equipment for the Development of Crane Systems\n;1983\n*Engineering Emmy Award: Eastman Kodak for the Development of High Speed Color Film 5294/7294 Color Negative Film\n*Engineering Citation: Ikegami Electronics for the Development of the EC-35 (a camera used for electronic cinematography)\n*Engineering Citation: Ampex Corporation for Digital Effects Displaying Capabilities with Improved Picture Quality\n;1984\n*Engineering Emmy Award: None given\n*Engineering Citation: Corporate Communications Consultants Inc. for the 60XL Color Correction by Armand Belmares Sarabia\n;1985\n*Engineering Emmy Award: Auricle Control Systems (ACS) for the Auricle Time Processor\n;1986\n*Engineering Emmy Award: Nagra, Inc., for the Nagra Recorder\n*Engineering Emmy Award: CBS, Sony and Cinedco for Design and Implementation of Electronic Editing Systems for Film Programs\n;1987\n*Engineering Emmy Award: Spectra Image, Inc. for D220 Dual Headed Video Disc Player\n;1988\n*Engineering Emmy Award: Optical Disc Corporation for the Recordable Laser Videodisc System\n*Engineering Emmy Award: Sony for the DVR-1000 Component Digital VTR\n;1989\n*Engineering Emmy Award: Pacific Video Inc. for the Electronic Laboratory\n*Engineering Emmy Award: Cinema Products Corporation for the Steadicam\n*Engineering Plaque: Composite Image Systems for the Pin Registered Transfer Process\n*Engineering Plaque: Istec, Inc. for the WESCAM Camera Mount\n*Engineering Plaque: Matthews Studio Electronics for the Nettman Cam-Remote\n*Engineering Plaque: Offbeat Systems for the Streamline Scoring System\n*Engineering Plaque: Steadi-Film Corporation for the Steadi-Film System\n*Engineering Plaque: UCLA Film and Television Archive for the restoration of the Fred Astaire Specials\n;1990\n*Engineering Emmy Award: Comark Communications, Inc. and Varian/Eimac for the Klystrode UHF High Power Amplifier Tube and Transmitter\n*Engineering Emmy Award: Zaxcom Video, Inc. for the TBC Control System\n*Engineering Plaque: Samuelson Alga Cinema for the Louma Camera Crane\n*Engineering Plaque: Alan Gordon Enterprises for Image 300 35mm High Speed Camera\n;1991\n*Engineering Emmy Award: Vari-Lite for the Series 200 Lighting System\n*Engineering Emmy Award: Camera Platforms International, Inc. for the D/ESAM Digital Mixer\n*Engineering Plaque: Manfred Klemme for the Dcode TS-1 Time Code Slate\n*Engineering Plaque: Lightmaker Company for the AC/DC HMI Ballast\n*Engineering Plaque: George Hill for Optex UK - Mini Image Intensifier for ENG Cameras\n*Engineering Plaque: Grass Valley Group for the Kadenza Digital Picture Processor\n*Charles F.
