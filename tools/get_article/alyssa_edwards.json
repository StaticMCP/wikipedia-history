Edwards was known for competing in drag pageantry (notably Miss Gay America 2010) before rising to international attention as a contestant on the fifth season of ''RuPaul's Drag Race, becoming a fan favorite during and after her time on the show. Edwards subsequently appeared on the second season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars and starred in her own web series, Alyssa's Secret. She won the first ever season of RuPaul's Drag Race Global All Stars, making her the first queen to be inducted into the \"Newly Constructed International Pavilion At the Drag Race Hall of Fame\".\nJohnson lives in Mesquite, Texas, where he owns and operates a dance studio, Beyond Belief Dance Company. Johnson and his dance studio are the centerpieces of a docuseries, Dancing Queen'', produced by RuPaul and World of Wonder that premiered on October 5, 2018, on Netflix.\nEarly life\nJustin Dwayne Lee Johnson was born on  January 16, 1980, to Jimmy Harold Johnson and Sherrie Ann Laye in Mesquite, Texas. He was one of seven children in the working-class family, and has described his mother as \"the wind beneath (his) wings\" and his father as \"very, very masculine.\" Growing up, Justin's sisters were cheerleaders, and he often found himself wishing he could join in on their practices. Described as a shy and creative child with no interest in sports, he enjoyed watching The Wizard of Oz and dancing and singing tunes such as Rod Stewart’s \"Forever Young\" in his front yard, to the discouragement of his father. Justin was supported by his openly gay Uncle Bobby, who supplied him with a role as an extra in a local production of Brigadoon and financed his enrollment in an all-boys jazz dance class at the Joy Sharp School of Dance in Mesquite, and was only allowed to attend when his father was informed that the son of a local baseball coach attended the class as well. Johnson’s parents divorced around the time he was in high school, when he attended West Mesquite High School and volunteered as an instructor and choreographer for the local peewee drill team. After high school, he attended Ranger College before transferring to the University of North Texas, where he was briefly a part of the college cheer squad and came out as gay. While at UNT, Justin made friends with fellow gay people and was taken to Oak Lawn, a neighborhood in Dallas that is commonly known as Dallas' \"gayborhood\". It was there, at the Rose Room lounge in the Village Station, where he saw his first drag show. Johnson began going to the Rose Room regularly, and performed in drag for the first time there for an amateur drag competition, where he utilized the makeup skills his sisters had taught him and slicked back his platinum blond hair \"like Annie Lennox\". When asked by the emcee for his drag name, Johnson chose \"Alyssa\", after Alyssa Milano, who he'd watched on ''Who's the Boss? while growing up. His surname, Edwards, was given to him later by his mentor and drag mother, Laken Edwards.\nCareer\nJohnson performs under the stage name Alyssa Edwards.

Where she was cast alongside Coco Montrese, who she had fallen out with over Edwards being unable to complete her run as Miss Gay America 2010 and being replaced by Montrese. The two's history led to many arguments and dramatic moments throughout the season. A ballet challenge win in the fourth episode gave Edwards immunity, saving her from being in the bottom two in the following episode after a negatively received Katy Perry snatch game performance, but RuPaul still asked Edwards to apologize to Perry on Twitter due to the performance. In episode 7, after Edwards performed weakly in a stand-up roast challenge she was placed in the bottom two alongside Roxxxy Andrews, where both would be allowed to stay in the competition after a strong lip-sync to “Whip My Hair” by Willow Smith. Edwards would fall in the bottom two for a second time in the following episode where she would send home Ivy Winters in a lip sync to Gwen Guthrie's “Ain't Nothin' Goin' On but the Rent”. Alyssa's time on the season would come to a finish in episode 9, where another poor challenge performance lead to a close lip sync to Paula Abdul's “Cold Hearted” against rival Coco Montrese, where Montrese emerged victorious and Edwards was eliminated in sixth place.\nAll Stars 2\nin 2017]]\nDue to positive fan reception, in 2016 it was announced that Alyssa Edwards had been cast on the second season of ''RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars''. The cast included four other queens from season 5, including her season 5 nemesis, Coco Montrese. However, upon Montrese's entrance, it is revealed that the pair had since reconciled. A solid performance in the episode 1 talent show meant that Edwards was safe, yet her former rival was less lucky as Roxxxy Andrews eliminated Montrese first. In episode 3, Edwards' strong performance as Annie Oakley in a \"rusical\" challenge placed her in the top 2 for her first time in the season against Detox, where Edwards would win the lip sync to Taylor Dayne's “Tell It to My Heart”  and chose to eliminate Ginger Minj over Katya. In the following episode, Edwards was eliminated by Alaska over Roxxxy Andrews and Katya.\nIn episode 5, eliminated queens were given a chance to re-enter the competition by pairing up with a queen who was still in the game. Edwards was paired with Alaska, and the pair were in the top 2 alongside Detox and the previously eliminated Tatianna. In a lip sync to Rihanna's “Shut Up and Drive,” both queens were allowed to re-enter the competition and eliminate one of the bottom two. Both chose to eliminate Phi Phi O'Hara. In the seventh episode, Edwards was controversially eliminated by Detox over Andrews and Alaska on the anniversary of her mother's death and one episode before the finale, a move which many saw as unfair as Detox, Alaska, and Andrews had a strong friendship and many thought that Edwards had not deserved to be in the bottom for the episode. Edwards finished in fifth place on All Stars 2.\nFilmography\nFilm\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Title\n!
