Six incidents of heavy fighting and bombing took place from November 2020 to August 2021 during the Tigray War.\nNovember 2020\nFrom 25 to 27 November 2020, the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) and Eritrean Defence Forces (EDF) killed 8 civilians in Hawzen (Eastern Tigray). In the wake of the battles, they organised a killing spree that spread towards the nearby small towns of Megab and Koraro.\nDecember 2020\nThe Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) and Eritrean Defence Forces (EDF) killed five civilians in Hawzen (Eastern Tigray) on 1 December 2020.\nThe EDF carried out a massacre in Hawzen around 23 December 2020. Estimates are up to seventy people killed.\nJanuary 2021\nThe ENDF and EDF killed thirty civilians in Hawzen on 23 January 2021. The EHRC–OHCHR Tigray investigation reported the massacres in this locality, without going into further detail.\nFebruary 2021\nThe ENDF and EDF killed eleven civilians in Hawzen from 8 to 14 February 2021.\nPerpetrators\nWitnesses interpreted the identity of the late November perpetrators as Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers.\nLocal residents identified the perpetrators of the late December massacre as mainly EDF, identified as Eritrean by cheek markings and pronunciation when speaking Tigrinya, and some ENDF and Amhara special forces.\nRape camp\nHawzen Primary Hospital was looted and destroyed by the EDF. The ENDF used the hospital as a military base several times. In one of the periods of ENDF military use of the hospital, the ENDF established the hospital as a rape camp, holding captive girls and women that they had brought with them into Hawzen. The beds normally meant for medical patients were used for the rapes. Methods used to prevent girls and women from escaping included tying them to the beds or locking doors.\n}}\nExternal links\n*[https://sites.tufts.edu/wpf/starving-tigray/ World Peace Foundation: Starving Tigray]"
