The sixth such elections since the post of President of Abkhazia was created in 1994, they were held early due to the resignation of President Alexander Ankvab on 1 June 2014 following the 2014 Abkhazian political crisis. Four candidates contested the elections, which were won by Raul Khadjimba, who received just over 50% of the vote.\nBackground\nOn 27 May, opposition protesters stormed the Presidential administration, prompting Ankvab to flee to Gudauta. The resulting crisis culminated in his resignation on 1 June. As Vice President Mikhail Logua had already resigned in December 2013 due to ill health, Speaker of the People's Assembly of Abkhazia Valeri Bganba has become acting president.\nOn 3 June 2014, chairman of the Central Election Committee Batal Tabagua announced that the committee had begun preparations for the Presidential election and that the date had been set for 24 August.\nCandidates\nCandidates could be nominated between 25 June and 14 July. Parties registered less than five months before the election date were not eligible to nominate candidates. On 14 July, the Central Election Commission announced that all candidates except Beslan Eshba had passed the Abkhaz language fluency test. On 15 July, the Central Election Commission officially registered Khajimba, Kishmaria, Bazhania and Dzapshba as candidates. Of these, the first three received their registration certificates that same day, and Dzapshba on 16 July.\n{| class=wikitable\n!Presidential candidate\n!Career\n!Vice Presidential candidate\n!Career\n!Political support\n|-\n!colspan=5|Candidates participating in the election\n|-\n|Mirab Kishmaria\n|\n*Minister of Defence (2007–present)\n*Army General\n|Said Lolua\n|\n|\n*Nominated by an initiative group (25 June)\n*Youth Forum (1 August)\n|-\n|Leonid Dzapshba\n|\n*Chairman of the Civil Union For the Rule of Law, Stability and Democracy\n*Minister of Internal Affairs (2010–2011)\n|Boris Abitov\n|\n|\n*Nominated by an initiative group (27 June)\n|-\n|Raul Khajimba\n|\n*Chairman of the Forum for the National Unity of Abkhazia\n*Member of Parliament (2012–present)\n*Vice President (2005–2009)\n*Prime Minister (2003–2004)\n*Minister of Defence (2002–2003)\n|Vitali Gabnia\n|\n*Chairman of Aruaa\n|\n*Nominated by the Forum for the National Unity of Abkhazia (30 June)\n*Coordinating Council of Political Parties and Public Organisations (18 June)\n*Aruaa (19 June)\n*Three out of four members of the executive committee of the Political Council of the Communist Party (24 July)\n*Businessman Vitali Leiba (30 July)\n*20 (out of 35) Members of the People's Assembly of Abkhazia (15 August)\n*32 MPs from the first four convocations of the People's Assembly of Abkhazia (22 August)\n*United Abkhazia\n|-\n|Aslan Bzhania\n|\n*Chairman of the State Security Service of Abkhazia\n|Astan Agrba\n|\n|\n*Nominated by an initiative group (2 July)\n*Amtsakhara (18 July)\n*Former vice president Mikhail Logua (18 August)\n*(Part of) Beslan Eshba's campaign staff (23 August)\n|-\n!colspan=5|Nominated candidates, but not registered\n|-\n|Beslan Eshba\n|\n*Vice Premier (2013–2014)\n*Member of Parliament (2012–2013)\n*Businessman\n|Vakhtang Tsugba\n|\n*Major General\n*Former Military Commissar\n|\n*Nominated by an initiative group (26 June)\n|}\nMirab Kishmaria\nKishmaria's campaign manager was former MP Ilia Gamisonia.\nKishmaria campaigned on 23 July in the villages of Sanarda, Agubedia and Pervaya Bedia (Tkvarcheli District), on 24 July in Lykhny and Duripshi (Gudauta District), on 25 July in Gantiadi and Mekhadiri (Gagra District), on 29 July again in Lykhny, on 7 August among diaspora voters in Moscow, on 14 August with voters in Cherkessk, on 15 August in Primorskoe, Abgarkhuk and Achandara (Gudauta District), on 18 August in Sukhumi's New District and on 21 August in Tkvarcheli.\nLeonid Dzapshba\nDzapshba's campaign manager was former chairman of the State Committee for Youth Affairs and Sports Rafael Ampar.

Accordingly, on 1 July, 22787 Georgians were stricken from the voters list.\nRe-opening of railway-connection with Armenia through Georgia\nOn 7 July, four Armenian former and current members of the People's Assembly launched an appeal that Abkhazia should actively push for the restoration of the Russian-Armenian railway link through Abkhazia, as it would strengthen both Abkhazia's economy and sovereignty. The proposal received sharp criticism in Parliament, in part due to the use in the appeal of the phrase 'the Abkhazian-Georgian section of the railway'. On 16 July, Aslan Bzhania expressed his support for the proposal.\nIncidents\nAround 4:05 in the morning of 20 August, a grenade was thrown into courtyard of CEC head Batal Tabagua.
