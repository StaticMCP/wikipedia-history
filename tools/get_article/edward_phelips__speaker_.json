He was knighted in 1603 and one of his major roles was as the opening prosecutor during the trial of the Gunpowder Plotters.\nHe married Margaret Newdigate, and his son, Sir Robert Phelips, inherited his land and property.\nLife\nHe was fourth and youngest son of Thomas Phelips (1500–1588) of Montacute, Somerset, by his wife Elizabeth (d. 1598), daughter of John Smythe of Long Ashton in the same county.
