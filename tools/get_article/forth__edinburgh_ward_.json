Established in 2007 along with the other wards, it currently elects four Councillors. Its territory covers communities in the north of the city between Ferry Road and the coast on the Firth of Forth, including Granton, Newhaven, Pilton, Trinity, Victoria Park and Wardie, some of which historically fell within the boundaries of Leith. A 2017 boundary change caused the loss of the Muirhouse neighbourhood, but housebuilding elsewhere (including various projects in Granton) meant the overall population increased slightly. In 2019, the ward had a population of 31,823.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Steve Cardownie(SNP)\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Elaine P Morris(Liberal Democrats)\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Elizabeth Maginnis(Labour)\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Allan Jackson(Conservative)\n|-\n!2008 by\n|rowspan=4|Cammy Day(Labour)\n|-\n!2012\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=1|Eleanor Bird(SNP)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|George Gordon(SNP)\n|rowspan=1|Jim Campbell(Conservative)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1|Stuart Dobbin(SNP)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Sanne Dijkstra-Downie(Liberal Democrats)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Kayleigh O'Neill(Green)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2017 election\n2017 City of Edinburgh Council election\n2012 election\n2012 City of Edinburgh Council election\n2008 by-election\nA by-election arose following the death of Labour councillor Elizabeth Maginnis on 7 September 2008.
