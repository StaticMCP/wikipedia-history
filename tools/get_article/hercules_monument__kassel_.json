It is located in the Bergpark Wilhelmshöhe (Wilhelmshöhe Mountainpark) in northern Hesse, Germany.\nHercules is a copper statue depicting the ancient Greek demigod Heracles (Gr. Ηρακλής, German Herkules). The statue is located at the top of a pyramid, which stands on top of the octagon; the statue and the other parts of the monument were constructed at different times. Today \"Hercules\" refers to the whole monument, including the Octagon and Pyramid. The monument is the highest point in the Wilhelmshöhe Bergpark.\nThe monument is located in Bad Wilhelmshöhe, on the Eastern ridge of the Habichtswald. It was built in an artificial dell of the Karlsberg ( above sea level) on the western-most and highest location () of the line of sight Schloss Wilhelmshöhe – Hercules.\nThe Hercules monument and the surrounding Wilhelmshöhe Bergpark were inscribed as a World Heritage Site in 2013, owing to their outstanding Baroque architecture and intricate water features.\nDesign\nWater features\nThe water features were built on . The cascades are a  long stone structure shaped like a staircase. The water  starts from the Hercules monument and runs down the cascades, Steinhöfer's waterfall, the devil's bridge, finally tumbling down the aqueduct before finally arriving at the lake where a fountain of about  ends the spectacle. About  of water are needed.\nThis system relies on natural pressure from reservoirs and underground pipes whose locks are opened manually\nDuring the summer (from May until October every Wednesday and Sunday afternoon), visitors can attend this event. Additionally, every first Saturday of the months of June, July, August and September this event takes place during the evening with lights of different colors illuminating the water, the fountain and the monument features.\nOctagon and statue\nThe Hercules monument has a total height of :  for the Octagon;  for the Pyramid and  for the statue. The height difference between top of the statue and the bottom of the cascades is .\nHistory\nConstruction of the Bergpark began in 1696. The Hercules statue was built from 1701 to 1717 and is based on the design of the Italian Giovanni Francesco Guerniero.  The complex is the northernmost part of the park and is an important baroque aspect of the Bergpark Wilhelmshöhe. 520 steps lead to the top.\nIn late 2005, a restructuring of the entire monument, including the statue was initiated. Initially, the project was to be completed in 2009. The restoration was later estimated to cost more than 24 million Euro and last through 2018.\nMaterial\n– the Kassel landmark]]\nimage:Herkules_mit_baugeruest.jpg|Restructuring at the Hercules monument in autumn 2006\nimage:Herkules-KS-bauarbeiten-verhuellt.jpg|January 2007 – Hercules still cloaked\nimage:Hercules monument back view.jpg|Back view of the statue in September 2011\nThe complete structure (Octagon and Cascades) are made of Tuff sourced from quarries nearby. This soft material has the advantage of good workability, but weathers quickly, particularly by frost-related erosion. This rapid weathering process has been a structural issue for the statue.\nFurther reading\n* Giovanni Francesco Guerniero, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ab1BNN2w9RkC Delineatio Montis], Cassel 1706 Faksimile, Leipzig 1988 (auch Stuttgart 1988)\n* Paul Heidelbach, Die Geschichte der Wilhelmshöhe.
