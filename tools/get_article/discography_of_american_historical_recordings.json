The 78rpm era was the time period in which any flat disc records were being played at a speed of 78 revolutions per minute. The DAHR provides some of these original recordings, free of charge, via audio streaming, along with access to the production catalogs of those same companies. DAHR is part of the American Discography Project (ADP), and is funded and operated in partnership by the University of California, Santa Barbara, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Packard Humanities Institute.\nDatabase catalog\nThe database catalog is based mainly on materials stored at the successors of the original production companies, with some additional research. Catalogs compiled by specialists are also used.\n* Victor Talking Machine Company releases, including RCA-Victor recordings, were made in the United States and Central and South America prior to 1939. This includes audio recordings that were leased from the Gramophone Company's recordings catalog.
