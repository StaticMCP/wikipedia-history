When Ankan was 66 years old, Keitai abdicated in favor of him.\nAnkan's contemporary title would not have been tennō, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably , meaning \"the great king who rules all under heaven\". Alternatively, Ankan might have been referred to as  or the \"Great King of Yamato\".\nThe most noteworthy event recorded during his reign was the construction of state granaries in large numbers throughout Japan, indicating the broad reach of imperial power at the time.\n]]\nAnkan's grave is traditionally associated with the Takayatsukiyama kofun in Habikino, Osaka.\nGenealogy\nEmpress: , Emperor Ninken's daughter\nConsort: , Kose no Ohito no Ōomi's daughter\nConsort: , Kose no Ohito no Ōomi's daughter\nConsort: , Mononobe no Itabi no Ōomuraji's daughter\nFirst son: Imperial Prince Ako.\nSecond son: Prince Kibu\nThird son: Prince Akihinohohoshika, later Emperor Kinmei\nSee also\n* Emperor of Japan\n* List of Emperors of Japan\n* Imperial cult\nNotes\nReferences\n* Aston, William George.
