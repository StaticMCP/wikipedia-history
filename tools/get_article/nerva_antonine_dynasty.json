The first five of these are popularly known as the \"Five Good Emperors\".\nThe first five of the six successions within this dynasty were notable in that the reigning emperor did not have a male heir, and had to adopt the candidate of his choice to be his successor. Under Roman law, an adoption established a bond legally as strong as that of kinship.\nIt was common for patrician families to adopt, and Roman emperors had adopted heirs in the past: the Emperor Augustus had adopted Tiberius, and the Emperor Claudius had adopted Nero. Julius Caesar, dictator perpetuo and considered to be instrumental in the transition from Republic to Empire, adopted Gaius Octavius, who later became Augustus, Rome's first emperor. Moreover, there were often still family connections: Trajan adopted his first cousin once removed and great-nephew by marriage Hadrian, Hadrian made his half-nephew by marriage Antoninus Pius heir, and the latter adopted both Hadrian's half-great-nephew by marriage Marcus Aurelius (Antonius' nephew by marriage) and the son of Hadrian's original planned successor, Lucius Verus. Marcus Aurelius's naming of his son Commodus as heir was considered to be an unfortunate choice and the beginning of the Empire's decline.\nWith the murder of Commodus in 192, the Nerva–Antonine dynasty came to an end. It was followed by a brief period of turbulence known as the Year of the Five Emperors which ended with the establishment of the new Severan dynasty.\nHistory\nNerva–Trajan dynasty\n)\n|image1   = Bust of Emperor Nerva in lorica military cloak and paludamentum, Greek marble, 96 - 98 AD, Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence (19243236348).jpg\n|caption1 =Nerva ()\n|image2   =Ritratto di traiano, 100-117 ca.

Though his reign was short, it saw a partial reconciliation between the army, the senate and the commoners. Nerva adopted as his son the popular military leader Trajan. In turn, Hadrian succeeded Trajan; he had been the latter's heir presumptive, and averred that he had been adopted by him on Trajan's deathbed.\nAntonine dynasty\n)\n|image1   = Antoninus Pius (Emperor AD 138-161).jpg\n|caption1 =Antoninus Pius ()\n|image2   = Metropolitan Marcus Aurelius Roman 2C AD (cropped).jpg\n|caption2 =Marcus Aurelius ()\n|image3   = (Venice) Lucio Vero - Venice National Archaeological Museum.jpg\n|caption3 =Lucius Verus ()\n|image4   = Commodus Musei Capitolini MC1120.jpg\n|caption4 =Commodus ()\n}}\nThe Antonines are four Roman Emperors who ruled between 138 and 192: Antoninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius, Lucius Verus and Commodus.\nIn 138, after a long reign dedicated to the cultural unification and consolidation of the empire, the Emperor Hadrian named Antoninus Pius his son and heir, under the condition that he adopt both Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus. Hadrian died that same year, and Antoninus began a peaceful, benevolent reign. He adhered strictly to Roman traditions and institutions, and shared his power with the Roman Senate.\nMarcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus succeeded Antoninus Pius in 161 upon that emperor's death, and co-ruled until Verus' death in 169. Marcus continued the Antonine legacy after Verus' death as an unpretentious and gifted administrator and leader. He died in 180 and was followed by his biological son, Commodus.\nFive Good Emperors\nThe rulers commonly known as the \"Five Good Emperors\" were Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius, who reigned from AD 96 to 180. The term is based on Niccolò Machiavelli's review on Roman emperors in Book 1, Chapter 10 of his book The Discourses on Livy:\n}}\nMachiavelli argued that these adopted emperors earned the respect of those around them through good governance:\n}}\nEdward Gibbon wrote in The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire that their rule was a time when \"the Roman Empire was governed by absolute power, under the guidance of wisdom and virtue\". Gibbon believed that these benevolent monarchs and their moderate policies were unusual and contrasted with their more tyrannical and oppressive successors.\nTimeline\nImageSize = width:900 height:auto barincrement:12\nPlotArea = top:3 bottom:150 right:150 left:20\nAlignBars = late\nDateFormat = yyyy\nPeriod = from:96 till:192\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:5 start:100\nScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:96\nColors =\nid:canvas value:white\nid:emperor value:red\nid:caesar value:blue\nid:junioremperor value:pink\nBarData =\nbar:nerva\nbar:trajan\nbar:hadrian\nbar:luciusaelius\nbar:antoninuspius\nbar:marcusaurelius\nbar:luciusverus\nbar:commodus\nbar:anniusverus\nPlotData=\nwidth:5 align:left fontsize:S shift:(5,-4) anchor:till\nbar:nerva\nfrom:96 till:98 color:emperor text:Nerva\nbar:trajan\nfrom:97 till:98 color:caesar\nfrom:98 till:117 color:emperor text:Trajan\nbar:hadrian\nfrom:117 till:138 color:emperor text:Hadrian\nbar:luciusaelius\nfrom:136 till:138 color:caesar text:Lucius Aelius\nbar:antoninuspius\nat:138 mark:(line,blue)\nfrom:138 till:161 color:emperor text:Antoninus Pius\nbar:marcusaurelius\nfrom:139 till:161 color:caesar\nfrom:161 till:180 color:emperor text:Marcus Aurelius\nbar:luciusverus\nfrom:161 till:169 color:emperor text:Lucius Verus\nbar:commodus\nfrom:166 till:177 color:caesar\nfrom:177 till:180 color:junioremperor\nfrom:180 till:192 color:emperor text:Commodus\nbar:anniusverus\nfrom:166 till:169 color:caesar text:Annius Verus\n*  denotes Senior Emperors\n*  denotes Junior Emperors\n*  denotes Caesars (official heirs)\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
