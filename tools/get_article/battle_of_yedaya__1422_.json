The Adalite army was victorious and the Ethiopian king was captured and killed, according to Richard Pankhurst. However, many historians such as Mohammed Hassen,  J. Spencer Trimingham, E.A. Wallis Budge and Taddesse Tamrat put the end of Dawit's reign at 1411-1412, a decade before the supposed battle takes place.\nPrelude\nAfter his reconquest of Adal, Sabr ad-Din III died of natural causes in 1422, Sultan Mansur ad-Din succeeded the throne and enjoyed support of his brother Muhammad.\nBattle\nEarly in his reign, Mansur ad-Din launched an expedition against a king of Ethiopia and drove him to Yedaya which was described as his royal seat. After destroying the Solomonic army, Mansur allegedly captured the said king and killed him.\nRichard Pankhurst claims that the king in question was Dawit I, whose death, he claims, like that of many other Solomonic kings, although presumed to be an event of major importance, is not recorded by the Ethiopian Chronicles. The Ethiopian historian Taddesse Tamrat argues the Ethiopian royal chronicles of this era often deliberately attempted to suppress the violent deaths of the kings whose reigns they extol. However, Taddesse Tamrat himself puts the end of Dawit's reign at 1412, contradicting Pankhurst's presumption of the Emperor's death in this battle. Historians such as Tamrat, along with the overwhelming other of historians such as Mohammed Hassen,  J. Spencer Trimingham, E.A. Wallis Budge dispute this.\nReferences"
