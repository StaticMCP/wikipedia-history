Today, they are considered culture heroes, but they were widely worshipped as divine \"ancestral spirits\" in ancient times. According to received history, the period they existed in preceded the Xia dynasty, although they were thought to exist in later periods to an extent in incorporeal forms that aided the Chinese people, especially with the stories of Nüwa existing as a spirit in the Shang dynasty and Shennong being identified as the godly form of Hou Ji and a founder of the Zhou dynasty.\nIn myth, the Three Sovereigns were demigods who used their abilities to help create mankind and impart to them essential skills and knowledge. The Five Emperors were exemplary sages who possessed great moral character, and were from a golden age when \"communications between the human order and the divine were central to all life\" and where the sages embodied the divine, or aided humans in communicating divine forces.\nIn this period the abdication system was used before Qi of Xia violently seized power and established a hereditary monarchy.\nHistory\nTaoist beliefs consist of parables involving shamanistic themes, which is origin of most ancient stories about the Sovereigns Fuxi, Nüwa, and Shennong. The idea of the existence of five emperors appeared in V century BC. Scholars believe the tradition of susception appeared in the early Warring States period to support the political agenda of the ministers, that frequently overthrew their state rulers.\nVariations\n, Emperor Yan and Chiyou.]]\nThere are six to seven known variations on which people constitute the Three Sovereigns and the Five Emperors, depending on the source. Many of the known sources were written in much later dynasties.\nGroupings of the Three Sovereigns consist of some combination of the following: Fuxi, Nüwa, Shennong, Suiren, Zhu Rong, Gonggong, the Heavenly Sovereign, the Earthly Sovereign, the Human Sovereign (in two varieties), and the Yellow Emperor.\nGroupings of the Five Emperors consist of some combination of the following: the Yellow Emperor, Zhuanxu, Emperor Ku, Emperor Yao, Emperor Shun, Shaohao, Taihao, and the Yan Emperor.\nThree Sovereigns\nThe Three Sovereigns, sometimes known as the Three August Ones, were said to be god-kings or demigods who used their magical powers, divine powers, or being in harmony with the Tao to improve the lives of their people. Because of their lofty virtue, they lived to a great age and ruled over a period of great peace.\nThe Sovereigns have elements in common with xian from the Taoist pantheon, such as the Human Sovereign's cloud-chariot and their supernatural abilities. Upon his death, the Yellow Emperor was \"said to have become\" a xian.\nThe Yellow Emperor is supposedly the ancestor of the Huaxia people. The Mausoleum of the Yellow Emperor was established in Shaanxi to commemorate the ancestry legend.\nThe Three Sovereigns are ascribed various identities in different historical texts, as shown in the table below:\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! width=30% | According to source\n! width=70% | Three Sovereigns\n|-\n| Records of the Grand Historian, addition by Sima Zhen || Heavenly Sovereign, Earthly Sovereign, Tai Sovereign or Fu Xi, Nüwa, Shennong\n|-\n| Sovereign series (帝王世系) || Fu Xi, Shennong, Yellow Emperor\n|-\n| Shiben|| Fu Xi, Shennong, Yellow Emperor\n|-\n| Baihu Tongyi (白虎通義) || (1st variation)Fu Xi, Shennong, Zhu Rong(2nd variation)Fu Xi, Shennong, Suiren\n|-\n| Fengsu Tongyi || Fu Xi, Nüwa, Shennong\n|-\n| Yiwen Leiju || Heavenly Sovereign, Earthly Sovereign; Human Sovereign\n|-\n| Tongjian Waiji (通鑑外紀) || Fu Xi, Shennong, Gonggong\n|-\n| Chunqiu yundou shu (春秋運斗樞)Chunqiu yuanming bao (春秋元命苞) || Fu Xi, Nüwa, Shennong\n|-\n| Shangshu dazhuan (尚書大傳) || Fu Xi, Shennong, Suiren\n|-\n| Diwang shiji (帝王世紀) || Fu Xi, Shennong, Yellow Emperor\n|-\n|}\nFive Emperors\nThe Five Emperors were traditionally thought to have invented \"fire, writing and irrigation\".

After their era, Yu the Great founded the Xia dynasty, traditionally considered the first dynasty in Chinese historiography.\nGallery\nImage:Changchun-Temple-Jiazi-Dian-0330.jpg|The Hall of the Three Sovereigns in Changchun Si (), a Taoist temple in Wuhan\nFile:Shennong3.jpg|Shennong tasting herbs to discover their qualities\nImage:Yellow Emperor.jpg|Historian's depiction of the Yellow Emperor\nFile:Yellowemperor.jpg|Another depiction of the Yellow Emperor\nFile:Shaohao - tumulus with a Shaohao Ling stele in front of it - P1050742.JPG|Shaohao Tomb near Qufu, Shandong\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*"
