It was the first society to issue the professional title of Incorporated Engineer. It merged with the Institution of Incorporated Engineers (IIE) in 2005, and in 2006 the merged body joined with the Institution of Electrical Engineers to become the Institution of Engineering and Technology.\nHistory\nEstablishment\nEstablished in May 1854 in The Strand, London, the Society of Engineers was one of the oldest professional engineering bodies in the United Kingdom (after the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers, 1771, the Institution of Civil Engineers, 1818, and the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, 1847)\nIt promoted the interests of members worldwide and was concerned with all branches of engineering. It was founded by Henry Palfrey Stephenson and Robert Monro Christie as a means of reunion for former students of Putney College (the short-lived College for Civil Engineers, 1839–c.1851) — one of few institutions then giving technical and scientific training for engineers — with Stephenson serving as president in 1856 and 1859.\nTimeline\n* 1839 – College for Civil Engineers founded\n* 1854 – Society of Engineers (SoE) founded\n* 1884 – Junior Institution of Engineers founded\n* 1976 – Junior Institution of Engineers renamed the Institution of Mechanical & General Technician Engineers (IMGTechE)\n* Early 20th century – Association of Supervisory Electrical Engineers (ASEE) founded\n* 1928 – Cumann na nInnealtoiri (The Engineers Society) is founded in Ireland\n* Early 20th century – Institute of Engineers and Technicians (IET) founded\n* Mid 20th century – Institution of Incorporated Executive Engineers (IIExE) founded\n* Mid 20th century – The Institution of Electronics and Radio Engineers (IERE) founded\n* 1965 – Institution of Electrical and Electronics Technician Engineers (IEETE) founded,       incorporating ASEE (with support from the IEE)\n* 1965 – The Society of Electronics and Radio Technicians (SERT) founded by amalgamation of IERE with Radio Trades Examination Board (RTEB).  SERT then supported RTEB renamed as the Electronics Examination Board (EEB)\n* 1969 – A number of Corporate Members of the Society of Engineers founded on the 27 October 1969 The Society of Professional Engineers (SPE) that maintains a register of Engineers who have proved their competence and can be accurately described as Professional Engineers and who on Registration can use the designation \"P.Eng.\";\n* 1969 – The Institution of Civil Engineers and Cumann na nInnealtóirí merged to form the Institution of Engineers of Ireland, now known as Engineers Ireland.\n* 1978 – The Institution of Technician Engineers in Mechanical Engineering (ITEME)    founded (with support from IMechE)\n* 1982 – The IMGTechE and ITEME merged to form the Institution of Mechanical Incorporated Engineers (IMechIE)\n* 1982 – IEETE renamed the Institution of Electrical and Electronics Incorporated Engineers\n* 1990 – IEEIE and SERT merged to form the Institution of Electronics and Electrical Incorporated Engineers (IEEIE)\n* 1998 – IEEIE, IMechIE and IET merged to form the Institution of Incorporated Engineers in electronic, electrical and mechanical Engineering (IIE)\n* 1999 – IEExE merged with IIE\n* 2001 – IIE granted royal charter and renamed the Institution of Incorporated Engineers (IIE)\n* 2004 – Institute of British Engineers (IBE) wound up\n* 2005 – EEB wound up\n* 2005 – Society of Engineers merged into IIE. The merger ensured continued recognition of the society as its members retained their post nominal letters (MSE or MSEng), and securedg a broader membership base for the IIE.\n* 2006 – IIE and IEE (Institution of Electrical Engineers) joined to form the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET).\n* 2018 – SPE absorbed into IET\n* 2019 – The Society of Environmental Engineers (SEE) wound up\nThe IET now has more than 150,000 members worldwide, and incorporates all members of the Society of Engineers.\nMembership\nExaminations\nTo become a member the candidate was subjected to an examination divided into three parts:\n* Part I:   General Engineering\n* Part II:  Design Paper (Civil, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical/ Electronics Project).\n* Part III: Management\nMembership qualifications\n* ASE: Associate Engineering (Non-Corporate Member)\nminimum age 21 years, a qualification BTEC, HND, HNC or GNVQ/NVQ/SNQ Level 4 in engineering or similar approved qualification and 3 years of engineering training.
