The Ottoman Army at Ma'an was sent to deal with the North Arab Army. The Ottomans were ambushed by 700 Arab troops, inflicting heavy casualties and capturing 300 men. The remaining Ottoman forces retreated, leaving the railway uncaptured. After the battle, the Arabs rode further north to chase the retreating Turkish forces.\nReferences\nSources\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120906010426/http://marshallbaldwin.com/issues/SW_Asia/History_of_the_Syrian_Arab_Army.pdf History of the Syrian Arab Army]\n* [https://www.scribd.com/doc/48272473/The-Arab-Revolt-1916-1918 The Arab Revolt 1916-18, Lawrence sets Arabia ablaze]"
