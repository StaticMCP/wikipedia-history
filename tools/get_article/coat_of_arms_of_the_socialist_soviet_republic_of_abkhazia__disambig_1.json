The coat of arms was used until 1931 when SSR Abkhazia was transformed into the Abkhaz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.\nHistory\nFirst version\nThe first coat of arms of the SSR of Abkhazia was similar to the coat of arms of the Russian SFSR. The Emblem was adopted in 1921. The coat of arms contains the motto \"Workers of all countries unite\" in Russian, surrounded by Russian inscriptions \"Сов. Соц. Республика Абхазии\".\nSecond version\nThe III All-Abkhazian Congress of Soviets, held from March 26 to April 1, 1925, adopted the Basic Law (Constitution) of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Abkhazia, in which the coat of arms was written in Article 115:\nThird version\nSince 1926, the inscription \"ССР Аҧсны\" in the Abkhaz language has been moved from the central image to the circular red border and duplicated in Russian (ССР Абхазия) and Georgian (საბჭოთა სრა), like the slogan \"Proletarians of all countries, unite!\".\nThis change was fixed by a revised edition of the Constitution of the SSR of Abkhazia, adopted at the Fourth All-Abkhazian Congress of Soviets in March 1927. The coat of arms is described in Article 101:\nGallery\nCOA of the Abkhazia (1921-1925).svg|1921–1925\nCoat of arms of the Abkhazian SSR.png|1925–1926\nEmblem of the SSR Abkhazia (1926-1928).gif|1926–1928\nEmblem of the SSR of Abkhazia (1928-1931).svg|1928–1931\nSee also\n*Flag of the SSR Abkhazia\n*Emblem of Abkhazia\nExternal links\n*\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20070103190838/http://dp.abhazia.com/geraldika.html"
