In 1843, the kingdom became a protectorate of France. In 1959, it merged with Ivory Coast.\nIn the early 19th century, Sanwi was a vassal to the Asante Empire until this status was destroyed as a result of French colonial expansion in the region.\nThe kingdom declared American singer Michael Jackson to be Prince of the Sanwi in 1992. Reciprocal visits by Jackson and King Amon N'Douffou IV were made to Krindjabo and Los Angeles respectively. After Jackson's death in 2009, an elaborate two-day funeral was held in Sanwi. Jesse Jackson was declared prince in August of that year when he was crowned Prince Nana by Amon N'Douffou V.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://delegationroyaumesanwi.fr.gd European Delegation of Sanwi Kingdom] (in French)"
