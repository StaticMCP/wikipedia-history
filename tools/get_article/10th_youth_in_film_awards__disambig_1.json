This 5 month \"push-back\" effectively resulted in no ceremony taking place during the 1988 calendar year, however, performances during late 1987 and 1988 were recognized at the 10th annual ceremony.\nCategories\n★ Bold indicates the winner in each category.\nBest Young Performer in a Motion Picture\nBest Young Actor in a Motion Picture: Drama\n★ 'Christian Bale - Empire of the Sun (Warner Bros)'\n* Warwick Davis - Willow (M.G.M.)\n* Kevin Dillon - The Rescue (Touchstone)\n* Sebastian Rice-Edwards - Hope and Glory\n* Neil Patrick Harris - ''Clara's Heart (Warner Bros)\n* Roland Harrah III - Braddock: Missing in Action III (Cannon Films)\n* Darius McCrary - Mississippi Burning\n* Doudi Shoua - Rambo III\nBest Young Actress in a Motion Picture: Drama\n★ 'Hayley Taylor Block - Touch of a Stranger (Raven Star)'\n* Annabeth Gish - Mystic Pizza (Samuel-Goldwyn)\n* Laura Jane Goodwin - Crystalstone (Moviestore Entertainment)\n* Marcie Leeds - Beaches (Touchstone)\n* Mindy McEnnan - World Gone Wild (Apollo Pictures)\n* Martha Plimpton - Running on Empty (Warner Bros)\n* Julia Roberts - Mystic Pizza (Samuel-Goldwyn)\n* Meredith Salenger - A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon (20th Century Fox)\nBest Young Actor in a Motion Picture: Comedy or Fantasy\n★ '(tie) Corey Feldman - License to Drive (20th Century Fox)\n★ (tie) Corey Haim - License to Drive (20th Century Fox)'\n* Jade Calegory - Mac and Me (Orion Pictures)\n* David Moscow - Big (20th Century Fox)\n* Jared Rushton - Big (20th Century Fox)\n* Jamie Wild - Overboard (M.G.M.)\nBest Young Actress in a Motion Picture: Comedy or Fantasy\n★ 'Mayim Bialik - Beaches (Touchstone)'\n* Tina Caspary - Mac and Me (Orion Pictures)\n* Angela Goethals - Heartbreak Hotel (Touchstone)\n* Heather Graham - License To Drive (20th Century Fox)\n* Alyson Hannigan - My Stepmother Is an Alien (Columbia)\n* Lauren Stanley - Mac and Me (Orion Pictures)\nBest Young Actor in a Motion Picture: Horror or Mystery\n★ 'Lukas Haas - Lady in White (New Century Vista Film Company)'\n* Rodney Eastman - A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master (New Line Cinema)\n* Ricky Paull Goldin - The Blob (Tri-Star)\n* Andras Jones - A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master (New Line Cinema)\n* Michael Kenworthy - Return of the Living Dead Part II'' (Lorimar)\n* Kieran O'Brien - Bellman and True (Island Pictures)\nBest Young Actress in a Motion Picture: Horror or Mystery\n★ 'Kristy Swanson - Flowers in the Attic (New World Pictures)'\n* Jennifer Banko - Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (Paramount)\n* Paula Irvine - Phantasm II (Universal)\n* Marcie Leeds - Near Dark (Anchor Bay Entertainment)\n* Shawnee Smith - The Blob (TriStar)\n* Ebony Smith - Lethal Weapon (Warner Bros)\n* Brooke Theiss - A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master (New Line Cinema)\nBest Young Actor in a Student Film\n★ 'Ryan Leigh Lewis - Little Brother (USC)'\n* Robert Arnett - Come in Johnny (LACC)\n* Adam Carl - Rose and Katz (AFI)\n* Josh Wiener - Stead Fast Boy (AFI)\nBest Young Actress in a Student Film\n★ 'Jessica Leigh Hinds - Edifice Complex'\n* Maleshea Afle Hurts - Jack in the Box\n* Jasmine Hicks - Halmoni, First Bow\nBest Young Actor/Actress in a Film Made for Video\n★ 'Brandon Quintin Adams - Moonwalker (Warner Bros)'\n* Shalane McCall - Modeling, What It Takes\n* Jared Rushton - Kidsongs\nBest Young Performer in a TV Special, TV Movie or Mini-Series\nBest Young Actor in a TV Special, Pilot, Movie of the Week, or Mini-Series\n★ 'Lukas Haas - A Place at the Table (NBC)'\n* Adam Carl - Down Delaware Road (NBC)\n* Steven Dorff - Mutts (ABC)\n* Michael Faustino - Home Sweet Homeless (CBS)\n* Ross Harris - Home Sweet Homeless (CBS)\n* Matthew Lawrence - David (ABC)\n* James Marshall - Date Rape (ABC)\n* Jason Oliver - ''I'll Be Home for Christmas (NBC)\n* Vonni Ribisi - Promised A Miracle (CBS)\n* Ricky Schroder - Too Young the Hero (CBS)\n* R.
