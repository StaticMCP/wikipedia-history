Players included Daniel Harford (performing Five's \"When the Lights Go Out\"); Nicky Winmar (performing \"That's All Right (Mama)\" by Elvis Presley); Dale Lewis; Nick Daffy; and Adam Heuskes (performing \"Holiday\" by Madonna).\nMusical guests on the show also included Taxiride and Human Nature.\nJason Dunstall announced his retirement live on air after months of speculation.\nThe show was broadcast on Wednesday nights, to avoid competition with the more established The Footy Show on Thursdays. However, ratings were low and the show was axed after the 1999 AFL season, replaced in 2000 by The Game.\nSee also\n*List of Australian television series\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
