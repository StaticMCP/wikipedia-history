They are members of the Coastal Conference of the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL). They play their home games at Hap Parker Arena.\nHistory\nPowell River joined the British Columbia Junior Hockey League (BCJHL) for the start of the 1988–89 season with the name the \"Paper Kings\", when they assumed the Delta Flyers franchise. They dropped the \"Paper\" from their name for the start of the 1998–99 season.\nThe Kings had their greatest run of team success from the 2008–09 season through the 2011–12 season, during which they reached the Fred Page Cup finals in four consecutive years. Kings goaltender Michael Garteig, who played for Powell River for two seasons and was instrumental in the 2010–11 finals run, signed as a free agent with the Vancouver Canucks after his 2016-17 season in the NCAA with the Quinnipiac Bobcats. Garteig was called up to the Canucks, dressing as a backup on November 17th, 2016 against the Arizona Coyotes. The BCHL's Top Goaltender Award was renamed in Garteig's honour.\nSeason-by-season record\nNote: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime Losses, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, PIM = Penalties in minutes\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"min-width:55em; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
