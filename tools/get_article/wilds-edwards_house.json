Samuel H. Wilds and designed by J.L. Klickner in the Italianate style. The house was purchased from the Wilds estate in 1870 by the Hon. Berryman Wheeler Edwards, a graduate of Harvard Law School (1853), Confederate veteran, and state senator (1886–89). It remained in the Edwards family until the 1990s.\nAccording to local tradition, the Wilds-Edwards house was not destroyed by General William T. Sherman's army during the Campaign of the Carolinas because Klickner was in the detachment sent to burn Darlington and he persuaded the captain of the raiding company to delay its destruction. In the meantime, the Union troops encountered General Joseph Wheeler's cavalry and were unable to return to burn Darlington.\nReferences"
