Whig Lord Rockingham, Prime Minister from 1765 to 1766, formed a government. The Rockingham Whigs had generally been sympathetic to the cause of the Colonists and under Rockingham the British government began the negotiations leading to the Peace of Paris that concluded the war.\nThe death of Rockingham on 1 July 1782 caused a split in the ministry. The Home Secretary Lord Shelburne was appointed to succeed him, but several members of the government refused to serve under him and resigned. These \"Portland Whigs\" (named after their nominal leader, William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland, but in reality led by Charles James Fox) allied in opposition with Lord North and brought down the Shelburne ministry in 1783. The Portland Whigs came to power as the Fox–North coalition.\nCabinet\n:\n| minister1             = Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham\n| minister1_termstart   =\n| minister1_termend     =\n| minister1_ministryhead= y\n}}\n| minister1_termend     =\n}}\n| minister1_termend     =\n}}\n| minister1_termend     =\n}}\n| minister1_termend     =\n}}\n| minister1_termend     =\n}}\n| minister1             = Charles James Fox\n| minister1_termstart   =\n| minister1_termend     =\n}}\n| minister1_termend     =\n}}\n| minister1_termend     =\n}}\n| minister1_termend     =\n}}\n| minister1_termend     =\n}}\nMinisters not in Cabinet\n* Thomas Robinson, 2nd Baron Grantham &ndash; First Lord of Trade\n* Isaac Barré &ndash; Treasurer of the Navy\n* Thomas Townshend &ndash; Secretary at War\n* Edmund Burke &ndash; Paymaster of the Forces\n* William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland &ndash; Lord Lieutenant of Ireland\nReferences\n*"
