Holmboe of Holmboe & Lafferty, then the area’s largest architecture firm, and was completed in 1907. It was commissioned by Virgil L. Highland for what was regarded as the oldest bank charter in Clarksburg. The building is a contributing property to the Clarksburg Downtown Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places and is noted for its flatiron-shaped plan at the intersection of West Main Street and Fourth Street, as well as its steel-frame construction with brownstone and brick facing.\nHistory\nEmpire National Bank was organized in 1903 by Virgil L. Highland. The bank first operated from the Oak Hall Building on West Main Street before commissioning a purpose built headquarters at the corner of West Main and Fourth streets. The new seven story building opened in 1907.\nThe building served as the home of what was regarded as the oldest bank charter in Clarksburg. In the early twentieth century the basement housed the printing facilities of the Clarksburg Publishing Company, which produced the local newspaper.\nOn August 25 2023 the building was auctioned for 231000 dollars to an online investor who asked to remain anonymous.\nDesign\nThe Empire National Bank Building was designed in the Renaissance Revival style by architect Ernest C. S. Holmboe of Holmboe & Lafferty. The structure rises seven stories and occupies a narrow triangular lot created by the angle of West Main and Fourth streets. Its steel frame supports a rusticated brownstone base with brick above, and the facade is capped by a prominent bracketed cornice.\nThe building has two principal entrances, each framed with white terra cotta Corinthian frontispieces topped by female busts. The overall design represented a more elaborate commercial project than was typical for Holmboe and Lafferty, reflecting the ambitions of Virgil L. Highland who commissioned the work in 1907.\nThe interior retains significant elements of its early twentieth century bank layout, including an original spiral staircase and decorative lobby features. The building contains about 25000 square feet with a mix of offices, lounges, libraries, and conference rooms.\nReferences"
