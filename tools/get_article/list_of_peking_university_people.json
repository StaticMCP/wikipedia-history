Several notable individuals have been associated with Peking University.\nFaculty\n* Li Haopei 李浩培 – jurist, Judge of International Criminal Court\n* Li Shizeng, biology faculty; more prominent as anarchist and Guomindang politician.\n* Liang Shuming  梁漱溟 – modern neo-Confucianist. Liang was most famous for his critique of Marxist class theory, stating that, despite obvious disparities of wealth, Chinese rural society could not be unambiguously classified along class lines. One and the same family (particularly the large patriarchal lineages found in many regions) would commonly have some members among the \"haves\" and others among the \"have-nots\". The class struggle advocated by the Maoists would necessitate kinsmen attacking each other.\n* Lin Yutang 林语堂 – writer, inventor of the first Chinese typewriter and a new method of romanizing the Chinese language\n* Liu Shipei 刘师培 – historian and philosopher, an advocate of traditional Chinese monarchy\n* Lu Xun 鲁迅 – a remarkable writer, an important figure of China's New Culture Movement\n* Ma Yinchu 马寅初 – a prominent population economist, whose New Population Theory was criticized by Mao since 1957 for two decades. Having examined trends of the early 1950s, Ma argued that further population growth at such high rates would be detrimental to China's development. Therefore, he advocated government control of fertility.  In 1979, the Communist Party formally apologises to Ma, stating that \"erroneously criticized one person, population mistakenly increased 300,000,000\".\n* Qian Mu 钱穆 – historian, philosopher and confucian.
