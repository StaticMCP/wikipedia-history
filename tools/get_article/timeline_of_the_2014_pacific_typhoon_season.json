Most of the tropical cyclones forming between May and November. The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator between 100°E and the International Date Line. Tropical storms that form in the entire Western Pacific basin are assigned a name by the Japan Meteorological Agency. Tropical depressions that form in this basin are given a number with a \"W\" suffix by the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center. In addition, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assigns names to tropical cyclones (including tropical depressions) that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility. These names, however, are not in common use outside of the Philippines.\nDuring the season, 30 systems were designated as Tropical Depressions by either, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), or other National Meteorological and Hydrological Services such as the China Meteorological Administration and the Hong Kong Observatory. As they run the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre for the Western Pacific, the JMA assigns names to Tropical Depressions should they intensify into a tropical storm. PAGASA also assign local names to tropical depressions which form within their area of responsibility; however, these names are not in common use outside of PAGASA's area of responsibility. In this season, 19 systems entered or formed in the Philippine area of responsibility, which eight of them directly made landfall over the Philippines.\nThe first half of the season was relatively active with seven named storms. During the season, six typhoons underwent rapid deepening. The deadliest and damaging storm so far is Rammasun, killing nearly 200 people with damages of about $7 billion. During August, Hurricane Genevieve entered the basin as a super typhoon. During mid-August, as Genevieve began to weaken, tropical activity in the Northwest Pacific began to decrease, making it the first time no tropical storms develop during the peak of the season since records began. This also occurred for the second time during mid-October, after the dissipation of Vongfong. In early October, Vongfong reached its peak intensity as a strong Category 5 typhoon, the strongest since Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013.\nTimeline of events\nImageSize = width:1020 height:260\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend    = columns:2 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/01/2014 till:01/02/2015\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/01/2014\nColors     =\nid:canvas value:gray(0.88)\nid:GP     value:red\nid:TD     value:rgb(0.43,0.76,0.92)    legend:Tropical_Depression_=_≤62_km/h_(≤39_mph)\nid:TS     value:rgb(0.3,1,1)    legend:Tropical_Storm_=_62–88_km/h_(39–54_mph)\nid:ST     value:rgb(0.75,1,0.75)        legend:Severe_Tropical_Storm_=_89–117_km/h_(55–72_mph)\nid:STY    value:rgb(1,0.85,0.55)    legend:Typhoon_=_118–156_km/h_(73–96_mph)\nid:VSTY   value:rgb(1,0.45,0.54)    legend:Very_Strong_Typhoon_=_157–193_km/h_(97–119_mph)\nid:VITY   value:rgb(0.55,0.46,0.90)    legend:Violent_Typhoon_=_≥194_km/h_(≥120_mph)\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\nBarData =\nbarset:Hurricane\nbar:month\nPlotData=\nbarset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\nfrom:10/01/2014 till:20/01/2014 color:TS text:\"Lingling\"\nfrom:29/01/2014 till:01/02/2014 color:TS text:\"Kajiki\"\nfrom:27/02/2014 till:05/03/2014 color:STY text:\"Faxai\"\nfrom:11/03/2014 till:12/03/2014 color:TD text:\"TD\"\nfrom:18/03/2014 till:24/03/2014 color:TD text:\"Caloy\"\nfrom:02/04/2014 till:15/04/2014 color:TS text:\"Peipah\"\nfrom:19/04/2014 till:21/04/2014 color:TD text:\"TD\"\nfrom:27/04/2014 till:02/05/2014 color:ST text:\"Tapah\"\nfrom:09/06/2014 till:12/06/2014 color:TS text:\"Mitag\"\nfrom:13/06/2014 till:17/06/2014 color:TS text:\"Hagibis\"\nfrom:02/07/2014 till:11/07/2014 color:VSTY text:\"Neoguri\"\nfrom:09/07/2014 till:20/07/2014 color:VSTY text:\"Rammasun\"\nbarset:break\nfrom:16/07/2014 till:25/07/2014 color:STY text:\"Matmo\"\nfrom:19/07/2014 till:22/07/2014 color:TD text:\"TD\"\nfrom:27/07/2014 till:11/08/2014 color:VITY text:\"Halong\"\nfrom:28/07/2014 till:04/08/2014 color:ST text:\"Nakri\"\nfrom:07/08/2014 till:14/08/2014 color:VITY text:\"Genevieve\"\nfrom:19/08/2014 till:19/08/2014 color:TD text:\"TD\"\nfrom:24/08/2014 till:26/08/2014 color:TD text:\"TD\"\nfrom:27/08/2014 till:29/08/2014 color:TD text:\"TD\"\nfrom:04/09/2014 till:05/09/2014 color:TD text:\"TD\"\nfrom:05/09/2014 till:10/09/2014 color:ST text:\"Fengshen\"\nfrom:05/09/2014 till:08/09/2014 color:TD text:\"Karding\"\nfrom:11/09/2014 till:18/09/2014 color:STY text:\"Kalmaegi\"\nbarset:break\nfrom:17/09/2014 till:24/09/2014 color:TS text:\"Fung-wong\"\nfrom:23/09/2014 till:30/09/2014 color:ST text:\"Kammuri\"\nfrom:28/09/2014 till:06/10/2014 color:VSTY text:\"Phanfone\"\nfrom:02/10/2014 till:14/10/2014 color:VITY text:\"Vongfong\"\nfrom:30/10/2014 till:06/11/2014 color:VITY text:\"Nuri\"\nfrom:26/11/2014 till:30/11/2014 color:TS text:\"Sinlaku\"\nfrom:30/11/2014 till:12/12/2014 color:VITY text:\"Hagupit\"\nfrom:28/12/2014 till:01/01/2015 color:TS text:\"Jangmi\"\nbar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\nfrom:01/01/2014 till:01/02/2014 text:January\nfrom:01/02/2014 till:01/03/2014 text:February\nfrom:01/03/2014 till:01/04/2014 text:March\nfrom:01/04/2014 till:01/05/2014 text:April\nfrom:01/05/2014 till:01/06/2014 text:May\nfrom:01/06/2014 till:01/07/2014 text:June\nfrom:01/07/2014 till:01/08/2014 text:July\nfrom:01/08/2014 till:01/09/2014 text:August\nfrom:01/09/2014 till:01/10/2014 text:September\nfrom:01/10/2014 till:01/11/2014 text:October\nfrom:01/11/2014 till:01/12/2014 text:November\nfrom:01/12/2014 till:01/01/2015 text:December\nfrom:01/01/2015 till:01/02/2015 text:January 2015\nThe season has a relatively below-normal quantity of named storms, although a large number of those (eight) became super typhoons, including seven Category 5 storms. The season is not as active and costly as the previous season. During the first half of the season, it was active with seven storms forming due to a developing weak El Niño, however this failed during August. The most active month so far in the season is July; with four storms developing and made landfall, with three of them reaching super typhoon strength. With this, the season became quiet as of August 15, following the dissipation of Genevieve, although only few depressions formed but never strengthened into tropical storms. This continued until the first week of September, as the tropics within the basin started to get active again, with three tropical depressions in the same time. Tropical activity began to rise again during mid-September, although the season became quiet again after the dissipation of Vongfong, with a pause of Nuri's lifecycle.\nJanuary\nJanuary&nbsp;15\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC&nbsp;– The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) reports that a tropical depression has formed while located roughly  east of Surigao City, Philippines.\nJanuary&nbsp;18\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC&nbsp;– The JMA reports that the tropical depression previously located east of Surigao City has intensified into a tropical storm and names it \"Lingling\".
