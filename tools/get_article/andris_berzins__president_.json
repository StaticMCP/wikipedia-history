Aside from his native Latvian, he also speaks Russian and English fluently and German on a relatively good level. When questioned on his use of Russian instead of Latvian at certain events, he said that \"The question of language is often politicized, because it is a very cheap way to conduct an election campaign\". He has also encouraged Latvians to start to learn Russian alongside English.\nOn 3 September 2012, Bērziņš threatened TV news crew which was filming him coming alongside his son on the first day of the school year: \"Guys, you want me to beat you over the head?
