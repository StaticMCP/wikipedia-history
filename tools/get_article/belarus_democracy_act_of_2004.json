The act was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, by voice vote, on October 4, 2004; was passed by the U.S. Senate, by unanimous consent, on October 6, 2004; and was signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 20, 2004.  It is codified, as amended, at 22 U.S.C. 5811 note.\nThe law expresses the sense of Congress that the Belarusian authorities should not receive various types of non-humanitarian financial aid from the U.S. It also calls for the President to report to Congress on arms sales by Belarus to state sponsors of terrorism and on the personal wealth and assets of senior Belarus officials.\nThe U.S., said President Bush in his signing statement of October 20, 2004, \"will work with our allies and partners to assist those seeking to return Belarus to its rightful place among the Euro-Atlantic community of democracies.\"\nAll three bills were introduced by Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey.\nEarlier versions of the act that were introduced in 2001 and 2003 but not enacted into law were more severe, prohibiting travel of Belarusian officials, freezing assets, blocking certain trade, and referring to the role of Russia.\nAftermath\nSpokesman Richard Boucher of the U.S. Department of State stated, according to an October 26, 2004 editorial in the Voice of America, that the U.S. was concerned about the Belarusian government's increasingly repressive steps against independent news media and pro-democracy groups. He further stated that Belarusian security forces used excessive force against peaceful protesters following the parliamentary elections and referendum.\nBelarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and his government were highly displeased with the passage of the act.\nOn December 8, 2006, the United States House of Representatives passed, and (following Senate enactment) on January 12, 2007, President Bush signed into law, the Belarus Democracy Reauthorization Act of 2006, a statute amending and updating the act.\nOn January 3, 2012, President Obama signed into law the Belarus Democracy and Human Rights Act of 2011, further amending and updating the act.\nSee also\n* List of people and organizations sanctioned in relation to human rights violations in Belarus\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/house-bill/854 Belarus Democracy Act of 2004, H.R. 854, Public Law No. 108-347 (Oct. 20, 2004)]"
