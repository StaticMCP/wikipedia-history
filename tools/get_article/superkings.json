The name Superkings is derived from cigarettes that are larger than 84mm (king sized cigarettes); hence the name ‘Super kings’. The term is often used to describe any cigarette of regular gauge but with additional length to a king sized cigarette.\nBeing primarily marketed towards the working-class female smoker, the brand was the 9th most popular cigarette brand in the UK with 3.3% of the market share in 2007.\nA study showed that, compared with 2013 and 2014, the original Superkings is the most popular cigarette variant, followed by Superkings Menthol And Superkings Blue. Superkings Menthol were taken off the market in 2020 due to the EU Menthol ban, except for in Gibraltar where sale continues.\nMarkets\nSuperkings is sold in the United Kingdom. It has also been sold in Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Spain, Malta, Greece, Cyprus, Belarus, Russia, Australia and New Zealand.\nSee also\n* Tobacco smoking\nReferences"
