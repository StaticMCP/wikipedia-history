The introductory section translates as ] Lord Christ the father, Lord Robert Nevylle, with divine permission Bishop [] of Salisbury, presented and questioned and admitted to all documents and acts [alise act[is]}}] in the year of our lord one thousand 400th [] and twenty seventh [] and consecrated his first year [] receiving the temporalities following in the fullness of time []}}]]\nA bishop's (or archbishop's)|group=note}} register was a legal record of his correspondence and instructions to the outside world, and its legal position was that of a notarial record writ large. It was the bishop's main archive. Hill describes it as comprising three main elements: \"as formulae, as records of things which had been done, and as records of things which had been acquired\". But Hill also advises against treating it as a mere document of events, seeing it as \"a record of the use of a bishop's authority, and as such it was his greatest safeguard if that authority was challenged\".\nThe register was mostly composed as a book, often comprising several volumes, although in some instances they were recorded as roll, and handwritten by the Registrar, occasionally using both sides of the page. Ecclesiastical scholar Rosalind Hill suggests that the reason the book form became more popular among their creators was their increased tractability over a roll, which she describes as \"most inconvenient\". For example, in 1290, the Bishop of Lincoln's registrar, John de Scalleby, wrote himself an aide-memoire to the effect that, should he need to return to a specific item, it \"must be sought in various places in the roll of 1288 about the middle of the roll.\" De Scallesby seem to have been an innovator, and introduced a form of index calendar, particularly for letters dimissory, dispensations, indulgences, and new installations. The cross-referencing was elaborate.\nRegistrars appear to have occasionally had a staff of scribes. They began being created in the late 13th century; until then, there appears to have been little written down regarding the bishop's activities. Matters investigated and recorded included his visitations to monasteries and abbeys under his jurisdiction, often reporting on their chapter meetings and how the rule was enforced, The discipline of monks, nuns and priests was recorded, as were ordination lists recalling an individual's progress through the ranks of the church, and as to the inhabitancy of the institution—on occasion, the admission of children was recorded. They also recorded elections in religious houses and, conversely, the quashing of elections when the bishop deemed it necessary, as well as staffing matters. This included complaints of the \"dumping\" of nuns into often already impoverished abbeys, that is, placing unwanted daughters into religion. Fines handed out by the bishop's court are recorded as are licenses dispensed, such as those to beg. The most powerful tool in a bishop's armoury was excommunication; such instances of its imposition are also recorded. The register also contained instructions received by the bishop. The Pope might send dispensations, the archbishop his own instructions, and communications with the King, and while some of these might merely need storing in a safe place, others required frequent reference made to them. Benefices were important to record accurately as they were not only legal documents but conveyed rights of patronage to the receiver.\nAt the time, it was common for monasteries to act as secure storage for wealthy local families, and these contracts were often recorded into the registers for a small fee, including original charters and the inspeximi. Diocesan protection was considered stronger than that of a parish church or other house, as these were occasionally broken into and robbed. Registers were also used by contemporaries who sought evidence of past events in their pages and bishops had ready access to the registers of their predecessors.\nUse by historians\n's register as Archbishop of York was early enough in its creation to still be enrolled rather than bound; this is the first few membranes stitched together.|alt=Archbishop of York's enrolled register]]\nHistorian Eileen Power has demonstrated that \"much information about the conduct of abbesses and prioresses\" can be garnered from the registers and particularly the leadership's attempts to control a house's superior \"can be multiplied\" from the register mentions. She also warns, however, that often only the formulaic pro forma was recorded in the registry itself and that individual cases and their specific evidence was omitted. However, they may, on occasion, record the responses of individuals in whatever their chosen language (so, for example, illustrating cases of literacy among laymen). They occasionally contain or mention material from other bishop's registers which is yet now lost. Hill notes that, albeit unknown to us today, there may have been more than one copy of a register written, and also notes their bulk: Bishop Sutton's, for example, spread over eight volumes and comprised around two million words. In the 13th century, William de Wickwane, Archbishop of York, caused his registers to be written in duplicate.\nProblems\nEpiscopal registers generally focussed on issues that were brought to diocesan attention as being problematic. As a result, they may not reflect an accurate picture of the state of religion in the area. Similarly to court records, they record the complaints but not the positives. They were often heavily condensed versions of what had taken place; for example, an ordination—a multi-layered procedure—might only be recorded with a single line. As a result they often record the result of a process rather than the details of how the result was reached. Therefore, says Robert Swanson, \"much is committed and falls beneath their radar. All of the original paperwork has generally to be imagined.\"\nA problem faced by historians using registers, suggests Hill, is that certain items were considered more important than others and so preserved more efficiently. Visitations, for example, were \"of strictly temporary value\" compared with the bishop's letters and instructions, which were, in turn, better preserved. Relatively few have survived, and those that do come mainly from England. There are very few Welsh registers extant, and none whatsoever from Scotland.\nPublished episcopal registers\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!scope=\"col\"| Arms\n!scope=\"col\"| Arch/diocese\n!scope=\"col\"| Title\n!scope=\"col\"| Editor\n!scope=\"col\"| Notes\n!scope=\"col\"| Reference\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"6\"|\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"6\"| Bath and Wells\n| The Registers of Walter Giffard, Bishop of Bath and Wells, 1265–6, and of Henry Bowett, Bishop of Bath and Wells, 1401–1407\n| Thomas Scott Holmes\n| Somerset Record Society volume 13, 1899.\n|\n|-\n|Calendar of the register of John de Drokensford, bishop of Bath and Wells, A.D. 1309–1329\n| Edmund Hobhouse\n| Somerset Record Society volume 1, 1887\n|\n|-\n| The Register of Ralph of Shrewsbury, Bishop of Bath and Wells, 1329–1363\n| Thomas Scott Holmes\n| Somerset Record Society vols 9 & 10: 2 vols, 1896\n|\n|-\n| The Register of Nicholas Bubwith, Bishop of Bath and Wells, 1407–1424\n| Thomas Scott Holmes\n| Somerset Record Society vols 29 & 30: 2 vols, 1914\n|\n|-\n| The Register of John Stafford, Bishop of Bath and Wells, 1425–1443\n| Thomas Scott Holmes\n| Somerset Record Society vols 30 & 31\n|\n|-\n|  The Registers of Robert Stillington, Bishop of Bath and Wells, 1466–1491, and Richard Fox, Bishop of Bath and Wells, 1492–1494\n| Henry Maxwell Lyte\n| Somerset Record Society vol 52\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"!scope=\"row\"|\n!scope=\"row\"!scope=\"row\"| Canterbury\n| The Canterbury Archiepiscopates of John Stafford (1443–52) and John Kemp (1452–54) with Editions of their Registers\n| David Blair Foss\n| King's College, University of London PhD thesis, 1986\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"!scope=\"row\"|\n!scope=\"row\"!scope=\"row\"| Carlisle\n| The Episcopal Registers of Carlisle:  The Register of Bishop John de Halton\n| W.
