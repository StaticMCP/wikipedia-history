Demonware's products enable games publishers to outsource their networking requirements, allowing them to concentrate on playability. The organisation has its headquarters in Dublin, Ireland; and offices in Vancouver, Canada; Los Angeles, US; and Shanghai, China.\nHistory\nDemonware was founded in 2003 by Dylan Collins and Sean Blanchfield. In May 2007, the organisation was purchased by Activision. During the acquisition, Activision offered long-term contracts to the management team and employees of Demonware.\nProducts\nPrimary products developed by Demonware include the \"Demonware State Engine\" and \"Matchmaking+\". The State Engine is a high-performance state synchronization C++ programming framework that eliminates the need to reinvent netcode in multiplayer games.
