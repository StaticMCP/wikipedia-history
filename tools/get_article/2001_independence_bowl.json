The competing teams were the Alabama Crimson Tide, representing the Southeastern Conference (SEC), and the  Iowa State Cyclones of the Big 12 Conference (Big 12). Alabama won the game, 14–13 in what was the first all-time game between the programs. It was also the first bowl game for Dennis Franchione at Alabama and the second bowl game for Dan McCarney at Iowa State.\nTeams\nAlabama\nThe 2001 Alabama squad finished the regular season with a 6–5 record  in head coach Dennis Franchione's first season leading the Crimson Tide.  Through eight games, the Crimson Tide were 3–5 with losses to UCLA, South Carolina, Ole Miss, Tennessee and LSU. However, Alabama was able to win their final three games against Mississippi State, Auburn and Southern Miss to finish the regular season bowl eligible with a 6–5 record.\nOn December 9, Alabama accepted a bid to play in the Independence Bowl for the first time in school history. There was some controversy with the selection of Alabama instead over Ole Miss, as the Rebels (which did not go to a bowl in 2001) had beaten Alabama that year and had a better record of 7–4.  Presumably, Alabama was selected because it had a larger fan base and Ole Miss had just played in the Independence Bowl in 1998 and 1999. The appearance marked the 51st all-time bowl appearance for Alabama.\nIowa State\nIowa State finished the regular season with a 7–4 record with losses against Nebraska, Texas A&M, Kansas State and Colorado. On December 9, Iowa State accepted a bid to play in the Independence Bowl for the first time in school history. The appearance marked the sixth all-time bowl appearance for the Cyclones.\nGame summary\nIowa State scored first on a 36-yard Tony Yelk field goal to lead 3–0 in the first quarter. After reaching the 1-yard line on a 33-yard catch by Lane Danielsen to close the quarter, the Cyclones scored the game's first touchdown on a 1-yard run by Joe Woodley, for a 10–0 lead.  Alabama responded later in the quarter with an 8-yard touchdown run by Andrew Zow to close the gap to 10–7. Yelk missed a 25-yard field goal with 26 seconds remaining in the quarter, to keep the score 10–7 at the half.\nThird quarter scoring was limited to a 41-yard Yelk field goal to bring the Cyclones' lead to 13–7 heading into the fourth. With 5:31 remaining in the game, Waine Bacon blocked a Yelk punt and Alabama recovered at the Iowa State 29-yard line. Two plays later, Zow hit Terry Jones for a 27-yard touchdown reception, and the extra point gave the Crimson Tide a 14–13 lead.\nThe Cyclones drove and attempted a late field goal. The kick sailed over the upright and was ruled no good. The victory sent Alabama to a 7–5 overall record for the season.\nReferences"
