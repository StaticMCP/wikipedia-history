Linkin Park started Projekt Revolution in the year 2002 with just one stage. Then, in 2004, they announced the Revolution Stage (Second Stage) where the smaller bands/artists would perform.\n2002\n2002 brought Linkin Park the idea to plan the Projekt Revolution Tour series, and the series began in that year. They thought it was part festival tour, part concert tour, part national tour. It is the first of the Projekt Revolution Tour Series. For this edition, Linkin Park was supporting their debut album, Hybrid Theory. It was also one of the shortest of the PR Series.\n* Main Stage\n** Linkin Park\n** Cypress Hill\n** Adema\n** DJ Z-Trip (Except the first two shows)\nSetlist\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"width:150px;\"| Date\n! style=\"width:150px;\"| City\n! style=\"width:150px;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:250px;\"| Venue\n|-\n| January 29, 2002\n| Colorado Springs\n|rowspan=\"19\"|United States\n| World Arena\n|-\n| January 30, 2002\n| Wichita\n| Kansas Coliseum\n|-\n| February 1, 2002\n| Chicago\n| UIC Pavilion\n|-\n| February 2, 2002\n| Madison\n| Alliant Energy Center Memorial Coliseum\n|-\n| February 4, 2002\n| Detroit\n| Cobo Arena\n|-\n| February 5, 2002\n| Dayton\n| Nutter Center\n|-\n| February 7, 2002\n| Wilkes-Barre\n| First Union Arena\n|-\n| February 8, 2002\n| Uniondale\n| Nassau Coliseum\n|-\n| February 9, 2002\n| State College\n| Bryce Jordan Center\n|-\n| February 11, 2002\n| Lowell\n| Tsongas Arena\n|-\n| February 12, 2002\n| Fairfax\n| Patriot Center\n|-\n| February 13, 2002\n| Philadelphia\n| First Union Center\n|-\n| February 16, 2002\n| Memphis\n| Mid-South Coliseum\n|-\n| February 17, 2002\n| Dallas\n| Fort Worth Convention Center\n|-\n| February 18, 2002\n| Oklahoma City\n| Fairgrounds Arena\n|-\n| February 20, 2002\n| Phoenix\n| American West Arena\n|-\n| February 22, 2002\n| Long Beach\n| Long Beach Arena\n|-\n| February 23, 2002\n| San Diego\n| Cox Arena\n|-\n| February 24, 2002\n| Las Vegas\n| Thomas & Mack Center\n|}\n2003\nThe 2003 Projekt Revolution Tour, was the shortest of the PR tour series until the 2011 edition.

It was divided into the Main Stage and Revolution stages, while its set stays connected. The 2004 PR Tour was the longest of the Projekt Revolution Tour series. This was also Korn's last tour to feature their full original lineup with original guitarist Brian Welch, who leaves the band in February the following year until his return in 2013. Jonathan Davis of Korn would come out on \"One Step Closer\" to sing the reanimated part of the song.\n* Main Stage\n** Linkin Park\n** Korn\n** Snoop Dogg\n** The Used\n** Less Than Jake (except the Dallas show due to one of the band members being sick.

There were also informative booths that showed concert goers how to lower their greenhouse gas emissions.\nIt was revealed in Revolver magazine that Muse was in the list of bands Linkin Park had picked but couldn't join Projekt Revolution as they had other commitments to deal with.\nOn August 22, 2007, MySpace.com streamed the concert live, allowing MySpace users to watch the concert for free from their performance at DTE Energy Music Theatre in Clarkston, Michigan. The event was hosted by Matt Pinfield.\nLinkin Park sold their performance from the 2007 PR tour at the merchandise booth. Each CD came with a blank disc and a special code that allowed fans to download and burn that specific Linkin Park performance from the venue it was purchased at. The price of purchase for the CD was $11.00. It was sold at every venue except for Jones Beach in Wantagh, NY due to disagreements with the venue wanting a portion of the CD sales.\n* Main Stage\n** Linkin Park\n** My Chemical Romance\n** Taking Back Sunday\n** HIM\n** Placebo\n** Julien-K\n* Revolution Stage\n** Mindless Self Indulgence\n** Saosin\n** The Bled\n** Styles of Beyond (didn't join the tour until 10 August)\n** Madina Lake (missed shows from 10 to 13 August due to Summer Sonic 2007)\n**Art of Chaos (Winner of the Battle of the Bands selected to 7 dates on the tour from 28 July to 5 August)\nSetlist\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"width:150px;\"| Date\n! style=\"width:150px;\"| City\n! style=\"width:150px;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:250px;\"| Venue\n|-\n|July 25, 2007\n|Auburn\n|rowspan=\"19\"|United States\n|White River Amphitheatre\n|-\n|July 27, 2007\n|Marysville\n|Sleep Train Amphitheatre\n|-\n|July 28, 2007\n|San Bernardino\n|Hyundai Pavilion\n|-\n|July 29, 2007\n|Mountain View\n|Shoreline Amphitheatre\n|-\n|July 31, 2007\n|Chula Vista\n|Coors Amphitheatre\n|-\n|August 1, 2007\n|Phoenix\n|Cricket Pavilion\n|-\n|August 3, 2007\n|Selma\n|Verizon Wireless Amphitheater\n|-\n|August 4, 2007\n|Dallas\n|Smirnoff Music Centre\n|-\n|August 5, 2007\n|The Woodlands\n|The Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion\n|-\n|August 7, 2007\n|Atlanta\n|HiFi Buys Amphitheatre\n|-\n|August 8, 2007\n|Charlotte\n|Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre\n|-\n|August 10, 2007\n|West Palm Beach\n|Sound Advice Amphitheatre\n|-\n|August 11, 2007\n|Tampa\n|Ford Amphitheatre\n|-\n|August 13, 2007\n|Raleigh\n|Walnut Creek Amphitheatre\n|-\n|August 14, 2007\n|Virginia Beach\n|Verizon Wireless Virginia Beach Amphitheater\n|-\n|August 15, 2007\n|Wantagh\n|Nikon at Jones Beach Theater\n|-\n|August 17, 2007\n|Cuyahoga Falls\n|Blossom Music Center\n|-\n|August 18, 2007\n|Darien\n|Darien Lake Performing Arts Center\n|-\n|August 19, 2007\n|Bristow\n|Nissan Pavilion\n|-\n|August 21, 2007\n|Toronto\n|Canada\n|Molson Amphitheatre\n|-\n|August 22, 2007\n|Clarkston\n|rowspan=\"9\"|United States\n|DTE Energy Music Theatre\n|-\n|August 24, 2007\n|Mansfield\n|Tweeter Center for the Performing Arts\n|-\n|August 25, 2007\n|Camden\n|Tweeter Center at the Waterfront\n|-\n|August 26, 2007\n|Hartford\n|New England Dodge Music Center\n|-\n|August 28, 2007\n|Syracuse\n|NY State Fair\n|-\n|August 29, 2007\n|Holmdel\n|PNC Bank Arts Center\n|-\n|August 31, 2007\n|Noblesville\n|Verizon Wireless Music Center\n|-\n|September 1, 2007\n|Tinley Park\n|First Midwest Bank Amphitheatre\n|-\n|September 3, 2007\n|Greenwood Village\n|Coors Amphitheatre\n|}\n2008\nThis was the first time the tour was also outside of North America. Their performance in Milton Keynes was announced months beforehand, which made it highly anticipated amongst fans waiting to attend. Jay-Z came out and performed a modified \"Numb/Encore\" and \"Jigga What/Faint\" with the band. This show turned out to be the biggest capacity Projekt Revolution to date. Camera operators obtaining interviews revealed intentions for a DVD, which has been confirmed by Mike Shinoda to be a CD/DVD set on November 25, 2008. Shinoda posted on the band's online forum that anyone 18 or older can submit a title for the live CD/DVD which will later be turned into a poll for fans to vote for their favorite. Concerning the release date, Shinoda stated \"we will be releasing it in a DVD/CD combo pack as soon as we can get it done\".\nEurope:\n* June 21, 2008 – Reitstadion Riem, Munich, Germany\n** Linkin Park\n** HIM\n** N*E*R*D\n** The Used\n** The Blackout\nSetlist\n* June 27, 2008 – Waldbühne, Berlin, Germany\n** Linkin Park\n** HIM\n** N*E*R*D\n* June 28, 2008 – LTU Arena, Düsseldorf, Germany\n** Linkin Park\n** HIM\n** N*E*R*D\n** The Used\n** The Bravery\n** Innerpartysystem\n* June 29, 2008 – National Bowl, Milton Keynes, England\n** Linkin Park\n** Jay-Z\n** Pendulum\n** N*E*R*D\n** Enter Shikari\n** The Bravery\n** Innerpartysystem\nSetlist\nUS:\n* Main Stage:\n** Linkin Park\n** Chris Cornell (of Soundgarden)\n** The Bravery\n** Busta Rhymes (left the tour – See Controversy during 2008 Tour)\n** Ashes Divide\n** Street Drum Corps (originally opened the Revolution Stage but were moved to the main stage)\n* Revolution Stage:\n** Atreyu\n** 10 Years\n** Hawthorne Heights\n** Armor for Sleep\nLinkin Park changed the set-lists up a little bit, giving new intros and outros to a few songs and playing \"We Made It\" every show, until Busta Rhymes left the tour.

Shinoda later posted on his blog that he and the rest of his band were disappointed to see Rhymes leave, implying that the rumour was false. Busta actually left the tour due to an argument with his now former label Interscope Records. Since he left the label, he no longer had support to be on the tour.\n2011\nThis was the shortest Projekt Revolution to date, with only four shows in Europe. This tour was done by Linkin Park, Dredg and Middle Class Rut.\n* June 16, 2011 – Kaisaniemi Park, Helsinki, Finland with Die Antwoord\n* June 18, 2011 – Festwiese, Leipzig, Germany with Guano Apes and Anberlin\n* June 19, 2011 – Hessentagsarena, Oberursel, Germany with Anberlin and Die Antwoord\n* June 25, 2011 – Messegelände München Riem, Munich, Germany with Guano Apes and Anberlin\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071020043744/http://www.projektrevolution.com/mediaplayer/ Projekt Revolution Media Player]\n* [http://www.projektrevolution.ru/ Projekt Revolution Russia]\n* [http://www.linkinparkru.com/ Linkin Park Network Russia]"
