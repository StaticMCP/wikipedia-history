Its original form was designed by Captain Galo B. Ocampo, secretary of the Philippine Heraldry Committee, and patterned after the seal of the president of the United States. It was first used by President Manuel Roxas in 1947.\nDescription and symbolism\nThe seal is composed of the coat of arms of the president, which, according to Executive Order No. 310 of 2004 consists of:\nRegarding the design of the seal, the executive order states the following:\nSome of the symbols in the arms are derived from the national flag, and retain their meaning. The eight-rayed sun represent the eight provinces placed under martial law in 1896 at the onset of the Philippine Revolution. On the sun there is an equilateral triangle (colored red as opposed to the flag's white), representing liberty, equality, and fraternity, which were ideals of the Revolution. The stars at the corners of the triangle represent the three major island groups of Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.\nAt the center of the coat of arms is a sea-lion, which is derived from the coat of arms of the city of Manila granted by King Philip II of Spain in 1596. It has the upper half of a lion, and the lower half and curled tail of a fish. The sea-lion as a heraldic device ultimately comes from the lion on the coat of arms of Castile and León; since the islands were an overseas (ultramar) possession, the lion became a sea lion.\nUses\nFlight PR001 during President Rodrigo Duterte's official visit to Myanmar in March 2017.]]\nSection 3 of Executive Order No. 310 outlines the following provisions regarding the use of the presidential seal and associated insignia:\nThe seal is prominently used on presidential lecterns, the official state car and aircraft, and most notably on official documents and correspondence. The coat of arms (without the encircling title) is displayed on the presidential standard, on the carpet in the Reception Hall of Malacañan Palace, on the official seal of the Presidential Security Command (minus the ring of stars), and in various commemorative coins honoring former presidents.\nHistory\nThe first presidential seal\nThe seal was first used by President Manuel Roxas in 1947. It was designed by Captain Galo B. Ocampo of the Philippine Heraldry Committee, who also designed the coat of arms of the Philippines. The seal was officially prescribed on January 7, 1947, when Executive Order No. 38 of 1947 was signed. It prescribed the coat of arms and seal of the president as:\nOn July 4, 1951, President Elpidio Quirino, signed Executive Order No. 457 into law prescribing that:\n:\nAt the time of signing, the Philippines had 52 provinces.\nThe 1981 redesign\nIn 1981, President Ferdinand Marcos had the seal redesigned, inverting the triangle and replacing the sea lion with an eagle. The most frequently used seals are those featuring  the text in Filipino and in script.\nThe new design of the coat of arms was adapted into the presidential flag after some time.\nRestoration of the Ocampo design\ndelivering a speech before base workers at a rally at Remy Field, Olongapo City in 1992. Note the use of the pre-1981 design with the text in Filipino.]]\nIn the wake of the 1986 People Power Revolution, President Corazon Aquino abolished the use of many symbols of the Marcos regime, including his presidential seal, and restored the 1951 version of the Ocampo design.\nOn August 27, 1998, President Joseph Estrada signed Executive Order No. 19, amending Executive Order No. 38 of 1947 (as amended) as the number of provinces has increased to 78 and that there is a need to synchronize the number of stars to match the number of provinces at a given time.\nAfter Estrada's executive order came into effect, Roxas's executive order read:\nOn April 20, 2004, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed Executive Order No. 310, which standardized the seal and its derivative material. The seal as it appears on government documents and property has since been redesigned to conform with the executive order.\nAs of 2022, the number of provinces in the Philippines increased to 82 with the partition of Maguindanao into Maguindanao del Norte and Maguindanao del Sur. However, official seals currently in use continue to feature the 80-star version of the 2004 design.\nSee also\n*President of the Philippines\n*Seal of the vice president of the Philippines\n*Coat of arms of the Philippines\n*Flag of the president of the Philippines\n*Flag of the Philippines\nReferences\n* [https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1947/01/07/executive-order-no-38-s-1947/ Executive Order No. 38, s. 1947] Official Gazette\n* [https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1951/07/04/executive-order-no-457-s-1951/ Executive Order No. 457, s. 1951] Official Gazette\n* [https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1998/08/27/executive-order-no-19-s-1998/ Executive Order No. 19, s. 1998] Official Gazette\n* [https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2004/04/20/executive-order-no-310/ Executive Order No. 310, s. 2004] Official Gazette\n* [http://www.quezon.ph/?p=111 The Presidential Seal]\n* [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ph-pres.html#seal Philippines: President and Vice President]\n* [http://www.worthpoint.com/item/presentation-box-president-philippines A presentation box with the Presidential Seal, circa 1969:  \"This seal predates the (1981) change in the presidential seal ordered by Ferdinand Marcos during his tenure as president.\"]"
