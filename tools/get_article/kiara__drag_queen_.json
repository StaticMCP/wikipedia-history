He began performing drag at Cabaret Mado, including as Mel B in a regular Spice Girls tribute show, choosing the drag name Kiara in reference to the character Kiara from The Lion King.\nCareer\nKiara appeared on the first season of ''Canada's Drag Race'', and was eliminated from the competition in the fifth episode after performing a poor impression of Mariah Carey in the Snatch Game challenge; however, her Lip Sync for Your Life performance against Priyanka, to Céline Dion's cover of \"I Drove All Night\", was widely labelled as the best lipsync battle of the season and one of the best in the history of the Drag Race franchise. In a post-elimination interview with the entertainment website PopBuzz, Kiara revealed that she had considered impersonating ''Canada's Drag Race'' judge Stacey McKenzie.\nOn June 24, 2020, after production on ''Canada's Drag Race had wrapped but before the series had begun airing, Kiara was the host of Sainte-Jeanne, an LGBTQ-themed Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day celebration coordinated by singer-songwriter Safia Nolin, whose participants also included comedians Tranna Wintour and Karl Hardy, actress and writer Gabrielle Tremblay, songwriter and producer Annie Sama (Apigeon), rapper Backxwash and drag queens Matante Alex and Gisèle Lullaby. For the special online edition of Fierté Montréal's Drag Superstars show, which saw all of the queens from ''Canada's Drag Race'' appearing in prerecorded video performances, Kiara performed to Marie-Mai's single \"Qui prendra ma place\" in a video which climaxed with her dancing in front of the Montreal Biosphere.\nFollowing the conclusion of the season, Kiara participated in the national Canada's Drag Race Live at the Drive-In tour.\nIn October 2020, Kiara appeared in the video for Cœur de pirate's single \"T'es belle\". In the same month, Kiara released her first single as a vocalist, a bilingual collaboration with Matante Alex and Marc-André Sauvageau titled \"Straight to Your Heart\" in English and \"Droit sur ton cœur\" in French.\nKiara also had a small acting role in \"The Son\", an LGBT-themed episode of the 2020 television anthology series Little America.\nShe is an active ballroom participant and part of the Canadian chapter of the Imperial Dynasty Kiki House of Hua Mulan, where she holds the title of \"Princess\".\nFilmography\nTelevision\n* ''Canada's Drag Race (season 1)\n* Bring Back My Girls'' (2022)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
