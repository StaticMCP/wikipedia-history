William Cole wrote that he wrote much of his work in Cambridge, where he ran a coffee house, and then moved to London. He told Cole that he had spent time at sea, and in both the East and West Indies for some time. He also travelled in Europe.\nIn 1739–40 Salmon accompanied George Anson on his voyage round the world. He died on 20 January 1767.\nWorks\nSalmon's works were:\n* A Review of the History of England, as far as it relates to the Titles and Pretensions of four several Kings, and their Respective Characters, from the Conquest to the Revolution, London, 1722; 2nd ed. 2 vols.

Only one volume appeared, containing the history of the county, city, and university of Oxford.\n* General Description of England, and particularly of London, the Metropolis, mentioned in the preface of the previous work, 2 vols.\n* The Modern Gazetteer, or a short View of the several Nations of the World, London, 1746; 3rd ed.

To it he prefixed a preface commenting on the partisan approaches of Paul de Rapin de Thoyras and other historians.\nEditor of State Trials\nSalmon is now credited as the initial editor of the State Trials, the collection of reports on significant trials, mostly on treason charges, that had editions well into the 19th century. Sollom Emlyn continued his five volumes, which were reprinted whole in 1730, with two more in 1735. Francis Hargrave, in a preface to the 4th edition, was explicit about Salmon's involvement in the 1738 Critical Review of the Trials. He deduced that Salmon was editor of the first edition, in 1719. He commented also on the effect of Salmon's Tory politics on the work; and (positively) on the sourcing he provided for some of the material. This identification of Salmon as original editor is now accepted. He was working for the printer John Darby the younger (died 1733) from about 1716, on materials Darby provided. His initial shaping of the collection persisted across numerous later editions.\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=vG5UAAAAYAAJ A Complete Collection of State Trials, vol I: 1388–1648] (1730)\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=VQtDAAAAcAAJ A Complete Collection of State Trials, vol V: 1696–1709] (1730)\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=mUBWAAAAYAAJ A Complete Collection of State Trials, vol VII (supplement): 1549–1688] (1735)\nNotes\n;Attribution"
