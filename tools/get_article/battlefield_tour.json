It is Sparks' first headlining tour. The tour consisted of mostly general assembly venues such as theaters, ballrooms, amusement parks, and casinos. It was initially only set to visit 15 cities nationwide. On April 22, several dates were rescheduled in order to expand the tour to 39 cities across the nation. The tour started on May 1, 2010, in Uncasville, Connecticut and ended on July 18, 2010, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In an interview with AI Now, Sparks spoke of the tour \"Hopefully, maybe in March I will be doing a tour. I would love to do a House of Blues theater type tour so it’s a little more intimate...it’s really fulfilling after you get off a stage like that, it’s really awesome because it’s like you can say 'hey, I left everything out there.'\"\nSupporting acts\n* Kate Voegele was the opening act on selected tour dates until June 25, 2010.\n* Days Difference, a pop rock band, were also an opening act on selected dates of the tour.\n* Ashlyne Huff replaced Kate Voegele as the opening act on June 26, 2010.\n* Sid Curtis replaced Ashlyne Huff for one night, on July 10, 2010.\nGuest appearances\n* Australian artist, Guy Sebastian made a guest appearance at three of Sparks' concerts in San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco from July 8 to July 10, 2010, performing their single \"Art of Love\" together\nSet list\nGuy Sebastian & Sparks performing \"Art of Love\" in Los Angeles.\nSparks during Battlefield Tour.\n#\"Battlefield\"\n#\"S.O.S.
