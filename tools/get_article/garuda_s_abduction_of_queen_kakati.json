The royal solar bird Garuda came to the court disguised as a man and gambled with the king. He then became enamored of the queen and abducted her. He carried her off to his nest by the Simbali-Lake and there lived with her.\nWhen Garuda heard of the king's great sadness and of his true love for Kakati, he restored her to him.\nThe story is one of those related by the bird Kunala, in the kunala Jataka. The story is also very close to that of the Sussondi Jataka.\nAccording to Buddhist mythology, the Garudas were enemies to the nāga, a race of intelligent serpents, whom they hunt.  The Garudas at one time caught the nāgas by seizing them by their heads; but the nāgas learned that by swallowing large stones, they could make themselves too heavy to be carried by the Garudas, wearing them out and killing them from exhaustion.  This secret was divulged to one of the Garudas by the ascetic Karambiya, who taught him how to seize a nāga by the tail and force him to vomit up his stone (Pandara Jātaka, J.518).\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 auto;\"  align=\"center\"  colspan=1 cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 80%; width: 100%;\"\n|align=\"center\" colspan=1 style=\"background:#F4A460; font-size: 100%;\"| Garuda in the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara\n|-\n|\nFile:Gandhara, garuda adduce la regina kakati, periodo kushan 200-400.JPG|Garuda's abduction of Queen Kakati.
