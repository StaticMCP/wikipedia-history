The abnormalities in the arm lead to restriction of movement in the elbow.\nPresentation\nThese include\n* Growth retardation\n* Microcephaly\n* Cleft lip and palate\n* Minor vertebral and rib anomalies\n* Horseshoe kidneys\n* Thumb anomalies\n* Triphalangeal thumb\n* Radial ray anomalies\nGenetics\nThis syndrome is caused by mutations in the establishment of cohesion 1 homolog 2 (ESCO2) gene. This gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 8 (8p21.1). Mutations in this gene also cause Roberts/SC phocomelia syndrome.\nJuberg–Hayward syndrome  is inherited in both an autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant fashion.\nDiagnosis\nHistory\nThis condition was first described in 1969 by Juberg and Hayward.\nReferences\nExternal links\n-->\n| ICD9            =\n| ICDO            =\n| OMIM            = 216100\n| MedlinePlus     =\n| eMedicineSubj   =\n| eMedicineTopic  =\n| MeshID          =\n| Orphanet        =\n| SNOMED CT       =\n}}"
