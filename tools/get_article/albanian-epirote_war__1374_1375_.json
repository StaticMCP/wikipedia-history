During their campaign, Pjetër laid a three-year siege on the Ioannina. In 1370, the siege and thus the war ended with a ceasefire, in which Thomas's daughter Irina, was forced to marry Gjin, son of Pjetër Losha. In 1374, Pjetër Losha died of the plague in Arta, after which Gjon Bua Shpata took over the city. At this time, he was not bound by an agreement with Thomas; he waged war against Thomas in the same year.\nWar\nShpata quickly invaded Thomas's realm. Thomas's forces met Shpata's army near Arta, where Shpata decisively defeated the army of Thomas. Thomas then withdrew and barricaded himself in his capital of Ioannina. Not soon after that, Shpata laid siege to Ioannina and ravaged the country-side. The siege only ended when Thomas brought peace by betrothening his sister Helena to Gjon Bua Shpata the following year.\nAftermath\nAlthough Shpata made peace with Thomas, the Malakasi, who were an Albanian tribe acting independently and stood under no order from Shpata, continued to fight with Thomas until they were finally defeated in 1377 and 1379.\nReferences"
