He was a late-maturing horse who did not emerge as a top-class performer until the autumn of his three-year-old season when he won the Kikuka Sho. Over the next three years he proved himself one of the best stayers in Japan with wins in the Tenno Sho (twice), Takarazuka Kinen, Osaka Hai, Kyōto Daishōten (twice) and Hanshin Daishoten (twice). He won the JRA Award for Best Older Male Horse in 1991 and was inducted into the Japan Racing Association Hall of Fame shortly after his retirement from racing.\nBackground\nMejiro McQueen was a grey horse bred in Japan by Katashi Yoshida. During his racing career he was owned by Mejiro Shouji Co Ltd and trained by Yasuo Ikee.\nMejiro McQueen was the best horse sired by Mejiro Titan, who won the Tenno Sho in 1982. His dam Mejiro Aurora showed modest racing ability, winning one minor race from 24 starts but did better as a broodmare and also produced the Kikuka Sho winner Mejiro Durren. She was descended from the British broodmare Astonishment, who was imported to Japan in the first decade of the 20th century.\nRacing career\nMejiro McQueen did not race as a two-year-old but made a successful racecourse debut over 1700 metres on dirt in February 1990 at Hanshin Racecourse. He was beaten in his next three starts before taking two minor races at Hakodate Racecourse in September. On the 4th of November at Kyoto Racecourse he recorded his first major success in his last run of the year when he took the 3000 metre Kikuka Sho.\nOn his first appearance as a four-year-old, Mejiro McQueen won the Grade 2 Hanshin Daishoten at Chukyo Racecourse, setting a record time of 3:07.3 for the 3000 metre turf course. In April at Kyoto he took his second Grade 1 prize as he won the spring edition of the Tenno Sho over 3200 metres. When dropped in trip for the Takarazuka Kinen over 2200 metres in June he ran well again, but was beaten into second place by Mejiro Ryan. After the customary summer break he returned in October to win the Grade 2 Kyoto Daishoten and then finished first in the autumn Tenno Sho. In the latter race, however, he was disqualified and placed last of the eighteen runners: he had been drawn on the outside and hampered several horses when his jockey tracked over to the inside rail just after the start. He put up good efforts in defeat on his last two starts that year, coming home fourth behind the American horse Golden Pheasant in the Japan Cup and finishing a close second to Dai Yusaku in the Arima Kinen. In the JRA Awards for 1991 he was voted the year's Best Older Male Horse.\nMejiro McQueen's 1992 campaign was restricted to two races, but he won them both. He began by taking the Hanshin Daishoten for the second successive year. On the 26th of April at Kyoto he followed up his 1991 success by winning the spring Tenno Sho for a second time. Injury complications kept the horse off the track for the rest of the year.\nAfter an absence of more than eleven months Mejiro McQueen returned in April 1993 and won the Grade 2 Osaka Hai at Hanshin in a record time of 2:03.2. His attempt to win an unprecedented third edition of the spring Tenno Sho narrowly failed as he finished second of the fifteen runners behind Rice Shower. On the 13th of June at Hanshin he won the Takarazuka Kinen at the second attempt to record his fourth Grade 1 success. He returned in October to win a second Kyoto Daishoten in a record time of 2:22.7  in what proved to be his final start. After winning the Kyoto Daishoten, McQueen was diagnosed with degenerative suspensory ligament desmitis just four days before he was scheduled to run in the Autumn Tenno Sho. This ultimately proved to be the reason why he retired in Autumn 1993.\nThroughout Mejiro McQueen's racing career, spanning from 1990 to 1993, his record was 21 starts, 12 first place finish, 6 second place, 1 third place, and 2 other place finishes and his total earnings was ¥1,014,657,700 JPY. McQueen was the first horse to win over a billion yen. In 1994 Mejiro McQueen was inducted into the Japan Racing Association Hall of Fame.\nStud record\nMejiro McQueen was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at Shadai Stallion Station. He has sired the Grade 3 winners Time Fair Lady and Eidai Queen. He performed a valuable service at stud as he formed a close bond with Sunday Silence and acted as a calming influence on the hitherto obstreperous American stallion. Mejiro McQueen's daughters did well as broodmares and he was the damsire of Dream Journey, Orfevre and Gold Ship. He died in 2006 on his 19th birthday.\nStatistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%; width: 90%; text-align: center;\"\n!Date\n!Track\n!Name\n!Grade\n!Type/Distance\n!Field\n!Finished\n!Time\n!Jockey\n!Winner (2nd Place)\n|-style=\"background-color:white\"\n| colspan=\"13\" align=\"left\" |1990 &ndash; four-year-old season\n|-\n|\n|Hanshin\n|Debut\n|Maiden\n|Dirt 1700m\n|10\n|1st\n|1:47.7\n|Yoshiyuki Muramoto\n|(Hagino Legend)\n|-\n|\n|Hanshin\n|Yukiyanagi Sho\n|\n|Turf 2000m\n|13\n|2nd\n|2:04.6\n|Yoshiyuki Muramoto\n|Symbolideva\n|-\n|\n|Kyoto\n|Ayame Sho\n|\n|Turf 1800m\n|3\n|3rd\n|2:17.5\n|Yoshiyuki Muramoto\n|Houyu Royal\n|-\n|\n|Hakodate\n|Oshima Special\n|\n|Dirt 1700m\n|2\n|2nd\n|1:46.6\n|Koichi Uchida\n|Manjuden Kabuto\n|-\n|\n|Hakodate\n|Kikonai Special\n|\n|Dirt 1700m\n|4\n|1st\n|1:47.3\n|Koichi Uchida\n|(Rixan Royal)\n|-\n|\n|Hakodate\n|Onuma Stakes\n|Open\n|Turf 2000m\n|12\n|1st\n|2:04.5\n|Koichi Uchida\n|(Tosho Eye)\n|-\n|\n|Kyoto\n|Arashiyama Stakes\n|Open\n|Turf 3000m\n|5\n|2nd\n|3:06.6\n|Koichi Uchida\n|Mister Adams\n|-\n|\n|Kyoto\n|Kikuka Sho\n|G1\n|Turf 3000m\n|2\n|1st\n|3:06.2\n|Koichi Uchida\n|(White Stone)\n|-style=\"background-color:white\"\n| colspan=\"13\" align=\"left\" |1991 &ndash; five-year-old season\n|-\n|\n|Chukyo\n|Hanshin Daishōten\n|G2\n|Turf 3000m\n|4\n|1st\n|3:07.3\n|Yutaka Take\n|(Go Sign)\n|-\n|\n|Kyoto\n|Tenno Sho (Spring)\n|G1\n|Turf 3200m\n|15\n|1st\n|3:18.8\n|Yutaka Take\n|(Mister Adams)\n|-\n|\n|Kyoto\n|Takarazuka Kinen\n|G1\n|Turf 2200m\n|10\n|2nd\n|2:13.8\n|Yutaka Take\n|Mejiro Ryan\n|-\n|\n|Kyoto\n|Kyōto Daishōten\n|G2\n|Turf 2400m\n|4\n|1st\n|2:26.5\n|Yutaka Take\n|(Meisho Vitoria)\n|-\n|\n|Tokyo\n|Tenno Sho (Autumn)\n|G1\n|Turf 2000m\n|13\n|18th (*)\n|2:02.9\n|Yutaka Take\n|Prekrasnie\n|-\n|\n|Tokyo\n|Japan Cup\n|G1\n|Turf 2400m\n|5\n|4th\n|2:25.3\n|Yutaka Take\n|Golden Pheasant\n|-\n|\n|Nakayama\n|Arima Kinen\n|G1\n|Turf 2500m\n|1\n|2nd\n|2:30.8\n|Yutaka Take\n|Daiyusaku\n|-style=\"background-color:white\"\n| colspan=\"13\" align=\"left\" |1992 &ndash; six-year-old season\n|-\n|\n|Hanshin\n|Hanshin Daishōten\n|G2\n|Turf 3000m\n|4\n|1st\n|3:13.8\n|Yutaka Take\n|(Kamino Cresse)\n|-\n|\n|Kyoto\n|Tenno Sho (Spring)\n|G1\n|Turf 3200m\n|5\n|1st\n|3:20.0\n|Yutaka Take\n|(Kamino Cresse)\n|-style=\"background-color:white\"\n| colspan=\"13\" align=\"left\" |1993 &ndash; seven-year-old season\n|-\n|\n|Hanshin\n|Ōsaka Hai\n|G2\n|Turf 2000m\n|13\n|1st\n|2:03.3\n|Yutaka Take\n|(Nice Nature)\n|-\n|\n|Kyoto\n|Tenno Sho (Spring)\n|G1\n|Turf 3200m\n|14\n|2nd\n|3:17.5\n|Yutaka Take\n|Rice Shower\n|-\n|\n|Hanshin\n|Takarazuka Kinen\n|G1\n|Turf 2200m\n|6\n|1st\n|2:17.7\n|Yutaka Take\n|(Ikuno Dictus)\n|-\n|\n|Kyoto\n|Kyōto Daishōten\n|G2\n|Turf 2400m\n|1\n|1st\n|2:22.7\n|Yutaka Take\n|(Legacy World)\n|}\n(*) Demoted from 1st.\nPedigree\nIn popular culture\nMejiro McQueen is anthropomorphized in the Japanese franchise, Umamusume Pretty Derby as a petite, light lavender-haired young woman and served as main character in the second season of the anime.\nSee also\n* List of racehorses\nReferences"
