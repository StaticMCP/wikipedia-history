In addition to his writing, he is the editorial director of Penguin Press UK.\nHe played for the Authors XI amateur cricket team, which is composed of British writers, during its first two seasons and he contributed a chapter to the team's book about their first season playing together, The Authors XI: A Season of English Cricket from Hackney to Hambledon (Bloomsbury, 2013).\nCareer\nPenn's first book, Winter King: The Dawn of Tudor England, was published by Penguin Books in 2011 and is an account of the life of King Henry VII of England. Historian Helen Castor reviewed it for The Telegraph, writing: \"In broad outline, this is not a new story – but, in Penn's hands, it is a revelation...Penn has pulled off a rare feat: a brilliant and haunting evocation of the Tudor world, with irresistible echoes of the age of fear in which we now live\". Reviewing it for The Guardian, Blair Worden wrote: \"If Penn's interpretation can sometimes seem slanted, its exposition would be hard to over-praise. The expressive and evocative power of his writing, and the union of scholarship with artistry, are rare in modern historical writing\". Penn was awarded the HW Fisher Best First Biography prize by the Biographers' Club in 2012 for Winter King.\nIn 2013, Penn presented an hour-long television documentary based on his book on BBC Two.
