This is not to be confused with GNG FC Leicester.\nThis football club has a female section, where 70 women and girls play.  they first entered team(s) in the FA People's Cup in 2019.\nIn addition to Sikh players, they have Muslims, Polish, English, Asian and black players.\nThe women's football club was started up by Parm Gill and, in recognition, UEFA rewarded her in 2018, with a UEFA Grassroots gold award for her leadership qualities.  This was presented by the UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin, at UEFA's headquarters in Switzerland.\nGNG Kabaddi Club\nThe GNG Kabaddi Club was started in 1964. In 1969 the first UK Kabaddi Tournament was held on Gravesend Gurdwara field.\nGuru Nanak Day Centre\nGuru Nanak Day Centre was established for the elderly in 1993. Day centre alumni include the WW2 fighter pilot Squadron Leader Mohinder Singh Pujji.\nEthos\nIn line with the Sikh principle of Sarbat da bhala, the Gurdwara served 60,000 free meals to hospital staff during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSites\nThe exact timeline is not fully clear, and conflicting accounts can be seen. However in the early 50s the first Guru Granth Sahib seems to have been brought to Gravesend by Mr Darshan Singh Sangha, a family from near Amritsar.\nWakefield Street (1950s)\nPrior to Edwin Street, the Gurdwara was located at Wakefield Street. This was also the personal residence of Charan Singh Jandialiwala, who was from the village of Jandiali.\nEdwin Street (1956/57 - 1970)\nThe original site for the Gurdwara was 55 Edwin Street, Gravesend. The site was purchased for £575, a significant sum at the time. A library of 500 books was set up in the 60s, having been brought over from India by the then schoolteacher and librarian, Joginder Singh Mattu. The Edwin Street Gurdwara was not closed for the first 2 years of the Clarence Place site operation, but was eventually sold for £2,500.\nClarence Place Site (1968 - 2010)\nFrom 17 November 1968 the Gurdwara was located at Clarence Place. Originally a chapel, this site was being used as a warehouse for the previous two decades, when purchased by the Sikh community. The site was purchased for £13,000, and assistance was given in organising by the then MP Albert Murray.\nAn alternative site had been considered in Lennox Road, but was opposed by the white residents on racial grounds.\nAfter the current site was opened, a plan was made to demolish the Clarence Place site, however this will now only be a refurbishment.\nKhalsa Avenue (2010 - Present)\nIt was the idea of President Gurdev Singh Rapur to purchase the current site, which was a park at the time. Initial work was begun by retiree day labourers living off of their state pensions, and working for free. They would also ask other day labourers to volunteer on weekends. The current site took nearly ten years to built.\nSecurity Incidents\nIn 1976, the then Gurdwara President, Mohan Singh, was attacked by the National Front and thrown through the plate glass window of Woolworth's in Gravesend town centre. Gravesend, being specifically targeted due to having the largest Sikh population in the UK, at that time. This led to further confrontations, and the eventual expulsion of the National Front.\nIn the 1970s, due to National Front defacement with Swastikas and slogans, then President Mohan Singh organised patrols of 5-6 people at night to watch the Gurdwara and prevent further graffiti.\nIn 1980, the National Front attempted to burn down the Gurdwara, then located at the Clarence Place site. Local Sikhs, as well as English individuals such as Andy Zeffer and Jill Anderson of the Anti-Nazi League, as well as future mayor Lady Murray, Anglo Indian Naina Sampson (who was born in Delhi and fluent in Punjabi), Miss Braby who began a local club to help Punjabi women learn English, and many others, assisted in working to protest National Front attacks.\nIn 1981 such attacks were ongoing.\nIn March 2021 a Swastika was spray painted onto the entrance to the Gurdwara. General Secretary Jagdev Singh Virdee invited \"...whoever it was to come in and talk to us. They will be very welcome.\" No culprit came forward to talk.\nOn 11 July 2024, a 17 year old male snuck into the Gurdwara after Sukhasan and attacked two women and several security guards. Initially attempting to hide in an empty prayer room, he was found and accosted by security during their lockup. After a short conversation in which security tried to de-escalate, he threatened to kill the security guards.  He then attacked two women, biting one, and slashing several others with a stolen Kirpan and Teer. The motive is unclear, but police initially treated the incident as \"religiously aggravated\" and not \"terrorism-related\". The teen was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. In November 2024 he was presented at Westminster Magistrates Court and sentenced for affray, actual bodily harm and was given a hospital order.\nReferences\nExternal links"
