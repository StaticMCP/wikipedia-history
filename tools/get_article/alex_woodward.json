He attended Mazenod College and played junior football for Noble Park and Dingley.\nFootball career\nHe was drafted by Hawthorn Football Club with pick 53 in 2011 AFL draft from the Sandringham Dragons in the TAC Cup. Whilst on Hawthorn's list, Woodward twice ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his right knee and has had three knee reconstructions. Woodward has played primarily for Box Hill Hawks in VFL and finally made his AFL debut in round 18, 2014.\nAfter competing his first full year of football in three years, Woodward's hard work was rewarded with winning the J. J. Liston Trophy for 2014. He polled 20 votes.\nWoodward tore the ACL in his right knee early in Box Hill Hawks’ match against Coburg in the VFL in July 2015.\nWoodward was delisted at the conclusion of the 2015 season; however, he was re-drafted in the 2016 rookie draft with the 52nd selection. At the conclusion of the 2016 season, he was delisted again by Hawthorn.\nIn 2017, he joined the Collingwood VFL team but ruptured his ACL again in his third game for the club, ironically against Box Hill. He returned strongly with the club in mid-2018, and managed to finish third in the J. J. Liston Trophy despite playing only eight games for the year.\nWoodward also served as a runner for the Collingwood AFL team during the year, and controversially became involved in the play during the 2018 AFL Grand Final to Collingwood's detriment. Late in the third quarter, Collingwood's Taylor Adams miskicked an attempted clearing kick towards centre half back; 's Elliot Yeo and Collingwood's Jaidyn Stephenson would both have had the opportunity to contest the miskick, but Woodward inadvertently blocked Stephenson's path, allowing Yeo to take the mark uncontested and kick a goal. The goal gave West Coast the lead for the first time since early in the game, and West Coast went on to win by five points.\nIn August 2019, following his 5th ACL injury, Woodward announced his retirement from playing football altogether.\nStatistics\n|- style=background:#EAEAEA\n| 2012 ||  || 36\n| 0 || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || 0\n|-\n| 2013 ||  || 36\n| 0 || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || 0\n|- style=background:#EAEAEA\n| 2014 ||  || 39\n| 2 || 0 || 1 || 6 || 12 || 18 || 1 || 8 || 0.0 || 0.5 || 3.0 || 6.0 || 9.0 || 0.5 || 4.0 || 0\n|-\n| 2015 ||  || 39\n| 0 || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || 0\n|- style=background:#EAEAEA\n| 2016 ||  || 39\n| 0 || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || 0\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n! colspan=3| Career\n! 2 !! 0 !! 1 !! 6 !! 12 !! 18 !! 1 !! 8 !! 0.0 !! 0.5 !! 3.0 !! 6.0 !! 9.0 !! 0.5 !! 4.0 !! 0\n|}\nHonours and achievements\nTeam\n* Minor premiership (): 2015\nIndividual\n* J.J.
