He was consul of Venezuela in Switzerland (1888–1918). He completed 29 books and close to 700 journal articles.\nBiography\nErnst von Hesse-Wartegg's origins are unknown, but he was thought to have been born in or near Vienna, Austrian Empire. He had a daughter born out of wedlock who tried in vain to prove her family roots in the 1930s. In 2012 several research teams could not find more information, only in results published in 2017 it was demonstrated that Hesse-Wartegg was Austrian by birth, but adopted American citizenship in 1887. In 1878, he married the American opera singer Minnie Hauk (1851–1929). Starting 1889 they lived in their villa in Tribschen, near Lucerne, Switzerland.\nThroughout his life he went on travels worldwide. In 1872 he went to South-Eastern Europe, 1876 was his first trip to the US. Trips in the years 1880 to Tunis, 1881 to Egypt, and 1883 to Canada and Mexico followed, as well as several trips to the US. His next important travels were 1887 to Venezuela, and 1892 to Morocco and Spain. In 1894 he went on a trip around the world with South and East Asia as major stops: India, Singapore, Hong-Kong, China, Japan and Korea. In 1898 he was back to China. A trip to the German colonies in the Pacific followed in 1900, and in 1901 he travelled to India and Ceylon. His last long trips were to Brazil in the years 1903, 1910 and 1913. He died at Tribschen, near Lucerne, Switzerland.\nMark Twain and Karl May, amongst others, borrowed from his geographical descriptions for their own works.\nWorks (selection)\n* Die Werkzeugmaschinen zur Metall- und Holzbearbeitung.
