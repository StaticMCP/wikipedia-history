It is located in the north-west of Dehradun district, along the border with the state of Himachal Pradesh.\nEthnically, Jaunsar-Bawar comprises two regions, inhabited by the two predominant groups: Jaunsar, the lower half, while the snow-clad upper region is called Bawar, which includes, the 'Kharamba peak' ().  Geographically adjacent, they are not very different from each other. The Bawar lies in the upper regions of the area. They are a unique community because they have remained cut off from the external world for centuries, leading to the retention of their unique culture and traditions, which have attracted historians, anthropologist and studies in ethnopharmacology to this region for over a century. There is a significant cultural shift from other people of Garhwal, living close by.\nJaunsar-Bawar region\nThe Jaunsar-Bawar region, is a valley, spread over 1002&nbsp;km2 and 398 villages(villages near koti colony,Sahiya market Kalsi, Sakani, Kanbua and Kakadi), between 77.45' and 78.7'20\" East to 30.31' and 31.3'3\" North. It is defined in the east, by the river Yamuna and by river Tons in the west, the northern part comprises Uttarkashi district, and some parts of Himachal Pradesh, the Dehradun tehsil forms its southern periphery.\nModes of livelihood in this region are agriculture and animal husbandry, which in the upper region is mostly for self-sustenance, as merely 10 percent of cultivated area is irrigated. Milk, wool and meat are an integral part of the local economy.\nHistory\nJaunsar-Bawar was a part of Sirmaur Kingdom at one point of time, which is now Sirmaur district in Himachal Pradesh. It is the border area of Garhwal region in Uttarakhand.\nIn 1829, Jaunsar-Bawar was incorporated in Chakrata tehsil, prior to which it had been a part of Punjab state of Sirmaur, until the British conquered it along with Dehradun after the 1814 war with the Gorkhas.\nBefore the establishment of British Indian Army cantonment in 1866, the entire area was known as Jaunsar-Bawar, and the name continued to be in popular use for the region, until the early 20th century. While Hindi is popular in most of the neighbouring hill areas, Jaunsari, a language of the Western Pahari group of Indo-Aryan languages, is spoken by most of the people of the region.\nGeography\nTraditionally, Jaunsar-Bawar region is known for its rich reserves of forested areas, in the high hills region, with trees of Deodar, Pine, and spruce, made for it becoming an important destination for the timber even during the British period, when the logs were rolled down the slopes and floated on Yamuna river to Delhi. Gate system, time table based traffic diversion on one way hilly roads, which was there since the time of British, is now removed.\nCulture\nThere is a rigid caste system. The Upper caste, consisting of Brahmin, Rajput (who are referred to as Khosh in local language), both have small difference, they are the landowners. The Lower caste includes Badoi (Traditionally Architects/Builders), Lohar-Sunar, Dhaki,  Dūm\nThe culture of the local Jaunsari people is distinct from neighboring Garhwal and Himachal Pradesh, though there are some similarities as well. Its culture is a bit closer to Sirmaur and Shimla district of Himachal Pradesh, as Jaunsar-Bawar paragana has been part of sirmaur hill kingdom of Himachal Pradesh for a long time.\nJaunsari language shares its vocabulary with Garhwali language. However, its accent and grammar is some sort of similar to people of those of Shimla and Sirmaur region i.e. area lying in western side of Giri river, comprises Rajgarh, Paonta, Renuka, Nahan, pacchad and Shillai tehsils. These people are also known as Hatti, and has similar culture like Jaunsari people. People's Union for Civil Liberties, PUCL Bulletin, September 1982. Some, anthropology studies in the 1990s revealed that tribal marriage practises were fast phasing out, and is being replaced by monogamy and these practices do not exist now\nAn important aspect of their culture are dances like the folk dance named\nHarul, Ghundiya Raso, Jhenta Raso, Jangbazi, Thoude, etc.\nOne unique custom which is followed here is the concept of bride price. The custom owes its origin to some strong logic. The parents spend a substantial amount on raising, educating and making the life of the girl as good as they can make it. In return the girl is an asset to the family as she cooks, cleans, and works on the farms. When a boy wants to marry the girl, he is taking away an asset of the family and must pay the fair price of the asset known as the bride price. But over the year this practice is followed by a few masses.\nDivorce is not a taboo in this culture, and divorced women are not ostracised from society. However, if the woman comes back to the parents' home after a divorce, the family must pay back the bride price to the man's family. If the woman divorces her husband to marry another man, the second man must pay  bride price to the first man's family.. But over the years this practice is followed by a few masses.\nArchitecture\nJaunsar Bawar follows the  Koti-Banal style of architecture. Houses are usually built in stone and timber and roofed with slate tiles. It is usually a two or three storey structure with a linear arrangement of one to four rooms on each floor and is typically sited on a terraced piece of land along the contours of the hill. In many villages in Uttarakhand, due to low temperature range, the housing and other buildings of socio-cultural values are generally shaped like pagodas or have sloping roofs.\nThe common building material used under construction includes wood (generally deodar, due to its abundance and durability), plain stones and other locally available materials like mud and stone slates. One of the important aspects of architecture in the area is the wooden carvings and the slate laden gabled roofs.\nSince the local deity is Lord Mahasu, most of the temples are dedicated to him. Famous temples include Mahasu Devta Temple at Hanol, Mahasu Temple at Bulhad(Bharam Khat) Temple at Thaina, Mahasu Temple at Lakhwar, Mahasu Temple at Lakhsiyar and newly constructed Mahasu Temples in Bisoi and Lohari\nMedicine\nThe Jaunsari people of the region has been using over 100 plants for the treatment of various ailments, which have remained a subject for many Ethnobotanical and Ethnopharamcological studies.\nIn Media\nRaaste Band Hain Sab, a film based on the work of Dr. Jayoti Gupta, Dept. of Sociology, Delhi University, on Jaunsar-Bawar, and made by Manjira Dutta, won the National Film Award for Best Anthropological/Ethnographic Film in 1988.\n\"Dance With GODS\", the First chapter of the documentary Jaunsar Bawar : An Alternate Life highlights the centuries-old deity rituals and sacred ceremonies. The latter part shows a tradition that is celebrated annually and has an interesting storyline of its existence.\nBollywood playback singer Jubin Nautiyal hails from this region.\nFurther reading\n* Himalayan Polyandry: Structure, Functioning and Culture Change.
