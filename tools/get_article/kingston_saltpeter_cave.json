      "text": "# Kingston Saltpeter Cave\n\nKingston Saltpeter Cave is the largest cave in Bartow County, Georgia, United States. It was formerly used as a source of saltpeter, the critical oxidizing component of gunpowder, by the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War (1861–1865). The cave is now a preserved area composed of 40 acres of largely hardwood forest, underlain by a variety of wildflowers and mosses.\nIn late 1983 the property was acquired by the Felburn Foundation in order to preserve, maintain, and protect it for future generations.\nReferences\nGeneral references\n*Sneed, Joel M., (2007), Bartow County Caves: History Underground in North Georgia, 161 pp.\n*Sneed, Joel M. and Larry O.
