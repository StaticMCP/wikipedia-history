At Damascus, Thomas, son-in-law of Byzantine Emperor Heraclius, was in charge. Receiving the intelligence of Khalid's march towards Damascus he prepared the defences of Damascus. He wrote to Emperor Heraclius for reinforcement, who was at Emesa that time. Moreover, Thomas, in order to get more time to prepare for a siege, sent the armies to delay, or if possible, halt Khalid's march to Damascus. One such army was defeated at the Battle of Yaqusa in mid-August 634 near Lake Tiberias 150&nbsp;km from Damascus, another army that halted the Muslim advance to Damascus was defeated in the Battle of Marj al-Saffar on 23 January 635. It is said that Umm Hakim bint al-Harith ibn Hisham, a Muslim heroine was involved in this battle and killed seven Byzantine soldiers.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=KDlFDgAAQBAJ War and Religion: An Encyclopedia of Faith and Conflict [3 Volumes by X - 2017]"
