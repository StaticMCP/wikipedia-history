Members of the expedition were organised into three parties, two in bases established on the Antarctic mainland and the third on the sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island. The Main Party base, under Mawson, was established at Cape Denison in Commonwealth Bay, at 67°0'S, 142°40'E. A Far Western party, under Frank Wild, was based on the Shackleton Ice Shelf, at 66°0'S, 100°E. The Macquarie Island base under George Ainsworth, as well as carrying out meteorological and other observations, acted as a wireless relay station connecting the Antarctic to Hobart.\nAurora, the expedition's ship, conducted a series of oceanographic surveys as part of the expedition and was captained by John King Davis, who also acted as the expedition's second-in-command.\nLand parties\nMain Base\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Age\n! scope=\"col\" | Image\n! scope=\"col\" | Role\n! scope=\"col\" | Notes\n|- |scope=\"row\"\n|\n| align= \"center\"|23\n|\n| Astronomer, assistant magnetician, recorder of tides.\n| Member of  party that remained for second winter, 1913 Bage served with the Royal Australian Engineers in the First World War, and died at Gallipoli on 7 May 1915.\n|- | scope=\"row\"\n|\n| align= \"center\"|22\n|\n| Engineer, and motor expert, in charge of air-tractor sledge\n| Member of  party that remained for second winter, 1913 Bickerton was selected for Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition as motor engineer, but on the outbreak of war in August 1914 he joined the British army, serving in the Royal Flying Corps.\n|- | scope=\"row\"\n|\n| align= \"center\"|40\n|\n| General duties; assistant collector, member of several sledging parties\n|\n|- | scope=\"row\"\n|\n| align= \"center\"|19\n|\n| Mechanic, assistant physicist.

In general, the crews changed for each of the Antarctic cruises, but a few served on more than one cruise.\nOthers\nMawson names several others who took part in one or more of the Aurora cruises, but were not members of the  landing parties: Captain James Davis, a whaling authority; C.C. Eitel, the expedition's secretary; T.T. Flynn, biologist; E.R. Waite, biologist; J. van Waterschoot, marine artist.\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*  }}\n*  }}\n*  }}\n*  }}\n*  }}\n*  }}\n*  }}\n*  }}\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links"
