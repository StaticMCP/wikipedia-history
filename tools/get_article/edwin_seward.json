He began work as an assistant to architect G. E. Robinson.\nSeward was one of the individuals at the centre of Cardiff's young art scene. He was the 21st President of the Cardiff Naturalists' Society (founded 1867) which was a hub of intellectual discussion. He tried unsuccessfully to establish a national institution in Cardiff for Welsh art (the Cambrian Academy of Art eventually set up in Conwy) and was a founding member of the South Wales Art Society in 1888.\nBy 1875 Seward was a member of the architecture firm James, Seward and Thomas and went on to build some of Cardiff's most notable buildings in the late 19th century.\nWhilst in Cardiff, Seward lived in Lisvane house, a property which he remodeled himself and is now Grade II listed. He later retired to Weymouth, Dorset, where he lived until his death.\nWorks in Cardiff include\n*Cardiff Free Library in The Hayes (1880–82)\n*St David's Hospital (1881)\n*Cardiff Royal Infirmary (1883)\n*Coal Exchange (1884–88) in Mount Stuart Square\n*David Morgan department stores building\n**two arcades in the city centre\n*Llanishen Methodist Church\n*New Trinity Church United Reformed Church (demolished in 1998) at junction of Cowbridge Road East and Theobald Rd.
