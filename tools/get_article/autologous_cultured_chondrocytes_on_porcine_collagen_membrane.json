It is used to treat symptomatic, full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee with or without bone involvement. Autologous cultured chondrocytes on porcine collagen membrane is an autologous cellularized scaffold product. This treatment is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is only administered to adults. Healthy cartilage is removed from the person's own knees and a 'scaffold' is created on which the healthy tissue growths. This is an autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis procedure which prevents tissue rejection complications since the transplanted cartilage comes from the same person.\nAutologous cultured chondrocytes on porcine collagen membrane was approved for use in the United States in May 2019.\nSee also\n* Microfracturing\n* Knee osteoarthritis\n* Knee pain\nReferences"
