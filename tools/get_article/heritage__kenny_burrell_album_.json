      "text": "# Heritage (Kenny Burrell album)\n\nHeritage is an album by guitarist Kenny Burrell recorded in 1980 and originally released on the AudioSource label.\nReception\n}}\nThe Allmusic review by Scott Yanow stated: \"By 1980 it seemed as if guitarist Kenny Burrell was spending at least as much time looking backwards (paying tribute to the past greats) as he was creating new music. This out-of-print LP from the obscure AudioSource label features Burrell performing nine jazz standards ... A worthwhile if not particularly innovative set\".\nTrack listing\n# \"A Night in Tunisia\" (Dizzy Gillespie, Frank Paparelli) – 5:50\n# \"Mood Indigo\" (Duke Ellington, Barney Bigard, Irving Mills) – 4:02\n# \"St. Louis Blues\" (W.
