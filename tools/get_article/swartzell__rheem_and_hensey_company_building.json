It was designed by architect Paul J. Pelz in 1907 for a local brokerage firm, which neighbored other brokers in this section of 15th Street neighboring the US Treasury.\nIn 1948 the building was converted into a movie theater and renamed Playhouse Theater. The theater closed in the early 1980s and an apartment block was built above what had until then been a low-rise building.\nReferences"
