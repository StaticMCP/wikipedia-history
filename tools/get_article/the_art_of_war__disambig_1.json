The work, which is attributed to the ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu (\"Master Sun\"), is composed of 13 chapters. Each one is devoted to a different set of skills or art related to warfare and how it applies to military strategy and tactics. For almost 1,500 years, it was the lead text in an anthology that was formalized as the Seven Military Classics by Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1080. The Art of War remains one of the most influential works on strategy of all time and has shaped both East Asian and Western military theory and thinking.\nThe book contains a detailed explanation and analysis of the 5th-century BC Chinese military, from weapons, environmental conditions, and strategy to rank and discipline. Sun also stressed the importance of intelligence operatives and espionage to the war effort. Considered one of history's finest military tacticians and analysts, his teachings and strategies formed the basis of advanced military training throughout the world.\nThe text was first translated into a European language in 1772, when the French Jesuit priest Jean Joseph Marie Amiot produced a French version; a revised edition was published in 1782. A partial translation into English was attempted by British officer Everard Ferguson Calthrop in 1905 under the title The Book of War. The first annotated English translation was completed and published by Lionel Giles in 1910. Military and political leaders such as the Chinese communist revolutionary Mao Zedong, Japanese  Takeda Shingen, Vietnamese general Võ Nguyên Giáp, and American generals Douglas MacArthur and Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. are all cited as having drawn inspiration from the book.\nHistory\nText and commentaries\nThe Art of War is traditionally attributed to an ancient Chinese military general known as Sun Tzu (pinyin: ), meaning 'Master Sun'. Sun Tzu is said to have lived in the 6th century BC, but the earliest parts of The Art of War probably date to at least 100 years later.\nSima Qian's Shiji, the first of China's Twenty-Four Histories, records an early Chinese tradition that a text on military matters was written by one Sun Wu () from the state of Qi, and that this text had been read and studied by King Helü of Wu (). This text was traditionally identified with the received ''Master Sun's Art of War''. The conventional view was that Sun Wu was a military theorist from the end of the Spring and Autumn period (776–471&nbsp;BC) who fled   Qi to the southeastern state of Wu, where he is said to have impressed the king with his ability to quickly train officials, including court women, in military discipline—and to have made Wu's armies powerful enough to challenge the rival state of Chu to Wu's west. This view is still widely held in China.\nThe strategist and warlord Cao Cao in the early 3rd century AD authored the earliest known commentary to the Art of War. Cao's preface makes clear that he edited the text and removed certain passages, but the extent of his changes were unclear historically. The Art of War appears throughout the bibliographical catalogs of the Chinese dynastic histories, but listings of its divisions and size varied widely.\nAuthorship\n, showing the version of The Art of War that was popular in Han dynasty (206&nbsp;BC&nbsp;– 220 AD)]]\nBeginning around the 12th century, Sun Tzu's historical existence began to be questioned by Chinese scholars, primarily on the grounds that he is not mentioned in the historical classic Zuo Zhuan, which mentions most of the notable figures from the Spring and Autumn period. The name \"Sun Wu\" () does not appear in any text prior to the Records of the Grand Historian, and has been suspected to be a made-up descriptive cognomen meaning \"the fugitive warrior\", glossing the surname \"Sun\" as the related term \"fugitive\" ( ), while \"Wu\" ( ) is (1) the ancient Chinese virtue of \"martial, valiant\" and (2) a Jianghuai dialectal synonym of  \"knight\", which corresponds to Sunzi's role as the hero's doppelgänger in the story of Wu Zixu. In the early 20th century, the Chinese writer and reformer Liang Qichao theorized that the text was actually written in the 4th century BC by Sun Tzu's purported descendant Sun Bin, as a number of historical sources mention a military treatise he wrote.\nIn 1972, the Yinqueshan Han slips were discovered in two Han dynasty (206&nbsp;BC&nbsp;– 220 AD) tombs near the city of Linyi in Shandong. Among the many bamboo slip writings contained in the tombs, which had been sealed between 134 and 118 BC, were two separate texts: one attributed to \"Sun Tzu\", corresponding to the received text, and another attributed to Sun Bin, which explains and expands upon the earlier The Art of War by Sunzi. The Sun Bin text's material overlaps with much of the \"Sun Tzu\" text. The two may be \"a single, continuously developing intellectual tradition united under the Sun name\". This discovery showed that much of the historical confusion was due to the fact that there were two texts that could have been referred to as \"Master Sun's Art of War\", not one. The content of the earlier text is about one-third of the chapters of the modern The Art of War, and their text matches very closely. It is now generally accepted that the earlier The Art of War was completed sometime between 500 and 430&nbsp;BC.\nChapters\nThe Art of War is divided into 13 chapters (or ); the collection is referred to as being one  (\"whole\" or alternatively \"chronicle\").\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ The Art of War chapter names and contents\n|-\n!

The book even gave him the inspiration for his famous battle standard  (Wind, Forest, Fire and Mountain), meaning fast as the wind, silent as a forest, ferocious as fire and immovable as a mountain.\nThe translator Samuel B. Griffith offers a chapter on \"Sun Tzu and Mao Tse-Tung\" where The Art of War is cited as influencing Mao's On Guerrilla Warfare, On the Protracted War and ''Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War'', and includes Mao's quote: \"We must not belittle the saying in the book of Sun Wu Tzu, the great military expert of ancient China, 'Know your enemy and know yourself and you can fight a thousand battles without disaster.'\"\nDuring the Vietnam War, some Viet Cong officers extensively studied The Art of War and reportedly could recite entire passages from memory. General Võ Nguyên Giáp successfully implemented tactics described in The Art of War during the Battle of Dien Bien Phu ending major French involvement in Indochina and leading to the accords which partitioned Vietnam into North and South. General Giáp, later the main PVA military commander in the Vietnam War, was an avid student and practitioner of Sun Tzu's ideas.\nOutside East Asia\nThe United States' defeat in the Vietnam War, more than any other event, brought Sun Tzu to the attention of leaders of U.S. military theory. The Department of the Army in the United States, through its Command and General Staff College, lists The Art of War as one example of a book that may be kept at a military unit's library. The Art of War is listed on the US Marine Corps Professional Reading Program (formerly known as the Commandant's Reading List). It is recommended reading for all United States Military Intelligence personnel. The Art of War is also used as instructional material at the United States Military Academy (commonly known as West Point), in the course Military Strategy (470). It is also recommended reading for Officer cadets at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. Some notable military leaders have stated the following about Sun Tzu and The Art of War:\n– General Colin Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, National Security Advisor, and Secretary of State.}}\nAccording to some authors, the strategy of deception from The Art of War was studied and widely used by the KGB: \"I will force the enemy to take our strength for weakness, and our weakness for strength, and thus will turn his strength into weakness\".\nApplication outside the military\nSome of the book's admirers claim that it has a variety of applications in a myriad of competitive non-military endeavors across the modern world including espionage, culture, politics, business, and sports.\nSome business books have claimed to see metaphorical parallels from The Art of War to office politics and corporate business strategy. Some Japanese companies make the book required reading for their key executives. Entrepreneurs and corporate executives have turned to it for inspiration and advice on how to succeed in competitive business situations. The book has also been applied to the field of education.\nThe Art of War has been the subject of legal books and legal articles on the trial process, including negotiation tactics and trial strategy.\nThe book The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene has many quotations from The Art of War.\nThe Art of War has also been applied in sports. National Football League coach Bill Belichick, record holder of the most Super Bowl wins in history, has stated on multiple occasions his admiration for The Art of War. Brazilian association football coach Luiz Felipe Scolari actively used The Art of War for Brazil's successful 2002 World Cup campaign. During the tournament Scolari put passages of The Art of War underneath his players' doors at night.\nPlaying To Win by David Sirlin analyses applications of the ideas from The Art of War in modern esports. The Art of War was released in 2014 as an e-book companion alongside the Art of War DLC for Europa Universalis IV, a PC strategy game by Paradox Development Studios, with a foreword by Thomas Johansson.\nFilm and television\nThe Art of War and Sun Tzu have been referenced and quoted in many movies and television shows, including in the 1987 movie Wall Street, in which Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) frequently references it, and commends his protege, Bud Fox, for being able to quote a relevant passage from memory. The 20th James Bond film, Die Another Day (2002) also references The Art of War as the spiritual guide shared by Colonel Moon and his father. In The Sopranos, season 3, episode 8 (\"He Is Risen\"), Dr. Melfi suggests to Tony Soprano that he read the book.\nIn the Star Trek: The Next Generation first-season episode \"The Last Outpost\", first officer William Riker quotes The Art of War: \"Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy\". Captain Picard expressed pleasure that Sun Tzu was still taught at Starfleet Academy. Later in the episode, a survivor from a long-dead nonhuman empire noted common aspects between his own people's wisdom and The Art of War with regard to knowing when and when not to fight.\nThe Art of War is a 2000 action spy film directed by Christian Duguay and starring Wesley Snipes, Michael Biehn, Anne Archer and Donald Sutherland.\nNotable translations\nminiature edition of the 1994 Ralph D.
