All three completed their medical studies and each of them was the first woman from their respective countries to obtain a degree in Western medicine.]]\nThis '''Timeline of women's education''' is an overview of the history of education for women worldwide. It includes key individuals, institutions, law reforms, and events that have contributed to the development and expansion of educational opportunities for women.\nThe timeline highlights early instances of women's education, such as the establishment of girls' schools and women's colleges, as well as legal reforms like compulsory education laws that have had a significant impact on women's access to education.\nThe 18th and 19th centuries saw significant growth in the establishment of girls' schools and women's colleges, particularly in Europe and North America. Legal reforms began to play a crucial role in shaping women's education, with laws being passed in many countries to make education accessible and compulsory for girls.\nThe 20th century marked a period of rapid advancement in women's education. Coeducation became more widespread, and women began to enter fields of study that were previously reserved for men. Legislative measures, such as Title IX in the United States, were enacted to ensure equality in educational opportunities.\nThe timeline also reflects social movements and cultural shifts that have affected women's education, such as the women's suffrage movement, which contributed to the broader fight for women's rights, including education.\nVarious international organizations and initiatives have been instrumental in promoting women's education in developing countries, recognizing the role of education in empowering women and promoting social and economic development.\nThis timeline illustrates how women's education has evolved and reflects broader societal changes in gender roles and equality.\nBCE\nclay tablet with the cuneiform inscription of Inanna and Ebih by Enheduanna]]\n).]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Location\n!Milestone\n! clas=\"unsortable\" |Ref.\n|-\n|c. 2500\n|Ancient Egypt\n|Peseshet, known as the \"Overseer of Female Physicians\"\n|\n|-\n|c. 2285–2250\n|Ancient Mesopotamia\n|Enheduanna appointed as high priestess and becomes one of the earliest known authors.\n|\n|-\n|c. 2000\n|Ancient Egypt\n|Evidence of women being educated as scribes.\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |c. 800–500\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Ancient India\n|Gargi Vachaknavi participates in philosophical debates in the royal court.\n|\n|-\n|Maitreyi, a scholar, is involved in philosophical discussions in the Upanishads.\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |c. 600\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Ancient Greece\n|Spartan women receive physical education, which was rare in Greece.\n|\n|-\n|Theano actively engages in philosophical studies and writings.\n|\n|-\n|550–300\n|Ancient Persia\n|Achaemenid period records indicate that royal women were educated and some took part in administrative roles.\n|\n|-\n|c. 195–c. 115\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Ancient Rome\n|Cornelia Africana, mother of the Gracchi brothers, educates her children and emphasizes learning.\n|\n|-\n|c. 100\n|Roman women, including the poet Sulpicia, engage in literary pursuits.\n|\n|}\n1–1200 CE\n, Florence]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Location\n!Milestone\n!class=unsortable|Ref.\n|-\n|c. 100 CE\n|Ancient China\n|Ban Zhao writes \"Lessons for Women,\" an influential text on women's education.\n|\n|-\n|664 CE\n|England\n|Hilda of Whitby oversees Whitby Abbey, a center of learning.\n|\n|-\n|700-1200 CE\n|Islamic Golden Age (countries)\n|A sponsorship system allows many women to study Hadith, Islamic law, and more.\n|\n|-\n|705 CE\n|England\n|Wimborne Minster, an Anglo-Saxon double monastery, provides education for women.\n|\n|-\n|c. 750 CE\n|Germany\n|Leoba is appointed abbess of the monastery of Tauberbischofsheim, contributing to education.\n|\n|-\n|859 CE\n|Morocco\n|Fatima al-Fihri founds the future University of Al Quaraouiyine (founded as a mosque, it was made in to a university in 1963).\n|\n|-\n|c. 1000 CE\n|Ancient Japan\n|Women contribute to literature, such as Murasaki Shikibu, author of \"The Tale of Genji.\"\n|\n|-\n|c. 1140 CE\n|Byzantine Empire\n|Anna Komnene is educated in Greek literature, history, philosophy, theology, mathematics, and medicine.

Bell holds that Title IX applies only to those programs receiving direct federal aid. The case reaches the Supreme Court when Grove City College disagreed with the Department of Education's assertion that it was required to comply with Title IX. Grove City College was not a federally funded institution; however, they did accept students who were receiving Basic Educational Opportunity Grants through a Department of Education program. The Department of Education's stance was that, because some of its students were receiving federal grants, the school was receiving federal assistance and Title IX applied to it. The Court decided that since Grove City College was only receiving federal funding through the grant program, only that program had to be in compliance. The ruling was a major victory for those opposed to Title IX, as it made many institutions' sports programs outside of the rule of Title&nbsp;IX and, thus, reduced the scope of Title IX.\n|\n|-\n|1985\n|Nigeria\n|Grace Alele-Williams is appointed vice-chancellor of the University of Benin in 1985, becoming the first female vice-chancellor of any Nigerian university.\n|\n|-\n|1986\n|Zimbabwe\n|To combat gender disparities in higher education, the University of Zimbabwe introduces a quota system to ensure a higher enrollment of women in its programs.\n|\n|-\n|1987\n|United States\n|Johnnetta Cole becomes the first Black president of Spelman College.\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |1988\n|United States\n|The Civil Rights Restoration Act is passed, extending Title IX coverage to all programs of any educational institution that receives any federal assistance, both direct and indirect.\n|\n|-\n|Pakistan\n|Benazir Bhutto became the first woman to lead a Muslim-majority country as Prime Minister.

By 2018, over 3.6 million girls were enrolled in schools, marking a substantial rise from previous years, especially in secondary education.\n|\n|-\n|India\n|India launched the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) in 2001 as a government program to achieve Universalisation of Elementary Education. This program was particularly notable for its focus on the education of girls and children with special needs. The SSA aimed to provide quality elementary education, including life skills and computer education, to about 193 million children across 1.1 million habitations.\n|\n|-\n|2004\n|Rwanda\n|Rwanda made significant strides in achieving gender parity in education after the 1994 genocide. The government established the Girls' Education Task Force in 2004 to promote education for young girls. Several policies were introduced to continue gender equality in education, such as the Girls Education Policy (2008), the National Education Policy (2010), and the University of Rwanda Gender Policy (2016). These policies dedicated 50% of student university positions to women and addressed the socio-economic barriers hindering girls' education. Rwanda's success in promoting girls' education is evident in the fact that it currently boasts the highest participation rates in East Africa and has achieved gender parity in net and gross enrollment at pre-primary, primary, and secondary levels.\n|\n|-\n|2005\n|Saudi Arabia\n|Saudi Arabia witnessed a significant transformation in higher education for women after 2005, particularly under the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques Scholarship program introduced by King Abdullah. This program was designed to strengthen Saudi academic institutions and broaden their research and course offerings. It marked a notable shift in the country's approach to female education, with an increase in female graduates leading to incremental improvements in the number of women entering top jobs and earning salaries on par with their male colleagues. This change was part of a broader effort to diversify the Saudi economy and embrace high-tech, creative, and specialized industries under the Kingdom's Vision 2030 reform agenda. The reforms not only enhanced educational opportunities for women but also aimed to align students' qualifications with the job market in Saudi Arabia, thereby raising overall efficiency and developing managerial techniques.\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2006\n| rowspan=\"2\" |United States\n|For the first time, more doctoral degrees are conferred on women than men in the United States.

However, despite this progress, disparities remained at the regional level, with enrollment being much lower in areas with high poverty levels. In some regions, only 19% of girls were enrolled in school. The policy was particularly effective in reducing the educational gender gap and increasing the overall number of students in primary education, including girls\n|\n|-\n|2011\n|India\n|In April 2011, the Institute for Buddhist Dialectical Studies (IBD) in Dharamsala, India, confers the degree of geshe (a Tibetan Buddhist academic degree for monks and nuns) to Venerable Kelsang Wangmo, a German nun, thus making her the world's first female geshe.\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |2013\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Saudi Arabia\n|The Saudi government sanctions sports for girls in private schools for the first time.\n|\n|-\n|Mai Majed Al-Qurashi becomes the first woman to receive a PhD in Saudi Arabia (from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology).\n|\n|-\n|United Kingdom\n|It is announced that Ephraim Mirvis has created the job of ma'ayan by which women would be advisers on Jewish law in the area of family purity and as adult educators in Orthodox synagogues.

This incident drew global attention and led to the launch of the #BringBackOurGirls campaign. The kidnapping highlighted the risks faced by girls pursuing education in conflict areas and the extreme measures taken by Boko Haram against western-style modern education. Despite efforts, many of the kidnapped girls remained missing years after the incident, underscoring the ongoing challenges in the region. The campaign for their release and the international attention it garnered underscored the widespread condemnation of Boko Haram's actions and the global concern for the safety and education of girls in conflict zones.\n|\n|-\n|2015\n|Global\n|The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, launched in 2015, included SDG 4 which specifically focuses on ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education for all. One of the main targets of SDG 4 is to eliminate gender disparities in education and to ensure equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for vulnerable groups, including persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples, and children in vulnerable situations. The goal emphasizes the importance of achieving literacy and numeracy for all youth and a significant proportion of adults, both men and women, by 2030. SDG 4 also highlights the need to increase the supply of qualified teachers and to improve infrastructure and facilities for effective learning environments, particularly in Least Developed Countries (LDCs). Despite progress, challenges such as a high number of out-of-school children and adolescents, as well as disparities in educational access and quality, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia, continue to persist.\n|\n|-\n|2016\n|Tibet\n|Twenty Tibetan Buddhist nuns become the first Tibetan women to receive geshema degrees.\n|\n|-\n|2018\n|California\n|In 1998 Deep Springs College accepted a $1.8 million low-interest loan under the condition that it would begin admitting women by 2019. In 2011, the college's trustees voted to begin accepting female students in the summer of 2013 but became embroiled in legal challenges which were lodged against the trustees' action. The challengers disputed the authority of the college's board to change the admissions policy and included an injunction preventing the college from accepting female students until at least the 2018–2019 academic year. On April 13, 2017, the California Court of Appeal ruled that the college could admit women in Hitz v. Hoekstra. With the Supreme Court of California declining to hear an appeal, the board of trustees voted once again to admit women, with the first female students arriving in July 2018.\n|-\n|2020\n|Global\n|The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on girls' education worldwide in 2020 was profound and multi-faceted. UNESCO estimated that 11 million girls might not return to school following the pandemic, with girls aged 12–17 being particularly at risk of dropping out in low and lower-income countries. The challenges were especially acute for girls from low-income households and those in rural areas. The pandemic exacerbated existing inequalities and introduced new threats to girls' education, including increased risks of child marriage, early pregnancy, and gender-based violence. Many girls were married off as a result of the economic pressures of the pandemic on families, leading to increased teenage pregnancies and a rise in rape cases, often resulting in unwanted pregnancies and school dropouts. The pandemic also highlighted the need for greater investment in education and security for girls as resources for the future of the world.\n|\n|-\n|2022\n|Afghanistan\n|In March 2022, the Taliban abruptly reversed their plans to allow girls to resume their secondary school education (defined as grade seven and upwards in Afghanistan). With the exception of the current cohort of university students, this decision leaves graduating from sixth grade as the highest level of educational attainment possible for Afghan women. Secondary schools for boys reopened on schedule.\n|\n|}\nSee also\n* Female education\n* Female education in the United States\n* Timeline of women's legal rights (other than voting)\nReferences"
