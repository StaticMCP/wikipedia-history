AIA professionals have carried out archaeological fieldwork around the world and AIA has established research centers and schools in seven countries. As of 2019, the society had more than 6,100 members and more than 100 affiliated local societies in the United States and overseas. AIA members include professional archaeologists and members of the public.\nThe AIA has established many archaeological organizations and protected many historical sites in the world. The AIA has hosted an annual meeting every year for over 120 years, where archaeologists present their latest work. The institute also has established scholarships for students and awarded archaeologists for their contributions to archaeology.\nThe institute publishes a scholarly journal, the American Journal of Archaeology (AJA) and the magazine Archaeology.\nHistory\nThe Archaeological Institute of America was founded in Boston in 1879 by Charles Eliot Norton with his colleagues and friends. They formed the society \"for furthering and directing the archaeological and artistic investigation and research\". Norton was the AIA's first president. The institute subsequently expanded its reach through the establishment of schools of archaeology around the Mediterranean and in the southwestern United States.\nPublications\nThe American Journal of Archaeology (AJA) is the AIA's peer-reviewed academic journal, and Archaeology is the popular magazine issued by the institute.\nThe American Journal of Archaeology was founded in 1885; the second series began in 1897. The AJA is published four times a year by the Archaeological Institute of America and the University of Chicago Press. The chief editors of the magazine are Emma Blake of the University of Arizona and Robert Schon of the University of Arizona. The journal presents original studies of the various peoples and material cultures of the Mediterranean and related regions, including North Africa (Egypt and Sudan), Western Asia (Caucasus), and Europe, from prehistory to late antiquity and beyond. The AJA encourages work that explores the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean along with other regions and periods and discusses the reasons for their continuing significance in the present. Also addressed in the journal are the history of the discipline, archaeological methodologies, and theoretical approaches.\nThe Archaeological Institute of America has continuously published Archaeology since 1948. The magazine engages and entertains readers through vivid stories, surprising narratives, and inspiring images, bringing people of the past into our lives in the present. The magazine and website of the American Institute of Archaeology contain news of recent archaeological discoveries. The magazine is available at newsstands or on the website.\nGovernance\nThe Archaeological Institute of America is governed by the council. All representatives must be AIA members who know AIA rules, work throughout the year and vote on issues, and attend meetings. The [https://www.archaeological.org/about/governance/board/ Governing Board] prepares and approves the organization's annual budget and oversees its investments and donations, also conducting fundraising activities. The board meets three times a year and consists of seven officers elected by the council and twenty-four to thirty governors. There are three types of trustees, representing different constituents of AIA: General Trustees, Academic Trustees, and Society Trustees. The executive committee of the governing board holds at least three meetings annually.\nElizabeth S. Greene is the current president (term 2023 to 2026), and Brian I. Daniels is the first vice president (term 2023 to 2026).\nScholarships and honors\nThe AIA offers scholarships for young academic members and funds several students for excavation, research, publication, and site preservation. Its numerous awards recognize archaeologists and individuals and communities who have made outstanding contributions to the field and heritage conservation.\nPresidents\nFormer presidents of the AIA\n* Charles Eliot Norton 1879–1889: Charles Eliot Norton (November 16, 1827 – October 21, 1908) was an American author, social critic, and professor of art based in New England.
