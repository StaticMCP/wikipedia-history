It was the last song to be recorded for the band's debut studio album, Glee (1997). Of the song, James Di Salvio has said \"It was almost like one of those movies where an animated blue bird swings by over the real live footage. It's cheesy, but I knew in my heart it was a hit.\"\n\"Drinking in L.A.\" was featured in television commercials for Rolling Rock beer in the United Kingdom, which contributed to its chart success there, peaking at number three on the UK Singles Chart in August 1999. It also reached the top 10 in Iceland, Italy, Norway and Sweden, as well as number 35 in the band's native Canada. The music video for the song was directed by Adam Courneya. The song appeared in the 2022 film Aftersun.\nBackground\nAfter a heavy night of drinking, James Di Salvio woke up face-down on a lawn in West Hollywood. With a serious headache, he asked himself: \"What the hell am I doing, drinking in L.A.?\"\nCritical reception\nStephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic felt that Bran Van 3000 is a \"bizarre, stylish mix of club music, techno, hip-hop, lounge and kitsch-pop\", adding that the song is \"great\". Chuck Taylor from Billboard described it as an \"atmospheric gem\" and \"terrifically quirky, with a more or less spoken verse accompanied by a chorale of dreamy background vocals, catcalls, and eerie sounds both sung and spoken and coming at you from all sides.\" He said \"there's a hook there, too, as rich and textured as any more clearly defined pop offering. Instrumentally, you couldn't ask for more, with trancy lo fi production\". He also complimented it as \"glorious and deliciously creative\". Scottish Daily Record noted its \"slacker hip-hop and brilliant vocals\". Music Week complimented it as a \"laid back, funky track combining rich vocals of soul diva Maraille and the Beck-like lazy drawl of James Di Salvio.\" Stuart Bailie from NME commented, \"At least 'Drinking In LA' has a point of sorts, a development on the lotus-eater myth. Only now are the hedonists sobering up on Venice Beach, California, troubled by an imminent career crisis. Nice tune, too.\" A reviewer from Sunday Mirror gave it nine out of ten, declaring it as \"one of those oh so wacky tunes that creep under your summer skin and won't budge. Sounds like Beck and will be huge.\"\nMusic video\nThe accompanying music video for the song was directed by Adam Courneya. Ilana Kronick from The Gazette wrote, \"In short, the clip for Drinking in L.A. is a visual representation of Bran Van's electro-pop cross-breeding. A veritable bouillabaisse of teched-out trends, digi-rock references and clubby stylings, the video — much like the group — is a trip through the '90s cool pop standards.\"\nThe video won a MuchMusic Video Award for \"Best Dance Video\".\nTrack listings\n* Canadian promo CD\n# \"Drinking in L.A.\" (caller intro) – 3:53\n# \"Drinking in L.A.\" (no caller intro) – 3:34\n* US maxi-CD single and UK CD re-release\n# \"Drinking in L.A.\" (edit) – 3:34\n# \"Drinking in L.A.\" (Fink mix) – 5:36\n# \"Drinking in L.A.\" (Zoobone mix) – 3:56\n* UK original CD single\n# \"Drinking in L.A.\" (edit) – 3:34\n# \"The Problem with Sheldon\" – 1:23\n# \"Drinking in L.A.\" (Fink mix) – 5:36\n# \"Drinking in L.A.\" (Zoobone mix) – 3:56\n* UK cassette single\n# \"Drinking in L.A.\" (edit) – 3:34\n# \"The Problem with Sheldon\" – 1:23\n# \"Drinking in L.A.\" (Fink mix) – 5:37\n* European and Australian maxi-CD single\n# \"Drinking in L.A.\" (edit) – 3:34\n# \"Thinking in L.A.\" – 5:42\n# \"Drinking in L.A.\" (Fink mix) – 5:36\n# \"Drinking in L.A.\" (album version) – 3:56\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1997–1999)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA)\n|79\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Canada CHR/Top 40 (BDS)\n|28\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Denmark (IFPI)\n|15\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100)\n|17\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Iceland (Íslenski listinn topp 40)\n|3\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Italy (Musica e dischi)\n|8\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Italy Airplay (Music & Media)\n| 3\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Dutch Top 40 Tipparade)\n|2\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1998)\n!Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Iceland (Íslenski Listinn Topp 40)\n|80\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Sweden (Hitlistan)\n|89\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1999)\n!Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (OCC)\n|70\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Airplay (Music Week)\n|47\n|}\nCertifications\nRelease history\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Region\n!scope=\"col\"|Date\n!scope=\"col\"|Format(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|Label(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Canada\n|February 1997\n|Radio\n|Audiogram\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|United States\n|January 26, 1998\n|Modern rock radio\n|Capitol\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|United Kingdom\n|May 18, 1998\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|United States\n|August 25, 1998\n|Contemporary hit radio\n|Capitol\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|United Kingdom (re-release)\n|August 9, 1999\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nReferences"
