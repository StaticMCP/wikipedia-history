Tony Wong Chun-loong) created the company Jademan Holdings in 1971. In 1979 it became a formal corporation. The company was first listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1986. At one time 80% of the comics market in Hong Kong came from this company. It acquired 70% of Tin Tin Daily News in April 1987, and acquired money from that company. According to Monica Ko of the South China Morning Post, because of Wong's profile in Jademan, the company's stock became known as \"personality stock\". Comics artist Ma Wing-shing worked for Jademan.\nBeginning in the 1980s, Jademan began distributing comics in North America. The initial comic had a printing of 50,000. At first the circulation of its comics was 20,000 total, made up of four titles. Ultimately, the company had six titles in North America. By August 1990, the North American total circulation had declined to 10,000.\nTony Wong held control until 1989, when he was removed. After Wong resigned, his involvement in the company's comics ended. Tony Zie became the new chairperson. As of January 1990, the company had 65% of the Hong Kong comics market, and it had 16 titles in Chinese published in Hong Kong. In August 1990 the company had 14 comic book titles in Hong Kong, and the combined circulation there was 1.45 million, making up 60% of the comic book market. In Summer 1990, Ma Wing-shing started a new job at Jonesky.\nIn May 1992 the company changed its name to Cultural Communications as a way to push itself away from Tony Wong, who later was convicted of an offence and imprisoned. This became shortened to CultureCom. Leung Kin-cheung, the assistant general manager of the company, announced an intention to make new comic books with a different readership instead of competing with Tony Wong, who created another company, Jade Dynasty Publications.\nSing Tao Holdings acquired 39% of the shares of the company circa the late 1980s/early 1990s. Sing Tao made the decision to focus on translations of Japanese manga.\nBy 1998 Viagold Capital had proposed purchasing 32% of Culturecom for $21,000,000.\nCirca August 1999, there was a proposal to give shares to Limeridge for $30,000,000, but an executive of a high level opposed the plan, and so in September 1999 it was nixed.\nIn 2000 the company had plans to develop a method of publishing electronic books in Chinese, referred to as the e-Cbook, with $200 million of investment money.\nIn 2004 there were plans to attract a \"strategic partner\", but when that failed, the company's stocks declined by 15.94%.\nCorporate affairs\nThe company was formerly headquartered in  (海港中心) in Wan Chai.\nTitles\nBy 2010 it had published upwards of 300 titles of translated manga, making it the Hong Kong publisher with the most translated manga.\nThere were six titles published in English.\nTitles published in English:\n* Chinese Hero: Tales of the Blood Sword as The Blood Sword\n* '\n* '\n* Oriental Heroes\nHong Kong titles published in Chinese:\n* Chinese Hero: Tales of the Blood Sword\n* Drunken Fist\n* ''The Force of Buddha's Palm\n* Oriental Heroes\nTitles in Spanish, distributed in Spain:\n* Drunken Fist\n* Tigre Wong (Oriental Heroes)\nJapanese manga titles published in Chinese:\n* Astro Boy\n* Bakuman\n* Bleach\n* Captain Tsubasa\n* Death Note\n* Doraemon\n* Dragon Ball\n* Dragon Ball Super\n* Eyeshield 21\n* Hikaru no Go\n* Hunter x Hunter\n* Jujutsu Kaisen\n* Look Back\n* One Punch Man\n* Phoenix\n* Rurouni Kenshin\n* Ultraman\n* Yu-Gi-Oh!''\nReferences\nNotes\nExternal links\n* [https://www.culturecom.com.hk/en/ Culturecom]\n* [https://www.culturecom.com.hk/ Culturecom]"
