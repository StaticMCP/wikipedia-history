Smith Milking Shed is a historic building located west of Winterset, Iowa, United States.  Smith was one of the earliest settlers in this township, having acquired the deed to the  farm between 1854 and 1856. This building is an early example of a vernacular limestone farm building.  It is a single-story, gabled structure composed of rubble stone that was quarried along the Middle River on the farm and laid in a random bond.  Its construction is attributed to Smith, as its rough and simple construction do not reflect the work of any of the stonemasons working in the county at the time it was built.  The milking shed was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.  His single-room house, built about the same time, is also listed on the National Register.\nReferences"
