This coverage augmented worldwide coverage of space signals activities at similarly equipped sites at Misawa AB, Japan, Osan AB, Republic of Korea and at Griffiss AFB in the United States.\nThe Deep Space Tracking System uses sensitive, highly accurate 20-foot dish antennas to detect and track S-band radio signals transmitted by radio beacons on most satellites.  There were DSTS receivers located at Griffiss AFB, New York; RAF Feltwell, Great Britain; and Misawa AB, Japan.\nThe 5 SSS was inactivated in 2003, with administration of RAF Feltwell transferred to Detachment 4, 18th Intelligence Squadron.\nOn 15 April 2022, the 5th Space Control Squadron was redesignated the 5th Electromagnetic Warfare Squadron.\nPrevious designations\n*5th Space Control Squadron (2019–2022)\n*5th Space Surveillance Squadron (1989–2003)\nBases stationed\n*RAF Feltwell, United Kingdom (1989–2003)\nList of commanders\n*Lt Col Ronald P.
