For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\nAll modern acts have a short title, e.g. the Local Government Act 2003.  Some earlier acts also have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n3 Geo. 4\nThe third session of the 7th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 5 February 1822 until 6 August 1822.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 3 G. 4.\nPublic general acts\nor the Insurrection Act 1822|public|1|11-02-1822|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to suppress Insurrections and prevent Disturbance of the Public Peace in Ireland, until the First Day of August One thousand eight hundred and twenty two.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  for taking an Account of the Population of Ireland^ as relates to certain  to be incurred under the said Act.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and Solicitors, to make and file the same on or before the last Day of Trinity Term One thousand eight hundred and twenty two, and to allow Persons to make and file such Affidavits, although the Persons whom they served shall have neglected to take out their Annual Certificates.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  for preventing Aliens from becoming naturalized, or being made or becoming Denizens, except in certain Cases.|note4= }}\n|  for amending the several Acts for the Regulation of  and Solicitors.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  to allow the said Duty on Malt in Stock, and to make Regulations for better securing the Duties on Malt.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  for establishing Fever Hospitals, and for making other Regulations for Relief of the suffering Poor, and for preventing the Increase of infectious Fevers in Ireland.|note4= }}\n|  for the Assistance of Trade and Manufactures in Ireland, by authorizing the Advance of certain Sums for the Support of Commercial Credit there.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  for the more effectual Encouragement of the Manufacture of Flax and Cotton in Great Britain;
