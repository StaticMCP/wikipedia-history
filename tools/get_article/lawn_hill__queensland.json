Lawn Hill National Park was established to protect the gorge in December 1984. The national park was expanded in March 1992 to include Riversleigh World Heritage Area (formerly part of Riversleigh pastoral station).\nDemographics\nIn the , Lawn Hill and surrounding localities recorded a population of 381 people.\nIn the , Lawn Hill had a population of 19 people.\nIn the , Lawn Hill had a population of 63 people.\nEconomy\nThere are a number of homesteads in the locality, including:\n* Adels Grove ()\n* Lawn Hill ()\n* Old Herbert Vale ()\n* Riversleigh ()\nEducation\nStudents who live in the northernmost parts of the locality can attend Doomadgee State School (Early Childhood - Year 10) in neighbouring Doomadgee to the north, but the school would be too distant for students in other parts of the locality.

Lawn Hill Creek has created Lawn Hill Gorge which is filled with freshwater from springs from the limestone plateau to the west. The gorge is an oasis of water and lush vegetation which attracts the wildlife and is surrounded by sandstone cliffs.\nThe Riversleigh World Heritage Area is within the south-east of the national park. It contains fossils from the late Oligocene period, dating back 25 million years. Its world heritage listing reflects that it is one of the most significant fossil deposits in the world, particularly for mammal fossils from Gondwana prior to its separation from other land masses. Fossils found there include crocodiles, lizards, turtles, pythons, fish, snails, and birds.\nIndarri Falls Lookout is at .\nSee also\n* Frank Hann\nReferences"
