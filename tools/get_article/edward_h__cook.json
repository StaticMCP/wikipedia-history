The Chamber is a not-for-profit business federation that advocates and provides services for the 4,500 members in the greater Oklahoma City region. While with the Chamber, he served as the volunteer president from 1974 to 1975, and served again as assistant vice president. The Chamber later hired him to serve as the President and chief executive officer of the Chamber from 1980 to 1987.\nDuring his tenure as president and CEO, the Chamber had a contract with Oklahoma City to spend income from the city's hotel-motel tax to promote tourism events and generate jobs in the tourism industry. While President, Cook helped recruit a General Motors assembly plant and assisted in the establishment of Remington Park horse racing track and casino.\nKeating Administration\nIn 1994, Republican Frank Keating, a former Reagan Administration official, was elected Governor of Oklahoma. Keating tapped Cook to serve as his Secretary of Tourism and Recreation. As Tourism Secretary, Cook oversaw all efforts to promote Oklahoma as a tourist destination. Concurrent with his service as Secretary, Cook also served as the Director of the Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation.\nFollowing Keating's reelection in 1998, Cook stepped down as Tourism Secretary to serve as the coordinator of fund-raising for the State's centennial in 2007. Keating appointed Jane Anne Jayroe, a former Miss America and Oklahoma City TV anchor, to succeed Cook as Secretary.\nReferences"
