The album featured \"Lonesome\" Dave Peverett on vocals, after Chris Youlden left the band the previous spring. Leader/guitarist Kim Simmonds would be the only band member to continue with the band after this album, as all other band members left to form Foghat the following year.\nIt was released by Decca in 1970 (SKL 5066). For release in the United States and Canada, tapes were leased to Parrot Records (PAS 71042).\nThe album spent a week on the United Kingdom Official Charts and reached number 50. It did considerably better in the U.S. where it spent 19 weeks on the Billboard 200, peaking at number 39, their second-highest charting U.S. album.\nTrack listing\nSide one\n# \"Gypsy\" (Kim Simmonds) – 0:57\n# \"Poor Girl\" (Tony Stevens) – 4:04\n# \"Money Can't Save Your Soul\" (Dave Peverett, Simmonds) – 5:34\n# \"Sunday Night\" (Simmonds) – 5:23\n# \"Looking In\" (Peverett, Simmonds) – 5:17\nSide two\n# \"Take It Easy\" (Peverett, Simmonds) – 5:47 (not 3:40 as printed on album)\n# \"Sitting an' Thinking\" (Simmonds) – 2:40\n# \"Leavin' Again\" (Peverett, Simmonds) – 8:29\n# \"Romanoff\" (Simmonds) – 1:01\nPersonnel\nSavoy Brown\n* Kim Simmonds – lead guitar, piano\n* Lonesome Dave – vocals, guitar\n* Roger Earl – drums\n* Tone Stevens – bass\nAdditional musicians\n* Owen Finnegan – congas on some tracks\nTechnical\n* Kim Simmonds – producer\n* Savoy Brown – arrangements\n* Paul Tregurtha – engineer\n* Eric Holand – engineer\n* Harry Fisher – mastering\n* Anthony Hawkins – 1990 CD remastering\n* David Anstey, Jim Baikie – artwork\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
