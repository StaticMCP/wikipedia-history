By that time Csanád had been baptized and become the head of the royal county (comitatus) organized around the fortress at Csanád.\nSince 1526, the county was controlled by the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom. During the Ottoman campaign in 1551-1552, the county was conquered and its territory was incorporated into the newly formed Sanjak of Çanad, within the Temeşvar Eyalet.\nSee also\n* Banat in the Middle Ages\n* Sanjak of Çanad\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
