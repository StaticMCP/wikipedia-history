Originally operated at Coney Island, Cincinnati, Ohio, as Galaxi (1970–1971). Festhaus is currently in this location.\n|\n|-\n| Screamin' Demon\n| 1977\n| 1987\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Arrow Development\n| Also known as The Demon. First looping roller coaster at Kings Island and one of the first in the country to run forwards and backwards through a loop. The ride was sold and relocated to Camden Park in West Virginia where it was renamed to Thunderbolt Express. It last operated there in 1999 and was demolished in November 2004. Congo Falls, Timberwolf are currently in this location.\n|\n|-\n| The Bat\n| 1981\n| 1983\n| Prototype suspended coaster. Although intense, the ride had a fair share of downtime as a result of the designers not banking the track as they did with later suspended coasters. This concept was reintroduced with Top Gun (later renamed Flight Deck) in 1993, which was significantly more reliable. The Bat closed in 1983, remained standing but not operating in 1984, and was demolished in spring 1985. It was replaced with Vortex, the world's first six-looping roller coaster, which opened in 1987. The Bat name would eventually be reused, as Flight Deck was renamed The Bat for the 2014 season.\n|\n|-\n| King Cobra\n| 1984\n| 2001\n| TOGO\n| Prototype Stand-up roller coaster. It was the first stand up coaster with a loop in the United States. It was removed in 2002 due to TOGO going out of business and finding parts became increasingly difficult. The track and supports were stored on the property until it was scrapped in December 2006. Portions of the ride were sent to Kings Dominion to be used as parts for its sister installation, Shockwave. Delirium, Cargo Loco, and Banshee are currently in this location.\n|\n|-\n| Vortex\n| 1987\n| 2019\n| Arrow Dynamics\n| Constructed at a cost of $4 million on the former location of The Bat, Vortex was a steel roller coaster that opened in the park's Coney Mall area as the world's tallest roller coaster at . It also held the record for most inversions, featuring six. Both records were superseded the following year by Shockwave which opened at Six Flags Great America. After 33 seasons, the ride permanently closed during the 2019 season.\n|\n|-\n| Scooby's Ghoster Coaster\n| 1998\n| 2005\n| Caripo(Batflyer)\n| Prototype suspended roller coaster (billed as the first suspended coaster for kids). The ride had poor capacity and roughness complaints. Removed prior to the 2006 season as a part of the change from Hanna-Barbera Land to Nickelodeon Universe. Surf Dog is currently in this location.\n|\n|-\n| Son of Beast\n| 2000\n| 2009\n| Werner Stengel / Roller Coaster Corporation of America\n| Son of Beast was the first wooden roller coaster with a vertical loop and at the time the only wooden hypercoaster. In response to 27 injuries that occurred on July 9, 2006, Cedar Fair installed lighter trains acquired from the Hurricane: Category 5 roller coaster at the former Myrtle Beach Pavilion and removed the loop in order for the new trains to complete the circuit. It reopened on July 4, 2007, but closed indefinitely on June 23, 2009, following another injury report. Park officials confirmed on March 15, 2010, that they had no plans to reopen the ride. It was removed from Kings Island's park map and the ride list on the official web site in early 2010. After reviewing all options, Kings Island officials announced on July 27, 2012, that Son of Beast would be taken down to allow for more park expansion.  The lift hill was demolished on November 20, 2012, at 11:02&nbsp;a.m. ET. An inverted roller coaster, Banshee, was opened on the former Son of Beast site on April 18, 2014, and the station was used for the Haunt attraction Wolf Pack from 2010-2019.\n|\n|-\n|Firehawk\n|2007\n|2018\n|Vekoma\n|A Vekoma Flying Dutchman coaster. Originally known as X-Flight at Geauga Lake from 2001 to 2006, the ride was relocated to Kings Island in efforts to downsize Geauga Lake. The ride reopened at Kings Island the following year under the new name Firehawk. On September 27, 2018, Kings Island announced that they would remove the ride from the park following the 2018 season due to increased downtime and the manufacturer, Vekoma, had stopped supporting the model, causing parts for the ride to become scarce. In August 2019, Kings Island announced that Firehawk would be replaced by Orion in 2020.\n|\n|-\n|}\nFormer rides\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Ride\n!Year\n!Year closed\n!Manufacturer(Model)\n!Description\n|-\n|Boo Blasters on Boo Hill\n|2010\n|2025\n|Sally Dark Rides\n|A dark ride.

The International Street fountain attraction was turned into an ice-skating rink, and for a few years a nightly laser light show was centered on the Eiffel Tower. Most rides were closed with the exception of a holiday-themed train ride, the Grand Carousel, hayrides, and the Enchanted Voyage.  In earlier years, horse-drawn carriage rides existed as well.  Special shops, restaurants, and other holiday-themed activities were also available.  There were live holiday shows at both the American Heritage Music Hall (now the Kings Island Theater) and Festhaus.  The event ended after the 1992 season, but made one additional appearance in 2005. A variety of reasons including low ticket sales prompted new owners Cedar Fair to shelve the idea. In 2016, it was announced that Winterfest would return in 2017 and would be free to all Gold and Platinum pass holders.  Kings Island said that Winterfest would return in 2018 and beyond.\n|}\nFormer Halloween Haunt attractions\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:20%;\"|Former attraction\n! style=\"width:7%;\"|Opened\n! style=\"width:7%;\"|Closed\n! style=\"width:7%;\"|Replaced by\n|\n|\n|-\n|Torture Tower\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2000\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2001\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|N/A\n|-\n|The Freezer\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2000\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2001\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|????\n|-\n|Pirate Jack & the Legend of Halloween in 4-D\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2000\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2001\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|????\n|-\n|The Sewer in 4-D\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2000\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2001\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|Festhaus\n|-\n|The Mummy's Revenge\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2000\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2001\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|Madame Fatale's Cavern of Terror\n|-\n|Museum of Horrors\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2000\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2001\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|Phantom Theater\n|-\n|Freak Show\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2000\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2001\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|Removed\n|-\n|House of Darkness\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2001\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2004\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|R.L.
