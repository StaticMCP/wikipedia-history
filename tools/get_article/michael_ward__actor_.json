He originally trained and worked as a teacher but then retrained at the Central School of Speech and Drama, and won his first film role in 1947, playing Mr Trafford in Alexander Korda's An Ideal Husband.\nCareer\nIn between the years 1947 and 1960, Ward appeared in no fewer than 30 films, making him one of the UK's busiest and most recognisable character actors.\nAs well as five Carry On films, Ward also appeared in four Norman Wisdom films and six made by the Boulting brothers.\nIn the early 1960s television started to take over Ward's career, and until his retirement in 1978 he appeared in (amongst many others) The Jack Benny Programme, The Avengers, The Morecambe and Wise Show, Dixon of Dock Green, The Two Ronnies, Armchair Theatre, Rising Damp and Sykes.\nAfter making what would be his last ever screen outing in 1978's Revenge of the Pink Panther, Ward suffered a stroke which forced him to retire. By 1986, he was unable to walk. He died on 8 November 1997 at St Mary's Hospital in London. He was 88. Ward was an extremely complicated character and never really recovered from the death of his mother in the late 60s. He was also gay (openly from the late 1960s) which caused him a lot of problems. Ward was a very sensitive man and needed to be reassured regularly.\nSelected films\n* An Ideal Husband (1947) – Mr. Tommy Tafford\n* Calling Paul Temple (1948) – Passer-by (uncredited)\n* Saraband for Dead Lovers (1948) – (uncredited)\n* Sleeping Car to Trieste (1948) – Elvin\n* Once a Jolly Swagman (1949) – Artist at Chelsea Party (uncredited)\n* The Queen of Spades (1949) – Officer in the Gaming Room (uncredited)\n* Stop Press Girl (1949) – Hairdressers Manager (uncredited)\n* Marry Me!
