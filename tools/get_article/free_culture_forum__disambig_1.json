It took place in Barcelona every year from 2009 to 2015, jointly with the oXcars, a free culture festival. The oXcars (or OXcars) are a non-competitive awards ceremony held at Sala Apolo in Barcelona, Spain, in October each year. They are a public showcase that puts the spotlight on cultural creation and distribution carried out under the paradigms of shared culture. Through presentations and symbolic mentions of works in a series of categories, real legal situations involving free culture are shown using parody.\nAward ceremonies\nThe Oxcars are an awards ceremony organised by Xnet (previously eXgae, until November 2010), a non-profit organisation that explores alternative models for cultural diffusion and royalties management. In 2008 and 2009 the oXcars were organised with the collaboration of Conservas, and in 2010 with Conservas, Red Sostenible and Telenoika.\nThe awards ceremony is an overview of outstanding projects in the field of free/libre culture and knowledge, with live music, videos, brief presentations, performances and readings.\nSince 2009, the ceremonies have coincided with the FCForum, an international conference in which organisations and experts in free/libre culture and knowledge gather to devise a global strategic framework and an international framework for coordination.\nCategories\nThe award categories include:\n* Music\n* Film\n* Dance\n* Theatre\n* Animation\n* Literature\n* Millions of Visits in Your Bedroom\n* Great Human Tools\n* Future Markets\n* Culture existed before the Cultural Industry\n* Great Leftovers of Spanish Culture\nHistory\n2008 Oxcars\nThe participants of the first Oxcars, on October 28, 2008, were Leo Bassi, The Pirate Bay, literary collective Wu Ming, filmmaker Guillermo Zapata (director of the short film Lo que tú quieras oír), Pablo Soto (developer of the Manolito P2P software), Platoniq, Alan Toner, FreeCinema, Griffi from Sólo los Solo, Molleindustria (with the video game Free Culture Game), Enrique Sierra from 127.es, the Blender Foundation with the 3D short film Big Buck Bunny, Realidades Avanzadas and Matt Black (Coldcut).\nThe evening was rounded off with live sets by K-Sero+Off://TV, Filastine and La Màquina de Turing.\nRelated activities\nA series of activities related to free/libre culture were organised on October 29 and November 1, in conjunction with the 2008 oXcars.

The Free Knowledge Institute. The FCForum 2009 produced the Charter for Innovation, Creativity and Access to Knowledge.\nOfficial observers from the European Community's Commission for Culture and Education, the European Community's Commission for Consumer Protection   Government of Brazil ( were present.\nCharter for innovation, creativity and access to knowledge\nThe Charter for innovation, creativity and access to knowledge contains suggested legal requirements, guidelines for education and access to knowledge, and structural requirements for a knowledge-based society. The guidelines were discussed by more than a hundred representatives at the forum. The Charter was used as an international reference during consultation with the Department of Digital Culture (Government of Brazil). It was used to negotiate sustainable laws with the Spanish Government, and the proposals were presented to the European Council during the Spanish Presidency of the European Union in 2010.

Both documents are based on an understanding that current royalties management and cultural distribution systems have become obsolete in the digital age, and the conviction that free software and peer production and distribution is not incompatible with commercial distribution. The How-To Manual sets out a series of alternative commercial and non-profit models. It insists that the Internet must remain free and open in order to allow online collaboration models to develop, and it must be recognised as a tool that promotes contact between creators and the public. It offers an overview of new models that are already operating in a variety of fields, such as freemium, crowdfunding and micropayment systems in which users make small financial contributions to projects that are looking for seed funding through platforms such as Kickstarter and lanzanos.com or to existing initiatives that are given money depending on the number of users who vote for them. It also claims that the creators of commercial cooperative platforms should share their profits with the creators of the content they publish.\n2010 Oxcars\nThe participants of the 3rd Oxcars in 2010 were the writer José Luis Sampedro, The Pinker Tones, Kate Madison and Actors at Work Productions (creators of the film Born of Hope), dance company Akram Khan, the writer Belén Gopegui, Miguel Brieva, Triolocría, design studio Lava with their Free Magenta campaign (against the Deutsche Telekom patent on the colour magenta), gastronomic blogger Txaber Allué, hip-hop crew At Versaris, the Reactable (collaborative electronic music instrument), the free culture and copyleft festival Te Pica la Barba (with the animated short film Sopa, by Irene Iborra and Jossie Malis), Rojadirecta (a portal that offers sports broadcast through streaming or P2P applications), Koulomek, the Tweetpeli (a collaborative film made through Twitter), leerestademoda.com, Ploomba (a free piped music service), Jerzy Celichowski (from Blinken Open Society Archives), European Digital Rights, Public Domain Day, La Máquina que guía los rayos del sol (animations), Martín Hernández (MotionGraphics) and Kevin Nicoll (illustration).\nFCForum 2011\nThe third annual FCForum was held in Barcelona on October 28, 29 and 30, under the title ‘Networks for a R-evolution’.\nIt included a round table on the current situation of film and the Internet in Spain, with Álex de la Iglesia, Juan Carlos Tous, Amparo Peiró, Eudald Doménech and the lawyer Josep Jover.
