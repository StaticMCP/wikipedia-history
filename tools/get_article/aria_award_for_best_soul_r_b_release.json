It is handed out by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), an organisation whose aim is \"to advance the interests of the Australian record industry.\" A previous category, Best Urban Album, was split into Best Soul/R&B Release and Best Hip Hop Release, which were first presented in 2019.\nTo be eligible, the work must be within the RnB, soul, funk, reggae or dancehall genres. The nominated release must qualify for inclusion in the ARIA Album Chart, and cannot be entered in any other genre categories. The accolade is voted for by a judging school, which comprises between 40 and 100 members of representatives experienced in this genre, and is given to an artist who is either from Australia or an Australian resident. The award for Best Soul/R&B Release was first presented to Kaiit for the single, \"Miss Shiney\".\nWinners and nominees\nIn the following table, the winner is highlighted in a separate colour, and in boldface; the nominees are those that are not highlighted or in boldface.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"19%\" | Winner(s)\n! width=\"19%\" | Album/single title\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" | 2019\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| Kaiit\n| \"Miss Shiney\"\n|-\n| Adrian Eagle\n| \"AOK\"\n|-\n| Genesis Owusu\n| WUTD + Vultures\n|-\n| Matt Corby\n| Rainbow Valley\n|-\n| Tash Sultana\n| \"Can't Buy Happiness\"\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" | 2020\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| Miiesha\n| Nyaaringu\n|-\n| Genesis Owusu\n| \"Don't Need You\"\n|-\n| Kian\n| \"Every Hour\"\n|-\n| Tash Sultana\n| \"Pretty Lady\"\n|-\n| Tkay Maidza\n| Last Year Was Weird, Vol.2\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" | 2021\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| Tkay Maidza\n| Last Year Was Weird (Vol. 3)\n|-\n| Budjerah\n| Budjerah (EP)\n|-\n| Hiatus Kaiyote\n| Mood Valiant\n|-\n| Jack Britten & Ngaiire\n| 3\n|-\n| Tash Sultana\n| Terra Firma\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" | 2022\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| Budjerah\n| Conversations\n|-\n| Emma Donovan & the Putbacks\n| Under These Streets\n|-\n| Kian\n| Shine\n|-\n| Vanessa Amorosi\n| City of Angels\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" | 2023\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| Forest Claudette (featuring EarthGang)\n| \"Mess Around\"\n|-\n| Chanel Loren\n| \"Rollin\"\n|-\n| Jada Weazel\n| \"Skin\"\n|-\n| Kye\n| \"Ribena\"\n|-\n| Pania\n| \"P Stands 4 Playa\"\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" | 2024\n|-style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| Tkay Maidza\n| Sweet Justice\n|-\n| Forest Claudette\n| Jupiter\n|-\n| Milan Ring\n| Mangos\n|-\n| Miss Kaninna\n| \"Blak Britney\"\n|-\n| Pania\n| We Still Young\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
