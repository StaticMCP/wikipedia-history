Encompassing everything ranging from brands, professionals, entrepreneurs and to even groups, the IED presents awards every year to diverse projects and initiatives, raising awareness and promoting them, recognizing their importance and quality, and highlighting the value of design and creativity.\nThe awards take place on a ceremony that, since 2017, has been held in the Italian Embassy in Madrid. The finalists and winners are chosen by a committee of experts madep up of outstanding professionals from the design world and members of the management team of the different IED schools in Madrid.\nThe IED Design Awards include over 18 categories, encompassing the fashion world, interior design, digital design, product design, graphic design and process design, among others.\nIn 2018, the Honorific Award category was added, in order to pay homage to the career of an exceptional professional from the design field. In 2018, the award was granted to the publicist Toni Segarra, who is considered to be the 'best creative of the 20th Century'.
