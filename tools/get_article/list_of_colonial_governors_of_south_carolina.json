Until the beginning of the American Revolution in 1775, South Carolina was a colony of Great Britain. South Carolina was named in honor of King Charles II of England, who first formed the English colony, with Carolus being Latin for \"Charles\".\nProprietary period (1670–1719)\nGovernors of the Proprietary Period were appointed either by the Proprietors or the Grand Council convening in Charles Town. In 1663, Charles II granted the land to eight Lords Proprietors in return for their financial and political assistance in restoring him to the throne in 1660.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Governors of the Province of Carolina (1670 to 1719)\n!scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n!

Legislative bills required royal assent from the governor and could be rejected; he could prorogue or dissolve the Commons House of Assembly on his own authority.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Governors of the Province of South Carolina (1719 to 1775)\n!scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n!
