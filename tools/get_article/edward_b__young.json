Galena during the attack on enemy forts at Mobile Bay, 5 August 1864. Securely lashed to the side of the Oneida which had suffered the loss of her steering apparatus and an explosion of her boiler from enemy fire, the Galena aided the stricken vessel past the enemy forts to safety. Despite heavy damage to his ship from raking enemy fire, Young performed his duties with skill and courage throughout the action.\nYoung died on February 24, 1867, at age 31 or 32 and was buried in Lafayette Cemetery in Philadelphia and reinterred to Evergreen Memorial Park in Bensalem, Pennsylvania in 1947. Evergreen Memorial Park went out of business and became part of Rosedale Cemetery in 1960.\nReferences\n}}"
