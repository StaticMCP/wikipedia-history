The first variation, \"H-39\", called for six ships to be built, essentially as enlarged s with  guns and diesel propulsion. The \"H-41\" design improved the \"H-39\" ship with still larger main guns, eight  weapons, and reinforced deck armor. The Construction Office of the  (OKM) concluded their work with the \"H-41\" design, and were not involved in subsequent plans. Two of them, \"H-42\" and \"H-43\", increased the main battery yet again, with  pieces, and the enormous \"H-44\" design ultimately resulted with  guns. The ships ranged in size from the \"H-39\", which was  long on a displacement of , to the \"H-44\", at  on a displacement of . Most of the designs had a proposed top speed in excess of .\nDue to the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, none of the ships were ever completed; only the first two of the \"H-39\" ships were laid down. What work that had been accomplished was halted; the assembled steel remained on the slipway until November 1941, when the OKM ordered it be sent for scrap and used for other purposes. Contracts for the other four \"H-39\" type ships had been awarded, but no work was begun on any of them before they were canceled. None of the subsequent designs progressed further than planning stages.\nInitial design\nThe earliest design studies for \" H\" (\"Battleship H\") date to 1935, and were near repeats of the early designs for the  ships, armed with  guns. Intelligence indicating that the Soviet Navy was planning the  with  guns prompted the Germans to increase the caliber of the ship's armament to 38&nbsp;cm as well on 5 October 1936. class was actually to be armed with  guns. }} The  (OKM) issued staff requirements at the end of October for a ship of  armed with eight 38&nbsp;cm guns with a speed of . The ship's radius of action was to be at least equal that of the s.\nDesign work on the ship that came to be designated H-39 began in 1937. The design staff was instructed to improve upon the design for the preceding  class; one of the requirements was a larger-caliber main battery to match any battleship built by a potential adversary. After Japan refused to ratify the Second London Naval Treaty in April 1936, an escalator clause went into effect that permitted signatories to arm battleships with guns of up to  caliber, something the United States Navy announced it would do with its planned s. By virtue of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, signed in 1935, Germany was considered to be a party to the other international naval arms limitation treaties.\nAdmiral Werner Fuchs, responsible for the staff section in the OKM that determined the operating requirements for the ship, discussed the vessel's design with Adolf Hitler, the leader of Germany. Hitler demanded guns larger than any possible adversary, but guns of the caliber demanded by Hitler would have required displacements of over  and drafts so deep as to prevent the use of Germany's ports without significant dredging. Fuchs eventually convinced Hitler that the 40.6&nbsp;cm gun was the optimal choice for the H-39 design. In 1938, the OKM developed Plan Z, the projected construction program for the German navy. A force of six H-39 class battleships was the centerpiece of the fleet. Plan Z was finalized by January 1939, when Admiral Erich Raeder, the commander of the , presented it to Hitler. He approved the plan on 18 January and granted the  unlimited power to bring the construction program to fruition.\nOnly four shipyards in Germany had slipways large enough to build the six new battleships. The OKM issued orders for construction of the first two ships, \"H\" and \"J\", on 14 April 1939. The contracts for the other four ships, \"K\", \"L\", \"M\", and \"N\", followed on 25 May. The keels for the first two ships were laid at the Blohm & Voss dockyard in Hamburg and the  shipyard in Bremen on 15 July and 1 September 1939, respectively. The outbreak of war in September 1939 interrupted the construction of the ships. Work on the first two was suspended and the other four were not laid down, as it was believed they would not be finished before the war was over. The keel for \"H\" had  of steel installed,  of steel had been machined, out of  of steel supplied to Blohm & Voss by that point. Only  of steel had been worked into the keel for \"J\", out of  of steel delivered. Steel for the other four ships had been ordered and partially machined for installation, though no assembly work had begun. It was expected to resume work on the ships after a German victory in the war.\nThe ships neither received names nor were official name proposals published. The names, which appear in several publications (, , ) are pure speculation. Especially the often mentioned  (Greater Germany) is highly unlikely, as Hitler always feared the loss of a vessel with the name of Germany (this showed with the renaming of  to ). The only hint on the names of the units were given by Hitler himself, who mentioned during documented unofficial talks, that he would propose the names  and  for the ships, as these names are not connected with persons of the Third Reich or the country itself, so the loss would not have a significant negative psychological and propaganda effect on the German people.\nH-39 specifications\nCharacteristics and machinery\nAs finalized, the H-39 design called for a ship  long at the waterline and  long overall. The beam was to have been  with a designed draft of  at  displacement. At standard displacement, which was , the draft was slightly under the design value, at . With the ship fully loaded, at , draft rose significantly, to . The hull was constructed from transverse and longitudinal steel frames and featured over 90&nbsp;percent welding. The hull contained twenty-one large watertight compartments and a double bottom that extended for 89&nbsp;percent of the length of the keel. Four bilge keels were fitted to improve stability. The ships had an estimated complement of 2,600&nbsp;officers and enlisted men.\nThe ships were to be powered by twelve MAN 9-cylinder double acting 2-stroke diesel engines. The engines were arranged in groups of four, on three shafts, and drove three-bladed screws  in diameter. Four auxiliary boilers were installed to provide backup power; two were oil-fired and were located between the central transmission rooms. The other two, a pair of exhaust gas boilers, were placed above them. The power-plant was rated at  and 256&nbsp;rpm; it provided a top speed of  as designed. The vessels could have carried up to  of diesel oil, which enabled a range of  at , or  at a cruising speed of . The design had one main rudder along the keel behind the center shaft and two smaller wing rudders. Electrical power was to be provided by eight 920&nbsp;kW DC diesel generators at 230 volts and four 460&nbsp;kW AC diesel generators at 110 volts for a total of 9,200&nbsp;kW.\nArmament\n]]\nThe main armament was to consist of eight 40.6&nbsp;cm SK C/34 guns in four twin gun turrets. The  gun was 52&nbsp;calibers long and fired at a muzzle velocity of 810&nbsp;meters per second (2,657&nbsp;ft/s). The guns were supplied with a total of 960 rounds of ammunition or 120 shells per gun; each shell weighed . The guns used a sliding breech block, as was typical for German naval guns of the period; the breech was fully sealed with a  brass cartridge that contained the  main propellant charge. A bagged fore charge weighing  supplemented the main charge. The turrets allowed for elevation to 30&nbsp;degrees, which provided a maximum range of approximately . at 30&nbsp;degrees of elevation, while William Garzke and Robert Dulin specify a range of  at 33&nbsp;degrees.}} Rate of fire was expected to be two rounds per minute per gun. Fire control radar was unspecified, but the ships, which were to have been completed by 1944, presumably would have been equipped with an arrangement similar to that of  as she was outfitted in 1943–44. Several of the 40.6&nbsp;cm guns were constructed before work on the ships was halted; these were later employed as coastal guns, including at Battery Lindemann near Sangatte in France. Ernst Lindemann, the commander of battleship .}}\nTwelve  L/55 C28 guns mounted in six twin turrets comprised the ships' secondary battery. These were the same secondaries employed on the  and  classes. The turrets allowed 40&nbsp;degrees of elevation and had a maximum range of . They fired a  shell at a muzzle velocity of  and were primarily intended for defense against surface threats. The ships were also to be armed with six  torpedo tubes, all submerged. They were all mounted in the bow, diverging from the centerline by 10&nbsp;degrees.\nSixteen dual-mounted  L/65 C33 Flak guns provided long-range defense against aircraft. Unlike those mounted on the  and  classes, these guns were armored to protect their crews from shrapnel, debris, and strafing attacks. The new turrets also provided faster rates of training and elevation as compared to the earlier open mounts. Close-range air defense was provided by a battery of sixteen  L/83 C33 and twenty-four  C38 guns. The 3.7&nbsp;cm guns were placed in eight twin mounts while the 2&nbsp;cm guns were arrayed in six  quadruple mountings. The 3.7&nbsp;cm guns were closely grouped amidships and had a single, common ammunition hoist. Historians William Dulin and Robert Garzke note that the anti-aircraft battery as designed was too weak to effectively defend against the high-performance aircraft that came into service in the late 1930s and 1940s, and speculate that \"it would have been augmented before the ships were completed.\"\nArmor\nThe design team envisioned the H-class ships fighting at relatively close range, and therefore selected the armor system that had been used by German battleship constructors since the  of 1907. The side belt was vertical and was attached directly to the side of the hull, in contrast with the inclined armor belt placed inboard of the side wall used by American and French designers. The side belt, which consisted of Krupp cemented steel armor (KCA), was  thick in the central section that covered the ammunition magazines and machinery spaces. The belt was reduced to  on either end of the main section; the stern and bow were unprotected by the main belt. The upper side belt was  thick. The German navy did not preserve official estimates for the immunity zone, though Garzke and Dulin created an estimate based on the performance of the US /45 caliber gun firing a  shell. The ships' main armor would have rendered them proof against the 16&nbsp;in shell at ranges between . The 16&nbsp;in shell could penetrate the upper side belt at any range, however, which left the ships exposed above the waterline.\nThe underwater protection system was broadly similar to the system employed on the  class. A  thick torpedo bulkhead composed of  steel backed the side armor and provided defense against underwater weapons.\"—\"Wotan soft\"—was a type of steel armor developed by the German navy. It had a breaking strength of 65–75&nbsp;square millimeters and expanded up to 25&nbsp;percent. \"\"—\"Wotan Hard\"—was more rigid and had a breaking strength of 85–96&nbsp;mm2 and expanded up to 20&nbsp;percent. }} The bulkhead was placed  from the side of the hull, though abreast of the turrets and further in the bow and stern, this distance could not be maintained. The distance between the bulkhead and the side of the ship was reduced to  in these areas; the designers compensated for the reduced space by increasing the thickness of the bulkhead to  in these areas.\nTwo armored decks composed of  steel protected the ships from plunging fire and aerial weapons. The upper deck was  thick above the magazines and  over the machinery spaces. The main armored deck was  thick, respectively, though on the outboard sloped sections, thickness was increased to augment the protection over the ships' vitals. Over the magazines, the sloped armor was  thick; over the machinery spaces it was 120&nbsp;mm thick. Concerned with the fate of the battlecruiser  at the Battle of Jutland, was lost during the battle due to uncontrollable flooding caused by heavy damage to her unarmored bow. }} the designers opted to provide relatively heavy bow armor for the H-class ships. A  thick splinter belt protected the bow from shell fragments. It was reasoned that direct shell hits would cause localized damage that could be better isolated than damage from splinters, which could cause extensive flooding.\nThe main battery gun turrets were armored with  thick faces,  thick sides, and  roofs. The rear side of the turret was  thick; in addition to the protection offered by the greater thickness, it also moved the center of gravity of the mounting to the rear, which helped balance the turret and improve its operation. The barbettes upon which the turrets sat were armored with  face-hardened steel above the upper armor deck and  non-cemented steel below the deck. The 15&nbsp;cm gun turrets had  thick faces,  thick sides, and  thick roofs. Their barbettes had  thick armor protection. The 10.5&nbsp;cm mounts were protected by  thick gun shields. The forward conning tower had  thick sides composed of KCA and  thick roof composed of non-cemented steel. The rear conning tower had 100&nbsp;mm thick sides and roof, KCA and non-cemented steel, respectively.\nDesign escalation\nIn early July 1940, Hitler ordered the navy to examine new battleship designs and how wartime experience might be incorporated. A study was completed on 15 July, and contained several recommendations for the H-class ships, including increasing the freeboard and strengthening the horizontal protection. In order to maintain displacement and speed and accommodate the increased weight of the additional armor protection, the design staff drew up an informal design, known as \"Scheme A.\" The design removed one of the main battery turrets to save weight; the propulsion system was also increased in power to keep the same speed as the original design. The original diesel-only system was replaced by a hybrid diesel and steam turbine arrangement. The staff also prepared a second design, \"Scheme B\", which retained the fourth turret and accepted a much higher displacement. This design also incorporated the mixed propulsion system. These studies were abandoned in 1941 after Hitler decided to halt further battleship construction until after the end of the war. The design staff therefore attempted to improve the armor protection for the H-class. The 1940 designs did not form part of the design chain that resulted in the H-41 through H-44 designs.\nH-41\nstandard\n*  combat load\n*  full load\n| length =\n*  waterline\n*  overall\n| beam =\n| draft =  full load\n| propulsion =\n*12 × MAN diesel engines\n*3 × shafts\n| power =\n| speed =\n| range =  at\n| armament =\n* 8 ×  guns\n* 34 ×  guns\n* (all other armament same as H-39)\n| armor               =\n* Upper belt:\n* Decks: ,\n* (all other armor thicknesses same as H-39)\n| notes = Characteristics listed are prior to design changes approved on 15 November 1941\n}}\n}}\nBomb damage sustained by  in July 1941 provided the impetus for the effort to increase the horizontal protection for the H-class. was attacked by British bombers while stationed in La Pallice; she was hit by five bombs, all of which penetrated the ship's armored decks. }} The designers were confronted with a significant problem: any increase in armor could correspondingly increase the displacement and more importantly, the draft. It was necessary to maintain the full-load draft of 11.5&nbsp;m of the H-39 design for operations in the relatively shallow North Sea. The only option that allowed the displacement to be maintained while armor thicknesses to be increased was to reduce the ships' fuel supplies. A 25&nbsp;percent cut in range was required, which was deemed unacceptable by the OKM. It was eventually determined that since deep-water anchorages on the Atlantic coast were available, it would be permissible to allow the draft to increase. The initial redesign called for an increase of only , 40&nbsp;percent of which was additional deck armor, the remainder being used for a larger-caliber main battery.\nOne of the most significant changes was the decision to bore out the over-sized 40.6&nbsp;cm guns to 42&nbsp;cm caliber for the H-41 design. The design staff determined that modifications to the ammunition hoists and loading equipment would be easily effected and that the original turrets could be retained. The OKM was aware that the British had settled on a 40.6&nbsp;cm gun for the proposed ; the 42&nbsp;cm gun would grant the H-41 design a significant advantage over these new adversaries. The ships' armament was otherwise unchanged, apart from an increased number of 2&nbsp;cm anti-aircraft guns, of which there were now to be 34.\nThe ships' main armor decks were substantially strengthened: the deck was increased in thickness from  and the sloped armor at the edges was thickened from . Wartime experience with the  class indicated that the torpedo-defense system was insufficiently strong to protect the H-39 design from underwater damage. Beam was therefore increased, with greater width added at the ends of the armored citadel to allow a greater distance between the side wall and the torpedo bulkhead. The stern section of the torpedo bulkhead was also strengthened structurally to allow it to better contain the force of an underwater explosion. The number of large watertight compartments was increased from twenty-one to twenty-two. A triple bottom was also included in the design, the first time this feature was used in a German warship design. The loss of  in May 1941 also influenced the design; two large skegs were added to the outboard shafts to protect them and increase support for the stern while in drydock. The rudder system was also designed with an explosive charge to detach the rudders in the event they became jammed.\nThe new design measured  long at the waterline and  long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of up to  at full load displacement of about . The increase in weight, while engine power remained constant, reduced speed to . However, German naval constructors were not satisfied with the torpedo side-protection system, and a series of design changes were approved by Admiral Raeder on 15 November 1941; these included increasing the side-protection system depth from , increasing beam to , and greater hull depth and freeboard at full load. These changes resulted in full load displacement increasing to  and maximum speed further decreasing to .\nAs detailed design continued into 1942, the OKM planned to begin construction six to nine months after demobilization, initially at Blohm & Voss and the Deutsche Werke shipyard in Kiel. Deschimag, which had been awarded the contract for \"J\", could no longer be used due to the increase in draft, which precluded travel through the shallow Weser. Following the completion of a new, larger dock at the  in Wilhelmshaven, work would also be done there. The increased size of the ships would have lengthened the building time from four to five years.\nH-42 through H-44\nOn 8 February 1942, Albert Speer became the  for Armaments and Munitions and gained influence over the Navy's construction programs. Speer reassigned some members of the H class design staff to work on new U-boats and other tasks deemed critical to the war effort. The  (New Ships Construction Commission), intended to liaise with Speer and the OKM, was created and placed under the direction of Admiral Karl Topp. This group was responsible for the design work that resulted in the H-42 type, as well as the subsequent designs. The Construction Office of the OKM formally concluded their work on new battleships with the H-41 type in August 1942 and played no further role in battleship development.\nAfter the completion of the H-41 design, Hitler issued a request for a larger battleship and placed no restrictions on gun caliber or displacement. The only requirements were a speed of , horizontal and underwater protection strong enough to protect the vessel from all attacks, and a main battery properly balanced with the size of the ship. The results were purely study projects intended to determine the size of a ship with strong enough armor to counter the rapidly increasing power of bombs deployed by the Allies during the war. The Commission did not discuss its activities with Raeder or his successor, Admiral Karl Dönitz, or with other branches in the OKM. As the designs for the H-42, H-43, and H-44 battleships were purely conjectural, no actual work was begun. The German navy did not seriously consider construction on any of the designs, which were so large that they could not have been built in a traditional slipway. The Construction Office of the OKM sought to disassociate itself from the projects, which they found to be of doubtful merit and unnecessary for German victory.\nThe first design, H-42, was  long between perpendiculars and had a beam of   and a draft of  designed and  at full load. The designed displacement was  and at full load rose to . The dimensions for the second, H-43, increased to  between perpendiculars, a beam of , and design and full load drafts of , respectively. Design displacement was  and estimated at  at full load. For the final design, H-44, the length rose to  between perpendiculars, the beam increased to , and draft rose to  as designed and  at full load. The displacement for H-44 was  as designed and up to  at full load.\nDetails on the propulsion systems for these designs are fragmentary and in some cases contradictory. Erich Gröner notes that \"some [had] pure [diesel] engine propulsion, others [had] hybrid engine/turbine propulsion systems,\" but does not record the type and performance for these propulsion systems. William Garzke and Robert Dulin state that all three designs featured hybrid diesel/steam turbine plants, each supplying  for top speeds of , , and  for H-42, H-43, and H-44, respectively. According to Garzke and Dulin, the designs had a speed of , , and , respectively, on just diesel engine power. Both sources agree on a maximum range of  at a cruising speed of .\nInformation on the armament outfits for the designs is equally contradictory. Both sources agree on the armament for H-44, which was to have been eight  guns. Gröner indicates that H-42 and H-43 were to be armed with eight 48&nbsp;cm guns, while Garzke and Dulin state that the H-42 design was to have retained the 42&nbsp;cm guns from the H-41 design and H-43 would have also been armed with 50.8&nbsp;cm pieces. Both works agree that the secondary armament was to have consisted of twelve 15&nbsp;cm L/55 guns and sixteen 10.5&nbsp;cm L/65 guns as in the previous designs, though the lighter weapons are disputed. Gröner states that all three designs were to be equipped with twenty-eight 3.7&nbsp;cm and forty 2&nbsp;cm anti-aircraft guns, while Garzke and Dulin report only sixteen 3.7&nbsp;cm guns and forty 2&nbsp;cm guns for H-43 and H-44 only; H-42 was to have twenty-four 2&nbsp;cm guns. Both sources concur that six submerged 53.3&nbsp;cm torpedo tubes were included in each design.\nDesigns\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ According to Gröner\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Design\n! scope=\"col\" | H-39\n! scope=\"col\" | H-41\n! scope=\"col\" | H-42\n! scope=\"col\" | H-43\n! scope=\"col\" | H-44\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Displacement\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Length\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Beam\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Draft\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Main\n| 8 ×\n| 8 ×\n| colspan=2 | 8 ×\n| 8 ×\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Secondary\n| colspan=5 | 12 ×  and 16 ×\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | AA\n| 16 ×   and 12 ×\n| 32 ×   and 12 ×\n| colspan=3 | 28 ×   and 40 ×\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Torpedoes\n| colspan=5 | 6 ×\n|}\nFootnotes\nNotes\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n}}"
