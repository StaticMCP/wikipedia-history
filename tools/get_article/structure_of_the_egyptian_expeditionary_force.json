(A special squadron was formed from the 20th Training Wing at Aboukir on 24 October for duty at Nuran under the direct orders of the Palestine Brigade for operations consisting of bombing raids on enemy camps, dumps, trench works and battery positions.)\n::::Aircraft Park – \"X\" Aircraft Park at Abbassia with an advanced stores section at Kantara was responsible for the supplies to the RFC in Palestine.\nAlso in General Headquarters Troops were the\n:VIII Mountain Brigade RGA (10th and 11th Batteries of 3.7inch howitzers)\n:IX Mountain Brigade RGA of \"A\" and \"B\" Batteries of 2.75 inch howitzers and the 12th Battery of 3.7 inch howitzers.\n1918\nThe force initially consisted mostly of British and Egyptian troops, but most of the former were sent to the Western Front in early 1918 to help repel Germany's Spring Offensive.  In the meantime, new troops were then dispatched from India, Australia, and New Zealand, in particular who made up a large portion of the army.  Though it was feared that mostly Muslim Indian troops might desert and join Ottoman Empire forces in the region (who had declared a jihad against the Allies early in the war), this fear proved unfounded, as the Indians fought valiantly on the front lines of most of the army's major engagements. The force also included a small contingent of French and Italian troops. (These were known as the  Détachement Français de Palestine et de Syrie and Distaccamento Italiano di Palestina commanded by Colonel Gilles de Philpin de Piépape & Lieutenant Colonel Francesco D'Agostino respectively.) The forces of the Arab Revolt, led by Prince Feisal of Mecca, were also unofficially attached during Allenby's Damascus offensive.\nsoldiers]]\nThe force's role evolved from a defense of Egypt to the invasion of Palestine which involved: the capture of Beersheba and Gaza in October–November 1917 (see Third Battle of Gaza), entering Jerusalem on 11 December 1917, and Allenby's successful campaign of 1918, resulting in the defeat of the Turks at Megiddo, and the capture of Damascus, Beirut, and Aleppo. The force's successes ultimately led to Turkey's exit from the war and the creation of the British Mandate of Palestine.\nThe Palestine Brigade RAF was reorganised at the end of 1917 or during the summer of 1918, as follows:\n:5th (Corps) Wing\n::No. 14 Squadron RAF\n::No. 113 Squadron RAF\n::No. 142 Squadron RAF\n:40th (Army) Wing\n::No. 111 Squadron RAF\n::No. 144 Squadron RAF\n::No. 145 Squadron RAF\n::No. 1 Squadron AFC\n::No. 21 Balloon Company\n::Nos 49, 50, 57 Balloon Section\nDeployment, 9 February\n* General Headquarters at Bir Salem\n:7th Mounted Brigade at Deir el Belah\n:Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade at Herbieh\n:Imperial Camel Brigade at Rafa\n:20th Indian Brigade at Gaza\n* Desert Mounted Corps at Kh.
