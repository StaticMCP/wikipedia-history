The school focuses on developing \"architectural thinking\" – an interdisciplinary approach to problem-solving – in children aged 6–14 through project-based learning. Since 2022, it operates in Lisbon, Portugal, working primarily with migrant children.\nHistory\nFounded in Minsk in 2016, the school began offline operations. In 2022, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and its regional impact, the school relocated to Lisbon. There, it established activities in Lisbon through partnerships with Portuguese cultural institutions and was registered as a non-governmental organization (NGO).\nMethodology\nThe school's program integrates architecture, urban design, ecology, film and contemporary art through project-based learning. Each term culminates in tangible projects like exhibitions or publications. Professional practitioners teach classes after pedagogical training to adapt their expertise for children. This approach has been documented in international publications including the field guide Archifutures Vol. 5: Apocalypse and featured in the Mexican architecture journal Arquine.\nNotable projects\n* '''HOUSEДОМДОМ: A Book of Children's Projects and other Avant-Garde Architecture''' (2019): Book of children's architectural projects featured in ArchDaily, Tatlin, Afisha Daily and The New East Archive.
