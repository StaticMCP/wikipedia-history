West Virginia voters chose five representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nThis was the first time that West Virginia participated in an election since gaining statehood, as it had been admitted as the 35th state on June 20, 1863. The state would be won by the incumbent President Abraham Lincoln of Illinois, running on the National Union ticket with former Senator and Military Governor of Tennessee Andrew Johnson. They defeated the Democratic candidate 4th Commanding General of the United States Army George B. McClellan of New Jersey and his running mate Representative George H. Pendleton of Ohio. Lincoln won the state by a margin of 36.48%.\nWith 68.24% of the popular vote, West Virginia would prove to be Lincoln's fifth strongest state in terms of popular vote percentage after Kansas, Vermont, Massachusetts and Missouri.\nResults\nReferences"
