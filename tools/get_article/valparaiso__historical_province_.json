This law separated the Quillota Department from the Aconcagua Province, as well as the Valparaíso Department and Casablanca Department from the Santiago Province. Its capital was the city of the same name.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" align=\"center\" width=35%\n|- bgcolor=\"#ececec\"\n! Department!!

The departments of Limache and Casablanca were also abolished.\nAccording to DFL 8582:\n\"Article 1. The country is divided into the following provinces, departments and territories: (...)\n*PROVINCE OF ACONCAGUA.–Capital: Valparaíso.–Departments: Petorca, San Felipe, Andes, Quillota and Valparaíso; (...)\nArticle 2. The departments shall have the boundaries fixed by decree-law number 354 of March 17, 1925, and their current capitals, with the following modifications, in addition to those indicated above: (...)\n*The Quillota Department shall comprise the territory of the former department of the same name, and the part of the former subdelegation 6th Montenegro, of the current Los Andes Department, that lies north of the ridgeline bordering to the south the watershed of the Aconcagua River;\n*The Valparaíso Department shall comprise the territory of the former Limache, Valparaíso and Casablanca departments, and the part of the former subdelegation 5th Lepe, of the current Melipilla Department, that lies north of the ridgeline between Cerro del Roble Alto and Cerro de Las Cardas, passing through Alto de Carén, Cerro de Los Morros and Paso de los Padrones over the Puangue Stream; (...).\"\nLater, in 1936, the Province of Valparaíso was reestablished with the following departments:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" align=\"center\" width=35%\n|- bgcolor=\"#ececec\"\n!
