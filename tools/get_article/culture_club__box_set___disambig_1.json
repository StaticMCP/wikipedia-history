It was released in 2002 on the Virgin label. Some of the songs included are also Boy George solo songs.\nThe box set represents a history of the band with an array of singles, album tracks, demos, remixes, alternative versions, and previously unreleased songs. The inner artwork includes a 72-page glossy booklet, official photos, quotes, and notes from band members. All previously unreleased tracks have been remastered for this release.\nThe track entitled \"Shirley Temple Moment\" is a spoken-word track presenting the making of UK #3 hit \"Victims\", along with a bitter argument between band members while rehearsing it. The fourth CD is totally dedicated to remix versions of both previously released and unreleased tracks, collectively called 'The Drumheads Sessions'.\nTrack listing\nReferences"
