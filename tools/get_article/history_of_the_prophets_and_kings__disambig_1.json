It begins with creation, and charts Muslim and Middle Eastern history from the myths and legends associated with the Old Testament through to the history of the Abbasid era, down to the year 915. An appendix or continuation, was written by Abu Abdullah b. Ahmad b. Ja'far al-Farghani, a student of al-Tabari. Tabari's work appeared during an intense period of canonization of Islamic history, and, in many ways, represented a culminating prism through which future Muslims read and learned about the past.\nDescription\nAl-Tabari's Tarikh is considered one of the main repositories of information about Islamic origins, and certainly among the most important half-dozen or so texts for the events of the Islamic eras it describes. Al-Tabari also organizes his material in an annalistic way, meaning that the events are arranged altogether chronologically (year after year) as opposed to biographically (i.e. narrating the life of one figure, then another, and so on), which makes it, compared to a number of other texts, much more useful to understand the broad historical themes that the text is conveying. Furthermore, Tabari's work is typically considered representative of the mainstream Islamic view as opposed to being closely tied to any particular sectarian interests. What is also helpful is that Tabari often supplies multiple conflicting versions of reports of events that he is aware of. For these reasons, Fred Donner writes:Consequently, it is reasonable to consider al-Ṭabarī's work as a representative product of the early Islamic historiographical tradition, if not, indeed, as the culmination and crowning glory of that tradition.Al-Tabari focuses on a limited number of themes. A significant amount of space is relayed for the pre-Islamic history of Persia; by comparison, very little space is devoted for the histories of Ancient Greece or the Roman Empire. Likewise, significant space is devoted to recounting Old Testament history, but very little to the life of Jesus and narratives concerning the history of the Christian community. Much more attention is given to Iran and Iraq compared to Syria and Egypt. He devotes much more space to documenting political uprisings (even minor ones) and battles compared to more mundane but significant matters of everyday society such as taxation, commerce, industry, agriculture, and so forth. This selectivity is likely a product of a combination of al-Tabari's own interests as well as what sources of information were themselves able for access to al-Tabari as he composed his history.\nFurthermore, al-Tabari also provides a master narrative or history from an Islamic perspective that is ultimately dedicated to demonstrating that Islam is the true religion. The main episodes of this master narrative are:\n# The creation of the world by God\n# The many prophets God sends to warn humanity\n# The history of the empires before Islam. Special focus on Iran.\n# Dedicated histories of the South Arabian kingdoms and northern Arabs pre-Islam. Focus on Mecca and the Quraysh.\n# A life of Muhammad.\n# The succession of caliphs (beginning with Abu Bakr) after the death of Muhammad.\n# The ridda wars (during the reign of Abu Bakr).\n# The early Islamic conquests during the reign of Umar and afterwards.\n# Early civil wars, especially those of Shiite and Khwarij groups.\n# The overthrow of the Rashidun Caliphate by the Umayyad Caliphate, followed by the overthrow of the Umayyad Caliphate by the Abbasid Caliphate\n# A history of Abbasid rule (including uprisings during this time)\n# The succession of governors, commanders, and other figures that represent the human embodiment of the Islamic tradition during this time\nAnother feature of Al-Tabari's work was to introduce methods of hadith into it, meaning that he would supply isnads (chains of transmission) for the reports he mentions. This was important for the ''ta'rikh genre as it had, by then, been seen as lacking in rigor by Islamic scholars specialized in the hadith sciences (known as the muḥaddithūn). In one sense, Al-Tabari can be viewed as having combined the formats of khabar (report/account/narrative) and ḥadīth''.\nContext\nA number of other master narratives of pre-Islamic and Islamic history were written in the era of Al-Tabari. The most well-known is Ibn Ishaq's Al-Sirah al-Nabawiyyah, which largely focuses on the life of Muhammad. Another is the Kitab al-Maghazi of Al-Waqidi, the Kitab al-futuh (Book of Conquests) of Ibn A'tham al-Kufi, and the Futuh al-buldan of Al-Baladhuri. The Book of Idols of Ibn al-Kalbi focuses on the religious pre-Islamic history of Arabia. There was also one annalistic work predating that of Al-Tabari: the ''Ta'rikh'' Khalifa ibn Khayyat (d. 854). This work roughly uses the same outline/approach as does Al-Tabari, with the exception that it omits a discussion of pre-Islamic history. It is also much shorter in general than Al-Tabari's. Another known ''Ta'rikh'' is that of Al-Ya'qubi, which has a moderate Shiite orientation. Al-Ya'qubi covers some topics in more detail that are more briefly or not at all covered by Al-Tabari, including administration, and commentary on India, China, and Egypt. The Kitab al-ta'rikh of Ibn Habib (d. 852) covers early Islamic history with a focus on administrative matters. He also covers biographies of hadith scholars and the region of Al-Andalus. Other works to this effect were written as well.\nSources\nTabari at times draws on the Syriac Julian Romance.\nList of books/volumes\n* Vol. 01 General Introduction and from the Creation to the Flood (Franz Rosenthal)\n* Vol. 02 Prophets and Patriarchs (William Brinner)\n* Vol. 03 The Children of Israel (William Brinner)\n* Vol. 04 The Ancient Kingdoms (Moshe Perlmann)\n* Vol. 05 The Sassanids, the Byzantines, the Lakhmids, and Yemen (C.
