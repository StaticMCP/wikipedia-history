The term was originally used in cricket before being adopted by other sports. The award will usually be given to a player from the winning team, but if a team has lost but a player from the losing team has had an incredible performance then he can also be named as Man of the Match.\nIn Test cricket, the player of the match award became a regular feature in the mid-1980s. It is usually awarded to the player whose contribution is seen as the most important in winning the game, but there have been many instances of a player on the losing team receiving the award.\nIn Test matches, Jacques Kallis holds the record for the highest number of awards, with 23 in 166 matches, followed by Muttiah Muralitharan with 19 awards.\nIn ODI matches Sachin Tendulkar holds the record for the highest number of player of the match awards, with 62 in 463 matches. Sanath Jayasuriya is second with 48.\nIn Twenty20 Internationals, Virandeep Singh leads with 22 player of the match awards.\nAndrea-Mae Zepeda of Austria completed a clean sweep of POTM awards in a WT20I series against Belgium in September 2021. Hayley Matthews achieved the same feat for the West Indies against Australian in October 2023, despite her team losing the series 2–1.\nTest cricket\nNote: Players in bold are still active in Test cricket.\nMost Player of the Match awards in Tests\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

On these occasions, the commentators and other awarding authorities held on to share the awards, without giving the award to a player of the winning team. In Test cricket there have been rare instances when a joint award for man of the match or man of the series has been announced. However, in ODIs and Twenty20 internationals this is usually when a member of the losing team is the highest scorer, such as when Charles Coventry (194) and Tamim Iqbal (154) shared the award after Zimbabwe lost the match. In another interesting match held on 3 April 1996, the whole New Zealand team was awarded the Man of the Match award by adjudicator Basil Butcher who pronounced it a team performance. It was the first time that a whole team had been given the Man of the Match award.\nThere have been only three occasions, one in test cricket and two in ODI cricket, when the whole team has been awarded the man of the match by considering the team performance rather than individual performances.\nTeam Man of the Match awards\nIn Test cricket, South Africa has been awarded Team man of the match award, in the West Indies tour in 1998/99 season. The match was won by South Africa by 351 runs and whole 11 players awarded the man of the match award.\n| team2 =\n| score-team1-inns1 = 313 (92.5 overs)\n| runs-team1-inns1 = Mark Boucher 100 (183)\n| wickets-team1-inns1 = Courtney Walsh 6/80 (24.5 overs)\n| score-team2-inns1 = 144 (47.1 overs)\n| runs-team2-inns1 = Brian Lara 68 (77)\n| wickets-team2-inns1 = Allan Donald 5/49 (13 overs)\n| score-team1-inns2 = 399/5d (115.2 overs)\n| runs-team1-inns2 = Gary Kirsten 134 (305)\n| wickets-team1-inns2 = Carl Hooper 3/117 (36.2 overs)\n| score-team2-inns2 = 217 (75.2 overs)\n| runs-team2-inns2 = Ridley Jacobs 78 (92)\n| wickets-team2-inns2 = Paul Adams 4/64 (21.2 overs)\n| result = South Africa won by 351 runs\n| venue = SuperSport Park, Centurion\n| umpires = Aleem Dar (Pak) and Billy Bowden (NZ)\n| motm = South Africa\n| report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/15874/scorecard/63823/South-Africa-vs-West-Indies-5th-Test Scorecard]\n| toss = West Indies won the toss and elected to field.\n| rain =\n| notes = This is the first time that the West Indies lost a series 5–0.\n}}\nIn ODI cricket, New Zealand team has been awarded man of the match award for their team performances to 4 run victory against the West Indies on 3 April 1996. On 1 September 1996, Pakistan team has been awarded man of the match for their team performance against England for their 2 wicket win.\n| score1 = 158 (35.5 overs)\n| score2 = 154 (49.1 overs)\n| team2 =\n| runs1 = Craig Spearman 41 (39)\n| wickets1 = Laurie Williams 3/16 (4.5 overs)\n| runs2 = Roland Holder 49* (86)\n| wickets2 = Chris Cairns 2/17 (5.1 overs)\n| result = New Zealand won by 4 runs\n| report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/16203/game/64524/West-Indies-vs-New-Zealand-4th-ODI Scorecard]\n| venue = Bourda, Georgetown, Guyana\n| umpires = Clyde Duncan (WI) and Eddie Nicholls (WI)\n| motm = New Zealand\n| toss = West Indies won the toss and elected to field.\n}}\n| score1 = 246 (50 overs)\n| score2 = 247/8 (49.4 overs)\n| team2 =\n| runs1 = Nick Knight 125* (145)\n| wickets1 = Wasim Akram 3/45 (10 overs)\n| runs2 = Saeed Anwar 61 (59)\n| wickets2 = Adam Hollioake 4/45 (8.4 overs)\n| result = Pakistan won by 2 wickets\n| report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/16177/scorecard/65022/England-vs-Pakistan-3rd-ODI Scorecard]\n| venue = Trent Bridge, Nottingham\n| umpires = John Holder (Eng) and David Shepherd (Eng)\n| motm = Pakistan\n| toss = England won the toss and elected to bat.\n| notes = Shahid Anwar, Shadab Kabir and Shahid Nazir (All Pak) made their ODI debuts.\n}}\nJoint awards in Tests\nJoint awards are sometimes given to two players, either from the same team or one from each team.
