An initial order for 16 locomotives was followed by 11 that were financed by the Queensland Phosphate mining group. The second batch differed in having a lower roofline to give better clearance when operating under wires.\nTwo have been scrapped, while between 1997 and 2004, 19 were rebuilt as 2300 class locomotives, and six as 2250 class locomotives at Redbank Railway Workshops.\nReferences"
