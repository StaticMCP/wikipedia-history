These included Chicago, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, The King's Speech, Birdman, and Oppenheimer; The Return of the King, The King's Speech and Birdman instead winning the Academy Award for writing categories. Apollo 13'' is the only film to win all three but failed both to win Best Picture and WGA.\nPGA and DGA\nSince 1990, both PGA and DGA are extremely attached each other can have a high possibility of chances to the eventual winner of Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Directing. With the exception of first four films (1990–1994), only twenty-three films have won two out of four guilds' awards with the remaining fifteen also win both Best Picture and Directing; each five films have won overall with the most consecutive years (2007–2011). The remaining eight films failed to win Best Picture or Directing: exceptional films did not win Best Picture including Apollo 13, Saving Private Ryan, Brokeback Mountain, Gravity, La La Land and 1917; exceptional films did not win Best Directing including Apollo 13, Chicago, Argo, and 1917; only Apollo 13 and 1917 are the only films failed to win Academy Awards.\nSee also\n* Big Four (American film critics awards)\n* Big Five (Academy Awards)\nReferences"
