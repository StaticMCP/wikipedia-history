But I'd be open to it if someone came up with the right concept.\" Later, Fraser told Pete Hammond that although he does not know any details about a reboot, he was not against returning.  On May 11, 2024, series creator and director, Stephen Sommers told The Hollywood Reporter that a new installment \"would have to be something really special. Of course, I would work with all of those actors again.\"\nIn November 4, 2025, it was reported that a fourth film in the Sommers Mummy series was in development, with Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett as directors and David Coggeshall writing the screenplay.  Fraser and Rachel Weisz are returning to reprise their roles as Rick O'Connell and Evelyn Carnahan-O'Connell. The Hollywood Reporter mentioned that the film would disregard the events of Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.\nReferences"
