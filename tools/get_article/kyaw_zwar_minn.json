Myanmar recalled Kyaw Zwar Minn on 9 March 2021, after he publicly called for the release of jailed State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi. He refused to return to Myanmar citing safety concerns. On 7 April 2021, Minn was locked out of the Embassy of Myanmar in London. British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab condemned the \"bullying actions of the Myanmar military regime\", but the Foreign Office has stated that it \"must accept the decision taken by the Myanmar regime\".\nHe previously served as Burmese Ambassador to France, and non-resident Ambassador to Andorra, Spain and Switzerland.\nOn 6 May 2025, the Metropolitan Police charged Kyaw Zwar Minn  with trespassing on a diplomat's premises. His first appearance at Westminster Magistrates' Court begins on May 30th.\nReferences"
