In 1888, Evershed played non first-class matches for an Oxford University team and for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and then regularly for Derbyshire while they were without first-class status until 1893.\nEvershed made one first-class appearance for Derbyshire in 1898, as wicketkeeper against Warwickshire. During the season a number of players kept wicket instead of the regular William Storer who still took part in the matches. Evershed batted during the first innings, but did not make a contribution during the second, as the match petered out to a draw.\nEvershed was a right-handed batsman and a wicket-keeper, and made one run in the first-class game.\nEvershed was the co-founder, with Francis Martin Tomkinson, of Evershed and Tomkinson, the Birmingham firm of solicitors, in 1914. His name has been retained during the course of numerous mergers which have led to the firm of Evershed Sutherland, one of the largest law firms in the world. The extraordinary story of the development of the firm is described in A Global Journey, published by the firm in 2017.\nEvershed died in Handsworth Wood. His brothers, Sydney, Wallis, and Frank, and cousin Geoffrey Bell, all played first-class cricket, while William Evershed also played first-class cricket in first half of the 19th century.\nReferences"
