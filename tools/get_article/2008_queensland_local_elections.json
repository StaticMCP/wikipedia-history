This was in part due to the number of financially weak councils with small populations in rural areas, dating from an earlier time when industry and population had justified their creation. The Commission reported back on 27 July 2007, recommending massive amalgamations all over the State into \"regional councils\" centred on major towns or centres, based on a range of criteria such as economy of scale, community of interest and financial sustainability.\nOn 10 August 2007, the commission's amalgamation recommendations passed into law as the Local Government (Reform Implementation) Act 2007, with only a few name changes as alterations. \"Local Transition Committees\" (LTCs) were created for each new area, made up of councillors and staff from the original areas, with the old entities formally ceasing to exist on the day of the local elections.\nResults\nSee also\n*2008 Queensland mayoral elections\n*2008 Brisbane City Council election\n*2008 Gold Coast City Council election\n*2008 Townsville City Council election\nReferences"
