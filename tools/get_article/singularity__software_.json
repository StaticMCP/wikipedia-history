In October of that year Sylabs released version 3.0.0 which was a rewrite in the Go programming language.\nApptainer / Singularity split\nIn May 2020 Gregory Kurtzer left Sylabs but retained leadership of the Singularity open source project.  In May 2021 Sylabs made a fork of the project and called it SingularityCE.  In November 2021 the Singularity open source project joined the Linux Foundation and was renamed to Apptainer.\nFeatures\nSingularity is able to support natively high-performance interconnects, such as InfiniBand and Intel Omni-Path Architecture (OPA).\nSimilar to the support for InfiniBand and Intel OPA devices, Singularity can support any PCIe-attached device within the compute node, such as graphic accelerators.\nSingularity also has native support for Open MPI library by utilizing a hybrid MPI container approach where OpenMPI exists both inside and outside the container.\nThese features make Singularity increasingly useful in areas such as machine learning, deep learning and most data-intensive workloads where the applications benefit from the high bandwidth and low latency characteristics of these technologies.\nIntegration\nHPC systems traditionally already have resource management and job scheduling systems in place, so the container runtime environments must be integrated into the existing system resource manager.\nUsing other enterprise container solutions like Docker in HPC systems would require modifications to the software.\nDocker containers can be automatically converted to stand-alone singularity files which can then be submitted to HPC resource managers.\nSingularity seamlessly integrates with many resource managers including:\n* HTCondor\n* Oracle Grid Engine (SGE)\n* SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management)\n* TORQUE (Terascale Open-source Resource and QUEue Manager)\n* PBS Pro (PBS Professional)\n* [https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/external/singularity HashiCorp Nomad] (A simple and flexible workload orchestrator)\n* IBM Spectrum LSF\nSee also\n* Grid computing\n* OverlayFS\n* TOP500\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* [https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3147213.3147231 Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing: Is Singularity-based Container Technology Ready for Running MPI Applications on HPC Clouds?]\n* [https://www.hpcwire.com/2017/11/01/sc17-singularity-preps-version-3-0-nears-1m-containers-served-daily/ Singularity prepares version 3.0, nears 1 million containers served daily]\n* [https://downloads.dell.com/Manuals/all-products/esuprt_solutions_int/esuprt_solutions_int_solutions_resources/high-computing-solution-resources_White-Papers10_en-us.pdf Dell HPC: Containerizing HPC Applications with Singularity]\n* [https://software.intel.com/en-us/download/introduction-to-high-performance-computing-hpc-containers-and-singularity Intel HPC Developer Conference 2017: Introduction to High-Performance Computing HPC Containers and Singularity]\n* [https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/hpcwire-reveals-winners-2017-readers-editors-choice-awards-sc17-conference-denver/ HPCwire Reveals Winners of the 2017 Readers' and Editors' Choice Awards at SC17 Conference in Denver: Singularity awarded for Best HPC Programming Tool or Technology category]\nExternal links\n*"
