He was appointed director of the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) in April 2016, a national grant-funded network and coordinating center that was established in 1991. He holds the Epstein Family Chancellor's Chair in Alzheimer's Disease Research at UC San Diego. Prior to joining UC San Diego, he was on faculty at University of British Columbia where he served as the Head of the Division of Neurology, the Director of the Alzheimer's and Related Disorders Clinic and the Executive Associate Dean for Research for the Faculty of Medicine.\nEarly life and education\nHe received his MDCM degree from McGill University in Quebec, Canada in 1978. He is board certified in Neurology by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. His neurology practice has focused on the subspecialty care of dementia and neurodegenerative disorders. He is licensed with the Medical Board of California.\nCareer\nFollowing his MDCM from McGill University, Dr. Feldman undertook his residency training in Internal Medicine and Neurology at McGill University, University of Colorado, and University of British Columbia where he also completed a fellowship with focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and neuromuscular diseases. He held academic ranks at the University of British Columbia in the Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, from clinical instructor 1991, clinical assistant and clinical associate professor with promotion to full professor in 2001.\nHe served as the head of a number of academic programs at UBC including its Alzheimer Clinical Trials Program, its head injury program and in 2005 its Clinic for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders. He served as Head of the Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine at UBC from 2001 to 2008 before a secondment to Bristol-Meyers Squibb from 2009 to 2011 where he served as vice-president and Therapeutic Area Head of Neuroscience for Global Clinical Research and Development. He returned to UBC in 2012 where he resumed his clinical and academic activities while also serving as Executive Associate Dean of Research for UBC Faculty of Medicine. He joined UC San Diego in 2016 to take on the leadership of the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study and to serve as Dean for Alzheimer's Disease and Neurodegenerative Research.\nHe currently holds Affiliate Faculty membership at the University of British Columbia Department of Medicine since 2016 and Professor Adjunct at Yale University School of Medicine since 2011. He served as adjunct professor at McGill University Center for Aging from 1995 till 2022.\nResearch\nHe has contributed to scientific discoveries and clinical research studies focused on aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and diagnostic/therapeutic trials. He has led several international clinical trials in AD resulting in important original data and informing care across the continuum of the disease. In the field of frontotemporal dementia, he has contributed to the discoveries of the progranulin and C9ORF72 genetic mutations as well as to the elucidation of TDP43.\nHis research focuses on the epidemiology, natural history and experimental therapeutics of Alzheimer's disease and dementia within an approach that includes longitudinal observational cohort studies in clinical and population samples, disease modelling, clinical pathological correlative studies and clinical trials across the spectrum of preclinical to most severe dementia stages. These interests have included the development of novel diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease.\nHe contributed to the discoveries of the progranulin and C9ORF72 genetic mutations which cause FTD and FTD with motor neuron disease.\nIndustry experience\nFrom 2009 to2011, he took a leave from his academic appointment at UBC to take on a senior leadership role as therapeutic area head for neuroscience global clinical research at Bristol-Myers Squibb, where his research focused on developing novel pharmaceutical therapies for neurodegenerative and other neurological/psychiatric disorders.\nAcademic research\n* Mohr E, Feldman HH, and Gauthier SG.
