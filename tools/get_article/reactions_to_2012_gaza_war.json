The international community must put pressure on both sides to fully respect the laws of war and protect civilian lives and property.\"\n* The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights called for intervention on the part of the international community to restore the rule of law. Remarking that all States are bound by a legal obligation to 'ensure respect' for international humanitarian law in all circumstances, it states that the international community's failure to hold Israel accountable for its behavior in the occupied Palestinian territory \"has resulted in pervasive impunity.\"\n* Human Rights Watch said that \"Israeli and Palestinian forces alike need to make all feasible efforts to avoid harming civilians,” and \"there is no justification for Palestinian armed groups unlawfully launching rockets at Israeli population centers.” It accused Israel of using disproportionate force in its attacks and of firing at rescuers of victims of Israeli shelling.

B'Tselem added that Hamas combatants, as well as other armed groups operating against Israel, fire at Israeli civilian targets from within Palestinian civilian areas and do not distinguish themselves from the civilian populations, actions which B'Tselem consider a war crime and \"severe violation of International Humanitarian Law\". B'Tselem pointed out that Israeli officials are using the conduct of militants to justify harm to Palestinian civilians and stated that the fact that Hamas combatants and other organizations commit war crimes does not automatically justify Israeli actions that harm civilians, and called upon Israel to follow its legal and moral duty to minimize as much as possible harm to civilians, despite Hamas' illegal conduct.\nProtests\nCountries in which rallies and protests in support of the Palestinians took place included Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, Yemen, Italy, United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Poland, South Africa, Germany, Belgium, Israel, Argentine, Chile, Venezuela, South Korea, Hong Kong, Norway[http://www.dagbladet.no/2012/11/17/nyheter/innenriks/gaza/palestina/24420880/ Demonstrerte mot Israels bomberegn ved ambassaden i Oslo - nyheter - Dagbladet.no] and Japan.
