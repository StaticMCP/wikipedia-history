Adlercreutz had forgot about this landing and didn't send any troops to help Bergenstråhle. The Swedes, numbering 1,300–1,400 men, landed just outside Vaasa, but the Russians, strengthened by the arrival of the Russian main army turned out to be too strong. After some harsh street battles, the Russians lost 37 killed, 82–113 wounded (five officers) and, according to certain sources, 53 captured; in total 150–172 men. By their own accounts, the Swedes had lost 76 men killed or severely wounded, two lightly wounded, and 194 captured (including the commander). According to Russian sources, up to 300 Swedes were killed and wounded, and 250 privates and 17 officers captured; in total 567 men. The remaining forces retreated northwards, to the Swedish main army at Nykarleby, and created the Sixth [Swedish] brigade.\nRussian forces\n*Infantry (1,488)\n*Cossacks (200)\n*Guns (4)\nIn total: 1,688 men and 4 guns\nSwedish forces\n*Västerbotten Infantry Regiment (1 battalion)\n*Västerbotten auxiliary reserve and Jämtland Infantry Regiment (1 battalion; including 2 Jämtland companies)\n*Peasants (200–300)\n*Guns (4)\nIn total: 1,300–1,400 men and 4 guns\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*|author=Generalstaben|author-link=General Staff (Sweden)|language=sv|year=1910|publisher=Kongl. boktryckeriet P.
