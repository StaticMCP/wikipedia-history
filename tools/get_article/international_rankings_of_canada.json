Canada ranks high on its social, legal, healthcare and education systems with its universities ranked among the best in the world. The country consistently ranks high in other various indices measuring factors such as human rights, quality of life, safety, happiness, prosperity and sustainability. This has led to Canada being recognized as one of the best countries in the world to live. Despite these facts there are varied domestic concerns, Canada ranks among  the lowest of the most developed countries for housing affordability,  technology affordability, healthcare accessibility, and  foreign direct investment.\nInternational rankings\nWorldwide rankings\nNote: Below each survey uses a limited number of countries/region's for its assessments, see \"Measurement(s)\" for number variables.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable sticky-header\" style=text-align:left\" style=\"margin:1em auto;\"\n|- \"\n!
