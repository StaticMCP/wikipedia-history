Former presidential candidate and Tennessee's Senator Estes Kefauver defeated Massachusetts' Senator John F. Kennedy.\nBackground\nSenator John Sparkman, who was the party's vice presidential nominee in 1952, was mentioned as a possible presidential candidate and later became the head of Alabama's delegation to the national convention, but did not attempt the presidential or vice presidential nomination.\nOn July 9, Governor Frank G. Clement, who was speculated as a possible vice presidential candidate, was selected to give the keynote address at the national convention, but he stated that he had no intention of seeking the vice presidency.\nFormer Massachusetts Governor Paul A. Dever stated that although Kennedy was not an active candidate he was in the running for the vice presidential nomination and that the Massachusetts, Missouri, Ohio, Michigan, and New Jersey delegations would support him. Senator Spessard Holland stated that a Stevenson-Kennedy ticket would easily carry Florida, and other Kennedy supporters stated that having a Catholic vice presidential nominee would guarantee 132 electoral votes along with those from the Solid South.\nCalifornia Attorney General Pat Brown came out in support of an open vice presidential ballot and that Senators Hubert Humphrey, John F. Kennedy, Al Gore Sr., and Governor Clement were excellent choices.\nBalloting\nAfter winning the presidential nomination, Adlai Stevenson II announced that he would allow the convention delegates to choose his running mate and did not support any candidate. Governor W. Averell Harriman, who had received the second highest amount of delegates on the presidential ballot, also announced that he was not interested in the vice presidential nomination.\nOn August 16, 1956, the vice presidential ballot started with multiple Southern favorite sons being supported on the first ballot. The Southern delegations planned to deny Estes Kefauver a majority on the first ballot, due to his anti-segregation views, and then to unify behind an acceptable candidate. Kefauver's home state, Tennessee, supported Senator Al Gore Sr. on the first ballot and then realigned its support to Kennedy on the second and third ballots.\nAfter initially leading on the first ballot Kefauver fell behind Kennedy on the second before receiving a majority on the third ballot after Gore withdrew and endorsed him, resulting in Kefauver in first place and Kennedy in second. Governor Orval Faubus, who had opposed Kefauver's nomination, stated that his nomination \"leaves us with a lot of hard work to do before November\".\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Vice Presidential Balloting\n|-\n!Candidate||1st (Before Shifts)||1st (After Shifts)||2nd (Before Shifts)||2nd (During Shifts)||2nd (After Shifts)||Unanimous\n|-\n!Kefauver\n|style=\"background:#5cb3ff\"|466.5\n|style=\"background:#5cb3ff\"|483.5\n|style=\"background:#82caff\"|551.5\n|style=\"background:#82caff\"|551.5\n|style=\"background:#5cb3ff\"|755.5\n|style=\"background:#5cb3ff\"|1,372\n|-\n!Kennedy\n|style=\"background:#82caff\"|294.5\n|style=\"background:#82caff\"|304\n|style=\"background:#5cb3ff\"|618\n|style=\"background:#5cb3ff\"|648\n|style=\"background:#82caff\"|589\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|\n|-\n!Gore\n|style=\"background:#c2dfff\"|178\n|style=\"background:#c2dfff\"|178\n|style=\"background:#c2dfff\"|110.5\n|style=\"background:#c2dfff\"|80.5\n|style=\"background:#c2dfff\"|13.5\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|\n|-\n!Wagner\n|162.5\n|162.5\n|9.5\n|9.5\n|6\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|\n|-\n!Humphrey\n|134\n|134.5\n|74.5\n|74.5\n|2\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|\n|-\n!Hodges\n|40\n|40\n|0.5\n|0.5\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|0\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|\n|-\n!Maner\n|33\n|33\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|0\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|0\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|0\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|\n|-\n!Collins\n|28.5\n|1.5\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|0\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|0\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|0\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|\n|-\n!Anderson\n|16\n|16\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|0\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|0\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|0\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|\n|-\n!Clement\n|13.5\n|13.5\n|0.5\n|0.5\n|0.5\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|\n|-\n!Brown\n|1\n|1\n|0.5\n|0.5\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|0\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|\n|-\n!Symington\n|1\n|1\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|0\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|0\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|0\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|\n|-\n!Johnson\n|0.5\n|0.5\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|0\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|0\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|0\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|\n|-\n!Not Voting\n|3\n|3\n|6.5\n|6.5\n|5.5\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3\"|\n|}\nReferences"
