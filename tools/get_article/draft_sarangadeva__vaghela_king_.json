Regarded as one of the most potent rulers of his dynasty, he expanded his domain by waging wars with the Yadavas, Paramaras and Jethwas.\nHis reign saw the last period of strength and prosperity of the Vaghelas until its collapse during the reign of his nephew, Karna.\nMartial campaigns\nWars with neighboring states\nAn effective warrior and army leader, during his reign, he was able to defeat the Seunas and Paramaras under their rulers Ramachandra of the Seunas and Arjuna II, Bhoja II and Mahalakadeva of the Paramaras,Asoke Kumar Majumdar, Chaulukyas of Gujarat: A Survey of the History and Culture of Gujarat from the Middle of the Tenth to the End of the Thirteenth Century (Bombay: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1956), pp. 181–182. with the last two Paramara rulers being puppets of Paramara prime minister, Gogadeva.\nInvasions, continued wars and expansion\nIt is said in Inscriptions of the time that during his reign, he was able to repel a Turuksha (Turkic) invasion. This could be Mongol raiders, or Balban's forces.Asoke Kumar Majumdar, Chaulukyas of Gujarat: A Survey of the History and Culture of Gujarat from the Middle of the Tenth to the End of the Thirteenth Century (Bombay: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1956), p. 183. Prior to the Turkic invasion, he helped the ruler of Abu, Pratapasimha recover his domains from the Guhila ruler Samarasimha. He also sent an expedition against the Jethva chief Bhanu.Asoke Kumar Majumdar, Chaulukyas of Gujarat: A Survey of the History and Culture of Gujarat from the Middle of the Tenth to the End of the Thirteenth Century (Bombay: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1956), p. 184.\nDelhite attack on Jalore, Sanchore Confrontation\nHis final prominent campaign was against the Khalji ruler of Delhi, Jalal-ud-din Khalji. During this period, Jalaluddin invaded the Chahamana kingdom under Samantasimha. However, Sarangadeva was able to successfully liberate the Chahamana ruler from the attack of the Khalji sultan by marching against the Delhite army and forcing Jalaluddin to retreat.Ashok Kumar Srivastava, The Chahamanas of Jalor (Gorakhpur: Sahitya Sansar Prakashan, 1979), p. 36.Dasharatha Sharma, Early Chauhān Dynasties: A Study of Chauhān Political History, Chauhān Political Institutions, and Life in the Chauhān Dominions from C. 800 to 1316 A.D. (Delhi: S. Chand, 1959), p. 159.\nCultural patronage\nHis reign did not see any decline in the cultural prosperity of the Vaghela dynasty, which likely continued to patronise Jain arts and architecture and support the construction of Hindu temples.\nSuccession\nSarangadeva was succeeded by Karna II, who would be the last Vaghela sovereign of Gujarat. He was defeated by Delhite military commander Ulugh Khan, a general of Alauddin Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate.Dasharatha Sharma, Early Chauhān Dynasties: A Study of Chauhān Political History, Chauhān Political Institutions, and Life in the Chauhān Dominions, from 800 to 1316 A.D. (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1956), p. 96.\nLegacy\nRegardless of the poor series of events that occured after the end of his reign, Sarangadeva can perhaps be regarded as one of if not the most potent Sovereign to have ever reigned over the Vaghela dynasty and one of the most prominent rulers of hindu Gujarat, though not as famous as Chaulukya rulers such as Bhima I or Jayasimha Siddharaja, or even Valabhi rulers such as Shiladitya I, Dhruvasena II Baladitya or Shiladitya VI Dhrubhaṭa.\nReferences\nBibiliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
