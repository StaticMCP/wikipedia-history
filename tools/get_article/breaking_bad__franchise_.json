The fictional universe is sometimes informally referred to as the \"Gilliverse\".\nBreaking Bad revolves around chemistry teacher-turned-methamphetamine drug lord Walter White (Bryan Cranston) and his former student and fellow crook Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul). Better Call Saul, the prequel / sequel series, follows the origins and eventual fate of criminal lawyer Jimmy McGill / Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), whom Walter and Jesse eventually hire in Breaking Bad, as well as police officer-turned-criminal and cleaner Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), who becomes associated with all three men over the course of both series. El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie, the sequel film, concludes the story of Jesse, now a fugitive, after the events of Breaking Bad. Gilligan said he felt the three works can be seen independently from one another, but exist in the same framework and need to be viewed together to receive the full experience.\nThe two television series and the film are set in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and give a modernized twist to Westerns set in the region. Each of the three entries were produced at Albuquerque Studios and emboldened success for the media in the city and film in the state. Both series originally aired on AMC, while the film premiered on Netflix, on which the two television series aired internationally (outside of United States). The franchise is owned by Sony Pictures Television and received strong critical acclaim; numerous awards were given to Breaking Bad, to Better Call Saul, and to El Camino.\nThe Breaking Bad franchise has since expanded across several different mediums and multimedia platforms, with varying degrees of contributions from its cast and crew. This includes the talk shows Talking Bad (2013) and Talking Saul (2016–2022), the Spanish-language adaptation Metástasis (2014),  the parody musical Faking Bad (2018), and the animated short-form series ''Slippin' Jimmy (2022).\nTelevision series\n| end1          =\n| infoA1        = Vince Gilligan\n| color2        = #2C6576\n| link2         = Breaking Bad season 2\n| episodes2     = 13\n| start2        =\n| end2          =\n| color3        = #555555\n| link3         = Breaking Bad season 3\n| episodes3     = 13\n| start3        =\n| end3          =\n| color4        = #C58F10\n| link4         = Breaking Bad season 4\n| episodes4     = 13\n| start4        =\n| end4          =\n| color5A       = #016640\n| link5         = Breaking Bad season 5\n| episodes5     = 16\n| episodes5A    = 8\n| start5A       =\n| end5A         =\n| color5B       = #A9A9A9\n| episodes5B    = 8\n| start5B       =\n| end5B         =\n}}\n| end1          =\n| infoA1        = Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould\n| color2        = #CFB7A0\n| link2         = Better Call Saul season 2\n| episodes2     = 10\n| start2        =\n| end2          =\n| color3        = #4F4F5E\n| link3         = Better Call Saul season 3\n| episodes3     = 10\n| start3        =\n| end3          =\n| color4        = #111111\n| link4         = Better Call Saul season 4\n| episodes4     = 10\n| start4        =\n| end4          =\n| infoA4        = Peter Gould\n| color5        = #6d4955\n| link5         = Better Call Saul season 5\n| episodes5     = 10\n| start5        =\n| end5          =\n| color6        = #B11222\n| link6         = Better Call Saul season 6\n| episodes6     = 13\n| episodes6A    = 7\n| start6A       =\n| end6A         =\n| episodes6B    = 6\n| start6B       =\n| end6B         =\n}}\n}}\nBreaking Bad (2008–2013)\nBreaking Bad}}\nBreaking Bad'' tells the story of Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an underpaid, overqualified, and dispirited high-school chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, New Mexico. After being diagnosed with stage-three lung cancer, he enlists the help of his former chemistry student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), to produce and distribute crystal meth to secure his family's financial future. He tries to leave the drug-making business but continues to be drawn into the criminal underworld, and soon becomes a major drug kingpin under the name \"Heisenberg\" which he continues to hide from his family and friends.\nAmong the show's co-stars are Anna Gunn and RJ Mitte as Walter's wife Skyler and son Walter Jr., and Betsy Brandt and Dean Norris as Skyler's sister Marie Schrader and her husband Hank, a DEA agent. Others include Bob Odenkirk as Walter's and Jesse's lawyer Saul Goodman, Jonathan Banks as private investigator and fixer Mike Ehrmantraut, and Giancarlo Esposito as drug kingpin Gus Fring. The final season introduces Jesse Plemons as the criminally ambitious Todd Alquist, and Laura Fraser as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle, a cunning business executive secretly managing Walter's global meth sales for her company.\nBreaking Bad was created by Vince Gilligan, who had spent several years writing the Fox series The X-Files. Gilligan wanted to create a series in which the protagonist became the antagonist. He added that his goal with Walter White was to turn him from Mr. Chips into Scarface.\nThe show aired on AMC from January 20, 2008, to September 29, 2013, consisting of five seasons for a total of 62 episodes. Breaking Bad received widespread acclaim and has been praised by many critics as one of the greatest television shows of all time. The series would receive a total of sixteen Emmy Awards throughout its run.\nBetter Call Saul (2015–2022)\nBetter Call Saul}}\nBetter Call Saul focuses on Saul Goodman's life, six years before he became Walter's lawyer, as Jimmy McGill, a more earnest lawyer trying to turn away from his troublesome con-man days. Throughout the series, Jimmy gradually transforms into Saul Goodman, a morally compromised and flamboyant criminal defense lawyer who assists criminals in their misdeeds. The show also features segments and eventually full episodes centering on Goodman's fate after the events of Breaking Bad.\nBob Odenkirk would reprise the titular role for the spin-off. Additionally, Jonathan Banks and Giancarlo Esposito star and reprise their roles as Mike Ehrmantraut and Gus Fring, respectively, while several other Breaking Bad cast members have guest-starred on the show. Newcomers to the starring cast of Better Call Saul include Rhea Seehorn as Jimmy's love interest and fellow attorney Kim Wexler, Michael McKean as Jimmy's older brother Chuck McGill, Patrick Fabian as Jimmy's rival attorney Howard Hamlin, Michael Mando as the cunning criminal Nacho Varga, and Tony Dalton as Lalo Salamanca, the charismatic enforcer who later helps run his family's drug business.\nSaul Goodman was originally to appear in Breaking Bad in four episodes within the show's second season, but became a main character through the rest of the show's run in part due to being a fan favorite and the strength of his acting abilities. Odenkirk, Vince Gilligan, and Peter Gould, who wrote the episode that introduced Goodman, started discussions near the end of Breaking Bad of a possible spin-off expanding on the character. They eventually settled on the idea of a prequel to show the origins of Saul about six years prior to the events of Breaking Bad. In April 2013, AMC and Sony Pictures Television expressed interest in Gilligan and Gould's spin-off series concept, and they officially ordered Better Call Saul on September 11, 2013.\nThe show aired on AMC from February 8, 2015, to August 15, 2022, consisting of six seasons for a total of 63 episodes. . Better Call Saul has received similar critical praise as Breaking Bad, with some even deeming it superior to its predecessor. It is considered as a prime example of how to produce a spinoff work that defies the usual expectations of such forms.\nFilm\nEl Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie (2019)\nEl Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie}}\nEl Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie follows the events of Breaking Bads series finale \"Felina\", as Jesse Pinkman tries to outrun his misdeeds and searches for his freedom to Alaska. Aaron Paul reprised the role of Jesse after a six-year absence, and several other Breaking Bad characters would make appearances.\nVince Gilligan wrote, directed and produced the film. While writing \"Felina\", Gilligan asked himself what happened to Jesse after the events of the series. Near the tenth anniversary of Breaking Bads premiere, Gilligan started sharing the idea of creating a sequel film based on this concept. Paul, who portrayed Jesse on the series and who still felt attached to the character, expressed eagerness to be involved with any idea for a Breaking Bad continuation. When Gilligan made his initial film pitch to Sony Pictures Television, the executives in the room quickly agreed to come on board. After completing the script, Gilligan selectively shopped the film to a few potential distributors, settling on Netflix and AMC due to their history with the show.\nThe sequel film was formally announced in February 2019. It was released exclusively on Netflix on October 11, 2019, and was broadcast on AMC on February 16, 2020. Critics praised Gilligan's direction and Paul's performance, but gave a mixed consensus regarding the film's necessity to Breaking Bads chronology.\nWeb series\nBreaking Bad: Original Minisodes (2009–2011)\nList of Breaking Bad episodes § Breaking Bad: Original Minisodes (2009–2011)}}\nBreaking Bad: Original Minisodes is a web series based on the television series Breaking Bad.

These were released over the course of each season on YouTube and through AMC's social media. The first three series consisted of ten episodes, while the last consisted of six.\nBoth Los Pollos Hermanos Employee Training and Ethics Training with Kim Wexler received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short Form Comedy or Drama Series. Madrigal Electromotive Security Training with Mike Ehrmantraut was initially nominated for the same award, while Jonathan Banks was initially nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Actor in a Short Form Comedy or Drama Series, but the academy had to pull the nominations after discovering the episodes were shorter than the category's required runtime. Filmmaker Training would also be nominated for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short Form Comedy, Drama or Variety Series.\n''Slippin' Jimmy (2022)\nSlippin' Jimmy}}\nVariety reported in March 2021 that AMC was developing a spin-off animated series, Slippin' Jimmy''.

Critic Alan Sepinwall remarked that the movie \"doesn't in any way work as a standalone entity.\" In order to achieve feature film length, notable side characters like Tuco Salamanca and the Salamanca Cousins were cut entirely, and the conclusion to the Gustavo Fring story occurred off-screen.\nFaking Bad (2019)\nFaking Bad (musical)}}\nFaking Bad is a 2019 parody musical with music, lyrics and book by Rob Gathercole based on AMC's Breaking Bad created by Vince Gilligan. The musical condenses the entire plot of Breaking Bad down to a one-act play that was under two hours with a heightened sense of camp and satire. A physical release of the cast recording was available for sale at the official Breaking Bad Store in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\nFuture\nNear the end of Better Call Saul broadcast run in August 2022, Vince Gilligan said that he does not plan to create any more works in the Breaking Bad franchise, as he cannot expect any further installments to be critically successful. He said \"I think I'm starting to sense you've got to know when to leave the party, you don't want to be the guy with a lampshade on your head.\" Peter Gould later acknowledged that by the premiere of Breaking Bads finale, he and Gilligan were already working on the spin-off, but when Better Call Sauls finale aired the two were working separately on new projects.\nDespite this, Giancarlo Esposito, who portrays Gus Fring, stated that \"Gustavo Fring isn't done,\" expressing interest in a \"show that would reflect Gustavo's past [and] to play the vision in my mind that inspired and informed the Gus you see but don't know. I would like you to know that Gus. It's intriguing to know where he came from,\" although admitting it would be up to Gilligan and his team and partners, with whom he had discussed the concept of such a series in the past. As of September 2022 Esposito has continued to express interest in the project, tentatively entitled \"The Rise of Gus\", describing it as a \"yearning inside\" him.\nGould would later say that he would consider other entries at some point in the future. He stated \"Vince [Gilligan] and I both decided it would be good to give the Gilliverse a little bit of a rest, but we had a big board with ideas or scenes we were interested in or would be fun — and there were a lot of them still on that board when we finished up the show. Maybe that's a good thing, though. You want to leave something you didn't get to.\"\nAaron Paul and Bob Odenkirk both expressed interest in returning to their characters Jesse Pinkman and Saul Goodman, respectively, but both mentioned that any revival required Gilligan and Gould's involvement. Gilligan mentioned the possibility of Jesse continuing his adventure in Haines, Alaska, where his character ended at the conclusion of El Camino, while Odenkirk said that Saul's story would have to take place in prison during his sentence following the events of Better Call Saul.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  – official site, Sony Pictures\n*\n*\n*  – official site, AMC\n*\n*"
