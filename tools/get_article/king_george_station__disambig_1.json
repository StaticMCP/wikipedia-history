The station is located in the south end of the Surrey City Centre district of Surrey, British Columbia, Canada, and is one of the outbound termini of the Expo Line, the other being Production Way–University station. The station is located on King George Boulevard at Holland Commons, just north of Fraser Highway.\nThe station is within walking distance to Holland Park and Surrey Memorial Hospital. A number of mixed-use developments continue to be built near the station, such as the King George Hub development, which displaced the park and ride facility that had once served the station.\nHistory\nKing George station was opened in 1994 as part of the second extension of the Expo Line into Surrey; the other stations included on this extension were Gateway and Surrey Central. The station is named for nearby King George Boulevard, which in turn is named after King George VI, who visited the municipality of Surrey in 1939.\nSince opening in 1994, it has served as an outbound terminus of the Expo Line. The tracks continue beyond the station for about a block before they terminate and are used to store extra cars and to allow outbound trains to switch tracks for their ensuing inbound runs; plans call for the line to be extended deeper into Surrey, following Fraser Highway.\nIn 2022, an Expo Line extension from King George station to 203 Street in Langley City was approved. Construction on the  extension was scheduled to begin in 2024 and be completed by 2029.\nBetween April 27 and June 9, 2024, King George station was temporarily closed to allow for replacement work on two switches and a section of third rail between King George and Surrey Central stations. During this time, various repairs and upgrades were completed on the station, including platform work to accommodate Alstom Mark V trainsets.\nStation information\nEntrances\n* East entrance: is accessible from Whalley Boulevard and includes a designated passenger drop-off area.
