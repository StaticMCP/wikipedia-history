Lynx helicopters of the British Royal Navy, using Sea Skua missiles, were responsible for destroying 14 vessels (3 minesweepers, 1 minelayer, 3 TNC 45 Fast Attack Craft, 2 Zhuk-class patrol boats, 2 Polnocny-class landing ships, 2 salvage vessels, 1 Type 43 minelayer, and 1 other vessel) during the battle. The battle saw 21 separate engagements over a course of 13 hours. A total of 21 of the 22 ships that attempted to escape were destroyed.\nA Canadian CF-18 Hornet fighter recorded an official victory at the beginning of the battle against the Iraqi Navy.\nAlso related to the Bubiyan action was the Battle of Khafji in which Saddam Hussein sent an amphibious assault to Khafji to reinforce the city against the Coalition attack. That too was spotted by the Coalition naval forces and subsequently destroyed.\nThe last action of the Iraqi Navy was to fire a Silkworm missile from an inland launcher at the battleship . It was intercepted mid-flight by a Sea Dart missile from the British destroyer  and successfully destroyed. That marked the first time that a ship-launched anti-air missile intercepted an incoming enemy missile in combat at sea.\nAfter the Bubiyan action, the Iraqi Navy ceased to exist as a fighting force at all, which left Iraq with very few ships, all in poor condition.\nReferences"
