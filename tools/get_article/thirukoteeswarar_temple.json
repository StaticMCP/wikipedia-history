The temple is dedicated to Shiva.\nHistory\nThe earliest inscriptions in the temple date from 750 AD and belong to the reign of the Pallava king Nandivarman. The present structure is believed to have been constructed by Sembiyan Mahadevi, the mother of Uttama Chola in 979. An inscription from the period of Gandaraditya I indicates a gift of 8 ma of land to the temple by Masenan Madan of Sirukattur to supply five pots of water everyday from the river Kaveri by the servants.\nSignificance\nPraises of the temple have been sung by the Saivite saints Appar and Sambandar. The temple was also visited by the saint Bhaskararaya of Bhaskararajapuram. The temple has separate shrines for Vinayaga, Muruga, Gajalakshmi, Saptha Kanniyar, Bhairavar, Surya, Chandra, Sani, Durvasa and Nataraja. The temple is counted as one of the temples built on the northern banks of River Kaveri.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\nGallery\nFile: Tirukodikka koteeswarar temple2.jpg|Front mandapa\nFile: Tirukodikka koteeswarar temple3.jpg|Dahskinamurti shrine\nFile: Tirukodikka koteeswarar temple4.jpg|Presiding deity vimana\nFile: Tirukodikka koteeswarar temple5.jpg|Amman shrine vimana\nFile: Tirukodikka kodiswarar temple6.jpg|Agastiswarar shrine\nFile: Tirukodikka koteeswarar temple7.jpg|Sculptures in temple gopura entrance\nFile: Tirukodikka kodiswarar temple10.jpg|Sculptures in temple gopura entrance"
