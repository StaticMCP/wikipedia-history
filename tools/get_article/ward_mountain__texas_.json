The mountain is composed of rhyolite (volcanic rock) and Chisos Formation which formed during the Oligocene period. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 2,500&nbsp;feet (762&nbsp;m) above Cottonwood Creek near Ward Spring in . Based on the Köppen climate classification, Ward Mountain is located in a hot arid climate zone with hot summers and mild winters. Any scant precipitation runoff from the mountain's slopes drains into Cottonwood Creek which is part of the Rio Grande watershed. The lower slopes of the mountain are covered by juniper, oak, and piñon. The mountain's toponym was officially adopted on March 9, 1939, by the United States Board on Geographic Names. The namesake was Johnny Ward, a cowboy from the nearby G4 ranch. The G4 ranch manager Captain Jim Gillette trusted nineteen-year-old Johnny Ward who was sent by rail to Chicago in the late 1880s to buy cattle for the G4 Cattle Company. The G4 was one of the first large ranches of Big Bend, stretching from Oak Spring and The Window to Terlingua Creek and Aguja Fria to the west.\nSee also\n*List of mountain peaks of Texas\n*Geography of Texas\nReferences\nGallery\nFile:Remnants of a Volcano.jpg|West aspect, summit to the left\nFile:Chisos Mountains - panoramio.jpg|West aspect centered, with Vernon Bailey Peak to left\nFile:Chisos Mountains under clouds.JPG|West aspect centered\nFile:South Rim BIBE.jpg|Ward Mountain to the right\nFile:Chisos Mountains - Vernon Bailey Peak.jpg|Chisos Mountains from northwest, road pointed toward Vernon Bailey Peak with Ward Mountain to the right\nExternal links\n* Ward Mountain: [https://www.yr.no/en/forecast/daily-table/2-5533112/United%20States/Texas/Brewster/Ward%20Mountain Weather forecast]"
