She had been on her way from Danzig to London when she became leaky and her cargo shifted. She would have to unload to effect repairs. On 18 December as she was on her way from Danzig and Gothenburg, Emperor Alexander grounded near the entrance to the harbour at Elsinor during a fog. She was gotten off and was expected to proceed.\nIn late 1825 or early 1826, Emperor Alexander, Armstrong, master rescued part of s crew and the members of s crew aboard Rosella. Rosella had been driven ashore and wrecked on Bornholm, Denmark. Prior to wrecking, Rosella had picked up the crew of Severn, which had become waterlogged. Emperor Alexander had great difficulty rescuing the crews, having to use ropes to haul them individually to shore over the rocks. She rescued eight members of Rosellas crew; the other 12 chose to remain on Bornholm to take care of the wreck and to await another vessel that might bring them home. Off Flamborough Head, Emperor Alexander encountered the brig Henry and William, of Aberdeen, Allan, master and transferred the rescued men to her. Henry and William delivered them to Aberdeen on 17 January 1826.\n{| class=\" wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Master\n! Owner\n! Trade\n!
