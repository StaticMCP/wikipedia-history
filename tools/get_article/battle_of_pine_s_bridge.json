Loyalist forces under the command of James De Lancey surprised an American defensive position guarding the Pine's Bridge crossing of the Croton River held by the Rhode Island Regiment (which had some African-American soldiers) along with detached soldiers of the Massachusetts Continental Line and the New Hampshire Continental Line on the north bank of the Croton River, killing and capturing many of the American soldiers.\nColonel Christopher Greene and Major Ebenezer Flagg of the Rhode Island Regiment were killed in the action, along with eight African American soldiers of the Rhode Island First Regiment. Greene and Flagg were buried at the 1st Presbyterian Church in nearby Yorktown where their graves are marked by a large monument.  Near the monument, a second stone marker and plaque known as the Monument to the First Rhode Island Regiment honors the memory of the eight African-American soldiers who died defending their commander.\nReferences"
