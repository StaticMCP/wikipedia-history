It was released on 26 March 2013 as the lead single from the band's fourth studio album Promises. The song was not a hit in the band's native United Kingdom but instead gained widespread popularity in the Netherlands, peaking at No. 27 on the Dutch Single Top 100 and No. 30 on the Dutch Top 40 and being voted in second place for the 2013 NPO 3FM Song of the Year award, behind Daft Punk's \"Get Lucky\".\n\"Diamonds\" remains popular with the Dutch people, being voted into Dutch national radio station NPO Radio 2's annual Top 2000 songs of all time countdown every year since its release. It reached a highest spot of No. 415 in 2022.\nReception\nThe song has been described as a \"serene synth-backed masterpiece\" with \"shoegaze-meets-Verve guitar soundscapes\".\nCommercial performance\nThe chart success of \"Diamonds\" in the Netherlands came as a surprise to The Boxer Rebellion. Vocalist Nathan Nicholson said, \"It’s a really good song and I felt good about it, but at first I didn’t even think it would be a single.\"\nOn 31 August 2013, \"Diamonds\" peaked at No. 30 on the Dutch Top 40. It was the second of the song's three weeks on the chart.\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n!Chart (2013)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!Chart (2013)\n!Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Dutch Top 40)\n| align=center|188\n|}\nReferences"
