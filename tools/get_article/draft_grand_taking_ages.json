      "text": "# Draft:Grand Taking Ages\n\nGrand Taking Ages is a parody management simulator that satirizes the very long wait and multiple delays for the upcoming title Grand Theft Auto 6. Originally titled Grand Taking Ages VI, it was removed from the PlayStation Store by Sony but was subsequently released July 2025 on Steam after key adjustments to its presentation and content.\nThe game parodies the game development process, featuring AI-generated art and voice acting and is set in a fictional video game studio.\nReferences\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/sony-pulled-gta-6-parody-game-grand-taking-ages-from-the-playstation-store-but-its-now-cleared-for-release-on-steam"
