During that time he was the top rated sport karate fighter in Canada.\nAfter potentially career ending back surgery in 1988, Howard made his return to competition in 1992 (at 34) and won a silver medal at the NBL (National Blackbelt League) World Championships in Sport Karate. He was undefeated entering the finals but had to bow out of the final 2 matches due to injury.\nMixed martial arts\nWith a final record of 1-3 in NHB(No Holds Barred) what would later become known as mixed martial arts, Howard went 1-2 in the UFC.\nPersonal life\nHarold is married with three children, a daughter and two sons.
