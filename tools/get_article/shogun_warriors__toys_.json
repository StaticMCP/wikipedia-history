      "text": "# Shogun Warriors (toys)\n\nShogun Warriors was a line of toys released by Mattel in North America from 1977 to 1980. The line consisted of several imported toys based on Japanese anime mecha.\nOverview\n.]]\nThe line was drawn from toys originally produced by Japanese company Popy, based on several anime and tokusatsu shows featuring giant robots. They were originally manufactured in three sizes:  plastic versions,  die-cast metal versions, and slightly taller but much more detailed 5-inch (127&nbsp;mm) die-cast versions. Many of the robot’s original names were altered, such as Getter Dragon (Dragun) and Great Mazinger (Great Mazinga). Several vehicles were also offered, as well as a set that could be put together to form the super robot Combattler V (here renamed Combattra). Later on in the line, Mattel introduced toys of Godzilla and Rodan.\nThe toys featured spring-loaded launcher weapons such as missiles, shuriken and battle axes. Some were able to launch their fists, while the later die-cast versions also had the ability to transform into different shapes. Raideen (here renamed Raydeen), for example, could become a birdlike spaceship. These \"convertible\" versions were in a sense the precursors to the Transformers line of toy robots. Toward the end of production, Mattel proposed the inclusion of plastic toy vehicles for the 3.5\" figures to ride in exclusively in the United States, but these toys were never released for purchase.\nSimilar to other toy lines during the 1970s, the Shogun Warriors toys came under pressure over safety concerns regarding their spring-loaded weapons. The concern was that children might launch the weapons and hit other children or pets in the eyes. There was also a risk that small children might choke on the small plastic missiles and other parts. Toy manufacturers then faced new regulations as a result of reported injuries received while playing with these toys. Consequently, many toy companies were forced to remodel existing toy lines with child-safe variations such as spring-loaded \"action\" missiles that would remain attached to the toy. Missiles were also reshaped to have a flat head instead of a pointed one. Because of this, as well as declining sales, the Shogun Warrior toy line was discontinued by 1980.\nTie-in media\nComic\nIn order to promote the toys, Mattel approached Marvel Comics to produce a comic tie-in for the range, having enjoyed a fruitful relationship with the company on Godzilla, King of the Monsters. Only three figures would be featured in the comic - Raydeen (originally from Brave Raideen); Dangard Ace (from Wakusei Robo Danguard Ace) and Combatra (from Chōdenji Robo Combattler V). Series artist Herb Trimpe would also produce some artwork used by Mattel on toy advertisements.\nCartoon\nDue to Shogun Warriors being based on characters drawn from a wide number of Japanese TV shows, there was no cartoon produced. However, several of the characters featured in the toy line featured in Jim Terry's Force Five series.\nToy line\nJumbo Machinders\nJumbo Machinders were  tall vinyl figures.\n}}\n*Godzilla\n*Goldorak\n*Mazinga\n*Raydeen\n*Rodan\n}}\nDie-Cast Action Figures\nfigures.\nTwo-In-Ones\nfigures that could be reconfigured between two modes.\nCollector's\nfigures.\nAction Vehicles\nVehicles with action features.\nU-Combine Combatra Vehicles\nFive vehicles that could be combined to form the super-robot Combattra.

The first two robots in this line were GoLion and Dairugger XV, both of which were adapted in the Western world as Voltron. Subsequent entries in the line would include characters not from anime mecha, such as Bender and a stormtrooper.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.toynami.com/shogunwarriors.html Toynami's official Shogun Warriors page]\n* [https://www.shogunwarriors.org/ Wildtoys Shogun Warriors Fan Page (English)]\n* [http://www.plaidstallions.com/mattel79/godzilla.html 1979 Mattel Catalog at Plaidstallions.com]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbZYIjVcYIQ Shogun Warrior vs. Godzilla commercial 1970s] at YouTube\nja:超合金 (玩具)"
