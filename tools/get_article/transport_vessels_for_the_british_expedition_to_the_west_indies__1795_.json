The expedition sailed on 6 October, 16 November, and 9 December, but weather forced the vessels to put back. The fleet finally successfully sailed on 20 March to invade St Lucia, with troops under Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph Abercromby. St Lucia surrendered to the British on 25 May. The British went on to capture Saint Vincent and to put down Fédon's rebellion in Grenada.\nAmong the transport vessels of the expedition were 16 chartered from the British East India Company (EIC).\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!
