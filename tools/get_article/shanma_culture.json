It succeeded the Siba culture (1,600–1,300 BCE) in the area, and preceded the Shajing culture (800–200 BCE), and the expansion of the Han dynasty (202 BCE–220 CE) in the region.\nThe area of the Shanma culture is broadly identical with that of the preceding Siba culture. It corresponds to the western area of the Hexi Corridor and Inner Mongolia, from Yangguan in the west to Yumen in the east, with the Shajing culture not far beyond to the southeast.\nThe Shanma culture is known to have used jade, from the Hanxia deposit, and later from the Mazongshan deposit, or from the Jingbaoer jade mine in the Mazong Mountain (Mazong Shan).\nThe Shanmas had agricultural activities and grew barley, wheat, and millets. But their livestock indicate a tendency towards nomadic pastoralism, as they had animals better suited for long-distance travel such as dogs, ovicaprids, horses, cattle, and camels, but they had no pigs.\nThe Shanma culture may have been associated with the Wusun tribes of Chinese history.\nFile:Distribution of reported nephrite deposits and the sites where jadewares were excavated in Northeast Asia.png|Distribution of reported nephrite deposits and the sites where jadewares were excavated in Northeast Asia\nFile:Shanma culture localities in the western Hexi Corridor.png|Shanma culture localities () in the western Hexi Corridor\nFile:Shanma ceramic vessel, Jingbaoer mine.jpg|Shanma ceramic vessel, Jingbaoer mine\nFile:Jingbaoer jade mine in the Mazong Mountains (Mazong Shan).jpg|Jingbaoer jade mine in the Mazong Mountain (Mazong Shan)\nFile:Jade ore from the Jingbaoer mine.jpg|Jade ore from the Jingbaoer mine\nReferences"
