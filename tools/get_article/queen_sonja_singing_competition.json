The competition was arranged for the first time in 1988. Participants are selected by a screening committee on the basis of recordings submitted in the application process. 40 singers are invited to the competition in Oslo. The competition programme includes preliminary rounds, a semi-final and final, as well as masterclasses, career development sessions, concerts and social events. The last competition was 15 - 22 August 2025. The next competition will be held in Oslo in 2027.\nHistory\nThe Queen Sonja Singing Competition was founded in 1988. Among the initiators was Mariss Jansons, former music director and principal conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra. At the time, the Norwegian classical music scene was experiencing a period of increased internationalization. The aim of the competition was to create an international arena for music in Norway, which could present young musicians, give Norwegian soloists an opportunity to be assessed at an international level, and attract greater international focus on the Norwegian classical music scene.\nThe competition was created as a joint project between several Norwegian music institutions, including the Norwegian National Opera and Ballet, the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra, the Norwegian Academy of Music, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK), the Lindeman Foundation and the Norwegian Society for Soloists.\nThe first two competitions in 1988 and 1992 were organized for pianists. Marking the centenary of the birth of Norwegian soprano Kirsten Flagstad in 1995, the competition has since then been arranged for singers. Until 2007, national competitions were arranged prior to the international competition.\nThe competition changed its name to the Queen Sonja Singing Competition in 2022, in conjunction with a new logo and visual profile.\nThe competition is currently arranged every two years in cooperation with the Norwegian National Opera and Ballet, the Norwegian Academy of Music, the Oslo National Academy of the Arts and the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation. The singers participating in the competition are usually newly graduated singers who are ready to embark on their international careers.\nHeld biannually in Oslo, the Competition draws on its global network of opera companies, conservatoires and professionals to bring together 40 young promising singers from around the world. The singers compete not only for its main prizes but to also receive coaching, masterclasses, career development sessions and international exposure.\nPrevious prize-winners include, among others, Argentinian soprano Virginia Tola (1999), Norwegian soprano Marita Kvarving Sølberg (2001), German tenor Daniel Behle (2005), Russian soprano Olga Mykytenko (2003), Canadian soprano Maesha Brueggergosman (2001), Norwegian baritone Audun Iversen (2007) and Norwegian soprano Lise Davidsen (2015).\nOrganisation\nThe Queen Sonja Singing Competition is organised as a non-profit foundation headed by the Board of Directors. A Council consisting of representatives from the founding institutions acts as a consultative body for the board. Current Board members are Bernt Bauge (Chair), Birger Magnus, Mary Miller, Randi Stene and Marie Louise Sunde.\nThe Council currently consists of Astrid Kvalbein (Dean, the Norwegian Academy of Music), Joachim Kwetzinsky (National Federation of Norwegian Musical Soloists), Arild Erikstad (NRK), Anna Einarsson (Dean, Oslo National Academy of the Arts), Geir Bergkastet (The Norwegian National Opera & Ballet), Ingrid Røynesdal (director, the National Museum), and Frederik Zimmer (The Lindeman Foundation).\nPrizes\n1st prize: €50 000\n2nd prize: €10 000\n3rd prize: €5 000\nFinalist prizes: €1 500\nPrize for the best performance of Lied: €1 500\nThe Ingrid Bjoner Scholarship (awarded to the best Norwegian competitor): NOK 100 000\nIn addition, prize-winners receive engagements with Norwegian orchestras and opera companies.\nContributors\nThe Queen Sonja Singing Competition’s main contributors are the Norwegian Ministry of Culture and the City of Oslo. The competition also receives private funding from Canica AS, Formue, Lucy Høegh Foundation, Sat Sapienti, Anders Sveaas’ Almennyttige Fond and Lindemans Legat.\nCollaborating Opera Academies\nThe Queen Sonja Singing Competition collaborates with opera academies in Europe and the US. The collaborating academies nominate up to two of their best singers to the competition. These singers are admitted directly to the preliminary rounds of the competition in Oslo and do not have to go through the regular application procedure.\nThe collaborating opera academies are:\nJette Parker Young Artists Programme, Royal Opera House, London\nLindemann Young Artist Development Program, Metropolitan Opera, New York\nThe Opera Studio, Bayerische Staatsoper, Munich\nInternationales Operastudio, Opernhaus Zürich, Zurich\nInternational Opera Studio, Staatsoper Unter den Linden, Berlin\nTeatro alla Scala Academy Young Artist Program, Teatro alla Scala, Milan\nJury\nThe jury of the Queen Sonja Singing Competition consists of leading figures in the opera world. The jury usually has seven members and includes both professional opera singers and opera directors from around the world.\nAfter the preliminary rounds each jury member votes for 12 contestants to proceed to the semi-final. After the semi-final the jury members vote for six candidates who proceed to the final. After the final each jury member ranks the finalists from 1 to 6. The finalist with the lowest number is the competition’s 1st prize winner. Each jury member submits his or her votes in writing, without revealing them to the other jury members. The jury’s verdict is final.\nJury 2023\n* Randi Stene, Norway, Director of Opera, Norwegian National Opera & Ballet, Oslo (chair)\n* Michael Heaston, USA, Assistant General Manager, Artistic, Metropolitan Opera, New York\n* Pål Christian Moe, Norway, Casting Adviser\n* Samuel Gelber, USA, Director of Artistic Planning, Washington National Opera, Washington D.C.\n* Stefan Herheim, Norway, Director of Opera, Theater an der Wien\n* Sophie de Lint, Switzerland/Netherlands, Director of Opera, Dutch National Opera, Amsterdam\nPrize Winners 2023\n.
