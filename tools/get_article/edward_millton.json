He was a member of the first New Zealand national rugby union team, which toured New South Wales in 1884. He played in seven of the eight matches on that tour, scoring one try. He did not play in any Test matches, as New Zealand did not play its first full international until 1903.\nMillton and his older brother, William, who captained the New Zealand team on the 1884 tour to New South Wales, have the distinction of being the first brothers to represent New Zealand in rugby.\nMillton married Maud Eliza Ford at St Peter's Church, Riccarton, on 22 March 1892. He died at Loburn on 11 March 1942. He bequeathed his sheep farm, Birch Hill Station, and another property at Okuku, to the Sunlight League of New Zealand for the establishment of the \"Ford Millton Memorial Home for Children\".\nReferences"
