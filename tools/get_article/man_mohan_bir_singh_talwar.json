During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, he held the rank of Wing Commander and led several bombing missions into Pakistani territory. Then, along with No. 16 Squadron IAF, he led his squadron's Canberras to Murid, Mianwali, Sargodha Chandhar, Masroor, Risalwala, Masroor, and Shorkot.\nLater life\nIn 1973 Talwar joined the Defence Services Staff College as Wing commander. In 1977 was appointed Group Captain at Gorakhpur airbase. He retired in 1979, following which he took to a garment business from his residence in Delhi.\nTalwar's witness statement in relation to anti-Sikh violence in Delhi in 1984, is detailed in Pav Singh's ''1984: India's Guilty Secret'' (2017). In it, he recounts how he was imprisoned for defending his family when mobs attacked them in November of that year.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
