Seven players have won the award more than once; Michael Jordan won the inaugural award and a total of four across his career. LeBron James has won the award a total of seven times, the most by any player. Stephen Curry has won the award three times, while Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O'Neal, and Hakeem Olajuwon have claimed two each. The award wasn't awarded in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWinners\nPlayer was a member of the winning team in the NBA Finals.   Player was a member of the losing team in the NBA Finals. * NBA Regular Season MVP† NBA Finals MVP\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Player\n! Nationality\n! Position\n!
