It received a Genie Award nomination for Best Feature Length Documentary at the 8th Genie Awards.\nIt is also his most successful film to date.\nSee also\n*Postmodernist film\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://philiphoffman.ca/filmography/ozoo-the-making-of-a-fiction-film/ Official website]\n*"
