As of the 2020 census, the population is 334,529. Since there are no incorporated municipalities, there is no incorporated county seat either. Therefore, its county seat is the unincorporated community of Ellicott City. Howard County is part of the Baltimore metropolitan area.\nThe county is home to Columbia, a planned community between Baltimore and Washington, D.C. with a population of approximately 100,000, founded in 1967.\nHoward County is frequently cited for its affluence, quality of life, and excellent schools. Its estimated 2020 median household income of $124,042 (~$}} in ) makes it one of the wealthiest counties in the US. Many of the most affluent communities in the area, such as Clarksville, Dayton, Glenelg, Glenwood, and West Friendship, are located along the Route 32 corridor in Howard County. The main population center of Columbia/Ellicott City is regularly ranked in Money magazine's Top 10 \"Best Places to Live\".  According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, Howard County ranks fourth in the nation for educational attainment, with an estimated 63.6% of residents 25 and over holding a bachelor's degree or higher. In 2022, the Howard County Public School System was ranked the best school district in Maryland.\nIn 2010, the center of population of Maryland was located in the Howard County town of Jessup.\nEtymology\n]]\nThe name of the county honors Colonel John Eager Howard, an officer in the \"Maryland Line\" of the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War, commander notably at the Battle of Cowpens in South Carolina in 1781, among others. He was the fifth governor of Maryland, serving from 1788 to 1791.\nHistory\nPrior to the European colonization of what is now Howard County in the 1600s, the area served as farming and hunting grounds for Indigenous peoples including the Piscataway and Susquehannock peoples. The Maryland Historical Trust has documented Indigenous sites along the Patapsco, Patuxent, Middle and Little Patuxent River valleys. In 1652, the Susquehannock tribes signed a peace treaty with Maryland, giving up their provenance over the territory that is now Howard County. In 1800, the mean center of U.S. population as calculated by the US Census Bureau was found in what is now Howard County.\nIn 1838, Dr. William Watkins of Richland Manor proposed the \"Howard District\" of Anne Arundel County. After several adjournments, the area of western Anne Arundel County was designated the Howard District in 1839. The district had the same status as a county except that it was not separately represented in the Maryland General Assembly. In 1841, the county built its first courthouse in Ellicott City. At the January 1851 constitutional convention, Thomas Beale Dorsey submitted a petition led by James Sykes. A committee was formed with Dorsey, Bowie, Smith, Harbine and Ricaud. After several postponements, the district was erected officially as Howard County on July 4, 1851, after the approval of the new constitution at the election held June 4, 1851.\nThe plantations of modern Howard County used slave labor as early as 1690. At the time of the Underground Railroad, some Howard County residents assisted slaves who were escaping to freedom. This was particularly risky, as many prominent plantation families were Confederate sympathizers during the Civil War, contributing militiamen to the South to protect local interests. Maryland was exempt from the Emancipation Proclamation, later abolishing slavery in the update of the Maryland Constitution in November 1864.\nOn May 1, 1883, Howard County joined Anne Arundel County and Harford County in liquor prohibition.\nBy 1899, Howard County contained  of dirt and  of stone roads, including three paid turnpikes maintained by 118 men. Most traffic consisted of loads delivered to rail crossings. In 1909, County Commissioners Hess, Werner and O'Neil were charged with malfeasance regarding contract bids.\nIn 1918, a deadly flu pandemic swept the county starting with an early outbreak in Camp Meade in adjacent Anne Arundel County. The 1930s saw a shift from one-room schoolhouses to centralized schools with bus service. By 1939 wheat harvesting fell to just . In 1940, local newspaper owner Paul Griffith Stromberg led a five-county commission to study a superhighway between Baltimore and Washington through Howard County. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 eventually led to the construction of Interstate 70 across northern Howard County and Interstate 95 across the eastern part of the county. The sparsely populated county hosted population centers in Ellicott City, Elkridge, Savage, North Laurel and Lisbon with W.R. Grace and Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab as the largest new employers. Residents elected officials that campaigned to keep the county rural while planners prepared public works to support a quarter million residents by the year 2000. Race relations and desegregation became major issues of the time.\nFrom 1963 to 1966 the Rouse Company bought  of land and rezoned it for the Columbia Development. In 1972, the Marriott company proposed to build a regional theme park on Rouse-owned land but was denied zoning.\nThe county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.\nGeography\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which  is land and  (1.0%) is water. It is the second-smallest county in Maryland by land area and smallest by total area.\n'' (Queen Anne's Lace) was designated as the official flower of Howard County in 1984.]]\nHoward County is located in the Piedmont Plateau region of Maryland, with rolling hills making up most of the landscape. It is bounded on the north and northeast by the Patapsco River, on the southwest by the Patuxent River, and on the southeast by a land border with Anne Arundel County. Both the Patapsco and Patuxent run largely through publicly accessible parkland along the county borders. The Patuxent border includes the Triadelphia and Rocky Gorge reservoirs.\nAdjacent counties\n* Anne Arundel County (southeast)\n* Baltimore County (northeast)\n* Carroll County (north)\n* Montgomery County (southwest)\n* Prince George's County (south)\n* Frederick County (west)\nClimate\nHoward County lies in the humid subtropical climate zone. As one travels west in the county away from the Baltimore area, the winter temperatures get lower and winter snow is more common. Annual rainfall is about  throughout the county. Over a 60-year period from 1950 to 2010, there were 394 National Climatic Data Center reportable events causing 617 injuries, and 99 fatalities. There were 9 reported tornadoes, reaching a maximum of F2, with no recorded fatalities.\nDemographics\nFor much of the 1800s and 1900s, Howard County was a predominantly white and mainly rural county with a small population. In 1950, the population was only 23,000. Since the 1950s, the county's population has increased tenfold and has diversified into a majority minority county. Almost half of Howard County's population identified as non-Hispanic and/or non-white by 2017. Much of the racial diversification of Howard County came after 1967, when The Rouse Company designed Columbia to be a planned community that included people from diverse socioeconomic and racial backgrounds. African-Americans have lived in Howard County for centuries, with the African-American population increasing greatly after the 1960s. Immigration from Asia, particularly Korea, India, and China, as well as Latin America, has also contributed to Howard County's diversity. While historically primarily Christian, Howard County now has sizable Jewish, Muslim, and Hindu populations. As of 2019, 18,700 Jewish people lived in the county, making up 5.8% of the total population. More than 6,000 non-Jewish people in the county have Jewish people in their households. As of 2010, only 1% of Jews in the county were Orthodox, while one-third each were Conservative and Reform and one-quarter were secular or non-denominational. In the same year, one-quarter of the Jewish community were poor or financially insecure, 17% made less than $50,000 per year, and half made annual incomes of $100,000 or more.\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census\n1790-1960 1900-19901990-2000 2010–2018 2010-2020\n}}\n2020 census\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Howard County, Maryland – Racial and ethnic composition\n!Race / Ethnicity (NH = Non-Hispanic)\n!Pop 2000\n!Pop 2010\n!\n!% 2000\n!% 2010\n!\n|-\n|White alone (NH)\n|180,010\n|169,972\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |155,236\n|72.63%\n|59.21%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |46.71%\n|-\n|Black or African American alone (NH)\n|35,353\n|49,150\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |64,018\n|14.26%\n|17.12%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |19.26%\n|-\n|Native American or Alaska Native alone (NH)\n|515\n|511\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |461\n|0.21%\n|0.18%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |0.14%\n|-\n|Asian alone (NH)\n|18,977\n|41,101\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |66,073\n|7.66%\n|14.32%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |19.88%\n|-\n|Pacific Islander alone (NH)\n|80\n|105\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |114\n|0.03%\n|0.04%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |0.03%\n|-\n|Other Race alone (NH)\n|656\n|746\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |2,213\n|0.26%\n|0.26%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |0.67%\n|-\n|Mixed Race or Multi-Racial (NH)\n|4,761\n|8,771\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |16,840\n|1.92%\n|3.06%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |5.07%\n|-\n|Hispanic or Latino (any race)\n|7,490\n|16,729\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |27,362\n|3.02%\n|5.83%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |8.23%\n|-\n|Total\n|247,842\n|287,085\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |332,317\n|100.00%\n|100.00%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |100.00%\n|}\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 328,200&nbsp;people by June 1, 2020 The population density was\n2010 census\nAs of the 2010 United States census, there were 287,085&nbsp;people, 104,749&nbsp;households, and 76,333&nbsp;families residing in the county.

Senator James Clark Jr. proposed a five-person County Council and a County Executive in 1965. In 1968, the county implemented a charter form of government. In 1984 a councilmanic referendum was approved, switching council from at-large representation to district representation. The County Council serves as the county's legislative branch; members also provide constituent service and sit as members of the Zoning Board and Liquor Board. The current Howard County Executive is Democrat Calvin Ball III, who was elected in November 2018 and took office on December 3, 2018.
