He was given the name \"Forward\" due to his involvement in many activities including his performances for guerrilla forces during the Rhodesian Bush War.\nEarly life\nHe was born in the rural Buhera area of Manicaland. As a young boy, Forward was interested in traditional dance and the recitation of ancient poetry. At the age of 10, he began to play ngoma (drums) and hosho (gourd rattles) for his mother's 'gombwe (rain-making) spirit'. At an early age, Forward borrowed a mbira and self-learned with the occasional radio programs.\nCareer\nIn 1984, Kwenda moved to Zimbabwe's capital city of Harare and began to play mbira with other musicians. Within a year, he had formed his own mbira group and was making records and performing on national radio, as well as performing constantly at mapira ceremonies. During this period, he claimed that he was informed by powerful rain-making spirits that he was to devote his life to playing mbira for their ceremonies. He was known for bringing the \"desired spirits\" to a ceremony by the end of the first ceremony song.\nIn 1985, Forward began playing in a style considered in Shona culture to be \"more ancient because spirits prefer it.\" This style was first recorded in 1985 and 1986 by his American friend Glenn Makuna, who dubbed Kwenda \"the Coltrane of mbira\". The makombwe, believed to be the ancestors of all mankind, supposedly prefer Kwenda's ancient style and come to earth as soon as he begins playing his mbira. Kwenda claims, \"It's not me, my spirits just play through me.\"\nAsked about his experience playing mbira, Forward responds:\nIn 1997, Kwenda toured the United States with Erica Azim, and recorded the Shanachie CD Svikiro: Meditations of an Mbira Master. In February 2000, Kwenda performed at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, with Erica Azim and toured North America with her during 2000, 2001 and 2002.\nIn 2019, Kwenda coauthored the book Learn to Play Mbira : Traditional Songs and Improvisation with the author [https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-fowler-07546721/ Andy Fowler]. On January 1, 2020, they launched the mbira master video and tablature archiving project [https://www.mbira.online mbira.online], within which Forward is the predominant tutor and performer. Forward and Andy now work together at [http://www.mbiramagic.com Mbira Magic] with the goal of promoting mbira music and creating employment for Zimbabwean musicians.\nSee also\n*Mbira\n*Shona music\n*Zimbabwe\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.mbiramagic.com Mbira Magic - Discover Mbira : Ancient Zimbabwean Trance Music]\n*[https://www.mbira.online Mbira.Online - Mbira Masters Video and Notation/Tablature Archive]\n*[http://www.mbira.org MBIRA - A non-profit in support of Shona music]"
