DBACW has brought it all together with a highly playable game which allows the player to determine which variables are most important. While I would recommend that the uninitiated start with Volume I or II of DBACW, the third volume is a must for anyone with a genuine interest in the war or who simply likes a tough challenge.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
