Sir Warin served the next monarch, King Richard I, as a Knight on the Third Crusade.

Whilst hunting with the King, the party was attacked by some forces of Saladin, he and some other knights helped save the life of the King.\nWarin married Alice de Courcy, daughter of William de Courcy. With this marriage he inherited Stogursey Castle near Bridgwater in Somerset, England. Alice's mother was Juliana, daughter of Richer D'Aquila, 2nd Baron of Pevensey Castle in Sussex. The male line of Aquila family ceased with the death of Gilbert the 4th Baron in 1231. The coat of Arms of three spreadeagles, bearings of Aquila, passed to Warin II, as husband of Alice. King John visited his Chamberlain at Stogursey in 1210.\nWarin also held the manor at Seaforth in Sussex. There had been a port at Seaforth since Roman times, more importantly it is near the River Ouse, which was used to carry goods right up to the county town of Lees.\nHe died in 1218.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.geni.com/people/Sir-Warin-FitzGerald-the-younger/6000000011549172878 Sir Warin FitzGerold] on geni.com"
