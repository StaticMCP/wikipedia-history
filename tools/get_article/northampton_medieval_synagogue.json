The synagogue appeared to have survived the expulsion of Jews in 1290 and the great fire of Northampton in 1674. Town Clerk records from 1751 described the building as \"very substantial; a fair stately hall.\"\nThe remains of the medieval synagogue include stone walls and a stone staircase located  below a kebab shop,  named the Kebabish takeaway, and a neighbourhood pub, named \"The Bear\". A wall in the cellar of the pub was part of the medieval synagogue.\nNorthampton was among the largest medieval Jewish communities in England. In 1992, remnants of a 12th-century Jewish cemetery were discovered by archaeologists.\nSee also\n}}\n* History of the Jews in England\n* List of former synagogues in the United Kingdom\n* Oldest synagogues in the United Kingdom\nReferences"
