Commanding the Union forces was Col. Abel Streight; Brig. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest led the Confederate forces.\nBackground\nThe goal of Streight's raid was to cut off the Western & Atlantic Railroad, which supplied General Braxton Bragg's Confederate army in Middle Tennessee. Starting in Nashville, Tennessee, Streight and his men first traveled to Eastport, Mississippi, and then eastward to Tuscumbia, Alabama. On April 26, 1863, Streight left Tuscumbia and marched southeastward. Streight's initial movements were screened by Union Brig. Gen. Grenville Dodge's troops.\nBattle\nOn April 30 at Day's Gap on Sand Mountain, Forrest caught up with Streight's expedition and attacked his rear guard. Streight's men managed to repulse this attack and as a result they continued their march to avoid any further delays and envelopments caused by the Confederate troops.\nAftermath\nThis battle set off a chain of skirmishes and engagements at Crooked Creek (April 30), Hog Mountain (April 30), Blountsville (May 1), Black Creek/Gadsden (May 2), and Blount's Plantation (May 2). Finally, on May 3, Forrest surrounded Streight's exhausted men 3&nbsp;mi east of Cedar Bluff, Alabama, and forced their surrender. They were sent to Libby Prison in Richmond, Virginia. Streight and some of his men escaped on February 9, 1864.\nThe battle also led indirectly to the death of Confederate Lieutenant A. Wills Gould, an artillery officer of questionable competence, who left guns behind to be spiked by Union forces.  Gould was furious with Forrest's decision to transfer him to another command and fought an impromptu duel with him on June 14, 1863, in which Gould was killed.\nUnion order of battle\nThese regiments participated in Streight's raid:\n* 80th Illinois Infantry\n* 51st Indiana Infantry\n* 73rd Indiana Infantry\n* 3rd Ohio Infantry\n* 1st Middle Tennessee Cavalry (two companies)\nPreservation\nAs of mid-2023, the American Battlefield Trust and its partners have saved 82 acres of the battlefield at Day's Gap. The Trust and its partners have also preserved 40 acres at the battlefield at nearby Hog Mountain, where fighting occurred on the same day.\nHistorian Fred Wise opened the Crooked Creek Civil War Museum on the land in which the skirmish at Crooked Creek took place. The museum houses numerous relics recovered from the property.\nSee also\n*Report of Col. Abel D.
