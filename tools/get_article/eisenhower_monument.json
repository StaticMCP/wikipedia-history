Eisenhower.\nThe subject\nAs a member of the famed West Point Class of 1915, (known as \"The Class the Stars Fell On\"), Eisenhower rose to prominence as an Army officer during World War II, where he was the Supreme Allied Commander Europe. After the war, he served as the Army's Chief of Staff before being elected President in 1952.\nDescription and commissioning\nThe statue stands nine feet tall and is perched upon a pedestal of red granite.\nThe bid for the monument originally included noted sculptors Donald De Lue, Felix De Weldon and Walker Hancock, but the commission went to class of 1953 West Point graduate Robert L. Dean Jr. After receiving the commission, Dean was offered one of the General's actual uniforms as a model by Eisenhower's son. Dean molded the wax model at his home in Pennsylvania and cast the bronze statue in Italy before the monument was unveiled on 3 May 1983.\nSee also\n* List of sculptures of presidents of the United States\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110130163251/http://ikestatues.com/ Robert L.
