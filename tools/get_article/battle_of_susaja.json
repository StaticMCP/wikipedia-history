They were well received by the local Albanian population, and some residents even joined their ranks. On January 19, another group of LAPMB insurgents from Gornja Šušaja, led by Bardhyl Osmani, conducted a raid on Yugoslav army positions near Crnotince. The following day, January 20, 2001, a sizable Yugoslav Army, comprising tanks, armored vehicles, and special forces, surrounded Gornja Šušaja, preparing to launch an attack on the LAPMB stronghold. On January 24, Yugoslav forces initiated an assault on the village from three directions. The battle persisted for four days until Yugoslav forces eventually were forced to withdraw.\nThroughout the battle, three LAPMB insurgents were wounded, whereas four Yugoslav soldiers were wounded, one of whom later died due to his injuries. The LAPMB claimed to have killed three Yugoslav soldiers during the engagement.\nReferences"
