Five nominees are presented and the individual with the most votes receives the award, which is presented in conjunction with the Final Four.  The award is named for Henry Iba, who coached at Oklahoma State from 1934 to 1970.  Iba won the NCAA College Championship in 1945 and 1946 and coached the U.S. Olympic Teams to two gold medals in 1964 and 1968. The award is presented at the Oscar Robertson Trophy Breakfast on the Friday before the Final Four.\nLegendary UCLA Bruins coach John Wooden has the most all–time selections with seven. Of the seven other coaches with multiple Henry Iba Awards, only Virginia Cavaliers coach Tony Bennett has received it more than twice. The school with the second–most winners is Ohio State, which has had two coaches win a total of three awards (Fred Taylor, Randy Ayers).\nBennett is also one of two coaches to receive the award at more than one program, having done so once at Washington State and twice at Virginia. The other is Kelvin Sampson, honored at Oklahoma and Houston.\nKey\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Coach (X)\n|Denotes the number of times the coach has been given the Henry Iba Award at that point\n|-\n|Team (X)\n|Denotes the number of times the team has been represented for the Henry Iba Award at that point\n|}\nWinners\nhas the most awards (7).]]\nhas won the award three times at two schools (twice at Virginia and once at Washington State).]]\nalso won the award at two different schools (Kansas and North Carolina).]]\nwon twice while at Indiana.]]\nwas the 2010 Henry Iba Award winner.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Season\n!Coach\n!School\n!Record\n!Postseason result\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1958–59\n|\n| Marquette\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1959–60\n|\n| California\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1960–61\n|\n| Ohio State\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1961–62\n|  (2)\n| Ohio State (2)\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1962–63\n|\n| Cincinnati\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1963–64\n|\n| UCLA\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1964–65\n|\n| Princeton\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1965–66\n|\n| Kentucky\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1966–67\n|  (2)\n| UCLA (2)\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1967–68\n|\n| Houston\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1968–69\n|  (3)\n| UCLA (3)\n| 29–1\n|NCAA Champions\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1969–70\n|  (4)\n| UCLA (4)\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1970–71\n|  (5)\n| UCLA (5)\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1971–72\n|  (6)\n| UCLA (6)\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1972–73\n|  (7)\n| UCLA (7)\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1973–74\n|\n| NC State\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1974–75\n|\n| Indiana\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1975–76\n|\n| Michigan\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1976–77\n|\n| Arkansas\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1977–78\n|\n| DePaul\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1978–79\n|\n| North Carolina\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1979–80\n|  (2)\n| DePaul (2)\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1980–81\n|\n| Oregon State\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1981–82\n|\n| Georgetown\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1982–83\n|\n| St. John's\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1983–84\n|\n| Purdue\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1984–85\n|  (2)\n| St. John's (2)\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1985–86\n|\n| Bradley\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1986–87\n|\n| Temple\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1987–88\n|  (2)\n| Temple (2)\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1988–89\n|  (2)\n| Indiana (2)\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1989–90\n|\n| Kansas\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1990–91\n|\n| Ohio State (3)\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1991–92\n|\n| Tulane\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1992–93\n|\n| Vanderbilt\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1993–94\n|\n| Saint Louis\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1994–95\n|\n| Oklahoma\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1995–96\n|  (2)\n| Purdue (2)\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1996–97\n|\n| Minnesota\n| '\n| '\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1997–98\n|\n| Michigan State\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1998–99\n|\n| Auburn\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1999–00\n|\n| Iowa State\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 2000–01\n|\n| Boston College\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 2001–02\n|\n| Pittsburgh\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 2002–03\n|\n| Kentucky (2)\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 2003–04\n|\n| Saint Joseph's\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 2004–05\n|\n| Illinois\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 2005–06\n|  (2)\n| North Carolina (2)\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 2006–07\n|\n| Washington State\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 2007–08\n|\n| Drake\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 2008–09\n|\n| Kansas (2)\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 2009–10\n|\n| Syracuse\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 2010–11\n|\n| Notre Dame\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 2011–12\n|\n| Missouri\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 2012–13\n|\n| Miami (FL)\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 2013–14\n|\n| Wichita State\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 2014–15\n|  (2)\n| Virginia\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 2015–16\n|\n| Xavier\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 2016–17\n|\n| Gonzaga\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 2017–18\n|  (3)\n| Virginia (2)\n|\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 2018–19\n|\n| Tennessee\n|\n|NCAA Sweet 16\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 2019–20\n|\n| Dayton\n|\n| Tournament canceled\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 2020–21\n|\n| Michigan\n|\n| NCAA Elite Eight\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 2021–22\n|\n| Arizona\n|\n| NCAA Sweet 16\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 2022–23\n|\n| Marquette (2)\n|\n| NCAA 2nd Round\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 2023–24\n|  (2)\n| Houston (2)\n|\n| NCAA Sweet 16\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 2024–25\n|\n| St. John's (3)\n|\n| NCAA 2nd Round\n|}\nFootnotes\n* Due to the massive numbers—and extreme severity of—NCAA violations that had surfaced, Clem Haskins and the Minnesota men's basketball season records and awards were nullified, giving them a 0–0 record and no official recognition for having gotten to the 1997 Final Four.\nReferences\n;General\n*\n;Specific\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090818163543/http://www.sportswriters.net/usbwa/awards/iba/index.html Henry Iba Award]"
