It replaced the Battle Dress Uniform and Desert Camouflage Uniform on 1 November 2011 after a four-year phase-in period.\nOn 14 May 2018, The U.S. Air Force announced that all airmen will transition from the Airman Battle Uniform to the OCP Uniform. All airmen have been permitted to wear the OCP Uniform since 1 October 2018, and the wear out date for the ABU was 1 April 2021. The ABU is currently worn by the Civil Air Patrol, but is being phased out in favor of the OCP Uniform.\nHistory\n2000s\n2003&ndash;2006: Prototypes and testing\nThe first prototype of the ABU was unveiled in the summer of 2003. The early uniform prototypes consisted of trousers, an embroidered undershirt, and a blouse. The prototype camouflage pattern was a blue/gray, tiger stripe pattern, based upon the tigerstripe uniforms worn by airmen during the Vietnam War.\nAfter months of wear testing, Air Force officials revised the color scheme and camouflage pattern due to feedback received from airmen. A new semi-pixelated tiger-stripe pattern, with added \"ragged pixel-like edges\", is introduced as a new \"test\" pattern.\nTiger Stripe Products claimed that a massive fabric printing company \"gave\" without \"knowledge or authorization\" an earlier version of this semi-pixelated pattern.\nThe new semi-pixelated tiger-stripe pattern would trade its dominant blue overtones for a more subdued palette, similar to the Universal Camouflage Pattern, but with some added slate blue tones. The uniform maintains a similar cut to the previous Battle Dress Uniform, rather than the contemporary Army Combat Uniform. The fabric was made in 50-50 nylon and cotton in order to reduce the need for summer/winter-type uniforms.\n2007: ABU Roll-out\nOn 2 October 2007, the Air Force began issuing the ABU to enlisted trainees in Basic Military Training at Lackland Air Force Base, was issued to the Class of 2012 at the United States Air Force Academy on 26 June 2008, and was made available for all airmen. Since September 2007, it had been issued to airmen deploying to locations in the CENTCOM area of responsibility.\n2008: Airman Battle Ensemble (ABE)\nAirmen in non-traditional ground combat roles began to be issued the Airman Battle Ensemble - a coat, pants and battle shirt in flame retardant materials in a tactical configuration. This was not a new uniform, but additional pieces for the ABUs that would help \"Airmen who perform their mission outside the wire in close coordination with ground forces.\"\n2009: Airman Battle Shirt (ABS) / Airman Battle System - Ground (ABS-G) introduced\nStarting in 2009, airmen who were in ground combat roles, such as Security Forces, were issued the new Airman Battle Shirt (ABS). The ABS was based on the Army Combat Shirt (ACS). Like the ACS, the ABS is a stand-alone shirt designed specifically for use with Improved Outer Tactical Vest armor in warm and hot weather. It is intended to greatly increase user comfort through the use of lightweight, moisture-wicking, and breathable fabrics. The ABS features the same tiger stripe pattern on the sleeves. The Airman Battle System - Ground was the successor to the ABE and was an upgrade with more pockets and having been tested by real airmen in battle conditions.\nThe rollout of the ABE and ABS-G uniform pieces was uneven and not without problems for airmen being deployed as the regulations were often confusing and varied from CONUS commands to deployment commands.\n2010s\n-weave, ABU-patterned fabric in the same 50/50 NYCO blend would be introduced in 2012, known variously as the \"Improved ABU,\" \"IABU,\" \"Ripstop ABU,\" or \"RABU.\"]]\nIn 2010, the Operation Enduring Freedom Pattern Army Combat Uniform was authorized to replace the Airman Battle Uniform for airmen in the War in Afghanistan.\nIn June 2011, The Air Force Times released the announcement of a summer weight ABU to be available in 2012. The Improved Airman Battle Uniform will be made of a 50–50 nylon-cotton blend and was composed of the same material used by the Army for the ACU. Just like the ABU, the IABU is machine washable and also wrinkle resistant. Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. Norton A. Schwartz gave approval of the IABU coat and pants which will be available to trainees at Basic Military Training first.\nThe ABU was fully phased in on 1 October 2011, completely replacing the BDU and DCU though most airmen had been wearing the ABU for several years by that point.\n2016: Civil Air Patrol adopts the ABU\nThe Air Force's civilian auxiliary, Civil Air Patrol, wear-tested the ABU in late 2015, and in May 2016, the national commander of the Civil Air Patrol issued a memorandum allowing the wear of the ABU effective 15 June 2016. However, the uniform is worn with dark blue background and light silver lettering name and branch tapes and black boots in order to distinguish CAP personnel. In 2025, a dark blue \"tactical cap\" style hat was made optional for wear, owing to a shortage of ABU pattern fabric.\n2018: Switch to Operational Camouflage Pattern\nAll airmen have been authorized to wear the Operational Camouflage Pattern instead of ABUs since 1 October 2018. Recruits in basic training and cadets in Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps, and Officer Training School started being issued OCPs on 1 October 2019. The Airman Battle Uniform was no longer authorized to wear after 1 April 2021.\n2019: Use by the United States Space Force\nmember wearing the Airman Battle Uniform with appropriate Space Force accoutrements during COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.]]From 2019 to 2021, the ABU was authorized for wear, alongside the Operational Camouflage Pattern (OCP) uniform, by United States Space Force (USSF) personnel. USSF personnel replaced the \"U.S. AIR FORCE\" nametape with a \"U.S. SPACE FORCE\" nametape, retaining the nametape’s ABU-pattern, \"midnight blue\" block lettering, and position over the left breast pocket. All other aspects of the uniform remained identical to USAF wear. While OCPs were authorized for wear from the 2019 establishment of the USSF, the USAF ABU wear-out date was not until 2021; as such, USSF personnel were permitted to wear the ABU until the official USAF wear-out date.\n2020s\n2022: Use by Ukraine\nA limited number of Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel have been photographed wearing the ABU during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n2025: Civil Air Patrol switches to OCP Uniform\nOn November 4th, 2025, the national commander of the Civil Air Patrol issued a interim change letter to the CAP uniform regulations to allow for wear of the OCP uniform. The ABU remains authorized for wear until October 31st, 2028.\nFeatures and attributes\nThe Airman Battle Uniform is similar to the Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP) in color, with the inclusion of slate blue, but is otherwise nearly identical to the BDU cut. The ABU was worn with sage green combat boots. The ABU does have essential NIR (near-infra red) qualities, and the sleeves are authorized to be rolled up.\nOverview of the Airman Battle Uniform was as follows:\n* Headwear\n** Patrol cap.\n** Boonie cover was available for the ABU for use in deployed locations.\n** Organizational ballcaps were authorized for RED HORSE and Combat Arms Training and Maintenance personnel.\n** Berets were authorized for Special Warfare, Security Forces, and Combat Aviation Advisers.\n** Sage-green or black watch cap for cold climate environments with outerwear.\n* Sand T-shirt\n* Blouse\n** All insignia, including occupational badges (aeronautical wings, occupational badges, etc.), were embroidered in midnight-blue thread with urban-gray background with the exception of rank insignia for 2nd Lieutenant and Major, which incorporated brown thread.\n** Name and service tapes were embroidered in midnight-blue thread on ABU patterned background tapes.\n** Chaplain, aeronautical, space, cyber, missile, occupational badges, duty shields, commander's badge, and weapons school patches were authorized.\n* Outerwear such as APECS parka and sage green fleece were authorized for the ABU\n* Sand rigger's belt\n* Trousers\n* Sage green combat boots\n** DLA green socks.\nBackpacks and other accessories must be sage, black, or ABU pattern.\nUsers\n* : Worn by Dominican Air Force.\n* : Worn by Egyptian Air Force and Egyptian Air Defense Forces\n* : In limited service\n* :\n**: Former standard camouflage uniform of US Airmen from 2007 to 2021.
