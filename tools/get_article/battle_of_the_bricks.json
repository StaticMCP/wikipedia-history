It is a college football rivalry between the Miami RedHawks of Miami University (1809) and the Ohio Bobcats of Ohio University (1804), the two oldest universities in the State of Ohio. Both schools are members of the Mid-American Conference. Through the 2025 season, the two teams have met 102 times on the football field, with Miami holding a 56–44–2 edge in the all-time series. Ohio University players and staff receive a mug with game information for each rivalry win over Miami.  The title \"Battle of the Bricks\" originally referred to football games, but has since been used broadly to cover any contest between the two complementary universities.\nGame results\n| team2 =
