The vice president is the first person in the presidential line of succession, ascending to the presidency upon the death, resignation, or removal of the president. There have been thirty-nine vice presidents of the Dominican Republic. Under the Constitution of the Dominican Republic, the vice president shall be elected along with the president.\nSince the independence of the Dominican Republic in 1844 until 1865, what is considered the First Republic, there were no constitutional vice presidents. Yet, during that time there were acting vice presidents; this was under the rule of Pedro Santana.\nHistory\nAfter the inception of the Dominican Republic, the country was run by a Central Governing Junta led by Pedro Santana. As such, there was no need for a vice president at the time. Yet, it is believed that the first vice president of the republic was Felipe Benicio Alfau Bustamante, who was elected as acting vice president by Pedro Santana. This was spurred because Santana was invited to go abroad yet the republic had to be seen to in his absence.\nThe Constitution of the Dominican Republic has been amended many times, and in some instances the office of the vice president had been eliminated to later be recreated. In times when the office was eliminated, if the president was leaving the country, an acting president was designated, therefore creating the post of a second in command. For example the 30th president of the Dominican Republic, Carlos Felipe Morales, elected Ramón Cáceres to be his vice president from 1903 until 1905. Then from 1905 to 1911, the previous vice president, Ramón Cáceres is elected as president and the office of the vice president is eliminated during that time span.\nAlso during the 31 year dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo, the office of the vice president was eliminated or vacated on several occasions.\nSince 1966, which is considered the beginning of the 4th Republic, the office of the vice president of the Dominican Republic has been a permanent post. Also, the vice president has to be elected along with the president, not appointed by the latter.\nList of vice presidents of the Dominican Republic, 1844&ndash;1861\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Picture\n!Name\n!Began office\n!Left office\n!President\n|-\n|\n|Felipe Benicio Alfau Bustamante\n|1853\n|1853\n|rowspan=2|Pedro Santana\n|-\n|\n|Manuel de Regla Mota\n|15 February 1854\n|26 May 1856\n|-\n|\n|Antonio Abad Alfau Bustamante\n|1856\n|1856\n|Manuel de Regla Mota\n|-\n|\n|Buenaventura Báez\n|6 October 1856\n|8 October 1856\n|Manuel de Regla Mota\n|-\n|\n|Domingo Daniel Pichardo Pró\n|1857\n|1858\n|Buenaventura Báez\n|-\n|\n|Benigno Filomeno de Rojas\n|1858\n|1861\n|Pedro Santana\n|-\n|}\nAnnexation by Spain 1861&ndash;1865 and Dominican Restoration War 1863&ndash;1865\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Picture\n!Name\n!Began office\n!Left office\n!President\n|-\n|\n|Matías Ramón Mella\n|1863\n|1864\n|José Antonio Salcedo\n|-\n|\n|Ulises Francisco Espaillat\n|1864\n|1864\n|José Antonio Salcedo\n|-\n|}\nList of vice presidents of the Dominican Republic, 1865&ndash;1924\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Picture\n!Name\n!Began office\n!Left office\n!President\n|-\n|\n|Gregorio Luperón\n|24 January 1865\n|24 March 1865\n|Benigno Filomeno de Rojas\n|-\n|\n|Benigno Filomeno de Rojas\n|24 March 1865\n|4 August 1865\n|Pedro Antonio Pimentel\n|-\n|\n|Francisco Antonio Gómez y Báez\n|1865\n|1866\n|Buenaventura Báez\n|-\n|\n|Manuel Altagracia Cáceres\n|1868\n|1871\n|Buenaventura Báez\n|-\n|\n|Juan Isidro Ortea y Kennedy\n|1871\n|1874\n|Buenaventura Báez\n|-\n|\n|Francisco Gregorio Billini\n|5 March 1878\n|8 July 1878\n|Cesareo Guillermo\n|-\n|\n|Casimiro Nemesio de Moya\n|1882\n|1884\n|Ulises Heureaux\n|-\n|\n|Alejandro Woss y Gil\n|1884\n|1885\n|Francisco Gregorio Billini\n|-\n|\n|Segundo Francisco Imbert del Monte\n|1887\n|1889\n|Ulises Heureaux\n|-\n|\n|Manuel María Gautier\n|1889\n|1893\n|Ulises Heureaux\n|-\n|\n|Wenceslao Figuereo\n|1893\n|26 July 1899\n|Ulises Heureaux\n|-\n|\n|Horacio Vásquez\n|15 November 1899\n|2 May 1902\n|Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra\n|-\n|\n|Eugenio Deschamps Peña\n|March 1903\n|November 1903\n|Alejandro Woss y Gil\n|-\n|\n|Ramón Cáceres\n|24 November 1903\n|29 December 1905\n|Carlos Felipe Morales\n|-\n|colspan=6 align=center|Abolished (29 December 1905 &ndash;
