Wu and his band mates posted information, updates, personal thoughts (including slamming Hong Kong Disneyland, for which they were spokespersons) and the band's music, at their official website. In 2006, Wu made his writing and directorial debut with The Heavenly Kings, which chronicles Alive's formation and exploits. After the film's release, however, it was revealed that The Heavenly Kings was actually a mockumentary of the Hong Kong pop music industry and Alive was constructed purely as a vehicle to make the movie; the film's characters represented only 10-15% of their real-life counterparts and much of the footage blurred the line between fiction and reality. Wu admitted his own singing voice \"sucked really bad,\" and the band had their voices digitally enhanced for its music, to prove that \"it's easy to fake it.\"\nCast and roles\n* Conroy Chan Chi-Chung - Himself\n* Jackie Chan - Cameo (uncredited)\n* Jaycee Chan - Cameo\n* Jacky Cheung - Cameo\n* Stephen Fung - Cameo\n* Josie Ho - Cameo (uncredited)\n* Tony Ho\n* Ella Koon - Cameo (uncredited)\n* Jo Kuk - Kei Kei (as Jo Koo)\n* Andrew Lin - Himself\n* Candy Lo - Cameo\n* Karen Mok - Cameo\n* Jason Tobin - Sandy\n* Nicholas Tse - Cameo\n* Paul Wong - Cameo\n* Daniel Wu - Himself\n* Miriam Yeung - Cameo\n* Terence Yin - Himself\nReception\nDespite some backlash from the media over being intentionally fed false information in the movie about illegal downloads of the band's music, Wu won the best new director award for the film at the 26th Hong Kong Film Awards, an achievement he called \"a group effort.\" The film has also been nominated for Best Original Film Song at the same Awards ceremony: Composer: Davy Chan; Lyricist: Li Jin Yi and Singer: Alive.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.hkcinemagic.com/en/movie.asp?id=8762 The Heavenly Kings] at HK Cinemagic\n* [http://www.sanfranciscochinatown.com/events/movies/heavenlykings.html Review at sanfranciscochinatown.com]\n* [http://www.lovehkfilm.com/reviews_2/heavenly_kings.htm loveHKfilm entry]\n* Interview with Terence Yin: [http://www.hkcinemagic.com/en/page.asp?aid=300&page=4 \"Heavenly Kings: Revealing the Entertainment Industry\"]. 28 December 2008."
