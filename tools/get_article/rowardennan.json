It is mainly known as the starting point for the main path up Ben Lomond.\nRowardennan is at the northern end of the public road, but the West Highland Way, a long-distance footpath between Glasgow and Fort William, passes through the area and continues north along the side of the loch. Rowardennan has a hotel, hostel, chalet accommodation, caravan site, and camping for hikers on the West Highland Way. A small passenger ferry crosses the loch to Tarbet on the opposite shore.\nDuring the summer months, Rowardennan can be reached by ferry from Tarbet, Luss, or Inverbeg, on the opposite shore of the Loch Lomond.\nIt appears as \"Dennan's Row\" in Walter Scott's poem The Lady of the Lake.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.loch-lomond.net/theloch/rowerdennan.aspx Loch Lomond - Rowardennan]"
