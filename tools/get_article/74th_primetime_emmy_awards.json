The main ceremony was shown on NBC as part of a four-year rotation; the ceremony was moved to a Monday to accommodate NBC's Sunday Night Football coverage. The broadcast was also streamed on Peacock. The ceremony was produced by Hudlin Entertainment and Done and Dusted, with Reginald Hudlin, Ian Stewart, Byron Phillips and Jane Mun serving as executive producers. This marked Hudlin's third year and Done and Dusted's fifth year producing the Emmys ceremony. Hamish Hamilton served as director for the fifth time. The ceremony returned to the Microsoft Theater in Downtown Los Angeles, California, after two years at other venues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Television Academy president Maury McIntyre, while an outdoor option similar to the previous year was considered, they wanted to return with an audience and to continue their relationship with the Microsoft Theater.\nOn August 9, 2022, it was announced that Kenan Thompson would host the ceremony. The producers reportedly approached Chris Rock and Dwayne Johnson to host the ceremony, but had no success. NBC late-night hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers – both past Emmys hosts – were also reportedly uninterested in the role. Scherma initially indicated that a hostless ceremony was being considered, but the Television Academy quickly clarified that such an option was not being pursued. Following the announcement, Thompson called the opportunity \"ridiculously exciting\", even with the relatively short window before the ceremony, adding that he \"just want[ed] to celebrate creative people in this business\". Alongside Thompson, Zedd and comedian Sam Jay served as the ceremony DJ and announcer, respectively.\nBuilding from the previous year, the ceremony replaced stadium seating for the nominees and their plus-ones with tables. Stewart commented that the format had been well-received before and said, \"We've taken that concept and expanded it out.\" Screens were placed around the tables to create immersion into \"different worlds\". Other audience members remained in traditional theater seating. In accordance with guild rules, production members, nominees, and guests had to show a negative COVID-19 test before attending. Masking was required for the crew but optional for audience members; most attendees did not wear masks. Regarding changes after the Chris Rock–Will Smith slapping incident at the previous Academy Awards, Scherma expressed confidence in the event's security and staff, while Stewart emphasized the goal of making the event feel inclusive. The ceremony also sought to \"celebrate all of TV\", in Hudlin's words, by recognizing shows that were not nominated; one way this was done was by inviting actors from those programs as presenters.\nEmmys realignment\nIn December 2021, ATAS and the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS) announced a major realignment of the Emmy Award ceremonies. This was in response to the growth of streaming television, which blurred the lines in determining which shows should fall under the Daytime or Primetime Emmys. The two ceremonies' scopes were changed to revolve around factors such as the genres, production, and frequency of such programming, rather than strictly dayparts.\nAmong the major changes that took effect at the 49th Daytime Emmy Awards in June 2022 and at the 74th Primetime Emmy Awards in September 2022:\n* Daytime dramas, as defined as \"any multi-camera, weekday daily serial, spin-off or reboot\", remained at the Daytime Emmys, but most other scripted dramas and comedies had to enter into the Primetime Emmys. For example, the streaming limited series Days of Our Lives: Beyond Salem could still enter into the Daytime Emmys because it is a spin-off of the daytime soap opera Days of Our Lives, but other programs such as The Bay had to move to the Primetime Emmys.\n* Talk shows were divided between the Daytime and Primetime Emmys based on \"format and style characteristics reflective of current programming in the daytime or late night space\". Such programs could petition to switch ceremonies, such as the previous Daytime Emmy winner The Ellen DeGeneres Show, whose format is more similar to the late night talk shows awarded at the Primetime Emmys.\n* All children's programming categories were moved to the new Children's and Family Emmy Awards.\n* Categories for morning shows were moved from the Daytime Emmys to the News and Documentary Emmy Awards or to the Daytime Emmys' talk show categories, depending on format.\nCategories for game shows and instructional programming remained split this year between the Daytime and Primetime Emmys, with their realignment to be determined in 2023.\nOther rule changes\nSeveral other rule changes were implemented for the ceremony. Most notably, programs were no longer categorized as dramas or comedies based on runtime; instead, producers determined where their programs were submitted, with the Television Academy reserving the right to review decisions. The distinction had previously been adjusted in 2015 to consider half-hour programs as comedies and hour-long programs as dramas. The exception to the new rule was that programs under 20 minutes had to be submitted in short-form categories. The Television Academy also revised the description for the Governors Award and clarified that limited series must fully resolve story arcs with \"no on-going storyline and/or main characters in subsequent seasons\".\nIn July, the categories for the broadcast were revealed. Outstanding Variety Special (Live) and Outstanding Variety Special (Pre-Recorded) were moved to the Creative Arts ceremonies, while Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special replaced Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series in the main broadcast.\nCritical reviews and viewership\nThe broadcast generally received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Alan Sepinwall and Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone each praised the speeches from the winners, particularly Ralph's, while criticizing many of the production elements such as the In Memoriam segment and the frequent play-off music. The Hollywood Reporters Daniel Fienberg criticized other production decisions, such as the opening number, the dedicated DJ and announcer, and the various montages. He ultimately found the broadcast forgettable, quipping in reference to the Academy Awards six months prior: \"But hey, at least it wasn't a catastrophe?\" Mike Hale, writing for The New York Times, found the scripted portions weak and remarked that there \"seemed to be a consensus, organized or not, to keep it light\".\nThe Boston Globes Yvonne Abraham complimented Thompson as \"a likeable host\" and praised several of the speeches and presenters, but she ultimately found the ceremony to be \"just another TV awards show... long and stuffed with unnecessary montages and comedy bits\". Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times also complimented Thompson despite being \"saddled to some dumb bits\". However, he criticized the show's pace, calling it fast and \"somewhat exhausting\", and compared the atmosphere to \"watching [a party] through a window\". Conversely, Manuel Betancourt was more positive in his review for The A.V. Club, remarking that the program \"offered plenty of laughs\" and that it \"served as a reminder that the boob tube still has the power to inspire wide-eyed girls and boys alike\".\nCompeting with the season premiere of Monday Night Football on ABC and ESPN, the ceremony was viewed by 5.92&nbsp;million people in the United States, making it the least-viewed in Emmys history, representing a 19% decrease over the previous year's ceremony. It also achieved a 1.09 rating among adults ages 18–49. The ratings figures only include those who watched the telecast on NBC, and not those who streamed it on Peacock.\nIn Memoriam\nThe annual In Memoriam segment was presented by Anthony Anderson and featured John Legend debuting his song \"Pieces\".\n* Betty White – performer\n* David Warner – performer\n* Emilio Delgado – performer\n* Peter Scolari – performer\n* Yoko Shimada – performer\n* Burt Metcalfe – director, writer, producer\n* Jay Sandrich – director\n* George Yanok – writer\n* John Bowman – writer\n* Jak Knight – performer, writer\n* Dwayne Hickman – performer\n* Tony Dow – performer\n* Roger E.
