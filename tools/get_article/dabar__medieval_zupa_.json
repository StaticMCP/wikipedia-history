      "text": "# Dabar (medieval župa)\n\nDabar () was a medieval župa, part of the principality of Zachlumia, and later Hum zemlja. It was first mentioned in the 10th century, in the De Administrando Imperio, as one of five inhabited cities of Zachlumia. It was called Dobriskik. Dabar was situated around the Dabar field (Dabarsko polje), and bordered Dubrava to the west, Nevesinje to the north, Fatnica to the east and Popovo to the south-west. The word dabar in Serbo-Croatian means \"beaver\", thus, the etymology has been connected to beavers.\nThere was another region with the same name in the Lim River Valley that had been a part of the Serbian Kingdom until 1373 when Bosnian Ban Tvrtko I adjoined it to his realm.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*"
