The bridge connects the community of Queensborough, which is part of New Westminster on Lulu Island, to the rest of New Westminster on the Burrard Peninsula. It was originally a road and rail bridge, but the road part of the bridge was shut down after the opening of the four-lane Queensborough Bridge in 1960.\nIn the early morning of June 28, 2011, the bridge was damaged when it was hit by a gravel barge owned by Lafarge Canada that was being tugged downstream. The bridge reopened for rail traffic on July 30, although boat traffic took longer to be restored.\nSee also\n* List of bridges in Canada\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/marine/2011/m11w0091/m11w0091.html Marine investigation report M11W0091] — from the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB)\n* [https://professionalmariner.com/tsb-fatigue-inexperience-led-to-barge-collision-with-b-c-rail-bridge/ TSB: Fatigue, inexperience led to barge collision with B.C. rail bridge] — a news article from Professional Mariner magazine"
