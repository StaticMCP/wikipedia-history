This craft is practiced in several districts of Rajasthan and is notable for its regional variations, including the narrative plaques of Molela and votive figurines from Pokhran and Bikaner.\nHistorical Background\nThe origins of terracotta art in Rajasthan can be traced to the Indus Valley Civilization, with archaeological findings at sites such as Kalibangan and Bagor indicating early use of fired clay for domestic and ceremonial purposes. Over centuries, these practices evolved into distinctive local styles, influenced by community beliefs and agrarian customs.\nTechniques and Materials\nArtisans typically use locally sourced clay, mixed with organic materials such as rice husk or horse dung to improve texture and strength. Items are hand-molded or shaped using simple tools, sun-dried, and then fired in open kilns. Coloration varies based on the oxygen levels during firing, resulting in red or black finishes. Decorative details are often added with mineral-based pigments. In Molela, artisans produce relief plaques that are unique to the region and typically depict religious narratives.\nCultural and Religious Significance\nTerracotta objects serve religious, symbolic, and social purposes. Figurines of horses, elephants, and local deities are used as votive offerings in rural shrines and under sacred trees. These practices are especially prominent among tribal communities such as the Bhil, Meena, and Garasia, who maintain these traditions through annual rituals and seasonal ceremonies. Molela plaques often depict deities like Devnarayan and Nagdevta and are installed in rural temples.\nMajor Craft Centers and Their Significance\nMolela (Rajsamand District): Recognized for its distinctive flat narrative plaques, Molela's terracotta work stands out for religious storytelling through clay. Artisans use locally relevant iconography and themes tailored to tribal patrons. The region has been awarded a Geographical Indication (GI) tag for its unique style.\nPokhran (Jaisalmer District): Known for its robust red clay figurines, particularly votive horses and camels offered at shrines. The forms are stylized and symbolic, often reflecting the arid desert environment and local deities.\nBikaner: Specializes in painted terracotta tiles and ceremonial vessels. The use of surface decoration and fine detailing distinguishes this center. Bikaner also incorporates Islamic and Rajasthani design motifs in its pieces.\nUdaipur Region: Produces temple décor and mural-style installations using molded terracotta tiles and panels. These are used in religious settings and community buildings to depict scenes from epics and local folklore.\nRecognition and Preservation\nArtisans such as Mohan Lal Kumhar and Dinesh Chandra Kumhar from Molela have been honored with national awards for preserving and innovating within the tradition. Molela terracotta was granted GI status in 2016–17, recognizing its regional and cultural uniqueness. Initiatives such as the One District One Product (ODOP) scheme and support from institutions like the Indian Institute of Craft and Design (IICD) aim to provide design innovation, documentation, and market access for artisans.\nReferences"
