They are regarded as the primary document of military law and regulations in Canada – aside from the National Defence Act.\nThe titling of these regulations currently remains unchanged after the death of Queen Elizabeth II.\nAuthority\nThe QR&O are issued under the authority of Section 12 of the National Defence Act (NDA), the governing statute of the Canadian Forces. Section 12 provides the Governor in Council (i.e., the Governor General acting on the advice of Cabinet) and the Minister of National Defence with the power to make regulations for the \"organization, training, discipline, efficiency, administration, and government of the Forces\", so long as such regulations are not inconsistent with the NDA, common-law principles of natural justice, the Canadian Bill of Rights or the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms; it also permits the Treasury Board to make regulations concerning pay, allowances, forfeitures, deductions, etc.\nQR&O 1.23 further authorizes the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) to issue orders'' and instructions \"not inconsistent with the National Defence Act or with any regulations made by the Governor in Council, the Treasury Board or the Minister\" in the discharge of his duties or in implementation/explanation of regulations.\nEach regulation or order within the QR&O is, as noted above, issued under the authority of the Governor in Council, the Minister, Treasury Board, or CDS; the issuing authority is indicated by a letter in parentheses following each regulation or order, namely (G), (M), (T), and (C), respectively.\nVolumes\nThe QR&O is divided into four volumes, containing the indicated chapters:\n*Volume I – Administrative (Chapters 1 through 100)\n*Volume II – Disciplinary (Chapters 101 through 200)\n*Volume III – Financial (Chapters 201 through 300)\n*Volume IV – Appendices\nVolume I – Administrative\nVolume I contains the most wide-ranging subject matter.
