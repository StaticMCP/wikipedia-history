In 1956 residents delivered two petitions advocating for the building to local authorities and permission was granted. In 1957 they placed a wooden cross near Plac Teatralny (Theater Square) to mark the location of the future church.  In October 1959 authorities withdrew the building permission and the land was taken back. This led to community protest by the residents of Nowa Huta and  on April 27, 1960  when authorities came to remove the wooden cross the  broke out that were met with violence from the militia.\nIn 1965 a new location was finally secured which is credited to the intervention of then metropolitan bishop, Karol Wojtyła. Designed by architect Wojciech Pietrzyk in 1965 and construction began on the new building in 1967. Due to political restrictions construction was primarily carried out by volunteers, with no assistance from the government over 9 years. On May 18, 1969, the Archbishop of Kraków, Cardinal Karol Wojtyła, laid the cornerstone from St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican and consecrated by Pope Paul VI. On May 15, 1977, Cardinal Karol Wojtyła consecrated the church, giving it the name of Our Lady Queen of Poland.\nDuring the 1980s martial law, period, the church became a focal point for anti-communist resistance. Monthly masses held there often turned into protests, and the site saw events like the death of , a young protester shot by security forces in 1982. In 1992 a monument was erected on the site commemorating his death.\nChurch\nThe exterior, with its large sloping roof and  mast in the shape of a crowned cross, was a reference to Noah's Ark. In architectural terms, the church is a good example of the late modernist style in Poland, and is considered a reference to the Notre-Dame du Haut chapel in Ronchamp, France designed by Le Corbusier a decade earlier.\nThe church is laid out over 3 levels. The main nave dominated by the  tall crucifix created by Bronisław Chromy.\nChurch of Our Lady Queen of Poland, view from N, 1 Obrońców Krzyża Street, Nowa Huta, Kraków, Poland.jpg|The Ark of the Lord.Roof-ark, cross-mast of a boat.View from the north.\nChurch of Our Lady Queen of Poland, interior, 1 Obrońców Krzyża Street, Nowa Huta, Kraków, Poland.jpg|View of the interior with Bronisław Chromy's crucifix on the left.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Official website in Polish [https://arkapana.pl/index.php/kosciol/dla-pielgrzymow/folder-en.html https://arkapana.pl]"
