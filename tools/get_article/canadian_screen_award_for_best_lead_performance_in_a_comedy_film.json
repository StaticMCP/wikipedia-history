The organization subsequently decided to increase the number of acting awards again, with the new awards separated by genre of film instead of performer gender; beginning with the 12th Canadian Screen Awards in 2024, distinct awards will now be presented for Best Lead Performance in a Comedy Film and Best Lead Performance in a Drama Film.\n2020s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#bebebe;\"\n! style=\"width:8%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:19%;\"| Actor\n! style=\"width:19%;\"| Film\n! style=\"width:2%;\"| Ref\n|-\n| rowspan=\"9\" align=\"center\"| 2023  12th Canadian Screen Awards\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Jay Baruchel\n| BlackBerry\n|\n|-\n| Félix-Antoine Bénard\n| Humanist Vampire Seeking Consenting Suicidal Person (Vampire humaniste cherche suicidaire consentant)\n| rowspan=7|\n|-\n| Alexandra Billings\n| Queen Tut\n|-\n| Susan Kent\n| ''Who's Yer Father?\n|-\n| Magalie Lépine-Blondeau\n| The Nature of Love (Simple comme Sylvain)\n|-\n| Cody Lightning\n| Hey, Viktor!\n|-\n| Chris Locke\n| Who's Yer Father?\n|-\n| Sara Montpetit\n| Humanist Vampire Seeking Consenting Suicidal Person (Vampire humaniste cherche suicidaire consentant)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"9\" align=\"center\"| 2024  13th Canadian Screen Awards\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Cate Blanchett\n| Rumours\n|\n|-\n| Rojina Esmaeili\n| Universal Language (Une langue universelle)''\n| rowspan=7|\n|-\n| Kaniehtiio Horn\n| Seeds\n|-\n| Emily Lê\n| Paying for It\n|-\n| Pirouz Nemati\n| Universal Language (Une langue universelle)\n|-\n| Taylor Olson\n| Look at Me\n|-\n| Paul Spence\n| ''Deaner '89\n|-\n| Maïla Valentir\n| Ababooned (Ababouiné)''\n|}\nReferences"
