The Chen family has maintained a dedicated presence in Taiwan's opera industry for over four generations. Following the passing of its founding leader, Chen Ming-chi, in 1997, the second-generation director, Chen Sheng-Fu, undertook a comprehensive restructuring of the organization.\nHistory\nChen Ming-chi, the founder of Ming Hwa Yuan, was born in ,   in Japanese Formosa (modern Checheng, Pingtung County, Taiwan). He started Ming Hwa troupe, the predecessor of Ming Hwa Yuan, with Tsai Bin-hwa (蔡炳華), as proprietor of theater.\nIn the early stage, the Japanese rulers allowed the local customs to develop without much interference and Taiwanese opera continue to thrive. After the Pacific War broke out, the Japanese government implemented a Kōminka policy that encouraged Japanization. During this period (1937-1945), the Japanese government prohibited the public performance of Taiwanese opera. However, Ming Hwa troupe was one of the few groups that were allowed to perform.\nIn 1945, Taiwan was handed over to the Kuomintang-led Republic of China. Taiwanese opera was rejuvenated and became fashionable in Taiwan. In 1949, there were over 500 registered troupes. However, the American Westerns and Japanese Samurai movies blitzed the Taiwanese film market in the 1960s, which made the Taiwanese opera's box office flop.\nAfter experiencing the rise and fall of Taiwanese opera, Ming Hwa Yuan has not only absorbed social trends, but has innovated the art by integrating the elements of modern theater and cinema. In 1982, they won the first prize of the National Theater Competition in Taiwan by the opera “Father and Son” .\nBesides their performances and theatrical creations, Ming Hwa Yuan also conducts educational outreach related to Taiwanese opera. Additionally, the troupe actively participates in international events and has received invitations to showcase their talents in countries including Japan, France, the United States, Singapore, South Africa, and mainland China.\nOrganization\nMing Hwa Yuan is a family-owned troupe, managed by family members. Within the overarching organization of Ming Hwa Yuan, there are eight subgroups, namely \"tiān(天), dì(地), xuán(玄), huáng(黃), rì(日), yuè(月), xīng(星), chén(辰).\"\nAdditionally, collaborative teams established by family members or troupe members, including Xiu Hua Yuan, Sheng Qiu Tuan, Yang Ming Yuan, and Yi Hua Yuan, are distributed throughout various regions of Taiwan. In total, there are eight independent subgroups and four small collaborative teams.\nReferences cited\nFurther references\n*Lu, Yu Xiu. \"Taiwanese Opera.\" In The Music History of Taiwan, 170-172.
