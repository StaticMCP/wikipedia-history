This was on the same day as other local elections in England.\nPrior to the election the council was under Conservative majority control. Following the election the Conservatives remained the largest party but lost their majority, leaving the council under no overall control. A coalition of the independent councillors, Liberal Democrats and Greens formed a minority administration with informal support from Labour, with independent councillor Terry Parish being appointed leader of the council at the subsequent annual council meeting on 18 May 2023. A few days after the elections, unseated councillor and former mayor David Whitby passed away.\nSummary\nElection result\nThe overall results were:\n7\n|votes %       =40.8\n|seats %       =37.0\n|votes         =20,479\n|plus/minus    =–7.4\n}}\n3\n|votes %       =29.3\n|seats %       =33.3\n|votes         =14,687\n|plus/minus    =+2.9\n}}\n1\n|votes %       =18.3\n|seats %       =20.4\n|votes         =9,172\n|plus/minus    =+1.6\n}}\n2\n|votes %       =6.0\n|seats %       =5.6\n|votes         =3,014\n|plus/minus    =+4.0\n}}\n1\n|votes %       =5.1\n|seats %       =3.7\n|votes         =2,536\n|plus/minus    =+1.1\n}}\n|votes %       =0.4\n|seats %       =0.0\n|votes         =188\n|plus/minus    =N/A\n}}\n|votes %       =0.2\n|seats %       =0.0\n|votes         =98\n|plus/minus    =N/A\n}}\n|-\nWard results\nThe Statement of Persons Nominated, which details the candidates standing in each ward, was released by South Norfolk District Council following the close of nominations on 5 April 2023.
