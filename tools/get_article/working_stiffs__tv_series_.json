The brothers work in an office building owned by their Uncle Harry, and share an apartment over a cafe where they befriend the owner Mitch and waitress Nikki. Each episode features slapstick and physical comedy. Penny Marshall directed the pilot.\nThe series aired on CBS. It competed against the highly-rated shows NBC's CHiPs and ABC's The Ropers in its timeslot. Nine episodes were produced but after four episodes aired, the series was canceled. After Belushi and Keaton became film stars in the 1980s, six episodes of the show were released on home video. Reruns have also aired on A&E Network, Comedy Central and TV Land. The syndication package included the previously unaired episodes.\nCast\n*James Belushi as Ernie O'Rourke\n*Michael Keaton as Mike O'Rourke\n*Val Bisoglio as Al Steckler\n*Allan Arbus as Mitch Hannigan\n*Lorna Patterson as Nikki Evashevsky\nRecurring\n*Phil Rubenstein as Frank Falzone\nEpisode list\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" background:#fff;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#63B8FF; width:20px\"| Nº\n! style=\"background:#63B8FF\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#63B8FF\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background:#63B8FF\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:#63B8FF; width:135px\"| Original air date\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 63B8FF\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 63B8FF\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 63B8FF\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 63B8FF\n}}\n|}\nReferences\nBrooks, Tim; Earl Marsh (2003).
