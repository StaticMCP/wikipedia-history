Some 33 captured Unitarian officers were executed.\nAftermath\nLamadrid and most of its officers sought refuge in Salta Province, but the provincial government refused to organize a new army to oppose Quiroga, and they had to flee to Bolivia.\nThe federal victory ended Unitarian attempts to control Argentina for several years.\nOn December 2, the governors of La Rioja Province and Salta Province signed a peace agreement in Tucumán, in which Salta undertook to clearly follow federal policy and to pay the costs of the war to La Rioja. General Alejandro Heredia was elected governor of Tucumán, and through his influence  the Salta government was assumed by the Federalist Pablo Latorre.  Years later, Heredia would expel Latorre from his post.\nThe most prominent Unitarian party leaders in Tucumán were forced to pay reparations demanded by Quiroga,\nbut these were not paid off in full because of the friendship of Heredia and Quiroga.\nCatamarca province also was ordered to pay the cost of repairing war damage to La Rioja.\nReferences\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\n* |url=http://www.lagazeta.com.ar/ciudadela.htm |journal=La Gazeta\n|title=Batalla de La Ciudadela (4 de noviembre de 1831)}}\n*|url=http://www.revisionistas.com.ar/?p=2952 |work=Revisionistas » Blog Archive »\n|title=Batalla de la Ciudadela}}\n* |url=http://www.portalplanetasedna.com.ar/batallas_argentinas.htm\n|title=Breve Descripción de Batallas Argentinas}}\n* |url=http://www.revisionistas.com.ar/?p=3138 |work=Revisionistas\n|title=Facundo Quiroga}}\n*\n* |url=http://www.ucema.edu.ar/ceieg/arg-rree/3/3-047.htm\n|title=La situación del noroeste entre 1830 y 1834}}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*=\n*\n*"
