The aircraft is supplied in the form of plans for amateur construction. The Cygnet first flew in 1973.\nThe Cygnet plans were originally marketed by the designer through his company Sisler Aircraft of Bloomington, Minnesota and later by HAPI Engines, a supplier of Volkswagen air-cooled engines. By the 1990s Viking Aircraft of Elkhorn, Wisconsin took over supplying the aircraft plans.\nDesign and development\nThe SF-2A Cygnet is a development of the earlier Sisler SF-2 Whistler introduced in 1973. The design features a strut-braced shoulder-wing, a two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit under a bubble canopy, fixed conventional landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration.\nThe aircraft is made from wood, 4130 steel tubing and covered in doped aircraft fabric. Its  span wing employs a NACA 3413 airfoil, has an area of  and is supported by a single strut with a jury strut. The cockpit is  wide and has a baggage compartment with a limit of , located behind the seats. The aircraft's recommended engine power range is  and standard engines used include the  Volkswagen four-stroke powerplant. Construction time from the supplied kit is estimated as 1700–1800 hours.\nThe Cygnet won a design award at the EAA Annual Convention and Fly-In in 1973.\nOperational history\nBy January 2003, 100 examples had been reported as completed and flown.\nIn July 2016 a total of 19 SF-2A Cygnets were registered in the United States with the Federal Aviation Administration, four with Transport Canada and seven with the Civil Aviation Authority in the United Kingdom.\nIn a 2020 review, AVweb writer Paul Dye concluded, \"Flying a piece of history (and with a forward swept wing, something fairly unique!) is always fun. Just like all strange meat gets described as \"tasting like chicken\", it is easy to describe airplanes like this as flying \"like a Cub\"—and it’s true, in the sense that it is well-mannered and easy to steer around the sky. Yes, that visibility at the start of a turn is going to take a little getting used to, as is the landing attitude. But if you take the time to get it figured out, the Cygnet is a nice little airplane with a Midwest tradition. Honest, straightforward, and enjoyable.\".\nSpecifications (SF-2A Cygnet)\n|more general=\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=Volkswagen air-cooled engine\n|eng1 type=four cylinder, 1835 cc, four stroke automotive conversion\n|eng1 kw=\n|eng1 hp=82\n|prop blade number=\n|prop name=\n|prop dia m=\n|prop dia ft=\n|prop dia in=\n|prop note=\n|perfhide=\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=108\n|max speed kts=\n|max speed note=\n|cruise speed kmh=\n|cruise speed mph=100\n|cruise speed kts=\n|cruise speed note=\n|stall speed kmh=\n|stall speed mph=48\n|stall speed kts=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|never exceed speed mph=\n|never exceed speed kts=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|range km=\n|range miles=390\n|range nmi=\n|range note=\n|endurance=\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling ft=\n|ceiling note=\n|g limits=\n|roll rate=\n|glide ratio=\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate ftmin=580\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|sink rate ms=\n|sink rate ftmin=\n|sink rate note=\n|lift to drag=\n|wing loading kg/m2=\n|wing loading lb/sqft=\n|wing loading note=\n|power/mass=\n|thrust/weight=\n|more performance=\n|avionics=\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
