The ward has existed since the creation of the borough on 1 April 1965 and was first used in the 1964 elections. It returns councillors to Camden London Borough Council. The ward was subject to boundary revisions in 1971, 1978 and 2002 which also adjusted the number of councillors returned. The most recent change in 2022 significantly altered the boundaries of the ward. The ward has been dominated by councillors standing as Labour Party candidates throughout its existence.\nList of councillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Term\n!
