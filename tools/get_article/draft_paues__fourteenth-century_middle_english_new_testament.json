She compiled this book from four different manuscripts, in libraries at the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford.\nThese were notable because until this time, only the Middle English Bible versions associated with John Wycliffe were known. In Paues' words – the manuscripts' \"chief interest lay, not in the language, but in the fact that they represented a Biblical translation differing from and possibly older than the versions attributed to Wycliffe and his followers.\"\nSources\nThe sources are:\n* Selwyn College 108. L. 1. (Cambridge)\n** Epistles, Matthew's Gospel (1:1 to 6:13), in Southern dialect (perhaps Herefordshire)\n** Acts (not used by Paues), in Northern Dialect\n* Parker 434, Corpus Christi College. (Cambridge)\n** Later manuscript with same text as Selwyn\n* University Library Dd. XII. 89. (Cambridge)\n** Acts, in Midlands/Northern dialect\n* Douce 250, Bodleian Library. (Oxford)\n** Similar to previous\n** Alternate translations of James, 1 Peter, 2 Peter, and 1 John, in Southern dialect. These were not in the 1902 thesis, but were included in the 1904 edition from Cambridge University.\nAs well, in the 1904 edition:\n* Holkam Hall misc. 40, formerly Holkam Hall  672 (Earl of Leicester)\n** Addition source of the Epistles with some Kentish dialect influence, allowing some corrections.\n** Paired with Gospels from the Wycliffite Early Version.\nPaues notes that vernacular translations of spiritual material were often made for nuns, whose Latin was often not as good as monks'.\nContents\nPaues' books have transcriptions for:\n* Catholic Epistles\n* Pauline Epistles, except Epistle to Philemon\n* Acts\n* Gospel according to Matthew 1:1 to 6:3\nThe source manuscripts do not have the other Gospels nor the Book of Revelation.\nThe Book of Acts seems to have been translated from an unknown Old Latin source, as it has variants not found elsewhere.\nThe Oxford History of Literary Translations into English notes that there is no obvious relation to the Wycliffite Bibles and the translation is distinct from it. The Epistles are in a Southern (Kentish) dialect, while the Acts and Matthew fragment are in a Midlands dialect: historian Margaret Deansley dates them from before perhaps 1380, but notes that one manuscript pairs the Catholic epistles with a Wycliffe Later version Gospels, while another pairs the Matthew/Acts text with a different Northern Midlands set of epistles.\nTwo of the manuscripts have a prologue, perhaps of a later date (Deansley suggests 1388 to 1400), in which a brother (a monk?) and a \"suster\" (a nun?) dialogue with a brother (a superior monk?), asking him to teach them what is necessary for their souls.\nSpread\nHistorian David Lawton has disputed whether Paues' terming of a \"fourteenth century biblical version\" (EBV) is accurate, because \"it may not be (entirely) fourteenth century, attempts nothing of the Old Testament and only half a Gospel of the New, and is a compilation of texts perhaps newly combined.\"\nPaues' notes that, in combination with other manuscripts:\n}}\nPaues also notes the existence of a translation of the 112 ordinary Gospel readings for the liturgy in manuscript Pepys 2498, Magdalene College, Cambridge (Cambridge) in mixed dialect. The 1902 book includes a chapter detailing the Middle English translation of the Book of Revelation formerly attributed to Wycliffe, found in 16 manuscripts and apparently being three different translations of a popular earlier Anglo-Norman version which exists in 80 manuscripts.\nIt is not known how widely these non-Wycliffite versions had spread in England. Historian Paul F. Schaffner notes that almost half of the Middle English text Life of Soul consists of biblical quotations which bear a close resemblance to those of Paues'. Historian James Knowles notes a Wycliffite sermon that uses words found in non-Wycliffite translations, including Paues, in preference to the Wycliffite Bibles' choice.\nEven recently, 100 years after their publication, some scholars working in the area of Wycliffe's Middle English Bible were unaware of the existence of these translations.\nReferences"
