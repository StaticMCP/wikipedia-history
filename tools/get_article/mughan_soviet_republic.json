It was founded in opposition to the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in Baku. It was proclaimed mostly by the ethnic Russian part of the population of the region, and ceased to exist when the army of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic took control over the region.\nReferences\nSee also\n*Azerbaijan Democratic Republic\n*Provisional Military Dictatorship of Mughan\n*Talysh-Mughan Autonomous Republic"
