The music video stars Jill Kroesen and was innovative for its use of blending faces with a dissolving /morphing technique that would later be employed in music videos for Godley & Creme's \"Cry\" (1985) and Michael Jackson's \"Black or White\" (1991).\nThe song was later recorded by King Crimson guitarist and singer Adrian Belew for his 1990 solo album, Young Lions.\nTrack listing\n7\" version\n#\"Heartbeat\" (Adrian Belew, Bill Bruford, Robert Fripp, Tony Levin)\n#\"Requiem\" (Edited version) (Belew, Bruford, Fripp, Levin)\n12\" version\n#\"Heartbeat\" (Belew, Bruford, Fripp, Levin)\n#\"Neal and Jack and Me\" (Belew, Bruford, Fripp, Levin)\n#\"Sartori in Tangier\" (Belew, Bruford, Fripp, Levin)\nPersonnel\n*Adrian Belew – guitar, lead vocals\n*Robert Fripp – guitar\n*Tony Levin – bass guitar, Chapman stick, backing vocals\n*Bill Bruford – drums\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Chart (1982)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
