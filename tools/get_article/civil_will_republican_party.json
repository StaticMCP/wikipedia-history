It was the result of a merger between the Civil Will Party and the Republican Party on February 22, 2002. The party split up before the 2004 parliamentary elections.\nHistory\nOn 22 February 2002, the Civil Will Party (CWP) headed by Sanjaasürengiin Oyuun and the Republican Party (RP) headed by Bazarsadyn Jargalsaikhan merged for the upcoming 2004 parliamentary election. CWP chairwoman Sanjaasürengiin Oyuun was elected the party chairperson, while RP chairman Bazarsadyn Jargalsaikhan was elected first deputy chairperson.\nThe CW–RP signed a electoral agreement with the Democratic Party, agreeing to run together in the national and local elections until 2004. However, the party would split in April 2004 when the RP decided to field its own candidates for the 2004 elections and was officially registered by the Supreme Court of Mongolia on April 5.\n2004 parliamentary elections\nThe CW–RP ran as part of the Motherland Democratic Coalition (MDC) for the 2004 elections. The coalition won 35 out of 76 seats in the State Great Khural, 2 of these seats belonged to the CW–RP. The RP also won a single seat in parliament, making them eligible for competing in the 2005 presidential election. Despite the dissolution of the MDC in late 2004, the CW–RP did not nominate their own candidate for the 2005 election and declined to back any of the four candidates.\nThe party continued to operate as the Civil Will–Republican Party until January 2006, when it changed its party name to the Civil Will Party. With the name change, the nearly four-year existence of the CW–RP came to an end.\nElectoral history\nState Great Khural elections\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!Party leader\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n!+/–\n!Position\n!Government\n|-\n|2004\n|Sanjaasürengiin Oyuun\n|464,479\n|44.85%\n|\n| 2\n| 2nd\n|\n|}\nReferences"
