      "text": "# Windward Coast\n\nThe Windward Coast is an area of West Africa located on the coast between Cape Mount and Assini, i.e. the coastlines of the modern states of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Ivory Coast, to the west of the Gold Coast.  A related region is the Pepper Coast. It is called the Windward Coast because it was a place where European sailors met the Atlantic trade winds head-on, windward = upwind, or the direction from which the wind is blowing.\nCulture\nThe Windwarders were renowned for their rice and indigo cultivation.\nReferences"
