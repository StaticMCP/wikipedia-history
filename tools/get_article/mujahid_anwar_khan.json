On 27th February 2019 the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) conducted six airstrikes at multiple locations in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). The airstrikes were part of the PAF military operation codenamed Operation Swift Retort and were conducted in retaliation to the Indian Air Force (IAF) airstrike in Balakot just a day before on 26 February.\nFollowing Pakistan's airstrikes, Indian Air Force (IAF) jets started pursuing Pakistan Air Force (PAF) jets. In the resulting dogfight, Pakistan claimed to have shot down two Indian jets and captured one Indian pilot, Abhinandan Varthaman. India claimed to have shot down one Pakistani F16 without giving substantive evidence to support its claim.\nAs a result of the fog of war created out of the dogfight between two airforces, Indian Airforce shot down its own Mil Mi-17 helicopter due to a friendly fire incident in which six IAF personnel were killed including two squadron leaders, namely, Siddarth Vashista and Ninad Mandavgane.\nAwards and decorations\n{| style=\"margin:1em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\"|\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=\"4\" |PAF GD(P) Badge RED (More than 3000 Flying Hours)\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |Parachutist Badge\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Nishan-e-Imtiaz\n(Civilian)\n(Order of Excellence)\n| colspan=\"2\" |Nishan-e-Imtiaz\n(Military)\n(Order of Excellence)\n|-\n|Hilal-i-Imtiaz\n(Military)\n(Crescent of Excellence)\n|Sitara-i-Imtiaz\n(Military)\n(Star of Excellence)\n|Tamgha-i-Imtiaz\n(Military)\n(Medal of Excellence)\n|Tamgha-e-Baqa\n(Nuclear Test Medal)\n1998\n|-\n|Tamgha-e-Istaqlal Pakistan\n(Escalation with India Medal)\n2002\n|Tamgha-e-Azm\n(Medal of Conviction)\n(2018)\n|10 Years Service Medal\n|20 Years Service Medal\n|-\n|30 Years Service Medal\n|35 Years Service Medal\n|40 Years Service Medal\n|Hijri Tamgha\n(Hijri Medal)\n1979\n|-\n|Tamgha-e-Jamhuriat\n(Democracy Medal)\n1988\n|Qarardad-e-Pakistan Tamgha\n(Resolution Day\nGolden Jubilee Medal)\n1990\n|Tamgha-e-Salgirah Pakistan\n(Independence Day\nGolden Jubilee Medal)\n1997\n|Order of Merit of the Republic of Turkey\n2018\n|}\nForeign Decorations\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#006400; color:#FFFFFF; text-align:center\" |Foreign Award\n|-\n!\n|Order of Merit of the Republic of Turkey\n|\n|}\nEffective dates of promotion\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!style=\"background:#FFFFE0\"| Insignia !! style=\"background:#FFFFE0\"|Rank !!style=\"background:#FFFFE0\"| Date\n|-\n|style=\"background:#88EEEE;\"| ||style=\"background:#88EEEE;\"|Air Chief Marshal||style=\"background:#88EEEE;\"|19 March 2018\n|-\n|style=\"background:#88EEEE;\"|||style=\"background:#88EEEE;\"|Air Marshal  ||style=\"background:#88EEEE;\"|29 February 2016\n|-\n|style=\"background:#88EEEE;\"|  ||style=\"background:#88EEEE;\"|Air Vice Marshal||style=\"background:#88EEEE;\"|2 July 2013\n|-\n|style=\"background:#88EEEE;\"|||style=\"background:#88EEEE;\"|Air Commodore|| style=\"background:#88EEEE;\"|1 September 2009\n|-\n|style=\"background:#b2cefe;\"|||style=\"background:#b2cefe;\"|Group Captain|| style=\"background:#b2cefe;\"|15 March 2004\n|-\n|style=\"background:#b2cefe;\"|||style=\"background:#b2cefe;\"|Wing Commander|| style=\"background:#b2cefe;\"|1 August 1998\n|-\n|style=\"background:#b2cefe;\"|||style=\"background:#b2cefe;\"|Squadron Leader ||style=\"background:#b2cefe;\"|9 August 1990\n|-\n|style=\"background:#b2cefe;\"|||style=\"background:#b2cefe;\"|Flight Lieutenant || style=\"background:#b2cefe;\"|8 March 1987\n|-\n|style=\"background:#e6e6aa;\"||| style=\"background:#e6e6aa;\"|Flying Officer || style=\"background:#e6e6aa;\"|1 March 1985\n|-\n|style=\"background:#e6e6aa;\"|||style=\"background:#e6e6aa;\"|Pilot Officer||style=\"background:#e6e6aa;\"|5 December 1983\n|}\nNotes\nReferences"
