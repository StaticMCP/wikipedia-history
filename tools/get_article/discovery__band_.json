Their music drew from the sounds of synth-pop and auto-tuned R&B. As Discovery, Batmanglij and Miles began recording an album together in 2006, but the project was left unfinished as Vampire Weekend and Ra Ra Riot began to find chart success. After the release of the debut albums for both Vampire Weekend and Ra Ra Riot, Batmanglij and Miles returned to the studio to complete Discovery's debut album, LP, released in 2009.\nMembers\n*Rostam Batmanglij\n*Wes Miles\nDiscography\n* LP (July 7, 2009)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
