He served for 9 years as a page under queen consort Hedvig Eleonora. Danckwardt was named fänrik of the Västgöta-Dal Regiment in 1697 under Major Hugo Hamilton. Hamilton, during his previous service at another regiment, had then personally requested Danckwardt to be his captain. Hamilton was also responsible for Danckwardt's promotions to Major in 1711, and to Överstelöjtnant (Lieutenant colonel) in 1712.\nAfter the debacle at Poltava, Hamilton's regiment was moved from Stockholm to Malmö, where it participated in the Battle of Helsingborg in 1710. In 1712, it moved to Gothenburg.\nThe defense of Carlsten fortress\nDanckwardt was promoted to Colonel and commander of Carlsten fortress at Marstrand in 1712. When Carlsten was assaulted by Peder Tordenskjold's forces, Danckwardt was forced to surrender on 15 July 1719. Danckwardt was thereafter arrested while trying to evade custody, and sentenced to death.\nThe executioner was at the time, intoxicated and was therefore delayed. When the executioner at last arrived, he had to attempt the decapitation of Danckwardt twice before succeeding on 16 September 1719 in Gothenburg. The executioner received a formal warning.\nDanckwardt's fellow officers were also later sentenced by the court martial to the death penalty, but were pardoned.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*}}\n* Svenska män och kvinnor, 2.
