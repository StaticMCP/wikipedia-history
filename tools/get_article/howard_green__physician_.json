He is one of the founding fathers of stem-cell research and regenerative medicine. One famous case involving Doctor Green concerned Jamie and Glenn Selby, two children from Wyoming who were burned over 95% of their bodies. Green cut small patches of undamaged skin from the boys, grew them in a lab and was able to harvest skin grafts to cover their burns.\nEducation and personal life\nHoward Green was born in 1925 in Toronto, Ontario. He graduated from University of Toronto medical school.\nHe served in the United States Army. He taught at New York University School of Medicine, Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1970 to 1980, and Harvard Medical School from 1980 to 1993.\nGreen married Rosine Kauffmann Green née Kauffmann in  1954.\nHe died on October 31, 2015, outside Boston, Massachusetts.\nOn November 23, 2016, Shriner's Hospitals for Children in Boston announced the opening of the Howard Green Center for Children's Skin Health and Research, funded by a $3 million gift from his wife, Mrs. Rosine Kauffmann Green.\nAcademic positions held\nHarvard Medical School\nGeorge Higginson Professor of Cell Biology\nChairman - Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology 1980-1993\nHead of Green Lab\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nProfessor of Cell Biology\nNew York University School of Medicine\nFaculty member of the Department of Pathology\nAwards and honors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Award\n!Year\n|-\n|March of Dimes Prize in Developmental Biology\n|2012\n|-\n|Warren Alpert Foundation Prize\n|2010\n|-\n|Blaise Pascal Award in Medical and Life Sciences of the European Academy of Sciences\n|2007\n|-\n|Legion of Honour\n|2001\n|-\n|Lewis S.
