The case, which challenged the Judges' Remuneration and Conditions of Employment Act, 1989, was brought by Kathy Satchwell, an openly lesbian judge of the Transvaal Provincial Division (now known as the Gauteng Division) of the High Court.\nThe court ruled unanimously that the law violated the equality clause of the Bill of Rights, which forbids unfair discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The judgment therefore amended the law to extend the spousal benefits to same-sex partners who had undertaken \"reciprocal duties of support\". Although the holding, strictly speaking, was limited to judges and their partners, it was seen as having a wider effect, with the director of the Lesbian and Gay Equality Project describing it as \"yet another step toward the formal legal recognition of same-sex relationships\".\nIn 2003 it was realised that a new version of the act (the Judges' Remuneration and Conditions of Employment Act, 2001) had been passed and, due to a drafting error, still included the former discriminatory language. The Constitutional Court granted an order applying the reasoning of its earlier ruling to the new act.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2002/18.html Text of the main 2002 judgment]\n* [http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2002/18media.pdf Media summary of the judgment]\n* [http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2003/2.html Text of the subsequent 2003 judgment]"
