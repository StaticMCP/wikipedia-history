The war attracted 'mercenaries, adventurers and idealists', most of whom joined the Croatian Defence Forces (HOS), the paramilitary wing of the Croatian Party of Rights, at the beginning of the war. An interview with mercenaries was published in The Times in November 1991. Many extreme right volunteers from Western Europe, mainly from Germany, joined the HOS. Although Russians mainly volunteered on the Serb side, the small neo-Nazi \"Werewolf\" unit fought on the Croat side. The Croatian Army's \"First International Brigade\" based outside Osijek that consisted of 100 men had about half of the ranks being foreigners from France, Canada, Switzerland, Hungary, Portugal, Britain, Australia, the United States and Spain.\nYugoslav Albanians joined the Croatian Army in the war.

The Community of Associations of Volunteers () registered 2,579 Albanians fighting in the Croatian Army in 1991. Albanian President Bujar Nishani gave the Albanian veterans organization an order.
