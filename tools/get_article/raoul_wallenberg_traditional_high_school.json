It was founded in 1981 in honor of the Swedish architect, businessman, diplomat, and humanitarian Raoul Wallenberg. In recognition of its namesake, the school's motto is \"The individual can make a difference\" and all students are required to complete at least 100 hours of community service before graduating.\nHistory\nLand Development\nThe Wallenberg High School campus sits on the former site of the Lone Mountain Cemetery complex, specifically Calvary Cemetery, which was cleared for development.\nAnza Elementary School (1952-1981)\nIn February 1946, the board of education voted to appropriate $87,000 to purchase land for an elementary school in the Anza neighborhood which was then being developed. Two years later, in 1948, San Francisco voters approved a bond measure for $48,890,000 which was used to renovate existing schools and build new ones, one of which became Anza Elementary School, built for $915,000, which opened on September 3, 1952. On May 12, 1981 the Board of Education voted to convert the school into a high school, a decision opposed by some Richmond residents in part because the change would eliminate a Japanese-English bilingual program afforded to over 200 students.\nRaoul Wallenberg Traditional High School (1981-present)\nOn June 9, 1981 the school board voted to name the new high school after Raoul Wallenberg. On September 10, 1981 the school officially opened as Raoul Wallenberg Traditional High School. The descriptor \"traditional\" at the time referred to \"'back-to-basics' schools because of their stress on academics and student discipline\". Though traditional elementary schools existed in San Francisco, Wallenberg was the first high school to open with that distinction. The opening of these \"traditional\" schools was a strategy by SFUSD to combat the popularity of private schools as well as a response to criticism at the time that the district had misaligned priorities and had fallen behind on academic rigor. When it was opened the elementary school toilets and water fountains still had not been replaced to meet the needs of older students. The school was officially dedicated to Raoul Wallenberg on November 23, 1981 with Wallenberg's maternal half-sister, Nina Lagergren, and then Mayor Dianne Feinstein in attendance. This came just over a month after Wallenberg was posthumously granted honorary US citizenship.\nCampus\nSituated in the north of the city, in the Western Addition district, the school spans several blocks bounded by O'Farrell Street to the north, Masonic Avenue to the west, Vega Street to the south, and Anza Vista Avenue to the east. Wallenberg High School is located in the Anza Vista neighborhood to the east of the University of San Francisco's Lone Mountain Campus. The school is directly accessible via the SFMTA's 31, 38, and 43 bus lines.\nThe campus includes a library, an art studio and music classroom, an auditorium, a computer lab, an indoor gymnasium with a court used for basketball, badminton and volleyball, a Wellness Center, and an outdoor weightlifting gym. The southwest blacktop, known as the \"lower yard\", was renovated in 2023 and features two basketball courts along with a multipurpose court for tennis, badminton, and pickleball. The central patio is known as the \"upper yard\" and is home to the school's 3 garden areas and greenhouse. On the eastern side of campus is the annex building which was constructed in 2011. The campus has two faculty parking lots, one off of Nido Avenue and another off of O'Farrell Street.\nAcademics and Class Structure\nIn the 2024-2025 school year students had the opportunity to choose from several Advanced Placement courses, including: Biology, Calculus AB, Computer Science Principles, English Literature & Composition, Environmental Science, Macroeconomics, Statistics, US Government and Politics, and US History.\nThe career and technical education pathways offered include: Biotechnology, Computer Science, and Environmental Science, Engineering, and Policy (ESEP).\nStudent Activities\nAthletics\nFor the 2022-2023 school year, Wallenberg High School is a member of the California Interscholastic Federation in the following sports:\n* Badminton (co-ed)\n* Baseball (boys)\n* Basketball (boys and girls)\n* Cross country (co-ed)\n* Flag football (girls)\n* Golf (boys and girls)\n* Soccer (boys and girls)\n* Softball (girls)\n* Swimming (co-ed)\n* Tennis (boys and girls)\n* Track and field (co-ed)\n* Volleyball (boys and girls)\nClubs\nAs of the 2024-25 school year Wallenberg's clubs include: Acts of Random Kindness, Badminton Club, Charity Club, Cooking Club, Gaming Club, Gardening Club, Kaibigan, Psychology Pathways, Red Cross Club, Upcycling club, and Yarn Club.
