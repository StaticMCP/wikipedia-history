This continued torment of the English people led King Æthelred to sign a peace treaty with the Vikings, in which the king promised provisions and the payment (referred to as Danegeld) of £10,000 in return for the Vikings to cease their assaults on the English and for their support against any other possible enemy attacks upon the land. The most influential leader among the Vikings appears to have been Olaf Tryggvason, who would later become king of Norway. Ultimately, the agreement failed, and Viking raids resumed not long after.\nTerms of the 994 treaty\nÆthelred II once again attempted to broker peace with the Viking forces in 994, after heavy raiding had taken place throughout the year. This new treaty (often referred to as II Æthelred) was made between Æthelred and three leaders of the Norwegian Viking armies, called Guthmund Steitason, Josteinn and Olaf Tryggvason (referred to as Anlaf in the original document). Just as had been the case in the treaty of 991, the Vikings were asked to offer their protection against other forces who threatened the peace in England, including attacks launched by other Vikings. The raiders were once again paid tribute, though this time the sum of Danegeld was £16,000. The treaty also contained an amnesty clause, whereby all past violence was forgiven, as the treaty stated 'all the slaughter and all the harrying and all the injuries which were committed before the peace was established, all of them are to be dismissed, and no one is to avenge it or ask for compensation'. This was one of the first texts produced before 1200 that specifically stated that neither party could ask for redress (compensation) for any previous offense.\nThe agreement also made clear how any further disputes would be settled, as it stated that if the English killed more than eight Viking men, this would be considered a breach of the peace and a proclamation of war. Meanwhile, if a member of the Viking army murdered an English subject, they alone would be outlawed, indicating that King Æthelred was prepared to make substantial compromises to achieve peace and military assistance.\nAftermath\nAfter the agreement was reached, Olaf Tryggvason was invited to Andover in honour and baptised as a Christian, with Æthelred acting as his sponsor. As he had in 991, Olaf promised to never again attack England, though this time he kept his word. After this time, Olaf is never again mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and disappears from English history, instead appearing in some of the earliest known Scandinavian sources. It is stated in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle that gifts were presented to Olaf at his meeting in Andover with King Æthelred, and it is possible that these may have included alms or ships to assist with his conquest of Norway. Scandinavian sources also mention that Olaf was provided with a clergy, to aid him in his endeavour of converting Norway to Christianity; between 995 and 1000, Olaf had successfully converted Norway, Iceland, Greenland and the Shetlands to Christianity. Therefore, while a peace treaty was established between the Viking leaders and Æthelred in 994, it is also possible that the meeting at Andover may have concluded in the English dynasty and Olaf becoming allies.\nReferences"
