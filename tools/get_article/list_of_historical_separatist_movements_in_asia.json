Separatism includes autonomism and secessionism.\nCriteria\nWhat is and is not considered an autonomist or secessionist movement is sometimes contentious. Entries on this list must meet three criteria:\n# They are no longer an active movement with active members.\n# They are demanded greater autonomy or self-determination for a geographic region (as opposed to personal autonomy).\n# They were citizens/people of the conflict area and did not come from another country.\nUnder each region listed is one or more of the following:\n* De facto state (de facto entity): for unrecognized regions with de facto autonomy.\n* Proposed state: proposed name for a seceding sovereign state.\n* Proposed autonomous area: for movements towards greater autonomy for an area but not outright secession.\n** De facto autonomous government: for governments with de facto autonomous control over a region.\n** Government-in-exile: for a government based outside of the region in question, with or without control.\n** Political party (or parties): for political parties involved in a political system to push for autonomy or secession.\n** Militant organisation(s): for armed organisations.\n** Advocacy group(s): for non-belligerent, non-politically participatory entities.\n** Ethnic/ethno-religious/racial/regional/religious group(s).\nList\nAzerbaijan\nPeople: Armenian people\n* Political party: Government of Artsakh\n* Proposed de facto state:\n* Status: Inactive following Azerbaijan's siege and military conquest of the region and the subsequent flight of the entire Armenian population.\nBangladesh\n* People: Jumma people\n** Political party: Porbotto Chottogram Jonshonghoti Shomiti\n** Rebel organisation: Shanti Bahini\n** Proposed state: Autonomous Hill Tribes\n** Status: Inactive following the 1996 peace treaty between the Government of Bangladesh and the tribal leaders.\n* People: Bengali Hindus\n** Political party: Swadhin Bangabhumi Andolan\n** Rebel organisation: Banga Sena\n** Proposed State: Bangabhumi\nChina\nMainland China\n* De facto state:\n** Political party: Chinese Communist Party\n** Armed organization: Chinese Red Army\n* Proposed state:\n** Political party: Chinese Communist Party\nOuter Mongolia\n* De facto state:  Great Mongolian State\n** Political organization: Bogd Khanate\n* Proposed state:  Mongolian People's Republic\n** Political party: Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party\nCyprus\n* Rebel organizations: EOKA, Turkish Resistance Organisation\nFrance (associated territories)\nIndochina\n* Proposed state:  Kingdom of Cambodia\n** Political organization: Khmer Issarak\n* Proposed state:  Laos\n* Militant organization: Lao Issara, Pathet Lao\n* Proposed state:  State of Vietnam\n** Political organization: Viet Quoc\nMandate of Syria\n* Political organization: National Bloc\nIndia\n* People: Sikh\n** Militant organisation:  Khalistan Liberation Force, Babbar Khalsa, Khalistan Commando Force\n** Proposed state: Khalistan\n** Status: Armed insurgency crushed\n* People: Tripuri\n** Militant organisation: National Liberation Front of Tripura, All Tripura Tiger Force\n** Proposed state:  Tipperaland\n** Status: Separatist movement crushed.
