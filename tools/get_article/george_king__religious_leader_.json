His father (also called George King) was a school teacher and mother Mary a nurse and later small business owner. The family relocated on several occasions as his father sought better appointments, settling for a period in North Yorkshire. King was educated at Guisborough Grammar School. In 1937 King at the age of 18 left the family home and moved to London. Led by his belief in pacifism he became a conscientious objector during the Second World War, serving in the Auxiliary Fire Service. Later he worked as a chauffeur and security officer.\nAs a youth and young man King studied theosophy, spiritualism, anthroposophy, rosicrucianism and yoga. In 1954, he claimed that a voice told him \"Prepare yourself! You are to become the voice of Interplanetary Parliament\". Afterwards in 1955, he founded the Aetherius Society and published the book Contact Your Higher Self Through Yoga. In 1959 he was interviewed on BBC television about his beliefs and experiences.\nGeorge King died in Santa Barbara, California, on 12 July 1997, at the age of 78, according to the Aetherius Society. However, his death was not reported in major newspapers.\nTitles\nThe Aetherius Society usually refers to King as \"Dr. George King\". The society does not, however, document where King received his doctorate. David Barrett states that King received his doctorate from the \"International Theological Seminary of California, a degree mill with no accreditation\". King is also referred to as Metropolitan Archbishop of the Aetherius Churches. His consecration as a bishop was from the Theosophy-related Liberal Catholic Church.\nKing is also \"referred to [by the society] as an author, inventor, metaphysician, occultist, prophet, psychic, spiritual healer, spiritual leader, teacher, yogi and Aquarian master\". He was also lavished with innumerable titles, degrees, and honors from unorthodox sources. According to the society, the various honors were all given to King as a \"token offer of gratitude\" for his work. Mikael Rothstein observes that all of this hagiographical material is primarily aimed at believers who have special, 'esoteric' knowledge about King, whereas the society's communications during publicity campaigns are angled differently.\nBarrett notes that amongst King's titles are listed a Knighthood in the Sovereign Military Orthodox Dynastic Imperial Constantinian Order of Saint George, which was from a branch of the Byzantine Royal House in exile, and was not recognized by the College of Arms in England, as the title \"Sir\" might imply. King received other chivalric titles and various degrees. Barrett states that neither the chivalric titles nor the degrees were recognized by any mainstream bodies.\nAccording to one source, King used as a formal title \"His Eminence Sir George King, O.S.P., Ph.D., Th.D., D.D., Metropolitan Archbishop of the Aetherius Churches.\" The knighthood is not British but from \"an unspecified foreign source\". American radio personality Long John Nebel had King as a guest on his show and later wrote: \" 'George King of England' – is what he calls himself, and you can't be sure whether he's pausing after 'George,' or after 'King,' but it doesn't really matter because after about three minutes you get the idea strong and clear.\"\nIn 1991 King was \"presented Letters Patent of Armorial Bearings also known as a Grant of Arms, by Bluemantle Pursuivant, a Herald of Her Majesty's College of Arms in England.\" A Grant of Arms is applied for; anyone can receive a Grant of Arms, if they can satisfy one of several requirements, but King could not and his grant was annulled the following year.\nAccording to skeptic James Randi, George King's titles of 'Reverend', 'Doctor' and 'Sir' are unverified.\nReception and criticism\nKing has been described as a mystagogue and a religious virtuoso in the manner he formed and led the development of the Aetherius Society as a \"magico-religious\" organisation. His claims have been denounced as pseudoscience by some skeptics.\nPublications\nSelected writings:\n*1955. Contact Your Higher Self Through Yoga. Los Angeles: Aetherius Society.\n*1958.
