However, starting in 1989, separate categories for performances in children's series and performances in children's specials were created and used until after 2007 when all categories related to Children's Specials were dropped.\nThe youngest Emmy nominee, Jodelle Ferland, was nominated in this category in 2001 at the age of six. The youngest Emmy winner, Bindi Irwin, won in 2008 at age nine.\nIn November 2021, the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences announced that all Daytime Emmy categories honoring children's programming will be retired in favor of a separate Children's & Family Emmy Awards ceremony, to be held starting in 2022.\nWinners and Nominees\nWinners in bold.
