The park system was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux and developed between 1868 and 1876.\nThe park system was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.\nComponents\nThe Delaware Park–Front Park System encompasses the following parts:\nDelaware Park\nThe centerpiece of the Buffalo, New York parks system and located in the North Buffalo neighborhood. The  park was named simply The Park by Olmsted; it was later renamed Delaware Park because of its proximity to Delaware Avenue, Buffalo's mansion row.  It is divided into two areas: the  \"Meadow Park\" on the east and the  \"Water Park\", with what was originally a  lake, on the west. The  ravine and picnic grove on the south side of the lake comprise a subdivision of the latter.  Olmsted dammed Scajaquada Creek to create the lake, originally called Gala Water, then Delaware Park Lake, and now known as Hoyt Lake. The lake was a feature during the Pan-American Exposition. The Scajaquada Expressway bisects the park west to east.\nThe Albright-Knox Art Gallery occupies the park's western edge, overlooking Hoyt Lake, and the Buffalo History Museum is situated on its northern edge, overlooking Scajaquada Creek.  The park is home to Shakespeare in Delaware Park, a summer tradition since the mid-1970s, and the second largest free outdoor Shakespeare festival in the United States (after New York City's).  It is also the location of the Buffalo Zoo on the east side of Meadow Park.  The park has a golf course, two baseball diamonds, a softball diamond, cross country running, tennis courts, and soccer fields.\nContributing structures are: Caretakers Cottage (1889); Lincoln Parkway Bridge (1900), designed by Green and Wicks; Rose Garden Pergola (1912); Stone Bridge (ca. 1887), the only remaining structure from the original Olmsted plan; Parkside Lodge (1914); Rumsey Shelter (1900); Main Zoo Building (1935–1940); Shelter House (ca. 1900); and Elephant House (ca. 1912).  Located north of the park are the Parkside East Historic District and Parkside West Historic District and to the south are the Elmwood Historic District–East and Elmwood Historic District–West, all listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nStatue of David\nThe park is home to an exact replica of Michelangelo's David. It is 18 feet tall and weighs 3000 pounds. The statue was dedicated in 1903, one of only three bronze replicas made of the original sculpture. At one time it included a fig leaf, which was not present in the original; this was later removed so David can be viewed in all his glory. When the statue was rededicated in 2013, it was given a new plaque which corrected the spelling of the artist's name from Michael Angelo to Michelangelo.\nGates Circle\nOriginally Chapin Place, a  plot measuring  at the intersection of Delaware Avenue, Lafayette Avenue, and Chapin Parkway.
