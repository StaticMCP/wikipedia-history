Lorenzo Fontana, a member of the Lega was elected on the fourth ballot with 222 votes.\nProcedure\nThe election takes place by secret ballot. A two-thirds supermajority of the whole membership is needed to win on the first ballot. On the second and third ballots, a two-thirds supermajority of votes cast (including blank ballots among the totals) suffices. Starting from the fourth ballot, the threshold is further lowered to a simple majority of members present.\nHistory\nAs required by the assembly's standing orders, the election took place by secret ballot. Ettore Rosato, of Action – Italia Viva (A–IV) (being the most senior member to have served as Vice President of the Chamber of Deputies in the previous Parliament) served as acting presiding officer.\nIn early October the centre-right coalition, which held 237 seats (a majority of 36) designated Riccardo Molinari, a member of the League, as its official candidate for the Presidency of the Chamber. On the first three ballots, a two-thirds supermajority was required according to the standing orders; as no political coalition had enough seats to reach such a number, party leaders instructed  MPs to cast blank ballots. Nonetheless, some members received a few votes on the first three ballots.\nFollowing the election of Ignazio La Russa as President of the Senate and tensions within the centre-right, Lorenzo Fontana replaced Molinari as the official candidate of the conservative coalition shortly after the third ballot took place.\nResults\nFirst ballot\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: align=left\"\n!colspan=2|Candidate\n!Party\n!Votes\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Riccardo Molinari\n|Lega\n|4\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Enrico Letta\n|Democratic Party\n|3\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|colspan=2|Others\n|6\n|-\n|colspan=3|Blank votes\n|368\n|-\n|colspan=3|Invalid votes\n|7\n|-\n|colspan=3|Did not vote\n|8\n|-\n|colspan=3|Needed to win\n|267\n|}\nSecond ballot\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: align=left\"\n!colspan=2|Candidate\n!Party\n!Votes\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Enrico Letta\n|Democratic Party\n|4\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Riccardo Molinari\n|Lega\n|3\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Nico Stumpo\n|Democratic Party\n|3\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|colspan=2|Others\n|7\n|-\n|colspan=3|Blank votes\n|368\n|-\n|colspan=3|Invalid votes\n|7\n|-\n|colspan=3|Did not vote\n|11\n|-\n|colspan=3|Needed to win\n|259\n|}\nThird ballot\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: align=left\"\n!colspan=2|Candidate\n!Party\n!Votes\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Andrea Casu\n|Democratic Party\n|3\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Riccardo Molinari\n|Lega\n|3\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|colspan=2|Others\n|7\n|-\n|colspan=3|Blank votes\n|368\n|-\n|colspan=3|Invalid votes\n|7\n|-\n|colspan=3|Did not vote\n|22\n|-\n|colspan=3|Needed to win\n|252\n|}\nFourth ballot\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: align=left\"\n!colspan=2|Candidate\n!Party\n!Votes\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Lorenzo Fontana\n|Lega\n|bgcolor=#CEF6D8 |222\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Maria Cecilia Guerra\n|Democratic Party\n|77\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Federico Cafiero de Raho\n|Five Star Movement\n|52\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Matteo Richetti\n|Action – Italia Viva\n|22\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|colspan=2|Others\n|2\n|-\n|colspan=3|Blank votes\n|6\n|-\n|colspan=3|Invalid votes\n|11\n|-\n|colspan=3|Did not vote\n|11\n|-\n|colspan=3|Needed to win\n|197\n|}\nSee also\n* 2022 President of the Italian Senate election\nNotes\nReferences"
