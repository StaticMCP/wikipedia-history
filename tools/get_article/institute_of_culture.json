The phrase \"cultural leisure\" (культурный досуг) was among the Soviet cliches: supposedly the proper organization of the cultural leisure of the Soviet people was the major tool in combatting the \"vestiges of capitalism\" and the molding of the \"New Soviet Man\".\nInstitutes of Culture were the institutions to train the professional \"organizers of the cultural leisure\", such as heads of hobby groups, of dance schools and collectives, folk dance and music ensembles, managers of various sections of Palaces of Culture, managers of \"culture-educational work\" in various schools, Young Pioneer camps, etc."
