      "text": "# Republic of Ireland at the UEFA European Championship\n\nThe UEFA European Championship is the main football competition of the men's national football teams governed by UEFA (the Union of European Football Associations). Held every four years since 1960, in the even-numbered year between World Cup tournaments, it was originally called the '''UEFA European Nations' Cup', changing to the current name in 1968. Starting with the 1996 tournament, specific championships are often referred to in the form \"Euro 2008\" or whichever year is appropriate.\nPrior to entering the tournament all teams other than the host nations (which qualify automatically) compete in a qualifying process.\nThe Republic of Ireland have participated in three European Championship finals, those held in 1988, 2012 and 2016.\nThe side have played ten matches: winning two, drawing two and losing six. They have scored six goals and conceded sixteen. In 2012, they equalled the worst performance by a team in European Championship history. They finished bottom of their group and were the first team eliminated from the tournament following a 4–0 defeat to Spain in their second game. In 2016, the nation reached the second round for the first time, following a 1–0 group stage victory against Italy.\nOverall record\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!colspan=9|UEFA European Championship record\n!width=1% rowspan=39|\n!colspan=7|Qualification record\n|-\n!Year\n!Round\n!Position\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n| 1960\n|rowspan=7 colspan=8|Did not qualify\n|2\n|1\n|0\n|1\n|2\n|4\n|Preliminary round\n|-\n| 1964\n|6\n|2\n|2\n|2\n|9\n|12\n|Quarter-finals\n|-\n| 1968\n|6\n|2\n|1\n|3\n|5\n|8\n|3/4\n|-\n| 1972\n|6\n|0\n|1\n|5\n|3\n|17\n|4/4\n|-\n| 1976\n|6\n|3\n|1\n|2\n|11\n|5\n|2/4\n|-\n| 1980\n|8\n|2\n|3\n|3\n|9\n|8\n|3/5\n|-\n| 1984\n|8\n|4\n|1\n|3\n|20\n|10\n|3/5\n|-\n| 1988\n|Group stage\n|5th\n|3\n|1\n|1\n|1\n|2\n|2\n|8\n|4\n|3\n|1\n|10\n|5\n|1/5\n|-\n| 1992\n|rowspan=5 colspan=8|Did not qualify\n|6\n|2\n|4\n|0\n|13\n|6\n|2/4\n|-\n| 1996\n|11\n|5\n|2\n|4\n|17\n|13\n|2/6; Lost Play-off\n|-\n|  2000\n|10\n|5\n|3\n|2\n|15\n|7\n|2/5; Lost Play-off\n|-\n| 2004\n|8\n|3\n|2\n|3\n|10\n|11\n|3/5\n|-\n|  2008\n|12\n|4\n|5\n|3\n|17\n|14\n|3/7\n|-\n|  2012\n|Group stage\n|16th\n|3\n|0\n|0\n|3\n|1\n|9\n|12\n|7\n|4\n|1\n|20\n|8\n|2/6; Won Play-off\n|-\n| 2016\n|Round of 16\n|15th\n|4\n|1\n|1\n|2\n|3\n|6\n|12\n|6\n|4\n|2\n|22\n|8\n|3/6; Won Play-off\n|-\n| 2020\n|rowspan=2 colspan=8|Did not qualify\n|11\n|3\n|5\n|1\n|7\n|5\n|3/5; Lost Play-off\n|-\n| 2024\n|8\n|2\n|0\n|6\n|9\n|10\n|4/5\n|-\n|style=\"border: 3px solid red\"|  2028\n|colspan=8 rowspan=2|To be determined\n|colspan=8 rowspan=2|To be determined''\n|-\n|  2032\n|-\n!Total\n!Round of 16\n!3/17\n!10\n!2\n!2\n!6\n!6\n!17\n!138\n!55\n!41\n!42\n!199\n!151\n!—\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align: center;font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=5| List of UEFA European Championship matches\n|-\n!Year!!Round!!Score!!Result!!Republic of Ireland scorers\n|-\n|rowspan=3| 1988\n|rowspan=3| Group stage || align=\"left\"|  1–0  || bgcolor=\"#98FB98\" | Win || Ray Houghton\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  1–1  || bgcolor=\"#FFFF99\" | Draw || Ronnie Whelan\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  0–1  || bgcolor=\"#FFA07A\" | Loss || —\n|-\n|rowspan=3| 2012\n|rowspan=3| Group stage || align=\"left\"|  1–3  || bgcolor=\"#FFA07A\" | Loss || Sean St Ledger\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  4–0  || bgcolor=\"#FFA07A\" | Loss || —\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  2–0  || bgcolor=\"#FFA07A\" | Loss || —\n|-\n|rowspan=4| 2016\n|rowspan=3| Group stage || align=\"left\"|  1–1  || bgcolor=\"#FFFF99\" | Draw || Wes Hoolahan\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  3–0  || bgcolor=\"#FFA07A\" | Loss || —\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  0–1  || bgcolor=\"#98FB98\" | Win || Robbie Brady\n|-\n|Round of 16 || align=\"left\"|  2–1  || bgcolor=\"#FFA07A\" | Loss || Robbie Brady\n|}\nEuro 1988\nQualification\nIreland qualified for the finals after winning Group 7 of the qualifying tournament.
