Sponsored by the monthly classical arts magazine Limelight, they were the only publicly voted awards of their kind in Australia. In 2012 the awards attracted more than 4,500 votes.\nThe Limelight Award winners were voted on from a shortlist of entries selected by an expert panel of Limelight critics and ABC Classic FM staff over ten categories. These categories included Music Personality of the Year, Best Newcomer and Best Orchestral, Chamber and Solo performances. From this shortlist the public were then invited to select and vote for their favourite musicians. The Limelight Awards were unique, being the only classical music awards in Australia where the public are invited to help recognise well-loved musicians.\nAward winners\n2007\n*Music Personality of the year: Jonathon Welch (choirmaster, The Choir of Hard Knocks)\n*Best Classical Crossover Artist: Il Divo\n*Best Orchestral Concert: Piers Lane (piano) with the Queensland Orchestra/Pietari Inkinen, Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 5 ‘Emperor’\n*Best Chamber music concert: Australian Chamber Orchestra/Patricia Kopatchinskaja: Hope\n*Best Solo performance: Håkan Hardenberger, trumpet\n*Best World music achievement: Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu\n*Best Classical recording: Sara Macliver/Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra/Sebastian Lang-Lessing, Mozart: Arias (ABC Classics)\n*Best World Music Achievement: Joseph Tawadros & James Tawadros, Ben Rogers, Epiphany\n*Best Jazz achievement: Phil Slater Quartet;
