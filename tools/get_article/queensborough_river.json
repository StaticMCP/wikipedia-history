The river flows generally north northwest and north northeast, joined by one minor tributary, before joining with the Bendoc River to form the Little Plains River approximately  south southwest of Craigie, north of the Black-Allan Line that forms part of the border between Victoria and New South Wales. The river descends  over its  course.\nSee also\n}}\n* List of rivers of New South Wales (L–Z)\n* List of rivers of Australia\n* Rivers of New South Wales\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
