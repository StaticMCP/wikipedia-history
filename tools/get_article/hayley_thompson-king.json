In addition to her solo work, she was the songwriter and front-woman of the band Banditas (2009-2012) and the vocalist for the band Major Stars (2011-2016). A trained opera singer, Thompson-King's music incorporates experimental, Americana, rock, and classical elements.  AmericanaUK has described the singer as \"a voice that can do anything, doing just what it wants,\" and PopMatters has praised her work as \"an explosive display of vocal prowess.\"\nThompson-King released her first album, Save The Rats, in 2012 on her own label Hard To Kill Records.

Psychotic Melancholia reached #55 on the Americana Radio Albums Chart and #35 on the Roots Music Report's Top 50 Rock Song Chart.  Paste called the record \" a positively jaw-dropping exposition that celebrates the entire canon of rock ‘n’ roll’s energy, and should be considered an upping of the ante on the gritty sonic real estate of garage, punk, country, and Americana\"\nThompson-King's most recent album, Sororicide (Hard To Kill Records) was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but finally released on October 2, 2020.  The album was produced by Sean Slade and engineered by Benny Grotto.\nEarly life\nThompson-King grew up in Sebastian, Florida, where her father was a horse trainer.
