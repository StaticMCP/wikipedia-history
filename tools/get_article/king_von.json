He was considered a preeminent figure in the drill genre of music, a subcategory of hip-hop.\nBennett gained recognition for his storytelling and distinctive lyricism, which often drew from his own experiences, most notably on his 2018 single \"Crazy Story\", and his 2020 single \"Took Her to the O\", both of which received triple platinum certifications by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The latter peaked within the top 50 of the Billboard Hot 100, preceding the release of his debut studio album, ''Welcome to O'Block (2020). The album achieved both critical and commercial success, peaking at number five on the Billboard'' 200 and earning a platinum certification. After signing with Lil Durk's record label, Only the Family, in 2018, Bennett played a key role in the label's growth. This partnership led to the release of the mixtapes Grandson, Vol. 1 (2019), which peaked in the top 50 on the Billboard 200, and Levon James (2020), which reached the top 40, further solidifying his presence in the rap industry before the release of his debut studio album.\nOn November 6, 2020, Bennett was fatally shot in Atlanta, Georgia, at the age of 26, following an altercation outside a hookah lounge. After his death, his legacy continued posthumously with the release of What It Means to Be King in 2022, which debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 as well as Grandson in 2023, which would be his final album. His contributions to the genre remain influential.\nEarly life\nDayvon Daquan Bennett was born on August 9, 1994, in Chicago, Illinois. He had six half-siblings from his father, Walter E. Bennett, and three siblings from his mother, Taesha. He was raised mostly by his mother in the Parkway Garden Homes, an area more commonly known as \"O'Block\", located on Chicago's South Side within the Greater Grand Crossing community area. His relationship with his father was inconsistent due to his father's incarcerations. When Von was 11 years old, his father was killed by an unseen gunman. Von later paid tribute to his father in multiple songs.\nBennett was present for the birth of drill music through his association with Chief Keef and Lil Durk. However, he was frequently incarcerated throughout the 2010s for a multitude of serious criminal charges, which made him known in Chicago's drill scene even before he began recording music.\nAt age 16, Bennett went to juvenile detention for armed robbery in January 2011. While incarcerated, Bennett earned his GED. After being released, Bennett attended a few classes at South Suburban College in South Holland, Illinois, before dropping out.\nIn July 2014, Bennett was charged with one count of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder in connection with a shooting that killed one and injured two others. After being detained in Cook County jail for over three years, he was acquitted in December 2017 and began his musical career.\nCareer\n2017–2019: Career beginnings and Grandson, Vol. 1\nUpon Von's release from jail in December 2017, fellow rapper Lil Durk signed Von to Durk's Only the Family label. Von then released a series of singles. The first of these singles was \"Beat Dat Body\", which featured fellow late Chicago rapper THF Zoo, and was released on June 17, 2018. Von subsequently appeared on the Lil Durk Presents: Only The Family Involved album, which was released on July 31, 2018. He featured on the song \"Problems\", which had an accompanying music video released on August 9, 2018. Von then released the single \"War With Us\" on October 18, 2018. Von's single \"Crazy Story\" was released on December 6, 2018. It became his breakout single, reaching number 81 on Billboard Hot 100.\nOn January 9, 2019, Von was featured on the remix of \"Exposing Me\", a song by fellow Chicago rapper Memo600. Von and Memo600 swapped bars disrespecting and detailing real life feuds and altercations against other nearby neighborhood rivals. A response from the targets arose when rappers FBG Duck and Rooga dropped their own remix of the song on February 4, 2019. Both songs were produced off the sampling of original Indian song Sanam Re. Following the success, a series of remixes for the song were made by other artists both in the United States and in Europe.\nOn February 14, 2019, Von's then-girlfriend, rapper Asian Doll, released a music video for her track about him, \"Grandson\", in which he appeared.\nIn May 2019, \"Crazy Story 2.0\" featuring Lil Durk was released, and a music video was later released on May 20, 2019; the song peaked at number four on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart.

Von has also received critical praise for his sense of focus, delivery, wordplay, and sharp songwriting. Mark Braboy of Complex described Von as a thoughtful, skillful lyricist who surpassed other Chicago drill artists in the ferocity and resonance of his delivery.\nJayson Buford from Tablet observed that Von remained culturally relevant years after his death; Buford attributed the phenomenon both to Von's proximity to violence and to his extraordinary lyrical skills. Will Schube of NPR identified the characteristic feature of Von's style as his ability to craft vivid narratives that balance nihilism, humor, and empathy; Schube identified \"Took Her to the O\" as one of the style's strongest representations.\nStorytelling\nKing Von was known for the use of storytelling in his songs and his aggressive style, with songs such as \"Crazy Story\" and \"Took Her to the O\" for examples. His narration has also been defined by HotNewHipHop as \"impeccable\" and equipped \"with a vengeance and uncut authenticity\"; it has also been described as \"vivid\". Pitchfork eulogizes his ability to tell a coherent story as its narrator with associated dialogue insertion in his verses. Von maximized his storytelling strengths across a trio of critically acclaimed efforts, Grandson, Vol. 1, Levon James, and ''Welcome to O'Block'', with each project showcasing the full complexities of his personality, as Von fleshed out narratives that are rarely seen in mainstream rap.\nBennett's narrative technique often drew from his lived experiences; and has also been compared to that of other various artists such as the prime Ice-T, the late Speaker Knockerz and specifically songs like \"Took Her to the O\" and \"Crazy Story\" have been compared to \"Children's Story\" by Slick Rick; while Bennett himself says that he has often been compared with Meek Mill's narrative technique.\nVon's storytelling style and ability was inspired by his childhood in Englewood and peculiarly draws on urban novels he read while incarcerated: he asserted that he read many books by Sister Souljah, he liked also JaQuavis and Ashley especially the book \"The Cartel\", \"The Ultimate Sacrifice\" by Anthony Fields plus he also appreciated the \"Twilight\" novels.\nInfluences\nKing Von has cited several MCs as influencing his rapping style, deriving by the artists he listened to in his teens, with rappers such as Lil Wayne, Gucci Mane and Waka Flocka Flame, and by other Chicago rappers such as Twista, Kanye West, G Herbo, Lil Bibby, and Lil Durk.\nPersonal life\nBennett was in an on-and-off relationship with Texas rapper Asian Doll, but the two were reportedly not in a relationship at the time of his death. Bennett had three children.\nHis cousin, Calboy, is also a drill rapper.\nLegal issues\nIn April 2014, Bennett was questioned by police as a person of interest in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Gangster Disciples member Gakirah \"K.I.\" Barnes, but the police were unable to charge him due to inconsistencies in witness statements. In 2021, unsealed documents released by the Chicago Police Department named Bennett as Barnes' killer.\nOn July 24, 2014, Bennett was arrested in connection with a shooting in May 2014, resulting in the death of Malcolm Stuckey and the injury of two other men. Bennett was charged with one count of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder. The shooting took place in Englewood, Chicago. Bennett was found not guilty in December 2017.\nIn May 2019, Bennett and Lil Durk were arrested in connection with a shooting in Atlanta. Bennett and his co-defendant Durk appeared before a judge in a Fulton County courtroom for a probable cause hearing. Prosecutors claimed that the two rappers robbed and shot Alexander Witherspoon outside a popular drive-in on February 5, 2019. After weeks in jail, Durk was released on a $250,000 bond, while Von was released on a $300,000 bond. The charges against Durk were dropped in October 2022.\nIn January 2023, after Bennett's death, the FBI declassified a number of documents showing that a confidential informant alleged that Bennett initially placed a $50K hit on Carlton \"FBG Duck\" Weekly before raising the price to $100,000. Weekly was murdered in the Gold Coast area of Chicago in August 2020. Five O Block members were later arrested and found guilty of this murder.\nOn October 9, 2024, it was reported that Bennett's estate, along with both Durk and OTF Records, were named in a wrongful death lawsuit by the estate and family of Weekly. The lawsuit and its attorneys claimed that Durk and his OTF Records imprint, of which Bennett was a signee, were \"profiting off of Weekly's death through negligence and misconduct\".\nDeath\nOn November 6, 2020, at around 2:15 am, Bennett and his crew were involved in an altercation with Quando Rondo's crew outside of the Monaco Hookah Lounge in Atlanta, Georgia. The dispute quickly escalated into gunfire, and Bennett was shot multiple times. He was transported to a hospital in critical condition and died there later that day. He was 26 years old.\nThe Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported that two people were killed and six wounded. One of the wounded men, while being treated for a gunshot wound, was placed in police custody for Bennett's murder. The suspect was identified as 22-year-old Timothy \"Lul Timm\" Leeks, a rapper affiliated with Quando Rondo. In August 2023, charges were dropped against Leeks under Georgia's \"stand-your-ground\" law.\nOn November 14, 2020, Bennett was buried at Burr Oak Cemetery in Alsip, Cook County, Illinois.\nIn October 2024, Chicago rapper and Bennett's close friend Lil Durk, was arrested near Miami International Airport on federal charges, including conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, the charges allege that Banks orchestrated a plot targeting rapper Quando Rondo, purportedly in retaliation for the 2020 killing of Bennett,  resulting in the death of Quando Rondo's cousin, Saviay'a \"Lul Pab\" Robinson.\nFive members of Durk's collective, Only the Family (OTF), were also arrested in connection with this case.\nRemembrance\nDuring the 64th Annual Grammy Awards, Bennett was included in the In Memoriam montage.\nIn August 2021, a mural depicting King Von was painted by artist Chris Devins on a large wall overlooking Martin Luther King Drive in the Parkway Gardens complex, where Von was raised; the work was commissioned by Delilah Martinez, an art gallery owner and founder of the Mural Movement, self-described as \"a creative response to the murder of George Floyd.\" Bennett was depicted with a backward baseball cap and wearing a silver \"O'Block\" chain. The mural attracted controversy among Chicago residents, with some arguing it glorified gang violence and would attract gang-related crime to the area. Eventually, some three years after it appeared, on November 29, 2024, the mural was removed from Parkway Gardens.\nDiscography\n* ''Welcome to O'Block (2020)\n* What It Means to Be King (2022)\n* Grandson'' (2023)\nSee also\n* List of murdered hip-hop musicians\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
