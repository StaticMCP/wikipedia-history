He was the 5th chief justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court; he was initially appointed by Democratic governor William Robert Taylor in 1874 and retained office until his death in 1880.  Ryan was a leading Democrat in Wisconsin during his era, and was the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in 1863.  Prior to his appointment to the Supreme Court, Ryan was city attorney of Milwaukee for four years.\nEarlier in his career, Ryan participated in several noteworthy cases as an attorney. He served as prosecutor for the U.S. government in the fugitive slave cases against abolitionist Sherman Booth in the 1850s.  He prosecuted the impeachment against Wisconsin circuit court judge Levi Hubbell in 1853, and also argued the case of Republican gubernatorial candidate Coles Bashford in his lawsuit to overturn the original results of the 1855 Wisconsin gubernatorial election.\nEarly life and career\nBorn in County Meath, Ireland, Ryan emigrated to the United&nbsp;States in 1830, originally settling in New York City. In 1836, Ryan became a United&nbsp;States citizen and was admitted to the New York bar. He then moved to Chicago, Illinois, where he married his first wife, Mary Graham.  In Chicago, Ryan practiced law, edited a newspaper, and worked as a city attorney.\nIn 1842, he moved north to Racine, in the Wisconsin Territory, and continued his law practice. Ryan was elected to the first Wisconsin Constitutional Convention in 1846, though the constitution produced by that convention was rejected by Wisconsin voters.  Politically, Ryan was a Democrat, and was a delegate for Wisconsin to the 1848 Democratic National Convention, which nominated Lewis Cass.\nHis wife, Mary, died in 1847. The following year, Ryan moved his law practice to Milwaukee.\nLegal career in Wisconsin\nin Madison, Wisconsin.]]\nDuring his years as a lawyer, Ryan was involved in several notable cases in Wisconsin history.\nIn 1853, he was the prosecutor in the impeachment of Wisconsin circuit court judge Levi Hubbell, on charges of corruption.  Hubbell was acquitted by the Wisconsin Senate, though, later in life, he would be forced to resign his role as a U.S. Attorney due to similar corruption charges. Ryan was notoriously bad-tempered, and his prosecution of the case against Hubbell was described as viciously personal, and motivated by personal grievances.\nIn 1854 and 1855, Ryan was the attorney for the United States in the case of Ableman v. Booth, where he prosecuted abolitionist Sherman Booth for assisting a runaway slave in violation of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.  In the Booth case, Ryan was opposed by fellow future-justice, Byron Paine.  Paine prevailed at the Wisconsin Supreme Court, but the decision was later overturned by the Supreme Court of the United States.  Booth would ultimately be pardoned by U.S. President James Buchanan.\nAfter the contested gubernatorial election of 1855, Ryan represented Republican candidate Coles Bashford in his attempt to overturn the apparent victory of incumbent Governor William A. Barstow.  In the case Atty. Gen. ex rel. Bashford v. Barstow, Ryan prevailed and the Wisconsin Supreme Court threw out a number of fraudulent votes, awarding the election to Bashford.\nIn 1870, Ryan was elected City Attorney of Milwaukee, and held that office until his appointment to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.\nIn 1874 Chief Justice Luther S. Dixon resigned from the Wisconsin Supreme Court.  Governor William Robert Taylor appointed Ryan to finish his term.  He was re-elected in 1875 and would remain Chief Justice until his death in 1880.\nFamily and personal life\nRyan's married his first wife, Mary Graham, in December 1842.  They had one child, Hugh, before her death in 1847.\nRyan married his second wife, Caroline Willard, in 1850.  They had seven children together.  But Ryan's quick temper led to problems in the marriage, and she left him in 1872, taking their children with her.\nRyan died at his home in Madison on October 19, 1880, and was buried at Forest Home Cemetery in Milwaukee.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n1880}}\n1880}}"
