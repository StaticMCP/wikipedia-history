On 26 April 1882, he married Penelope Fanny Sholl (1856–1929)the daughter of Robert John Sholl (1819–86) and sister of Robert Frederick Sholl (1848–1909) &ndash; at St George's Cathedral in Perth. They had two sons and two daughters.\nIn February 1880 and October 1884, Scott unsuccessfully contested the Legislative Council's seat of Perth.

In December 1891, he completed his term as mayor and resigned his parliamentary seat, which Thomas Molloy won in a by-election on 12 January 1892. He then served as a member of the Aborigines Protection Board from 1891 until 1897.\nIn 1899, he returned to England and practiced medicine at Clifton, Bristol, for several years. He died at nearby Stoke Bishop on 24 May 1920.\nOne of his sons, Frank Sholl Scott, practised medicine in Cornwall and represented England at rugby union in 1907.
