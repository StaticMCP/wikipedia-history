After its incorporation into the Yemen Arab Republic, there were two major attempts to secede, the Yemeni Civil War of 1994 and the South Yemen insurgency (2009–present).\nThe Southern Transitional Council was created in May 2017. The governor of Aden Aidarus al-Zoubaidi, dismissed from his office on 27 April 2017 by Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, became its leader.\nThe Southern National Assembly, made up of 303 members from every southern province, held its first parliamentary session in Aden on 26 December 2017.\nAmid tensions between the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council and the Saudi-backed Hadi government in Aden, the STC announced on 21 January 2018 that it would overthrow the Yemeni government within a week unless President Hadi sacked his entire cabinet, including Prime Minister Ahmed Obeid bin Daghr for corruption. The STC also declared a state of emergency until its demands were met. The government responded by banning protests in Aden, but the STC organised an anti-government rally for 28 January 2018.\nTimeline\nOutbreak of fighting\nGun battles erupted in Aden on 28 January 2018 when security forces loyal to the Hadi government attempted to prevent pro-STC demonstrators from entering the city. Districts reportedly affected by the fighting included Khormaksar, al-Mansoura, and Dar Sad, with protests taking place in al-Orouth square. Pro-STC forces were reported to have seized a number of government offices, including the Hadi government's headquarters.\n28 January\nThe STC captured the government headquarters in Aden. The government also ordered its own troops to return to base, following fierce clashes across Aden. The fighting subsided by the evening after Prime Minister Daghr ordered a truce and instructed forces loyal to the government to return to barracks, witnesses said. In the night, the fighting continued.\n29 January\nNew fighting broke out after a brief ceasefire on the day before it collapsed. The STC sent reinforcements from Dhale and Shabwah provinces to Aden. Tank and heavy artillery battles were also fought that day, killing five STC fighters and four Yemeni government soldiers. The Presidential Forces led by Brigadier General Abdullah al-Subaihi began shelling Mount Hadid, which overlooks the 1st brigade for Security Belt Forces and is run by Major General Aidarus al-Zoubaidi. The two sides deployed tanks and began shelling one another in Khormaksar district, where snipers were on the roofs of buildings. The fighting moved into Crater district, and schools were closed for a second consecutive day.\nThe STC would go on to proclaim victory on the 30 January.\n30 January\nOn the 30 January 2018, the STC claimed it had seized the entirety of Aden.\nThe members of the Hadi-government present in Aden, including the Prime Minister, were surrounded in the Presidential Palace and \"de facto under house arrest\" but the STC did not enter the palace. Yemen's prime minister prepared to flee the country for Saudi Arabia after the STC seized the area around the presidential palace in the southern city of Aden in fierce battles overnight.\nThe charity Save the Children suspended humanitarian work in the city due to the fighting.\nThe STC seized the Dar Sad District, which was the last pro-Hadi stronghold, having captured the Crater and Tawahi districts earlier. Residents have said that the STC captured most of the city by day's end.\n31 January\nOn the 31 January, separatists took the office of the prime minister's secretary, but fighting no longer took place. The government and the STC exchanged prisoners after the fighting.\nReactions\nNational\n* – Prime Minister Ahmed Obeid bin Daghr stated that \"a coup is ongoing here in Aden against legitimacy and the country's unity,\" and asked Saudi Arabia for military support.\n* – President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi ordered his forces to cease fire immediately after fierce clashes with southern separatists broke out in Aden.
