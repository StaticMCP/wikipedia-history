It was included as the second track on the band's 1975 album titled Fleetwood Mac and was one of the four songs on the album solely written and sung by Christine McVie. The song was also issued as a single in the United Kingdom.\nBackground\nDuring the making of Tusk album, Buckingham borrowed aspects of his guitar playing on \"Warm Ways\" and repurposed it for \"Over & Over\", another song written by McVie. Buckingham had played slide guitar on \"Warm Ways\", a technique that he seldom utilised. Hernan Rojas, who served as the engineer for Tusk, said that Buckingham was reminded of \"Warm Ways\" when he first heard \"Over & Over\", making these one of the few songs along with \"Never Forget\" that featured Buckingham on slide guitar.\nIn October 1975, \"Warm Ways\" was released as the lead single from Fleetwood Mac in the United Kingdom. It was not released as a single in the United States, where \"Over My Head\" was issued as the first single instead. The single did not chart in Britain, with only the fourth single from the album, \"Say You Love Me\" managing to chart upon its original release. Fleetwood Mac rehearsed the song for their Fleetwood Mac Tour, but they never performed it live.\nCritical reception\nPopMatters wrote that the song \"lives up to its title and then some\", adding that the music possessed a \"wistful\" quality. Writing for NPR, Annie Zaleski noted how McVie stretched out the syllables on a few lyrics found in \"Warm Ways\", which Zaleski said \"illuminate[d] the coziness of sleeping by a beloved.\"\nPersonnel\n*Christine McVie – keyboards, lead vocals\n*Lindsey Buckingham – guitars, harmony vocals\n*Stevie Nicks – harmony vocals\n*John McVie – bass guitar\n*Mick Fleetwood – drums\nReferences"
