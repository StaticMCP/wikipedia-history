The lake is about  long and wide and has an elevation of  above sea level.  The lake was formed from glacial meltwater about 10,000 BCE.\nThe scenic lake is a popular tourist attraction.\nYawarkucha acquired its name as a result of a battle and massacre which allegedly took place here during the conquest of the area by the Inca Empire in the late 15th or early 16th century.  The local chiefdom called the Caranqui fiercely resisted the Inca invasion of their territory.  The Inca Emperor, Huayna Capac (ruled c. 1493–1525) finally achieved victory near the present-day city of Ibarra. According to Spanish chronicler Miguel Cabello de Balboa, Huayna Capac ordered the massacre of the male population of Caranqui in retribution for its resistance.  The massacre of thousands of men took place on the shores of a lake, known thereafter as Yawarkucha or \"Blood Lake.\"\nSee also\n* Autodromo Internacional de Yahuarcocha\n* Inca-Caranqui, archaeological site\nReferences\nExternal links"
