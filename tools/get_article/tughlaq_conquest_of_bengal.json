Led by General Bahram Khan, the imperial forces defeated Bahadur near Lakhnauti, capturing him after a pursuit to Khyaspur. Nasiruddin was installed as the tributary ruler of Lakhnauti, while Satgaon and Sonargaon were placed under Bahram Khan’s control.\nBackground\nAfter suppressing rebellion in Gujarat, Sultan Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq turned his focus to Bengal, which had been independent since Ghiyath al-Din Balban's death. After Sultan Balban's death, his second son, Bughra Khan (), established an independent kingdom in Bengal.\nThe situation in Bengal favored Sultan Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq due to the internal strife among the successors of Shamsuddin Firuz Shah (). Following the death of Bughra Khan’s descendant, Shamsuddin Firuz Shah, in 1322, his four sons named Shihabuddin Bughra Shah, Nasiruddin Ibrahim Shah, Ghiyasuddin Bahadur, and Qutlu Khan vied for power. Ghiyasuddin Bahadur had established himself at Sonargaon before his father’s death. A fratricidal conflict erupted, with Ghiyasuddin Bahadur’s ambition causing widespread chaos. He defeated and expelled Shihabuddin,)}} who had succeeded his father at Lakhnauti in 1319 AD, and killed Qutlu Khan. His next brother, Nasiruddin, who was older than Bahadur, ascended the throne and in 1324 AD.)}}\nAccording to the Riyaz-us-Salatin, Nasiruddin and Shihabuddin sought refuge with Sultan Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq, urging him to help them overthrow their ruthless brother, Ghiyasuddin Bahadur. However, Isami reports that as the Sultan crossed the Gomti River en route to Bengal, Nasiruddin joined him and shared his unsuccessful attempts to convince Ghiyasuddin Bahadur, to accept Delhi’s authority. Barani notes that nobles from Lakhnauti approached the Sultan, complaining about the oppressive rule of Bengal’s leader. In response, Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq decided to personally lead a campaign to Bengal.\nPrelude\nDetermined to reassert control, Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq marched with his army in early 1324, leaving his son Muhammad bin Tughluq in charge of Delhi's government. According to some sources, Muhammad was recalled from Telangana specifically for this role in January 1324. Sultan Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq left Delhi and marched eastward in the beginning of January 1324 AD. Arriving near Tirhut, Nasiruddin and some rais and zamindars of that region paid homage to him and explained the attitude of his brother Ghiyasuddin Bahadur Shah to the sultan. Nasir offered to capture Bahadur for Sultan Ghiyasuddin Tughluq if he were given an army.\nThe sultan sent his trusted general Bahram Khan, leading a select group of troops alongside Zulchi and Nasiruddin from Tirhut to march on Lakhnauti. The imperial army advanced cautiously and in disciplined formation, positioning Nasiruddin on the left flank of the center. Bahadur Shah was then at Ghyaspur,}} a city which he founded. Nasiruddin’s activities in Lakhnauti and rumors of the approaching imperial army prompted Bahadur Shah to return to Lakhnauti.\nBattle of Lakhnauti\nBahram Khan, advanced with the imperial army to the vicinity of Lakhnauti. In response, Bahadur Shah, came out from the city with his forces to engage in battle. The opposing armies clashed near Lakhnauti. Both left and the right wing of the two armies clashes with each other. Bahadur launched an attack on Nasiruddin and Zulchi the commander of the imperial center. The assault was repelled, and Bahadur’s forces, thrown into disarray, retreated. Faced with no viable option but retreat, Ghiyasuddin Bahadur withdrew some distance. The imperial forces, with swords drawn, launched a fierce charge, inflicting heavy casualties and sowing terror among Bahadur’s ranks.\nDuring his retreat, Bahadur, struck by the memory of his cherished concubine left behind in his abandoned camp, hastily returned to retrieve her before resuming his escape.\nGhiyasuddin Bahadur Shah retreated overland toward Banga, as per Isami’s account. Bahram Khan dispatched a detachment led by Haibatullah Khan Qasuri in pursuit. Bahadur’s Lakhnauti army, heading toward Khyaspur, crossed several hill ridges. After crossing several hills, he reached a riverbank and became trapped in a quagmire. There, he was captured and brought before Bahram Khan as a prisoner.\nAftermath\nFollowing their triumph, the army returned to the imperial camp, delivering their captives into the Sultan's presence. Ghiyasuddin Bahadur was placed in chains and later taken to Delhi. Thereafter, the rest of Bengal was overrun by the imperial army. Sultan Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq stayed on a month or two in Bengal to gather the spoils of war. Nasiruddin was confirmed as the tributary ruler of Northern Bengal with its capital at Lakhnauti, while Eastern and Southern Bengal, with capitals respectively at Sonargaon and Satgaon, were annexed to the Sultanate, and entrusted to his adopted son Bahram Khan to govern them.\nSultan Nasiruddin Ibrahim, remained a loyal vassal of Delhi, issued coins from the Lakhnauti mint bearing his name alongside Sultan Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq’s. This practice of joint coinage likely continued under Tughluq’s successor. After his death in 1328, Lakhnauti also came under Bahram Khan's authority.\nIn 1325 Ghiyas-ud-din Tughlaq's successor Muhammad bin Tughlaq (), released Ghiyasuddin Bahadur and appointed vassal king of Sonargaon, with Bahram assigned as the emperor’s representative to oversee its administration. Following Bahadur Shah’s revolt in 1328, Tatar Khan defeated him, took him captive, and executed him. Muhammad bin Tughlaq also appointed Malik Pindar (or Bedar) Khilji under Nasiruddin Ibrahim, titled Qadar Khan, as the feudatory of Lakhnauti, while Izzuddin Yahya, with the title Azam Malik, as the feudatory of Satgaon.\nRegarding the political situation of Bengal's governance K. R. Qinungo writes,\n: \"The three well-defined regions of Bengal, Lakhnawati, Satgānw and Sonargānw, were governed by Qadar Khan, Malik Izzuddin Yahaya, and Bahram Khan alias Tätär Khan respectively, without any internal dissension or any attempt at rebellion against the authority of Sultan Muhammad Tughluq for about ten years more after the suppression of the last rebellion of Bahadur Shah.\"\nBahram Khan died in 1337 AD. In 1338, Bahram's armour-bearer upon his master’s death assumed in Sonargaon the royal title of Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah () and reigned till his death in 1349. In the same year, Izzuddin Yahya, governor of Satgaon died enabling Mubarak's foster brother Haji Ilyas to became independent at Satgaon. In 1339/1340, Qadar Khan died at Lakhnauti, and the muster-master of his forces proclaimed himself as king of Western Bengal under the title of Alauddin Ali Shah (). He moved his capital from Lakhnauti to Pandua. Alauddin Ali Shah succeeded his son Ikhtiyaruddin Ghazi Shah ().\nHaji Ilyas waged war against Alauddin Ali Shah conquering his domain including Lakhnauti in 1342. He assumed the title of Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah. In 1352, he conquered Sonargaon defeating Ikhtiyaruddin Ghazi Shah and became the master of the whole of Bengal. He unified the three fractured provinces therefore established the independent Sultanate of Bengal under Ilyas Shahi dynasty.\nSee also\n* Ekdala Wars\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
