It received 0.4% of the vote, winning three seats: U.C.K. Taikwell in Falam 1, Za Hlei Thang in Falam 2 and U Shein Pe Ling in Mindat.\nThe party was banned by the military government on 18 March 1992, but was a member of the government-in-exile.\nThe party did not contest the 2010 general elections.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
