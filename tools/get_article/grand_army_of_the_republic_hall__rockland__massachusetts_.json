The hall was designed by local builder William Harrison Hebberd, and built in 1899 by members of the GAR as a memorial to the Union Army veterans of the Civil War.  It is a somewhat plainly decorated two-story wood-frame building with a hip roof.  Its most elaborate exterior feature is the main entry, a porch supported by clusters of narrow columns, and with brackets in its eaves.  The interior is more elaborately decorated, and has retained most of its original Queen Anne details.\nOn May 16, 1997, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\nMeetings\nThe hall was the meeting place of the Gen. George L. Hartsuff GAR Post No. 74, which was one of 210 post in the Department of Massachusetts.  It is now the meeting place of the Gen. George L. Hartsuff Camp No. 50 of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War, the successor organization to the Grand Army of the Republic.\nSee also\n* Grand Army of the Republic Hall (disambiguation)\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Plymouth County, Massachusetts\n* Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.rocklandgarhall.freeservers.com/  Hartsuff Post 74 Grand Army of the Republic Hall]\n* [https://www.loc.gov/rr/main/gar/garhome.html Library of Congress list of GAR posts by state]"
