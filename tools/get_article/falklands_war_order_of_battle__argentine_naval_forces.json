For a list of naval forces from the United Kingdom, see Falklands War order of battle: British naval forces.\nBackground\nThe Argentine Navy (ARA), particularly its commander-in-chief and Junta member, Admiral Jorge Anaya, was the main architect and supporter of a military solution to resolve the long-standing claim of sovereignty over the islands. By 1982 the country was already in the midst of a devastating economic crisis and large-scale civil unrest against the repressive government and Anaya, now a member of the ruling Junta, ordered Operation Rosario to be brought forward to 2 April, after a group of Argentina military infiltrated a group of Argentine scrap metal merchants and raised the Argentine flag at South Georgia 19 March.\nGeneral Galtieri, acting president, agreed in his intention to mount a quick, symbolic occupation, followed rapidly by a withdrawal, leaving only a small garrison to support the new military governor and force the UK to begin talks on the long-delayed sovereignty claim.  On 2 April an amphibious landing was made at Stanley and on 3 April Argentine marines used helicopters to take over the Georgias.  Whilst the military junta was redeploying the assault units back to their home bases they found the British responded with a large-scale mobilisation to organise a naval task force and ground forces to retake the islands by force.\nThe war could not have happened at a worse time for the Argentines. They were expecting new destroyers, frigates and submarines being built in West Germany and their shipment of French Super Étendards and Exocets were not yet complete.\nArgentine Navy\nOperation Rosario (2 April)\n:Vice Admiral Juan José Lombardo\nTask Group 20\n:Commander José Sarcona (covering force)\n:* ARA Veinticinco de Mayo – a\n:*  – a\n:* ARA Comodoro Seguí – an\n:* ARA Hipólito Bouchard – an Allen M.

This claim was subsequently dropped when the British evaluated wartime reports after the campaign.
