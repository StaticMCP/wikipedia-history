The apparition of the myth of \"Grandfather Ivan\" is associated with the marriage of Ivan III to the niece of the last Byzantine emperor, Sophia Palaiologina, in 1472. Through this marriage, Ivan III was formally entitled to ascend to the throne of the already nonexisting Byzantine Empire and also received the moral obligation to liberate the Balkan Orthodox peoples from the Ottoman invaders. \"Grandfather Ivan\" was accepted as an \"old clever patron\". This vision was applied not only to the Tsar but also to the Russian people. Sometime in the 18th century, during the Bulgarian National Awakening, the Bulgarians came to the conclusion that \"Grandfather Ivan\" should come to set them free from the Ottoman rule.\nSee also\n* Moscow, third Rome\n* Russophilia\n* Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)\nReferences"
