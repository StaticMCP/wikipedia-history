It consisted initially of the Special War Policies Unit, the Alien Property Unit, and the Alien Enemy Control Unit. The War Division later included the War Frauds Unit, which originated as the Economic Section of the Antitrust Division.\nWith the end of the war, the War Division was abolished on December 28, 1945.\nReferences"
