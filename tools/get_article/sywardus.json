From Olaus Magnus' [[A Description of the Northern Peoples from 1555.]]\nIn the twelfth-century Danish history Gesta Danorum (The Deeds of the Danes), Siward, (Sywardus), was an ancient king in Götaland, who had a daughter named Alfhild, who became a legendary Viking pirate.\nTo protect his daughter from unworthy suitors, Siward had her chamber guarded by a lizard and a snake. He also said that if any man tried to enter it, and failed, his head was to be taken off and impaled on a stake.\nWhen Alf, a Danish prince, managed to defeat the animal guards, Siward told him that he would only accept \"that man for his daughter's husband, of whom she made a free and decided choice\". At first, Alfhild said no and ran away from home, but, after some adventures with her Viking fleet, she met Alf in a sea combat, and, after losing the battle, decided to marry him.\nSiward also had two sons, Wemund and Osten.\nIn popular culture\nThe name Synardus seems to be a medieval or modern invention. In the original Latin text of Gesta Danorum, it is rendered Siwardus and Sywardus. In Danish, it is Sivard.\nSee also\n* Alf and Alfhild\n* Yngwin\n* Awilda\nReferences\nExternal sources\n* [http://mcllibrary.org/DanishHistory/book7.html Gesta Danorum, book 7.]\n* [http://www2.kb.dk/elib/lit//dan/saxo/lat/or.dsr/7/6/index.htm Gesta Danorum in Latin]\n* [http://smn.dsl.dk/index.php?teksterid=7&side=sider&litteraturbeskrivelse=true&haandskriftid=-1&trykid=-1&tekstid=-1 Another version of Gesta Danorum (in Danish)]"
