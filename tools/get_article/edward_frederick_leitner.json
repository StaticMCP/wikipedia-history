He was killed in Florida during the Seminole Wars after volunteering to be a combat medic.\n| battles      =\n* Second Seminole War\n** First Battle of the Loxahatchee\n}}\n}}\nFrederick Leitner was born in Stuttgart on February 4, 1812 to Johann Friedrich Leitner and Karoline Friedericke Bühler. His father was a gardener in the court of King Frederick I of Württemberg. At the age of four, his family moved to Schorndorf after the death of his father. Following studies of botany at the University of Tübingen, he moved to the United States after receiving a subsidy from the Society of Natural Sciences in Württemberg.\nIn 1831, Leitner began taking classes at the Medical College of South Carolina in Charleston. In 1832, he befriended the famous naturalist John James Audubon while he was visiting Charleston. In 1833, he began to travel to Florida and collect botanical and zoological specimens in the Everglades. During his travels he eventually reached the Florida Keys, during which, he paid a visit to the Dry Tortugas.In 1834, he graduated from medical college with a dissertation on Hippomane mancinella, subsequently working as a lecturer at the South Carolina Medical Society.\nThe Seminole War that began in December 1835 obstructed Leitner's research in Florida, as the region had become a dangerous war zone. Leitner planned to join a U.S. Military unit, as it was the only way he could still travel through Florida and continue his research. In 1836, he traveled to Key West, where he joined Navy officer Levin M. Powell's unit as a guide and surgeon. On 15 January 1838, he was killed by Seminole warriors at the First Battle of the Loxahatchee. It was reported in a newspaper that he was likely targeted by the Seminoles because of his role as a combat medic. His body was never recovered after the battle.\nAt the time of Leitner's death, he was considered one of the world's leading experts on Florida's nature. After his death, 800 of his specimens eventually came into the possession of Jean Louis Cabanis in Germany, however these specimens were completely destroyed during the Bombing of Berlin in 1943. The genus Leitneria is named in his honor, as is the family Leitneriaceae, the latter taxa being circumscribed by George Bentham.\nPublications associated with Leitner\n* \"Edward Frederick Leitner (1812-1838), Physician-botanist\", by George Edmund Gifford (1972).\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://journals.fcla.edu/browardlegacy/article/view/76787/74358 Edward Frederick Leitner (1812-1838), Physician-botanist]  Bulletin of the History of Medicine.
