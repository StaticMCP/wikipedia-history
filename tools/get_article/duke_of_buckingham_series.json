      "text": "# Duke of Buckingham series\n\nThe Duke of Buckingham series is a 1590s cycle of Old and New Testament paintings by Paolo Veronese and his workshop. They were acquired in Venice in 1595 by Charles III de Croÿ, then Duke of Aarschot, and moved to his castle at Beaumont. It was acquired early in the 17th century by George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, hence its title. Most of the series are in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, though two are in the National Gallery in Prague and one in the National Gallery of Art in Washington.\nFile:Lot und seine Töchter fliehen aus Sodom-khm.jpg|Lot and his Family Flee Sodom, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna\nFile:Paolo Veronese - Agar e Ismaele nel deserto (KHM).jpg|The Angel Appears to Hagar in the Desert, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna\nFile:Esther vor Ahasver-khm.jpg|Esther and Ahasuerus, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna\nFile:Veronese, Paolo - Rebecca at the Well - c. 1580.jpg|Rebecca at the Well,  National Gallery of Art, Washington\nFile:Paolo Veronese - Susanna and the Elders - WGA24975.jpg|Susanna and the Elders, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna\nFile:Paolo Veronese - Cristo e la Samaritana (KHM).jpg|The Samaritan Woman, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna\nFile:Christus und die Ehebrecherin-khm.jpg|The Woman Taken in Adultery, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna\nFile:Christus und der Hauptmann von Kafarnaum-khm.jpg|Christ and the Centurion, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna\nFile:Paolo Veronese - Christ Washing the Feet of the Disciples - WGA24846.jpg|''Christ Washing the Disciples' Feet'', National Gallery, Prague\nReferences\ncategory:Paintings of New Testament subjects by Paolo Veronese\ncategory:Paintings of Hagar"
