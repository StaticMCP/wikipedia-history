The paved track is within the harness racing track, temporary grandstands are brought onto the harness racing tracks surface. In 2006, Kawartha Speedway held the final CASCAR Super Series race before it became the NASCAR Canadian Tire Series in 2007. Since 2004, Kawartha was the host of the CASCAR Super Series finale. Kawartha Speedway held the finale of the inaugural NASCAR Canadian Tire Series Season which was won by Scott Steckly. The following year, Jason Hathaway picked up his first ever win, and in 2009 D. J. Kennington won.\nThe facility is also host to a number of other racing venues. After some additional paving of the infield, Kawartha Durham Kart Club made the speedway its home track in 2009. With a variety of track layouts it has proven to be a popular venue within the karting community. The Peterborough Motor Sports Club also hosts solo events as part of the club's championship season, bringing in a wide variety of vehicles from stock to fully modified rally cars. There is also a specially constructed course for soap box cars. The 'Gravity Cavity' is located behind the parking lot and hosts a championship series for soap box enthusiasts.\nSummer Shoot-Out Series\nIn an attempt to raise diminishing car counts all over Southern Ontario, Kawartha Speedway announced a 6 race late model series, split between Kawartha and Capital City Speedway in Stittsville, Ontario. Three events were held at Kawartha and three at the Capital City Speedway. All events were 100 laps with the exception of a July race at Kawartha which was 200 laps, called the ACT Summer Sizzler.\nSee also\n*List of auto racing tracks in Canada\n*Peterborough Speedway\n*Mosport Speedway\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.kawarthadowns.com Kawartha Downs]\n*[http://www.racing-reference.info/tracks/Kawartha_Speedway Kawartha Speedway race results] at Racing-Reference"
