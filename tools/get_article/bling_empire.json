The website's critics consensus reads, \"Bling Empire may be another celebration of lavish wealth, but the focus on an Asian American cast gives this reality program an intriguing layer of cultural celebration.\"\nDiane Gordon of TV Guide thought the television series was more than the \"grotesque opulence\" that it depicted, with compelling characters among the cast, some of whom were exploring their identity.  Eilidh Hargreaves of The Telegraph found the \"epic rivalries\", \"ridiculous\" problems, wild whims, \"self-serving\" philosophy of the main characters to be compulsive viewing and \"deliciously odious to observe\".\nSpin-off\nIn October 2022, Netflix announced a New York City-set spin-off series Bling Empire: New York. It stars Dorothy Wang, who was a cast member in season 2 of the original series, Tina Leung, Deborah Hung, Stephen Hung, and Lynn Ban. The spin-off was released on January 20, 2023.\nSee also\n* Singapore Social\n* House of Ho\n* Dubai Bling\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
