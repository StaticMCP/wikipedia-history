Beginning 23 September, Israel began its airstrikes in Lebanon, on 27 September, they assassinated Hassan Nasrallah, and on 1 October, they invaded Lebanon.\nBrief description of major events during this period:\n* 17 September: Hours after the Security Cabinet of Israel declares that returning the residents of the north of Israel to their homes is a new goal of the war, pagers explode throughout Lebanon and Syria, killing 12 and injuring 2,750. Both militants and civilians among the killed, and injured.\n* 18 September: walkie-talkies explode in the second wave of device explosions. 30 people are killed, with civilians being injured and some potentially killed.\n* 20 September: 20 September 2024 Beirut attack, Hezbollah generals Ibrahim Aqil and Ahmed Wehbe killed, along with at least 29 civilians when an Israeli airstrike destroyed an apartment building.\n* Beginning 23 September: Israel begins hitting targets in Lebanon in multiple airstrikes, killing at least 700 people so far and vowing to continue strikes. Lebanon's foreign minister Abdallah Bou Habib says that nearly 500,000 people have been displaced due to the attacks. Israel has refused calls for de-escalation, such as a 21-day ceasefire plan presented by France and the US, with Benjamin Netanyahu saying the strikes will continue \"with full force\" until the new war aim of returning residents of Israel to the north is met.\n** 23 September: Israel conducted mass airstrikes, a major escalation of the conflict. Residents were given only hours of notice to evacuate. Airstrikes were conducted all over Lebanon but focused on Southern Lebanon with its heavy Hezbollah presence. Roads were jammed with people fleeing, in some cases using both directions of roads to escape, with a road in Sidon having a 10 lane wide traffic jam on both sides of the road for vehicles being used to escape the airstrikes. Many civilians were killed, including 50 children. 23 September was the deadliest day of conflict in Lebanon since the Lebanese Civil War.\n** 27 September: Assassination of Hassan Nasrallah that  targeted multiple buildings including apartment blocks in the densely populated Dahieh suburb of Beirut. The IDF states that the target was the main Hezbollah headquarters, located underneath residential buildings which were destroyed in the attack.

The confirmed death toll is at least six, but an Israeli official estimated the true death toll as \"hundreds\", with the count set to rise in the days following the attack.\n* 1 October: Israel invaded Lebanon. Following the various escalations, a full-scale war was described as \"inevitable\". Following a night of heavy shelling, evacuation warnings and further airstrikes, an invasion was described as \"imminent\".
