She is a professor of physics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\nEducation and career\nVishveshwara is one of two daughters of two Indian physicists, black hole physicist C. V. Vishveshwara and biophysicist Saraswathi Vishveshwara. She was born in 1974 in the US, in Pittsburgh, but her parents brought her back to India as an infant. After education in India in the school of philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti, she returned to the US for her higher education, and majored in physics as an undergraduate at Cornell University, with Carl Franck and N. David Mermin as faculty mentors, graduating magna cum laude in 1996. Next, she went to the University of California, Santa Barbara for graduate study with Matthew P. A. Fisher, completing her Ph.D. in 2002. Her dissertation was A Three-Act Play of Strongly Correlated Electrons.\nAfter completing her doctorate, she became a postdoctoraler research at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, working with Paul Goldbart and Tony Leggett. In 2005, she obtained a tenure-track faculty position, allowing her to remain at the University of Illinois. As well as her primary appointment in the physics department, she also holds affiliations with the Illinois Materials Research Laboratory and Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology.\nRecognition\nVishveshwara was named a Fellow of the American Physical Society (APS) in 2019, after a nomination from the APS Division of Condensed Matter Physics, \"for pioneering theory of quantum dynamics in nonequilibrium systems and novel phenomena in cold Bose gases\".\nReferences\n}}\n}}\nExternal links\n*[https://physics.illinois.edu/people/loomis_confessions/vishveshwara The Loomis Confessions: Smitha Vishveshwara], interview with Vishveshwara"
