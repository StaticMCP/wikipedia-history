Both schools, founded together in 1910, are located in northern Ohio, with Bowling Green in Northwest Ohio and Kent State in Northeast Ohio. The series between the two began in 1920, the first year Kent State fielded a football team, while the trophy was introduced in 1985.\nHistory\nThe Anniversary Award was created by each of the schools' alumni departments and commemorates the founding of both institutions, which occurred in 1910 as a result of the Lowry Bill. The award was first given out in 1985 to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of each school. The rivalry has overall been lop-sided, with Bowling Green winning 27 of the 40 meetings.\nGame results\n| team2 = Kent State\n| team2style =\n| November 6, 1920 | Kent, OH | Bowling Green | 7 | Kent
