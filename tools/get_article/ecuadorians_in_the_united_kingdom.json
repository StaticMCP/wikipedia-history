They can be either British citizens or non-citizen immigrants.\nDemographics\nPopulation and distribution\nThe 2001 Census recorded 3,035 Ecuadorian-born people living in the UK. More recent estimates of the size of the Ecuadorian population in the UK vary. In 2006, The Independent newspaper put the figure at around 10,000. Several other sources estimate the population including British-born people of Ecuadorian origin to be higher. NGO representatives and community members believe it is in the range of 30,000 to 75,000, whilst the Ecuadorian Consulate in London states around 70,000. Latin American author Sofia Buchuck estimates between 70,000 and 90,000. However, Ecuadorians do not feature in Office for National Statistics estimates for the top 60 foreign countries of birth in 2008, meaning that there are fewer than 20,000 Ecuadorian-born people resident in the UK.\nThe overwhelming majority of Ecuadorians in the UK can be found in London, with the Ecuadorian Consulate estimating that 80 to 90 per cent live in the capital. Lambeth, Southwark, Newham and Haringey are the most populous boroughs within Greater London.\nEthnicity and religion\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" align=right\n|-\n!\n!
