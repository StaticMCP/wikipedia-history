It was founded in 2002 in Toronto, Ontario, by Mark Krupnik, Ph.D., who has published multiple papers in the field of applied mathematics and Joseph Sheinis, Ph.D, inventor who holds two patents in software engineering - particularily in the areas of application internationalization and component interception logic.\nIn its early years, Retalon developed a unified analytics platform designed to handle multiple aspects of retail operations (such as inventory, pricing, and planning) on a single predictive engine.\nRetalon's research and development of retail AI tools have had an impact on the retail industry by providing insights and commercial applications, as discussed in the Artificial Intelligence in Business section of the Handbook of Artificial Intelligence Applications For Industrial Sustainability, by Princi Gupta and Nisha Singh.Gupta, P., & Singh, N. (2024). Artificial Intelligence tools for reshaping e-business and trade. In V. Garg, R. Goel, P. Tiwari, & E. S. Döngül (Eds.), *Handbook of artificial intelligence applications for industrial sustainability: Concepts and practical examples* (1st ed., pp. 25). CRC Press. https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003348351..\nBy the 2010s, the company's products were adopted by several North American retailers.\nIn 2014, Retalon announced that Shane Co., a U.S.-based jewelry retailer in 2013, implemented Retalon's analytics to optimize inventory and assortment planning.\nAnother early client was Follett Corporation (an educational materials retailer), which used Retalon's tools to streamline product planning processes.\nToday, Retalon remains a privately held company focused on retail analytics driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). It expanded its client base internationally, serving retailers in North America, Europe, and the. In 2020, the Canadian fashion retailer La Maison Simons deployed Retalon's AI-based forecasting and inventory optimisation software to manage its extensive product assortment. Simons credited Retalon with enabling a more granular, data-driven approach to inventory and promotions, and with improving decision-making as the retailer grew its e-commerce operations.\nProducts and Technology\nRetalon's core offering is a suite of retail analytics software built on a unified platform that uses AI and predictive analytics to optimize retail operations. The platform encompasses end-to-end merchandise planning, demand forecasting, inventory management, pricing, promotions, and markdown optimization.\nRetalon's technology was developed to address the insufficiency of the solutions that addressed a single aspect of retail, such as pricing or inventory, in isolation. Retalon approached the issue by integrating data from across the entire retail process. Today, all of its analytics modules operate on a common platform, which can integrate with retailers' existing enterprise systems (ERP platforms), increasing consistency and accuracy in forecasting and resulting sales performance.\nAccording to an article by Dan Berthiaume,\"After integrating the Retalon system into its enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, Hard Rock has been able to increase and consistently maintain in-stock percentage to 97%, and they expect to get up to very close to 100% across all retail locations globally. Rock Shop stores are now able to trust with 99.9% certainty their new demand forecasts.\"\nArtificial Intelligence\nThe company was an early pioneer in applying AI and predictive analytics to retail planning and has been active in research and development of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) innovation and technology.\nRetalon has been actively involved in both academic and applied research in fields such as mathematics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The company's founder and CEO, Mark Krupnik, holds a PhD in applied mathematics and began his career as a researcher in linear algebra and operator theory.\nIn the 1990s, he co-authored several papers in mathematical journals—for example, he and Nahum Krupnik (his father, a mathematician) collaborated on a 1996 study titled \"A simple proof of the classification of normal Toeplitz matrices,\" published in the SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications.\nNahum Krupnik has remained active in academia while affiliated with the company, and Retalon has provided financial support for his research. Notably, a survey on one-dimensional singular integral operators authored by Nahum Krupnik, published in the conference proceedings Topics in Operator Theory: Volume 1. Operators, Matrices and Analytic Functions, acknowledges that \"the work was partially supported by Retalon Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada.\"Similarly, other peer-reviewed papers in mathematics have credited Retalon's support.\nMachine Learning\nIn 2021, Retalon announced a new neural network training methodology called \"Progressive Learning,\" which allows AI models to learn in stages by first training on the most reliable data and gradually incorporating noisier\nThis approach was designed to improve the robustness of deep learning models for retail decision-making, helping to automatically detect anomalies in data and reduce the need for manual intervention in the model training process.\nPartnerships\nRetalon has formed several partnerships to expand its market reach and integrate its technology with larger platforms.\nMicrosoft\nIn 2022, Retalon became an official Microsoft partner. Through their participation with Microsoft Dynamics 365. Retalon's AI and analytics solutions can be deplyed as an add-on to Microsoft Dynamic 365 through. Retalon was among the first to participate in Microsofts' role out of Dynamics, becoming an early partner of the program in January 2013.\nThinkMax\nRetalon also partnered with the Canadian IT consulting company  [https://www.thinkmax.com/en/ Thinkmax] in October 2022,. This alliance was aimed at accelerating digital transformation for retail clients by leveraging Thinkmax's implementation services alongside Retalon's analytics software.\nTech Mahindra\nIn January 2023, Tech Mahindra, a global IT services and consulting firm, announced a strategic partnership with Retalon. The partnership was geared towards providing \"full spectrum\" digital solutions for the retail and consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry. Tech Mahindra characterized Retalon as a leader in retail AI and predictive analytics, and the two companies agreed to jointly offer a unified analytics platform for retailers and CPG companies worldwide.\nThe collaboration combines Tech Mahindra's expertise in systems integration and digital transformation with Retalon's analytics tools to help retail clients improve customer insights, decision-making, and operational efficiency. For example, the joint solution was promoted as enabling smarter inventory and fulfillment decisions and potentially improving gross profit margins for retailers by an estimated 9–12% annually.\nRecognition and Awards\nRetalon's technology and market presence have been noted by independent industry analysts and publications, which has helped establish the company's notability in the retail technology sector.\nGartner, a leading technology research firm, has included Retalon in several of its industry reports. In 2021, Retalon was listed as a \"Representative Vendor\" in ''Gartner's Market Guide for Retail Forecasting and Replenishment Solutions\nIn 2022, Retalon received an industry award from [https://retail-today.com/ Retail Today] magazine. The company was selected as a winner in two categories in the \"Retail CIO Radar 2022\" list: Supply Chain and Merchandising technology.\nReferences\n:Category:Predictive analytics\n:Category:Artificial intelligence\n:Category:Software\n:Category:Retailing"
