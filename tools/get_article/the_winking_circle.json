They create tall bikes, art cars and other community art programs.\nTheir work is documented in the short movie The Winking Circle Video Zine. In early 2005, Coca-Cola produced an advertisement clearly derivative of The Winking Circle's work.\nThey live by the Wisdom of the 3 Beans: Create Everywhere, Redeem Everything, Be A Fool. The Winking Circle's mission is the Eccentrification of the World.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.tallbiketour.com/ The Zenga Bros Tall Bike Tour]\n* [http://nomediakings.org/vidz/take_our_taste_test.html Jim Munroe's discussion of the Coca-Cola ad]"
