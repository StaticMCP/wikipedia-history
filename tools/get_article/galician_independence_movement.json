In Argentina there was an association called Sociedade Nazonalista Pondal, active mostly in the 1930s.\nRepublic of Galicia\nIn 1931, Galicia declared its independence. The next day, Galicia rejoined Spain.\nFranco and the 1970s\n'' is the flag used since the 1970s by the Galician separatist and Galician nationalist movements]]\nWith the beginning and spread of several mass movements of protests in 1968, including various regions and cities of Spain united against Francisco Franco's regime, the Francoist dictatorship of Spain repressed the protests and strikes in the country using police brutality and state violence. In the 1970s, a sector of the Galician People's Union near of Moncho Reboiras tried to organize a rebel group against the Francoist dictatorship of Spain following the model of ETA, but ended with the murder of Reboiras. In 1978, a sector of the Galician People's Union was split, constituting first the Galician People's Union-Proletarian Line and later the Galician Party of the Proletariat, with secessionist character.\nGalician independentism at present\nIn 1986 the Communist Party of National Liberation, a secessionist splinter of the Galician People's Union, was expelled from the BNG for having supported the candidacy of Herri Batasuna during the Elections to the European Parliament. Beside the Galiza Ceive-OLN (the new name of the organization) and several secessionist groups, they formed the Galician People's Front the following year, which has been the main Galician secessionist organization since then.\nIn that context appeared the Exército Guerrilheiro do Povo Galego Ceive, which carried out 90 terrorist actions in six years, the last one on 13 of September, 1991. As consequence two activists, a civil guard and a girl died. Several dozens of supposed members were arrested.\nTen members of Assembleia da Mocidade Independentista and other groups were held in 2005 and two of them were strongly suspected of having placed a bomb in an automatic cash dispenser in Santiago de Compostela. That same year the existence of a group named Resistência Galega, which has claimed responsibility for several bomb attacks, was made public.\nThe BNG, the major nationalist/secessionist political party, has 25 of the 75 seats in the Galician Parliament.\nPro-independence public figures\n*Xose Manuel Beiras, politician.\n*Xosé Luís Méndez Ferrín, writer, candidate to the Nobel Prize of Literature in 1999, ex-president of the Royal Galician Academy and member of the Galician People's Front.\n*José Ignacio Fernández Palacios, ex-football player.\n*Alfonso Daniel Rodríguez Castelao, Galician politician, writer, painter and doctor.\n*Camilo Nogueira Román, politician.\n*Rosalia de Castro, Galician romanticist writer and poet.\n*Ricardo Carvalho Calero, father of the reintegrationist movement, founder of the Galician Association of Language and writer.\n*Uxío Novoneyra, poet, journalist and writer of children's literature.\n*Teresa Moure, writer and feminist.
