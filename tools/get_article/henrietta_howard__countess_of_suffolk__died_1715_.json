They had two children:\n*Mary O'Brien (died 1716), who died unmarried.\n*Henry O'Brien, 8th Earl of Thomond (1688-1741)\nHer son Henry inherited the titles of his grandfather, Henry O'Brien, 7th Earl of Thomond.\nLord Ibrackan died of smallpox in 1690. In April 1705, his widow married Henry Howard, MP, whose wife, Lady Auberie Anne Penelope O'Brien, daughter of the 7th Earl of Thomond (and sister of Henrietta's first husband), had died in November 1703, leaving him with four sons and a daughter. Henry Howard, then heir to the earldom of Suffolk, was created 1st Earl of Bindon at the end of 1706, making his wife a countess. He became Earl of Suffolk in 1709.\nIn 1706, Henry Howard's youngest brother, Charles, married his sister-in-law's namesake, Henrietta Hobart, the ward of Henry and Charles's father, the 5th Earl of Suffolk. This other Henrietta would become notorious as a royal mistress.\nHenrietta and her second husband had no children. On his death in 1718, he was succeeded in the earldom and in his Lord-Lieutenancy by Charles William, his eldest surviving son from his first marriage.\nHenrietta died at Audley End, Essex, and was buried in the Howard family vault at Saffron Walden.\nReferences"
