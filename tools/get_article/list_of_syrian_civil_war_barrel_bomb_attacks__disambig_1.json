They are usually made from a barrel that has been filled with high explosives, along with shrapnel and/or oil. In Syria, they are typically dropped from a helicopter. Due to the large amount of explosives that can be packed into a barrel the resulting detonation can be devastating. The Syrian military often dropped these bombs in civilian areas leading to multiple civilian deaths. The BBC reported that between January 2014 and May 2015, only 1% of those killed by barrel bombs were rebel fighters. By the end of 2017, over 97% of barrel bomb deaths were civilians, and more than 25% were children. According to the UK-based Syrian Network for Human Rights, since the start of the war through to December 2017, at least 68,334 barrel bombs have been used.\nKey:\n* = chemical attack
