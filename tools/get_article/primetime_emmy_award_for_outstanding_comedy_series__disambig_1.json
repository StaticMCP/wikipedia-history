From 1960 to 1964, this category was combined with the Comedy Specials (one time programs) category so that both type of programs competed for the same award during those years. The award goes to the producers of the series.\nMilestones\nThe Flintstones and Family Guy are the only animated sitcoms to be nominated for the award. As of 2020, Fleabag (United Kingdom) and ''Schitt's Creek'' (Canada) are the only shows from outside the United States to win this award.\nThe Big Three networks (ABC, CBS and NBC) have dominated the category. Only eight other networks have won the award: HBO (once with Sex and the City and three times with Veep) four times, Apple TV+ (two times with Ted Lasso and once with The Studio) three times, Fox (with Ally McBeal and Arrested Development) twice, and Amazon Prime Video (with The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel), the BBC (with Fleabag; although seen later on Prime Video), Pop TV (with ''Schitt's Creek; originally seen on CBC Television), Max (with Hacks), and FX (with The Bear) once.\nWinners and nominations\nThe following tables, divided by decade, show the winners listed first in colored row, followed by the other nominees of the \"Comedy Series\" award, according to the Primetime Emmy Awards database:\n1950s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%;\" | Year\n! style=\"width:90%;\" | Program\n! style=\"width:5%;\" | Network\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\"|Best Comedy Show\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center\"| 1952(4th) || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | The Red Skelton Show || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | NBC\n|-\n| The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show || CBS\n|-\n| The Herb Shriner Show || ABC\n|-\n| I Love Lucy || CBS\n|-\n| You Bet Your Life || NBC\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\"|Best Situation Comedy\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center\"| 1953(5th) || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | I Love Lucy || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | CBS\n|-\n| The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet || ABC\n|-\n| Amos 'n' Andy || rowspan=\"2\" | CBS\n|-\n| The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show\n|-\n| Mister Peepers || NBC\n|-\n| Our Miss Brooks || CBS\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center\"| 1954(6th) || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | I Love Lucy || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | CBS\n|-\n| The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show || CBS\n|-\n| Mister Peepers || NBC\n|-\n| Our Miss Brooks || rowspan=\"2\" | CBS\n|-\n| Topper\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\"|Best Situation Comedy Series\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center\"| 1955(7th) || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Make Room for Daddy || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | ABC\n|-\n| The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show || rowspan=\"2\" | CBS\n|-\n| I Love Lucy\n|-\n| Mister Peepers || NBC\n|-\n| Our Miss Brooks || rowspan=\"2\" | CBS\n|-\n| Private Secretary\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\"|Best Comedy Series\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center\"| 1956(8th) || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | The Phil Silvers Show || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | CBS\n|-\n| The Bob Cummings Show || rowspan=\"3\" | NBC\n|-\n| Caesar's Hour\n|-\n| The George Gobel Show\n|-\n| The Jack Benny Show || CBS\n|-\n| Make Room for Daddy || ABC\n|-\n| rowspan=13 style=\"text-align:center\" | 1957(9th)\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\"| Best Series – Half Hour or Less\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n|| 'The Phil Silvers Show (comedy) || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | CBS'\n|-\n| Alfred Hitchcock Presents (drama anthology) || CBS\n|-\n| Father Knows Best (comedy) || NBC\n|-\n| The Jack Benny Show (comedy) || rowspan=2|CBS\n|-\n| Person to Person (interviews)\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\"| Best Series – One Hour or More\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n|| '''Caesar's Hour (comedy) || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | NBC'\n|-\n| Climax!
