He wrote several classic books in these areas; his book on the Riemann zeta-function was reissued in a 1986 edition edited by Roger Heath-Brown.\nTitchmarsh was Savilian Professor of Geometry at the University of Oxford from 1932 to 1963. He was a Plenary Speaker at the ICM in 1954 in Amsterdam.\nHe was on the governing body of Abingdon School from 1935-1947.\nAwards\n*Fellow of the Royal Society, 1931\n*De Morgan Medal, 1953\n*Sylvester Medal, 1955\n*Berwick Prize winner, 1956\nPublications\n*The Zeta-Function of Riemann (1930);\n*Introduction to the Theory of Fourier Integrals (1937) 2nd. edition(1939) 2nd. edition (1948);\n*The Theory of Functions  (1932);\n*Mathematics for the General Reader (1948);\n*The Theory of the Riemann Zeta-Function (1951); [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Theory_of_the_Riemann_Zeta_function.html?id=1CyfApMt8JYC 2nd edition], revised by D.
