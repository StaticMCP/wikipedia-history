The biggest drawback, one that can make the listener tire of the album long before it ends, is her terminally flat, undisciplined voice. More often than not, her compelling song structures suffer because of it.\" BLARE Magazine called it \"everything her admirers... revel in, but cocooned in an indie rock shell that’s rigid on the outside with a tender core. Both her words and guitar licks are poetic and spiteful, as they portray King’s instrumental ability to produce guitar melodies that tease, anger and even drug, a trait some modern guitarists in this lifetime severely lack.\" Jessica Hopper of Spin wrote, \"King sounds wholly at home commanding an indie-rock power trio. Junior could be just the thing for still-mourning Sleater-Kinney fans or anyone who likes their licks righteous and their indignation more so.\"\nPersonnel\n*Kaki King – guitars, vocals\n*Jordan Perlson – drums\n*Dan Brantigan – multiple instruments\n*Matt Hankle – drums on Falling Day\nProduction\n*Malcolm Burn – producer\nReferences"
