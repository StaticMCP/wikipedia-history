It is also known as What Love May Bring.\nPlot\nIlva is a woman who falls in love too easily.  Unaware and unconcerned about how her passion may be perceived, she finds herself having to live with the consequences of her actions.  First, in the middle of the German occupation in Paris, she falls for a Nazi, which indirectly leads to the death of her father. For many, her relationship was interpreted as her collaboration with the Nazis. Her next love story, however, bring additional tragedy.  During the liberation of France in '44, when she is violently summoned to answer for her relationship with the German, she is saved by two Americans GIs, one white and one black. She falls in love with both these men, at the same time.  Her inability to choose between them, creates conflict, unhappiness and murder.\nThe film combines history, music, and a little absurdity to treat the subject of love, passion, and destiny.\nCast\n* Dominique Pinon as Maurice Lemoine\n* Jacky Ido as Bob Kane\n* Anouk Aimée as Madame Blum\n* Audrey Dana as Ilva / Simone / Sophia\n** Gisèle Casadesus as Old Ilva\n* Kristina Cepraga as Brigitte Bardot\n* Samuel Labarthe as Horst\n* Gilles Lemaire as Jim Singer\n* Laurent Couson as Simon\n* Judith Magre as Esther\n* Raphaël Haroche as Louis\n* Lise Lamétrie as Madame Dubois\n* Christine Citti as The poisoner\n* Piotr Polak as a The German soldier\n* Zinedine Soualem as The accordionist\n* Liane Foly as The street singer\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
