Kennedy. All four presidential debates were the first series of debates conducted for any US presidential election. The next presidential debate did not occur until 1976, after which debates would become a regular feature of all presidential campaigns.\nBackground\nIn 1960, the Republican Party nominated the incumbent vice president Richard Nixon as their presidential nominee, with Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., the United States ambassador to the United Nations, as his running mate. John F. Kennedy, a senator from Massachusetts, was nominated by the Democratic Party as their presidential nominee. He chose the Senate Democratic leader Lyndon B. Johnson as his running mate.  Most polls after the party conventions showed the NixonLodge ticket having a six point lead over the KennedyJohnson ticket.\nDebate schedule\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-†\n! colspan=\"16\" style=\"background:#B0C4DE\" | 1960 United States presidential election debates\n|-\n!style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"|&nbsp; || Date and time || Host || Location|| Moderator || colspan=\"10\" scope=\"col\" | Participants\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\" |Key: Participant &nbsp;\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em; background: #FF3333;\"|\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em; background: #34AAE0;\"|\n|-\n!

The format decided was:\n* Eight minute opening statements\n* Two and a half minute responses to questions\n* Optional rebuttal\n* three minute closing statements.\nNixon refused make-up for the first debate, subsequently his facial stubble showed prominently on black-and-white television screens. During the debate, Nixon started sweating under the studio lights. His light gray suit faded into the backdrop of the set and seemed to match his skin tone. Reacting to this, his mother immediately called him and asked whether he was sick. Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley in an interview said:\n}}\nNixon blamed his poor performance on hitting his knee on a car door in Greensboro, North Carolina, after which he had to be hospitalized for a staph infection.\nOctober 7: Second presidential debate (WRC-TV studios, Washington D.C.)\n|venue=WRC-TV studios\n|location=Washington, D.C.\n|participants=Richard NixonJohn F.
