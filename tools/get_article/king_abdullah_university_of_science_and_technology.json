Founded in 2009, the university provides research and graduate training programs in English as the official language of instruction. It is named after King Abdullah bin Abdulalziz, the ruler of Saudi Arabia from 2005 until 2015.\nKAUST is the first mixed-gender university campus in Saudi Arabia. In 2013, the university was among the 500 fastest growing research and citation records in the world. In the 2016 Nature Index Rising Stars, the university ranked 19th in the world of the fastest rising universities for high quality research output. In 2019, KAUST was ranked 8th fastest rising young universities (aged 50 and under) for their research output since 2015, as measured by fractional count (FC).\nSince September 2024, neuroscientist Sir Edward Byrne has served as KAUST's fourth president.\nHistory\nIn 2006, Ali Al-Naimi chaired a Saudi Aramco team to undertake the building and planning of the academics.  Nadhmi Al-Nasr was chosen to lead the project.  They employed the Washington Advisory Group's Frank H. T. Rhodes and Frank Press to design the academic structure, SRI International to develop the four research institutes, and the architectural firm of HOK for the campus master plan, which included wind towers and solar panels.  The location of the campus at Thuwal included 16.4 sq km on land and 19.6 sq km of marine sanctuary offshore.  Ground breaking took place in October 2007, and 178 scholarships were awarded in January 2008.\nThe inauguration ceremony of KAUST was held on September 23, 2009, during which King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud stated that places like the university that \"embrace all people are the first line of defence against extremists\".[https://gulfnews.com/world/gulf/saudi/king-abdullah-calls-kaust-beacon-of-tolerance-1.540993] The university initially received a $10 billion endowment. Upon opening, the university admitted 400 students from over 60 countries and 70 faculty. The campus is home to Shaheen, Asia's fastest supercomputer at the time of its commissioning.\nIn September 2018, KAUST signed a 5-year R&D partnership agreement with McLaren.\nCampus\nDescription\nThe university's core campus, located on the Red Sea at Thuwal, is sited on more than , encompassing a marine sanctuary, museum, and research facility.\nKAUST is the first mixed-gender university campus in Saudi Arabia. Saudi authorities hope the mixed-gender center will help modernize the Kingdom's deeply conservative society. The religious police do not operate on-site. Women are allowed to mix freely with men  and they are not required to wear veils in the coeducational classes.\nKAUST was Saudi Arabia's first LEED certified project and is the world's largest LEED Platinum campus. Designed by international architecture firm Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum, it was also chosen by the American Institute of Architects (AIA) Committee on the Environment (COTE) as one of the 2010 Top Ten Green Projects. The university library received the 2011 AIA/ALA Library Building Award for accomplishments in library architecture.\nResearch\nKAUST organizes its research teams across three academic disciplines, 12 research centers and individual faculty labs. KAUST focuses its research around the areas of food and health, water, energy, environment and the digital domain.\nAcademic divisions\nBiological and Environmental Science and Engineering Division\nResearch in the Biological and Environmental Science and Engineering Division (BESE) is organized around six focal areas: environmental systems; epigenetics; functional biology; genomics; imaging/structural biology; and marine science.\nComputer, Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Division\nResearch in the Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Division (CEMSE) is clustered into four main areas:\n* Electrical engineering, including the development of communication networks; CMOS integrated circuits; electronic and optics/photonics devices; micro-electro-mechanical systems; various types of sensors, measurement and detection devices; as well as functional- and nano-materials.\n* Mathematical analysis, including modeling and simulations with applications to physical, chemical, biological and environmental processes; materials science; oil exploration and reservoir management.\n* Computer science and big data, including bioinformatics; and visual and extreme computing.\n* Statistics and data science, including climate science, environmental statistics, and biostatistics.\nPhysical Sciences and Engineering Division\nResearch in the Physical Sciences and Engineering Division (PSE) includes areas such as theoretical physics and physical chemistry; catalysis and bioengineering; polymers and composites; energy production, storage and conversion; water purification and environmental protection; novel materials, nanodevices and systems; sensors and smart devices for the detection of pollutants and the purification of air, water, and food; earth sciences, mechanics and geomechanics; oil exploration and recovery; and  sequestration.\n| CWTS_W =  | CWTS_W_year =  | CWTS_W_ref =\n| QS_W =  | QS_W_year =  | QS_W_ref =\n| THE_W =  | THE_W_year =  | THE_W_ref =\n| USNWR_W = 100 | USNWR_W_year = 2024-2025 | USNWR_W_ref =\n}}\nPostgraduate programs\nMaster's\nThe Master of Science (M.S.) program at KAUST can be taken in one of the 16 available disciplines. It is expected that students complete the degree in 18 months and may be completed with or without a thesis component.\nAdmission to the M.S. program requires the satisfactory completion of an undergraduate science degree in a relevant or related area, such as engineering, mathematics or the physical, chemical and biological sciences.\nDoctor of Philosophy\nThe Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program at KAUST can be taken in one of the 16 available disciplines. It typically takes three to four years to complete.\nAdmission to the Ph.D. program requires the satisfactory completion of a master's degree in science in a relevant or related area, such as engineering, mathematics or the physical, chemical and biological sciences.\nM.S. / Ph.D. Program\nThe M.S./Ph.D. program allows students to apply for the Ph.D. program after completing a bachelor's degree. The program typically takes four to five years to complete.\nPostgraduate Diploma\nKAUST offers a one-year Postgraduate Diploma in Digital Industrial Design, Physical Science and Engineering, and Bioscience. Each program is made up of soft skill, experimental, theoretical and entrepreneurship courses as well as a capstone experience.\nInternship programs\nVisiting Student Research Program\nThe VSRP is a three to six-month internship program available for 3rd/4th year undergraduate or master's students. During the program, students will work under the guidance of KAUST faculty mentors on a current research project. Students accepted into the program receive a monthly stipend as well as having their accommodation, health insurance and travel costs covered.\nVisiting Student Program\nThe Visiting Student Program (VS) is a flexible program allowing 3rd/4th year undergraduate or master's students to work directly with KAUST faculty members. Its length can range from a few days to several months. Students accepted into the program normally receive a monthly stipend as well as having their accommodation, health insurance and travel costs covered.\nProgram disciplines\n* Applied Mathematics and Computational Science\n* Applied Physics\n* Bioengineering\n* Bioscience\n* Chemical Engineering\n* Chemistry\n* Computer Science\n* Earth Science and Engineering\n* Electrical and Computer Engineering\n* Energy Resources and Petroleum Engineering\n* Environmental Science and Engineering\n* Marine Science\n* Material Science and Engineering\n* Mechanical Engineering\n* Plant Science\n* Statistics\nAdmissions\nWhile there is no minimum academic entry requirement, those admitted typically have strong grade profiles and clear research interests. Applicants are also required to meet English language requirements for entry unless they qualify for an exemption.\nFellowship\nEvery student who is admitted receives the KAUST Fellowship. This fellowship covers the cost of a student's tuition fees, accommodation, health insurance, and relocation costs as well as giving the student a monthly stipend.\nSee also\n* Education in Saudi Arabia\n* Shaheen (supercomputer)\n* List of things named after Saudi kings\n* List of universities and colleges in Saudi Arabia\nReferences"
