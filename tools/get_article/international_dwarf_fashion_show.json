They are best known for their contribution to fashion week in Paris, New York and Berlin.\nHistory\nAfter seeing a dwarf woman struggling to find appropriate clothes, CEO of CBH Model Management Myriam Chalek decided she wanted to raise awareness about achondroplasia (a form of dwarfism) by exposing the fashion and modeling industry to the unexplored market of dwarfism.\nChalek and the nonprofit Donnons Leur Une Chance founded The Dwarf Fashion Show, consisting entirely of dwarf models. The Dwarf Fashion Show took part in Paris's annual fashion week and received extensive media coverage.\nIn 2015, due to the heightened success of The Dwarf Fashion Show, Chalek took what was supposed to be a single event and created the non-profit The International Dwarf Fashion show.\nThe mission of the International Dwarf Fashion Show is \"to reverse the discriminatory diktats of beauty and to give the opportunity to little people to express themselves by bringing an innovative perspective to the fashion industry. Also, while giving people opportunity, they also highly edited photos of people to make their image not look like them anymore.\nInvolvement in Fashion Weeks\n*Paris Fashion Week, September 27, 2014: In collaboration with the French non profit Donnons leur une chance association, CBH model management and Creative Business House, the International Dwarf Fashion Show makes its debut at the Pavillon Gariel during Paris Fashion Week.\n*New York Fashion Week, February 12, 2015: The International Dwarf Fashion Show opened as part of New York City Fashion Week and featured Jordanna James, dancer of Miley Cyrus and celebrity cast of the TV show Little Women New York in a \"Dollar Dress\" made entirely of real $100 bills.
