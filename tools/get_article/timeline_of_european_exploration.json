In the 16th century, various European states funded expeditions to the interior of both North and South America, as well as to their respective west and east coasts, north to California and Labrador and south to Chile and Tierra del Fuego. In the 17th century, Russian explorers conquered Siberia in search of sables, while the Dutch contributed greatly to the charting of Australia. The 18th century witnessed the first extensive explorations of the South Pacific and Oceania and the exploration of Alaska, while the 19th was dominated by exploration of the polar regions and excursions into the heart of Africa. By the early 20th century, the poles themselves had been reached.\n15th century\nlands at Calicut, illustration for Os Lusíadas, 1880 by Ernesto Casanova]]\n*1402 - Castilian colonization of the Canary Islands Canary Islands began with the expedition of the French explorers Jean de Béthencourt and Gadifer de la Salle, nobles and vassals of Henry III of Castile, to Lanzarote\n*1418 – Portuguese explorers João Gonçalves Zarco and Tristão Vaz Teixeira discover Porto Santo Island in the Madeira archipelago.\n*1419 – Gonçalves and Vaz discover the main island of Madeira.\n*1431 – Diogo de Silves discovers the Azores.\n*1434 – Gil Eanes passes Cabo de Não and becomes the first confirmed person to sail beyond Cape Bojador and return alive.\n*1444 – Dinis Dias reaches the mouth of the Senegal River.\n*1446 – The Portuguese reach the mainland peninsula of Cape Verde and the Gambia River.\n*1456 – Alvise Cadamosto and Diogo Gomes discover the Cape Verde Islands,  west of the Cape Verde peninsula.\n*1460 – Pêro de Sintra reaches Sierra Leone.\n*1470 – Cape Palmas is passed.\n*1472 – Fernão do Pó lands on the island of Bioko.\n*1473 – Lopo Gonçalves is the first European sailor to cross the Equator.\n*1474–75 – Ruy de Sequeira discovers São Tomé and Príncipe.\n*1482 – Diogo Cão reaches the Congo River, where he erects a padrão (\"pillar of stone\").\n*1485–86 – Cão reaches Cape Cross, where he erects his last padrão.\n*1487–92 – Pêro da Covilhã travels to Arabia, to the mouth of the Red Sea, and then eastward by sail to the Malabar Coast (visiting Calicut and Goa on the Indian subcontinent).
