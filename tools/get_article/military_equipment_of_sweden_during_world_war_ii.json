Between 10,000 and 20,000 Swedes fought as volunteers abroad, a majority of them in service of Finland during the Winter War.\nArmy\nSmall arms\nIn the early stages of the war, Sweden relied on a numerous army through conscription and the use of a Total Defence policy. In 1945, the Swedish army had been modernized from the use of World War I weapons to semi-automatic rifles and high-tech firearms such as the Carl Gustav. The infantry had also been equipped with a great deal of rocket launchers for anti-tank warfare, and the availability of artillery had increased drastically with the World War II build-up.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Name\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Origin\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Type\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Versions\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Quantity\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|In service\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Notes\n|-\n| Pistol m/07 || ||Semi-automatic pistol||Pistol m/07 || Unknown || 1907-1980's || License-built FN Browning 1903.\n|-\n| Pistol m/39 || ||Semi-automatic pistol||Pistol m/39 || Unknown || 1939-???? ||-\n|-\n| Pistol m/40 || ||Semi-automatic pistol ||Pistol m/40Pistol m/40B || 100,000 ||1940-1990s || |License-built Lahti L-35, manufactured by Husqvarna\n|-\n| Kulsprutepistol m/37 || ||Submachine gun ||m/37m/37-39m/37-39F || 35,000 ||1939-1980s || |-\n|-\n| Kpist m/39 || ||Submachine gun ||Kpist m/39 || Unknown ||1940s-???? || |-\n|-\n| Kpist m/40 || ||Submachine gun ||Kpist m/40 || 500 ||1940-1951 || | M1921 Thompson submachine gun.\n|-\n| Kpist m/45 || ||Submachine gun ||m/45 || 300,000 || 1945–2007 || |-\n|-\n| Gevär m/96 || ||Bolt-action rifle ||Karbin m/94Gevär m/96Gevär m/38Gevär m/41Gevär m/41B ||127,000535,00088,0005,3005,300 ||1895-1980s || |-\n|-\n| Gevär m/39 || ||Bolt-action rifle ||m/39m/40||5,000||1939-1970s || |Modified German K98K's.\n|-\n| Automatgevär m/42 || ||Self-loading rifle ||Ag m/42 ||30,000||1942-1960s || |-\n|-\n| Kulsprutegevär m/21, m/21-37, m/37 || || Automatic rifle ||m/21m/37 ||Unknown||1921–1980 || |Modified M1918 Browning produced under license.\n|-\n| Kg m/39 |||| Automatic rifle ||Kg m/39||Unknown||1939-???? || | -\n|-\n| Kg m/40 |||| Automatic rifle ||Kg m/40 ||5,000||1940-???? || |-\n|-\n| Ksp m/14 ||||Medium machine gun ||Ksp m/14m/14-29 ||Unknown||1910s-1940s || |Standard mount.Ksp m/36 mount.\n|-\n| Ksp m/36 ||||Medium machine gun ||Ksp m/36||Unknown||1910s-???? || |Upgraded M1917 Browning produced under license.\n|-\n| Ksp m/42||||Medium machine gun ||Ksp m/42||1942–present || |License-built, modified M1919.\n|-\n| Pvkan m/39 ||||Anti-tank rifle ||Pvkan m/39||1939–???? || | -\n|-\n| Pvg m/42 ||||Recoilless anti-tank rifle ||Pvg m/42||1942–???? || | -\n|-\n| Raketgevär 46 ||||Recoilless anti-tank weapon ||Raketgevär 46||Unknown||1940s-1960s || |License-built M1 Bazooka\n|-\n|}\nArmoured fighting vehicles\nAt the beginning of World War II, Sweden had a very low number of motorized vehicles, instead relying horses for transportation. When the war broke out in 1939, Sweden had one armoured division consisting of merely 13 light tanks, only 3 of which were considered to be modern (the remaining 10 had been in service since the 1920s).

Anti-aircraft warfare was considered important even before the war began, due to Sweden's small aircraft capacity in the 1930s. The Bofors 40 mm, a Swedish auto cannon, was exported to most warring countries in thousands of examples, making it the most common anti-aircraft weapon of the war.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Name\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Origin\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Type\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Versions\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Quantity\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|In service\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Notes\n|-\n| Pvkan m/38 || ||Light anti-tank gun||m/34m/38m/38F||Unknown||1935-????

Despite this, a fairly large number of bombers and ground-attack aircraft served in the Swedish air force during World War II and after, possibly for intimidation purposes - in fact, after 1940, Sweden had more bombers than fighter aircraft. These offensive aircraft may have been meant to attack Soviet naval bases in the Baltic Sea, and some of the later designs could even reach Moscow with full payload.\nNumber of bombers pre-war: 88\nNumber of bombers in 1939: 116\nNumber of bombers in 1940: 276\nNumber of bombers in 1941: 346\nNumber of bombers in 1942: 534\nNumber of bombers in 1943: 743\nNumber of bombers in 1944: 775\nNumber of bombers in 1945: 879\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Name\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Origin\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Type\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Versions\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Quantity\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|In service\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Notes\n|-\n| B 3 ||  Germany||Bomber aircraft||B 3B 3AB 3BB 3CB 3D||33521616||1936-19481937-19581937-19581939-19441941-1958 || |72 total\n|-\n| B 4 || ||Biplane bomber||B 4B 4A||342||1937–1947 || |5 used in the Winter War\n|-\n| B 5 || ||Ground attack aircraft||B 5AB 5BB 5C||16438||1938-19421940-19501941-1950 || |103 total\n|-\n| B 6 || ||Ground attack aircraft||B 6||2||1940-1953 || |More were ordered but never entered service\n|-\n| B 16 || Italy||Light bomberReconnaissance aircraftReconnaissance aircraftTorpedo bomberLight transport||B 16AS 16AS 16BT 16ATp 16A||306614142||1940-19431940-19451942-19451941-19421941-1946|| |126 total\n|-\n| Saab 17 ||||Bomber and reconnaissance aircraft||B 17B 17BB 17CS 17BLS 17BS||13254776456||1943-19481942-19451943-19471942-19491942-1949|| |383 total\n|-\n| Saab 18 ||||Bomber and reconnaissance aircraft||B 18AB 18B||62120||1944-19471945-1958|| |-\n|-\n| T 1 ||  Germany||Torpedo bomber||T 1||2||1928–1939|| |-\n|-\n| T 2 ||  Germany||Torpedo bomber seaplane||T 2||12||1939–1948|| |-\n|-\n|}\nAuxiliary aircraft\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Name\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Origin\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Type\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Versions\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Quantity\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|In service\n! style=\"text-align:left\"|Notes\n|-\n| Trp 1 || Germany||Small passenger transport aircraft||Trp 1||3||1928-1946|| |The world's first all-metal transport aircraft\n|-\n| Trp 2 || Germany||Passenger and transport aircraft||Trp 2Trp 2A||02||1933-1945|| |One Trp 2 was in use until 1935\n|-\n| Trp 3 ||||Light transport aircraft||Trp 3||1||1936-1942|| |-\n|-\n| Trp 4 ||||Trainer and utility aircraft||Trp 4||1||1940-1953|| |-\n|-\n| Tp 5 || Germany||Transport aircraft||Tp 5||5||1940-1945|| |-\n|-\n| Tp 6 ||||STOL aircraft||Tp 6||1||1940-1941|| |-\n|-\n| Tp 7 ||||Transport and trainer aircraft||Tp 7||1||1940-1944|| |Still preserved in flying condition\n|-\n| Tp 8 ||||Biplane transport aircraft||Tp 8Tp 8A||31||1940-????|| |-\n|-\n| Tp 9 || Germany||Bomber, reconnaissance and airliner||Tp 9||1||1940-????|| |-\n|-\n| Tp 10 || Netherlands||Airliner||Tp 10||1||1942-1944|| |-\n|-\n| Tp 11 ||||Reconnaissance aircraft||Tp 11||1||1939-1951|| |-\n|-\n| Tp 12 ||||Reconnaissance aircraft||GV 38||6||1941-1945|| |-\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n*List of equipment of the Swedish Armed Forces\n*Military equipment of Sweden during the Cold War\nReferences\nSources and further reading\n*http://www.beredskapstid.se/cms/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=76\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20120109074948/http://www.sphf.se/Axvall/samling.htm\n*http://www2.landskrona.se/kultur/landsverk/militart/pansarstart.html\n*http://ww2db.com/country/sweden"
