Influenced by Haitian Voodoo rhythms and the avant-garde jazz of Albert Ayler, the album was critically well-received and made the band a favorite of the Northwest's burgeoning DIY scene. It was remastered by Scott Colburn re-issued on vinyl by Debacle Records on June 10, 2014.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nAdapted from the King Tears Bat Trip liner notes.\n;King Tears Bat Trip\n* Luke Bergman&nbsp;– electric guitar, percussion, mixing\n* Thomas Campbell&nbsp;– drums\n* Kristian Garrard&nbsp;– drums\n* Chris Icasiano&nbsp;– drums\n* Brandon Lucia&nbsp;– electronics, percussion (2)\n* Neil Welch&nbsp;– tenor saxophone, percussion\n* Evan Woodle&nbsp;– drums\n;Production and additional personnel\n* Kristian Garrard&nbsp;– mastering, cover art, design\nRelease history\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!
