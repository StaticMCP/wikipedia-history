The protests resulted in the resignation of Aslan Bzhania as president of Abkhazia.\nAs no candidate received a majority of the vote in the first round, a second round was held on 1 March. Acting president Badra Gunba was elected, receiving 56% of the vote.\nBackground\nThe election was called after president Aslan Bzhania resigned in November 2024 due to protests against an agreement allowing wealthy Russians to purchase property in Abkhazia. He was replaced on an acting basis by his vice president, Badra Gunba. On 28 November 2024, the People's Assembly of Abkhazia announced that new presidential elections would be held on 15 February 2025, with the winner to be inaugurated within the next 30 days of the results being declared. Assembly speaker Lasha Ashuba has estimated that the election would cost up to 25 million rubles ($227,300).\nResearcher Olesya Vartanyan stated on 13 February that high-ranking Russians, notably Sergey Kiriyenko, are interfering with the election's conduct to help Badra Gunba, the candidate who is the most favorable to the Kremlin. Adgur Ardzinba was accused of being a \"Turkish agent\" which was compared to the 2004 Abkhazian presidential election, when Sergei Bagapsh was presented as pro-Georgian. The claim was rejected by the opposition.\nElectoral system\nA candidate needs to win a majority of votes in the first round to avoid a runoff, which must be held within two weeks. In the second round, a \"none of the above\" option is included in the ballot. A candidate must receive more votes than both their opponent and the combined \"none of the above\" votes in order to win.\nCandidates\n*Badra Gunba – acting president and former vice president. Gunba was endorsed by Aitaira, Amtsakhara, Apsadgyl, Kyarazaa, Our Home – Abkhazia, People's Front of Abkhazia and United Abkhazia.\n*Adgur Ardzinba – leader of the Abkhaz People's Movement. He replaced MP Kan Kvarchia, who withdrew citing health issues following injuries sustained in the 2024 Parliament of Abkhazia shooting on 19 December. Arzinba was endorsed by Aamta, Aiaaira, Akzaara, Apsny, Aruaa, FNEA, Modern State and Our Capital.\n* – former head of the Abkhazian Trade Mission in Russia.\n*Robert Arshba – former head of the Abkhazian Audit Chamber.\n* – president of the Black Sea Development Bank.\nCampaign\nFollowing the first round, Ardzinba said that numerous unknown armed and uniformed people had surrounded the headquarters of the Central Election Commission of Abkhazia (CEC) in Sukhumi.\nOn 23 February, the CEC said that Gunba had violated electoral campaign laws by attending a meeting between Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko and the Abkhazian acting Health Minister Eduard Butba.\nA televised debate was held between Gunba and Ardzinba on 27 February.\nDuring the runoff on 1 March, masked attackers stormed a polling station and threatened election officials in northwestern Abkhazia.
