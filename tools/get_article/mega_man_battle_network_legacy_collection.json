It compiles emulated versions of all six main entries in the Mega Man Battle Network series, originally released for the Game Boy Advance between 2001 and 2005. Like other Mega Man Legacy Collection entries, the compilation also includes various enhancements and behind-the-scenes materials. Battle Network Legacy Collection is split between two volumes, both of which were released simultaneously in 2023 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Windows.\nOverview\nThe games in Battle Network Legacy Collection are based on their original Japanese versions, but with translations available for international releases to allow the usage of features previously exclusive to the Japanese versions, including most of the crossover content based on Konami's Boktai series. The games in the collection were updated to support competitive battling and battle chip trading via online multiplayer, as well as trading customizations from certain games. The collection also includes an art gallery, a music player, and additional screen-filtering options. In addition, battle records can be traded between games, and all 15 battle chips that were only distributed via Japanese events can be enabled. Other features include the ability to enable \"patch cards\" in 4–6, 499 cards that could previously only be activated using the Nintendo e-Reader in the original release; and \"Buster MAX mode\", which multiplies MegaMan.EXE's buster attack power by 100 for simpler gameplay. The game's menu features an interactive MegaMan.EXE that reacts to the player's choices, reprised by his MegaMan NT Warrior actors Akiko Kimura in Japanese and Andrew Francis in English.\nIncluded games\nBattle Network Legacy Collection is split between two volumes, each containing three numbered entries. As Battle Network 3–6 each received two different versions when the games were originally released, both versions of each game are included, bringing the total to 10 games.\nVolume 1\nVolume 2\nRelease\nBattle Network Legacy Collection was announced during a Nintendo Direct livestream on June 28, 2022.  Both volumes of the collection were released simultaneously on April 14, 2023 for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Windows, making it the only Legacy Collection to not be released on Xbox One. A physical release containing both volumes was also released for Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4. Players who pre-ordered the game received a DLC pack containing two alternate skins for MegaMan.EXE on the menu (one skin per volume), as well as four additional remixed tracks for the game's music player (two tracks per volume); the pre-order content was later made available for purchase on June 27, 2023. To promote the collection, Capcom briefly re-released the MegaMan NT Warrior anime through their video streaming channels.\nReception\n80/100 (PC)77/100 (PS4)\n|OC=71% recommended\n|HCG=4/5\n|NLife=9/10\n|NWR=7.5/10\n|PCM=3.5/5\n|SN=8/10\n|TA=4/5\n}}\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links"
