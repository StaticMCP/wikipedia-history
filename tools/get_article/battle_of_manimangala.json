Manimangala is the first ever victory for the Pallavas against the Chalukyas and also the first of four successive defeats suffered by Pulakesin II.\nCauses\nFollowing the accession of Narasimhavarman I in 630, the Pallavas began to grow in strength. To quell their rise, the Chalukya king Pulakesin II led a southern campaign defeating the Banas on his way to the Pallava kingdom. Pulakesin proceeded to the town of Manimangala, identified with the present-day Manimangalam, about 20 miles from the Pallava capital Kanchi where he was stopped by a strong Pallava army.\nEvents\nThe Kuram plates note that Pulakesin II suffered a defeat and was forced to retreat pursued by the victorious Pallava forces.\nNotes"
