She is eligible to participate, the following year, in the competition for the German Wine Queen.\nHistory\nIn 1931 the Palatinate region of Germany nominated a wine queen in the town of Neustadt an der Weinstraße at the initiative of the publisher, Daniel Meininger, becoming the first of the German wine-growing regions to do so. The first wine queen was Ruth Bachrodt of Pirmasens in the Southwest Palatinate. This part of the Palatinate has no vineyards and Bachrodt owed her election to the fact that the organizers felt she was the prettiest girl in the audience in the festival hall (the Saalbau in Neustadt) and the judges upheld their proposal. The  candidate had previously been asked the question, \"What does a wine queen in all circumstances?\" Bachrodt had replied, \"you definitely need a pair of good shoes, so you can work in the vineyard.\" With that she also impressed the Pirmasens shoe manufacturer, Daniel Theysohn, and they were married in 1938.\nBecause the Palatine Wine Queen in Germany was the only wine queen for many years, she also represented German wine as a whole until 1939 and then again from 1947 to 1949 without needing to go through any further competition. In 1949, too, there was only one competition, but subsequently Elisabeth Kuhn, later Gies from Diedesfeld officially became the German Wine Queen and was thus the only person to hold the titles of Palatine Wine Queen and German Wine Queen in the same year.\nCompetition process\nThe election of the Palatine Wine Queen traditionally takes place during the German Wine Festival, in the Saalbau in the town of Neustadt an der Weinstraße, on the Friday of the first weekend of the festival at the end of September or early October. After her year in office the Palatine Wine Queen, together with the  wine queens of the other twelve German wine regions, takes part in the competition to choose the German Wine Queen. In two years, the outgoing Palatine Wine Queen has been chosen as the German Wine Queen:\nSylvia Benzinger in 2005 and Katja Schweder in 2006.\nList of Palatine wine queens\nThe following list shows all Palatine Wine Queens since the competition began in 1931:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| width=\"100%\" |\n# 1931/32: Ruth Bachrodt, later Theysohn (born 9 Mar 1913; died 5 Mar 1997), Pirmasens\n# 1932/33: Cilly Seitz, Rhodt\n# 1933/34: Gertrud Dörr, Wachenheim\n# 1934/35: Trudel Knauber, Billigheim\n# 1935/36: Hilde Köhler, Gimmeldingen\n# 1936/37: Elisabeth Fitz, later Keller, Edenkoben\n# 1937/38: Gustel Hauptmann, Haardt\n# 1938/39: Maria Poh, Hambach\n# 1947/48: Ilse Kurz, Mußbach\n# 1948/49: Cäcilia Hormuth, St. Martin\n# 1949/50: Elisabeth Kuhn, later Gies, Diedesfeld\n# 1950/51: Trudel Keller, Bad Dürkheim\n# 1951/52: Marlies Lack, Bad Dürkheim\n# 1952/53: Anneliese Bender, Gleisweiler\n# 1953/54: Ingrid Schreck, later Seyler, Deidesheim\n# 1954/55: Rosemarie Reibold, Freinsheim\n# 1955/56: Annemarie Müller, Haardt\n# 1956/57: Ilse Reinig, later Rodach, Edesheim\n# 1957/58: Doris Christmann, St. Martin\n# 1958/59: Renate Poh, Hambach\n# 1959/60: Christel Koch, Ungstein\n# 1960/61: Bärbel Christa Härle, Mußbach\n# 1961/62: Sieglinde Jung, Siebeldingen\n# 1962/63: Inge Bender, Kallstadt\n# 1963/64: Waltraud Lohr, Obrigheim\n# 1964/65: Waltraud Hey, Oberotterbach\n# 1965/66: Heidi Eberle, Laumersheim\n# 1966/67: Ulrike Klein, Rhodt\n# 1967/68: Christa Jung, Siebeldingen\n# 1968/69: Heidrun Reim, Mußbach\n# 1969/70: Gretel Stachel, Maikammer\n# 1970/71: Ruth Kröther, Freinsheim\n# 1971/72: Melitta Engel (born 24 Mar 1952; died 8 Sep 2012), Obrigheim\n# 1972/73: Helga Weber, Weisenheim am Sand\n# 1973/74: Siegrid Betz, Wachenheim\n# 1974/75: Annette Oehl, later Göb, Forst\n# 1975/76: Maritta Müller, Hambach\n# 1976/77: Ingrid Grimm, Schweigen\n# 1977/78: Heidrun Winkelmann, Gimmeldingen\n# 1978/79: Christa Brauch, Birkweiler\n# 1979/80: Heike Bohnenstiel, later Voss, Herxheim am Berg\n# 1980/81: Hildegard Weber, Gönnheim\n# 1981/82: Gaby Brückmann, Freinsheim\n# 1982/83: Claudia Hänling, Heuchelheim\n# 1983/84: Sigrun Stutzmann, Einselthum\n# 1984/85: Heidrun Wolf, Birkweiler\n# 1985/86: Maria Bergold, Wachenheim\n# 1986/87: Ulrike Peter, Bad Dürkheim\n# 1987/88: Annette Borell, later Borell-Diehl, Hainfeld\n# 1988/89: Anne Brauner, later Fischer, Göcklingen\n# 1989/90: Birgit Schehl, later Rebholz-Schehl (born 1969), Hainfeld\n# 1990/91: Diane Blaul, later Fehling (born 25.
