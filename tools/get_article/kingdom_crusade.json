Even the king and queen of each respective kingdom are expected to contribute to combat duty; which was expected of kings in the Middle Ages but not of most queens.\nEven though this game is medieval in nature, it does not depict any cultures of Medieval Europe against each other. Players can take either side and both kingdom's units are of equal strength to each other. The units in the game correspond to Western high fantasy (i.e., paladins instead of samurai). All fighting is done in an arcade manner (real-time with button mashing) rather than a typical manner of a strategy or role-playing game (either turn-based or real-time without button mashing).\nEach player must either destroy all of the opponent's units or capture all the castles in order to defeat the opponent and win the game. Winning results in a celebration screen while losing is the equivalent to a game over.\nReception\nAllgame gave this video game a score of 2.5 points out of a possible 5 in their overview. Power Unlimited gave the game a score of 62%, commending its concept, but considered that there is little action and strategy in the game.\nSee also\n* Archon: The Light and the Dark, which plays in a similar fashion to this video game\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
