The album was released through Artoffact Records on June 22, 2018 as the soundtrack to Carbon Games' AirMech Wastelands, a sequel to the 2012 video game AirMech that also featured a soundtrack by Front Line Assembly. WarMech features Jeremy Inkel's final recordings, as he died on January 11, 2018.\nBackground and production\nAlready having been a fan of Bill Leeb's various projects, Carbon Games founder James Green had approached the band for WarMech and its predecessor album AirMech because \"I wanted to work with Bill/FLA for our games [for] the same reason I love the music as a fan. It's more of a signature Bill Leeb thing in fact, as you can hear it across all his music projects - the complex layering and build up of songs. [...] Having something with the depth and texture you find in FLA songs is exactly what I wanted.\"\nDuring the production period of some fifteen months Carbon Games gave the band complete artistic freedom, a process both parties described as easy-going. Carbon Games as well as Front Line Assembly considered the album a big improvement over the already well-received AirMech.\nWhile Leeb saw AirMech as a learning experience, he emphasized the importance of the extensive dubstep programming \"with different types of dubstepping\" for WarMech: \"In some of the songs they are the real key elements. It's more intense in that way, we just pushed it to another level.\"\nRelease\nThe songs \"Mechvirus\" and \"Molotov\" were released for early streaming through the group's Bandcamp account.\nThe original intention of Carbon Games was to issue a physical release of the album themselves. Talks with label Artoffact about the vinyl edition lead to Artoffact assuming responsibilities also for the CD issue.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from WarMech liner notes.\nFront Line Assembly\n* Bill Leeb – vocals, electronic instruments, production\n* Jared Slingerland – electronic instruments, production\n* Jeremy Inkel – strings recording, electronic instruments, production\n* Sasha Keevil – electronic instruments, production\n* Craig Johnson – electronic instruments, production\nAdditional musicians\n* Jason Bazinet – additional samples\nTechnical personnel\n* Dave McKean – album art\nChart history\n{| class = \"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" border=\"1\"\n!
