While there were some very early efforts to support women's suffrage in Virginia, most of the activism for the vote for women occurred early in the 20th century. The Equal Suffrage League of Virginia was formed in 1909 and the Virginia Branch of the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage (later the National Woman's Party) was formed in 1915. Over the next years, women held rallies, conventions and many propositions for women's suffrage were introduced in the Virginia General Assembly. Virginia didn't ratify the Nineteenth Amendment until 1952. Native American women could not have a full vote until 1924 and African American women were effectively disenfranchised until the Voting Rights Act passed in 1965.\n18th century\n1770s\n1778\n* Hannah Lee Corbin from Gloucester County protests women's taxation without representation.\n19th century\n1870s\n1870\n* The Virginia State Woman Suffrage Association (VSWSA) is formed by Anna Whitehead Bodeker.\n1871\n* November: Bodeker attempts to vote in a municipal election in Virginia.\n1890s\n1893\n* The Virginia Suffrage Society is formed by Orra Gray Langhorne.\n1895\n* Susan B.
