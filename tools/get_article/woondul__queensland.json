Apart from these protected areas, there is a small area of crop growing in the east of the locality, but the predominant land use is grazing on native vegetation.\nMount Trapyard is in the south-east of the locality () rising to  above sea level.\nHistory\nIn 1852, the pastoral run Woondul was transferred from Thomas DeLacy Moffat to Henry Stuart Russell. It can be seen as \"Woondool\" on a map of original pastoral runs on the Darling Downs.\nThe locality was officially gazetted on 5 April 2012 and is named after the pastoral run.\nAs at 2021, a pastoral property called Woondul still exists in the area but it is in within the boundaries of the neighbouring locality of Kindon to the south-west.\nDemographics\nThe population of Woodul was not separately reported in the  nor in the , but was included in census reporting of neighbouring Wattle Ridge.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Woondul. The nearest government primary and secondary school (to Year 10) is Millmerran State School in Millmerran to the north-east. There are no schools nearby offering secondary schooling to Year 12; the alternatives are distance education and boarding school.\nReferences"
