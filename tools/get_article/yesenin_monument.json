Made of white marble and set on a small pedestal, it represents the Russian poet Sergei Yesenin seated in a thoughtful pose.\nThe monument has been subjected to several attacks by vandals. It has been painted, and had its nose and fingers removed. After it was damaged a fourth time in 2009, the decision was made to make it less accessible, although it remains in its original location.\nReferences"
