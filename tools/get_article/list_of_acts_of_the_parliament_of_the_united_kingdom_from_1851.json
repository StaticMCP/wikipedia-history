For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".\nSome of these acts have a short title. Some of these acts have never had a short title. Some of these acts have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n14 & 15 Vict.\nThe fourth session of the 15th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 4 February 1851 until 8 August 1851.\nPublic general acts\n|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  for explaining and amending several Laws for the Encouragement of Agriculture, so far as relates to Leases for the Erection of Mills.|note4= }}\n|  and to give Protection from Piracy to Persons exhibiting new Inventions in the Exhibition of the Works of Industry of all Nations in One thousand eight hundred and fifty-one.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  imposing the same.}}\n| or the Sale of Arsenic Regulation Act 1851|public|13|05-06-1851|maintained=y|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to regulate the Sale of Arsenic.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  for the Regulation of Process and Practice in the Superior Courts of Common Law in Ireland.|note4= }}\n|  to assimilate the Stamp Duties in Great Britain and Ireland, and to make Regulations for collecting and managing the same.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  for the Recovery of Fee-farm Rents under that Act, to all other Fee-farm Rents and to other Rents in Ireland reserved upon Grants of Land in which the Grantors have no Reversion.}}\n|  to amend an Act of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Years of King George the Third for empowering Grand Juries in Ireland to present Bridges, and Tolls to be paid for passing the same, in certain Cases.}}\n| or the Ordnance Survey Act 1851|public|22|24-07-1851|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to continue the Survey of Great Britain, Berwick-upon-Tweed, and the Isle of Man.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n| or the Shaftesbury Act|public|28|24-07-1851|archived=n|An Act for the well-ordering of Common Lodging Houses.}}\n|  }}\n|  for authorizing the Application of Highway Rates to Turnpike Roads.|note4= }}\n|  to amend the Laws relating to Loan Societies.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n| or the Shaftesbury Act|public|34|24-07-1851|archived=n|An Act to encourage the Establishment of Lodging Houses for the Labouring Classes.}}\n|  relating to Apprentices bound to the Sea Service to Apprentices bound to the Sea Service by Boards of Guardians of the Poor in Ireland, and to enable such Guardians to place out Boys in the Naval Service.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  for the better assessing and collecting the Poor Rates and Highway Rates in respect of Small Tenements.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n| or the Hainault Forest Inclosure Act 1851|public|43|01-08-1851|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act for disafforesting the forest of Hainault in the county of Essex.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  for amending the Law relative to Private Lunatic Asylums in Ireland.|note4= }}\n|  of Her Majesty's Reign enabling the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Woods to purchase Lands for and to form Victoria Park;
