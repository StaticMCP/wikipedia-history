Following the invasion, Media was under Scythian rule and paid them tribute between 652–624 BCE.\nBackground\nThe Scythians probably made many raids into Mesopotamia, reaching as far south as Media at least from the early 680s BCE.\nInvasion of Media\nThe Scythians' arrival\nGeorge Rawlinson, in the book \"Media; Babylonia; Persia\" wrote:\n\"[...] Four roads lead from Azerbijan, to Hamadan or the Greater Ectaban, one through Menjil and Kasvin, and across the Caraghan  Hills; a second through Miana, Zenjan, and the province of Khamseh; a third by the valley of the Jaghetu, through Chukli and Tikan-Teppeh and a fourth through Sefer-Khaneh and Sennah. We cannot say which of the four the invaders selected [...]\"\nWhen Cyaxares was informed of the invasion, he quickly sent his army to engage in battle with the Scythians, the Medes expected that if they lose the battle, they could still prepare strong defences around their major cities and resist the Scythians there. Both armies were well prepared and full of energy, although Cyaxares's army was surely more experienced and organized.\nThe Scythian king Madyes was victorious in the battle, managing to force Cyaxares to make terms with the enemy, accepting Scythian suzerainty and paying tribute to them annually. He managed to keep his royal title and administration over Medes.\nEarly Scythian rule\nThere is no clear evidence of the Scythians causing widespread destruction around Media, the main complaint against the occupiers is that they repeatedly demanded tribute on some states that was higher than the agreed amount after the conquest. Despite the Scythian oppression of some Median states, their rule over Media was rather peaceful compared to other states like Assyria, as Media was not as warm and rich as other Mesopotamian states. Therefore the Scythian rule did not have great effects on Media, and did not stop them from prospering in the future.\nEnd of Scythian rule over Media\nThe Scythian rule over Media ended when Cyaxares liberated Media. He slew the Scythian leaders during a feast in his palace, then declaring independence from the Scythians.\nReferences"
