The hospital provides inpatient rehabilitation, day hospital services, a minor injury unit and an outpatient unit. It is operated by Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, but some services are provided by Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust. The Countess of Brecknock Hospice (named after Marjorie Minna Jenkins, first wife of John Pratt, 5th Marquess Camden), is located on the same site as the hospital. The independent regulator of health and social care in England, the Care Quality Commission, rated Andover as \"requires improvement\" overall in 2018.\nHistory\nThe hospital has its origins in a small cottage hospital erected in Junction Road in 1876. It was decided to build a new hospital in Charlton Road to commemorate the lives of service personnel who died in the First World War: the new facility was officially opened by Field Marshal Viscount Allenby in 1926. It joined the National Health Service in 1948.\nIn 2010, a new outpatient department was opened at the hospital. The old outpatients department, which was described as \"unsightly\" and \"a danger to the public and a temptation to vandals\" by the Trust's then-acting chief executive, Chris Gordon, was demolished in November 2011.\nIn August 2016, the road leading to the hospital was renamed to Henry Gamman Drive in honour to the man who donated the land on which the hospital was built.\nServices and wards\nPhysiotherapy\nPhysiotherapy services are offered both to outpatients and inpatients at the hospital. The outpatients service advise on muscular exercises and provide a range of treatments, including soft tissue massage, acupuncture and electrotherapy.\nKingfisher Rehabilitation Unit\nKingfisher Ward is a 22-bed ward which specialises in the rehabilitation of elderly people. The ward provides rehabilitation for a variety of patients, including following orthopaedic procedures, post general surgery, for those with cardiac problems or patients recovering from serious infection.\nMaternity Centre\nThe Maternity Centre, formerly known as the Andover Birth Centre, offers ante-natal and post-natal care. The centre also offers the \"DOMINO\" scheme, whereby low-risk women are given the option to give birth outside of a hospital environment, under the care of the community midwifery team.\nMinor Injuries Unit\nThe Minor Injuries Unit is a nurse-led service that provides treatment for minor injuries, aiming to keep patients from using other accident and emergency departments. The unit deals with a number of conditions, including musculoskeletal injuries, wounds, burns and scalds, minor head injuries, minor eye injuries, insect bites and emergency contraception. It also has an X-ray scanner.\nServices offered by Southern Health NHSFT\nSouthern Health NHS Foundation Trust provide the following services at the hospital:\n* Physiotherapy\n* Spinal clinic\n* Rehabilitation services\n* Podiatry\n* Health Visitors\n* School Nurses\nThe hospital is also the base for SHFT's Community Care Team.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.cqc.org.uk/location/RN542 Inspection reports] from the Care Quality Commission"
