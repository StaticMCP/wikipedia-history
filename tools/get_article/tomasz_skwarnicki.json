He is known for his research on gravitational wave detectors, experimental elementary particle physics, the Large Hadron Collider beauty experiment (LHCb), and pentaquarks.\nEducation\nSkwarnicki obtained a M.Sc. in Physics  from Jagiellonian University in Kraków, Poland in 1982. He joined the Institute of Nuclear Physics in Kraków to earn a PhD in 1986.\nAwards\nSkwarnicki began his academic career at the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) in Hamburg, Germany and moved to the US in 1988. In 1989, he joined the Department of Physics at Syracuse University as an assistant professor. He joined faculty at Southern Methodist University in 1992 while working at the Superconducting Super Collider in Dallas. He moved back to Syracuse in 1995.\nSkwarnicki was elected a fellow of the American Physical Society in 2001.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
