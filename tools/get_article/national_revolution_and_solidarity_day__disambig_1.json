Gen. Khaled Mosharraf, who was assassinated in the aftermath. Meanwhile, the soldiers proceeded to release Maj. Gen. Ziaur Rahman, who was put under house arrest at the inception of the coup by Mosharraf. The uprising, though organised by Lt. Col. (retd.) Abu Taher and his clandestine revolutionary socialist group of soldier mutineers, the Biplobi Shainik Sangstha (BSS), to unsuccessfully create a socialist revolution, resulted in Zia's ascension to power.\nThe day marks the end of the political turmoil and series of coups and counter-coups that occurred after the assassination of Mujibur Rahman, the founding President of Bangladesh, on 15 August 1975.\nObservance\nThe Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, Liberal Democratic Party and several other parties commemorate the day and regard the coup as a \"civil–military uprising\".  Taher's party, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal, views the day similarly but observes it as the \"Sepoy-People's Uprising Day\". On the contrary, the Awami League views it negatively and considers it neither a revolutionary nor a solidarity day, calling it the \"Freedom Fighters Killing Day\".\n7 November was a national holiday in Bangladesh during the military government of Lt. Gen. Hussain Muhammad Ershad and prime minister Khaleda Zia's ministries. In November 2007, the military-backed caretaker government of Fakhruddin Ahmed dismissed the holiday.\nSee also\n* Revolution Day in other countries\n* Biplobi Shainik Sangstha (BSS)\n* Military coups in Bangladesh\n* Anti-imperialism solidarity day\n* National Mourning Day (Bangladesh), another former public holiday in Bangladesh\nReferences"
