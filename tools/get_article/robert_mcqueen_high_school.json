It is part of the Washoe County School District.\nHistory\nThe school was named for Dr. Robert McQueen, emeritus professor of psychology at the University of Nevada, Reno.  During his tenure from 1955 to 1991, Dr. McQueen headed UNR's scholarship program, served as department chair and dean, and was appointed to Nevada's first psychological board of examiners.  Dr. McQueen served on the Washoe County School District Board of Trustees from 1969 to 1990, during which the district built several new schools, including Reed and McQueen .  He also negotiated the purchase of McQueen's  site from the Bureau of Land Management for just one dollar.\nWhen the school opened in 1982, adjoining Seventh Street and Robb Drive were only dirt roads extended out to allow access to the school.  Some remarked the school was \"in the middle of nowhere\" as it was more than a mile from other buildings.  Since then, the construction of numerous subdevelopments has resulted in overcrowding problems.  The building was designed for an enrollment of 1,600; in 2009/10 more than 1,800 were enrolled. In order to mitigate overcrowding concerns and comply with local fire regulations, several modular classrooms have been added to the campus.\nIn 2010, Newsweek listed McQueen as the 740th best high school in the United States using the ratio of number of AP exams taken to graduating students as its criterion.\nIn March 2018, student Noah Christiansen called the office of U.S. Representative Mark Amodei to argue in favor of banning bump stocks and raising the minimum age to buy a gun. A staffer who worked for Amodei called Robert McQueen High School for his use of the word \"fuck\", which led to Christiansen's suspension. On March 19, the American Civil Liberties Union sent a letter to the school district demanding that the suspension be overturned. On March 23, the school district decided to withdraw the suspension to avoid \"expensive and protracted litigation\", but stood by the school's action to punish the student.\nExtracurricular activities\nAthletics\n*The Lancers compete in the High Desert League, which is part of the Northern Nevada 5A Region.
