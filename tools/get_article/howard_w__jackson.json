D'Alesandro, Jr., J. Harold Grady,  and Board of School Commissioners efforts after the United States Supreme Court unanimous decision of May 1954, in Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas.\nUnder his first mayoralty, a large number of public schools were constructed, including several co-educational secondary schools including Forest Park High School in the northwestern City and a new \"Castle on the Hill\" landmark structure of Collegiate Gothic stone architecture for the \"capstone of Baltimore's public education\": The Baltimore City College, third oldest public high school in America, when ground was broken and cornerstone laid in 1924. When completed four years later it was the most expensive and elaborate high school built in America at the time\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
