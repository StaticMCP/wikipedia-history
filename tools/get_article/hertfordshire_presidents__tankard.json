It was first introduced during the 2010–11 season, with the inaugural winners being St Albans.  It is the second most important rugby union cup competition in Hertfordshire, behind the Hertfordshire Presidents' Cup but ahead of the Hertfordshire Presidents' Trophy.\nThe Presidents' Tankard is currently open to the first teams of club sides based in Hertfordshire that play in tier 7 (London 2 North West) and tier 8 (London 3 North West) of the English rugby union league system.  The format is a knockout cup with a preliminary round, first round, semi-finals and a final to be held at Allianz Park (Saracen's home ground) in April–May, on the same date and same venue as the Cup and Trophy finals.\nHertfordshire Presidents' Tankard winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"|\n{| border=\"0\" style=\"width:100%;\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n|  style=\"width:20%; border:0;\"|\n| style=\"border:0;\"|'''Hertfordshire Presidents' Tankard Finals'''\n|  style=\"width:20%; border:0;\"|\n|}\n|-\n!  style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Season\n!  style=\"background:#efefef\"|Winner\n!  style=\"background:#efefef\"|Score\n!  style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Runners–up\n!  style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Venue\n|- align=left\n|-\n| 2009-10 || St Albans || || Hitchin || Cotlandswick, London Colney, Hertfordshire\n|-\n| 2010-11 || Welwyn || 29-13 || Harpenden || Cotlandswick, London Colney, Hertfordshire\n|-\n| 2011-12 || St Albans || 42-7 || Stevenage Town ||\n|-\n| 2012-13 || Tabard || 41-14 || Welwyn || Chaulden Lane, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire\n|-\n| 2013-14 || Fullerians || 15-3 || Datchworth || Coningesby Drive, Watford, Hertfordshire\n|-\n| 2014-15 || Welwyn || 47-12 || Stevenage Town || Allianz Park, Hendon, London\n|-\n| 2015-16 || Datchworth || 31-24 || Stevenage Town || Allianz Park, Hendon, London\n|-\n| 2016-17 || Stevenage Town || 36-7 || Welwyn || Allianz Park, Hendon, London\n|-\n| 2017-18 || Hemel Hempstead || 46-20 || Datchworth || Allianz Park, Hendon, London\n|-\n| 2018-19 || St Albans ||\n|-\n|}\nNumber of wins\n*St Albans (3)\n*Welwyn (2)\n*Datchworth (1)\n*Fullerians (1)\n*Hemel Hempstead (1)\n*Stevenage Town (1)\n*Tabard (1)\nSee also\n* Hertfordshire RFU\n* Hertfordshire Presidents' Cup\n* Hertfordshire Presidents' Trophy\n* English rugby union system\n* Rugby union in England\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.hertsrugby.co.uk Hertfordshire RFU]"
