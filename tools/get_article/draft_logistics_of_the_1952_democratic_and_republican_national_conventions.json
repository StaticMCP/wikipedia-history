The Republicans met July 7–11, while the Democrats met July 21–26.\nWhile the parties selected the location of their conventions separately, they had expressed advance interest in sharing a convention site in order to lower costs (as they had done for the previous two presidential elections). While six cities formally bid, by the time the choice for each convention was made the competition had narrowed with only Chicago and Philadelphia being considered by the parties. Chicago prevailed first at securing the Republican convention, and secured the Democratic convention several weeks after that.\nThe conventions were the first United States presidential nominating conventions to be televised in real-time nationwide. The Democrats adapted their convention last-minute to eliminate several aspects that had  come across unflattering for Republicans during their convention. Among advents introduced due to television was the Democrats' use of a speech teleprompter. The International Amphitheatre was the site of the conventions instead of the even-larger Chicago Stadium arena (the site of the several most recent conventions previously held in the city) due to the assessment of party leaders that it was more suited for television broadcasting. A major undertaking in preparation for the convention was the installation of an expensive and powerful air conditioning system at the International Amphitheatre, making the 1952 conventions the first major party presidential nominating conventions to be held inside of an air conditioned venue.\nImportant aspects of the conventions' logistics included arranging overnight hotel accommodations, transportation, finances, and the provision of entertainment for conventiongoers.\nSelection of Chicago as a host city\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/920283726\nOverview of bids\nSix cities formally submitted bids (Chicago, Illinois; Kansas City, Missouri; Miami, Florida; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Los Angeles, California; and San Francisco, California). Initially, Atlantic City, New Jersey and Detroit, Michigan had indicated their interest in hosting, but both abandoned their efforts without submitting a formal bid. Kansas City and Miami only sought to host the Democratic convention, while the four other cities indicated their interest in hosting either or both conventions. Chicago and Philadelphia were the finalist bid cities, with Chicago being selected by both parties.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Finalist bid cities\n|-\n! City !!

This was in large part due to its relatively central geographic location and its accessibility by railroad. Chicago would remain a frequent convention host until after the 1968 Democratic National Convention, ultimately hosting 25 major party conventions over the course of the 29 presidential elections that took place in that time. Subsequent to 1968, Chicago has been the host city for two further conventions (the 1996 and 2024 Democratic conventions). https://www.chicagobusiness.com/crains-forum-chicago-dnc-2024-and-beyond/chicago-has-long-been-premier-site-political-conventions\nPrior to 1860, Baltimore, Maryland had been the most-preferred location for presidential conventions due to its close proximity to the U.S. national capitol of Washington,  D. C., where many convention delegates worked. However, with the advent of railways as a dominant mode of transportation, after 1860 Chicago supplanted it. https://www.newspapers.com/image/560433557  Before 1952, Chicago had previously hosted 19 major party presidential conventions (seven Democratic and twelve Republican). It also hosted the notable 1912 and 1916 conventions of the Progressive/\"Bull Moose\" Party. It would subsequent to the 1952 conventions go on to be the host of a further five major party conventions (1956 DNC, 1960 RNC, 1968 DNC, 1996 DNC, and 2024 DNC).\nChicago's infrastructure (extensive supply of hotels, dining, and entertainment venues; and its robust transportation) was regarded to make it a strong convention host city. It was noted to have a much easier time accommodating party conventions than cities such as Philadelphia that were comparatively were less physically suited for hosting such sizable events. Cities such as Philadelphia had to make a greater effort to accommodate the logistical needs of such conventions than Chicago did. In their late-April presentation, Chicago offered the availability of accommodations superior to those offered by any of the other bidding cities. Chicago promised that (at minimum) 8,000 first-class hotel rooms in the city's downtown would be available. They also promised that hotel rooms would be available at their standard rates, noting that there was an overall supply of 135,400 hotel rooms in the city. It also proposed use of the 20,000-seat capacity Chicago Stadium arena (recently used by both parties for their 1944 conventions) as the convention hall. Chicago's bid representatives also highlighted that the city was highly accessible from the rest of the nation by passenger rail and passenger airlines.\nIn its previous conventions of 1944, Chicago had locally raised a total of $350,000 to stage the conventions, of which each convention receiving an equal division of $175,000. However, at the time that the Chicago bid committee first presented its bid in late-April, they offered no specifically financial sum, only making a promise that they would give a definite sum of their financial pledge within two weeks time. The committee noted that they had scheduled a May 2 luncheon to secure pledges and contributions. When layer presenting to the Republicans before their decision on a host city, Chicago’s bid delegation promised that the city could raise as much as $250,000 for a Republican convention if necessary, and could further raise an additional $250,000 if both parties were ton select Chicago (a total sum of $500,000). Chicago had no funds immediately available, but promised to sign \"letter of guarantee\" (promissory note) to provide funding. https://www.newspapers.com/image/178117722\nChicago's initial bid presentations in late-April were delivered by a delegation featuring Illinois DNC committeeman Jacob Arvey, Illinois RNC committeeman Werner W. Schroeder, U.S. Senator Paul Douglas, and Chicago Convention Bureau director Chester A. Wilkins.\nChicago named the weeks of June 30, July 7, and July 20 as weeks in which the city would be able to accommodate national conventions.\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania (finalist bid city)\nBefore 1952, Philadelphia had hosted __ previous major party conventions (including one for the since-defunct Whig Party). The city would go on to host two further conventions decades later (2000 RNC and 2016 DNC).\nWalter Annenberg chaired Philadelphia’s bid committee. In late-April, he made the city's initial presentations to the party subcommittees alongside bid committee's vice chair Frank B. Murdoch. For the presentation to Republicans, they were accompanied by Pennsylvania's RNC committeeman, Mason Owlett. For the presentation to Democrats, they were accompanied by David L. Lawrence (the states DNC committeeman), as well as former U.S. Senator Francis J. Myers and Philadelphia Democratic City Committee chairman James A. Finnegan.\nOther prominent individuals publicly had indicated their support for the city's bid effort in advance of the presentations, including Pennsylvania Republican state chairman M. Harvey Taylor, Pennsylvania Democratic state chairman Maurice Splain, Philadelphia Republican City Committee chairman William J. Morrow, U.S. attorney Gerald A. Gleeson, Republican Philadelphia mayor Bernard Samuel, Republican governor John S. Fine, Republican U.S. senators Edward Martin and James H. Duff, Democratic U.S. congressman William T. Granahan, as well as Republican U.S. congressmen Hardie Scott and Hugh D. Scott. Such supporters advanced several arguments about Philadelphia's suitability as a host. One argument was that Philadelphia's strong associations with the American Revolution would give its selection as a host site strong symbolism. Mayor Samuel argued that Philadelphia had extensive transit connections through trunk line railways, airline service, and arterial highways. He especially stressed its convenient proximity to Washington, D.C.\n]]\nIn its initial late-April presentation, Philadelphia's bid committee promised the availability 6,000 hotel rooms in the city. These would include 4,500 first-class downtown hotel rooms (far fewer than the number of first-class rooms Chicago had offered) and a further 1,500 \"good\" rooms. This included dormitories at the University of Pennsylvania and Temple University. The committee also promised the availability of a futher 1,200 hotel rooms in the outlying parts of Greater Philadelphia.  Unlike Chicago's bid committee, Philadelphia's was unable to assure standard rates for its hotel rooms. Instead, they predicted that hotel rooms would likely be available at 25% to 50% above their standard rates. For a convention hall, they proposed the use of the 13,000-seat capacity Philadelphia Convention Hall and Civic Center, the venue of the 1948 conventions. The presenters also were assisted by Philadelphia convention bureau executive director Ben Shelman.\nIn 1948, Philadelphia had locally provided a total of $400,000 to fund the conventions, with each party receiving $200,000. In its April 28 presentation to the parties, Philadelphia's bid committee pledged to provide $250,000 per convention (for a total of $500,000 if both parties selected the city). The cost of materials and construction had increased since 1948. In its final presentation to the Republicans in May, Philadelphia increased this pledge to $285,000 in funding, with $250,000 to be immediately given if Philadelphia were awarded hosting rights and an additional $35,000 to be given at a later date. The additional $35,000 would be allocated to fund the staging of entertainment for delegates during the convention. Annenberg argued that Philadelphia was best suited to host the convention in part because it had more coaxial television cables than Chicago. When presenting to Democrats, Philadelphia's committee again promised that it would immediately make $250,000 in funds available to stage the convention, while Chicago was again only promising a \"letter of guarantee” to provide funding at a subsequent date. https://www.newspapers.com/image/178117722\nPhiladelphia declared that it would be able to host conventions any point between mid-June and mid-July.\nPhiladelphia is located on the East Coast of the United States. In 1948, some West Coast Republicans had complained of the travel expenses required for them to attend a convention held on the East Coast. https://www.newspapers.com/image/564492249\nPhiladelphia later hosted the 2000 RNC and the 2016 DNC.\nKansas City (submitted bid for DNC)\nKansas City, Missouri (the past host of the 1900 DNC and 1928 RNC)\nKansas City would later host one further major party  convention (the 1976 RNC).\n____\nLos Angeles, California (submitted bids for both)\nLos Angeles' bid committee telegraphed both parties is bid to host one or both convention. Trading on the city's prominent celebrity culture, it promised that conventions in Los Angeles would see \"star-studded nights.\" It also pledged it would raise $200,000 per convention, $400,000 overall if both conventions were held in the city.\nLos Angeles is located on the West Coast of the United States. Parties had up through 1952 rarely held their conventions west of the Mississippi River. The Republican Party had only once held a convention west of the Mississippi (their 1928 convention in Kansas City, Missouri), while the Democrats had only done so four times (1900 in Kansas City, Missouri; 1908 in Denver, Colorado; 1920 in San Francisco, California; and 1924 in Houston, Texas).  https://www.newspapers.com/image/560433557 Los Angeles had never previously been the host of a major party presidential convention. It would go on to host two (1960 DNC and 2000 DNC).\nMiami, Florida (submitted bid for DNC)\nMiami bid to host the Democratic convention, submitting no bid for the Republican convention. This weakened its prospects, as both parties were highly interested in reducing expenses by sharing a host city. In the era of Solid South politics, Miami's bid committee had no expectation that Republicans would entertain holding their convention in the Southern United States, and therefore opted not to bid at all for their convention.\nMiami's bid was actually a bid for Greater Miami to play host, and would have seen the convention hosted by both Miami and nearby Miami Beach. The delegation that presented Miami's bid to the Democratic National Committee site selection subcommittee included several members of Florida's congressional delegation along with Miami Beach mayor Harold Turk, Miami mayor William M. Wolfarth, Miami city manager Chelsie J. Senerchia, and both cities' directors of publicity.\nMiamia's bid committee pledged that it would raise $300,000 to host the Democratic convention. An additional $50,000 would be made available to fund entertainment. It also promised that 15,000 hotel rooms could be made available at standard rates.\nMiami had never previously hosted any major party presidential convention. It would go on to host three later conventions (1968 RNC, 1972 DNC, and 1972 RNC).\nSan Francisco, California (submitted bids for both)\nSan Francisco is located on the West Coast of the United States. Parties had up through 1952 rarely held their conventions west of the Mississippi River. The Republican Party had only once held a convention west of the Mississippi, while the Democrats had only done so four times.  https://www.newspapers.com/image/560433557\nSan Francisco had been the host of one previous major party convention (1920 DNC). It would subsequently go on to host three further conventions (1956 RNC, 1964 RNC, and 1984 DNC).\nAtlantic City, New Jersey (withdrew)\nAtlantic City had initially intended to bid for both conventions, proposing Boardwalk Hall as the main venue and touting the city's hotels. The city had never before hosted a convention, though it had previously sought to. Challenges securing the needed $250,000 to $300,000 advanced funding was an obstacle to Atlantic City's prospective bid. https://www.newspapers.com/image/918941300\nThe city would later go on to host the 1964 DNC.\nDetroit, Michigan (withdrew)\nDespite Detroit having been expected to send a delegation to Washington, D.C. to bid, it withdrew at the last minute and instead told each party that it was eager to host their subsequent conventions in 1956. Before it withdrew, its effort had been backed both of Michigan's U.S. Senators (Republican Homer S. Ferguson and Democrat Blair Moody) as well as Detroit convention bureau chief Carl Sedan.\nDetroit had never previously been the host of a major party presidential convention. It would later host the 1980 RNC. https://www.mlive.com/news/2016/07/a_look_back_at_michigans_only.html\nPresentations to site committees\nOn April 28, 1951, six cities presented each party's site committees (subcommittees of each parties' national committees) with formal bids to host one or both conventions. At this point in the bid process, the parties were not asking for the full and final specs of each city's proposals, but rather were merely asking to be provided with key details (including how much money they could promise would be locally fundraised to stage the conventions and how many hotel rooms would be available for use as overnight accommodation by conventiongoers). Both parties had required that their host city be able to provide a sizable meeting hall and a guarantee of between 8,000 and 10,000 hotel rooms.\nThe motivation for cities in bidding to host the nominating conventions was a belief that the convention visitors generated substantial additional commerce in host cities. Due to the anticipated benefit to local commerce, convention expenses were typically funded through contributions donated by local businessmen.\nThe six cities that formally submitted bids were Chicago, Illinois; Kansas City, Missouri; Miami, Florida; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Los Angeles, California; and San Francisco, California. On April 28, some of these cities (Los Angeles, Kansas City, San Fransisco) formally submitted their interest by telegram, while others submitted their interest that day by having delegations meet in-person with the party subcommittees (Chicago, Philadelphia, Miami). Kansas City and Miami only sought to host the Democratic convention, while the four other cities indicated their interest in hosting either or both conventions. The in-person presentations were heard by each party's site selection subcommittees at the Mayflower Hotel. Chicago and Philadelphia were seen as the front-runners in the field bidding to host the conventions. Over the previous 20 years, the two cities had been the most frequent cities to host major party presidential conventions. By the following day, it had been determined by each party that they had narrowed their selection down to the bids received from Chicago and Philadelphia.\nWhile neither party had formally committed to both selecting the same host city as the other party, both had already indicated their interest in doing so to save money. Officials of both parties additionally expressed that they expected all bidding cities to bid for both conventions, rather than seeking only one of them. The two parties had held their conventions in the same cities during the previous two elections, with both parties meeting in Chicago in 1944 and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1948.\nThe location of the conventions was regarded as having possible impacts on the chances of prospective candidates for each party's nominations. The choice of host city was seen as a possible early proxy battle in the campaign for the Republican nomination. Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio –one of the leading Republican contenders– was rumored to prefer a Chicago convention. It was rumored that Taft believed Chicago to be a friendlier host city towards his candidacy than Philadelphia. The Chicago Tribune (a major Chicago daily newspaper) supported his candidacy.  Taft had a poor track record with Philadelphia conventions, as his two previous unsuccessful presidential candidacies had seen him lose at conventions held that city (the 1940 RNC and 1948 RNC). In contrast, he had seen somewhat better luck in Chicago, as at the 1944 RNC in Chicago (a year in which Taft opted against running) his endorsed candidate (John W. Bricker) secured the consolation prize of the vice presidential nomination. If incumbent president Harry S. Truman were to seek re-election at the Democratic Convention, the location was not expected to have much impact on his chances as he had previously been nominated at conventions in both cities (receiving the vice presidential nomination at the 1940 DNC in Chicago and the presidential nomination at the 1944 DNC in Philadelphia). However, if he forewent nomination, U.S. Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois (a possible candidate) was regarded to have his chances aided by if the convention were held in his home state.\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/178117722\nThe Republican National Committee scheduled its decision on a host city and convention dates to be made by a vote at its mid-May 1951 meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma. By late-April, the Democrats had not specifically determined the time or place of their selection vote, only having slated it to occur sometime in late May or early June 1951.\nSite selection votes\nThe final presentation of bids for the convention included financial pledges for covering the costs of staging the convention.\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/560433557\nRepublican site selection vote\nAhead of the Republican National Committee's vote, a six-member site committee met in late-April with representatives from the six cities that had indicated an interest in hosting its convention. The site committee was chaired by Congressman B. Carroll Reece of Tennessee. Other site committee members included Margaret Adams Rockwell of Arizona, Gladys Coffin of the District of Columbia, Martha D. Bauer of Illinois, Irene Peyton of Washington, and Frank J. Sulloway of New Hampshire.\nAs scheduled, Republicans made their selection at their May 1951 meeting, choosing Chicago. https://www.newspapers.com/image/564492249\nAhead of the final selection, the sub-committee for the Republican National Committee made it known that they wanted the host city to provide a written guarantee that it would provide $125,000 in convention funding by December  1952; a further $125,000 in funding by March 1, 1952; and a further guarantee to pay for pre-convention meetings of the convention's arrangements committee.\nOn May 10, 1951 the seven members of the Republican Party subcommittee tasked with reviewing bids unanimously voted to recommend  that the party select Chicago as host. However, it was clear that Philadelphia would still stage a strong fight for hosting rights ahead of the meeting’s floor vote to decide the host city.\nThe full Republican National Committee voted ________ to select Chicago\nThe selection vote was part of a Republican National Committee's meeting held in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The Parsons Sun reported that the vote in Tulsa marked the first time that the Republican National Committee had assembled in \"a southern state and an almost traditionally Democratic state to select a national convention site,\" and noted the unusual choice for the party to gather in Tulsa had generated some curiosity and speculation in political circles about whether Republicans saw potential of winning elections in Oklahoma. https://www.newspapers.com/image/69246828\nDemocratic site selection vote\nOn May 25, 1951, the Democratic National Committee met in Denver to select their convention's site. https://www.newspapers.com/image/178117722\nChicago argued that by staging the Democratic convention in the same city that would be staging the Republican convention, the Democrats would save $50,000 in expenses. https://www.newspapers.com/image/178117722\nPhiladelphia mayor Bernard Samuel led the delegation that presented the city’s pitch to the Democrats before their decision. Other members in the city's delegation included Genevieve Blatt. https://www.newspapers.com/image/178117722\nThe Democratic National Committee voted 84–16 to select Chicago as the site of its convention.\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/511038260\nScheduling\nOn May 10, 1951 , the seven-member subcommittee of the Republican Party unanimously voted not only to recommend Chicago be selected as the site of convention, but to also recommend that the convention be held on July 21. This was later into the year than the party had ever held a presidential convention, and was seen as likely to face opposition from Republican National Committee members. The subcommittee justified its recommendation of a July date by arguing that the convention should be held after Indiana’s state Republican convention, which was scheduled to commence on June 28.\nIn a compromise two days later, the Republican National Committee voted 88–11 to approve holding the convention on the week of July 7. https://www.newspapers.com/image/41892921\nThe Democrat convention was thereafter scheduled to be held the week of\ntwo weeks after the Republican convention.\nAs was typical at the time, these dates meant that the Republican Party convention occurred before the Democratic convention. https://www.newspapers.com/image/560433557 From 1864 through 1952, the Republican Party had held its convention at an earlier date than the Democrats in every election except 1888. The main motivation for the Republicans holding their 1952 convention before the Democrats held theirs is unclear: it is possible it was due to Republicans having almost always held theirs before the Democrats, or it is possible it was more motivated in difference to the Democrats being the party of the incumbent president.\nIn 1956, the incumbent Republicans held their convention a later date than the Democratic convention. It has since become an informal tradition that the party with White House incumbency hosts their convention at a later date than the other major party, but it is unclear if this had become the tradition by 1952. Democrats had held presidential incumbency since 1933 by that time, so it is unclear if at any point in that time period the parties reached an understanding that the Democrats should get the later convention date due to presidential incumbent, or if their conventions were simply held at the later date due to the it being a long-standing convention that the Democrats would held their convention after the Republicans.\nThe Republicans were still working on finalizing timetables for the convention proceedings mere days prior to the convention's opening.\nBroadcasting\nand his wife Mamie watching a television during the convention]]\nThe conventions were the first political conventions to be televised live, coast-to-coast. Previously, since 1924, the primary means which Americans received gavel-to-gavel rolling coverage of presidential nominating conventions had been broadcast radio.\nExperiments in regional broadcasting  of conventions had occurred place during both the Republican and Democrats conventions in 1948; however, 1952 was the first year in which networks carried nationwide coverage of political conventions.\nThe FCC ruled that the equal-time rule obligated networks to allocate equal time between coverage of candidates, but not equal time between parties themselves. On July 5 (in the lead-up to the Republican convention), Estes Kefauver (a declared candidate for the Democratic nomination) showed up at the Conrad Hilton (today known as the Hilton Chicago) in order to take advantage of the equal-time rule, as television networks that had a presence at the hotel had promised Kefauver matching time for coverage that they had given to an event Dwight D. Eisenhower (a declared Republican candidate) had held in Abilene, Kansas. Kefauver fit this visit into a midwest campaign tour.\nTelevision broadcasting of floor proceedings\nand John Daly commentating for ABC's convention coverage in 1952]]\nThe main venue for the conventions was moved from the Chicago Stadium arena (where the most recent previous conventions in Chicago had been staged) to the International Amphitheatre upon the judgement of party leaders that the latter was a better-suited venue for television broadcasts.\nDuring the Republican convention, fixed cameras were placed at the back and the sides of the International Amphitheatre for the press to use collectively. None of these offered a straight shot of the podium on stage, so many networks supplemented their coverage with shots from their own portable cameras.\nThe Republican convention saw criticism of the habit of many politicians of posing for photographers directly in front of the stage while another person was delivering a speech on the stage.\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/1059750967\nThe impact of the Republican Convention broadcast was an immediate one. After carefully watching the Republican Convention, the Democratic Party made last-minute alterations to their convention held in the same venue to make their broadcast more appealing to television audiences. They constructed a tower in the center of the convention hall to allow for a better shot of the podium, and Democrats exercised more control over camera shots and the conduct of delegates in front of the cameras. On the first day of the convention, organizers placed slips of paper on the seats of all delegates cautioning then, \"You will be on television. 140,000,000 eyes will watch you. Remember –you may not know it– Television may be showing a close-up picture of you!\"\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/440291019\nDemocratic teleprompter https://www.newspapers.com/image/1010452021\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/506689154\nMakeup artists https://www.newspapers.com/image/393574888\nAt the subsequent 1956 conventions, the medium of television would further affect both party's conventions. Conventions would be compacted in length that year, with daytime sessions being largely eliminated and the amount of welcoming speeches and parliamentary organization speeches being decreased (such as seconding speeches for vice-presidential candidates, which were eliminated). Additionally, beginning that year conventions were given overlying campaign themes, and their sessions were scheduled in order to maximize exposure to prime-time audience. To provide a more telegenic broadcast, convention halls were decked out in banners and other decorations, and television cameras were positioned at more flattering angles.\nBroadcasting of committee hearings\nThe Republican Party received criticism for its initial refusal to allow for the hearings before the credentials subcommittee to be televised. This changed after the subcommittee voted on July 8 to allow for televising of its hearings and deliberations, https://www.newspapers.com/image/128988318 That day, for the first time in history, television cameras captured the hearings of a presidential convention's credential committee.https://www.newspapers.com/image/154509457  https://www.newspapers.com/image/821235047  The committee also voted to hold its deliberations in open session, rather than the traditional closed-session. The Associated Press heralded the televising of these deliberations as bringing much greater transparency to a previously closed-off process. https://www.newspapers.com/image/154509457\nBelieving that it would be to his best benefit, Democratic candidate Estes Kefauver called for the Democratic party to allow full television and radio coverage of both the convention floor action and other important party meetings. On the eve of the Democratic convention’s own credentials subcommittee hearings (scheduled to be held July 17), Democratic National Committee chairman Frank E. McKinney announced that the Democratic party would allow full press, radio, and television coverage of its convention credentials hearings. The Democratic Party also made the hearings of its platform committee open to the media (including television and radio). These were of interest to the public, in part because of the anticipated deliberation on a civil rights plank.\nRelated television broadcasts from Chicago during convention\nDuring the Democratic convention, the DuMont Television Network had its public affairs program Keep Posted film in Chicago instead of its normal broadcast studio.\nRadio broadcasting\nProtests by Radio Writers Guild and Authors League of America  https://www.newspapers.com/image/433577658\nEdward R. Murrow provided news reports for the CBS Radio Network. Russ Van Dyke of CBS' Iowa affiliate KRNT also provided reporting from the convention.\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/323100681\nTelecommunications\nThe Illinois Bell Telephone Company set up a telephone message center for use by delegates, which also featured walkie-talkie service for use in emergencies.\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/1010451892\nDuring both conventions the Conrad Hilton (today known as the Hilton Chicago) received busy telephone traffic, due to its use as both the convention and media headquarters, as well as as the location of hotel accommodations for many delegates and reporters. It was reported that during the Republican convention, its telephone switchboards received more traffic than it ever had before; peaking with traffic as high as 4,000 calls in a single hour. In anticipation of the increase in calls being placed from the hotel from during the convention, additional phone booths had been installed for outgoing calls to be made from.\nConvention leadership and host committees\nRepublican leadership and host committee\nDemocratic leadership and host committee\nNeal Roach served as the pre-convention manager overseeing Democratic convention preparations. At the time of the convention, Frank E. McKinney was chairman of the Democratic National Committee and Lawrence Westbrook was assistant chairman. Leslie L. Biffle (the secretary of the United States Senate) served as the convention's sergeant-at-arms.\nFinances\nPreparation of the International Amphitheatre\nVenue specs\nThe most recent presidential conventions in Chicago had been held at the Chicago Stadium arena. However, with the new advent of television broadcasting, it was decided to hold the 1952 conventions at the International Amphitheatre arena. While the venue was smaller in capacity than the Chicago Stadium, the leaders of the parties believed that it was better suited for television broadcasting. While it had a lower capacity than the Chicago Stadium,  the 12,000 seat capacity International Amphitheatre was still among the world's largest-capacity arenas. It sat 4,500 attendees on the arena floor, and 7,500 in its mezzanine and balcony seats. It had dining facilities that could feed 3,000 individuals simultaneously. The arena portion of the building was  by  and had a ceiling that rose  above the arena floor.\nThe International Amphitheatre stood (by different measures)  or  southwest of the Chicago Loop (the central business district of Chicago). It was located at the gateway of the Union Stock Yards, at the time that largest stockyard in the world. The arena was owned by the Union Stockyard and Transit Company, who also owned the stockyards. It was expected that the stockyards would be toured by some of the delegates during their convention visit to Chicago.\nThe venue featured an organ, which was utilized at times during the conventions to provide music.\nInstallation of air conditioning\nA major improvement made to the arena in preparation for the conventions was the installation of an air conditioning system. The 1952 presidential conventions were the first in history and that convention was therefore not air conditioned.}} to be held in an air conditioned venue. The air conditioning system installed by the arena's operator was one of the reasons that the parties chose to hold their conventions there instead of the larger-capacity Chicago Stadium.\nThe arena's air conditioning system, manufactured by Carrier, utilized more than  of cooling coils. The system cost $350,000 to install. It proved advantageous during the Republican convention, when Chicago experienced  weather. The system was described as providing \"cooling equivalent of 2,000,000 pounds of ice daily.\" Its cooling plant was fed water averaging  through two wells dug  into the ground. The two machines of the cooling system each weighed 11.5 tons and could pump approximately   of cooled water per minute into the system's cooling coils. The system refreshed the arenas air with air that had been filtered, dehumidified, and cooled. It was reported to completely refresh the air inside of the arena 72 times per day and be capable of reducing the temperature inside the arena up to fifteen degrees below those found outdoors.\nOn July 17, the National Production Authority (NPA) ruled that the Union Stockyard and Transit Company) had illegally used materials in the installation of the system. Approximately 60 tons of steel and approximately  of copper had been utilized, despite the NPA having rejected the company's application for this amount of material in December 1951. The purchase of the materials was characterized as being purchased on the grey market. While this was caught too late to prevent the installation, the NPA could have potentially taken action to prevent the arena operators from making further use of controlled metals, or could have even recommended criminal charges be brought. They could also have sought legal action to order the system removed or sought an immediate injunction to prevent its further use. All such responses by the the NPA were seen as unlikely, particularly any actions that would have prevented its use during the Democratic Convention. The Daily Telegraph & Monday Post noted that such action by an Executive Branch agency ahead of the Democratic convention might have harmed the prospects of a candidate preferred by the Truman Administration prevailing at that convention, as the delegates might harbor greater ire with Truman's federal government if one of the federal agency's were responsible for discomfort during the convention. Instead of such action, the NPA declared that it intended to investigate the matter to see what legal options it had against the Union Stockyard and Transit Company.\nWhile the air conditioning made the interior of the venue comfortable, a unaddressed discomfort for many conventiongoers was the smell outside of it. The pungent smells that emanated from the adjacent Union Stockyards (home to a massive amount of livestock and slaughterhouses), which convention goers had to encounter as their vehicles approached the venue, was considered grotesque by many. This was contrary to assurances from the stockyard ownership, which had released a statement before the Republican convention claiming that, \"contrary to popular belief in some quarters, there is no farm oder at the stockyard.\" The stockyard ownership had assured the public that the convention would not experience an unpleasant odor because their sanitation system was unparalleled, claiming, \"the streets of the yard and alleys between pens, as well as the pens, are as clean as those in a fine residential area.\" Chicago political figures had given pre-convention assurances that any smells related to the stockyards would not be a problem inside the arena, as the air conditioning system would filter them out.\nOther aspects\naddressing the Republican convention]]\nThe arena was regarded to be an attractive-looking and well-appointed convention venue. https://www.newspapers.com/image/179584508\nIn preparation for the convention, crews placed delegate chairs on the floor of the arena, constructed an elevated stage for speakers, set up press working space on the floor, and placed platforms for cameras for television, news photography, newsreels. Also constructed within the arena were radio booths.\nIn late May 1952, the arena was rebranded by its operator as the \"Chicago Convention Building & International Ampitheatre\" in hopes of attracting further convention business after the presidential conventions. Its manager expressing hope that the air conditioning system installed for the presidential conventions would make the venue attractive for summertime conventions.\nThe arena was adjacent to the Stock Yards Inn, at the time one of the best-regarded steakhouses in the United States. This was anticipated to be a popular dinning spot for delegates during the convention. Also nearby was the famous Saddle and Sirloin Club steakhouse.\nInside the convention hall, high prices were charged for concessions, including 75 cents for plain beef sandwiches and 15 cents for Coke (at a time when the standard price for a Coke was 5 cents).\nThe arena was adorn with blue drapes ahead of the Republican convention. Ahead of the Democratic convention, some decorations were changed. The Democrats, for instance, added portraits of presidents Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Harry S. Truman.\nTicket distribution\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/511078653\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/129110528\nIt was noted that few tickets were able to be made available to members of the general public. For instance, both conventions each only gave the host state of Illinois less than 200 spectator tickets to distribute.\nHotels\noutside of the Palmer House Hotel, photographed at some point in 1952]]\nThe conventions were anticipated each to attract 20,000 visitors to Chicago (a total of 40,000), therefore requiring a significant number of hotel rooms for overnight accommodation. https://www.newspapers.com/image/370755351 Chicago had a large number of hotels, having more than of 135,000 hotel rooms. These included the 2,600-room Conrad Hilton Hotel (the world's largest hotel at the time), the 2,300-room Palmer House, https://www.newspapers.com/image/429679685, the 1,000 room Congress Hotel, https://www.newspapers.com/image/370755351 and the Morrison Hotel (the tallest hotel in the United States at the time). The Greater Chicago Hotel Association had 118 member hotels in the Chicago market, including suburban hotels. https://www.newspapers.com/image/370755351\nOn the opening day of the Republican convention, hotel operators estimated that for every delegate there were 30 non-delegate convention-related visitors, estimating that there were roughly 1,000 delegates and 30,000 other visitors drawn by the convention.  https://www.newspapers.com/image/1026782145\nThe Greater Chicago Hotel Association reported in the month prior to the conventions that hotels in the Chicago Loop (the central business district of Chicago) were booked at 100% occupancy during the conventions. https://www.newspapers.com/image/370755351\nThe housing committees of each convention coordinated hotel reservations for delegates and many other conventiongoers. https://www.newspapers.com/image/511078653 While their hotel bookings were arranged for them, delegates still needed to pay for the expense of their lodging, in addition to the expense of their transportation and meals. Additionally, delegates were required to pay a portion of their state delegation's expenses, such as stationary and the booking of a headquarters room for their meetings. It was estimated ahead of the convention that Iowa's delegates might each need to pay as much as $1,000 in order to attend the convention. https://www.newspapers.com/image/128860228\nEven before it was known whether president Truman's intended to attend the convention, a sizable number of rooms had already been tentatively reserved at the Blackstone Hotel for him and those that he would be accompanied by if he attended. https://www.newspapers.com/image/755395888\nState delegation headquarters hotels\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ State delegation headquarters hotels\n|-\n! rowspan=2| Hotel !! colspan=2|Republican convention || colspan=2|Democraticdelegations\n|-\n!

Harold Stassen was originally going have his headquarters located at the adjacent Blackstone, but ultimately opened them inside of the Conrad Hilton as well. The Associated Press described Eisenhower, Taft, and Stassen as having \"elaborate headquarters where their supporters can pick up buttons, literature, and a shot of enthusiasm,\" and described Warren's headquarters as \"not quite so fancy\".\neisenhower hq https://www.newspapers.com/image/518476112\nA small fire occurred in the Conrad Hilton during the Republican convention, giving rise to gossip that Taft's campaign was burning evidence of chicanery used to secure Texas delegates. https://www.newspapers.com/image/393574888 For weeks before the convention, Eisenhower's campaign had alleged that there had been a \"steal\" by Taft in Texas' selection of delegates.\nEisenhower's personal quarters during the convention were instead in a suite  at the nearby Blackstone Hotel. https://www.newspapers.com/image/518476112  https://www.newspapers.com/image/385959823 It is from this fifth floor suite that Eisenhower watched the television coverage of the roll call in which he was nominated. https://www.newspapers.com/image/140080981 Taft's personal quarters were in the presidential suite at the Congress Hotel. https://www.newspapers.com/image/385959823\nDemocratic candidate and campaign headquarters\nKefauver located his headquarters at the Conrad Hilton Hotel https://www.newspapers.com/image/569202527 When he arrived in Chicago on July 16, Kefauver held a crowded press conference at the hotel. while Kefauver located his Democratic convention headquarters at the Conrad Hilton Hotel, https://www.newspapers.com/image/569202527  the Sherman House Hotel housed a separate headquarters for the New Jersey Citizens' Committee for Kefauver (a group backing his candidacy). Nine days ahead of the convention, Governor Richard B. Russell formally set up his campaign's headquarters on the ninth floor of the Conrad Hilton, including repurposing space that Taft's campaign had utilized weeks earlier during the Republican convention. Robert S. Kerr, W. Averell Harriman, and other aspiring presidential candidates also had headquarters at the Conrad Hilton.\nWhile Governor Adlai Stevenson II had not made himself a candidate prior to the convention (and claimed outright that he would refuse to be one), https://www.newspapers.com/image/938602388 ahead of the Democratic convention (add citation) a campaign quarters was setup before the convention on the Conrad Hilton's 15th floor by those seeking to draft him. Those leading an effort to nominate India Edwards as vice president also opened a headquarters on the third floor of the hotel.\nConrad Hilton (Hilton Chicago) as convention headquarters\nChicago was the location of what was the largest hotel in the world at the time of the convention, the Conrad Hilton Hotel (today known as the \"Hilton Chicago\"), https://www.newspapers.com/image/569955355  In addition to serving as a headquarters hotel for a number of state delegations, the Conrad Hilton served as a major hub of important activities during both conventions: being the headquarters hotel for both conventions and the The world's largest-hotel at the time, Conrad Hilton Hotel (today known as the \"Hilton Chicago\"), https://www.newspapers.com/image/569955355 was a hub of important activity during both conventions, as well as the location of the media headquarters. _____\nThe Conrad Hilton's management reported that 2,900 of its 3,000 rooms were being were being occupied by politicians or reporters. https://www.newspapers.com/image/1026782145\nThe Conrad Hilton Hotel served as the RNC convention headquarters hotel. https://www.newspapers.com/image/428457179 as well as the DNC convention headquarters hotel. https://www.newspapers.com/image/1015452838\nDuring the Democratic convention, the platform committee held its hearings in one of the medium sized ballrooms of the hotel. These hearings were open to the media and spectators.\nThe Democrats allocated much more space at the hotel to its women's division than the Republicans had allotted to its women's division. During the Republican convention, that party's women's division was only given a single room in the hotel's basement. By contrast, during the Democratic convention, its women's convention was given an entire wing of twelve rooms on an upper floor of the hotel, a large workspace which featured prime views of Lake Michigan.\nMedia headquarters in exhibition hall\nThe hotel's exhibition hall housed the operations of major radio and television networks. https://www.newspapers.com/image/428457179 with a press headquarters being housed in its exhibition hall. The setup required an extensive number of cables for telephone lines, as well as an extensive amount of equipment such as teletype printers. The Democratic National lasted longer than the hotel's management had anticipated, and they began to oust the press from this space on the morning of July 26, as it had been reserved for a July 27 jewelry convention. This resulted in the media that had been working out of this pace moving into the press room at the International Amphitheatre for the remainder of the convention. https://www.newspapers.com/image/900297311\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/429679685\nCongress Hotel as a venue for meetings\nThe Congress Hotel (today known as the Congress Plaza Hotel) was the venue for one of the most notable party functions: the meetings of the convention's credentials subcommittee.

The Associated Press described there being \"scores of policemen inside and outside of the convention hall\" during the Republican convention.\nTransportation\nInter-city\nboarding his flight from Washington, D.C. to Chicago for the convention]]\nChicago was highly connected to much of the nation both by passenger rail and passenger airlines.\nSome delegates and prominent individuals traveled to Chicago by airplane (such as Eleanor Roosevelt and incumbent president Harry S. Truman in their travel to the Democratic convention). Illinois governor Adali Stevenson II (who had been resisting pre-convention efforts to draft him as the party's nominee) arrived in Chicago on a July 18 flight from Springfield (the Illinois state capital) to Chicago's Meigs Field. Upon landing, he gave comments to reporters expressing strong disinterest in being the party's presidential nominee.\nMany conventiongoers arrived by railroad. En route to the convention, Eisenhower conducted a whistle-stop train tour between Denver, Colorado and Chicago. Additionally, the delegation from Oregon arrived in Chicago via the Empire Builder train serving Chicago Union Station. https://www.newspapers.com/image/140062094 Chicago was highly accessible to other parts of the nation by both modes.
