This Sikh institution was founded by Bhai Daya Singh, one of the original Panj Pyare, under the Hukam of Guru Gobind Singh Ji. Under Sant Attar Singh ji's guidance, they dedicated themselves to Seva (selfless service) and Bhagati (spiritual devotion). Both Sant Isher Singh Ji and Sant Kishan Singh Ji succeeded Sant Attar Singh Ji, and through their immense contributions to the Sikh faith, this Samparda came to be known as the Rara Sahib Samparda as well.\nAfter the passing of Sant Attar Singh Ji, Sant Isher Singh Ji and Sant Kishan Singh Ji departed from Gurdwara Reru Sahib and eventually settled in the forests of Rara Sahib. At the request of Sardar Gian Singh Rarewala, they made this once desolate village their spiritual abode. Gurdwara Karamsar became a center of worship and penance for His Holiness Sant Isher Singh Ji and His Holiness Sant Kishen Singh ji, where they tirelessly devoted himself to God. Immersing themselves in Simran and Samadhi (deep meditation) for a long time, they transformed the once-remote forest into what is now known as Gurdwara Karamsar, a revered spiritual center where Sikhs gather to learn, meditate, worship, and engage in Seva (selfless service).\nTo construct the Gurdwara, although most of the land was purchased, a portion of the land was generously donated by nearby villagers,. With its establishment, the sacred recitation of hymns began every morning and evening, and Langar was prepared and served to all. Devotees' enthusiasm grew, leading to the regular observance of Sangrand (monthly gathering) and Pooranmashi (full-moon day) with deep religious devotion and fervor.\nPlaces associated with Rara Sahib Samparda\nOver 100 Gurdwaras around the world are connected to the Rara Sahib Samparda, spanning Punjab, Haryana, the UK, Europe, Africa and North America. These Gurdwaras stand as a testament to the profound legacy and teachings of Sant Isher Singh Ji and Sant Kishern Singh ji, ensuring that the Parchaar of Sikhi continues to flourish across generations.\nSome of the Gurdwaras associated with Rara Sahib Samparda are:\n* Gurdwara Sant Ashram, Dhablan; established in 1954 by Sant Isher Singh ji.\n* Gurdwara Ishersar Sahib, Allowal; This Gurdwara stands in the village where Sant Isher Singh Ji was born.
