He came to prominence in the early 1990s with his direction of the music video for the Snap! song \"Rhythm is a Dancer\". Greenhalgh then was hired by the Pet Shop Boys to direct videos for their successful album Very and later its follow-up Bilingual. His work has also included the video for George Michael's song 'Jesus to a Child', several videos for Muse, Placebo, Soundgarden and others.\nHis videos for Very make extensive and early use of computer animation and blue screen to create environments of geometric shapes and patterns in which the group members Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe are inserted. His clip for the song \"Liberation\" was later reused in the 2000 animation anthology CyberWorld. He later directed the video of Soundgarden's song 'Black Hole Sun', attracting attention in the United States; in 1995, Spin magazine awarded him a reader's choice award for best video for this.\nHe also directed music videos for Sandra for her fifth studio album Close To Seven in 1992.\nDescribing his approach to music video direction, Greenhalgh said in a 2010 interview that \"With anything, it’s the lyrics that are everything. You pray that there are good lyrics in a track because that leads you immediately to what you’re going to do.\"\nVideography\n2024\n* \"2 Become 1\" - Emma Bunton\n2023\n* \"These Are the Days\" - S Club\n2018\n* \"Let Somebody Love You\" – Culture Club\n2017\n* \"Scared of the Dark\" – Steps\n* \"Rhythm Inside\" – Calum Scott\n2011\n* \"Run for Your Life\" – Matt Cardle\n* \"Think About It\" – Melanie C\n2010\n* \"Blue Skies\" – Jamiroquai\n* \"White Knuckle Ride\" – Jamiroquai\n2009\n* \"Devil on My Shoulder\" – Billy Talent\n* \"In My Dreams\" – Eels\n* \"For What It's Worth\" – Placebo\n2007\n* \"Folding Stars\" – Biffy Clyro\n2006\n* \"Bombs\" – Faithless\n* \"Different World\" – Iron Maiden\n* \"I Feel It\" – Lorraine\n* \"Analogue (All I Want)\" – A-ha\n2005\n* \"Don't Look Back\" – Lucie Silvas\n* \"Question!\" – System of a Down (co-directed with Shavo Odadjian)\n* \"Demons\" – Brian McFadden\n2004\n* \"This Is the Last Time\" – Keane\n* \"Caught in a Moment\" – Sugababes\n2003\n* \"Rainmaker\" – Iron Maiden\n* \"Miracles\" – Pet Shop Boys\n* \"Guilty\" – Blue\n* \"Wildest Dreams\" – Iron Maiden\n* \"This Picture\" – Placebo\n* \"On the Horizon\" – Melanie C\n* \"The Bitter End\" – Placebo\n2001\n* \"Destiny\" – Zero 7\n* \"Let's Just Call It Love\" – Lisa Stansfield\n* \"Special K\" – Placebo\n* \"Plug In Baby\" – Muse\n2000\n* \"Slave to the Wage\" – Placebo\n* \"Unintended\" – Muse\n1999\n* \"Lift Me Up\" – Geri Halliwell\n* \"New York City Boy\" – Pet Shop Boys\n* \"Everything Will Flow\" – Suede\n* \"Lately\" – Skunk Anansie\n* \"Beat Mama\" – Cast\n1998\n* \"Wildsurf\" – Ash\n* \"Goodbye\" – Spice Girls\n* \"Jesus Says\" – Ash\n* \"Come with Me\" – Puff Daddy feat.
