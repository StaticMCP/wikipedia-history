It was established around 1781 by Virsinhji, a member of the Solanki Rajput Vansadia clan, and covered an area of approximately 557 km².[1] Bansda was part of the Surat Agency and was recognized as a 9-gun salute state, granting its rulers a degree of autonomy in civil and criminal matters.[2] The rulers of Bansda were members of the Chalukya dynasty, with the Vansadia clan claiming descent from Dhaval, a descendant of Siddharaja Jayasimha, a former ruler of Gujarat.[3][4]\nIn 1893, the Maharawal of Bansda maintained a military force consisting of 24 cavalry, 111 infantry, and 1 gun, reflecting the state’s semi-autonomous status under British suzerainty.[5] Following India’s independence in 1947, Bansda acceded to the Union of India in 1948, integrating into the state of Gujarat.[6]\nThe region is home to a diverse cultural heritage, influenced by both tribal and non-tribal communities. The Dhodia and Kokni tribal groups maintain traditional practices, festivals, and arts unique to the area.[7] Parsi settlers historically contributed to local culture, particularly in commerce, education, and philanthropy, establishing schools, businesses, and charitable institutions during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.[8]\nLocal festivals, such as Navratri, Diwali, and tribal fairs, are celebrated widely, often featuring folk music, dance, and traditional crafts. The blending of tribal customs with Hindu and Parsi influences gives Vansda a distinctive cultural identity within Gujarat. The town also has a history of artisanal crafts and small-scale industries, reflecting skills passed down through generations.\nReferences"
