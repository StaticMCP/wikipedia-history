The election coincided with the election of a U.S. Senator from Delaware and other federal and state offices.

Murphy refused to concede and took to Facebook, saying, “Friends, thanks for all your support- something stinks here and I will not be conceding anytime soon. Need to investigate big time. A Dem wins a Republican primary?” Murphy also called for an investigation into the results. Walker responded by saying that God had led his campaign to victory. Student and community activist Andrew Webb declared his Republican write-in candidacy on September 17, 2018, hoping to gain support from dissatisfied Republicans. He announced a platform of more moderate/traditional conservative ideas.\nLibertarian Party\nCandidates\nEndorsed by Sussex County Chapter\n* Andrew Webb, community activist and student (write-in)\nIndependent Party of Delaware\nCandidates\nWrite-in\n* Andrew Webb, community activist and student\nIndependents\nCandidates\nDeclared\n* Paul Johnston, veteran (write-in)\nWithdrew\n* Christopher Mockerman, activist (running for State House in District 17)\nGeneral election\nEndorsements\nLt.
