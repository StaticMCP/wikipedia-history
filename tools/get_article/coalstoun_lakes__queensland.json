There are various theories as to the origin of the name.\n* One is that Coalstoun is the corruption of an Aboriginal word Goanalganai.\n* Another theory is that the name 'Coalstoun' is a corruption of the word 'Colstoun'.

Colstoun is located south of Edinburgh and remains in the Brown family.  According to Queensland Department of National Parks, Sport and Racing \"The lakes were named after Coalstoun in Scotland by Wade Brun, manager of nearby Ban Ban Station.\" There is no doubt that Nugent Wade Brown and Wade Brun were the same person.
