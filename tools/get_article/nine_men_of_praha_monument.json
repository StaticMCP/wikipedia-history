It was dedicated by U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison on November 11 (Veterans Day), 2002, to commemorate nine soldiers from Praha who died during World War II between February 3, 1944 and February 12, 1945.\nTexas Monthly has called the monument the \"most haunting\" of those installed at the cemetery. In 2008, the magazine's Gary Cartwright wrote: \"The cemetery staff recalled vividly the day in 2002 that the stone was dedicated, how nearly the entire township arrived on two chartered buses.\"\nThe memorial honors PFC Rudolf L. Barta, PFC Robert V. Bohuslav, PFC Anton Kresta, Jr., Pvt. Joseph Lev, United States Army, PFC Edward J. Marek, S.SGT George D. Pavlicek, PFC Adolph E. Rab, Pvt. Eddie Sbrusch, and\nPFC Jerry R. Vaculik.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=212222 The Nine Men of Praha] at the Historical Marker Database\n* [https://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMPY9B_The_Nine_Men_of_Praha_Texas_State_Cemetery_Austin_TX The Nine Men of Praha -- Texas State Cemetery, Austin TX] at Waymarking"
