The population as of the 2020 census was 121. It lies along U.S. Route 220 near the center of the county. Warm Springs includes the historical mill town called Germantown. To the west lies West Warm Springs.\nHistory and geography\nThe community grew up around the courthouse and the nearby Jefferson Pools. The Bath County Health Department, Sheriff's Department, and other county offices are located adjacent to the courthouse. The Warm Springs Post Office handles mail for the 24484 zip code. Other notable landmarks in Warm Springs are the Bath County Historical Society and the Waterwheel Restaurant, which is located inside of a converted mill. Warm Springs Gallery, located just downhill from the courthouse, specializes in contemporary fine art.
