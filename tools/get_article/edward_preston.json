He became a citizen of the Kingdom of Hawaii on 1 April 1871, and was admitted to the bar 5 April 1871. He worked in the offices of Richard H. Stanley in 1875. He was awarded the Royal Order of Kapiolani with rank of grand officer.\nPolitical career\nHe was appointed Attorney General on 3 July 1878 by King Kalākaua, and served until 14 August 1880.\nHe replaced Alfred S. Hartwell.\nIn the 1878, 1880, and 1882 sessions he was in the legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom in the House of Nobles. Working as a clerk for the judge in the legislature was John Mahiʻai Kāneakua who would sign the memorial from the Hawaiian Patriotic league to restore the monarchy in 1893.\nHe was appointed again on 19 May 1882, in the cabinet headed by controversial Walter M. Gibson. Gibson was widely known to be funded by sugar trader Claus Spreckels, who also had many personal loans to Kalākaua. The cabinet approved giving Spreckels a large tract of land on Maui to settle his claim on the crown lands, and an expensive coronation ceremony for Kalākaua.\nGibson became acting attorney general even though he had no law training, on 14 May 1883.\nSupreme Court\nOn 7 July 1885 Preston was appointed to the supreme court of the kingdom under chief justice Albert Francis Judd.\nOne incident that led to the downfall of Gibson was a Chinese planter T. Aki who said he had made a \"gift\" to Kalākaua expecting to receive a license for opium trading. When the license was given to someone else who paid more, Aki wanted to get his money back. This scandal and the other debts of Kalākaua resulted in the 1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii which took away much of the king's power, and a trustee to pay off debts. Preston ruled that Aki had a valid claim, and he should be paid back with the other creditors.\nPreston served on the supreme court until he died 17 January 1890.\nHis funeral was at the St. Andrews Cathedral.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n:\"A List of All the Cabinet Ministers Who Have Held Office in the Hawaiian Kingdom\"\n*\n:Includes a list of Attorneys General for the Kingdom of Hawaii, their salaries and budgets"
