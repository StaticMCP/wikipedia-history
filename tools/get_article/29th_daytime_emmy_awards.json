Hosted by Bob Barker, it was televised in the United States by CBS.  It was also the first time the ceremonies were simulcast in Spanish.\nCreative Arts Emmy Awards were presented on April 29, 2002.\nMistakes\nWhen Susan Flannery's name was announced as the winner of the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series Award, the \"Flannery\" part was unintelligible. Everybody in the television production booth thought it was Susan Lucci who was named, and therefore cut to a shot of Lucci (who was backstage at the time after presenting the previous award), cued the All My Children theme song, and told her to go on stage. Once the producers realized their mistake, they immediately cut to Flannery coming towards the stage, and Lucci returned backstage. The producers apologized for their mistake the following day.\nNominations and winners\nThe following is a partial list of nominees, with winners in bold:\nOutstanding Drama Series\n*All My Children\n*As the World Turns\n*One Life to Live\n*The Young and the Restless\nOutstanding Actor in a Drama Series\n*'Peter Bergman (Jack Abbott, The Young and the Restless)'\n*Hunt Block (Craig Montgomery, As the World Turns)\n*Vincent Irizarry (David Hayward, All My Children)\n*Robert Newman (Joshua Lewis, Guiding Light)\n*Jack Scalia (Chris Stamp, All My Children)\nOutstanding Actress in a Drama Series\n*Martha Byrne (Lily Walsh Snyder, As the World Turns)\n*'Susan Flannery (Stephanie Forrester, The Bold and the Beautiful)'\n*Finola Hughes (Anna Devane, All My Children)\n*Susan Lucci (Erica Kane, All My Children)\n*Colleen Zenk Pinter (Barbara Ryan, As the World Turns)\nOutstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series\n*Mark Consuelos (Mateo Santos, All My Children)\n*'Josh Duhamel (Leo du Pres, All My Children)'\n*Benjamin Hendrickson (Hal Munson, As the World Turns)\n*Paul Leyden (Simon Frasier, As the World Turns)\n*Cameron Mathison (Ryan Lavery, All My Children)\nOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series\n*'Crystal Chappell (Olivia Spencer, Guiding Light)'\n*Beth Ehlers (Harley Cooper, Guiding Light)\n*Kelley Menighan Hensley (Emily Stewart, As the World Turns)\n*Kelly Ripa (Hayley Vaughan, All My Children)\n*Maura West (Carly Snyder, As the World Turns)\nOutstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series\n*Jesse McCartney (JR Chandler, All My Children)\n*Brian Presley (Jack Ramsey, Port Charles)\n*Justin Torkildsen (Rick Forrester, The Bold and the Beautiful)\n*Jordi Vilasuso (Tony Santos, Guiding Light)\n*'Jacob Young (Lucky Spencer, General Hospital)\nOutstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series\n*Jennifer Finnigan (Bridget Forrester, The Bold and the Beautiful)'\n*Jessica Jimenez (Catalina Quesada, Guiding Light)\n*Lindsey McKeon (Marah Lewis, Guiding Light)\n*Eden Riegel (Bianca Montgomery, All My Children)\n*Kristina Sisco (Abigail Williams, As the World Turns)\nOutstanding Drama Series Writing Team\n*All My Children\n*As the World Turns\n*One Life to Live\n*Passions\nOutstanding Drama Series Directing Team\n*All My Children\n*As the World Turns\n*The Bold and the Beautiful\n*The Young and the Restless\nOutstanding Game/Audience Participation Show\n*Hollywood Squares\n*Jeopardy!\n*The Price Is Right\n*''Win Ben Stein's Money\nOutstanding Game Show Host\n*'Bob Barker, The Price Is Right'\n*Pat Sajak, Wheel of Fortune\n*Ben Stein and Nancy Pimental, Win Ben Stein's Money\n*Alex Trebek, Jeopardy!\nOutstanding Talk Show\n*Live With Regis and Kelly\n*The Montel Williams Show\n*'''The Rosie O'Donnell Show'\n*The View\nOutstanding Talk Show Host\n*'''Rosie O'Donnell, ''The Rosie O'Donnell Show'\n*Regis Philbin and Kelly Ripa, Live With Regis and Kelly\n*Barbara Walters, Meredith Vieira, Star Jones, Joy Behar and Lisa Ling, The View\n*Montel Williams, The Montel Williams Show\nOutstanding Service Show\n*The Christopher Lowell Show\n*Essence of Emeril\n*Martha Stewart Living\n*This Old House\n*Wolfgang Puck\nOutstanding Service Show Host\n*Emeril Lagasse, Essence of Emeril\n*Christopher Lowell, The Christopher Lowell Show\n*'Martha Stewart, Martha Stewart Living'\n*Steve Thomas, This Old House\nOutstanding Special Class Series\n*Behind the Screen with John Burke\n*Cool Women in History with Susan Sarandon\n*Judge Judy\n*Pop-up Video\n*Trading Spaces\nOutstanding Children's Animated Program\n*Arthur\n*Clifford the Big Red Dog\n*Dora the Explorer\n*Dragon Tales\n*Madeline\nOutstanding Special Class Animated Program\n*Batman Beyond\n*The Legend of Tarzan\n*Little Bill\n*Rolie Polie Olie\n*'Gary Baseman, Bill Steinkellner, Cherie Steinkellner, Jess Winfield, Nancylee Myatt, Timothy Björklund, Alfred Gimeno, Jamie Thomason and David Maples (Teacher's Pet)\nOutstanding Sound Editing\n*Greg Stewart, Ian Emberton, Wendy Romano, Tony Gort and Patrick S.
