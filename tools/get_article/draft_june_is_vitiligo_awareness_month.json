The awareness month includes educational campaigns, community-based events, and legislative efforts intended to reduce stigma and support individuals affected by the condition.\nOverview\nVitiligo affects an estimated 1–2% of the global population. Although it is neither contagious nor life-threatening, the condition can lead to psychological and social challenges due to public misconceptions and its visible appearance.\nOrigins and Purpose\nVitiligo Awareness Month was initiated in the state of Georgia, United States, through the efforts of the National Vitiligo Bond Inc. Foundation (NVBIF or Vitiligo Bond). The nonprofit organization was founded in 2010 by Natasha Pierre McCarthy, an educator and advocate living with vitiligo. NVBIF was established to raise awareness, address bullying related to visible differences, and provide community support for individuals living with the condition.\nThe foundation’s mission is to foster acceptance, visibility, and empowerment for people with vitiligo. Through public education, advocacy, and community programming, NVBIF seeks to change perceptions and increase support for those affected.\nPrograms and Initiatives\nSince its founding, NVBIF has organized various educational and outreach programs, including:\n* Vitiligo 101 forums at Emory University\n* School-based anti-bullying initiatives\n* Storytelling and mentorship programs for youth\n* The Vitiligo TouCan 5K, an annual event in Atlanta open to both in-person and virtual participants\nThese initiatives aim to improve public understanding and foster community among individuals affected by vitiligo.\nLegislative Recognition\nIn 2015, former U.S. President Barack Obama acknowledged vitiligo following advocacy efforts by NVBIF—reportedly the first such presidential acknowledgment of the condition.\nAt the state level, Georgia House Resolution 725 was passed in 2025, formally recognizing June as Vitiligo Awareness Month in Georgia and commending the work of NVBIF.\nOn a federal level, U.S. Representative Hank Johnson (GA-04) has introduced multiple resolutions in the House of Representatives to designate October 17 as National Vitiligo Awareness Day, including H.Res. 636 and H.Res. 792.\nThese resolutions highlight the condition’s impact on mental health, especially among children.\nExpansion and Advocacy\nNVBIF has contributed to growing awareness at both national and international levels. The foundation has supported advocates in more than 20 U.S. states in securing gubernatorial proclamations recognizing Vitiligo Awareness Month. These proclamations have served as platforms for local education and advocacy.\nAdditionally, NVBIF’s model has inspired similar awareness efforts abroad, with advocates adapting its approach to fit various cultural contexts.\nWorld Vitiligo Day\nA key observance during Vitiligo Awareness Month is World Vitiligo Day, held annually on June 25. The day was proposed in 2011 by Steve Haragadon and later launched by Ogo Maduewesi, founder of the Nigerian-based Vitiligo Support and Awareness Foundation (VITSAF). The date commemorates the passing of pop icon Michael Jackson, who lived with vitiligo and died on June 25, 2009.\nIn 2012, the Vitiligo Research Foundation (VRF) launched 25june.org to promote World Vitiligo Day and advocate for its recognition by the United Nations.\nCommunity Engagement\nThrough events such as the Vitiligo TouCan 5K Run/Walk, NVBIF has brought together patients, healthcare professionals, families, corporate sponsors, and community advocates. These events emphasize physical wellness, social inclusion, and peer support.\nImpact\nVitiligo Awareness Month has contributed to:\n* Increased public education about the condition\n* Greater emotional and peer support for affected individuals\n* Legislative recognition and policy advocacy\n* Reduced stigma and bullying in schools and communities\nThe observance has evolved from a local advocacy initiative into a broader movement supporting people with vitiligo in the U.S. and internationally.\nSee Also\n* Vitiligo\n* World Vitiligo Day\n* Autoimmune disease\nReferences\n:Category:Drafts about Michael Jackson"
