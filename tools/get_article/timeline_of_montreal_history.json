There, the nation found a \"turtle-shaped island\" marked by miigis (cowrie) shells.\n* The Iroquois, or Haudenosaunee, were centred, from at least 1000 CE, in northern New York, and their influence extended into what is now southern Ontario and the Montreal area of modern Quebec.\n* 1142 – The Iroquois Confederacy is, from oral tradition, said to have been formed in 1142 CE.\n* In the modern Iroquois language, Montréal is called Tiohtià:ke.
