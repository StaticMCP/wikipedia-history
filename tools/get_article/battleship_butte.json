Precipitation runoff from this landform drains to the Green River which flows two miles east of the butte. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises  above the surrounding terrain in 0.4 mile (0.64 km). The butte is composed of sandstone of the Mesaverde Group which was deposited in the Late Cretaceous, and it overlays Mancos Shale of the surrounding terrain. The butte is so named because its profile resembles a battleship. The descriptive toponym has been officially adopted by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names.\nClimate\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification system, Battleship Butte is located in a Cold semi-arid climate zone, which is defined by the coldest month having an average mean temperature below 32&nbsp;°F (0&nbsp;°C), and at least 50% of the total annual precipitation being received during the spring and summer. This desert climate receives less than  of annual rainfall, and snowfall is generally light during the winter. Spring and fall are the most favorable seasons to Battleship Gunnison Butte.\nGallery\nFile:Utah From The California Zephyr.jpg|Cliff Benchmark (left) and Battleship Butte (right) from south\nFile:Battleship Butte seen from The California Zephyr train.jpg|South aspect of Battleship Butte seen from the California Zephyr\nFile:The Book Cliffs near Green River, Utah - NARA - 517709.jpg|East aspect, centered(Cliff Benchmark to left, Blue Castle Butte to right)Photo by William Henry Jackson, circa 1870s\nSee also\n* List of mountains of Utah\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Weather forecast: [https://www.yr.no/en/forecast/daily-table/2-5534794/United%20States/Utah/Emery/Battleship%20Butte Battleship Butte]\n* Battleship Butte: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/zeesstof/7180773450/in/dateposted/ Flickr (photo)]"
