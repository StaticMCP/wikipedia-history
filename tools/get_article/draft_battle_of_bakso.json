He was replaced by Dajjach Terfe Kassa, which sparked anger among the population. The situation worsened when Terfe and his forces began disarming the people by force. What action was to be taken against Terfe was preplanned. While some peasants loyal to Sebhatu beat Terfe with clubs, others shot at his troops. He died from the beating, and fighting continued in which the local rebel groups defeated Italian banda troops, captured the arms collected from the population and other weapons surrendered by the enemy and fled to the jungle.\nAs the rebels intensified their attacks on Italian soldiers, such as during the Battle of Yezora in August 1937, where the patriot forces of Dajjazmach Mangasha Jambare decisively defeated the Italian troops, and during the Battle of Bakoso, which resulted in Italian soldiers being repulsed from the Gojjame countryside and the capture of arms; the Viceroy of Italian East Africa, Rodolfo Graziani, in his December 1936 report, noted the worsening politico-military situation in the Amhara region, particularly in Gojjam. The viceroy further observed that Gojjam was in rebellion, filled with armed men who obstructed Italian army movements.\nReferences"
