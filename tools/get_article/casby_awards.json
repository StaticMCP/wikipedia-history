CASBY is an acronym for Canadian Artists Selected By You.\nThe awards were first presented in 1981 under the name U-Knows, a pun on Canada's mainstream Juno Awards. The concept was developed by David Marsden, the program director at CFNY at the time, when he heard the Juno nominations announced on CBC Radio, and included was Long John Baldry&nbsp;— who was newly resident in Canada but had already been in the music business for almost 20 years&nbsp;— as most promising vocalist.\nThey were renamed the CASBYs in 1985, after a listener contest. The 1985 ceremony, hosted by Carole Pope and Paul Shaffer, also marked the first time that the awards were broadcast nationally by CBC Television. In the first year, voter ballots were distributed exclusively by the Canadian music magazine Graffiti. In later years the awards expanded the distribution, printing ballots in a number of major market daily newspapers across Canada.\nThe 1987 ceremony featured a rare public performance by XTC, although their performance was videotaped in advance of the ceremony. That year's awards were also marred by several organizational snafus, including the wrong winner being initially announced for Album of the Year.\nThe award's bid for national prominence faltered in the late 1980s, particularly after CFNY's short-lived shift to a more mainstream music format also affected public perception of the awards' identity. During that era, some alienated listeners even picketed the awards ceremony. Beginning in 1993 the awards were pared down to just three categories, and after 1996, amid a sense that the awards had effectively lost their purpose, the awards were discontinued.\nThey were then revived in 2002, and were presented each year until 2017.\nWinners\n1980s\n1981\n* Album of the Year: Teenage Head, Frantic City\n* Single of the Year: Martha and the Muffins, \"Echo Beach\"\n* Group of the Year: Teenage Head\n* Female Vocalist of the Year: Carole Pope (Rough Trade)\n* Male Vocalist of the Year: B.B.
