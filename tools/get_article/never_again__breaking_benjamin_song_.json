The song topped the Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs chart in 2017, the third song from the album to do so, behind \"Failure\" and \"Angels Fall\".\nBackground\nThe song was written during the sessions for Breaking Benjamin's 2015 album release Dark Before Dawn, which saw frontman Benjamin Burnley reforming the band after a multi-year hiatus with an entirely new lineup. While Burnley states that he ended up writing 95% percent of the album alone prior to recruiting the new band lineup, \"Never Again\" was one of the album's few collaborative songs, and the only song to feature input from all members of the new lineup. Newly recruited guitarist Jasen Rauch came in to help Burnley finish the track, writing the song's guitar riff himself, and collaborating on the song's bridge with Burnley.\nThe band first teased a release of a music video for the song on January 9, 2017, before officially releasing it on January 13, 2017. The music video involves a group of three friends who get addicted to a fictional drug that prevents aging. While initially enjoying the effects, it eventually leads them to turn on one another. In the end, all three eventually succumb to their fate and turn to dust dying peacefully, albeit two of them together, and the other (who killed the tree that they used to harvest the drug from which caused them to turn on each other) dying alone.\nComposition and themes\nThe song was described as similar to some of the band's prior music, as a mix of heavy metal and hard rock, and having a \"wonderful dynamic between softer melody driven choruses, the hard-edged crunch of Burnley's guitar and the dirty backing vocals.\"\nPersonnel\n* Benjamin Burnley – lead vocals, rhythm guitar\n* Jasen Rauch – lead guitar\n* Keith Wallen – rhythm guitar, backing vocals\n* Aaron Bruch – bass, backing vocals\n* Shaun Foist – drums\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
