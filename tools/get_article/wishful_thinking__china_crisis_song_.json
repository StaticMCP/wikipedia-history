It reached No. 9 on the UK singles chart in early 1984, becoming their only top 10 hit single in their homeland. The song is their biggest and most well-known hit, and is included on numerous compilation albums. It was a top 20 hit in several European countries and hit number one on the Swedish radio chart Poporama on 8 March 1984.\nThe lead vocals on this track are sung by Eddie Lundon who also wrote the lyrics, as opposed to Gary Daly who sings lead vocals on the majority of the band's songs. The song was inspired by the song \"Here He Comes\" on Brian Eno's fifth solo studio album Before and After Science (1977).\nCritical reception\nSmash Hits characterised the song as \"light and airy pop with a dimple in its cheek\". They called it \"quite pleasant\" but believed that some of the production choices were \"beginning to sound dangerously dated\".\nB-sides\nThe track \"This Occupation\" remains exclusive to this release and appears in two very different forms on the 7\" and 12\" releases. \"Some People I Know to Lead Fantastic Lives\" is taken from the band's debut studio album ''Difficult Shapes & Passive Rhythms, Some People Think It's Fun to Entertain'' (1982), although the remix on this 12\" single remains exclusive to this release.\nTrack listing\n7\" vinyl single\n12\" vinyl single\n| length1      = 4:38\n| title2       = Some People I Know to Lead Fantastic Lives\n| writer2      =\n| length2      = 3:43\n}}\n| length1      = 4:00\n| title2       = Some People I Know to Lead Fantastic Lives (Extended Mix)\n| writer2      =\n| length2      = 6:07\n}}\nChart performance\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
