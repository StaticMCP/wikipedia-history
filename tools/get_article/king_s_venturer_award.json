When the Scout program was divided into Scouts and Venturers, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, the highest award, the Queen's Scout Award, was renamed to reflect its application to the Venturer section. The award is presented to venturers who have acquired competence and skills that will be of considerable use to themselves, their company, and their community. These venturers will have also been recognized by the company, the advisor, and Scouts Canada as being worthy of receiving the award.\nThe King's Venturer Award signifies that a venturer has, in the opinion of those who know the venturer, both the character and ability to be of significant help to others. It consists of a cloth emblem and a parchment certificate, signed by the governor general of Canada, in the official capacity as chief scout of Canada.\nRequirements (pre-Canadian Path)\nA candidate for the King's Venturer Award must meet the following requirements:\n# Hold the Venturer Award or demonstrate equivalent skills and knowledge.\n# Hold a current St. John Ambulance or Canadian Red Cross Society Standard level First Aid Certificate.\n# Hold the World Conservation Award.\n# Be currently certified in a Service Skill.\n# Complete a minimum of fifty hours service of your choice for which you receive no monetary reward.\n# Act as an activity leader or Scouter-in-training at no less than eight meetings or activities.
