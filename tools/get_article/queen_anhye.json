She later married her second cousin, Gojong of Goryeo and changed her clan into Yu (). Her mother-in-law, Queen Wondeok was initially her aunt and the daughter of Princess Changrak who also changed her clan to Yu.\nIn 1211, she was honoured as Princess Seungbok () not long after her marriage with Gojong and lived in \"Seungbok Palace\" (). She then formally became a Queen Consort following her husband's ascension to the throne in 1218. They had two daughters (born in 1213 and 1215) and two sons (in 1219 and 1223).\nShe died on June 1, 1232 (in 19th year reign of her husband) and her husband wore mourning clothes for three days and grieved over her death. The then-military ruler Ch'oe U gave her a coffin made of gold and silver. At the time she died, her parents were still alive and were said to be sad when they heard the news.\nAfter her death, Gojong didn't remarry again, so it was presumed that they had a good relationship both as cousins and spouse. She then received her posthumous name and honoured as Queen Mother () after their oldest son ascended the throne as King Wonjong in 1260.\nIn popular culture\n*Portrayed by Han Ye-in in the 2003–2004 KBS TV series Age of Warriors.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Index?contents_id=E0035101 Queen Anhye] on the Encyclopedia of Korean Culture .\n*[https://www.doopedia.co.kr/mo/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view2&MAS_IDX=101013000933832 안혜태후] on Doosan Encyclopedia ."
