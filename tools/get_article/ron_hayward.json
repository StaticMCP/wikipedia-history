He served in this role until 1969, when he became a National Agent.\nIn 1972, he narrowly defeated Gwyn Morgan to become General Secretary of the Labour Party.\nAs General Secretary, Hayward opposed entry to the Common Market and supported unilateral nuclear disarmament. He strongly supported the Presidency of Salvador Allende in Chile, and after its overthrow became friends with Hortensia Bussi, Allende's former wife. Privately, he was very critical of the Labour Party leadership's lack of response to the Chilean Coup.\nIn the 1980s he opposed the Militant Tendency, but was reluctant to expel its supporters from the party. He was fiercely opposed to the Gang of Four, who led the split which formed the Social Democratic Party.\nRetirement\nIn 1982, Hayward retired from his Labour Party positions.\nReferences"
