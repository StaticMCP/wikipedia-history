It existed from 1773 to 1893. Members were appointed by the lieutenant governor of Prince Edward Island on the advice of the premier until 1862 when it became an elected body. In 1893, the Legislative Council and House of Assembly were amalgamated into the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island, a unicameral body with an assemblyman and councillor elected from each electoral district.\nSee also\n*Legislative Council\nReferences"
