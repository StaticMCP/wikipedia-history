Whilst at Leicester he also spent a loan spell at Bristol Rovers. He joined Watford in 2005, and was part of a side that won promotion to Premier League, before being subsequently relegated. He left the club in 2008 and subsequently signed for Derby. In March 2013 he signed a three-month contract with Coventry City on a free transfer. He subsequently spent four seasons in the Major League Soccer with San Jose Earthquakes and one season in the USL Championship with Phoenix Rising. He took on his first head coaching role in 2024 with USL Championship side Monterey Bay FC.\nClub career\nLeicester City\nStewart started his career at Leicester City, signing professional terms in the summer of 1999. He made his debut for the club against West Ham United on 22 January 2000. He made one more appearance for Leicester that season before being loaned to Division Two side Bristol Rovers, for whom he made four appearances. Semi-regular appearances from the bench followed in the 2001–02 season, before he established himself as a member of the first team in 2002–03, after the club's relegation to Division One.\nOn 4 August 2002, Stewart scored Leicester's first goal at the new Walkers Stadium in a friendly match with Athletic Bilbao. Leicester's return to the Premiership in 2003–04 saw fewer games for Stewart, although he did score a memorable goal against Manchester City at the City of Manchester Stadium in Leicester's 3–0 win in November 2003. Relegation again saw Stewart hold down a starting position in 2004–05.\nWatford\nStewart became Aidy Boothroyd's first signing for Watford, joining for £125,000 in July 2005. He started as Watford's first-choice left-back, but was dropped in October 2005 after a run of poor form. He retook the position from James Chambers in January, and started every game until he was dropped for the game against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 14 April 2006, after another run of poor form. However, he returned to the side as they went on to win the Championship play-offs, playing all three games. He was the only player in Watford's squad to appear in every single match in 2005–06.\nStewart was a first-team regular through the club's 2006–07 Premiership campaign. Pre-season press speculation linked Stewart with a move to Rangers, but no move came to fruition.\nWatford were relegated, and started their 2007–08 Championship season away at Wolverhampton Wanderers. Stewart scored his first goal for the club, a deflected free-kick, to equalise in an eventual 2–1 win. Up to the end of 2007, he started every league game in the campaign. He scored his second goal for the club on his 26th birthday, in a 2–2 draw away at Burnley. On 7 May 2008, Watford announced ahead of their play-off game with Hull City that they had agreed to release Stewart early from his contract.\nDerby County\nOn 30 May 2008, Stewart, along with former Watford teammate Nathan Ellington, signed for Derby County. He signed a three-year contract with the club, who had just been relegated from the Premier League.\nStewart started the 2008–09 season as second choice left back, behind Jay McEveley, but soon established himself as first choice. With McEveley joining Preston and Charlton on loan, he became an ever-present in the Derby side. Stewart scored his first goal for Derby in the 3–0 win over Sheffield Wednesday, a stunning 30-yard strike. In his next home game, he scored another spectacular goal, this one coming against Preston. Once McEveley had returned from his loan spells at the end of January, he re-established himself as first choice left back and after Derby's FA Cup defeat to Manchester United, Stewart only played one more game for the first team, against Charlton on 25 April. Even with McEveley suffering an injury that ruled him out for the season in early April, Stewart was unable to re-establish himself as Lewin Nyatanga was preferred at left back.\nSheffield United\nOn the final day of the 2009 Summer transfer window, Stewart held talks with Sheffield United over a possible move to the Bramall Lane club. The deal was finalised later the same day, with Lee Hendrie moving in the opposite direction. Stewart made his début for the Blades a few days later in a 1–1 home draw against local rivals Doncaster Rovers. Stewart was largely used as a substitute or as defensive cover for the remainder of the season, playing twenty three times for the Blades.\nSkoda Xanthi\nFailing to hold down a first team place at Sheffield United he was released from his contract and signed for Super League Greece side Skoda Xanthi in June 2010. Where he joined former teammate Nathan Ellington.\nMillwall\nStewart signed a one-year deal with Football League Championship side Millwall on 7 July 2011, after a week-long trial with the club, stating his wish to return from Greece to an English team.\nNotts County\nStewart signed a short-term deal with Football League One side Notts County on 6 October 2012, and played later that day against table toppers Tranmere Rovers. He scored his first and only goal for the club in a Football League Trophy tie against former club Sheffield United.\nCoventry City\nIn March 2013 Stewart signed a three-month contract with Football League One side Coventry City. Coventry manager Steven Pressley announced on 30 April 2013 that Stewart's contract would not be renewed. In total, Stewart made six appearances for the club.\nSan Jose Earthquakes\nIn July 2013, Stewart signed with Major League Soccer club San Jose Earthquakes.\nPhoenix Rising\nStewart moved to USL Championship side Phoenix Rising FC in February 2017.\nManagement career\nAfter serving as assistant coach for San Jose Earthquakes reserve side The Town FC for two seasons, Stewart was appointed as head coach of USL Championship side Monterey Bay FC in August 2024. He replaced former San Jose Earthquakes coach Frank Yallop. Simon Dawkins, a former teammate of Stewart's at San Jose, took on the assistant coach role for the remainder of 2024 and replaced Ramiro Corrales, another former teammate of Stewart.\nPersonal life\nStewart and his close friend and fellow footballer Joleon Lescott launched a clothing label together in 2012 named LescottStewart.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|League Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Other\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|Leicester City\n|1999–2000\n|Premier League\n|1||0||1||0||0||0||0||0||2||0\n|-\n|2000–01\n|Premier League\n|0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0\n|-\n|2001–02\n|Premier League\n|12||0||2||0||1||0||0||0||15||0\n|-\n|2002–03\n|First Division\n|37||4||2||0||2||0||0||0||41||4\n|-\n|2003–04\n|Premier League\n|25||1||2||0||2||0||0||0||29||1\n|-\n|2004–05\n|Championship\n|35||1||4||0||1||0||0||0||40||1\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!110!!6!!11!!0!!6!!0!!0!!0!!127!!6\n|-\n|Bristol Rovers (loan)\n|2000–01\n|Second Division\n|4||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||4||0\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Watford\n|2005–06\n|Championship\n|35||0||1||0||2||0||3||0||41||0\n|-\n|2006–07\n|Premier League\n|31||0||3||0||2||0||0||0||36||0\n|-\n|2007–08\n|Championship\n|39||2||1||0||0||0||0||0||40||2\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!105!!2!!5!!0!!4!!0!!3!!0!!117!!2\n|-\n|Derby County\n|2008–09\n|Championship\n|26||2||2||0||5||0||0||0||33||2\n|-\n|Sheffield United\n|2009–10\n|Championship\n|23||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||23||0\n|-\n|Skoda Xanthi\n|2010–11\n|Superleague Greece\n|14||1||1||0||0||0||0||0||15||1\n|-\n|Millwall\n|2011–12\n|Championship\n|4||0||0||0||3||0||0||0||7||0\n|-\n|Notts County\n|2012–13\n|League One\n|10||0||2||0||0||0||1||1||13||1\n|-\n|Coventry City\n|2012–13\n|League One\n|6||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||6||0\n|-\n|San Jose Earthquakes reserves\n|2013\n|USL Championship\n|1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|San Jose Earthquakes\n|2013\n|MLS\n|12||0||0||0||0||0||1||0||13||0\n|-\n|2014\n|MLS\n|30||0||0||0||0||0||1||0||31||0\n|-\n|2015\n|MLS\n|14||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||14||0\n|-\n|2016\n|MLS\n|15||0||1||0||0||0||0||0||16||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!71!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!2!!0!!74!!0\n|-\n|Phoenix Rising\n|2017\n|USL Championship\n|23||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||23||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|Career total\n!397!!11!!22!!0!!18!!0!!6!!1!!443!!12\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
