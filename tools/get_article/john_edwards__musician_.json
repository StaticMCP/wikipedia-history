Rococo released a single \"Ultrastar\"/\"Wildfire\" on Decca Deram in 1973.\nLater on he joined Judie Tzuke's backing band, where he was given the nickname \"Rhino\" for being clumsy.\nEdwards has played with Peter Green, ex-Fleetwood Mac, Climax Blues Band, Judie Tzuke and Dexys Midnight Runners.\nEdwards was working with drummer Jeff Rich, when Status Quo guitarist Rick Parfitt approached them both to work on his solo album Recorded Delivery. When Status Quo reformed with a new lineup in 1986, Edwards and Rich were called in to replace founding member Alan Lancaster and drummer Pete Kircher.\nHe released the album ''Rhino's Revenge'' in 2000, on which some tracks featured other members of Status Quo. Recently he has played a small number of gigs in the UK and Europe with Woodedz, playing alongside his children.\nAs a fan of Brentford F.C., Edwards wrote a song in early 2006 about striker Lloyd Owusu's return to the club for the start of that football season.\nEquipment\nEdwards owns several different basses from different manufacturers, including Rickenbacker and Wal. However while playing live with Status Quo he uses basses from Status Graphite, mainly two headless four stringed and a five stringed model. For amplification he uses a Markbass F1 amp with 2 4x10 horn loaded cabinets, with a repeater amp on the other side of the stage through a regular Marshall 4 x 12 cabinet. During the song \"Gerdundula\", Edwards plays a Tanglewood guitar through a Marshall JCM800 head and a 4x12 cabinet.\nPersonal life and family\nEdwards's son Freddie is a guitarist and in October 2014 he accompanied Status Quo on stage at The Roundhouse in London, in a concert broadcast live by BBC Radio 2, to launch the band's album Aquostic – Stripped Bare. He was also a member of the subsequent Aquostic touring version of the band.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.statusquo.co.uk/ Status Quo official website]\n* [http://www.rhinosrevenge.com/ Rhinos Revenge official website]"
