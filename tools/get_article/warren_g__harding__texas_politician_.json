Harding attended North Texas State University and Southern Methodist University. He earned a bachelor's degree in government. During World War II, Harding served in the United States Navy. After the war, he became a deputy district clerk for Dallas County, Texas.\nPolitical career\nAs a member of the Democratic Party, Harding ran in an election for county treasurer of Dallas County in 1950, in part due to his famous name. He won a four-year term. In 1956, he ran for election to be the Texas State Treasurer against incumbent Jesse James in the Democratic Party primary election; James defeated Harding, receiving 518,102 votes while Harding received 367,067 in the unofficial vote count. In 1964, Harding was elected president of the National Association of County Treasurers and Finance Officers, which represented over 3,000 counties in the United States. The National Association of County Treasurers and Finance Officers named him an outstanding treasurer and he won the first Outstanding Treasurer Award from the County Treasurer's Association of Texas, of which he also served as president.\nHarding continued to serve as county treasurer until October 5, 1977, when Governor Dolph Briscoe appointed Harding to the position of State Treasurer after James' death. In 1978, Harding was elected to a full four-year term.\nCharges\nIn 1982, Ronnie Earle, the district attorney for Travis County, Texas, investigated Harding for misusing his office.

Harding continued his campaign in the Democratic primary and finished second in the first round of balloting, advancing to a runoff election against Ann Richards. After initially entering an innocent plea, but before the runoff election, Harding pled guilty to a misdemeanor offense in return for prosecutors dismissing the felony charges and Harding withdrew his candidacy. Richards was elected to office in 1982. Harding paid a $2,000 fine and reimbursed the state $2,000.\nDistrict Attorney Earle also alleged that Harding had used his position to benefit his son, Warren Jr., who sold bonds for the brokerage firm Rauscher Pierce Refsnes.
