It is a subdivision of the Ministry of Industry, Mine and Trade, which was established in 1962 in cooperation with United Nations.\nHistory\nNasrollah Khadem, graduate of Mining engineering in Mines ParisTech, founded the Geological Survey and Mineral Exploration of Iran (GSI) in 1962 and was the head of this organization until 1974. The law establishing GSI was approved by National Consultative Assembly and Senate of Iran on August 20, 1959, and Geological Survey and Mineral Exploration of Iran (GSI) officially started its work in 1962. Therefore, according to the twenty-seventh principle of the amendment to the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the license to establish the Geological Survey and Mineral Exploration of Iran (GSI) was issued based on an 8-article statute, which is summarized below:\n* Article 1: It was decided that the government should establish a single organization called the Geological Survey and Mineral Exploration of Iran (GSI) in order to conduct geological surveys throughout the country, collect all the work done in this field and prepare, complete and publish geological maps of Iran.\n* Article 2: A council called the Supreme Geological Council consisting of representatives of University of Tehran, National Iranian Oil Company, Plan and Budget Organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Ministry of Industries and Mines (Iran).\n* Article 3: The head of organization should be appointed from among engineers with experience in mining or geology for a period of three years.\n* Article 4: The Geological Survey and Mineral Exploration of Iran (GSI) should operate independent under the supervision of the Ministry of Industries and Mines.\n* Article 5: The expenses of organization should be provided from the revenues of Ministry of Industries and Mines, National Iranian Oil Company and Plan and Budget Organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as from the revenues from the sale of publications and services.\n* Article 6: Government and non-governmental companies and institutions should be in contact with the Geological Survey and Mineral Exploration of Iran (GSI) to provide and coordinate similar tasks such as preparing maps or geological reports of areas from all over the country.\n* Article 7: Geological sections excavations performed by companies, contractors and institutions in the field of tunneling, canals, deep wells and boreholes for mines should be provided to the Geological Survey and Mineral Exploration of Iran (GSI).\n* Article 8: The Ministry of Industries and Mines will be in charge of implementing this law.\nIn 1999, the exploration tasks of the Ministry of Industries and Mines were handed over entirely to the Geological Survey and Mineral Exploration of Iran. The organization is currently responsible for geological studies of the country and exploratory assessment of mineral resources except hydrocarbons (Petroleum and Natural gas).\nOrganization
