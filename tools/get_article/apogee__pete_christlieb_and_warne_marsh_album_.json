First, it is a Southern California answer to the great titan tenor battle records of the '40s and '50s. Rather than sounding like a cutting contest, it sounds like a gorgeous exercise in swinging harmony and melodic improvisation by two compadres. ...  the pair engaged a kind of freewheeling, good-time set that remains one of the most harmonically sophisticated recordings to come out of the 1970s.\" On All About Jazz, Chris M. Slawecki observed: \"It is impossible to distinguish one man’s tenor from the other: sometimes they swing in unison, sometimes harmonizing, sometimes in duet or counterpunching, but they are always strong, meaty and powerful.\"\nIn Jazz Review, Mark Keresman called it \"a sterling set of beautifully recorded, searing, straight-ahead, mainstream bop tenor madness.\" DownBeat reviewer Douglas Clark wrote, \"Watch out when you slip this record out of its sleeve. It’s hot enough to burn your fingers... There’s fire on every cut... I recommend this album highly, but don’t blame me if it melts your stylus\".\nTrack listing\n# \"Magna-tism\" (Pete Christlieb) – 7:32\n# \"317 E. 32nd\" (Lennie Tristano) – 6:34\n# \"Rapunzel\" (Donald Fagen, Walter Becker) – 7:15\n# \"Tenors of the Time\" (Joe Roccisano) – 7:42\n# \"Donna Lee\" (Charlie Parker) – 6:35\n# \"I'm Old Fashioned\" (Jerome Kern, Johnny Mercer) – 6:50\n# \"Lunarcy\" (Lou Levy) – 7:13 Bonus track on CD reissue\n# \"Love Me\" – 4:13 Bonus track on CD reissue\n# \"How About You?\" (Burton Lane, Ralph Freed) – 9:37 Bonus track on CD reissue\nPersonnel\n*Pete Christlieb, Warne Marsh – tenor saxophone\n*Lou Levy – piano\n*Jim Hughart – bass\n*Nick Ceroli – drums\n*Joe Roccisano – arranger (tracks 1–4)\nReferences"
