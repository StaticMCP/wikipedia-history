It included the U.S. Pacific Ocean Areas (command). which included most of the Pacific Ocean and its islands.\nThe Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, Borneo, Australia, most of the Territory of New Guinea, and the western part of the Solomon Islands were under a different Allied command.\nHistory\nOn March 30, 1942, US Admiral Chester Nimitz was appointed Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas. In the other major theater in the Pacific region, known as the South West Pacific theater, Allied forces were commanded by US General Douglas MacArthur. Both Nimitz and MacArthur were overseen by the US Joint Chiefs, and indirectly by the British-American Combined Chiefs of Staff.\nMost Japanese forces in the theater were part of the  of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), which was responsible for all Japanese warships, naval aircraft, and marine infantry units. The Rengō Kantai was led by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, until he was killed in an attack by U.S. fighter planes in April 1943.  Yamamoto was succeeded by Admiral Mineichi Koga (1943–44) and Admiral Soemu Toyoda (1944–45).  The  of the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) was responsible for Imperial Japanese Army ground and air units in Southeast Asia and the South Pacific.  The IJN and IJA did not formally use joint/combined staff at the operational level, and their command structures/geographical areas of operations overlapped with each other and those of the Allies.\nIn the Pacific Ocean theater, Japanese forces fought primarily against the United States Navy, the U.S. Army, which had 6 Corps and 21 Divisions, and the U.S. Marine Corps, which had only 6 Divisions.  The United Kingdom (British Pacific Fleet), New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and other Allied nations, also contributed forces.\nMajor campaigns and battles\n* Pacific theater\n** Attack on Pearl Harbor 7 December 1941\n** Battle of Wake Island 7–23 December 1941\n** First Philippines campaign 8 December 1941 – 8 May 1942\n***Battle of Bataan\n***Battle of Corregidor\n** Battle of Ambon\n** Battle of Timor\n** Battle of Rabaul\n** Battle of the Java Sea\n** Bombing of Darwin\n** Battle of the Coral Sea 4–8 May 1942\n** Doolittle Raid 18 April 1942\n** Battle of Midway 4–7 June 1942\n** Guadalcanal campaign 7 August 1942 to 9 February 1943\n***Battle of Savo Island\n***Battle of Cape Esperance\n***Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal\n***Battle of Tassafaronga\n** New Guinea campaign\n** Solomon Islands Campaign\n** Battle of the Bismark Sea\n** Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign 1943–44\n*** Makin Island raid 17–18 August 1942\n*** Battle of Tarawa 20 November 1943\n*** Battle of Makin 20–23 November 1943\n*** Battle of Kwajalein 14 February 1944\n*** Battle of Eniwetok 17 February 1944\n** Attack on Truk Island 17–18 February 1944\n** Mariana and Palau Islands campaign 1944\n*** Battle of Saipan 15 June 1944\n*** Battle of the Philippine Sea 19–21 June 1944\n*** Battle of Guam 21 July 1944\n*** Battle of Tinian 24 July 1944\n*** Battle of Peleliu 15 September 1944\n*** Battle of Angaur 17 September 1944\n** Second Philippines campaign 20 October 1944 – 15 August 1945\n*** Battle of Leyte 17 October 1944\n*** Battle of Luzon 9 January 1945\n** Battle of Iwo Jima 19 February 1945\n** Battle of Okinawa 1 April 1945\n* North Pacific theater\n** Aleutian Islands Campaign 1942–43\n** Battle of the Komandorski Islands 26 March 1943\nReferences\nBibliography\n* .\n* .\n* .\n* .\n* .\n* .\n* .\n* .\n*\n*\n*"
