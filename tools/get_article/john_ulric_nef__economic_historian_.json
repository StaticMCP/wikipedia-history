He was associated with the University of Chicago for over half a century, and co-founded the Committee there in 1941.\nEarly life\nNef was born in 1899, the son of chemist John Ulric Nef. He was a native Chicagoan. He graduated from Harvard University in 1920. He finished a PhD degree at the Robert Brookings Graduate School in Washington, D.C. (a precursor of the Brookings Institution) in 1927. He served at Swarthmore College's faculty for a year. He joined the University of Chicago's faculty in 1929 as an assistant professor of economics.\nCareer in academia\nAfter joining the faculty at Chicago in 1929, he was associated with the university for over half a century. He became professor of economic history there in 1936.\nHe also served as a visiting professor at French universities, Institut d'études politiques and the Collège de France, and also lectured at the universities of Belfast and Houston.\nCommittee on Social Thought\nIn 1941 Nef co-founded the Committee on Social Thought at Chicago along with Frank Knight, Robert Redfield, and Robert M. Hutchins (who was then president of the University of Chicago). It is an elite interdisciplinary graduate department at Chicago. He served as executive secretary and also as chairman (1945&ndash;1964) of the Committee. He brought a number of distinguished people he had encountered in his travels abroad such as Marc Chagall, T. S. Eliot, Igor Stravinsky, and Jacques Maritain to the Committee.\nWork as an economic historian\nNef went on to become a foremost economic historian. His largest domain of interest was the Western Europe's economic, cultural, and military history since the end of the 15th century. He was involved in the study of the comparative economic histories of Britain and France; his most intense being the French economic history. His early work on the coal industry of Britain and the early Industrial Revolution in Britain during the 16th and 17th century is particularly important. His work indicated that the Industrial Revolution was a long-time evolutionary process. He was also one of the first economic historians who paid serious attention to technology.\nPublication\nHe was an author of a number of books which include Industry and Government In France and England 1540-1640 (1940), War and Human Progress (1950), The United States and Civilization (1967), The Rise of the British Coal Industry (1932), The Conquest of the Material World (1964), and Search for Meaning: Autobiography of a Non-Conformist (1973).\nLater life\nApart from being an economic historian, Nef was also an officer of the French Legion of Honor, a philanthropist, and patron of the arts.\nIn 1979 the Society for the History of Technology awarded him the Leonardo da Vinci Medal, and in 1980 he received the University of Chicago Medal.\nHe died at his home in Washington, D.C. at the age of 89, after a long illness, on December 25, 1988.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/scrc/findingaids/view.php?eadid=ICU.SPCL.NEFJU Guide to the John Ulric Nef, Jr. Papers 1840-2008] at the [https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/scrc/ University of Chicago Special Collections Research Center]\n*\n*"
