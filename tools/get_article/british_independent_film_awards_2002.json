The award ceremony was hosted by Johnny Vaughan.\nAs per previous years, only films intended for theatrical release, and those which had a public screening to a paying audience either on general release in the UK or at a British film festival between 1 October 2001 and 30 September 2002 were eligible for consideration. In addition, they needed to have been produced or majority co-produced by a British company, or in receipt of at least 51% of their budget from a British source. Lastly, they could not be solely funded by a single studio.\nShortlists were announced on 18 September 2002 with Lynne Ramsay's psychological drama, Morvern Callar, leading with seven nominations. Winners in eleven categories were selected from the shortlists and a further five were awarded entirely at the jury's discretion, whose make up included Kate Ashfield, Jenne Cassarotto (Agent), Stuart Craig, Richard Gladstein, Robert Jones (Head of the premiere fund/film council), Asif Kapadia, Hamish McAlpine (Metro Tartan Distributors) and Trudie Styler.\nThe category for Best Original Music was dropped this year as was the award for Producer of the Year. An Award for Outstanding Contribution by an Actor and was created in this year to commemorate the life and work of Richard Harris.\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"50%\" |Best British Independent Film\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Director\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Sweet Sixteen – Ken Loach\n**Bend It Like Beckham – Gurinder Chadha\n**Bloody Sunday – Paul Greengrass\n**Lawless Heart – Neil Hunter\n**Morvern Callar – Lynne Ramsay\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Paul Greengrass – Bloody Sunday'\n**Ken Loach – Sweet Sixteen\n**Lynne Ramsay – Morvern Callar\n**Neil Hunter and Tom Hunsinger – Lawless Heart\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Actor\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Actress\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'James Nesbitt – Bloody Sunday as Ivan Cooper'\n**Bill Nighy – Lawless Heart as Dan\n**Richard Harris – My Kingdom as \"Sandeman\"\n**Timothy Spall – All or Nothing as Phil\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Samantha Morton – Morvern Callar as Morvern Callar'\n**Elaine Cassidy – Disco Pigs as Sinéad\n**Harriet Walter – Villa des Roses as Olive Burrell\n**Shirley Henderson – Villa des Roses as Ella\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Screenplay\n! width=\"50%\" |Most Promising Newcomer\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Tom Hunsinger and 'Neil Hunter – Lawless Heart'\n**Lynne Ramsay and Liana Dognini – Morvern Callar\n**Paul Greengrass – Bloody Sunday\n**Paul Laverty – Sweet Sixteen\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Martin Compston – Sweet Sixteen as Liam'\n**Kathleen McDermott – Morvern Callar as Lanna\n**Parminder Nagra – Bend It Like Beckham as Jesminder \"Jess\" Kaur Bhamra\n**William Ruane – Sweet Sixteen as Pinball\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" |Best International Independent Film (English Language)\n! width=\"50%\" |Best International Independent Film (Foreign Language)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Lantana – Ray Lawrence\n**Ghost World – Terry Zwigoff\n**Ivans Xtc – Bernard Rose\n**Lost in La Mancha – Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Monsoon Wedding – Mira Nair'\n**Nine Queens – Fabián Bielinsky\n**Talk to Her – Pedro Almodóvar\n**Y Tu Mamá También – Alfonso Cuarón\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Technical Achievement\n! width=\"50%\" |Best Achievement in Production\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Alwin H.
