It ceased generating in 1980 and was demolished in 1994.\nHistory\nThe first station was built in 1893, with an original capacity of 225&nbsp;kW. New generating equipment was added as the demand for electricity increased. The generating capacity, maximum load, and electricity generated and sold was as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Kingston A generating capacity, load and electricity produced and sold\n|Year\n|Generating  capacity, MW\n|Maximum  load, MW\n|Electricity  generated, GWh\n|Electricity  sold, GWh\n|-\n|1912/3\n|0.860\n|0.670\n|1.332\n|1.152\n|-\n|1918/9\n|2.00\n|0.95\n|2.175\n|1.608\n|-\n|1919/20\n|2.00\n|1.25\n|2.208\n|1.848\n|-\n|1923/4\n|4.50\n|2.00\n|4.081\n|2.394\n|-\n|1936/7\n|11.75\n|7.293\n|None (30.711 purchased)\n|19.140\n|}\nThe A station eventually closed in 1959. A new 'B' station was planned before World War II, opening in 1948. The Thames was used both for coal supply and ash removal, and as a source of cooling water. The new station was the first to be opened following nationalisation of the power industry, with the official opening by King George VI, the first station to receive such an honour since Barking in 1924.\nTechnical specification\nIn 1923 the plant comprised two 1,250&nbsp;kW turbo-alternators, these were supplied from the boiler plant which produced a total of 66,000&nbsp;lb/hr (8.32&nbsp;kg/s) of steam. Electricity was available at 3-phase AC, 50&nbsp;Hz at 440, 415 & 240V and single phase AC, 77&nbsp;Hz at 210 & 105V. In 1923 the station generated  3.448 GWh of electricity, some of this was used in the plant, the total amount sold was 1.888 GWh. The revenue from sales of current was £39,623, this gave a surplus of revenue over expenses of £21,124. The station was extended in April 1930 with the addition of a 50,000-lb/hr boiler feeding a 3,750-kW turbo-alternator.\nThe installed plant in 1938 consisted of the following Brush Lungstrom sets\n2 x 1,250 kW, 1 x 2,000 kW, 1 x 3,500 and 1 x 3,750 kW\nBy 1966 Kingston B power station had 4 × 30 MW British Thomson-Houston turbo-alternators, giving a generating capacity of 123 MW. The chain grate stoker Stirling boilers had a steam capacity of 1,710,000&nbsp;lb/hr (215.4&nbsp;kg/s). The steam conditions at the turbine stop valve were 600 psi (41.4 bar) and 454&nbsp;°C. The overall thermal efficiency of the station in 1966 was 21.12 per cent.\nElectricity output from Kingston power station was as follows.\nKingston annual electricity output GWh.{\n\"version\": 2,\n\"width\": 700,\n\"height\": 200,\n\"data\": [\n{\n\"name\": \"table\",\n\"values\": [\n{\n\"x\": 1966,\n\"y\": 428\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1967,\n\"y\": 364\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1968,\n\"y\": 303\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1969,\n\"y\": 261\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1970,\n\"y\": 261\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1971,\n\"y\": 211\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1972,\n\"y\": 144\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1973,\n\"y\": 111\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1974,\n\"y\": 83\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1975,\n\"y\": 71\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1976,\n\"y\": 1\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1977,\n\"y\": 1\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1978,\n\"y\": 14\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1979,\n\"y\": 3\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1980,\n\"y\": 2\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1954,\n\"y\": 455\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1955,\n\"y\": 399\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1956,\n\"y\": 508\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1957,\n\"y\": 462\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1958,\n\"y\": 501\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1961,\n\"y\": 519\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1962,\n\"y\": 578\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1963,\n\"y\": 501\n}\n]\n}\n],\n\"scales\": [\n{\n\"name\": \"x\",\n\"type\": \"ordinal\",\n\"range\": \"width\",\n\"zero\": false,\n\"domain\": {\n\"data\": \"table\",\n\"field\": \"x\"\n}\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"y\",\n\"type\": \"linear\",\n\"range\": \"height\",\n\"nice\": true,\n\"domain\": {\n\"data\": \"table\",\n\"field\": \"y\"\n}\n}\n],\n\"axes\": [\n{\n\"type\": \"x\",\n\"scale\": \"x\"\n},\n{\n\"type\": \"y\",\n\"scale\": \"y\"\n}\n],\n\"marks\": [\n{\n\"type\": \"rect\",\n\"from\": {\n\"data\": \"table\"\n},\n\"properties\": {\n\"enter\": {\n\"x\": {\n\"scale\": \"x\",\n\"field\": \"x\"\n},\n\"y\": {\n\"scale\": \"y\",\n\"field\": \"y\"\n},\n\"y2\": {\n\"scale\": \"y\",\n\"value\": 0\n},\n\"fill\": {\n\"value\": \"steelblue\"\n},\n\"width\": {\n\"scale\": \"x\",\n\"band\": \"true\",\n\"offset\": -1\n}\n}\n}\n}\n]\n}\nClosure\nGeneration ceased on 27 October 1980 with a generating capacity of 117 megawatts. The station was eventually demolished, despite calls for preservation as a power museum. The two 250-foot chimneys were demolished in 1994.\nSee also\n*Canbury Gardens\nReferences"
