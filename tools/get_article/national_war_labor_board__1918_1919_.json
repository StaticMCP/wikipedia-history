It was composed of twelve members, including five representatives each from business and the American Federation of Labor (AFL), as well as co-chairs Frank P. Walsh and former president William Howard Taft.\nThe decisions of the NWLB generally supported and strengthened the position of labor.  Although it opposed the disruption of war production by strikes, it supported an eight-hour day for workers, equal pay for women, and the right to organize unions and bargain collectively.  Although the NWLB had no coercive enforcement power, public pressure during the war period often led to voluntary agreements between labor and employers. Notably, when Western Union refused to bargain with its employees that had joined the Commercial Telegraphers Union of America, President Woodrow Wilson ordered the temporary nationalization of Western Union's vast telegram line network for the duration of the war to avoid a strike. This action gave the NWLB far more power in its work for the rest of the war, and strengthened the position of labor during the time.\nIn general, the relative strength of organized labor in America grew substantially during the war.  Union membership almost doubled after the formation of the NWLB.  Of note, membership in the AFL rose from two million in 1916 to over three million in 1919.  By the end of the decade, fifteen percent of the nonagricultural work force was unionized.\nIn all, the board ruled on 1,245 cases.  Almost ninety percent of them sprang from worker complaints, and five skilled trades accounted for 45 percent. Of the cases, 591 were dismissed, 315 were referred to other federal labor agencies, and 520 resulted in formal awards or findings.  In reaching decisions, the board was aided by an office and investigative staff of 250 people.  Approximately seven hundred thousand workers in one thousand establishments were directly affected.\nThe board was disbanded on August 12, 1919.\nMembership\nMeeting of the War Labor Board in New York, January 1919; co-chairs Taft and Manley are third and second from the right in the seated row, respectively\nThe twelve members of the board were:\n* William Howard Taft\n* Frank P.
