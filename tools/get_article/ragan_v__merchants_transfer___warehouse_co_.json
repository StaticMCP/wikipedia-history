      "text": "# Ragan v. Merchants Transfer & Warehouse Co.\n\nRagan v. Merchants Transfer & Warehouse Co., 337 U.S. 530 (1949), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that federal courts sitting in diversity should begin the running of the statute of limitations for a claim according to state law instead of according to the federal rules of civil procedure.  The court reasoned that a claim could not be given longer life in federal court than it would have had in a state court while being consistent with the holding in Erie Railroad v. Tompkins.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n| cornell =https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/337/530\n| courtlistener =https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/104693/ragan-v-merchants-transfer-warehouse-co/\n| googlescholar = https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5007175995130053724\n| justia =https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/337/530/case.html\n| loc =http://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/usrep/usrep337/usrep337530/usrep337530.pdf\n}}"
