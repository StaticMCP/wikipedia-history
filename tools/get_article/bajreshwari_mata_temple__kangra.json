It is dedicated to Goddess Durga in her fierce form as Vajreshwari, the goddess of the thunderbolt. The temple is one of the 51 sacred Shakti Peethas, where it is believed that the left breast of Sati fell to earth.\nThe temple complex has several smaller temples dedicated to other Hindu deities. There is also a temple of Bhairava here. The temple is particularly famous for its Navratri festival, which is celebrated twice a year.\nHimachal Pradesh has 5 Shakti Pithas - Chintpurni, Jwalamukhi Temple, Brajeshwari Devi Temple, Shri Chamunda Devi Mandir and Naina Devi Temple.\nLegends and Religious Significance\nThe name Vajreshwari comes from the Sanskrit word Vajra meaning \"thunderbolt\" and Ishwari meaning \"goddess\". She is believed to be a form of Durga, who used a divine thunderbolt to slay the demon Kalikala. As per Shakti Peetha legend, this site is where the left breast of Sati fell, making it a sacred location of divine feminine power.\nA legend says that after Goddess Sati sacrificed herself in the honor of Lord Shiva in her father's Yagya. Shiva took her body on his shoulder and started Tandav. In order to stop him from destroying the world Lord Vishnu divided the body of Sati into 51 parts with his Chakra. The left breast of Sati fell at this spot, thus making it a Shakta pitha. Jnanarnava Tantra mentioned this Shakta pitha as \"Bhrigupuri Shakta pitha\". According to Brihad Nila Tantra, the goddess of this Shakta pitha is \"Vrajeshwari\". This place was called as Guptapura.\nVajreśvarī Śaktipīṭha is known as Jālandhara Ādi Śaktipīṭha. According to the Jālandhara Māhātmya Khaṇḍa of Padma Purāṇa, Vajratārā or Vajreśvarī is the presiding goddess of Jālandhara Pīṭha.\nHistory\nThe temple has been a major pilgrimage site since ancient times. Its inclusion among the Shakti Peethas contributed to its religious prominence. It is believed that the original temple was built by the Pandavas during their exile, although the current structure was rebuilt after destruction by the 1905 Kangra earthquake.\nThe original temple is said to have been built by the  Pandavas at the time of Mahabharatha. Legend says that one day Pandavas saw Goddess Durga in their dream in which she told them that she is situated in the Nagarkot village and if they want themselves to be secure they should make a temple for her in that area otherwise they will be destroyed. That same night they made a magnificent temple for the goddess in the Nagarkot village. In 1905 the temple was destroyed by a powerful earthquake and was subsequently rebuilt by the government.\nTemple structure\nThe main gate entrance has a Nagarkhana or drum house and is built similar to the Bassein fort entrance. The temple is also surrounded by a stone wall like a fort.\nInside the main area Goddess Vajreshvari is present in the form of Pindi. The temple also have a small temple of Bhairav. In front of the main temple an idol of Dhayanu Bhagat is also present. He had offered his head to the Goddess at the time of Akbar. The present structure has three tombs in it, which is unique in itself.\nFestivals\nThe temple celebrates the festival of Navratri with great fervor, attracting thousands of devotees. Rituals during this period are associated with the worship of the goddess in her Vajreshwari form, invoking her as the destroyer of evil forces.\nMakar Sankranti, which comes in second week of January, is also celebrated in the temple. Legend says that after killing Mahishasura in the battle, Devi had got some injuries. To heal those injuries Goddess had applied butter on her body, in Nagarkot. Thus to mark this day, the Pindi of Goddess is covered with butter and the festival is celebrated for a week in the temple.\nTantric rituals, symbolic of the Shakti Peetha tradition, are also occasionally performed by ascetic groups during these festivals.\nAccess\nThe Vajreshwari temple is located in the town of Kangra, Kangra district, Himachal Pradesh, India and is 3 km away from both the railway stations of Kangra Mandir and Kangra of Kangra City.
