A detachment of Russian troops of the General-Ansheff Count I.V. Gudovich made an unsuccessful assault on the Ottoman fortress of Akhalkalaki and, having lost a third of its troops, was forced to retreat.\nBattle\nAt the beginning of the 1807 campaign, General Nesvetaev's detachment, which had advanced to Kars and tried to take it, found itself under strong pressure from Turkish troops. The commander-in-chief of the Russian troops in Transcaucasia, Count I.V. Gudovich, realizing the situation, decided to invade the territory of the Ottoman Empire in the direction of Akhalkalaki and try to take the Akhalkalaki fortress in order to preempt a possible attack of the enemy in the direction of Imeretia and Mingrelia. On April 17 (29) Gudovich's detachment (4,500 men) left Tiflis.\nHaving approached the fortress of Akhalkalaki on May 6 (18) and not having received the commandant's response to his twofold appeal to surrender it, Gudovich started bombardment. The fortress, which had about 50 guns, was defended by a garrison of 1500 people. Inside the fortress itself, surrounded by a thick stone wall, on the bank of the Hanse River was a citadel with four towers and a high crenellated wall. Two days of artillery bombardment did no harm to the walls of the fortress, and the count decided to take it by storm.\nThree columns were formed for the assault, totaling 2,900 infantry. Four ladders with hooks were distributed to each column. The soldiers were ordered not to fire until they climbed the wall. During the night of May 8–9 (21), the columns were deployed to their original positions. At dawn on May 9 (21) a six-gun battery opened fire, and the assault began.\nThe first and third columns moved at the same time. Despite the prohibition to fire, the soldiers opened fire. The ladders were short, and under enemy fire the attackers tried them in various places, but everywhere they failed to reach the top of the wall. A six-pounder cannon, brought to the gate at forty paces, broke it to half, but then the gun crew was destroyed by enemy cartridges, and the cannon was captured by the Turks. Nevertheless, the second column of Major-General S. A. Portnyagin occupied the suburb; many soldiers of the other columns managed to climb the wall and captured one tower, but unsupported, were killed by the Turks blowing up the tower.\nThe assault lasted five hours. Gudovich, having used up all his reserves and lost a third of the attackers, ordered a retreat. 700 Ottoman cavalry attempted to pursue the retreating units, but were driven back by Russian dragoons and Cossacks.\nAfter remaining in camp for three more days, Gudovich withdrew his detachment to Tsalka, to the Russian-Turkish border. From there, the spirited commander sent an order to General Nesvetaev to withdraw from the vicinity of Kars to the border, and to General Rykgoff to lift the siege of Poti and retreat to Imeretia.\nSources\n* Дубровин Н. Ф. История войны и владычества русских на Кавказе.
