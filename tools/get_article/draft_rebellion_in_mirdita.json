Albania's government responded by stating that it represented all Albanians regardless of religious beliefs. The Yugoslav government argued that due to the existence of the Mirdita republic, the Albanian response was invalid and threw Albania's status of being a country into question, thus affecting its potential membership in the League. The Yugoslav delegation stated that while two governments existed in Albania, a unity between the people could not exist.\nThe Rebellion\nMarka Gjoni, a chieftain of the predominantly Roman Catholic Mirdita region and tribe in Northern Albania, believed that the new Albanian government was going to ban Catholicism. As a result, he allowed Yugoslav authorities on his behalf to proclaim the Mirdita Republic on July 17, 1921 in Prizren, Yugoslavia.\nThe Albanian government viewed the existence of the Mirdita republic as a violation of the sovereignty of the Albanian state. As a result, it began preparing troops to quash the rebellion. Meanwhile, in August 1921, representatives of both Yugoslavia and the Mirdita Republic signed an agreement which stated that the republic would be defended by Yugoslav military forces and the interests of the republic abroad would be represented by the Yugoslav government. This prompted Albania to accuse Yugoslavia of instigating a rebellion and aiding the separatists.\nAftermath\nWith the withdrawal of the Yugoslav troops, the Mirdita Republic became quickly overrun by Albanian government troops and irregular forces under the command of Ahmet Zog. The rebellion ended by 20 November 1921 following negotiations with local Mirditor elders who agreed to surrender to Zog if no reprisals would occur. Gjoni fled to Yugoslavia, while Mirdita was placed under siege with Gjoni's followers being proclaimed as traitors. Other rebels were sentenced in a government political court, though no real persecution fell on the main leaders. As a result of the rebellion, Mirditan autonomy was abolished by the Albanian government.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
