He is also the youngest poet in the history of Sahitya Akademi to have received this honour. Viyogi is noted for introducing the sonnet, a relatively new and unexplored genre for Dogri writers, into Dogri literature.\nEarly life\nKunwar Viyogi was born on 4 September 1940 in the Samba district to Poorakh Singh Jamwal, who served as an inspector in the Jammu and Kashmir Police department. His mother, Pushpa Devi, was a homemaker, and mother to five brothers and three sisters, of which Kunwar was the eldest. Most of Viyogi's siblings served the country by either joining the army or the air force. All his sisters were married to defence officers.\nViyogi's childhood was not tied to one place owing to his father's occupation. He grew up in Gaur Bajorian, Rajouri, Buddal, Kotli (presently in Pakistan), Jammu and Udhampur. He spent a major part of his life in Jammu's Fattu Chogan area and was inspired by poetry at the age of 13. He achieved acclaim for his work published in the magazines Khilona and Shamaa, contributing short stories.\nAcademic life\nViyogi received his primary education from primary schools in Gaur, Sarore and Pacca Danga. His middle level education was from the princely school Partap Memorial Rajput School in Jammu. He later joined the G.G.M. Science College for higher studies. His interest in studies led him to pursue BSc, PGDM (Post Graduate Diploma of Management), PGDMC (Post Graduate Diploma of Mass Communication), MBA (Master of Business Administration) and post graduation in journalism. Kunwar Viyogi was proficient in Dogri, Urdu, Hindi, English and Punjabi. His hobbies included playing football and hockey and he actively participated in the events of the student union.\nProfession\nWhile pursuing his graduation, Viyogi applied for the Defense ForcesArmy, Navy, and the Air Forceand was selected for all three. He opted for the Air Force and joined the Air Force Flying College for training as a pilot. The nature of his job took him across India and he served as a squadron leader in New York for about one and a half years. Though Viyogi excelled as an Air Force officer, he took premature retirement due to the demise of his wife who lost her life to breast cancer. He withdrew from the life that he had known with her, moved to Bhilwara, Rajasthan, and gave up all his literary musings. He then devoted his time in training students pursuing IAS and MBA. He wrote editorials, essays and poems. He again retreated to Rajasthan. In 2001, Viyogi was conferred the Sahitya Ratan Award by the Nami Dogri Sanstha for his invaluable contribution to Dogri. From 2012-15, he worked to publish and reprint his work.\nMajor works\nDogri-Ghar – a long poem, 1979 in Rubaiyat\nViyogi wrote \"Ghar\" [Home] in 1980.
