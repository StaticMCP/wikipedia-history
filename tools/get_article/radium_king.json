Later in her active career she hauled barges on Great Slave Lake.\nThe Radium King, and a sister ship, the Radium Queen, were built in the Manseau shipyards in Montreal.\nThey were then disassembled and the pieces were loaded on flatcars for shipment by railroad to Waterways, Alberta, which was then the northern terminus of the North American railway grid, to be reassembled and launched on the Mackenzie River.\nIt required nine flatcars to completely load all the parts of the vessel.\nThe Radium King was staffed by a crew of 10, and could carry 10 passengers.\nThe shipping season was short during the working lifetime of the Radium King.\nIn 1942 she was to be the last vessel to make the round trip down the Mackenzie River, and had to leave on August 17, in order arrive back on time.\nOn November 16, 1945, the Radium King and the Radium Express were caught by freeze up in Yellowknife.\nThe Edmonton Journal reported in 1953 that the Radium King was the first vessel to cross Great Slave Lake—arriving in Yellowknife on June 8.\nWhile the lake's ice had broken up, it hadn't moved out.\nNorthern Transportation added additional vessels to her fleet, many of which, like the Radium Charles and Radium Yellowknife also bore the prefix \"Radium\", and the line was known locally as the \"Radium Line\".\nIn 1956 the Radium King survived the explosion of mining supplies on a barge she was towing.\nIn 1959 noted English professor Hugh MacLennan described a trip he took down the Mackenzie on the Radium King for ''Maclean's magazine.  He said the vessel was suddenly frozen in, on Great Slave Lake, for over a week, due to a sudden cold snap at the beginning of the shipping season in 1958.\nIn 1967 the boat was retired.  Currently she is on display outside the Northern Life Museum in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories.\nThe Radium King was restored, and turned into a museum.\nIn 2005 Atomic Energy of Canada published a study of the toxic legacy of the mining of radioactive ore at Port Radium.  According to the report the Radium King and all the other surviving vessels of the Radium line were found to be free of contamination, with the exception of the Radium Gilbert.\n}}\nExternal links\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/george-lessard/72018/in/set-21732/ Pictures of the Radium King''].\n*"
