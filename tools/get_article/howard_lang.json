      "text": "# Howard Lang\n\nHoward Lang (born Donald Yarranton; 20 March 1911 – 11 December 1989) was an English actor known for playing Captain William Baines in the BBC nautical drama The Onedin Line.\nEarly life\nLang was born in Marylebone, London, the son of Edward John Yarranton (1884–1954) and Clara Ann (née Malkin) (1888–1921). His father had left the family's bookbinding business to become a senior commercial traveller for Winsor & Newton, the manufacturer of artists' materials.\nLang served for seven years in the Royal Navy including during World War II. In January 1941 he was appointed Temporary Sub-Lieutenant, and in January 1942 Temporary Lieutenant, a position he held until the end of the war.\nHis younger brother from his father's second marriage was Sir Peter Yarranton (1924–2003), chairman of the United Kingdom Sports Council from 1989 to 1994, and a notable figure in the world of rugby union, both as a player and as an administrator, for more than 40 years.\nActing career\nFor his role as seafaring Captain Baines in The Onedin Line (1971–1980) he gained international attention. In a 1977 interview in Radio Times Lang recalled a personal appearance in Norway:\nWhen the series was first shown in Norway I was asked to make a personal appearance in a small shipbuilding town. As I was brought into Grimstad by sea I caught sight of huge crowds – all of 3,000 townsfolk out on the quay to greet me. I learned afterwards that I had been received as family because almost every home had an ancient photograph of an uncle, cousin or grandfather dressed and sideburned precisely as I appear on The Onedin Line.\nLang's other parts included roles in The Six Wives of Henry VIII (1970), Z-Cars, Softly, Softly, The Vise, and an appearance as caveman Horg in three of the four episodes of the first Doctor Who story, An Unearthly Child. He also played Winston Churchill in the 1983 TV miniseries The Winds of War.\nHe also played the role of Bert Hudd in the first production of Harold Pinter's first play,The Room.\nIn an early seafaring role, he had a cameo in Ben-Hur as the hortator aboard a Roman galley leading up to the epic battle with an enemy fleet.\nHoward Lang died in West Hampstead, London in 1989.\nFilmography\nFilm\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable jquery-tablesorter\"\n!Year\n!Title\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n|1946\n|Great Expectations\n|Man at Magwitch's Trial\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|1947\n|Jassy\n|Juryman\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|1950\n|The Mudlark\n|Footman\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|1951\n|Captain Horatio Hornblower R.N.\n|Officer aboard Cassandra\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|1952\n|The Floating Dutchman\n|Gaoler\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1953\n|The Missing Man\n|Inspector Haslett\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|Counterspy\n|Policeman\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|rowspan=5|1954\n|The Blazing Caravan\n|Publican\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|The House Across the Lake\n|Inspector Edgar\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|Beau Brummell\n|Heckler\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|The Men of Sherwood Forest\n|Town Crier\n|\n|-\n|''Devil's Point\n|Marne, company executive\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1955\n|The Mysterious Bullet\n|Davy Charlesworth\n|\n|-\n|Stolen Time\n|Scotland Yard detective\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=5|1956\n|Keep It Clean\n|Police Sergeant\n|\n|-\n|Eyewitness\n|Cinema Commissionaire\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|Destination Death\n|Police Sgt\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|The Battle of the River Plate\n|Guns – HMS Exeter\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|The Hideout\n|Greeko\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=3|1957\n|The Crooked Sky\n|Commissioner\n|\n|-\n|The Big Chance\n|Saw Mill Man\n|\n|-\n|The Birthday Present\n|Cellblock Officer\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|rowspan=3|1958\n|Dunkirk\n|Chief, Sheerness Dockyard\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|A Night to Remember\n|Chief Officer Henry Wilde – Titanic\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|Corridors of Blood\n|Chief Inspector\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|rowspan=6|1959\n|Behemoth the Sea Monster\n|Naval Commander\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|Innocent Meeting\n|Macey\n|\n|-\n|A Woman's Temptation\n|\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|Man Accused\n|\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|Ben-Hur\n|Hortator\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|Date at Midnight\n|Inspector\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=3|1960\n|Night Train for Inverness\n|Sergeant\n|\n|-\n|Jackpot\n|George\n|\n|-\n|The Trials of Oscar Wilde\n|Court Usher\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=3|1961\n|Gorgo\n|First Colonel\n|\n|-\n|Feet of Clay\n|Warder\n|\n|-\n|The Curse of the Werewolf\n|Irate Farmer\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1963\n|The Haunting\n|Hugh Crain\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|The Runaway\n|Norring\n|\n|-\n|1964\n|Nothing but the Best\n|Jutson\n|\n|-\n|1965\n|He Who Rides a Tiger\n|Prison Governor\n|\n|-\n|1966\n|A Woman's Temptation\n|\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|1967\n|Frankenstein Created Woman\n|Guard\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|1970\n|Perfect Friday\n|Bank Commissionaire\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1971\n|10 Rillington Place\n|Man in Pub\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|Macbeth\n|Old Soldier\n|Uncredited\n|}\nTelevision\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable jquery-tablesorter\"\n!Year\n!Title\n!Role\n!Episodes\n|-\n|1952–1955\n|BBC Sunday-Night Theatre\n|Courier Pilot\nParty Guest\n|\n|-\n|1954\n|Fabian of the Yard\n|Harry\n|\n|-\n|1955\n|The Hole in the Wall\n|2nd Policeman\n|TV movie\n|-\n|1955–1961\n|The Vise\n|Police Sergeant\nPoliceman\nMarshall\nWarehouseman\nMansfield\nMr. Peters\nFirst Detective\nP.C.
