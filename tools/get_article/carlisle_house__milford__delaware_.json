It was built in 1794, and is a two-story, five-bay, frame building with a gable roof with dormers.  It has a two-story rear wing and two side wings; one a conservatory and the other a garage. It has a pent roof across the front with a pedimented entrance hood supported by paired Doric order columns.  The house was built by a ship's carpenter, David West, and is one of the last surviving artifacts from a once prosperous shipbuilding industry.\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.\nReferences"
