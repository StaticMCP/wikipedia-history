During the battle, the VIII Corps of the Prussian Army, under the command of General of the Infantry August Karl von Goeben, suddenly attacked and defeated a French force under the command of General de Brigade Guillaume Briand. The French suffered heavy losses. After their victory at Buchy, German troops captured Rouen.\nBackground\nAfter capturing Amiens at the end of November 1870, the commander of the Prussian First Army, Edwin von Manteuffel, continued to march towards Rouen, a city located on the Seine in Normandy. Aiming to attack a French division under the command of General Briand, the First Army marched with VIII Corps on the right flank, through Poix and Forges, and I Corps, on the left, through Breteuil. The French had deployed before Rouen to defend the city, but had not yet finished building up their defenses.\nOn 2 December, French cavalry sent to scout the Germans discovered the enemy at Forges-les-Eaux and Formiere. Examining the situation, German forces departed for Grandvillers and Gaillefontaine on 3 December. Early in the morning of 4 December, the German VIII Corps descended on Formiere and discovered that the French had abandoned it. Afterward, von Goeben's forces fiercely attacked the French army stationed on the heights of Maquency and Bosc-Bordel, on the way to Rouen. The French were eventually dislodged from their defensive position by the German 15th Infantry Division and had to retreat to the village of Buchy.\nBattle\nAt Buchy, the French turned and attempted to repel the Germans long enough to board their troops onto the railway carriages that were waiting for them. The French resisted weakly, despite their solid defensive position. During the battle, although the scouts of the French Guards fought fiercely, the French Garde Mobiles and franc-tireurs were wiped out by German artillery. The battle ended with the defeat of the French, forcing them to abandon the ambulance from Switzerland, along with their portable equipment.\nAftermath\nEventually, the situation of the French National Guard assembled at Rouen became dire, and the French abandoned Rouen when the Germans advanced. On 6 December, Rouen was occupied by a large German garrison. The 5th of December is the anniversary of the victory of Frederick the Great over the Austrians at the Battle of Leuthen, and of von Goeben's victory when he entered Rouen without expending a single bullet.\nReferences"
