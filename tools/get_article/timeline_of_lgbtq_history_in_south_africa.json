The amendment also raised the age of consent for male homosexual activity from 16 to 19, although \"sodomy\" and \"unnatural acts\" were already criminal. Openly gay nationalist composer Hubert du Plessis appears before Parliament to protest the tightening of anti-homosexuality laws.\n1970s\n1971\n* Between 1971 and 1989, homosexual soldiers in the South African Defence Forces (SADF) were forced to submit to \"curing\" their homosexuality.

A subsequent court decision in 1998 will establish that the crime of sodomy was legally invalid from this date.\n1997\n* 4 February – The final Constitution comes into force, including the same anti-discrimination protections as the Interim Constitution.\n1998\n* 8 May – In the case of National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Justice, a judge of the Witwatersrand Local Division of the High Court declares the criminalisation of sodomy and \"unnatural sexual acts\", and section 20A of the Sexual Offences Act, to be unconstitutional for violating the anti-discrimination clause of the Constitution.\n* 9 October – The Constitutional Court unanimously confirms the judgment of the High Court in the National Coalition case.\n* 30 November – Gay rights and anti-apartheid activist Simon Nkoli dies of an AIDS-related secondary infection.\n1999\n* 12 February – In the case of National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Home Affairs, three judges of the Cape Provincial Division of the High Court rule that it is unconstitutional for the government to provide immigration benefits to the foreign spouses of South Africans but not to the foreign same-sex partners of South Africans. The declaration of invalidity is suspended for one year to allow Parliament to correct the law.\n* 2 December – The Constitutional Court unanimously confirms the judgment of the High Court in the second National Coalition case, but removes the suspension of the order and instead \"reads in\" words to the law to immediately extend immigration benefits to same-sex partners.\n2000s\n2001\n* 25 September – In the case of Satchwell v President of the Republic of South Africa, a judge of the Transvaal Provincial Division of the High Court rules that financial benefits provided to the spouses of judges must also be provided to the same-sex life partners of judges.\n* 28 September – In the case of Du Toit v Minister of Welfare and Population Development, a judge of the Transvaal Provincial Division rules that same-sex partners must be allowed to jointly adopt children and to adopt each other's children, a right which was previously limited to married spouses.\n2002\n* 25 July – The Constitutional Court unanimously confirms the judgment of the High Court in the Satchwell case, but modifies the order to limit the benefits to same-sex life partners who have undertaken \"reciprocal duties of support\".\n* 10 September – The Constitutional Court unanimously confirms the judgment and order of the High Court in the Du Toit case.\n* 18 October – In the case of Fourie v Minister of Home Affairs, a judge of the Transvaal Provincial Division dismisses the application of a lesbian couple to have their union recognised as a marriage on the grounds that they failed to attack the constitutionality of the Marriage Act.\n* 31 October – In the case of J and B v Director General, Department of Home Affairs, a judge of the Durban & Coast Local Division of the High Court rules that a child born to a lesbian couple must be regarded as legitimate in law, and that both partners must be legally regarded as natural parents of the children and recorded as such on the birth register.\n2003\n* 28 March – The Constitutional Court unanimously confirms the judgment and order of the High Court in the J and B case.\n* 31 July – The Constitutional Court refuses leave for a direct appeal in the Fourie case, directing that the appeal should instead be heard by the Supreme Court of Appeal.\n2004\n* 15 March – The Alteration of Sex Description and Sex Status Act, 2003 comes into force, allowing transsexual and intersex people to change their legally recognised sex.\n* July – The Lesbian and Gay Equality Project launches a case in the Witwatersrand Local Division challenging the constitutionality of the provisions of the Marriage Act that limit marriage to opposite-sex couples.\n* 30 November – A five-judge panel of the Supreme Court of Appeal hands down a judgment in the Fourie case. The majority of four rules that the common-law definition of marriage must be extended to include same-sex marriages but that such marriages cannot be solemnised in South Africa until the Marriage Act is amended, either by Parliament or by the Equality Project's application. The judgment is appealed to the Constitutional Court by both parties.\n2005\n* 11 March – The Chief Justice instructs that the Equality Project case will be heard by the Constitutional Court simultaneously with the Fourie case.\n* 1 December – The Constitutional Court delivers its judgment in the Fourie and Equality Project cases (now known as Minister of Home Affairs v Fourie).
