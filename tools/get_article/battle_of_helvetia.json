The Boers numbered about 580 men (or 350), while the British forces were only about 350 men strong, however boasting a 120mm (4.7 inch) naval cannon. Muller and his troops took 235 prisoners of war and the cannon. After burning British army stocks, Boer troops fled for oncoming British reinforcements.\nAftermath\nMuller later became particularly famous for the capture of this cannon, jokingly called the 'Lady Roberts'. Major Cotton, 1st Battalion King's Liverpool Regiment, was convicted of quitting his post at Helvetia, but acquitted of neglect of good order and military discipline.\nLiterature\n*  At the website angloboerwar.com of David Biggins.\n* Grobler, J.E.H.: The War Reporter.
