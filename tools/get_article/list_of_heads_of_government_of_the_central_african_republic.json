There have been twenty-five heads of government of the Central African Republic and the Central African Empire. The office of prime minister, the head of government, was created when the Central African Republic became an autonomous territory of France in December 1958. It was originally the highest post of the Central African Republic, though France did maintain a governor in the territory. After the Central African Republic declared its independence and became a republic on 13 August 1960, David Dacko held both the prime minister and newly created president of the Central African Republic posts briefly before eliminating the prime minister position and placing all executive power in the office of the President.\nPresident Jean-Bédel Bokassa restored the office of prime minister to assist him in governing the country in 1975, shortly before he declared himself emperor. He selected as prime minister Elisabeth Domitien, who become Africa's first female head of government. After Domitien was removed from office, Bokassa named Ange-Félix Patassé to become his next prime minister. Patassé continued serving as prime minister after Bokassa declared the establishment of the Central African Empire in December 1976. Henri Maïdou succeeded Patassé and continued serving as prime minister after Bokassa was overthrown from power. During the following two years of Dacko's presidency, three more politicians served as prime minister. The post was abolished when Dacko was overthrown from the presidency by Andre Kolingba on 1 September 1981. The position, as it exists today, was recreated in 1991, when President Kolingba was forced to relinquish some of the executive power. The president has the authority to name the prime minister and can remove them from office at any time. The prime minister is the head of the government; within days of being appointed, they must select individuals for their Cabinet, who they will work with to coordinate the government.\nThe current prime minister of the Central African Republic is Félix Moloua, since 7 February 2022.\nList of officeholders\n;Political parties\n|Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa (MESAN)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Central African Democratic Union (UDC)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Central African Democratic Rally (RDC)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Civic Forum (FC)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Social Democratic Party (PSD)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People (MLPC)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|National Unity Party (PUN)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Patriotic Front for Progress (FPP)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|United Hearts Movement (MCU)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n;Other affiliations\n|Independent|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"5%\"|\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\"|Portrait\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"20%\"|Name\n! colspan=\"3\" width=\"20%\"|Term of office\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" width=\"10%\"|Political affiliation\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"20%\"|Notes\n|-\n! width=\"20%\"|Took office\n! width=\"20%\"|Left office\n! width=\"20%\"|Time in office\n|-\n! colspan=\"9\"|Central African Republic (1958–1960; )\n|-\n| 1\n|\n| Barthélemy Boganda\n| 8 December 1958\n| 29 March 1959\n|\n! style=\"background:\" |\n| MESAN\n| Founder of the MESAN party; negotiated for the independence of Oubangui-Chari and named the country the \"Central African Republic\".\n|-\n| —\n|\n| Abel Goumba\n| 30 March 1959\n| 30 April 1959\n|\n! style=\"background:\" |\n| MESAN\n| Served as acting prime minister; had an internal struggle for power with Dacko after Boganda's death.\n|-\n| 2\n|\n| David Dacko\n| 1 May 1959\n| 13 August 1960\n|\n! style=\"background:\" |\n| MESAN\n| Seized power from Goumba, with the support of high commissioner Roger Barberot, the Bangui chamber of commerce and Boganda's widow, Michelle Jourdain.\n|-\n! colspan=\"9\"|Central African Republic (1960–1976; )\n|-\n| 1\n|\n| David Dacko\n| 13 August 1960\n| 14 August 1960\n|\n! style=\"background:\" |\n| MESAN\n| Also served as head of state (President) upon independence.\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\" | Post abolished (14 August 1960 – 1 January 1975)\n|-\n| 2\n|\n| Elisabeth Domitien\n| 2 January 1975\n| 7 April 1976\n|\n! style=\"background:\" |\n| MESAN\n| First female head of government in Africa.\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\" | Vacant (8 April 1976 – 4 September 1976)\n|-\n| 3\n|\n| Ange-Félix Patassé\n| 5 September 1976\n| 3 December 1976\n|\n! style=\"background:\" |\n| MESAN\n| Later served as President (1993–2003).\n|-\n! colspan=\"9\"|Central African Empire (1976–1979)\n|-\n| 1\n|\n| Ange-Félix Patassé\n| 8 December 1976\n| 14 July 1978\n|\n! style=\"background:\" |\n| MESAN\n| &nbsp;\n|-\n| 2\n|\n| Henri Maïdou\n| 14 July 1978\n| 21 September 1979\n|\n! style=\"background:\" |\n| MESAN\n| Wrote a letter on 4 September 1979 to the French government officials, asking them to put an end to Bokassa's tyrannical rule.

When the Central African Republic became a territorial autonomy, he served as the acting leader the government from 1 December 1958 to 8 December 1958.\n*  Boganda was killed in a mysterious plane crash on 29 March 1959, while en route to Bangui. The exact cause of the crash was not determined, but sabotage was widely suspected. Experts found a trace of explosives in the plane's wreckage, but revelation of this detail was withheld. Although those responsible for the crash were never identified, people have suspected the French secret service, and even Boganda's wife, of being involved.\n*  Dacko removed the prime minister position and consolidated power in the presidency.\n*  President for Life Jean-Bédel Bokassa established a new government on 2 January 1975 and reintroduced the position of prime minister. He appointed Domitien as president of MESAN and Prime Minister of the Central African Republic.\n*  Domitien was removed from office because she publicly expressed her disapproval of Bokassa's plans to establish a monarchy in the Central African Republic. Bokassa then had her placed under house arrest.\n*  On 4 December 1976, Bokassa instituted a new constitution and declared the republic a monarchy, the Central African Empire.\n*  President Dacko appointed Maïdou as vice president on 27 September 1979.\n*  Prime Minister Ayandho was dismissed from office on 22 August 1980 by Dacko, who saw him as a political threat, and placed under house arrest.\n*  Dacko created the Central African Democratic Union in February 1980 as the country's only political party.\n*  Malendoma was removed as prime minister and replaced by Lakoué.\n*  In April 1995, Mandaba resigned as prime minister, preempting a threatened vote of no-confidence from his own party, following accusations of incompetence and corruption.\n*  Gbezera-Bria was named prime minister on 30 January 1997 to replace Ngoupande, who had been accused of siding with disgruntled soldiers, who had sparked a mutiny on 15 November 1996 to demand higher wages. Ngoupande also didn't strongly support President Patassé's decision to call in French troops to suppress the soldier uprising.\n*  President Patassé fired Dologuélé on 1 April 2001 and replaced him with Ziguélé, a senior diplomat who had served as ambassador to Benin for the last two years. Patassé did not provide an explanation for his decision, but political observers state that the nonpartisan Dologuélé had become widely unpopular with the ruling MLPC party.\n*  Ziguélé left office when François Bozizé seized power on 15 March 2003.\n*  On 11 December 2003, Goumba was dismissed as prime minister and was appointed as vice president.\n*  Gaombalet resigned as prime minister on 11 June 2005 after being elected as Speaker of the National Assembly on 7 June.\n*  In mid-January 2008, members of the National Assembly filed a censure motion against the Doté government, in response to countrywide civil service strike initiated by trade unions to protest the government's failure to pay arrears to government employees. On 18 January, Doté announced his resignation as prime minister.\n*  Tiangaye resigned with President Michel Djotodia in N'Djamena, Chad on 10 January 2014.\nTimeline\nColors =\nid:ind   value:rgb(0.8,0.8,0.8)       legend:None_(Independent)\nid:mesan value:rgb(0,0,0)             legend:MESAN\nid:udc   value:rgb(0.47,0.66,0.27)    legend:UDC\nid:rdc   value:rgb(0.98,0.89,0.23)    legend:RDC\nid:fc    value:rgb(0.118,0.529,0.698) legend:FC\nid:psd   value:rgb(0.0,0.5,0.3)       legend:PSD\nid:mlpc  value:rgb(0.08,0.64,0.28)    legend:MLPC\nid:pun   value:rgb(0.678,0.847,0.901) legend:PUN\nid:fpp   value:rgb(0.999,0.509,0.509) legend:FPP\nid:mcu   value:rgb(0.04,0.45,0.78)    legend:MCU\nid:gray1  value:gray(0.85)\nid:gray2  value:gray(0.95)\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/01/1958 till:31/12/+1}}\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = gridcolor:gray1 unit:year increment:5 start:1960\nScaleMinor = gridcolor:gray2 unit:year increment:1 start:1958\nLegend     = columns:1 left:150 top:35 columnwidth:170\nTextData =\npos:(20,38) textcolor:black fontsize:M\ntext:\"Political party:\"\nBarData =\nbar:Boganda\nbar:Goumba\nbar:Dacko\nbar:Domitien\nbar:Patassé\nbar:Maïdou\nbar:Ayandho\nbar:Lebouder\nbar:Bozanga\nbar:Frank\nbar:Malendoma\nbar:Lakoué\nbar:Mandaba\nbar:Koyambounou\nbar:Ngoupandé\nbar:Bria\nbar:Dologuélé\nbar:Ziguélé\nbar:Gaombalet\nbar:Doté\nbar:Touadéra\nbar:Tiangaye\nbar:Nzapayeké\nbar:Kamoun\nbar:Sarandji\nbar:Ngrébada\nbar:Dondra\nbar:Moloua\nPlotData =\nwidth:5 align:left fontsize:9 shift:(5,-4) anchor:till\nbar:Boganda\nfrom: 08/12/1958 till: 29/03/1959 color:mesan text:\"Barthélemy Boganda\"\nbar:Goumba\nfrom: 30/03/1959 till: 30/04/1959 color:mesan\nfrom: 23/03/2003 till: 11/12/2003 color:fpp   text:\"Abel Goumba\"\nbar:Dacko\nfrom: 01/05/1959 till: 13/08/1960 color:mesan text:\"David Dacko\"\nbar:Domitien\nfrom: 02/01/1975 till: 07/04/1976 color:mesan text:\"Elisabeth Domitien\"\nbar:Patassé\nfrom: 05/09/1976 till: 03/12/1976 color:mesan\nfrom: 08/12/1976 till: 14/07/1978 color:mesan text:\"Ange-Félix Patassé\"\nbar:Maïdou\nfrom: 14/07/1978 till: 21/09/1979 color:mesan\nfrom: 21/09/1979 till: 26/09/1979 color:mesan text:\"Henri Maïdou\"\nbar:Ayandho\nfrom: 26/09/1979 till: 01/03/1980 color:mesan\nfrom: 01/03/1980 till: 22/08/1980 color:udc   text:\"Bernard Ayandho\"\nbar:Lebouder\nfrom: 12/11/1980 till: 04/04/1981 color:udc   text:\"Jean-Pierre Lebouder\"\nbar:Bozanga\nfrom: 04/04/1981 till: 01/09/1981 color:udc   text:\"Simon Narcisse Bozanga\"\nbar:Frank\nfrom: 15/03/1991 till: 04/12/1992 color:rdc   text:\"Édouard Frank\"\nbar:Malendoma\nfrom: 04/12/1992 till: 26/02/1993 color:fc    text:\"Timothée Malendoma\"\nbar:Lakoué\nfrom: 26/02/1993 till: 25/10/1993 color:psd   text:\"Enoch Derant Lakoué\"\nbar:Mandaba\nfrom: 25/10/1993 till: 12/04/1995 color:mlpc  text:\"Jean-Luc Mandaba\"\nbar:Koyambounou\nfrom: 12/04/1995 till: 06/06/1996 color:mlpc  text:\"Gabriel Koyambounou\"\nbar:Ngoupandé\nfrom: 06/06/1996 till: 30/01/1997 color:pun   text:\"Jean-Paul Ngoupandé\"\nbar:Bria\nfrom: 30/01/1997 till: 04/01/1999 color:ind   text:\"Michel Gbezera-Bria\"\nbar:Dologuélé\nfrom: 04/01/1999 till: 01/04/2001 color:ind   text:\"Anicet-Georges Dologuélé\"\nbar:Ziguélé\nfrom: 01/04/2001 till: 15/03/2003 color:mlpc  text:\"Martin Ziguélé\"\nbar:Gaombalet\nfrom: 12/12/2003 till: 11/06/2005 color:ind   text:\"Célestin Gaombalet\"\nbar:Doté\nfrom: 13/06/2005 till: 11/01/2008 color:ind   text:\"Élie Doté\"\nbar:Touadéra\nfrom: 22/01/2008 till: 17/01/2013 color:ind   text:\"Faustin-Archange Touadéra\"\nbar:Tiangaye\nfrom: 17/01/2013 till: 10/01/2014 color:ind   text:\"Nicolas Tiangaye\"\nbar:Nzapayeké\nfrom: 25/01/2014 till: 10/08/2014 color:ind   text:\"André Nzapayeké\"\nbar:Kamoun\nfrom: 10/08/2014 till: 02/04/2016 color:ind   text:\"Mahamat Kamoun\"\nbar:Sarandji\nfrom: 02/04/2016 till: 27/02/2019 color:ind   text:\"Simplice Sarandji\"\nbar:Ngrébada\nfrom: 27/02/2019 till: 28/02/2019 color:ind\nfrom: 28/02/2019 till: 15/06/2021 color:mcu   text:\"Firmin Ngrébada\"\nbar:Dondra\nfrom: 15/06/2021 till: 07/02/2022 color:ind   text:\"Henri-Marie Dondra\"\nbar:Moloua\nfrom: 07/02/2022 till: $today     color:mcu   text:\"Félix Moloua\"\n}}\nSee also\n* Politics of the Central African Republic\n* History of the Central African Republic\n* Emperor of Central Africa\n* List of heads of state of the Central African Republic\n* Vice President of the Central African Republic\n* List of colonial governors of Ubangi-Shari\nReferences\n;Specific\n;General\n* .\n* .\n*\n* .\n* .\n* .\n* .\n* .\n* .\n* .\nExternal links\n* [http://africanelections.tripod.com/cf.html Elections in the Central African Republic]\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13150044 BBC News Timeline: Central African Republic]"
