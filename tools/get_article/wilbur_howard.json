Howard played in the Brewers organization for the next four seasons, getting a September call-up in 1973, when he batted .205 in 39 at bats. The following spring, he was traded to the Astros in exchange for the star-crossed Larry Yount and another minor leaguer.\nHoward started the  season in the minor leagues, but was called up in mid-June, spending the rest of the season as the Astros' fourth outfielder. In , he remained in that role, although the Astros rotated their other outfielders (Greg Gross, César Cedeño, and José Cruz) out of the lineup often enough that Howard played in 121 games, batting .283 with 32 stolen bases, which was eighth in the league and second on the team to Cedeño's 50.\nIn , however, manager Bill Virdon moved Howard back into a more traditional fourth outfielder role, and he continued to serve in that capacity for three seasons. After spending  in the minor leagues with the Charleston Charlies, Howard called it quits.\nReferences\nSources"
