Edwards would not have an opportunity to record as a leader for another seven years, but the largely straight-ahead music has dated pretty well.\"\nThe authors of The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings wrote: \"some of the material points in the direction of Coltrane and even Ornette Coleman; though never remotely avant-garde, Teddy knew what was happening on the scene... he was able to combine his usual easy, blues-inflected swing with something harder and darker.\"\nWriting for DownBeat, Dan Morgenstern commented: \"The session was perfectly cast, and it adds up to a generous helping of well-crafted, well-played contemporary jazz without convenient labels... All told, a feather in Edwards'... cap.\"\nTrack listing\nAll compositions by Teddy Edwards\n# \"It's All Right\" - 5:18\n# \"Going Home\" - 5:00\n# \"Afraid of Love\" - 5:05\n# \"Wheelin' and Dealin'\" - 6:53\n# \"Mamacita Lisa\" - 4:24\n# \"Back Alley Blues\" - 4:29\n# \"The Cellar Dweller\" - 4:54\n# \"Moving In\" - 5:58\nPersonnel\n*Teddy Edwards - tenor saxophone\n*Jimmy Owens - trumpet, flugelhorn\n*Garnett Brown - trombone\n*Cedar Walton - piano\n*Ben Tucker - double bass\n*Lenny McBrowne - drums\nReferences"
