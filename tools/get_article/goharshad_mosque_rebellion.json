Responding to a cleric, who denounced the Shah's \"heretical\" innovations, westernizing, corruption, and heavy consumer taxes, many merchants and locals took refuge in the shrine, chanted slogans such as \"The Shah is a new Yazid,\" likening him to the Umayyad caliph.\nFor four full days, local police and the army refused to violate the shrine. The standoff was ended when reinforcements from Iranian Azerbaijan region arrived and broke into the shrine, killing dozens and injuring hundreds, and marking a final rupture between Shia clergy and the Shah.\nToll\nAccording to a report of the Research Institute of Baqir al-'Ulum, which may have deliberately exaggerated the numbers, the number of killed by Reza Shah's forces was between 2000 and 5000. According to a British report, which may have deliberately underplayed the numbers, the outcome of the event resulted in 2 Army officers and 18 soldiers killed; 2 soldiers executed on the spot for disobedience; 1 soldier committed suicide; there were 800-1200 dead among the villagers, 100-500 wounded and 800 arrested.\nSee also\n* Grand Mosque seizure\n* Kashf-e hijab\n* Abadan Crisis\n* White Revolution\n* Iranian Revolution\n* List of modern conflicts in the Middle East\nReferences"
