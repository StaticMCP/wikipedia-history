Below that are lists of university colleges and other recognised bodies (institutions with degree awarding powers), followed by a list of defunct institutions.\nUniversities alphabetically\nThis list follows the list of recognised bodies on the UK government website. All the institutions on this list are recognised bodies with university status, indicated either by their use of university title in their name on the recognised bodies list or by reference to the Office for Students database for the few universities that do not use the title in their name. Member institutions of the University of London are listed here if they hold university status.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable sticky-header col5right\"\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Arms\n! University\n!

Separate citations are given for institutions that have been awarded university college title recently and are not yet shown under that name on the recognised bodies list or which do not use the title in their name.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Arms\n!University\n!Established\n!University college status\n!Total students\n!

Some also hold their own degree awarding powers and, since the passing of the University of London Act 2018, can apply for  university status in their own right without leaving the federal university. Member institutions that are also universities in their own right are listed both here and in the list of universities above. The university was an examining board until 1900, when it became a federal university and admitted colleges as \"Schools of the University\".\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable col5right\"\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Arms\n!
