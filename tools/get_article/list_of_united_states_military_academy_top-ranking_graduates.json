This article lists those alumni of the Military Academy who graduated top, or first, in their class.\nAll USMA cadets are rated each year; and get a final rating when they graduate. The cadet with the highest class rank is the one that has the best combination of score, academic standing, additional merits and demerits. The United States Military Academy opened in 1802; the initial class having just two cadets.
