He was also a serious actor who appeared in a number of films and television shows. King wrote several books, produced films, and appeared in plays. In his later years, he helped many philanthropic causes.\nEarly life\nKing was born in New York City, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants Minnie (née Solomon) and Bernard Kniberg, a handbag cutter. He had one older sister, Anita Kniberg. He spent his first years on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Later, King's family moved to Brooklyn. King used humor to survive the tough neighborhoods, and performed impersonations on street corners for pennies.\nWhen he was 14, King performed \"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\" on the radio program Major Bowes Amateur Hour. He lost first prize, but was invited to join a nationwide tour. At 15, King dropped out of high school to perform comedy at the Hotel Gradus in the Catskill Mountains. After one joke that made fun of the hotel's owner, he was fired, but he spent the remainder of that summer and the one that followed as emcee at Forman's New Prospect Hotel in Mountaindale, New York. He later worked in Canada in a burlesque house while also fighting as a professional boxer; he won 20 straight bouts  . Nursing a broken nose, King decided to quit boxing and focus on comedy. He worked as a doorman at the popular nightclub Leon and Eddie's, while performing comedy under the last name of the boxer who beat him, King.\nCareer\nKing began his comedy career with one-liner routines and other material concerning mothers-in-law and Jews. His style of comedy changed when he saw Danny Thomas in the early 1950s. King realized that Thomas was speaking to his audience, not at them, and was getting a better response. King changed his own style from one-liners to a more conversational style that used everyday life for humor.\nHis wife had persuaded the New Yorker to forsake Manhattan for suburban Forest Hills, Queens. In the 1950s, his family and he lived in Rockville Centre, New York, and later in Kings Point, Long Island, where he lived for the rest of his life. There, he developed comedy revolving around life in suburbia. With many Americans moving to the suburbs, King's humor took hold.\nLike many other Jewish comics, King worked the Catskill circuit known as the Borscht Belt.\nHe was soon opening for Judy Garland, Patti Page, Nat King Cole, Billy Eckstine, Lena Horne, and Tony Martin. When Martin was cast in the movie Hit the Deck, he got King his first movie role.\nHe played small roles in movies in the 1950s, but disliked stereotypical roles that he described as \"always the sergeant from Brooklyn named Kowalski.\" Typical of this was his role as Sgt Buzzer in the WW2 film On the Fiddle (1961).\nHis career took off after appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show, The Perry Como Show, and The Garry Moore Show.\nHe performed at President John F. Kennedy's inaugural ball in 1961.\nLiving just outside New York City, King was frequently available when Ed Sullivan needed a short-notice fill-in. He became a regular guest host for The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.\nand Johnny Carson in 1968]]\nHe hosted the Oscars in 1972.\nHe headlined two unsold television pilots on CBS, both titled The Alan King Show. The first aired on September 8, 1961; the second aired on July 12, 1986.\nKing eventually expanded his range and made a name for himself in a wide variety of films. He frequently worked for director Sidney Lumet, beginning with Bye Bye Braverman (1968) and The Anderson Tapes (1971). Lumet later cast him in a starring role in Just Tell Me What You Want (1980), a provocative comedy about a ruthless business mogul and his TV-producer mistress (Ali MacGraw). He also played in an uncredited cameo in Lumet's Prince of the City (1981).\nHe often portrayed gangsters, as in I, the Jury (1982) and ''Cat's Eye (1985).  He had another major role in Memories of Me'' (1988) as the so-called \"king of the Hollywood extras\", portraying Billy Crystal's terminally ill father. King played the role of corrupt union official Andy Stone in Martin Scorsese's 1995 film Casino. He appeared in Night and the City (1992), also starring Robert De Niro.\nKing was the long-standing host of the New York Friars Club celebrity roasts and served as the club's historian.\nKing was the first recipient (1988) of the award for American Jewish humor from the National Foundation for Jewish Culture. The award was ultimately named in his honor.\nHe inspired other comedians, including Joan Rivers, Jerry Seinfeld, Larry David, Billy Crystal, Robert Klein, and Bill Cosby.\nPersonal life\nKing married Jeanette Sprung in 1947. They had three children: Andrew, Robert, and Elainie Ray. His wife persuaded him to move to Forest Hills, Queens, for their children's sake. In the 1950s, his family and he lived in Rockville Centre, New York, and later in Kings Point, Long Island, where he lived for the rest of his life.\nThroughout his life, King was deeply involved in charity work. He founded the Alan King Medical Center in Jerusalem, raised funds for the Nassau Center for Emotionally Disturbed Children (near his home in Kings Point, New York), and established a chair in dramatic arts at Brandeis University. He also created the Laugh Well program, which sends comedians to hospitals to perform for patients. In the 1970s, King turned his passion for tennis into a professional tournament at Caesars Palace Las Vegas called the Alan King Tennis Classic, which was aired nationally on the TVS Television Network. He also created the Toyota Comedy Festival.\nDeath\nKing, who smoked cigars heavily (a fact that came up in his routines from time to time), died at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan on May 9, 2004, from lung cancer. He was buried in Mount Hebron Cemetery in Flushing, Queens. The film Christmas with the Kranks was dedicated to his memory. He is also recognized in the end credits of Rush Hour 3.\nWork\nFilm\n* 1955 Hit the Deck as Shore Patrol (debut film role)\n* 1956 Miracle in the Rain as Sergeant Gilbert 'Gil' Parker\n* 1956 The Girl He Left Behind as Maguire\n* 1957 The Helen Morgan Story as Benny Weaver\n* 1961 On the Fiddle as T/Sgt Buzzer\n* 1968 Bye Bye Braverman as The Rabbi\n* 1971 The Anderson Tapes as Angelo\n* 1977 Seventh Avenue (TV miniseries) as Harry Lee\n* 1978 How to Pick Up Girls! as Manny Shiller\n* 1980 Just Tell Me What You Want as Max Herschel\n* 1981 Prince of the City as himself (cameo, uncredited)\n* 1982 I, the Jury as Charles Kalecki\n* 1982 Author!
