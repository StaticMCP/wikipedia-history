The Interagency Working Group (IWG) has declassified an estimated 8 million pages of documents from the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Army intelligence. The group issued three reports to Congress between 1999 and 2007.\nSome of the declassified documents center on reports of the Japanese exploitation of 'comfort women' before and during World War&nbsp;II, as well as the FBI and CIA's investigations of Adolf Hitler's possible survival after the war ended.\nHistory\nThe group was created by the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act, passed in 1998, and the Japanese Imperial Government Disclosure Act of 2000. Between 1999 and 2016, the working group declassified and opened to the public an estimated 8 million pages of documents, including 1.2 million pages of Office of Strategic Services records, over 100,000 pages of Central Intelligence Agency files, more than 350,000 pages of Federal Bureau of Investigation subject files, and nearly 300,000 pages of Army intelligence files. The IWG has issued three reports to Congress (in October 1999, March 2002, and April 2007) and it issues news releases and occasional newsletters.\nOn March 25, 2005, President George W. Bush signed into law legislation pushing back the group's sunset date to March 2007. Documents related to the project have been released as late as 2017.\nSummary\nNazi War Crimes\nDocuments declassified under the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act, which began to be released online by the early 2010s, included hundreds of pages of documents compiled by the FBI and CIA in relation to the health, psychological profile, and possible survival of Adolf Hitler following the end of World War II in Europe (when Western scholars believe he died by suicide). One report to the CIA included a&nbsp;purported photograph of Hitler in Colombia, South America, the authenticity of which the agency did not endorse. Additional documents related to Hitler's possible survival were released in late 2017 along with files related to the investigation of the assassination of John F. Kennedy.\nJapanese Imperial Government\nAgencies were advised that particular attention should be given to locating any records related to \"so-called 'comfort women' program, the Japanese systematic enslavement of women of subject populations for sexual purposes.\" However, the IWG expressed its disappointments because the IWG uncovered and released few Asian theatre records. Thus, the IWG apologized to the Global Alliance for Preserving the History of WWII in Asia which was involved in the commencement of this project.\nThe IWG published a report titled Researching Japanese War Crimes, Introductory Essays. In the report, the IWG analyzed the reason why comfort women documents were scarce:\nThe report further stated that this practice was not charged with criminal acts:\nThere was one exception, for an offense occurring in the Dutch East Indies.\nResearch cost and scale\nAs of 2007, the IWG estimated that the implementation of the two Disclosure Acts costed $30 million. From a total of 620 million pages, U.S. Government agencies screened over 100 million pages for relevance under the NWCDA and screened over 17 million pages under the JIGDA. Only a small percentage of these screened pages were found to be responsive to the Disclosure Acts: nearly 8.5 million pages of documents were relevant to the NWCDA, and over 142,000 pages were relevant to the JIGDA.\nMembership\nThe members of the group are appointed by the president.
