They all run their restaurant, the Lingnan, owned by Kinman Quon. His wife, Amy Quon, owns the fast-food restaurant Chicken For Lunch in Downtown. The Lingnan features many traditional Chinese foods and drinks, and usually gets large numbers of customers. Miles, wants the restaurant to be modern, not old-fashioned. He is loyal to his family and is \"the number one son\", and he takes that role very seriously. Kinman does not like change, he likes the Lingnan the way it is, because it has been doing fine for sixty years.\nMandy, Amy and Kinman's daughter, lives with her parents and currently works nights at the restaurant. She is dating a man named Ajit, who also works at the Lingnan. She dreams of a life of glamour and fame, and is not completely devoted to the restaurant. Marty, who also lives with Amy and Kinman, is the \"slacker\", and does not want to work for his desired riches. Amy, their mother, loves her children and takes control of all aspects of their life as much as she can.\nCast\n* Miles Quon: eldest son of Kitman and Amy Quon, manager of Lingnan restaurant\n* Amy Quon: over-protective mother of Miles, Mandy, and Marty; wife of Kinman\n* Kinman Quon: owner of the Lingnan restaurant, the backbone and stabilizing member of the family\n* Mandy Quon: middle child and only daughter of Amy and Kinman, her hobby is skydiving\n* Marty Quon: youngest child of Amy and Kinman, his dream is to have an ice cream truck\n* Ajit: Mandy's boyfriend and restaurant employee\nNominations and awards\nThe Quon Dynasty was nominated for Best Documentary Series and Best Production Reflecting Cultural Diversity in the Alberta Film and Television Awards.\nEpisodes\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"background: #FFFFFF; width:98%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"vertical-align: bottom; background: #FFFFBF; width: 10%;\"|Season Episode #\n! style=\"vertical-align: bottom; background: #FFFFBF; width: 10%;\"|Series Episode #\n! style=\"vertical-align: bottom; background: #FFFFBF;\"|Episode Name\n! style=\"vertical-align: bottom; background: #FFFFBF; width: 15%;\"|Air Date\n| ShortSummary = A museum curator offers to showcase the Lingnan at the opening of a travelling exhibit. It’s only for a few hours. What could go wrong?\n| LineColor = FFFFBF\n}}\n| ShortSummary = Mandy decides to fulfill a lifelong dream, skydiving, sending her worry-wart mother into a rapidly spiraling meltdown. Meanwhile, Miles finally takes a break from his workaholic life to hit the town with some new buddies: rockabilly dudes he met (where else?) at the Lingnan. Now Amy’s fretting about him, too. Is her only daughter about to leap to her certain death? And will Miles come home with a tattoo?\n| LineColor = FFFFBF\n}}\n| ShortSummary = Larry, Moe and Curly (aka Miles, Marty and Ajit) decide to purchase and refit a rusty, clunky catering truck. Their half-baked objective: to make some easy money by taking the Lingnan brand to the downtown streets. Mandy, miffed at being left on the sidelines of this boys-only misadventure, launches a moneymaking scheme of her own.\n| LineColor = FFFFBF\n}}\n| ShortSummary = Mandy feels that the family needs some bonding time away from the restaurant. Mandy insists the family gets away from the restaurant (and the bickering) and sells them on the romantic idea of a camping getaway, even though they have never attempted anything more rustic than a patio barbecue. They stuff themselves into a rented van and head to the mountains—for an outdoors adventure they’ll never forget (no matter how hard they may try).\n| LineColor = FFFFBF\n}}\n| ShortSummary = Amy is appalled when Marty throws a lavish birthday party for his wiener dog Tai Chi. What kind of son throws a party for a stupid dog, but never even acknowledges his own mother’s birthday (which happens to be approaching)?

True to form, though, they turn this sweet idea into a no-holds-barred sibling competition for their mom’s affection.\n| LineColor = FFFFBF\n}}\n| ShortSummary = Marty decides to follow his dreams and write a song. Miles takes Kinman to pick out a better house wine.\n| LineColor = FFFFBF\n}}\n| ShortSummary = Amy is both flattered and terrified when she receives a surprise request to teach a cooking class. Can she rope Miles into serving as her sidekick (and safety net)? At the restaurant, the kids convince a reluctant Kinman to try out an art course (which would also get him out from underfoot).

The kids decide to stage an intervention. If you're having a hard time finding that perfect shiny bauble to bring you good fortune for years to come, that's probably because Amy has already bought them all. Meanwhile, Marty reveals his latest money-making scheme – Lingnan branded merchandise. Anybody wanna buy a Lingnan backscratcher?\n| LineColor = FFFFBF\n}}\n| EpisodeNumber = 9\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 9\n| ShortSummary = Bossy mom Amy launches Miles and Marty on a weight-loss competition, in an effort to tame her sons' ever-increasing waistlines. Business is booming for the overworked crew at the Lingnan—and so, unfortunately, are Miles' and Marty's waistlines. Their bossy mom Amy launches them on a weight-loss program.
