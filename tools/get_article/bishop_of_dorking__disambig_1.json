The title takes its name from the town of Dorking in Surrey. However, the bishop of Dorking lives in Guildford.\nThe first suffragan bishop was appointed for the Diocese of Winchester; the see's erection in 1904 and Boutflower's appointment in 1905 was in order to supplement the work of the suffragan bishops of Southampton and of Guildford — the latter, George Sumner, was ageing. The appointment of the only bishop of Dorking for that diocese was, functionally, an interruption in the See of Guildford; Boutflower took on suffragan duties in the north of the diocese. When Boutflower departed for missionary duty in Japan, Sumner was persuaded to resign the See of Guildford and John Randolph was appointed bishop suffragan of Guildford, succeeding Boutflower in duties and Sumner in his see.\nWinchester diocese was subdivided in 1927 to create what is now the Diocese of Guildford, in which the appointment of bishops of Dorking resumed in 1968.\nList of the bishops of Dorking\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color: #7F1734; color: white;\"|Bishops of Dorking\n|-valign=top\n! style=\"background-color:#D4B1BB\" width=\"10%\"|From\n! style=\"background-color:#D4B1BB\" width=\"10%\"|Until\n! style=\"background-color:#D4A1BB\" width=\"30%\"|Incumbent\n! style=\"background-color:#D4B1BB\" width=\"45%\"|Notes\n|-valign=top bgcolor=\"white\"\n|align=\"center\"| 1905 ||align=\"center\"| 1909 ||  Cecil Boutflower || Suffragan for north of Winchester diocese (see Bishop suffragan of Guildford) Translated to South Tokyo, and later to Southampton.\n|-valign=top bgcolor=\"#F7F0F2\"\n|align=\"center\"| 1909 ||align=\"center\"| 1968 ||colspan=\"2\"| in abeyance\n|-valign=top bgcolor=\"white\"\n|align=\"center\"| 1968 ||align=\"center\"| 1986 ||  Kenneth Evans ||\n|-valign=top bgcolor=\"#F7F0F2\"\n|align=\"center\"| 1986 ||align=\"center\"| 1996 ||  David Wilcox ||\n|-valign=top bgcolor=\"white\"\n|align=\"center\"| 1996 ||align=\"center\"| 2015 ||  Ian Brackley || Retired 30 September 2015.\n|-valign=top bgcolor=\"#F7F0F2\"\n|align=\"center\"| 2016 ||align=\"center\"| 2023 ||  Jo Bailey&nbsp;Wells || From her consecration, on 29 June 2016; resigned .\n|-valign=top bgcolor=\"white\"\n|align=\"center\"| 2023 ||align=\"center\"| present ||  Paul Davies || Consecrated 29 September 2023.\n|-valign=top bgcolor=\"#F7F0F2\"\n|align=\"center\" colspan=\"4\"| Source(s):\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.crockford.org.uk/section.asp?id=9 Crockford's Clerical Directory - Listings]\n----"
