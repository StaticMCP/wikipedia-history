Tobacco taxes in Germany are among the lowest in Europe. Germany ranks last on the Tobacco Control Scale and has sometimes been referred to as the \"smoker's paradise\" of Europe. According to German addiction researcher , Germany has \"[...] more cigarette vending machines than any other country in the world.\"\nUnder federal law, the manufacture, import, distribution, and advertisement of tobacco is regulated, while the 16 federal states of Germany each have their own legislation regarding smoking in public places, which range from relatively weak regulations to full smoking bans in all licensed premises, childcare facilities, schools and governmental institutions.\nAs of 2024, nearly 40% of the German population live in the three states which ban smoking in all restaurants, pubs, cafés and nightclubs (Bavaria, North Rhine-Westphalia, and Saarland). The other 13 states permit smoking in designated rooms or in bars with a floor area of less than 75 square meters.\nAccording to a 2013 micro-census survey, 24.5% of the German population aged fifteen years and over are smokers (29% of men, 20% of women). Among the 18–25 age group, 35.2% are smokers.\nPrevalence\nIn 2005, 27% of the population were current smokers. 23% were daily smokers (28% of men and 19% of women), while 4% smoked occasionally. The highest ratio of daily smokers was in the 20–24 age group: 38% of men and 30% of women. According to a 2010 study by University of Bielefeld, 9.9% of all 15-year-old males and 10.8% of 15-year-old females smoked daily, which showed a strong decline during the previous decade.\nAs in other industrial countries, the prevalence of smoking in Germany is lower among people with higher education levels.\nA 2009 comparative study found that 25.1% of male and 20.6% of female medical students in Göttingen smoked, while in London the percentages were only 10.9% and 9.1%.\nGermany had one of the largest numbers of cigarette vending machines per capita in the world.\nCigarette smoking among adults, 2013\nAccording to a 2013 microcensus, about one in four (24.5%) people aged 15 years and over was a smoker: 20.9% regularly, and 3.6% occasionally. The rate of ex-smokers was 19.3%. The average age at which smokers begin is 17.8 years of age (in the age group of 15- to 20-year-olds the average age is 15.4 years).\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+ Percentage of smokers by age and gender\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe8\"\n! style=\"text-align:center\" | Age (y)\n! style=\"text-align:center\" | Male\n! style=\"text-align:center\" | Female\n|-\n|15–20 || 19.9% || 15.0%\n|-\n|20–25 || 39.9% || 32.8%\n|-\n|25–30 || 44.3% || 32.2%\n|-\n|30–35 || 42.5% || 28.3%\n|-\n|35–40 || 39.0% || 27.9%\n|-\n|40–45 || 38.3% || 30.3%\n|-\n|45–50 || 38.9% || 31.1%\n|-\n|50–55 || 36.7% || 28.3%\n|-\n|55–60 || 30.7% || 22.2%\n|-\n|60–65 || 24.9% || 16.8%\n|-\n|65–70 || 17.0% || 11.0%\n|-\n|70–75 || 12.5% || 6.7%\n|-\n| || 8.0% || 3.6%\n|}\nAnnual cigarette consumption per capita\nIn 2010, an average of 229 million cigarettes were smoked every day, corresponding to 1,021 cigarettes per capita.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+ Smoking behaviour by age and gender – as of 2006\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe8\"\n! style=\"text-align:center\" | Smoking behaviour\n! style=\"text-align:center\" | Women, 18 to 29\n! style=\"text-align:center\" | Women, 30 to 44\n! style=\"text-align:center\" | Women, 45 to 64\n! style=\"text-align:center\" | Women, 65 and older\n! style=\"text-align:center\" | Women, total\n! style=\"text-align:center\" | Men, 18 to 29\n! style=\"text-align:center\" | Men, 30 to 44\n! style=\"text-align:center\" | Men, 45 to 64\n! style=\"text-align:center\" | Men, 65 and older\n! style=\"text-align:center\" | Men, total\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | Daily smokers || 33.6% || 29.3% || 22.0% || 5.1% || 21.9% || 39.3% || 36.0% || 26.1% || 11.8% || 29.2%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | Occasional smokers || 11.0% || 7.4% || 5.3% || 2.4% || 6.1% || 14.4% || 8.3% || 6.9% || 3.8% || 8.1%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | Ex-smokers  || 14.6% || 24.1% || 25.5% || 21.2% || 22.3% || 14.7% || 23.9% || 38.2% || 52.1% || 31.8%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | Never smoked || 40.8% || 39.2% || 47.2% || 71.3% || 49.7% || 31.5% || 31.8% || 28.8% || 32.4% || 30.9%\n|-\n|}\nCigarette consumption per day\nAmount of smoked cigarettes per day, per Sozio-oekonomisches Panel (SOEP).\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+ Source: Sozio-oekonomische Panel (SOEP)\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe8\"\n! style=\"text-align:center\" | Cigarettes\n! style=\"text-align:center\" | Percentage, 2006\n! style=\"text-align:center\" | Percentage, 2012\n|-\n|0–4 || 7% || 14.7%\n|-\n|5–9 || 14% || 26.5%\n|-\n|10–14 || 22% || 19.8%\n|-\n|15–19 || 18% || 26.5%\n|-\n|20–24 || 24% || 5.6%\n|-\n|25–29 || 5% || 4.4%\n|-\n|30–34 || 5% || 2.6%\n|-\n|35–39 || 1% || —\n|-\n|40 and more || 4% || —\n|}\nTobacco consumption from 1991 until 2013\nAverage amount of cigarettes smoked daily, by year.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+ Source: Federal Statistical Office of Germany\n! style=\"text-align:center\" | Year\n! style=\"text-align:center\" | Cigarettes(in millions)\n|-\n|1991 || 401\n|-\n|1992 || 359\n|-\n|1993 || 351\n|-\n|1994 || 367\n|-\n|1995 || 370\n|-\n|1996 || 373\n|-\n|1997 || 377\n|-\n|1998 || 379\n|-\n|1999 || 398\n|-\n|2000 || 382\n|-\n|2001 || 390\n|-\n|2002 || 398\n|-\n|2003 || 363\n|-\n|2004 || 306\n|-\n|2005 || 262\n|-\n|2006 || 256\n|-\n|2007 || 251\n|-\n|2008 || 241\n|-\n|2009 || 237\n|-\n|2010 || 229\n|-\n|2011 || 240\n|-\n|2012 || 225\n|-\n|2013 || 220\n|}\nPolitical measures against smoking\nMisleading labels\nSince 2003, it has been illegal to label a tobacco product as \"light\", \"mild\", \"low-tar\" or to use any other wording that might suggest the product causes less harm than other tobacco products.\nAdvertising\nRadio and television advertising for tobacco products was banned in 1975. The Rundfunkstaatsvertrag (Interstate Broadcasting Treaty) of 1999 extended the ban to include sponsorship of television and radio shows.\nIn 2002, the Protection of Young Persons Act prohibited tobacco advertising in cinemas before 6 p.m. On 1 January 2007, the EU Tobacco Advertising Directive came into force, banning tobacco advertising on the internet, in newspapers, and in magazines. It also prohibited sponsorship of events broadcast internationally.\nGermany was the last EU member state to allow billboard and cinema advertising for tobacco, but this changed with new restrictions. Outdoor advertising is being phased out: tobacco products (from January 2022), heated tobacco (from January 2023), and e-cigarettes (from January 2024). Cinema advertising for tobacco was banned in 2021.\nWarning labels\nUnder the EU Tobacco Products Directive II, cigarette, rolling tobacco and hookah tobacco packages must cover 65% of their surface with combined pictorial and textual warnings on both large sides, plus additional warnings on the smaller sides. This has been mandatory since May 2017.\nTobacco taxation\nIn Germany, tobacco tax is calculated based on both the quantity of tobacco and the retail price (§ 3 TabakStG). The tax amount is printed on the Steuerbanderole (tax strip) of each package.\nIn 2002 and 2003, tax increases were introduced to finance anti-terrorist measures. In 2004 and 2005, further increases supported health insurance. In 2010, tax hikes were scheduled for five consecutive years, from 2011 to 2015.\nAs of 2015, the tobacco tax was 9.82 cents per cigarette plus 21.69% of the retail price, with a minimum of 19.636 cents per cigarette (excluding VAT).\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:50%;\"\n! Example calculation for a pack of 19 cigarettes at €5.00\n|-\n| align=\"center\"|19 × €0.0982 + €5.00 × 21.69% = €1.87 + €1.08 = €2.95\n|}\nSale restrictions\nSeveral laws regulate the retail sale of tobacco products in Germany.\n* Age limits: Under the Protection of Young Persons Act, it is unlawful to sell or supply tobacco products to anyone under 18. It is also illegal to allow minors to smoke in public places. While minors do not commit a crime by purchasing or consuming tobacco, retailers and other responsible persons commit an offence if they sell or tolerate consumption by minors. Police are obliged to confiscate tobacco from underage smokers. Before 2007 the minimum age was 16. Since 2009, all vending machines require ID verification (bank card, ID card or driving licence) to ensure buyers are 18 or older.\n* Package sizes: It is unlawful to sell packages containing fewer than 19 cigarettes or less than 30 g of fine-cut tobacco. Exceptions apply to cigars and cigarillos under certain conditions.\n* Retail price maintenance: Tobacco must be sold at the retail price printed on the tax strip. The only exception is free samples for advertising.\n* Prizes and promotions: Tobacco products may not be offered as prizes in commercial gaming or gambling, and no additional items may be included in a package except for change.\nFederal smoking ban\nThe Federal Non-Smoking Protection Act (Bundesnichtraucherschutzgesetz, BNichtrSchG) introduced a smoking ban in:\n* federal institutions and constitutional bodies of the federal government,\n* public transportation,\n* passenger stations of public railways.\nThe law does not apply to residential or accommodation facilities provided for personal use, and it allows for designated smoking rooms if federal conditions are met.\nSmoking ban by state\nFile:Paffilion.jpg|Smoking shelter in front of local administration\nFile:In Memoriam 31.12.2007.jpg|Memorial noting the introduction of the smoking ban in 2007 in all pubs, bars and restaurants in Bavaria\nFile:Airport Munich innen 2009 PD 20090404 027.JPG|A smoking room at Munich Airport in 2009\nFile:Rauchfrei.JPG|Smoking ban notification at Berlin Friedrichstraße railway station\nFile:Raucherbereich im Düsseldorfer Hauptbahnhof DSCF1367.jpg|Designated smoking zone at Düsseldorf central railway station\nBaden-Württemberg\nThe non-smoking protection law does not apply to cultural institutions (except cinemas) and sports facilities unless they are part of a school.\n*Restaurants, bars and discothèques: Ban with exceptions.
