The population was 2,515 at the 2020 census. Kingston is along the shores of Appletree Cove and Puget Sound, and is home to a major Washington State Ferry terminal linking it to Edmonds.\nGeography\nKingston is located in northeastern Kitsap County at  (47.798764, −122.499071), on the east side of the Kitsap Peninsula. Washington State Route 104 runs through the community from the Washington State Ferry terminal, leading northwest  to Port Gamble. Bremerton is  to the southwest by highway.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the Kingston CDP has a total area of , of which  are land and , or 10.31%, are water.\nClimate\n}}\nHistory\nFounded in 1853 by Benjamin Bannister, the community was originally known as \"Appletree Cove\". By 1880 it was a lumber town until the mill closed down in the early 20th century. Known as the \"little city by the sea\", Kingston is a northern gateway to the Olympic Peninsula and is the social and economic center of the north end of the Kitsap Peninsula.\nKing's Town\nIn 1869, W.S. Ladd and his wife Caroline built a cabin on Appletree Cove. Michael King then bought the cabin nine years later. He moved in along with ten oxen and ten men. They slowly logged the hills around Appletree Cove. King built many small buildings and shacks along the shore for his men and animals. In 1882, he was done and moved on. The shacks and bunkhouses were left behind and lived in by drifters, squatters and old loggers. People living in the area often referred to this as \"King's Town\", probably as a joke. The name slowly evolved into Kingston and stuck.\nResort town\nThe Kingston townsite was platted on April 24, 1890, by C.C. Calkins and Samuel B. Brierly. Calkins dreamed of Kingston as a resort town for vacationers from Seattle. Calkins called it \"the Monterey of Washington\". Calkins had drawings and designs for a giant hotel on the waterfront, with a boat launch, a church on the hill, and a college. After Calkins and Brierly platted the town, a lower than expected number of people showed up to settle there. Calkins then gave up and left. The town slowly grew, but not at the pace that Calkins had dreamed.\nDemographics\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 1,611 people, 685 households, and 452 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 977.2 people per square mile (377.0/km2). There were 773 housing units at an average density of 468.9/sq&nbsp;mi (180.9/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 91.1% White, 0.3% African American, 1.2% Native American, 2.3% Asian, 1.0% Pacific Islander, 1.6% from other races, and 2.6% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.7% of the population.\nThere were 685 households, out of which 30.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 54.9% were married couples living together, 7.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 34.0% were non-families. 26.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.35 and the average family size was 2.86.\nIn the CDP, the population was spread out, with 23.8% under the age of 18, 4.4% from 18 to 24, 28.9% from 25 to 44, 27.7% from 45 to 64, and 15.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 41 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.6 males.\nThe median income for a household in the CDP was $40,347, and the median income for a family was $54,583. Males had a median income of $43,839 versus $25,781 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $24,212. About 9.2% of families and 11.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 17.9% of those under age 18 and 13.7% of those age 65 or over.\nTransportation\nKingston has a Washington State Ferries terminal for auto/passenger service to Edmonds.\nIn September 2012, due to financial losses, the Port of Kingston discontinued its SoundRunner Kingston–Seattle passenger-only system. One of the former vessels, the Spirit of Kingston, was transferred to the King County Ferry District on March 18, 2013, for service as part of the King County Water Taxi fleet.\nIn January 2016 Kingston accepted delivery of a new modern fireboat. The new vessel is  long, can travel at , and can pump 2,700 gallons per minute. The Department of Homeland Security has provided small ports with grants to equip themselves with modern fireboats, with sealed cabins, that can also help counter other threats, like oil spills, or attacks by chemical or biological weapons. Two thirds of the cost of this fireboat, $409,813, were paid by a federal grant. The vessel also has modern infrared sensors, which can help in search and rescue missions, and search for the hot spot at the center of a fire. Kingston had a smaller, slower, less capable older  fireboat. Both vessels can project fire suppressant foam, less likely to sink flaming vessels, but experience with the older vessel suggests most of the fires the new vessel will fight will be on the shore, near the water.\nKitsap Fast Ferries began service from Kingston to Seattle in November 2018.\nEducation\nPublic education is provided by the North Kitsap School District.  Kingston's schools include Kingston Co-op Preschool, Gordon Elementary, Kingston Middle School, Spectrum Community School, Wolfle Elementary and Kingston High School.\nIn popular culture\nTaree is a popular American rock song by the band Soundgarden named after the Taree neighborhood in Kingston.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.portofkingston.org Port of Kingston]\n* [http://visitkitsap.com/cities.asp?ID=4 Kitsap Peninsula Visitor Information - Kingston]\n* [https://www.kingstonchamber.com/ Kingston Chamber of Commerce]"
