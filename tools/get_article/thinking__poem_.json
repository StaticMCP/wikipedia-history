      "text": "# Thinking (poem)\n\n\"Thinking\" is a poem written by Walter D. Wintle, a poet who lived in the late 19th and early 20th century. Little to nothing is known about any details of his life. \"Thinking\" is also known as \"The Man Who Thinks He Can\".\nIn the 20th century, different versions of the poem have been published. To this date, it is unknown which version correctly represents the original version, but it is strongly believed that the version below, published at least as early as 1905 (\"Unity\" College Magazine), embodies the original and unaltered poem. The exact date of the first, original publication of \"Thinking\" is unknown.\nPublications\nEarly publications of this poem - citing Walter D. Wintle as being the author - include:\n1905 - Unity\nPublished in 1905 by Unity Tract Society, Unity School of Christianity\nCalled \"Thinking\", by Walter D.
