It is one of the dioceses of the Original Province of the Anglican Catholic Church, and is not a part of the Anglican Communion. It is separate from the Free Church of England, the Anglican Ordinariate, the Society of St Wilfred and St Hilda, and the Church of England (Continuing). The Diocese was formed, like the rest of the ACC, in response to the alteration to the sacraments by the Church of England.\nThe Diocese of the United Kingdom is a Continuing Anglican church which arose from the Congress of St. Louis in 1977. It was established in 1992 as the Missionary Diocese of England and Wales.\nHistory\nThe Rev. Leslie Hamlett, and his congregation from Stoke-on-Trent, were instrumental in the founding of the Missionary Diocese. He had been ordained in the Church of England in 1962, and was a parish priest. Hamlett and his congregation left the Church of England in 1983. In March 1992, Hamlett was elected bishop when the Archbishop of the Anglican Catholic Church, William O. Lewis, visited his parish. On 1 August 1992, he was consecrated by Bishops James Orin Mote, William Francis Burns, Thomas Justin Kleppinger, Michael Dean Stephens, Joseph Philip Deyman, and James Richard McNeley as its first Bishop Ordinary. In the 1993 debate in Parliament concerning the Priests (Ordination of Women) Measure, Lord Sudeley advocated for the Anglican Catholic Church as the alternative for those rejecting the measure.\nHamlett was Bishop Ordinary until leaving the Anglican Catholic Church in 1997 to form the Holy Catholic Church Anglican Rite. The diocese was without a bishop until 2008, and was administered by Episcopal Visitors appointed by the Metropolitan Archbishop and a vicar general in lieu of a bishop. The Episcopal Visitors were Most Rev. John T. Cahoon Jr. (1997–2001), Most Rev. Mark Haverland (2001–2004), and Right Rev. Rommie M. Starks (2004–2008).\nIn March 2008, The Rev. Damien Mead was elected by the Diocese to be the second Bishop Ordinary. Previously, Mead had been the Vicar General. On 20 September 2008, he was consecrated as bishop by Starks (ACC Bishop of the Diocese of the Midwest, USA), The Right Rev. Arthur Roger Dawson (ACC Retired Bishop of Caracas, Venezuela), and The Right Rev. Denis Ian Dermot Hodge (ACC Bishop of New Zealand).\nSince 1998, it has been a registered charity of England and Wales (1068168).\nOrganisation\nThe Diocese of the United Kingdom is governed by the Constitution and Statutes of the Original Province of the Anglican Catholic Church, as well as its own diocesan canons.\nThe Bishop Ordinary is assisted by diocesan officers, elected at annual synods, as well as a Council of Advice.\nEcumenical dialogue\nAs a part of the ACC dialogue with the Polish National Catholic Church, a part of the worldwide Union of Scranton, meetings between the Nordic Catholic Church (an Old Catholic denomination of High Church Lutheran patrimony) and the ACC Diocese of the United Kingdom were held in March and September of 2019 and again in February 2020.\nIn 2024, Bishop Damien Mead was presented with the Sant’ Óscar Romero medal for ecumenism by the “Sant' Óscar Romero” Center in Capo d'Orlando.\nLocations\nThe Diocese currently has four churches and missions located throughout England and Wales.\nThe Pro-Cathedral of Saint Augustine of Canterbury had previously been located in Canterbury, but moved to its present location in the former Whitehill Methodist Chapel in Painters Forstal, Faversham, Kent in 2017.\nPublications\nThe Diocesan magazine, ACC-UK, is published twice a year. Books on religious topics and service books are also distributed through the diocese.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.anglicancatholic.org.uk/ Official website]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/ACCDUK Facebook page]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/@BishopMead Youtube channel]"
