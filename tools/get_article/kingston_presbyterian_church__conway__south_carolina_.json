Also on the property is a Colonial Revival style brick educational building built in 1956.  It is co-located with the Kingston Presbyterian Church Cemetery, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.\nGallery\nFile:Kingston Presbyterian Church Marker Conway SC Jun 10.JPG\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.kingstonpc.org/ Kingston Presbyterian Church Conway, SC website]\n*"
