He was the uncle of James III of Scotland who granted him the Earldom of Buchan in 1469. Buchan repaid his nephew by fighting for his cause against rebellious southern barons. Through his marriage to Margaret Ogilvy he acquired the title Lord Auchterhouse.\nLife\nJames Stewart was the second son of Sir James Stewart, the Black Knight of Lorne, and Joan Beaufort, the widow of James I of Scotland. Known as \"Hearty James\", he was a younger brother of John Stewart, 1st Earl of Atholl, and a younger half-brother of James II of Scotland and Princess Margaret Stewart, first wife of Louis XI of France.\nIn 1467, his nephew James III granted him and his wife the lands of the Baronies of Strathalva and Down, with the Castle of Banff and the fishings of the water of River Deveron. In 1469, James III conferred on James the Earldom of Buchan (first of the third creation). In 1471 James was appointed Lord High Chamberlain of Scotland and in 1473 he travelled to France as an ambassador. When he returned from France he was made Warden of the East Marches.\nJames III conferred the estate of Traquair to William Rogers, an eminent musician, and one of his favourites. After holding the lands for upwards of nine years, Rogers sold them for an insignificant sum, in 1478, to Buchan.\nWhen the southern barons entered into a conspiracy against the King, the Earl of Buchan remained loyal. The King crossed the River Forth, and passed into the northeastern counties, where a strong force rallied around him. He then marched south, and came in sight of the rebellious barons at Blackness in West Lothian, where the Earl of Buchan attacked and drove back the left wing of the insurgent army.\nNegotiations were opened, and the Earl of Buchan insisted on severe measures against the insurgent nobles; but George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly and William Hay, 3rd Earl of Erroll were opposed to this, and they retired to the north. It was evident, however, that Buchan's view was right. A pacification was arranged in May 1488, in which the barons promised to return to their allegiance and maintain the rights of the Crown and the peace of the kingdom; and the King disbanded his army and returned to Edinburgh.\nHowever the rebellion continued and on 11 June 1488 at the Battle of Sauchieburn James III and was defeated and killed. The victorious barons passed the night on the field of battle. On the following morning they proceeded to Linlithgow, issued a proclamation, and immediately seized the Royal treasure and the reins of Government. The Earls of Buchan, Huntly, and Lennox, Lord Forbes and others, who had fought for James III, were summoned to appear before Parliament and answer to a charge of treason.\nParliament met at Edinburgh on 6 October 1488 and considered the position of those who had been summoned for treason. The Earl of Buchan tendered his submission and was pardoned and restored to power. None of the others who were cited appeared, and consequently their possessions were placed at the disposal of Parliament.\nIn 1491 Buchan conferred Traquair, on his natural son James Stewart. Buchan died in 1499, and was succeeded by his son, Alexander, 2nd Earl of Buchan.\nFamily\nBefore 1467 James Stewart married Margaret Ogilvy, the sole heiress of Sir Alexander Ogilvy of Auchterhouse, and by this marriage he gained the heritable sheriffship and barony of Forfar. They were parents to two children:\n*Alexander Stewart, 2nd Earl of Buchan (d. 1505), who married firstly a woman named Isobel, and secondly Margaret, daughter of William Ruthven, first Lord Ruthven.\n*Agnes Stewart of Buchan, a mistress of James IV of Scotland, and mother of Lady Janet Stewart, who was in turn a mistress of Henry II of France.\nBuchan had several illegitimate children with his mistress Margaret Murray (b. ca. 1446), many of whom were later legitimized by a royal charter issued in 1488–1489.\n*James Stewart, 1st Laird of Traquair (1480–1513), was the founder of the Traquair family. He was gifted the Traquair estate by his father in 1491. He obtained letters of legitimation, and married the heiress of the Rutherfords, with whom he received the estates of Rutherford and Wells in Roxburghshire. He was killed at the Battle of Flodden. He was the ancestor of John Stewart, 1st Earl of Traquair.\n* Lady Agnes Stewart, married first Adam Hepburn, 2nd Earl of Bothwell in August 1511, secondly Alexander Home, 3rd Lord Home, thirdly Robert Maxwell, 5th Lord Maxwell and fourthly Cuthbert Ramsay, of Edinburgh. Adam Hepburn, 2nd Earl of Bothwell was killed at the Battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513, she died in February, 1557.\n* Elene or Ellen Stewart, who was given a grant of the marriage of William Sinclair, son of Oliver Sinclair of Roslin in December 1511.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\nAttribution\n* }}\n* }}"
