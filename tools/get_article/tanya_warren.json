In 1992, Warren became head basketball coach at the Duchesne Academy of the Sacred Heart, a girls' Catholic school in Omaha. Two years later, Warren moved up to the collegiate ranks as an assistant coach at Iowa State.\nFrom 1995 to 2001, Warren was an assistant coach at Northern Iowa under Tony DiCecco. Warren then was an assistant at Missouri from 2001 to 2004 under Cindy Stein and at Creighton from 2004 to 2007 under Jim Flanery.\nIn April 2007, Warren returned to Northern Iowa, this time as head coach. Warren led Northern Iowa to consecutive MVC tournament titles in 2010 and 2011, both of which led to automatic qualification for the NCAA tournament. Northern Iowa later became runner-up in the 2012 WBI and made the WNIT in 2013 and 2016.\nOn March 4, 2017, Warren became the all-time wins leader in Northern Iowa women's basketball history. She reached her 184th career win with a victory over Missouri State.\nOn January 22, 2021, Warren recorded her 250th Northern Iowa career win with a victory over Indiana State.\nOn February 17, 2024, Warren earned her 202nd MVC win. The come-from-behind victory over Murray State moved her into first place in conference wins all-time.\nUSA Basketball\nWarren was selected to be the assistant coach of the USA representative to the World University Games held in Seoul, South Korea July 5–13, 2015. The team won all six games, including the championship game against Canada. The first three quarters the game were quite close with four ties and four lead changes. In the fourth quarter the USA exploded for 34 points to pull out to a large lead, and won the gold-medal with a score of 82–63.\nHead coaching record\nSource:\n* UNI\n* Missouri Valley\n| confrecord =\n}}\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://unipanthers.com/coaches.aspx?rc=520&path=wbball Northern Iowa profile]"
