It's originator was Dariusz Karłowicz. The Institute launched the project in cooperation with two other institutions: Saint Nicholas Foundation and Political Theology. It consists of a range of initiatives: book series \"Let's Paint Catholicism Again\", seminars, conferences, lectures and art exhibitions.\nThe artistic project is planned for 21 years. Each year a Mystery of the Rosary is selected and it is illustrated by a group of invited Polish painters. The process of painting is preceded by workshops, aimed at broadening the knowledge of artists in the field of theology, philosophy, and history of arts. So far, three editions have completed:\n* I Edition: The Divine Mercy image - ten contemporary images were painted according to the instructions of St. Faustyna Kowalska\n* II Edition: Annuciation - since the Second Edition each painter creates two images: a smaller one, intended to serve a private cult, and a bigger, to serve cult in churches\n* III Edition: Visitation\n* IV Edition: Nativity of Jesus\nThe paintings were exibited in Poland (Cracow, Warsaw, Opole, Bielsko-Biała) and Italy (Rome). Most of them had been sold either to private buyers or to the Church.\n/2026, artists who take part in the fifth edition are working on their interpretations of the Presentation of Jesus.\nPublishing activity\nAs part of its activities, the Institute publishes books in English. So far the following have been published:\n* ed. Dariusz Karłowicz, Thinking with St. John Paul II (2020/2021), Rome-Warsaw 2022.\n* Paweł Włodkowic, Writings (1416–1432),The Struggle for the Self-Determination of Central Europe, Rome-Warsaw 2023.\n* Jacek Salij OP, Our Faith, Rome-Warsaw 2023.\n* ed.
