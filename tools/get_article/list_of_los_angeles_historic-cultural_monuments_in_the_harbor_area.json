There are more than 25 Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monuments (LAHCM) in this area, and several additional sites have been designated as California Historical Landmarks (CHL) or listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). They are designated by the City's Cultural Heritage Commission.\nOverview of the Harbor Area's Historic-Cultural Monuments\nwas a gift from the Republic of Korea in 1976.]]\nThe Harbor Area includes some of the city's most historic sites, several of which are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Two ships located in San Pedro have also received higher distinction as National Historic Landmarks.  They are the Ralph Scott, a fireboat used for several decades by the Los Angeles Fire Department, and the Lane Victory, a World War II Victory ship.\nThe first sites in the Harbor area to be designated as HCM monuments were both built during the Civil War on land owned by Phinneas Banning.  They are HCM #21 (the Civil War era Drum Barracks) and HCM #25 (Banning House where Phinneas Banning lived until his death).\nThe harbor has played an important role in the area's military history.  San Pedro is the site of Fort MacArthur, which was established as a military reservation in 1888, and the harbor's historic sites include a Civil War-era barracks (Drum Barracks) and powder magazine (Powder Magazine (Camp Drum)), coastal artillery batteries built during World War I (Battery Osgood-Farley and Battery John Barlow and Saxton), and the flying bridge of a World War II heavy cruiser (the USS Los Angeles).\nMany of the Harbor area's historical sites have been converted to museums that are open to the public, including Banning House, Drum Barracks, the Point Fermin Lighthouse, and the old San Pedro Municipal Ferry Building  which now operates as the city-owned Los Angeles Maritime Museum.  The hillside overlooking the Point Fermin Lighthouse also include impressive artillery bunkers used between World War I and World War II, and the Korean Bell of Friendship, donated by the Republic of Korea for U.S. Bicentennial in 1976.  Though located a short distance outside the city limits, Lloyd Wright's Wayfarers Chapel is located a short distance north of Point Fermin.\nThe Los Angeles Conservancy offers bimonthly walking tours of the historic sites in downtown San Pedro, which includes access to the interiors of the area's historic structures.\nHistoric-Cultural Monuments in the Harbor area\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:98%\"\n!  width=1% | HCM #\n!  width=\"18%\" |Landmark name\n! class=\"unsortable\"  width=\"11%\" |Image\n!  width=\"4%\"  |Date designated\n!  width=\"12%\" |Locality\n!  width=\"12%\" |Neighborhood\n!  width=\"41%\" |Description\n|-\n|  |21\n| Drum Barracks and Officers Quarters\n|\n|\n| 1051-1055 Cary Dr.\n| Wilmington\n| Civil War Museum located in officers quarters built during Civil War\n|-\n|  |25\n| General Phineas Banning Residence\n|\n|\n| 410 E. \"M\" St.\n| Wilmington\n| Greek Revival house built in 1863 by Phineas Banning; purchased by city in 1927 and operated as a museum in Banning Park\n|-\n|  |47\n| Saint John's Episcopal Church\n|\n|\n| 1537 Neptune Ave.\n| Wilmington\n| Built in 1883, the oldest church building in the Harbor area that is still used for regular worship services; moved to its present site in 1943\n|-\n| |53\n| Old St. Peter's Episcopal Church\n|\n|\n| Harbor View Memorial Park W. 24th St. & S.
