It served the town of Cockermouth, Cumbria, England.\nHistory\nThe station opened on 28 April 1847. It closed on 2 January 1865, being replaced by the Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway station when the line was extended eastwards to Penrith using a different alignment.\nAfter closure to passengers the station remained in use as a goods station until 1964. The station area included an engine shed which was opened on 28 April 1847, extended in 1858 and closed in 1876, after which it was converted for use as a goods shed. The shed was demolished in the mid-1990s.\n}}\nSee also\n* Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://www.railscot.co.uk/Cockermouth_and_Workington_Railway/index.php Map of the line with photos] in RAILSCOT\n*[http://maps.nls.uk/view/102340848 The station on an OS map surveyed in 1864] in National Library of Scotland\n*[http://maps.nls.uk/view/101092018 The station as a goods station on an OS map surveyed in 1898] in National Library of Scotland\n*[http://maps.nls.uk/view/101091997 The station as a goods station on an OS map surveyed in 1947] in National Library of Scotland\n*[http://www.RailMapOnline.com/UKIEMap.php?lat=54.66432&lng=-3.37617 The station] in Rail Map Online\n*[http://www.cumbria-railways.co.uk/ The railways of Cumbria] in Cumbrian Railways Association\n*[http://cumbrianrailways.zenfolio.com/ Photos of Cumbrian railways] in Cumbrian Railways Association\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160322115319/http://cumbrianrailways.org.uk/Railways_of_Cumbria.php The railways of Cumbria] in Railways_of_Cumbria\n*[http://www.cumbria-industries.org.uk/a-z-of-industries/railways/ Cumbrian Industrial History] in Cumbria Industrial History Society\n*[http://www.cockermouth.org.uk/history/ckpr.htm Local history of the CKPR route] in Cockermouth\n*[http://www.railwaycodes.org.uk/ELRs/_mileages/C/CWN.txt The line's and station's Engineer's Line References] in Railway Codes\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160322115319/http://cumbrianrailways.org.uk/Railways_of_Cumbria.php#/cumbrias-lost-lines/4545854062 A video tour-de-force of the region's closed lines] in Cumbria Film Archive"
