Rafael Trujillo, who had previously served as president from 1930 to 1938, was the sole presidential candidate and was returned to office unopposed. He had remained the country's de facto leader even after leaving office for the first time. His Dominican Party won every seat in the Congressional elections.\nThey were the first elections in Dominican history in which women could vote, and three women were elected; Isabel Mayer to the Senate and Milady Félix de L'Official and Josefa Sánchez de González to the Chamber of Deputies.\nResults\nReferences"
