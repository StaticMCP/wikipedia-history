He was educated at Magdalene College, Cambridge. He succeeded Henry Howard, 6th Earl of Suffolk in 1718.\nIn 1715, Howard married Arabella, the daughter and one of the heirs of Elizabeth Morse and Samuel Astry. The Morse family owned the \"Great House\" in Henbury in Bristol and Howard lived there with his wife.\nEnslaved man Scipio Africanus worked for Howard in the Great House and at some point appears to have been made a freed servant. He was buried with an unusually elaborate gravestone. Just over one year after Africanus' death, Howard died in February 1722, and then Arabella died four months later.\nReferences\n* Charles Mosley (ed.), Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th Edition, Wilmington, Delaware, 2003, vol III, pp.&nbsp;3814–3817,\n|-"
