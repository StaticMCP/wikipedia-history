The primary was won by incumbent President Jimmy Carter by a relatively narrow margin for an incumbent president. Carter received 49% of the vote and 10 delegates, while his main challenger, Senator Ted Kennedy, received 39% of the vote and 9 delegates. California governor Jerry Brown received just under 10% of the vote, but did not earn a single delegate.\nThis is the last New Hampshire primary in which an incumbent President running for re-election lost at least one of the Granite State's 10 counties.\nReferences"
