Consequence gave the album a positive review and stated: \"Overall, World War X is an absolute rush. The band's ability to blend feeling and raw heaviness once again allows them to release a work of awesome brutality. With World War X, Carnifex continue to prove themselves as one of deathcore's leading acts.\" Sophie Maughan of Distorted Sound scored the album 8 out of 10 and said: \"Whether World War X will become known as Carnifex's magnum opus remains to be seen. What they have created with album number seven however, is a record that's undeterred or defined by genre limitations. This is deathcore diversified – and it's an audio-sensory sojourn worth embracing.\"\nMetalSucks rated the album 3.5 out of 5 and said: \"Although I can't imagine this will be the defining album of Carnifex's career, it's an accessible one, and longtime Carnifex fans should find something to enjoy.\" Simon Crampton of Rock Sins rated the album 8 out of 10 and said: \"World War X clocks in at just over 35 minutes and flys [sic] by far too quickly. A lean muscular album that packs a hefty punch. Showcasing Carnifex in all of their glory, this a disgustingly heavy record made by a band that has matured and grown from strength with each record who are now starting to reach their full potential. It might be too early to tell if this will go down as Carnifex's defining album, but the evidence is certainly there. The future the band speaks of may be bleak but their real-world counterpart is anything but.\"\nTrack listing\nAdapted from Apple Music.\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from AllMusic.\nCarnifex\n* Scott Lewis – lead vocals\n* Jordan Lockrey – lead guitar, engineering\n* Cory Arford – rhythm guitar, backing vocals\n* Fred Calderon – bass\n* Shawn Cameron – drums, engineering\nAdditional musicians\n* Mick Kenney – additional vocals, programming\n* Alissa White-Gluz – guest vocals on track 5\n* Angel Vivaldi – guest guitar solo on track 6\n* Cassie Morris – piano\nAdditional personnel\n* Jason Suecof – production, engineering, guitar solo\n* Carnifex – production\n* Ronn Miller – assistant engineering\n* John Douglass – mixing\n* Ted Jensen – mastering\n* Blake Armstrong – cover art\n* Marcelo Vasco – layout\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
