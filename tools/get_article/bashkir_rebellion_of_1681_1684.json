The first actions began in the summer of 1681 in Nogai and Siberian darugah. In the spring of 1682, a mass struggle unfolded: the rebel Kazan Daruga attacked the Zakamsky fortresses. The main blow in Osinskaya daruga was directed to Kungur, fortresses and villages founded by Stroganovs on Bashkir lands.\nNumerous rebel detachment besieged Ufa, took Krasny Yar, Lovashnoye and others, in the west — Piyaniy bor, Karakulino and other objects. By May, the uprising had engulfed the entire region. Unsuccessful attempts to suppress the uprising forced the government to appeal to the Bashkirs with a promise to cancel the decree and forgive all participants in the uprising. Some of the rebels, led by Kuchuk Yulaev, stopped fighting and appealed to the government with a petition, while the other part, led by Seit, continued the struggle.\nThe rebels established a connection with the Kalmyk taisha Ayuka. In July 1682, Kalmyk detachments arrived in Bashkortostan. The uprising resumed. Bashkirs and Kalmyks besieged Ufa and Menzelinsk, prisons, settlements and villages built on Bashkir lands were attacked. To break the alliance of the Bashkirs with the Kalmyks, the government began negotiations with Ayuka and in early 1683 achieved his refusal to support the uprising. But the struggle continued: in the spring and summer of 1683, the rebels attacked the Zakamsky fortresses, burned the Ascension Monastery, besieged the Salt Town, Menzelinsk and other settlements. Troops under the command of Yu. S. were assembled to suppress the uprising. Urusova. Kalmyk taisha Ayuka with a detachment of 40 thousand people invaded the borders of Bashkortostan to force the Bashkirs to secede from Russia and come under his rule by cruel measures. The cruelty of the Kalmyks forced the Bashkir rebels to stop fighting against the Russian Kingdom. This was also facilitated by the statement of the tsarist government that it had never issued a decree on the forced baptism of Muslims.\nReferences\nLiterature\nАкманов И. Г.
