He painted and made prints, and was influenced by German Expressionism as well as Surrealism.\nBiography\nHagedorn was born on January 26, 1902, in Oakland, California, the son of Henry and Edna (née Kafka) Hagedorn. His mother died in childbirth, and he was raised  by his maternal grandmother and by his aunt, Grace Kafka. At the age of 16, he enrolled in the San Francisco Art Association, and from 1923 to 1926 attended the California School of Fine Arts. Around 1930 he may have moved to New York for a brief period. He participated in numerous exhibitions from the late 1920s through the 1930s, and won honors from the Pennsylvania Academy and the Brooklyn Museum. Despite these successes, he did not take advantage of offers from museum curators and art dealers that may have increased his fame. After receiving a substantial inheritance in the late 1930s, he stopped exhibiting his work publicly. In the catalog to a 1996 exhibition at the University of California, Berkeley, museum curator James Steward wrote: \"The spirit went out of much of his work from about 1940, and although Hagedorn continued to make art throughout most of his life, it often devolved into trivializing depictions of the female nude.\"\nHe died on December 14, 1982, in Berkeley, California.\nIllustration\nHagedorn illustrated The Fourteen Poems of O.V.

Martha Schwendener, an art critic for The New York Times, described the work, saying it took \"Goya’s image of one goblin, representing a corrupt person, cutting another’s toenails, and redrew it to resonate with the Wall Street crash of 1929.\"\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*  Images of paintings and prints\n*  Images of four prints"
