It is found in China and possibly India. Its natural habitat is boreal forest. It generally has a red hint to it and a bit of blue on, or near, its wings. The tail is of an emerald green colour.\nThis species is considered monotypic, although it was previously divided into two subspecies: the type subspecies and the subspecies meissneri, which was lumped with elegans in 2022.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Crested Tit-Warbler\n\n#REDIRECT Crested tit-warbler\n\n---\n\n## Crested Tit-warbler\n\n#REDIRECT Crested tit-warbler\n}}"
