The book tells the story of Steve Tene and his Romani family.\nPlot\nThe film deals with the criminal ways and turbulent lives of a group of modern-day Romanis living in the early 1960s of New York City. While on his deathbed their \"king\", Zharko Stepanowicz, passes his position of leadership on to his unwilling grandson, Dave. In spite of Dave's reluctance to become the Gypsies' new leader, Dave's father, Groffo, resentful over not having been appointed leader, attempts to have Dave killed. Groffo is scheming and temperamental, and uses violence and threats to get the clan to do his bidding. Eventually this leads to a major confrontation with his son, and the film ends with the suggestion that Dave has finally accepted his legacy; with his voiceover considering the possibility of his bringing the rest of the tradition-bound Gypsies into the world of 20th Century customs and lifestyles.\nCast\n* Eric Roberts as Dave Stepanowicz\n* Sterling Hayden as King Zharko Stepanowicz\n* Judd Hirsch as Groffo Stepanowicz\n* Shelley Winters as Queen Rachel Stepanowicz\n* Susan Sarandon as Rose Giorgio Stepanowicz\n* Brooke Shields as Tita Stepanowicz\n**Danielle Brisebois as Young Tita Stepanowicz\n* Annette O'Toole as Sharon\n* Annie Potts as Persa\n* Michael V.
