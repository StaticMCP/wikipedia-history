In 1998 a re-recorded version appeared on The X-Files: The Album, the soundtrack to the original X-Files movie, and was released as a single.\nSong information\nWhile none of the X-Files album songs are prominently featured in the movie itself, \"Walking After You\" is played during the end credit sequence, following Noel Gallagher's \"Teotihuacan.\" The single's B-side is Ween's \"Beacon Light\". Foo Fighters had previously contributed a cover of Gary Numan's \"Down in the Park\" to the compilation album, Songs in the Key of X: Music From and Inspired by the X-Files.\n\"Walking After You\" was a hit in the UK and was performed live on the chart show Top of the Pops. The song, along with the rest of The Colour and the Shape album was released as downloadable content for the Rock Band series of video games on November 13, 2008.\nVersion differences\nThe original album version was created in December 1996 at WGNS Studios in Washington, D.C., in between recording sessions for The Colour and the Shape. It was performed by Grohl on vocals (in one take) and all instrument parts (except bass, which was performed by the band's bassist Nate Mendel), and was recorded by Geoff Turner.\nThe soundtrack/single version was performed by the full band, including then-recent additions Taylor Hawkins and Franz Stahl, with guest backing vocals from Shudder to Think's Craig Wedren. It was recorded in early 1998 at Ocean Way Studios in Hollywood, and was produced by Talking Heads member Jerry Harrison. As a result of trying to muster as much emotion as possible, Grohl broke down during the recording of the vocal take which ended up being used in the final mix. This version also utilizes the addition of a piano part during the bridge, performed by Harrison. Stylistically, it employs more intricate drumming and guitar work than the original—which is much more sparse—and runs about a minute shorter.\nMusic video\nThe song's music video features a nattily-attired Grohl interacting with a woman (played by Spanish actress Arly Jover) in what appears to be an asylum or prison, where the two are separated by plate-glass windows. A stack of vintage television sets displays clips of retro fare such as Bela Lugosi films and Betty Boop cartoons.\nIt was directed by fashion photographer Matthew Rolston, who had also done videos for artists such as Janet Jackson, Madonna, and Lenny Kravitz. It was also the first Foo Fighters music video done in 16:9 Widescreen.\nBefore Rolston's involvement in the video, The X-Files star David Duchovny had expressed an interest in directing it, but was quick to admit his inexperience, saying \"I wouldn't know what the hell I'm doing.\" The concept was also initially considered to have more of a direct relation to The X-Files in some way, which the finished video does not bear.\nTrack listing\n#\"Walking After You\" (1998 version)\n#\"Beacon Light\" (performed by Ween)\nThe previously unreleased Ween song \"Beacon Light\" was used as a B-side as it also appears on the film soundtrack to X-Files: Fight the Future.\nRecording\nThe Colour and the Shape\n*Dave Grohl – vocals, guitar, drums\n*Nate Mendel – bass\nThe X-Files: The Album\n*Dave Grohl – vocals, guitar\n*Nate Mendel – bass\n*Franz Stahl – guitar\n*Taylor Hawkins – drums\n*Craig Wedren – backing vocals\n*Jerry Harrison – piano\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1998)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|Australia (ARIA)\n|align=\"center\"|67\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1998)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n| US Modern Rock (Billboard'')\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|62\n|}\nReferences"
