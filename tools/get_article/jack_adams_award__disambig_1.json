The winner is selected by a poll of the National Hockey League Broadcasters Association at the end of the regular season. Five coaches have won the award twice, while Pat Burns has won three times, the most of any coach. The award is named in honor of Jack Adams, Hall of Fame player for the Toronto Arenas/St. Patricks, Vancouver Millionaires and original Ottawa Senators, and long-time Coach and General Manager of the Detroit Red Wings. It was first awarded at the conclusion of the  regular season.\nJacques Demers is the only coach to win the award in consecutive seasons. Five coaches have won the award with two teams: Jacques Lemaire, Pat Quinn, Scotty Bowman, Barry Trotz, and John Tortorella have won the award twice. Pat Burns is the only coach to win the Adams Award three times, as well as the only coach to win it with three different teams. The franchises with the most Jack Adams Award winners are the Washington Capitals, Philadelphia Flyers, Detroit Red Wings, Boston Bruins and Phoenix Coyotes with four winners each, although the Coyotes had two winners in Winnipeg before they moved to Arizona. Bill Barber, Bruce Boudreau and Ken Hitchcock are the only coaches to win the award after replacing the head coach who started the season. Barber took over for Craig Ramsay during the Flyers' 2000–01 season, Boudreau replaced Glen Hanlon a month into the Capitals' 2007–08 season while Hitchcock replaced Davis Payne a month into the Blues' 2011–12 season. The closest vote occurred in , when the winner Lindy Ruff edged out Peter Laviolette by a single point.\n__TOC__\nWinners\n;Key\n, winner for the 1976–77 and 1995–96 NHL seasons.]]\n, winner for the 1979–80 and 1991–92 NHL seasons.]]\n, winner for the 1993–94 and 2002–03 NHL seasons.]]\n, winner for the 2003–04 and 2016–17 NHL seasons.]]\n, winner for the 2015–16 and 2018–19 NHL seasons.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Jack Adams Award winners\n!scope=\"col\"| Season\n!scope=\"col\"| Winner\n!scope=\"col\"| Team\n!scope=\"col\"| Win #\n|-\n|\n|\n| Philadelphia Flyers\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Los Angeles Kings\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Boston Bruins\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Montreal Canadiens\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Detroit Red Wings\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| New York Islanders\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Philadelphia Flyers\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| St. Louis Blues\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Winnipeg Jets\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Chicago Black Hawks\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Washington Capitals\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Philadelphia Flyers\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Edmonton Oilers\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Detroit Red Wings\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Detroit Red Wings\n| 2\n|-\n|\n|\n| Montreal Canadiens\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Winnipeg Jets\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| St. Louis Blues\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Vancouver Canucks\n| 2\n|-\n|\n|\n| Toronto Maple Leafs\n| 2\n|-\n|\n|\n| New Jersey Devils\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Quebec Nordiques\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Detroit Red Wings\n| 2\n|-\n|\n|\n| Buffalo Sabres\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Boston Bruins\n| 3\n|-\n|\n|\n| Ottawa Senators\n| 1\n|-bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\"\n|\n|\n| St. Louis Blues\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Philadelphia Flyers\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Phoenix Coyotes\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Minnesota Wild\n| 2\n|-\n|\n|\n| Tampa Bay Lightning\n| 1\n|-\n|\n| colspan=3 align=\"center\" |Season cancelled due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout\n|-bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\"\n|\n|\n| Buffalo Sabres\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Vancouver Canucks\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Washington Capitals\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Boston Bruins\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Phoenix Coyotes\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Pittsburgh Penguins\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| St. Louis Blues\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Ottawa Senators\n| 1\n|-bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\"\n|\n|\n| Colorado Avalanche\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Calgary Flames\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Washington Capitals\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Columbus Blue Jackets\n| 2\n|-\n|\n|\n| Vegas Golden Knights\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| New York Islanders\n| 2\n|-bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\"\n|\n|\n| Boston Bruins\n| 1\n|-bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\"\n|\n|\n| Carolina Hurricanes\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|\n| Calgary Flames\n| 1\n|-bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\"\n|\n|\n| Boston Bruins\n| 1\n|-bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\"\n|\n|\n| Vancouver Canucks\n| 1\n|-bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\"\n|\n|\n| Washington Capitals\n| 1\n|}\nSee also\n* List of National Hockey League awards\n* List of NHL head coaches\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
