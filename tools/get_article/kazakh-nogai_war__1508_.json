The new expedition against the mirzas of the Nogai Horde was undertaken by the Kazakh rulers only in 1508. In August of that year, the Nogai ruler Alshagyr-Mirza wrote to Moscow: «On the other hand, the Cossacks are hostile to us: they told us that the army was coming to us, and we roamed against them and, God willing, we will return in good time, in my camp Volga» It can be assumed that the Kazakh khans decided to take advantage of the death of Mirza Hasan, son of Vakkas, which occurred around that time. As a result, the Kazakhs occupied the Yaik River and took Saraichik.\nHasan replaced Yamgurchi as the ruler of the Nogai Horde around 1504. As V.V. Trepavlov suggests, the Kazakhs were marching in large numbers, \"after all, the eastern Nogai outposts did not dare to repel the raid overnight and called (\"told us\") reinforcements from the Volga.\" There is no mention in the archival materials whether there was a battle between the Nogais and the Kazakhs. It is only known that Alshagyr-Mirza returned to his camp in the spring of 1509 and fought against Sheikh-Muhammad. Perhaps these events were reflected in the well-known epic \"Koblandy Batyr,\" where it is said that during one of his campaigns, Alshagyr, capturing the people of Koblandy Batyr, destroyed the city of Karaspan. According to S. Zholdasbayuly, this city was located on the left bank of the Syr Darya River, near the wintering place of Obryuchevka (South Kazakhstan Region).\nEffects\nAfter the deaths of Musa and Yamgurchi (from 1507, their third cousin - the son of Temir Asan is referred to as \"prince\" in diplomatic documents), the Crimean Khanate attempted to subjugate the Nogai Horde to its political influence. Upon learning that Agish, the son of Yamgurchi, Shidyak, the son of Musa, Ahmed-aga Mirza, and \"forty mirzas\" had formed an alliance with the Astrakhan Khan Abdul-Kerim, the Crimean Khan in the spring of 1509 mobilized a vast army against them led by Muhammad-Girey-Sultan. \"And the Nogais, half of them camped beyond the Volga, and the other half on this side.\" According to reports from the Khan and the Crimeans received in Moscow in September, the Nogais suffered a severe defeat: \"... the mirzas were defeated, their encampments and herds, horses and camels, sheep and livestock, taking everything and bringing it as booty\", \"and for twenty days they could not bring them as captives in Perekop.\" In the following years, the Crimean campaigns were repeated, and many Nogai uluses were forced to acknowledge their dependence on Crimea.\nNotes"
