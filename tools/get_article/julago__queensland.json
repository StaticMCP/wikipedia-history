It will be the site of a large masterplanned real estate development in the years ahead. In the , Julago had a population of 384 people.\nGeography\nThe northern part of the locality is mountainous and mostly undeveloped bushland. The highest peak is Mount Muntalunga  () which rises  above sea level and is part of the Muntalunga Range. There is also an unnamed peak () rising to . Between these two mountains is a valley (40 meters above sea level).\nThe Bruce Highway enters the locality from the east (Alligator Creek / Nome), passes through the valley, exiting the locality to the north-west (Stuart). The North Coast railway line enters the locality from the north-east (Nome), passes through the valley to the north of the highway, and exits to the north-west (Stuart).\nMost of the housing in the locality is in this valley, easily accessed from the highway. The south part of the locality is used for grazing by the Rocky Springs station.\nHistory\nThe locality was named and bounded on 27 July 1991. The name comes from the Julago railway station, assigned by the Queensland Railways Department from 7 May 1942 (as part of a World War II emergency crossing loop). The name is reportedly an Aboriginal word, meaning plains turkey.\nIn November 2016, the Deputy Premier of Queensland, Jackie Trad, announced that Townsville's largest master-planned community would be built on the Rocky Springs Land in a new development called Elliot Springs. When completed in 2050 (estimated), the  estate will have over 10,600 homes and over 26,000 residents. Trad committed the Queensland Government to spend $15M on water and road infrastructure  as part of co-investment with property developer Lendlease. The name Elliot Springs reflects that Mount Elliot will be the backdrop to the new development, which will also have views of Mount Jack, Mount Stuart and the Muntalunga Ranges.\nLendLease expect the first display village with homes constructed by 13 building companies will open in January 2019.\nDemographics\nIn the , Julago had a population of 113 people.\nIn the , Julago had a population of 384 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Julago. The nearest government primary school is Wulguru State School in Wulguru to the north-west. The nearest government secondary school is William Ross State High School in Annandale to the north-west.\nAmenities\nElliot Spring Wesleyan Methodist Church meets at the Elliot Springs Community Centre on Elliot Springs Boulevard (approx ). It is part of the Wesleyan Methodist Church.\nReferences"
