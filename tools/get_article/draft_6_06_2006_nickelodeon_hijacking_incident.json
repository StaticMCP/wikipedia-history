      "text": "# Draft:6/06/2006 Nickelodeon Hijacking Incident\n\n6/06/2006 | Nickelodeon Hijacking Incident is an analog-style horror video made by user AZERTY, under his [https://www.youtube.com/@azertyslostvhsrecording6782 Lost VHS Recordings channel] on March 27, 2023. The screamer was removed due to the creator deleting his channel due to backlash against him until aphextwinfan926 reuploaded the video on May 23, 2024.\nThe video starts with the SpongeBob Squarepants episode \"Something Smells\". However, right after SpongeBob says \"Oh no\", the video immediately freezes and cuts to a black screen, transitioning into a distorted version of him with his mouth blacked out on a fiery background. Following this interruption, the video then shifts to a seemingly unrelated image of a serene river, followed by a commercial for TeenNick, hosted by Nick Cannon. The left side of the screen features various sinister (and poorly spelled) messages seemingly implying the late Stephen Hillenburg murdered his wife Karen Umland (when in fact she actually outlived him and is still alive).\nHowever, right after Nick Cannon says \"Teen Nick\", the screen flashes rapidly with a giant text \"WHY\", along with the same scream from Anne.jpg. After the screamer, the video cuts to SpongeBob against a foreboding red backdrop along with a text mocking Hillenburg (“SEE YOU IN HELL STEPHEN HILLENBURG”) followed by the Nickelodeon logo, and the video ends with the Nickelodeon Technical Difficulties (Stick With Nick) screen (used in AZERTY's other videos).\nThe video’s supposed date, 6/06/2006, references the popular belief that 666 is the number of the Devil (and by extension the number of evil in general).\nReferences"
