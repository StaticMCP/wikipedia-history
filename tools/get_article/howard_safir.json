He created model blocks in each borough to prevent eradicated drug dealing from returning and he introduced closed-circuit television to ensure the safety of housing development residents, park visitors, and subway riders. Concerned for officer and public safety, Safir expanded firearms training and introduced Firearms Training Simulators. Under his leadership, firearms discharge incidents decreased from 344 in 1995 to 155 in 1999. He developed and implemented Operation Condor, a creative use of personnel resources, that continues to be a centerpiece of current NYPD crime reduction strategy. Safir served four years as Police Commissioner until he announced his resignation and retirement from government service in 2000.\nIn 1997, Safir appeared on the ABC TV series NYPD Blue, playing himself.\nAfter Safir resigned as Police Commissioner in 2000, he immediately went to work as a consultant to the chief executive of ChoicePoint, Inc. and ultimately ran their Bode Technology Group subsidiary, which they purchased at Safir's urging in April 2001.
