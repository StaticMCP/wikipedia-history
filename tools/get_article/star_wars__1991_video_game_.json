Power Unlimited gave the Game Boy version a score of 65% summarizing: \"Although this Star Wars game is incredibly versatile, it is hardly manageable. The graphics are too complicated for the Game Boy, the image is too dark and the controls are not precise enough. However, it can be played for a very long time.\"\nThe Game Gear version was a runner-up for GamePros 1993 Hand-Held Game of the Year award.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://archive.org/details/gg_Star_Wars_1993LucasArts_Tiertex_Design_Studio_U.S._GoldEUen Star Wars (Game Gear) at the Internet Archive]"
