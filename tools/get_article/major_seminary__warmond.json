The building, which is partly a registered monument (Rijksmonument 38285), was then for some years used as a retirement home for the clergy and members of religious orders. Since 2017 it has been redeveloped into residential units, some as service flats.\nNotable students and staff\n* Cardinal Simonis (student)\n* Franciscus Jacobus van Vree, bishop of Haarlem (president, 1842–1853)\n* Cardinal Willebrands (student)\nReferences"
