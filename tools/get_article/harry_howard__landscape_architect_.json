A devotee of the modernist style of architecture, Howard counted Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier among his influences, and later became friends with Sydney architect of the modernist style, Harry Seidler.\nExternal links\n* [http://www.aila.org.au/information/profiles/harry-howard/harryhoward.html Australian Institute of Landscape Architects biography]\n* [http://www.aila.org.au/projects/detail.asp?textSearch=&ArchSearch=&Location=&Date=&Submit=Search&offset=10&ID=45 Lane Cove Streetscapes]\n* [http://www.deh.gov.au/cgi-bin/ahdb/search.pl?mode=place_detail;place_id=105745 The High Court of Australia at the Australian Heritage Database]"
