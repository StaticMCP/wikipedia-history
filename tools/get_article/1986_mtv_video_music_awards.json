The show was hosted by MTV VJs Downtown Julie Brown, Mark Goodman, Alan Hunter, Martha Quinn, and Dweezil Zappa, and it emanated primarily from both the Palladium in New York City and the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles. Other parts of the show, however, took place in various locations such as London, Miami, and New Haven, Connecticut.\nThe night's biggest winner and one of the year's two most nominated artists was Norwegian group a-ha, which won eight out of eleven awards it was in contention for.  Their video for \"Take On Me\" earned six awards out of eight nominations, including Viewer's Choice, while \"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.\" won two awards out of three nominations.\nThe other most nominated artist was rock group Dire Straits, whose video for \"Money for Nothing\" also earned eleven nominations and won two awards, including Video of the Year.  Thus, \"Money for Nothing\" was also the most nominated video at the 1986 VMAs.\nBackground\nMTV announced in June that the 1986 Video Music Awards would be held at New York's Palladium and Los Angeles's Universal Amphitheatre on September 5. Nominees were announced on August 4. The decision to broadcast the ceremony from multiple venues came out of a desire to make the ceremony more casual, as did the decisions to forego a traditional host, present awards throughout the venues instead of at a podium, and loosen time limitations. Winners were selected by a group of over 1,700 individuals from the recording industry. The ceremony was preceded by a two-hour MTV VMA 1986 Pre-Game Show special. Hosted by Bob Costas and Huey Lewis, the pre-taped special highlighted the nominees.\nPerformances\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ List of musical performances\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Artist(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Song(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |\n|-\n| Robert Palmer\n| \"Addicted to Love\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| The Hooters\n| \"And We Danced\"\"Nervous Night\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| The Monkees\n| \"I'm a Believer\"\"Daydream Believer\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| 'Til Tuesday\n| \"What About Love\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| INXS\n| \"What You Need\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| Van Halen\n| \"Best of Both Worlds\"\"Love Walks In\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| Mr. Mister\n| \"Kyrie\"\"Broken Wings\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| Simply Red\n| \"Holding Back the Years\"\"Money's Too Tight (To Mention)\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| Whitney Houston\n| \"How Will I Know\"\"Greatest Love of All\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| Pet Shop Boys\n| \"Love Comes Quickly\"\"West End Girls\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| Tina Turner\n| \"Typical Male\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| Genesis\n| \"Throwing It All Away\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|}\nRobert Palmer, The Monkees, INXS, Mr. Mister, Whitney Houston, and Pet Shop Boys performed from Los Angeles.
