He later joined The Fourth Estate, a project of the Media Foundation for West Africa (MFWA). Currently, Adeti has formed his own media firm named Media Without Borders. Prior to these roles, he also gained working experience with the Daily Dispatch newspaper.\nProsecution\nEdward Adeti faced threats from Shaanxi Mining company after he exposed an alleged bribery attempt by the company's Managing Director, Charles Taleog Ndanbon. Adeti reported that Ndanbon had offered him a bribe of GH₵5,000 and a motorbike, presumably to drop a story he has worked on concerning the company and a high court judge, Jacob Boon, in 2018. The exposé later led to Rockson Bukari resigning from the government of President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo on April 29, 2019. The story on the bribery scandal also resulted in the disqualification of the high court judge from a case involving Shaanxi and Cassius, an Australian mining company. It was widely reported that the judge was also demoted as a result of the investigative story.\nDefamation Suit\nEdward Adeti faced a defamation lawsuit from BONABOTO, an organization based in Bolgatanga, the Upper East Regional capital. The suit stemmed from Adeti's publication titled \"BONABOTO's Chair Assaults Starr Reporter.\" In their legal action, BONABOTO sought an apology, a retraction of the story, and GH₵20,000 in damages from the journalist. However, in an unexpected turn of events, the Bolgatanga Circuit Court ruled in favor of Adeti. The presiding judge awarded the journalist GH₵4,000 in damages against the plaintiff, BONABOTO.\nBONABOTO also lodged a complaint with Ghana's National Media Commission (NMC) in 2020, claiming Adeti wrote a false story that the organization's former chairman, Francis Atintono, was arrested by police for narcotics activities.

His work revealed how this criminal network disrupted the hospital's medication supply, potentially costing lives. The investigation detailed the syndicate's operations within the hospital's supply chain, highlighting the severe consequences of corruption in healthcare.\nCash for justice\nEdward Adeti uncovered findings that corroborate public allegations of corruption within the Attorney-General's Department. This government body is primarily responsible for representing the state in legal proceedings, prosecuting individuals charged with crimes, and providing legal counsel to government departments. However, widespread complaints from the general public suggest that certain criminal elements within the Attorney-General's Department are obstructing justice by accepting bribes to help crime suspects evade punishment. Adeti's investigation sheds light on these concerning practices, adding weight to the existing accusations of misconduct within this crucial legal institution.\nClinician dumps baby in morgue 'alive'\nInvestigative journalist Edward Adeti uncovered a disturbing case of medical negligence where a clinician mistakenly declared a baby dead and placed the still-living infant in a morgue.

The assailants tied Ayamga to an improvised gallows and severely beat him, intending to kill him to prevent him from reporting the torture. Although Ayamga survived, he was left with a paralyzed hand, impacting his livelihood. In an attempt to cover up their crime, the attackers consulted shrines in Ghana and Burkina Faso, both of which declared Ayamga innocent. Law enforcement arrested thirteen individuals, including a local assembly member, but some suspects remain at large. The incident has sparked calls for justice and highlighted the dangers of mob violence in remote communities.\nBlood gold\nThrough this reports he highlighted the abuses that are reportedly being perpetrated by some Asian mining companies against the indigenous people of Talensi.
