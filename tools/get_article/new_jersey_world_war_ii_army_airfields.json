However the other USAAF support commands (Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); Air Transport Command (ATC) or Troop Carrier Command) commanded a significant number of airfields in a support roles.\nIt is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor Airfields\nAir Transport Command\n* Fort Dix Army Airbase, Fort Dix\n: 95th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Provided support for Fort Dix\n: Now:  McGuire Air Force Base (1948-present)\nFirst Air Force\n* Millville Army Airfield, Millville\n: 441st Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Now: Millville Municipal Airport\nAir Technical Service Command\n* Newark Army Airfield, Newark\n: 438th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Joint use USAAF/US NAVY/Civil Airport, Also provided POE(Port Of Entry) for New York Area.\n: Now:  Newark Liberty International Airport\n* Linden Airport, Linden\n: Aircraft manufactured by General Motors were built at the defense plant adjacent to the airfield and flown out from here.\n: Now: Linden Airport\n:\nReferences\n* Maurer, Maurer (1983).
