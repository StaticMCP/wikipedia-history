His position of choice was wing three-quarter.\nBorn in Wellington in 1900, Ward was educated at Wellington College where he was a member of the 1st XV between 1917 and 1918. He died in Palmerston North in 1990, and was buried at Kelvin Grove Cemetery.\nCareer\nAfter graduating from secondary school Ward moved south and attended Otago University. In 1920 Ward was trialled to play at the Half-back position for his Otago Varsity team, but it was decided the position did not suit him. An unknown commentator stated: \"Ward is a brilliant individualist, a straight runner and fast. He should be played as a Wing Three-quarter\". This opinion would come true as Ward was selected on the wing for the All Blacks against the touring New South Wales side in Christchurch in 1921, making his debut at 21 years of age. He scored no points in this appearance.\nUnfortunately for Ward his Rugby career took a turn for the worse because of a serious knee injury suffered in 1922, which ultimately ended his career.\nPersonal\nWard was one of three children of William Frederick Ward and Kate Gardiner McRae.\nHe worked as a medical practitioner in Palmerston North.\nReferences"
