The dance/house song is a self-affirming anthem of self-confidence, particularly in relation to one's appearance. It was released exclusively on a CD single on RuCo, Inc., RuPaul's own label.\nIn June 2023, Trixie Mattel released a cover of the song, with all proceeds donated to the Drag Isn't Dangerous fund.\nLyrics\nThe section during which RuPaul speaks contains numerous references to the documentary film Paris is Burning. Including a direct quote from one of the films main characters, Venus Xtravaganza: \"Touch this skin, darling, touch this skin honey, touch all of this skin! You just can't take it! You're just an overgrown orangutan!\"\nMusic video\nThe single's music video featured drag performer Shirley Q. Liquor getting cosmetic surgery and transforming from an overweight woman eating fried chicken into RuPaul. The video featured male fitness model Rusty Joiner as RuPaul's scantily-clad surgeon.\nThe music video was directed by fashion photographer Mike Ruiz, and produced for Caya Filmworks by Jeff Beasley. The video is also a social criticism of the standards of beauty in our society.\nTrack listings\n# \"Shirley Q.
