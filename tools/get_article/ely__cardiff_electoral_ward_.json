The ward elects three county councillors to the County Council of the City and County of Cardiff. It has previously been represented by the Labour Party, until February 2019 when Plaid Cymru won one of the council seats.\nDescription\nThe ward boundaries are coterminous with the community of Ely, north of Cowbridge Road West. To the south is the Caerau ward, to the north are the Creigiau & St. Fagans and Fairwater wards.\nAccording to the 2011 census the population of the ward was 14,603.\nCounty elections\n2019 by-election\nLabour councillor (since 2012) Jim Murphy died in December 2018 aged 72. A by-election was arranged for 21 February 2019 which was won by Andrea Gibson for Plaid Cymru by 52 votes over the Labour candidate, a swing of 18% in comparison with the May 2017 election. The Labour leader of Cardiff Council described it as \" a bad day, in a week of absolute political chaos nationally\" (referring to the formation of The Independent Group at Westminster).\nIn October 2019 Councillor Gibson resigned the Plaid Cymru party whip in protest at the treatment of colleague Neil McEvoy. She remained as an independent councillor.\nElections 1995 to 2017\nThe ward had elected three Labour county councillors since 1995, when the new unitary authority was created. Cllr Russell Goodway has been an Ely councillor continuously since 1995 and was leader of Cardiff Council until 2004 (prior to 1995 he was a South Glamorgan councillor for the Canton ward).\n}}\n= sitting councillor prior to the election\nCouncillors Goddard, Murphy and Goodway were also the winners of the May 2012 elections.\nAt the 2004 elections, the Ely ward's Labour councillor of 30 years, Charlie Gale, stood as an Independent in an attempt to unseat (the then unpopular) Cllr Goodway. Goodway retained his seat by only 63 votes. Goodway immediately stood down as Council leader, but accused senior Labour figures of conspiring against him.\n1973-1995\nPrior to the formation of the new Cardiff unitary authority, Ely was a ward to Cardiff City Council (a district council of South Glamorgan). Six city councillors were elected at the 1973, 1976 and 1979 elections. This was reduced to three from the 1983 election onwards.\nCllr Bill Buttle was one of the ward's representatives for 23 years, until stepping down in 1991. He was responsible for the Western Leisure Centre being built in Ely. Cllr Charlie Gale was an Ely councillor for 30 years from 1973 before standing as an Independent in 2004.\nReferences"
