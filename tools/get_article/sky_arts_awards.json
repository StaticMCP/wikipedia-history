The awards have been given annually since 1997.\nThey originated with the long-running British arts programme The South Bank Show and Melvyn Bragg, who has served as patron, host and master of ceremonies of the awards until his retirement from the show in late 2023.\nThe last South Bank Show Awards ceremony to be broadcast by ITV was in January 2010 and was held at The Dorchester hotel in London. After the network announced that The South Bank Show would be cancelled at the end of the 2009 season, the awards ceremony continued to be broadcast by Sky Arts and was eventually renamed the South Bank Sky Arts Awards. Sky Arts revived The South Bank Show itself in 2012.\nIn 2024, the ceremony's name was simplified after the final season of The South Bank Show in 2023. Although press releases refer to these as the inaugural Sky Arts Awards, the categories remained unchanged from previous ceremonies, although two new ones were added, namely Poetry and Arts Hero, the latter an award dedicated to celebrating the unsung heroes whose work behind the scenes in the arts sector is invaluable.\nAward categories\n, winner of the South Bank Sky Arts Award for Visual Art, March 2013]]\nIn addition to awards in each of the individual categories, the Sky Arts Awards also include the Outstanding Achievement in the Arts Award recognising lifetime contributions to the arts in Britain, and the Times Breakthrough Award recognising outstanding new British talent. The latter being the only category that is decided by a public vote. Past winners of the Outstanding Achievement in the Arts Award include Julie Walters (2013), Michael Frayn (2012), Dame Judi Dench (2011), JK Rowling (2008), and The Who (2007).\nBetween 2004 and 2010, the Arts Council England deciBel Award (latterly the Arts Council England Diversity Award) found a home at the ceremony. Winners included Roy Williams for Fallout (2004), Neil Biswas for Bradford Riots (2007), Daljit Nagra for Look We Have Coming To Dover! (2008), street artist Mohammed Ali (2009), and Julie McNamara (2010).\nLater between 2013 and 2016, the ceremony was used as the platform to announce the winners of the Sky Academy Arts Scholarships.\nAs of the 28th annual ceremony (broadcast September 2024), there were 14 award categories:\n2024 awards (28th annual ceremony)\nWith The South Bank Show no longer being broadcast, this year saw the ceremony rebranded to simply The Sky Arts Awards. Shortlisted nominees were announced on 25 July 2024. This year's trophy, in the form of a bronze, was designed by Vic Reeves. A new award for Arts Hero was launched in this year to recognise the unsung heroes who work tirelessly behind the scenes to make the arts possible. The shortlist was up drawn from nominees suggested by the arts community. Melvyn Bragg was given a lifetime achievement award in recognition of his sixty years as champion of the arts.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%\"\n|+Presented: 17 September 2024 by Joe Lycett at the Roundhouse, London\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"34%\" |Visual Arts\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"33%\" |Theatre\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"33%\" |Dance\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Winner – Lindsey Mendick: Sh*tfaced\n** Soheila Sokhanvari: Rebel Rebel\n** Steve McQueen: Grenfell\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Winner – Ryan Calais Cameron (body of work)\n** @sohoplace (body of work)\n** Sherman Theatre (body of work)\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Winner – Boy Blue (Kenrick \"H2O\" Sandy  & Michael \"Mikey J\" Asante) - body of work\n** Clod Ensemble: The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady\n** Michael Keegan-Dolan: How To Be A Dancer in Seventy-Two Thousand Easy Lessons\n|-\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"34%\" |Literature\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"33%\" |Popular Music\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"33%\" |Opera\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Winner – The Bee Sting : Paul Murray'\n** Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder : Salman Rushdie\n** Soldier Sailor : Claire Kilroy\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Winner – The Last Dinner Party: Prelude to Ecstasy'\n** Cleo Sol (body of work)\n** Dave & Central Cee: Sprinter\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Winner – Death in Venice : Welsh National Opera and Nofit State Circus'\n** Wozzeck: Royal Opera House\n** English National Opera (body of work)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"34%\" |Comedy\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"33%\" |Classical Music\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"33%\" |TV Drama\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Winner – Fern Brady (body of work)\n** Blindboy Boatclub: The Blindboy Podcast\n** Julia Masli: ha ha ha ha ha ha ha\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Winner – James MacMillan: The Cumnock Tryst 2023\n** Anoushka Shankar: Chapter II: How Dark it is Before Dawn\n** Richard Blackford: Songs of Nadia Anjuman\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Winner – Mr Bates vs The Post Office '\n** Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland\n** The Sixth Commandment\n|-\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"34%\" |Film\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"33%\" |The Times Breakthrough Award\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"33%\" |Poetry\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Winner – How To Have Sex'\n** All of Us Strangers\n** Occupied City\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Winner – Aigul Akhmetshina: Opera\n**Ben Goldscheider: Classical Music\n** Ania Magliano: Comedy\n** Jemima Brown: Dance\n** Savanah Leaf: Film\n** Kaliane Bradley: Literature\n** Ella Frears: Poetry\n** Kneecap: Popular Music\n** Adjani Salmon: Television\n** Ben Weatherill: Theatre\n** Claudette Johnson: Visual Arts\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Winner – Momtaza Mehri: Bad Diaspora Poems '\n** Karen McCarthy Woolf and Nathalie Teitler: editors, Mapping the Future  anthology\n** Jackie Kay: May Day\n|-\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" colspan=\"2\" |Arts Hero\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" |Outstanding Achievement in the Arts\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n* '''Winner – Sally Spencer (Singer): Ex Cathedra and leukaemia nurse at Birmingham Children's Hospital'''\n** Graham Johnson (Producer): Tobacco Factory Theatre, Bristol\n** Mikei Hall (Senior Art Handling Technician): Tate Britain, London\n** Yvonne O'Donovan (Administrator): Creu Cymru, Wales\n** Linda Hogg (Head of Customer Services & Front of House): Capital Theatres, Edinburgh\n|\n* Winner – Melvyn Bragg\n|}\n2023 awards (27th annual ceremony)\nShortlisted nominees were announced on 15 June 2023.
