The awards recognize and promote outstanding brand names established by Hong Kong enterprises and are traditionally presented during the annual Hong Kong Products Expo.\nAward Objectives\nThe primary goals of the Hong Kong Top Brand Awards are to:\n* Recognise outstanding brands established by Hong Kong companies.\n* Encourage local enterprises to strive for excellence in branding and product development.\n* Promote Hong Kong products and services globally.\n* Enhance the profile of Hong Kong industries both locally and internationally.\nAssessment Criteria\nThe selection of the winning brands is primarily based on a rigorous assessment of several key factors, including:\n* Reputation (in Hong Kong, Mainland China, and Overseas)\n* Distinctiveness\n* Innovation\n* Quality\n* Image\n* Environmental Performance, Social Responsibility, and Corporate Governance\nThe Hong Kong Top Brand Awards logo\nRename and Introduction of new logos\nFrom 2004, the Hong Kong Top Ten Brandnames Awards was renamed as \"Hong Kong Top Brand Awards\" and a brand-new logo has been implemented to reinstate the previous Award logo. Supervised by Kan Tai Keung (靳埭強), the logo retained the fundamental features of previous \"Top Mark\", while also looking more internationalised, noticeable, fashionable and vibrant. On 2005 January 1, the previous Award logo will be totally suspended for any purpose. To reinforce the supervision of the use of logo, the Association also put the Hong Kong Top Brand Mark Scheme into practice autonomously, so as to bring in a unified identity system for Awardees, and to improve the reviewing process and continuing development of the Award.\nHong Kong Top Brand Mark\nAll awardees should account to the Organizer concerning products under the winning brands.
