Books published in the U.K. during the preceding calendar year are eligible. It recognises one \"Overall\" winner and one book in each of three categories: Books for Younger Children, Books for Younger Readers, and Books for Older Readers. The selections are made entirely by children, which is unique among British literary awards.\nThe Federation of Children's Book Groups owns and coordinates the Award, which it inaugurated in 1981 as the Children's Book Award. Its purpose has been \"to celebrate the books that children themselves love reading.\" From 2001 to 2015 it was sponsored by the mail order bookshop Red House, a brand owned by bookselling company The Book People.\nProcess and latest rendition\nThe 2017 Overall Winner was from the Books for Younger Readers category and was won by Michael Morpurgo and illustrator Michael Foreman for An Eagle in the Snow, published by HarperCollins. The 2017 winners were announced at an Award Ceremony held in London on Saturday 10 June 2017.\nThe 2016 Overall Winner was from the Books for Younger Readers category and was won by Pamela Butchart and illustrator Thomas Flintham with My Head Teacher Is a Vampire Rat, published by Nosy Crow.\nThe 2015 Overall Winner was from the Books for Younger Children and was announced at the Imagine Festival in February. The Winners were Oliver Jeffeys and Drew Daywalt with The Day the Crayons Quit published by HarperCollins.\nThe 2014 Overall winner was from the Older Readers category, announced in mid-February 2014: The 5th Wave, written by Rick Yancey and published by Penguin Books.\nWinners are determined by the votes of children on three category ballots composed by nominations from the same group. \"Children from around the world\" are eligible to participate in both stages. At least in Britain, many children participate through book groups.\nThe three ballots, or shortlists, comprise those ten books that garner the most nominations. There are four books on the Younger Children ballot and three each on the Younger Readers and Older Readers ballots.\nWinners\nCurrently the annual awards cover books first published in the U.K. during the calendar year.\nFrom 1992 to 2017 —the period of one Overall and three category awards— 13 Overall winners have come from the Long Novel or Older Readers category, 9 from the Short Novel or Younger Readers category, 4 from the Picture Book or Younger Children category.\n1980s\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+Children's Book Award winners, 1981-1989\n!Year\n!Author\n!Title\n!Publisher\n|-\n!1981\n|\n|Mister Magnolia\n|Jonathan Cape\n|-\n!1982\n|\n|''Fair's Fair\n|Macdonald Young Books\n|-\n!1983\n|, illus. by Quentin Blake\n|\n|Jonathan Cape\n|-\n!1984\n|, illus. by Michael Foreman\n|\n|Pavilion\n|-\n!1985\n|\n|Brother in the Land\n|Oxford University Press\n|-\n!1986\n|\n|Arthur\n|Spindlewood\n|-\n!1987\n|\n|\n|Heinemann\n|-\n!1988\n|, illus. by Korky Paul\n|Winnie the Witch\n|Oxford University Press\n|-\n!1989\n|, illus. by Quentin Blake\n|Matilda''\n|Jonathan Cape\n|}\n1990s\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+Children's Book Award winners, 1990-1999\n!Year\n!Category\n!Author\n!Title\n!Publisher\n|- style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n!1990\n!N/A\n|\n|Room 13\n|Doubleday\n|- style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n!1991\n!N/A\n|\n|Threadbear\n|Hodder & Stoughton\n|- style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n!

Subsequently, Ness and Kay as writer and illustrator won both annual children's book awards from the professional librarians, the Carnegie Medal and Greenaway Medal; that double award alone was an unprecedented sweep. In fact, no previous Children's/Red House Award winner (Overall) has won the Carnegie Medal and only one has won the Greenaway Medal for illustration: the inaugural Children's winner Mr Magnolia (Jonathan Cape, 1980), written and illustrated by Quentin Blake.\nAuthors with multiple Children's/Red House Awards\nMichael Morpurgo has won four Overall awards for ''Kensuke's Kingdom in 2000, Private Peaceful in 2004, Shadow in 2011 and An Eagle in the Snow in 2017. He has also won category awards for The Wreck of the Zanzibar in 1996 and Out of Ashes'' in 2002.\nFour other authors have won two Overall awards:\n* Roald Dahl 1983, 1989\n* Robert Swindells 1985, 1990\n* Jacqueline Wilson 1993, 1996\n* J. K. Rowling 1998, 1999\nJ. K. Rowling won the Long Novel category four years in succession, 1998 to 2001, for the first four Harry Potter books.\nSee also\nNotes\n}}\nReferences\nCitations\n* [http://www.redhousechildrensbookaward.co.uk/ Red House Children's Book Award] (RHCBA).
