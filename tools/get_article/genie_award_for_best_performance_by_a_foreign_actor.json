Initially, non-Canadian actors were simply barred from being nominated in acting categories at all, but beginning with the 7th Genie Awards non-Canadian actors instead became eligible for the Genie Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role and/or the Genie Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role.\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#bebebe;\"\n! style=\"width:8%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:19%;\"| Nominee\n! style=\"width:19%;\"| Film\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\"| 1980  1st Genie Awards\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| George C.
