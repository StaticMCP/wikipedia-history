Governments push for recycling, businesses seek profit, and consumers struggle to reduce waste. There is an overflows of waste on the land, oceans choke on plastic, and the fight for a cleaner future is more urgent. In Migori county, particularly at Rongo University, waste management has become a pandemic. Who  will win the war over waste?\nIn Migori county, particularly at Rongo University, waste management has become a growing concern. With increasing student enrollment and expanding of the university’s premise; infrastructure, the institution generates ‘tons of waste daily’, ranging from food leftovers to plastic waste and electronic junk. The big question remains – should we burn it, bury it, or fix it ?\nAround the university premises, from the hills of Kitere, students who are the comrades of the university have gone through a lot, especially for their health purpose. This is as a result of poor waste management which are most likely observed at their hostels that resemble their home for 4 years. Currently, most of the waste in Rongo University and surrounding areas ends up  in open dumpsites, where it is either burned or left to decompose. Burning waste, although is a quick solution, but emits toxic fumes contributing to air pollution and respiratory diseases among locals. On the other hand, burying waste in landfills risks soil and water contamination, affecting nearby communities that rely on natural water sources. However, a growing movement among students an environmental activists is pushing for the “fix it” approach thus embracing recycling, composting and sustainable waste management. Some students have started plastic collection acts, while local farmers see potential in composting organic waste for agriculture.\nWaste disposal around the University premises at Rongo University in Migori County.(Photo by Cyprian)\nAcross the globe, waste is spiraling out of control. Mega-cities are drowning in garbage, landfills are expanding beyond capacity, and plastic pollution is suffocating marine life. The world produces over 2 billion tons of solid waste each year, and that number is expected to rise dramatically in the coming decades. Yet, we still struggle to find a sustainable solution to this crisis.\n“Waste disposal carelessness has really led to rent evacuation. Me as an individual on my second year, second semester I lived at Jamora hostels, near the Chief (Down town). I decided to migrate and now I’m settling at Philrods. Hostels and I won’t leave there until I wore a gown for graduation. The main and the core reason why I migrated it’s because of the bad and rotten smell from the Jamora `s premise where litters were scattered anyhow.”\nShe also added “Despite of the caretaker (who is in charge of the hostels) digging a large pitfall for waste disposal, waste management has not been observed by the comrades living there. Since it's a storey building, students from their own houses threw their waste products like food remains all the way from the 3rd and 4th floor; making dispersal and scattering of waste when they reach ground floor. Some of the waste are mixed with dirty, thus resulting into a bad smell all over the hostel' premises. This makes it hard for our best friends against visiting us as time goes, due to a bad and unattractive smell from  the rotten waste.\nNot only the results from rotten waste is smell but also cause diseases especially the water borne diseases such as Cholera, Typhoid Amoeba and Bilharzia.” She continue “The outbreak of this dangerous diseases as really affected the well-being of the students, more so their proper hygiene. Painfully, some of them have been admitted into various wards of the hospitals around Rongo University. Just imagine, all this happens without their parent's concern.\nIndeed this waste management above the ground, where there are physically seen, have brought lot of affection to the students as whole to the community surrounding Kitere village. As for me, the only comment and remarks I can give to this pandemic; is pleading to the current government running, to look upon this issue. More so, to you as Journalist student who have decided to create a genuine and helpful story about, ' The War Over Waste'. It is a good way of creating awareness to the public since information remains to be power to human beings.\nThe splash of your story \"Burn it, Bury it, or Fix it,\" will call people into action. “Said Juliet Ayomba –PPA/234/2022 a 3rd year student from the school of Social and Political Science (SASSB).\nA 3rd year student living at Jamora hostels, explaining the effects of poor waste disposal around their buildings.(Photo by Cyprian)\nHostel choices\n“As a chairperson for RUSA (Rongo University Student Association), I have seen and observed clearly preferences made by many students, when it comes on matters of choosing a hostel of living for all that  4 full years. We are all human and no one would like to live around dirty environment , unless you don’t value your hygiene.\nMany hostels outside the campus have been left due to improper waste management, thus making the landlord/landlady to suffer construction cost as a result of rejection of being rented by some students who value their good hygiene. The household owners must be careful on this issue of managing the waste on their own buildings, if not then they won’t receive a good number of clients who are the students. These bosses can manage waste easily at their own hostels.”\nThe president explained . “There are various ways of  managing waste in our university: investing in composting organic waste, since much of the waste in Rongo University is organic composting of food and other agricultural waste, can help the farmers around the university premises to create natural fertilizer for farming instead of dumping them in landfills.\nAnother best method that can be used is recycling and water separation. There are those company in Migori town that deals with recycling of waste product especially the unrotten ones. They should allow them to collect plastics, papers and torn wear out for recycling. From my experience as an outgoing president of Rongo University, if the landlord and landlady observe this precautions keenly, then they will be at steps of fighting the war over waste.” Said President Victor Apicha, who is a 4th from the school of (INFOCOMS) Information, Communication and Media Studies at Rongo University, The Goldmine of Knowledge an Innovations.\nA conversation about ‘The War over Waste’ between University reporter and the President of Rongo University during a Global Environmental Day at Rongo University in Migori county.(Photo by Cyprian)\n“Waste management involves the collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste in a way that reduces environmental and health hazards. A proper approach for this includes waste reduction at the sources, recycling, composting and disposal of non- recyclable materials.\nHaving work in this institution for 9 good years, although some improvement on waste management have been made, it still remains to be an ongoing challenge.” Said Benson Asugo\n“ Factors such as inadequate disposal bin, improper waste segregation and irregular garbage collection can impact our institution's cleanliness. For instance, some few students have reported me on littering, overflowing bins and lack of proper waste disposal systems, in common areas within the university's premise. They have pointed issues of inadequate awareness of recycling and presence of hazardous waste surrounding.”\nHe also concluded that, “ To address these concerns, the learning institution which is our university should raise awareness by educating students on proper waste disposal, recycling practices and the importance of cleanliness. We should also involve students on this, by encouraging their initiatives like clean - up drives and environmental clubs. Lastly as institution, we will look forward on proper solutions, by suggesting improvement such as additional of bins, composting programs and collaborations with waste management companies.\nA collective effort between students, staff and administrators is crucial to ensuring a cleaner and more sustainable environment.” Said Benson Asugo the Head Dean of students.

This waste disposal around the city really affected the people and travelers in that town.\nThrough creating awareness and education on good and proper solutions for waste management, it was capable of managing waste. That’s why even up to now if you attempt to visit the city is ever clean. Rongo University should as well cope the doing done by Kisii University and waste problems will be easily handled\nThe battle over waste is not just a government issue, but it’s a global responsibility. Landfills are reaching their limits, incineration is not a perfect solution, and recycling alone won’t fix the problem. The real solution lies in waste prevention, circular economies, and systemic change. Countries like Sweden, Japan, and Germany are leading the way with innovative waste management policies, but the rest of the world must catch up. Governments, businesses, and individuals must work together to rethink waste and embrace sustainability.\nActions speaks louder than words .If we act now, we can win the war on waste before it’s too late. The choice is clear: Burn it, bury it, or fix it? The future depends on how we answer that question and that is it.\nENDS…\nReferences"
