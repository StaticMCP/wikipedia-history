      "text": "# King Su of Chu\n\nKing Su of Chu (), personal name Xiong Zang, was the monarch of the Chu state from 380 BC to 370 BC. King Su succeeded his father King Dao, who was killed by bandits in 381 BC.\nUpon his accession to Chu's throne, King Su executed more than seventy families who had participated in the murder of Wu Qi and the insulting of King Dao's corpse. However, he also abolished Wu Qi's reformist policies.\nDuring his reign, Chu fought with the Han and Wei states. In 375 BC, Han conquered the Zheng state which had been in alliance with Chu for centuries.\nKing Su died in 370 BC after 11 years of reign. Since he had no sons, his younger brother, King Xuan, became the next ruler.\nReferences"
