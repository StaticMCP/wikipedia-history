The state legislature chose four representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nGeorgia cast four electoral votes for the Democratic-Republican candidate and incumbent Vice President Thomas Jefferson over the Federalist candidate and incumbent President John Adams. The electoral votes for Vice president were cast for Jefferson's running mate Aaron Burr from New York. These electors were elected by the Georgia General Assembly, the state legislature, rather than by popular vote.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1800 United States presidential election in Georgia\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#008000; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic-Republican\n| Thomas Jefferson\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | 100.00%\n| align=\"right\" | 4\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#F0F071; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Federalist\n| John Adams (incumbent)\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Totals\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | 100.00%\n| align=\"right\" | 4\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Georgia\nReferences"
