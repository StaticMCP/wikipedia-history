It was founded on 1 October 1978, following a split in the Voltaic Communist Organization (OCV).\nThe PCRV follows the political line of the now defunct Albanian Party of Labour, an anti-revisionist variant of Marxism–Leninism which came to be known as Hoxhaism. It promoted a \"national democratic and popular revolution\" (, RNDP).\nThe 1983 Upper Voltan coup d'état elevated Thomas Sankara to power. At that time, the PCRV had powerful links in the trade unions and student movements. The party, however, refused to participate in Sankara's revolutionary government, arguing that a military coup was not the same as a popular revolution. In 1984, it again refused to participate in the government during a cabinet reshuffle. This led to a split and the formation of the Burkinabé Communist Group.\nThe PCRV is a participant in the International Conference of Marxist–Leninist Parties and Organizations (Unity & Struggle) or ICMLPO.\nThe party publishes Bug-Parga.\nSee also\n* List of anti-revisionist groups\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
