The primary deity of the temple is Shri Rajarajeshwari. The temple was constructed in the year 1978 by Sri Sivaratnapuri Swamiji (popularly known as Sri Tiruchi Swamigal). The idol of Goddess Sri Rajarajeshwari, a form of  Goddess Sri Lalita Tripurasundari.

The temple grounds are believed to be a sacred place for various devas, rishis, munis, and siddhas.\nTemple history\nHis Holiness Sri Sivaratnapuri Swamiji, also called as Sri Tiruchi Swamigal, established Sri Kailash Ashrama Mahasamsthana in Kenchenahalli, which is now known as Sri Rajarajeshwarinagar. Sri Sivapuri Baba, who resided in Kathmandu, was his guru. After initiating him, the Guru indicated there was a lot of excellent work to be done in the south and asked him to travel there. Mount Kailas was visited by Tiruchi Mahaswamiji before to his journey south. The triple deities of Durga, Lakshmi, and Saraswathi appeared to him there during a period of profound meditation, and a bodyless voice (Asarira vani) urged him to travel to Karnataka. He traveled from Bombay to Bangalore.\nOn the auspicious Sankranthi day of 14.1.1960, early in the morning, Sri Tiruchi Swamiji and two of his followers were driving to Mysore for a Pada Pooja. About six kilometers southwest of Bengaluru City, he noticed three garudas, or sacred eagles, circling overhead. They reminded him of Durga, Lakshmi, and Saraswathi, who had previously materialized on Mount Kailas. After exiting the vehicle, Swamiji noticed a route that led to the small settlement of Kenchenahalli. As he continued, he came across a small cottage in the middle of a grove of guava trees, where the eagles continued to circle. He chose that location for his Ashrama. Sri Tiruchi Mahaswamigal placed the foundation stone there for the temple.\nTemple architecture\nThe temple portrays Dravidian architecture which has five Rajagopurams. It has an open hall with pillars (Mukha Mantapa), a porch (antarala), an elevated sanctum (garbha griha), a large circumambulatory pathway (Pradikshina patha), and an inner courtyard. A lovely six-foot-tall stone figure of the Divine Mother Sri Jnanakshi Rajarajeshwari may be found inside the sanctum sanctorum (garbha griha).\nDeities inside the Temple\nThe temple complex has numerous shrines for various deities in addition to the main deity Sri Jnanakshi Rajarajeshwari\nSpecial aspects of the Temple\nIllumination of sanctum by the Sun\nOn 27 March every year, the sun directly hits the Devi's forehead and travels down to her feet, attracting more devotees.
