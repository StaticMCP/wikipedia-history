      "text": "# IWA Mid-South King of the Deathmatch\n\nThe Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South King of the Deathmatch is an annual professional wrestling tournament running since 1997 in which a number of wrestlers compete in various deathmatches, in (for the most part) a single-elimination tournament which is similar to World Wrestling Entertainment's King of the Ring tournament.  These tournaments include the typical weapons used in hardcore wrestling such as barbed wire, nails, thumbtacks, fire, and light tubes, and are known for their large amount of blood loss.\nNotable entrants in the King of the Deathmatch tournaments have included Ian Rotten, Axl Rotten, Necro Butcher, Mad Man Pondo, Chris Hero, Balls Mahoney, Nick Mondo, and Mickie Knuckles.  Many of the cards have also included non-tournament matches featuring top indy wrestlers such as Nigel McGuinness, Colt Cabana, CM Punk, Tracy Smothers, Homicide, Jerry Lynn, Jimmy Jacobs, Alex Shelley, Sonjay Dutt, B. J. Whitmer, Matt Sydal, Delirious, Arik Cannon, Ray Gordy, Low Ki, Daizee Haze and MsChif.\nIn 2006, IWA Mid-South introduced the concept of The Royal Weekend of Death, featuring the King of the Deathmatch tournament, as well as two new tournaments, the Queen of the Deathmatch and the Double Death Tag Team Tournaments. The 2006 & 2007 tournaments for Queen and Double Death happened in November on back to back nights, while the 2008 Queen of the Deathmatches took place on the afternoon of night 2 of King of the Deathmatches, with Double Death taking part on October 17 and 18. Notable participants of the Queen of the Deathmatch tournament include Mickie Knuckles, Lufisto, Annie Social, and Mike Levy.\nIWA Mid-South King of the Deathmatch Tournament\nKing of the Deathmatch 1997\nOctober 21, 1997 saw the first annual IWA Mid-South King of the Deathmatch Tournament, held at the National Guard Armory in New Albany, Indiana.\nCompetitors\n{|\n|valign=top|\n*Ian Rotten\n*Cash Flo\n*Rollin' Hard\n*Bull Pain\n|valign=top|\n*Balls Mahoney\n*War Machine #1\n*War Machine #2\n*Axl Rotten\n|valign=top|\n*Mad Man Pondo\n*Tower of Doom\n*Doug Gilbert\n*Ox Harley\n|}\nRound one\n# Ian Rotten def.
