Gökböri commanded the right wing of the Zengid army, which broke Saladin's left flank before being routed by a charge from Saladin's personal guard. Despite around  men being involved on both sides, Saladin gained a nearly-bloodless victory by the psychological effect of the arrival of his Egyptian reinforcements.\nFollowing the battle, Saladin initially placed the rightful heirs over these territories: Muhammad ibn Shirkuh in Homs, Palmyra, and al-Rahba; Shihab al-Din al-Harimi over Hama and Ibn al-Muqaddam in Baalbek. Gökböri himself defected to Saladin in 1182. Once his power was further consolidated, however, they were deposed in favour of members of his own dynasty.\nOn 6 May 1175, Saladin's opponents agreed to a treaty recognizing his rule over Syria apart from Aleppo. Saladin requested that the Abbasid caliph acknowledge his right to the entirety of Nur ad-Din's empire, but he was recognized simply as lord over what he already held and was encouraged to attack the Crusader kingdom in Jerusalem.\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n*  }}.\n*\n* .\n*  |date=2006 |title=God's Warriors: Knights Templar, Saracens and the Battle for Jerusalem |publisher=Osprey Publishing }}."
