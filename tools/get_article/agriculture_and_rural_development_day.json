Over 500 people attended in 2011, where British population biologist John Beddington \"presented key actions for avoiding a future in which weather extremes produce a succession of food crises\".\nThe fourth event took place at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD)—also called Rio 2012, Rio+20, or the Earth Summit 2012—in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It was co-hosted by the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa) and the CGIAR.\nThe fifth and final ARDD, called Agriculture, Landscapes, and Livelihoods Day 5 (ALL-5), took place alongside Forest Day on the sidelines of the 2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP18) in Doha, Qatar.\nIn 2013, this event merged with Forest Day to become the Global Landscapes Forum (GLF).\nReferences"
