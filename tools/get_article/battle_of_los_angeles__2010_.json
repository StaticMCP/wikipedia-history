Bucks demanded that the referee Rick Knox count both of them out but Excalibur ordered them to compete because they needed to have a winner. Bucks responded by superkicking Knox and then a second referee Patrick Hernandez stepped in and disqualified both men.

Ryan countered a rolling elbow attempt by Hero and pinned him with a small package to win the 2010 Battle of Los Angeles tournament.\nReception\nRyan Rozanski of 411Mania rated the night one 7 out of 10, stating it \"lengthy\" with \"enough quality matches to earn a slight recommendation\". He stated that \"the show started off with a hot opener and ended with an enjoyable main event.\" He considered Ricochet's debut against Claudio Castagnoli in the first round \"the match of the night\" while Austin Aries and Rocky Romero's match was \"smartly-worked\".\nHe heavily praised the night two as \"a consistent show with worthwhile matches throughout the card\". He rated it 8 out of 10. Rozanski appreciated Akira Tozawa for delivering \"a star-making performance\" against Chris Hero and praised the six-man tag team match featuring Fightin' Taylor Boys as an \"energetic\" contest. He gave mixed reviews to the last two matches which he believed \"weren’t able to top expectations\" and \"there was definitely room for improvement\".\nAftermath\nAfter winning the 2010 Battle of Los Angeles tournament, Joey Ryan was supposed to receive his title shot for the PWG World Championship but the champion Davey Richards vacated the title due to his outside commitments and was unable to compete in PWG for the rest of the year. As a result, at the following event, The Curse of the Guerrilla Island, a four-way match was set up for the vacant title between Joey Ryan, Chris Hero, Claudio Castagnoli and Brandon Gatson, the four semifinalists of the Battle of Los Angeles. Castagnoli won the vacant title.\nHowever, Ryan remained entitled to a World Championship match which he earned due to his Battle of Los Angeles win. Ryan successfully defended his #1 contendership for the title against the Open Invitational Gauntlet winner Candice LeRae at the 2011 Dynamite Duumvirate Tag Team Title Tournament. Ryan subsequently cashed in his title shot against Claudio Castagnoli at Card Subject To Change III but failed to win.\nThe alliance which formed between Brian Cage, Chuck Taylor and Ryan Taylor would begin to be referred as Fightin' Taylor Boys and Cage's ring name was changed to Brian Cage-Taylor at The Curse of the Guerrilla Island. Cage used that name and remained a part of the trio until the 2012 Dynamite Duumvirate Tag Team Title Tournament. He then quietly left the group and reverted to using his Brian Cage ring name at Death To All But Metal.\nResults\nTournament brackets\nThe tournament included eighteen participants, up from previous two years.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.prowrestlingguerrilla.com Pro Wrestling Guerrilla official website]"
