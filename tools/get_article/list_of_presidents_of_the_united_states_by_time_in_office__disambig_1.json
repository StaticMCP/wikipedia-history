The listed number of days is calculated as the difference between dates, which counts the number of calendar days except the first day (day zero). If the first day were included, all numbers would be one day more, except Grover Cleveland would have two more days, as he served two full nonconsecutive terms.\nOf the individuals elected president, four died of natural causes while in office (William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Warren G. Harding, and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy), and one resigned from office (Richard Nixon).\nWilliam Henry Harrison spent the shortest time in office, while Franklin D. Roosevelt spent the longest. Roosevelt is the only American president to have served more than two terms. Following ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment in 1951, presidents—beginning with Dwight D. Eisenhower—have been ineligible for election to a third term or, after serving more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected president, to a second term. The amendment contained a grandfather clause that explicitly exempted the incumbent president, then Harry S. Truman, from the new term limitation.\nWhile there have been 47 presidencies in the nation's history, only 45 people have been sworn into office; Grover Cleveland and Donald Trump were elected to two nonconsecutive terms.\nPresidents by time in office\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Rank !! data-sort-type=\"text\" | President !! class=\"unsortable\" | Lengthin days !!
