Marketed as \"the little aristocrat\", the Empire 20 was a four-cylinder shaft-driven runabout built in Indianapolis. The model \"A\" was a conventional runabout for three passengers with a rumble seat. The Model A had a four-cylinder engine with 2523 cc, a bore of 88.9&nbsp;mm, and a stroke of 101.6&nbsp;mm. The engine power was 20&nbsp;hp. The Engine was water cooled by natural circulation without pump. It had a two speed Gearbox. The gasoline capacity was 11 gallon = 47 liter. The wheelbase was 96 inches = 2438&nbsp;mm. The vehicle weight was 1350 pounds = 612 kilograms. The model \"B\" had two bucket seats, a longer hood and was geared higher to attain faster speeds.\nMore conventional bodywork was later offered; in April 1915 the marque announced production of a 35&nbsp;hp for 1916. The company's final products were a four of 3865&nbsp;cc and a six of 3670&nbsp;cc.\nThe business, Empire Motor Car Company, founded in 1909 was a project of Arthur Newby, Carl Fisher, James Allison and shock absorber manufacturer Robert Hassler who built the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1909. Their first car was designed by Harry C. Stutz.\nFrom 1912 to 1919, the Greenville Metal Products Co. of Greenville, PA, also produced the Empire. After 1912, 4 different models were produced, a five-passenger touring car and four-passenger four-door roadster with 6-cylinder engines. In addition were 4-cylinder five-passenger touring cars and two-passenger roadsters. A Greenville-made Empire is in the Waugh House, the Greenville Area Historical Society Museum.\nGallery\nFile:Empire Model 31 1913 (3).JPG|A 1913 Empire model 31 \"Little Aristocrat\", a five-seat tourer at the Haynes International Motor Museum in the UK\nFile:Empire 20 Runabout Model A (1909-1912).jpg|Empire 20 Runabout Model A (1909–1912)\nFile: Empire 20 Runabout Model B (1909-1912).jpg|Empire 20 Runabout Model B (1909–1912)\nReferences\n*"
