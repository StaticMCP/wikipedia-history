On January 31, 2022, MLW announced that the third Kings of Colosseum would take place on May 13 at the 2300 Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\nStorylines\nThe card will consist of matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by MLW's writers.\nAs part of MLW's \"Open Door\" Policy, the promotion will announce several free agents for Kings of Colosseum, including the MLW returns of former MLW World Middleweight Champion Lio Rush and Taya Valkyrie. Debuts include former WWE wrestler Lince Dorado. Former MLW alumni made appearances at the event in celebration of the promotion's 20th anniversary, including Los Maximos (Joel, Jose & Wil Maximo) and ECW alum The Sandman.\nThe main feud heading into Kings of Colosseum was between MLW World Heavyweight Champion Alexander Hammerstone and Dynasty stablemate Richard Holliday, who turned on the former at the end of the February 10, 2022 Fusion season premiere. At Azteca Underground, Holliday, Muertes & Mads Krügger defeated Hammerstone & The Von Erichs (Marshall Von Erich & Ross Von Erich) in a Trios Match. On April 6, it was announced that Hammerstone would defend his World Heavyweight Championship against Holliday at Kings of Colosseum.\nFormer Contra Unit teammates Jacob Fatu and Mads Krügger had been embroiled in a feud since the dissolution of the faction at War Chamber The two would meet in a Grudge Match on the February 24, 2022 episode of Fusion, where Fatu was victorious. Krügger would rematch Fatu in a Stairway to Hell Match on March 24, where the former picked up the win. Onn April 13, MLW.com announced that Fatu and Krügger will again meet in a Weapons of Mass Destruction Match at Kings of Colosseum. Weapons will be hidden inside military crates, which the two are free to break open and use whatever weapons are inside.\nThe Von Erichs were scheduled to challenge MLW World Tag Team Champions 5150 (Danny Rivera & Slice Boogie) at the Blood & Thunder Fusion tapings, but tested positive for COVID-19. As a storyline excuse, 5150 attacked The Von Erichs with steel chairs backstage on the February 17, 2022 episode. 5150 would later defeat replacements Los Parks (El Hijo de L.A. Park & L.A. Park Jr.) in a ladder match. 5150 would go on to lose the tag team titles on the April 1 episode of Fusion to the team of EJ Nduka & Calvin Tankman, collectively known as \"Hustle & Power\". Two weeks later, while Rivera was insulting the city of Dallas, he was confronted by The Von Erichs, only for the latter to be attacked by original LAX member Hernandez. The two teams would face off in a Bunkhouse Brawl, with The Von Erichs winning. On April 28, MLW announced a three-way tag team match for the MLW World Tag Team Championship, with Hustle and Power defending against The Von Erichs and the team of Rivera & Hernandez at Kings of Colosseum.\nOn March 5, MLW announced the official creation of the MLW Women's Featherweight Championship, with the inaugural champion to be crowned at a later date. On April 21, MLW announced that the inaugural champion will be decided at Kings of Colosseum, when Holidead faces the returning Taya Valkyrie.\nOn May 4, MLW announced \"The Thrilla in Phila\" prize fight challenge, in conjunction with MLW National Openweight Champion Alex Kane's Bomaye Fight Club. This is an open challenge where if the challenger can last twenty minutes in the ring with Kane, they will earn $20,000. However, this challenge also doubles as a title match, and if the challenger can beat Kane in under twenty minutes, they will become the new National Openweight Champion.\nOn the February 24 episode of Fusion, former MLW commentator Mister Saint Laurent introduced Mexican mini-estrella Microman to MLW. Microman would be regularly seen in Trios matches against members of Gangrel's stable, Strange Sangre. On May 6, MLW announced that Microman will make his singles debut at Kings of Colosseum, taking on Strange Sangre's Mini Abismo Negro.\nResults\n|time1 = 1:30\n|match2 = Matt Cross defeated A. C.
