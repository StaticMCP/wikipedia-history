After Im became pregnant, Zakrzewski married his wife, who adopted the American name Sylvia. The couple went on to have two children together: Edward III (also known as Kim) and Anna. Subsequently, Zakrzewski was stationed in South Korea for three years between 1989 and 1992, and later transferred to the Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, and his family relocated to Mary Esther in Florida's Okaloosa County.\nAccording to court documents, Sylvia faced discrimination while in South Korea for being married to an American and having a mixed Korean and American child, and her relationship with her husband was also strained after she moved to the U.S. with him and their children.\nOn June 9, 1994, due to various marital issues surrounding their marriage, Sylvia planned to divorce her husband, and also wanted to take custody of her two children and bring them back to South Korea with her, a matter that she deliberated for some period of time. Kim informed his father through phone about this plan while Zakrzewski was in midst of his work. Purportedly, due to his wife's intention to divorce him, Zakrzewski was angered over the matter and during his lunch break, Zakrzewski purchased a machete from a local store and took it home. There, he also gathered a crowbar and rope, hiding the weapons in the bathroom.\nDuring that evening, upon the arrival of his wife and children back home, Zakrzewski first attacked his wife. He struck Sylvia multiple times with the crowbar, then used the rope to strangle her. Afterwards, Zakrzewski targeted his children, and firstly, he called Kim into the bathroom to brush his teeth, before he struck the seven-year-old boy repeatedly with the machete. Next, he summoned his five-year-old daughter, Anna, to brush her teeth and killed her in similar fashion.\nAutopsy results showed that both the children had wounds on their arms and hands, which were consistent with defensive wounds; Kim died from severe head, neck, and back injuries while Anna sustained fatal machete wounds as well. Zakrzewski later dragged Sylvia's body into the bathroom, where he further mutilated her with the machete to ensure she was dead. Sylvia also died from both sharp force and blunt force injuries. Furthermore, the medical examiner, Dr. Edward Harvard, found that when Sylvia was strangled with the rope, she was still alive despite sustaining a fractured skull and at least eight machete blows to her back."
