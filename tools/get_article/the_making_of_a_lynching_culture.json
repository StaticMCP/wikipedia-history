      "text": "# The Making of a Lynching Culture\n\nThe Making of a Lynching Culture: Violence and Vigilantism in Central Texas, 1836–1916 is a 2004 book by American historian William D. Carrigan. The book takes a chronological look at the prevalence of lynching in central Texas. The first three chapters document the antebellum period and lynchings of Indigenous people, Mexicans, and White Americans, and how the circumstances around these lynchings molded a culture of lynching in the area. The later four chapters documents the lynchings of African Americans from after the Civil War through the Nadir of American race relations. Special focus is given to the 1916 Lynching of Jesse Washington in Waco, Texas.\nReferences\n;Notes\n;Sources\n*\n*\nCommentary and reviews\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
