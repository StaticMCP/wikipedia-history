The proposed name is locationally appropriate but would be repetitious. The Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) has chosen instead to restore a historical name to the vicinity. In the early part of the 1820–21 season, the Stonington sealers used the name \"President's Harbor\" (now New Plymouth) for the anchorage immediately off these beaches.\nLocation\nThe beaches are centred at  (British mapping in 1968, detailed Spanish mapping in 1992, and Bulgarian mapping in 2005 and 2009).\nMaps\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131109084308/http://hercules.cedex.es/Ecosistemas/ByersRadar.pdf Península Byers, Isla Livingston.] Mapa topográfico a escala 1:25000.
