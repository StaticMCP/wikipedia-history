He was hereditary Earl Marshal and the last undisputed Chief Butler of England.\nFamily\nHe was the son of Henry Charles Howard, 13th Duke of Norfolk, and Lady Charlotte Sophia Leveson-Gower.\nHe married Augusta Lyons (1821&ndash;1886), of the Lyons family, on 19 June 1839. She was the daughter of Sir Edmund Lyons (later 1st Baron Lyons) and Augusta Louisa Rogers, and was often known by her middle name, \"Minna\". The Duke had eleven children by Augusta. The Duke and Duchess are both buried in the mausoleum in Fitzalan Chapel on the western grounds of Arundel Castle.\nHis surname at birth was Howard; by royal licence dated 26 April 1842, his father (then Duke) added \"Fitzalan\" before his children's surnames, so they all became Fitzalan-Howard, which surname their male-line descendants have borne ever since. Their ancestor, Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, married Mary FitzAlan (daughter and heiress of Henry Fitzalan, 12th Earl of Arundel) in 1555.\nPublic life\nHoward was returned as a Whig for Arundel in the British House of Commons from 1837 to 1851, and for Limerick City from 1851 to 1852. He was a devoted Roman Catholic, and resigned from his Arundel seat rather than support the Ecclesiastical Titles Act 1851, but secured the Limerick seat when its incumbent, John O'Connell, resigned in his favour. He edited the Lives of Philip Howard, earl of Arundel, and of Anne Dacres, his wife (1857 and 1861). He raised the 9th (Arundel) Sussex Rifle Volunteer Corps on 28 February 1860 and commanded it as Captain.\nPrivate life\nThe Norfolk Royale Hotel in Bournemouth was originally built as a villa for the duke.\nFamily\nIssue\n{| border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n!Name!!Birth!!Death!!Notes\n|-\n|Lady Victoria Alexandrina Fitzalan-Howard||1840||1870||Married 1861, James Robert Hope-Scott\n|-\n|Lady Minna Charlotte Fitzalan-Howard||1843||1921||Carmelite nun\n|-\n|Lady Mary Adeliza Fitzalan-Howard||1845||1925||\n|-\n|Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk||1847||1917||15th Duke of Norfolk\n|-\n|Lady Etheldreda Fitzalan-Howard||1849||1926||Sister of Charity\n|-\n|Lady Philippa Fitzalan-Howard||1852||1946||Married 1888, Sir Edward Stewart, had 6 children.
