For each IWG, agency representatives meet to exchange information and collaborate on research plans and activities such as testbeds, workshops, and cooperative proposal solicitations.\nProgram Component Areas\nThe annual NITRD Supplement to the President’s Budget is organized by Program Component Areas (PCAs), where the PCAs are major subject areas for federal IT R&D. PCAs are intended to facilitate budgetary comparisons from year to year in each area. The PCA set evolves over time, reflecting changes in IT R&D activities at federal agencies and IT R&D priorities of the Administration. In its first annual report to Congress, the Supplement to the President’s Fiscal Year 1992 Budget, HPCC reported a FY 1991 base budget of $489 million, with eight federal agencies participating, and four R&D components. The FY 2024 NITRD Supplement to the President’s Budget reports to Congress an estimated budget of $10.9B billion across 25 Federal agencies and 12 R&D focus areas.\nParticipating agencies\nThe following federal agencies report their IT research budgets in the NITRD \"crosscut\" and provide proportional funding to support NITRD's operations:\nDepartment of Commerce\n* National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\n* National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\n*  The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)\nDepartment of Defense\n* Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)\n* National Security Agency (NSA)\n* Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and Service Research Organizations\n* Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)\n* Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)\n* Army Research Laboratory (ARL)\n* Office of Naval Research (ONR)\nDepartment of Energy\n* National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA)\n* Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (DOE/CESER)\n* Office of Science (DOE/SC)\nDepartment of Health and Human Services\n* Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)\n* National Institutes of Health (NIH)\n* National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)\n* Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC)\nDepartment of Homeland Security\n*  Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T)\nDepartment of the Interior\n*  U.S. Geological Survey\nDepartment of Justice\n* National Institute of Justice (NIJ)\nDepartment of State\n*  Department of State (DOS)\nDepartment of Veteran Affairs\n*  National Artificial Intelligence Institute (NAII)\nIndependent Agencies\n* National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\n* National Reconnaissance Office (NRO)\n* National Science Foundation (NSF)\nRepresentatives of other agencies also participate.\nCoordination\nNITRD's National Coordination Office (NCO) supports NITRD's planning, budget, and assessment activities. The NCO also supports the NITRD Subcommittee, which coordinates the NITRD Program, and the organizations that report to the Subcommittee. The NCO's director is appointed by the Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.\nThe NCO works with the NITRD agencies, IWGs, CGs and the White House Office of Management and Budget to prepare, publish, and disseminate the Program's annual supplement to the President's Budget, Federal networking and IT R&D plans, and networking and IT research needs reports.\nThe NCO provides technical support for the activities of the Networking and Information Technology Subcommittee of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, a panel of experts from industry and academia, in assessing the NITRD Program and preparing associated reports.\nThe NCO maintains the NITRD Web site – [https://www.nitrd.gov The Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Program] – which contains information about the Program and electronic versions of NITRD documents\nHistory and legal background\nThe Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Program (formerly known as High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) Program) was created by the High Performance Computing Act of 1991, (P.L. 102-194) and amended by the Next Generation Internet Research Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-305), and the America COMPETES (Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science) Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69). NITRD was reauthorized by Congress in the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act of 2017 (P.L. 114-329).\nDr. Donald A.B. Lindberg was the founding Director of the National Coordination Office (NCO) for NITRD, formerly the NCO for High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC). The High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 called for the coordination of activities in high-performance computing and the establishment of a National Research and Education Network (NREN) across Federal agencies. Dr. Lindberg led this effort from 1992 to 1995 while serving concurrently as the Director of the National Library of Medicine (NLM).\nDirectors\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Name !!
