Upon the death of Paul von Hindenburg in August 1934, the office was left vacant, with Adolf Hitler becoming head of state as Führer und Reichskanzler, in accordance with the Law Concerning the Head of State of the German Reich (retroactively approved by a referendum). In April–May 1945, Karl Dönitz briefly became President upon the suicide of Hitler (in accordance with Hitler's last will and testament).\nThe Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany of May 1949 created the office of Federal President of the Federal Republic of Germany (). Since German reunification in 1990, the President has been the head of state for all of Germany.\nThe East German constitution of October 1949 created the office of President of the German Democratic Republic (). Upon the death of Wilhelm Pieck in 1960, the office of president was replaced by a collective head of state, the Staatsrat (\"State Council\"). After the Staatsrat was abolished on 5 April 1990, the president of the Volkskammer (\"People's Chamber\") served as head of state until East Germany joined the Federal Republic on 3 October 1990\nWeimar Republic (1919–1933)\n† denotes people who died in office.\n| party             = Social Democratic Party of Germany\n| election          = 1919\n}}\n| born_year         = 1879\n|
