A week later, Kings former offensive coordinator John Booker was introduced as the new head coach for the 2023 season.\nAfter three different starting quarterbacks in the previous season, the Kings seek stability on this position with the signing of Kenyatte Allen from the GFL team Allgäu Comets. New and re-signings followed suit with defensive cornerstones Aslan Zetterberg, AJ Wentland, Lance Leota and AFI's defensive All-Star Roedion Henrique.\nRegular season\nThe Kings were removed from the league after week 6. This came after a two week saga, which include the team suggesting they will \"most likely have to stop competing in the European League of Football\" after their loan requested was denied by the league and cancelling the upcoming week 6 home match with Prague Lions. The Kings would later announce their withdrawal from the league on July 11, 2023. A day later the ELF announced that the team will be taken out of the league for the remainder of the 2023 season and their license to participate in the European League of Football was \"withdrawn\", but would like to accept the team back for the 2024 season, if a suitable new owners will be found.\nAll players from the roster were listed as free agents and were able to signed with other league franchises.}}\n|Running Backs=\n|Wide Receivers=\n|Tight Ends=\n|Offensive Linemen=\n|Defensive Linemen=\n|Linebackers=\n|Defensive Backs=\n|Special Teams=\n|Practice squad=\n|Reserve Lists=\n}}\nTransactions\nFrom Hamburg Sea Devils: Dominik Behrens\nFrom Stuttgart Surge: Noah Bomba\nFrom Berlin Thunder: Kélian-Mathis Mouliom\nStaff\nNotes\nReferences"
