Built in 1805 and restyled in the late 19th century, it is one of Keene's oldest brick residences, and now serves as the official residence of its president.  The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.\nDescription and history\nThe Keene State President's House is located on the east side of the college campus, on the west side of Main Street at its junction with Appian Way.  It is a two-story brick structure, with a low-pitch hip roof.  Its exterior is Italianate in style, with a symmetrical five-bay facade adorned with elaborate window lintels and a cornice with paired brackets.  An Italianate porch shelters the main entrance, supported by clustered square columns.\nThe house was built in 1805 by John Bond, the local postmaster and a shopkeeper, and was one of the first brick houses in the town.  Originally Federal in its styling, it was extensively redesigned later in the 19th century.  The house served as a girls' school from 1824 to 1844 under the oversight of Catherine Fiske.  The house was acquired by the state for use in a normal school, now Keene State College.  Its associated carriage barn, used for vocational automotive training, burned in 1925, and its basement hole was converted into a sunken garden.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Cheshire County, New Hampshire\nReferences"
