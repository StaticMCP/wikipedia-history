The play was also known as Royal Tour.\nLeslie Rees called it \"well ahead of its time... a thinly veiled satire on contemporary royalty... At the time this comedy appeared unplayable, or at least it was unlikely any group would play it; it might have collected production honours had it been written a few years later in the age of permissiveness or down-with-the-Establishment.\"\nThe play was given a reading at Sydney's Independent Theatre in 1965.\nThe play also may have a connection with an early revue of Gray's, Marx of Time.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
