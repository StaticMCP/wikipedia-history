It was produced by Jake Sinclair. The music video for the song was uploaded to YouTube the day of its release, and serves as a sequel to the music video of \"This Is Gospel\". \"Emperor's New Clothes\" was nominated for Best Track at the 2016 Kerrang! Awards.\nMusic video\nThe music video for the song \"Emperor's New Clothes\" was uploaded to Fueled by Ramen's official YouTube page on October 21, 2015. The video was directed by Daniel \"Cloud\" Campos, who produced and directed Panic! at the Disco's music video for \"This is Gospel\", from the album Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die! (2013). The music video takes place following the events that happened in the video for \"This is Gospel\" and sees Urie's transition at the moment when his body dies and his soul heads off into a white light. \"Emperor's New Clothes\" takes over as Brendon is in Heaven searching through the white light and fog, only to fall through a trap door down into Hell. He becomes the new devil from materials (dust) around him; turning his skin grey, and at the end is smiling evilly while the red light surrounds him as screams of the damned and loud thumping is heard from off screen.\n\"Emperor's New Clothes\" was named Video of the Year on Rock Sounds annual reader's poll in 2015. \"Emperor's New Clothes\" was nominated for Best Music Video at the 2016 Alternative Press Music Awards. The music video has over 300 million views as of June 2023, making it the most watched video of Death of a Bachelor.\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
