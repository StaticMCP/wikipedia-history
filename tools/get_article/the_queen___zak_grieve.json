The series investigates the story of Zak Grieve, a young indigenous man from Australia's Northern Territory who was sentenced to life imprisonment for his part in a contract killing, for which he wasn't present at the murder scene.\nThe series was presented by investigative reporter Dan Box and was developed and produced by In Films, in association with The Australian and Screen Australia.\nSynopsis\nThe Queen & Zak Grieve follows journalist Dan Box through the town of Katherine in Australia's Northern Territory as he investigates the killing of Ray Niceforo in 2011 and the events that led to 19-year-old Aboriginal man Zak Grieve being jailed, despite evidence he was not there when the crime took place.\nThe Northern Territory has had a 20-year non-parole mandatory minimum sentence for murder since 2004. In addition, if an individual fails to stop a murder in the state, that person can also be convicted of murder. The judge who presided over Grieve's case described the conviction as an \"injustice\".\nThe series features exclusive interviews with many of the people involved, as well as rare crime scene footage, forensic photographs, police interviews with suspects and trial recordings from the case.\nAftermath\nFollowing the broadcast of the series, the Northern Territory Attorney-General Natasha Fyles agreed to forward a mercy plea application to the Administrator of the Territory. After the Administrator's secretary told Zak Grieve's mother Glenice, that a letter she had written pleading for her son's release had formally triggered the mercy plea process, the NT's Chief Minister, Michael Gunner, described Zak's case as an “anomaly” of “blunt” legislation.\nOpposition Leader Gary Higgins, said he would support reforming the Territory's mandatory sentencing laws for murder. The Attorney-General said the royal prerogative of mercy was retained in the Northern Territory and exercised by the Administrator on the advice of the government, handed down by Cabinet.\nZak Grieve was released on Parole October 27th 2023.\nKey characters\n* Zak Grieve - Sentenced to life imprisonment.\n* Darren Halfpenny - Pleaded guilty to helping carry out the murder of Ray Niceforo.
