For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\". Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\nAll modern acts have a short title, e.g. the Local Government Act 2003. Some earlier acts also have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n53 & 54 Vict.\nThe fifth session of the 24th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 11 February 1890 until 18 August 1890.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  and 1888.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  in relation to Hospitals for Burghs.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  to Scotland.}}\n|  }}\n|  and for other purposes connected therewith.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n}}\nLocal acts\n}}\n|\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  and the purchase of Lands therefor.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and the Selby and Mid-Yorkshire Union Railway Act, 1883.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  and to make further provisions as to the supply of Gas and Water by the Corporation of Birkenhead; and for other purposes.}}\n|\n|\n|  and to confer additional powers on the Company with reference to their Capital and Railway and for other purposes.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  relating to the election of Commissioners and Auditor of the Tyne Improvement Acts relating to the levying and Collection of Rates and Dues; and for empowering the Commissioners to establish a Superannuation Fund; and for other purposes.}}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  relating to Hastings, Helmsdale, Mullion, Rhyl (New), and Yarmouth (Great).|po1=Hastings Pier Order 1890|\n|po2=Helmsdale Harbour Order 1890|\n|po3=Mullion Harbour and Piers Order 1890|\n|po4=Rhyl (New) Promenade Pier and Landing-Stage Order 1890|\n|po5=Great Yarmouth Fish Wharf Order 1890|}}\n|\n|\n|\n|  and for other purposes/}}\n|  }}\n|  relating to the Counties of Gloucester and Wilts.|po1=Gloucester Order 1890|\n|po2=Wilts Order 1890|}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  and for other purposes.}}\n|\n|\n|\n|  and for other purposes.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  relating to Lands in the Parishes of St. George Hanover Square and Fulham.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|  as amended by the Public Health (Ships, &c.)
