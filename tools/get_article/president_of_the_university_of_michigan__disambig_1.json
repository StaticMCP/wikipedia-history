The president is chosen by the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan, as provided for in the Constitution of the State of Michigan. Fifteen people&mdash;fourteen men and one woman&mdash;have held the office, in addition to several others who have held it in either an acting or interim capacity.\nThe University of Michigan's current interim president is Domenico Grasso, former chancellor of the Dearborn campus. Grasso was appointed by the Board of Regents on May 8, 2025.\nHistory\nThe office was created by the Michigan Constitution of 1850, which also specified that the president was to be appointed by the Regents of the University of Michigan and preside at their meetings, but without a vote. The precise wording has evolved through subsequent state constitutions, and as of November 2018 the office is defined by Article VIII, section 5 of the Constitution of 1963:\nBetween the establishment of the University of Michigan in 1837 and 1850, the Board of Regents ran the university directly; by law, they were supposed to appoint a chancellor to administer the university, but they never did, and a rotating roster of professors carried out the day-to-day administrative duties instead.\nWhile the modern office was created in 1850, the University of Michigan itself now traces its date of founding to 1817, when its precursor, the University of Michigania, was founded. The only president of that institution, Rev. John Monteith, appears in the list of presidents but is not officially considered to have been a president of the University of Michigan.\nList of presidents\nThe current interim president is Domenico Grasso, former chancellor of the University of Michigan-Dearborn.\nOf the previous presidents:\n* 1 had the office abolished\n* 1 died in office\n* 2 were removed by the regents\n* 5 retired at the end of their careers\n* 2 resigned to return to teaching or research\n* 4 resigned to take posts at other institutions (Northwestern University, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Princeton University, Columbia University, and the University of Florida)\nThe following persons have served as president of the University of Michigan:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Presidents of the University of Michigan\n!\n!Portrait\n!Name\n!Term start\n!Term end\n!\n|-\n|colspan=6 align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#ADD8E6\" style=\"Font-weight: bold;\" |President of the University of Michigania (1817–1821)\n|- style=\"height:6em; text-align:center\"\n| –\n|\n|scope=\"row\" data-sort-value=\"Monteith, John\" | Rev.
