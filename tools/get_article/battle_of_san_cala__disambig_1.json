But a misunderstanding with the forces under the command of General Gregorio Aráoz de Lamadrid caused Lavalle to suffer a terrible defeat at the Battle of Quebracho Herrado.\nNot considering themselves to be sufficiently strong in Córdoba, both generals agreed to retire toward the northern Argentine provinces, which were securely in the Unitarian camp.  At the same time, they sent two secondary columns to seize other provinces.  One of these, under the command of Mariano Acha, was defeated in its attempt to take the province of Santiago del Estero.\nThe second column was placed under the command of Colonel .  The best of Lavalle's troops composed this column, and their mission was to support the Unitarian revolutionaries who were, it was thought, ready to rise in the provinces of San Luis and Mendoza.\nThe Surprise of San Cala\nAs this second column headed to the Valley of Traslasierra, and near the Indian village of Sancala (near present-day San Carlos Minas, Córdoba), a division of Federalist cavalry sent under the command of General Ángel Pacheco in pursuit of the Unitarian column were rapidly closing in on it.\nOverly confident, Vilela had secured all his men in a huge corral surrounded by high stone walls, and he let them spend the night there without the vigilance of effective sentries.  Pacheco arrived in the vicinity of the corral at night; as his forces were inferior in numbers to those of his enemy, he decided to trust in surprise to gain a victory: Pacheco attacked at midnight, with his cavalry in column and through the only entrance into the corral. There was a slaughter with most of Vilela's soldiers perishing.\nAftermath\nAs the battle ended, Colonel Vilela himself had to flee through the desert toward Catamarca. He would fight in the Battle of Famaillá, the final defeat of General Lavalle's Unitarian forces, and together with Marco Avellaneda, the governor of the province of Tucumán, would be executed by Federalist firing squad at Metán.\nGeneral Pacheco would go on to organize a powerful Federalist army, with which he undertook a new campaign in Cuyo. In September 1842, at the battle of Rodeo del Medio, he would destroy the forces under General Lamadrid, last of the forces of the Coalition of the North, assuring the absolute dominion of the Federalist party in Argentina for another ten years.\nThe village of San Cala itself must be mentioned. Its inhabitants, strongly affected by the bloody battle and with their cemetery full of the bodies of the men killed in that battle, in the following years moved to a place a short distance away, the present village of San Carlos or San Carlos Minas.  The village of San Cala was deserted from then on and remains so today.\nReferences"
