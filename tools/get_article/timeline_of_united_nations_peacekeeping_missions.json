      "text": "# Timeline of United Nations peacekeeping missions\n\nin 1976 wearing the distinctive UN blue helmet]]\nThe United Nations has authorized 71 peacekeeping operations as of April 2018. These do not include interventions authorized by the UN like the Korean War and the Gulf War. The 1990s saw the most UN peacekeeping operations to date. Peacekeeping operations are overseen by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) and share some common characteristics, namely the inclusion of a military or police component, often with an authorization for use of force under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. Peacekeeping operations are distinct from special political missions (SPMs), which are overseen by the Department of Political Affairs (DPA). SPMs are not included in the table below.\n1940s\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Start!!End!!Name!!Acronym\n!Location!!Purpose!!Comment\n|-\n|1948||Ongoing||UN Truce Supervision Organization||UNTSO\n|\n||To monitor ceasefire in the Arab-Israeli conflict.\n||Authorized in June 1948 after the First Arab-Israeli War.
