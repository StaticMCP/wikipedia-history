Capitalizing on their unique status, and intent on teaching high school boys to never take girls for granted, they issue a challenge to the boys of Easthill's rival private schools, Selby and Lancaster. The winner in a series of designated competitions will be awarded exclusive rights to the girls as prom dates. Like the capricious and meddlesome gods of Greek mythology, the ACS girls pit the boys' schools against each other in a (secret) Prom War.\nCast\n* Raviv Ullman as Percy Collins\n* Alia Shawkat as Diana Riggs\n* Rachelle Lefèvre as Sabina\n* Nicolas Wright as Joseph\n* Kevin Coughlin as Geoffrey\n* Chad Connell as Rupert\n* Jesse Rath as Francis\n* Yann Bernaquez as Hamish\n* Cory Hogan as Jasper\n* Noah Bernett as Kyle\n* Alexandra Cohen as Maggie\n* Meaghan Rath as Jen L.\n* Mélanie St-Pierre as Jen Bergman\n* Daniel Rindress-Kay as Northrop\n* Keenan MacWilliam as Meg\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
