The Admiralty controlled global deployment of the Navy until 1964, when that department was abolished and replaced by the new Navy Department, within the newly formed Ministry of Defence.  These geographic commands usually comprised fleets, squadrons, flotillas, and single ships.  In 1954, major re-structuring of the composition of the Royal Navy was undertaken; leading to downsizing, and warships being rotated between the various fleets and stations.  Between 1954 and 1971, many commands were either abolished or amalgamated into larger geographic commands.  By the end of 1966, all Royal Navy squadrons were disbanded.  Squadrons remaining in the Far East Fleet were renamed, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Far East Destroyer Squadrons.  No squadrons existed in the Western Fleet for the period 1967 to 1971.  In November 1971, nearly all British naval forces were brought under the command of a single fleet, whose headquarters was at Northwood, Middlesex, then under the control of Commander-in-Chief Fleet (CinC-Fleet).  From 1981 to 2002, both Type 42 destroyers and frigates during this period were deployed to squadrons and the same ship class.  In peacetime, the squadron's role was usually administrative, and during the last two decades of its existence, the squadron was based at HMNB Portsmouth.\nOrganisational changes\nNote: Command structure organisational changes took place within Royal Navy post war period, the term Flotilla was previously applied to a tactical unit until 1951, which led to the creation of three specific Flag Officers, Flotillas responsible for the Eastern, Home, and Mediterranean fleets, the existing destroyer flotillas were re-organised now as administrative squadrons.\nOperational deployments\nIncluded:\n{|class=wikitable\n!from!!to!!deployed to!!additional notes\n|-\n|January 1952||August 1954||Home Fleet||on general assignments\n|-\n|September 1954||June 1955||Mediterranean Fleet||on general assignments\n|-\n|July 1955||February 1956||Home Fleet||on general assignments\n|-\n|March 1956||January 1957||Mediterranean Fleet||on general assignments\n|-\n|February 1957||August 1957||Home Fleet||on general assignments\n|-\n|September 1957||June 1958||Mediterranean Fleet||on general assignments\n|-\n|July 1958||December 1958||Home Fleet||on general assignments\n|-\n|January 1959||December 1959||disbanded||undergoing re-fits\n|-\n|January 1961||August 1961||Home Fleet||on general assignments\n|-\n|September 1961||April 1962||Mediterranean Fleet||on general assignments\n|-\n|May 1962||January 1963||Home Fleet||on general assignments\n|-\n|February 1963||November 1980||disbanded||\n|-\n|December 1980||April 1992||Second Flotilla, HMNB Portsmouth||Type 42 group\n|-\n|May 1992||February 2002||Fleet, HMNB Portsmouth||Type 42 group\n|}\nComposition\nIncluded:\n, Home Fleet, 1952\n*HMS Solebay (leader)\n*HMS Gabbard\n*HMS St. James\n*HMS St. Kitts\n*HMS Sluys - (September 1952)\n, Home Fleet, 1953\n*HMS Solebay (leader) - (July 1953)\n*HMS Gabbard - (February 1954)\n*HMS St. James - (June 1953)\n*HMS St. Kitts - (July 1953)\n, Home Fleet, to August 1954\n*HMS Duchess (leader)\n*HMS Decoy - (January 1959)\n*\n*\n, Mediterranean Fleet, September 1954 – June 1955\n*HMS Duchess (leader)\n*HMS Decoy - (January 1959)\n*HMS Diamond\n*HMS Diana\n, Home Fleet, July 1955 – February 1956\n*HMS Duchess (leader)\n*HMS Decoy - (January 1959)\n*HMS Diamond\n*HMS Diana\n, Mediterranean Fleet, March 1956 – January 1957\n*HMS Duchess (leader)\n*HMS Decoy - (January 1959)\n*HMS Diamond\n*HMS Diana\n, Home Fleet, February 1957 – August 1957\n*HMS Duchess (leader)\n*HMS Decoy - (January 1959)\n*HMS Diamond\n*HMS Diana\n, Mediterranean Fleet, September 1957 – June 1958\n*HMS Duchess (leader)\n*HMS Decoy - (January 1959)\n*HMS Diamond\n*HMS Diana\n, Home Fleet, July 1958 – December 1958\n*HMS Duchess (leader)\n*HMS Decoy - (January 1959)\n*HMS Diamond\n*HMS Diana\n, Home Fleet, January 1961 – August 1961\n*HMS Duchess (leader)\n*HMS Diamond\n*HMS Diana\n*\n*, (August 1962)\n, Home Fleet, September 1961 – April 1962\n*HMS Duchess (leader)\n*HMS Diamond\n*HMS Diana\n*HMS Crossbow\n*HMS Battleaxe, (August 1962)\n, Home Fleet, May 1962 – January 1963\n*HMS Duchess (leader)\n*HMS Diamond\n*HMS Diana\n*HMS Crossbow\n*HMS Battleaxe, (August 1962)\n, Second Flotilla, Portsmouth, December 1980 – April 1992\n*, (leader), (1980–84), (1989–96)\n*, (August 1981 - February 2002)\n*HMS Southampton, (leader)  (1985–89)\n* (March 1986 - February 2002)\n*HMS Cardiff, (leader) (1998-2002)\n*, (May 1982 - February 2002)\n*, (November 1982 - February 2002)\n*, (November 1982 - February 2002)\n*, (May 1985 - February 2002)\n*, (March 1986 - February 2002)\n, Fleet, Portsmouth, May 1992 – February 2002\n*HMS Exeter, (leader), (1980–84), (1989–96)\n*HMS Southampton, (August 1981 - February 2002)\n*HMS Southampton, (Leader)  (1985–89)\n*HMS Cardiff, (March 1986 - February 2002)\n*HMS Cardiff, (leader)  (1998-2002)\n*HMS Liverpool (May 1982 - February 2002)\n*HMS Nottingham (November 1982 - February 2002)\n*HMS Manchester (November 1982 - February 2002)\n*HMS Gloucester (May 1985 - February 2002)\n*HMS Newcastle (March 1986 - February 2002)\nSquadron commander\n{|class=wikitable\n!commanders !!lead ship!!dates\n|-\n|Captain Geoffrey Thistleton-Smith||HMS Solebay||January – April 1952\n|-\n|Captain John G.
