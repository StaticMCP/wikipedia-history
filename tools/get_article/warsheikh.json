Warsheikh is located in the southeastern Middle Shabelle region of Hirshabelle State of  Somalia. On the south, Warsheikh is bordered by the Banadir region, and on the north Adale District.\nWarsheikh was known to the ancient Greeks as Sarapion. Warsheikh is situated about 70&nbsp;km on the coast north of Mogadishu. Warsheikh is important historical Islamic center and has been centre of trade and learning in the region.\nEtymology\nThe origins of the name Warsheikh () has theory based on oral history and goes the following;\nAccording to oral tales, the name 'Warsheik' was coined by religious scholars who wanted to spread the Islamic religion in Somalia. They felt thirsty after a long journey, and then they raised their hands to pray to Allah to give them water to drink. Allah answered their prayers. They saw the splash of water on the ground a few steps away. After drinking the water, they met pastoralist family and asked for food and hospitality, but the family said there is no water to prepare food on, then the scholar said, \"Don't worry about it go there and you will find water\". The found water on the place the scholar water told her about, then the other villagers saw her carrying a Jerry-can and asked her where she gets the water from, she replied that the Sheik told her the information and she followed it (literally; Warkii (information) Sheekha (religious scholar).\nHistory\nWarsheikh is an early Muslim center in southern Somalia, Warsheikh was one of the principal settlements of the Sultanate of Mogadishu during the Middle Ages. The town has an old mosque situated near a cape, which features an inscription noting its construction in 1278H (1861–1862 CE) by Sheikh Abu Bakr b. Mihzar b. Ahmad al-Kasadi. The masjid has three rows of transverse, east–west piers, and a foliate mihrab. It also has attached chambers, with the Sheikh's tomb situated in an adjacent room.\nDuring the Middle Ages, Warsheikh and much of the surrounding area in southern Somalia was governed by the Ajuran Sultanate. The town later came under the administration of the Hiraab Imamate in the late 17th century after the collapse of the powerful Ajuran Empire. In April 1890, an Italian ship lieutenant Carlo Zavagli and sailor captain Angelo Bartorello were killed offshore by local Somalis in the Massacre of Warsheikh, that led to the first colonial naval bombardment in retaliation. At the turn of the 20th century, Warsheikh was incorporated into the Italian Somaliland protectorate. After independence in 1960, the town was made the administration center of the official Warsheikh District.\nOver the course of three archaeological expeditions in Warsheikh between 1920 and 1921, Enrico Cerulli uncovered coins from the medieval Sultans of Mogadishu. They were deposited in the Scuola Orientale of the University of Rome, but were later lost in World War II. According to Cerulli, similar coins were found in the village of Mos (Moos), located about 14&nbsp;km to Warsheikh's northwest. Freeman-Grenville (1963) also record another discovery of ancient coins in the latter town.\nDemographics\nThe population of Warsheikh center does not have official figures but is estimated at 65,000.
