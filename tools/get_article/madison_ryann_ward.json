She writes contemporary Christian music songs blending pop, R&B, gospel, blues, and folk influences. A former Division I volleyball player at the University of Oklahoma, she gained recognition after a viral video of her singing Aretha Franklin's Chain of Fools in a campus cafeteria. She later signed with Rick Rubin’s American Recordings in partnership with Republic Records and released her debut single, Mirror (2018).\nEarly life\nWard was born in Lawton, Oklahoma, to a church pianist mother and a father who owned a barbecue restaurant that hosted blues and soul musicians, exposing her to church music alongside secular soul and folk traditions. She excelled in volleyball and attended the University of Oklahoma on an athletic scholarship, where a viral performance video led her toward a music career.\nCareer\nWard signed with American Recordings/Republic Records, working with producer Rick Rubin. Her debut single, Mirror (2018), drew praise for its stripped-down production and soulful vocals, and she appeared on the Netflix series My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman.\nSeeking creative control, Ward later left the major-label system and founded the independent imprint Zelda House Records. She issued a series of devotional-leaning singles including Anchor, Love & Adoration, and Familiar. Her first full-length album, A New Thing (2023), compiled earlier singles with new material; its follow-up, Purified Love (2024), leaned more heavily into gospel while continuing to blend folk, soul, and pop elements.\nMusical style and influences\nWard’s sound combines neo-soul, gospel, blues, folk, and pop. Critics have likened her vocal approach to artists such as Lauryn Hill and India.Arie. Lyrically, she frequently explores faith, authenticity, empowerment, and love.\nPublic image\nWard presents a faith-centered public persona, discussing Christianity and spirituality in interviews and on social media while emphasizing themes of empowerment and honesty. She shares devotionals, studio footage, and personal reflections with a large following on Instagram.\nDiscography\nAlbums\n*A New Thing (2023, Zelda House Records)\n*Purified Love (2024, Zelda House Records)\nSelected singles\n*Mirror (2018)\n*Anchor (2020)\n*Love & Adoration (2021)\n*Familiar (2022)\nReferences"
