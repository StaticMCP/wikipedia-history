These traditions form a central part of Jewish history and identity, most prominently represented in the Book of Exodus, while also being discussed and questioned by historians, archaeologists, and Egyptologists.\nBiblical Tradition\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, the Israelites settled in Egypt during the time of Joseph, who rose to prominence under Pharaoh. Over generations, their growing numbers allegedly provoked fear among the Egyptian rulers. The Book of Exodus states that a Pharaoh \"who did not know Joseph\" (Exodus 1:8) enslaved the Israelites, forcing them into hard labor to build cities such as Pithom and Raamses.\nThe biblical narrative also records that Pharaoh ordered the killing of Israelite male infants, leading to the story of Moses' survival and eventual role in leading the Israelites out of bondage. This tradition culminates in the Exodus, a foundational event in Jewish memory and ritual, commemorated annually during Passover.\nAncient Egyptian Sources\nDirect Egyptian records mentioning Israelites or Jews in bondage are scarce. Egyptian inscriptions from the New Kingdom and later periods do not provide explicit confirmation of the biblical story. However, references to foreign Semitic populations living in the Nile Delta, particularly the Hyksos and later Asiatic laborers, suggest a possible historical background for traditions of foreign groups experiencing oppression or forced labor in Egypt.\nSome scholars connect the biblical account to Egyptian records of large-scale construction projects, which employed both Egyptian peasants and foreign captives. Others note that the practice of forced labor, conscription, and the enslavement of war prisoners was widespread in ancient Egypt.\nClassical Accounts\nGreek and Roman authors also preserved traditions about Jews in Egypt. The historian Manetho (3rd century BCE), as preserved by later writers, described a story in which a group of foreigners—sometimes identified with the Jews—were expelled from Egypt after causing unrest. These accounts are considered polemical and may reflect Egyptian hostility toward foreign groups rather than historical fact.\nLater writers such as Tacitus and Strabo also mentioned the Jews' supposed Egyptian origins, often blending myth, legend, and anti-Jewish rhetoric.\nScholarly Perspectives\nModern historians remain divided over the historicity of the biblical persecution.\n* Maximalist views hold that the biblical story preserves a core of historical truth, perhaps reflecting the memory of Semitic groups enslaved or marginalized in Egypt.\n* Minimalist views argue that the Exodus story is largely a later national myth, constructed during the first millennium BCE to provide a narrative of collective identity.\n* Many scholars suggest that the tradition may reflect a conflation of different historical experiences, such as the Hyksos expulsion, the use of Asiatic laborers, and Egyptian anti-foreigner sentiments.\nLegacy\nRegardless of its precise historicity, the narrative of persecution in Egypt has played a crucial role in Jewish self-understanding and religious practice. It has also influenced Christian and Islamic traditions, both of which preserve versions of the Exodus story.\nIn Jewish thought, the memory of oppression in Egypt has been invoked as a paradigm of endurance under persecution, shaping later interpretations of Jewish suffering in exile and diaspora.\nSee also\n* Exodus\n* History of the Jews in Egypt\n* Hyksos\n* Antisemitism in antiquity\nReferences\n* Assmann, Jan.
