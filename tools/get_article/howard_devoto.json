After Magazine, he went solo and later formed indie band Luxuria.\nEarly life and education\nHoward Devoto was born Howard Andrew Trafford on 15 March 1952.  Born in Scunthorpe, He grew up in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, and Moortown, Leeds.\nHe attended Leeds Grammar School, where he met and befriended future Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon. In 1972, he went to Bolton Institute of Technology (now the University of Bolton) to study psychology, and, later, humanities. During these college years, he met his future bandmates Pete Shelley and Ben Mandelson. He picked the stage name \"Devoto\" before meeting Shelley, from the name of a friend of his landlord called \"Andy Devoto\".\nCareer\nBuzzcocks\nInspired by the Sex Pistols, Devoto co-formed Buzzcocks with singer/guitarist Pete Shelley in 1976. He left the band in February 1977 after only one record (the Spiral Scratch'' EP) and a small number of performances to form the band Magazine.\nMagazine\nDevoto formed the post-punk band Magazine in 1977. They released several critically acclaimed albums, which met with moderate commercial success, as well as minor hits such as \"Shot by Both Sides\" and \"A Song from Under the Floorboards\". Magazine reformed in February 2009, initially performing on a tour of five dates, and subsequently continued playing live and began to record new material. A studio album, No Thyself, was released in October 2011.\nSolo years\nAfter Magazine split in 1981 Devoto spent two years putting together a solo album with former Magazine keyboard player Dave Formula. Jerky Versions of the Dream reached No. 57 in the UK Albums Chart in August 1983, and was reissued in 2007 by Virgin/EMI, featuring several tracks of bonus material.\nCollaborations\nA collaboration on three songs with Bernard Szajner on the Brute Reason LP was released on Island Records in 1983. This was followed by a rendering of Big Star's \"Holocaust\" for the loose collective This Mortal Coil. The album ''It'll End in Tears'' contained contributions from many of the 4AD label's best artists, Devoto's presence being somewhat atypical.\nIn 1997, Devoto wrote the lyrics to the Mansun track \"Everyone Must Win\", which appeared on the Closed for Business EP. A year later he collaborated again with the band, writing lyrics for and singing on \"Railings\", a B-side for \"Being a Girl (Part One)\".\nLuxuria\nOne of his next projects was a 1988 collaboration with Liverpool multi-instrumentalist Noko. As Luxuria they released two albums and a music video for the single \"Redneck\".\nLife after popular music\nFor most of the 1990s Devoto was little involved in music, earning his living by working for a photo agency.\nIn 2001, he teamed up with Buzzcocks colleague Pete Shelley for the first time in twenty-five years, and released the much-anticipated Buzzkunst under the name ShelleyDevoto. Reviews were mixed.\nIn 2002, Devoto had a small part in the movie 24 Hour Party People, a film about Manchester's Factory Records. In his brief cameo appearance, Devoto appears as a caretaker cleaning a men's toilet while actor Martin Hancock portrays Devoto having a tryst with the wife of promoter/journalist Tony Wilson. The real-life Devoto breaks the fourth wall by addressing the camera and stating, deadpan, \"I definitely don't remember this happening\".\nMagazine reformed in February 2009, with former Luxuria partner Noko replacing the deceased John McGeoch on guitar.\nReunion with Buzzcocks\nIn November 2011, it was announced he would be returning to the stage with Buzzcocks for two special shows as part of the Buzzcocks \"Back to Front\" tour on 25 and 26 May 2012. These took place at the O2 Apollo in Manchester and the O2 Academy in Brixton\nTributes, honours, and cover songs\nDevoto's singing has been characterised as a \"speak-sing voice that veered between amused croon and panicked yelp\".\nA number of bands continue to be influenced by his work. Momus recorded the tribute song \"The Most Important Man Alive\"  for the Bungalow Records compilation Suite 98 in 1998. Mansun have covered \"Shot by Both Sides\" live, and recorded it on their fourth and final album Kleptomania.  Radiohead and Jarvis Cocker have both covered \"Shot by Both Sides\". Both Ministry and Peter Murphy have covered Magazine's \"The Light Pours Out of Me\", whilst Simple Minds, My Friend The Chocolate Cake, Morrissey and Strange Boutique have covered Magazine's \"A Song from Under the Floorboards\".\nOn 9 July 2009, Devoto was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Bolton for his contribution to music.\nDiscography\nFor Magazine and Luxuria, see Discography of Magazine and Discography of Luxuria.
