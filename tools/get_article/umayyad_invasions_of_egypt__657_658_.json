The Umayyad forces swiftly defeated the forces of Ali, led by Muhammad, resulting in the annexation of Egypt by Mu'awiya and the reinstatement of Amr as its governor.\nPolitical instability in Egypt\nIn 658 CE, Egypt was embroiled in significant political instability as a result of the First Fitna (656–661), the first civil war among the Muslims triggered by the assassination of the third Rashidun caliph Uthman ibn Affan. Following his death, Ali ibn Abi Talib, the son-in-law and cousin of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, took over the leadership of the Caliphate. Ali's authority rejected by several supporters of Uthman, including by Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan, the long-time governor of the Levant. To consolidate his power, Ali appointed his foster son Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, who was also the son of the first Rashidun caliph Abu Bakr, as his governor of Egypt.\nMuhammad's appointment turned to be unpopular, particularly amongst the supporters of Uthman. This led to tensions between factions which supported Ali and those who sought revenge for Uthman’s death. The situation further deteriorated when Muhammad was unable to suppress the growing resistance from the local Uthmanids, who considered Ali's leadership to be illegitimate. The turmoil in Egypt was a result of the lack of popular support for both Ali's rule and Muhammad's governorship which paved the way for the Uthmanids to gain support for their agenda.\nAs the conflict intensified, Mu'awiya I sought to carry out a military intervention in support of the Uthmanids and annex Egypt from Ali's control. Mu'awiya sent his forces, led by his top general Amr ibn al-As, to launch an offensive against Ali's forces in Egypt. Amr, who was the conqueror of Egypt and its first Arab governor, gathered support from the Uthmanids. The Umayyad forces swiftly defeated the troops led by Muhammad. After their victory, Amr ibn al-As restored himself as the governor of Egypt, pledging allegiance to Mu'awiya and bringing Egypt under Umayyad control.\nExpeditions against the Uthmanids\nThe Uthmanids, led by Yazid ibn al-Hārith who was bolstered by his ties to Muhammad's predecessor Qays ibn Sa'd, gathered at Kharbita. Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr first sent al-Harith ibn Jumhan al-Ju‘fi to lead an offensive against them, but al-Harith was killed in the engagement. He then dispatched Ibn Mudahim al-Kalbi in a second expedition, which also failed to defeat the Uthmanids.\nInvasion of Egypt (658)\nThe failure of Muhammad in quelling the growing resistance of the local Uthmanids laid the groundwork for Mu'awiya I to takeover Egypt. The local Egyptian forces were split between the supporters of Ali, and the supporters of Uthman, who were backed by the Umayyad forces of Mu'awiya, who led the opposition to Ali's rule over the Caliphate.\nMu'awiya sent his forces under Amr ibn al-As for the invasion of Egypt. The Umayyad forces were documented to be around 6,000 troops, while the forces of Ali, led by Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, were approximately 2,500. The military engagement resulted in the defeat of Ali's forces and the establishment of Umayyad authority over Egypt with Amr ibn al-As as its governor. The conflict was a turning point during the civil war that led towards the establishment of the Umayyad Caliphate.\nSee also\n* Battle of Siffin\n* Mu'awiya I's Southern Campaigns (658-661)\n* Banu Najiyah revolt\nReferences"
