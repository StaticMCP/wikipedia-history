Located in the city of Dwaraka, Gujarat, India it is the pascimāmnāya matha, or Western Āmnāya Pītham amongst the four Chaturāmnāya Pīthams. It is also known as the Kālikā Matha. Their Vedantic mantra or Mahavakya is Tattvamasi (\"That('s how) you are\"). According to tradition, believed to be initiated by Adi Shankara, it holds authority over Sama Veda. The head of the matha is called Shankarayacharya, the title derives from Adi Shankara.\nStructure\nDvaraka Pitha is one of the four  (religious centers) believed by tradition to be established by Adi Shankaracharya (9th cent. CE,) who is portrayed as pioneering the unification of Hindu religious beliefs in the country. It is a four storied structure representing four  believed by a tradition, developed in the 14th-17th century, to be established by Shankaracharya in different parts of the country. There are paintings on the walls here depicting the life history of Shankaracharya while the dome has carvings of Shiva in different postures.\nWebsite: [https://shreesharadapithmathdwarka.org/ www.shreesharadapithmathdwarka.org]\nRecent Shankaracharyas\n# Shri Trivikrama Tirtha was the head of the monastery until 1921 when he was succeeded by Sri Bharati Krishna Tirtha.\n# Shri Bharati Krishna Tirtha was invited to lead the Puri matha in 1925 after the position had become vacant.\n# Shri Bharati Krishna Tirtha was succeeded by Shri Swarupananda Saraswati.\n# Shri Swaroopananda Saraswati was succeeded by Shri Sadananda Saraswati in 2022.\nIn 1945, Shri Abhinava Sachchidananda Tirtha was nominated to the position. Before assuming his position at Dwarka, Abhinava was the head of the Mulabagal Math in Karnataka, which was the 17th century branch of the Dvaraka Math. As a result, the cumulative lineage of Mulabagal Math was merged with Dwarka when Abhinava took office there. Years later Shri Sachchidananda helped to mediate the Shankarcharya successions at Puri and Jyotir Math.\nSince Abhinava died in 1982, this peeth has been led by  Swarupananda Saraswati who is one of the claimants to the position of Shankaracharya of the northern matha called Jyotish Pitha or Jyotir Math.\nAfter the death of Swami Swarupananda Saraswati, who was the Shankracharya of Dwarka Sharada Math, Sadananda Saraswati was made the Shankaracharya of Dwarka Sharada Math.\nNotes\nSee also\n* Adi Shankara\n* Shankaracharya\n*Kalady, Kerala - the holy birthplace of Jagadguru Adi Shankaracharya\n*Govardhan Math Peetham (East), Puri, Orissa\n*Jyotir Badrikashram Peetham (North), Joshimath, Uttarakhand\n*Shri Sringeri Sharada Peetham (South), Sringeri, Karnataka\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*"
