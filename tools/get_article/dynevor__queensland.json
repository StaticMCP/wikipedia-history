In the , Dynevor had a population of 21 people.\nOn 17 April 2020, the Queensland Government reorganised the nine localities in the Shire of Bulloo, resulting in six localities. This included discontinuing Dynevor, incorporating its land into an enlarged locality of Thargomindah.\nGeography\nDynevor was in the Channel Country. It was arid land, mostly flat and approximately 150 metres above sea level. Although there was a network of mostly unnamed creeks through the locality, these were usually dry creek beds. An area of higher land (about 200 metres above sea level) ran north to south through the locality, resulting in the creeks in the west of the locality forming part of the Bulloo River drainage basin and in the east of the locality forming part of the Paroo River drainage basin.\nThe land was predominantly leased for pastoral purposes, the northern part of the locality being the Dynevor Downs pastoral lease (and presumably the source of the locality name). The north-west part of the locality contained the entire Lake Bindegolly National Park while a portion of the Currawinya National Park could be found in the north-east although the bulk of that national park was in adjacent Hungerford.\nThe Cunnamulla Road (also known as the Bulloo Developmental Road and the Adventure Way) from Thargomindah to  Cunnamulla passed from west to east through the northern part of the locality. The Hungerford Road from Thargomindah to Hungerford passed from north to south through the western part of the locality.\nThere was no town in the locality but the town of Thargomindah was only 1&nbsp;km from the locality's north-west boundary and the town of Yowah was 4&nbsp;km from the locality's north-east boundary. The Dynevor Downs Homestead is located on the Cunnamulla Road () and has the Dynevor Downs Airport   with three runways (north-south, east-west, and NE-SW), the longest being 1050 metres, the others being about 800 metres.\nHistory\nMargany (also known as Marganj, Mardigan, Marukanji, Maranganji) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Margany people. The Margany language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Quilpie Shire, taking in Quilpie, Cheepie and Beechal extending towards Eulo and Thargomindah, as well as the properties of Dynevor Downs and Ardoch.\nIn the , Dynevor had a population of 21 people.\nReferences\nExternal links"
