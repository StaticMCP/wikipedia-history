The show was broadcast on CBS at 8 p.m. ET/PT and was hosted for the third time by LL Cool J. The show was moved to January to avoid competing with the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, as was the case in 2010.\nThe eligibility period for the 56th Annual Grammy Awards was October 1, 2012, to September 30, 2013. The nominations were announced on December 6, 2013 during a live televised concert on CBS, ''The Grammy Nominations Concert Live – Countdown to Music's Biggest Night. Jay-Z received the most nominations with nine. Justin Timberlake, Kendrick Lamar, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis and Pharrell Williams each received seven nominations. Daft Punk and Pharrell Williams were nominated twice for both Album of the Year and Record of the Year. Sound engineer Bob Ludwig received the most nominations by a non-performing artist, with five.\nDaft Punk won five awards, including Album of the Year for Random Access Memories'' and Record of the Year, with Pharrell Williams, for \"Get Lucky\", Best Pop Duo/Group Performance, and an additional win for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical completing a clean sweep for the project that night. Macklemore and Ryan Lewis won four trophies, including Best New Artist, and led an industry show of support for gay marriage with a performance of their song \"Same Love\" to accompany a mass wedding of gay and heterosexual couples, which was presided over by Queen Latifah. Lorde's \"Royals\" received awards for Best Pop Solo Performance and Song of the Year. Carole King was honored as MusiCares Person of the Year on January 24, two days prior to the awards ceremony.\nOn June 4, 2013, the Recording Academy approved a number of changes recommended by its Awards & Nominations Committee, including adding a new category for Best American Roots Song to the American Music field. This songwriters' award will encompass all the subgenres in this field such as Americana, bluegrass, blues, folk, and regional roots music. The Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance category was renamed Best Metal Performance and became a stand-alone category. Hard rock performances will now be screened in the Best Rock Performance category. The Music Video field will become the Best Music Video/Film field. Its two categories will be renamed: Best Short Form Music Video will now be known as Best Music Video and Best Long Form Music Video will change into Best Music Film. These changes bring the total number of categories at the 2014 Grammy Awards to 82, up from 81 at the 2013 Grammy Awards.\nPerformers\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Artist(s)\n!Song(s)\n|-\n|BeyoncéJay-Z\n|\"Drunk in Love\"\n|-\n|Lorde\n|\"Royals\"\n|-\n|-\n|Hunter Hayes\n|\"Invisible\"\n|-\n|Katy PerryJuicy J\n|\"Dark Horse\"\n|-\n|Robin ThickeChicago\n|\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\"\"Beginnings\"\"Saturday in the Park\"\"Blurred Lines\"\n|-\n|Keith UrbanGary Clark Jr.\n|\"Cop Car\"\n|-\n|John Legend\n|\"All of Me\"\n|-\n|Taylor Swift\n|\"All Too Well\"\n|-\n|P!nkNate Ruess\n|\"Try\"\"Just Give Me a Reason\"\n|-\n|Ringo Starr\n|\"Photograph\"\n|-\n|Kendrick LamarImagine Dragons\n|\"m.A.A.d city\"\"Radioactive\"\n|-\n|Kacey Musgraves\n|\"Follow Your Arrow\"\n|-\n|Paul McCartneyRingo Starr\n|\"Queenie Eye\"\n|-\n|Merle HaggardKris KristoffersonWillie NelsonBlake Shelton\n|\"Highwayman\"\"Okie from Muskogee\"\"Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys\"\n|-\n|Daft PunkNile RodgersStevie WonderPharrell Williams\n|\"Get Lucky\"\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\"\"Lose Yourself to Dance\"\"Le Freak\"\"Another Star\"\"Around the World\"\n|-\n|Sara BareillesCarole King\n|\"Beautiful\"\"Brave\"\n|-\n|MetallicaLang Lang\n|\"One\"\n|-\n|Macklemore & Ryan LewisMary LambertMadonnaQueen LatifahTrombone Shorty & Orleans Avenue\n|\"Same Love\"\"Open Your Heart\"\n|-\n|Billie Joe ArmstrongMiranda Lambert\n|Tribute to Phil Everly\"When Will I Be Loved\"\n|-\n|Nine Inch NailsQueens of the Stone AgeDave GrohlLindsey Buckingham\n|\"Copy of A\"\"My God Is the Sun\"\n|}\nPresenters\n*Pharrell Williams and Anna Kendrick – presented Best New Artist\n*Anna Faris and Juanes – presented Best Pop Duo/Group Performance\n*Steve Coogan – introduced Katy Perry\n*Bruno Mars – introduced P!nk\n*Ariana Grande and Miguel – presented Best Pop Solo Performance\n*Black Sabbath – introduced Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr\n*Jamie Foxx – presented Best Rap/Sung Collaboration\n*Julia Roberts – introduced Paul McCartney\n*Gloria Estefan and Marc Anthony – presented Best Pop Vocal Album\n*Jeremy Renner – introduced Willie Nelson, Blake Shelton, Merle Haggard and Kris Kristofferson\n*Zac Brown and Martina McBride – presented Best Country Album\n*Neil Patrick Harris – introduced Daft Punk\n*Cyndi Lauper – introduced Sara Bareilles and Carole King\n*Sara Bareilles and Carole King – presented Song of the Year\n*Jared Leto – introduced Metallica\n*Smokey Robinson and Steven Tyler – presented Record of the Year\n*Queen Latifah – introduced Macklemore & Ryan Lewis\n*John Legend and Ryan Seacrest – presented Music Educator Award\n*Lang Lang – introduced \"In Memoriam\"\n*Olivia Harrison, Alicia Keys and Yoko Ono – presented Album of the Year\nWinners and nominees\nThe winners and nominees per category were:\nGeneral\n;Record of the Year\n*\"Get Lucky\" – Daft Punk, Pharrell Williams & Nile Rodgers\n** Thomas Bangalter & Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, producers;\n** Peter Franco, Mick Guzauski, Florian Lagatta & Daniel Lerner, engineers/mixers;\n** Bob Ludwig & Antoine Chabert, mastering engineers\n* \"Radioactive\" – Imagine Dragons\n** Alex Da Kid, producer;\n** Manny Marroquin & Josh Mosser, engineers/mixers;\n** Joe LaPorta, mastering engineer\n* \"Royals\" – Lorde\n** Joel Little, producer;\n** Joel Little, engineer/mixer;\n** Stuart Hawkes, mastering engineer\n* \"Locked Out of Heaven\" – Bruno Mars\n** Jeff Bhasker, Emile Haynie, Mark Ronson & The Smeezingtons, producers;\n** Alalal, Josh Blair, Wayne Gordon, Ari Levine, Manny Marroquin & Mark Ronson, engineers/mixers;\n** David Kutch, mastering engineer\n* \"Blurred Lines\" – Robin Thicke featuring T.I. and Pharrell Williams\n** Pharrell, producer;\n** Andrew Coleman & Tony Maserati, engineers/mixers;\n** Chris Gehringer, mastering engineer\n;Album of the Year\n*Random Access Memories – Daft Punk\n** Julian Casablancas, DJ Falcon, Todd Edwards, Chilly Gonzales, Giorgio Moroder, Panda Bear, Nile Rodgers, Paul Williams & Pharrell Williams, featured artists;\n** Thomas Bangalter, Julian Casablancas, Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, DJ Falcon & Todd Edwards, producers;\n** Peter Franco, Mick Guzauski, Florian Lagatta, Guillaume Le Braz & Daniel Lerner, engineers/mixers;\n** Antoine Chabert & Bob Ludwig, mastering engineers\n* The Blessed Unrest – Sara Bareilles\n** Sara Bareilles, Mark Endert & John O'Mahony, producers;\n** Jeremy Darby, Mark Endert & John O'Mahony, engineers/mixers;\n** Greg Calbi, mastering engineer\n* Good Kid, M.A.A.D City – Kendrick Lamar\n** Mary J.
