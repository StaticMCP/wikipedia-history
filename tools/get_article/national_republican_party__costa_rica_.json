The party's candidate Ricardo Jiménez Oreamuno was elected president in 1910. A non-elected president member of the party was Alfredo González Flores who became the only president of Costa Rica appointed by the Congress.\nAfter electing Jiménez on three occasions, the party also secured the election of León Cortés Castro in 1936, Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia in 1940 and Teodoro Picado Michalski in 1944 becoming a dominant party. During Calderón's leadership the party moved toward Christian democracy and Christian socialism making some of the country's first social reforms in alliance with the Communist Party.\nIn 1940, the National Republican Party won the elections. Criticism over corruption, authoritarianism and voting fraud against the party and the results of the 1948 election in which the republican-dominated Congress overturned the elections because its candidate Calderón apparently lost because of the 1948 Civil War. After that the party was banned for a while and its leaders Calderón and Picado in exile. The party would still remain relevant in the political system once democracy was restored but would only attain power in coalition with liberal forces (the party endorsed the successful candidacies of Mario Echandi and José Joaquín Trejos as part of alliances with other parties), eventually disappearing.\nRafael Ángel Calderón Fournier (Calderón's son) founded a new party named Social Christian Republican Party in 2014 using the traditional party's colors and flag.\nIdeology\nWhile the party was initially associated with coffee growing oligarchs and liberal elites and supported policies favorable towards these groups, the party moved towards Catholic socialist principles and alliance with the communists in the 1940s. Under the presidency of Calderón Guardia, the party \"eschewed the support of the coffee oligarchy and developed a broad coalition, which included the Catholic Church and the Communist Party\", and the party reoriented itself as \"an instrument of the working and middle groups\".\nReferences"
