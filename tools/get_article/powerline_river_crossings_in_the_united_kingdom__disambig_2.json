Overhead power lines are supported on towers (called pylons in the UK) which are usually significantly taller than overland pylons and are more widely spaced to cross the river in a single span. Tall pylons ensure that the electricity cables which they support provide an adequate safety clearance for river traffic.\nOverhead crossings\nThe tallest and longest overhead power line river crossings in the United Kingdom are:\nThe tallest electricity pylons in the UK are those of the 400 kV Thames Crossing, at West Thurrock, which are 190&nbsp;m (630&nbsp;ft) high. These were constructed by BICC in 1965. The cables stretch 1300 m (4,500&nbsp;ft) across the River Thames and have a minimum clearance of 76&nbsp;m (250&nbsp;ft). There are two 400 kV circuits that connect Littlebrook substation on the south bank to West Thurrock substation on the north side.\ncables leaving this Aust pylon run for one mile to a similar pylon at Beachley]]\nThe longest powerline river crossing in the UK is the Aust Severn Powerline Crossing over the River Severn at Aust, stretching 1700 m (5,310&nbsp;ft) between towers 148&nbsp;m (488&nbsp;ft) high. The line was commissioned in 1959 and comprises two 275 kV electricity circuits forming part of the line between Iron Acton and Whitson substations. This pylon crossing is paralleled by the Severn-Wye Cable Tunnel beneath it, at almost the same location.\nList of overhead powerlines\nThis is an incomplete list of overhead powerline river crossings in the UK.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Overhead powerline river crossings in the UK\n!River\n!Location\n!Span (m)\n!Height of towers (m)\n!Clearance (m)\n!Notes\n!References\n|-\n|Blyth\n|Blyth, Northumberland\n|389 (275 kV), 352 (66 kV)\n|\n|\n|1 × double 275 kV, 1 × single 275 kV, 1 × double 66 kV, 1 × single 66 kV, 1 × single ? kV\n|\n|-\n|Cleddau Ddu\n|Burton, Pembrokeshire\n|583\n|\n|\n|1 × single 132 kV\n|\n|-\n|Forth\n|Alloa, Clackmannanshire\n|425, 462\n|\n|\n|2 × single 275 kV\n|\n|-\n|Forth\n|Kincardine Bridge, Clackmannanshire\n|1,130\n|137 & 154\n|\n|1 × single 275 kV, see 275 kV Forth Crossing\n|\n|-\n|Loughor\n|Bryn, Carmarthenshire and Swansea\n|406 (upper crossing), 377 (lower)\n|\n|\n|1 × single 132 kV, 1 × single 132 kV\n|\n|-\n|Mersey\n|Fiddlers Ferry, Warrington\n|250\n|\n|\n|1 × single 275 kV\n|\n|-\n|Ness\n|Inverness, Highland\n|\n|\n|\n|1 × double 275 kV, 1 × double 132 kV,\n1 × double 132 kV, 1 × double 33 kV\n|\n|-\n|Orwell\n|Cliff Quay, Suffolk\n|417 (upper), 444 (lower)\n|\n|45\n|2 × triple 132 kV (unusual triple circuit on each crossing)\n|\n|-\n|Ouse\n|Blacktoft, East Riding of Yorkshire\n|528\n|\n|\n|2 × double 400 kV\n|\n|-\n|Ribble\n|Preston, Lancashire\n|222\n|\n|\n|1 × double 400 kV, 1 × single 400 kV, 2 × double 132 kV, 1 × double 33 kV\n|\n|-\n|Severn\n|Arlingham, Gloucestershire\n|639 + 639\n|\n|\n|2 × single 132 kV (crosses river twice)\n|\n|-\n|Severn\n|Aust, Gloucestershire\n|1,700\n|148\n|\n|1 × double 275 kV, commissioned in 1959, see Aust Severn Powerline Crossing\n|\n|-\n|Soar\n|City of Leicester\n|265\n|\n|\n|3 × double 132 kV\n|\n|-\n|Tamar & Tavy\n|Weir Quay & Carr Green, Devon and Cornwall\n|553 (400 kV), 635 (132 kV)\n|\n|\n|1 × single 400 kV, 1 × double 132 kV\n|\n|-\n|Tay & Earn\n|Easter Rhynd, Perth and Kinross\n|425, 380\n|\n|\n|1 × single 275 kV, 1 × single 132 kV\n|\n|-\n|Tees\n|Teesport, Stockton on Tees\n|542\n|\n|\n|1 × single 400 kV\n|\n|-\n|Thames\n|Thurrock, Essex and Littlebrook, Kent\n|1,300\n|190\n|76\n|2 × double 400 kV.

This runs parallel to the Severn overhead pylon crossing (see above), and was commissioned in 1972.\nIncidents\nThe 430-ft high 275kV Tyne Crossing collapsed on 16 February 1962, on the same day there was the British highest wind speed of 177mph on Lowther Hill in south-west Scotland.\nThe pylon at Jarrow crashed at 4am, and the pylon at East Howdon crashed at 5.20am. The Jarrow pylon crashed onto oil pipes of the neighbouring Shell oil terminal. The North Eastern Electricity Board had planned a transmission line from Blyth to Teesside in 1958; Jarrow Borough Council wanted the cables to go underground.\nIt was part of the 50-mile Blyth to Lackenby 275kV line. The transmission line was built around December 1961. The crossing was rebuilt from 4 November 1962.\nReferences\n*"
