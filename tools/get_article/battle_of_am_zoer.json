Sudanese forces were reported to have attacked Chadian positions on the border in previous days and the rebels had been seen passing through several eastern villages.  The Chadian army engaged the rebels near the town of Am Zoer and routed them killing over 150 and capturing 20.  Dozens of military vehicles were also recovered and three government soldiers died.\nSources\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20110520141838/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hGXCr7VUY5_C4yMSEujqcTZw4lyg\n\n---\n\n## Battle of am zoer\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Am Zoer"
