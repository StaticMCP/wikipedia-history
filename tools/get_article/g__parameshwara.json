Parameshwara introduced the Karnataka Police (Amendment) Bill, 2024, which amends the Karnataka Police Act to extend the minimum tenure for police officers in operational roles from one year to two years. This amendment aims to enhance the effectiveness of policing and reduce corruption related to postings. The new rule applies to officers holding the ranks of Additional Director-General of Police on field duty, Inspector General of Police, Superintendents of Police in charge of districts, Additional Superintendents of Police on operational duties, and Circle Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors in charge of police stations. The one-year tenure had previously been a hindrance, especially for officers at the Inspector level, as frequent transfers prevented them from becoming familiar with their jurisdictions, thereby impacting the efficiency of law enforcement, crime detection, and intelligence gathering. However, some officers, particularly in Bengaluru, managed to stay in preferred postings for extended periods, which could lead to the development of vested interests. The amendment aims to strike a balance by providing stability for officers while ensuring that they gain experience in both urban and rural areas. The government is also tasked with addressing the issue of officers who have remained in specific posts for too long, despite the political influence they may wield.\nControversial statements\nHe faced criticism after making a controversial remark about a Bengaluru woman's harassment case, saying, 'Incidents like these tend to happen here and there in a big city like this.' However, he later apologized for his statement.\nPositions in political party\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! # !! From !! To !!
