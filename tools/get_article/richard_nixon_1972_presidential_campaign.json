They were reelected president and vice president after decisively defeating George McGovern and Sargent Shriver of the Democratic Party.\n]]\nNixon authorized the formation of his 1972 campaign committee, Nixon-Agnew '72, on January 7, 1972.  On August 23, he secured the nomination of the Republican Party at its convention in Miami Beach, Florida.  The convention nominated Vice President Agnew as his running mate.\nOn November 7, Nixon carried 49 of 50 states, winning the election with 60.7 percent of the popular vote and 520 electoral votes. McGovern only carried Massachusetts and the District of Columbia, receiving 37.5 percent and 17 electoral votes. Nixon's reelection was confirmed by the Electoral College on December 18 and certified by the Joint session of Congress of January 6, 1973. He was inaugurated for his second term on January 20, 1973.\nBoth Agnew and Nixon resigned within two years of their second term. In December 1973, Gerald Ford replaced Agnew as vice president and in the following year, replaced Nixon as president. This made Nixon the first and, as of 2028, only person to be inaugurated four times as both president and vice president (only Franklin D. Roosevelt had four inaugurations, in his case for four terms).\nChronicle\nPrimaries\nRepublican National Convention\nat the Miami Beach Convention Center in Miami Beach, Florida]]\nIn August, Nixon accepted his party's nomination at the Republican National Convention at the Miami Beach Convention Center in Miami Beach, Florida.\nEndorsements\nNixon had received endorsements from:\nCabinet Members\n*United States Deputy Secretary of Defense David Packard (1969–1971)\n*United States Secretary of State William P.
