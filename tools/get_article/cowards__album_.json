It was released by Warp Records on 7 February 2025, and was met with widespread acclaim by music critics.\nBackground\nCowards was recorded after the completion but before the release of the band's second album, O Monolith, with recording finishing on 9 June 2023. It was inspired by traveling to different countries and reading books about the countries to create what lead singer and drummer Ollie Judge described as a \"book of dark fairy tales.\" Some of these books included Agustina Bazterrica's Tender Is the Flesh and Ryū Murakami's In the Miso Soup.\nThe lyrics touch on a variety of topics within the overall topic of \"evil itself\", with \"Crispy Skin\" being about cannibalism and \"Blood on the Boulders\" about the Manson murders.\nComposition\nCowards has been described as both post-rock and art rock, with influences from a diverse set of other genres, including electronica, folk music, and psych rock. The album was seen as a continuation of the band's distancing from their earlier post-punk sound. Writing for The Quietus, Cal Cashin described Cowards as \"A Pet Sounds, except all of the pets are scorpions, and tarantulas, and maybe some stick insects too\".\n| rev1 = AllMusic\n| rev1score =\n| rev2 = Clash\n| rev2score = 8/10\n| rev3 = DIY\n| rev3score =\n| rev4 = The Line of Best Fit\n| rev4score = 8/10\n| rev5 = MusicOMH\n| rev5score =\n| rev6 = NME\n| rev6score =\n| rev7 = Paste\n| rev7score = 8.2/10\n| rev8 = Pitchfork\n| rev8score = 7.6/10\n| rev9 = The Skinny\n| rev9score =\n| rev10 = Under the Radar\n| rev10score = 9/10\n| MC = 85/100\n}}\nCowards was released by Warp Records on 7 February 2025.
