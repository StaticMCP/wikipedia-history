It was subsequently sold to John Entwistle and the house remains the residence of the Entwistle family. A pedigree scroll of the Howarth family compiled by Sir William Dugdale, states in a margin note that under the courtyard windows of the original house the Latin phrase 'Oremus pro bono Roberti Howarth statu fundatoris' ('Let us pray for the well-being of Robert Howarth, the founder') was carved. The Robert Howarth referred to died in 1611.\nArchitecture\nThe Elizabethan manor house was demolished in the early 19th&nbsp;century. The current house dates largely from the early 19th&nbsp;century. It preserves nine original sash windows, and a tunnel vaulted cellar with stone mullioned window which probably dates from the earlier building of the 17th&nbsp;century.\nSee also\n*Listed buildings in Wardle, Greater Manchester\n*Howorth, surname\nReferences"
