Based in Kenosha, Wisconsin, the Kingfish play their home games at Simmons Field.\nHistory\nKenosha has been the home of multiple minor league baseball teams (Kenosha Twins, Kenosha Mammoths, Kenosha Kroakers) prior to the establishment of the Kingfish franchise in 2013. Fans submitted suggestions for the team's name, and the winning suggestion of 'Kingfish' was revealed at the team's launch party on November 23, 2013.\nSeason summaries\n2014 (Inaugural Season)\nThe Kingfish opened the 2014 season on the road, and played their first home series at the newly renovated Simmons Field on the weekend of May 31 and June 1. They finished the 2014 season with a 41–30 record in the Northwoods League South Division, narrowly missing the playoffs by half a game.\n2015\nThe Kingfish finished 2015 with a regular season record of 48–24. After beating the La Crosse Loggers 7–2 in Game 1 of the Divisional Playoffs and the Madison Mallards 2–1 in a close Game 2, the Kingfish defeated the St. Cloud Rox, in 2 games, to win their first Northwoods League Summer Collegiate World Series.\n2016 (All Star Weekend)\nThe Kingfish sat at the bottom of their division for most of the season, finishing 26–46 and 9th (out of 9) in the South Division. The Kingfish also held the 2016 NWL All Star Game with the home run derby being on the Kenosha Harbor, leading to Lake Michigan. 2016 was also the Kingfish's highest attendance in a season.\n2017\nKenosha started the year as one of the best teams in the Northwoods League South Division accumulating a 28–17 record. But an 8–19 finish to the year had Kenosha with a 36–36 record by the end of the season. They were eliminated from playoff contention following game #71.\n2018\nThe Kingfish finished 2018 with a regular season record of 41–31. They made the postseason for the second time in team history, thanks to a 28–10 second half record. However, they were eliminated in Game 1 of the Divisional Playoffs by the Kalamazoo Growlers.\n2020 (Battle of Kenosha)\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Northwoods League created several hyper-regional \"pod\" divisions, many of which included new alternate identities of existing teams. The K-Town Bobbers joined the Kingfish in the Kenosha Divsion, with all games being played at Simmons Field. The Bobbers were not a new NWL franchise but rather a one-year alternate identity managed by the Kingfish. The season culminated in a victory by Kingfish in the \"Battle of Kenosha.\"\n2023 (10 Seasons)\nThis season was the Kingfish's 10th season in the Northwoods League and the first year the Northwoods League started using MLB's pitch clock rule, to speed up the pace of the game.  Kenosha started the year accumulating a 17–16 record. But a 14–25 finish to the year had Kenosha with a 31–41 record by the end of the season. They were eliminated from playoff contention following game #71.\n2024\nSimmons Field got a massive renovation, adding a turf playing surface, and a new scoreboard. The Kingfish started the first half of the season with a 16–20 record, second to last in the division. But a 15–21 finish to the year had Kenosha with a 31–41 record by the end of the season. They were eliminated from playoff contention.\nAlternate Identities\nThe Kingfish have adopted numerous Identities over the years. Here are the ones they used.\nKenosha Kickers\nThe Kingfish hosted a Home Alone night, which they rebranded to the Kenosha Kickers, a scene from the movie, that included a jersey auction after the game.\nKenosha Twins\nThe Kenosha Twins were a Minor League Baseball team that played in Kenosha, from 1984 to 1992. They began playing in the Midwest League in 1984. The team played their home games at Simmons Field. The Twins won two championships, in 1985 and 1987, and were Northern Division champions for the first half of the 1988 season. In 2024, the Kingfish honored the 40th anniversary of the team moving to Kenosha with a jersey auction at the end of the game.\nKenosha Comets\nThe Kenosha Comets were a women's professional baseball team that played from 1943 through 1951 in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. They played their home games at Simmons Field. In 2023, they rebranded as the Comets wearing green jerseys with a white K in the middle and in the hats, a white K, for Kenosha.\nMascot\nKing Elvis the First, an orange fish, is the mascot of the Kingfish. Before home games, he rides an ATV from the left field foul pole. He used to ride a zipline down the left field foul pole to deliver the ball for the first pitch. In 2022, Green Bay Packers player A. J. Dillon went viral  for doing an oklahoma drill, knocking out Elvis’ head.\nAlumni in MLB\nThe following is a list of Kingfish and Bobbers players who have gone on to play in Major League Baseball.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
