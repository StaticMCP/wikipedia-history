The NSHR, based in Yonkers, New York, aimed to create an institute to support Pan-African—African, West Indian and Afro-American—scholarly efforts. Schomburg stated \"We need a collection or list of books written by our own men and women.... We need the historian and philosopher to give us, with trenchant pen, the story of our forefathers and let our soul and body, with phosphorescent light, brighten the chasm that separates us.\"\nThe NSHR's constitution listed its purpose \"to instruct the race and to inspire love and veneration for its men and women of mark.\" Membership in the society was limited to twenty active members and they started with a collection of 150 titles. Members endeavored to gather books, pamphlets and other manuscripts by writers of color worldwide. Meetings took place in members' homes and would often involve prominent black speakers.\nAlain LeRoy Locke spoke at their first annual meeting and became a Corresponding Member for the society which partially sponsored his trip to Egypt in 1924. They shared many members and goals with the American Negro Academy and the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League. The society's collection became a lending library that operated out of Schomburg's apartment, available to members and \"anyone else interested in black history.\"\nWhen the organization disbanded, the  collection later became the foundation for NYPL's Schomburg Collection of Negro Literature and Art which became the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem.\nSee also\n*Association for the Study of African American Life and History\nReferences"
