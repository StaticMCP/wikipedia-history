Some sources give the date as 1386, others as 1370.\nBackground\nDuring the chiefship of Lachlan Mackintosh, 8th chief of Clan Mackintosh, a feud had raged for some years with the Clan Cameron, apparently over the disputed lands of Glenlui and Loch Arkaig. Each side had raided each other's lands, lifting property.\nBattle\nIn 1370, it is recorded in the Mackintosh MSS (manuscript), that around 400 Camerons made a raid into Badenoch and when they were returning home with their captured booty they were overtaken at Invernahavon by the Clan Chattan who were led in person by the Mackintosh chief.\nIn the first engagement, Mackintosh was defeated by the Camerons despite having a numerically superior force. This was apparently because there had been a dispute among the Clan Chattan between the Macphersons and Davidsons over who should have command of the right wing of their force, which was the post of honour. The Mackintosh chief favoured the Davidsons and as a result the Macphersons withdrew in disgust. Thus with the loss of the Macphersons, Mackintosh's force together with the Davidsons was numerically inferior and was totally defeated by the Camerons.\nHowever, soon after the Macphersons rejoined the battle and attacked the Camerons turning their victory into a defeat. The Camerons then retreated towards the Pass of Drumochter, skirting the end of Loch Ericht then turning westwards towards the River Treig. In the author's introduction to the Lochiel Memoirs published in 1842, it is stated that the Mackintosh chief had sent a man to taunt the Macphersons as cowards for not fighting the Camerons which subsequently coerced them back into the battle. According to Lachlan Shaw, the leader of the Camerons was one Charles Macgilony who was killed in the battle. However, Alexander Mackintosh-Shaw states that this is contrary to the tradition of the locality that the chief of the Camerons, Dhomhnuil Duibhe, commanded in person.\nAftermath\nAccording to Lachlan Shaw the Battle of Invernahavon gave occasion to the Battle of the North Inch in Perth in 1396 that was also fought between the Clan Chattan and Clan Cameron. Alexander Mackintosh-Shaw also stated that it is highly likely that the combat at Perth had some connection with that at Invernahavon.\nReferences"
