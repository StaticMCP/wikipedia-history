It returned one Member of Parliament (MP)  to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom  from 1950 – 1983.   In the eight elections during its 33-year lifetime it was held by three Conservatives successively.\nHistory\nThe seat was created by the Representation of the People Act 1948 and first contested at the 1950 general election. It was abolished prior to the 1983 general election.\nBoundaries\nThe Urban District of Dorking, the Rural District of Dorking and Horley, and in the Rural District of Guildford the parishes of Albury, East Clandon, East Horsley, Effingham, Ockham, Ripley, St Martha, Send, Shere, West Clandon, West Horsley, and Winsley.\nIn 1983 parliamentary boundaries were realigned to those of the local government districts created in 1974: the town of Dorking became part of Mole Valley district, and just over half of the previous area was transferred to the Mole Valley seat for national elections which took in territory to the north from elsewhere. Horley transferred to the redrawn Reigate seat.\nMembers of Parliament\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member!!Party\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n|| 1950 || Sir Gordon Touche || Conservative\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n|| 1964 || Sir George Sinclair || Conservative\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n|| 1979 || Keith Wickenden || Conservative\n|-\n| ||1983||colspan=2|constituency abolished\n|}\nElections\nElections in the 1950s\nElections in the 1960s\nElections in the 1970s\nReferences\n*"
