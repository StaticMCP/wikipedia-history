A Mountain Rush Post Office opened on 7 May 1862, but closed in January 1863 as the miners moved to other locations.\nKinglake township was established much later and was named after British historian Alexander William Kinglake, whose eight-volume history of the Crimean War had recently been completed.\nKinglake Post Office opened on 14 May 1883. There was also an office at Kinglake East open from 1914 until 1950.\nPopulation\nIn the 2021 Census, there were 1662 people in Kinglake. 82.9% of people were born in Australia and 90% of people spoke only English at home.

There were several bushfires at the end of January 2006, into early February 2006, when fires burnt out over . The CFA, DSE Victoria and NSW firefighters managed to bring the fire to a halt. Fires also occurred in the 1982–1983 season and during the 1960s. The major fires of 1939 also placed the community at risk with a major ignition point being nearby. In 1926 major fires in the area caused significant losses; the Post Office being the only building left standing.\n2009 bushfire\nKinglake was one of the main affected towns in the Black Saturday bushfires, with 38 people confirmed dead in Kinglake and Kinglake West, and more than 500 homes destroyed. Local resident and former GTV-9 newsreader Brian Naylor and his wife Moiree were confirmed to be amongst the dead. Not long after news reports had stated that the fire went through the whole town, Deputy Police Commissioner of Victoria Kieran Walshe revealed that six of the victims had been in the same car.\nThe cause of the Kilmore East-Kinglake bushfire was found by the 2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission to be an ageing power line owned by SP AusNet, an energy distribution company. In December 2014 Victoria's Supreme Court approved an  settlement of a legal class action against SP AusNet, and Utility Services Group. It has been noted as being \"the biggest class action settlement in Australian legal history\". The previous highest payout was $200 Million in Kirby v Centro Properties Limited (No 6) [2012] FCA 650 (19 June 2012).\nBooks on Kinglake\nStewart, Kath and Hawkins, Deidre Living with Fire: A brief history of fires in the Kinglake Ranges, Kinglake, Vic.
