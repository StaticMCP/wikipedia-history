She was previously Professor of Public Engagement and Genetics at the University of Leicester. In 2012, King led the DNA verification during the exhumation and reburial of Richard III of England. Alongside being an academic, she is also known as a broadcaster, featuring with Stacey Dooley on the BBC Two genealogy series, DNA Family Secrets, presenting Ancient Murders Unearthed for Sky History and hosting the podcast Head Number 7 for Wondery.\nEarly life and education\nKing was born in Nottingham, England, as the eldest of three children born to Alan King, an engineer, and Daphne King, a housewife. King is named after Norwegian aviator Turi Widerøe, the first woman to fly for a Western airline.\nShe moved to Canada at an early age and was brought up in Vancouver, British Columbia. She studied at the University of British Columbia and worked on archaeological sites in Canada, Greece, and England, before moving to Jesus College, Cambridge to read Archaeology and Anthropology. There she was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree. She won a scholarship to study for a Master of Science degree in Molecular Genetics at the University of Leicester, gaining a First with Distinction.\nIn 2000, she started her doctoral research as a Wellcome Trust Prize Student at the University of Leicester, specialising in genetic genealogy and \"in tracing migration patterns by using genetics.\" Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys, the inventor of DNA fingerprinting, was on her PhD supervisory panel.\nHer thesis on the relationship between British surnames and Y-chromosomal haplotypes was published in 2007, and eventually formed the basis of the book Surnames, DNA and Family History, which she co-authored with David Hey and George Redmonds.\nCareer and research\nKing's research initially centered around genetics, genetic genealogy, forensics, and surnames, and using aspects of human DNA such as the Y chromosome to track past human migrations. Her work has included tracing \"the signal of the Viking migration to the north of England\", resulting in her appearance in Michael Wood's ''The Great British Story – A People's History on BBC Two, and in Michael Wood's Story of England''.\nIn 2012, she led the genetic analysis and verification during the exhumation and reburial of Richard III of England. She was able to use the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from direct living descendants of Richard III's sister, Anne of York, one of whom (Michael Ibsen) was traced by British historian John Ashdown-Hill, with a second relative (Wendy Duldig) traced by the University of Leicester team.\nIn March 2021, she presented the BBC Radio 4 documentary \"Genetics and the longer arm of the law\".\nIn 2025, blood from the sofa in Hitler's study was used by her for genetic testing. The blood was confirmed to be Hitler's by comparing it to that of a relative. Analysis of the genetic material revealed that he likely suffered from Kallmann syndrome, a genetic disorder that prevents a person from starting or fully completing puberty. Many males with the syndrome have an undescended testicle and 10 percent have a micropenis; most have low testosterone levels. Kallmann syndrome has the additional symptom of a total lack of sense of smell or a reduced sense of smell, among other symptoms.\nPublic speaking and consultancy\nAs Professor of Public Engagement, King regularly undertakes public speaking at universities, schools and public events such as the Cheltenham Science Festival, the Moscow Science Festival, a Congressional Breakfast on Capitol Hill, the Galway Science and Technology Festival, and the Queen's Lecture in Berlin. She guest-presented the Royal Institution's Christmas Lectures in Japan in 2019 stepping in for Alice Roberts.\nShe advises on numerous television programmes and provides genetic expertise to authors such as Patricia Cornwell, Philippe Sands, Edward Glover, and David McKie.\nKing has also appeared in a number of television and radio documentaries as an expert in genetic genealogy, forensics, and/or ancient DNA.\nCurrent research\nThe following is a list of projects King is either heading or has been involved with:\n* The King's DNA: whole genome sequencing of Richard III\n* What's in a Name? Applying Patrilineal Surnames to Forensics, Population History, and Genetic Epidemiology\n* HALOGEN (History, Archaeology, Linguistics, Onomastics, and GENetics)\n* The Irish Surnames Project\n* The Mary Jane Kelly Project, dedicated to confirming the identity of Jack the Ripper's final confirmed victim.\nTV, video and radio appearances\nKing has appeared in numerous television and radio documentaries, programmes and videos as well as advising on television and radio productions such as BBC's Who Do You Think You Are?\n* Presented the series Ancient Murders Unearthed for Sky History.\n* Presented the BBC Radio 4 documentary: Genetics and the longer arm of the law\n* Guest on The Life Scientific as DNA Detective Turi King\n* ''Britain's Lost Battlefields with Rob Bell\n* Richard III: The King in the Car Park\n* Britain's Secret Treasures\n* Richard III: Solving a 500 Year Old Cold Case (TEDx Leicester)\n* Richard III – The DNA Analysis & Conclusion (University of Leicester)\n* Richard III: The Resolution of A 500-Year-Old Cold Case (Irving K. Barber Learning Centre Lecture, UBC)\n* Head Number 7 for Wondery\nDNA Family Secrets\nDNA Family Secrets'' is a television series which began airing on BBC Two in March 2021, presented by Stacey Dooley and King, it uses current DNA technology to solve family mysteries around ancestry, missing relatives and genetic disease. Series three aired in 2023.\nAwards and honours\nIn 2016, King was appointed an honorary fellow of the British Science Association in recognition of her contribution to public engagement in science. She gave the J. B. S. Haldane prize lecture of The Genetics Society in 2018, at the Royal Institution, London. She was the president of the Adelphi Genetics Forum, formerly the Galton Institute, from 2020 to 2022.\nPersonal life\nKing is married.\nSee also\n* Timeline of women in science\nExternal links\n*\nReferences\nSelected bibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* |pages=165–78 |title=In Search of Vikings: Interdisciplinary Approaches to Scandinavian Heritage of North-West England |publisher=CRC Press |editor1-first=Stephen E. |editor1-last=Harding |editor2-first=David |editor2-last=Griffiths |editor3-first=Elizabeth |editor3-last=Royles |isbn=978-1-4822-0759-0 }}"
