The organization directs the museum and archives at the Hjemkomst Center and provides tours of Moorhead's Hjemkomst Viking Ship and Moorhead Stave Church.\nHistory\nThe organization formed in 1932 as the Clay County Historical Society. They adopted the current name in 2009 when the organization merged with the Heritage Hjemkomst Interpretive Center.\nHjemkomst Center\nThe Heritage Hjemkomst Interpretive Center, commonly known as the Hjemkomst Center, opened its doors in 1985. The building features a distinctive ship sail roof design. Its primary purpose centered on showcasing the Hjemkomst Viking Ship and its historic voyage. Over time, the center expanded its focus to encompass broader aspects of Clay County's history and culture.\nA significant milestone occurred in 2009 when the Heritage Hjemkomst Interpretive Center merged with the Clay County Historical Society, forming the Historical and Cultural Society of Clay County. This merger expanded the center's role in preserving and interpreting the region's history. The Center houses the Historical and Cultural Society of Clay County administration and collections.\nHjemkomst Viking Ship\nThe Hjemkomst Viking Ship stands as a replica of the Gokstad burial ship. Local resident Robert Asp conceived the idea to build and sail a Viking ship to Norway. The ship's journey serves as the subject of an award-winning documentary.\nConstruction of the Hjemkomst began in 1974 and spanned several years. The ship's maiden voyage took place in 1980, though Asp died before realizing his dream of sailing to Norway. His family and friends continued his vision, and in 1982, the Hjemkomst successfully completed its transatlantic journey.\nHjemkomst Viking Ship Gallery\nHjemkomst is a replica Viking ship that was sailed from Duluth, Minnesota to Bergen, Norway in 1982.jpg|Hjemkomst is a replica Viking ship\nHjemkomst, which means \"Homecoming\" in Norwegian, is a replica Viking ship.jpg|Hjemkomst, which means \"Homecoming\" in Norwegian\nReplica Viking Ship, Hjemkomst Center, Moorhead, Minnesota - 42149286830.jpg|Shields on side of ship\nSV Hjemkomst 2022-07-21 01.jpg|Full view of ship\nHopperstad Stave Church Replica\nSource:\nThe Hopperstad Stave Church Replica stands as a full-scale replica of the original Hopperstad Stave Church located in Vik, Norway.

The house remains on its original frontier location and stands as the oldest house in Moorhead. Dewey Bergquist, John Bergquist's grandson, repurchased his grandfather's home in 1978. A longtime local television weatherman, Bergquist restored the cabin to its 1870s condition. In 1989, Bergquist donated the cabin to the Clay County Historical Society for preservation. The home holds a place on the National Register of Historic Places.\nComstock House\nSolomon Comstock constructed the Comstock House between 1882 and 1883 in a blend of Queen Anne and Eastlake styles. A prominent figure in Moorhead's early development, Comstock held influential roles in business, politics, and civic affairs.

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.\nExhibits and Programming\nThe Historical and Cultural Society of Clay County presents a range of exhibits focusing on local, regional, and national history.
