Captaining the side was Queensland back rower Paul Vautin. The club competed in the New South Wales Rugby League's 1987 Premiership season and played its home games at the 27,000 capacity Brookvale Oval.\nLadder\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

hemmed in on their own side of half-way with his astute kicking. Lyons stepped inside the Raiders' defence and after a seventy-metre burst found Noel Cleal stampeding on to the ball but Cleal's final pass to Des Hasler was ruled forward. Another promising Manly raid broke down after Lyons had initially dummied to O'Connor, then proceeded to run around Peter Jackson and head 30 metres downfield. It all came to naught however when Lyons' reverse pass to O'Connor was put to ground after O'Connor had thought Lyons would dummy to him again, with Lyons actually having what TV replays showed to be an unimpeded run to the try line had he looked ahead and not tried to pass.\nManly continued to put pressure on the Raiders defence with both speedsters Michael O'Connor and Dale Shearer trying to catch the Raiders out with long range kicks to their in-goal area in front of the SCG hill, but both were only just beaten to the ball each time by Gary Belcher and Gary Coyne respectively.\nIn the 27th minute Lyons eventually broke through on his third threatening attempt. Scurrying from a scrum win on the Canberra quarter-line, Lyons brushed off the tackle of Chris O'Sullivan and stepped inside Belcher to score.\nThe Sea Eagles led 6–0 at half-time though it could have been much greater had they taken advantage of the opportunities Cliff Lyons had been creating. Other than the Lyons try, the closest Manly actually got to scoring again in the first half ended with a ball-and-all tackle by Belcher on Dale Shearer just two metres from the Canberra try line. For their part, Canberra rarely threatened the Manly line with a midfield break by Mal Meninga stopped by a good Des Hasler tackle, while Shearer repaid his opposite when he took down Belcher who had taken an inside pass from a Peter Jackson break.\nFrom the second half restart kick-off, Belcher fielded the ball in his in-goal but was penalised for shepherding behind Chris O'Sullivan as he ran the ball out. It was a gift penalty for O'Connor to take Manly out to an 8–0 lead.\nThe Sea Eagles kept the pressure on Canberra by charging down two attempted clearing kicks by a tiring Mal Meninga. Only occasionally did the Raiders break through. After a run by Peter Jackson, Manly's Phil Daley was penalised for a high tackle and Meninga's goal finally put Canberra on the scoreboard.\nFatigue and the heat began to take a toll on the players, though one of the more surprising efforts was Manly's English prop Kevin Ward who ran and tackled strongly all day. Meninga, who had only played 60 minutes of football since breaking his arm in a game against Manly almost two months earlier, was replaced by Kevin Walters after 15 minutes of the second half and Manly's Gibbs, Cleal and Cochrane all went down hurt at different stages as the pace of the match slowed (for his part, Cochrane still can not remember the second half). Soon after a successful penalty goal from O'Connor, a Dale Shearer cross field kick from the Raiders 22m line was grounded over the line by O'Connor in the Paddington corner. While Manly winger David Ronson was thought to be offside (though he did not get involved in the play, he was still within 10 metres of O'Connor), many claim that the Manly centre should have been ruled offside as he got the ball \"rather quickly\" (Ch.10's television replays would prove inconclusive, however a wider shot shown on the ABC showed that O'Connor was actually onside). However, what counted was that referee Mick Stone ruled that Manly's international centre was onside and O'Connor was awarded the try. He converted his own try (giving him 4/4 goals at that point) and Manly had a premiership winning 16–2 lead.\nA brief hope of a fightback loomed after an ingeniously constructed \"trojan horse\" move by Canberra. Chris O'Sullivan went down \"injured\" after being tackled and then miraculously popped up in the next passage of play to take the inside pass from Ivan Henjak and score. With Meninga off the ground, Gary Belcher converted to narrow the scores to 16–8.\nRon Gibbs' return from the head-bin helped snap the Sea Eagles out of their complacency. Daley's tackle on Canberra replacement Terry Regan and Dale Shearer's try-saving tackle on Ashley Gilbert three minutes from full-time ended any chance of a Canberra fightback. Paul Vautin led the charge back up-field with Hasler being bundled into the corner post after a run-around movement with O'Connor. The Manly centre also had a try taken off him just minutes after his previous try when Mick Stone ruled a pass from Cliff Lyons had gone forward.\nRight on full-time, O'Connor landed his fifth goal from five attempts after the Raiders were penalised in front of their own posts for being offside after a tap-kick restart. The 18–8 scoreline was a fair indication of Manly's supremacy on the day and a just result considering the Sea Eagles' consistency throughout the year.\nManly became the first team other than Canterbury-Bankstown or Parramatta to win the grand final during the 1980s (Manly had been beaten grand finalists in 1982 and 1983, losing both times to Parramatta).\nManly centre Darrell Williams became the first ever New Zealander to win the Sydney Premiership, while Paul Vautin became the first, and so far only Queenslander to captain the Sea Eagles to a winning Grand Final.\nFor Manly coach Bob Fulton, premiership glory in a nine-year coaching career was finally achieved. For the dual Canberra coaches it marked a milestone. It was a sad ending to the long club coaching career of Don Furner, the man who brought Canberra into the competition in 1982. Furner, a 1956–57 Kangaroo tourist, had been coaching in the Sydney Premiership since taking over as Easts coach in 1970 (losing the 1972 Grand Final to Manly), and along the way had also coached the undefeated 1986 Kangaroo Tour squad known as \"The Unbeatables\". For his partner, Queensland's Wayne Bennett, the tactician behind the side, it was a disappointing exit but another door was about to open on his own stellar coaching career with the Brisbane Broncos and a continuing career as Queensland Origin coach.\n1987 World Club Challenge\n1987 saw the second World Club Challenge game between the reigning New South Wales Rugby League premiers and the reigning Rugby Football League (England) champions. This game was held in England less than two weeks following the 1987 NSWRL grand final.\nThe match was played at 7:45pm on a dry Wednesday night, 7 October at the Central Park ground in Wigan. A crowd of 36,895 was in attendance for the game, though unofficial estimates from those present put the attendance as high as 50,000. The game was refereed by RFL international referee John Holdsworth. Former four-time Manly premiership winning  Graham Eadie, who at the time was playing in England with 1987 Challenge Cup winners Halifax, was on hand as a match commentator as was dual Manly premiership player (and captain of the 1978 team) and the skipper of the 1982 Invincibles, Max Krilich.\n| team2      =  Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles\n| score      = 8 – 2\n| report     =\n| points1    = Tries:   Goals:  David Stephenson (4)\n| points2    = Tries:   Goals:  Michael O'Connor (1)\n| date       = Wednesday, 7 October\n| stadium    = Central Park, Wigan\n| attendance = 36,895\n| referee    = John Holdsworth\n| manofmatch = Shaun Wane\n}}\n{| width=92%\n|-\n|\n|\n|}\n{| width=\"100%\"\n|valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n{| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n!width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"|\n|-\n|FB ||1||Steve Hampson\n|-\n|RW ||2||Richard Russell\n|-\n|CE ||3||Darrell Williams\n|-\n|CE ||4||Joe Lydon\n|-\n|LW ||5||Henderson Gill\n|-\n|SO ||6||Shaun Edwards\n|-\n|SH ||7||Andy Gregory\n|-\n|PR ||8||Brian Case\n|-\n|HK ||9||Nicky Kiss\n|-\n|PR ||10||Shaun Wane\n|-\n|SR ||11||Andy Goodway\n|-\n|SR ||12||Ian Potter\n|-\n|LF ||13||Ellery Hanley (c)\n|-\n|colspan=3|Substitutions:\n|-\n|IC ||14||Ged Byrne\n|-\n|IC ||15||Graeme West\n|-\n|IC ||16||Ian Gildart\n|-\n|IC ||17||Ian Lucas\n|-\n|colspan=3|Coach:\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\"| Graham Lowe\n|}\n|valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n{| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n!width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"|\n|-\n|FB ||1||Dale Shearer\n|-\n|RW ||2||David Ronson\n|-\n|CE ||3||Darrell Williams\n|-\n|CE ||4||Michael O'Connor\n|-\n|LW ||5||Stuart Davis\n|-\n|FE ||6||Cliff Lyons\n|-\n|HB ||7||Des Hasler\n|-\n|LK ||8||Paul Vautin (c)\n|-\n|SR ||9||Owen Cunningham\n|-\n|SR ||10||Ron Gibbs\n|-\n|PR ||11||Ian Gately\n|-\n|HK ||12||Mal Cochrane\n|-\n|PR ||13||Phil Daley\n|-\n|colspan=3|Substitutions:\n|-\n|IC ||14||Mark Brokenshire\n|-\n|IC ||15||Jeremy Ticehurst\n|-\n|IC ||16||Mark Pocock\n|-\n|IC ||17||Paul Shaw\n|-\n|colspan=3|Coach:\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\"| Bob Fulton\n|}\n|}\nNo tries were scored in what was a closely fought and, at times, spiteful encounter. Michael O'Connor opened the scoring for Manly with a successful penalty kick in only the second minute, which would turn out to be the only time the Sea Eagles scored. Tempers flared as the match went on, punctuated by more penalties and a few unsavoury incidents:\n*Manly forward Ron Gibbs became the first person to be sent off in a World Club Challenge match for illegal use of the elbow when taking out Joe Lydon high after he attempted a drop-goal;\n*An all-in brawl erupted after Dale Shearer was lifted in a tackle then started a punch-up in the ruck with Brian Case;\n*After taking Manly captain Paul Vautin over the touchline, a group of Wigan defenders went on to take him over the fence causing another all-in brawl;\n*Later, when Shearer brought down Lydon in defence, he appeared to step on the Great Britain international's head as he got up after making the tackle.\nAmongst all of these incidents Wigan's David Stephenson kicked four penalty goals, which in the end would prove decisive. The score was 8 - 2 in favour of the home side as the final whistle blew, prompting the overjoyed Wigan supporters to flood onto the field to celebrate with the players.\nIn his biography The Strife and Times of Paul Vautin written by Mike Coleman and released in 1992, the Manly captain told that the Sea Eagles players were so convinced that they would beat Wigan after their grand final win over the Canberra Raiders and after the undefeated 1986 Kangaroo Tour, that they treated the trip to England more as a holiday than anything serious and continued celebrating their GF win while there. Vautin and the other Manly players believe that their poor attitude is what ultimately cost them the game. Wigan on the other hand, led by their Kiwi coach Graham Lowe and featuring 11 Great Britain and one New Zealand international (compared to 5 Australian and one New Zealand international for Manly), took the game very seriously with pride their main motivation after the Great Britain Lions had been humiliated by the Australian's with 4 straight 3-0 Ashes series losses since the disastrous 1979 Australasian tour and the popular belief that the NSWRL Premiership was superior to the RFL's.\nIn a twist, after leading Wigan to numerous cup titles over the next two seasons, Graham Lowe would become Manly's head coach from 1990 to 1992.\nPlayer statistics\nNote: Games and (sub) show total games played, e.g. 1 (1) is 2 games played.
