Though his uncle, Pehelwan Chacha, discourages his dreams, the spirit of his father Changu often appears to tell him to keep dreaming. Mangu's land is ruled by the elite Big Cats who live off the herbivores. Many protests are often held at this by the public, which are futile. While delivering his laundry, Mangu enters the castle and meets the crafty senior adviser, Miss Fitna. Meanwhile, the aging King Badshah Khan informs Fitna that he wishes to forfeit the crown to his incompetent and self absorbed child Shahzada Khan. When Fitna influences the animals against this through propaganda, the King decides on a form of 'democracy', thinking that no one will be able to stand up to Shahzada.\nMiss Fitna and her cohorts vainly look for a suitable candidate. Then Miss Fitna remembers the naive donkey who will be easily influenced. Mangu agrees to the campaign after encouragement from his father. He and Shahzada compete for the crown through many hilarious ways, like press talks and rap battles, while Fitna supports Mangu through influencing the news and reverse psychology. Eventually, Mangu makes an inspirational speech from the bottom of his heart that wins over the animals. The Cats are exiled and Mangu starts to live a life of luxury in the palace and neglects his duties as the leader of the jungle. Meanwhile, Fitna secretly has an agenda of her own. She serves the human ringmaster and kidnaps the animals for his circus. Mangu accidentally stumbles upon their prison. He realizes his mistakes, apologizes to the animals and stops Fitna's party. Fitna falls off the cliff into the sea. The public and the Cats fix their problems and accept Mangu as their King. Meanwhile, Changu's spirit moves on, convinced that his son has achieved his dreams.\nCast\nUrdu version\n* Afzal Khan as Jan Mangu, a washer's donkey who wants to be the king of Azadnagar\n* Hina Dilpazeer as Miss Fitna, a red fox who is personal secretary to the king\n* Ghulam Mohiuddin as Badshah Khan, a lion who is the king of Azadnagar\n* Adeel Hashmi as Shahzada Khan, the son of Badshah Khan\n* Faisal Qureshi as Breaking News Monkey anchor\n* Salman Saqib Sheikh as Rangeela, a chameleon\n* Jawed Sheikh as Changu, Mangu's father\n* Ismail Tara as Pehalwan Chacha, Changu's brother and Subadar a black rhinoceros\n* Shafaat Ali as Ronald Crump, a hippopotamus version of Donald Trump\n* Irfan Khoosat as Jamboora, a chimpanzee who is the media house owner; and Raftaar, a tortoise\n* Shabbir Jan as Sardar Chacha, a grizzly bear politician\n* Sahiba Afzal as Mangu's love interest\n* Ahsan Rahim as Mr. Propaganda, a Siberian tiger\n* Irfan Malik as Panoti, a zebra\n* Ali Hassan as Raja Uncle\n* Zirgham Amir Khan as a Khota\n* TBA as Jake, a Hyena\nEnglish version\n*Kenny Knox as Mangu\n*Mark Dohner as Prince Shazad\n*Bobbi Hartley as Miss Fitna\n*Jay Snyder as Badshah Khan\n*Mike Pollock as Changu\n*Tyler Bunch as Uncle Perry\n*Jason Yudoff as Jambora\n*Steve Tardio as Godzilla\n*Dave Wills as Zandar\n*Billy Bob Thompson as Monkey News Reporter\n*Rory Mac Kaplan as Bad Luck Brian\n*David McDonald as Rapid, Lando\n*Jim O' Brian as Bull Bros\n*Starr Bursby as Rebecca Hippo\nProduction\nIn August 2018, the first look of the animated film was released, directed by Aziz Jindani, developed and produced by Talisman Animation Studios and Geo Films.
