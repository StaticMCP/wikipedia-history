A detachment of the Teutonic Knights, sent from Chojnice (Konitz), clashed with forces of the city of Gdańsk (Danzig), which supported Polish King Kazimierz Jagiellończyk. The Gdańsk troops, taken by surprise by better trained Knights, were defeated. The city itself was not captured, but after this success, the Knights began a campaign in Pomerelia, capturing such towns, as Lębork (Lauenburg), Bytów (Butow), Świecie (Schwetz), Łeba and Puck (Putzig).\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Battle of Pruszcz Gdanski\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Pruszcz Gdański"
