The district comprises most of southern southwest Alberta on the Canada–United States border. It is mostly rural and contains a wide range of topography from Mountains to farmlands, including Waterton Lakes National Park and the Blood Reserve. Cardston-Taber-Warner and its antecedents have a long history that dates back to the old Cardston riding in the North-West Territories.\nThe district has been held by right of center parties since it was created in 1997, and has held the distinction of being one rural riding not continuously held by the Progressive Conservatives in Alberta before many were lost in the 2012 Alberta general election. The Progressive Conservatives elected Ron Hirath and then Broyce Jacobs and the Alberta Alliance captured the district in 2004 holding it for a term before Broyce Jacobs won it back in 2008. The Wildrose Party won the district when Gary Bikman won it in the 2012 Alberta general election, and regained the seat in the  2015 Alberta general election, months after Bikman crossed to the PC Party.\nHistory\nThe electoral district was created in the 1996 boundary re-distribution from the old ridings of Cardston-Chief Mountain and Taber-Warner.\nThe 2010 Alberta boundary re-distribution saw only one minor change made to the riding when the Blood Reserve was transferred to the district from Livingstone-Macleod.\nThe Cardston-Taber-Warner electoral district was dissolved in the 2017 electoral boundary re-distribution, and portions of the district would form the newly created Cardston-Siksika and Taber-Warner electoral districts.\nBoundary history\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n!colspan=4|49 Cardston-Taber-Warner 2003 boundaries\n|-\n!colspan=4|Bordering districts\n|-\n!North\n!East\n!West\n!South\n|-\n|Livingstone-Macleod and Little Bow\n|Cypress-Medicine Hat\n|British Columbia boundary\n|Montana boundary\n|-\n|colspan=2 align=center|riding map goes here\n|colspan=2 align=center|\n|-\n!colspan=4|Legal description from the Statutes of Alberta 2003, Electoral Divisions Act.\n|-\n|colspan=4|Starting at the intersection of the Alberta-British Columbia boundary and the north boundary of Waterton Lakes National Park;

The first election held in 1997 saw Taber-Warner incumbent Ron Hierath run for his second term in office in the district. He ran against three other candidates taking 60% of the vote to pick up the new district for the Progressive Conservatives.\nHierath retired at dissolution in 2001. He was replaced by Progressive Conservative candidate Broyce Jacobs who the district easily over Alberta First Party leader John Reil who made a strong second place showing in the field of four candidates.\nJacobs stood for a second term in office in the 2004 general election but was defeated in a hotly contested race by Alberta Alliance candidate Paul Hinman. The Senate nominee election results also favored the Alberta Alliance well with the three Alliance candidates finishing in the top four spots.\nHinman became leader of the Alberta Alliance in 2005. He would lead his party to a merger with the unregistered Wildrose Party headed by party President Link Byfield on January 19, 2008. However Hinman would be defeated by Jacobs in the 2008 election held just weeks after his party merger.\nJacobs would be forced into retirement in the run up to the 2012 election after he lost his party nomination meeting to Pat Shimbashi. The general election saw the Wildrose party reclaim the district with candidate Gary Bikman defeating Shimbashi by a wide margin to earn his first term in office. Bikman subsequently crossed the floor to the PCs in 2014.\nWildrose re-gained the riding in 2015, with Grant Hunter becoming its last MLA. He also crossed the floor, joining the United Conservative Party when the PCs and Wildrose decided to merge in 2017.\nLegislative election results\n1997\n2001\n2004\n2008\n2012\n2015\nSenate nominee election results\n2004\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"5\" align=center|2004 Alberta Senate nominee election results: Cardston-Taber-Warner\n| colspan=\"2\"|Turnout 46.43%\n|-\n!style=\"width: 10px;\"|\n|Affiliation\n|Candidate\n|Votes\n|% votes\n|% ballots\n|Rank\n|Vance Gough\n|3,672\n|15.58%\n|46.75%\n|8\n|Michael Roth\n|2,961\n|12.56%\n|37.70%\n|7\n|Gary Horan\n|2,775\n|11.77%\n|35.33%\n|10\n|Independent\n|Link Byfield\n|2,263\n|9.60%\n|28.81%\n|4\n|Independent\n|Tom Sindlinger\n|1,395\n|5.93%\n|17.76%\n|9\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\"|Total votes\n|23,569\n|colspan=\"3\"|100%\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\"|Total ballots\n|7,855\n|colspan=\"3\"|3.00 votes per ballot\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\"|Rejected, spoiled and declined\n|colspan=\"4\"|980\n|}\nVoters had the option of selecting four candidates on the ballot\nStudent vote results\n2004\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=right\n!Participating schools\n|-\n|Glenwood School\n|-\n|Magrath Junior Senior High School\n|-\n|Raymond Jr. High School\n|-\n|St. Marys School\n|-\n|Taber Christian School\n|-\n|Tween Valley Christian School\n|-\n|W.R.

The vote was designed to educate students and simulate the electoral process for persons who have not yet reached the legal majority. The vote was conducted in 80 of the 83 provincial electoral districts with students voting for actual election candidates. Schools with a large student body that reside in another electoral district had the option to vote for candidates outside of the electoral district then where they were physically located.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"5\" align=\"center\"|2004 Alberta student vote results\n|-\n!style=\"width: 10px;\"|\n|Affiliation\n|Candidate\n|Votes\n|%\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\" align =\"right\"|Total\n|982\n|100%\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\"|Rejected, spoiled and declined\n|colspan=\"2\"|46\n|}\n2012\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|colspan=\"5\" align=center|2012 Alberta student vote results\n|-\n!style=\"width: 10px;\"|\n|Affiliation\n|Candidate\n|Votes\n|%\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\"|Total\n|\n|100%\n|}\nSee also\n* List of Alberta provincial electoral districts\n* Canadian provincial electoral districts\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.electionsalberta.ab.ca/ Elections Alberta]\n*[http://www.assembly.ab.ca/ The Legislative Assembly of Alberta]\n*[http://www.finance.gov.ab.ca/aboutalberta/ped_profiles/2004_new_boundaries/Cardston-Taber-Warner.pdf Demographics for Cardston-Taber-Warner]"
