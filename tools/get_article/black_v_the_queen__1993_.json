They found that the trial judge should have told them to scrutinise police interviews closely. It additionally found that the jury must be free to deliberate without any pressure being brought upon them.\nThe Court quashed the conviction, set aside the decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal and ordered a new trial.\nBroader applications\nIn Australian law, a \"Black direction\" is a direction by a judge to a jury to reconsider the votes of a small number of jury members.\nIn Queensland, a judge may make a \"Black direction\" to a jury.\nSee also\n* Allen v. United States (1896)\nReferences"
