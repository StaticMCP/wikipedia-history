Remains have been found in the La Brea Tar Pits in the United States. Although formerly placed in the separate genus Amplibuteo, it is currently recognised as a member of the still extant black hawk genus Buteogallus, within the Buteoninae subfamily that are chiefly referred to as hawks. Remains formerly referred to the species from Cuba are now placed in the separate species Buteogallus irpus.\nDescription and ecology\nIt is one of the largest birds of prey ever found, with an estimated total length , slightly larger than the Harpy eagle. Haast's eagle reached bigger lengths and appears to have been also more robust than Buteogallus woodwardi - Haast's was a forest-dwelling species. Buteogallus woodwardi appears to have hunted in open habitats, taking primarily small mammals and reptiles.\nIt has been suggested that Buteogallus woodwardi might be particularly similar to, and was once considered to be of the same genus as species in the formerly valid solitary eagle genus, Harpyhaliaetus. The reorganization of both animals into the Buteogallus genus has furthered the comparison. Several species of extant solitary eagles sport broad wings, short but wide tails, and dark coloration across the body with noticeable crests above the occipitals which Buteogallus woodwardi might have also had. The diet of modern solitary eagles has also suggested to be broadly similar, if on a smaller scale compared to their extinct relative, with reptiles and small mammals making up a large component of food resources. Scaled up to the size of Buteogallus woodwardi, and it is likely the giant black hawk was hunting similar prey in open habitats up to the size of small deer.\nReferences"
