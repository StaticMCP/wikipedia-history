Cape Northumberland is the southernmost point of mainland South Australia. The Glenelg River is the principal inflow and enters the bay near the town of Nelson.\nThe bay was named by explorer Thomas Mitchell when he came down the river on 20 August 1836.\nThe South Australian section of the bay's coastline is protected by the Lower South East Marine Park while the Victorian section of the coast is protected in the Discovery Bay Coastal Park.  The waters at the eastern end of the bay, adjacent to Cape Bridgewater, are protected by the Discovery Bay Marine National Park.\nSee also\n*Discovery Bay (disambiguation)\n*Piccaninnie Ponds Conservation Park\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
