It is managed by NHS Dumfries and Galloway.\nHistory\nThe facility has its origins in an infectious diseases hospital which opened in 1904. It joined the National Health Service in 1948. An extension was created by demolishing an adjacent smallpox hospital in the 1970s. The trust decided to limit the number of bed spaces to 14 due to staff shortages in 2018.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*"
