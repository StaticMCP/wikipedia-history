Most of these are probably mythical or only semi-historical. The following lists contain the chronological order of the title King of Athens (also prescribed earlier as kings of Attica), a semi-mythological title.\nEarliest kings\nThese three kings were supposed to have ruled before the flood of Deucalion.\n{| border=\"0\" width=777px\n!\n!  King !! Comments\n|-bgcolor=\"#cdcdcd\"\n|\n| width=\"222px\" |Periphas || Turned into an eagle by Zeus\n|-\n|\n| Ogyges ||King of the Ectenes who were the earliest inhabitants of Boeotia\n|-bgcolor=\"#cdcdcd\"\n|\n| Actaeus ||Father of Agraulus, and father-in-law to Cecrops\n|}\nOther sources mentioned two other ancient rulers of Athens:\n* Porphyrion - an earlier Athenian king than Actaeus. He was the reputed founder of the sanctuary of Heavenly Aphrodite on Athmoneis, an Athenian deme.\n* Colaenus -  Hellanicus, the Mitylenian historian, tells that this surname of Artemis is derived from Colænus, King of Athens before Cecrops and a descendant of Hermes. In obedience to an oracle he erected a temple to the goddess, invoking her as Artemis Colænis (the Artemis of Colænus).\nErechtheid dynasty\nThe early Athenian tradition, followed by the 3rd century BC Parian Chronicle, made Cecrops, a mythical half-man half-serpent, the first king of Athens. The dates for the following kings were conjectured centuries later, by historians of the Hellenistic era who tried to backdate events by cross-referencing earlier sources such as the Parian Chronicle. Tradition says that King Menestheus took part in the Trojan War.\nThe following list follows that of 1st Century BC Castor of Rhodes (FGrHist 250), with Castor's dates given in modern terms.\n{| border=\"0\" width=777px\n!

Codrus, the last king, repelled the Dorian invasion of Attica.\n{| border=\"0\" width=777px\n! Reign !! King !!

In 753 BC the hereditary archonship was replaced by a non-hereditary system (see Archons of Athens).\nNotes\nReferences\n* Gantz, Timothy, Early Greek Myth: A Guide to Literary and Artistic Sources, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996, Two volumes:  (Vol. 1),  (Vol. 2).\n* Harding, Phillip, The Story of Athens: The Fragments of the Local Chronicles of Attika, Routledge, 2007. .\n* Jacoby, Felix, \"Die Attische Königsliste\", Klio 3 (1902), 406–439."
