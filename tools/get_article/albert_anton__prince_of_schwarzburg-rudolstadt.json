He was raised to Imperial Prince in 1697, however, he chose not to accept his elevation.  In 1710, he was elevated again, and this time, he accepted.\nLife\nAlbert Anton was the son of Count Louis Günther I and his wife Emilie of Oldenburg-Delmenhorst. His wife and first cousin was the famous poet and hymn writer Emilie Juliane, née Countess of Barby-Mühlingen.\nAlbert Anton was esteemed very highly by Emperor Joseph I.  In 1705, he was appointed imperial commissioner and tasked with organizing the Emperor's homage in the free imperial cities of Mühlhausen and Goslar.  Two commemorative coins were minted on this occasion.\nIn 1697, he was raised to an Imperial Prince and the County of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt was raised to a principality.  However, he chose not to accept his elevation.  His main reason was his religious modesty, focussed on piety, which became more pronounced after the sudden death of his favourite sister Ludmilla Elisabeth.  He also wanted to avoid a confrontation with his neighbours, the Dukes from the Ernestine lines of the House of Wettin, who had opposed his elevation.\nIn 1710, the elevation was reaffirmed and this time, Albert Anton accepted it.  However, he did not publish his elevation and continued to use the style Count of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt.  His son and successor Louis Frederick I published the elevation in 1711, and began using the style Prince of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt on 15 April 1711.\nAlbert Anton was a friend and promoter of science.  He was motivated by a desire to develop his country in every possible way.  He created a number of charitable foundations aiming to facilitate access to scientific knowledge.\nHe died on 15 December 1710 in Rudolstadt, and was succeeded by his son Louis Frederick I.\nMarriage and issues\nAlbert Anton married Emilie Juliane in 1665. They had two children:\n# Louis Frederick I (b. 25 October 1667 — d. 24 June 1718)\n# Albertina Antonia (b. and d. 1668)\nSee also\n* House of Schwarzburg\n* Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt\nReferences\n*\n* Heinrich Friedrich Theodor Apfelstedt: Das Haus Kevernburg-Schwarzburg von seinem Ursprunge bis auf unsere Zeit: dargestellt in den Stammtafeln seiner Haupt- und Nebenlinien und mit biographischen Notizen über die wichtigsten Glieder derselben, Bertram, Sondershausen, 1890,\n* Horst Fleischer: Die Grafen von Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt: Albrecht VII. bis Albert Anton, Rudolstadt, 2000,\n* Johann Christian August Junghans: Geschichte der schwarzburgischen Regenten, Leipzig, 1821 [https://books.google.com/books?id=YZ8-AAAAYAAJ&dq=junghans+regenten+schwarzburg&pg=PA309 Online]\nExternal links\n* [http://www.heidecksburg.de/cms/pages/de/das-schloss/regenten.php Overview of the Counts and Princes of  Schwarzburg]"
