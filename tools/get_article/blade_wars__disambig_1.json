It was developed and published by Changyou.com. Blade Wars was inspired by martial arts and took place in a fantasy universe where three playable races, the Abyssals, Humans, and Immortals battle for dominance in PVP encounters.\nGameplay\nThe game featured F2P martial arts and used an isometric view and employed a control scheme similar to the one used in RuneScape and the Diablo game series.\nThe battle system was based on a dynamic algorithm that factors in a player's level, the time between attacks and the enemy's position. Players were able to feign attacks or dodge an opponent's strikes. Skill combinations could be customized to result in powerful attacks, which generate extra damage during a battle.\nThe game incorporated many of the features found in Changyou's previously released title, Dragon Oath. Mounts, trading, guild battles and daily events were included in Blade Wars. Unlike Dragon Oath, Blade Wars used a 2.5D graphics engine, mixing 2D and 3D graphics into an isometric view.\nThe game allowed players to use strategy in customizing the fighting system and encouraged skilled players to challenge each other for supremacy. After choosing one of the five classes available (Knight, Assassin, Shura, Warlock, or Warrior), players were able to dive into and explore a visually stunning world filled with challenges and fierce wars.\nDevelopment and release\n]]\nOriginally released in China in 2007, Blade Wars received an English adaptation and was launched on American and British markets in 2010.\nReception\nBlade Wars received an award in 2009 from the Chinese gaming site Wangyou for Original Title of the Year.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110402075154/http://bw.us.changyou.com/en/ Official North American website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100516143132/http://bw.eu.changyou.com/ Official European website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100312025145/http://bw.my.changyou.com/ Official Malaysian website]\n* [http://dj2.changyou.com/ Official Chinese website]"
