Warrier criticised the commercial aspect of Ayurveda clinics in Western countries, claiming that they were set up to trick people out of their money. In 2006, the hospital received a court order to wind up its activities due to insolvency, and the company was dissolved in 2012.\nAyurvedic university\nIn 2004, Warrier, David McAlpine and Lady Sarah Morritt (trustees of the Ayurvedic Charitable Hospital) founded Mayur, the \"Ayurvedic University of Europe\", in London; it offers a B.Sc. degree in Ayurveda.\nAyurvedic restaurant\nWarrier opened an “Ayurvedic restaurant” named Mantra in 2004 in the City of London. Rather than diners selecting dishes from a menu, the waiter would assess them and decide what food would be appropriate for them. The restaurant abandoned this approach the following year.\nPlays and poems\nWarrier is the author of three books of poems, Varaha, and Lament of JC. and  \"Tenth Incarnation\".\nWarrier has staged several plays in London and Mumbai: God Sports, The Tenth Incarnation, Genesis of Karma -Three Faces of Evil, Siddhivinayak Saves Mumbai from Terror Attack. \"Ego of the Yogis - Searching for Spirituality in a Contaminated World\"  and \"A Polyester Lordship\" in London at the Steiner Theatre.\nBibliography\nAyurvedic medicine\n* Gopi Warrier.
