It is headquartered at the Grade II* listed King Arthur's Great Halls in Tintagel, Cornwall, which Glasscock built in the early 1930s as the society's permanent home.\nThe Fellowship holds ceremonies at its granite Round Table and supports children's charities and Arthurian heritage.\nHistory\nFrederick Thomas Glasscock (1871–1934), a retired custard manufacturer and Freemason, founded the Fellowship in 1927 in London before moving it to Tintagel. The society originally promoted Arthurian chivalry, with membership reaching over 17,000 by the early 1930s.\nGlasscock constructed King Arthur's Great Halls (opened 1933) as its headquarters, featuring a granite Round Table and 72 stained-glass windows by Veronica Whall. The Fellowship became dormant during World War II, was sold to Freemasons in the 1950s, and was revived in the late 20th century. According to its own tradition, the Fellowship claims continuity with an 18th-century London society and a 14th-century order founded by King Edward III.\nLeadership and structure\nThe Fellowship is governed by voluntary officers defined in its constitution. The current Knight-Seneschal (head) is Professor Sir Roland \"Roly\" Rotherham, an Arthurian historian and lecturer.\nKey roles include Knight Chamberlain (ceremony master), Knight Bursar (treasurer), and regional Chapter Knights.\nActivities and ceremonies\nThe Fellowship holds two annual dinners with investitures:\n* June at Tintagel (main event with oath renewal)\n* November at Kasteel de Berckt, Baarlo, Netherlands (European gathering).\nIt supports children's charities and hosts lectures.\nGallery\nFile:King Arthur's Great Halls, Tintagel (5611).jpg|The Round Table – ceremonial centre\nFile:King Arthur's Great Halls, Tintagel (5615).jpg|Hall interior with Veronica Whall windows\nFile:Professor Roland Rotherham Elf Fantasy Fair 2011 01.jpg|Professor Sir Roland \"Roly\" Rotherham, current Knight-Seneschal\nReferences"
