This church was built on a site to which the second meetinghouse (from 1797) had been moved in the 1830s, after the church and government separated the use of facilities.  The 1797 building was destroyed by fire in 1874.\nThe church was designed by Amos P. Cutting, and has stained-glass windows by Samuel West.\nThe church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.\nThe church was bought by the congregation of Emmanuel Orthodox Church in 2008, a parish of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America. The congregation maintains the building and its 1875 Steer & Turner pipe organ.\nSee also\n* 1875 in architecture\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Worcester County, Massachusetts\nReferences"
