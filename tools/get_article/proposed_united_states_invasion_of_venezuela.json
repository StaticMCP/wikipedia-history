In 2017, Trump said that he was \"not going to rule out a military option\" to address the worsening crisis in Venezuela and the autocratic regime of Nicolás Maduro. Trump also had asked senior advisors about invading Venezuela, which was strongly recommended against by National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster, and the Trump administration instead opted for a campaign of sanctions and diplomatic pressure against Venezuela.\nDuring the second Trump presidency, the United States surged military assets to the Caribbean in August 2025, citing the fight against drug cartels as its stated objective. Experts, analysts and current and former government officials stated that that the assets deployed were insufficient for an invasion and they viewed an invasion as unlikely.\nFirst Trump presidency (2017–2021)\nAccording to the Associated Press, within the framework of the crisis in Venezuela, unnamed administration officials stated that an intervention was raised in 2017 to Donald Trump's advisors, including US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and national security advisor H. R. McMaster (who left the Trump administration from that moment on) and later to several presidents of Latin American countries including Juan Manuel Santos. Gustavo Petro, president of Colombia, declared in May 2023 that Trump had made a proposal to then-president Iván Duque to invade Venezuela through Colombia, but that his advisors had stopped him. On both occasions, everyone present asked Trump not to proceed with the plan.\nOn the possibility of intervention in Venezuela during the Venezuelan presidential crisis, Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs, Kimberly Breier said: \"Although our policy is based on a peaceful transition, we have made it very clear that all options are on the table.\" John Bolton, National Security advisor at the time, published in a 2020 book, The Room Where It Happened, that Trump said that invading Venezuela would be \"cool\" because it is \"really part of the United States\". In June 2023, Trump said at a press conference in North Carolina, \"When I left, Venezuela was about to collapse. We would have taken over it, we would have kept all that oil.\"\nTrump stated on 11 August 2017 that he is \"not going to rule out a military option\" to confront the autocratic government of Nicolás Maduro and the deepening crisis in Venezuela. CNN wrote in July 2018 that a senior administration official stated that, in an August 2017 meeting about imposing diplomatic and financial sanctions on Venezuela, Trump asked senior advisers about the possibility of invading Venezuela. Then-National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster and other aides strongly advised against military action, warning that it could backfire and that regional allies opposed such measures. The official emphasized that there was \"no imminent plan\" for an invasion, describing Trump's remarks as thinking \"out loud\". Trump's comments were first reported by the Associated Press and came a day before he publicly stated that a \"military option\" against Venezuela remained possible.\nAn Argentine online paper wrote in August 2020 that Senator Marco Rubio had suggested a U.S. invasion of Venezuela during at least two meetings with senior White House officials, aiming to secure President Trump's Latino vote in Florida ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo opposed the proposal, rejecting the use of military force. This disagreement was among the reasons Bolton resigned as National Security Advisor.\nTrump raised the issue with Latin American leaders on the sidelines of the 72nd session of the United Nations General Assembly, though they uniformly rejected the idea. The Trump administration subsequently pursued a policy of sanctions and diplomatic pressure on Venezuela while continuing to call for free and fair elections.\nOne week after U.S. federal prosecutors indicted Maduro on narcoterrorism charges, Trump announced at a White House press conference in April 2020 that the U.S. was deploying Navy destroyers, surveillance aircraft, and additional military personnel to the Caribbean near Venezuela; the Associated Press reported that there was \"no indication ...&nbsp;that any sort of U.S. invasion is being planned\".\nTrump said on Fox News in May 2020 that \"If we ever did anything with Venezuela\", in that case, \"it would be called 'invasion, explaining: \"if I wanted to go into Venezuela I wouldn't make a secret about it\", and \"I wouldn't send a small, little group, no, no, no. It would be called an army\".\nSecond Trump presidency (2025–present)\nThe US began  deploying naval assets to the Caribbean in August 2025 with the stated goal of opposing drug cartels; the Associated Press reported that the \"U.S. government has not signaled any planned land incursion from the thousands of personnel being deployed, and analysts and current and former government officials see no possibility of an invasion in Venezuela\". Maduro responded to the deployment by mobilizing over four million soldiers of the Bolivarian Militia across Venezuela, while saying that the country was at \"maximum preparedness\" for a possible American attack.\nCNN reported in September 2025 that Trump was considering a range of options for military strikes against drug cartels operating on Venezuelan soil, including potential targets inside the country, as part of a broader strategy aimed at weakening Maduro, according to multiple sources briefed on the administration's plans.\nAnalysis\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that there were too few U.S. naval and air assets in the Caribbean as of October 2025 to carry out an invasion, and a military expert from Center for Strategic and International Studies said there were too few troops deployed by a factor of between 5 and 20.\nInternational relations professor Stephen Kinzer compared the idea of invading Venezuela to arrest Nicolás Maduro on US drug trafficking charges to the actual 1989 United States invasion of Panama, in which it arrested Manuel Noriega on US drug trafficking charges. In September 2025, Kinzer warned against thinking such an operation would be as easy, given the US had many troops based in the Panama Canal Zone, and that Panama was a much smaller country with a smaller military. Both Maduro and Noriega attracted ire for anti-American stances, though Noriega had previously collaborated with the US Central Intelligence Agency and had been offered the option to quietly leave power.\nShannon K. O'Neil from the Council on Foreign Relations opined in 2018 that an American military intervention in Venezuela would \"be a disaster\". She assessed that the United States would need over 100,000 troops to invade the country and that American troops would have to deal with Venezuela's destroyed infrastructure, armed militias, local drug cartels, and the blame from international observers if they were unable to rebuild the nation.\nSee also\n*Naval blockade against Venezuela of 1902&minus;1903\n* Foreign interventions by the United States\n*\n*\n*\nReferences"
