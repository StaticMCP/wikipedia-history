It restored most of the provisions of the Treaty of Hadiach, except for the elevation of Ruthenia to the status equal to Poland and Lithuania. It invalidated the Pereiaslav Articles, which were often considered unfavorable for Ukraine, severed the union with the Tsardom of Russia and restored Ukraine's state ties with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Although the Ukrainian government insisted on the full restoration of the Treaty of Hadiach of 1658, the side of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, represented by Stanisław Potocki and Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski, did not agree to the restitution of the Grand Duchy of Ruthenia, leaving other points of the Treaty of Hadiach in force.\nThe treaty was signed following the Polish victory at the Battle of Chudnov. The treaty meant that the Cossacks withdrew their support from Russia in the Russo–Polish War (1654–67), and transferred it back to the Commonwealth. The war would eventually be concluded with the 1667 Treaty of Andrusovo.\nTerms\nThe Treaty of Chudnov contained the following main points:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n| align=\"center\" |I\n| style=\"background:#F2F2CE; color:black\" |The representers of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Potocki and Lubomirski must confirm with their oath the Treaty of Hadiach, with the exception of the points that concern the Grand Principality of Ruthenia.\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |II\n| style=\"background:#F2F2CE; color:black\" |Yurii Khmelnytsky with the Ukrainian Cossack army retreats from the Tsar of Russia and should not look for a patron other than the King of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |III\n| style=\"background:#F2F2CE; color:black\" |The hetman with the army returns to Ukraine to take back the fortresses that are under the control of Russia.\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |IV\n| style=\"background:#F2F2CE; color:black\" |The Pereiaslav colonel Tymish Tsytsiura is forgiven for his crimes.
