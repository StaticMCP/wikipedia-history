It contains recordings of three complete concerts performed on February 28, March 1, and March 2, 1991, at the Warfield Theatre in San Francisco.  It was released on August 15, 2025.\nEach of the three concerts will also be released separately on vinyl – February 28, 1991 (four LPs) on August 15, 2025; March 1, 1991 (four LPs) on October 3, 2025; and March 2, 1991 (five LPs) on December 5, 2025.\nThese shows featured the Jerry Garcia Band's 1986 to 1993 lineup of Jerry Garcia on guitar and vocals, Melvin Seals on keyboards, John Kahn on bass, David Kemper on drums, and Jacklyn LaBranch and Gloria Jones on backing vocals.\nCritical reception\nOn jambands.com, Larson Sutton wrote, \"As the JGB lineup solidified alongside the repertoire, the sextet rose to its potential as an equally reliable, smoking ensemble. No question, this six-CD collection documenting a three-show run at the famed Warfield in the winter of 1991 had the heater on high.... And, with Garcia and his group approaching most of the tunes with a jazzer's mentality – establishing the song, then launching into journeys of improvisation – every moment is of discovery, despite how engrained some of the songs had become.\"\nIn Glide Magazine, Doug Collette said, \"It is a special pleasure indeed to hear the titular leader of the Grateful Dead in friendly confines such as this vaunted San Francisco venue. But as the ever erudite (and passionate) Blair Jackson writes in his liner notes, Garcia and company's history lent itself to those rare moments of inspired intimacy that populated these three nights and six sets of music.\"\n}}"
