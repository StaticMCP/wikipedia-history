It was first awarded as part of the ESPY Awards in 2004 after the non-gender-specific Best Action Sports Athlete ESPY Award was presented the previous two years (with American snowboarder Shaun White receiving the 2003 award). The Best Male Action Sports Athlete ESPY Award trophy, created by sculptor Lawrence Nowlan, is presented to the male adjudged to be the best action sports athlete in a given calendar year. Balloting for the award is undertaken by fans over the Internet from between three and five choices selected by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee, which is composed of a panel of experts. It is conferred in July to reflect performance and achievement over the preceding twelve months.\nThe inaugural winner of the Best Male Action Sports Athlete ESPY Award at the 2004 awards was freestyle BMX rider Ryan Nyquist. During 1997 and 2003, Nyquist won eleven out of eighteen available freestyle BMX medals at the X Games. He became the first freestyle BMX rider to be nominated for, and thus the first to win, an ESPY Award. The 2006 winner of the Best Male Action Sports Athlete ESPY Award was Shaun White. He was nominated a further five consecutive times between the 2008 and 2012 ceremonies, all of which he won, making him the athlete with the most victories with six. The two other athletes to have earned successive awards are street skateboarder Nyjah Huston and motocross rider Ryan Dungey. Canadian snowboarder Mark McMorris became the first non-American to win the accolade in 2017  by earning three medals at that year's X Games in Minneapolis. Snowboarders are the most successful sportspeople with seven awards, followed by motocross riders, with four, and street skateboarders, with three. It was not awarded in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The most recent winner of the award was American Motocross and Supercross racer Eli Tomac in 2022.\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Best Male Action Sports Athlete ESPY Award winners and nominees\n|-\n! scope=col | Year\n! scope=col  class=unsortable | Image\n! scope=col | Athlete\n! scope=col | Nationality\n! scope=col | Sport(s) regularly contested\n! scope=col class=unsortable | Nominees\n! scope=col class=unsortable |\n|-\n| 2004\n| –\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Freestyle BMX (park and dirt jumping)\n| align=left | Brian Deegan () – Freestyle motocrossBucky Lasek () – SkateboardingChad Reed () – Motocross/Supercross\n|\n|-\n| 2005\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Freestyle BMX (street, park, and vert)\n| align=left | Ricky Carmichael () – MotocrossAndy Irons () – SurfingBucky Lasek () – Skateboarding\n|\n|-\n| 2006\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Snowboarding (half-pipe)\n| align=left | Jamie Bestwick () – BMXRicky Carmichael () – MotocrossKelly Slater () – SurfingJeremy Stenberg () – Freestyle motocross\n|\n|-\n| 2007\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Motocross/rallying\n| align=left | Ricky Carmichael () – MotocrossKelly Slater () – SurfingDanny Way () – SkateboardingAndreas Wiig () – Snowboarding\n|\n|-\n| 2008\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Snowboarding (half-pipe, slopestyle),Skateboarding (vert)\n| align=left | Kevin Pearce () – SnowboardingChad Reed () – SupercrossKevin Robinson () – BMX\n|\n|-\n| 2009\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Snowboarding (half-pipe, slopestyle),Skateboarding (vert)\n| align=left | Ryan Sheckler () – SkateboardingKelly Slater () – SurfingJames Stewart Jr. () – Motocross\n|\n|-\n| 2010\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Snowboarding (half-pipe, slopestyle),Skateboarding (vert)\n| align=left | Bobby Brown () – FreeridingRyan Dungey () – MotocrossMick Fanning () – SurfingGarrett Reynolds () – Freestyle BMX\n|\n|-\n| 2011\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Snowboarding (half-pipe, slopestyle),Skateboarding (vert)\n| align=left | Tucker Hibbert () – SnowmobilingTravis Pastrana () – MotocrossKevin Rolland () – Freestyle skiingKelly Slater () – Surfing\n|\n|-\n| 2012\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Snowboarding (half-pipe, slopestyle),Skateboarding (vert)\n| align=left | Travis Rice () –  SnowboardingKelly Slater () – SurfingRyan Villopoto () – Motocross\n|\n|-\n| 2013\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Street skateboarding\n| align=left | Pedro Barros () – SkateboardingMark McMorris () – SnowboardingRyan Villopoto () – Motocross\n|\n|-\n| 2014\n| –\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Street skateboarding\n| align=left | Grant Baker () – SurfingTucker Hibbert () – SnowmobilingRyan Villopoto () – MotocrossDavid Wise () – Freestyle skiing\n|\n|-\n| 2015\n| –\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Motocross\n| align=left | Tucker Hibbert () – SnowmobilingNyjah Huston () – Street skateboardingMark McMorris () – SnowboardingJosh Sheehan () – Freestyle motocross\n|\n|-\n| 2016\n| –\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Motocross\n| align=left | Pedro Barros () –  SkateboardingNyjah Huston () – SkateboardingGus Kenworthy () – Freestyle skiingMark McMorris () – Snowboarding\n|\n|-\n| 2017\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Snowboarding\n| align=left | Øystein Bråten () – Freestyle skiingJohn John Florence () – SurfingNyjah Huston () – Skateboarding\n|\n|-\n| 2018\n| –\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Freestyle skier\n| align=left | Henrik Harlaut () – Freestyle skiingKelvin Hoefler () – SkateboardingMarcus Kleveland () – Snowboarding\n|\n|-\n| 2019\n| –\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Street skateboarding\n| align=left | Scotty James () – SnowboardingGabriel Medina () – SurfingTom Pagès () – Freestyle motocross\n|\n|-class=\"sortbottom\"\n| 2020\n| colspan=5 align=center|Not awarded due to the COVID-19 pandemic\n|\n|-\n| 2021\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Surfing\n| align=left | Marcus Kleveland () – SnowboardingYūto Totsuka () – SnowboardingCooper Webb () – Motocross/Supercross\n|\n|-\n| 2022\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Motocross/Supercross\n| align=left | Alex Hall () – SkiingYuto Horigome () – SkateboardingAyumu Hirano () – Snowboarding\n|\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* Best Female Action Sports Athlete ESPY Award\n* Laureus World Sports Award for Action Sportsperson of the Year\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
