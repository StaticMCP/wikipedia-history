Locally this deemed natural tower is known as Tsotsola Rock and rumored to have some resemblance with figure of the Christian monk.\nMonument origin and history\nMonument origin is not completely clear, as it may be a denudational relict from a neogene conglomerate or from naturally cemented cobbles  known as pinnacle or hoodoo  that was later altered by man for cult purposes. Detailed lithostratigraphy studies are not available.\nAt the base the rock column has diameter of 4 m and column gradually narrows towards the top. Presently the column surface is covered with shrubbery.\nThe column contains a small cave with two niches, one of many, that were utilized as a shelter by early Christian monks in Georgia,  possibly in the V – VII centuries, and later during Timur's invasions of Georgia. The Georgian Chronicles reports that Timur's archers descended the column using ropes and shoot their arrows into the crowded cave.\nNearby slopes has many similar man-made caves scattered around.\nEntire cave complex enjoys same protection as natural monument.\nSee also\n* List of natural monuments of Georgia\n* S3 highway (Georgia)\nReferences"
