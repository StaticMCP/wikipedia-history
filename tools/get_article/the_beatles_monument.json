Songs by The Beatles are constantly played from speakers.\nInstallation details\nThe bronze monument by sculptor Eduard Kazaryan on Kok-Tobe Mountain was unveiled in 2007. The funds for the construction of the monument were allocated by the \"Seimar\" charitable non-profit foundation. The competition committee considered a large number of designs for the monument and only one was chosen. Permission for installing the monument was obtained from the Ministry of Culture of Kazakhstan: this required obtaining agreement with the rights holder of The Beatles brand. In addition, the surviving members of the band, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, gave their consent to build the monument.\nReferences"
