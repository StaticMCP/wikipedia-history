The township is being created by the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) along the Jaipur Ring Road near Agra Road.  It draws inspiration from the historic Walled City of Jaipur and is designed as a low‑density, heritage‑themed settlement with modern infrastructure and green spaces.\nBackground\nRationale\nJaipur, founded in 1727, has outgrown its 18th‑century core.  Government authorities have identified congestion inside the historic walled city and pressure on infrastructure as reasons for creating new planned towns around the ring road.  A JDA‑backed master development called New Heritage City was conceived to provide a heritage‑style urban environment while meeting the needs of a growing population.  The Jaipur Master Development Plan 2025 set aside land around Agra Road for this scheme, noting that the proposed project would cover about 13 km².  The plan was subsequently refined to two blocks measuring about 3.63 km² and 2.57 km² respectively.\nAnnouncement and government notification\nOn 15 October 2022 the Jaipur Development Authority issued a notification under section 25 of the JDA Act announcing the Heritage City Scheme on Agra Road.  News reports stated that the notification followed several consultations with the Urban Development and Housing (UDH) department and that the proposed township would mirror the architecture of Jaipur’s walled city with both residential and commercial buildings. The UDH minister later unveiled a special logo, lease documents and application forms for the project, confirming that JDA and private developers would implement the scheme.\nAlignment with master plans\nThe project is part of the Jaipur Master Development Plan 2025.  A draft Special Heritage Development Plan 2041 for the Walled City is also being prepared by Jaipur Heritage Municipal Corporation and state planning agencies, and JDA’s heritage city is designed to complement that initiative.\nPlanning and design\nLayout and zoning\nNew Heritage City uses a grid‑iron layout similar to the 18th‑century Walled City.  Blog posts describing the master plan state that the township is divided into zones for residential, commercial, institutional and entertainment use.  Streets are aligned to create courtyards (chaupars) and city blocks (chowkris) reminiscent of Jaipur’s old quarters.  Buildings will feature pink façades, jharokha balconies and traditional jali screens to maintain a heritage appearance.  A maximum building height of 18 m (approximately ground plus three storeys) has been set to preserve a uniform skyline.  At least 10 % of the area is reserved for green spaces, and plans include 18 public parks and a 12‑hectare biodiversity park.  Verandahs along 30‑m roads will be 4 m wide.\nThe zoning regulations encourage mixed use.  An initial plan described by JDA officials envisaged allocating around 50 % of the land for economic activities and about 47 % for residential uses.  Institutional plots (18) and commercial plots (27) are planned.  In the Hindi daily Patrika, officials said about 150 smaller schemes would eventually be carved out of the 7.21‑km² planning area and that 60 % of the land could be sold while the remaining 40 % would be reserved for public facilities.  JDA regulations require that any sub‑scheme must be at least 5 hectares and that at least 5 % of its area be devoted to gardens.\nRoads and gates\nThe master plan provides for roads of multiple widths: major arteries are 120 feet (≈36 m) wide, secondary roads 60 feet (≈18 m) and internal streets 40 feet (≈12 m).  The internal road hierarchy was tested during early works: according to a Patrika report, sample roads were built with widths of 36 m, 18 m and 12 m.  Heritage‑style gates will mark entrances to the city; nine gates are envisaged and the first gate under construction measures 16 m in height.  Nine public squares (chaupars) will serve as community focal points, and each chowkdi block will include two parks.\nGreen infrastructure\nPlans include biodiversity parks along the Dhund River, green belts and wide boulevards with tree‑lined medians.  Parking management is integral: about 72 parking lots are proposed.  The township will integrate eco‑friendly transport such as cycling paths and planned metro connectivity.\nImplementation and development\nDevelopers and governance\nThe Urban Development and Housing department has directed that New Heritage City will be developed jointly by the Jaipur Development Authority and private developers.  According to an October 2022 briefing, at least one project will be implemented directly by JDA and at least one by private developers.  Mixed public–private implementation is expected to speed up delivery while ensuring that infrastructure and public services are pre‑zoned and regulated.\nPhases and budgets\nFollowing the 2022 notification, JDA began preliminary works.  In June 2024 the Hindi daily Patrika reported that road construction had started on Agra Road, with about ₹3.33 crore (33.3 million) sanctioned for road works and ₹1.80 crore already spent.  Another ₹1.43 crore was allocated for the first heritage gate, of which ₹23 lakh had been expended.  The report noted that the scheme’s total area being developed at this stage was 7.21 km².\nA tender floated in September 2024 for “construction of roads in Govindpura Ropada (Heritage City) zone 10” shows that infrastructure works continue.  The tender had a value of about ₹4.61 crore and specified road construction over a period of 365 days, with bids closing on 14 October 2024.\nFeatures and significance\nNew Heritage City is envisioned as a low‑density, heritage‑styled township that will eventually house more than 200,000 residents.  The design combines the grid plan and pink façades of Jaipur’s 18th‑century core with sustainable infrastructure such as wide roads, metro corridors, cycling paths and green belts.  The project’s proponents argue that the mix of residential, commercial and institutional zones will create a self‑contained micro‑city.  For planners, New Heritage City serves as a model for integrating heritage‑based design with modern urban systems, and for investors it represents an opportunity to acquire plots in a government‑approved scheme.\nSee also\n* Jaipur\n* Jaipur Development Authority\nReferences"
