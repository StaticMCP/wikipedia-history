He also spent this money commissioning documentary filmmaker Jan Kaplan to design the museum.  According to Kaplan, he created a three-act tragedy displaying the ideals of communism, the reality of life under the regime, and the actions of the police state.  It includes rooms depicting a schoolroom, a shop with limited supplies, and a secret police interrogation room.\nThe gallery is devoted to providing a timeline of the communist regime in Czechoslovakia. Written descriptions in Czech and English communicate to the audience what it was to live under the regime, law and order, education system, and trade and business. These descriptions have all been provided in written and pictorial form, frequently supported by red and black artwork.\nGallery\nFile:Praha Nove Mesto V celnici 4 Muzeum komunismu.jpg|Entrance from Náměstí republiky (2022)\nFile:Museum of Communism Entrance 2.jpg|Entrance within the Savarin Palace (2016)\nFile:Museum of Communism School 1.jpg|Schoolroom display, with child in Pioneer outfit (state youth movement)\nFile:Museum of Communism Shop 1.jpg|Grocery shop with limited goods\nFile:Museum of Communism Posters 1.jpg|Posters showing the good life\nFile:Museum of Communism (17124068557).jpg|Lenin statue and the Soviet Union flag\nFile:Museum of Communism, Czech Republic.jpg|various artifacts\nFile:Karl Marx statue, Museum of Communism.jpg|Karl Marx statue, Museum of Communism\nFile:Kark Marx.jpg|Karl Marx, Museum of Communism\nReferences"
