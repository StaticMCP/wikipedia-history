The NCHM is in charge of contributing to the State´s duty of memory regarding the violations committed during the Colombian armed conflict. Also, it helps on the comprehensive reparation and the right to the truth to which the victims and the entire society are entitled.\nThe Centre produces public information available for everyone interested, through museum and educational activities that enrich the knowledge of the social and political history of Colombia. In 2021, the NCHM will inaugurate the Colombia’s National Museum of Memory, a platform for the dialogue and articulation of plural memories of the armed conflict that guarantees the inclusion of different actors and populations and contributes to the comprehensive reparation, historical clarification, guaranties of non-repetition and the construction of a sustainable peace.\nDeemed to be very close to the Colombian government and the Armed Forces, the Centre was excluded in 2020 from the International Coalition of Sites of Conscience (which brings together more than 200 museums and memorials in over 60 countries). According to associations of victims of the conflict and historians, the center carries out \"negationist\" work by reducing the armed conflict to a struggle between the State and \"terrorists.\nThe government approved the so-called \"veterans' law,\" which provides that a space in the National Memory Museum be dedicated \"to displaying to the public the life stories of veterans of the public force, especially highlighting their courageous actions, their sacrifice and their contribution to the general welfare.\nThe director of the organization, Darío Acevedo, resigned on July 7, 2022, following a complaint filed against him by the Special Jurisdiction for Peace for having altered documents, when he did not have the right to do so, in order to conceal the role of paramilitarism in the conflict. Darío AcevedoHe faced several controversies and was criticized by victims' associations who accused him of denial. In particular, he signed a controversial agreement with José Félix Lafaurie, president of the Colombian Federation of Cattle Breeders (FEDEGAN), to highlight the role of cattle breeders in the conflict, while FEDEGAN has often been criticized for financing paramilitary groups and opposing reparations to victims through land restitution.\nOrganization\nTo fulfill its mandates and strategic objectives, the NCHM is divided into four large areas:\n*\tConstruction of Historical Memory Directorate\n*\tNational Museum of Memory Directorate\n*\tHuman Rights Archive Directorate\n*\tTruth Agreements Directorate\nOne of its main objectives is the contribution to the clarification of the facts, the culprits and the conditions that made the armed conflict possible, as well as the institutional, political and social dynamics that unleashed and degraded the conflict.\nAlso, the NCHM works to:\n*\tConsolidate the role of memory as a right and public patrimony.\n*\tDignify the victims and clarify the violent acts committed during the armed conflict.\n*\tPlan, construct and deliver to the country the National Museum of Memory as a place that dignifies the victims and promotes a culture respectful of human rights.\nReports published\n2008\n* Trujillo: A tragedy that Never Ceases\n2009\n* El Salado: That War was not Ours\n* Memories in Wartime\n* Toolbox: Recall and Narrate the Conflict\n2010\n* Bojayá: War Without Limits\n* La Rochela: Memoirs of a Crime Against Justice\n* The Bahía Portete Massacre: Wayuu Women in the Spotlight\n* The Disputed Land\n* Memories of Dispossession and Peasant Resistance in the Caribbean Coast (1960 - 2010)\n2011\n* Women and War: Victims and Resistance in the Colombian Caribbean\n* Women Who Make History: Earth, Body and Policy in the Colombian Caribbean\n* San Carlos: Memories of Exodus in War\n* The Invisible Footprint of War: Forced Displacement in the Comuna 13\n* The Unarmed Order.
