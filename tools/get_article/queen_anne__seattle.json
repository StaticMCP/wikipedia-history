Queen Anne covers an area of , and has a population of about 28,000.  It is bordered by Belltown to the south, Lake Union to the east, the Lake Washington Ship Canal to the north and Interbay to the west.\nThe neighborhood is built on a hill, now named Queen Anne Hill, which became a popular spot for the city's early economic and cultural elite to build their mansions. Its name is derived from the Queen Anne architectural style in which many of the early homes were built.\nGeography and history\nLocation and borders\nskyline as viewed from Puget Sound.]]\nQueen Anne is bounded on the north by the Fremont Cut of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, beyond which is Fremont; on the west by 15th and Elliott Avenues&nbsp;West, beyond which is Interbay, Magnolia, and Elliott Bay; on the east by Lake Union and Aurora Avenue North, beyond which is Westlake.  As a neighborhood toponym, Queen Anne may include Lower Queen Anne, also known as Uptown, the area at the southern base of the hill, just north and west of Seattle Center.  Whether or not Lower Queen Anne is considered a separate neighborhood matters in setting Queen Anne's southern boundary, which is either West Mercer Street or Denny Way.\nQueen Anne can be reached from Interstate 5 via the Mercer Street Exit (Exit&nbsp;167). The neighborhood's main thoroughfares are Gilman Drive West, 3rd Avenue West, Queen Anne Avenue North, Boston Street, and a set of streets, collectively known as Queen Anne Boulevard, that loop around the crown of the hill and reflect a comprehensive boulevard design in the style of the Olmsted Brothers architectural firm. The design was never fully executed, but it remains part of the Seattle Parks System.\nWhile Queen Anne stands out in Seattle geography due to its proximity to downtown and three television broadcast towers, the highest point in the city,  above sea level, is in West Seattle. Queen Anne slopes are home to seven of the twenty steepest streets in the city and 120 pedestrian staircases.\nDemographics\nIncluding the sub-neighborhoods of North Queen Anne, West Queen Anne, East Queen Anne and Lower Queen Anne (or Uptown), Queen Anne has approximately 19,000 households and a total population of about 36,000.  Queen Anne is disproportionately populated by unmarried, white, young adults.  The population is more racially homogeneous than Seattle as a whole.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!\n! Queen Anne\n! Seattle\n!\nWashington\n!

When white settlers arrived in the mid-19th century, the Duwamish tribe maintained a seasonal presence in and around Queen Anne.\nWhite settlement of Queen Anne stemmed from the arrival of the Denny Party at West Seattles Alki Point in November 1851.  In 1853, David Denny staked a claim to  of land the Duwamish called ''baba'kwoh, prairies, known today as Lower Queen Anne, and bounded by Elliott Bay to the west, Lake Union to the east, Mercer Street to the north, and Denny Way to the south.  Denny called the area \"Potlach Meadows\".  Development of the hill, called at various times North Seattle, Galer Hill, and Eden Hill, was slow.  Then an 1875 windstorm flattened thousands of trees on Queen Anne, making the previously dense forest more appealing for settlement.  The hill began to be called \"Queen Anne\" by 1885, after the Queen Anne style houses that dominated the area.  The arrival of the Northern Pacific Railway (1883) and the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway (1887), the Great Seattle Fire of 1889, and the opening of three cable car lines to the top of the hill starting in 1890, including the Queen Anne Counterbalance, further encouraged residential and business development.\nThe 1917 opening of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, and the Fremont and Ballard Bridges over it, made the area more appealing for maritime and timber industries, and connected Queen Anne with communities to the north.  On the south side of the hill, the 1927 completion of a Civic Center (with auditorium, ice arena and football field) on David Denny's Potlach Meadows land brought residents from all over the city to Queen Anne for concerts and sporting events.\nThe first television broadcast in the Pacific Northwest originated from the hill in November 1948, when KRSC-TV (now KING-TV) signed-on from its transmitting tower at Third Avenue North and Galer Street. KOMO-TV installed its own tower nearby, on Galer Street and Orange Place North, and began operations from there in December 1953, and KIRO-TV went on the air in February 1958 from a tower adjacent to its original studios on Queen Anne Avenue.\n\"The 1962 Seattle World's Fair was perhaps the most transformational single event in the history of Queen Anne\", according to historians Florence K. Lentz and Mimi Sheridan.  Named the Century 21 Exposition, the fair expanded on existing Civic Center infrastructure on the old ''baba'kwoh swale.  After the fair, the grounds became the Seattle Center, home to the Space Needle, Pacific Science Center, Experience Music Project, Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame, the north terminal of the Seattle monorail and KeyArena.\nThe Seattle SuperSonics began playing at the then-Seattle Center Coliseum in 1967.  The Seattle Thunderbirds hockey team began play next door at the Mercer Street Arena in 1977.  The Seattle Storm basketball team began play at KeyArena in 2000.\nAs late as 1964, the area had a large enough population of families with children to motivate opening McClure Middle School, but by 1981 a decline in such families led the school system to close Queen Anne High School, North Queen Anne Elementary School, and West Queen Anne Elementary School.\nAssistant United States Attorney Thomas C. Wales was shot in his home in the Queen Anne neighborhood on October 11, 2001, dying the next day of his wounds.  The murder remains unsolved.\nLandmarks\non Queen Anne Hill with Mount Rainier in the background]]\nQueen Anne is home to 29 official Seattle landmarks, including 12 historic houses.  A group of residences on 14th Avenue West, built between 1890 and 1910, include one of the few remaining Queen Anne style houses on the hill.  The North Queen Anne Drive Bridge, built in 1936 across Wolf Creek, is a parabolic steel arch bridge, declared a historic landmark for its unique engineering style.  One of the oldest wooden-hulled tugboats still afloat, the Arthur Foss'', is moored near the base of Queen Anne. Queen Anne Boulevard, which circles the crown of the hill, and some of the original retaining walls complete with decorative brickwork, balustrades, and street lights, are also designated landmarks. Although not located at Queen Anne and no longer located west of present-day Seattle Center, the Denny Cabin was built by David Denny in 1889 as a real-estate office and was made from trees cut down on Queen Anne Hill.\nCommunity services\nBusinesses\nAn  stretch of Queen Anne Avenue North between West McGraw and West Galer Streets serves as the spine of the central business district.

The structure, renovated in 2007, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and has been named a landmark by Seattle's Landmarks Preservation Board.\nParks and cemeteries\nThe Seattle Parks and Recreation department maintains 24 parks on Queen Anne. Kerry Park, located on Highland Drive, covers a mere , but boasts one of the most attractive views of the city, with downtown at the center of focus along with the Space Needle, and on clear days, Mount Rainier in the background.
