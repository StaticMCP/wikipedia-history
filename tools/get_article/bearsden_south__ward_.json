It elects three Councillors. As its name suggests, its territory (which has not altered since its creation in 2007) consists of the southern part of the burgh of Bearsden, with part of the boundary to the north following the path of the Antonine Wall; it also borders the Drumchapel housing estate in Glasgow – the marked differences in average life expectancy and other factors between residents living in close proximity in the two areas has been remarked upon in various studies.\nThe southern boundary is formed largely from the Forth and Clyde Canal and the River Kelvin, with other parts of northern Glasgow on the opposite banks. In 2020, the ward had a population of 13,318.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=6|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Graeme Douglas(SNP)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Simon Huchison(Conservative)\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=5|Vaughan Moody(Liberal Democrats)\n|-\n!2009\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Ashay Ghai(Liberal Democrats)\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=1|Keith Small(SNP)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Manjinder Shergill(Labour)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=1|Denis Johnston(SNP)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Andrew Polson(Conservative) / Independent\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1|Ian Gallagher(SNP)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2022 East Dunbartonshire Council election\n2017 election\n2017 East Dunbartonshire Council election\n2012 election\n2012 East Dunbartonshire Council election\n2009 by-election\n2007 election\n2007 East Dunbartonshire Council election\nReferences"
