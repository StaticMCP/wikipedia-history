It was formed in 1928 by the construction of a dam to provide hydroelectric power to the area. Management of the dam and lake was assumed by the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority on May 1, 1963. Its prominent feature is Treasure Island, a residential area that has been subjected to major flooding in 1972, 1998, and 2002. Most of it is approximately  deep, with deeper sections along the center channel of the river. It is a venue for outdoor recreation, including fishing, boating, and swimming, and is maintained at a constant level year round. Amid concerns of aging dams along the lower Guadalupe River, the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority announced that four lakes will be drained including lake McQueeny beginning Sept 16th (2019).\nFish and plant life\nThe lake has been stocked with species of fish intended to improve the utility of the reservoir for recreational fishing. Fish present in it include catfish, white crappie, sunfish, spotted bass, and largemouth bass. Vegetation in the lake includes cattail, pondweed, American lotus, spatterdock, rushes, water hyacinth, water lettuce, and hydrilla.\nRecreational uses\nDespite being entirely managed using public funds, there are no public parks or free boat ramps on the lake's shore. Many private homes line the perimeter of it. In the center is an extensively developed island called Treasure Island on which many vacation and summer homes have been built.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.gbra.org/?datapage=lkq.asp Lake McQueeney] - Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060501202313/http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/fishboat/fish/recreational/lakes/mcqueeney/ Lake McQueeney - Texas Parks and Wildlife]\n*[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/rol54 Lake McQueeney] - Handbook of Texas Online"
