Voters chose 9 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nSouth Carolina voted for the Democratic nominee, Governor Alfred E. Smith of New York, over the Republican nominee, former Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover of California. Smith ran with Senator Joseph Taylor Robinson of Arkansas, while Hoover's running mate was Senate Majority Leader Charles Curtis of Kansas.\nIn the midst of a third Republican landslide, Smith won South Carolina by a margin of 82.85%. Not only was South Carolina Al Smith's best state, it was the largest margin of victory by both Al Smith and Herbert Hoover that year, largely accredited to Southern politics being heavily Democratic and low voter turnout.\nThe sheer scale of the state's disfranchisement meant that Smith won every county in the state, which he was unable to do even in Mississippi.\nResults\n}}\nReferences"
