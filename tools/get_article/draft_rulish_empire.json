The state was founded by Ruben on 22 July 2023, after the Declaration of Independence from the Perth Empire, another micronation in the area who ultimately disappeared in July of the same year. The Second Rulish Empire is currently the strongest micronation in Perth, being at 5.0 on the micronational Military Power index, a military superpower.\nEtymology\nThe name \"Ruland\" is a portmanteau, of the founding leaders name \"Ruben\" and the word \"Land\" which means, \"Land of Ruben\". This name was adopted by his majesty during the dictator era of 2023, and is still used today to show our history as a micronation.\nHistory\nThe Rulish Empire has a strong and significant history. Ruland has been the creator and the destruction of many micronations, mostly in Perth.\nThe Creation\nThe Rulish Empire was founded by Emperor Ruben Bushell I on the evening of the 22nd July 2023. This day marked the end of the Perth empire and the start of a new nation that is influential to this day. On this day, the first draft of the Constitution was published for all citizens to read. Unfortunately, this copy of the constitution is no longer avaliable for public access.\nThe Swanicc Wars\nRuland and the Grand Duchy of Swan had been enemies from the very start. Minor border conflicts were often, and peace was never properly achieved,a the . The Rulish Empire declared war on the Grand Duchy of Swan many times, however these wars were usually uneventful and usually resulted in white peace.\nWestrali-Goofiest War\nRulish Victory\nThe Westrali-Goofiest War was a major conflict between the Rulish Empire (and Grand Duchy of Swan) against the Goofiest Republic. There were many losses on both sides during this conflict. Major physical warfare was a part of this war, and it was stuck in a stalemate for the days it dragged on. Eventually, as the resources for the Goofiest Republic depleted, the Rulish Empire gained victory. The deal was as follows: The Goofiest Republic shall be split between the Grand Duchy of Swan and the Rulish Empire, and Tristan Wilce shall be banished from all nations.\nPerth-Swanicc War\nSwanicc Victory\nThe Perth-Swanic War was a major conflict between the Perth Alliance (Rulish Empire and Vinland) and the Grand Duchy of Swan. This was the first proper war between the two powers. The Rulish attack started off strong, but resources diminished quickly, leaving the Rulish Empire in a bad position. This meant, if Ruland were to win this war, we would have to fight on a defensive front. General Seb Smith took charge of the Rulish side. Using the minimal resources that were available,, the Rulish Empire managed to push back the Swanicc forces. After many long days of fighting, Seb Smith signed for peace. The deal was as follows: Emperor Ruben Bushell shall be stripped of his power, Seb Smith shall gain all power over Ruland, the Rulish Military shall be disbanded and the Rulish Empire shall owe ~~ dollars to the Grand Duchy of Swan. Luckily, however, Seb Smith gave Ruben Bushell back power over the nation and secretly began work for revenge against the Grand Duchy of Swan.\n4th Rulish Swanicc War\nRulish Victory\nThe 4th Rulish-Swanicc War was a major conflict between the Rulish Empire and the Grand Duchy of Swan. This conflict marked the start of the \"modern\" rulish empire as it is today. Physical warfare, mostly using plastic guns, was commonly used in this war. The Grand Duchy of Swan was caught off guard by this sudden conflict, but managed to hold its ground as the Rulish Empire pushed into its territory. The Grand Duchy of Swan responded to this offensive with their counterattack, with a direct attack against the Rulish Capital, at the battle of East Ruland. Luckily for the Rulish Empire, this battle did not go well for them. The Rulish soldiers were dug into trenches and other defensive positions, which made it hard for the Swaniccs to advance any further. The Rulish soldiers pushed the Swanicc soldiers outside of the Capital, into a more dense, forested area where the battle continued in trench warfare. After hours of waiting and planning, the Rulish soldiers surprised the Swaniccs with an attack on their trench, which went very well. The Swanicc soldiers were pushed back into their capital. From this point on, only minor battles along the border would occur and both sides would push for peace on their terms, until May 2nd, 2024 when the Grand Duchy of Swan signed Rulish terms for Peace, where the Grand Duchy of Swan would be no more than a SAR in the Rulish Empire. Eventually, this SAR would fully integrate into the Rulish Empire, developing into what we now know as the State of Swan.\nWar of the Indian Ocean and the Wheatbelt\nRulish Victory\nThe USRR (Now DPRR) was originally a rebel group in the Rulish Empire, formed after a failed communist uprising in the Rulish Empire. This rebel group was originally not seen as a threat by the Rulish Empire, which was a very bad decision. The USRR picked up steam among citizens in the state of Swan and Cannington, rapidly developing relations with other nations and creating a military. Eventually, the Rulish Military started to take action. The Rulish soldiers started minor battles along, the border to slow the rebellion down, but it was too late. Other nations, such as Ploktenstein and Bayola began to support the USRR and began to provide military aid to the USRR. Soon after, attacks on the Mandurah colonies began, which started the Mandurah front. This front was a key part of the war, as it provide a lot of economic support for both sides. Rulish Soldiers first took it in the First Battle of Mandurah, the captured by the USRR in the Second, then recaptured in the Third. Eventually, in the most historic campaign Ruland has had, both sides went very far down south in the Augusta Campaign. There were many minor battles along the South-West tip of Western Australia. Still, in Augusta, at the battle of Molloy, which lastest 6 days, the third army division of Ruland created an offensive front against the USRR. The USRR were overwhelmed by the Rulish force, resulting in the re-capture of HMRS Molloy and the defeat of the USRR in Augusta. In short, the Augusta campaign was a massive success for the Rulish Empire, as it created stable economic points of intreset and military ouposts, all over South-West Australia. Back up north, on the Perth front, the 1st division had created an offensive in the Swanicc area, re-capturing most of the lost territory. Eventually, after many back and forths, the USRR signed the terms on the Rulish side which allowed the USRR to gain independence from the Rulish Empire under strict borders. Unluckily, this war was far from over. While Ploktenstein left the war alongside the USRR, Bayola still stood their ground. The Third Infantry Division went along on a campaign to the Wheatbelt, capturing many key points including the Bayolan capital in Northam. On November 3rd, 2024, Bayola signed for peace with the Rulish Empire, giving all of their land claims over to the Rulish Empire. The war was a success for the Rulish Empire, as it gave us many key areas, that we still use to this day to increase our GDP and security.\nPeaceful Era\nThe Peaceful Era (3rd November 2024 - 13th May 2025) has been one of the only time in Rulish history where we have had complete peace. Ruland has mostly focused on developing economically and politically. We have focused on our Internal Affairs and our forigen relations mostly this era.\nWar of East Perth\nRulish Empire Likely\nThe War of East Perth, between the Republics of Bayswater and the Second Rulish Empire, from the 13th of May, 2025 - current, has been the Rulish Empire's first physical war since November of 2024. The Democratic People's Republic of Ruland is heavily involved in this war. From the Rulish Empire's request, the DPRR has supported both sides of the war, fighting for Bayswater but continuing good relations with the Rulish Empire. Currently, the Rulish Empire has lauched small strike groups to take small areas on Bayswater's western borders.\nPolitics and government\nCurrent Government\nThe current government is democratically elected in each electorate. Similar to how Australian voting works, the Rulish electoral system works by having citizens of each electorate vote on a representative who they thing would most suit their needs. Whichever representative wins for that electorate will earn a seat in parliament for their party. If one party reaches a majority, or hold more seats than any other party, they will form government and their party leader, if they win their own electorates seat, will become the new Elected Prime Minister of Ruland. We do this to ensure a fair and democratic Rulish society, where no one person can rig elections and be in power. However, there is no term limit, so the EPM, if elected each time, may run for however many times they want. Terms in the Rulish Empire are 3 months long.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!colspan=\"2\" |Colour\n!Name\n!Spectrum\n!Ideologies\n!Parliament\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"=#ff1fff\" |\n|\n| United Ruland\n| Extreme Right Wing\n| Conservatism, Fascism, Rulish Nationalism\n|\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"=#0000ff\" |\n|\n| Nationalist Party\n| Conservatism, Rulish nationalism, Sustainable development\n| Centre Right\n|\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"=#ff0000\" |\n|\n| West Rulish Greens\n| Centre-Left\n| Progessivism, Democracy\n|\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"=#000000\" |\n|\n| Socialist alliance\n| Left Wing\n| Rulish Socialism\n|\n|-\n|}\nHead of state\nThe head of state is the Emperor.

We take pride in our work, constantly defending our borders and taking the quickest action against external and internal threats than any other micronation. Being a large micronation, all our borders must be secure at all times, which is why we have multiple divisions stationed at outposts along the entire border. Our armoury consists of almost a hundred weapons, all suited for any type of terrain, whether sandy, wet or humid, we have weapons for it. We have many gadgets designed to \"dig in\" to defensive trench positions, no matter what surface we find ourselves on. We have many vehicles across all areas of the military, cars, boats and even small aircraft. Each vehicle can be equipped with light machine guns, equipped with 20 3-inch plastic bullets ready for any attacks. Ruland has an incredibly high military spending, at almost 10% of our GDP being spent on military and intelligence.Ruland has been proven to beat other competitors in Perth based on strength, which is why Ruland has gained the number 1 title as most strongest military in Perth.\nForeign relations\nThe foreign policy of Ruland is to hold our values of freedom and justice and to build good relations with other micronations as well as our allies.\nUnilateral Regonition\n*\nBilateral Regonition\nThrough treaties and other alliances\n*Empire of Levinia\n*Kingdom of Avalore\n*Kingdom of Eintrachtia\n*Imperial States of Forestria\n*Kingdom of Gunaka\n*United Republic of Leskovac and Vučje\n*Federal Republic of Levland\n*Kingdom of Svetelkia\n*Republic of Norsuff\n*Republic of Pollock\n*Kingdom of Salanda\n*United Sea Bass Islands\n*Silavere\n* Kingdom of Swizasia\n*Kingdom of Golden Hill\n*Republic of Verdana\n*New Eastonstein\n* Democratic People's Republic of Ruland\n* Ploktenstein\n* Principality of Sivland\nAdministrative region\nThe Rulish Empire controls almost 30 colonies worldwide.

Getting closer to the desert, the Wheatbelt colonies are in golden wheat fields. The temperature here soars in the Summer months, going up to 45 degrees; however, in the nighttime and early morning, the temperature can get as low as the Augusta colonies. In these colonies, it is usually sunny, with some rain in the winter seasons.
