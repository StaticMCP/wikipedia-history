He was an Ambedkarite-Buddhist activist. He was born in 1949 at Old Delhi in a Jatav Dalit family.

He was a board of editors member of Dhamma Darpan and Dalit Dastak magazines. He was Delhi state president of Buddhist Society of India.\nLife\nShanti Swaroop Bauddh's name 'Shanti Swaroop' was given by B. R. Ambedkar himself. Shanti Swaroop Bauddh's grandfather Chaudhary Devidas had been associated with Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar since 1942. Shanti Swaroop Bauddh was born on 2 October 1949, when his name was kept to Gulab Singh. On 4 October 1949, Babasaheb Ambedkar suggested to change the name from Gulab Singh to Shanti Swaroop. At the suggestion of Ambedkar, Chaudhary changed the name of his grandson from Gulab Singh to Shanti Swaroop. After Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar's initiation into Buddhism, Shanti Swaroop accepted 'Buaddh' (बौद्ध, also transliterated as Buadh) name as his surname. He became a Buddhist inspired by Ambedkar.\nShanti Swaroop Buaddh inherited the Ambedkarite movement from his grandfather Chaudhary Devidas and father Lala Harichand Maurya. His father Lala Harichandra Maurya was a participant in the Ambedkarite movement. Therefore, he was associated with the Ambedkarite movement from his student days. While studying in college, he wrote on Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, Buddhism and social issues.\nIn college days, Shanti Swaroop Buaddh was involved in the 1964 nationwide landless satyagraha movement. After completing his college education, he became active in the Republican Party of India. He has been active in the Buddhist Society of India in the Delhi region since 1970. From 1971 to 1973, he was the president of the Republican Party of India's Delhi region. He was instrumental in the development of the Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Bhavan of Delhi. He decided to quit his job as a Gazetted Officer of the government and spread Ambedkar's philosophy i.e. Ambedkarism.\nList of works\nShanti Swaroop Baudh wrote 75 books in Hindi, and 43 books in English.
