The university is named after the country's second prime minister Edward Sokoine.\nHistorically, SUA traces its roots to 1965 when it emerged as a program of the then-international University of East Africa. When that was dissolved in 1970, the Tanzanian agriculture program fell under the purview of the University of Dar es Salaam. Finally, it was spun off as a university in its own right in 1984.\nSUA has five campuses, and contains five academic colleges and two schools. It provides bachelor's, master's, and PhDs in a variety of fields, many of which center around agriculture. At least two Tanzanian politicians have been affiliated with the university.\nIntroduction\nSokoine University of Agriculture was established on 1 July 1984 by Parliamentary Act No. 6 of 1984. Currently the University operates under the Universities Act No. 7 of 2005 and SUA Charter and Rules of 2007.\nHistory\nThe university traces its roots back to 1965 in Morogoro, where it initially began as an agriculture college offering diploma training in agricultural practices. After the dissolution of the East African Community in 1970, the University of East Africa, which was the only university in East Africa offering agriculture degrees in the region, was also dissolved. This led the Government of Tanzania to create a domestic institution, which led to the establishment of the Faculty of Agriculture at the University of Dar es Salaam. Sokoine Agriculture College fell under this umbrella and under the mandate of the University of Dar es Salaam, started to offer Bachelors of Science in Agriculture.\nFurther progress continued to develop in the Faculty of Agriculture; in 1974 the Division of Forestry was established and in 1976 the division of veterinary science was established. This led to the faculty's renaming to the \"Faculty of Agriculture, Forestry and Veterinary Sciences\". With growing enrollment numbers, the parliament decided to separate the faculty and create a fully fledged university to help boost agriculture growth in the country. Through Parliamentary Act No. 6 of 1984, the faculty was then transformed into a university and today is known as Sokoine University of Agriculture.\nCampuses\n|coordinates2=}}\nThe University has five campuses, namely:\n* Edward Moringe Campus (2,376 ha) in Morogoro\n* Solomon Mahlangu Campus (1,050 ha), also in Morogoro\n* Olmotonyi Campus (840 ha) in Arusha\n* Mazumbai Campus (320 ha) in Tanga Region\n* Mizengo Pinda Campus in Katavi Region (64 ha)\n* and Tunduru Campus (509 ha) in Ruvuma Region.\nIn addition, SUA has sites for students’ field practice in Mbinga, Ruvuma Region; Mgeta (Nyandira), Morning side and Kitulanghalo Forest in Morogoro Region.\nSUA has four mandates: Training, Research, Consultancy and Outreach. SUA offers training that lead to awards of certificates, diplomas, bachelors, masters, and doctorates. Non-degree programmes include Diploma in Information and Library Science, Diploma in Records, Archives and Information Management, Diploma in Animal Health and Production, Diploma in Laboratory Technology and Diploma in Information Technology.\nThe Sokoine National Agricultural Library is SUA's Library and the Tanzania National Agricultural Library. The library provides services to the university community and other stakeholders in the agricultural and related sectors.\nColleges and Schools\nThe University has five campus colleges and two schools, namely;\n# College of Agriculture;\n# College of Forestry, Wildlife and Tourism;\n# College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences;\n# College of Social Sciences and Humanities\n# College of Natural and Applied Sciences;\n# College of Economics and Business Studies;\n# School of Engineering and Technology; and\n# School of Education.\nThese colleges and Schools offers various degree and non-degree programmes which lead to the awards of PhD, Masters, Bachelor degree, Diploma, and Certificate qualifications\nStudy Programmes\nUndergraduate Programmes\nSokoine University of Agriculture (SUA) offers 39 Bachelor degree programmes, 6 Diploma programmes and 2 Certificates through Colleges, Schools and Departments.
