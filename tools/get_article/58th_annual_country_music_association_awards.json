They have been on the final ballot since 2006, nineteen years in a row.\n* Old Dominion set the record for consecutive Vocal Group of the Year wins this year with their seventh consecutive win.\n* Lainey Wilson became just the sixth woman to win Female Vocalist of the Year three years in a row. Only Miranda Lambert, Carrie Underwood, Martina McBride, Reba McEntire, and Tammy Wynette have accomplished the feat.\n* Chris Stapleton won his eighth award and extends his record as the most decorated Male Vocalist of the Year.\n* Brooks & Dunn and Chris Stapleton became the most decorated CMA Awards artists of all time with nineteen each: Brooks & Dunn winning Vocal Duo of the Year and Chris Stapleton winning Single of the Year, Song of the Year and Male Vocalist of the Year.\n* Miranda Lambert and Carrie Underwood had their nomination streak ended after nearly two decades of being nominated in every ceremony since 2005 and 2006 respectively.\nControversy\nFollowing the Country Music Association's announcement of the nominations, numerous US and international publications and music websites criticized the awards ceremony's decision not to nominate Beyoncé and her eighth studio album Cowboy Carter, as well as the lead single \"Texas Hold 'Em\", in their respective categories, despite the perceived cultural impact and commercial performance.Although, it is unclear if her music was submitted for nomination, which is how the CMA votes on nominations, much like the Grammys.\nOn September 17 in an interview with Variety, nine-time CMA award winner, country music legend, and Cowboy Carter collaborator, Dolly Parton spoke on Beyonce's apparent snub, \"She's a country girl in Texas and Louisiana, so she grew up with that base. It wasn't like she just appeared out of nowhere [...] There's so many wonderful country artists that, I guess probably the country music field, they probably thought, well, we can't really leave out some of the ones that spend their whole life doing that [...] I think it was just more of what the country charts and the country artists were doing, that do that all the time, not just a specialty album.\"\nReferences"
