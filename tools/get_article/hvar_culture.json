It is estimated to be 7,000 years old, and was uncovered alongside other artifacts such as stone axes and ornamented pottery. It is assumed the road made up a stoneway to a nearby artificial island, now also submerged, which was previously discovered in 2021.\nReferences\nSources\n* [https://www.enciklopedija.hr/clanak/hvarska-kultura Hvarska kultura] at enciklopedija.hr\n* [http://www.hvar.hr/portal/?page_id=4 Povijest Hvara]\nExternal links\n* [https://arkeonews.net/underwater-archaeologists-discover-a-7000-year-old-road-in-croatia/ Underwater Archaeologists Discover a 7,000-Year-Old Road in Croatia (Arkeonews 2023)]"
