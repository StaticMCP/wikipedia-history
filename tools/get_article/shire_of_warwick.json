The administrative centre and major town of the shire was the town of Warwick.\nHistory\nOn 19 March 1992, the Electoral and Administrative Review Commission, created two years earlier, produced its report External Boundaries of Local Authorities, and recommended that local government boundaries in the Warwick area be rationalised into three new local government areas.  That recommendation was not implemented, but the City of Warwick was merged with the Shires of Allora, Glengallan and Rosenthal to form the new Shire of Warwick. The Local Government (Allora, Glengallan, Rosenthal and Warwick) Regulation 1994 was gazetted on 20 May 1994. On 25 June, an election was held for the new council, and on 1 July 1994, the Shire of Warwick was established.\nUnder the local council amalgamation programme instigated by the Queensland Government in 2007, the Shires of Stanthorpe and Warwick were merged in March 2008 to create the Southern Downs Region.\nTowns and localities\nThe Shire of Warwick included the following settlements:\nWarwick area:\n* Warwick\nAllora area:\n* Allora\n* Berat\n* Clintonvale\n* Deuchar\n* Ellinthorp\n* Goomburra\n* Hendon\n* Mount Marshall\n* Talgai\n* Willowvale*\nGlengallan area:\n* Killarney\n* Canningvale\n* Elbow Valley\n* Emu Vale\n* Freestone\n* Gladfield\n* Glengallan\n* Junabee\n* Maryvale\n* Morgan Park\n* Mount Colliery\n* Mount Sturt\n* Mount Tabor\n* Sladevale\n* Swanfels\n* Tannymorel\n* The Falls\n* Tregony\n* Wiyarra\n* Womina\n* Yangan\nRosenthal area:\n* Rosenthal Heights\n* Allan\n* Cunningham\n* Dalveen\n* Greymare\n* Karara\n* Leslie\n* Leslie Dam\n* Leyburn\n* Palgrave\n* Pratten\n* Rosehill\n* Thane\n* Wheatvale\n* Not to be confused with Willow Vale, Queensland\nPopulation\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
