He did well the remainder of the season, with seven relief appearances without an earned run, and striking out five in 7 1/3 innings.\nSwartzbaugh's early success did not carry over into 1996 as the Cubs tried using him as a starter. He appeared in 6 games, starting 5, posting a 6.38 ERA in 24 innings of work, and striking out 13 while walking 14. The Cubs tried using him as a starter again in 1997, but he went 0–1 in 8 innings of work, which included two starts.
