Its head is an Attorney General who has deputies. DORH headquarters are in Zagreb, but it is also decentralized and is thus divided into 22 municipal and 15 county offices. Nevertheless, it is a strictly hierarchically structured body, so municipal offices are subordinated to the county offices, while county offices are subordinated to the central office in Zagreb. In addition, Croatian State Prosecutor's Office for the Suppression of Organized Crime and Corruption (USKOK) is a special body of DORH specialized in investigations related to corruption and organized crime.\nOrganization and jurisdiction\nOrganization and jurisdiction of DORH are regulated with ''The Act on the State Attorney's Office''.\nThe State Attorney's Office competent in criminal proceedings is obligated to prosecute and represent the charges against perpetrators of criminal acts which are prosecuted ex officio or upon the proposal and undertake other actions defined by the law. The competent State Attorney's Office acts in misdemeanor proceedings in line with the powers granted to it under the law. A competent State Attorney's Office represents the Republic of Croatia in the protection of assets and other rights in the civil and administrative matters, unless otherwise determined by law or the decision of a competent state body.\nThe Municipal Offices represent Croatia in the proceedings before a municipal court, a misdemeanor court and administrative bodies, County Offices represent Croatia in the proceedings before a county, administrative and commercial court, while the Central Office represents Croatia, and oversees and protects the rule of law and proceeds with all actions before the Supreme Court, Constitutional Court, High Administrative Court, High Commercial Court, High Misdemeanor Court, and international and foreign justice and other bodies.\nStructure of DORH\nDORH consist of:\n* (Central) State Attorney's Office of the Republic of Croatia (DORH)\n* 15 county State Attorney's Offices (in Bjelovar, Dubrovnik, Karlovac, Osijek, Pula, Rijeka, Sisak, Slavonski Brod, Split, Šibenik, Varaždin, Velika Gorica, Vukovar, Zadar, Zagreb) (ŽDO)\n* 22 municipal State Attorney's Offices (ODO)\n* Croatian State Prosecutor's Office for the Suppression of Organized Crime and Corruption (USKOK)\nInternal structure of the central office\nThe Central office has four departments:\n* 1. Criminal - responsible for taking legal actions against the perpetrators of crimes and other criminal activities\n* 2.

He may be reappointed to the same office numerous times, but if that doesn't happen he has a right to either leave the Office or to continue to work as a deputy attorney. County and Municipal State Attorneys are appointed for a four-year term by the National State Attorney Council consisting of seven deputy state attorneys (elected among and by them from the Office of Attorney General, from county and municipal offices), two university professors of law (chosen by the Croatian universities) and two MPs (one of whom must be from the opposition parties); with a prior opinion issued by the Minister of Justice and DORH.

A state attorney can be released from duty if he has exercised his duties in an illegal, untimely and insufficiently expert manner; the state attorney office he represents fails to achieve satisfactory results; he fails to perform the duties in a state attorney office or justice\nadministration in conformity with the regulations or fails to perform them in due time; has failed to file a request for a disciplinary proceeding in the matters determined by law; he commits an action corresponding to the action referred to under Article\n84 of The Act on the State Attorney's Office; the grounds for the dismissal referred to under Article 69, Paragraph 1, items 1 to 4 of The Act on the State Attorney's Office exist.
