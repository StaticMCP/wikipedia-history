It produces research and analysis, offers leadership and organisational development support, and organises events.\nThe Chief Executive is currently Sarah Woolnough, who was previously the Chief Executive of Asthma + Lung UK. She took up the position in December 2023.\nHistory\nFounded as the Prince of Wales's Hospital Fund for London''' in 1897, the fund changed its name in 1902 to '''King Edward's Hospital Fund''' after the accession to the throne of King Edward VII. In 1907, Parliament incorporated the fund as the King's Fund.\nGeorge Stephen, 1st Baron Mount Stephen worked closely with the future George V in building the charity's endowment fund. Lord Mount Stephen was the charity's most important benefactor, having made gifts to the amount of £1,315,000.\nThe fund was originally set up to contribute to London's voluntary hospitals and did so, which it later started to inspect and expand.\nThink tank\nAfter the NHS was created in 1948, the fund became a think tank.\nIn 1992 the influential King's Fund's Commission on London's Health Care identified high costs and lower throughput of central London hospitals and recommended reduction in acute services and parallel improvements in primary care.\nSince 1997, they have jointly funded a yearly award system with GlaxoSmithKline. They reward small to medium-sized health charities who are improving people's health.\nSee also\n*List of UK think tanks\n*Nuffield Trust\n*Health Foundation\n*Coproduction of public services by service users and communities\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
