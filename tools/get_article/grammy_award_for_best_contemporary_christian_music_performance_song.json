It was first awarded in 2015. It combined two previously separate categories in the Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music field, Best Contemporary Christian Music Song and Best Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music Performance. The new category recognizes both songwriters and performers (solo/duos/groups/collaborations/etc.) and is open for singles or tracks only. Songwriters are only awarded a Grammy Award if it is a newly written song. Grammy's for cover versions of previously recorded songs are awarded to the performer(s) only.\nAlong with the Best Gospel Performance/Song category, these mark the only Grammy categories which honor both performers and songwriters in one category.\nThese changes were made in June 2014 by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences \"in the interest of clarifying the criteria, representing the current culture and creative DNA of the gospel and Contemporary Christian Music communities, and better reflecting the diversity and authenticity of today's gospel music industry.\"\nAccording to the Grammy committee, the move recognizes \"the critical contribution of both songwriters and performers by combining  songwriters and artists into the Best Gospel Performance/Song and Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song categories.\"\nGospel performances which were previously recognized in the Best Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music Performance category, are now included in the Best Gospel Performance/Song category.\nRecipients\n.]]\n.]]\n.]]\n.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"15%\" | Performing artist(s)\n! width=\"15%\" | Work\n! width=\"15%\" | Songwriter(s)\n! width=\"30%\" class=unsortable|NomineesSongwriter(s) mentioned first (if eligible), followed by title and performing artist(s) (Songwriters who are not eligible for an award, are in parentheses)\n! width=\"5%\" class=unsortable|Ref.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2015\n|Lecrae featuring For King & Country\n| \"Messengers\"\n|Torrance Esmond, Ran Jackson, Ricky Jackson, Kenneth Chris Mackey, Lecrae Moore, Joseph Prielozny, Joel Smallbone and Luke Smallbone\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2016\n| Francesca Battistelli\n|\"Holy Spirit\"\n|Song was written (and previously recorded) by Bryan & Katie Torwalt but as this category only awards newly written songs, the songwriters' Grammy was not awarded.\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2017\n| Hillary Scott & The Scott Family\n|\"Thy Will\"\n|Hillary Scott, Bernie Herms & Emily Weisband\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2018\n| Hillsong Worship\n|\"What a Beautiful Name\"\n|Ben Fielding & Brooke Ligertwood\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2019\n| Lauren Daigle\n| \"You Say\"\n| Lauren Daigle, Jason Ingram & Paul Mabury\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2020\n| for KING & COUNTRY & Dolly Parton\n| \"God Only Knows\"\n| Josh Kerr, Jordan Reynolds, Joel Smallbone, Luke Smallbone & Tedd Tjornhom\n| for \"God's Not Done With You (Single Version)\", performed by Tauren Wells\n* Ethan Hulse, Andrew Ripp, Jonathan Smith & Zach Williams for \"Rescue Story\", performed by Zach Williams\n}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2021\n| Zach Williams and Dolly Parton\n| \"There Was Jesus\"\n| Casey Beathard, Jonathan Smith, Zach Williams and Dolly Parton\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n!2022\n| Cece Winans\n| \"Believe for It\"\n| Dwan Hill, Kyle Lee, CeCe Winans & Mitch Wong\n|\n|\n|-\n!2023\n| Maverick City Music and Kirk Franklin\n| \"Fear Is Not My Future\"\n| Kirk Franklin, Nicole Hannel, Jonathan Jay, Brandon Lake & Hannah Shackelford\n|\n|\n|-\n!2024\n|Lecrae & Tasha Cobbs Leonard\n|\"Your Power\"\n|Alexandria Dollar, Jordan Dollar, Antonio Gardener, Micheal Girgenti, Lasanna “Ace” Harris, David Hein, Deandre Hunter, Dylan Hyde, Christian Louisana, Patrick Darius Mix Jr., Lecrae Moore, Justin Pelham, Jeffrey Lawrence Shannon, Allen Swoope\n|\n|\n|-\n!2025\n|CeCe Winans\n|\"That's My King\"\n|Taylor Agan, Kellie Gamble, Lloyd Nicks & Jess Russ\n|\n* (Brian Johnson, Chris Tomlin, Jason Ingram & Phil Wickham for) \"Holy Forever (Live)\", performed by Bethel Music, CeCe Winans & Jenn Johnson\n* Brandon Lake, Steven Furtick, Chandler Moore, Chris Brown, Cody Carnes & Pat Barrett for \"Praise\", performed by Elevation Worship ft.
