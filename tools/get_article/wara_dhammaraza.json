Following this, the palace guards began persecuting monks throughout the kingdom. Economically, Arakan was already weakened due to the earlier loss of Chittagong and the extensive donations previous kings had made to religious institutions, which had drained royal resources.\nDethrone and aftermath\nThe king was ultimately dethroned by the palace guards in 1692, without having exercised real power at any point during his reign. After his fall, a series of six puppet kings followed and Arakan continued to disintegrate amid civil war and famine.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*"
