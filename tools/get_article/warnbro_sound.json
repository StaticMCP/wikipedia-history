It is a semi-circular sound,  wide with  of shore. The area was surveyed in 1837 by Surveyor-General John Septimus Roe, who named it in 1838; the etymology of the name is unknown. The Perth suburb of Warnbro is named after it.\nIn summer 2014–2015, the beach at Warnbro Sound was closed for a number of days while the state Department of Fisheries pursued a great white shark that was frequenting the area.  The impact of the department's \"catch-and-kill\" order on beach safety and scientific research was the subject of some controversy.\nReferences"
