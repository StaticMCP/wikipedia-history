The Dodda Basaveswara temple (\"temple of the big bull-lord\") is the main attraction in town; it attracts many pilgrims who are devotees of Shiva. The idol of the big bull, called Nandi or Nadeeswara, is cut out of a monolithic rock, and is  high. The annual Ratha Yatra of the deity is conducted on the Holi Purnima day, which marks the beginning of the spring season, as well as the beginning of the New Year.Every year Ratha Mahothsava of the Swamy Dodda Basaveshwara held on holy Poornima and Kurugodu Doddabasaveshara is exactly opposite to Hampi Virupaksha.\nReferences"
