The protesters, with the help of BDP MP Sırrı Süreyya Önder, initially halted attempts to bulldoze the park by refusing to leave. The Zabıta municipal police used tear gas to disperse the peaceful protesters and burned down their tents in order to allow the bulldozing to continue. Photos of the scene, such as an image of a young female protester (later nicknamed the [https://archive.today/20130615230112/http://preview.reuters.com/2013/6/4/gallery-turkeys-lady-in-red?topic=pictures \"woman in red\"]) holding her ground while being sprayed by a policeman, quickly spread throughout the media across the world. The Washington Post reported that the image \"encapsulates Turkey's protests and the severe police crackdown\", while Reuters called the image an \"iconic leitmotif\".\nAlerted to the happenings by social media, on 29 May the size of the protests grew, as additional protesters joined the encampment and put up more tents. Other prominent people joined Sırrı Süreyya Önder in the protest, including Republican People's Party vice president Gürsel Tekin, actors and actresses Gonca Vuslateri, Memet Ali Alabora, Okan Bayülgen and Şebnem Sönmez.\nOn 30 May, police raided the protesters' encampments.

The police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the protesters to surrounding areas and set up barricades around the park to prevent re-occupation. Throughout the day, the police continued to fire tear gas, pepper spray and water cannons at demonstrators, resulting in reports of more than 100 injuries. Sırrı Süreyya Önder was hospitalised after being hit in the shoulder by a tear gas canister. Some protesters threw rocks at the security forces. The executive order regarding the process decided earlier had been declared as 'on-hold' on 31 May 2013. 10,000 gathered in Istiklal Avenue. According to governor Hüseyin Avni Mutlu, 63 people had been arrested and detained. The police use of tear gas was criticised for being \"indiscriminate\". The interior minister, Muammer Guler, said the claims of the use of disproportionate force would be investigated.\nProtests also spread to Ankara and İzmir. In Ankara, a helicopter was used to fire tear gas at the protesters, and police were seen chasing demonstrators into shops with electric shock batons. Clashes between protesters and security forces continued all night long in Ankara. In İzmir, more than 10,000 people held a protest on 31 May, with demonstrators holding banners reading \"Everywhere is Taksim, everywhere is resistance\", \"Resist Taksim, İzmir is with you\", and \"Chemical Erdoğan\". Protesters in İzmir were also raided by police armed with tear gas, plastic bullets and water cannons.\n1 June\n]]\n]]\n\"About half past one the entire city [of Istanbul] started to reverberate. People were banging on pots, pans, blowing whistles,\" one eye-witness told BBC News. Deputy Prime Minister Bülent Arınç criticized the use of tear gas against demonstrators and stated, \"It would have been more helpful to try and persuade the people who said they didn't want a shopping mall, instead of spraying them with tear gas\".\nThousands of protesters from Kadıköy (the Asian side of the city) walked across the Bosphorus Bridge around 06:00 local time, to join the main protest groups in Taksim. They were met with police intervention.\nAt 3:45&nbsp;pm, the police force started to withdraw from Taksim Square, letting protesters in. During the withdrawal, some protesters threw water bottles at the security forces, which resulted in the police use of tear gas.\nThe protests in Ankara that began on 31 May continued. The protesters, gathered mainly on Güven Park in the Kızılay neighborhood, were also interrupted by the police officers. The roads to the Kızılay square where protesters tried to gather were closed by the security forces. The security around the Başbakanlık Konutu and the Grand National Assembly of Turkey were also increased with the aid of the Turkish Gendarmerie. The security forces left the Kızılay square later and then nearly 10,000 people gathered there. During these protests an armed police water cannon called \"TOMA (Intervention Vehicle against Social Incidents)\" ran over a protester that was hiding behind the police barricades.\nIn Antalya, more than 10,000 people held a protest on 31 May, in Cumhuriyet square. Nearly 1,000 people tried to walk to the Çallı district where the AKP Antalya Headquarters are situated. Police met the protesters with tear gas and water cannons.\nThe president Abdullah Gul, also a member of the AKP, cut short a formal visit to Turkmenistan to return home and by midday stated that the protests had reached a \"worrisome level\".\nSome have reported rumors of the police using a novel riot control chemical which some are calling \"Agent Orange\" against the protesters in Beşiktaş, but these are left as rumors as journalists (CNN, etc.) and experts told people that the police used a colored substance, mostly colored teargas and a colored gas to identify where the person got hit is. Though bearing the same nickname as herbicides and defoliants used by the British military during the Malayan Emergency and the US Military during the Vietnam War, the chemical used is believed to be a riot control chemical such as CR gas or the Skunk anti-riot chemical.\nHelicopters have fired tear gas canisters into residential neighborhoods and police have used tear gas to try to smoke people out of buildings. Footage on YouTube showed one protester being hit by an armored police truck as it charged a barricade.\nPrime Minister Tayyip Erdogan gave a televised speech condemning the protesters and vowing that \"where they gather 20, I will get up and gather 200,000 people. Where they gather 100,000, I will bring together one million from my party\".\nIt was also announced that Erdogan would leave for an overseas official visit to Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia and hence leave the country between 3 and 6 June during deepening domestic turmoil causing unprecedented resentment and outcry regarding prime ministerial travel expenses and purposes.\n2 June\n[[File:Taksim protests in Chicago, IL.jpg|thumb|This sign, displayed in a solidarity protest in Chicago, reads: Dear citizen [sic] [recte citizens] of the world!

Other footage also showed police firing gas grenades directly at demonstrators. It was reported that Turkey's President Abdullah Gül contacted other senior leaders urging \"moderation\". After the call, Interior Minister Muammer Güler ordered police to withdraw from Taksim, allowing protesters to re-occupy the square. Protesters \"shun violence\". Demonstrators returning to the square organized to clean the square, which has become littered with debris.\nIn the afternoon Tayyip Erdoğan raised the possibility of building a museum instead of a shopping mall in the place of the Atatürk Cultural Center and Opera house, which currently stands to be demolished in Taksim Square. This mosque was probably part of the big project for redesigning Taksim but details were unknown before.\nIn İzmir, the day started with people, who started to clean the main streets and squares, which were polluted by the protests during 1 June. People cleaned the city almost for 5 hours but as the crowd got bigger and the police has been positioned around, cleaning stopped. Soon the crowd and protests got bigger. Police used random violence to disperse the crowds, even hitting teen girls on the boulevard. İzmir's Bornova and Alsancak neighborhoods saw fierce battles between protesters and riot police throughout the afternoon, with dozens of arrests made and damage to stores in the center of town by the police's use of water cannons.

While the tension at Taksim square remained low, fights broke out between police and protesters in other neighborhoods of the city, such as Beşiktaş. Protesters repeatedly tried to get near to the office of the prime minister. Thousands of protesters went to media buildings in Istanbul, such as those of HaberTurk, that was airing an interview with the prime minister at that moment.\nParticular anger was also provoked by the sighting of several civilians armed with bats and sticks following police on their way to curb protests, apparently with police support. Several videos showed armed civilians aiding police in brutally cracking down on protesters. Some civilians in videos and photos have been linked to positions in Ak Gençlik Kolları, the youth wing of the AKP. The use of AKP members in cracking down fueled further fury against the police and resulted in a bulldozer being hijacked in Beşiktaş, Istanbul and being driven towards police positions. Although initially resulting in police retreat, the bulldozer was finally set alight in the early hours of midnight.\nOther cities where violent confrontations occurred between protesters and police were Adana and Antakya, not far from the Syrian border.\nReports emerged that the once powerful army faction that remained loyal to the secular establishment that the AKP largely watered down in its influence were distributing gas masks as assistance to protesters.\n3 June\nDuring the night riot police fired tear gas directly into the homes of civilians.

With these words he declared his support for the protesters.

Besides all the people, even some journalists were victims for random police brutality and violence usage.\nGovernment officials said that the park could now be used publicly after the violent storm-out that took place on 15 June. But since the storm-out, nobody could have entered the park and main square except the police. And before the storm-out the park and square were in public use. This speech was criticised on social media for being illogical.\nTens of thousands gathered, walked and protested mostly in Istanbul, Ankara, İzmir, Antalya, Mersin, Sinop, Kocaeli, Sakarya, Samsun, Niğde, Manisa, Antakya, Tunceli, Sivas and Eskişehir, including thousands of workers from all classes, who had declared a general strike. These protests and the strike continued throughout the day.\nIn the evening, Beşiktaş J.K.'s fan group Çarşı announced that the Abbasağa Park in Beşiktaş, was the new Gezi Park until the latter is open for public use again.

At about 19:00, he put his bag on his feet and started staring at the Turkish flags and Atatürk poster that had been put on the Atatürk Cultural Center (AKM). He remained in this pose, immobile and with his hands in his pockets, for several hours. At about 23:00, people started noticing him and after photos had been posted online, millions started supporting him. The hashtags #duranadam (\"The Standing Man\") and #direnduranadam (\"Resisting Standing Man\") were used and quickly became World Trending Topics. Hundreds of people who had organised on Twitter gathered on Taksim, to stand alongside The Standing Man. Also people from several cities like Ankara, İzmir, Zonguldak, Eskişehir, Adana, Antakya, etc. started to imitate his protest: In Ankara, a woman stood on the place where police had shot Ethem Sarısülük. For her, the hashtag #durankadin (\"The Standing Woman\") was used. In Antakya, a man stood on the place where Abdullah Cömert was shot by police. Some celebrities stood in different parts of Istanbul. In Taksim, Hundreds held hands and formed a circle around the original Standing Man. Journalist Levent Üzümcü wrote on Twitter that, if the government attacks man who is merely standing, then it's pathologically ill.\nShortly after police ordered the hundreds that had gathered to leave the area and gave them 20 minutes to go home. They warned that otherwise there would be an attack. However people remained on the square. Halk TV, Ulusal Kanal and +1 TV, broadcast the warnings and the standing protests live. Even though the crowd did not leave, The Standing Man finished standing at 02:06. He said that he needed to leave because the police was going to once again attack people who were merely standing. A man continued to stand in Beşiktaş, near Abbasağa Park and Beşiktaş Bazaar until morning. In the morning, it has been reported that some standing men have been taken in custody by police.\n18 June\nStanding protests took place in every part of Turkey, starting from the police-blockaded Taksim Square (in front of the AKM building, where the Standing Man Erdem Gündüz first started), especially including some specific spots like the place where Ethem Sarısülük was shot in Ankara, Abdullah Cömert was shot in Antakya, Mehmet Ayvalıtaş was shot in Istanbul, police officer Mustafa Sarı fell off a bridge in Adana, Trojan Horse in Çanakkale, the Madımak Hotel in Sivas (where the Sivas massacre happened in 1993), in front of the headquarters of Doğuş Media Group, owned by Ferit Şahenk (most of the channels and newspapers that the world reacted against their censored and sided media rule attached to this group), the place where Hrant Dink was shot in Şişli, Istanbul, etc.\nStanding protests took place even in the most religious parts of Turkey, for example the city center of Konya, etc.\nBeginning from the first day, standing and stopping protests also spread worldwide, supporting the act from many countries, mostly from specific points like the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Kölner Dom, Times Square, etc.\nThe government supporting-newspaper Takvim made a fake story and put it on its headline, telling that the Takvim journalist Mevlüt Yüksel made an interview with CNN journalist Christiane Amanpour and she told that CNN made all those live protest broadcasts for money. Inside the paper, Takvim put on a little note to a page telling that they made a fake story to give CNN a lesson and they confessed that the interview of Mevlüt Yüksel is not real. These events were much criticised on social media. And Amanpour tweeted \"Shame on you Takvim for making a fake headline interview with me!\", foreign reporters evaluated the news as a new example to the sided and censored Turkish media.\nA journalist working on the government-supporting newspaper Sabah, named Alper Bahçekapılı, stood in front of the headquarters of the newspaper for six hours and then resigned.

He also said seven municipal employees were suspended, as they were accused of burning protesters' tents on 30 May.\nIt was announced on 20 June that if a court ruled in favor of the Gezi Park redevelopment, there would be a referendum, in which all residents of Greater Istanbul would participate. Given strong AKP support in some of Istanbul's suburbs, a referendum on this scale, rather than in the local Beyoglu district, is much more likely to endorse the redevelopment.\n22–23 June\nProtesters gathered in Taksim Square to pay their respects those who lost their lives during protests. Thousands threw and gave carnations to the police. But soon after, the police attacked with water cannons and tear gas. Protesters chanted \"Police do not betray your people\", \"Police! Sell simit and live honourably\", \"Nothing will be thrown to the police.\" Struggle continued until dawn in the streets of Beyoğlu, Istanbul and also Ankara.\nRiot police's violent attack on thousands who just gave carnations to them and called for brotherhood, led tens of thousands to big mass demonstrations again in every part of the country. Police continued to use violence on the people.\n29 June\nBig mass demonstrations were repeated again in Taksim Square, Istanbul and also in Güvenpark and Dikmen in Ankara. Protesters demonstrated because of the release of police officer Ahmet Şahbaz who shot Ethem Sarısuluk in the head to death. The events going on in Lice, Diyarbakır were also protested. The events were protested in Cizre, Şırnak too. Riot police suppressed the protesters partially with plastic bullets and some tear gas bombs. Some protesters were detained. There was also a big police intervention in Ankara.\n30 June\n(Taksim Square), 2013.]]\nTwo major protests are held in Istanbul. Firstly, the Istanbul pride parade attracted almost 100.000 people.

The ministry applies to the Regional Administration Court to overturn the ruling of the Istanbul Administration Court which stopped the Gezi Park construction projects.\n22 July\nThe Ministry of Culture's appeal to a higher Regional Court is accepted, leaving no immediate legal obstacles to the construction plans. PM Erdoğan states that if the courts allow construction to proceed, a plebiscite can be a possibility. Can Atalay, lawyer of the Architects Chamber under the TMMOB (UCTEA), stated that; \"even a single nail can not be put in Gezi Park\", because of the rejection of current construction plans by the Istanbul Court; this requires the submission of new construction plans or a decision by State Council allowing the construction.\n30 July\nFreelance Architects Association of Istanbul(ISMD)announced a design competition on Gezi Park.\n31 July\nThousands gather in Taksim Square for a press statement from the father of the seriously-injured 14-year-old protester Berkin Elvan and demand that the government to find those responsible for Berkin's injury.\n7 September\nAfter a relatively quiet period, protests re-ignite as police attempt to enter the campus of Middle East Technical University (METU / ODTÜ) to enforce construction of a new road which would result in destruction of woodland. Protests in sympathy break out in Istanbul and İzmir.\n8 September\nPolice fire tear gas at demonstrators in Ankara's Tuzluçayır district.\n19 September\nErdogan publicly dismisses university student protests in Ankara and suggests the demonstrators should \"go and live in a forest.\"\n20–21 September\nProtesters were briefly detained in Istanbul's Besiktas district after a 'tea drinking' protest against the privatization of a ferry dock.\nAn Ankara prosecutor demands six years in prison for 45 university students who held a protest against Erdogan during the launch ceremony of a Turkish satellite in December 2012.\nODTÜ Resistance of September\nAfter a small Gezi-like city protests in Ankara's, Republican People's Party controlled central district of Yenimahalle with the attending of about 3,500 people for days to stop the construction of a stop of telfer transportation line which led about 37 trees, which are about 40 to 50 years old and were positioned on a big junction in district's center, to be cut; and after police's violent response to these protests with teargas, rubber bullets, water cannons and arrests that made the construction continue, in the last week of July, then started there the September protests of Middle East Technical University, which is accepted as the best university of Turkey, to stop an unlawful inter-province road construction that passes directly on the university's land which is an old forest, first planted by university students with some students amongst them, which were going to be important revolutionary figures later in the 1960s, which were really high-tension years for the country. The protests against the road with the attending of most students, Republican People's Party MPs and support of Peace and Democracy Party MPs, grew bigger and bigger on the university area, finding tens of thousands, making it the second Gezi of Turkey in about 3 and a half months. On that day's evening, after police's extreme use of violence against tens of thousands of students, people who came with flowers to plant in the area, citizens in the neighbourhoods near the forest area, thousands of people that walked from the city centre of Ankara, MPs and all the protesters, just like it happened in Gezi Park, made the protests of September blaze and made them spread across the whole country again with the name \"ODTÜ\" this time, besides \"Gezi\". Soon after mass protests erupted again across the nation, first deaths have arrived during the protests of September to support ODTÜ Resistance, one in Hatay and one in Istanbul, both victims of police brutality and unlawful use of teargas. The protests still continue around the country. Amnesty also made an official declaration telling whole World companies to stop selling Turkey teargas and materials like it because of the illegal and brutal use. Soon after this statement, Turkish officials started their attempts to produce teargas in Turkey directly and got positive answers on the first phase, this led to protests around Turkey and Istanbul too against this latest news on teargas usage of and production of Turkey.\nReferences"
