      "text": "# Star Wars (1992 pinball)\n\nStar Wars is a 1992 pinball machine released by Data East. It is based on the Star Wars original trilogy of films.\nDesign and layout\nWith a production run of 10,400 machines this was Data East's most successful pinball game.  It features the voice of Darth Vader, a video mode, and a rotating silver globe representing the Death Star.  On the left, above the 4 pop bumpers, is R2-D2 who can rotate and move up and down.\nGameplay\nReception\nIn a brief review CVG rated the machine at 89%.\nAn article in The Flipside appreciated the music but found the voices hard to understand. The rule of the ballsaver turning off after two switches are hit was found to be unfair. While rule development had improved over earlier Data East games, the main objective was still to get jackpots in triball (i.e. multiball).\nA semi-official update, tweaking and refining the gameplay rules was released 20 years later.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=2358 IPDB entry for Star Wars.]"
