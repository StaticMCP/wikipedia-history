Since then, an infrastructure has been developed in Belgium and Switzerland for the production of reusable learning content, including distributed storage and discovery, as well as its exploitation in structured courses. The core of this infrastructure is a distributed library of digital, reusable educational components called the Knowledge Pool System (KPS) in 2007 actively used in both academic and corporate contexts.\nEnd users interact with the KPS through client tools. Java and web applications allow users to insert documents and their associated metadata into the KPS, search for relevant documents, and download them from the KPS. Java applications interact with the KPS through the ARIADNE Web Services. The ARIADNE Web Services provide an API that hides the database access details and also enables interoperability with other repositories.\nThe ARIADNE toolset contains the following components:\n*The ARIADNE KPS Client\n*SILO, the current Indexation- and Query tool for learning objects\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060130102132/http://ariadne.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/amg/ AMG], a component that leverages existing libraries for automatic metadata generation\n*A LOM based Federated search engine, that dynamically searches [https://web.archive.org/web/20090406123320/http://ariadne.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/SqiInterop/free/SQIImplementationsRegistry.jsp other] (more learning technology oriented) search systems like Lionshare, Merlot, Edna, NIME, etc.\nThe ARIADNE Knowledge Pool System distributed learning object repository for multicultural/multilingual teachers and learner\nis accessible through [https://sourceforge.net/projects/ariadnekps/ Sourceforge].\nSee also\n*List of content management systems\nReferences\nExternal links\n* The new Ariadne project: [http://www.ariadne-eu.org/ The Ariadne project's home page]"
