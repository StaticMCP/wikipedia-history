He was a member of the Liberal administrations of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and H. H. Asquith between 1905 and 1915.\nBackground\nStrachey was the eldest son of Sir Edward Strachey, 3rd Baronet, and Mary Isabella (née Symonds). John Strachey, journalist, and Henry Strachey, artist, were his younger brothers and the Labour politician John Strachey his nephew.\nPolitical career\nStrachey was returned to Parliament for Somerset South at the 1892 general election, a seat he held until 1911, and served under Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and later H. H. Asquith as Treasurer of the Household from 1905 to 1909 and under Asquith as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries from 1909 to 1911. The latter year he was raised to the peerage as Baron Strachie, of Sutton Court in the County of Somerset. In 1912 he was admitted to the Privy Council and appointed Paymaster General, a post he held until 1915. However, he was not offered a ministerial post when the 1915 coalition government was formed, and never returned to political office.\nFamily\nLord Strachie married Constance, daughter of Charles Bampfylde Braham, in 1880. He died in July 1936, aged 77, and was succeeded in his titles by his son Edward.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
