Styled as \"an esoteric pop opera in three parts\", the album's cover art and liner notes were designed by James Spectrum.\nProfits from album sales were donated to the John Nurminen Foundation, specifically for the charity's Clean Baltic Sea project. Music for \"In the Cave\" was recorded on the Great Stalacpipe Organ, the largest musical instrument in the world.\nQueen of the Wave lyrics contain numerous references to the 1905 occult book A Dweller on Two Planets.\nPromotion\nPromotional videos were produced for the album as well as the tracks \"Go Supersonic\", \"In the Cave\", and \"A Night and a Day\". The video for \"Go Supersonic\" was chosen as a staff pick on Vimeo.\nThe group, now consisting of Finnish producer James Spectrum and Swedish composer Paul Malmström, released five album companions in conjunction with the album through their website, as well as a free iPad app.\nReception\n|rev1 = Clash Music\n|rev1score =\n|rev2 = Exclaim!\n|rev2score = (favorable)\n|rev3= Mixmag\n|rev3Score=\n|rev4 = musicOMH\n|rev4score =\n|rev5 = PopMatters\n|rev5score =\n|rev6 = Sputnikmusic\n|rev6score =\n}}\nOn the review aggregate site Metacritic, the album has a score of 70 out of 100, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nAlan Ranta of PopMatters gave the album a PopMatters Pick designation, proclaiming it to be \"the most impressive album ever painstakingly assembled across space and time.\" Mixmag's Thomas Green praised the albums eccentricities, writing, \"Pepe Deluxé's fourth album makes Queen or Kanye's madly eclectic sonic excesses look like a campfire strum-along.\" Ben Hogwood of musicOMH wrote that \"anyone looking for a return to the good old days when albums were invested with tender loving care will want to hear it.\" Clash Music also gave the album a positive review, as Anna Wilson wrote, \"Its cleverness and humour burst like springs from an overstuffed rococo couch.
