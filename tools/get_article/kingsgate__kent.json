The name Kingsgate is related to an incidental landing of Charles II on 30 June 1683 (‘gate’ referring to a cliff-gap) though other English monarchs have also used this cove, such as George II in 1748. Kingsgate is the location of Holland House built between 1762 and 1768 by Henry Fox, 1st Baron Holland, of Holland House in Kensington, which was accessed from the beach through a stone arched gate originally named Barthelmas Gate and renamed later to Kings Gate.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051112054208/http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/mss/online/online-mss-catalogues/cats/hpelham_1cat.html Letter from (T.
