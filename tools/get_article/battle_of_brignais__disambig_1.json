When Petit Meschin (who was during that time pillaging the nearby County of Forez) learned that his comrades were in trouble, he brought his men back to Brignais as fast as he could. Then, taking advantage of the heights, the night, and the element of surprise, he charged against the royal army's camp. The garrison inside the castle then joined Petit Mesquin's forces, resulting in a total defeat for the French army.\nAccording to Jean Froissart, Seguin de Badefol had the idea to dispatch the Tard-Venus forces into two groups: one in front of the royal army, and the other one on surrounding hills. The royal army, attacking the visible group, was flanked by the Tard-Venus stationed on the hills.\nConsequences\nThe French army was destroyed. Jacques de Bourbon, Count of La Marche and Constable of France, was mortally wounded, as was his eldest son Peter II, Count of La Marche. Louis d'Albon, Count of Forez, was also killed. A number of members of the French army were captured, including many lords and Arnaud de Cervole, a famous mercenary captain serving in the French ranks.\nDespite their victory, the Tard-Venus did not try to besiege the city of Lyon.\nReferences"
