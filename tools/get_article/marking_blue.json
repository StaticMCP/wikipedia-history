It is used to stain or paint a metal object with a very thin layer of dye that can be scratched off using a scriber or other sharp instrument to reveal a bright, yet very narrow line in the metal underneath.\nComposition\nMarking blue is made by mixing methylated spirits with shellac and gentian violet.\nAlternatives\nA felt tip marker can be used as they are convenient and tend not to dry up as quickly. On rough structures, such as castings or forgings, whitewash or a mixture of chalk and water can be used. A solution of copper sulfate, distilled water, and a few drops of sulfuric acid can be used on machined surfaces.\nReferences"
