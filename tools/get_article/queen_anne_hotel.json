The hotel is a historic 1890 Victorian mansion, in the namesake Queen Anne architectural style, and decorated in the painted lady style. It was originally a girl's boarding school. It narrowly survived the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.\nHaunting\nThe hotel is a popular site for ghost hunting. The headmistress of the former finishing school, Mary Lake, is said to haunt her former office in Room 410. The hotel's paranormal history was explored in an episode of the television show Haunted Hotels.\nSee also\n*List of hotels in San Francisco\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
