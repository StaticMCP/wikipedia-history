The term is derived from the original French Gendarmerie unit. Several other countries also have adopted the term and have active guard units. Republican Guards may be purely ceremonial units providing close protection to heads of states during functions and parades or be full time protective security units.\nActive republican guard units\n*  Albanian Republican Guard\n*  Algerian Republican Guard\n*  Congolese Republican Guard — Protects President Félix Tshisekedi of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n*  Egyptian Republican Guard\n*  Ethiopian Republican Guard\n*  French Republican Guard — The original Republican Guard, serves as an honor guard and defends Paris.
