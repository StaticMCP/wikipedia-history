The program is run from the Newark Museum in Newark, New Jersey, United States.\nHistory\nIn 1995, the Science Explorer's Program was the recipient of a start-up grant under the YouthAlive! Project, a national initiative, funded by the DeWitt Wallace Reader's Digest Fund in partnership with the Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC). The initiative called for the development of programs in museums that could provide positive work and learning opportunities for young people.\nThe Newark Museum Explorers Program is also a recipient of a grant provided by the Rivendell Foundation.\nMeetings and workshops\nExplorers meet regularly for workshops, meetings and training sessions prior to each festival. Workshops offered in the past includes public speaking workshops, financial literacy workshops, glass art workshops, etiquette workshops, animation workshops, mural painting, soap and candle making workshops.\nReferences"
