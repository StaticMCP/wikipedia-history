His character is then threatened by a snake, under the presumed influence of Harry (who communicated in Parseltongue), and is later found petrified. Although Randell's character, a member of Dumbledore's Army, features over the course of the book series, Randell himself only appeared in the films once during the series, and the fate of the character in the film series is unknown.\nRandell was also a member and bassist for the vocal group The Swingles from 2012 to 2022. He is also a freelance journalist, holding a degree in Magazine Journalism from City University London.\nFilmography\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Title\n! Role\n!
