The Japanese word \"go\" has also been translated to mean the \"second one;\" and in some older sources, this emperor may be identified as \"Suzaku, the second\" or as \"Suzaku II.\"\nBiography\nBefore his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (his imina) was Atsunaga-shinnō (敦良親王).\nHis father was Emperor Ichijō.  His mother was Fujiwara no Akiko/Shōshi (藤原彰子), the daughter of Fujiwara no Michinaga (藤原道長).  He was the younger brother and heir to Emperor Go-Ichijō.\nGo-Suzaku had five Empresses and seven Imperial children.\nEvents of Go-Suzaku's life\n* May 15, 1036 (Chōgen 9, 17th day of the 4th month) : In the 9th year of Emperor Go-Ichijō's reign (後一条天皇九年), he died; and the succession (‘‘senso’’) was received by his younger brother.\n* 1036 (Chōgen 9, 7th month): Emperor Go-Suzaku is said to have acceded to the throne (‘‘sokui’’).\n* February 5, 1045 (Kantoku 2, 16th day of the 1st month): Emperor Go-Suzaku abdicated.\n* February 7, 1045 (Kantoku 2, 18th day of the 1st month): The former-Emperor Go-Suzaku ordained as a Buddhist monk and died the same day at the age of 37.  His reign has lasted nine years—five in the nengō Chōryaku, four in Chōkyu, and 2 in Kantoku.\nDecorative emblems (kiri) of the Hosokawa clan are found at Ryōan-ji.\nGo-Suzaku is amongst six other emperors entombed near what had been the residence of [[Hosokawa Katsumoto before the Ōnin War.]]\nThe actual site of Go-Suzaku's grave is unknown.  This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (misasagi) at Kyoto.\nThe Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Go-Suzaku's mausoleum.  It is formally named Enjō-ji no misasagi.\nGo-Suzaku is buried amongst the \"Seven Imperial Tombs\" at Ryōan-ji Temple in Kyoto.\nThe specific mound which commemorates the Hosokawa Emperor Go-Suzaku is today named Shu-zan.\nThe emperor's burial place would have been quite humble in the period after Go-Suzaku died.\nThese tombs reached their present state as a result of the 19th century restoration of imperial sepulchers (misasagi) which were ordered by Emperor Meiji.\nThe final resting place of Emperor Go-Suzaku's consort, Teishi Nai-shinnō (1013–1094), is here as well.\nKugyō\nis a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court's actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.\nIn general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.  These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.  During Go-Suzaku's reign, this apex of the Daijō-kan included:\n* Sadaijin, Fujiwara Yorimichi, 992–1074.\n* Udaijin, Fujiwara Sanesuke, 957–1046.\n* Nadaijin, Fujiwara Norimichi, 997–1075.\n* Dainagon\nEras of Go-Suzaku's reign\nThe years of Go-Suzaku's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or nengō.\n* Chōgen      (1028–1037)\n* Chōryaku  (1037–1040)\n* Chōkyū      (1040–1044)\n* Kantoku            (1044–1046)\nConsorts and children\n*Crown Princess (died before Emperor's accession):  (藤原嬉子; 1007-1025), Fujiwara no Michinaga‘s 6th daughter\n** First Son: Imperial Prince Chikahito (親仁親王) later Emperor Go-Reizei\n*Empress (Kōgō): Imperial Princess Teishi (禎子内親王; 1013–1094) later Yōmeimon’in (陽明門院), Emperor Sanjō‘s 3rd daughter\n** First Daughter: Imperial Princess Nagako/Ryōshi (良子内親王, 1029–1077) – Saiō at Ise Shrine 1036–1045 (Ippon-Jusangū, 一品准三宮)\n** Second daughter: Imperial Princess Yoshiko/Kenshi (娟子内親王, 1032–1103) – Saiin at Kamo Shrine 1036–1045, later married Minamoto Toshifusa\n** Second Son: Imperial Prince Takahito (尊仁親王) later Emperor Go-Sanjo\n*Empress (Chūgū): Fujiwara no Genshi (藤原嫄子; 1016–1039), Imperial Prince Atsuyasu's daughter and Fujiwara no Yorimichi‘s adopted daughter\n**Third Daughter: Imperial Princess Sukeko/Yūshi (祐子内親王; 1038–1105) – (Sanpon-Jusangū, 三品准三宮)\n** Fourth Daughter: Imperial Princess Miwako/Baishi (禖子内親王; 1039–1096) (Rokujō Saiin, 六条斎院) – Saiin at Kamo Shrine 1046–1058\n*Consort (Nyōgo): Fujiwara no Nariko/Seishi (藤原生子; 1014–1068), Fujiwara no Norimichi‘s eldest daughter\n*Consort (Nyōgo): Fujiwara no Nobuko/Enshi (藤原延子; 1016–1095), ‘s 2nd daughter\n** Fifth Daughter: Imperial Princess Masako/Seishi (正子内親王; 1045–1114) (Oshinokōji-Saiin, 押小路斎院) – Saiin at Kamo Shrine 1058–1069\nAncestry\n|1= 1.
