He succeeded his father as third Baron Kensington in 1852 but as this was an Irish peerage it did not entitle him to a seat in the House of Lords. Kensington served in the Royal Navy and achieved the rank of captain. He was also Lord Lieutenant of Pembrokeshire.\nLord Kensington married Laura Jane Ellison, daughter of Cuthbert Ellison, in 1833. He died in January 1872, aged 70, and was succeeded in the barony by his son William, who became a Liberal politician.\nSee also\n*\nReferences\n*Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors).
