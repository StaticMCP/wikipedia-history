Party rules stipulated that the SKM Central Committee elected the president. Moreover, the Central Committee was empowered to remove the president. The president served ex officio as a member of the Presidency of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (LCY) and of the SRM Presidency. To be eligible to serve, the president had to be a member of the Presidency of the SKM Central Committee. The 8th SKM Congress instituted a two-year term limits for officeholders.\nThe office traces its lineage back to the office of \"Secretary of the Regional Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia in Macedonia\", established on 8 September 1939. This body had no distinct rights and was under the jurisdiction of the Yugoslav Central Committee. On 19 March 1943, the Regional Committee transformed itself into the Communist Party of Macedonia and elected Lazar Koliševski as \"Secretary of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Macedonia\". The LCY 6th Congress on 2–7 November 1952, renamed the party League of Communists, and the Macedonian republican branch followed suit and changed its name to League of Communists of Macedonia. On 4 October 1966, the 5th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the LCY 8th Congress abolished the office of General Secretary at the national level and replaced with the office of President. The SKM Central Committee convened a meeting in 1966 that abolished the office of secretary and established the \"President of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Macedonia\". The reforms passed by the LCY Central Committee plenum strengthened the powers of the republican branches and gave more powers to the Macedonian party leader. The 8th SKM Congress introduced another set of reforms on 8 May 1982, which abolished the existing office and replaced it with the \"President of the Presidency of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Macedonia\". This office was retained until 20 April 1991, when the party changed its name to the \"Social Democratic Union of Macedonia\" on 20 April 1991.\nOffice history\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! scope=col | Title\n! scope=col | Established\n! scope=col | Abolished\n! scope=col | Established by\n|-\n| Secretary of the Regional Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia in Macedonia\n| align=\"center\" | 8 September 1939\n| align=\"center\" | 19 March 1943\n| Central Committee of the 4th Congress of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia\n|-\n| Secretary of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of MacedoniaMacedonian: Секретар на ЦК на Сојузот на комунистите на Македонија\n| align=\"center\" | 19 March 1943\n| align=\"center\" | 12 November 1966\n| 1st Congress of the Communist Party of Macedonia\n|-\n| President of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of MacedoniaMacedonian: Претседател на Централниот комитет на Сојузот на комунистите на Македонија\n| align=\"center\" | 12 November 1966\n| align=\"center\" | 8 May 1982\n| ?
