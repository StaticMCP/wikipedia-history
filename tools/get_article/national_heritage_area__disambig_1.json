There are currently 62 NHAs, some of which use variations of the title, such as National Heritage Corridor.\nNational Heritage Areas are neither National Park Service units or federally owned or managed land. NHAs are usually administered by state governments, non-profit organizations or other private corporations, referred to as \"local coordinating entities\". The National Park Service provides an advisory role and limited technical, planning and financial assistance, in a form of Public–private partnership.\nEach area has its own authorizing legislation and a set of unique resources and goals. Areas considered for designation must have specific elements. First, the landscape must be a nationally unique natural, cultural, historic, or scenic resource. Second, when the related sites are linked, they must tell a unique story about the U.S. NHAs may often geographically overlap each other, and may also overlap portions or entireties of federally owned or managed land, National Park Service units and other protected areas. To date, more total NHAs, as well as more total acreage of land, have been designated east of the Mississippi River.\nLegislative history\nThe first NHA created, the Illinois and Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor, located in Illinois, was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan on August 21, 1984.\nThe National Heritage Areas Act of 2006 designated ten new NHAs and authorized three studies of potential NHAs. It was signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 12, 2006.\nThe Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 designated ten new NHAs. The bill was signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 30, 2009.\nThe John D. Dingell Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act of 2019 laid out procedures for planning and management of NHAs and designated six new NHAs. It was signed into law by President Donald Trump on March 12, 2019.\nThe National Heritage Area Act of 2022 established a National Heritage Area System and created a standardized process for the Department of the Interior to provide financial and technical assistance to NHAs. The law also provides a process for the study and designation of new NHAs and evaluation for existing NHAs. It authorized three studies of potential NHAs and established seven new NHAs. The bill was passed by the Senate on December 20, 2022 by unanimous consent and the House on December 22 (on a vote of 326-95), and was signed into law by President Joe Biden on January 5, 2023.\nList of National Heritage Areas\nCurrent\nThere are 62 National Heritage Areas, listed below with their respective local coordinating entity:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!Area\n!State(s)\n!Designation Date\n!Local Coordinating Authority\n!Notes\n|-\n|Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area\n|Illinois\n|\n|Looking for Lincoln Heritage Coalition\n|\n|-\n|Alabama Black Belt National Heritage Area\n|Alabama\n|\n|Center for the Study of the Black Belt at the University of West Alabama\n|\n|-\n|Appalachian Forest National Heritage Area\n|West Virginia and Maryland\n|\n|Appalachian Forest Heritage Area, Inc.\n|\n|-\n|Arabia Mountain National Heritage Area\n|Georgia\n|\n|Arabia Mountain Heritage Area Alliance\n|\n|-\n|Atchafalaya National Heritage Area\n|Louisiana\n|\n|Louisiana Office of Tourism, Louisiana Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism\n|\n|-\n|Augusta Canal National Heritage Area\n|Georgia\n|\n|Augusta Canal Authority\n|\n|-\n|Baltimore National Heritage Area\n|Maryland\n|\n|City of Baltimore\n|\n|-\n|Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor\n|Massachusetts/Rhode Island\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Blue Ridge National Heritage Area\n|North Carolina\n|\n|Blue Ridge National Heritage Area Partnership\n|\n|-\n|Bronzeville – Black Metropolis National Heritage Area\n|Illinois\n|\n|Black Metropolis National Heritage Area Commission\n|\n|-\n|Cache La Poudre River Corridor National Heritage Area\n|Colorado\n|\n|Poudre Heritage Alliance\n|\n|-\n|Cane River National Heritage Area\n|Louisiana\n|\n|Cane River National Heritage Area Commission\n|\n|-\n|Champlain Valley National Heritage Area\n|New York/Vermont\n|\n|Champlain Valley National Heritage Partnership\n|\n|-\n|Crossroads of the American Revolution National Heritage Area\n|New Jersey\n|\n|Crossroads of the American Revolution Association\n|\n|-\n|Delaware and Lehigh National Heritage Corridor\n|Pennsylvania\n|\n|Delaware and Lehigh National Heritage Corridor, Inc.\n|\n|-\n|Downeast Maine National Heritage Area\n|Maine\n|\n|Sunrise County Economic Council\n|\n|-\n|Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor\n|New York\n|\n|Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor\n|\n|-\n|Essex National Heritage Area\n|Massachusetts\n|\n|Essex National Heritage Commission\n|\n|-\n|Freedom's Frontier National Heritage Area\n|Kansas/Missouri\n|\n|Partnership Team\n|\n|-\n|Freedom's Way National Heritage Area\n|Massachusetts/New Hampshire\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Great Basin National Heritage Area\n|Nevada/Utah\n|\n|Great Basin Heritage Area Partnership\n|\n|-\n|Gullah-Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor\n|Florida/Georgia/North Carolina/South Carolina\n|\n|Gullah Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor Commission\n|\n|-\n|Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area\n|New York\n|\n|Hudson River Valley Greenway\n|\n|-\n|Illinois & Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor\n|Illinois\n|\n|[https://iandmcanal.org/ Canal Corridor Association]\n|\n|-\n|John H.
