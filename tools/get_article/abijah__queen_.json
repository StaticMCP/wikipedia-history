      "text": "# Abijah (queen)\n\nAbijah is a person named in the Old Testament. She was the daughter of a Zachariah, possibly Zachariah the son of Jeberechiah (2 Chronicles 29:1; compare Book of Isaiah 8:2), and afterwards the wife of King Ahaz (reigned c. 732 - 716 BCE) and mother of King Hezekiah (reigned c. 715-686 BCE). She is also called Abi (2 Kings 18:2).\nSome writers consider Abijah to be the almah or \"young woman\" (at the time of the prophecy) in the Immanuel prophecy in Isaiah 7:14, and that the child who will be an infant when Rezin and Pekah are defeated by Tiglath-Pileser III (reigned 745–727 BCE) may be the future heir, Hezekiah.\nReferences"
