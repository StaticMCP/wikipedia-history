The 2011–2012 Saudi Arabian protests are a series of ongoing protests taking place in Saudi Arabia, which began in January 2011, influenced by concurrent protests in the region.\nA protest for labour rights took place in Riyadh on 14 January and a sit-in calling for the Syrian Ambassador to be expelled occurred on 5 February in Jeddah.\nProtests in the Qatif region continued from January to May, with security forces arresting medical personnel. Security forces shot dead Issam Mohamed Abu Abdallah in al-Awamiyah on 12 or 13 January, Munir al-Midani and Zuhair al-Said on 9 and 10 February. In the 70,000 strong funeral for Abdallah on 16 January in al-Awamiyah and the daily Qatif region protests that followed, protestors chanted slogans against the House of Saud and Minister of Interior, Nayef, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. In mid-February, two medical personnel were arrested for having clandestinely treated injured protestors. In a 10 February protest and a 13 February funeral, an effigy of Nayef was thrown at tanks and participants described Nayef as a \"terrorist\", \"criminal\" and \"butcher\". Police described two of the fatal shootings as responses to unidentified gunmen who had shot first.\nManal al-Sharif and Samar Badawi, active in the women to drive movement, announced that they had filed lawsuits against Saudi authorities in the Grievances Board, a non-Sharia court, because of the rejection of their driving licence applications. As of the end of June 2012, 100 Saudi women had started driving regularly since the June 2011 campaign launch. Women university students protested in King Khalid University in Abha in March and were attacked by security forces, leading to one death. Other university protests followed in Taibah University in Medina and Tabuk University in March and April.\nJanuary 2012\nearly January\nOn 6 January 2012, about two hundred people protested in Qatif against the Saudi government and in support of Bahrainis.\n12–13 January\nLate on 12 January or at dawn on 13 January, during demonstrations calling for the \"release of political detainees, reform and an end to sectarian discrimination\", Issam Mohamed Abu Abdallah was killed by security forces in al-Awamiyah after demonstrators threw stones at them according to Al Jazeera English and BBC News. The Saudi Ministry of Interior said that a security vehicle had been attacked by petrol bombs and caught fire, and that while dealing with the fire, security forces were shot at and responded. Amnesty International called for an independent investigation into the killing. Amnesty International said that the killing of four protestors by Saudi security forces in November 2011 had not been investigated despite promises by the authorities.\nOn 13 January, hundreds of protestors gathered in response to Issam Mohamed Abu Abdallah's death. Videos of the protests were distributed on Facebook, showing protestors chanting, \"We will not forget you, o martyrs.\"\n14 January\nOn 14 January, protests calling for labor rights and opposing corruption took place in Riyadh in front of the ministries of health and employment. One Saudi security force member was shot and wounded by unknown attackers on 14 January in the Qatif region. The Guardian suggested that this could have been related to protestors using violence because of the apparent ineffectiveness of peaceful protests, but that it was unclear if the shooting was related to the political protests. Saudi attributed the attacks to protestors on 24 January.\n16–22 January\nOn 16 January, 70,000 mourners accompanied Issam Mohamed Abu Abdallah's body in a funeral procession in al-Amawiyah. Mourners chanted slogans against the House of Saud and against late Minister of Interior, Nayef, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, including \"Down with Al Saud\", \"Down with Nayef\" and \"Nayef, you are responsible of killing the martyr\".

They chanted slogans against the House of Saud.\nTwo Saudi security force members were wounded by unidentified attackers on 18 or 20 January.
