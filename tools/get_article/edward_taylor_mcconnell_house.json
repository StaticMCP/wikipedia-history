It is a two-story wood-frame structure, built in 1869 for use as a school and Masonic lodge.  It was enlarged in 1876 for conversion to a private residence, and given Folk Victorian style, notably in the delicate spindlework of its front porch.  The latter work was done for Edward Taylor McConnell, a prominent local businessman and figure in the Brooks-Baxter War.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Johnson County, Arkansas\nReferences"
