According to their function in a sentence, their form changes to one of the five cases (nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive, or dative). The set of forms that a noun will take for each case and number is determined by the declension that it follows.\nCases\nThe five cases of Ancient Greek each have different functions.\nNominative\nThe Ancient Greek nominative, like the Proto-Indo-European nominative, is used for the subject and for things describing the subject (predicate nouns or adjectives):\n*\n:\n: \"For Socrates was wise and just.\"\nVocative\nThe vocative is used for addressing people or things. It is frequently the same as the nominative in the singular and always the same in the plural.\n*\n:\n: \"What you say is true, Socrates.\"\nAccusative\nThe accusative is used for the object of a verb, and also after prepositions. After prepositions it is often used for the destination of motion:\n*\n:\n: \"They send messengers to Crete.\"\nGenitive\nThe Ancient Greek genitive can often be translated with the preposition \"of\" or the English possessive case:\n*\n:\n:\"The wife of Caesar.\"\nIt is also used after prepositions, especially those which mean \"from\":\n*\n:\n:\"He went away from the market-place.\"\nDative\nThe Ancient Greek dative corresponds to the Proto-Indo-European dative, instrumental, or locative. When it corresponds to the dative, it expresses the person or thing that is indirectly affected by an action, and can often be translated with the prepositions \"to\" or \"for\":\n*\n:\n: \"He tells the oracle to Socrates.\"\nWhen the dative corresponds to the Proto-Indo-European instrumental, it expresses the thing with which something is done, and can often be translated by the preposition \"with\":\n*\n:\n: \"He was hitting me with stones.\"\nWhen the dative corresponds to the Proto-Indo-European locative case (this is often the case when it is used with prepositions), it expresses location (sometimes figuratively) or time, and can often be translated by \"in\", \"at\", or \"on\":\n*\n:\n: \"In the third year they came to an agreement with the Athenians.\"\nThe dative is also frequently used after prepositions, such as  () \"in\":\n*\n:\n: \"He died in the battle.\"\nDeclension\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right;\"\n|+\n! declension,meaning || number || strong cases:nominative, accusative || weak cases:genitive, dative\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | first declension:\n|  ||  ||\n|-\n|  ||  ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | second declension:\n|  ||  ||\n|-\n|  ||  ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | third declension:\n|  ||  ||\n|-\n|  ||  ||\n|}\nAccent of strong and weak cases\nFor first- and second-declension nouns accented on the ultima and third-declension nouns with a single-syllable stem, the strong cases (nominative and accusative) have one type of accent, and the weak cases (genitive and dative) have another.\nSpecifically, the first- and second-declension nouns have acute (´) in the strong cases, but circumflex (ˆ) in the weak cases. Third-declension nouns have the accent on the stem in the strong cases, but the ending in the weak cases.\nBoth of these patterns can be summarized by a single rule suggested by Paul Kiparsky: pre-ending accent in the strong cases and post-stem accent in the weak cases.\nFor first- and second-declension nouns, Kiparsky's rule is more complex. The thematic vowel ( or ) counts as neither stem nor ending, but alternates between the two depending on which accent is considered. For post-stem accent, it counts as part of the ending; for pre-ending accent, it counts as part of the stem.\nGreek definite article\n{| class=\"wikitable polytonic\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |\n! colspan=\"9\" |\"the\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | singular\n! colspan=\"3\" | dual\n! colspan=\"3\" | plural\n|-\n!  !!  !!  !!  !!  !!  !!  !!  !!\n|-\n! nominative\n|  ||  || rowspan=\"2\"|  || rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"3\"|  ||  ||  || rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n! accusative\n|  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n! genitive\n|  ||  ||  || rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"3\"|  || colspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n! dative\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|}\nFirst declension\nThe first declension or alpha declension is considered thematic, with long alpha () at the end of the stem, though it is derived from original athematic Indo-European forms. In Attic Greek, this changes to  everywhere except after  or . The first declension includes mostly feminine nouns, but also a few masculine nouns, including agent nouns in , patronyms in , and demonyms.\nThe first-declension genitive plural always takes a circumflex on the last syllable. In Homeric Greek the ending was  () or  (through shortening from *).  was contracted to  in Attic.\nFeminine long a-stem\n{| class=\"wikitable polytonic\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\" |\n! colspan=\"12\" | feminine:\n|-\n! colspan=\"9\" |\n! colspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | \"country\"\n! colspan=\"3\" | \"goddess\"\n! colspan=\"3\" | \"house\"\n! colspan=\"3\" | \"voice\"\n|-\n!  !!  !!  !!  !!  !!  !! !!  !!  !!  !!  !!\n|-\n! nominative\n| rowspan=\"2\"| || rowspan=\"3\"| || rowspan=\"2\"| || rowspan=\"2\"| || rowspan=\"3\"| || rowspan=\"2\"| || rowspan=\"2\"| || rowspan=\"3\"| || rowspan=\"2\"| || rowspan=\"2\"| || rowspan=\"3\"| || rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n! vocative\n|-\n! accusative\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n! genitive\n|  || rowspan=\"2\"| ||  ||  || rowspan=\"2\"| ||  ||  || rowspan=\"2\"| ||  ||  || rowspan=\"2\"| ||\n|-\n! dative\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|}\nFeminine short a-stem\nSome nouns have short  in the nominative, vocative and accusative singular, but are otherwise identical to other feminine first-declension nouns. They are recessively accented, i.e. the accent retreats as far left as the rules of Greek accentuation allow.\nMost nouns in this category were formed with the suffix  (sometimes written ). The  (representing the semivowel ) undergoes one of several sound changes with the consonant at the end of the stem:\n*  > , Attic  \"tongue\" (palatalization; compare  \"point\")\n*  >  \"portion\" (metathesis; compare )\n*  >  \"bridge\" (compensatory lengthening of  after loss of )\n* PIE  > Proto-Greek  >  > Attic Greek  \"truth\" (assimilation of  to ; compare  \"something true\")\n{| class=\"wikitable polytonic\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\"|\n! colspan=\"6\" | feminine:\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |\n! colspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |  ()\"truth\"\n! colspan=\"3\" |  ()\"tongue\"\n|-\n!  !!  !!  !!  !!  !!\n|-\n! nominative\n| rowspan=\"2\"| || rowspan=\"3\"| || rowspan=\"2\"| || rowspan=\"2\"| || rowspan=\"3\"| || rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n! vocative\n|-\n! accusative\n|  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n! genitive\n|  || rowspan=\"2\"| ||  ||  || rowspan=\"2\"| ||\n|-\n! dative\n|  ||  ||  ||\n|}\nMasculine a-stem\nMasculine first-declension nouns end in  or  in Attic. Homer retains the older masculine ending  and uses  \"sailor\" instead of : compare Latin .\nThe masculine genitive singular ending comes from the second declension. Homeric Greek uses  or .\n{| class=\"wikitable polytonic\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\" |\n! colspan=\"6\" | masculine:\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |\n! colspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | \"young man\"\n! colspan=\"3\" | \"creative artist\"\n|-\n!  !!  !!  !!  !!  !!\n|-\n! nominative\n|  || rowspan=\"3\" |  || rowspan=\"2\" |  ||  || rowspan=\"3\" |  || rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n! vocative\n|  ||\n|-\n! accusative\n|  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n! genitive\n|  || rowspan=\"2\" |  ||  ||  || rowspan=\"2\" |  ||\n|-\n! dative\n|  || ||  ||\n|}\nSecond declension\nThe second or omicron declension is thematic, with an  or  at the end of the stem. It includes one class of masculine and feminine nouns and one class of neuter nouns.\nWhen a second-declension noun is accented on the ultima, the accent switches between acute for the nominative, accusative, and vocative, and circumflex for the genitive and dative. The only exceptions are Attic-declension and contracted nouns.\nMasculine and feminine o-stems\nMasculine and feminine both end in , and can only be distinguished by an article or adjective.\n{| class=\"wikitable polytonic\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |\n! colspan=\"3\" | masculine:\n! colspan=\"3\" | feminine:\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | \"person\"\n! colspan=\"3\" | \"way\"\n|-\n!  !!  !!  !!  !!  !!\n|-\n! nominative\n|  || rowspan=\"3\" |  || rowspan=\"2\" |  ||  || rowspan=\"3\" |  || rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n! vocative\n|  ||\n|-\n! accusative\n|  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n! genitive\n|  || rowspan=\"2\" |  ||  ||  || rowspan=\"2\" |  ||\n|-\n! dative\n|  ||  ||  ||\n|}\nNeuter o-stems\nIn the neuter, the nominative, vocative and accusative are the same, with a singular in  and plural in . Other forms are identical to the masculine and feminine second declension.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |\n! colspan=\"3\" | neuter:\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | \"gift\"\n|-\n!  !!  !!\n|-\n! nominative\n| rowspan=\"3\"| || rowspan=\"3\"| || rowspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n! vocative\n|-\n! accusative\n|-\n! genitive\n|  || rowspan=\"2\"| ||\n|-\n! dative\n|  ||\n|}\nAttic declension\nIn the Attic dialect, some masculine second-declension nouns and some adjectives have endings with lengthened vowels. Some nouns in this category end in , which developed from an original * by the process of quantitative metathesis (switching of vowel lengths). All second-declension endings containing  were transformed:\n*  →\n*  →\nThe placement of the accent does not change, even when the ultima is long, and all forms take an acute instead of a circumflex.\nIn these nouns, the nominative singular, vocative singular, and accusative plural are identical, as are the accusative singular and genitive plural, and the dative singular and nominative and vocative plural.\n{| class=\"wikitable polytonic\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |\n! colspan=\"3\" | masculine\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | \"people\"\n|-\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n! nominative\n| rowspan=\"2\"| || rowspan=\"3\"| || rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n! vocative\n|-\n! accusative\n|  ||\n|-\n! genitive\n|  || rowspan=\"2\"| ||\n|-\n! dative\n|  ||\n|}\nContracted second declension\nIn Attic, nouns and adjectives ending in  or  and  or  are contracted so that they end in  and .\nWhen the ultima is accented, it takes a circumflex in all forms, including the nominative, accusative, and vocative.\n{| class=\"wikitable polytonic\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |\n! colspan=\"3\" | masculine\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | \"mind\"\n|-\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n! nominative\n|  || rowspan=\"3\" |  || rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n! vocative\n|\n|-\n! accusative\n|  ||\n|-\n! genitive\n|  || rowspan=\"2\" |  ||\n|-\n! dative\n|  ||\n|}\nThird declension\nThe third declension group includes masculine, feminine and neuter nouns. It is an athematic declension that lacks the standard thematic vowels of the two thematic declensions above. This results in varied and often complex phonemic interactions between stem and ending, especially so between adjacent consonants, that often make these nouns appear to be highly irregular compared to their straightforward thematic counterparts.\nThese nouns in the nominative singular end with the vowels  or with the consonants  (). They form the genitive case with  or .\nThird-declension nouns have one, two, or three stems, unlike first- and second-declension nouns, which always have only one stem. Each stem is used in different case-and-number forms. In nouns with two stems, the stem with the long vowel is called the strong stem, while the stem with the short vowel is called the weak stem. The strong stem is found at the nominative singular, and the weak stem in the genitive singular.\n* (long vowel, strong stem: nominative singular)\n*: (short vowel, weak stem: genitive singular)\nEndings\nThe masculine and feminine nominative singular ordinarily ends in , but has no ending in some nouns whose stems end in  and , and all nouns in  (from *),  (from *),  (from *), . The neuter nominative, accusative, and vocative singular always has no ending.\nThe  of the accusative singular and plural was originally a syllabic ν. The accusative singular ending  appears after Proto-Greek consonants, and is much more common than , because almost all third-declension stems end in a consonant. When a Proto-Greek consonant was lost (ϝ, , ),  appears after a vowel, and may be lengthened to : . The ending  appears after the vowels  and : . The ending  always changes to , except in the accusative plural of , where it lengthens the preceding  by compensatory lengthening, yielding .\nA peculiar subset of this declension is used when declining foreign masculine names such as : the nominative takes a sigma, the genitive and vocative are the bare stem, the dative may receive an iota subscript if possible, the accusative receives a nu. However, other nouns in which the cluster arising with the sigma at nominative would be un-Greek (e.g. ) are instead kept undeclined.\n{|\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable polytonic\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" | singular\n|-\n! ,\n!\n|-\n! nominative\n|  || rowspan=\"3\" | —\n|-\n! vocative\n| —,\n|-\n! accusative\n|\n|-\n! genitive\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n! dative\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n|}\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!\n! dual\n|-\n! nominative-accusative-vocative\n|\n|-\n! genitive-dative\n|\n|}\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" | plural\n|-\n! ,\n!\n|-\n! nominative-vocative\n|  || rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n! accusative\n|\n|-\n! genitive\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n! dative\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n|}\n|}\nConsonant-stems\nThese nouns end in  (). Based on the last letter of the stem, they are divided into two categories:\nThe mute-stem nouns have stems ending in  (velar-stem nouns),  (labial-stem nouns),  (dental-stem nouns).\nThe semi mute-stem nouns have stems ending in  (nasal-stem nouns),  (liquid-stem nouns),  (sibilant-stem nouns).\nNominative singular  and dative plural  cause pronunciation or spelling changes, depending on the consonant at the end of the stem.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! !! consonantat end ofstem !! nominativesingular,dativeplural\n|-\n!
