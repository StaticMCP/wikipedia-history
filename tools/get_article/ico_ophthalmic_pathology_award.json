The award, which presently amounts to 20,000 USD, is presented during the opening ceremony of the World Ophthalmology Congress. It is said to recognize \"outstanding research in the field of ophthalmic pathology.\"\nThe award is sponsored by the Gottfried und Lieselotte Naumann-Stiftung and is administered with the support and cooperation of the German Ophthalmological Society. Candidates can be recommended by scientific societies and may also submit their applications personally whereafter an international scientific advisory board consisting of seven members will establish a triple list of candidates, ranked by priority. The final selection will be made by the board of trustees of the International Council of Ophthalmology.\nFollowing the award ceremony, the awardee will give the 'Ophthalmic Pathology Award Lecture' at the World Ophthalmology Congress and, later, the 'Naumann Lecture' at the following congress of the German Ophthalmological Society in Berlin in honour of the late professor Gottfried O.H. Naumann, the creator of the Ophthalmic Pathology Award together with his wife when he was the President of the International Council of Ophthalmology.\nRecipients\nSource: International Council of Ophthalmology\n*2022 Tero Kivelä, Helsinki, Finland\n*2018: Sarah Coupland, Liverpool, UK\n*2014: Mark Tso, Baltimore, USA\n*2010: Ursula Schlötzer-Schrehardt, Erlangen, Germany\n*2006: Thaddeus Dryja, Boston, USA\nSee also\n* List of medicine awards\nReferences"
