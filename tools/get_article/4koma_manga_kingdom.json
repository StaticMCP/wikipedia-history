Some of the most notable artists were Noboru Matsuyama, Satomi Nakamura, Ryo Sasaki, and Morita Yasuhiro. The series started gaining popularity around 1993.\nGolden Age (1994–97)\n*Super Mario 4Koma Manga Kingdom was a series competing with Super Mario 4koma Manga Theater in popularity.\n*Satomi Nakamura and Suhiro Moritaya were so popular that their art essentially made up volumes 5, 6 and 7.\n*Although the big hit of Pokémon was received from 1996 and much 4koma manga comics of Pokémon was published from the other company, only why or Futabasha has not published. This has a certain back situation which is not published, and is spoken about as it was not able to publish.\n*Although Pokémon was a huge success, the publisher Futabasha did not publish any material regarding the franchise.  This could indicate that their relationship with Nintendo had fallen apart.\n*The series declined after 1998, receiving poor reception and ceasing print of their Mario series. Their last volume, published in 2004, was based on the Ganbare Goemon series.\nPublications\n1991-1997\n*Famicom 4koma Manga Kingdom 1-3\n*RPG 4koma Manga Kingdom\n*Wizardry 4koma Manga Kingdom\n*Super Mario 4koma Manga Kingdom 1-7\n*Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun 4koma Manga Kingdom\n*Ganbare Goemon 4koma Manga Kingdom\n*Momotaro Densetsu 4koma Manga Kingdom\n*The Legend of Zelda 4koma Manga Kingdom 1-2\n*Hanjuku Hero 4koma Manga Kingdom\n*Bomberman 4koma Manga Kingdom 1-4\n*Street Fighter 4koma Manga Kingdom 1-4\n*Fire Emblem 4koma Manga Kingdom\n*Fatal Fury Special 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Hoshi no Kirby 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Mother2 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Donkey Kong Country 4Koma Manga Kingdom 1-3\n*Shin Samurai Spirits 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Battle Arena Toshinden 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*''Super Mario: Yoshi's Island 4Koma Manga Kingdom 1-2\n*Tekken 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Tactics Ogre 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Beyond the Beyond - Harukanaru e Kanaan 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Fujimaru Jigoku-hen 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Street Fighter Zero 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Vampire Hunter 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Super Mario 64 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Puyo Puyo 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Mario Kart 64 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n1998-2000\n*Baku Bomberman 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Ganbare Goemon 4Koma Manga Journey\n*Yoshi's Story 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Mario Party 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Ogre Battle 64 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Mario Party 2 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Kirby 64 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n2001 onwards\n*Korokoro Kirby 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Mario Party 3 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*The Legend of Zelda: Fushigi no Konomi 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Luigi's Mansion 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Tomato Adventure 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Dōbutsu no Mori + 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Dobutsu Bancho 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Monster Farm Advance 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Fire Emblem: Fūin no Tsurugi 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Super Mario Sunshine 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*The Legend of Zelda: Kamigami no Triforce 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Dōbutsu no Mori e+ 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Kirby Air Ride 4Koma Manga Kingdom\n*Rockman X7 4Koma Manga Kingdom 4Koma Manga Kingdom''\nReferences"
