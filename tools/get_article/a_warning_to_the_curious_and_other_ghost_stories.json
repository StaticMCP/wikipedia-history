James' fourth and final collection of ghost stories, published in 1925.\nMontague Rhodes James (1862–1936) was a medievalist scholar; Provost of King's College, Cambridge. He wrote many of his ghost stories to be read aloud in the long tradition of spooky Christmas Eve tales. His stories often use rural settings, with a quiet, scholarly protagonist getting caught up in the activities of supernatural forces. The details of horror are almost never explicit, the stories relying on a gentle, bucolic background to emphasise the awfulness of the otherworldly intrusions.\nContents of the original edition\n* \"The Haunted Doll's House\"\n* \"The Uncommon Prayer-Book\"\n* \"A Neighbour's Landmark\"\n* \"A View from a Hill\"\n* \"A Warning to the Curious\"\n* \"An Evening's Entertainment\"\nReferences\n*\n*\nSources\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*\n__NOTOC__"
