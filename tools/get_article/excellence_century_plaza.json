Built between 2007 and 2010, the complex consists of four towers with the tallest one (Tower 1) standing at  tall with 60 floors. Two of the towers serve the function of hotels, while the other two are office buildings.\nHistory\nArchitecture\nInaugurated in 2010, the building complex is situated in the Futian district of Shenzhen, in the proximity of the Ping An Finance Centre and the Shenzhen Grandview Plaza. It has a concept inspired by the number 8, which is considered the most auspicious number in the Chinese civilisation and symbolizes prosperity and good fortune. The project's podium, which anchors the four towers, is enveloped in glass and features a mix of retail, restaurant and entertainment areas.\nDesigned by American architects Leo A. Daly & Larry Oltmanns and supervised by the CCDI Group, the project features two main towers measuring 60 and 57 floors, and two secondary towers measuring 45 and 37 floors. Each building's glazing contains glass curtain walls, chamfered corners, and large diamond-shaped facades that extend and step back from the typical floor plates. The towers contain office, hotel, and serviced apartment space, with a rooftop restaurant. The project's glass-enclosed podium anchors the four towers and contains retail, restaurant, and entertainment areas. In contrast to the usual indoor malls in Shenzhen, the Excellence Huanggang Century Center includes a central courtyard that is outdoors and connects visitors, workers, and residents to the surrounding environment.\nBuildings\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable static-row-numbers\"\n!Name\n!Image\n!width=\"75px\"|Heightm (ft)\n!Floors\n!Function\n|-\n| Tower 1 || rowspan=2| ||  || 60 || Office\n|-\n| Tower 2 ||  || 57 || Hotel\n|-\n| Tower 3 ||  ||  || 45 || Office\n|-\n| Tower 4 ||  ||  || 37 || Hotel\n|}\nSee also\n* List of tallest buildings in Shenzhen\n* List of tallest buildings in China\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.skyscrapercenter.com/complex/391 Excellence Century Plaza Complex] at CTBUH\n* [https://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=24632 Excellence Century Plaza 1] at SkyscraperPage\n* [https://www.skydb.net/building/270930323/excellence-century-plaza-tower-1-shenzhen/ Excellence Century Plaza Tower 1 in Shenzhen] at SKYDB\n* [https://www.scraperbase.com/China/Shenzhen/Excellence_Century_Plaza_Tower_1 Excellence Century Plaza Tower 1] at Scraperbase.com\n* [https://www.protenders.com/companies/leo-a-daly/projects/excellence-century-plaza-tower-1 Excellence Century Plaza Tower 1] at ProTenders (Leo A.
