In the , the locality of Eurong had a population of 11 people.\nGeography\nThe island of K'gari is divided into two localities, one very small one, Eurong, and very large one called K'gari (the locality not the island, with Happy Valley its only town). Eurong is on the east coast of K'gari facing the Coral Sea about one quarter of the length of the island from its southern tip. Consequently, on the land, Eurong is completely surrounded by the locality of K'gari.\nThe coastline of Eurong is approx  of the Seventy Five Mile Beach which extends to the north and south beyond Eurong. The town of Eurong is immediately west of the beach.\nHistory\nThe name Eurong is believed to be a Kabi language word meaning rain forest.\nTimbergetting was the first industry in the area. By 1927, there was a settlement of forestry workers and their families (approximately 50 people) in the Eurong area. It was a very isolated settlement with a fortnightly steamer service to go to Maryborough for the weekend for shopping; apart from there was no communication or transport from Eurong. The housing was primitive, often not weatherproof in the rain. However, there was an excellent water supply from the creek.\nBy 1937, the settlement had developed and included a dance hall. Groups of people started to come from Maryborough and Pialba to Eurong for sightseeing, swimming, picnicking, and dancing, the beginning of the tourist industry that exists today.\nDemographics\nEurong is a tourist destination with a range of holiday accommodation. However, the Australian census only counts those people who claim the locality to be their \"usual residence\".\nIn the , the locality of Eurong had a population of 47 people.\nIn the , the locality of Eurong had a population of 11 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Eurong, nor anywhere else on the island. The alternatives are distance education and boarding school.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
