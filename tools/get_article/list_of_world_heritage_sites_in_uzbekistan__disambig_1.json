Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural heritage consists of natural features (physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty. Uzbekistan accepted the UNESCO World Heritage Convention on 13 January 1993. , seven sites in Uzbekistan are included: five cultural sites and 2 natural sites. In addition to its inscribed sites, Uzbekistan also lists thirty-eight properties on its tentative list.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (region)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Itchan Kala (Khiva)\n|\n|Xorazm Region\n|1990\n|543; iii, iv, v (cultural)\n|Itchan Kala is the inner town (protected by brick walls some 10 m high) of the old Khiva oasis, which was the last resting-place of caravans before crossing the desert to Iran. Although few very old monuments still remain, it is a coherent and well-preserved example of the Muslim architecture of Central Asia. There are several outstanding structures such as the Djuma Mosque, the mausoleums and the madrasas and the two magnificent palaces built at the beginning of the 19th century by Alla-Kulli-Khan.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Historic Centre of Bukhara\n|\n|Bukhara Region\n|1993\n|602bis; ii, iv, vi\n|Bukhara, which is situated on the Silk Route, is more than 2,000 years old. It is the most complete example of a medieval city in Central Asia, with an urban fabric that has remained largely intact. Monuments of particular interest include the famous tomb of Ismail Samani, a masterpiece of 10th-century Muslim architecture, and a large number of 17th-century madrasas.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffe6bd;\"|Historic Centre of Shakhrisyabz\n|\n|Qashqadaryo Region\n|2000\n|885; iii, iv (cultural)\n|The historic centre of Shakhrisyabz contains a collection of exceptional monuments and ancient quarters which bear witness to the city's secular development, and particularly to the period of its apogee, under the rule of Amir Temur and the Temurids, in the 15th-16th century.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Samarkand – Crossroads of Cultures\n|\n|Samarqand Region\n|2001\n|603rev; i, ii, iv (cultural)\n|The historic town of Samarkand is a crossroad and melting pot of the world's cultures. Founded in the 7th century B.C. as ancient Afrasiab, Samarkand had its most significant development in the Timurid period from the 14th to the 15th centuries. The major monuments include the Registan Mosque and madrasas, Bibi-Khanum Mosque, the Shakhi-Zinda compound and the Gur-Emir ensemble, as well as Ulugh-Beg's Observatory.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#D0E7FF;\" |Western Tien-Shan\n|\n|Tashkent Region\n|2016\n|1490; x (natural)\n|The transnational property is located in the Tien-Shan mountain system, one of the largest mountain ranges in the world. Western Tien-Shan ranges in altitude from 700 to 4,503 m. It features diverse landscapes, which are home to exceptionally rich biodiversity. It is of global importance as a centre of origin for a number of cultivated fruit crops and is home to a great diversity of forest types and unique plant community associations.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#D0E7FF;\" | Silk Roads: Zarafshan-Karakum Corridor\n|\n|Samarqand Region, Navoiy Region, Bukhara Region\n|2023\n|1675; ii, iii, iv (cultural)\n|The Zarafshan-Karakum Corridor is a key section of the Silk Roads in Central Asia that connects other corridors from all directions. Located in rugged mountains, fertile river valleys, and uninhabitable desert, the 866-kilometre corridor runs from east to west along the Zarafshan River and further southwest following the ancient caravan roads crossing the Karakum Desert to the Merv Oasis. Channelling much of the east-west exchange along the Silk Roads from the 2nd century BCE to the 16th century CE, a large quantity of goods was traded along the corridor. People travelled, settled, conquered, or were defeated here, making it a melting pot of ethnicities, cultures, religions, sciences, and technologies.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#D0E7FF;\" | Cold Winter Deserts of Turan\n|\n|Karakalpakstan\n|2023\n|1693; ix, x (natural)\n|This transnational property comprises fourteen component parts found across arid areas of Central Asia’s temperate zone between the Caspian Sea and the Turanian high mountains. The area is subject to extreme climatic conditions with very cold winters and hot summers, and boasts an exceptionally diverse flora and fauna that has adapted to the harsh conditions. The property also represents a considerable diversity of desert ecosystems, spanning a distance of more than 1,500 kilometres from East to West. Each of the component parts complements the others in terms of biodiversity, desert types, and ongoing ecological processes.\n|}\nTentative list\nIn addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. , Uzbekistan has listed 38 properties on its tentative list.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (region)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" | UNESCO criteria\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Complex of Sheikh Mukhtar-Vali (mausoleum)\n|\n| Khorazm Region\n| 1996\n|i, ii, iii (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Khanbandi (dam)\n|\n|Jizzakh Region\n| 1996\n|i, ii, iii (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Ak Astana-baba (mausoleum)\n|\n|Surxondaryo Region\n| 1996\n|i, ii, iii (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Kanka\n|\n|\n|2008\n|ii, iii, iv, vi\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Shahruhiya\n|\n|\n|2008\n|ii, iii, iv, vi\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Abdulkhan Bandi Dam\n|\n|\n|2008\n|iv\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Arab-Ata Mausoleum\n|\n|\n|2008\n|ii\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Historic Centre of Qoqon\n|\n|\n|2008\n|ii\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Ahsiket\n|\n|\n|2008\n|i, ii, iii, iv\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Ancient Pap\n|\n|\n|2008\n|i, iii, iv\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Andijon\n|\n|\n|2008\n|iii, iv, v\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Siypantosh Rock Paintings\n|\n|\n|2008\n|ii, iii\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Ancient Termiz\n|\n|\n|2008\n|i, ii, iii, iv, v, vi, ix\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Zarautsoy Rock Paintings\n|\n|\n|2008\n|i, ii, iii\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Poykent\n|\n|\n|2008\n|ii, iii, iv, vi\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Varakhsha\n|\n|\n|2008\n|iv, v\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Chashma-Ayub Mausoleum\n|\n|\n|2008\n|ii\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Chor-Bakr\n|\n|\n|2008\n|iv\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Bahoutdin Architectural Complex\n|\n|\n|2008\n|iv\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Rabati Malik Caravanserai\n|\n|\n|2008\n|i, ii, iii, iv, v\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Mir-Sayid Bakhrom Mausoleum\n|\n|\n|2008\n|iii\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Khazarasp\n|\n|\n|2008\n|i, ii, iii, iv, v\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Desert Castles of Ancient Khorezm\n|\n|\n|2008\n|i, ii, iii, iv, v, vi\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Minaret in Vobkent\n|\n|\n|2008\n|i, ii, iii\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Silk Road Sites in Uzbekistan\n|\n|\n|2010\n|ii, iii, iv, v, vi\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Tashkent makhallas\n|\n|\n|2021\n|ii, iii, v\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Silk Roads: Fergana-Syrdarya Corridor\n|\n|\n|2023\n|ii, iii, v\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Tashkent Modernist Architecture.
