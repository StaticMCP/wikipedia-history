He was a devotee of the Dwarbasini and died by Santhals at Santhal rebellion. He donated lands to allocate flowers, woods, rices, sweets, milk etc. at the village chondrapur (চন্দ্রপুর).\nFile:Dwarbasini idol1.jpeg|Stone idol\nFile:Dwarbasini vairav.png|Vairob of dwarbasini\nOrigins\nGoddess Dwarbasini is a stone idol with no image.
