      "text": "# The Vikings (radio program)\n\nThe Vikings, a radio program offering vocal renditions and light music, was broadcast by NBC during the late 1920s and early 1930s.\nThe series starred the Vikings, a male quartet under the direction of William Wirges. The group featured Richard Miller and Robert Perry, tenors; Richard Maxwell, baritone; and Charles Pearson, bass.\nTheir earliest programs in 1926 aired at 8pm on Tuesday; by 1930, they were heard on Sunday evenings. In a broadcast of October 5, 1930, the Vikings performed \"The Old Woman in the Shoe\" from the musical comedy Lord Byron of Broadway. Later that month they opened the program with \"Bye Bye Blues\". In another program, they harmonized on songs from films.\nThey should not be confused with later music groups also known as the Vikings.\nReferences"
