The Italians never attacked again leaving the Dervish to rule over the south freely.\nBattle\nIn 1912 the Dervishes received intelligence that the Italians were gradually expanding in South Somalia and were closing in on Hiraan, an area free of colonial presence. The Italians most forward positions were in Mahaday (just above Jowhar), Alongside the Italians, Ali Yusuf Kenadiid who also suffered Dervish raids sent an army to aid the Italians.\nOn March 3, 1915, the armies marched from their positions into Beledweyne. The Italians marched from:\n* -Buuloburde\n* -Buqcaqable\n* -Tiyeeglow\nThe Hobyo sultanate army marched from:\n* -Mudug\n* -Ceelbur\nThe Dervish were facing a siege from all directions that lasted 3.5 days. Under heavy artillery bombardments and fierce gun fights the Beledweyne forts did not suffer any major destruction due to Cali Jalax's great engineering skills.\nThe Italians launched a three and a‑half day siege, deploying artillery and infantry attacks against sturdily built forts around Beledweyne. Despite the sustained bombardment, the Dervish defenders assisted by strong engineering under Cali Jalax prevented major damage to their fortifications.\nThe Italians ultimately abandoned their advance, retreating from the area. This retreat effectively ceded control of Hiraan to the Dervish movement, which later fortified its position by building new forts in the region. Italian forces never launched another southern offensive, enabling the Dervishes to maintain authority over much of southern Somalia during the First World War.\nIsma'il Mire took part in the defence of the forts and recorded the Battle of Geeraar in a poem.\nReferences"
