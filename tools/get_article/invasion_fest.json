It showcased smaller and emerging Australian bands within the heavy scene that wouldn't normally have the opportunity to play such large shows or venues, alongside larger international and Australian acts.\n2012\nThe initial year of Invasion Fest had 2 events, one in February and one in November. The February event was held at Ringwood OLP, and the November event was held at the Lilydale Showgrounds shed.\nLineups\nSaturday, 25 February\n* Lovers Grave\n* Hallower\n* The Storm Picturesque\n* Glorified\n* Saviour\n* Belle Haven\n* The Ocean The Sky\n* Anchored\n* Storm the Sky\n* Graveyard\n* Surrender\nSunday, 25 November\n* Dream On, Dreamer\n* Northlane\n* Make Them Suffer\n* In Fear and Faith (US)\n* The Bride\n* Saviour\n* Prepared Like a Bride\n* Belle Haven\n* Thorns\n* Exposures\n2013\nIn 2013, the festival expanded to include the Gold Coast, albeit with a slightly different lineup to the Melbourne event.
