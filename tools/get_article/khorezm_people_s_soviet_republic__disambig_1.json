The history of this short-lived republic remains murky and the way its government functioned is not largely clear. The government officials fervently opposed the delimitation plans of the Khorezmian Republic (which had to be carried out under Stalin’s orders) but in the end they were forced to concede.\nPolitics\nPolitical leaders\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
