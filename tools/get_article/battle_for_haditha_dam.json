The battle took place between August and September 2014, as ISIS attempted to seize the strategically vital Haditha Dam on the Euphrates River.\nBackground\nThe Haditha Dam, located on the Euphrates River in Anbar Province, Iraq, is the second-largest dam in the country and a crucial source of hydroelectric power and water control. It plays a vital role in regulating water flow to cities downstream, including Baghdad. During the Iraqi Civil War (2014–2017), the dam became a strategic target for the Islamic State (ISIS), which sought to seize it for both tactical and economic advantages.\nIn early 2014, ISIS launched a major offensive in Anbar Province, capturing Fallujah and Ramadi and rapidly expanding its control across western Iraq. The group had previously seized the Mosul Dam in August 2014, raising fears that the group would attempt to use Haditha Dam as a weapon by either flooding areas downstream or cutting off water supplies. The potential destruction or sabotage of the dam could have caused widespread devastation, further strengthening ISIS's hold over Iraq.\nTo prevent this, Iraqi government forces, supported by Sunni tribal fighters from the Albu Nimr tribe, set up defensive positions around Haditha Dam. In early September 2014, ISIS launched an offensive to capture the dam, prompting U.S. airstrikes to aid the Iraqi defenders. The battle marked one of the first major instances of direct U.S. military intervention in western Iraq against ISIS.\nTimeline\n* August 2014 (Early)  ISIS launched offensives across Anbar Province, including attempts to capture the Haditha Dam.\n* 6 September 2014  U.S. airstrikes targeted ISIS positions near the Haditha Dam, including their artillery and armored vehicles.\n* 7 September 2014  Firefights broke out between Iraqi government forces and ISIS militants as ISIS advanced toward the dam.\n* 8 September 2014  U.S. airstrikes continued, hitting ISIS positions near the dam and disrupting their movements.\n* 9 September 2014  Iraqi forces and local Sunni tribal fighters clashed with ISIS militants around the dam's perimeter.
