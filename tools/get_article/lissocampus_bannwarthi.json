Their primary food source likely consists of small crustaceans and amphipods. Reproduction occurs through ovoviviparity, in which the males carry eggs in a brood pouch underneath their tail before giving birth to live offspring.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.fishbase.se/summary/46165 Lissocampus bannwarthi] at Fishbase"
