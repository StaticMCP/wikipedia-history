Only 122 people voted in the referendum, all in favor of independence.\nBackground\nThe Maryland State Colonization Society was established in Maryland in the United States in 1830. The group established the Maryland Colony in Africa on 22 February 1834. After Liberia declared independence in 1847, the desire for independence also grew in Maryland, and the settlers presented a petition to the authorities for a referendum.\nResults\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n!Choice\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n|align=left|For||122||100\n|-\n|align=left|Against||0||0\n|-\n|align=left|Invalid/blank votes|| ||–\n|-\n|align=left|Total||122||100\n|-\n|align=left colspan=3|Source: [http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&id=lr011853 Direct Democracy]\n|}\nAftermath\nFollowing the referendum, elections were held for a Constitutional Council in February 1854, a new constitution was approved in a referendum in March 1854, and Maryland declared independence as the Republic of Maryland on 8 June 1854.\nReferences"
