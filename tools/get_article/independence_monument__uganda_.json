It is 29 feet (6 meters) tall concrete sculpture located in the center of Kampala City in the King George V Jubilee gardens at Nile Avenue between Sheraton Kampala Hotel, Grand Imperial Hotel to the right, and Standard Chartered bank to the left in Uganda. This monument replaces the King George V of Britain statue which used to occupy the area.\nBackground\nThe Independence Monument was uncovered on 8 October 1962, a day prior to the day of independence of Uganda from the United Kingdom in 9 October 1962. It was unveiled by Kalule Settaala who was the minister for culture and community development of that times and other officials.\nThe monument was carved by Gregory Maloba, a Kenyan sculptor, former student and an art lecturer at Makerere University's Margaret Trowel of Industrial and Fine art from 1939-1965. The construction of the monument was financed by the British colonial government.\nGregory Maloba was born in 1922 and died in 2007 at his home in Kenya after he had fled Uganda in late 1960s when the country degenerated into chaos. While in Kenya, he lectured at University of Nairobi and Kenyatta University.\nMeaning of the monument\nThe monument is designed on a metal framework with a mother carrying a child raising the hand upwards in the sky signifying excitement and freedom in Uganda. On the monument, the mother stands firm on the ground having both legs positioned apart and straps around the legs and waist symbolizing firmness while the \"ropes\" around the legs shows the freedom from the bondage of colonialism in Uganda.\nSignificance\nThe independence monument is used on the currency notes from the paper denomination of 1000 UGX up to the 50,000UGX which is Uganda's highest legal tender and appears in many promotional materials and documents of Uganda.\nSee also\n* Sheraton Kampala Hotel\n* Grand Imperial Hotel\n* Standard Chartered Bank\nReferences"
