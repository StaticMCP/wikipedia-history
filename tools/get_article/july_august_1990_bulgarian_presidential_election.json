A new president and vice president were elected by members of the Grand National Assembly following the resignation of president Petar Mladenov on 20 July 1990 less than four months after he was elected in April. Voting took place over six rounds, with no candidate able to achieve a two-thirds majority until the sixth and final round when Zhelyu Zhelev was the sole candidate.\nCandidates\nOn 30 July Alexander Lilov stated on behalf of the parliamentary group of the Bulgarian Socialist Party that the decision to withdraw the candidacy of Chavdar Kjuranov was \"driven by the desire and the will of our party to get out of the outlined presidential crisis and today to elect president our republic.\" Lilov added that, \"we will support one of the two candidates who puts politics of national consensus above party interests.\"\nThe next day, Peter Dertliev also withdrew his candidacy.\nOn 31 July Elena Kircheva reported the withdrawal of the candidature of Viktor Valkov on behalf of the parliamentary group of Agrarians, with Valkov saying \"I do not feel confident enough at this time to proceed to the leadership of the country given that I see now in parliament a group of about 130 people on whose support I probably will not count.\"\nOn 31 July Stoyan Ganev nominated Zhelyu Zhelev as a candidate for head of state on behalf of the Union of Democratic Forces. On 1 August Prime Minister Andrei Lukanov said that the parliamentary group of the Socialist Party would support Zhelev, Viktor Valkov doing this on behalf of the BAP, BSP and UDF, and Julius Bahnev – on behalf of MRF. This provided the required majority and Zhelev was elected to the post.\nResults\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n!colspan=2|Candidate\n!Party\n!First round\n!Second round\n!Third round\n!Fourth round\n!Fifth round\n!Sixth round\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"\"| ||align=left|Chavdar Kjuranov||align=left|Bulgarian Socialist Party||217||211||190||194|||||\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"\"| ||align=left|Peter Dertliev||align=left|Party of Bulgarian Social Democrats||130||131||146||146||130||\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"\"| ||align=left|Viktor Valkov||align=left|Bulgarian Agrarian National Union||36||37||41||37||254||\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"\"| ||align=left|Zhelyu Zhelev||align=left|Union of Democratic Forces||||||||||||284\n|-\n|bgcolor=black| ||align=left colspan=2|Against ||1|||||1|||||||108\n|-\n|align=left colspan=3|Total||390||384||387||384||386||392\n|-\n|}\nElection of Vice President\nIn the original nomination BSP nominated for vice president Velko Valkanov, UDF – Petar Beron and Agrarian not rising contender.
