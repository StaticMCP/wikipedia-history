In addition to his famous quip in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell about Milton belonging to the devil's party, Blake wrote Milton: a Poem which has Milton, like Satan, rejecting a life in Heaven.\n*Paradise Lost influenced Mary Shelley when she wrote her novel Frankenstein. Shelley uses a quote from Book X of Paradise Lost on the epigram page of her novel and Paradise Lost is one of three books Frankenstein's monster finds; this, therefore, influences his psychological growth. The concept of the \"Fallen Angel,\" an epithet of Satan, is used to both describe the protagonist, Victor, and to describe his monster.\n*Poet Percy Bysshe Shelley specifically notes in the preface to his lyrical drama Prometheus Unbound that he constructed his character Prometheus in part as an attempt to revise Milton's Satan.\n*In H.P.

In Pullman's introduction, he modifies Blake's line to quip that he himself \"is of the Devil's party and does know it.\"\n*Libba Bray uses a quote from Paradise Lost to name the second book of her trilogy, Rebel Angels quoting from it \"To reign is worth ambition though in Hell: Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heav'n.\"\n*In his Sandman  comics/graphic novels series, Neil Gaiman uses Lucifer as a character, most notably in the Season of Mists  arc/collection, and makes reference to the poem, having Lucifer openly quote Milton.\n*The Day After Judgment by James Blish ends with Satan making a long speech in Miltonic blank verse.\n*John Collier's Paradise Lost: Screenplay for Cinema of the Mind. was published in 1973.\n*In 1994, American author Joseph Lanzara wrote Paradise Lost: The Novel based upon the epic poem.\n*In Jón Kalman Stefánsson's novel,  Heaven and Hell the character Barthur is enamored of the poem, and suffers tragic consequences when he does not pay attention to gathering his gear for a fishing job,  instead dwelling on one passage from the poem.
