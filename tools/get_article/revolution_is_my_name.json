      "text": "# Revolution Is My Name\n\n}}\n}}\n\"Revolution Is My Name\" is a song by American heavy metal band Pantera. It was the first single from the band's final album, Reinventing the Steel. It was also included on the band's compilation album ''Far Beyond the Great Southern Cowboys' Vulgar Hits!.\nRelease and reception\n\"Revolution Is My Name\" reached number 28 on the Billboard''s Mainstream Rock Tracks. The song was nominated for Best Metal Performance in the 2001 Grammys, but lost to Deftones' \"Elite\". However, it won a 2000 Metal Edge Readers' Choice Award for Song of the Year. The song's music video was voted as the 15th Greatest Metal Video of the 21st Century on Headbangers Ball in 2005.\nMusic video\nThe music video for the song was directed by Jim Van Bebber and produced by Grant Cihlar for 1171 Production Group. The video is a mix of different elements: between performances by the band and live footage. It also includes comical snippets of a sitcom-like interpretation of the band's childhood, in which the musicians are portrayed as small children (with facial hair) listening to Led Zeppelin and ZZ Top while jumping on the bed and playing oversized instruments. The video also includes flashes of the band's influences, such as Black Sabbath and Kiss.\nTrack listing\n;Promo single\n;Extended play (EP)\n| length2         = 4:17\n| title3          = Immortally Insane\n| length3         = 5:13\n| title4          = Cat Scratch Fever\n| note4           = Ted Nugent cover\n| writer4         = Ted Nugent\n| length4         = 3:51\n}}\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
