However, nominations closed at noon on 12 February and the Awami League politician Mohammed Shahabuddin Chuppu, who had been nominated in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, was the only candidate nominated. On 13 February 2023, Shahabuddin was thus officially elected as the country's 22nd president as he was unopposed.\nMohammed Shahabuddin Chuppu was inaugurated for a five-year term on Monday, 24 April 2023.\nBackground\nAs the ruling party Bangladesh Awami League has the majority of seats in the Jatiya Sangsad, and the constitution restricts cross-voting, the candidate nominated by the party is supposed to win the election. Besides, opposition parties had already declared that they won't nominate any candidate. Thus AL-nominated candidate Mohammed Shahabuddin won the election unopposed.\nElectoral system\nThe president is elected by an indirect election by the members of parliament as per Article 48 of the Constitution. However, since 1991, when parliamentary government system was restored in Bangladesh, all of government party candidates have been elected uncontestedly.\nElection schedule\nThe election schedule was announced by the Chief Election Commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal on 25 January 2023, after meeting with the Speaker of the Jatiya Sangsad Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury the day before.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Schedule for the 2023 Bangladesh presidential election\n!Event\n!Date\n!Day\n|-\n|Election Date Announcement\n|25.01.2023\n|Wednesday\n|-\n|Last Date for Filling Nomination\n|12.02.2023\n|Sunday\n|-\n|Nomination Scrutiny\n|13.02.2023\n|Monday\n|-\n|Last Date for Nomination Withdrawal\n|14.02.2023\n|Tuesday\n|-\n|Polling and Results\n|19.02.2023\n|Sunday\n|}\nElectoral college\nOn 6 December 2022, seven Members of Parliament (MP) affiliated with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) resigned as part of their anti-government protests. Before the declaration of presidential election schedule, the Election Commission of Bangladesh published the voter list which listed 343 members, as seven seats were vacant. On 1 February 2023, by-elections were held among the six directly elected seats. Although the Election Commission at first indicated that the by-election winners will not be included in the electoral college, the commission eventually published a revised gazette on 9 February which was composed of 349 members, after the six MPs took their oath on 8 February.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+2023 Bangladeshi presidential election Electoral College\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n!Party\n!Electorate(s)\n|-\n|Bangladesh Awami League\n|305\n|-\n|Jatiya Party-JaPa (Ershad)\n|27\n|-\n|Workers Party of Bangladesh\n|4\n|-\n|Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal-JaSaD (Inu)\n|3\n|-\n|Bikalpa Dhara Bangladesh\n|2\n|-\n|Gano Forum\n|2\n|-\n|Jatiya Party-JP (Manju)\n|1\n|-\n|Bangladesh Tarikat Federation\n|1\n|-\n|Independents\n|4\n|-\n!Total\n!349\n|}\nCandidates\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 |Candidate\n!
