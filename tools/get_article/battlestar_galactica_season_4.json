In June 2007, the Sci-Fi Channel confirmed the fourth season would be its final season, with an order of 22 episodes, an increase from 13 as originally announced. Production of the final season began in May 2007. A special TV movie, titled Battlestar Galactica: Razor, aired on November 24, 2007. The regular season began airing on April 4, 2008.\nOnly the first 12 episodes of season four (including Razor, which is technically the first two episodes of the 22 ordered for season 4) were filmed before the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike halted production of all scripted TV shows. After the strike ended, the final 10 episodes began airing on January 16, 2009.\nReception\nThe season received universal acclaim from critics, scoring 85 out of 100 based on 16 reviews from Metacritic. On Rotten Tomatoes, the season has an approval rating of 92% with an average score of 8.1 out of 10 based on 38 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Battlestar Galacticas final season proves a satisfying conclusion to TV's best science fiction offering.\" The series also placed on numerous critics top ten lists of both 2008 and 2009 by publications such as the Chicago Tribune, San Francisco Chronicle, The Star-Ledger, Time and TV Guide.\nThe fourth season received a total of eleven Emmy Award nominations. \"Season 4.0\" received six nominations at the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards, for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series (Michael Angeli for \"Six of One\"), Outstanding Cinematography for a One-Hour Series (Stephen McNutt for Razor), Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series (\"He That Believeth in Me\"), and Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (One-Hour) (Razor); and won for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series (\"He That Believeth in Me\") and Outstanding Special Class – Short-Format Live-Action Entertainment Programs (Razor Flashbacks). \"Season 4.5\" received five nominations at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards, with the episode \"Daybreak, Part 2\" receiving all the series' nominations, for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series (Michael Rymer), Outstanding Single Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series, Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (One Hour), and Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series; and won for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series.\nFor the 10 regular episodes, Battlestar Galactica averaged a 1.7 Nielsen household rating and 2.2 million total viewers.
