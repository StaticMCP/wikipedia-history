      "text": "# Jackson King V\n\nThe King V is an electric guitar model made by Jackson Guitars.\nOrigin and history\nThe Jackson King V was originally named after Robbin Crosby of Ratt, his nickname being \"King\". Crosby popularized the guitar throughout the 1980s, however the guitar he played most often was his Double Rhoads guitar, a modified design of the Jackson Rhoads guitar. King V model surfaced as a downsized version of the Double Rhoads, which was designed and targeted for a shorter, more ordinary person. (Crosby was 6.5 feet/198 cm tall, hence the nickname \"King\").\nMegadeth frontman Dave Mustaine eventually became the guitarist most identified with using this model. After creating a custom King V for Mustaine (completed October 10, 1986), the company later began mass-producing a Dave Mustaine Signature Series King V, which featured 24 frets (as opposed to the typical 22 frets) and would become one of their best selling guitars. This line continued into the early 2000s, when it underwent massive changes and became the Y2KV, a guitar based much more heavily on the Gibson Flying V.  Mustaine then sold his entire personal collection of Jacksons, and subsequently signed endorsement deals with ESP Guitars in 2003, Dean Guitars in 2007, and Gibson Family Brands in 2021 (Gibson, Epiphone, Kramer).\nVariants of the King V\nListed below is the range of King V models in chronological order.\nSan Dimas/Ontario custom-shop era (1980s–1990s)\nThe first King V Custom in black with Kahler tremolo ever built. It is serial number J0506. It was completed 3/10/85 and predates Dave Mustaine's first King V by 17 months.\n; Double Rhoads\n: The Double Rhoads was a symmetrical version of the Jackson Rhoads with two longer horns, the first one was ordered from Overkill guitarist Dave Linsk. While the guitar was made, Ratt guitarist Robbin Crosby saw it and wanted a similar guitar. Jackson built him two, one red and one black (he later got his white DR). Circa 10 Double Rhoads' were built and never in mass production before the design was changed with smaller wings and became the King V, the first King V was silver with black bevels.\n; King V Custom\n: From start to 1985 this was the name for a King V with sharkfin inlays, neck binding and ebony fretboard. Pickup and bridge options were anything the purchaser wanted.\n; King V Student\n: Same as above, but with dot inlays, no binding, and rosewood fretboard.\nOntario mass production era (1990s)\nA KV1, same model played by Dave Mustaine before the Y2KV was created.\n; KV1(Artist Signature Series)\n: The KV1 is a Dave Mustaine signature model and is the first commercially-sold model of the King V.  Previously known as the King V Pro, the KV1 supersedes the King V Pro and eliminated the Cherryburst finish in favor of a natural Korina wood finish.  The tuners were replaced with LSR locking tuners as well.  The end-points were shortened from the prototype created for Robbin Crosby as it was created as a \"Double-Rhoads\" which has a longer point than this model (The \"Double-Rhoads\" has 2 equal length long points).  All other variants below stemmed from this design including 24 frets.  USA-made versions of this guitar are highly coveted by metal guitarists and are typically difficult to locate ones for sale. No longer in production.\n; Y2KV (Artist Signature Series)\n: The Y2KV is a Dave Mustaine signature model and differs from all other King Vs in that it has rounded ends which seem similar to that of the Gibson Flying V. No longer in production.\n; KV2 (USA Series)\n: The KV2 is a variant of the King V which comes under the 'USA Select Series' of Jackson Guitars. The body is made of alder and is intersected by a neck-thru quartersawn maple neck with ebony fingerboard. It has Neck and Bridge humbucking pickups, both from Seymour Duncan, which are both the JB model. This model has 24 frets and a 2-point double locking Floyd Rose tremolo and is constructed in the US. The KV2 is one of the 4 USA Select Series guitars (alongside the KE2, RR1, and WR1) built with the \"Jackson Speed Neck\" profile, a slim neck thickness for a fast playability.\n; KV2T (USA Series)\n: The KV2T is a variant of the King V which comes under the 'USA Select Series' of Jackson Guitars. The body is made of mahogany and is intersected by a three piece neck-thru quartersawn mahogany neck with ebony fingerboard.  Later made the alder body and quartersawn maple neck, with ebony fingerboard, too. It has neck and bridge humbucking pickups, both from Seymour Duncan, with a JB in the bridge and a '59 in the neck.  This model has 24 frets but what is unique to this particular model is that it has a string through body, 'shark eye' fretboard inlay, an abalone Jackson logo on the headstock, the headstock itself is an SLS type rather than the traditional concorde Jackson headstock and has Sperzel locking tuners. Also to note is that the body is a flat top and lacks the bevels of the other Jackson King Vs. The guitar is also a 24\" scale rather than the 25.5\" scale that other Jackson King Vs have, though it was originally produced in a 25.5\" scale.\n; KV3 (Pro Series)\n: The KV3 was produced in 1996-2001 in Japan.
