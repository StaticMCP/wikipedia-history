Mitch Watson, co-producer of Beware the Batman, explained how the crew behind the series approached Batman for the show the way they did: \"In the way we approached Batman for this show, he's at the beginning of his career, he's probably been doing it for about five to six years, he's in his early 30s. And character-wise, we broke him into three parts. There's the public Bruce Wayne, who we modeled slightly after Richard Branson. We wanted to make Bruce Wayne more of an altruistic guy and the company's (Wayne Enterprise) trying to do good. So, that's the public Bruce. The private Bruce is more introspective guy who really only deals with Alfred, and Alfred at the beginning of the series is really the only person who sees that side of Bruce Wayne. He's quiet; he's a little bit obsessive about particular things\". Developers expressed that the series is a departure from previous Batman animated series in their choice to focus on the character's nature as a detective and focusing on his intellect. Crime fighting in the series puts emphasis on procedural aspects of mystery solving. Batman is also a subject to external threats of injury, as Watson said that there are several episodes where he really gets damaged.\n* Tatsu Yamashiro / Katana (voiced by Sumalee Montano) is a martial arts swordmaster in hiding from the League of Assassins who was hired to act as Bruce Wayne's bodyguard by her godfather Alfred Pennyworth. She revealed to Alfred that she was undercover in the League of Assassins to steal the Soultaker Sword from them before it can be used for their own evils.\n* Alfred Pennyworth (voiced by JB Blanc) is a former MI6 agent and Bruce Wayne's butler. Following initial promotion of the series, critics were concerned with what they interpreted to be the re-characterization of Alfred Pennyworth as a fellow crime fighter. Producer Glen Murakami explained that initial promotion posters that had been issued to the press were not originally intended for release, and that they did not give an accurate display of Alfred's role in the show. However, Murakami referred to Alfred's canonical backstory, which cast Alfred as a former MI6 agent, and said that this would be Alfred's portrayal in the show. Series writer Mitch Watson described this version of Alfred as Sean Connery from The Untouchables. The characterization of Alfred is that of a man who was once in a physical condition on par with Batman, who was now in his 60s and past his prime, but still is able to provide advice to Batman and be an ally when necessary. This characterization was pitched to DC comics, who responded that the company was coincidentally also taking Alfred in that direction. Series developers originally intended to give Alfred a greater role in the series, but Murakami advised that they scale back his activities, over concern that he could outshine Batman.\n* Commissioner Jim Gordon (voiced by Kurtwood Smith) is a police lieutenant who works at the Gotham City Police Department. Although he disapproved of Batman's crime-fighting, he slowly became an ally of Batman. He is later promoted to police commissioner during the second half of the first season after Commissioner Correa was killed by ninjas working for the League of Assassins.\nVillains\nWhen the series was first unveiled, lesser known villains were introduced. Sam Register explained that they went deeper into the villain library and pulled out some other villains and the studio did not want the series to do another \"Joker story\".[http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/bewarebatman/backstage/vecchio/ The World's Finest – Beware The Batman] The following villains are listed in order of appearance:\n* Anarky (voiced by Wallace Langham) is a mysterious figure who self-identifies as a madman and champion of chaos in opposition to Batman, who he sees as the champion of law and order. Whereas the original character is an anti-villain thematically based on socio-political philosophy, producers chose Anarky to function as the main villain, and was re-characterized as a criminal mastermind who would challenge Batman through complex schemes and machinations. In the closing credits of \"Tests\", the creation credits for Anarky and Katana were swapped, thus erroneously crediting Mike W. Barr and Jim Aparo for creating him.\n* League of Assassins is a secret international criminal organization consisting of highly trained warriors. Katana once infiltrated their ranks in order to steal the Soultaker Sword from them. The plots of the League of Assassins have included reclaiming the Soultaker Sword from Katana and plotted to take control of the Ion Cortex.\n** '''Ra's al Ghul (voiced by Lance Reddick) is the leader of the League of Assassins. His body was first revealed to be in suspended animation. He was revived from suspended animation by Lady Shiva.\n** Sandra Wu-San / Lady Shiva (voiced by Finola Hughes) is an elite member of the League of Assassins.\n** Silver Monkey (voiced by James Remar) is an elite agent of the League of Assassins that wears a silver monkey mask. He tried to take the Soultaker Sword for himself until Lady Shiva caught on to his plan.\n** Avery Twombey / Cypher is a cyborg agent of the League of Assassins.\n* Slade Wilson / Deathstroke (voiced by Robin Atkin Downes) is an elite mercenary who is hired by Harvey Dent and Anarky to hunt down Batman.\n* Harvey Dent / Two-Face''' (voiced by Christopher McDonald) is a district attorney who is obsessed with bringing Batman down. He eventually gains his own assault squad and is shown to be very deceptive. Following an accident where his head is covered in bandages, Dent's bad side starts to surface and he becomes Two-Face.\n* Lazlo Valentin / Professor Pyg (voiced by Brian George) an eco-terrorist, thematically inspired by The Wind in the Willows. Some of Professor Pyg's eco-terrorism ranges from targeting businesspeople who did shady deals involving land developing on a swamp, capturing models and fashion designers that use parts of different animals (like bird feathers and animal pelts), and creating mutated animals.\n** Mister Toad (voiced by Udo Kier) is Professor Pyg's henchman. In this show, Mister Toad fights with a wooden cane that conceals a flamethrower and he has a sonic croak and prehensile tongue.\n* Margaret Sorrow / Magpie (voiced by Grey DeLisle-Griffin) – Magpie, a character created in the 1980s, underwent a massive redesign to give her a more contemporary appearance.\n}}"
