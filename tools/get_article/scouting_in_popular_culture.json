It is especially prevalent in the United States, where Scouting is tied closely to the ideal of American culture. The works of painters Norman Rockwell and Joseph Csatari and the 1966 film Follow Me, Boys! are prime examples of this idealized American ethos. One of the earliest depictions of Scouting in the entertainment media is a 1908 British silent film Scouts to the Rescue, shown in nickelodeons. Produced by Williamson Kinematograph, it depicted Boy Scouts tracking a gang of kidnappers through the woods to rescue an abducted baby.\nScouting is often dealt with in a humorous manner, as in the 1989 film Troop Beverly Hills, and is often fictionalized so that the audience knows the topic is Scouting without there being any mention of Scouting by name.\nFilm\n* Scouts to the Rescue (1909) UK; Boy Scouts track a gang of kidnappers through the woods and rescue an abducted baby\n* Charley Smiler Joins the Boy Scouts (1911) UK;\n* Remise du drapeau aux boy-scouts au Cinquantenaire (1914) Belgium;\n* Boy Scouts to the Rescue (1917) US; original title Boy Scouts Be Prepared (1917) UK;\n* The Little Boy Scout (1917) US; Justina disguises herself as a Boy Scout and joins the troop to escape her evil uncle.\n* Drum Taps (1933) US; Ken and his brother Earl's Boy Scout troop go after a gang of rustlers.
