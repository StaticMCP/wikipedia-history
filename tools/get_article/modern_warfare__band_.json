      "text": "# Modern Warfare (band)\n\n}}\nModern Warfare was an American early-1980s punk rock band from Long Beach, California.  It featured Jim Bemis (guitar and lead vocals), Tim Gaines (bass), Steve Sinclair (bass), Ron Goudie (lead guitar), Randy Scott (drums), and Tish Lucca (Keyboards).\nBemis wrote most of the songs, and also lent his name to the band's label, Bemisbrain Records (sometimes written as two words, \"Bemis Brain\").  Bemisbrain (the name was reportedly a play on the Bemis Manufacturing Company, maker of toilet seats, though this was never confirmed by the band) issued records by several other punk and deathrock bands, including Tex & the Horseheads, Nip Drivers, Mnemonic Devices, and Super Heroines, as well as the two Hell Comes to Your House compilation albums.\nDiscography\n*Modern Warfare (7-inch EP, 1980, Bemisbrain Records)\n*Modern Warfare No.&nbsp;2 (7-inch EP, 1981, Bemisbrain Records)\nCompilation appearances\n*Hell Comes to Your House (1981)\n**Includes \"Out of My Head\" and \"Street Fightin' Man\"\n*American Youth Report (1982)\n**Includes \"One for All\"\n*Life Is Boring So Why Not Steal This Record (1983)\n**Includes \"Moral Majority\"\nReferences"
