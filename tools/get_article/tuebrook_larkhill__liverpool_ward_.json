The Tuebrook Larkhill ward was created as a single-member ward from the north-eastern portion of the former Tuebrook and Stoneycroft ward and a small portion of the former Clubmoor ward. The ward boundaries follow Townsend Lane, Queens Drive, West Derby Road, and the Canada Dock Branch line.}}\nNotes\nReferences"
