The expedition took place in November 1970.\nVoyage\nThe expedition party left Devonport Naval Base on 4 November 1970 in HMNZS Kiama and landed the following morning at Great Island. With support from the crew, they established a camp in Castaway Valley and established radio contact.\nThe camp was made up of two dormitory tents, a laboratory tent, and another for their stores and mess. One of the sleeping tents got the name 'Centipede Lodge' for the number of the insects coming inside at night.\nWater was in short supply, with the main freshwater source substantially drying up over the month.\nThey stayed for most of the month, returning to Auckland on 26 November on the same vessel.\nParticipants\n* Guillermo Kuschel, leader, entomology\n* John Gordon Reeves McBurney, entomology\n* Graeme William Ramsay, entomology\n* John Charles Watt, DSIR, entomology\n* David Galloway, DSIR, botany\n* Dennis Huckvale Leigh, Parks and Reserves, Nelson, botany\n* Frank Climo, Dominion Museum, malacology\nNoteworthy events\nThe holotype specimen of Egestula bicolor (Climo, 1973) was collected during this expedition.\nReferences"
