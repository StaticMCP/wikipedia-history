It was a closed primary, restricted to enrolled members of the Republican Party.[http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P08/CT-R.phtml Connecticut Republican Delegation 2008]\nCandidates\nThe following is the order in which Republican candidates appeared on Connecticut's Republican primary ballot on February 5, 2008:[http://www.sots.ct.gov/releases/2008/01-002-08PresidentialBallotSelectionRelease.pdf Office of the Secretary of the State]\n*Rudolph Giuliani, Fred Thompson, Mitt Romney, John McCain, Duncan Hunter, Ron Paul, Mike Huckabee, and Alan Keyes.\nBy law, \"uncommitted\" appeared below the list of candidates on the ballots for both parties in Connecticut.\nCandidates who dropped out after December 27, 2007, remained on the ballot in Connecticut. Colorado Congressman Tom Tancredo was the only Republican candidate listed as a likely contender in November who withdrew early enough to be removed from the ballot. California Congressman Duncan Hunter, former Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson, and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani withdrew after the December 27 cut-off date, and therefore remained on the ballot.\nHistory\nAlthough the February 5, 2008 primary was the eighth presidential cycle since Connecticut replaced local primaries with a statewide primary in 1977, it was only the sixth primary to feature Republican candidates due to the unchallenged incumbents of Ronald Reagan in 1984 and George W. Bush in 2004. With John McCain having won the 2008 Republican nomination, Connecticut had selected the eventual Republican nominee in 67 percent of past primaries.\nThe February 5 primary was the first time Connecticut used the optical scan voting system for a primary. The state had first used the technology statewide in the 2007 municipal elections.\nOpinion polling\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Official Results\n|-\n!
