The voices of VJs like Rick Campanelli, Sook-Yin Lee, Nam Kiwanuka, Mike Campbell, and George Stroumboulopoulos are featured in the film. Menard said, \"I wanted to recreate the experience both for viewers who grew up with it and for those who have no clue what MuchMusic was. I wanted them to be immersed in that channel and the best way to do that is to live in the space and the world of the archives and not cut back and forth to on-camera interviews.\"\nRelease\nThe film premiered at the South by Southwest film festival in March 2023. It later premiered at Roy Thomson Hall in Toronto in September 2023.\nIt was scheduled to premiere on January 26, 2024 on Crave, owned by Much's current parent company Bell Media. However, its release was indefinitely delayed due to copyright issues involving the music video clips seen in the film.\nTour\nThe film toured across Canada in the following cities:\nSeptember 22, Toronto, ON - Roy Thomson Hall\nOctober 17, Montréal, QC - Railto Theatre\nOctober 18, Saint John, NB - Imperial Theatre\nOctober 24, Charlottetown, PE - Sobey Family Theatre\nOctober 25, Halifax, NS - Rebecca Cohn Auditorium\nOctober 28, Ottawa, ON - Bytowne Cinema\nNovember 1, Calgary, AB - Jack Singer Concert Hall\nNovember 4, Hamilton, ON - FirstOntario Concert Hall\nNovember 5, Windsor, ON - Chrysler Theatre\nNovember 8, Edmonton, AB - Winspear Centre\nNovember 13, Regina, SK - Conexus Arts Centre\nNovember 24, Vancouver, BC - Vancouver Playhouse\nNovember 25, Victoria, BC - Royal Theatre\nNovember 27, Winnipeg, MB - Centennial Concert Hall\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
