Nominees were typically announced in January for Equity 99-seat productions from the previous year, with awards handed out in March or April. The 35th annual awards ceremony was held in April 2014.  In December 2014, the LA Weekly announced that it was discontinuing the awards, citing the publication's desire to focus on events that would promote its profitability.\nCategories\nProduction\n* Production of the Year\n* Revival Production of the Year (of a 20th- or 21st-century work)\n* Musical of the Year\nPerformance\n* Ensemble\n* Musical Ensemble\n* Comedy Ensemble\n* Leading Female Performance\n* Leading Male Performance\n* Supporting Female Performance\n* Supporting Male Performance\n* Two-Person Performance\n* Solo Performance\n* Female Comedy Performance\n* Male Comedy Performance\n* Musical Performance\n* One-Act Performance\nDirection/Choreography/Design\n* Direction\n* Direction of a Musical\n* Comedy Direction\n* One-Act Direction\n* Choreography\n* Production Design\n* Lighting Design\n* Costume Design\n* Set Design\n* Sound Design\n* Mask Design\n* Puppet Design\nWriting/Composition\n* Play Writing\n* Adaptation\n* Original Music\nSpecial Achievement\n* Career Achievement\n* Queen of the Angels\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.laweekly.com/2009-01-22/stage/the-30th-annual-l-a-weekly-theater-awards/ 30th LA Weekly Theater Award Nominees] on LA Weekly site"
