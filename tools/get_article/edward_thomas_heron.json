An industrialist and printing entrepreneur, he established a number of technical and trade journals.

Both parents died in 1879 and, in the care of three strict Baptist maiden aunts, he had a brief education at Dr Moore's Prep School, Marylebone Road, and Haberdashers' Aske's in Hoxton.\nThe following year, he left school at age 14 and was apprenticed to Faulding & Truslove Printers in Fulham. In 1888, he started his own imprint at Westminster Press, 333 Harrow Road, publishing The Advertiser, which circulated in Paddington and Queen's Park. After further expanding his business operations, in 1897, he married Eliza May Margaret (née Baldrey). The actor Dominic Cooper is their great-grandson.\nHe commenced publishing The Optical Magic Lantern and Photographic Enlarger (c. 1890),  ''Scott's Machinery Index (1902), The Talking Machine News (1903), The Music Dealer (1906), the Millinery Trade Journal (1906), the Violin Student (1906), The Kinematograph and Lantern Weekly (renamed in 1907),  and Bowling and Curling'' (1908).\nReferences\nSources\n* Unpublished diary in collection of the National Media Museum, Bradford"
