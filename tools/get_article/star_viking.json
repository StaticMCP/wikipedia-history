Jackson commented that \"I give Star Viking an qualified recommendation. It would almost be worth the price foe the maps and counters alone! If you like the idea of plunder in outer space, you should probably pick this game up... but you may want to rewrite a lot of the rules to suit yourself. If Heritage had to 'borrow' so heavily from H. Beam Piper's [Space Viking], it's too bad they couldn't have done it justice.\"\nSteve List reviewed Star Viking in Ares Magazine #12 and commented that \"Star Viking as a game approaches Imperium (to which it bears a resemblance) in excellent as a game of strategic space opera.\"\nReviews\n*Dragon #57\nReferences"
