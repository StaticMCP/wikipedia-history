It was a small village owned by petty nobility.\nIn 1805, castellan Franciszek Krotkowski, the owner of the village, built the Wyczółki Manor House as his residence, placed near Berensewicz Ponds, at the current 53 Łączyny Street. Around them was developed an English landscape garden, now known as the Wyczółki Park.\nBetween 1925 and 1939, the Służewiec Racecourse, was built to the east of Wyczółki, at the current 266 Puławska Street. Upon its opening, it became the largest and the most modern horse racing venue in Europe. It included two tracks, the main turf circuit with the length of 2,300 m, now located within the City Information System area of North Ursynów, and a smaller dirt circuit, with the length of 1,950 m, within Wyczółki.\nIn 1934, the Warszawa Okęcie railway station was opened near Gorzkiewki Street, to serve the nearby Warsaw Chopin Airport.\nWyczółki was incorporated into the city of Warsaw on 27 September 1938. Larger portion of the modern City Information System area of Wyczółki remained outside the city boundaries until it was incorporated on 14 May 1951. During the German occupation of Poland in the Second World War, the Służewiec Racecourse served as an airstrip for the fighter aircraft of the German Air Force. In July 1944, between 600 and 800 soldiers were stationed there. On 1 August 1944, on the first day of the Warsaw Uprising, the airstrip was attacked by the Polish resistance partisants from the Karpaty Battalion of the Baszta Regiment Group. It was unsuccessful, with partisants experiencing heavy casualties. Later that day, in retaliation, captured partisans and a group of civilians from the nearby Służew were executed at the racetrack..\nIn 1951, the area of Służewiec, Zbarż, and Wyczółki, was designated to become the Industrial and Storage District of Służewiec (Polish: Dzielnica Przemysłowo-Składowa „Służewiec”), later known as Służewiec Przemysłowy (Industrial Służewiec). It was envisioned to feature 60 factories and industrial plants. The construction begun in 1952, and utilized the large panel system technique, marking it as one of the first instances of its usage in Poland. The designated area covered around 2.6&nbsp;km2 (1 sq mi). In the early 1970s, around 20,000 people were employed in the industial district. In the 1990s, the manufacturing industry left the area, leading to the emergence of residential and office buildings in its place.\nIn 1995, the Grabów Cemetery, operated by the nearby St. Sophie Barat Church, was opened at Poloneza Street.\nIn 1996, the administrative neighbourhood of Wyczółki, governmened by an elected council, was established as a subdivision of the municipality of Warsaw-Ursynów, which was replaced by the Ursynów district in 2002. Its status was reconfirmed in 2013. In 1998, the district of Ursynów was subdivided into the City Information System areas, with Wyczółki becoming one of them.\nCharacteristics\nWyczółki is a mixed area, consisting of residential zones, as well as business office complexes and storage warehouses.
