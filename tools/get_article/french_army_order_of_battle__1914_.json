The organisation changed during August with the assignment of new reserve units and the creation of new armies.\nOrganisation\nPeacetime Organisation\nThe peacetime army had, in the spring of 1914, a strength of 882,907 men, with 686,993 in metropolitan France, 62,598 in Algeria and Tunisia, 81,750 in Morocco, and 51,566 auxiliaries. }}\nThe territory of the French Republic was divided into 21 military regions, 20 in metropolitan France, and one in Algeria (the 19th). Each region provided two infantry divisions, except the 6th which had three divisions.\nThe army had 686 infantry battalions. Metropolitan France had 173 infantry regiments, each with three battalions (nine regiments had four), as well as 31 light infantry () battalions, and 12 colonial infantry regiments (each with three battalions). In the colonies, there was four regiments of Zouaves with six battalions, 9 regiments of Algerian riflemen () with 40 battalions, 2 regiments of the Foreign Legion with six battalions, 5 battalions of African light infantry, 6 Moroccan colonial marching regiments, and 5 battalions of Moroccan auxiliaries.\nThe cavalry had 378 squadrons, organised into 89 regiments (each with four squadrons): 12 cuirassier, 32 dragoon, 21 light horse (), 14 hussar, 6 African light horse, and 4 Spahis.\nThe artillery had 855 batteries (each of four guns), organised into 62 field artillery regiments, 2 mountain artillery regiments, 11 foot artillery regiments, 5 heavy artillery regiments, 10 African artillery groups, and 3 colonial artillery regiments. It provided 42 divisional artillery (with three groups or nine batteries), 20 corps artillery (with four groups or twelve batteries), and 10 horse groups (with three batteries).\nMobilisation\nThe French army began mobilising on August 2, 1914 according to Plan XVII. The 680,000 peacetime troops were joined by 2,900,000 reservists and territorials. The three youngest classes of reservists were used to bring active units up to wartime strength, while new units were created from older reservists and territorials.\nEach of 21 military regions provided an army corps of two infantry divisions. Each corps was numbered after the military region it was created from. The 19th region in Algeria did not form a corps, but did send its two divisions. A total of 46 infantry divisions were mobilised with 1,054,000 men, and 10 cavalry divisions with 52,500 men.\nEach infantry division is composed of two infantry brigades with two regiments, plus a cavalry squadron, an artillery regiment (with three groups) and an engineer company. Each cavalry division is made up of three brigades with two regiments, plus a cyclist group, an artillery group and a detachment of cyclist engineers. Each army corps is made up of two infantry divisions (except the 6th corps with three divisions) with corps troops of a cavalry regiment (with four squadrons), an artillery regiment (with four groups), and an engineering battalion (with four companies).\nThen, reserve infantry regiments are formed from the active regiments. They are given the same number as the active regiment plus 200. Reserve infantry regiments had two battalions, compared with three for the active regiments. These are grouped into 25 reserve infantry divisions numbered from 51 to 75 (numbered after their military region plus 50). These reserve divisions had a total of 450,000 men.\nThe active and reserve regiments are each created from roughly 50/50 active and reserve personnel. To show this continuity, the active battalions were numbered 1, 2, and 3, while the reserve battalions were numbered 5 and 6.\nThe oldest were placed into territorial infantry regiments with three or four battalions, some of which were used to create 12 territorial infantry divisions with 184,600 men.\nThe wartime army increased to: }}\n* 1,525 infantry battalions (642 active, 406 reserve and 410 territorial), of approximately 1,100 men (with four companies of 254 men);\n* 545 cavalry squadrons (316 active, 176 reserve and 37 territorial) of approximately 120 men (in four platoons of 30 cavalrymen);\n* 1,468 artillery batteries (1,042 active, 265 reserve and 161 territorial), each of four guns (a group usually has three batteries);\n* 508 engineering companies and detachments.\nAdded to the 95 active, reserve and territorial divisions with 1,681,100 men are the army troops of 187,500 men, garrisons of 821,400 men, depots of 680,000 men, and railway guards of 210,000 men. }}\nOrder of Battle — First-line Units\nArmies deployed north to south\nFifth Army\nThe Fifth Army () was commanded by General Charles Lanrezac. In August 1914 it was concentrated between Hirson and Dun-sur-Meus, with the mission of guarding the border with Belgium. Its strength on mobilisation was 8,886 officers, 290,464 NCOs and men, and 108,360 horses organised into five corps of ten infantry divisions, two reserve infantry divisions, and one cavalry division.
