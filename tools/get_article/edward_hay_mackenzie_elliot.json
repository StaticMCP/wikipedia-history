He continued to appear regularly for the Wanderers over the next two years, with his final game coming on 22 March 1873. In the 1873 Football Annual, he was described as \"a truly ponderous fellow but successful as a dribbler withal; has been known to kick a goal.\"\nHe was selected to represent Scotland in the representative matches against England on 18 November 1871 and 24 February 1872, playing as a forward in the first match, won 2–1 by England, and as a back in the second match, which England won 1–0.\nLater in life, he also played cricket for the Marylebone Cricket Club, making four listed appearances between June 1897 and August 1903.\nMilitary and political career\nHe enrolled with the Dumfries, Roxburgh, Kirkcudbright and Selkirk (Scottish Borderers) Militia in May 1873.

His final promotion came in 1894 to the rank of major.\nIn March 1894, he succeeded Colonel Patrick Boyle, the son of the Earl of Glasgow, as private secretary and ADC to the Governor in New Zealand. He retired on 25 January 1899.\nLater life\nIn 1892, Elliot became the 6th Laird of Wolfelee on the death of his brother, James. He was made a Justice of the Peace for Roxburgh.\nDuring the Boer War, he was a commandant of Prisoners of War. Returning to England, he was a Fellow of the Royal Colonial Institute.\nElliot went back to New Zealand in 1907, when he visited the cadet camp at Hagley Park, Christchurch during the International Exhibition. He praised the discipline and appearance of the cadets.\nIn 1912, he sold the family home \"Wolfelee House\" at Bonchester Bridge, Roxburghshire. He died on 5 December 1920; at the time of his death, he was resident at \"Springfield\", Breinton, Herefordshire.\nFamily\nOn 27 September 1905, Elliot married Edith Margaret Crawford, the daughter of the Rev.
