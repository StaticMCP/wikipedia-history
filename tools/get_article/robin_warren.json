The duo proved to the medical community that the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the cause of most peptic ulcers.\nEarly life and education\nWarren was born 11 June 1937 in North Adelaide. His father, Roger Warren, was a winemaker, and his mother, Helen Warren (née Verco), was a nurse. Warren received his M.B.B.S. degree from the University of Adelaide, having completed his high school education at St Peter's College, Adelaide.\nCareer\nWarren trained at the Royal Adelaide Hospital and became a Registrar in Clinical Pathology at the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (IMVS). There, he worked in laboratory haematology, which generated his interest in pathology.\nIn 1963, Warren was appointed Honorary Clinical Assistant in Pathology and Honorary Registrar in Haematology at Royal Adelaide Hospital. Subsequently, he lectured in pathology at Adelaide University and then became Clinical Pathology Registrar at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. In 1967, Warren was elected to the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia and became a senior pathologist at the Royal Perth Hospital, where he spent the majority of his career.\nNobel Prize work\nAt the University of Western Australia,Warren along with his colleague Barry J. Marshall, proved that the bacterium is the infectious cause of stomach ulcers.  Warren helped develop a convenient diagnostic test (-urea breath-test) for detecting H. pylori in ulcer patients.\nIn 2005, Warren and Marshall were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine.\nAn Australian documentary was made in 2006 about Warren and Marshall's road to the Nobel Prize, called \"The Winner's Guide to the Nobel Prize\". He was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2007.\nAsteroid 254863 Robinwarren, discovered by Italian amateur astronomer Silvano Casulli in 2005, was named in his honour. The official  was published by the Minor Planet Center on 22 April 2016 ().\nPersonal life and death\nWarren married Winifred Teresa Warren (née Williams) in the early 1960s, and together they had five children.  Winifred Warren became an accomplished psychiatrist. Following her death in 1997, Warren retired from medicine.\nWarren died in Perth, Australia, on 23 July 2024, at the age of 87.\nSee also\n* Timeline of peptic ulcer disease and Helicobacter pylori\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*  including the Nobel Lecture Helicobacter - The Ease and Difficulty of a New Discovery\n* [http://www.vianet.net.au/~jrwarren/ Robin Warrens homepage]"
