      "text": "# List of German brigades in World War II\n\nThis is a list of German brigades in World War II. The list aims to include all brigade-level military formations of the German Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS during World War II.\nBrigades, in German army parlance prior to 1944, generally designated formations of two regiments from the same branch of arms. For instance,  contained the Panzer Regiments 3 and 4. The usage of the term shifted in the army after 30 May 1944, when it was redefined to apply to singular strengthened regiments.\nHeer\nInfantry brigades\nThe number of infantry brigades increased notably after 30 May 1944, when the previously-accepted meaning of brigade, group of two regiments of the same branch, was changed to instead designate a singular strengthened regiment. In such a fashion, the Grenadier Regiments 193, 308 and 503 in Finland became Grenadier Brigades. Grenadier Brigade 761 was an emergency formation formed from Finland veterans in Danzig in July 1944, and the Grenadier Brigades 1131 through 1136 were rapidly raised in various military districts in late July 1944, to be used as autonomous military formations.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of Wehrmacht infantry brigades\n!German name\n!Translated name\n!Notes\n|-\n|\n|Afrika-Brigade 999\n|\nFormed on 6 October 1942 on Heuberg Training Area as a penal unit.

This basic layout was overhauled in 1940; from then on, Rifle Brigades generally oversaw two Rifle Regiments instead of one, and each Rifle Regiment had two battalions each instead of three, thus bringing the number of total rifle battalions in a Rifle Brigade from three to four, but dropping the motorcycle battalion.\nOn 15 October 1942, the motorized infantry formations, including all previous Rifle Brigades, were given the new designation \"Panzergrenadier\", becoming Panzergrenadier Brigades.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of Wehrmacht Panzergrenadier brigades\n!German name\n!Translated name\n!Notes\n|-\n|\n|Führer Escort Brigade\n|\nFormed in November 1944 by upgrading the Führer Escort Battalion.

Never actually saw deployment.\n|}\nPanzer brigades\nIn the initial formation and conception of the German Panzerwaffe, the Panzer Brigade played an administrative role in the concept of its respective superior unit, the Panzer Division. In the prewar discussions, advocates of the establishment of Panzer Division (such as Heinz Guderian) faced opposition by a set of officers (such as Ludwig Beck) that favored independent Panzer Brigades and opposed division-level armored units.\nTo each Panzer Division was assigned a Panzer Brigade, which in turn contained two Panzer Regiments (each with two Panzer Detachments, for a total of four detachments in the Panzer Brigade). Additionally, a 1939 Panzer Division was supposed to be equipped with a Rifle Brigade (see above), a motorcycle battalion, a reconnaissance detachment, an engineer battalion, a panzer signals detachment, and a divisional services unit.\nOnly the original three Panzer Divisions (1st, 2nd, 3rd) actually contained all necessary parts in September 1939 (and even they did not receive the complete number of vehicles planned), and the divergences between the different divisions only increased as the war progressed. For instance, the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th Panzer Divisions (formed from the four Light Divisions after the Invasion of Poland) did not contain Panzer Brigades at all, instead opting for a single Panzer Regiment with three instead of two Panzer Detachments.\nThe collapse of Army Group Centre in 1944 (Operation Bagration), soon followed by the collapse of Army Group South Ukraine (Second Jassy–Kishinev offensive), resulted in the emergency formation of several new Panzer Brigades, numbered 101 through 113.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of Wehrmacht armored brigades\n!German name\n!Translated name\n!Notes\n|-\n|\n|1st Armored Brigade\n|Deployment begun in secret in February 1935 by absorbing three former cavalry regiments.
