It was established by President S. R. Nathan in 2000 and continued by his successors President Tony Tan, Halimah Yacob and incumbent President Tharman Shanmugaratnam.\nMany partners of the President's Challenge come from schools, private organisations, ministries and government bodies. The Challenge has raised over $170 million and rallied over 87,000 volunteers since its establishment in 2000.\nOverview\nBefore the establishment of President's Challenge, there were several charity projects under the President S. R. Nathan's name. In 2000, President S R Nathan initiated the consolidation of all these events under a single umbrella of President's Challenge so that it will be a single platform for different sectors e.g. corporations, schools and individuals to engage with charity. President's Challenge was founded on President S. R. Nathan's vision of Singapore being a compassionate nation whereby Singaporeans will be conscious of the less fortunate around them and graciously help them through volunteering and any other way possible.\nA similar charity event, the President’s Challenge Night (known as President's Star Charity till 2023) was initiated by President Ong Teng Cheong.\nBeneficiaries\nAny voluntary welfare organisation in Singapore with an approved Institution of a Public Character (IPC) can apply to be a President's Challenge beneficiary each year. Upon submission, the President's Office selects a number of beneficiaries for the disbursement of funds raised during President's Challenge for that year. The amounts disbursed to each beneficiary is varied and at the President's discretion.\nPartners\nCorporate partners\nMicrosoft Singapore\n2010 marked the tenth year of Microsoft Singapore's support of President's Challenge in general fundraising and its fourth year in organising a major fundraising event.\nThe Singapore Totalisator Board and Singapore Pools (Private) Limited\nThe Singapore Totalisator Board and Singapore Pools (Private) Limited has supported President's Challenge since 2000 by absorbing the administrative costs of President's Challenge so that all funds raised from donors go directly towards the beneficiaries.
