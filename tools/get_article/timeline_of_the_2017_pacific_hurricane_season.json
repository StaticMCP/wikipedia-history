      "text": "# Timeline of the 2017 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 2017 Pacific hurricane season was an event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation, in which tropical cyclones form in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The season officially started on May&nbsp;15 in the eastern Pacific—east of 140°W—and on June&nbsp;1 in the central Pacific—between the International Date Line and 140°W—and ended on November&nbsp;30. These dates typically cover the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the eastern Pacific basin. However, storm formation is possible at any time of the year, as illustrated in 2017 by the formation of the season's first named storm, Tropical Storm Adrian, on May 10. At the time, this was the earliest formation of a tropical storm on record in the basin.\nFour time zones are utilized in the basin: Central for storms east of 106°W, Mountain between 114.9°W and 106°W, Pacific between 140°W and 115°W, and Hawaii–Aleutian for storms between the International Date Line and 140°W. However, for convenience, all information is listed by Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) first with the respective local time included in parentheses. This timeline includes information that was not operationally released, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center is included. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season.\nTimeline\nMay\nMay 9\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (1:00&nbsp;p.m. CDT) at &nbsp;– Tropical Depression One-E develops from an area of low pressure about 315&nbsp;miles (510&nbsp;km) south-southwest of the El Salvador–Guatemala border.\nMay 10\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC (7:00&nbsp;p.m. CDT May&nbsp;9) at &nbsp;– Tropical Depression One-E intensifies into Tropical Storm Adrian.\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (1:00&nbsp;a.m. CDT) at &nbsp;– Tropical Storm Adrian reaches peak intensity with winds of  and a minimum pressure of 1004 mbar (hPa;
