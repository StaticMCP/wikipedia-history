They are both Commonwealth countries.\nHistory\nBritish influence in modern-day Malawi began through a system of foreign influence when Nyasaland became a British protectorate under a colonial administration. The Queen of Great Britain became the Queen of Nyasaland. Nyasaland gained independence on 6 July 1964 and has since known as Malawi.\nPost colonial relations\nMalawi has had diplomatic relations with United Kingdom during the post-colonial era.\nCochrane-Dyet cable\nCochrane-Dyet 2011 Cable Controversy}}\nMalawi and the UK found themselves in a diplomatic row in 2012 that resulted in the mutual expulsion of their envoys. Bingu wa Mutharika expelled British High Commissioner Fergus Cochrane-Dyet for calling him \"arrogant\" and \"intolerant\" after a leaked cable was published in The Nation newspaper. The United Kingdom in return expelled acting High Commissioner Flossie Gomile-Chidyaonga and revoked her invitation to the royal wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Relations were restored after Joyce Banda came into power.\nSee also\n*List of high commissioners of Malawi to the United Kingdom\n*List of high commissioners of the United Kingdom to Malawi\nReferences"
