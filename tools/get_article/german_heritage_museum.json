The museum focuses especially on representing the long history of German-Americans in the Greater Cincinnati area, which became, and remains one of the major German-American centers in the United States. In addition, the museum displays and showcases the activities of the twenty organizations currently under the umbrella of the German-American Citizens League of Greater Cincinnati, founded in Cincinnati in 1895.\nThe building that is now the museum had an earlier life as a log house, built around 1840 in nearby Delhi Township. The entire house was moved, piece by piece, to West Fork Park in Green Township and has been reconstructed as the German Heritage Museum.\nReferences"
