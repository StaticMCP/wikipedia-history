It was built of wood between 1888 and 1890 by local craftsmen Its steep pitched roof, lancet windows and entrance tower are typical of Carpenter Gothic churches. Its rear chancel has a separate roof line and appears to be an add on. The adjacent cemetery predates the church by one year. Because of its \"well preserved carpenter Gothic architecture\", its \"association with the history of the Anglican Church in western Prince Edward Island\" and \"its contribution\" to the community of Alma\", it was designated a provincial heritage site by the province of Prince Edward Island on December 21, 2007.\nSee also\n* Anglican Diocese of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island\nReferences"
