      "text": "# The Historical Atlas of China\n\nThe Historical Atlas of China () is an 8-volume work published in Beijing between 1982 and 1988, edited by Tan Qixiang. It contains 304 maps and 70,000 placenames in total.\nThe Concise Historical Atlas of China () was published in 1991.\nContents\nThe atlas consists of 8 volumes:\n# Archaeological findings, Xia, Shang, Western Zhou, Spring and Autumn period and Warring States period\n# Qin dynasty, Western and Eastern Han dynasties\n# Three Kingdoms and Western Jin dynasty\n# Eastern Jin dynasty, Sixteen Kingdoms and Southern and Northern Dynasties\n# Sui dynasty, Tang dynasty and Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period\n# Song dynasty, Liao dynasty and Jin Empire\n# Yuan dynasty and Ming dynasty\n# Qing dynasty\nOn each map, ancient places and water features are shown in black and blue respectively, superimposed on modern features, borders and claims, shown in brown.\nAll country-wide maps, from Paleolithic onward, include an inset showing the nine-dash line in the South China Sea.\nPlacenames are given in simplified characters, though an edition of the atlas published in Hong Kong uses traditional characters.\nReception\nThe Atlas is considered the most authoritative compendium of ancient place names and administrative boundaries, and a tremendous improvement on its predecessor, Yang Shoujing's Lidai yudi tu (Yangtu, \"Yang's atlas\", 1906–1911).\nHowever, more controversial has been Tan's historical conception:\n}}\nThis vision has been criticized as anachronistically projecting 20th-century minority policy and border claims into the distant past, resulting in a distorted view of the history of peripheral areas, portraying their incorporation into China as an inevitable organic process, rather than the result of conquest.\nSimilarly, early states are often given overly precise and extensive outer borders, often based on contentious claims.\nIn his afterword to volume 8, written in 1987, Tan identified the Atlas's indiscriminate inclusion of jimi and tusi areas within imperial territory as a flaw.}}\nSee also\n*General History of Chinese Administrative Divisions, a 13-volume series envisioned by Tan Qixiang and completed by his students\nNotes\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://ccts.sinica.edu.tw/ Chinese Civilization in Time and Space]: a project at Academia Sinica, Taiwan, based on a vectorization of Tan's atlas."
