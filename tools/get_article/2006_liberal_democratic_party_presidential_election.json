His chief competitors for the position were Sadakazu Tanigaki and Tarō Asō. Yasuo Fukuda was a leading early contender, but ultimately chose not to run. Former Prime Minister Yoshirō Mori, to whose faction both Abe and Fukuda belonged, stated that the faction strongly leant toward Abe. Abe was subsequently elected Prime Minister with 339 of 475 votes in the National Diet's lower house and a majority in the upper house.\nCandidates\nDeclared\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;width:100%\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:110px;\" | Candidate(s)\n!
