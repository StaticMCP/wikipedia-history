      "text": "# Cross Crusade\n\nThe Cyclocross Crusade, currently in season , is a cyclo-cross race series based in Portland, Oregon held over an eight-week period during the months of October and November. As of 2005, the series was the largest cyclo-cross series in the United States. The 2006 series consisted of six races plus the U.S. Gran Prix of Cyclocross final (a Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) sanctioned event).  The Cross Crusade began hosting UCI-sanctioned events as part of the series in 2002.\nThe first Cross Crusade was held in 1993, and was an expansion of a three-race series called First Mud, which had only included elite participants, and which had been held since the mid-1980s.\nThere were no races in 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. That was deferred to 2021.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.crosscrusade.com Official Website]\n* \"Mud, Sweat And Gears - How the once-obscure sport of cyclocross has exploded in Portland\" Angela Valdez, Willamette Week, 11/6/2005 http://www.wweek.com/editorial/3201/6934/\n* \"Cross Crusade Moves to Horning's Hideout; 700+ Riders Expected Again\" https://web.archive.org/web/20061106184908/http://www.cyclocrossworld.com/News.cfm?Action=Edit&MenuKey=14&theKey=831&ShowDisabled=0\n* \"Cyclocross Is Colorful.
