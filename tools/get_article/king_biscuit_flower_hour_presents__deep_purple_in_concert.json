It contains concert material recorded on 27 February 1976 at Long Beach Arena, Los Angeles, CA featuring the Mark IV line-up with Tommy Bolin.\nOverview\nThe concert was recorded on 27 February 1976 at Long Beach Arena, Los Angeles, CA. The album also contains four bonus tracks recorded at a Deep Purple concert on 26 January 1976 in Springfield, MA. This concert was originally intended to be used for the King Biscuit broadcast, but imperfections in the recording made the entire show unsuitable for airing and forced the second taping in Long Beach one month later.\nReleases\nThe album was released in the U.K. in June 1995 with the title On the Wings of a Russian Foxbat (Connoisseur DPVSOP CD 217). In 2000, a partial set consisting of ten songs was published by BMG under the name Extended Versions. The album was remastered and re-released with new cover art as Live at Long Beach 1976 on 24 February 2009 by Purple Records. The 2009 edition was re-released by earMusic in 2016 as Long Beach 1976.\nNote the CD1 track listing quotes \"The Grind\" as being performed; this is incorrect as it is the Bolin solo song \"Homeward Strut\".\nTrack listing\nStandard version\nExtended Versions\nLive at Long Beach 1976\n| note2 = Bolin\n| length2 = 2:52\n| title3 = Tommy Bolin Guitar Solo\n| length3 = 10:32\n| title4 = Stormbringer\n| length4 = 10:08\n| title5 = Highway Star\n| length5 = 7:16\n}}\nPersonnel\n;Deep Purple\n*David Coverdale – lead vocals\n*Tommy Bolin – guitars, vocals\n*Jon Lord – keyboards, organ, synthesizers, backing vocals\n*Glenn Hughes – bass, vocals\n*Ian Paice – drums, percussion\n;Production\n*Gary Lyons – mixing and mastering\n*Evert Wilbrink, Steve Ship, Barry Ehrmann, Michael Berrshein – executive producers\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.amazon.com/Live-at-Long-Beach-1976/dp/B001MYIPLY Live at Long Beach 1976''] Amazon"
