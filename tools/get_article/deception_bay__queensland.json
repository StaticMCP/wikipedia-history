In the , Deception Bay had a population of 19,573 people.\nGeography\nleft\nIt is approximately  north of Brisbane CBD in the south-eastern corner of the bay of the same name which separates the Redcliffe Peninsula and Bribie Island.\nThe suburb of Deception Bay takes its name from a small bay in the west of Moreton Bay, south of Pumicestone Passage and north of the Redcliffe Peninsula. In the north of the bay at Beachmere is where the Caboolture River and Burpengary Creek meet the ocean. It was named in 1823 by Lieutenant John Oxley, who thought the bay was a river and because of his mistake and the shallowness, named it Pumice Stone River; he later changed the name to Deception Bay.\nHistory\nThe area's rich history dates back to the Traditional Custodians of the land, the Gubbi Gubbi people, and later to early penal settlement.\nDeception Bay was so named by Lieutenant John Oxley in 1823 who thought the bay was a river and because of his mistake and the shallowness, named it Deception Bay. Today, Deception Bay is often listed as an unusual place name.\nThe area was once large parcels of land supporting dairying and farming and, while some large blocks remain today, most have been subdivided to provide housing for a growing community.\nDeception Bay Provisional School opened on 7 November 1892.

Much of their research was conducted at Deception Bay. The monument was erected by the Queensland branch of the Australian Medical Association, the Caboolture Shire Council, and the Caboolture Historical Society. Joseph Bancroft was a pioneer in experimenting in native plants for their health properties and, through his meatworks, in the preservation of meat, fish and vegetables. His son, Thomas Lane Bancroft, carried on the tradition with some work in cultivating cotton and castor oil. A rough-hewn pyramidal block of granite stands today on the foreshore highlighting the achievements of these two doctors, and the streets around Dr Bancroft's home, Joseph Street and Bancroft Terrace, are named in his honour.\nThe Deception Bay public library opened in 1978.\nDeception Bay North State School opened on 30 January 1979.\nChrist the King Catholic Primary School opened on 31 January 1979.\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, the suburb acquired a negative reputation due to crime and high unemployment.
