(See Appointments Clause, List of positions filled by presidential appointment with Senate confirmation.)\nPresumptive nominee\nIn United States presidential elections, the term presumptive nominee is used for presidential candidates who are assumed or projected to be their political party's nominee, but have not yet been formally nominated by their party at the party's nominating convention. A candidate is generally considered to become the presumptive nominee of their party when their last serious challenger drops out or when the candidate mathematically clinches the majority of nominating delegates to the convention—whichever comes first. A candidate mathematically clinches a nomination by securing a simple majority (i.e., more than 50 percent) of delegates through the primaries and caucuses prior to the convention. The time at which news organizations begin to refer to a candidate as the \"presumptive nominee\" varies from election to election. The shift in media usage from \"front-runner\" to \"presumptive nominee\" is considered a significant change for a campaign.\nIn the modern era, it is the norm for the major political parties' nominees to be effectively determined well before the party conventions; in the past, however, some conventions have begun with the outcome in doubt, requiring multiple rounds of balloting to select a nominee. The last major party conventions with more than one ballot for president occurred in 1972 for the Democrats and 1948 for the Republicans.\nLosing candidates, after withdrawing from the primary race, often \"release\" their delegates, who typically declare support for the presumptive nominee.\nA presumptive nominee typically will have already selected a vice presidential running mate before the convention—see veepstakes. In the past, the choice of vice presidential nominee has been made by the convention itself.\nThe term \"presumptive nominee\" has been criticized by some commentators; language commentator William Safire called it a \"bogus title\" and preferred the phrase presumed nominee, which was used by The New York Times in 2004.\nSee also\n* List of United States presidential candidates\n* Preselection\n* Prospective parliamentary candidate\nReferences"
