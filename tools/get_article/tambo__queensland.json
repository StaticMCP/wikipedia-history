Tambo is  southeast of the town of Blackall via the Landsborough Highway,  north of Augathella,  north of Charleville,  north west of Toowoomba and approximately  north west of the state capital, Brisbane.\nThe Barcoo River runs through the town and sits near the Grey Range – part of the \"Roof of Queensland\" section of the Great Dividing Range.\nThe Landsborough Highway—part of the National Highway network linking Brisbane and Darwin—passes through Tambo. Tambo is also connected to Springsure and Alpha by the Dawson Developmental Road and the Alpha Tambo Road.\nHistory\nThe area on which the town of Tambo now sits was home of many different Aboriginal groups including the Wadjaling, Wadjalad, Wadjabangai, and Pitjara.\nThe first European exploration of the district was by Sir Thomas Mitchell, popularly known as \"Major Mitchell\", in 1846.  For approximately the next 15 years the area was unused until selectors began taking land in 1861.\nThe town of Carrangarra was founded in 1863, making it the oldest town in western Queensland. Like much of the west, sheep became the mainstay of the economy. The settlement was renamed Tambo in 1868. The name Tambo comes from an Indigenous Australian word, meaning hidden place, or \"resting place, fish, shady waters, hidden waters, a secluded spot, hidden place and native yam.\"\nA branch of the Queensland National Bank was first established in 1875.\nTambo State School opened on 28 February 1876.\nA Bush Mission church was built from timber in 1877 for Reverend Peter Campbell, an itinerant preacher.

It was a timber church in Edward Street. It was totally destroyed in a cyclone on Sunday 9 January 1938. Anglican services were held in the Council Chambers. In 1947, the land in Edward Street was sold to the Queensland Country Women's Association for a student hostel and land was purchased in Arthur Street for a new church. After overcoming many difficulties, a replacement church was finally opened in October 1952 by Bishop James Housden. A hall was built at the rear of the church in 1964.\nUntil 2008, Tambo was the administrative centre of the Shire of Tambo.
