The Reserve Grounds are surrounded by the town of Fort Qu'Appelle. In the 2016 Canadian Census, they recorded a population of 15 living in 6 of their 8 total private dwellings.\nAll bands are signatories to Treaty 4. This Reserve may belong to Assiniboine Chief Long Lodge #77, who was a treaty signatory chief to Treaty 4 in 1877 at Cypress Hills. Further this land was designated to be shared by all Treaty 4 bands in 1996 to commemorate the signing of the Treaty Land Entitlement agreements between First Nation and the Provincial and Federal Governments. It was given the #77 after this.\nList of bands sharing the reserve\n*Carry the Kettle Nakoda First Nation\n*Coté First Nation\n*Cowessess First Nation\n*Day Star First Nation\n*Fishing Lake First Nation\n*Gambler First Nation\n*George Gordon First Nation\n*Kahkewistahaw First Nation\n*Kawacatoose First Nation\n*Keeseekoose First Nation\n*Kinistin Saulteaux Nation\n*Little Black Bear First Nation\n*Muscowpetung Saulteaux Nation\n*Muskowekwan First Nation\n*Nekaneet Cree Nation\n*Ocean Man First Nation\n*Ochapowace Nation\n*Okanese First Nation\n*Pasqua First Nation\n*Peepeekisis Cree Nation\n*Pheasant Rump Nakota First Nation\n*Piapot First Nation\n*Pine Creek First Nation\n*Rolling River First Nation\n*Sapotaweyak Cree Nation\n*Star Blanket Cree Nation\n*The Key First Nation\n*Tootinaowaziibeeng Treaty Reserve\n*Waywayseecappo First Nation\n*White Bear First Nations\n*Wuskwi Sipihk First Nation\n*Yellow Quill First Nation\n*Zagime Anishinabek\nSee also\n* List of Indian reserves in Saskatchewan\nReferences"
