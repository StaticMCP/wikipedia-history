Initially it was held in even-numbered years, with the Ryder Cup being held in odd numbered years. However, the cancellation of the 2001 Ryder Cup due to the September 11 attacks pushed both tournaments back a year, and the Presidents Cup was then held in odd-numbered years. It reverted to even-number years following the postponement of the 2020 Ryder Cup due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is hosted alternately in the United States and countries represented by the International Team.\nSince 2018, the International team has competed under a specifically designed logo and flag, designed by Ernie Els and artist Jeff Costa, based on the shield-shaped patches worn by military units. In previous competitions various symbols were used; in 2016 a light-blue flag with five gold stars, one for each continent that can supply players, but this was judged to be too similar to the Flag of Europe.\nThe next Presidents Cup will be held in 2026 at Medinah Country Club in Medinah, Illinois, United States.\nFormat\nThe scoring system of the event is match play. The format is drawn from the Ryder Cup and consists of 12 players per side. Each team has a captain, usually a highly respected golf figure, who is responsible for choosing the pairs in the doubles events, which consist of both alternate shot and best ball formats (also known as \"foursomes\" and \"fourball\" matches respectively). Each match, whether it be a doubles or singles match, is worth one point with a half-point awarded to each team in the event of a halved match.\nThere have been frequent small changes to the format, although the final day has always consisted of 12 singles matches. The contest was extended from three days to four in 2000. In 2015, there were nine foursome doubles matches, nine fourball doubles matches, and 12 singles matches. With a total of 30 points, a team needed to get 15.5 points to win the Cup.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! rowspan=2|Year !! colspan=2|Day 1 !! colspan=2|Day 2 !! colspan=2|Day 3 !! rowspan=2|Day 4 !! rowspan=2|TotalPoints\n|-\n!

Upon a tie, the captains would reveal the players who would play a sudden-death match to determine the winner. In 2003, however, the tiebreaker match ended after three holes because of darkness, and the captains, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus, agreed that the Cup would be shared by both teams.\nFrom 2005 to 2013, singles matches ending level at the end of the regulation 18 holes were to be extended to extra holes until the match was won outright. All singles matches would continue in this format until one team reaches the required point total to win the Presidents Cup. Remaining singles matches were only to be played to the regulation 18 holes and could be halved. Although this rule was in force for five Presidents Cup contests, no matches actually went beyond 18 holes.\nHistory\nThe event was created and is organized by the PGA Tour.\nEach contest has an Honorary Chairman or Chairwoman, the head of state or head of government of the host nation.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Chairman or Chairwoman\n!Title\n|-\n|1994\n| Gerald Ford\n|38th President of the United States\n|-\n|1996\n| George H.

The net proceeds are distributed to charities nominated by the players, captains, and captains' assistants. The first ten Presidents Cups raised over US$32 million for charities around the world.\nResults\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year !!Venue !!Location !!Winning team !!Score !!U.S. captain !!International captain\n|-\n|2024\n|Royal Montreal Golf Club (2) || Montreal, Quebec, Canada\n|\n|align=\"center\"|18–11\n|Jim Furyk\n|&nbsp;Mike Weir\n|-\n|2022\n|Quail Hollow Club || Charlotte, North Carolina, United States\n|\n|align=\"center\"|17–12\n|Davis Love III\n|&nbsp;Trevor Immelman\n|-\n|2019\n|Royal Melbourne Golf Club (3)\n|Melbourne, Victoria, Australia\n|\n|align=\"center\"|16–14\n|Tiger Woods\n|&nbsp;Ernie Els\n|-\n|2017\n|Liberty National Golf Club || Jersey City, New Jersey, United States\n|\n|align=\"center\"|19–11\n|Steve Stricker\n|&nbsp;Nick Price (3)\n|-\n|2015\n|Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea || Incheon, South Korea\n|\n|align=\"center\"|15–14\n|Jay Haas\n|&nbsp;Nick Price (2)\n|-\n|2013\n|Muirfield Village || Dublin, Ohio, United States\n|\n|align=\"center\"|18–15\n|Fred Couples (3)\n|&nbsp;Nick Price\n|-\n|2011\n|Royal Melbourne Golf Club (2) || Melbourne, Victoria, Australia\n|\n|align=\"center\"|19–15\n|Fred Couples (2)\n|&nbsp;Greg Norman (2)\n|-\n|2009\n|Harding Park Golf Club || San Francisco, California, United States\n|\n|align=\"center\"|19–14\n|Fred Couples\n|&nbsp;Greg Norman\n|-\n|2007\n|Royal Montreal Golf Club || Montreal, Quebec, Canada\n|\n|align=\"center\"|19–14\n|Jack Nicklaus (4)\n|&nbsp;Gary Player (3)\n|-\n|2005\n|Robert Trent Jones Golf Club (4)|| Gainesville, Virginia, United States\n|\n|align=\"center\"|18–15\n|Jack Nicklaus (3)\n|&nbsp;Gary Player (2)\n|-\n|2003\n|Fancourt Hotel and Country Club || George, Western Cape, South Africa\n|Tied\n|align=\"center\"|17–17\n|Jack Nicklaus (2)\n|&nbsp;Gary Player\n|-\n|2000\n|Robert Trent Jones Golf Club (3)|| Gainesville, Virginia, United States\n|\n|align=\"center\"|21–10\n|Ken Venturi\n|&nbsp;Peter Thomson (3)\n|-\n|1998\n|Royal Melbourne Golf Club || Melbourne, Victoria, Australia\n|International Team\n|align=\"center\"|20–11\n|Jack Nicklaus\n|&nbsp;Peter Thomson (2)\n|-\n|1996\n|Robert Trent Jones Golf Club (2)|| Gainesville, Virginia, United States\n|\n|align=\"center\"|16–15\n|Arnold Palmer\n|&nbsp;Peter Thomson\n|-\n|1994\n|Robert Trent Jones Golf Club || Gainesville, Virginia, United States\n|\n|align=\"center\"|20–12\n|Hale Irwin\n|&nbsp;David Graham\n|}\nChampions by team\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Nationality!!Wins\n|-\n| || align=center|13\n|-\n|International Team || align=center|1\n|-\n|Shared || align=center|1\n|}\nFuture venues\n*2026 Medinah Country Club, Medinah, Illinois, United States\n*2028 Kingston Heath Golf Club, Cheltenham, Victoria, Australia\n*2030 Bellerive Country Club, Town and Country, Missouri, United States\nRecords\n*Most appearances on a team: 12° Phil Mickelson (USA), 1994–2017\n*Most points: 32° Phil Mickelson (USA) (26–16–13 record)\n*Most singles points won: 7° Tiger Woods (USA) (7–2–0 record)\n*Most foursomes points won: 14° Phil Mickelson (USA) (12–6–4 record)\n*Most fourball points won: 13° Phil Mickelson (USA) (10–5–6 record)\n*Most points in a single contest: 5° Mark O'Meara (USA) 1996° Shigeki Maruyama (Int) 1998° Tiger Woods (USA) 2009° Jim Furyk (USA) 2011° Branden Grace (Int) 2015° Jordan Spieth (USA) 2022\n*Youngest player: ° Ryo Ishikawa (Int) 2009\n*Oldest player: ° Jay Haas (USA) 2003\nSources\nSee also\n*List of American Presidents Cup golfers\n*List of International Presidents Cup golfers\n*Junior Presidents Cup\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
