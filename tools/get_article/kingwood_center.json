He led Ohio Brass into new ventures, particularly the manufacture of electrical fittings for railroads and trolleys. Mr. King was responsible for  much of the company's success and he eventually became president and chairman of the Board of Ohio Brass. Mr. King was married and divorced  twice, and had no children.( The 1928 Architectural Record (Vol. LXIII, No.6, P.86) shows a floorplan of the house with a clear indication of \"Son's Bedroom.\")\nThe house and grounds were built in 1926 for King and his second wife, Luise, with grounds designed by Cleveland landscape architecture firm Pitkin and Mott. One year after  his  death  in  1952, the 47-acre estate opened as a public garden to a  private  foundation  that  continues  to  operate Kingwood Center today. On November 7, 1976, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\nCurrent\nIn 1953 the estate became a public garden. The gardens are now open daily from 10am to 7pm.
