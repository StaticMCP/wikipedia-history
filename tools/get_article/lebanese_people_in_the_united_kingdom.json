The exodus was aggravated in 1982 with the Israeli invasion.\nDemographics\nThe 2001 UK Census recorded 10,459 Lebanese-born people. The 2011 census recorded 15,341 people born in Lebanon residing in England, 228 in Wales, 314 in Scotland and 52 in Northern Ireland. However, the number including those not born in Lebanon has been estimated to be around 90 thousand, according to Arab News in 2018.\nEdgware Road in London is one of a number of areas that the Lebanese community has settled in and has shops selling Arabic newspapers, books and music. Other areas with Lebanese communities in London include Bayswater, Kensington and Westbourne Grove.\nNotable individuals\nSee also\n* Lebanon–United Kingdom relations\n* British Arabs\n* Arabs in the United Kingdom\n* Arabs in Europe\n* Lebanese diaspora\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.britishlebanese.org/ British Lebanese Association]\n* [http://www.blbg.org/ British Lebanese Business Group]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20010721210905/http://lbfnm.org/ Lebanese British Friends of the National Museum]\n* [http://www.irishlebanese.com Irish Lebanese Cultural Foundation]\n* [http://www.lebanesecommunity.co.uk Lebanese Community North of England]"
