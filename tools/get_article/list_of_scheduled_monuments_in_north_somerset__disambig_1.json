Its area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in the town hall in Weston-super-Mare. North Somerset borders the local government areas of Bristol, Bath and North East Somerset, Mendip and Sedgemoor. North Somerset contains the parliamentary constituencies of Weston-super-Mare and North Somerset.\nA scheduled monument is a nationally important archaeological site or monument which is given legal protection by being placed on a list (or \"schedule\") by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport; English Heritage takes the leading role in identifying such sites. The legislation governing this is the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. The term \"monument\" can apply to the whole range of archaeological sites, and they are not always visible above ground. Such sites have to have been deliberately constructed by human activity. They range from prehistoric standing stones and burial sites, through Roman remains and medieval structures such as castles and monasteries, to later structures such as industrial sites and buildings constructed for the World Wars or the Cold War.\nThere are 68 scheduled monuments in North Somerset. The oldest site Aveline's Hole, a cave in which bones from the Mesolithic have been identified making it the earliest scientifically dated cemetery in Britain. There are also multiple Neolithic tumuli. There are also several Iron Age hillforts, such as the one at Worlebury Camp. Dolebury Warren, another Iron Age hillfort, was reused as a medieval rabbit warren. The Romano-British period is represented with sites including villas. Sites from the Middle Ages include motte-and-bailey castles, such as Locking Castle, and church crosses. There are also several deserted medieval settlements. Woodspring Priory is a former Augustinian priory founded in the early 13th century. More recent sites date from the Industrial Revolution and include the Elms colliery and glassworks in Nailsea. The most recent monuments are two Palmerstonian gun batteries, built in the 1860s, on the island of Steep Holm. The monuments are listed below using the titles given in the English Heritage data sheets.\nMonuments\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed = 3 September 1992\n| grid_ref = ST 47626 58676\n| lat = 51.3247\n| lon = -2.7533\n| show_notes = yes\n| notes = Aveline's Hole is a limestone cave in Burrington Combe.

It is owned by the National Trust, who acquired the freehold in 1983, and managed by the Avon Wildlife Trust. Standing on a limestone ridge on the northern edge of the Mendip Hills, it was made into a hillfort during the Iron Age and was occupied into the Roman period. The extensive fort covers  with single or double defensive ramparts around it. The name Dolebury Warren comes from its use during the medieval or post medieval periods as a rabbit warren. The topography and differing soil types provide a habitat for an unusually wide range of plants, attracting a variety of insects including butterflies.\n| uid = 1008184\n| show_img = yes\n| image = Doleburyhillfort.jpg\n| upload_desc =\n| show_ref = yes\n| reference =\n| commonscat = Dolebury Warren\n| show_wikidata= no\n| wikidata = Q5288920\n}}\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed = 20 May 1996\n| grid_ref = ST 45672 74247\n| lat = 51.4646\n| lon = -2.7834\n| show_notes = yes\n| notes = Earthworks of an 18th century six pipe duck decoy.\n| uid = 1015949\n| show_img = yes\n| image =\n| upload_desc =\n| show_ref = yes\n| reference =\n| commonscat =\n| show_wikidata= no\n| wikidata =\n}}\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed =\n| grid_ref = ST 48218 70558\n| lat = 51.4316\n| lon = -2.7463\n| show_notes = yes\n| notes = Three buildings survive from the Elms Colliery, also known as Middle Engine Pit, which operated from the late 18th century until closure in the 1850s.

Excavations in 1902 identified the remains of a small stone chamber surrounded by a ditch. Fragments of pottery and the remains of a sword were also found. The origin of the castle is unclear. It may have been part of the manor of Kewstoke or alternatively Hutton. The two manors were combined and given by Henry I to Geoffrey de Dun. In 1214 Locking was given to Woodspring Priory and would have ceased to have military significance.\n| uid = 1008301\n| show_img = yes\n| image = Locking Castle Golf Course - geograph.org.uk - 84446.jpg\n| upload_desc =\n| show_ref = yes\n| reference =\n| commonscat =\n| show_wikidata= no\n| wikidata = Q6665656\n}}\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed = 15 October 1976\n| grid_ref = ST 32641 66044\n| lat = 51.3894\n| lon = -2.9694\n| show_notes = yes\n| notes = A motte-and-bailey castle was constructed on Sand Point and Middle Hope after the Norman Conquest.\n| uid = 1008114\n| show_img = yes\n| image =\n| upload_desc =\n| show_ref = yes\n| reference =\n| commonscat =\n| show_wikidata= no\n| wikidata =\n}}\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed =\n| grid_ref = ST 36172 63707\n| lat = 51.3688\n| lon = -2.9182\n| show_notes = yes\n| notes = Castle Batch was a motte constructed by the Norman lord Walter of Douai between the Norman conquest of England in 1066 and 1086. It was built on a ridge above the surrounding area, with a mound that is now  high and  across, surrounded by a ditch up to  wide. The entrance was probably on the north side of the motte. A possible bailey has been identified alongside the motte. Although typically characterised as a motte, the mound has a slight indentation in the centre and historian Stuart Prior considers the mound to have been a ringwork.\n| uid = 1011131\n| show_img = yes\n| image = Castle Batch Recreational Area - geograph.org.uk - 84437.jpg\n| upload_desc =\n| show_ref = yes\n| reference =\n| commonscat =\n| show_wikidata= no\n| wikidata = Q5049991\n}}\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed = 2 November 2004\n| grid_ref = ST 47677 70843\n| lat = 51.4342\n| lon = -2.7541\n| show_notes = yes\n| notes = The remaining site and buildings of a glassworks which operated from 1788 until 1874.

Formerly it was considerably higher. On being opened and essentially destroyed between 1787 and 1835 it was found to contain two rows of cells, running from south to north, formed by immense stones set edgeways, and covered by others of larger dimensions.

The priory was founded, by William de Courtney, in the early 13th century. It was dissolved in 1536 and then owned by local noblemen and leased to local farmers. In 1968 the priory and adjoining land of Middle Hope was purchased by the National Trust as part of Project Neptune. The following year the priory was taken over by the Landmark Trust who spent 20 years on restoration work, and now rent out the farmhouse as holiday accommodation. The surviving buildings include the priory church, which was a 15th century replacement for the earlier 13th century structure, infirmary, barn and 16th century prior's lodging which was converted into a farmhouse. The whole site was arranged around a central cloister from which only the east wall and west wall of the chapter house remain, the sacristy, refectory, chapter house, lady chapel and parlour having been demolished.\n| uid = 1012722\n| show_img = yes\n| image = Woodspring Priory, west wall of cloister.jpg\n| upload_desc =\n| show_ref = yes\n| reference =\n| commonscat = Woodspring Priory\n| show_wikidata= no\n| wikidata = Q8033383\n}}\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed = 22 February 1915\n| grid_ref = ST 31282 62493\n| lat = 51.3574\n| lon = -2.9852\n| show_notes = yes\n| notes = Worlebury Camp is an Iron Age hillfort once stood atop Worlebury Hill.
