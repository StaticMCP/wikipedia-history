As a State Museum, Ranggawarsita Museum is officially known as the State Museum of Central Java Province (Museum Negeri Propinsi Jawa Tengah). The museum displays ethnographic collections of items related with the culture of the Province of Central Java\nHistory\nA plot of land was chosen near the Ahmad Yani International Airport to be constructed a state museum for the province of Central Java. Construction of the museum commenced in 1977. The museum starts operating in 1983 following its inauguration by the governor of Central Java at that time, Soepardjo Roestam, on April 2, 1983. Later, the museum was re-inaugurated on 5 July 1989 by the Minister of Education Fuad Hassan and was managed by the Directorate of Culture. After the regional autonomy scheme was enacted, the management of the museum was transferred to the Education and Cultural Department of Central Java on October 14, 1996. In 2011, the museum was refurbished.\nThe name Ranggawarsita was chosen after Raden Ngabehi Ranggawarsita, a Javanese poet who was born into a famous literary family in Surakarta, Central Java.\nCollection\nThe museum housed a collection of almost 60,000 objects related with the culture of West Java. The collections are displayed in four houses, each corresponds to different theme based on its history.\nBuilding A housed items related with geology, geography, and paleontology.

Collections from this period are statues of lingam-yoni, linga and yoni, jugs, bronze mirrors, and statues of Hindu gods taken from the candis of Central Java. Building B also features objects from the Muslim states period of Indonesia e.g. a miniature of the Great Mosque of Demak and Menara Kudus Mosque, fragment of terracotas or ornaments found from old mosques, e.g. from the Mantingan Mosque, a mustaka roof finial taken from mosques, and a hand-written copy of the Qur'an. Ceramics (both local, Chinese, and European) and batik cloths with emphasize on motifs found in Central Java are kept in the first floor of Building B, as well as objects from the colonial period especially those related with Diponegoro.\nThe ground floor of Building C displayed items related with the history of Indonesia during the struggle for the independence period.
