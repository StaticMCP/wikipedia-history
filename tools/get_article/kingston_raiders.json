The team played out of the Kingston Memorial Centre.\nTeam history\nWhen the Kingston Canadians were sold in 1988, the club's name was changed to Kingston Raiders for the 1988–89 season by the new owner, Lou Kazowski. After a dismal season in 1987–88, he hoped that the team could acquire the \"tough\" image of the Los Angeles Raiders football team by adopting their name and new  black and silver uniforms, similar to those recently adopted by the NHL's Los Angeles Kings. In their only season of existence, the Raiders finished 7th in the Leyden division and did not qualify for the playoffs.\nThe team's coach was Larry Mavety. It was his first year in Kingston after many years coaching the Belleville Bulls. Larry would also go on to coach the Frontenacs in two different stints.\nKazowski was extremely unpopular locally, and after a number of disputes with the OHL and an unsuccessful season, he was encouraged to sell the team and was effectively barred from future ownership. The new owners included Wren Blair and Bob Attersley, who renamed the team Kingston Frontenacs after the EPHL team of which they had both been members.\nPlayers\nThe Kingston Raiders had the first overall pick in the draft that year and chose Drake Berehowsky. Berehowsky would win the Jack Ferguson Award for being the first overall draft pick.\nJeff Wilson won the F.W. \"Dinty\" Moore Trophy, for the best goals against average for a rookie goaltender (1988–89).\nFrom this team, six players made the NHL.\nThe last remaining active former member of the Kingston Raiders was Justin Morrison, who played his final OHL game in the 1992–93 season.\nNHL alumni\n*[http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayersByTeam.jsp?team=Kingston+Raiders Source]\nSeason stats 1988–1989\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
