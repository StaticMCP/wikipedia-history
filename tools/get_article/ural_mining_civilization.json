Of the approximately 500 industrial cities established in Russia from the early 18th to the mid-19th century, over half were established in this region. These cities made the Ural not only the area of largest industrial construction, but also the world's largest metallurgy center. The rapid economic growth in the region contributed to the development of Siberia and Far-Eastern Russia.\nThe period is defined by a \"distinctive\" culture. Cities in the region had a specific purpose and style of design. By the beginning of the 19th century, these industrial cities had grown large enough to have architectural ensembles - both a governorate (regional) architect, and architects of mining factories and areas.\nSee also\n* History of Metallurgy in the Urals\nReferences\nBibliography\n* [https://issuu.com/bonikowski/docs/history_and_ecology_titulforzatzpro History and ecology] : essays on the origins of historical hydrogeography.
