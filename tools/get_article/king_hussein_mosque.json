The mosque is located at an altitude of  above sea level and can thus be seen from most parts of Amman. It is square and features four minarets and marble floors.\nProphet Mohammad Museum\n| dissolved =\n| location =\n| type = Religious museum about Muhammad\n| accreditation =\n| key_holdings = Some of Muhammad's alleged belongings\n| collections =\n| collection_size =\n| visitors =\n| founder =\n| executive_director =\n| deputy_director =\n| leader_type =\n| leader =\n| director =\n| president =\n| ceo =\n| chairperson =\n| curator =\n| architect =\n| historian =\n| website =\n}}\nThe Prophet Mohammad Museum is a religious museum about Muhammad, located in the King Hussein Mosque. The museum was opened on 15 May 2012, with King Abdullah II officiating. The museum includes some of Muhammad's alleged belongings, including a single hair from his beard, his letter to the emperor of Byzantium, in which he urged him to convert to Islam, and the sapling of the Sahabi Tree, a tree in the Jordanian desert where a tradition says Muhammad rested under it.\nGallery\nKing Hussain Mosque 2.JPG|Exterior of the mosque\nKing Hussain Mosque, Amman, Jordan 2.JPG|Exterior of the mosque\nAlHussain mosque4.jpg|Exterior of the mosque\nAlHussain mosque.jpg|Exterior of the mosque\nAlHussain mosque2.jpg|Mosque entrance\nKing Hussein Mosque (Amman) at night.jpg|The main mosque building\nDefense.gov photo essay 070416-D-7203T-007.jpg|Interior of the mosque\nKing Hussein Mosque - Al Hussein Public Parks.jpg|The mosque at night, as seen from West Amman\nSee also\n}}\n* Islam in Jordan\n* List of mosques in Jordan\nReferences\nExternal links"
