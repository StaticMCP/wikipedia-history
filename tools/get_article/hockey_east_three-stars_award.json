      "text": "# Hockey East Three-Stars Award\n\nThe Hockey East Three-Stars Award is an annual award given out at the conclusion of the Hockey East regular season to the player who has the highest number of points with respect to being named a star-of-the-game. At the conclusion of each game the members of the media decide the three stars of the game, awarding five points for being named as the first star, three points for a second star and one point for a third star. Only conference games are counted in the standings for the Three-Stars Award.\nThe Three-Stars Award was first bestowed in 2001 and every year thereafter. The overall standings have resulted in a tie six times, the latest instance being the second three-way tie in 2020–21. In 2022–23, Lane Hutson became the first defenceman to win the award in league history.\nAward winners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Year !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Winner !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Position !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| School !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Ref\n|-\n| 2000–01 || Brian Gionta || Right Wing || Boston College ||\n|-\n| 2001–02 || Colin Hemingway || Right Wing || New Hampshire ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|2002–03 || Ben Eaves || Center || Boston College ||rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n| Joe Exter || Goaltender || Merrimack\n|-\n| 2003–04 || Keni Gibson || Goaltender || Northeastern ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|2004–05 || Patrick Eaves || Right Wing || Boston College ||rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n| Ryan Shannon || Center || Boston College\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|2005–06 || Chris Collins || Left Wing || Boston College ||rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n| Cory Schneider || Goaltender || Boston College\n|-\n| 2006–07 || John Curry || Goaltender || Boston University ||\n|-\n| 2007–08 || Bryan Ewing || Center || Boston University ||\n|-\n| 2008–09 || Brad Thiessen || Goaltender || Northeastern ||\n|-\n| 2009–10 || Bobby Butler || Right Wing || New Hampshire ||\n|-\n| 2010–11 || Paul Thompson || Right Wing || New Hampshire ||\n|-\n| 2011–12 || Kieran Millan || Goaltender || Boston University ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|2012–13 || John Henrion || Center || New Hampshire ||rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n| Martin Ouellette || Goaltender || Maine\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Year !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Winner !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Position !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| School !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Ref\n|-\n| 2013–14 || Clay Witt || Goaltender || Northeastern ||\n|-\n| 2014–15 || Jack Eichel || Center || Boston University ||\n|-\n| 2015–16 || Kevin Boyle || Goaltender || UMass Lowell ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"|2016–17 || Anders Bjork || Forward || Notre Dame ||rowspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n| Clayton Keller || Forward ||Boston University\n|-\n| Tyler Kelleher || Forward || New Hampshire\n|-\n| 2017–18 || Adam Gaudette || Forward || Northeastern ||\n|-\n| 2018–19 || Cayden Primeau || Goaltender || Northeastern ||\n|-\n| 2019–20 || John Leonard || Forward || Massachusetts ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"|2020–21 || Jonny Evans || Forward || Connecticut ||rowspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n| Aidan McDonough || Forward ||Northeastern\n|-\n| Marc McLaughlin || Forward || Boston College\n|-\n| 2021–22 || Devon Levi || Goaltender ||Northeastern ||\n|-\n| 2022–23 || Lane Hutson || Defenceman ||Boston University ||\n|-\n| 2023–24 || Macklin Celebrini || Center || Boston University ||\n|-\n| 2024–25 || Ryan Leonard || Forward || Boston College ||\n|}\nWinners by school\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| School !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Winners\n|-\n|Boston College || 8\n|-\n|Boston University || 7\n|-\n|Northeastern || 7\n|-\n|New Hampshire || 5\n|-\n|Connecticut || 1\n|-\n|Maine || 1\n|-\n|Massachusetts || 1\n|-\n|Merrimack || 1\n|-\n|Notre Dame || 1\n|-\n|UMass Lowell || 1\n|}\nWinners by position\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Position !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Winners\n|-\n| Center || 6\n|-\n| Right Wing || 5\n|-\n| Left Wing || 1\n|-\n| Forward || 9\n|-\n| Defenceman || 1\n|-\n| Goaltender || 11\n|}\nSee also\n*Hockey East Awards\nReferences\nGeneral\n*\n*\n*\nSpecific\nExternal links\n*[http://www.collegehockeynews.com/reports/confinfo.php?c=5&d=history Hockey East Awards (Incomplete)]"
