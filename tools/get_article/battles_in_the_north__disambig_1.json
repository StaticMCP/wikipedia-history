This is the first album where the concept of Blashyrkh becomes a central focus. It is the last album to feature Abbath on drums.\nBackground\nThe songs \"Cursed Realms of the Winterdemons\" and \"Circling Above in Time Before Time\" reference The Underdark, a setting from Dungeons & Dragons.\nMusic videos were made for \"Blashyrkh (Mighty Ravendark)\" and \"Grim and Frostbitten Kingdoms\", the latter featuring Hellhammer on drums, who also became the band's touring drummer during this period.\nRelease\nThe album was issued in multiple formats, including the standard CD, a limited edition digipak, a limited edition digipak with embossed band logo and album title, cassette tape, a jewel case with slip cover, fold-out poster and bonus tracks taken from the Immortal EP (limited to 3000 copies), and a limited edition LP released under Osmose Productions (re-pressed six times over the years starting in 2005).
