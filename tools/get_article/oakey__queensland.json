The Museum of Army Aviation is located at Oakey Airport. In the , the locality of Oakey had a population of 4,756 people.\nGeography\nThe town is situated on the eastern side of the Darling Downs and the Toowoomba Region local government area.  Oakey Creek, a tributary of the Condamine River, passes through the town.\nOakey is one of the towns contained in the Queensland State Electoral district of Condamine and at the federal level it lies within the Division of Groom.\nThe town is surrounded by farms.\nThe town is bypassed by the Warrego Highway (National A2). The Western railway line connects Toowoomba with south-western Queensland; it passes through the locality which is served by two railway stations:\n* Boolee railway station, on a spur line west of the town ()\n* Oakey railway station, serving the town ()\nOakey Airport is an airport (). It is located on the site of the World War 2 airbase. The Oakey Army Aviation Centre is the major user of the airport.\nHistory\nOakey and the creek around which the town is located were named for the river oaks that dominate the banks of the creek.\n19th century\nThe area was first settled in the early 1840s when pastoralists moved into the area and found the land to be suitable for grazing.\nIn 1859, the Jondaryan Woolshed was built to the west of the town to service the rapidly growing wool industry. The first shearing took place in 1861.  The Jondaryan pastoral station dominated the area, encompassing over . The woolshed was responsible for over 200,000 head of sheep and could cater for in excess of 50 shearers working simultaneously. Following World War I, the homestead landholding was reduced and separated to allow for soldier settlement programs.\nThe building of the Western railway line through the area in 1867 prompted the growth of a township to service the pastoral community. Growth of the town was slow, however featured some enterprising ventures, including a short-lived meatworks near the town, which planned to tin and export kangaroo and wallaby under the marketing name 'Australian Game'. The enterprise was unsuccessful and closed down in 1876.\nThe town was surveyed in 1868, with the first sale being 28 June 1870. Originally named Oaky, the spelling of Oakey was officially adopted in August 1940.\nOakey Creek Post Office opened on 1 June 1869. It was renamed Oakey by 1878.\nOakey Creek Vested School opened on 10 August 1874, with a number of celebrations:\"A grand picnic and ball was held here on the 3rd instant in honor of the opening of the above school. The school-house is a neat weatherboard building, shingled, and with a verandah on each side, and capable of accommodating between sixty and seventy children, and will amply supply the requirements of the district for years to come. The teacher's residence is a smart little four roomed cottage, but I should think rather small. The appointment of Mr. Tait as teacher is sure to give satisfaction.\"The school was later renamed Oakey Creek State School. In 1905, it was renamed Oakey State School.\n20th century\nScots Presbyterian Church opened in 1906. A new church was built in 1957.\nSt Monica's Catholic Church was opened on Sunday 14 February 1909 by Reverend D. Fouhy. The land was  and the church was a Gothic structure,  with  walls, capable of seating 200 people. Messrs Marks and Lane were the architects and Mr Andrews was the contractor. The church was enlarged in 1919 to accommodate a school. A new brick church was built in 1957.\nThe Cooyar railway line serviced the areas to the north of Oakey between 1913 and 1968.  Between 1914 and 1984 the area to the southwest was serviced by the Cecil Plains railway line.\nSt Monica's Catholic School was officially opened on Sunday 26 October 1919 by Archbishop James Duhig. The church building had been enlarged to accommodate both the church and the school.\nThe Oakey War Memorial in Campbell Street was unveiled on 28 August 1922 by the Governor of Queensland, Sir Matthew Nathan. It was made \"of Rockhampton marble on a pedestal of sandstone, with a polished granite centre piece, on which are inscribed in gold letters the names of no fewer than 332 soldiers of the Oakey district who took part in the Great War.\"\nThe Country Women's Association opened a branch in Oakey in 1924, which was noted to be 'thriving' in 1925, and celebrated 90 years of activity in 2014.\nThe racehorse Bernborough was foaled at Rosalie Plains in 1939. He became well-known on the tracks around Toowoomba. Eventually the horse was sold to a businessman in Sydney and raced in three states, winning 15 consecutive races between 22 December 1945 and 19 October 1946.\nDuring World War II, the requirement for aircraft maintenance and construction exceeded the capabilities of Brisbane-based facilities. To expand the capability, a  site at Oakey was purchased to facilitate the raising of Number 6 Aircraft Depot (6AD). An airbase was sited approximately  north of the town, and runways were built. With a full complement of RAAF personnel, the base housed almost 2,000 troops. The Depot serviced, assembled and conducted test flights of Bristol Beaufort, P-51 Mustang, Norsemen, CAC Wirraway and Supermarine Spitfire aircraft. This airfield became an Army Aviation Training Centre in the 1970s, now  Swartz Barracks, a major helicopter pilot and maintenance training facility for the Defence forces.\nAfter the war, the Oakey airport was serviced by Macair Airlines commercial air services originating in Brisbane, however the failure of Macair saw services commenced by Skytrans Airlines being routed via Toowoomba. The establishment of the Wellcamp Airport south of the town, servicing Toowoomba, saw Skytrans being replaced by Qantaslink and REX airlines, and the reduction of airspace for the Army Aviation Centre.\nThe Oakey Veterinary Hospital was established in 1952.\nOakey State High School opened on 28 January 1964. Since 1916, there was community interest in the establishment of a high school in Oakey, with the disadvantage of \"scholars having to reside in Dalby, Warwick, or Toowoomba, after passing the examination\" acting as a deterrent to many parents from pursuing higher education for their children. In response to a skills shortage in transport and logistics Oakey State High developed an innovative program called \"Transport and Logistics Employees for our Community\".  In 2007, the successful partnership between school, training organisations and industry was recognised as the winner of the Showcase Award for Excellence in Community or Industry Partnerships by the Department of Education, Training and Employment.\nIn 1975, Jondaryan Woolshed Historical Museum and Park was established to present the history of Jondaryan Station and its role in the development of pastoralism on the Darling Downs. The woolshed has been in continuous operation since it was built.\nOakey State School celebrated its centenary in 1974.\nThe Oakey Library opened in 1975 and underwent a major refurbishment in 2014.\nOn Sunday 31 May 1987, the Oakey Uniting Church was officially opened and dedicated by Reverend Barry Dangerfield, the Queensland Moderator of the Uniting Church in Australia. The hall beside the church was formerly the Maclagan Union Church.\nThe Oakey Power Station is a 332&nbsp;MW dual liquid/gas-fired plant and was commissioned in December 1999.\n21st century\nThe main town centre was redeveloped during 2005 by the council and now includes new shops, landscaping and tree plantings.\nIn January 2011 the Oakey Creek flooded, impacting 120 homes and businesses. In 2014 a Flood Early Warning System was installed upstream.\nIn 2014, the Department of Defense investigated a contamination caused by fire-fighting foams used at the Army Aviation Training Centre and warned residents not to drink bore water.  The chemicals have been identified as perfluorooctane sulphonate and perfluorooctanoic acid.  The chemicals were used from 1970 until 2008.  A lack of testing of these chemicals means no conclusive impact on human health has been proven. In 2020, a class action by residents by Oakey, Katherine, and Williamtown (all communities where the fire-fighting foams were used) was successful in establishing that news of the foam contamination had caused property prices in the affected communities to plummet. In December 2021, a 3-year study conducted by the Australian National University announced they did not find conclusive evidence of an increased risk of cancer or other disease because of the contamination.\nLocal government administration\nOakey has been part of Toowoomba Regional Council since 2008. However, like many small towns in regional Queensland it has been administered by various local government entities over its history.\n# Jondaryan Division (1879–1903)\n# Jondaryan Shire (1903–2008) gaining Gowrie Shire (1903–1913) (part) in 1913, losing part to Millmerran (1913–2008) and Pittsworth (1913–2008) in 1913, gaining Newtown (1913–1917) (part) in 1917, gaining Drayton (1903–1949) (part) in 1949.\n# Toowoomba Region (2008–present)\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Oakey had a population of 4,529 people.\nIn the , the locality of Oakey had a population of 4,705 people.\nIn the , the locality of Oakey had a population of 4,756 people.\nEconomy\nIndustry is rural based, processing livestock and grain.
