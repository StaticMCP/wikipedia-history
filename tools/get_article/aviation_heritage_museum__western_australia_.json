Created and maintained by the Air Force Association of Western Australia, it houses many military and civilian aircraft, aircraft replicas and aircraft engines, of types that have served in the Royal Australian Air Force or that have relevance to aviation in Western Australia.\nHistory\nThe Western Australian division of the association acquired a Mark 22 Supermarine Spitfire from England in 1959 and erected it on a pole outside its headquarters in Perth. On 1 December 1962 the association acquired an Avro Lancaster from the French.  Many other exhibits of interest to association members and the public were obtained in the following years.  With financial assistance from the Western Australian Government a museum building was erected at the association's memorial estate in Bull Creek, officially opening in November 1979.  In order to house the Avro Lancaster and a Douglas Dakota, the association raised funds and erected a second museum building that was opened in December 1983. Since then many smaller buildings have been added, including a 48,000 book library, photo lab, workshop, model repair shop and technical library.\nThe museum acquired a Tornado in 2022 and a Hornet in 2023.\nGallery\nDisplays\nThe following exhibits are on static display in the museum:\nAircraft\n*AerMacchi MB-326H\n*Auster J-5 Adventurer\n*Avro Anson\n*Avro Lancaster B VII NX622\n*Bell UH-1H Iroquois\n*Bensen gyrocopter\n*CAC Wackett\n*CAC Wirraway\n*Consolidated PBY Catalina\n*De Havilland DH-82 Tiger Moth\n*De Havilland DH-94 Moth Minor\n*De Havilland Vampire\n*Douglas Dakota\n*English Electric Canberra, license built by Government Aircraft Factories\n*Gardan GY-80 Horizon (Sugar Bird Lady)\n*General Dynamics F-111C crew module (\"ejectable cockpit\")\n*Link Trainer - early flight simulator\n*McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet A21-101\n*Mignet Pou-du-Ciel (Flying Flea)\n*Panavia Tornado GR4\n*Parasol\n*Percival Proctor Mk.
