Holy Cross swept its conference and won its third Colonial League championship in four years.\nIn their fourth year under head coach Mark Duffner, the Crusaders compiled a 10–1 record. Tim Donovan, Randy Pedro, Chris Maruca and Dave Murphy were the team captains.\nThe Crusaders outscored opponents 396 to 161. Holy Cross' undefeated (4–0) conference record placed first in the five-team Colonial League standings.\nThe Crusaders started the year at No. 8 in the national Division I-AA rankings and reached as high as No. 3. They were ranked No. 4 at season's end but did not participate in the national championship playoffs, as Colonial League rules at the time prohibited postseason play.\nHoly Cross played its home games at Fitton Field on the college campus in Worcester, Massachusetts.\nSchedule\n| September 16 | @ | Lafayette | 8\n| Fisher Field | Easton, PA | W 23 21\n| 10,700 |\n| September 23 | @ | Harvard | 4\n| Harvard Stadium | Boston, MA | W 31 17\n| 17,500 |\n| September 30 |   | Princeton | 4\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | W 46 0\n| 16,442 |\n| October 7 | @ | Dartmouth | 3\n| Memorial Field | Hanover, NH | W 33 7\n| 7,107 |\n| October 14 | @ | Army | 3\n| Michie Stadium | West Point, NY | L 9 45\n| 40,869 |\n| October 21 |   | Colgate^ | 9\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | W 31 6\n| 17,803 |\n| October 28 |   | Brown | 8\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | W 49 13\n| 8,614 |\n| November 4 |    | Northeastern | 6\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | W 46 13\n| 8,335 |\n| November 11 | @ | Lehigh | 6\n| Goodman Stadium | Bethlehem, PA | W 55 16\n| 7,727 |\n| November 18 | @ | Bucknell | 4\n| Christy Mathewson–Memorial Stadium | Lewisburg, PA | W 35 6\n| 4,662 |\n}}\nReferences"
