Municipal elections were held across England and Wales on Monday 2 November, with Scotland holding municipal elections the following day. Municipal elections in Ireland took place later that month, on Wednesday 25 November.\nThe English and Welsh election saw the main parties making inroads into municipal politics, although many contests took place on non-party political lines, with little reference to the candidates party affiliation. Across England and Wales Liberals gained 56 seats, Conservatives 32, Liberal Unionists 1, Independents 5, and Labour 3.\nIn Scotland the newly enlarged Glasgow Corporation saw a group of Progressive candidates, known as the Progressive Union, become the largest force on the council.\nThe Irish elections, particularly in Dublin, saw the ongoing battle between rival factions of Irish nationalists; the Redmondites and supporters of John Dillon and the Irish National Federation.\nResults\nMunicipal elections\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"valign:top\"\n!
