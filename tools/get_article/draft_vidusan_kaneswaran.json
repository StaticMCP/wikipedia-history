Vidusan has performed internationally alongside his co-artist Supaveen, including opening for Yuvan Shankar Raja's concerts in Canada and Singapore. Within Canada’s growing South Asian independent music scene, Vidusan stands out for his self-produced, self-engineered approach.\nEarly life\nVidusan began his musical journey at the age of five, studying Carnatic music through both singing and playing the violin. Over time, that classical foundation sparked a deeper curiosity about sound engineering and compositions, which led him to start experimenting with music production, teaching himself how to write, produce, and engineer his own work.\nVidusan’s artistic development was not only shaped by his classical foundation but also through his creative partnership with Supaveen, a fellow Toronto-based Tamil musician. Supaveen, who began performing in Tamil music shows from a young age and went on to win first place in the Indian televised competition \"Sun Singer\" on Sun TV, who brought valuable performance experience and song writing insight to their collaboration. Working alongside Supaveen who encouraged Vidusan to expand his own artistic perspective, to expand his understanding of vocal composition. Although both come from a background in Tamil classical music, Vidusan drew inspiration from Supaveen while developing his own contemporary style.\nCareer\nVidusan Kaneswaran and Supaveen gained international recognition amongst the Tamil diaspora with their debut single “Serithaana,” which was released on 21 January 2022. The song’s success was followed by “Mayilu,” which helped establish their reputation beyond a one-hit wonder. Both hit songs \"Serithaana\" and \"Mayilu\" consecutively garnered millions of streams on Spotify.\nMusical style\nHis music is known for melodic structures and lyrical choices that often draws from Tamil poetic imagery, while his style leans towards contemporary R&B. Vidusan’s music reflects the evolving aesthetic of the Tamil diaspora, a production style that celebrates Tamil heritage whilst embracing the cosmopolitan identity of young Tamils abroad.\nDiscography\nSingles\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Year\n! scope=\"col\" |Title\n!Producer\n!Co-Artist\n!Language\n!\n|-\n|2019\n|\"Parkaamale\"\n|Vidusan Kaneswaran\n|Dharrini Santhabavan\n|Tamil\n|\n|-\n|2022\n|\"Everything's Gonna Be Alright\"\n|Nikhil Anupam Sharma\n|Hi-Polar\n|English\n|\n|-\n|2022\n|\"A Little Bit of Coffee\"\n|Hi-Polar & Vikasso\n|Hi-Polar\n|English\n|\n|-\n|2022\n|\"Ithuvum Kadanthu Pogum\"\n|Hi-Polar\n|N/A\n|Tamil\n|\n|-\n|2022\n|\"Nilla Mazhaiye\"\n|Vidusan Kaneswaran\n|Dharrini Santhabavan\n|Tamil\n|\n|-\n|2022\n| scope=\"row\" |\"Serithaana\"\n| Vidusan Kaneswaran\n| Supaveen Bavananthan\n|Tamil\n|\n|-\n|2022\n|\"Mayilu\"\n|Vidusan Kaneswaran, Supaveen Bavananthan\n|Supaveen Bavananthan\n|Tamil\n|\n|-\n|2023\n|\"Ninaivilae\"\n|Vidusan Kaneswaran, Supaveen, Seyon\n|Supaveen Bavananthan\n|Tamil\n|\n|-\n|2023\n|\"Chickana\"\n|BSP, Supaveen Bavananthan & Vidusan Kaneswaran\n|Supaveen Bavananthan & Gana Bala\n|Tamil\n|\n|-\n|2023\n|\"Poova Vaa\"\n|BSP, Vidusan Kaneswaran, Supaveen Bavananthan, Jermiah Joseph, Seyon\n|Vidusan Kaneswaran, Supaveen Bavananthan\n|Tamil\n|\n|-\n|2024\n|\"Mynaa\"\n|Vidusan Kaneswaran, Jet & BSP\n|Supaveen Bavananthan\n|Tamil\n|\n|-\n|2024\n|\"Kanne Kanne\"\n|Vidusan Kaneswaran\n|Dharrini Santhabavan\n|Tamil\n|\n|-\n|2025\n|\"Kollaathey\"\n|Vidusan Kaneswaran and Aravinth Vijayakumar\n|Dharrini Santhabavan\n|Tamil\n|\n|}\nReferences"
