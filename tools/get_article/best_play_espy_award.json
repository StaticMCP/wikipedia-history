      "text": "# Best Play ESPY Award\n\nThe Best Play ESPY Award has been conferred annually since 2002 on the play in a single regular season or playoff game contested professionally under the auspices of one of the four major leagues in the United States and Canada or collegiately under the auspices of the National Collegiate Athletic Association adjudged to be the most outstanding or best.\nBetween 2002 and 2004, the award voting panel comprised variously fans; sportswriters and broadcasters, sports executives, and retired sportspersons, termed collectively experts; and ESPN personalities, but balloting thereafter has been exclusively by fans over the Internet from amongst choices selected by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee.  The ESPY Awards ceremony is conducted in July and awards conferred reflect performance and achievement over the twelve months previous to presentation. In the last few years, the format has been: sixteen plays are placed in brackets (1 vs. 16, 2 vs. 15, etc.) The winners in voting then advance to the second round. The winners go to the finals, where voters select Best Play. Since 2022, there has been no elimination format.\nList of winners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-style=\"white-space: nowrap;\n!style=\"background-color:#4F81BD\" | Year\n!Game or event\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Competing teams\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Date\n!Venue\n!League or governing body\n!Sport\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Play\n|-\n|2002\n|Game three of the 2001 American League Division Series\n|New York Yankees\n----\nOakland Athletics\n|October 13, 2001\n|Network Associates Coliseum (Oakland, California)\n|Major League Baseball\n|Baseball\n|Assist by Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter to catcher Jorge Posada in the game's seventh inning (known thereafter as The Flip)\n|-\n|2003\n|2002 regular season Division I-A game\n|LSU Tigers\n----\nKentucky Wildcats\n|November 9, 2002\n|Commonwealth Stadium (Lexington, Kentucky)\n|National Collegiate Athletic Association\n|American football\n|Seventy-four-yard Hail Mary touchdown pass from Tigers quarterback Marcus Randall to wide receiver Devery Henderson upon the expiration of regulation time for a Tigers win (known thereafter as the Bluegrass Miracle).\n|-\n|2004\n|2003 regular season game\n|New Orleans Saints\n----\nJacksonville Jaguars\n|December 21, 2003\n|Alltel Stadium (Jacksonville, Florida)\n|National Football League\n|American football\n|Forty-two-yard forward pass from Saints quarterback Aaron Brooks to wide receiver Donte' Stallworth and laterals from Stallworth to wide receiver Michael Lewis to running back Deuce McAllister to wide receiver Jerome Pathon totaling thirty-three yards for a touchdown to draw the Saints within one point of the Jaguars upon the expiration of regulation time (known thereafter as the River City Relay).\n|-\n|2005\n|Class 4A state championship game\n|Eastview High School Lightning\n----\nHopkins High School Royals\n|March 20, 2005\n|Target Center (Minneapolis, Minnesota)\n|Minnesota State High School League\n|Basketball\n|Eighteen-foot two-point field goal by Royals shooting guard Blake Hoffarber while sitting down upon the expiration of a first overtime to draw the Royals equal with the Lightning and to force a second overtime.\n|-\n|2006\n|2005 regular season Division I-A game\n|Southern Miss Golden Eagles\n----\nAlabama Crimson Tide\n|September 10, 2005\n|Bryant–Denny Stadium (Tuscaloosa, Alabama)\n|National Collegiate Athletic Association\n|American football\n|Fourth-down reception by Crimson Tide wide receiver Tyrone Prothro of a 42-yard pass from quarterback Brodie Croyle over Golden Eagles cornerback Jasper Faulk, with Prothro catching the ball behind Faulk's back.\n|-\n|2007\n|2007 Fiesta Bowl\n|Boise State Broncos\n----\nOklahoma Sooners\n|January 1, 2007\n|University of Phoenix Stadium (Glendale, Arizona)\n|National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I FBS\n|American football\n|Three-yard rush by Broncos running back Ian Johnson for a two-point conversion on a variant of the Statue of Liberty play executed from a play-action fake undertaken by quarterback Jared Zabransky for a Broncos overtime win.\n|-\n|2008\n|Super Bowl XLII\n|New York Giants\n----\nNew England Patriots\n|February 3, 2008\n|University of Phoenix Stadium (Glendale, Arizona)\n|National Football League\n|American football\n|Thirty-two-yard reception over Patriots strong safety Rodney Harrison by reserve wide receiver David Tyree of a third-down pass completed by Giants quarterback Eli Manning whilst under threat of sack from Patriots defensive ends Richard Seymour and Jarvis Green and outside linebacker Adalius Thomas, undertaken from the Giants' forty-four-yard line with one minute, fifteen seconds to play in the fourth quarter and the team trailing 14-10 (The Helmet Catch).\n|-\n|2009\n|Super Bowl XLIII\n|Pittsburgh Steelers\n----\nArizona Cardinals\n|February 1, 2009\n|Raymond James Stadium (Tampa, Florida)\n|National Football League\n|American football\n|Six-yard reception by Steelers wide receiver Santonio Holmes from quarterback Ben Roethlisberger with 35 seconds left giving the Steelers a 27-23 lead over the Cardinals.\n|-\n|2010\n|2009 regular season game\n|Minnesota Vikings\n----\nSan Francisco 49ers\n|September 27, 2009\n|Hubert H.
