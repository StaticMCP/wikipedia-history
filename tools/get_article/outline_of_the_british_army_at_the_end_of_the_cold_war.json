The most authoritative source for this type of information available is Ministry of Defence (Army Department), Master Order of Battle, (ASD 6500-25 Ministry of Defence, 1991) and United Kingdom Land Forces, HQ UKLF, UKLF ORBAT Review Action Plan, HQ UKLF, 1990.\nAt the top of the Army organisation is the Army Board of the Defence Council. The executive committee of the Army Board was responsible for the 'detailed management of the Army.' It included the four military members of the Army Board, including the Chief of the General Staff, General Sir John Chapple in 1989, the Second Permanent Under Secretary, and the Assistant Chief of the General Staff, a major general. The Army Department consisted of four components: the General Staff, the Adjutant General's department, which dealt with recruiting, and also had the Provost Marshal (Army), a brigadier, reporting to him, though the RMP headquarters was at Roussillon Barracks, Chichester; the Military Secretary's department, and the Quartermaster General's department.\nUnited Kingdom Land Forces\nCommander-in-Chief, UK Land Forces, General Sir Charles Huxtable\nHQ: Wilton\nHQ United Kingdom Land Forces commanded nine military districts until the spring of 1991. These districts controlled the regular army brigades in the UK (inc 1st and 5th Brigades) and the predominantly TA regional brigades. In 1984–85, the nine districts were Eastern (19th and 54th Brigades), London, North-East (2nd Infantry Division, 15, 24, and 49 Brigades), North-West District (42 Brigade), Scotland (51 and 52 Brigades), South-Eastern District (2 and 5 Brigades), South-West District (UK Contingent, ACE Mobile Force, 1, and 43 Brigades) Headquarters Wales (160 Brigade), and Western District (143 Brigade).\nIn December 1989, Headquarters UK Land Forces at Wilton directed field forces through a three-star's command, Commander UK Field Army, Lieutenant General Sir David Ramsbotham. Many of the units stationed in the United Kingdom were to move immediately to Germany to reinforce British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) in case of war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. For administrative purposes these units were under command of brigade HQ based in the UK during peacetime. Such reinforcement units are indicated in the list below in italics followed by the higher command they were to reinforce in Germany in brackets.\n* British Gurkhas Nepal\nScotland\n*Army Headquarters

During 1988 the disposition of brigades in Northern Ireland changed: On 1 July 1988 3rd Infantry Brigade reformed at Armagh and became responsible for the UK-Ireland border zone from Armagh to South Londonderry. The brigade had been disbanded in September 1981 with its units and area initially having been taken over by 8th Infantry Brigade. On 2 November 1988 107th (Ulster) Brigade (V) was raised and took command of all Territorial Army units in Northern Ireland, thus freeing 8th Infantry Brigade and 39th Infantry Brigade to focus on counterinsurgency operations. This structure was in force until the 1992 amalgamation of Royal Irish Rangers and Ulster Defence Regiment, after which 3rd Infantry Brigade returned to control its traditional area of County Armagh and County Down.\n* Headquarters Northern Ireland, Thiepval Barracks, Lisburn\n** HQ Northern Ireland District & 233 (Northern Ireland) Signal Squadron, Royal Signals, Lisburn\n**102nd (Ulster) Air Defence Regiment, Royal Artillery (V), in Newtownards (32 x Blowpipe surface-to-air missile launchers) [to Air Defence Group, 1st Artillery Brigade]\n** 22 Postal and Courier Squadron, Royal Engineers\n** 21st Transport and Movements Regiment, Royal Corps of Transport, at Moscow Camp, Belfast – formed in 1988\n*** Royal Army Ordnance Corps Ordnance Depot, Northern Ireland\n** 152nd (Ulster) Ambulance Regiment, Royal Corps of Transport (V), in Belfast [to Commander Transport, I (British) Corps]\n** 204th (North Irish) General Hospital, Royal Army Medical Corps (V), in Belfast [800 x beds] [to Commander Medical, 1st British Corps]\n** 253rd (Northern Ireland) Field Ambulance, Royal Army Medical Corps (V), in Belfast [to Commander Medical, RCZ]\n** 254 Provost Company, Royal Military Police (V), in Belfast [to Provost Marshal, BAOR]\n** 3rd Infantry Brigade, at Drumadd Barracks, Armagh – HQ reformed in 1988\n***203 Signal Squadron, Royal Corps of Signals, at Drummad Barracks, Armagh\n***1st Battalion, Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters, at Lisanelly Barracks, Omagh (Mechanised Infantry (Wheeled), 43 x Saracen APCs and 8 x Fox Armoured Cars)\n****Band of the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters (Small Infantry Band)\n***2nd (County Armagh) Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment, at Drumadd Barracks, Armagh\n***3rd (County Down) Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment, in Ballykinler\n***4th (County Fermanagh) Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment, at Grosvenor Barracks, Enniskillen\n** 8th Infantry Brigade, at Ebrington Barracks, Derry (covering County Londonderry, County Tyrone, and Ballymena, Ballymoney, Moyle and Northern Larne)\n*** 208 Signal Squadron, Royal Corps of Signals, at Ebrington Barracks, Derry\n*** Royal Hampshire Regiment, at Ebrington Barracks, Derry (Mechanised Infantry (Wheeled), 43 x Saracen APCs and 8 x Fox Armoured Cars) – from March\n**** 570 Signal Troop, Royal Corps of Signals\n**** Band of the Royal Hampshire Regiment (Small Infantry Band)\n*** Gloucestershire Regiment, at Shackleton Barracks, Ballykelly (Light Infantry, 15 x 4 ton Bedford trucks, 61 x B-class vehicles 8 x 81&nbsp;mm Mortars and 6 x Milan Anti-Tank)\n**** 571 Signal Troop, Royal Corps of Signals\n**** Band of the Gloucestershire Regiment (Small Infantry Band)\n*** 1st/9th (County Antrim) Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment, at Steeple Barracks, Antrim\n*** 5th (County Londonderry) Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment, at Shackleton Barracks, Ballykelly\n*** 6th (County Tyrone) Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment, at Saint Lucia Barracks, Omagh\n*** 8th (County Tyrone) Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment, in Dungannon\n*** 176 Provost Company, Royal Military Police, at Ebrington Barracks, Derry [to Provost Marshal, BAOR]\n** 39th Infantry Brigade, Lisburn, (covering Belfast city, and County Armagh, County Down and County Antrim (excluding Ballymena, Ballymoney, Moyle and Northern Larne))\n*** 213 Signal Squadron, Royal Corps of Signals, at Thiepval Barracks, Lisburn\n*** 3rd Battalion, The Queen's Regiment, at Alexander Barracks, Aldergrove (Mechanised Infantry (Wheeled), 43 x Saracen APCs and 8 x Fox Armoured Cars)\n**** 569 Signal Troop, Royal Corps of Signals\n*** The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment), at Abercorn Barracks, Ballykinler (Resident Battalion) (Light Infantry, 15 x 4 ton Bedford trucks, 61 x B-class vehicles 8 x 81&nbsp;mm Mortars and 6 x Milan Anti-Tank) – arrived in July from Berlin\n**** 572 Signal Troop, Royal Corps of Signals\n**** Band of the Black Watch (Small Infantry Band)\n*** 3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment, at Palace Barracks, Belfast (Parachute Infantry) [to 5th Airborne Brigade]\n*** 4th (Volunteer) Battalion (North Irish Militia), Royal Irish Rangers (V), in Portadown (Light Infantry) [TTW to 1st Garrison Area, Milan Platoon to 2nd Infantry Division]\n*** 5th (Volunteer) Battalion, Royal Irish Rangers (V), in Armagh (Light Infantry) [TTW to 4th Garrison Area, Milan Platoon to 2nd Infantry Division]\n*** 7th/10th (City of Belfast) Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment, at Malone Barracks, Belfast\n*** 11th (Craigavon) Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment, at Mahon Barracks, Portadown\n*** 33 Independent Field Squadron, Royal Engineers, at Massereene Barracks, Antrim\n*** 175 Provost Company, Royal Military Police, at Thiepval Barracks, Lisburn [to Provost Marshal, BAOR]\n** 107th (Ulster) Brigade (V), at Thiepval Barracks, Lisburn – 107th (Ulster) Brigade was formed in 1988 as an administrative HQ to coordinate the TA units in Northern Ireland.

Headquartered at JHQ Rheindahlen in West Germany and commanded by a General it consisted in peacetime of British I Corps and support troops. In the event of war with the Warsaw Pact the Commander-in-Chief of BAOR would have assumed command of NATO's Northern Army Group (NORTHAG), which was tasked with defending Northern Germany up to the river Elbe. BAOR was armed with tactical nuclear weapons and supported by Royal Air Force Germany.\nDuring transition to war, the support units of BAOR would have formed the British Rear Combat Zone headquartered in Düsseldorf, which would have supplied the fighting forces and guarded the lines of communication within West Germany. Further West in Belgium was the British Communications Zone, which was headquartered in Emblem, outside Antwerp and tasked with receiving reinforcements and supplies from Great Britain and to co-ordinate their onward movement to 1 (BR) Corps.\nOn 27 November 1989 Peter Inge became the commander of NATO's Northern Army Group and Commander-in-Chief, British Army of the Rhine in Germany with the local rank of general; he succeeded General Brian Kenny.\n* British Army of the Rhine, JHQ Rheindahlen, Federal Republic of Germany\n**No. 12 Flight AAC, RAF Wildenrath, (Gazelle AH.1)\n**
