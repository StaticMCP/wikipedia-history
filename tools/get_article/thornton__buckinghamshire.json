The Domesday Book of 1086 records the village as Ternitone.\nIt was formerly thought that the \"lost\" Domesday manor of Hasley formed part of Thornton but it is now established that it was part of Radclive.\nChurch\nThe earliest record of the Church of England Church of Saint Michael and All Angels dates from 1219. The present building is 14th-century, but was dramatically restored between 1770 and 1800 and largely rebuilt by the Gothic Revival architect John Tarring in 1850. The restorers retained mediaeval features including the 14th-century belltower, chancel arch and clerestory and 15th century clerestory windows.\nThornton Hall\nThe Tudor Revival Thornton Hall (now Thornton College) was also built to John Tarring's designs in 1850. It incorporates parts of a medieval house modernised in the 18th century. The manor was home to Richard Cavendish.\nThornton College\nThornton College, an independent day and boarding school for girls, occupies the former Manor House Thornton Hall. The school educates girls aged 4 – 18 and has a nursery for boys and girls aged 2½ to 4. The Sisters of Jesus and Mary (a Catholic religious order) purchased the site in 1917. Recent developments include the opening of a Science and Prep Classroom wing (AVDC Outstanding Design Award) in 2010, and a new Sixth Form department in 2016. The school now has over 400 pupils.\nReferences\nSources\n*, available [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=62576 online]\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://ukga.org/england/Buckinghamshire/towns/Thornton.html Thornton, Buckinghamshire] at UK Genealogy Archive\n* [http://www.thorntoncollege.com Thorton College] boarding school official website\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051201025546/http://www.mkheritage.co.uk/wdahs/Thornton/ Thornton Parish and College] at Wolverton & District Archaeological & Historical Society"
