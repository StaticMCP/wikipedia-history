The production delves into multiple historical figures who may have contributed to Arthurian legend as early as the third century and as late as the 9th. It cites as its primary source of the legend the writings of Sir Thomas Malory.  Other writings and sources, many used by Malory, are cited for their specific contributions to the legend.\nReferences"
