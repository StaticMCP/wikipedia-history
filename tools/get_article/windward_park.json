For many years the club played at Codrington College, before moving to Windward Park. The ground first played host to representative cricket when Barbados played a touring South Africa A side in a first-class match in 2000. Between 2000 and 2014, the ground played host to six first-class matches, all featuring Barbados with the exception of the 2014 fixture, which saw the Sagicor High Performance Centre play a touring Bangladesh A team. Seventeen List A one-day matches have also been played at the ground between 2004 and 2018, the vast majority of which were in the Regional Super50; West Indies A played two one-day matches there in 2005 against a touring England A team. Windward Park also played host to women's cricket, with two Women's One Day Internationals being played there between West Indies women and Sri Lanka women in April 2012.\nRecords\nFirst-class\n*Highest team total: 495 for 8 by Barbados v Guyana, 2008–09\n*Lowest team total: 116 all out by Barbados v Jamaica, 2004–05\n*Highest individual innings: 164 by Kraigg Brathwaite for Sagicor High Performance Centre v Bangladesh A, 2014\n*Best bowling in an innings: 6-46 by Jason Bennett for Barbados v Jamaica, 2004–05\n*Best bowling in a match: 10-82 by Jason Bennett, as above\nList A\n*Highest team total: 291 for 5 (50 overs) by Guyana v Leeward Islands, 2005–06\n*Lowest team total: 71 all out (32.2 overs) by Combined Campuses and Colleges v Barbados, 2005–06\n*Highest individual innings: 113 by Ramnaresh Sarwan for Guyana v Leeward Islands, 2005–06\n*Best bowling in an innings: 6-28 by Andre Russell for Sagicor High Performance Centre v Bangladesh A, 2014\nSee also\n*List of cricket grounds in the West Indies\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/ground/59514 Westward Park] at ESPNcricinfo"
