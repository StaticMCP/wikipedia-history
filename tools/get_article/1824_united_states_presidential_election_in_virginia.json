Voters chose 24 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nDuring this election, the Democratic-Republican Party was the only major national party, and 4 candidates from this party sought the Presidency. Virginia voted for William H. Crawford over John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, and Henry Clay. Crawford won Virginia by a margin of 33.44%. This was the first presidential election that four candidates each won at least one county in the same state. This feat would be shared by Illinois in the same election; however, the only other occurrences in presidential election history have been in 1860 (in Missouri), and in 1912 (in North Dakota and in Kansas).\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1824 United States presidential election in Virginia\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#008000; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic-Republican\n| William H.
