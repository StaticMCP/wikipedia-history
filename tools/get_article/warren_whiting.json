He worked on his father's farm until age 21, when he went out on his own, working as a farm-hand for hire.\nAt age 26, he began preaching as a minister of the Free Will Baptist church.  He preached for thirty-five years until his health prevented him from carrying on that work.\nAt age 30, Whiting left New York and moved to the Wisconsin Territory, where three of his brothers&mdash;Anderson, Joseph, and Ellis&mdash;had already become established.  He stopped first in Rock County, Wisconsin, where his brother Joseph owned a farm, then went north to Fond du Lac County, where his brother Ellis had settled.  He purchased a farm in the town of Waupun in 1846, which he expanded to 600 acres during his life.\nPolitical career\nWarren Whiting began as a member of the Whig Party, and became a staunch Republican when that party was established in the 1850s.

His first wife was Lorinda Keith, of Madison County, New York; they wed on September 5, 1839, and were married for 45 years before her death in 1884.  15 months later, he married the widow Ellen C.
