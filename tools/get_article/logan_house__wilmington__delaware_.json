It was built in 1865, and is a three-story, five bay by five bay, flat roofed brick building with Italianate elements.  It has three one-story wings; one original brick wing, a wing added about 1910, and a concrete block wing added about 1960.  Also on the property is a contributing brick carriage house.  The hotel was named for American Civil War General John A. Logan.  It has been owned by the Kelly family since 1889 and has been a traditional gathering place on St. Patrick's Day. In the 1930s, the hotel closed and only a restaurant and tavern remained in operation.\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.loganhouse.com/ Kelly's Logan House website]"
