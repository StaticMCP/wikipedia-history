At the court's creation, 10 judges were appointed from the House of Lords, and one was appointed directly to it. The remaining initial vacancy was filled by Lord Dyson six months later.\nList of judges of the Supreme Court\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" |Judge of the Supreme Court\n! Served from\n!
