Created in 2007, the ward elects four councillors using the single transferable vote electoral system and covers an area with a population of 14,705 people.\nThe area has produced strong results for Labour who have half the seats at each election since the ward's creation.\nBoundaries\nThe ward was created by the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland following the Fourth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2007 Scottish local elections. As a result of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, local elections in Scotland would use the single transferable vote electoral system from 2007 onwards so Abbey was formed from an amalgamation of several previous first-past-the-post wards. It contained all of the former Lincluden, Lochside and Palmerston wards and the majority of the former Maxwelltown as well as part of the former Criffel ward. North West Dumfries takes in the north and west of the town of Dumfries – everything west of the River Nith and north of Park Road/Rotchell Road – in the east of the council area. It includes the neighbourhoods of Lincluden, Lochside, Lochfield, Summerville, Laurieknowe and Suffolk Hill as well as the village of Newbridge to the north of the town. The ward's boundaries were unchanged following the Fifth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements conducted by the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland ahead of the 2017 Scottish local elections.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \"|\n|rowspan=3|Ronnie Nicholson(Labour)\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \"|\n|rowspan=4|John Graham Bell(Conservative)\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \"|\n|rowspan=3|David John McKie(Labour)\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \"|\n|rowspan=1|Doug Snell(SNP)\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=3|Andy Ferguson(SNP)\n|-\n!2017\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1|Paula Stevenson(Labour)\n|rowspan=1|Emma Jordan(Labour)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2017 election\n2017 Dumfries and Galloway Council election\n2012 election\n2012 Dumfries and Galloway Council election\n2007 election\n2007 Dumfries and Galloway Council election\nReferences"
