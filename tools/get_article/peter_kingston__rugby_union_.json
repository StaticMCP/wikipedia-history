He joined Gloucester in 1974 and soon earned his first England call up, for the 1975 tour of Australia, where he started in both Tests. The tour was a disappointment for England and Kingston was one of the players discarded, only to return for three matches in the 1979 Five Nations Championship.\nKingston continued to play with Gloucester into the mid-1980s and won two County Championship titles representing Gloucestershire. He had a stint with Welsh club Pontypool in 1984.\nFor 33 years, Kingston was a PE, history and sports teacher at Pate's Grammar School. He retired in 2009.\nSee also\n*List of England national rugby union players\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
