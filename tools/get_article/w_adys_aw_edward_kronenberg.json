He had five siblings: Stanisław Leopold, Leopold Julian, Tekla Julia, Marię Różę, and Różę Marię Karolinę.

After returning to Poland, he became a member of the Warsaw-Tiraspol and Vistula railroads. He was the founder and publisher of the Warsaw Technical Review .\nIn 1883 in a village near Częstochowa he began the construction of a textile factory, which was soon after sold to the Austrian company Hielle and Ditrich, due to lack of profitability of the project. Finally, the factory under the name \"Błeszno\" was launched in 1885 and before the First World War was one of the biggest factories in the Kingdom of Poland.\nAfter the failure in the construction of factories near Czestochowa, he abandoned industrial activity and settled in Paris, where he became a composer. He worked mostly on patriotic songs. In 1881, he founded the Warsaw Music Society and was its president until 1885.\nHe was married to Marguerite Lucie Chevreau (1859-1953), with whom he had a daughter Marię Władysławę (1882-1914), the wife of Joseph Raymond Anne Marie, Count de Maistre (1879-1955).\nHe died at Cannes and was buried in the cemetery of the Evangelical Reformed in Warsaw.
