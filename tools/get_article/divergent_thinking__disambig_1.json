It typically occurs in a spontaneous, free-flowing, \"non-linear\" manner, such that many ideas are generated in an emergent cognitive fashion. Many possible solutions are explored in a short amount of time, and unexpected connections are drawn. Divergent thinking is often contrasted with convergent thinking. Convergent thinking is the opposite of divergent thinking as it organizes and structures ideas and information, which follows a particular set of logical steps to arrive at one solution, which in some cases is a \"correct\" solution.\nThe psychologist J. P. Guilford first coined the terms convergent thinking and divergent thinking in 1956.\nActivities\nActivities which promote divergent thinking include creating lists of questions, setting aside time for thinking and meditation, brainstorming, subject mapping, bubble mapping, keeping a journal, playing tabletop role-playing games, creating artwork, and free writing. In free writing, a person will focus on one particular topic and write non-stop about it for a short period of time, in a stream of consciousness fashion.\nDivergent vs convergent thinking\nConvergent thinking is the process of finding one solution. Divergent thinking involves more creativity, and is typically regarded as spontaneous. In other words, convergent thinking involves more logical thinking with the aim of finding the most efficient solution. Divergent thinking is more useful for brainstorming to explore multiple potential solutions, with less focus on immediate practicality.\nBenefits of convergent thinking:\n* No room for vagueness or uncertainty\n* Organization and structure\n* Quick resolutions\nBenefits of divergent thinking:\n* New opportunities\n* Allows for creativity to flow\n* Multiple perspectives\nPlayfulness\nParallels have been drawn between playfulness in kindergarten-aged children and divergent thinking.  In a study documented by Lieberman, the relationship between these two traits was examined, with playfulness being \"conceptualized and operationally defined in terms of five traits: physical, social and cognitive spontaneity; manifest joy; and sense of humour\". The author noted that during the study, while observing the children's behaviour at play, they \"noted individual differences in spontaneity, overtones of joy, and sense of humour that imply a relationship between the foregoing qualities and some of the factors found in the intellectual structure of creative adults and adolescents\".\nDivergent thinking and mental health\nCertain divergent thinking patterns have been associated with mental health disorders, while divergent thinking as a practice may have therapeutic benefits.\nDivergent thinking and psychopathology\nDivergent thinking can be counterproductive when used excessively. Extreme divergent thinkers end up in loops of endless possibilities without making a decision. Schizophrenia is a variation of extreme divergent thinking, exhibiting actions and thoughts not yielding creativity. Some well-known artists and writers display extreme thinking traits including impulsive nonconformity and over-inclusive thinking.\nTherapeutic value of divergent thinking\nThe ability to use divergent thinking is said to increase the mental status of young adults according to Bennliure and Moral. Mental health can have major impacts on people's lives. It can be beneficial to some people to learn more about divergent thinking and how it can help with coping mechanisms. Bennliure and Moral state that people with low divergent thinking can get overwhelmed by thinking of the same \"repetitive\" answer or thought process, leading to feelings of anxiety or depression. On the other hand, being able to create multiple ideas, answers, or plans of action for a certain stressor can create less \"thoughts of helplessness, catastrophism, and hopelessness.\" For this reason, being able to use divergent thinking can be beneficial in lessening anxiety and depression symptoms by \"having a more active and open approach\" to problems or stressors.\nDeductive reasoning\nDivergent thinking not only encourages playfulness but reasoning skills as well. Pier-Luc Chantal, Emilie Gagnon-St-Pierre, and Henry Markovits of Université du Quebec à Montréal conducted a study on preschool-aged children in which the relationship between divergent thinking and deductive reasoning were observed. They found that incorporating components of divergent thinking into learning, such as generating unique ideas, \"might be a powerful tool to improve reasoning.\" This approach stresses the idea that \"deductive reasoning is not only about getting the 'right' answer but requires going beyond the most obvious ideas in order to generate even very unlikely possibilities.\"\nDivergent thinking and aging\nGuila Fusi, Sara Lavolpe, Nara Crepaldi, and Maria Lusia Rusconi conducted a systematic review on the effect of age on divergent thinking. They found that the relationship between age and DT abilities is not at all linear, but \"complex and multidimensional.\" Many variables can influence DT abilities, including \"educational level, intelligence, WM (working memory) abilities, and speed of processing.\" Before any further research should be done, the authors first believe that a theoretical discussion needs to be held. Of course, \"new and more accurate information about which of the DT abilities might be preserved or impaired in the elderly population could have significant practical implications.\"\nEffects of positive and negative mood\nIn a study at the University of Bergen, Norway, the effects of positive and negative mood on divergent thinking were examined.   Nearly two hundred art and psychology students participated, first by measuring their moods with an adjective checklist before performing the required tasks.  The results showed a clear distinction in performance between those with a self-reported positive versus negative mood:\nA series of related studies suggested a link between positive mood and the promotion of cognitive flexibility.  In a 1990 study by Murray, Sujan, Hirt and Sujan, this hypothesis was examined more closely and \"found positive mood participants were able to see relations between concepts”, as well as demonstrating advanced abilities \"in distinguishing the differences between concepts\".  This group of researchers drew a parallel between \"their findings and creative problem solving by arguing that participants in a positive mood are better able both to differentiate between and to integrate unusual and diverse information\".  This shows that their subjects are at a distinct cognitive advantage when performing divergent thinking-related tasks in an elevated mood. Further research could take this topic one step further to explore effective strategies to improve divergent thinking when in a negative mood, for example how to move beyond \"optimizing strategies\" into \"satisficing strategies\" rather than focus on \"the quality of their ideas\", in order to generate more ideas and creative solutions.\nEffects of sleep deprivation\nWhile little research has been conducted on the impact of sleep deprivation on divergent thinking, one study by J. A. Horne illustrated that even when motivation to perform well is maintained, sleep can still impact divergent thinking performance.  In this study, twelve subjects were deprived of sleep for thirty-two hours, while a control group of twelve others maintained normal sleep routine. Subjects' performance on both a word fluency task and a challenging nonverbal planning test was \"significantly impaired by sleep loss\", even when the factor of personal motivation to perform well was controlled. This study showed that even \"one night of sleep loss can affect divergent thinking”, which \"contrasts with the outcome for convergent thinking tasks, which are more resilient to short-term sleep loss\".\nDemographic correlation\nIt has been described that in Black communities there is a higher likelihood for autistic individuals to mask their condition. Hence, many autistic adults and children are dismissed, and there is an issue with underdiagnosis. This results in higher bias against divergent individuals of the black community. About 33% of black students with disabilities spend 80% of the time in a classroom, compared to disabled white students, about 60% spend about 80% in the classroom. This can be attributed to black disabled students being deemed as a disturbance or intellectually inept. This is also exemplified by the statistic that white children are twice as likely to receive an ADHD diagnosis. Black children are more likely to be stigmatized and often do not receive the care and support needed to be successful in school or the work force, according to Fast Company.\nDivergent thinking in music\nMusic itself is a source of creativity, that enhances cognition, learning, and memory. A study was done where participants listened to music and their emotions were then measured as well as their creativity. Most people expressed the emotions of calm, happy, sad, or anxious. However, results showed that those who listened to calmer and happier music had significantly higher scores of creativity than those who did not listen to any music. Though, the actual mood changes of participants were not closely analyzed, or whether they enjoyed the music or not there was a positive correlation between positive mood and creativity. Which allowed for the inference that happy music was the reason mood and creativity was boosted.\nDiversity and ethnomusicology\nEthnomusicology is the study of music in various cultures by socializing, investigating, and comparing.\nDivergent thinking is often used by ethnomusicologist to express an array of musical tradition. Various cultures carry unique sounds and patterns. New works are made when blending different sounds and patterns to highlight musical styles. Ethnomusicologists often go out and study and observe in different environments to convey different music phenoms. With incorporating divergent thinking into musical classrooms we can allow students to broaden their perspectives and create more cultural expressions.\nDiversity thinking and habits of the mind\nOne can become a more innovative thinker when following habits of the mind. By staying persistent one can focus on the tasks at hand. Divergent thinking also allows for keeping an open mind and learn new things. New learning can be applied to past or future problems. Divergent thinking also enhances imagination, striving for more originality, and pushes others to do the same. The more originality, the more ideas can be expressed in group settings.\nDivergent thinking modeling\nBoth convergent and divergent processing have been subject to modeling. The first process has been modeled by emulating responses to the Remote Associates Test (RAT) by Olteţeanu and Falomir (2015) and Klein and Badia (2015). The RAT was modeled by both research teams as a proof-of-concept to investigate how remote associative concepts relate to statistically based Natural Language Processing techniques and how these connections relate to the convergent and divergent cognitive processes involved in creativity. According to Klein and Badia, distant associates are tracked down and chosen using a strictly lexical-based modeling technique, where both the frequency of co-occurrence and the frequency of each term in the corpus are valued in the convergent and divergent parts of the process.\nOn a more divergent focus, Klein and Badia (2022), and Olteţeanu and Falomir (2016) proposed a divergent thinking emulation by modeling the Alternative Uses Task (AUT). The former researchers proposed a simple co-occurrence based method with and without grammatical labeling to solve this test. The later applied what they named Object Replacement and Object Composition with specific reference to AUT. Other ideas for DT generation, include Veale and Li (2016) template approach, and López-Ortega (2013) who proposed an application of divergent exploration in a multi agent system.\nSee also\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDZFcDGpL4U Changing Education Paradigms] by RSA Animate on YouTube\n* [http://www.edutopia.org/blog/fueling-creativity-through-divergent-thinking-classroom-stacey-goodman Fuel Creativity in the Classroom With Divergent Thinking] on Edutopia\n* [http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/turning-straw-gold/201302/what-type-thinker-are-you What Type of Thinker Are You?] at Psychology Today\n* [https://hbr.org/2023/07/how-generative-ai-can-augment-human-creativity How Generative AI Can Augment Human Creativity: Use it to promote divergent thinking] at Harvard Business Review"
