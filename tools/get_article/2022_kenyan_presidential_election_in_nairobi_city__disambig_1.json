Nairobi City, being both the capital and the largest urban center in Kenya, was a key battleground for presidential candidates. Raila Odinga of the Azimio la Umoja coalition won with 57% of the votes cast defeating William Ruto of the United Democratic Alliance who garnered 41% of the votes cast. Raila Odinga dominated in constituencies such as Kibra, Ruaraka, and Dagoretti North, reflecting strong support in densely populated urban and informal settlement areas. William Ruto performed better in constituencies such as Roysambu, Kasarani, and  Dagoretti South, where peri-urban and mixed-income populations are more significant.\nOverall, Raila Odinga secured a majority of the votes in Nairobi City, contributing significantly to his nationwide performance in the 2022 presidential election. The county’s results highlighted Nairobi as a major urban stronghold for the Azimio la Umoja coalition.\nResults\n}}\nConstituencies\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Rank !!

Its diverse population—including various ethnic groups, business communities, and residents of informal settlements—has made the city a key battleground in national elections. Urban constituencies in Nairobi often lean towards reformist or opposition candidates, reflecting concerns about governance, service delivery, and economic opportunities. Over the decades, Nairobi has played a decisive role in shaping electoral outcomes, particularly in presidential elections.\nIn recent elections, including the 2013, 2017, and 2022 polls, voting patterns in Nairobi have shown a clear urban-rural divide within the city itself. Densely populated constituencies such as Kibra, Ruaraka, and Mathare tend to support candidates aligned with the Azimio la Umoja coalition, while peri-urban areas like Kasarani, Roysambu, and Dagoretti South have historically favored candidates from the non-opposition parties. These patterns reflect Nairobi’s socio-economic diversity, ethnic composition, and evolving political affiliations.\nAftermath\nFollowing William Ruto's victory in the 2022 presidential election, Nairobi City experienced significant political turbulence. The announcement of Ruto as president-elect on August 15, 2022, led to widespread protests across parts of the capital. Areas such as Kibera, Kamukunji, and Mathare, which had strongly supported Raila Odinga, witnessed demonstrations expressing dissatisfaction with the election results. These protests were marked by clashes with security forces, leading to injuries and heightened tensions in the city.\nIn the subsequent months, Nairobi became a focal point for national political discourse. The city's leadership engaged with the new administration to ensure continued development and address urban challenges. However, political divisions persisted, with opposition groups voicing concerns over governance and policy directions. Nairobi's diverse electorate remained actively involved in the evolving political landscape, reflecting the city's pivotal role in Kenya's democratic processes.\nSee also\n* 2022 Kenya general election\n* 2022 Kenyan Presidential Election in Mount Kenya Region\nReferences"
