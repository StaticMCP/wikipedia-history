      "text": "# Jean-Charles Schwartz\n\nJean-Charles Schwartz, born on May 28, 1936, in Paris, is a French neurobiologist, pharmacist and researcher. Husband of Ketty Schwartz, née Gersen (1937–2007) and father of Olivier, Marc and Emmanuelle. He is a member of the Academy of Sciences. He developed pitolisant, the first clinically approved antagonist for H3 receptors.\nBiography\nJean-Charles Schwartz holds a doctorate in pharmacy (Paris, 1960), a doctorate in science (Paris, 1965) and a diploma from the Institut de Pharmacodynamie et Pharmacotechnie (Paris, 1961). He was Professor of Physiology at the Faculties of Pharmacy of the Universities of Haute Normandie and Paris 5-René Descartes (1968–2001) and Professor of Neuropharmacology at the Institut Universitaire de France (1990–2000).\nHe was a pharmacy internist (1958–1963), assistant at the Central Hospital Pharmacy (1964–1968) and then Chief Pharmacist at the Assistance Public-Hôpitaux de Paris (1968–1999).\nHe headed the \"Neurobiology and Pharmacology\" and then \"Neurobiology and Molecular Pharmacology\" units of the Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale (Inserm) from 1972 to 2001. He was vice-chairman of the Board of Directors of Inserm (1999–2002).\nHe co-founded with Dr. Jeanne-Marie Lecomte the pharmaceutical research/development and commercialisation companies Bioprojet (1981), Bioprojet Pharma (1992) and Bioprojet Biotech (2001). He is the Scientific Director of Bioprojet since 2001.\nScientific career\nJean-Charles Schwartz, a specialist in the neurobiology and pharmacology of brain chemical mediators, has discovered and developed new classes of drugs, mainly in neuropsychiatry.\nHe studied the brain functions of histamine and dopamine. He established the role of histamine as a neurotransmitter in brain: he described its metabolic pathways, identified the main histaminergic neuronal pathways,Garbarg M., Barbin G., Feger J. and Schwartz J-C., « An histaminergic pathway in rat brain evidenced by lesions of the medial forebrain bundle », Science, 1974, 186, p. 833-835 identified and located the receptors (H1, H2 and H3) mediating its actions.Baudry M., Martres M.P. and Schwartz J-C., « H1- and H2-receptors in the histamine-induced accumulation of cyclic AMP in guinea-pig cortical slices », Nature, 1975, 253, p. 362-363Arrang J.M., Garbarg M. and Schwartz J-C., « Auto-inhibition of brain histamine release mediated by a novel class (H3) of histamine receptor », Nature, 1983, 302, p. 832-837 His description of the role of histaminergic neurons in vigilance control has contributed to the development of second-generation antihistamines devoid of sedative effects. He discovered the H3 receptor, demonstrated the role of its strong constitutive activity in controlling the activity of cerebral histaminergic neurons,Stark H., Morisset S., Rouleau A., Ligneau X., Gbahou F., Tardivel-Lacombe J., Schunack W., Gavellin G.R., Schwartz J-C. and Arrang J.M., « High constitutive activity of native H3 receptors regulates histamine neurons in brain », Nature, 2000, 408, p. 860-864 developed the first selective ligands of this receptorArrang J.M., Garbarg M., Lancelot J-C., Lecomte J.M., Pollard H., Robba M., Schunack W. and Schwartz J-C., « Highly potent and selective ligands for histamine H3-receptors », Nature, 1987, 327, p. 117-123 and developed pitolisant, (Wakix®), a wake-promoting and anticataplectic agent now currently used for the treatment of patients with narcolepsy.Dauvilliers Y, Bassetti C,  Lammers GJ, Arnulf I, Mayer G, Rodenbeck A,  Lehert P, Ding CL, Lecomte J-M and Schwartz J-C., « Pitolisant versus placebo or modafinil in patients with narcolepsy: a double-blind, randomised trial », Lancet Neurol, 2013; 12, p. 1068–75\nHaving hypothesized the existence of several types of dopamine receptors,Sokoloff P., Martres M.P. and Schwartz J-C., « Dopamine autoreceptors and postsynaptic receptors both labelled by 3H-apomorphine », Nature, 1980, 288, p. 283-286 Jean-Charles Schwartz and his collaborators identified by cloning the two splicing isoforms of the D2Giros B., Sokoloff P., Martres M.P., Riou J.F., Emorine L.J. and Schwartz J-C., « Alternative splicing directs the expression of two D-2 dopamine receptor isoforms », Nature, 1989, 342, p. 923-926 receptor, then the D3Sokoloff P., Giros B., Martres M.P., Bouthenet M.L. and Schwartz J-C., « Molecular cloning and characterisation of a novel dopamine receptor (D3) as a target for neuroleptics », Nature, 1990, 347, p. 146-151 receptor. He developed the first selective ligands of the D3 receptor and used them to demonstrate the involvement of this receptor in drug dependence and the action of antipsychotic drugs.Pilla M., Perachon S., Sautel F. Garrido F., Mann A., Wermuth CG, Schwartz J-C, Everitt B.J., Sokoloff P., «Selective inhibition of cocaine-seeking behaviour by a partial dopamine receptor agonist  », Nature, 1999; 400: (6742), p. 371-375 It has shown the involvement of receptor modulations in changes in the effects of chronically administered psychotropic agents, processes responsible for tolerance and dependence.Schwartz J-C., Martres M.P., Rose C., Quach T.T. and Sokoloff P., Adaptations of neurotransmitter receptor mechanisms in the CNS, in “Chemical Neurotransmission : 75 years” Second Nobel Conference., L.
