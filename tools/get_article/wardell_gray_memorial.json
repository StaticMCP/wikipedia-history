In 1935 he transferred to Cass Technical High School, where he began \"playing with the local bands of Jimmy Rachel and Benny Carew\". From 1943 to 1945, he doubled on tenor saxophone and clarinet for Earl Hines. After a \"short spell\" with Billy Eckstine, he joined Benny Carter's band in 1946, with whom he \"went out to the West Coast and decided to remain for a while.\"\nIn 1948, Wardell moved to New York and started playing with Benny Goodman's Sextet and his big band. During that time, he worked with Tadd Dameron, Count Basie, and Sonny Stitt, which, according to Art Farmer, lead to a significant change in style he kept from Hines' days.\nIn 1950, \"he returned to Detroit and spent several months there with his own quartet\", after which he returned to playing with Count Basie, with whom he stayed before settling in California at the end of 1051.\nCritical reception\n(Volume One)\n| rev2 = The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings\n| rev2score =  (Volume One)\n| rev3 = The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings\n| rev3score =  (Volume Two)\n| rev4 = AllMusic\n| rev4score =  (Volume One)\n| rev5 = AllMusic\n| rev5score =  (Volume Two)\n}}In a contemporaneous review for DownBeat, Nat Hentoff awarded the album four-out-five stars, saying:\nBurt Korall, writing in November, 1955 for Metronome, said:\nThe April 28, 1956 edition of Billboard called Volume Two, \"A convenient collection of some of the better sides by the late tenor man, available up until now only on scattered LP’s and EP’s. The material in this album is was originally recorded in 1950 and 1951. The latter recording date was memorable for the early appearance of trumpet man Art Farmer. His blowing in Farmer’s Market proved to be a springboard to fame. In the same session, Gray cut Jackie, Sweet and Lovely and Lover Man, all available here. The earlier sessions had Sonny Criss and Clark Terry, among others, in attendance, with Dexter Gordon sitting in on Move.\"\nTrack listing\nWardell Gray Memorial, Volume One\nOriginal release\n1992 Original Jazz Classics CD reissue\n* Tracks 1 to 14 recorded New York, November 11, 1949\n* Tracks 15 to 18 recorded Los Angeles, February 20, 1953\n* From liner notes: \"In order to accommodate the ten alternate tracks now included in Volume 1 and to preserve the approximately equal lengths of the two discs, four tracks (\"Grayhound\", \"Blue Gray\", \"Treadin'\" and \"A Sinner Kissed by an Angel\") that were originally part of Volume 1 now appear on Volume 2.\"\nWardell Gray Memorial, Volume Two\nOriginal release\n1992 Original Jazz Classics CD reissue\n* tracks 1–10 recorded in Detroit, April 25, 1950\n* tracks 17–18 recorded live at the Hula Hut Club in Los Angeles, August 27, 1950.\n* tracks 11–16 recorded in Los Angeles, January 21, 1952.\nPersonnel\nMusicians\nNovember 11, 1949\n* Wardell Gray – tenor saxophone\n* Al Haig – piano\n* Tommy Potter – bass\n* Roy Haynes – drums\n** recorded New York\nApril 25, 1950\n* Wardell Gray – tenor saxophone\n* Hampton Hawes – piano\n* John Richardson – bass\n* Art Mardigan – drums\n** recorded in Detroit\nAugust 27, 1950\n* Wardell Gray – tenor saxophone\n* Dexter Gordon – tenor saxophone (\"Move\")\n* Sonny Criss – alto saxophone\n* Clark Terry – trumpet\n* Jimmy Bunn – piano\n* Billy Hadnott – bass\n* Chuck Thompson – drums\n** recorded live at the Hula Hut Club in Los Angeles\nJanuary 21, 1952\n* Wardell Gray – tenor saxophone\n* Art Farmer – trumpet (except \"Sweet and Lovely\")\n* Hampton Hawes – piano\n* Harper Cosby – bass\n* Larry Marable – drums\n* Robert Collier – congas (except \"Sweet and Lovely\" and \"Lover Man\")\n** recorded in Los Angeles\nFebruary 20, 1953: Teddy Charles' West Coasters\n* Frank Morgan – alto saxophone\n* Wardell Gray – tenor saxophone\n* Teddy Charles – vibraphone\n* Sonny Clark – piano\n* Dick Niveson – bass\n** credited as Dick Nivison\n* Larance Marable – drums\n** recorded Los Angeles\nTechnical personnel\n* Ira Gitler – liner notes\n* Ray Avery – photography\n* Joe Tarantino (1992) – digital remastering engineer\nReferences"
