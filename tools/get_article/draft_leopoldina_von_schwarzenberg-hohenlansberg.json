A member of the cadet branch of the House of Reuss, she married into the prominent Schwarzenberg-Hohenlansberg family, whose other branches held considerable influence in Austria-Hungary. Known in her lifetime for her cultural salons in Berlin, and later in Vienna following the First World War, she was a notable figure in imperial court life and the intellectual circles of fin-de-siècle Central Europe.\nEarly Adolescence\nLeopoldina was born on August 8th, 1840, in Saalberg-Ebersdorf. She was the second daughter of Prince Heinrich LXVIII of Reuss-Köstritz and Countess Eleonore of Stolberg-Wernigerode. She led a relatively domestic life, spending her early years within the domesticity of the Schloss Köstritz near Gera. There, she was tutored in languages (achieving fluency in French and English), music, and geography—typical educational standards of the time. Leopoldina constantly switched between two residences during her youth—the Schloss Scharfenberg in Klipphausen during the summer, and her childhood home for the remainder of the year. With close access to the countryside, she naturally developed an interest in horse-riding, and later, curious about the landscapes surrounding her, took up watercoloring. It wouldn’t be until 1857 that Leopoldina would begin to spend the winter in Berlin, where the Prussian social season would be in full motion. It was that same year, within the Schloss Berlin, that she was presented at a ball for the Order of the Eagle before Emperor Wilhelm I and his consort, marking her entry into aristocratic German society.\nMarriage and Court Life\nOn October 22, 1858, Leopoldina married Count Georg von Schwarzenberg-Hohenlansberg, a member of the cadet branch of the House of Schwarzenberg, one of the most influential lineages of the Habsburg monarchy. The line in which she married, though not as politically prominent as the princely main line, controlled estates in both Bohemia and Lower Austria. The couple was married in a lavish ceremony, not in Berlin. Still, at the private chapel of the — It was briefly after this ceremony that Leopoldina converted to Catholicism in accordance with marital law at the time. Following this, the couple resided primarily at the Schloss Schwarzenberg and Schloss Seehaus, residing largely within the social perimeter of the Bavarian court. During this period, Leopoldina became an avid collector of fine art and antiques, using them to renovate and re-furnish many of her husband’s properties to reflect a more domestic attitude and style that she had grown up in. Due to the Dutch connotations with her title, Leopoldina occasionally spent time in the Belgian court.\nLeopoldina’s most prominent role, and her semi-permanent move to Berlin, came in 1891 with her appointment as lady-in-waiting to Empress Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein. Her position required her to assist in organizing charitable events on behalf of the Empress and to attend court ceremonies.  Her ascension to a court position enabled her to become a recipient of the Order of Louise, which she received in 1892. Originally, Leopoldina was given the option of grace-and-favor apartments within the Schloss Berlin, but coupled with her husband’s hereditary appointment as a senior court marshal to the German Emperor, the couple purchased a neoclassical mansion within the parameters of the Tiergarten quarter, partial funds being gifted to the couple. This period onward reflected a golden period for Leopoldina, who quickly established a salon frequented not only by the elite but also by intellectuals. Members of the Freisinnige Partei and foreign diplomats also become invitees, allowing her to establish connections across Europe and procure them for charitable initiatives. While she never openly held political opinions, her salon represented a space where conservative traditions and reformist ideas could be debated. Leopoldina further continued her extensive collection of decorative objects during this time.\nReferences"
