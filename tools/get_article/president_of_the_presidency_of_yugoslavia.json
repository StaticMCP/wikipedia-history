In 1974 a new Constitution was adopted which reaffirmed the collective federal presidency consisting of representatives of the six republics, the two autonomous provinces within Serbia and (until 1988) the President of the League of Communists. The 1974 Constitution defined the office of President of the Presidency, but only coming into effect with the disestablishment of the office of President of the Republic. A separate article affirmed Josip Broz Tito with an unlimited mandate which ensured the new President of the Presidency would not come into effect until after his death. Simultaneously an office of Vice President of the Presidency had been in place since 1971 on a rotating annual basis between republican and provincial representatives. When Tito died on 4 May 1980, the then Vice President of the Presidency Lazar Koliševski acceded to the role of President of the Presidency. Subsequent to this the role of President of the Presidency would rotate on an annual basis with each President serving as Vice President the year prior.\nList of presidents\n|League of Communists of Yugoslavia|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Liberal Democracy of Slovenia|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Socialist Party of Serbia|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Croatian Democratic Union|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2|\n! rowspan=2| Portrait\n! width=20% rowspan=2| Name\n! rowspan=2| Representing\n! colspan=3| Term of office\n! rowspan=2| Political party\n! rowspan=2| Note\n|-\n!
