Mitt Romney came in first with 39 percent of the vote, followed by John McCain with 30 percent and Mike Huckabee in third-place with 16 percent. The victory was widely viewed as critical for the Romney campaign, as a loss in Michigan, where his father was governor, would have resulted in a loss of momentum after two losses already in New Hampshire and Iowa.\nNational delegates determined: 30 out of 60\nIn accordance with Republican National Committee rules, Michigan was stripped of half its delegates for holding primary contests before February 5, 2008.\nCandidates\n* Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani of New York City\n* Former Governor Mike Huckabee of Arkansas\n* Congressman Duncan Hunter of California\n* Senator John McCain of Arizona\n* Congressman Ron Paul of Texas\n* Former Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts\n* Former Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee\nWithdrawn\n* Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas\n* Congressman Tom Tancredo of Colorado\nResults\n15 statewide delegates were awarded proportionally to candidates who got 15% or more of the vote.
