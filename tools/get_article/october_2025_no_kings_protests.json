The demonstrations, which followed the June 2025 No Kings protests, took place in some 2,700 locations across the country, including the National Mall in Washington, D.C., Chicago, and New York City.\nOrganizers of the protests estimated that the protests drew nearly 7 million attendees, while a partnership between data journalist G. Elliott Morris and The Xylom, an independent Atlanta-based science newsroom, estimated 5 million to 6.5 million participants. Either estimate would make this one of the largest single-day protests in American history.\nBackground and organizers\nThe October 18, 2025, protests followed the No Kings protests in June, the Free America Weekend on July 4, and the Good Trouble Lives On protest on July 17. About 200 organizations worked together to organize the October protests, including 50501 and Indivisible groups, as well as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Democratic Socialists of America, the American Federation of Teachers, Common Defense, the Human Rights Campaign, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN), the League of Conservation Voters, MoveOn, Public Citizen, United We Dream, and Working Families Power. Other organizers included Third Act Movement, Party for Socialism and Liberation, Social Security Works, Communications Workers of America, Freedom From Religion Foundation, New York Civil Liberties Union, League of Women Voters and American Federation of Government Employees.\nOutside the United States, protests were organized by Democrats Abroad. Various groups organized protests in the UK, including the Stop Trump Coalition.\nOrganizers were \"adamant that the rallies remain peaceful\", according to USA Today, and held virtual safety trainings ahead of the protests with help from the ACLU. According to The New York Times, \"Many had attended a similar event in June, but the months since had seen President Trump make a dizzying array of changes in quick succession.\"\nPre-emptive responses\nIn the days leading up to the protests, several administration officials said that protesters were members of Antifa, which Trump had labeled a \"domestic terrorist organization\" in a September executive order, on par with ISIS.}} On October 13, United States Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said protestors are \"part of Antifa\". Attorney General Pam Bondi attributed \"people out there with thousands of signs that all match, pre-bought, pre-put together\" to Antifa's high degree of organization, and pledged to \"get to the root of Antifa\" and \"find and charge all of those people who are causing this chaos\".\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson also linked the protests to Antifa, saying \"It's all the pro-Hamas wing and the Antifa people, they're all coming out,\" and that the group organizing the protest in Washington, D.C., is anti-American, while House majority whip Tom Emmer said that the \"terrorist wing\" of the Democratic party was set to hold them. They and House majority leader Steve Scalise called the protests a \"Hate America\" rally. Johnson also attacked the participants with: \"Let's see who shows up for that. I bet you see pro-Hamas supporters. I bet you see Antifa types. I bet you see the Marxists in full display, the people who don't want to stand and defend the foundational truths of this republic.\"\nThe Trump administration said it would take anti-terrorist measures during the protests such as mobilizing the FBI, and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said to Fox News that participants and the Democratic Party's main constituents were \"made up of Hamas terrorists, illegal aliens, and violent criminals\".\nDuffy and Senators Roger Marshall and Ted Cruz accused No Kings of using paid protesters. According to The Independent, Marshall baselessly laid the blame on George Soros, saying, \"We'll have to get the National Guard out. Hopefully it will be peaceful. I doubt it.\" Cruz also blamed Soros and urged to \"cut off the money\" behind \"these rallies that may well turn into riots\". He spoke of legislation he had introduced that would allow use of the RICO Act to prosecute the money he alleged was behind No Kings for \"supporting rioting and violence\", and said he had urged Attorney General Bondi and FBI director Kash Patel to prosecute.\nLocations and activities\nWhile most activities took place in the United States, some events were planned in Western Europe and Canada.

The ACLU stated that these protests demonstrate that many Americans are actively asserting their rights and will not remain silent when freedoms such as speech, assembly, and the press are perceived to be under threat.\nSee also\n*\n* Gen Z protests – Worldwide protests led by Generation Z in the 2020s\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raD5GuVUlsw livestream (7:53:07)] (October 18, 2025) from [https://www.youtube.com/@NoKingsMovement No Kings Movement] via YouTube\n* [https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/10/why-the-no-kings-protests-matter/684634/ Why the 'No Kings' Protests Matter], The Atlantic"
