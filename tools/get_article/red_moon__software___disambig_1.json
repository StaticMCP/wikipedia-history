It allows independent adjustment of colour temperature, luminosity and filter level, making it also possible to lower the effective screen brightness below the usual minimum brightness level of the device. Red Moon does not require root.\nSee also\n* List of free and open-source Android applications\n* Redshift (software)\n*Night Shift (software)\n*Electronic media and sleep\n*Light effects on circadian rhythm\n*Delayed sleep phase disorder\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://github.com/LibreShift/red-moon Source code]\n*\n* [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jmstudios.redmoon&hl=en Red Moon] at Google Play"
