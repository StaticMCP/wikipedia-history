State voters chose three representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nWyoming was won by the incumbent Vice President, Republican Party (United States) Richard Nixon, running with former United Nations Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., with 55.01 percent of the popular vote, against the Democratic nominee, Massachusetts Senator John F. Kennedy, running with Texas Senator Lyndon B. Johnson, with 44.99% of the popular vote, a 10% margin of victory. Nixon's victory was significantly smaller than Dwight Eisenhower's 20.2% margin of victory in 1956.\nWith Nixon's victory in the state, Republicans would see a full sweep of statewide offices that were on the ballot, including the sole House of Representatives election and the Class II Senate seat.\nCampaign\nAt the Democratic National Convention the Wyoming delegation had the ceremonial role of giving Kennedy the minimum amount needed to win the Democratic presidential nomination with Teno Roncalio casting the votes although Tracy S. McCraken, Wyoming's national committeeman, was incorrectly stated to have been the one to cast the votes by Time magazine. Governor John J. Hickey stated that the issue over Kennedy's Catholicism would not be important in Wyoming due to Hickey, who was also a Catholic, having won in 1958. During the campaign Nixon conducted a fifty-state strategy and visited every state at least once including Wyoming.\nThe Republican Party selected Harry B. Henderson, Mary Ellen Hinrichs, and James B. Griffith Sr. as their presidential electors.\nEndorsements\n*Teno Roncalio, Chairman of the Wyoming Democratic Party\n}}\nResults\n}}\nResults by county\n{|width=\"60%\" class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\" |County\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" |Richard NixonRepublican\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" |John F.
