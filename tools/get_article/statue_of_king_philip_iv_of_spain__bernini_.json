He holds a scepter in his right hand while resting his left hand on the sword's hilt. His pose is captured in an exaggerated contrapposto stance, with his head turned towards the right and his gaze directed beyond the raised scepter, creating the impression that he is about to issue a command. The sculpture depicts the king as a hero, embodying the qualities of a warrior-king and protector of the Catholic church.\nLocation\nThe statue is located in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. Upon entering the portico, the statue is against the right wall.\nHistory\nThe statue was first proposed in 1643, but a contract was not signed until 1664. Work began the same year and the sculpture was completed in 1666.\nGallery\nFile:Statue of King Philip IV of Spain (Bernini) 03.jpg\nFile:Statue of King Philip IV of Spain (Bernini) 04.jpg\nFile:Statue of King Philip IV of Spain (Bernini) 01.jpg\nFile:Statue of King Philip IV of Spain (Bernini) 06.jpg\nFile:Statue of King Philip IV of Spain (Bernini) 07.jpg\nFile:Statue of King Philip IV of Spain (Bernini) 05.jpg\nSee also\n* List of works by Gian Lorenzo Bernini\nReferences\n;Notes\n;Bibliography\n*\nExternal links\n*"
