It was an offshoot of the larger Bavarian War (1420–1422).\nIn 1914 the German writer Ludwig Ganghofer wrote The War of the Oxen, a novel using the war as a backdrop. The novel has subsequently been made into two films and a television series.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Nemoianu, Virgil.  Postmodernism and Cultural Identities: Conflicts and Coexistence.
