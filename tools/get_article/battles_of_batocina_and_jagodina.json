Some 400 \"Turks\" were killed after the rebel forces surrounded them.\nBackground\nKarađorđe and the Rudnik nahiya rebels under Lazar Mutap, Arsenije Loma, Milić Drinčić and Milan Obrenović attacked and took over the town of Rudnik in 27–28 February. The Rudnik leaders went to rally the Rudnik nahiya while Karađorđe went to Topola via Stragari and Vrbica and then further. Karađorđe asked Milan Obrenović to go to Topola with the Rudnik rebel army and then continue to Jagodina. In mid-March, the Rudnik rebels attacked Jagodina but were repelled by Kučuk-Alija and Alija Gušanac's kırcalı (bandits). Karađorđe then mustered troops and set out for Jagodina.\nHistory\nAccording to some sources, Kučuk-Alija had left Jagodina with part of his army staying at Batočina while he went to Paraćin and Niš to collect more kırcalı. After taking over Kragujevac on 4 April, Karađorđe surrounded Batočina where Kučuk-Alija's Albanian kırcalı stayed. Meanwhile, Karađorđe ordered Dimitrije Parezan and his troops from Lepenice to set up an ambush at Rogot towards Brzan to await any \"Turks\", whether they flee Batočina or arrive from Jagodina. Karađorđe's troops fought the kırcalı into the dark, while Karađorđe went to rise up the Levač region. When Kučuk-Alija found out that Karađorđe had left, he sent Tosun-Aga with five hundred cavalry to break through to Batočina at night. After taking up positions, a new Serb attack began on 7 April (26 March O.S.). The \"Turks\" decided to retreat towards Jagodina, where they were to meet with Kučuk-Alija and continue further towards Belgrade. However, on the way to Jagodina, the troops of Dimitrije Parezan and Đuka Filipović awaited them in the Rogot forest, so the \"Turks\" decided to look for a way out towards Kijevo through the Kijevo stream. Karađorđe waited for them to move as far away from Batočina as possible, so he followed them and caught up with them at the Kijevo stream between Kijevo and Dobrovodica. About four hundred \"Turks\" fell, including Musein Ganić and Jusuf-aga Klimentić (known as Daija Koltuk), while Tosun-aga barely escaped and fled to Jagodina. In addition, the rebels gained rich booty, including hundreds of rifles and nine standards.\nKarađorđe informed Austrian contact Mitesser about the defeat of Turks at Batočina and Jagodina in a letter dated 16 April 1804. After the victory, Milan Obrenović and the Rudnik rebels were returned to the Rudnik nahiya. Karađorđe then defeated Kučuk-Alija at Paraćin, resulting in the expansion of uprising in that area, under Ilija Barjaktarević.\nFrench newspaper Le Moniteur Universel reported on the battles on 12 April 1804:\n(The other day a fierce and bloody battle was led at Batočina. The rebels surrounded this town which held a garrison of 400 Turks who desperately fought. After several hours of fighting, they were defeated and almost all of them died. A hundred Serbian rebels also died.)\nSee also\n*Timeline of the Serbian Revolution\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
