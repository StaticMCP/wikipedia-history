The awards were contested across five main categories: National Print, Periodicals, Radio, Television Documentary, and Television News. A notable feature of this year was that two separate awards were presented in the Television Documentary category. The ceremony was presented by Pierre Sané and hosted by Peter Snow. The overall winner, and recipient of the Television News award, was Sue Lloyd-Roberts of BBC Breakfast, for her crucial reporting on China's notorious 'laogai' (labour camps).\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.amnesty.org.uk Amnesty International UK (AIUK) website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130112212735/http://www.amnesty.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=10058 Amnesty International UK Media Awards at the AIUK Website]\n* [https://www.amnesty.org/ Amnesty International Website]"
