The program started in 1958. The team competes in the NCAA Division III and a member of the American Rivers Conference (ARC). The team plays its home games at Harms Stadium at Hertel field in Waverly, Iowa.\nHistory\nThe Wartburg Knights baseball team played its first season in 1958, with its first game coming against Iowa Wesleyan. The Knights reached the NAIA World Series in 1964.  They hold the record for longest game played when they beat West Liberty State in a 16 inning game. The program rose to national relevance in the late 1990s, early 2000s when Joel Holst was hired in 1996. The program has won a conference leading 22 conference championships, the most recent coming 2017 when they won three straight IIAC titles.\nJoel Holst era (1997-2022)\nJoel Holst was hired in 1995 and coached his first season at Wartburg in 1996.  In his first season they finished with a .500 record at 20-20.  Following that season the Knights would go on to win 12 straight conference regular season championships and appeared in the college world series on two occasions (2000, 2005). During the 2005 College World Series the Knights played in two games that set records; the first was the longest game in series history in terms of innings, when they defeated Rowan College in 16 innings 8–6 and then played in the shortest game in series history when they lost to SUNY Cortland 5–0 in 1 hour and 52 minutes.  Joel Holst resigned from his head coaching position prior to the 2023 season. Following his resignation, Casey Chaplin was named interim head coach for the 2023 baseball season.\nCasey Klunder era (2024-Present)\nFollowing the 2023 season, Casey Klunder, was tabbed as the fifth head coach in program history.  He began his tenure at Wartburg with a 12–4 win over Grove City, with a 3–0 start to the year.\nRecord by year\nThis is a table of the Wartburg Knights record year-by-year.\nAmerican Rivers Conference tournaments\nWartburg has made 30 appearances in the American Rivers Conference baseball tournament and 19 appearances in the tournament championship game; both of which is the most in tournament history. They appeared in 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025.
