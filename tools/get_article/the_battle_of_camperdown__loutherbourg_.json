      "text": "# The Battle of Camperdown (Loutherbourg)\n\nThe Battle of Camperdown is a 1799 history painting by the French-born British artist Philip James de Loutherbourg. It depicts the naval Battle of Camperdown fought on 11 February 1797 during the French Revolutionary Wars. The battle ended in a victory for the British Royal Navy over a Dutch fleet allied to Britain's enemy France.\nLoutherbourg was known both for his romantic landscapes and his scenes of battles. He produced a companion piece to the work The Battle of the Nile the following year featuring another recent British naval victory. Today both paintings are in the collection of the Tate Britain in London.\nSee also\n* The Battle of Camperdown, a painting by the Anglo-American artist John Singleton Copley from the same year\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Cordingly, David.
