The police investigation (\"Operation\") under which each arrest was made is shown in parentheses.\nBackground\nIn 2004, ten arrests were made under Operation Nigeria following placement of a police listening device in the office of private investigator Jonathan Rees and a subsequent raid on the home of Stephen Whittamore. Recorded conversations and seized documents established that Paul Marshall, a former civilian communications officer based at Tooting police station in London, provided confidential information to Alan King, a retired police officer, who passed it along to private investigator John Boyall, who in turn gave it to private investigator Stephen Whittamore, who in turn sold it to agents of national press organizations. All were convicted of crimes.\nIn 2006, three arrests were made as a result of the Royal Household/Goodman Inquiry into illegal interception of phone messages of members of the Royal household by Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire. Goodman and Mulcaire pleaded guilty to crimes.\nIn September 2009, Metropolitan Police Service Assistant Commissioner John Yates testified before the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee that \"there remain now insufficient grounds or evidence to arrest or interview anyone else and...no additional evidence has come to light.\"  In 2011, however, investigations renewed in response to public disclosures from the press.  These resulted in many additional arrests that included law enforcement officers, public officials and former editors and executives of news organizations.\nAs of mid-October 2012, over 100 people had been arrested since 1999 relating to illegal acquisition of confidential information.  All but 10 of these were arrested or rearrested since police investigations were renewed in 2011.  In some cases, a single individual was arrested more than once or arrested in conjunction with more than one police operation.\n::09 Operation Nigeria (confidential information)\n::03 Royal Household/Goodman Inquiry (phone hacking)\n::25 Operation Weeting (phone hacking)\n::52 Operation Elveden (computer hacking)\n::16 Operation Tuleta (bribery, corruption)\n::03 Operation Rubicon (phone hacking, breach of data protection and perjury in Scotland)\n::04 No named police operation\n::-08 Adjustment for arrests included under more than one operation (e.g. one person arrested for both Weeting and Elveden)\n::---\n::104 Total people arrested\nOf these arrests, at least 40 have been current or former journalists, 21 at The Sun, 16 at News of the World, 2 at the Mirror, 1 at The Times, and another from an unnamed newspaper.\nArrested\n# Neville Thurlbeck; (1999) arrested for allegedly bribing a police officer and for conspiracy.

(Elveden #52)\nCharged with crimes\nThis is a chronological list of individuals charged with crimes relating to the phone hacking scandal since 1999.  Some individuals are listed more than once because they were charged at different times for different offenses.  As of September 2012, 31 people had been charged, including five who had been charged twice.\nThe first two were charged in 1999 relating to alleged bribery of a police officer to obtain confidential information from a police computer.  They were tried but acquitted when the judge directed the verdict due to lack of evidence.\nThe next four were private investigators charged in 2005 for illegal acquisition of confidential information.  They were not convicted.\nThen next five were private investigators also charged in 2005 for illegal acquisition of confidential information.

A seventh person, a former News International security guard, was charged relating to the same case on 12 September 2012.  Two computers were found in a parking garage trash bin near Brook's home.  These charges were made about 1 year after the Metropolitan Police Service reopened its dormant investigation into phone hacking, about 3 years after the then Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service told the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee that \"no additional evidence has come to light,\" 5 years after News International executives began claiming that phone hacking was the work of a single \"rogue reporter, 10 years after The Guardian began reporting that the Met had evidence of widespread illegal acquisition of confidential information, and 13 years after the Met began accumulating \"boxloads\" of that evidence but kept it unexamined in trash bags at Scotland Yard.\nOn 30 May 2012, Scotland police charged Andy Coulson with perjury relating to the trial of Tommy Sheridan held there in 2010 during the period Coulson was a senior adviser to Prime Minister David Cameron.

Seven of the eight were \"charged with conspiring to intercept communications without lawful authority from 3rd October 2000 to 9th August 2006.\"  All eight were charged with illegal interception of communications relating to specific individuals.\nIn August 2012, additional files covering possible crimes were submitted to CPS by the Met for advice prior to making formal charges. The seven individuals including four journalists alleged to have been involved in wrongdoing, included one in relation to Operation Sacha under which Rebekah Brooks and others were charged, two members of the public in relation to money laundering under Operation Weeting, two in relation to alleged illegal payments to public officials including police officers under Operation Elveden, and the rest involving journalists and public officials in relation to misconduct in public office.\n# Neville Thurlbeck; (1999) journalist for News of the Worldcharged with allegedly bribing a police officer, Detective Con Farmer, to supply information on people whose details were kept on a confidential police computer.
