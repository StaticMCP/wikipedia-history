The stop is situated on Queens Walk in the Meadows area of the city of Nottingham. It is situated on reserved track and comprises a pair of side platforms flanking the tracks. The stop is on line 2 of the NET, from Phoenix Park via the city centre to Clifton, and trams run at frequencies that vary between 4 and 8 trams per hour, depending on the day and time of day.\nQueens Walk opened on 25 August 2015, along with the rest of NET's phase two.\nIn the original plans for NET phase two, the stop now known as Meadows Embankment was to be called Queens Walk. However, by popular demand this name was transferred to this stop, which had previously known as Meadows Centre.\nGallery\nQueens Walk Community Centre - geograph.org.uk - 1243397.jpg|The site of the stop in 2009 before construction started\nMeadows Centre tram stop (geograph 4148220).jpg|The stop under construction in 2014\nThe Meadows, Queens Walk 9998.JPG|A similar view in 2016, with the stop in use\nReferences\nExternal links"
