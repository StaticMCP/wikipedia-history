In late 1971 he was sentenced to one week in Adelaide Gaol as a conscientious non-complier with the National Service Act, and in February 1972 he was sentenced to eighteen months for refusing to report at Keswick Barracks. He was released by the Whitlam Duumvirate in December 1972 having served ten months – one of seven men in Australian prisons for refusing conscription freed at that time.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=1021  Conscription after 1945]\n* [http://www.awm.gov.au/encyclopedia/viet_app/  The National Service scheme, 1964–72]"
