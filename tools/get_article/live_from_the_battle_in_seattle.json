Of the five tracks on the album, only two, \"New Feudalism\" and \"Electronic Plantation\", are original songs. \"Let's Lynch the Landlord\" and \"Full Metal Jackoff\" are both covers, by Jello Biafra's former band Dead Kennedys, and D.O.A. featuring Biafra, respectively. \"Battle in Seattle\" is an opening speech/rallying cry by Jello Biafra. Biafra later re-recorded \"New Feudalism\" and \"Electronic Plantation\" for the album The Audacity of Hype by Jello Biafra and the Guantanamo School of Medicine.\nTrack listing\n#\"Battle in Seattle\" – 15:02\n#\"Let's Lynch the Landlord\" – 3:41\n#\"New Feudalism\" – 4:15\n#\"Electronic Plantation\" – 4:55\n#\"Full Metal Jackoff\" – 16:28\nPersonnel\n*Jello Biafra – vocals\n*Kim Thayil – guitar\n*Krist Novoselic – bass\n*Gina Mainwal – drums\n*The No WTO Combo – Main Performer\n*Shepard Fairey – CD Art Adaptation, Tray Photo, Cover Art Concept\n*Tony Gale – Photography\n*Jason Rosenberg – Construction\n*Jack Endino – Mixing\n*Jello Biafra – Package Concept\n*Necessity – Producer\n*Mark Cavener – Engineer / Producer\n*Todd Robbins – Digital Editing\nReferences"
