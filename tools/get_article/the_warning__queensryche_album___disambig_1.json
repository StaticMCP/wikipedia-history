The album was recorded in various recording studios in London with Pink Floyd-producer James Guthrie.\nIn 2013, lead singer Geoff Tate explained the band's dissatisfaction with the album's mix: \"The only time I ever experienced [a record label restricting creative freedom] was during the recording of Queensrÿche's first album, The Warning. We went $300,000 over budget and the label took the record out of our hands and gave it to someone else to mix. ... The guy that mixed the album had no clue what Queensrÿche was. He never listened to hard rock music and didn't take input from anyone in the band. He just mixed it according to how he thought it should sound. No-one in the band could listen to that record. We all hated it.\"\nThe Warning shows the band in an early stage of development, playing straight heavy metal songs unlike later albums in which more experimentation was expressed. It was a moderate commercial success in the United States, although none of the singles charted domestically. However, \"Take Hold of the Flame\" was an international hit, particularly in Japan.\nIn support of the release, Queensrÿche went on a worldwide tour from August 1984 through to July 1985. During the American leg of their tour, they were the opening act for Kiss on their 1984–85 Animalize Tour and Iron Maiden on their 1984–85 World Slavery Tour, while in Europe they opened for Dio on their The Last in Line tour 1984. They also opened for Accept on their Metal Heart tour in 1985.\nTrack listing\nThe album's original track sequence and sound mix that the band had approved, was changed by mix engineer Val Garay under orders from EMI-America, against the wishes of the band. This original intended sequence is identical to the final track listing but with the following exceptions: \"N&nbsp;M&nbsp;156\" as the opening song, \"Warning\" as the second to last track, and \"Deliverance\" and \"No Sanctuary\" appearing in the opposite order. The band first learned of this in August 1984, while on tour in Japan.\nOriginal track listing (unreleased)\n#N&nbsp;M&nbsp;156\n#En Force\n#No Sanctuary\n#Deliverance\n#Take Hold of the Flame\n#Before the Storm\n#Child of Fire\n#Warning\n#Roads to Madness\nPersonnel\nQueensrÿche\n*Geoff Tate – lead vocals\n*Chris DeGarmo – guitars (lead guitar on \"Take Hold of the Flame\"), backing vocals\n*Michael Wilton – guitars (lead guitar on \"Warning\"), backing vocals\n*Eddie Jackson – bass, backing vocals\n*Scott Rockenfield – drums\nAdditional musicians\n*Michael Kamen – conducting, orchestral arrangement\nProduction\n*James Guthrie – production\n*Val Garay – mixing\n*Neil Kernon – engineering, mixing (\"The Prophecy\"), production\n*Evren Göknar – 2003 remastering\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1984)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak position\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nCertifications\nReferences"
