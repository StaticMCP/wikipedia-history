A year later, she won bronze in the same event with Alyce Pulford.  She competed with Louise Ayling at the 2012 Summer Olympics.\nTogether with Sophie MacKenzie, she was world champion in the lightweight double scull for two years in a row; first at the 2014 World Rowing Championships in Amsterdam, and then at the 2015 World Rowing Championships in Aiguebelette.\nThe 2016 rowing year did not start out that successful for Edward and MacKenzie, and at both World Rowing Cups that New Zealand attended that year, they came third, beaten by different nations at those regattas. When they competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro later that year, they came fourth in the lightweight double sculls, which was disappointing to them. Some time after the Olympics, they both announced that they would take a year off rowing. Both will also take the 2018 rowing season off, but neither has announced their retirement.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*"
