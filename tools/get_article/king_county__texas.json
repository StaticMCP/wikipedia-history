Its population was 265 at the 2020 census, making it the second-least populated county in Texas and the third-least populated county in the United States. King County has no incorporated communities. Its county seat is the census-designated place (CDP) of Guthrie. The county was created in 1876 and organized in 1891. It is named for William Philip King, who died at the Battle of the Alamo.\nHistory\nNative Americans\nThe Apache and Comanche were early tribes in the area. The Red River War of 1874-1875 was a United States Army campaign to force the removal of Natives in Texas and their relocation to reservations, to open the region to White settlers.\nCounty established\nOn August 21, 1876, the Texas Legislature formed King County from Bexar County. By 1880, the United States Census counted 40 residents in the county. In 1891, the county was organized.  Guthrie was designated as the county seat.\nEarly ranchers preserved water by damming canyons and draws to hold the heavy spring rains. In the 1890s, windmills became the method of water provision.  Some of the earliest settlers were Isom Lynn, A. C. Tackett, Brants Baker, and Bud Arnett. The Four Sixes Ranch was established in 1902 by Samuel Burk Burnett. The formerly named Pitchfork Land and Cattle Company was organized in 1883, and SMS ranches were established during the same time frame.  The 6666 (called Four Sixes Ranch), also founded in 1883, was managed from 1965 to 1986 by George Humphreys, who was also affiliated with the National Ranching Heritage Center in Lubbock.\nDumont was formed in the late 19th century. By that time, farmers began to share the land with ranchers. Cotton was the leading crop for a time, followed by corn, sorghum, and fruit trees.\nOil was discovered in the county in 1943. By January 1, 1991, almost  of oil had been pumped from King County lands since the first wells were drilled.\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which  (0.3%) are covered by water. Much of the land in King County Texas is Grassland, and hilly, broken country, much of which is composed of dark loam and red soils.The county has a temperate climate with mild winters and hot summers with temperatures ranging from an average of 27 degrees Fahrenheit in January to 99 degrees Fahrenheit in July.
