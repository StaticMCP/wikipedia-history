The primary was organized by the governing centre-right party following the decision by party chairman and Prime Minister Donald Tusk not to run for president again (he lost in a runoff to incumbent Lech Kaczyński in 2005). Prior to his withdrawal, Tusk was thought to be the presumptive nominee.\nThe vote lasted from March 18 to March 25. Results were announced on March 27.\nCandidates\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"28\" style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" |\nCivic Platform Nominee\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:; width:200px;\"|\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:; width:200px;\"|\n|- style=\"color:#000; font-size:100%; background:#FCA241 ;\"\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n| Marshal of the Sejm(2007-2010)\n| Minister of Foreign Affairs(2007–2014)\n|}\nResults\nTurnout was 47.5 percent, or more than 21,000 of the total party members.
