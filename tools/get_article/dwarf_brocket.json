Its pelage is reddish-brown with dark grey foreparts and neck. The underparts are lighter brown, and the muzzle short and thick. It weighs around 11&nbsp;kg.\nA little-studied species of brocket deer, the IUCN considers the dwarf brocket as Vulnerable. Research has occurred in the forests of Bolivia, expanding known localities and modelling geographic distribution; while as much as 40% of the habitat was degraded or fragmented, the rest showed good conservation. This led to the recommendation of treating it as Vulnerable.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Dwarf Brocket\n\n#REDIRECT Dwarf brocket"
