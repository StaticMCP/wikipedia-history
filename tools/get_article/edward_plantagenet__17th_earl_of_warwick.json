He was also a younger brother of Margaret Pole, 8th Countess of Salisbury. Edward was tried and executed for treason in 1499.\nLife\nEdward Plantagenet was the son of George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence and Isabel Neville, who was the elder daughter of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick. Edward was born on 25 February 1475 at Warwick, the family home of his mother. At his christening, his uncle King Edward IV stood as godfather. He was styled as Earl of Warwick from birth, but was not officially granted the title until after his father's death in 1478. His potential claim to the throne following the deposition of his cousin Edward V in 1483 was disallowed because Parliament's attainder of his father had barred Warwick from the succession in 1478. This might have been reversed by an act of Parliament, but even had this idea found favour, Parliament could not sit or legislate without being opened by the king, and the succession had not yet been decided. At this time Richard Duke of Gloucester was the senior legitimate successor to Edward IV. Edward Earl of Warwick was knighted at York by Richard III in September 1483.\nIn 1480, Warwick had been made a ward of King Edward IV's stepson, Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset, who as his guardian had the power to decide whom he would marry. Clements Markham, writing in 1906, claimed that Richard III had \"liberated\" Warwick from the Tower of London, where Dorset had placed him; however, there are no contemporary sources for this claim, although Dorset was Constable of the Tower. Dominic Mancini wrote that Richard, on becoming king, \"gave orders that the son of the duke of Clarence, his other brother, then a boy of ten years old, should come to the city: and commanded that the lad should be kept in confinement in the household of his wife\".\nJohn Rous (died 1492) wrote that after the death of Richard III's only legitimate son, Edward of Middleham, who was Warwick's double first cousin (their fathers were brothers and their mothers were sisters), Richard III named Warwick as heir to the throne; however, there is no other evidence for this, and historians have pointed out that it would be illogical for Richard to do so while Edward IV's attainder of Clarence still barred Warwick from the succession.\nImprisonment and execution\nFollowing the death on 16 March 1485 of Richard III's queen, Anne, young Edward Plantagenet was vested as Earl of Salisbury by right of his mother Isabel, who had been a co-heiress with Anne to the abeyant earldom. This provided Edward with not just more wealth, but also (had he gained support) a possible claim to the throne. Following Richard III's death on 22 August 1485, Warwick, only ten years old, was sent to the Tower of London as a ward of Henry VII who regarded his Plantagenet bloodline as a potential threat, albeit remote. After the appearance of the pretender who was crowned King Edward in Dublin in 1486, Henry declared that the pretender was an impostor claiming to be Edward Earl of Warwick; in Parliament in 1487 he gave the impostor's name as Lambert Simnel. In 1490, Henry's court confirmed Edward's title of Earl of Warwick (his succession to the earldom of Warwick being through his mother by grant of Edward IV). He remained a prisoner until 1499, when he became involved (willingly or unwillingly) in a plot to escape from the Tower with another prisoner. This prisoner, named by Henry as Perkin Warbeck, had threatened Henry's throne by presenting himself as the Duke of York, younger son of Edward IV.\nOn 21 November 1499, Warwick appeared at Westminster in a trial before his peers, presided over by the Earl of Oxford. A week later, Warwick was beheaded for treason on Tower Hill. Henry VII paid for his body and head to be taken to Bisham Abbey in Berkshire for burial. It was thought at the time that Warwick was executed in response to pressure from Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, whose daughter, Catherine of Aragon, was to marry Henry's heir, Arthur. Catherine was said to feel very guilty about Warwick's death, and believed that her trials in later life were punishment for it.\nA number of historians have claimed that Warwick had a mental disability. This conclusion appears entirely based on the chronicler Edward Hall's contention that Warwick's lengthy imprisonment from a young age had left him \"out of all company of men, and sight of beasts, in so much that he could not discern a goose from a capon.\"\nUpon Warwick's death, the House of Plantagenet became extinct in the legitimate male line. However, the surviving sons of his aunt Elizabeth, Duchess of Suffolk, continued to claim the throne for the Yorkist line.\nAncestors\nFurther reading\n*\nReferences"
