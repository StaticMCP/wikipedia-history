Ward Farm is a historic home and farm located near Bynum, Chatham County, North Carolina. The main house was built in sections during the mid-19th through early-20th century beginning about 1840.  The earliest section is a -story, gable-roofed, two room log structure, that forms the rear of the main section.  The main section was built about 1870, and is a one-story, gable-roofed frame structure with a simple gable-front porch.  A one-story board-and-batten rear ell was added about 1900.  Also on the property are the contributing office of Dr. Ward, carriage house and gear room, board-and-batten barn and log cribs, smokehouse and pen, and a small brick well house.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.\nReferences"
