The role of president has existed since the foundation of the GAA. The president of the GAA is one of the leading figures in civil society in Ireland, as the association has around one million members and is present in every parish in the country. The role of president involves representing the GAA in Ireland and across the world. Former presidents of the GAA have a key role within the GAA, sitting on the motions committee which rules if motions to the annual Congress are in order. They also have become known for other roles such as Seán Kelly, who was later elected as an MEP for the South constituency.\nThe president travels across Ireland and the world to promote the organisation and attend games; former President Nickey Brennan travelled 160,000 miles in Ireland alone during his three years as president, and visited Great Britain, Europe, North America, Asia, Australia and the Middle East on several occasions, meeting dignitaries such as New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg along the way.\nJarlath Burns assumed office as president on 24 February 2024.\nSelection\nThe president is elected at Annual Congress. They then serve as Uachtarán-Tofa for one year.\nHistory\nIn 1981, John Kerry O'Donnell became the first overseas member of the GAA to run for president.\nIn 2020, Larry McCarthy became the first overseas member of the GAA to be elected as president.\nList of presidents of the Gaelic Athletic Association\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!\n!Portrait\n!Name\n!Name in Irish\n!colspan=2|Term of office\n!County\n|-\n|1.\n|\n|Maurice Davin\n|Muiris Ó Daimhín\n|1884\n|1887\n| Tipperary\n|-\n|2.\n|\n|Edward Bennet\n|Éamonn Mac Beinéid\n|1887\n|1888\n| Clare\n|-\n|\n|\n|Maurice Davin(2nd term)\n|Muiris Ó Daimhín\n|1888\n|1889\n| Tipperary\n|-\n|3.\n|\n|Peter Kelly\n|Peadar Ó Ceallaigh\n|1889\n|1895\n| Galway\n|-\n|4.\n|\n|Frank Dineen\n|Proinsias Ó Duinnín\n|1895\n|1898\n| Limerick\n|-\n|5.\n|\n|Michael Deering\n|\n|1898\n|1901\n| Cork\n|-\n|6.\n|\n|James Nowlan – June 1924)}}\n|Séamus Ó Nualláin\n|1901\n|1921\n| Kilkenny\n|-\n|7.\n|\n|Daniel McCarthy\n|Dónal Mac Cárthaigh\n|1921\n|1924\n| Dublin\n|-\n|8.\n|\n|Patrick Breen\n|Pádraig Ó Braoin\n|1924\n|1926\n| Wexford\n|-\n|9.\n|\n|Liam Clifford\n|Liam Mac Rifeartaigh\n|1926\n|1928\n| Limerick\n|-\n|10.\n|\n|Seán Ryan\n|Seán Ó Riain\n|1928\n|1932\n| Tipperary\n|-\n|11.\n|\n|Seán McCarthy\n|Seán Mac Cárthaigh\n|1932\n|1935\n| Cork\n|-\n|12.\n|\n|Bob O'Keeffe\n|Roibeard Ó Caoimh\n|1935\n|1938\n| Laois\n|-\n|13.\n|\n|Pádraig MacNamee\n|Pádraig Mac Con Midhe\n|1938\n|1943\n| Antrim\n|-\n|14.\n|\n|Séamus Gardiner\n|Séamas Gairnéir\n|1943\n|1946\n| Clare\n|-\n|15.\n|\n|Daniel O'Rourke\n|Dónal Ó Ruairc\n|1946\n|1949\n| Roscommon\n|-\n|16.\n|\n|Michael Kehoe}}\n|Mícheál Mac Eochaidh\n|1949\n|1952\n| Wexford\n|-\n|17.\n|\n|Vincent O'Donoghue\n|Uinseann Ó Donnchú\n|1952\n|1955\n| Galway\n|-\n|18.\n|\n|Séamus McFerran\n|Séamus Mac Mhearáin\n|1955\n|1958\n| Antrim\n|-\n|19.\n|\n|Joseph Stuart\n|Seosamh Stíobhard\n|1958\n|1961\n| Clare\n|-\n|20.\n|\n|Aodh Ó Broin}}\n|Aodh Ó Broin\n|1961\n|1964\n| Wicklow\n|-\n|21.\n|\n|Alf Murray\n|Alf Ó Muirí\n|1964\n|1967\n| Armagh\n|-\n|22.\n|\n|Séamus Ó Riain\n|Séamus Ó Riain\n|1967\n|1970\n| Tipperary\n|-\n|23.\n|\n|Pat Fanning\n|Pádraig Ó Fainín\n|1970\n|1973\n| Waterford\n|-\n|24.\n|\n|Donal Keenan\n|Donal Ó Cianáin\n|1973\n|1976\n| Roscommon\n|-\n|25.\n|\n|Con Murphy\n|Conchur Ó Murchú\n|1976\n|1979\n| Cork\n|-\n|26.\n|\n|Paddy McFlynn\n|Pádraig Mac Floinn\n|1979\n|1982\n| Down\n|-\n|27.\n|\n|Paddy Buggy\n|Páidí Ó Bogaigh\n|1982\n|1985\n| Kilkenny\n|-\n|28.\n|\n|Dr Mick Loftus\n|Micheál Ó Lochláin\n|1985\n|1988\n|  Mayo\n|-\n|29.\n|\n|John Dowling}}\n|Seán Ó Dúllaing\n|1988\n|1991\n| Offaly\n|-\n|30.\n|\n|Peter Quinn\n|Peadar Ó Coinn\n|1991\n|1994\n| Fermanagh\n|-\n|31.\n|\n|Jack Boothman\n|Seáinín Bútman\n|1994\n|1997\n| Wicklow\n|-\n|32.\n|\n|Joe McDonagh\n|Seosamh Mac Donnchadha\n|1997\n|2000\n| Galway\n|-\n|33.\n|\n|Seán McCague – 24 November 2022)}}\n|Seán Mac Thaidhg\n|2000\n|2003\n| Monaghan\n|-\n|34.\n|\n|Seán Kelly\n|Seán Ó Ceallaigh\n|2003\n|2006\n| Kerry\n|-\n|35.\n|\n|Nickey Brennan\n|Nioclás Ó Braonáin\n|2006\n|2009\n| Kilkenny\n|-\n|36.\n|\n|Christy Cooney\n|Críostóir Ó Cuana\n|2009\n|2012\n| Cork\n|-\n|37.\n|\n|Liam O'Neill\n|Liam Ó Néill\n|2012\n|2015\n| Laois\n|-\n|38.\n|\n|Aogán Ó Fearghail\n|Aogán Ó Fearghail\n|2015\n|2018\n| Cavan\n|-\n|39.\n|\n|John Horan\n|Seán Ó hÓráin\n|2018\n|2021\n| Dublin\n|-\n|40\n|\n|Larry McCarthy\n|Labhrás Mac Carthaigh\n| 2021\n|2024\n| New York\n|-\n|41\n|\n|Jarlath Burns\n|Iarlaith Ó Broin\n|2024\n|2027\n| Armagh\n|-\n|}\nPresident's Awards\nSeán Kelly introduced the President's Awards.\nThey are awarded annually.\nPlayer–presidents\nDonal Keenan, Con Murphy, Paddy Buggy, Mick Loftus, Joe McDonagh and Nickey Brennan all won All-Ireland medals as players before becoming president.\nJohn Dowling was with the Tullamore club as a dual player, but at inter-county level his involvement was more as a referee, officiating in five All-Ireland finals.\nPeter Quinn played for Teemore in Fermanagh, winning a Junior Football Championship.
