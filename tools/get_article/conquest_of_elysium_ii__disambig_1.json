      "text": "# Conquest of Elysium II__disambig_1\n\nConquest of Elysium II (\"II\" denotes the version 2.0, the first Windows compatible version) is a turn-based strategy game developed by Illwinter Game Design. The game can be played with up to eight human players. Single player against computer is possible. The game has support for Linux, Windows, Mac OS X and Solaris, and is currently free to download.\nGoal\nThe goal is the elimination of other players either by eliminating their commanders or capturing their citadels.\nSetup\nAt the start, the player can choose whether to create a random map or load a scenario. Random maps ask for a size of the map and the amount of terrain features. They require the player to select the society to base the map on. The societies affect the number of settlements, what kinds of NPCs threaten the players and the general shape of the map. For example, the \"Monarchy\" setting has independent castles surrounded by farms and minor settlements as a dominant feature. Available societies range from early human settlements to a crumbled central empire.\nNext, the player chooses a character from among seventeen options. The characters are divided into Warlords, Magic users, Priests and Non-humans. The character is, in practice, the player's \"nation\". Each character has its own strengths and require different playstyles. Warlords have strong military units and occasionally special features such as the ability to levy soldiers or construct watchtowers. Magic users gather a unique resource, and their strength is their summoned or constructed creatures. Priests differ from each other, but generally need to either capture civilized settlements (for converts or blood sacrifices), or gather herbs or fungi (for use in summoning or attacking).\nThe game map, made out of separate terrain tiles, is littered with different terrain types and locations including old battlefields, settlements of varying size, mines and locations that can be used as additional citadels. Certain locations have other uses for some characters. Seasonal changes affect money and spells. For example, Winter greatly reduces tax income and stunts growth of herbs and fungi.\nGameplay\nThe game is combat oriented. Control of each player's nation is basically limited to buying units or changing the tax. Units are recruited centrally and are deployed into special structures called \"citadels\", which range from castles to wooden watchtowers. Large cities double as citadels. Units troops require a commander to be moved. Troops range from spearmen to siege engines and mythological and imaginary creatures of varying strength.\nCombat is handled in a separate mode: when two armies clash the game calculates combat results in the turn generation and the player gets to see the battles during the turn generation. Combat is automated and the player can only watch once combat starts. The opposing armies line up against each other. Some units have special abilities that come into play in combat. The combat's graphical presentation is simple: the only things displayed are the units on a black background and the possible walls protecting the defenders. Sound effects are few and simple as are spell effects.\nThe game's interface is partially usable by mouse and partially keyboard only. This ensures that the game runs on minimally equipped computers.\nThe game is one of Illwinter's lesser known games. They continued to support it for years after its release, with the final patch in 2014. On August 15, 2011, Illwinter announced development of Conquest of Elysium III, which was then released on February 20th, 2012.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
