In 1877, the Municipality of Newcastle followed. The latter was abolished and merged back into the road district on 27 February 1912. With the passage of the Local Government Act 1960, all road districts became shires with a president and councillors effective 1 July 1961.\nHistory\nFrom the establishment of a convict depot in Toodyay, construction and maintenance of roads along with other public works fell under the responsibility of Superintendent of Convicts. When convicts ceased being transported to Western Australia the convict depots closed, and in 1869 a Toodyay Road Committee was established. The committee was elected to enable continuation of works after the convict parties were withdrawn. The first chairman was James Drummond Jnr, other members elected were Samuel Phillips, Francis Whitfield Jnr, Charles Dempster, Frederick Roe, Lionel Lukin, John Monger Jnr, Abraham Morgan and Ewan Mackintosh. Arthur Edwardes Growse was elected to the committee in 1870, taking over as chairman; funding for the committee activities was through a government grant.\nMayors of the Municipality of Newcastle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
