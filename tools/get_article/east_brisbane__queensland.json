It is mostly residential, with some small commercial areas, and has many original Queenslander houses.\nEast Brisbane is bounded by the median of the Brisbane River to the north, Norman Park to the east, Coorparoo to the south-east, Woolloongabba to the south-west, and Kangaroo Point to the north-west. The border between Norman Park and most of Coorparoo follows Norman Creek.\nMajor roads include Lytton Road, Wellington Road, and Latrobe Street in the north, and Vulture Street and Stanley Street in the south of the suburb. The eastern side of the suburb rises to a small hill with some views over Woolloongabba and the CBD and falls away to Norman Creek.\nHistory\nIn 1851, Reverend Thomas Mowbray became among the first to buy land in East Brisbane.
