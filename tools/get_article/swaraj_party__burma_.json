Its leadership included Ba Maw, N. C. Bannerjee and Toke Gyi, who was head of the party. After his death he was succeeded by U Paw Tun.\nIn the 1925 elections the party won nine seats. In 1926 or 1927 it merged with the Nationalist Party and the Home Rule Party to form the People's Party. Following the dissolution of the People's Party in the early 1930s, most of the former Swaraj Party leadership joined the Anti-Separation League.\nReferences"
