The battle lasted from March 8 to March 13, 1918, over the city of Bakhmach and was the last engagement in World War I for the Soviets. Following a Legion victory, the Germans negotiated a truce.\nPrelude\nOn 3 March 1918, Russia, controlled by the Bolsheviks, signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany, in which it gave up control over Ukraine.\nOn 8 March, German troops reached Bakhmach, an important rail hub, and in doing so threatened the Czechoslovak Legion with encirclement. The threat was especially grave since captured legionnaires were summarily executed as traitors of Austria-Hungary because at the time Checkoslvakia was a part fo Austria. The  and  Rifle Regiments, together with the Assault battalion of Czechoslovak Army Corps of the Legion, set up defenses at the town against incoming German 91st and  Divisions.\nBattle\nThe battle was notable because the troops were not only fighting for Bakhmach railway junction (victory of Stanislav Čeček), but also for the bridge over the river Desna, which led to bloody battles at Doch. The climax of the fighting occurred on March 10. Thanks to the Legion victory, the Germans negotiated a truce, during which Czechoslovak armoured trains could freely pass through Bakhmach railway junction to Chelyabinsk.\nThe Czechoslovak Legion (about 42,000 soldiers) during the truce set up for escape from Russia via the Trans-Siberian Railway. Armies of Germany and Austria-Hungary then started to occupy the land without much resistance.\nThe Bolsheviks considered the German action at Bakhmach a violation of the terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and stood by the side of the Czechoslovak people at Bakhmach against the Germans, but it was of no significant help.\nLosses of the Legion were: 145 killed, 210 wounded, 41 missing. Estimate of German losses is around 300 dead and hundreds wounded.\nSimilarly to Battle of Zborov or the \"Siberian anabasis\", the battle of Bakhmach became one of the symbols of the Czechoslovak Legions and their fight for independence.\nReferences\nSources\n* Václav Cháb: \"Německý vpád na slovanský východ : kus dějin - kus boje o budoucnost\", Prague, 1938\n* Václav Cháb: \"Bachmač : březen 1918\",  Prague, 1948\n* Karel Goš: \"Bitva u Bachmače byla slavnou epizodou Hanáckého pluku : největší oslavy proběhly v roce 1938\", article in newspaper Olomoucký den, March 20, 1999, page 10\n* PRECLÍK, Vratislav.
