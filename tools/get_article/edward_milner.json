Henry Milner was employed at Chatsworth by William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire, as a gardener and porter.  Edward was educated at Bakewell Grammar School and was then apprenticed to Chatsworth's head gardener, Joseph Paxton.  In 1841 he continued his studies in Paris at the Jardin des Plantes and returned home to become Paxton's assistant.  He worked with Paxton in developing and managing Princes Park, Liverpool and assisted him at Osmaston Manor in Derbyshire. In 1847 he laid out the Italian Garden at Tatton Park, Cheshire, which had been designed by Paxton. When Paxton re-erected The Crystal Palace in Penge Park, Sydenham in 1852, Milner was appointed as the superintendent of works.  He also worked for Paxton in creating the People's Park, Halifax for Francis Crossley.\nIndependent career\nFrom the mid-1850s, Milner worked as an independent landscape gardener.  He received commissions for work in England and Wales, including designing three public parks in Preston, Lancashire. These parks were constructed as part of a scheme for relieving unemployment caused by the cotton famine in the 1860s. He also designed gardens in Germany and Denmark.  In 1881 he became principal of the Crystal Palace School of Gardening, established by the Crystal Palace Company.\nWorks as an independent designer\nThis is an incomplete list.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n!
