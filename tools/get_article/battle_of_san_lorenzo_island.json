He immediately put a bow to the south, bound for Valparaíso, where the government contacted him.\nThe Battle\nWhen the brigantine Águila was alone in front of the port, on February 5 the ironclad \"Yanacocha\" under the command of Miguel Balareso went out to engage the Águila. Simpson accepted the challenge and the \"Águila\" went to his enemy while the two ships exchanged cannon fire. After a lengthy cannon fire exchange, the \"Yanacocha\" returned to the port of Callao in a feigned retreat, in an attempt to lure the Águila into a position where they could not withdraw without sustaining grievous damage, to which the \"Águila\" at first moved pursue it, but soon realized the enemy strategy, and chose to withdraw.\nConsequences\nLater, despite efforts to maintain the blockade, the \"Yanacocha\" gout would manage to break it to head to the coasts of Ecuador on the Guayas River.\nAs for the brig \"Aquiles\", with the arrival of the brigantín \"Napoleón\" to Callao, his return to Chile was decided.\nOn December 8, 1836, the \"Libertad\" corvette arrived in Chile to surrender to the General Navy Command, because the crew rebelled against the Confederate authorities. This was headed by Lieutenants Leoncio Señoret, French, and Juan Manuel Uraga.\nReferences"
