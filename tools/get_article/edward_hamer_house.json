Businessman Edward Hamer had the house built for himself and his wife in 1871. The house has an Italianate design and is one of two Italianate homes in Vermont with a front-facing gable. Both of the house's gables are steep and feature decorative brackets along the cornice. The front entrance is topped by a decorative hood with braces and paired brackets. A three-sided bay window with matching brackets projects from the first floor next to the entrance; the house's remaining windows are tall, narrow, and topped by segmental arches.\nThe house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 7, 1996.\nReferences"
