Eventually, Emperor Zhongzong takes the throne, but is poisoned by his wife, Empress Wei, and his daughter, Princess Anle. Empress Wei monopolizes the new emperor, and Li Longji and Princess Taiping soon rebelled.\nMeng Fan and Meng Fu are two sisters who witnessed their father being executed. They enter the palace, and Meng Fan becomes the assistant of Wu Zetian, while Meng Fu is unhappy being a lowly servant. They witness the terrors and the fierce politics present in the imperial household. After Wu Zetian falls from power, Meng Fan falls in love with Li Longji, the grandson of Wu Zetian. She also tries to help Li Guo'er, Princess Anle, the only daughter of Emperor Zhongzong and Empress Wei. Li Guo'er is spoiled, since her other siblings Princess Yongtai and Li Chongrun were killed by Wu Zetian. However, Li Guo'er finds out her lover has been killed and she blames this incident on Meng Fan.\nOn the other hand, Meng Fu is loved by Li Chongjun, the crown prince. He vows to marry her, but she is displeased when she overhears him taking her outside of the palace. Meng Fu tells Princess Anle and Empress Wei that he's planning to rebel, and he is killed. Meng Fu also kills their child with no regret. Meng Fu becomes the assistant of Princess Anle, and her relationship with Meng Fan deteriorates. After Princess Anle and Empress Wei poison Emperor Zhongzong, they place a child puppet on the throne. Empress Dowager Wei and Princess Anle bribe Shangguan Wan'er with a lover so she can fake Emperor Zhongzong's signature. Empress Dowager Wei has intentions of being the second female emperor. The court is filled with corrupt officials.\nLi Longji is extremely displeased as the nephew of Emperor Zhongzong. Wu Zetian's daughter Princess Taiping is also secretly displeased. She teams up with Li Longji to overthrow Princess Anle and Empress Dowager Wei. They rebel, and Empress Wei is shot with an arrow.
