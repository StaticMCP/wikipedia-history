It was home to Kettering Town F.C. from 1897 until 2011.\nAt the time of its closure, the ground had a capacity of 6,264, of which 1,800 was seated.\nIn September 2017, the land was sold by the owner, Ben Pickering Limited. The site was first identified as a potential site for housing in 2005 by the local authority, and press reports indicated that the new owner was likely to use the land for a housing development.\nDuring November 2017, the entire stadium and associated structures were demolished and the site cleared for redevelopment.\nRepossession\nOn 4 August 2011, Kettering Town Club moved into Nene Park after agreeing to a long-term-lease with the landlord.\nOn 19 December 2011, the ground was repossessed by bailiffs acting on behalf of the owner, Ben Pickering. A notice on the entry to the ground read, }}\nDespite football being no longer played at the grounds, its social club was still in use by the supporters-trust and was also being used for storage of club stock which is still there.\nExternal links\n*[https://archive.today/20121015180853/http://www.btinternet.com/~portconnection/grounds/kettering.htm Kettering Town – Rockingham Road (archived)]\nReferences"
