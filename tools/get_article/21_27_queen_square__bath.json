Described by Nikolaus Pevsner as \"one of the finest Palladian compositions in England before 1730,\" it is now a Grade I listed building. Completed in 1736, the building was given listed status in 1950.\nThe building consists of seven symmetrical terraced houses, built in limestone ashlar, on the northern side of Queen Square. John Wood, the Elder, died at number 24 in 1754.\nReferences"
