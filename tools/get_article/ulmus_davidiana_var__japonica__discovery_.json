The leaves are obovate to oval, and slightly smaller than is typical of the species, their colour dark green turning yellow in autumn. The tree grows to over 15&nbsp;m in height, with a spread of much the same dimension.\nPests and diseases\nThe tree is resistant to Dutch elm disease and elm leaf beetle Xanthogaleruca luteola.\nCultivation\n'Discovery' performed very poorly in government trials [https://web.archive.org/web/20051112163528/http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/opp4055?opendocument] in Alberta, Canada, failing completely at five out of six sites. Moreover, the survivors developed a very poor branching pattern requiring pruning to strengthen crotches. 'Discovery' fared better in trials conducted by the University of Minnesota, which considered it \"quite hardy\", but the tree was criticized for its comparatively slow growth and need for continued crown thinning when young, the latter factor largely disqualifying it as a street tree. Nonetheless, a number of trees have been established in the Minneapolis Parks system. The species does not sucker from roots.\n'Discovery' is not known to have been introduced to Europe or Australasia.\nAccessions\nNorth America\n*Brenton Arboretum, Dallas Center, Iowa, US.
