The project was ultimately cancelled, though only after the demolition of the La Salle Square Public Safety Complex, which occupied the planned site.\nAs planned, the project featured a 22 story office tower with a 522 space parking garage and 496,000&nbsp;ft2 of retail space. If built, the structure would have stood as the 5th tallest in the city and state.\nAfter cancellation, the Procaccianti Group, the developer of the project, converted the site into surface parking.\nReferences"
