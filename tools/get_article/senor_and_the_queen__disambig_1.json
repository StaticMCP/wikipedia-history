It consists of 4 songs and was released in early 2008 by Sabot Productions. It was released simultaneously on vinyl, with the double-7\" white (100 copies) and double-7\" red editions (500 copies) being the most sought after.\nReception\n[http://www.punknews.org/review/7036 link]\n}}\nAbsolutepunk.net, who were very receptive to their debut album Sink or Swim welcomed the release of this EP.  \"The first half of Señor and the Queen features the standard catchy and fast Gaslight Anthem song. Things really start to get interesting when track three, \"Say I Won’t (Recognize),\" rolls around.\"  They were very impressed by the use of tempo changes in that song and equally impressed with the band's signs of musical versatility in the slow ballad \"Blue Jeans and White T-Shirts.\" Punknews.org also liked the EP, saying \"For now, Señor and the Queen should more than tide anyone over in addition to introducing the band to countless more fans. \"  They called \"Wherefore Art Thou, Elvis?\" the catchiest song on the EP and noted guitarist Alex Rosamilia's guitar skills on \"Say I Won't (Recognize).\"  Fallon's impressive songwriting also drew further comparisons to Bruce Springsteen.\nTrack listing\n| title1  = Señor and the Queen\n| length1 = 2:05\n| title2  = Wherefore Art Thou, Elvis?\n| length2 = 3:02\n| title3  = Say I Won't (Recognize)\n| length3 = 2:52\n| title4  = Blue Jeans & White T-Shirts\n| length4 = 3:28\n}}\nPersonnel\n;Band\n* Brian Fallon – lead vocals, guitar, producer\n* Alex Rosamilia – guitar, backing vocals, producer\n* Alex Levine – bass guitar, backing vocals, producer\n* Benny Horowitz – drums, percussion, backing vocals, producer\n;Additional vocalists\n* Jet Mullen – additional vocals on \"Blue Jeans & White T-Shirts\"\n;Production\n* Mike Vasquez – recording engineer, assistant producer\n* Che Arthur – assistant producer\n* Derron Nuhfer – audio mastering\n* Jesse Menn – band photo\n* Kenny Colvin – design\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.punknews.org/review/7036 punknews.org review]\n*[https://music.sobriquetmagazine.com/2008/05/gaslight-anthem-seor-and-queen-ep.html Sobriquet Magazine review of the EP]\n*[http://www.aversion.com/bands/reviews.cfm?f_id=3507 Aversion.com review of the EP]"
