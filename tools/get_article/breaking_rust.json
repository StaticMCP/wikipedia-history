The act gained prominence with the release of the Resilient EP in October 2025, featuring singles such as \"Walk My Walk\" and \"Livin' on Borrowed Time\". \"Walk My Walk\" topped the Billboard Country Digital Song Sales chart, the first AI-generated country song to do so. Breaking Rust has amassed over 35,000 followers on Instagram, where the character is presented with a cowboy persona.\nBackground and creation\nBreaking Rust was developed using generative artificial intelligence tools to produce vocals, instrumentation, and lyrics, with no human performers involved. The project is credited to Aubierre Rivaldo Taylor, an obscure figure with limited online presence prior to the act's launch. Taylor previously created music under the alias Defbeatsai, focusing on explicit, AI-generated country tracks in the style of Wheeler Walker Jr.\nThe act's persona is represented through AI-generated imagery, depicting a rugged cowboy in dystopian settings. No registrations for Breaking Rust or Taylor appear in performing rights organizations BMI and ASCAP.\nMusic and discography\nThe act's debut release, the Resilient EP, was issued in October 2025 and includes eight tracks available on platforms Spotify and Apple Music. Notable singles include:\n* \"Walk My Walk\" (2025)\n* \"Livin' on Borrowed Time\" (2025)\n* \"Whiskey Don't Talk Back\" (2025)\n* \"Kicking Back at the Ground\" (2025)\n* \"Love Don't Live Here\" (2025)\n* \"Time Don't Stop\" (2025)\n* \"The One's You Trust\" (2025)\nChart performance\nBreaking Rust debuted at No. 9 on the Billboard Emerging Artists chart dated November 1, 2025, driven by \"Walk My Walk\" and \"Livin' on Borrowed Time\". \"Walk My Walk\" reached No. 1 on the Country Digital Song Sales chart with approximately 3,000 units sold.\nBillboard has stated that in recent months, at least six AI artists have made it into Billboard rankings.\nReception\nAaron Ryan of Whiskey Riff noted the track's appeal, describing it as \"groovy\" and reminiscent of classic country, yet expressed concern over its synthetic origins. In a separate NPR interview, Ryan argued that AI erodes the genre's emphasis on authenticity, drawing parallels to the backlash against Randy Travis's AI-assisted vocal release in 2024. Public discourse on social media has amplified the controversy, with fans unaware of the AI aspect until media coverage.\nSee also\n* Tilly Norwood, an AI-generated actress\n* Xania Monet, an AI-generated gospel and R&B singer\nReferences"
