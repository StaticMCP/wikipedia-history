It was published under the Dragonlance brand name and is set in that brand's fictional world of Krynn.  It is the ninth Dragonlance novel to be published, and the third book in the \"Dragonlance Tales\" series, all three books of which are anthologies of stories set in the Dragonlance milieu.  The other two books in this series are The Magic of Krynn and Kender, Gully Dwarves, and Gnomes.  Unlike the Dragonlance novels published up until that point, the Tales books do not exclusively follow one group of characters, but instead range across the entire scope of the setting.\nPlot introduction\nThe book is a compilation of 10 short stories from various authors taking place in the fictional world of Krynn:\n# \"A Good Knight's Tale\" by Harold Bakst.
