All contemporary 38 states were part of the 1888 United States presidential election. Florida voters chose four electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.\nFlorida was won by the Democratic nominees, incumbent President Grover Cleveland of New York and his running mate Allen G. Thurman of Ohio.\nThis was the last election until 2020 that Florida increased its margin to an incumbent who lost re-election nationally.\nThis was also the only time Florida voted for a Democrat who won the popular vote but lost the presidential election. In 1876, 2000, and 2016, Florida voted for a Republican who lost the popular vote but won the Electoral College.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | United States presidential election in Florida, 1888\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic\n| Grover Cleveland (incumbent)\n| align=\"right\" | 39,557\n| align=\"right\" | 59.48%\n| align=\"right\" | 4\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#FF3333; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Republican\n| Benjamin Harrison\n| align=\"right\" | 26,529\n| align=\"right\" | 39.89%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#f09; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Prohibition\n| Clinton Fisk\n| align=\"right\" | 414\n| align=\"right\" | 0.62%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Totals\n| align=\"right\" | 66,500\n| align=\"right\" | 100.00%\n| align=\"right\" | 4\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Voter turnout\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" |\n| align=\"right\" | —\n|}\nReferences\nNotes"
