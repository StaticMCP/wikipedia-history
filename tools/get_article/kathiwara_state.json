The princely state acceded to India in 1947. Upon accession to the Indian Union, it was absorbed into the province of Madhya Bharat.\nHistory\nThe state's origins can be traced back to 1434, however, information about the country is scarce. The rulers carried the title Thakur; they were paid 4,000 rupees in revenue and 32,000 rupees as privy purse. It was ruled by the Jadon dynasty. Its last ruler, Onkar Sinh(ji) acceded the state to India in 1947.\nPost-independence\nAfter independence, it was merged into the province of Madhya Bharat, and was located right on the border with Bombay State. In 1993, Melange was founded as a clothing and fashion shop in Mumbai by Sangita Kathiwada, the wife of Rana Saheb Jayendra Sinh. This was closely followed by other projects, such as the Kathiwada Raaj Mahal (a hunting lodge commissioned by Onkar Sinh in 1895 and refurbished in 2007), the Kathiwada Arts, Circle 1434, and Kathiwada City House. The organizations remain a tourist and local attraction.\nList of Rulers\nThis is a list of the known rulers of Kathiwada.
