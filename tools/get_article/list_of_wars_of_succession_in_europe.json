Later Christian sources emphasise Stephen's Christianity as an argument for his legitimacy, claim that Koppány was a pagan and that agnatic seniority was a 'pagan' custom as opposed to the 'Christian' custom of primogeniture, and that therefore Koppány 'rebelled' against the legitimate Christian king Stephen, but the reliability and impartiality of these sources is disputed.\n11th century\nmanaged to enforce his claim to the English throne.]]\n* Bohemian war of succession (999–1012), after the death of duke Boleslaus II \"the Pious\" of Bohemia between his three sons Boleslaus III, Jaromír, and Oldřich.\n** German–Polish War (1003–1018), erupted due to clashing interventions of Polish duke Bolesław I the Brave and German king (from 1014 emperor) Henry II in the Bohemian war of succession.\n* German war of succession (January–October 1002), after the death of Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor.

Edward would claim that his role in appointing the new king of Scots, John Balliol, meant that he was now Scotland's overlord, and started to interfere in Scottish domestic affairs, causing dissent.\n** First War of Scottish Independence (1296–1328), after Scottish opposition to Edward's interference reached the point of rebellion, Edward marched against Scotland, defeating and imprisoning John Balliol, stripping him off the kingship, and effectively annexing Scotland. However, William Wallace and Andrew Moray rose up against Edward and assumed the title of \"guardians of Scotland\" on behalf of John Balliol, passing this title on to Robert the Bruce (one of the claimants during the Great Cause) and John Comyn in 1298. The former killed the latter in 1306, and was crowned king of Scots shortly after, in opposition to both Edward and the still imprisoned John Balliol.\n** Second War of Scottish Independence, or Anglo-Scottish War of Succession (1332–1357), after the death of king of Scots Robert the Bruce\n* Árpád war of succession (1301–1308), after the death of king Andrew III of Hungary and the extinction of the Árpád dynasty\n* Polish-Bohemian war (1305–1308), after the death of king Wenceslaus II of Bohemia and Poland\n*  (1319/1320–1323), after the death of Waldemar, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal.

Some scholars posit the war's start as having begun with Joanna's death in 1435, and name it the 'Aragonese–Neapolitan War'.\n* (contested) Hussite Wars (1419–1434): some scholars claim that the death of king Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia on 19 August 1419 is the event that sparked the Hussite rebellion against his nominal successor Sigismund (king of Germany, Hungary and Croatia). In 1420, Hussites offered the Bohemian crown to Władysław II Jagiełło instead. Nolan (2006) summarised the Hussites' motives as 'doctrinal as well as \"nationalistic\" and constitutional', and provided a series of causes: the trial and execution of Jan Hus (1415) 'provoked the conflict', the Defenestration of Prague (30 July 1419) 'began the conflict', while 'fighting began after King Wenceslaus died, shortly after the defenestration' (after 19 August 1419). Nolan described the wars' goals and character as follows: 'The main aim of the Hussites was to prevent the hated Sigismund mounting the throne of Bohemia, but fighting between Bohemian Hussites and Catholics spread into Moravia. (...) cross-class support gave the Hussite Wars a tripartite and even \"national\" character unusual for the age, and a religious and social unity of purpose, faith, and hate'. Winkler Prins/Encarta (2002) described the Hussites as a 'movement which developed from a religious denomination to a nationalist faction, opposed to German and Papal influence; in the bloody Hussite Wars (1419–1438), they managed to resist.' It didn't mention the succession of Wenceslaus by Sigismund, but noted elsewhere that it was Sigismund's policy of Catholic Church unity which prompted him to urge Antipope John XXIII to convene the Council of Constance in 1414, which ultimately condemned Jan Hus.\n* Muscovite War of Succession, or Muscovite Civil War (1425–1453), after the death of grand prince Vasily I of Muscovy\n* Lithuanian Civil War (1432–38), after the death of grand duke Vytautas the Great of Lithuania\n* Polish–Bohemian war (1437–143?), after the death of king Sigismund of Bohemia. He was supposed to be succeeded by Albert II of Germany, but in 1438, the Czech anti-Habsburg opposition, mainly Hussite factions, offered the Czech crown to Polish king Jagiełło II's younger son Casimir instead.

The Transylvanian Diet declared war on his designated successor Maximilian II, but an Imperial army commanded by Lazarus von Schwendi invaded Transylvania and reached the river Szamos in March 1565, forcing John Sigismund Zápolya to conclude the Treaty of Szatmár (13 March 1565). In it, he renounced his title of king of Hungary in return for the recognition of his hereditary rule as prince of Transylvania under the Habsburg kings of Hungary, as well as agreeing to marry Maximilian's sister Joanna.
