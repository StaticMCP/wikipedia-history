Founded in 2005 by Todd Cochrane of Podcast Connect Inc., the Podcast Awards changed hands for a short period by New Media Expo in September 2014 until New Media Expo's demise. The first Podcast Awards show was held in 2006 (awarding shows for the 2005 calendar year) had over 350,000 people vote for their nominated podcasts, with nearly 1000 people attending the awards ceremony. The 10th annual Podcast Awards Show, the first show run exclusively by the New Media Expo, took place at Westgate Las Vegas Resort and Casino on April 14, 2015. It was hosted by Chris Jericho and Emily Morse. The 12th Annual event started with a complete site rebuild and change to the overall process.\nRules\nThe nominations begin on a set date (July 1, 2017 for the 2017 awards) and continue for thirty days. Listeners can nominate shows from 20 categories over the 30 day period once a day.  Podcasts have had to pre-register in order to participate and listeners are allowed to select the shows they want to nominate from within the pre-registered list of shows.\nAfter the thirty days of nominations, Podcast Connect Committee will review all the nominations over a 15 day period and a slate announced.\nOnce up to ten nominees in each category have been established, the final voting slate is released. Voting in this round are selected by a panel of judges as outlined in the podcast awards rule.\nCategories and winners\nThe Podcast Awards consists of twenty-two categories. Winners are announced during a ceremony which includes a live web stream. The prizes awarded to winners are donation/sponsor-driven via PayPal. In 2009, they were able to award podcasters almost $3,500 in prizes, with additional website exposure through 2009–2010 of seventeen million plus hits.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!Categories\n!2005\n!2006\n!2007\n!2008\n!2009\n!2010\n!2011\n!2012\n!2013\n!2015†\n|-\n!People's Choice\n|This Week in Tech\n|MuggleCast\n|Keith and The Girl\n|Manager Tools\n|ESPN: Fantasy Focus Football\n|''Tell 'Em Steve Dave!\n|4Player Podcast\n|ESPN: Fantasy Focus Football\n|The Morning Stream\n|Rob Has a Podcast\n|-\n!Best Produced\n|Daily Source Code\n|The Signal\n|Firefly Talk\n|Totally Rad Show\n|Best of the Left\n|Radiolab\n|Inside the Magic\n|Best of the Left\n|Rob Has a Podcast\n|Radiolab\n|-\n!Best Video Podcast\n|\n|\n|Ask a Ninja\n|Geek Brief TV\n|This Week in Tech\n|TED\n|This Week In Tech\n|The Young Turks\n|Rob Has a Podcast\n|Night Attack\n|-\n!Best Mobile Podcast\n|\n|Catholic Insider\n|Xbox 360\n|DL.TV\n|AppSlappy\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!Arts\n|\n|Geek Nights with Rym and Scott\n|This American Life\n|This American Life\n|Imprint\n|Decoder Ring Theatre\n|This American Life\n|The Moth\n|This American Life\n|This American Life\n|-\n!Business\n|Media Artist Secrets\n|Manager Tools\n|Manager Tools\n|Manager Tools\n|Planet Money\n|Career Tools\n|Planet Money\n|Manager Tools\n|NPR: Planet Money Podcast\n|Freakonomics Radio\n|-\n!Comedy\n|Distorted View Daily\n|Distorted View Daily\n|Nobody Likes Onions\n|You Look Nice Today\n|Daily Giz Wiz\n|Tell 'Em Steve-Dave!\n|WTF with Marc Maron\n|WTF with Marc Maron\n|The Morning Stream\n|The Morning Stream\n|-\n!Education\n|Tips from the Top Floor\n|Tips from the Top Floor\n|Grammar Girl\n|Grammar Girl\n|The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe\n|The History of Rome\n|Stuff You Missed in History\n|Grammar Girl\n|Grammar Girl\n|Hardcore History\n|-\n!Entertainment\n|\n|Pottercast\n|The Lost Podcast with Jay and Jack\n|MuggleCast\n|MuggleCast\n|The Fringe Podcast\n|The Morning Stream\n|Rob Has a Podcast\n|Walking Dead 'Cast\n|Rob Has a Podcast\n|-\n!Food and Drink\n|Good Beer Show\n|Good Beer Show\n|CoffeeGeek\n|Grace before meals\n|Munchcast\n|BeerDownload\n|The Splendid Table\n|The Beerists\n|The Beerists\n|The Alton Browncast\n|-\n!Games & Hobbies\n|Orange Lounge Radio\n|Podtacular\n|CAGcast\n|The Instance\n|4Player Podcast\n|4Player Podcast\n|4Player Podcast\n|Rooster Teeth Podcast\n|Rooster Teeth Podcast\n|The Instance\n|-\n!General\n|illinoise!\n|Rosary Army\n|ShowGirls\n|Extralife Radio\n|This American Life\n|The Survival Podcast\n|Greetings From Nowhere\n|Internet Box\n|Internet Box\n|Internet Box\n|-\n!LGBTQ\n|\n|Feast of Fools\n|Feast of Fools\n|Feast of Fools\n|Feast of Fun\n|Savage Love\n|Feast of Fun\n|Throwing Shade\n|Throwing Shade\n|Psychobabble / Throwing Shade\n|-\n!Health\n|MARINA's Walking & Aerobics\"\n|Sex is Fun!\n|Sex is Fun!\n|Healthy Catholic\n|QuackCast\n|QuackCast\n|QuackCast\n|The Mental Illness Happy Hour\n|The Fat Burning Man\n|The Dr. Drew Podcast\n|-\n!Mature\n|Dawn and Drew Show\n|Dawn and Drew Show\n|Keith and the Girl\n|Distorted View Daily\n|Adam Carolla Podcast\n|WTF with Marc Maron\n|SModcast\n|Savage Lovecast\n|Savage Lovecast\n|Night Attack\n|-\n!Music\n|\n|Accident Hash\n|Catholic Rockers\n|Catholic Rockers\n|Irish Celtic Music Podcast\n|Irish & Celtic Music Podcast\n|Coverville\n|Coverville\n|Coverville\n|Coverville\n|-\n!News & Politics\n|Free Talk Live\n|Free Talk Live\n|Free Talk Live\n|Free Talk Live\n|The Young Turks\n|Free Talk Live\n|The Majority Report\n|The Majority Report\n|The Majority Report\n|The Majority Report\n|-\n!Religion & Spirituality\n|Catholic Insider\n|Daily Breakfast\n|Daily Breakfast\n|Daily Breakfast\n|Reasonable Doubts\n|Atheist News Podcast\n|Mormon FAIR-Cast\n|Ardent Atheist with Emery Emery\n|Mormon FAIR-Cast\n|The Scathing Atheist\n|-\n!Science & Medicine*\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe\n|The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe\n|The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe\n|Radiolab\n|The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe\n|-\n!Sports & Recreation\n|1954 and Counting\n|Fantoo Girls\n|Phedippidations\n|SkyDiverGirlsTv\n|ESPN: Fantasy Focus Football\n|The B.S.

For example, the 2014 awards ceremony took place on April 14, 2015.\nOne-time awards\n*2005 – Music/Radio: Coverville\n*2005 – Nonenglish: Annik Rubens: Schlaflos in München\n*2005 – Top Rated: Slice of SciFi\n*2005 – World News: Kathleen Keating\n*2006 – Best Podcast directory: Apple iTunes''\nCriticism\nSome critics have complained that the Podcast Awards lack publicity, which results in the same podcasts winning awards every year. While some podcasters are aware of the awards and mobilize their listeners to vote, many do not realize they exist.\nIn response to criticism, the Podcast Awards implemented various changes over the years including stricter entry requirements, category revisions, and technical improvements. Despite ongoing debates, it remains one of the longest-running podcast-specific awards globally and helped spotlight early independent podcasters during a formative era of the medium.\nSee also\n*List of web awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.podcastawards.com/ Podcast Awards website]\n* [http://www.podcastconnect.com/ Podcast Connect Inc.]\n* [http://www.podcastconnect.com/archive/podcast_awards/ Podcast Connect archive of the Podcast Awards]"
