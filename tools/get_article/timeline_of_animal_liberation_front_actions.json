      "text": "# Timeline of Animal Liberation Front actions\n\nThis timeline of Animal Liberation Front (ALF) actions describes the history, consequences and theory of direct action on behalf of animals by animal liberation activists using, or associated with the ALF.\nFrom the ALF's formation in 1976 to the present day the direct actions have included two distinct categories of tactics, with activists often using both tactics together;\n*The removal of animals from laboratories, and/or releasing them from fur farms, and other animal-based industries.\n*The sabotage of animal-based industries, such as; slaughterhouses, butchers, farms, circuses, greyhound stadiums, and pet shops, or businesses involved in (or with) animal testing organizations, using tactics such as; vandalism, arson, intimidation, incendiary devices and hoax bombs.\n1970s\n;1976\n* Two years after Ronnie Lee and Cliff Goodman had been charged for the raid on the Oxford Laboratory Animal Colonies in Bicester, as part of the Band of Mercy, the \"Bicester Two\" as they were known; Lee emerged even more militant than before. There had been daily demonstrations at the court during their trial, including Lee's local Labour MP Ivor Clemitson. He then collected up the remaining activists from the Band of Mercy upon his release, including another two dozen new willing activists, 30 in all, and the Animal Liberation Front was born.\n* It was reported that in early operations by the ALF, individuals targeted slaughterhouses, furriers, butchers shops, circuses, breeders and fast-food restaurants, causing £250,000 in the first year alone.\n*First recorded fur farm raid, with 1,000 foxes released from Dalchonzie fur farm in Scotland.\n;1977\n*After the ALF cause $80,000 damage at Condiltox Laboratories, in London, England, the company closes. It is claimed as a victory for direct action by the ALF.\n;1977\n*One of the first ALF actions in Netherlands is reported, with activists removing hens from an intensive farming unit in Eindoven.\n;1979\n*A cat, two dogs, and two guinea pigs, are taken from New York University Medical Center, the first ALF raid in the United States.\n1980s\n1981\n;September\nIn Monkey Business, by Kathy Snow Guillermo, she writes that the first ALF action in the United States was the removal of the so-called Silver Spring monkeys, who were being cared for by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) in a safehouse. They were kept there are after a researcher from the Institute of Behavioral Research in Silver Spring, Maryland, had blatantly acted in violation of the animal cruelty legislation for laboratory practice. The animals were then returned five days later, after learning that legal action against the researcher could not proceed without the monkeys.\n1982\n;24 December\nThe president of PETA, Ingrid Newkirk, writes that an activist codenamed \"Valerie\" flew to England, after the publicity triggered by the Silver Spring monkeys case. She was directed by Ronnie Lee to a training camp for activists, who at the time was working for the BUAV, before returning to Maryland and breaking into Howard University. Twenty-four cats were removed by the ALF cell she had founded, with some of the cats suffering from back legs that were crippled.\n1984\n;28 May\nThe Head Injury Lab of the University of Pennsylvania is raided by the ALF with $60,000 worth of damage caused, and 60 hours worth of video tapes stolen which shows researchers laughing and joking as they cause brain damage to baboons.

Anti-fur activists denounced the action as \"a disaster for the [anti-fur] campaign, and it's a disaster for the mink\". The action was described by a Royal Society for the Protection of Birds spokesman as an \"act of monumental stupidity,\" amid fears that the non-native carnivorous minks would cause ecological damage.

He was later arrested by detectives at his home whilst cleaning his car and the mice were returned to the laboratory. He argued that the tests were illegal because the product was being tested for cosmetic purposes, which is banned in Britain. The Southern Animal Rights Coalition also received paperwork which they say demonstrates cosmetic Botox was being tested on animals.

These groups have been harassing researchers all over the world,\"  she continued \"It has reached terrorist level. The university is very disturbed by this.\" The ALF in a communique to the North American Animal Liberation Press Office the following month replied: \"If the primates could escape from their cages they would do this to Lynn Fairbanks and worse.

The tests are to simulate under water pressure, to attempt to research the symptoms and possible cures of decompression sickness and to study deep-sea rescue. Southern Animal Rights Coalition then campaigned to end the experiments. According to the group, the animals were tested in order to simulate under water pressure and were suspended in March with a committee of experts looking into alternative research models, such as computer-modelling and safe human trials, in an attempt to simulate the effects of decompression sickness, or 'the bends', caused by ascending too quickly.
