Two days later, on March 14, the National Guard from Fontenay-le-Comte attempted to challenge their control but was ambushed and routed without a fight, suffering 25 to 30 fatalities before retreating to Sainte-Hermine. During this clash, Laparra, secretary of the Vendée department’s directory, was captured and executed by firing squad.\nOn March 15, the insurgents attacked Chantonnay, capturing the town after a combat with 200 National Guardsmen from Fontenay. They then withdrew slightly north to Saint-Vincent-Sterlanges.\nOn March 16, Republican general Louis Henri François de Marcé arrived at Sainte-Hermine from La Rochelle, commanding a force of 1,200 to 1,300 men and seven cannons. He swiftly moved to secure the Pont-Charron bridge over the Grand Lay, south of Chantonnay, to prevent its destruction by the insurgents.\nBattle\nOn March 17, the Republicans advanced toward Chantonnay. Marcé positioned a reserve force at Pont-Charron and led a vanguard of 500 men and two cannons, accompanied by Colonel Henri François Maurille de Boulard and representative Joseph Niou. The insurgents launched an attack, and a six-hour battle ensued between Chantonnay and Saint-Vincent-Sterlanges under nearly continuous rain. The Republicans secured an easy victory with their artillery overwhelming the exposed peasant insurgents on the open plain. The defeated Vendeans retreated to their camp at L'Oie.\nMarcé remained in Chantonnay, where he received 1,000 reinforcements, and declared his intent to march on Nantes.\nCasualties\nThe following day, Representative Joseph Niou reported the victory to the National Convention, praising the \"valor of our brothers-in-arms and the capable leadership.\" He claimed the rebels left over 100 of their dead on the field. However, in a report to the Minister of War, General Marcé described the insurgent losses as \"considerable\" in both dead and wounded, including the capture of their three small cannons. A dispatch from Fontenay-le-Comte administrators estimated 40 rebel deaths, a figure corroborated by historians Émile Gabory and Roger Dupuy. Alongside the cannons, the insurgents lost 1,200 bread rations and 1,200 cartridges.\nRepublican casualties were minimal, with Niou and Marcé reporting only three wounded: two officers and a cavalryman. The officers, described as \"very lightly\" injured, were Lieutenant-Colonel Laborie and Captain of Gendarmerie Garnier.\nNotes\nSee also\n* War in the Vendée\n* French First Republic\n* French Revolution\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
