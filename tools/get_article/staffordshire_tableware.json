Coloroll went into receivership in 1990 and the ceramics division was subject to a management buyout, being renamed Staffordshire Tableware Ltd.\nStaffordshire Tableware itself went into receivership on 29 December 2000. Part of the former site is now a B&Q store, with the rest of the land awaiting redevelopment.\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090219000537/http://www.stoke.gov.uk/ccm/museums/museum/2006/collections/ceramics/information-sheets/staffordshire-tableware.en Key dates and historical information about Staffordshire Tableware] from [http://www.stokemuseums.org.uk/ Stoke-on-Trent Museums]"
