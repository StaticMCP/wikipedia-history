The comic's world features recurring characters, for example, Slutty Witch, a standalone witch character who counterposes obtrusive suitors, often with black magic.\nAt an on-stage interview, Pich condemns nihilism despite the dark humor of War and Peas and says that she believes in activism.  In the same interview, Kunz adds that he would not describe the comics as cynical: “There's a lot of irony in it and there's definitely a lot of dark humor in it. But we ourselves are pretty hopeful for the future. [...] Often the ending is dark, but our characters survive and they're getting better over time.”\nPublishing\nPich and Kunz met at School of Fine Arts in Saarbrücken, Germany. After experimenting with illustrative forms, they found the comic format ideal for their type of storytelling and began to develop the weekly webcomic.\nSince 2011, Pich and Kunz have posted once weekly every Sunday to their website and several social media platforms including Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. They alternate with drawing but usually write together. Starting 2017, they also release their strips on the publishing platform Line Webtoon. Several online and print magazines feature War and Peas comics on a regular basis, including the Italian magazine Internazionale, releasing new strips every week since 2018. War and Peas has been published in several anthologies, such as Launch Party or Block Party – both edited by David Daneman – along with other webcomics, such as Mr. Lovenstein by J.L. Westover, Deathbulge by Dan Martin and Safely Endangered by Chris McCoy.\nAfter Nick Seluk introduced the duo to his publisher, their first book, War and Peas: Funny Comics for Dirty Lovers was released by Andrews McMeel Publishing on March 3, 2020. On July 23, the German translation was published by Panini Comics. On November 5, it was followed by the Spanish translation, published by RBA Libros. On May 6, 2021 the French translation, published by First Éditions, followed. In 2023 it was translated in Italian and published by Edizioni BD.\nIn 2021, the collaboration with the Rewriting Extinction campaign began. As part of this, Pich and Kunz worked with Richard Curtis and created a comic that was subsequently published in the comic anthology The Most Important Comic Book on Earth: Stories to Save the World by DK. The book consisted of stories created through the collaboration of various comic artists with celebrities and environmental activists, including Jane Goodall, Ricky Gervais and Cara Delevigne. Since then, Pich and Kunz have been regularly publishing comic strips about current environmental issues associated with Rewriting Extinction on their website and social media channels.\nSince 2023, they also release their strips on the publishing platform Tapas.\nOn October 20, 2023 a new strip collection \"Salut la terre\" was published in French by Les Requins Marteaux and was highly praised by critics and readers. The book was nominated for a prix Tournesol at the Angoulême International Comics Festival 2024.\nOn April 2, 2024 the book \"Once Upon a Workday\" was released by Andrews McMeel Publishing again. The book contains several short stories that are very different from the usual comic strips by War and Peas. Told in rhyme, the stories are dedicated to the problems of everyday working life, but also to creativity and mental health. \"It reminds me that I don’t walk alone with the hardness of life, and shares some feelings I’ve had about my own life and work life.\" wrote book blog The Book of Meghan. Jay Snook from The Good Men Project wrote \"Each section was clever and tried to put a playful spin on a different task. Some of them reminded me almost of Dr. Seuss and appeared to be drawn in a similar style. As this book came to a close I was happy to have some nice laughs.\"\nSeveral fan accounts on social media are dedicated to translating the comic strips to various languages, such as French, Spanish and Russian.\nBibliography\n* War and Peas – Funny Comics for Dirty Lovers (2020, Andrews McMeel Publishing)\n* Once Upon a Workday (2024, Andrews McMeel Publishing)\n* Hi, Earth (2025, Andrews McMeel Publishing)\nReception\nReadership figures\n, Instagram reported that War and Peas had 1.1 million followers on that service.
