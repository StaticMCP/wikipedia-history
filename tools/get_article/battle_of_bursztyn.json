After that, the unregistered Cossacks elected Taras Fedorovych as their hetman, while the registered ones elected Hrytsko Chornyi, who had pursued a Pro-Polish policy of Petro Sahaidachny among the Cossacks. In June of 1629, the Cossacks attempted to re-install Mehmed III Giray on the Crimean throne, however their expedition failed and Mehmed Giray was killed, while his brother Shahin Giray fled to Persia. Two months later, in August, a large Crimean army led by kalga Devlet-Giray, Aslan-Giray (more known as İslâm III Giray) and Khan Temir invaded the Commonwealth. The Tatars devastated Galicia and Belz land. Once finding out about being pursued by the Polish-Cossack army, Devlet Giray paused the raid and started returning to Crimea with the captured loot and slaves.\nBattle\nDue to the main forces withdrawing from Poland, the Allies were now to fight the remnants of the Tatar army. The Tatar unit, which was attacked during the battle, had build up a camp near the village of Koniushky after being assured by a Cossack captive that there are no Polish units nearby. On the night of 9 October, the Polish-Cossack army of Chmielecki crossed the Gnila Lipa river and stood up near the Tatar camp. On the morning, when the Tatars were about to retreat, the Poles unexpectedly attacked their camp and inflicted heavy casualties on them. The Tatars began to retreat, being chased by the Poles for approximately 3 miles. Many of them were killed while crossing the Uście on the Dniester.\nAftermath\nThe Tatars suffered a heavy defeat. In total, during the entire expedition, the Tatars lost about 8,000 people. The victors liberated all 10 thousand Christian captives, including several noble ladies, and captured over 2 thousand Tatars. Month later, another Tatar unit was humiliated by Stanisław Lubomirski near Uście. In 1630, the Polish government sent an envoy Aleksandr Piaseczyński in order to avoid the potential war with the Ottoman Empire. The future Crimean khan, Aslan-Giray, was held captive in Poland until he was freed in exchange for the several Polish noblemans.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
