It was filmed at the Wacken Open Air festival on 1 August 2015 in front of a capacity of 85,000 people. A CD version was also released bundled with the DVD version as well. Both DVD and Blu-ray formats contain three bonus tracks recorded from their 10 December 2015 show at the Ergo Arena in Gdańsk, Poland.\nReception\nChad Bowar of Loudwire stated \"Priest have released a plethora of live albums over the years, and Battle Cry is a worthy addition to that canon. It effectively captures this era of the band, who have aged extremely gracefully and show no signs of slowing down any time soon.\"\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Rob Halford, Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing, except where indicated.\nCharts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|Swedish Albums Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|Finnish Albums Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|Canadian Albums Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|US Billboard Music DVD Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|Australian Albums Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|-\n|German Albums Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|-\n|Dutch Albums Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|-\n|French Albums Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|-\n|Belgian Albums Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n|-\n|Spanish Albums Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n|-\n|Austrian Albums Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|7\n|}\nPersonnel\n*Rob Halford – Vocals\n*Glenn Tipton – Guitar, Vocals\n*Richie Faulkner – Guitar, Vocals\n*Ian Hill – Bass\n*Scott Travis – Drums\nReferences"
