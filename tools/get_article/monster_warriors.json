It was created by Wilson Coneybeare and produced by Coneybeare Stories and distributed by Bejuba! Entertainment. The series concluded its run on July 26, 2008, with a TV movie titled Monster Warriors Finale on YTV.\nPlot\nSeason 1\nThe series, a purposely campy cross between the Power Rangers, Scooby-Doo and Ghostbusters, follows the adventures of four teenagers fighting to safeguard Capital City from the vengeful wrath of insane and disgruntled old B-Movie director Klaus Von Steinhauer who possesses the ability to bring his cinematic monsters to life (\"I make ze monsters big!\"). Over the course of the series, various story arcs occur that expand the series' cast and city locations. Each week sees the teens customize common household objects into useful weapons to fight against monstrous creations.\nSeason 2\nThe battle continues as the Monster Warriors work from their new hideout: a deserted secret bomb shelter beneath Luke's house. The newly outfitted warriors get caught in the battle between Von Steinhauer and the new Mystery Monster Maker. The new monsters are half animal, half machine.\nCharacters\nCore characters\n* Luke\nLuke is the reserved yet tough leader of the Warriors. He is rich, tall and handsome and holds the keys to the group's sweet purple convertible and their headquarters at his home. He is Tabby's love interest. Although he acts tough most of the time, he still has certain fears, particularly of forests. His family fortune comes from his environmental activist parents' invention of coin deposit locks on shopping carts He is like a combination of Fred Jones, Peter Venkman, and Tommy Oliver.\n* Antonio\nAntonio is the darkly handsome scientific genius of the gang. As a recent immigrant to Capital City, he devoted his considerable intellectual abilities to learning to speak English without any trace of a foreign accent, and he has a vast knowledge of fields like zoology, astronomy, geology and history. Although he is shy and kind of nerdy, he still has many female admirers He is a combination of Shaggy Rogers, Egon Spengler, and Rocky DeSantos.\n* Tabby\nThis blond 17-year-old fancies herself the second in command of the group and is Luke's love interest. She is an ace inventor who can turn ordinary household gadgets into monster-blasting weaponry. She is also the captain of the volleyball team and school class president and is an all-around goody two-shoes- although she doesn't like being called one. She is a combination of Velma Dinkley, Janine Melnitz, and Trini Kwan.\n* Vanka\nShe is the bravest of the Warriors and a dedicated practitioner of obscure martial arts. Tough, fierce and virtually fearless, the athletic brunette is, however, particularly uncomfortable with heights, has failed her driving test multiple times and has had a string of hopeless boyfriends. She later develops a relationship with Antonio. She is a combination of Daphne Blake, Kylie Griffin, and Kimberly Ann Hart.\nOther recurring characters\n* Klaus Von Steinhauer - Monster movie director turned mad monster-maker He is an evil version of Gozer, and Lord Zedd.\n* Missy Gore - Perky, narcoleptic city power company worker turned villainous sidekick (Season 1).
