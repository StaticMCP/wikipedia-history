Each of its four sides has a clock, with Roman numerals representing hours and dots depicting the minutes. The structure marks a good location from which to watch the evening prayers at Har Ki Pauri.\nThe surrounding area has been used as a media platform for the Kumbh Mela. Prior to the 2021 Kumbh Mela artist Harshvardhan Kadam painted it in red and gold murals to express Hindu mythological stories based on the writings and ideas of the Vaimﾄ］ika Shﾄ《tra.\nHistory\nThe Clock Tower of Haridwar, India. also known as the Raja Birla Tower and Ghantaghar, was built by Raja Baldev Das Birla, the founder of the Birla Group, in 1938. Many clock towers were built in India before it was common to own a watch. The tower daily evening Hindu prayers at Har Ki Pauri are easily seen from the tower. In 2010 a platform was constructed close to the tower from which nearly 300 media personnel watched the main bathing day of the Kumbh Mela that year.\nThe tower is on Malviya Island, named after Madan Mohan Malaviya, opposite the steps of Har Ki Pauri in Haridwar. The structure is freestanding and  high. It has four sides, each with a clock face, that use Roman numerals to represent the hours and dots to depict the minutes. The surrounding island has marble flooring, is shaped like a boat, and has its own ghat (steps) to enter the river Ganges. Until 1979 it was connected to other local bathing spots by three bridges.\nPrior to the 2021 Kumbh Mela, the artist Harshvardhan Kadam painted the tower with red and gold murals to express mythological stories based on the work and ideas of the Vaimﾄ］ika Shﾄ《tra. The work was part of the Haridwar Mural Project, in collaboration with the Namami Gange Programme and art retailer Mojarto: a venture to find non-traditional platforms to display religious art in Haridwar and to safeguard the river Ganges.\nGallery\nFile:Ganga Dashara Festival, 2005 at Har ki Pauri, Haridwar.jpg|Clock tower (2005)\nFile:Har Ki Pauri l Haridwar.jpg|Clock Tower (unpainted) view from Har Ki Pauri (2010)\nFile:Rishikesh haRishikeshridwar (595).JPG|Clock face (2012)\nFile:Har Ki Pauri Haridwar.jpg|Clock Tower during evening prayers (2013)\nFile:Har ki paiddi, Haridwar.jpg|Clock Tower during evening prayers (2021 Kumbh Mela)\nFile:Har Ki Pauri and Clock Tower of Haridwar.jpg|Clock Tower (2023)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* Transforming 66 Ft Tall Clock Tower With Art - Mojarto Blogs |url=https://blog.mojarto.com/ep-5-haridwar-mural-project-transforming-66-ft-tall-clock-tower-with-art/ |date=26 June 2019}}"
