During the 1950s he rotated through several medical and surgical specialties including urology with Sir Eric Riches and Sir David Innes Williams at the Institute of Urology in London. In 1958 he won the Leopold Hudson Travelling Fellowship that enabled him to be appointed to a research position at Colombia Presbyterian Delafield Hospital.

His grandfather was a dentist.\nAfter deciding from an early age that he wished to be a physician, he attended Bedales School in Petersfield, before matriculating to read medicine at Oriel College, Oxford in 1942. At Oxford he completed an honours degree in natural science. In the third year, he was offered an additional year of education by the anatomist surgeon, primatologist and palaeoanthropologist Wilfrid Le Gros Clark, who held the chair of the Anatomy Department. Thus he spent a fourth year at Oxford as an anatomy demonstrator, working on nerves relating to smell in rabbits and writing an MSc thesis.\nWhile at Oxford, he became a skilled rower. In his third year he became captain of the Oxford University Boat Club and was elected its president in 1946, the same year they won The Boat Race, the first after the war.\nCareer\nTurner-Warwick completed his pre-clinical training at the Middlesex Hospital, where he was a Broderip scholar.

In 1958 he won the Leopold Hudson Travelling Fellowship that enabled him to be appointed to a research position at Colombia Presbyterian Delafield Hospital.\nBy 1960 he had rotated through the specialties of internal medicine, pathology, gastroenterology, respiratory medicine, gynaecology and plastic surgery. In addition he trained in urology under Sir Eric Riches and Sir David Innes Williams at the Institute of Urology in London. Subsequently, he became one of six consultant general surgeons to the Middlesex Hospital, where he also looked after the thyroid clinic with Deborah Doniach and where he developed his trephine biopsy instrument. In 1963, he took over the hospital's urological department, succeeding Sir Eric.\nHe created a urodynamic unit and introduced video-cysto-urethrography in combination with measuring of pressure and flow voiding dynamics.\nAwards and honours\nIn 1977 Turner-Warwick was elected to be the Hunterian Professor of the Royal College of Surgeons. the following year he was a recipient of the St Peter's Medal awarded by the BAUS.\nIn 1987 he was awarded the Victor Bonney prize from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.
