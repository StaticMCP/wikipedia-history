According to Penny Richards: \"This scar and this name, with which he was thereafter frequently depicted, contributed to his legendary reputation\". Both sides lost no more than 50 men.\nThough the Duke of Guise achieved a victory at Dormans, in its aftermath, he was unable to break through the defences of François de Montmorency. The fifth war concluded with the Edict of Beaulieu in May 1576.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n* 506"
