On 29 June 1885, 179 lots were offered for sale at . The town would provide a break-of-gauge between Queensland's narrow gauge Southern railway line of  and New South Wales's standard gauge Main North railway line of  when the two systems came together in 1888. Two railway stations were created within the area. One was named Wallan-garra railway station () and the town took its name from the station but used the spelling Wallangarra (with most people using the same spelling for the railway station). Bald Mountain railway station () was the other railway station and is now abandoned.\nWallangarra Provisional School opened on 13 February 1888. On 1 January 1909, it became Wallangarra State School.\nOn 28 January 1919, the Queensland Government placed restrictions on the border crossing at Wallangarra to prevent the spread of the Spanish flu into Queensland, which were enforced by the Queensland Police. A medical screening process was used to determine if Queensland residents could safely return to the state.\nThe railway was the only rail link between Queensland and New South Wales until a standard gauge track was completed via Kyogle in 1930, with the completion of the bridge over the Clarence River at Grafton. From that time on, the Wallangarra railway station lessened in importance. Scheduled rail services ended in 1997. In 2003, after major refurbishment, the station was reopened as a museum. The railway line from Stanthorpe to Wallangarra has continued to be maintained and steam trains taking tourists to Wallangarra occasionally operate.\nThe Anderson Meat Packing Company was restarted by Mr. A.W. Anderson in 1938 after a 15-month closure. Until 1982, it operated a large beef abattoir at Wallangarra. Anderson's employed in excess of 400 workers at the Wallangarra plant.\nDuring World War II, the Australian Government created a general army store on the Queensland side of the border, and an ammunition dump on the New South Wales side. Dual gauge tracks were run to each store.\nWallangarra Cemetery was established in 1953.\nOn 12 September 1964, St Gabrielle's Anglican Church was dedicated by Bishop John Hudson. Its closure circa 2013 was approved by Bishop Robert Nolan.

The mutton produced is Halal, and most of it is exported to Arab countries. The abattoir shut down in July 2016 for \"the short to medium term\" blaming low stock numbers and poor global trading conditions.\nGeography\nWallangarra lies in a valley between two ranges of mountains, which are branches of the Great Dividing Range. It is  above sea level. There is a gap between the more Westerly range at Wyberba, about five kilometres north of Wallangarra. This gap has made Wallangarra the major inland border crossing for the New England Highway and what was the first railway line between Brisbane and Sydney. It is situated on the northern periphery of the New England Peppermint Grassy Woodland.\nClimate\nWallangarra is the coldest town by mean maximum temperature in Queensland, due to its altitude and extreme southern location in the state. Maximum temperatures average  in winter and  in summer. Wallangarra holds the record for the lowest maximum temperature in Queensland,  on 3 July 1984. However due to its exposed location, minimum temperatures are not particularly low; towns of significantly lower altitude such as Warwick and Oakey frequently record lower minima, and especially Stanthorpe of similar altitude but much flatter topography − which in turn causes warmer daytime temperatures and less snowfall compared to Wallangarra.\nDemographics\nIn the , the town of Wallangarra had a population of 385 people.\nIn the , the locality of Wallangarra had a population of 468 people.\nIn the , the locality of Wallangarra had a population of 440 people.\nHeritage listings\nWallangarra has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* Wallangarra railway station, Woodlawn Street\nEconomy\nAs of 2013, the Wallangarra Stores Depot remains a major Australian Army logistics facility.
