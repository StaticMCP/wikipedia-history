The Alyawarre are made up of roughly 1,200 associated peoples and actively engage in local traditions such as awelye painting.\nCountry\nNorman Tindale's estimate in 1974 assigned to the Alyawarre traditional tribal lands extending over some , taking in the Sandover and Bundey Rivers, as well as Ooratippra and Fraser Creeks. Notable sites associated with their nomadic world include Mount Swan, northern flank of Harts Range, Plenty River north and west of Ilbala, Jervois Range, Mount Playford and the Elkedra River. They were also present at MacDonald Downs and Huckitta.\nThe Utopia community,  north-east of Alice Springs, is partly on Alyawarre land, partly on land of the Anmatyerre.\nLanguage\nThe Alyawarre people speak a dialect of Upper Arrernte known as Alyawarre.\nSocial organisation\nThe Alyawarre had a four-section marriage system.\n* Pitjara\n* Kngwarija\n* Kimara\n* Pula\nDemography\nC. L. Yallop estimated the Alyawarre community to number 500-600 people in 1969. They were mainly concentrated at Lake Nash, the Georgina River, McDonald Downs, on the Bundey River, and the Warrabri Reserve.\nIn the 2016 Australian Census, there were 347 Alyawarre recorded in the \"Utopia - Arawerr - Arlparra\" Indigenous location. Only 4% of households only spoke English at home.\nNative title\nIn 1980 the Alyawarre made a land claim together with the Anmatyerre for the Utopia pastoral lease. In the same year, the lodged a claim along with the Wakaya people for land around the remote outstation of Purrukwarra. As a result, they were handed back  on 22 October 1992, while the Wakaya were given , both only small parts of the original claim.\nAlternative spellings\n* Aliawara, Alyawara, Alyawarra\n* Alyawarr, Aljawarra\n* Ilawara\n* Iliaura, Illiaura, Iljaura, Ilyaura\n* Illura\n* Ilyowra Illyowra\n* Jaljuwara\n* Yalyuwara\nSource:\nSome words\n* ' (kangaroo)\n* ' (emu)\n* ' (dog, dingo)\n* ' (honey-ant)\nSource:\nNotable people\n* Emily Kame Kngwarreye, artist\n* Ngarla Kunoth who played Jedda in the 1956 Chauvel film of the same name, now Chancellor of Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education\n* Kathleen Petyarre is an Alyawarre / Eastern Anmatyerre artist\n* Gloria Petyarre, artist\n* Nancy Petyarre, artist\n* Jeanna Petyarre, artist\n* Minnie Pwerle, artist (from Alyawarre and Anmatyerre language groups)\n* Elkin Reilly, Australian rules footballer\n* Barbara Weir, artist\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\n}}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n*\n*\n*"
