A year earlier, the Battle of Lipany brought an end to most Radical Hussite power in Bohemia, but some groups had still continued fighting. Oldřich II of Rosenberg defeated the Taborites near the village of Křeč, which brought an end to their ability to carry out attacks. After this battle the radical Hussites at Tábor began to make an agreement with Emperor Sigismund.\nFurther reading\n* Palacký, František. Dějiny národu českého v Čechách a na Moravě. Prague: B.
