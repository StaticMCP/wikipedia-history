Now out of production, when it was available the aircraft was supplied complete and ready-to-fly.\nDesign and development\nThe Discovery was designed to comply with the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles rules as well as Australian and European regulations. It features a paraglider-style wing, single-place accommodation and a single engine in pusher configuration. The fuel tank capacity is . The aircraft is built from a combination of aluminium including an aluminium chassis that can be broken down into four parts for transport.\nThe Discovery originally used the Radne Raket 120 engine, but this was replaced by larger engines, due to insufficient power output.\nAs is the case with all paramotors, take-off and landing is accomplished by foot. Inflight steering is accomplished via handles that actuate the canopy brakes, creating roll and yaw.\nVariants\n;Discovery C100\n:Model with a  Cors'Air M21Y engine with a 2.6:1 ratio reduction drive and a  diameter two-bladed composite, fixed-pitch propeller.\n;Discovery C122\n:Model with a  Cors'Air M21Y engine with a 2.6:1 ratio reduction drive and a  diameter two-bladed composite, fixed-pitch propeller.\n;Discovery T125\n: Per Il Volo Top 80 engine with a 3:1 ratio reduction drive and a  diameter two-bladed composite, fixed-pitch propeller.\nSpecifications (Discovery C100)\n|more general=\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=Cors'Air M21Y\n|eng1 type=single cylinder, two-stroke, air-cooled aircraft engine, with a 2.6:1 reduction drive\n|eng1 kw=\n|eng1 hp=25\n|prop blade number=2\n|prop name=composite, fixed pitch\n|prop dia m=1.00\n|prop dia ft=\n|prop dia in=\n|prop note=\n|perfhide=Y\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=\n|max speed kts=\n|max speed note=\n|cruise speed kmh=\n|cruise speed mph=\n|cruise speed kts=\n|cruise speed note=\n|stall speed kmh=\n|stall speed mph=\n|stall speed kts=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|never exceed speed mph=\n|never exceed speed kts=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|range km=\n|range miles=\n|range nmi=\n|range note=\n|endurance=\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling ft=\n|ceiling note=\n|g limits=\n|roll rate=\n|glide ratio=\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate ftmin=\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|sink rate ms=\n|sink rate ftmin=\n|sink rate note=\n|lift to drag=\n|wing loading kg/m2=\n|wing loading lb/sqft=\n|wing loading note=\n|power/mass=\n|thrust/weight=\n|more performance=\n|avionics=\n}}\nSee also\n*Airtime Explorer\nReferences"
