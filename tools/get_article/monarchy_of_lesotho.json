The monarch is styled as Marena; in Sotho language, Marena is the plural of the common noun Kings, where Morena is the singular for King.\nThe monarch since 7 February 1996 is King Letsie III, who ascended the throne on the death of King Moshoeshoe II, his father. It is the second reign of Letsie III; his first reign lasted from 12 November 1990 to 25 January 1995.\nSuccession\nThe succession to the throne of Lesotho is laid down in Chapter V of the Constitution, which reads that:\n:(1) The College of Chiefs may at any time designate, in accordance with the customary law of Lesotho, the person (or the persons, in order of prior right) who are entitled to succeed to the office of King upon the death of the holder of, or the occurrence of any vacancy in, that office and if on such death or vacancy, there is a person who has previously been designated in pursuance of this section and who is capable under the customary law of Lesotho of succeeding to that office, that person (or, if there is more than one such person, that one of them who has been designated as having the first right to succeed to the office) shall become King.\n:(2) If, on the death of the holder of, or the occurrence of any vacancy in, the office of King, there is no person who becomes King under subsection (1), the College of Chiefs shall, with all practical speed and in accordance with the customary law of Lesotho, proceed to designate a person to succeed to the office of King and the person so designated shall thereupon become King.\nCompensation\nThe king is granted a privy purse amounting to 52,778 USD annually.\nList of kings\nKings / Paramount Chiefs of Lesotho / Basutoland (1822–1966)\n* Moshoeshoe I: 1822 – 18 January 1870\n* Letsie I: 18 January 1870 – 20 November 1891\n* Lerotholi Letsie: 20 November 1891 – 19 August 1905\n* Letsie II: 21 August 1905 – 28 January 1913\n* Nathaniel Griffith Lerotholi: 11 April 1913 – 23 June 1939\n* Simon Seeiso Griffith: 3 August 1939 – 26 December 1940\n** Gabasheane Masupha (regent): 26 December 1940 – 28 January 1941\n** '''Mantšebo Amelia 'Matšaba (regent): 28 January 1941 – 12 March 1960\n* Moshoeshoe II: 12 March 1960 – 4 October 1966\nKings of Lesotho (1966–present)\n| nickname1   =\n| native1     =\n| life1       =  –\n| reignstart1 = 4 October 1966\n| reignend1   = 12 November 1990)}}\n| notes1      = Son of Simon Seeiso Griffith\n| family1     = House of Moshoeshoe\n| image1      = Moshoeshoe II van Lesotho.jpg\n| alt1        = Moshoeshoe II of Lesotho\n| name2       = Letsie III\n| nickname2   =\n| native2     =\n| life2       =\n| reignstart2 = 12 November 1990\n| reignend2   = 25 January 1995)}}\n| notes2      = Son of Moshoeshoe II\n| family2     = House of Moshoeshoe\n| image2      = King Letsie III at the Enthronement of Naruhito (1).jpg\n| alt2        = Letsie III of Lesotho\n| name3       = Moshoeshoe II\n| nickname3   =\n| native3     =\n| life3       =  –\n| reignstart3 = 25 January 1995\n| reignend3   = 15 January 1996†)}}\n| notes3      = Son of Simon Seeiso Griffith\n| family3     = House of Moshoeshoe\n| image3      = Moshoeshoe II van Lesotho.jpg\n| alt3        = Moshoeshoe II of Lesotho\n| name4       = Letsie III\n| nickname4   =\n| native4     =\n| life4       =\n| reignstart4 = 7 February 1996\n| reignend4   = Incumbent)}}\n| notes4      = Son of Moshoeshoe II\n| family4     = House of Moshoeshoe\n| image4      = King Letsie III at the Enthronement of Naruhito (1).jpg\n| alt4        = Letsie III of Lesotho\n}}\n;Regent Head of State:\n* Queen 'Mamohato'': 5 June 1970 – 5 December 1970, 10 March 1990 – 12 November 1990 and 15 January 1996 – 7 February 1996\nTimeline\nRoyal Standards\nFile:Royal Standard of Lesotho (1966–1987).svg|Royal Standard of Lesotho 1966&ndash;1987.\nFile:Royal Standard of Lesotho (1987–2006).svg|Royal Standard of Lesotho 1987&ndash;2006.\nFile:Royal Standard of Lesotho.svg|Royal Standard of Lesotho from October 4, 2006.\nSee also\n* Politics of Lesotho\n* History of Lesotho\n* List of prime ministers of Lesotho\nNotes\nReferences"
