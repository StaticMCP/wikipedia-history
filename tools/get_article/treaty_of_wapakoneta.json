      "text": "# Treaty of Wapakoneta\n\nThe Treaty of Wapakoneta was signed on August 8, 1831. Remnants of the Shawnee Native American tribe in Wapakoneta were forced to relinquish claims that they had to land in western Ohio.\nIn exchange, the United States government agreed to provide the tribe with 100,000 acres (400&nbsp;km2) of land west of the Mississippi River. The United States officials agreed to provide supplies and  monetary payment and to construct a sawmill and a gristmill for the Shawnees on their newly allocated land. This agreement became known as the Treaty of Wapakoneta or the Treaty with the Shawnee.\nThe treaty, along with several other agreements between indigenous tribes and the United States government, marked the slow but gradual removal of native people to land west of the Mississippi River, a policy known as Indian removal.\nReferences\n*Ohio Historical Society, 2005, [https://web.archive.org/web/20060117152334/http://ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=1407 \"Treaty of Wapakoneta (1831)\"], Ohio History Central: An Online Encyclopedia of Ohio History.\n*Full text of the [https://archive.today/20130415124513/http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=448 Treaty of Wapakoneta]"
