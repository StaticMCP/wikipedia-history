This class builds upon the skills developed within introductory and intermediate Spanish classes by applying each skill to a specific, contemporary context; common themes include health, education, careers, literature, history, family, relationships, and the environment. Students also strive to refine their skills in writing, reading, speaking, and understanding spoken Spanish. Students concentrate on developing proficiency in such skills, specifically in preparation for the AP Spanish Language examination. In addition, the course emphasizes mastery of linguistic competencies at a very high level of proficiency.\nDespite the best attempts by the College Board, the AP Spanish Language curriculum is very fluid. Individual teachers can choose to present the material in a variety of ways. Because teachers inherently have different methods of pedagogy, issues arise that pertain to the necessity of a standardized Spanish curriculum for the exam. Since the Spanish language is so eclectic and can be tested in a plethora of manners, a more solidified curriculum covering specific vocabulary, verb forms and usages, expressions, and other facets of the language is hard to develop.\nWhile some students may be concerned about their ability to demonstrate proficiency in an assessment that native speakers of Spanish also take, only the scores of students who study Spanish as a second language are factored in when creating the distribution curve of scores 1–5. Native speakers or heritage language speakers of Spanish are then compared to non-native distribution and assigned a score accordingly.\nThere are six AP themes in the course, and within each theme there are six contexts.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Section One, Part A contains sections of reading comprehension, in which students read four different passages and then answer multiple-choice questions about them. This section is 40 minutes.\nSection One, Part B contains readings with audio accompaniment and asks students multiple-choice questions to compare and contrast the two as well as synthesize each one individually. Section three contains audio presentations of approximately three minutes and has multiple-choice questions. The two sections combined are allotted 55 minutes.\nIn Section Two, Part 1A: Email Response, students respond to a formal e-mail with a short response and ask questions to the author. This section is 15 minutes.\nIn Section Two, Part 2A: Argumentative Essay, is a formal writing component takes the shape of a document-based question. Students must use two sources as well as listen to a recording to give a written answer to the question.\nSection Two, Part 1B: Interpersonal Speaking, is an informal or formal speaking section, where students are expected to interact to a recorded dialogue, during which they have 20 seconds to answer each section.\nSection Two, Part 2B: Presentational Speaking, asks students to give a formal oral presentation with a cultural comparison document and have four minutes to prepare and two minutes to record.\nThe test is approximately  hours in length.\nNote: As of 2017, all audio responses must be digitally submitted online as a mp3 file. CD players are no longer accepted.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Section\n! Item Type\n! colspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" |Number of Questions and % Weight of Final Score\n!

For example, in 2020 (the year when overall scores peaked in recent times), the percentage of native speakers who earned each score is as follows: 5 - 37.2%, 4 - 36.0%, 3 - 19.6%, 2 - 6.4%, and 1 - 0.7%. Based on these scores, 92.8% passed the exam, with nearly three quarters earning a 4 or 5, and the mean score for this demographic was 4.03.\nReferences"
