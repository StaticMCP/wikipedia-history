South Carolina holds the \"first in the South\" presidential primary for both major parties.\nNikki Haley, who served as Governor of South Carolina from 2011 to 2017, announced her presidential candidacy in February 2023. Tim Scott, who has represented South Carolina in the U.S. Senate since 2013, entered the race with a campaign announcement in May 2023. He suspended his campaign on November 12, 2023 and endorsed Trump on January 19, 2024.\nImmediately after polls closed at 7:00pm EST, multiple media outlets called the primary for Trump. Trump received the highest number of votes of any candidate for either party in the history of the South Carolina primaries, breaking the record previously held by George W. Bush in 2000.\nBackground\nThe Republican electorate in South Carolina is noted for having a high proportion of evangelical voters. Socially conservative candidates have performed well in the South Carolina primary in past contests. In the 2012 Republican primary, Newt Gingrich beat eventual nominee Mitt Romney in the state with support from evangelical voters.\nIn the 2016 South Carolina Republican primary, Donald Trump won with 32.51% of the vote, with the nearest opponent Marco Rubio taking 22.48%. Trump reportedly won 34% of the evangelical vote in the primary, with Ted Cruz taking 26%, and Rubio taking 21%.\nProcedure\n29 at-large delegates are awarded to the candidate with the highest statewide vote total. Each of the state's seven congressional districts are awarded three delegates. The candidate with the highest vote total in each congressional district are awarded that district's delegates.\nCandidates\nThe following 10 candidates had filed by the end of the filing period on October 31, 2023, and secured ballot access.\n*Ryan Binkley\n*Nikki Haley\n*David Stuckenberg\n*Donald Trump\n*John Anthony Castro (disqualified due to the check for his registration fee bouncing)\n*Tim Scott (withdrawn on November 12, 2023)\n*Doug Burgum (withdrawn on December 4, 2023)\n*Chris Christie (withdrawn on January 10, 2024)\n*Vivek Ramaswamy (withdrawn on January 15, 2024)\n*Ron DeSantis (withdrawn on January 21, 2024)\nEndorsements\n* Gresham Barrett, SC-03 (2003–2011)\nState senators\n* Katrina Shealy, District 23 (2013–present)\n* Shane Massey, District 25 (2007–present); Majority Leader (2016–present)\n* Larry Grooms, District 37 (1997–present)\n* Chip Campsen, District 43 (2004–present)\n* Tom Davis, District 46 (2009–present)\nState representatives\n* Mike Neese, District 44 (2023–present)\n* Chris Wooten, District 69 (2018–present)\n* Nathan Ballentine, District 71 (2005–present)\n*Bart Blackwell, District 81 (2016-present)\nMayors\n* Brenda Bethune, Myrtle Beach (2018–present)\n*William S.
