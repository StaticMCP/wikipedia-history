It was founded in 2000 as Christ the King Anglican College, before changing its name in 2015 when the school was acquired by the Anglican Schools Commission (Inc.).\nThe motto of the school is \"Integrity, Endeavour, Community\".\nThe current principal is Mr Keith Willett.\nOverview\nThe school campus is located on Campbell Road Cobram, opposite the Cobram Sports Stadium and just a short walk from the Murray River. The school as of 2025, offers classes for students from Foundation through to Year 12. And although small in size compared to other independent/private schools in the region, CAGS offers curriculum closely aligned with the current Victorian and Australian Curriculum as well as a wide range of extra subjects for the senior students such as Woodwork, Food Technology, Art, Biology, Legal Studies, Agriculture and many more.\nAs of the first three quarters of 2025, the school's campus includes many special purpose facilities, these include a library, an Art/Textiles/Woodwork/automotive wing, a Performing Arts Center (PAC), Science Laboratory, Computer and STEM Lab, a large Agriculture Center, and soon to come Trade Centre.\nReferences"
