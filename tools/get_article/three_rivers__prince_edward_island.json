Seven of these interim councillors were the former mayors of the two towns and the five rural municipalities that were amalgamated to incorporate the Town of Three Rivers, while the three others were provincially-appointed representatives of the previously unincorporated areas. The first election for a mayor and twelve councillors was held on November 5, 2018, resulting in Edward MacAulay being selected as mayor and Jane King, Alan Munro, Gerard Holland, Ronnie Nicholson, Cameron MacLean, David McGrath, Cindy MacLean, Cody Jenkins, Isaac MacIntyre, Debbie Johnston, John MacFarlane and Wayne Spin as council members.\nThree byelections took place between the 2018 and 2022 elections. MacIntyre resigned and his seat was won by Paul Morrison. Spin's resignation led to a byelection won by Larry Creed. Nicholson later resigned and was replaced by Hannah Martens.\nAs of the November 2022 municipal election, the size of council was reduced from 12 to 8. Johnston was elected as mayor and Munro, MacLean, Jenkins and MacFarlane remained on council. Spin returned to the fold while Anne Van Donkersgoed, John Van Dyke and Martina MacDonald were newly elected.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
