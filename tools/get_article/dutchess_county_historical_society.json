It publishes an annual Yearbook, and occasionally publishes other books and pamphlets. The organization grants awards of merit and distinction each year. It conducts outreach programs that range from talks to demonstrations to workshops, and  it collaborates with educational institutions and many other historic organizations and individuals in Dutchess County.\nThe Historical Society is funded through membership dues, the sales of its Yearbook and publications, solicitation of grants, and through philanthropic gifts and is a US tax exempt Charitable Organization.\nHistory\nAmong those eager to found such an organization at the time was Dutchess County resident Franklin D. Roosevelt. He laid out his vision for the Society in a letter dated December 10, 1914, mentioning a number of elements which came to fruition including an annual yearbook, occasional publications, and transcriptions of cemetery headstones. And while other notables like the President's mother Sarah Delano Roosevelt and Vincent Astor remained involved in the Society, its membership grew into the hundreds and involved a broad range of county residents. By early 1924, membership had grown to about 500.\nJohn Mylod and Helen Wilkinson Reynolds were early organizers and active in collecting information for the society. Reynolds, a researcher and author, served as Yearbook editor from 1921 until her death in 1943. She worked with author J Wilson Poucher and photographer Margaret De M Brown on the 1924 publication of Old Gravestones of Dutchess County, New York, which catalogued 19,000 inscriptions.\nCollections\nThe Collections include archival items, photographs, postcards, textiles, diaries, will, deeds, needlework, clothing, genealogical information, and correspondence within its house museum.\nItems include a portrait by Ammi Phillips of Helen Cornell Manney, whose birth family, the Cornells, were early settlers of the town of LaGrange. There is a collection of books, articles and private letters of historian and illustrator Benson Lossing, who was  born in the town of Beekman, lived for some time in Poughkeepsie, and eventually built a home and library in Dover. The Hart-Hubbard Farm Records reflect two families' agricultural wholesale business across four generations from 1838 to 1967.\nFile:Helen Cornell Manney by Ammi Phillips.jpg|Portrait of Helen Cornell Manney by Ammi Phillips, c.1833.\nFile:DCHS Masonic Jewel of Sr. Deacon 1823.jpg|Sr. Deacon Masonic Jewel dated July 1823, Hart Hubbard Collection.\nFile:1860 Artemisia Doctor Losee Ledger.jpg|Red Hook, NY doctor's ledger with artemisia leaves used to aid digestion 1860.\nFile:Kas Dutchess County NY c 1700.jpg|Double door Dutch \"Kas\" early 18th century.
