HELCOM is governing the \"Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area\" (the Helsinki Convention) and has shown exemplary commitment to improving the Baltic Sea through the adoption of the Baltic Sea Action Plan.\n2008 Prof. Krzysztof Edward Skóra, Hel Marine Station at the University of Gdańsk, Poland\nProfessor Skóra received the award for his research which exposes the impacts of new invasive species on the sensitive coastal water ecosystems in Poland. Among Professor Skóras achievements is also the establishment of the Hel Marine Station at the University of Gdansk.

It also educates and engages the public through study visits, specialist courses and seminars.\n2007 Ecodefense, Kaliningrad, Russia\nEcodefense received the award for its efforts to increase knowledge on and awareness of the Baltic Sea water environment. One of the most notable successes has been the ”Clean Rivers – Clean Baltic Sea” campaign. Since 1999, this highly appreciated Ecodefense effort has aimed to protect water resources, limit pollution of the water system from industry and educate young people and teachers in Kaliningrad. This has involved, among other things, education and broadening of knowledge among the general public, government departments, authorities, politicians and companies by means of reports, hearings and campaigns – and all in a region with severe environmental problems.\n2006 Mr. Björn Carlson, Sweden\nBjörn Carlson received the award for his great commitment to improve the Baltic Sea marine environment. He has shown his commitment by, among other things, donating 500 million Swedish crowns to the Baltic Sea Foundation.
