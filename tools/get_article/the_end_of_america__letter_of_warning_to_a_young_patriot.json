Wolf argues that events of the early 2000s paralleled steps taken in the early years of the twentieth century's worst dictatorships and called Americans to take action to restore their constitutional values before they suffer the same fate. Wolf describes the ten steps she sees as the process of transition from open societies into closed regimes.\nThe ten steps\nNaomi Wolf outlines ten steps that \"closing societies\" – such as Hitler's Germany, Mussolini's Italy, and Stalin's Russia – have historically followed. These steps, Wolf claimed, are being observed in America now.\nThe steps are:\n#Invoke a terrifying internal and external enemy.\n#Create secret prisons where torture takes place.\n#Develop a thug caste or paramilitary force not answerable to citizens.\n#Set up an internal surveillance system.\n#Infiltrate and harass citizens' groups.\n#Engage in arbitrary detention and release.\n#Target key individuals.\n#Control the press.\n#Cast criticism as espionage and dissent as treason.\n#Subvert the rule of law.\nDocumentary\nIndiePix Films produced a documentary of the same name based on the book. The film was released on DVD and online in October 2008.\nSee also\n* Gulag\n* Habeas corpus\n* Political dissent\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aW9PulYpjGs Interview with the author]\n* [http://stoplying.ca/video/naomi_wolf_end_of_america.htm Interview on \"The End of America\" with Naomi Wolf] on The Alcove with Mark Molaro\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjALf12PAWc Author describes the steps taken by incoming fascist regimes and the Bush administration and the U.S. congress after the 9/11 attacks]\n*[http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/Naom After Words interview with Wolf on The End of America, September 25, 2007]"
