The Coach of the Year was selected by sports writers, broadcasters, coaches, and managers. Through the 1945–46 season every coach that would win the NBL's Coach of the Year Award also subsequently lead his team to the NBL championship. Following that season's end, Lon Darling of the Oshkosh All-Stars, Murray Mendenhall of the Anderson Duffey Packers, and Al Cervi of the Syracuse Nationals would be named the final winners of the NBL's Coach of the Year Award, though they wouldn't win the NBL championship in the subsequent years they earned that honor in question. The Oshkosh All-Stars had the most seasons where a coach of theirs earned that honor with it happening to them three different times, while the most honors for a head coach occurred three different times with Paul Sheeks of the Akron Firestone Non-Skids, Bobby McDermott of the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons, and Lon Darling of the Oshkosh All-Stars each earning the award twice in their careers (Darling being the only one earning it in non-consecutive years). Sheeks, McDermott, and Darlins would end up earning the NBL's Coach of the Year Award for half of the years the NBL existed as a league.\nAmong the winners were three future Basketball Hall of Famers: Al Cervi (1985), Les Harrison (1980), and Bobby McDermott (1988).\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFF99; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:6em\"| *\n|Inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:6em\"|\n|Denotes coach whose team won championship that year\n|-\n|Coach (X)\n|Denotes the number of times the coach had been named COY at that time\n|-\n|Team (X)\n|Denotes the number of times a coach from this team had won at that time\n|-\n|W–L\n|Win–loss record for that season\n|-\n|Win%\n|Winning percentage for that season\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Season\n!Coach\n!Team\n!W–L\n!Win%\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\"|1937–38\n|\n| Akron Goodyear Wingfoots\n| 13–5\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\"|1938–39\n|\n| Akron Firestone Non-Skids\n| 24–3\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\"|1939–40\n|  (2)\n| Akron Firestone Non-Skids (2)\n| 19–9\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\"|1940–41\n|\n| Oshkosh All-Stars\n| 18–6\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\"|1941–42\n|\n| Oshkosh All-Stars (2)\n| 20–4\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\"|1942–43\n|\n| Sheboygan Red Skins\n| 12–11\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\"|1943–44\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFF99\"|*\n| Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons\n| 18–4\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\"|1944–45\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFF99\"|* (2)\n| Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons (2)\n| 25–5\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\"|1945–46\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFF99\"|*\n| Rochester Royals\n| 24–10\n|\n|-\n| 1946–47\n|  (2)\n| Oshkosh All-Stars (3)\n| 28–16\n|\n|-\n| 1947–48\n|\n| Anderson Duffey Packers\n| 42–18\n|\n|-\n| 1948–49\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFF99\"|*\n| Syracuse Nationals\n| 40–23\n|\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* NBA Coach of the Year Award\nReferences"
