The ceremony aired on MTV on Saturday, June 4, 2005 from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, California. A special award, the Silver Bucket of Excellence, was presented to the 1985 film The Breakfast Club. Also, Tom Cruise was presented with the first-ever MTV Generation Award. Neither of these two special awards were voted upon by the public.\nThe awards were also marked by Nine Inch Nails' decision to pull out because MTV refused to let them perform using as a backdrop an unaltered image of President George W. Bush. Frontman Trent Reznor commented, \"apparently the image of our president is as offensive to MTV as it is to me\". Foo Fighters replaced them. Anchorman and Mean Girls were the most nominated films, each receiving 4 nominations.\nPerformers\n* Eminem — \"Ass Like That\" / \"Mockingbird\"\n* Mariah Carey — \"We Belong Together\"\n* Yellowcard — \"Don't You (Forget About Me)\"\n* Foo Fighters — \"Best of You\"\nPresenters\n* Chris Rock and Adam Sandler — presented Best On-Screen Team\n* Vin Diesel and Jennifer Connelly — presented Best Villain\n* Nicole Kidman — presented Breakthrough Female Performance\n* Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis, Ioan Gruffudd, and Julian McMahon — presented Breakthrough Male Performance\n* Rob Schneider and Eva Mendes — presented Best Comedic Performance\n* Terrence Howard and Jimmy Fallon — introduced Mariah Carey\n* Sandra Bullock and Jimmy Fallon — presented Best Male Performance\n* Emile Hirsch and Jessica Biel — presented Best Frightened Performance\n* Hilary Swank — presented Silver Bucket of Excellence Award and introduced Yellowcard\n* Paul Walker and Zhang Ziyi — presented Best Kiss\n* Katie Holmes — presented MTV Generation Award\n* Johnny Knoxville, Seann William Scott, and Jessica Simpson — presented Best Musical Sequence\n* Dwayne Johnson — presented Best Fight\n* Samuel L.
