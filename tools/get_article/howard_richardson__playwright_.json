He served with the Army in 1943.\nBroadway\nRichardson wrote Dark of the Moon with his cousin and frequent collaborator, William Berney. They were unsuccessful in an effort to get Dark of the Moon on Broadway until an article about a Boston production of Dark of the Moon in the September 11, 1944 issue of Life attracted the attention of Broadway producers. With Richard Hart and Carol Stone heading the cast, Dark of the Moon opened on Broadway March 14, 1945 and ran for 318 performances. In addition to two off-Broadway revivals, it became a perennial play with numerous college and high school productions in the decades that followed.\nRichardson's other plays include Design for a Stained Glass Window, about religious persecution, and Protective Custody, which had a short-lived 1956 New York production starring Faye Emerson.\nTelevision\nRichardson also wrote for television, including Ark of Safety for the Goodyear Television Playhouse. Dark of the Moon had three television productions&mdash;on the Goodyear Television Playhouse, Cameo Theatre and Matinee Theater.\nIn 1960, Richardson completed his doctorate at the University of Iowa and returned to Manhattan, where he lived at 207 Columbus Avenue. He was a lecturer and resident artist at various colleges around the country.\nAt age 67, he died at New York's Roosevelt Hospital in 1984.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
