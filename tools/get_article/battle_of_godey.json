The assault was led by Colonel Abdillahi Askar, supported by Colonel Abdullahi Ahmed Irro of Somalia’s 60th Division. The battle was one of the most decisive initial Somali victories of the war.\nBackground\nOn 13 July 1977, the Somali Democratic Republic launched a large-scale invasion of Ethiopia’s Ogaden region. Somalia aimed to incorporate Somali-inhabited territory in the Ogaden into a Greater Somalia, fueled by Somali nationalism and freedom for the occupied Somalis. Somali regular forces, numbering around 35,000, advanced with heavy Soviet-supplied weaponry and were supported by approximately 15,000 WSLF guerrilla fighters.\nGodey, located along the Shabelle River, was a strategic military hub with an airstrip and supply depot. Its capture would secure a southern supply corridor for SNA advances toward Jijiga, Harar, and other regions in southern Ethiopia such as Bale, and Negele.\nBattle\nThe Ethiopian 5th Brigade, part of the 4th Division, was tasked with defending Godey. It was poorly equipped, under-strength, and cut off from reinforcements. Meanwhile, Somali forces assembled a mechanized assault force under Colonel Abdillahi Askar Barkhad, with operational command coordinated by Colonel Abdullahi Ahmed Irro of the 60th Division. In the days prior to the battle, WSLF insurgents disrupted Ethiopian communications, sabotaged roads, and attacked supply routes, causing the Isolation of the Godey garrison.\nOn the morning of 24 July 1977, Somali and WSLF forces launched a coordinated assault on Godey. The attack began with sustained artillery barrages and air strikes on Ethiopian positions. Somali mechanized columns advanced in a three-pronged attack, whilst guerrillas engaged Ethiopian outposts along the outskirts. Colonel Askar personally led flanking attacks on the garrison headquarters and the airfield, cutting off escape routes. By the afternoon of 25 July, the Ethiopian 5th Brigade had collapsed. Out of an estimated 2,350 troops, only about 500 Ethiopians managed to retreat. The rest concluded dead.\nAftermath\nThe capture of Godey was one of the largest Somali victories during the Ogaden War. It gave SNA, and WSLF forces a critical foothold in southeastern Ethiopia, and control over a key airstrip. By mid-August 1977, Somali forces controlled over 90% of the Ogaden.\nColonel Abdillahi Askar Barkhad’s success at Gode made him a national hero, earning the nickname “Lion of Gode.”\nAbdullahi Ahmed Irro, was awarded Medal of Valor, for his distinguished service during the Ogaden war.\n, Siad Barre awards Medal of Valor for Abdullahi Ahmed Irro]]\nSee also\n* Ogaden War\n* Battle of Jijiga\n* Somali invasion of Ogaden\nBibliography\n* Ayele, Fantahun.
