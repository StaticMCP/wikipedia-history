Diplomatic relations with the governments in Prague and Bratislava had now been established. The Swedish embassy in Prague in the former Czechoslovakia became an embassy in the newly created Czech Republic and the Swedish ambassador to Czechoslovakia became ambassador to the Czech Republic. Lennart Watz was appointed ambassador in Prague with a dual accreditation in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia.\nList of representatives\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name||Period||Title||Notes||Ref\n|-\n|Lennart Watz||1992–1996||Ambassador||Also accredited to Bratislava (from 1993).||\n|-\n|Ingmar Karlsson||1996–2001||Ambassador||Also accredited to Bratislava.||\n|-\n|Harald Fälth||2001–2006||Ambassador||Also accredited to Bratislava (until 2003).||\n|-\n|Catherine von Heidenstam||2006–2010||Ambassador||||\n|-\n|Inger Ultvedt||2010–2011||Ambassador||||\n|-\n|Annika Jagander||2011–2016||Ambassador||||\n|-\n|Viktoria Li||September 2016 – 2020||Ambassador||||\n|-\n|Fredrik Jörgensen||September 2020 – 2025||Ambassador||||\n|-\n|Håkan Jevrell||2025 – present||Ambassador||||\n|}\nSee also\n*Embassy of Sweden, Prague\nFootnotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
