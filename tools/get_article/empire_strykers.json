Founded in 2013 as the Ontario Fury, the team made its debut in the Professional Arena Soccer League at the start of the 2013–14 season. The team plays its home games at the Toyota Arena under the leadership of general manager, head coach, Jimmy Nordberg. The team re-branded to its current name in 2022.\nHistory\nIn late May 2013, the owners of the now-dormant Anaheim Bolts announced that they would instead field a new PASL team at the Citizens Business Bank Arena in Ontario, California. The team held its first open tryouts on June 28–29.\nOn July 25, team president Bernie Lilavois announced that \"Ontario Fury\" was chosen from over 500 fan-submitted entries in a name-the-team contest.
