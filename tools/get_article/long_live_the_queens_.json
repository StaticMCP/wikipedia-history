(aka The Platinum Collection) is the second compilation album by UK pop-rock project Shakespears Sister.\nBackground\nLong Live the Queens was released as part of Warner Bros. Records' Platinum Collection series, and thus is often referred to as such. As opposed to the greatest hits-oriented ''The Best of Shakespear's Sister'', the album is compiled of rarities and unreleased tracks & mixes, many of which making their debut on CD. \"Pretty Boy\", for instance, was previously only released on a promotional 12\" vinyl of \"Break My Heart (You Really)\".\nTrack listing\nReferences"
