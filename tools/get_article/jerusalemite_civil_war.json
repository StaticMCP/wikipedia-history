Baldwin decided otherwise and presented himself alone at the ceremony and, despite the reluctance of the clergy, received the crown alone.\nConsequences\nThe Latin states of the East were emerging from a period of weakness, with the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the Principality of Antioch and the County of Tripoli all three governed by a regent and the County of Edessa gradually reconquered by the Turks. The prestige of Baldwin III emerged strengthened from this war, and he was able in the following years to coordinate the defense of these states against the attacks of the Muslim emirs of Syria.\nReferences"
