This version was released in Asia and North America for the PC, Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Mega Drive/Genesis.\nGameplay\nUpon starting the game, players choose from one of six scenarios that determine the initial layout of power in ancient China. The scenarios loosely depict allegiances and territories controlled by the warlords as according to the novel, although gameplay does not follow events in the novel after the game begins.\nThe six scenarios and the warlords present in each are listed as follows:\n#Dong Zhuo's reign of terror (AD 189)\n#Warlords struggle for power (AD 194)\n#Liu Bei seeks shelter in Xinye (AD 201)\n#Emergence of the Crouching Dragon (AD 208)\n#Rise of the Three Kingdoms (AD 221)\n#Jiang Wei inherits Kongming's legacy (AD 235)\nThe PC-Engine CD-ROM version includes an additional scenario:\n*The Yellow Turban Rebellion (AD 184)\nAfter choosing the scenario, players determine which warlord(s) they will control. Custom characters may be inserted into territories unoccupied by other forces. A total of 46 different cities exist, as well as hundreds of unique characters. Each character has several statistics: War Ability, Intelligence, Politics, Charisma, Army Command, Naval Command.\nThe player wins the game by conquering all territories in China. This is accomplished by being in control of every city on the map.\nReception\n| rev2 = Mega\n| rev2Score = GEN: 68%\n}}\nIn reviewing the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis versions, Weekly Famitsu magazine's four reviewers—Hirokazu Hamamura, George Nakaji, Miki Watanabe, and TACOX—praised the improvements over the previous entry and noted the similarity between the two ports. Nakaji described the command selection as more clear in this sequel. However, Hamamura noted that Romance of the Three Kingdoms II was easier for beginners. Similarly, Watanabe and TACOX commented that Romance of the Three Kingdoms III was geared more towards fans of the series and genre. TACOX criticized the console ports' game controls, describing the computer-based design as confusing and unhelpful. Computer Gaming World stated in April 1994 that Romance of the Three Kingdoms III offered a \"wondrous\" look at an era of Chinese history, praising the game's detail and flexible play options. Mega called it \"[o]dd, aloof, but eventually addictive\".\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.gamecity.ne.jp/products/products/ee/Rlsan3.htm Japan Gamecity RTK3 page]\n*"
