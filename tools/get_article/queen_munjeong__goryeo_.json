Since she was closely related to her husband, this marriage was somewhat controversial. The marriage produced no children.\nBiography\nEarly life\nThe future Queen Munjeong was born as the daughter of Wang-Yu, Marquess Jinhan () and the granddaughter of Munjong of Goryeo and Worthy Consort Ingyeong. King Munjong was also her future husband, King Yejong's grandfather. Yejong's grandmother was Queen Inye who was Consort Ingyeong's sister and was born as the same daughter of Yi Ja-yeon () from the Incheon Yi clan. So, Yejong initially Wang's half first cousin.\nPalace life and later life\nIn 1121, King Yejong chose her as one of his consorts and she  entered the palace not long after. A year later, he died and she then stayed at Yeongjeong Palace (). In 1129, she was given the Royal title of Noble Consort () under Yejong's son, King Injong's command. She died in 1138 and received her posthumous name. During her mourning, Injong and his officials stopped the inquiry for three days and put on a small suit.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.doopedia.co.kr/mo/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view2&MAS_IDX=101013000924878 문정왕후] on Doosan Encyclopedia ."
