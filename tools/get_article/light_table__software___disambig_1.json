It features real-time feedback allowing instant execution, debugging and access to documentation. The instant feedback provides an execution environment intended to help developing abstractions.\nThe development team attempted to create a program which shows the programmer what the effects of their additions are in real-time, rather than requiring them to work out the effects as they write the code. Though the program began by supporting only Clojure, it has since aimed to support Python and JavaScript. The developers claim that the software can reduce programming time by up to 20%.\nIt was financed by a Kickstarter fundraising campaign and subsequently backed by Y Combinator. The Kickstarter campaign aimed to raise $200,000 USD and finished with $316,720 USD.\nSee also\n*Interactive programming\n*Literate programming\nNotes\nReferences"
