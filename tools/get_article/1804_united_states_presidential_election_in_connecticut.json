The state legislature chose nine representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nDuring this election, Connecticut cast nine electoral votes for Federalist Party candidate Charles Cotesworth Pinckney (becoming the only state other than Delaware to do so). However, he would lose to Democratic Republican incumbent Thomas Jefferson by a landslide margin nationally.\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Connecticut\nReferences"
