In 1976, the hotel was purchased by Ann Meyers, the first woman to own and operate a hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. Meyers, unaware of the hotel's seedy reputation, purchased it from the Jackson family on August 20, 1976, 48 hours after her first viewing. In 1990, in order to improve the hotel's image, Meyers changed the name from the Casbah Hotel and Casino to Ann Meyer's Queen of Hearts Hotel and introduced \"four-star service\" to budget lodgings and even saw increased business as a result. In 1992, Meyers was eventually able to move out of living in the hotel full-time and was able to purchase another nearby hotel, the Nevada Hotel, from casino operator Jackie Gaughan. Despite this, however, the hotel was still encountering problems such as prostitution, gang violence, and even a drive-by killing, with 680 calls made to police between 1994 and 1995 alone. On January 29, 2010, it was reported that the Queen of Hearts Hotel would be demolished to make way for the new Las Vegas City Hall building and business complex. The hotel's sign can be seen at the Neon Museum in Las Vegas.\nReferences"
