According to the Guinness Book of Records Shea holds the world record for singing in person to the most people ever, with an estimated cumulative live audience of 220 million people. In 1932 Shea composed the tune to \"I'd Rather Have Jesus,\" with words written by Rhea F. Miller (1894–1966). Shea was unable to attend the GMA Canada Covenant Awards ceremony in person, but sent his thanks via video link.\n2005 - Tommy Hunter was recognized by GMA Canada in 2005. Hunter was born in London, Ontario, March 20, 1937. \"The Tommy Hunter Show\" began as a CBC radio program in 1960 and went on to replace Country Hoedown on CBC television in 1965; Hunter's show was picked up by TNN in 1983 and ran on CBC Television until 1992. One of the regular features of the program included Hunter's inspirational and Gospel songs at the close of each show. He also released two Gospel albums \"Songs Of Inspiration\" and \"Readings\" which featured the fan favourites \"Touch Of The Master's Hand\" and \"No Charge\". Tommy Hunter was inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame in 1984. In 1986, Hunter was made a Member of the Order of Canada. He has received three Canadian Juno Awards and one Gemini Award. In 1990, he was given a place in the Country Music Hall of Fame's \"Walkway of Stars\". A street (\"Tommy Hunter Way\") was also renamed in his honour in his hometown of London, Ontario, in the late 1990s. He became a member of the Order of Ontario in 1996\n2006 - Connie Scott was recognized by GMA Canada in 2006. Scott grew up around Gospel Music.

She followed her initial success with a string of albums through the 1980s and into the 1990s including \"Spirit Mover\", \"Hold On\" and \"Forever Young\".
