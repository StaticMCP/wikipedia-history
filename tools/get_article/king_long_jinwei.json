The first models (MAZ-181010 and MAZ-182010) were made in December 2010 before it was dropped in 2012, with surviving models found either being used for MAZ personnel or in the streets, some of them as ambulances.\nThe models were publicly displayed in 2011.\nThe MAZ-181010 was made with a high roof and long wheelbase, with the MAZ-182010 with a low roof and short wheelbase. The \"Nika\" was a single ambulance model made.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*http://www.kinglongvan.com.cn - King Long official site. (China)"
