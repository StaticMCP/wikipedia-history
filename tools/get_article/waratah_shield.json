      "text": "# Waratah Shield\n\nThe Waratah Shield is a rugby union knock-out competition for high school teams from New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, Australia. First contested in 1963, it is organised by New South Wales Rugby Union in conjunction with NSW Schools' Rugby Union and NSW Combined High Schools and attracts around 100 entries each year.\nSt Edmund's College, Canberra is the most successful school with fourteen victories, until 2004, when the ACT was released due to their dominance. The NSW Schools Rugby Union asked ACT schools to 'show cause' as to why they should stay in the competition. The injustice of the exclusion was the subject of an adjournment statement from House of Representative Member for Canberra Annette Ellis in the Australian Parliament.\nThe Shield was not contested from 2018 until it was relaunched in 2022. Finals have been live streamed on NSW Rugby TV.  Replays and highlights from the 2023 Final are also available.\nNotable players\nMany notable rugby players, including Wallaby greats, took part in the Waratah Shield in their youth.\nMany came from St Edmund's College in Canberra, shield winners 14 times.  They include Ricky Stuart in their first title win in 1984 at the Sydney Cricket Ground which brought him to the attention of the sporting public, Matt Giteau, David Furner, George Gregan, Matt Henjak, Anthony Fainga'a and Saia Fainga'a.  Other notable players include Joe Roff also from Canberra who played in Marist College, Canberra's 1992 and 1993 victories, George Smith, Gordon Bray, Mark Ella, Gary Ella, Glen Ella and Lloyd Walker among others.\nNumber of victories\nA total of 18 schools have won the Waratah Shield since it began in 1963. St. Edmund's College, Canberra is the most successful school in the history of the Waratah Shield with a total of 14 victories, seven more than the next most successful schools, St Augustine's College, Brookvale, with eight titles.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
