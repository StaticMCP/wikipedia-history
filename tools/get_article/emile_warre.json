By 1948, Warré had been practicing beekeeping for over thirty years and had 350 hives in his apiary with a variety of models which he compared for over 15 years. After extensive research, he designed the People’s Hive. The goal was to create a hive that was as close to the natural conditions for the bees while remaining practical for the beekeeper. It was also designed to be built economically by anyone with simple tools and his book.\nReferences\nLinks\n[http://www.warre.it Italian Website on Warré Beehives]"
