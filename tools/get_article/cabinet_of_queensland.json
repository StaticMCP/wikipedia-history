Cabinet's decisions are given formal effect through acts of parliament, actions of the Queensland Executive Council or the executive powers held by ministers for the administration of their portfolios. All significant or sensitive policy decisions are determined in Cabinet.\nComposition\nThe Cabinet has the same membership as the Executive Council: the Premier and ministers (including the Deputy Premier and Attorney-General). Assistant ministers, formerly called parliamentary secretaries,|group=n}} are not members. The Premier presides at all Cabinet meetings.\nEach Minister acts jointly with and on behalf of Cabinet colleagues in their capacity as Ministers. This ensures collective responsibility, and enhances collective adherence to all decisions made in Cabinet. Cabinet decisions reflect collective conclusions and are binding on all Ministers as government policy. All Ministers are required to give their support in public to collective decisions of the Cabinet and the government. If a Minister is unable to publicly support a Cabinet decision, the proper course is to resign from Cabinet\nCurrent members\nThe Crisafulli ministry is a ministry of the Government of Queensland led by David Crisafulli. Crisafulli was sworn in on October 28 2024, following the 2024 Queensland State Election.\nCabinet outlook\nInitial composition\nOn 27 October 2024, Crisafulli announced that he and Deputy Premier Jarrod Bleijie would be sworn in as an interim two-person cabinet. Crisafulli and Bleijie were formally sworn in by Governor Jeanette Young on 28 October.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"border:#555; text-align:center; \"\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:100px;\"| Portrait\n!

In effect, the Executive Council is a vehicle for implementing decisions made in Cabinet. Individual ministers are collectively responsible for the decisions made by Cabinet, so ministers are expected to resign if unwilling to publicly support a collective decision of Cabinet.\nMeetings\nMeetings of the Cabinet are usually held on 10:00&nbsp;a.m. on Mondays in the Executive Building's Cabinet Room. The Premier (or Deputy Premier in her or his absence) chairs its meetings and establishes its agenda. All members are expected to be present at all meetings unless excused by the Premier.\nSee also\n* Cabinet of Australia\n* Government of Queensland\n* First Palaszczuk Ministry\n* Second Palaszczuk Ministry\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.premiers.qld.gov.au/publications/categories/policies-and-codes/handbooks/cabinet-handbook.aspx Cabinet Handbook]"
