Due to the continued presence of the Russian troops, Georgia, in accordance to its Law on Occupied territories (Article 7.4), holds Russia responsible for the protection of cultural heritage in the area.\nThe table lists a monument, its location and dating as well as the status attached to it by the Georgian authorities and the number assigned in the registry by the National Agency for Cultural Heritage Preservation of Georgia, which is available online as a GIS portal. The Agency broadly classifies the heritage sites into three groups: 1) the objects without a status, 2) immovable monuments of cultural heritage, and 3) immovable monuments of national significance.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Object!!National Registry number!!Date of construction!!Location!!Status!!class=unsortable|Image\n|-\n| Abotsminda church ||  || Middle Ages || Zemo Achabeti ||  ||\n|-\n| Andzisi church ||  || Middle Ages || Andzisi ||  ||\n|-\n| Achabeti castle || 1931 || 16th century || Zemo Achabeti || Cultural Monument of National Significance ||\n|-\n| Bortsvisjvari church || 1952 || Middle Ages || Tbeti || Cultural Monument ||\n|-\n| Church of the Virgin Mary in Galuanta ||  ||  || Galuanta ||  ||\n|-\n| Church of the Virgin Mary in Gujabauri ||  || Middle Ages || Gujabauri ||  ||\n|-\n| Tiri Monastery || 1961 || 13th century || Monasteri || Cultural Monument of National Significance ||\n|-\n| Ruins of church of St. Mariam in Zalda||  ||  || Zalda ||  ||\n|-\n| Church of the Virgin Mary in Zalda  ||  || 1820 || Zalda ||  ||\n|-\n| Church of St. George in Zalda || 1929|| Middle Ages || Zalda || Cultural Monument ||\n|-\n| Ruins of church of St. George in Zalda ||  ||  || Zalda ||  ||\n|-\n| Zakarwminda Church || 6114 || Middle Ages || Sveri || Cultural Monument ||\n|-\n| Church of St. Estate in Zemo achabeti || 6014 || 7th-9th centuries || Zemo achabeti || Cultural Monument ||\n|-\n| Church of St. Kvirike in Zemo achabeti || 6106 || Middle Ages || Zemo achabeti || Cultural Monument ||\n|-\n| Tamarasheni Grigoltsminda church || 6141 || Middle Ages || Tamarasheni || Cultural Monument ||\n|-\n| church of the Savior in Tamarsheni ||  || Middle Ages || Tamarasheni ||  ||\n|-\n| Kexvi Cylindrical tower || 6106 || Middle Ages || Kexvi || Cultural Monument ||\n|-\n| Kexvi cult building \"tsina dedaghvtisa\" || 1939|| Developed feudal era || Kexvi || Cultural Monument ||\n|-\n| Church of st.
