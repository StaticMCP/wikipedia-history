      "text": "# Warham St Leger (died 1600)\n\nWarham St Leger was an English army officer.\nSt Leger served in Ireland during Lord Deputy Essex's failed campaign. He was one of six royalist witnesses present at a riverside conference with Irish confederates on 7 September 1599.\nHe died on 1 March N.S. 11 March 1600, near Cork, in a skirmish with Gaelic chieftain Hugh Maguire. St Leger shot Maguire as he approached, though Maguire thrust his lance into St Leger's skull before succumbing to his gunshot wound.\nOn 31 March 1600, Thomas Denham wrote to Cecil that St Leger's widow \"is now preparing herself for the Court, to be a suitor\".\nHe is not to be confused with his uncle, also named Warham St Leger (–1597).\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\n*"
