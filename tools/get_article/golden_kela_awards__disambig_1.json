Created by Random Magazine, winners are selected each year by an online poll and receive an award in the shape of a golden banana (केला kelā in Hindi). The first award ceremony took place on 7 March 2009 in New Delhi (India). The fifth award ceremony was held on 30 March 2013. Jaspal Bhatti made a special appearance at the inaugural event, dishonoring the Indian film talent of the year 2008.  The intention behind the Golden Kela is to ridicule the Hindi film stars and acknowledge the worst of Indian Cinema. Since, several award ceremonies each year celebrate the best of Hindi Cinema, Random Magazine and the Sundaas Film Institute chose to be different by giving away the Best of the Worst of Indian Cinema. Golden Kela Awards are not meant to insult anyone. It is just a way to make it a laughter exercise, a therapy of sorts to forget about the failures and look at what went wrong with the movie and the act. Abhishek Bachchan came to the Golden Kela Awards in 2010 and accepted the Dara Singh Award for his attempt to speak with an American accent in Delhi 6.\nCategories\nMain awards\n* Worst Movie\n* Worst Director\n* Worst Actor (Male)\n* Worst Actor (Female)\n* Worst Supporting Actor (Male)\n* Worst Supporting Actor (Female)\n* Worst Debutant\n* Baawra Ho Gaya Hai Ke Award (literally, \"Have you gone mad?\")\n* Most Irritating Song\n* Most Atrocious Lyrics\nSpecial categories\n* Worst Pair\n* Lajja Award for Worst Treatment of a Serious Issue\n* Dara Singh Award For Worst Accent\n* Shakti Kapoor Award For Misogyny\n* Bas Kijiye Bahut Ho Gaya Award (literally, \"Stop it, enough!\")\nWinners\n2009\nWinners List:\n*Most Atrocious Lyrics: Anvita Dutt for Lucky Boy from Bachna Ae Haseeno\n*Most Unoriginal Story: Hari Puttar: A Comedy of Terrors\n*Most Irritating Song of the Year: Tandoori Nights from Karzzzz\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"background:#b0c4de; text-align:center;\"\n!
