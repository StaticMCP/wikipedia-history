The Viceroy had nominated General António Machado de Brito for the command of the squadron, who was at Bassein at the time, which is why he only embarked during the passage through this town. Supposing that the Omani squadron, after attacking and sacking Salsette Island, had sailed to Surat, General António Machado de Brito departed for there.\nBattle\nIn the morning of 23 March, the Portuguese squadron was sailing off Daman, when they sighted the Omani squadron, who were also sailing to the north, but next to the coast.\nWith the land breeze still blowing, it is probably that the Portuguese squadron started sailing close-hauled to approach the Omani squadron. At approximately 11:00 a.m. the Portuguese squadron had reached their shooting range of the rear of the line of battle of the Omani squadron, establishing a vigorous artillery duel with the rear. In response, the vanguard of the Omani squadron should be starting wearing ship to help the rear, but, it seems they did not, possibly because they did not had time before the wind fell. During this period it's supposed that the Portuguese squadron, with the advantage of having a galiot, had continued bombarding intensively the Omani vessels that were close to each other, causing them a lot of damage to the hull and to the rigging, and also causing them numerous killed and wounded.\nWhen the sea breeze started blowing, it is natural that both squadrons started to sail to the open sea, with the bow to the west-southwest and on a starboard tack, the majority of the Omani squadron having the advantage of being upwind of the Portuguese squadron. In this period it's probably that the artillery duel was fought exclusively between the Portuguese squadron and the rear of the Omani squadron that, apparently, wasn't able to take advantage of their overwhelming advantage. And, again, the Portuguese gunners, who had more experience than the Omani gunners, provoked considerable damage and casualties in the Omani squadron.\nIn the afternoon it is possible that both squadrons started wearing ship and returned to the coast. In the evening, the lack of ammunition made them separate and anchor, to fix the damage suffered and take care of the wounded. In the night, the Omani squadron, completely demoralized, weighed anchor, and, enjoying the land breeze, sailed to the open sea, towards Muscat.\nAftermath\nThe Omani squadron lost three frigates, sunk by artillery fire, which shows the bad quality of their construction, and had about 600 killed. In the following day they lost a ship of the line, which sunk by result of the damage that it suffered during the battle.\nHaving more robust vessels and better artillery than the Omani squadron, the Portuguese squadron suffered relatively light damage and casualties. In April, having left the coast clean, the Portuguese squadron returned to Goa.\nSee also\n* Siege of Sohar (1633–1643)\n* Siege of Mombasa (1696–1698)\n* Battle of Surat (1704)\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n*\n*"
