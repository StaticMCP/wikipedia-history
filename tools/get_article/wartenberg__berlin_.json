Until 2001 it was part of the former borough of Hohenschönhausen.\nHistory\nThe locality was established in the course of the German Ostsiedlung after the establishment of the Margraviate of Brandenburg by Albert the Bear in 1157. It was first mentioned in a 1270 margravial deed as Wardenberge and again in the 1375 domesday book of Emperor Charles IV. The estates of Wartenberg manor were acquired by the City of Berlin in 1882. Until 1920, it was a municipality in the former Niederbarnim district of the Prussian Brandenburg Province, then merged into Berlin with the \"Greater Berlin Act\".\nGeography\nOverview\nWartenberg is located in the north-eastern suburb of Berlin and borders with the Brandenburger village of Lindenberg (part of Ahrensfelde municipality), in Barnim district. It borders with the Berliner localities of Falkenberg, Neu-Hohenschönhausen, Malchow and Stadtrandsiedlung Malchow (in Pankow).\nSubdivision\nWartenberg is divided into 4 zones (Ortslagen):\n*Dorfkern (centre)\n*Falkenhöhe\n*Margaretenhöhe\n*Siedlung Wartenberg\nTransport\nThe locality is served by the S-Bahn line S75 at Wartenberg station, located in Neu-Hohenschönhausen.
