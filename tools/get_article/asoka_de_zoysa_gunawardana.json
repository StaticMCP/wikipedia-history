These two courts laid the foundation and legal precedents for the establishment of the permanent International Criminal Court (ICC).\nEarly life and education\nJustice Gunawardana was born on 6 August 1942 in Balapitiya in Southern Sri Lanka. He attended the local primary school at Revatha College, Balapitiya, till grade 9. He then received a scholarship to attend S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia to study for his A-Level exam.\nJustice Gunawardana graduated in law from the University of Ceylon, Colombo, in 1969 and obtained his PhD in international law from the University of Sydney, Australia in 1986. He also holds a Diploma in Human Rights form Raoul Wallenberge Institute, University of Lund, Sweden (1993).

The judgement held that it was \"critical to distinguish between the discussion of ethnic consciousness and the promotion of ethnic hatred\" and that the broadcast by Barayagwiza fell squarely within the scope of speech that is protected by the right to freedom of expression.\nBagilishema Trial\nAcquitted Ignace Bagilishema, the former Bourgmestre (mayor) of Mabanza Commune, because the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. This helped demonstrate the impartiality of the tribunal. In his separate opinion acquitting the accused, Justice Gunawardana considered Bagilishema's plea that he lacked the means and resources to prevent the alleged commission of the atrocities in Mabanza Commune, and that he maintained law and order, to the best of his ability, with the resources that were available to him.\nReferences"
