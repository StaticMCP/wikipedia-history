The album is a collection of reimagined versions of previously released songs, plus one new song. This is their final album with Hollywood Records.\nBackground\nDetails of the album were first reported in October 2019, that it would contain reworked versions of some of the band's biggest hits over the years. It also includes one new song, the lead single \"Far Away\" featuring Scooter Ward from Cold, which was released on December 6, 2019. The album also includes guest appearances from Lacey Sturm (formerly of Flyleaf), Michael Barnes of Red, Adam Gontier of Saint Asonia and Three Days Grace, and Spencer Chamberlain of Underoath.\nComposition\nAurora makes use of acoustic guitars, orchestral strings and piano, resulting in an acoustic rock and symphonic rock sound. The album is also described as post-grunge\nand retains hard rock elements on \"So Cold\", \"Failure\", \"Red Cold River\", \"Tourniquet\", \"Never Again\", and \"Torn in Two\".\n\"Dance with the Devil\" is noted for \"sounding more folky\", and \"Tourniquet\" retains Benjamin Burnley's \"aggressive growl\" during the chorus.\nTrack listing\n| extra1        = We Are Not Alone (2004)\n| title2        = Failure\n| length2       = 3:38\n| note2         = featuring Michael Barnes\n| writer2       = Burnley\n| extra2        = Dark Before Dawn (2015)\n| title3        = Far Away\n| length3       = 4:52\n| note3         = featuring Scooter Ward\n| writer3       = Burnley\n| title4        = Angels Fall\n| length4       = 3:46\n| writer4       = Burnley\n| extra4        = Dark Before Dawn (2015)\n| title5        = Red Cold River\n| length5       = 3:19\n| note5         = featuring Spencer Chamberlain\n| writer5       =\n| extra5        = Ember (2018)\n| title6        = Tourniquet\n| length6       = 4:22\n| writer6       =\n| extra6        = Ember (2018)\n| title7        = Dance with the Devil\n| length7       = 3:44\n| note7         = featuring Adam Gontier\n| writer7       =\n| extra7        = Phobia (2006)\n| title8        = Never Again\n| length8       = 3:42\n| writer8       =\n| extra8        = Dark Before Dawn (2015)\n| title9        = Torn in Two\n| length9       = 4:05\n| writer9       = Burnley\n| extra9        = Ember (2018)\n| title10       = Dear Agony\n| length10      = 4:16\n| note10        = featuring Lacey Sturm\n| writer10      = Burnley\n| extra10       = Dear Agony (2009)\n| extra_column  = Original release\n| total_length  = 40:12\n}}\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from album's liner notes.\nBreaking Benjamin\n* Ben Burnley – vocals, guitar, producer\n* Jasen Rauch – guitar, additional vocal engineering\n* Keith Wallen – guitar\n* Aaron Bruch – bass\n* Shaun Foist – drums\nGuest artists\n* Michael Barnes – vocals\n* Scooter Ward – vocals\n* Spencer Chamberlain – vocals\n* Adam Gontier – vocals\n* Lacey Sturm – vocals\nAdditional musicians\n* Carl Barc – additional orchestration, strings engineer\n* Philip Dizack – trumpet\n* Dave Eggar – string arrangements, orchestration, viola, cello\n* Benjamin Fingland – clarinet, bass clarinet\n* Jack Kessler – violin, viola\n* Katie Kresek – violin, viola\n* Sato Moughalian – flute\n* Chuck Palmer – string arrangements, orchestration, conductor/leader\n* Roger Wagner – string bass\nTechnical\n* Dan Korneff – engineer, digital editing, and mixing; additional production\n* Sean Dorrian – additional engineering and digital editing\n* Ted Jensen – mastering\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Chart performance for Aurora\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australian Digital Albums (ARIA)\n| 8\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| UK Album Sales (OCC)\n| 95\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| UK Album Downloads (OCC)\n| 33\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
