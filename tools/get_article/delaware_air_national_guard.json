It is, along with the Delaware Army National Guard, an element of the Delaware National Guard as well as a reserve of the United States Air Force.\nAs state militia units, the units in the Delaware Air National Guard are not in the normal United States Air Force chain of command. They are under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Delaware through the office of the Delaware Adjutant General unless they are federalized by order of the President of the United States. The Delaware Air National Guard is headquartered at New Castle Air National Guard Base, and its commander was Brigadier General Carol A. Timmons.\nThe Delaware Air National Guard is an Air Reserve Component of the United States Air Force. Delaware ANG units are trained and equipped by the Air Force and are operationally gained by a Major Command of the USAF if federalized. In addition, the Delaware Air National Guard forces are assigned to Air Expeditionary Forces and are subject to deployment tasking orders along with their active duty and Air Force Reserve counterparts in their assigned cycle deployment window.\nAlong with their federal obligations, as state militia units, the Delaware ANG is subject to activation by order of the Governor to provide protection of life and property, and preserve peace, order and public safety. State missions include disaster relief in times of earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and forest fires, search and rescue, protection of vital public services, and support to civil defense.\nThe Delaware Air National Guard consists of the 166th Airlift Wing. It traces its history to the establishment of the 142d Fighter Squadron on 1 July 1946. It operates the Lockheed C-130H Hercules. It is stationed at New Castle Air National Guard Base, and when mobilized is commanded by Air Mobility Command.\nHistory\nOn 6 Sept 1946 the 142d Fighter Squadron, Delaware Air National Guard stood up with an authorized strength of 49 officers and 263 enlisted men. The actual strength on founding day was 15 officers, one warrant officer and 36 enlisted men.\nKorea\nDuring the Korean War, the entire Delaware Air National Guard was ordered to active duty, and though the 142nd Fighter Squadron remained at New Castle County Airport, its pilots were all rotated to the Far East and most saw combat against Russian-built jets in what came to be known as MiG Alley over Korea.\nVietnam\nIn the Vietnam War, the Delaware Air National Guard began a regular schedule of cargo flights to Vietnam in late 1965 and operated several each month, in addition to its regular flights to Europe and the Caribbean. The Air Guard carried 60% of the cargo it would be expected to carry if it were an active unit in Federal service.\nBrig. Gen. William \"Bill\" Spruance (1916–2011), a founding member of the Delaware Air Guard, received the first Air Force Distinguished Service Medal given to a reserve officer for his work Vietnam. In 1961, after a near fatal plane crash as passenger in a T-33, Brig. Gen. Spruance selflessly devoted his time, knowledge and experience in an effort to improve flying and crash survival techniques. In 1968 during one of his three trips to Vietnam he gave over 100 presentations to over 10,000 people, at 58 bases, in 60 days.\nPersian Gulf\nDuring the 1991 Gulf War, the Headquarters 166th Tactical Airlift Group, 166th Consolidated Aircraft Maintenance Squadron, and the 142nd Tactical Airlift Squadron were activated in January 1991 involving over 275 Air Guard members. Shortly thereafter, members of the 166th Tactical Clinic were also called upon, bringing the total Air Guard involvement to over 350. All eight C-130 Hercules aircraft were deployed with the Air Guard to the Persian Gulf. The Air Guard merged with the 1670th Tactical Airlift Group (Provisional) at Prince Sultan Air Base (Al Kharj), part of the largest composite U.S. Air Force wing in the entire Persian Gulf area. The unit flew missions carrying personnel and fuel bladders critical to destroying the Iraqi Republican Guard. They were also one of the first crews that flew into Kuwait International Airport to begin rebuilding. In May, they moved a significant portion of the Shiite Muslim refugees to a camp in Saudi Arabia السعودية. In January and February personnel from the 166th Civil Engineering Squadron were also tasked with the 100% enlargement of the mortuary facility at Dover Air Force Base.\nBrig. Gen. (then Lieutenant Colonel) Ernest Talbert served in combat zones in Southwest Asia as a C-130 pilot in support of Operation Desert Storm. On 11 Nov 2005 he became the first African-American general in the history of the Delaware National Guard. Upon his retirement as Chief of Staff, Headquarters, Delaware Air National Guard on 11 Jan 2009, Brig. Gen. Talbert received the honorary rank of major general. Maj. Gen. Hugh T. Broomall, Special Assistant to the Director, Air National Guard, spoke of General Talbert's military career of 36 years, 30 of which were in the Delaware Guard:\nErnie Talbert's career is the clearest proof we have in the Delaware National Guard that outstanding performance merits ever higher positions of leadership. Delaware and the nation should be proud of General Talbert's career contributions, including his mentoring of dozens of Airmen, his wartime combat service and leadership, and his steadfast devotion to those who serve in the Delaware National Guard and wear the uniform of the U.S. Military. General Talbert has upheld his oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of Delaware against all enemies, foreign and domestic.\nThe Delaware Air National Guard units returned on 31 May 1991.\nAfghanistan\nThe Delaware Air National Guard was called upon again during the Afghanistan War. Its units have deployed to the Afghan region several times since 2001. In November 2004 Lieut. Col. (then Major) Patrick Houtman received the Distinguished Flying Cross for taking evasive action at low altitude after a surface-to-air missile (SAM) was launched against his C-130 aircraft. Lieut. Col. Houtman was the first Delaware Air National Guard member to receive this decoration. Lieut. Col. Gregory Carr and Master Sgt. Thomas Michaels of the 142nd Airlift Squadron were awarded the Air Force Combat Action Medal for active participation in combat action, having been personally present and under direct enemy fire on 26 Sept 2004.  On that date they were carrying Afghan and US VIP's on a classified mission when they were engaged by multiple sources of ground fire. In April 2008, Staff Sgt. Aaron Weber, Staff Sgt.

I look forward to working with her, General Vavala, and the rest of the Delaware Guard leadership team on priorities in Washington for the men and women who serve our state.\nSen. Carper, a Veteran of the Vietnam War who retired from the U.S. Naval Reserve after 23 years of service with the rank of Captain (naval), also spoke of Gen. Timmons:\nShe brings with her an outstanding work ethic and strong leadership qualities which I have come to know through conversations with her and through her work on my service academy interview team. I am proud that Brigadier General Timmons has been chosen to lead the exceptional men and women of the Delaware Air National Guard, who not only work their day jobs, but additionally shoulder the duty to protect all Americans in their service to their state and their country. I thank them and Brigadier General Timmons for performing with professionalism and precision to keep our nation safe and secure\nIraq\nWhile deployed to Ali Air Base, Iraq العراق with the Delaware Air National Guard's 166th Airlift Wing in 2010, Col.
