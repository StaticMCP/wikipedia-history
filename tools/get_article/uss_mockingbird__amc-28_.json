C. McEwen and A. M. Pereira of Gloucester, Massachusetts, 30 October 1940; converted to a coastal minesweeper by the General Ship & Engine Works, East Boston, Massachusetts; renamed Mockingbird 14 November 1940; and placed in service at Boston 12 June 1941.\nMockingbird departed Boston 14 July 1941 for Yorktown, Virginia. Arriving there on the 18th, it underwent training at the Mine Warfare School and on 20 August reported for duty with the Experimental Mine Sweeping Group. It continued to operate in the 5th Naval District until 18 February 1944, when it was taken out of service at Norfolk, Virginia.\nStruck from the Naval Register 29 July 1944, it was delivered to WSA for disposal at Little Creek, Virginia, 23 July 1945.
