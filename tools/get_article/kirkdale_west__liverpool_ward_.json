The Kirkdale West ward was created as a single-member ward from a portion of the former Kirkdale ward. The ward boundaries follow Westminster Road, Smith Street, Great Mersey Street, Commercial Road, Boundary Street, the Northern Line (Southport branch) to Kings Road and thereafter behind Orlando Street.}}\nNotes\nReferences"
