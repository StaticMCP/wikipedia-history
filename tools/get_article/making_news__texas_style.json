The show aired on Monday nights at 8/7C on the TV Guide Network.\nProduction\nThe program was taped at KOSA's studio at Music City Mall, which is owned by KOSA's parent company and is located in Odessa, contrary to the title sequence.\nThe series featured stories from Odessa and Midland as well as Goldsmith and Pecos. Sometimes, news anchors at rival station KWES-TV, the market's local NBC affiliate, were followed, but not as frequently.\nReception\nThe series marked the shifting priorities of the TV Guide Network as it \"veered harder into entertainment\" and \"extended the channel's thematic interest in television.\"  The series was described as a ratings success for the network, doubling its average primetime household rating and leading to a 2008 spinoff series set in Savannah, Georgia.\nWriting for Texas Monthly, TV critic Christopher Kelly compared the program to mockumentaries like Waiting for Guffman, calling it \" a witty, insightful, and even touching look at a television station that’s probably not much bigger than your average high school AV club\" and said the show \"blows to smithereens every last stereotype of small-minded, small-town Texas.\"   New York Daily News critic Richard Huff said that the series was \"fun to watch\", but he thought that it largely confirmed the stereotypes of local television news as \"cheesy, overwrought and sensational\".\nCast\n*Jay Hendricks- Anchor\n*Kara Lee- Reporter\n*Jose Gaona - News Director\n*Tatum Hubbard- Anchor (listed as Co-Anchor in first two episodes)\n*Gary Williams Jr.- Producer\n*Melissa Correa- Reporter\n*Bill Warren- Anchor (Dropped as Anchor in second episode, Listed as Reporter in third)\n*Craig Stewart- Weather Director\n*Greg Morgan- meteorologist\n*Jeff Stewart- Sports Director\n*Mike Barker- Anchor\n*Javi Perez - Sports Reporter\n*Catherine Collins - Reporter\n*Armando Saldivar - Reporter\n*Krista Escamilla - Morning Anchor\n*Eddie Garcia - Reporter\n*Allyson Powell - Reporter\nThe entire KOSA news team can be found here: KOSA-TV Staff\nSee also\n* Making News: Savannah Style (2008 spinoff)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.tvguide.com/Channel/makingnews_landing.aspx Making News: Texas Style Official Site]\n*[http://www.cbs7.com CBS 7 Official Site]\n*"
