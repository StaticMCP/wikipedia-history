The American Revolution includes political, social, and military aspects. The revolutionary era is generally considered to have begun in the wake of the French and Indian War (1754-1763), as the British government abandoned its longstanding practice of salutary neglect of the colonies, now seeking greater control over them. Ten thousand regular British army troops were left stationed in North America after the war ended. Parliament passed measures to increase revenues from the colonies. The Stamp Act in 1765 and ended with the ratification of the United States Bill of Rights in 1791. The military phase of the revolution, the American Revolutionary War, lasted from 1775 to 1783, but the land war effectively ended with the British surrender at Yorktown, Virginia October 19, 1781. Britain continued the international conflict after Yorktown, fighting naval engagements with France and Spain until the signing of the Peace Treaty of Paris in 1783. Historical background to the break between the Thirteen Colonies and Britain includes a chronology of the dynasties of Britain, ideas of kingship, its relation to Parliament; establishment of colonies with assemblies ruling local affairs, including taxation. British American colonists had the historical example a century before, 1649-1660, Commonwealth of England, the Interregnum. Charles I had ruled as an autocrat, without Parliament, and abused power. Wars ensued, which the king lost.  Parliament put him on trial and executed him, establishing a republic with a written constitution. American colonists in the 18th century saw the erosion of their rights as freeborn English subjects, which were enshrined in English law, particularly the Magna Carta (1215), Habeas corpus, and the English Bill of Rights (1689).\n* Gathering Storm, 1763-1774\n* American Revolutionary War, 1775-1783\n*List of military leaders in the American Revolutionary War\n*List of American Revolutionary War battles in chronological order, with location, outcome\nOrigins of English rights\n1166\n* Assize of Clarendon, an act of Henry II of England that began a transformation of English law and led to trial by jury in common law.\n1215\n* Magna Carta (\"Great Charter\"). Rebellious barons forced John I of England to sign the charter which defined and limited the power of monarch and established that the monarch was not above the law. It mandated the prompt administration of justice, forbade the sale of justice, and established the principle of due process. Power was to be exercised with consent. It forbade the king from introducing new forms of taxation without consent. Although King John almost immediately repudiated it, saying he had signed it under duress, but he died shortly therafter.  His son Henry III affirmed Magna Carta in 1225 with some changed language, explicitly of his volition.  It was reissued at intervals over the years, as a fundamental document protecting English rights. When American colonists fought against Britain, they were fighting not so much for new freedom, but to preserve liberties and rights that they believed to be enshrined in Magna Carta.\n1236\n*Establishment of the English Parliament\n1485–1603, Tudor dynasty\nHouse of Tudor rules England from 1485 victory of Henry Tudor's victory in a dynastic war, making him Henry VII.\n1485-1509, Henry VII\nFirst voyages of exploration by Portugal and Spain; voyage of Christopher Columbus, claiming sovereignty for Spain in the Western Hemisphere; division of the world between Portugal and Spain with the Treaty of Tordesillas(1494); first English voyages of exploration\n1497-1498\n* John Cabot voyages of exploration to the Western Hemisphere.\n1509-1547, Henry VIII\n1509\n*Henry VIII peacefully succeeds to the English throne, age 17, following the death of his father, Henry VII.\n*Henry VIII marries Catherine of Aragon, his late brother's widow, five years his senior.

Under Henry VIII's direction, the Reformation Parliament was the first in English history to deal with major religious legislation, transferring many aspects of English life away from the control of the Catholic Church to control under The Crown, and setting a precedent for future monarchs to utilize parliamentary statutes affecting the Church of England. It strengthened the role of the English Parliament and resulted in a massive transfer of wealth from the Catholic Church to the English Crown.\n1534\n*Act of Supremacy making the monarch head of the Church, replacing the pope.\n1536-1541\n* Dissolution of the monasteries was the set of administrative and legal processes by which Henry VIII disbanded all Catholic monasteries, priories, convents, and friaries in England, Wales, and Ireland; seized their wealth; disposed of their assets; destroyed buildings and relics; dispersed or destroyed libraries; and provided for some of their former personnel and functions.\n1534-1541\n* Jacques Cartier explores North America for France, sailing up the St Lawrence River, claiming territory for Francis I of France.\n1536-1603\n*Tudor conquest of Ireland - Henry VIII of England was made \"King of Ireland\" by the Crown of Ireland Act 1542. The conquest involved assimilating the Gaelic nobility by way of \"surrender and regrant\"; the confiscation and colonization ('plantation') of lands with settlers from Britain; imposing English law and language; banning Catholicism, dissolving the monasteries, and making Anglican Protestantism the state religion.\n1547-1553, Edward VI\n*Henry VIII dies, succeeded by his Protestant young son Edward VI by Jane Seymour, who dies before he reaches his majority and rule in his own right.\n* Edward's reign was marked by many economic problems and social unrest that in 1549 erupted into riot and rebellion. An expensive war with Scotland, at first successful, ended with military withdrawal from Scotland and Boulogne-sur-Mer in exchange for peace. The transformation of the Church of England into a recognizably Protestant body also occurred under Edward, who even as a youth took great interest in religious matters. Although Henry VIII had severed the link between the English Church and Rome it continued to uphold most Catholic doctrine and ceremony. During Edward's reign, Protestantism was established for the first time in England, with reforms that included the abolition of clerical celibacy and the Mass and the imposition of compulsory English rather than Latin in church services.\n*Edward VI dies, age 15. Succession is complicated because his older, half-sister Mary is Catholic.\n1553-1558, Mary I\n*Mary I of England, oldest child of Henry VIII, daughter of Catherine of Aragon, succeeds to the throne. She is the first ruling queen in English history.  She attempts to return England to Catholicism and restore church properties that her father Henry VIII had confiscated.\n*Mary I weds Philip II of Spain; the marriage is childless.

The terms of the charter granted by the Queen were vague, although Gilbert understood it to give him rights to all territory in the New World north of Spanish Florida. Led by Gilbert, the English briefly claimed St. John's, Newfoundland, in 1583, as the first English territory in North America at the royal prerogative of Queen Elizabeth I, but Gilbert was lost at sea on his return journey to England.\n1584\n* Richard Hakluyt writes A Particuler Discourse Concerninge the Greate Necessitie and Manifolde Commodyties That Are Like to Growe to This Realme of Englande by the Westerne Discoueries Lately Attempted, Written in the Yere 1584, commissioned Sir Walter Raleigh and presented to the Queen. His objective was to recommend the enterprise of establishing English plantations in the region of North America not yet colonized by Europeans, and thus gain the Queen's support for Raleigh's expedition.\n1585–1590\n*Roanoke Colony, two failed attempts by Sir Walter Raleigh to found the first permanent English settlement in North America. The first colony was established at Roanoke Island in 1585 as a military outpost, and was evacuated in 1586. The more famous second colony, known as the Lost Colony, began when a new group of settlers under John White arrived on the island in 1587; a relief ship in 1590 found the colony mysteriously abandoned. The fate of the 112 to 121 colonists remains unknown.\n1586\n* Welsh colonist Sir William Herbert plants a Protestant colony in Ireland; he had been granted lands confiscated from the Irish Catholic noble Gerald Fitzgerald, 15th Earl of Desmond.
