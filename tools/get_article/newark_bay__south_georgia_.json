      "text": "# Newark Bay (South Georgia)\n\nNewark Bay is a bay 3 miles (4.8&nbsp;km) long, entered at the southeast end of Fanning Ridge, along the south coast of South Georgia. The presence of this bay seems to have been first noted in 1819 by a Russian expedition under Bellingshausen, who roughly charted a small inlet in this approximate position. The name dates back to about 1927 and has become established for the feature."
