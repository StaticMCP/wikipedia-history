      "text": "# Warno (video game)\n\nWarno is a 2024 real-time tactics and turn-based strategy video game created and published by Eugen Systems, released into early access on 20 January 2022, and fully released on May 23, 2024. A spiritual successor to Wargame: European Escalation, also developed by Eugen, it takes place in a Cold War gone hot setting along the Inner German Border and Czechoslovakia, portraying a conventional conflict between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.\nGameplay\nWarno is a strategy game with a real-time tactical layer (for the missions & map levels) and a turn-based strategic layer (for the Army General campaigns). Players control individual units meant to represent historical military vehicles and infantry formations of the Cold War. There are many game modes in Warno focusing on various goals, such as acquiring an amount of points from objectives in the Conquest mode or destroying a number of enemy units in Destruction. The game is played by anywhere between 1 and 20 people, with multiplayer games scaling up to 10 versus 10. Single-player play takes the form of skirmishes against the AI, scripted battles set in specific places, and a turn-based strategic campaign.\nIn both multiplayer and single-player modes, all players receive a ticking income of points to spend on deployable units, such as infantry, artillery, tanks, reconnaissance units, air defense units, attack helicopters, helicopter-borne infantry, and aircraft. The units available to the player depend on their chosen battlegroup. Various battlegroups have different specializations, such as a focus on infantry combat or combined arms warfare. Some basic unit functions can be assigned to the AI, but a majority of actions are done by the player. Units are controlled in real time.\nThe playable formations (known as 'Battlegroups') in game are inspired from the orders of battle of divisions, regiments, and some corps that would have likely engaged each other during the initial stages of war along the German border in the year 1989, such as the American 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment or the Soviet 79th Guards Tank Division. NATO forces are exclusively those based out of CENTAG, the NATO formation which served in Central Europe, especially Germany.\nWhile the tactical gameplay is similar to Wargame, Warno has received considerable quality of life improvements and gameplay changes seen in the Steel Division titles, including allowing the AI to carry out smart orders for player units, the reworked deck system incorporating the orders of battle of in-game divisions, and variants and traits of units in the armory. Warno also incorporated dedicated single-player content, such as (turn-based) Army General campaigns and (real-time) Operations, from Steel Division 2. The game includes a basic map editor for player use which allows for simple asset manipulation.\nStory\nThe story of Warno takes place in an alternate world of 1989. The point of divergence is in April 1987 when hardliners stage a coup against Mikhail Gorbachev due to his perestroika reforms. The Communist Party, KGB, and Soviet Army form a troika to restore glory to the Soviet Union. Unrest in the Baltic and Armenia is crushed and, spurred on by the inaction of the West, the USSR launches a takeover of Finland, installing a pro-Soviet government and bringing that country firmly in their sphere of influence. This spurs the West, led by the United States under Ronald Reagan, to increase military spending. Western sanctions and increased military spending leads to food shortages and an oil crisis in the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, NATO conducts a larger than ever Exercise Reforger in September 1989, which the paranoid troika fears is a cover for conflict. Under the cover of their own Zapad exercise, the Warsaw Pact prepares to strike first.\nAs of November 2025, there are seven Army General campaigns taking place across various parts of the conflict and in the CENTAG, NORTHAG, and SOUTHAG areas of operations. \"Bruderkrieg\", \"Fulda Gap\", and \"Airborne Assault\" take place on Day 1 of the conflict. \"The Left Hook\" takes place on Day 4. Lastly, \"Highway 66\" takes place on Day 7. The new NORTHAG DLC added two more Army General campaigns, taking place along two main axis of attack by the Warsaw Pact armies in NORTHAG, \"Four Day To The Weser\" (Lüneburg-Bremen) and \"Armored Fury\" (Hanover-Osnabrück). Both of the campaigns take place on Day 4 of the conflict. \"Holding Attack\" and \"Closing the Pocket\" campaigns take place on Day 8 of the conflict.\nIn addition to the Army General campaigns, there are also twelve single mission operations, focusing on single engagements between various elements of NATO and the Warsaw Pact.\n'''Black Horse's Last Stand (21 June 1989) - Fulda was lost within 24 hours. The 11th Armoured Cavalry Regiment \"Black Horse\" fought valiantly but the 8th Guards Army was too strong. Now battered, the 1-11th ACR has fallen back to the town of Bad Orb, with the Soviet 39th Guards Motorized Division in hot pursuit. 1-11th ACR is ordered to take up a blocking position outside the town in order to cover the approach to Frankfurt, while they wait for Bundeswehr reinforcements to arrive.\nSledgehammer (25 June 1989) - By the third day of the war, the Soviets had reached Hanau, on the outskirts of Frankfurt-am-Main. Though they have been successful so far, NATO resolve is stiffening. Eager to keep up their momentum, 57th Guards Motorized Rifle Division has been tasked to conduct a combined arms assault to clear the remaining outposts and blocking positions in the Main valley and enable the 79th Guards Tank Division to exploit their success and drive on to Frankfurt.\nRed Juggernaut (23 June 1989)''' - The 79th Guards Tank Division has led the Soviet thrust into West Germany. Their advance has pushed elements of 11th ACR into U.S. 3rd Armored Division's lines and the Americans are rapidly trying to set up a defensive line. The 79th Guards Tank must keep up the pressure on the Americans and break through their lines at Ortenberg so the advance on Frankfurt can continue.\nBackhand Blow (25 June 1989) - The Soviet offensive towards Frankfurt has been contained, though the city of V Corps rear support area are still under threat. as the 79th Guards Tank Division regroups at Bruchköbel, U.S. 3rd Armored Division plans to launch a swift counterattack against them, in hopes of throwing the Soviets off balance and allowing NATO to gain the local initiative.\nThe Kitzingen Ruse (20 June 1989) - In the opening hours of the war, the Warsaw Pact prepares to attack Würzburg, hoping to open an alternate axis of advance towards Frankfurt to the northwest. The VDV's 900th Air Assault Battalion is tasked with seizing the town of Kitzingen and establishing a bridgehead over the Main river. The 900th must hold this location against counterattacks by the Americans and West Germans, while they await reinforcements that are surely on their way....\nGötterdämmerung (28 June 1989) - Tasked with screening the southern flank of the Warsaw Pact's thrust into CENTAG, the NVA's 11th Mot.-Schützendivision found itself overextended and soon blocked by NATO forces. Forced to retreat with heavy losses, its forces are in disarray as U.S. and West Germany armored formations purse it. The 1st Battalion of Mot.-Schützenregiment MSR-17 is tasked with defending the town of Stegaurach on the approaches to Bamberg in order to give its parent division a chance to reorganize.\nThe Dieburg Salient (30 June 1989) - The outbreak of World War III has spurred France into answering it obligation to NATO. However, France's scheduled deployment is moved up as Warsaw Pact forces threaten to encircle Frankfurt. 7e Division Blindée has been moved up to a salient protruding into the Warsaw Pact lines near Dieburg. Here the division must hold their position while follow-on French forces deploy behind it in preparation for the counterattack towards Frankfurt.\nHold Until Relieved (22 June 1989) - In the early days of the invasion, the British Army of the Rhine found itself hard pressed on every side, and none more so than in British I Corps area of operations. an infantry battalion from the Queen's Own Highlanders has managed to take up positions behind the Diemel river but their numbers are too few. A squadron of tanks from the Blues & Royals is sent to reinforce them, check the Soviet advance, and if possible, launch a counterattack.\nAs part of the NORTHAG DLC, four new operations were released.\nRunning the Gauntlet (21 June 1989) - The Warsaw Pact's offensive into NORTHAG quickly brushes aside resistance west of the Eble-Seiten Canal. One of the units cut off in this rapid advance is the Bundeswehr's Kampfgruppe von Jagow. I Dutch Corps has dispatched 42 Tankbataljon and some American units in an attempt to rescue the West Germans. Their goal is to conduct a counter-attack, open a corridor, and evacuate the West Germans before they are over run.\nThe Winged Hussars (26 June 1989) - The Polish Second Army attacks south of Hanover, led by the Polish 11th Armoured Cavalry Division. However, their attack is interrupted by a daring British air assault which cuts off elements of the formations. Two armored companies are tasked with linking up with their besieged compatriots and renew the attack on Hamelin.\nMarauders (24 June 1989) - Warsaw Pact forces have successfully fixed NATO forces outside of Hamburg and are prepared to open a new attack towards Denmark. However, this move leaves them open to a daring attack by NATO. NATO's MultiNational Airborne Division conduct a nighttime airborne operation against a logistical hub in Kasseburg. While they seize their objective, the mixed force of British, Belgian, and West German forces must consolidate their position and prepare for an inevitable Polish counterattack.\nSurvivors (28 June 1989) - After a week of hard combat, NATO forces have managed to hold the line on NORTHAG's southern flank. However, this defense is quickly shattered by a surprise \"left hook\" attack by the 1st Guards Tank Army. In the wake of the attack, several British, West German, and Belgian combat groups in the area around Beverungen find themselves isolated. One of the groups, the 16th/5th The Queen's Royal Lancers must fight their way back to friendly lines, gathering any ally units they can in the process.\nAs part of the SOUTHAG DLC, another four new operations were released.\n'''Siegfried's Wrath (1 July 1989) - As part of their limited offensive into southern Germany, Czechoslovakian forces have occupied the town of Deggendorf. Now SOUTHAG has deemed the town as the prime target to begin their strategic counter-offensive. Recon and artillery elements of the 1st Luftlandedivision will support the attack force as they attack the town and then help to defeat any follow-on counterattack.\nDelayed Retribution - (placeholder)\nGlory or Attrition - (placeholder)\nThe Hydra (3 July 1989)''' - The Czechoslovakian 1st Tank Division has been ordered to halt the multi-pronged NATO offensive converging on Plzeň, which includes five NATO formations consisting of French, West German, and Canadian troops. A force consisting of two tank companies, a mechanized infantry company, and air support in the form of Su-25s, MiG-23s, and Su-22s has been tasked with containing the NATO Hydra at all costs.\nDivisions\nFollowing the precedent set by Eugen's Steel Division series, players have a list of formations based on real-life military formations to pick from when competing in multiplayer. Each division has its strengths and weaknesses.\nNATO\nUnited States\n– 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment: An armored cavalry regiment that relies upon its heavy tanks, including in its recon section, to pack a small but deadlier punch, while being supported by large amounts of close air support and attack helicopters. Its infantry is lacking in numbers and is bolstered by a small number of local West Germany troops.\n- 3rd Armored Division: This division plays around its spearhead of strong heavy, though expensive, armor with its deadly attack helicopters, dive bombers and light screening force of infantry supported by its Bradley infantry fighting vehicles.\n- 6th Infantry Division**: A fast-paced airborne division built around aggressive infantry pushes and strong air support. It thrives in the early game using Airborne squads, Navy SEALs, and M-48 ACAVs to seize ground quickly. As the match progresses, it transitions into cost-effective infantry and air units to hold the line. While lacking armor and infantry fighting vehicles, 6th US boasts one of the most robust air and infantry selections in the game and will need to use both effectively to secure victory.\n- 8th Infantry Division: A mechanized division that excels at grinding down its opponents with durable, high-HP infantry armed with anti-tank guided missiles. This is supported by armored personnel carriers and tanks, providing a robust offensive line. Highly adaptable, this division can adjust to a wide range of battlefield scenarios, equipped to handle almost any situation.\n- 9th Infantry Division*: A fast-paced motorized division filled with a few experimental units, it relies heavily on its speed and firepower to quickly take positions and hold them with a plethora of ATGMs, fast transports, and grenade launchers.\n- 24th Infantry Division: A mechanized division that fields large amounts of various reservist and regular infantry units, tanks and infantry fighting vehicles. Its playstyle revolves around creating walls of anti-tank guided missiles and leveraging its limited but strong close air support with laser guided bombs and attack helicopters.\n- 35th Infantry Division\n- 82nd Airborne Division: This division plays around a strong opener with its versatile forward deployed shock infantry and recon vehicles. It transitions into a bite and hold playstyle with its infantry holding forests and towns, all while being supported by strong attack helicopters and air power.\n- 101st Airborne Division**: Combined motorized and air assault infantry division that plays around its large high-veterancy infantry squads, backed by flexible (often airlifted) vehicle fire support, a handful of heavy tanks, and a terrifying attack helicopter fleet.\nUnited Kingdom\n- 1st Armored Division: A heavy armored division featuring a mix of Chieftain and Challenger tanks alongside FV432 armored personnel carriers, this division relies on its forward deployed shock troops to gain ground early while waiting for its slower armor elements to reinforce it, all while being supported by good high-altitude bombers.\n- 2nd Infantry Division: Strong helicopter centric infantry division that can field a decent mechanized force with good air support.\n- 4th Armored Division*: A slow-moving mechanized division relying on its older Chieftain tanks, this division specializes in short-range tank engagements and long-range ATGM warfare, leveraging the advantage of mixing cheap and effective units to overwhelm your opponent.\n- MNAD* An airborne-focused multi-national deck that trades heavy armor for elite infantry, strong airpower, and flexible mobility. It excels at infantry combat with resilient shock troops, large squads, and forward-deployed AT teams backed by cheap AT helicopters and versatile recon options. Free veterancy across many units and access to airlifted vehicles make it fast and hard-hitting. While it boasts great AA for an airborne force, it lacks tanks, MLRS, and long-range fighters, limiting staying power in prolonged fights. Best used for aggressive, infantry-driven plays with strong air support and fast map repositioning.\n- Berlin Command: A deck specialized in drowning out the opponents men with fodder while constantly shifting the point of conflict to maximize the efficiency of its bombers. Made up of forces from the three occupying powers garrisoned in West Berlin plus local West Germany elements, this division relies on infantry and long-range strike aircraft to hold the frontline.\n- H. D. R. London**\nFrance\n- 5e Division Blindée: A division that excels at movement warfare with smaller strike groups, through vision manipulation and ambushes, with swift tanks and mobile anti-air systems\n- 6e Division Blindée*: A highly mobile French division that thrives on aggressive, fast-paced play, built around elite Legionnaire infantry and wheeled AMX-10RC tanks. With rapid repositioning, effective ambush tactics, and strong harassment potential, the division leverages recon drones, versatile attack helicopters, and powerful long-range artillery to maintain battlefield pressure. Rewarding players who can sustain high tempo, it quickly exploits gaps and disrupts enemy positions. However, the division can struggle if momentum stalls, as it lacks heavier armor and IFVs to absorb damage, forcing reliance on vulnerable ATGM carriers and air support. Limited AA coverage and towed artillery also require careful positioning to avoid enemy counterattacks. Ideal for aggressive players seeking dynamic engagements and constant pressure\n- 11th 11e Division Parachutiste : Good guerilla warfare division that has a very strong opener, tanks that excel at hit and run and an air force that can dominate if left uncontested.\n- 152e division d'infanterie**: An aggressive French light infantry division that hits hard early with powerful recon, shock troops, and strong forward pressure. Despite its explosive start, the division lacks staying power, its limited armor, artillery, and support options mean it runs out of steam quickly if the enemy holds their ground. Best used for sharp, decisive pushes rather than drawn-out fights.\n- Division du Rhin*: A French infantry-focused division built around large numbers of reservist units and light vehicles, designed for overwhelming enemy positions through mass and aggression rather than armor. It excels in close-quarters and forested maps, where spammed Sapeur squads, cheap tanks like the M47 and M48A2GA2, and a wide mix of ATGM platforms can overrun static defenses. Long-range I-HAWK SAMs and Mirage ASFs give it decent air denial, and its artillery tab offers solid fire support options for breaking entrenched enemies. However, it struggles in open terrain and direct armored fights due to poor protection on most units. With no forward deploy and a lack of mobile AA, it often has to attack into stronger positions without the tools to easily push or defend against helicopters. Best used on maps with cover, where it can leverage volume shielded from fire support to overwhelm the enemy.\nCanada (Added as part of the SOUTHAG DLC)\n- 1st Canadian Division*: A fast, flexible mechanized division built around mobile infantry, strong recon tools, and versatile air support. It excels at hit-and-run tactics using well-equipped squads, light armor, and air-backed momentum to pressure the enemy early. High-end strike aircraft and the multi-role ADATS offer strong support options. However, the lack of heavy tanks, IFVs, and deeper artillery or SEAD limits its staying power. Best used to secure early map control to set up a solid late-game defense.\nWest Germany\n- 1. Luftlande-Division*: This division focuses on high-tempo, infantry-led gameplay with strong special forces, mountaineers, and heliborne troops that thrive in forested or urban terrain. Its versatile air tab and cost-efficient support units give it tools to pressure and reposition across the map, while a solid lineup of lighter tanks and ATGM carriers offers mid-to-late game staying power rarely seen in infantry-centric decks. However, it struggles in open terrain where its infantry and light vehicles are more exposed, and its anti-air coverage is limited to short-range systems. With no SAMs, no heavy tanks, and few long-range AT infantry options, it must rely on speed, positioning, and efficient trading to maintain control.\n- 2. Panzergrenadierdivision: Mechanized division with strong forward deployed infantry transitioning into low-cost tanks and infantry fighting vehicles supported by a strong close air support\n- 5. Panzer-Division: Strong mobile mechanized playstyle through its swift tanks and mobile anti-air systems.\n- [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorialkommando_S%C3%BCd Territorialkommando Süd]: A reservist division which playstyle is focused around cheap air spam while holding ground with cheap infantry squads backed up by U.S. Green Berets in order to check any PACT advance.\nNetherlands (Added as part of the NORTAG DLC)\n- 4e Divisie*: A versatile Dutch mech deck capable of strong early aggression through fast recon IFVs and early tank pressure backed by cheap infantry and IFV combos. It combines flexible frontline play with heavy tanks, solid anti-tank options, and strong air defense. A powerful recon tab and reliable artillery support round out its strengths. However, the lack of attack helicopters makes backline insertions hard to counter, and the absence of SEAD limits the effectiveness of its otherwise strong bombers. Best suited for aggressive openings that transition into combined-arms control.\n- CLKA (Added as part of the FLC)\nBelgium(Added as part of the NORTAG DLC)\n- 16de Pantserdivisie*: A light mechanized division focused on mobility and forward deployment. Relies on medium tanks, recon tools, and strong autocannons, but lacks heavy armor, and robust anti-tank infantry. Best suited for fast-paced, flexible maneuver tactics or ambush warfare.\n- DivMob (Added as part of the FLC)\nSpain (Added as part of the SOUTHAG DLC)\n- Division Acorazada 'Brunete'*: A mobile, vehicle-focused division that thrives on early pressure and maneuver warfare. Brunete leverages fast, well-armed recon vehicles, cost-efficient AMX-30s, and strong AGL-heavy infantry to secure early map control and apply constant pressure. It’s backed by a versatile artillery tab and effective anti-armor air support, with strike aircraft and solid ASFs enabling consistent support from the skies. However, it lacks heavy tanks, forward-deployed infantry, and GSR recon, making it harder to push into well-defended positions and spot threats in time. Its AA coverage is limited to medium-range systems, requiring careful ASF play to stay protected. Less effective in late-game fights against heavier divisions, Brunete is best used to gain an early lead and maintain pressure through mobility, firepower, and smart positioning.\nWarsaw Pact\nSoviet Union\n- 2-ya Gv. Motostrelkovaya Diviziya**\n- 27-ya Gv. Motostrelkovaya Diviziya***\n- 35-ya Og Desantno-Shturmovaya Brigada: A mechanized-airborne division which focuses on its airborne-deployed mechanized infantry, while also benefiting from strong Spetsnaz squads, good air tab, and cheap helicopter slots. However, this division has mediocre artillery options, very limited number of mechanized infantry, completely has zero tanks, and lacks long/medium-ranged AA, as it relies mostly on its ASFs to defend against enemy fixed-winged aircraft. Best played with an early airborne rush.\n- 39-ya Gv. Motostrelkovaya Diviziya\n- 56-ya Og Desantno-Shturmovaya Brigada**\n- 76-ya Gv. Vozdushno-desantnaya Diviziya**\n- 79-ya Gv. Tankovaya Diviziya\n- 119-ya Otd. Tank Polk: An independent tank regiment with one of the best tanks in-game and very strong bombers; the Soviet counterpart to the 11ACR. This division suffers from extremely little infantry slots & options, to the point where the recon tab also acts as an infantry tab. Best played in a slow, narrow game focusing on one lane of the map.\n''Polish People's Republic\nEast Germany\n- 4th Mot-schützendivision\n- 7th Panzerdivision\n- 9th Panzerdivision*\n- KDA Bezirk Erfurt\nCzechoslovakia'' (Added as part of the SOUTHAG DLC)\n(*)added as part of a main DLC\n(**)added as part of a Nemesis Pack\n(***)added as part of the Early Access Pack\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*  GRYOnline.pl |url=https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/warno-recenzja-gry-po-ktorej-zostaniesz-osintowcem/z64666 |access-date=2024-08-26 |website=GRY-Online.pl |language=pl}}"
