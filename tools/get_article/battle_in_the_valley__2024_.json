      "text": "# Battle in the Valley (2024)\n\nBattle in the Valley was a  professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW). It took place on January 13, 2024, at San Jose Civic in San Jose, California. It is the third event under the Battle in the Valley chronology. The event features wrestlers from NJPW partner promotions All Elite Wrestling (AEW), World Wonder Ring Stardom, Major League Wrestling (MLW), and Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL).\nEleven matches were contested at the event. In the main event, Kazuchika Okada defeated Will Ospreay. In other prominent matches, Shingo Takagi defeated Jon Moxley in a No Disqualification match and The Chosen Bros (Jeff Cobb and Matt Riddle) defeated TMDK (Bad Dude Tito and Zack Sabre Jr.)\nThe show was also notable for the unannounced NJPW debut of AEW performer Jack Perry, who had not appeared in a wrestling ring since his AEW suspension from his backstage brawl with CM Punk at All In 2023. At the event, he attacked Shota Umino following the main card's opening six-man tag team match; after laying Umino out, he tore up his AEW contract in the ring and donned an armband reading \"scapegoat\".\nProduction\nBackground\nIn October 2019, NJPW announced their expansion into the United States with their new American division, New Japan Pro-Wrestling of America (NJoA). On July 31, 2020, NJPW announced a new weekly series titled NJPW Strong; the series would be produced by NJoA. On January 30, 2023, NJPW announced that all of the promotion's future American events would be branded under the \"Strong\" name. Beginning with the  inaugural Battle in the Valley event, NJoA PPVs have since aired under the NJPW Strong Live banner, and later re-aired as part of the NJPW Strong on Demand series.\nTickets for the 2024 Battle in the Valley event went on sale October 6, 2023.\nStorylines\nBattle in the Valley features professional wrestling matches that involve different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines.
