Founded for the most part by New England settlers, Liverpool maintained strong ties with the American colonies until the sudden outbreak of the American Revolution.\nOn July 21, 1762 the Lieutenant Governor and Council of Nova Scotia declared that \"the Townships of Liverpool, Barrington and Yarmouth together with the intermediate lands should be erected into a county by the name of Queens County\". Parts of the new county were taken from Lunenburg County, which now lies to the northeast.\nIn 1784, Shelburne County was formed in part from southwestern portions of Queens County. The new county boundaries were established by an Order-in-Council dated December 16, 1785.\nQueens County contains substantial portions of Kejimkujik National Park, including the main body of the park inland north of Caledonia and the Seaside Adjunct near Port Joli and Port Mouton.\nIn 1996, the county's municipal government merged with the town of Liverpool to form the Region of Queens Municipality, thus the county is contiguous with the boundaries of the regional municipality, minus First Nations reserves.\nDemographics\nAs a census division in the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Queens County had a population of  living in  of its  total private dwellings, a change of |10351|1}} from its 2016 population of .
