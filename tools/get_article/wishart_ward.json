      "text": "# Wishart Ward\n\nWishart Ward was a Brisbane City Council ward covering Wishart and surrounding suburbs. It was abolished as part of the 2015 redistribution and split into Holland Park and MacGregor, with this taking affect at the 2016 election.\nHistory\nAlthough considered a safe Liberal seat, Wishart became more marginal after a 2007 redistribution. Robbie Williams, who had been appointed as a councillor for Holland Park Ward in October 2007, had been preselected by the Labor Party to contest Wishart at the 2008 election. However, he died of a heart attack in December 2007.\nAs a result of the redistribution, Wishart councillor Graham Quirk moved to MacGregor Ward, and Krista Adams successfully ran for the Liberals in 2008. She was re-elected in 2012.\nCouncillors for Wishart Ward\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Image\n!Member\n!Party\n!Term\n!Notes\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n|\n| Graham Quirk\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Liberal\n|\n| Contested MacGregor Ward following redistribution.
