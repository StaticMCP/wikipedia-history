It ended with a Spanish victory achieved by Colonel Pablo Morillo who repelled Marshal Michel Ney's attempt to displace him from a strong riverside position.\nBackground\nThe Spanish campaign in early 1809 started with the Battle of Uclés.\nBattle\nThe Spanish forces commanded by Colonel Pablo Morillo defeated the French forces of Marshal Michel Ney. On 7 June, the French launched frontal assaults, but it was unsuccessful; the Spanish volleys proved insurmountable. Over the next two days, Ney attempted to outflank the Spanish by crossing the river at another place, but the Spanish managed to react, prepare defensive erections, and meet him. Moreover, the Spaniards managed to disable the French artillery crews. Ney and his forces were forced to retreat and the French offensive to re-capture the cities of Pontevedra and Vigo was a failure. The battle marked the final evacuation of Galicia by the French army and the creation of a new front.\nAftermath\nThe Spanish campaign in early 1809 proceeded with the French advance in Catalonia in the Battle of Valls.\nSee also\n* Monument to the heroes of Puente Sampayo\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
