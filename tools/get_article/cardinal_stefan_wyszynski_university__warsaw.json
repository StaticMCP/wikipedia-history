UKSW is a public university that offers education in the humanities, social studies, and natural sciences, and, since 2019, medicine.\nThe university has twelve faculties located in two campuses in Warsaw's Bielany district: on Dewajtis and Wóycickiego Streets. The university offers forty majors, including medicine, psychology, law, journalism, environmental engineering, Italian philology, and economics.\nIn 2016, the Mazovian Laboratory Center of Life Sciences UKSW was established on the campus at the Wóycickiego Street site. In 2019, the university received the European Commission's \"HR Excellence in Research\" award, confirming its adherence to the principles of the European Charter for Researchers. In addition, all faculties of the university are under the supervision of the Minister of Science and Higher Education; four of themthe Faculties of Theology, of Christian Philosophy, of Canon Law and of Family Studiesare additionally supervised by church authorities.\nHistory\n– Dewajtis campus]]\nIn 1954, the  and the Faculty of Theology at the Jagiellonian University were closed down. They were transformed into the Academy of Catholic Theology (ATK). At the same time, the  was removed from the University of Warsaw and became the basis for the multidenominational Christian Theological Academy in Warsaw (ChAT). In the same year, the authorities displaced the Marian Fatherswho had been operating from , the former-Camaldolese monastery, since 1915from the orders' monastic and hermitage site in Bielany, Warsaw; the newly-founded ATK was given the vacated monastery complex.\nThe Academy of Catholic Theology was a state university, established by a decision of the then Council of Ministers. According to canon law, theological faculties should be created or approved by the Holy See, so the creation of the new university was ill-received by the ecclesial community. Primate Stefan Wyszyński, then archbishop of Warsaw, was imprisoned in the years 1953–1956. After regaining his freedom, he did not immediately accept the university. Only since 1960, with the approval of the Holy See, did he respect the academy and consider himself grand chancellor of the university (the ecclesiastical authority and non-academic leader). The Academy of Catholic Theology was granted full ecclesiastical rights in 1989, henceforth becoming both a state and a church university.\nIn 1954, the Academy of Catholic Theology employed sixty faculty members. There were 415 students studying there. It had three faculties: Faculty of Theology, Faculty of Canon Law, and Faculty of Christian Philosophy. The university was fully funded by the state. The number of students allowed to enroll was strictly determined by the communist authorities of the Polish People's Republic. It was not until the 1980s that the number of students increased significantly. In 1987, the Faculty of Church Historical and Social Sciences was created from a portion of the Faculty of Theology.\nFurther development of the university took place in the 1990s: the number of professors and students increased, new majors were opened. Changes within the institution allowed it to become a university. It took place on 3 September 1999, and the university was named after Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński.\nCampuses\nThe university consists of two main campuses: the Dewajtis campus at 5 Dewajtis Street in Bielany; and the Wóycickiego campus at 1/3 Wóycickiego Street in Młociny.\nDewajtis Campus, in addition to teaching rooms, has the Main Library, the radio and television laboratory, the rector's office, and the headquarters of university authorities.\nWóycickiego-Młociny campus\nThe campus in Młociny is under ongoing expansion. On 14 February 2008, the first part of the Center for Education and Interdisciplinary Research – Auditorium Maximum (building no. 21) was opened there. It is where lecture rooms, laboratories and a student canteen are located. In February 2009, Building 23, which houses the Faculty of Historical and Social Sciences, the Faculty of Christian Philosophy, and the Faculty of Biology and Environmental Sciences, was completed. In 2015, the newly built Life Sciences Laboratory Center (building 24) was opened. In 2020, a modern field house was put into use. The headquarters of the Faculty of Medicine –  and Multidisciplinary Research Centre (MCB) in Dziekanowo Leśne are under construction .\nTransport\nThe Wóycickiego Campus can be reached by several bus lines, including the line \"114\" leading directly to the campus gate from the Młociny metro station.\nThe Dewajtis Campus is about  from the nearest tram stop.\nGovernance\nThe head of the Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University (UKSW) is the rector. The governing and administrative bodies of the university are the secretariat and the senate.

The senate enacts university regulations and consults with the rector on university management and development. It appoints members of the university council; the council's role is to advise the senate on policy.\nIn June 2020, Professor Ryszard Czekalski was elected rector of the university for a term of office from 2020 to 2024.
