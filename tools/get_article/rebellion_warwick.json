The former owners of that company, the Oliver Twins, Andrew and Philip Oliver, along with COO Richard Smithies started Radiant Worlds, and were reported to have recruited up to 50 former Blitz staff.\nFollowing the cancellation of their first game, SkySaga: Infinite Isles, in August 2017, the company expected to make a large number of staff redundant.\nOn 8 January 2018, it was announced that the studio had been acquired by Rebellion Developments and would henceforth be known as Rebellion Warwick.\nReferences"
