      "text": "# Battle of Maraycalla\n\nThe battle of Maraycalla was fought in 1534 between Spanish conquistadors and renegade forces of the Inca Empire (Atahualpa faction of the Inca Civil War), whose capital Cuzco had been taken by the Spaniards in November 1533. The Inca army was commanded by famous general Quizquiz. After losing the battle, Quizquiz' army retreated via Cajamarca to its base in the Northern capital Quito.\nWhen approaching Quito after marching more than 1500&nbsp;km, Quizquiz learned that Spanish forces had already taken possession of Quito. Quizquiz wanted to continue the fight, but the Inca general was slain by his mutinous forces.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Battle of maraycalla\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Maraycalla"
