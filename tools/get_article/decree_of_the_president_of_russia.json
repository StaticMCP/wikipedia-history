Presidential decrees may not alter existing laws of higher precedence – the Constitution of Russia, Federal Constitutional Laws, Federal Laws and laws of Russian regions and, till the 2020 Russian constitutional referendum, Russia's international agreements, which now however stand in lower precedence than Presidential Decrees or any other Russian state law or obligation – and may be superseded by any of these laws.\nHistory\nIn 1992 and 1993 a constant war between President Yeltsin and the Russian parliament became known as \"war of laws\" when presidential decrees issued by president Yeltsin were overturned by separate legislation adopted by the parliament. The war reached its peak in October 1993 when Yeltsin ordered to shoot the parliament building. Following the referendum of 1993 which resulted in the enacting of new constitution, many decrees issued by Yeltsin, a process which was shrinking as the legislative vacuum filled-in by enacting of various laws thus limiting the range of presidential discretion.\nSee also\n* Order of the Government of Russia\n* Resolution of the CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://kremlin.ru/acts/bank Acts of the President of Russia]\n** [https://web.archive.org/web/20130428043136/http://document.kremlin.ru/ Archive of decrees prior to 1 May 2010)]\n*  [http://www.rg.ru/2006/02/07/deloproizvodstvo-instrukcia-dok.html Preparation and execution of projects, acts of the President of the Russian Federation (Russian)]"
