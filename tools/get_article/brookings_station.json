It is located at the south end of the business district in Brookings, South Dakota. The building is a rectangular single-story brick patternbook style building with some classical features.\nThe C&NW first entered Brookings in 1879. The depot opened February 1, 1905 and functioned as a passenger station until 1960.\nThe depot was listed in the National Register of Historic Places because of its architecture and also because of its association with the development of Brookings.\nReferences\n*French, Edith.
