It was later reconstituted as the Autonomous Republic of Crimea.\nHistory\nOn 12 February 1991, the status of the Crimean Oblast was changed to that of autonomous republic by the Ukrainian SSR as the result of a state-sanctioned referendum held on 20 January 1991. Four months later, on June 19, appropriate changes were made to the Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR.\nIn September 1991, the Crimean parliament declared the territory to be a sovereign constituent part of Ukraine. Following approval of the Ukrainian independence national referendum on 1 December 1991, the region was part of the newly independent state of Ukraine. With effect from 6 May 1992, the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was transformed into the Republic of Crimea within Ukraine.\nThe status of Sevastopol, due to its strategic importance as the main base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, remained disputed between Ukraine and Russia until 1997 when it was agreed that it should be treated as a \"city with special status\" within Ukraine.\nSince 2014, the Crimean Peninsula has been under Russian control following the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation.\nLeadership\n;Chairman of the Supreme Council\n* 22 March 1991 – 9 May 1994 Mykola Bahrov\n;Chairman of the Council of Ministers\n* 22 March 1991 – 20 May 1993 Vitaliy Kurashik\nSee also\n*Crimea in the Soviet Union\nReferences"
