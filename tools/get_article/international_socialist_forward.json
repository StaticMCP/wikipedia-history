The organization was formed in 2010 as the Taiwanese branch of the International Socialist Alternative (ISA) as the Taiwanese Socialist Alliance (). The name later changed to Workers' International Committee Taiwan (), before adopting its current name on November 12, 2016, when it was officially founded. The organization broke from the ISA on March 13, 2021, and claims to be the only anti-capitalist revolutionary socialist political organization in Taiwan.\nIdeology\nThe organization believes Taiwanese statehood cannot be achieved through reliance on the Pan-Green Coalition, and must be led by the working class. Through this leadership, the Taiwanese people will unite with the Chinese people, overthrowing the one-party state and capitalism, achieving true independence. This independent, socialist Taiwan will become part of the Asian Socialist Federation. The organization also believes Taiwanese politics are monopolized by the Democratic Progressive Party and the Kuomintang, two bourgeoisie parties, and that the working class must found their own party.\nSee also\n* Taiwan independence Left\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://socialism.org.tw/ Official website]"
