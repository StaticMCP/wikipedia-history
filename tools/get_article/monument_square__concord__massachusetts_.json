Laid out in 1635, it is now part of the Concord Monument Square–Lexington Road Historic District.\nThe square is prominently known as the site of British activities on April 19, 1775, the day of the battles of Lexington and Concord, which began the American Revolutionary War, and of earlier meetings by Massachusetts Patriots, which were held in the First Parish Church and Wright's Tavern.\nA stone marker commemorating Corporal Ralph P. Hosmer, Private Charles A. Hart, and Private George E. Adams, of Concord's company in the  6th Massachusetts Voluntary Infantry Regiment, stands at the northwestern edge of the square. The trio fought for the United States in the Spanish–American War.\nFile:Concord, Massachusetts - Spanish American War Monument.JPG|Spanish War monument\nReferences"
