The term also pertains to the recovery time for ovens to return to their preset cooking temperature after being opened.\nBy cooking medium\nBoiling and blanching\n]]\nBoiling water has a recovery time which occurs when food is added to it, particularly large amounts of food. Methods to reduce recovery time are to use a larger quantity of water, cooking a lesser amount of food at a time, and using a stronger heat source. Industrial and restaurant blanching equipment is susceptible to a recovery time, in which the blanching liquor requires time to reheat to its preset cooking temperature.\nDeep fryer\nDeep fryers have a recovery time after food is cooked in them. A faster recovery time shortens the cooking time, which lessens the amount of oil absorbed into the deep fried foods. This results in a superior product compared to deep fried foods that are highly saturated with oil, and also reduces the amount of oil needed to be re-added to the deep fryer. The use of a 1:6 ratio of food content relative to oil content has been demonstrated to minimize recovery time in deep fryers.\nOven\nOvens have a recovery time after being opened. Opening an oven door can reduce the temperature within an oven by up to 50°F (30°C). Methods to reduce oven recovery time include the placement of a baking stone or pizza stone, tiles made of ceramic, or a brick insert device in an oven, all of which serve to reduce recovery time through their heat retention properties.\nSee also\n*\nReferences"
