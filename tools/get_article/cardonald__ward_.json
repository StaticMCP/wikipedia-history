For the 2017 Glasgow City Council election, the name was changed (Craigton is the name of a historic estate and was used as a ward name in past versions of the town authority, but in modern times the urban neighbourhood known by that name did not fall within its boundaries, whereas the whole of the larger Cardonald district did) although the territory and councillor numbers remained the same.\nBoundaries\nLocated in the southwest of Glasgow, the ward includes Cardonald as well as Hillington, Halfway, Penilee, Mosspark, Corkerhill, the northern part of Crookston (known as Rosshall) and the northern part of Pollok (the Lyoncross/Templeland area north of the Levern Water, the rest of the district coming under the Greater Pollok ward).\nThe ethnic makeup of the Cardonald ward using the 2011 census population statistics was:\n*93.8% White Scottish / British / Irish / Other\n*4.1% Asian\n*1.3% Black (Mainly African)\n*0.7% Mixed / Other Ethnic Group\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=6; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=4|Alistair Watson(Labour)\n|rowspan=6; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=6|John Matthew Kerr(Labour)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Ruth Black(Solidarity)\n|rowspan=6; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Iris Gibson(SNP)\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Jim Torrance(SNP)\n|-\n!2012 by\n|rowspan=4|Alex Wilson(SNP)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=3|Elaine McSporran(SNP)\n|-\n!2017 by\n|rowspan=2|Jim Kavanagh(Labour)\n|-\n!2022\n|}\nElection results\n2022 Election\n2022 Glasgow City Council election\n2017 Election\n2017 Glasgow City Council election\n2017 by-election\nLabour counsellor Alistair Watson died suddenly on 29 June 2017.
