It was released by Brave Entertainment on June 17, 2021. The album marks the group's first album release since their 2017 extended play Rollin'. The lead single \"Chi Mat Ba Ram\" was released in conjunction with the EP.\nBackground and release\nFollowing the sudden success of the group's 2017 single \"Rollin' in early 2021, Brave Entertainment stated that the group would release new material during the summer. On June 7, 2021, Brave Entertainment unveiled that the group's fifth extended play, titled Summer Queen would be released on June 17, marking their first new material since \"We Ride\" in August 2020, and first EP release single Rollin' in March 2017.\nOn June 29, 2021, The Brave Entertainment CEO purposely 'leaked' a snippet of the Chi Mat Ba Ram (Acoustic Version). This would end up being featured on the repackaged album as its second track. On July 9, 2021, Brave Girls released the Piano Version of Summer By Myself as a standalone single. This was later added to the repackaged album as the fourth and final track. On August 4, 2021, Brave Entertainment confirmed that Brave Girls would be releasing a repackaged album, but could not give more details at the time. On August 8, 2021, Brave Girls officially announced the plans to release a repackage of the album on their official Twitter. The Repackage, titled ''After 'We Ride', was released on August 23, 2021, with the lead single of the same name, as well as an accompanying music video.\nTrack listing\n;  Swish of a Skirt\n| lyrics1 =\n| music1 =\n| extra1 =\n| length1 = 3:37\n| title2 = Pool Party\n| note2 = featuring E-Chan of DKB\n| lyrics2 =\n| music2 =\n| extra2 =\n| length2 = 3:12\n| title3 = Summer by Myself\n| note3 =\n| lyrics3 =\n| music3 =\n| extra3 =\n| length3 = 2:54\n| title4 = Fever\n| note4 = ; : Saturday Night Fever\n| lyrics4 =\n| music4 =\n| extra4 =\n| length4 = 3:25\n| title5 = Chi Mat Ba Ram\n| note5 = English version\n| lyrics5 =\n| music5 =\n| extra5 =\n| length5 = 3:37\n}}\n;  Drinking Habits (After We Ride)\n| lyrics1 =\n| music1 =\n| extra1 =\n| length1 = 3:32\n| title2 = Chi Mat Ba Ram\n| note2 = acoustic version\n| lyrics2 =\n| music2 =\n| extra2 =\n| length2 = 3:45\n| title3 = Fever\n| note3 = remix\n| lyrics3 =\n| music3 =\n| extra3 =\n| length3 = 3:31\n| title4 = Summer by Myself\n| note4 = piano version\n| lyrics4 =\n| music4 =\n| extra4 =\n| length4 = 3:09\n|}}\nAwards and nominations\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Award and nominations for Summer Queen''\n|- align=center\n!scope=\"col\"| Year\n!scope=\"col\"| Organization\n!scope=\"col\"| Award\n!scope=\"col\"| Result\n!scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n| align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\" | 2021\n| Melon Music Awards\n| Album of the Year\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n| Mnet Asian Music Awards\n| Album of the Year\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2022\n| Seoul Music Awards\n| Bonsang Award\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|}\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Chart (2021)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |South Korean Albums (Gaon)\n|3\n|}\nMonthly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2021)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |South Korean Albums (Gaon)\n| 14\n|}\nCertification and sales\n|}\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!Country\n!Date\n!Label\n!Format\n!Ref.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Various\n| June 17, 2021\n| Brave Entertainment\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|}\nReferences"
