The accolade is presented at the Brit Awards, an annual celebration of British and international music. The honourees are determined by the Brit Awards voting academy with over one-thousand members, which comprise record labels, publishers, managers, agents, media, and previous winners and nominees. The award is presented to an artist with \"phenomenal global sales\" during the eligibility period and, as of 2025, can be awarded to both British and international performers.\nHistory\nThe award was first presented at the 2013 Brit Awards and was then presented annually until 2019. On 10 February 2025, it was announced that the award would be revived and presented to Sabrina Carpenter, who would become the first international artist to receive the honour.  The BBC suggested that the decision to revive an award for which only British acts had previously been eligible and present it to Carpenter was \"a thinly-veiled ploy\" to get her to perform at the ceremony and that the decision had only been taken because \"they needed something to honour Sabrina\".\nRecipients\n]]\nhas been selected to receive the award twice.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Recipient(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2013\n| rowspan=2|One Direction\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2015\n| Sam Smith\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2016\n| rowspan=2|Adele\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2017\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2018\n|rowspan=2| Ed Sheeran\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2019\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2020\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2021\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2022\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2023\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2024\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2025\n| Sabrina Carpenter\n|}\nArtists with multiple wins\n2 wins\n*Adele\n*Ed Sheeran\n*One Direction\nReferences"
