It depicts the aftermath of the Battle of Hastings in 1066 during the Norman Conquest of England, where the English monarch Harold Godwinson was defeated and killed in the fighting.\nHistory and description\nThe painting shows a famous scene as Edith the Fair, accompanied by some monks, scoured the battlefield for her husband, the fallen Harold. Edith, in the company of an older woman, and a monk, both point to the dead body of the king. He is lying in a broken palisade, partially naked, with a sheet hiding his face which has been disfigured by an arrow.\nBritish historical themes were very fashionable in France during the Restoration era, particularly those of Walter Scott. Vernet produced several paintings including this one.\nIt was one of several historical paintings Vernet exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1827. In 1828 it was exhibited in London at William Armfield Hobday's gallery in Pall Mall. Today it is in the collection of Musée Thomas-Henry in Cherbourg.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Fahy, Everett (ed.) The Wrightsman Pictures.
