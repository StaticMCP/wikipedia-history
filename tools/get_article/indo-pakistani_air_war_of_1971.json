This air war was waged on both the Western Front (India and West Pakistan) and the Eastern Front (India and East Pakistan). The air engagements played a vital role in shaping the war's outcome and demonstrated significant advancements in aerial warfare tactics.\nBackground\nThe war was part of the broader Bangladesh Liberation War, which had begun earlier in March 1971. The Pakistan Army launched Operation Searchlight to suppress the Nationalist Movement, killing thousands of people and forcing Bengalis to become refugee at India. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the most prominent leader of Bengal had declared the Independence of Bangladesh right after the Operation, resulting the official start of Bangladesh Liberation War.\nThe air war had begun after Pakistan launched Operation Genghis Khan in the Western Front, provoking a direct war with India. The Indian Air Force reportedly got engaged in the aerial warfare right after the operation on 3 December 1971.\nCommanders\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ **Pakistan Air Force Commanders in the 1971 War**\n!

The attack turned out to be a failure, as IAF suffered minimal damages and the damages were repaired overnight. This attack was retaliated by India forces, as India was officially in a war with Pakistan from that day.\nIndian Counteroffensive\nIn response to Pakistan's initial strikes, the IAF launched a massive retaliatory campaign against PAF airfields in Chaklala, Murid, Mianwali, Sargodha, Chandhar, Risalewala, Rafiqui, Masroor and Shorkot Road. Over the next two weeks, the IAF engaged in heavy air combat with the PAF, achieving substantial victories in air-to-air engagements and ground-attack operations.\nKey Battles in the West\nBattle of Longewala: On 5 December, IAF Hawker Hunter jets destroyed Pakistani armored columns in the Thar Desert, halting Pakistan’s offensive.\nAir Superiority Battles: The IAF employed MiG-21s, Hawker Hunters, and Su-7s to counter Pakistani F-86 Sabres, Mirage III, and the F-104 Starfighter, achieving favorable kill ratios.\nBombing of Karachi: On 8 December, IAF Canberra bombers struck Karachi Port oil storage tanks, causing massive fires and crippling Pakistan’s fuel reserves.\nAir War on the Eastern Front\nIndian Air Superiority\nUnlike the Western Front, the Eastern Front saw the swift and overwhelming dominance of the IAF. The Pakistan Eastern Air Command, headed by Air Marshal Inamul Haque Khan, only consisted of one squadron of F-86 Sabres, which was unable to retaliate Air offensive of the IAF, which deployed MiG-21s, Su-7s, and Hunters.\nKey Battles in the East\nEarly in the war, the IAF bombed Tejgaon and Kurmitola airbase on 4 December, effectively neutralizing PAF operations in East Pakistan. The IAF provided crucial close air support (CAS) for the Indian Army and Mukti Bahini advancing into Dhaka.\nThe Tangail airdrop was a crucial airborne operation during the 1971 war, where Indian paratroopers were dropped near Tangail to capture the Poongli Bridge. Launched on December 11, 1971, using 46 IAF aircraft, the mission successfully secured the bridge, cutting off Pakistani forces and accelerating the Indian Army's advance toward Dhaka.\nBy 10 December, the remainder of the PAF had fled to Burma and the IAF had total air superiority over East Pakistan, allowing for unhindered operations that led to the Fall of Dhaka by 16 December 1971.\nAircraft Used\nIndian Air Force\nMiG-21 (Interceptor and dogfighter)\nSukhoi Su-7 (Ground attack)\nHawker Hunter (Multirole)\nHAL HF-24 Marut (Ground attack)\nFolland Gnat (Interceptor)\nMil Mi-4 (Troop transport and airborne assault)\nPakistan Air Force\nF-86 Sabre (Fighter-bomber)\nMirage III (Interceptor and strike aircraft)\nF-104 Starfighter (High-speed interceptor)\nB-57 Canberra (Bomber)\nC-130 Hercules (Transport operations)\nMil Mi-8 (Troop transport and assault)\nOutcome and Impact\nThe Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 ended with an Indian victory. The IAF gained complete air superiority in the Eastern Theater and significant operational advantage in the Western Front. The PAF lost approximately 75 aircraft, while the IAF lost around 45—65 aircraft, marking a costly conflict for both sides. However, India's strategic use of air power was a major factor in the war’s outcome, leading to Pakistan’s surrender on 16 December 1971 and the creation of Bangladesh.\nReferences"
