Germany initially did not participate in ESSOR, developing instead its own SDR system, Streitkräftegemeinsame, verbundfähige Funkgerät-Ausstattung.\nConsortium\nThe work of development is being carried out by a consortium of private companies, one from each member country, including Thales (FR), Leonardo (IT), Indra Sistemas (SP), Radmor (PL), Bittium (FI) and Rohde & Schwarz (DE).\nSee also\n* Permanent Structured Cooperation\n* Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/32079/pesco-overview-of-first-collaborative-of-projects-for-press.pdf Description]"
