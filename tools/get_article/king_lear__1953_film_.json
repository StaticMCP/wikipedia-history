Preserved on kinescope, it aired October 18, 1953, as part of the CBS television series Omnibus, hosted by Alistair Cooke. The cast includes Micheál Mac Liammóir and Alan Badel.\nProduction\nA heavily abridged version of the play, this production condensed the play by eliminating the characters of Edgar and Edmund. To compensate for their absence, the role of Oswald is expanded to take Edmund's part in the play's climax, and \"Poor Tom\" is included not as a disguised Edgar but as an actual madman.\nWelles returned to America to star in this presentation.  He was guarded by IRS agents, prohibited to leave his hotel room when not at the studio, prevented from making any purchases, and the entire sum (less expenses) he earned went to his tax bill. Welles returned to England after the broadcast.\nCast\n* Orson Welles as King Lear\n* Natasha Parry as Cordelia\n* Arnold Moss as Duke of Albany\n* Bramwell Fletcher as Earl of Kent\n* David J.
