Many famous explorers include Christopher Columbus, Hernán Cortés, and Ferdinand Magellan.\nReasons to Explore\nWhen Europeans embarked on these journeys, they wanted to explore for 4 main things, these were: God, Gold, Glory,and Goods\nGod -\nEuropean monarchs and explorers often saw their voyages as a way to spread their faith and establish Christian dominance, particularly in competition with other religions like Islam. The Crusades had fostered a sense of religious fervor and a desire to expand the Christian world.\nGold -\nThe pursuit of wealth and resources was a significant driver. Europeans sought new trade routes to Asia for spices and other valuable goods, and they were also drawn to the Americas by the promise of precious metals like gold and silver.\nGlory -\nEuropean monarchs and their explorers competed for power and influence. Establishing new colonies and trade routes in distant lands boosted a country's prestige and national identity. Individual explorers also sought fame and fortune for themselves.\nGoods -\nThe demand for spices like pepper, cinnamon, and nutmeg in Europe was immense. These spices were not only used for flavoring food but also as medicine, and they were highly valuable. Europeans sought to find direct sea routes to Asia, where these spices originated, to control the trade and avoid the high costs and intermediaries of the existing land routes.\nReferences"
