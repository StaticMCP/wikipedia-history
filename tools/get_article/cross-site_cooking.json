But if this security vulnerability requires e.g. an administrator password which  does not know, cross-site cooking could be used to fool innocent users to unintentionally perform the attack.\nCross site. Cross-site cooking is similar in concept to cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery, cross-site tracing, cross-zone scripting etc., in that it involves the ability to move data or code between different web sites (or in some cases, between e-mail / instant messages and sites). These problems are linked to the fact that a web browser is a shared platform for different information / applications / sites. Only logical security boundaries maintained by browsers ensures that one site cannot corrupt or steal data from another. However a browser exploit such as cross-site cooking can be used to move things across the logical security boundaries.\nOrigins\nThe name cross-site cooking and concept was presented by Michał Zalewski in 2006. The name is a mix of \"cookie\" and \"cross-site\", attempting to describe the nature of cookies being set across sites.\nIn Michał Zalewski's article of 2006, [https://archive.today/19990129060744/http://www.nihongo.org/snowhare/ Benjamin Franz] was credited for his discovery, who in May 1998 reported a cookie domain related vulnerability to vendors. Benjamin Franz published the vulnerability and discussed it mainly as a way to circumvent \"privacy protection\" mechanisms in popular browsers.  Michał Zalewski concluded that the bug, 8 years later, was still present (unresolved) in some browsers and could be exploited for cross-site cooking. Various remarks such as \"vendors [...] certainly are not in a hurry to fix this\" were made by Zalewski and others.\nReferences\nExternal links"
