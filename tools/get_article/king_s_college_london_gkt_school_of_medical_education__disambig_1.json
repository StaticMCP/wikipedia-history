The school has campuses at three institutions, Guy's Hospital (Southwark), King's College Hospital (Denmark Hill) and St Thomas' Hospital (Lambeth) in Londonwith the initial of each hospital making up the acronymous name of the school. The school in its current guise was formed following a merger with the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals on 1 August 1998.\nThe medical school has an annual intake of around 400 places on the standard MBBS Programme, 50 places on the Extended Medical Degree Programme (EMDP) and 23 places on the Graduate/Professional Entry Programme (GPEP), and an additional 2 places on the GPEP course for Maxillofacial (MaxFax) Entry. The intake numbers vary year to year. It receives more applications for medicine than any other UK medical school and  applicants were required to sit the University Clinical Aptitude Test.\nThe medical school is also home to the world's oldest hospital gazette, originally published in 1872 as the ''Guy's Hospital Gazette, which continues to run under the name GKT Gazette''.\nName\nThe school was named the \"GKT School of Medicine\" between 1998 and 2005. However, due to confusion over the official name of the institute, especially with regards to research emerging from the university, it was rebranded as the \"King's College London School of Medicine and Dentistry at Guy's, King's College and St Thomas' Hospitals\".\nIn 2015, to reflect the strong history of the multiple institutions that comprise the medical school, the school once again rebranded as the \"King's College London GKT School of Medical Education\".\nHistory\nand William Woolnoth]]\nThe hospitals associated with King's College London GKT School of Medical Education, i.e., Guy's Hospital, King's College Hospital and St Thomas' Hospital (hence the GKT name and abbreviation), are: \"amongst the oldest hospitals in the world, having endured the Black Death, the plague, the War of the Roses, the Great Fire of London, the Blitz and over 60 years of NHS reforms.\"\nOf the GKT School of Medical Education teaching hospitals, St Thomas' Hospital is the oldest and was founded in 1173 but whose roots can be traced to the establishment of St Mary Overie Priory in 1106. Thomas Guy, a governor of St Thomas', founded Guy's Hospital in 1721 as a place to treat 'incurables' discharged from St Thomas'.\nSt Thomas's Hospital Medical School was founded in 1550 and was sited across St Thomas' Hospital and Guy's Hospital. In 1769 it was decided that Guy's would teach mainly medical subjects, whereas St Thomas' would focus on surgery and the joint teaching institution was generally known as The Borough Hospitals. However, a dispute between the two hospitals regarding the successor to Sir Astley Cooper resulted in Guy's Hospital establishing its own medical school in 1825. After this, students of surgeons attended operations at both hospitals until 1836. A riot between students of the two hospitals broke out in the operating theatre at St. Thomas's in 1836 which ended the arrangement. St Thomas's Hospital Medical School and Guy's Hospital Medical School were two of the oldest and most prestigious medical schools in the UK.\nIn 1982, the two medical schools merged to form the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals, more commonly known as UMDS. It was enlarged in 1983 when the Royal Dental Hospital of London School of Dental Surgery merged with Guy's Hospital Dental School, and again in 1985 with the addition of the Postgraduate Institute of Dermatology.\nInitially, students of UMDS were allocated to one of the two campuses, with most preclinical teaching and all clinical teaching being separate. With the intake of 1989, students ceased being allocated in this way, and teaching for all students was divided between the campuses and their peripheral hospitals.\nDiscussions between King's College London (which had trained medical students since its establishment and founding of its own hospital, King's College Hospital, in 1840) and UMDS regarding a further merger began in 1992. UMDS was subsequently absorbed into King's College London on 1 August 1998, forming the ''Guy's, King's and St Thomas' School of Medicine, more commonly known as GKT. In 2005, the entity was rebranded as the King's College London School of Medicine and Dentistry at Guy's, King's College and St Thomas' Hospitals'' (KCLMS). However, it is still widely known as GKT amongst current students, graduates, and consultants who consider themselves affiliated to the hospitals rather than the university.\nIn 2005, the dental school became the Dental Institute and the remainder was renamed the King's College School of Medicine.\nBefore the start of the 2010/11 academic year, Physiotherapy became a part of the School of Medicine, having previously been run by the School of Biomedical and Health Sciences.\nHospitals\nKing's College London GKT School of Medical Education is associated with the following hospitals:\n* Guy's Hospital\n* St Thomas' Hospital\n* King's College Hospital\n* Maudsley Hospital\n* University Hospital Lewisham\n* Bethlem Royal Hospital\n* Evelina London Children's Hospital\nIt is also associated with several peripheral hospitals around the South East of the UK, including Medway Maritime Hospital, William Harvey Hospital and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital. Students are required to spend at least part of their training at these peripheral locations.\nFile:Guy's Tower, Guy's Hospital - geograph.org.uk - 1623716.jpg|Guy's Hospital\nFile:St Thomas Hospital from the Thames.jpg|St Thomas' Hospital\nFile:King's College Hospital.jpg|King's College Hospital\nFile:Maudsley Hospital Main Building.jpg|Maudsley Hospital\nFile:Bethlem Royal Hospital Main building view 1.jpg|Bethlem Royal Hospital\nFile:University Hospital Lewisham Riverside02.jpg|University Hospital Lewisham\nFile:Evelina Children's Hospital at St Thomas's Hospital - geograph.org.uk - 571179.jpg|Evelina Children's Hospital\nCampuses\nGuy's Campus\nGuy's Campus is situated close to London Bridge and the Shard on the South Bank of the River Thames. It holds New Hunt's House Library and building, Hodgkin Building and Wills' Library, Henriette Raphael House and Guy's Hospital.\nThe nearest Underground station is London Bridge.\nSt Thomas' Campus\nThe St Thomas' Campus in the London Borough of Lambeth, facing the Houses of Parliament across the Thames, houses parts of the School of Medicine and the Dental Institute. The Florence Nightingale Museum is also located here. The museum is dedicated to Florence Nightingale, the founder of the Nightingale Training School of St Thomas' Hospital (now King's Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery). St Thomas' Hospital became part of King's College London School of Medicine in 1998. The St Thomas' Hospital and Campus were named after St Thomas Becket. The Department of Twin Research (TwinsUk), King's College London is located in St. Thomas' Hospital.\nThe nearest Underground station is Westminster.\nDenmark Hill Campus\nDenmark Hill Campus is situated in south London near the borders of the London Borough of Lambeth and the London Borough of Southwark in Camberwell and is the only campus not situated on the River Thames. The campus consists of King's College Hospital, the Maudsley Hospital and the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN). In addition to the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, parts of the Dental Institute and School of Medicine, and a large hall of residence, King's College Hall, are situated here. Other buildings include the campus library known as the Weston Education Centre (WEC), the James Black Centre, the Rayne Institute (haemato-oncology) and the Cicely Saunders Institute (palliative care), the world's first purpose-built institute for palliative care\nThe Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute was opened by the Princess Royal in 2015 at the Denmark Hill Campus. It is named after British philanthropist Maurice Wohl, who had a long association with King's and supported many medical projects.\nThe nearest Overground station is Denmark Hill.\nAdmissions\nKing's College London, generally in 2005, is the sixth-most difficult UK university to gain admission to, as ranked as Sunday Times. A freedom-of-information request in 2015 revealed that for every 1,764 applications that School of Medical Education received, only 39 offers were made thereby resulting in an offer rate of just 2.2%. For other subjects: Nursery & Midwifery, Physiotherapy and Clinical Dentistry also had one of the lowest offer rates of 14%, 16% and 17%, respectively.\nGraduation\nPriory, medical students' graduation are held at Southwark Cathedral]]\n''Also see Graduation Dress of King's College London''\nGraduation ceremonies for School of Medical Education are normally held in June or July (summer). During summer graduation, the graduation ceremonies are held in Southwark Cathedral; this is owing to St Thomas's Medical School roots that could be traced to St Mary Overie Priory. For those who happen to finish during January (winter), graduands could opt for attending the graduation ceremonies held in the Barbican Centre.\nResearch\nThe School's research excellence is recognised worldwide and the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise confirmed King's as one of the top two universities in the UK for health research strength. Around 70 per cent of health science submissions from King's were ranked in the top six within the UK.\nCurrently, the School hosts six MRC Centres,\n* MRC-Asthma UK Centre in Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma\n* MRC Centre for Developmental Neurobiology\n* MRC Centre for Neurodegenerative Research\n* MRC Centre for Social Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry\n* MRC Centre for Transplantation\n* MRC-HPA Centre for Environment and Health (awarded in 2009 in collaboration with Imperial College London)\n* MRC National Institute for Medical Research (MRC NIMR) including the MRC Biomedical NMR Centre (planned to move to the new Francis Crick Institute in 2015, a partnership between the MRC, Cancer Research UK, Imperial College London, King's College London, the Wellcome Trust and University College London)\nThe two MRC Centres in Transplantation and the Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma in 2008 alone were awarded 'Centre of Excellence' status by the British Heart Foundation with funding of £9&nbsp;million and a £4&nbsp;million Breakthrough Breast Cancer Unit was opened in 2009.\nThe School is also host to its own 'Centre of Medical Law and Ethics', the first of its kind in the UK, and in March 2009, the school was accredited as an Academic health science centre, one of only five in the UK.\nSports teams\nLike other medical schools in the UK, GKT has its own sports teams which compete in various student sports leagues and tournaments.\nLike most other universities in London, GKT sports teams take part in the BUCS leagues and cups and the University of London Union leagues and cups. The GKT teams also take part in the United Hospitals Cup, which is a sporting competition played between the medical, dental and veterinary schools of London in all sports. The two most popular and biggest of the competitions include the United Hospitals Bumps (rowing) and the men's rugby.\nGKT has a fierce sporting rivalry with King's College London. This rivalry led to the founding of the Macadam Cup in 2004, which pits GKT and KCL sports teams against each other. The championship is named in honour of Sir Ivison Macadam, an alumnus of King's. So far in Macadam Cup's history, the GKT Team has the most wins.\nNotable alumni, academics and staff\nFile:Thomas Armitage.jpg|Thomas Armitage\nFile:Richard Bright physician.jpg|Richard Bright\nFile:Astley Paston Cooper 4.jpg|Astley Cooper\nFile:Richard Doll.jpg|Richard Doll\nFile:Havelock Ellis cph.3b08675.jpg|Havelock Ellis\nFile:Abraham_Gesner_Photo.png|Abraham Pineo Gesner\nFile:John Hilton (surgeon).jpg|John Hilton\nFile:Thomas Hodgkin photo.jpg|Thomas Hodgkin\nFile:Frederick Gowland Hopkins nobel.jpg|Frederick Gowland Hopkins\nFile:Takaki Kanehiro.jpg|Takaki Kanehiro\nFile:John Keats by William Hilton.jpg|John Keats\nFile:Lister Joseph.jpg|Joseph Lister\nFile:Maugham_retouched.jpg|W.
