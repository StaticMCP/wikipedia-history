Knott   (born 1972) is an English historian of women, gender and maternity, and of America and the Atlantic world since the seventeenth century. She is the Hillary Rodham Clinton Professor of Women's History at the University of Oxford and a Professorial Fellow of St John's College.\nAcademic career\nKnott was educated at Colchester Royal Grammar School before completing her undergraduate studies at Magdalen College, Oxford, graduating in 1993. She moved to the University of Pennsylvania to earn her MA on a Thouron Scholarship, but returned to Oxford for her DPhil. Her doctoral work explored the concept of sensibility during the American Revolution and was completed in 1999 at St Hugh's College.\nAfter earning her doctorate Knott worked as a research fellow on the Leverhulme Trust-funded project \"Feminism and Enlightenment 1650-1850: A Comparative History\" which was directed by Barbara Taylor and sponsored by both the University of East London and Royal Holloway, University of London. In 2005 Taylor and Knott published an edited collection based on their research, Women, Gender and Enlightenment, with Palgrave Macmillan.\nFunding for the project ended in 2001, at which point Knott joined the faculty of Indiana University Bloomington as Assistant Professor of History.

She also held a Mellon postdoctoral research fellowship at the Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture.\nKnott's first monograph, based on her doctoral research, was published in 2009 by the University of North Carolina Press. In 2019 she published Mother: An Unconventional History with Sarah Crichton Books, which has since been translated into five languages. 2020 saw the publication of a supplement of the journal Past & Present titled ''Mothering's Many Labours, edited by Knott and Emma Griffin.\nKnott has previously served as both associate and acting editor of the American Historical Review and has sat on the editorial board of Past & Present'' since 2013.\nIn August 2024 Knott returned to the University of Oxford as the second Hillary Rodham Clinton Professor of Women's History at St John's College, succeeding the inaugural holder of the chair, Brenda Elaine Stevenson.\nMedia work\nKnott has reviewed books on the history of motherhood for The Guardian, The Times Literary Supplement and BBC History Magazine.
