The arms of France were adopted by the Capetian kings only in the twelfth century. Consequently, the cadet branches that had branched off in earlier periods (Burgundy, Vermandois, Dreux and Courtenay) bore entirely different arms.\nToday, many coat of arms of places in France are derived from the royal arms of the French king.\nFrench royal family\n{| class=wikitable width=\"100%\"\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"width:206px;\"| Figure\n!
