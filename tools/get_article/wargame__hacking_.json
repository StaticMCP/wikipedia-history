The NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) organizes an annual  event, Locked Shields, which is an international live-fire cyber exercise. The exercise challenges cyber security experts through real-time attacks in fictional scenarios and is used to develop skills in national IT defense strategies.\nAdditional applications\nWargames can be used to teach the basics of web attacks and web security, giving participants a better understanding of how attackers exploit security vulnerabilities. Wargames are also used as a way to \"stress test\" an organization's response plan and serve as a drill to identify gaps in cyber disaster preparedness.\nSee also\n* Hackathon - computer programming marathon\n* DEF CON -  largest  hacker convention\n* Software Freedom Day - Linux and Open Source event\n* Campus Party - massive LAN Party\n* Cyberwarfare preparedness\n* CTF\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.wechall.net WeChall] – list of wargame websites\n* [http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/3592/what-hacking-competitions-challenges-exist security.stackexchange.com] - hacking competitions\n* [http://ctftime.org CTFtime] - worldwide CTF tracking site"
