It recognizes service in response to a crisis within the United States.\nCriteria\nThe PHS Crisis Response Service Award is awarded to officers who participate in a USPHS Commissioned Corps deployment as part of a designated response to a crisis within the United States. The USPHS Commissioned Corps defines a \"crisis\" response as one which responds to a natural or man-made disaster and which the Surgeon General of the United States has determined establishes eligibility for the award. To qualify, an officer must serve in a deployment away from his or her regular duty assignment, be deployed for at least 14 consecutive days, and deploy in the designated USPHS Commissioned Corps uniform unless the Surgeon General exempts him or her from the uniform requirement.\nAn officer may receive only one award of the Crisis Response Service Award for participation in the same crisis response regardless of the number of deployments he or she makes as part of the designated response.\nThe USPHS Commissioned Corps recognizes analogous service outside the United States with the Public Health Service Global Response Service Award.\nSee also\n* Awards and decorations of the Public Health Service\n* Awards and decorations of the United States government\nReferences"
