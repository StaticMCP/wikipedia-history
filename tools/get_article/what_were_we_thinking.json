Reviewers appreciated the balanced critique of both liberal and conservative perspectives on the Trump presidency. Additionally, Lozada's examination of broader themes, such as political polarization and institutional failures, was noted as a significant contribution to understanding the intellectual and cultural responses to Trump's time in office.\nSee also\n* Carlos Lozada (journalist)\n* Bibliography of Donald Trump\nReferences"
