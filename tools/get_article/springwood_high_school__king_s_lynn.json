It was formed by the merger of several schools when the government began to abolish the tripartite system in the mid-1960s. Springwood has over 1700 pupils, including a sixth form with over 300 pupils and has been designated a Specialist Performing Arts College.\nOfsted consistently rate the school as \"Good\", the most recent inspection having been in November 2022.\nHistory\nSpringwood was formed in 1979 by the merger of the Alderman Catleugh Secondary School and the King's Lynn Girls High School. The name Springwood was chosen for the newly formed school due to the main site being adjacent to the Spring Wood.\nAt the beginning of the 2010–11 academic year, Andrew Johnson took over as headteacher from Peter Hopkins, who had been part of the school since 1995.\nSpringwood is part of the West Norfolk Academies Trust, a group of four secondary schools and seven primary schools.\nSite\nThere were three sites for the school, the old Alderman Catleugh at the end of Queensway with its two wings and in excess of 20 mobile classrooms, the new block of the girls High School also on Queensway and a smaller original site of the girls High School located in King Street in the town centre.  The two main sites were used for 11 - 16 schooling whilst the town centre site was used for the Sixth Form, the King Street site eventually being sold off for a housing complex and the main two sites being upgraded and extended.\nCurriculum\nThe school runs a three-year Key Stage 3, leaving two years for students to prepare for GCSEs.\nOfsted reported in 2017:Pupils learn within a calm, orderly environment and enjoy positive relationships with their teachers and with each other. They speak articulately and with confidence, wear their uniform with pride, and treat the school site with respect. Leaders and teachers emphasise the importance of academic achievement; pupils respond to these high expectations by working diligently – often with evident enthusiasm.\nSee also\n*King's Lynn Academy\n*King Edward VII Academy\n*St Clement's High School\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.springwoodhighschool.co.uk/ School Website]\n*Government Schools [https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/Establishments/Establishment/Details/136515 Information]\n*2011 Ofsted Inspection [http://www.springwoodhighschool.co.uk/resources/ofsted/Ofsted2011Final.pdf Report]"
