Inc. announced that the PlayStation Vita game was cancelled due to the game's development falling behind schedule and other \"various circumstances\".\nReception\nJacob Chapman from Anime News Network heavily panned Rail Wars! for being \"pure fantasy and not even exciting fantasy\" with its alternate version of the Japanese National Railway system, \"fanatical infatuation\" with Japanese train history and embarrassing fanservice innovation, calling it \"a show fueled by uninteresting trivia, buffeted by desperate attempts at sex appeal and action-movie excitement on a shoe-string budget.\" By the series' end, he concluded that: \"If you're a train and fanservice aficionado and have missed the ride so far, you might as well check it out now before it's completely (and deservedly) forgotten by the world.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*"
