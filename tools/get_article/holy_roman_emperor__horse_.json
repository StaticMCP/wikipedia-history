He was a leading two-year-old racehorse, winning four races from seven runs in Europe in 2006.\nBackground\nHoly Roman Emperor was sired by Danehill out of a Secretariat mare. Holy Roman Emperor was trained by Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle.\nRacing career\nIn 2006 Holy Roman Emperor won two Group One races, the Phoenix Stakes where he defeated the Coventry Stakes winner Hellvelyn and subsequent Group One winning filly Miss Beatrix and the Prix Jean-Luc Lagardère where he defeated the useful French colt Battle Paint. He also defeated subsequent three-year-old mile champion Excellent Art producing a blistering turn of foot to win the Group Two Railway Stakes at the Curragh.\nHis greatest rival was Teofilo, to whom he finished runner-up twice, firstly in the National Stakes, and later in the Dewhurst Stakes. There was great anticipation of another year of races between the pair, but it was decided in March 2007 to retire Holy Roman Emperor to stud as a replacement for George Washington, who was suffering fertility problems (and was also a son of Danehill).\nStud career\nHoly Roman Emperor has been a \"shuttle stallion\" for Coolmore Stud, standing at Coolmore's main farm in Ireland during the Northern Hemisphere breeding season and travelling to Coolmore's Australia farm to cover mares during the Southern Hemisphere breeding season, but for the 2013 breeding season stands only in Ireland.\nHoly Roman Emperor's first runner in the UK or Ireland, High Award trained by Tommy Stack won at the Curragh on March 21, 2010. On 6 May 2012, Holy Roman Emperor's daughter Homecoming Queen won the 1000 Guineas.\nIn the Year 2014, Designs On Rome, who was later voted as the Hong Kong Horse of the Year, won the Hong Kong Classic Cup, Hong Kong Derby and Queen Elizabeth II Cup.\nNotable stock\nHoly Roman Emperor is the sire of 14 individual Group 1 winners:\nc = colt, f = filly, g = gelding\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n| width=\"35px\" | Foaled\n| width=\"120px\" | Name\n| width=\"35px\" | Sex\n| width=\"310px\" | Major wins\n|-\n| 2008\n| Rich Tapestry\n| g\n| Santa Anita Sprint Championship\n|-\n| 2008\n| Smashing\n| f\n| Indian Oaks\n|-\n| 2009\n| Homecoming Queen\n| f\n| 1000 Guineas Stakes\n|-\n| 2009\n| Rollout The Carpet\n| f\n| New Zealand 1000 Guineas\n|-\n| 2010\n| Designs On Rome\n| g\n| Hong Kong Classic Cup Hong Kong Derby Queen Elizabeth II Cup Hong Kong Gold Cup (twice)\n|-\n| 2010\n| Morandi\n| c\n| Critérium de Saint-Cloud\n|-\n| 2011\n| Beauty Only\n| g\n| Hong Kong Mile\n|-\n| 2011\n| Be Safe\n| c\n| Indian Derby\n|-\n| 2011\n| Glorious Empire\n| g\n| Sword Dancer Stakes\n|-\n| 2011\n| Mongolian Khan\n| c\n| New Zealand DerbyAustralian DerbyCaulfield Cup,\n|-\n| 2011\n| Sheidel\n| f\n| Oakleigh Plate\n|-\n| 2015\n| Romanised\n| c\n| Irish 2,000 Guineas Prix Jacques Le Marois\n|-\n| 2015\n| Well Timed\n| f\n| German Oaks\n|-\n| 2016\n| Rockemperor\n| c\n| Joe Hirsch Turf Classic Stakes\n|}\nReferences"
