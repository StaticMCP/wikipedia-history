Krishnaswamy of The Indian Express wrote, \"If Ilankeswaran is dull, it is because the Rama story gets neither epic or lyrical treatment\". He concluded, \"The mythological all but died with A. P. Nagarajan, but could do without a sham resurrection that has turned out to be the last rusted nail in its coffin\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
