It is a small, epiphytic or occasionally terrestrial, scandent, sparsely branched shrub with up to 10 m long branches. The elliptic to ovate-elliptic leaves are 4–10 cm long and 1.5–3.5 cm wide; the androecium consists of 10 stamens. The fruit—a bright purple, smooth, subglobose berry—is edible. Formally described by John Ball in 1884, the species is native to the tropical lowland and montane forests of Panama, Colombia, and Ecuador. The IUCN conservation status is least concern (LC), and it is uncommon in cultivation.\nReferences"
