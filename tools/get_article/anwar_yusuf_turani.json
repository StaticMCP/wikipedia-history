He served as president of the organization until 2004. Turani organized demonstrations, conferences and cultural events concerning the situation of East Turkistan. He also met with many international dignitaries, including U.S. President Bill Clinton, the Dalai Lama and Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian, in an attempt to gain their support in ending the occupation of his nation.\nIn April 1996, Turani met with Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, forging an alliance between East Turkistan and Tibet against the Chinese government. Later that month, Turani and representatives of occupied Tibet and Inner Mongolia organized an Independence Walk from the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C. to the United Nations in New York City. At the end of the two-week walk, Turani spoke in front of the United Nations headquarters, addressing Chinese human rights violations in East Turkistan since 1949.\nIn June 1997, with the support of the Tibetan Independence Movement, Turani cut one of the five stars from the national flag of China in front of the United Nations.

The letter expressed the U.S. government's willingness to protect the \"fundamental human rights -- the rights to freedom of association, assembly, religion, belief, conscience, and expression -- of Uyghurs and others living in China.\"\nEast Turkistan Government in Exile\nOn September 14, 2004, Uyghurs and Kazakh members of the diaspora proclaimed the creation of the East Turkistan Government in Exile (ETGE) in Washington, D.C. and Turani was elected Prime Minister.

Turani claimed that he faced an \"attempted coup\" on July 28, 2005 by ETGE officials who sought to \"overthrow\" him. Turani claimed to have expelled those against him and continued to run his own government since then.
