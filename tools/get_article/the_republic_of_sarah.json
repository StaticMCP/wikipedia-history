Soon, Lydon Industries' mining trucking is ready to destroy the picturesque hamlet and people's property in the name of greed. Edgy high school history teacher Sarah Cooper and her fellow townspeople are not happy, even though Lydon is promising to build them new homes. And the conflict is even more personal for Sarah, whose lawyer brother Danny has returned to Greylock after years of radio silence to lead the charge on behalf of Lydon.  When the governor gets eminent domain over the town's public property, allowing Lydon to begin mining, Sarah comes up with a crazy plan: The town should claim independence, courtesy of a mapping loophole. Joining Sarah's mission are a trio of high school students: L.A. transplant Maya, who has been sent to live with her gay dad, introspective outsider Tyler and the mayor's daughter/popular girl Bella. The latter two hit it off when Tyler gives Bella a ride home after she ditches her jerky jock boyfriend.\n| LineColor       = 392A22\n}}\n| Viewers         = 0.38\n| ShortSummary    =  Two months later, Sarah is released from federal prison when her mom bails her out, and Governor Taggert of New Hampshire cuts off Greylock's power. Desperate to get power back, Sarah tries to talk to power companies, but they all refuse, worried about their contracts with New Hampshire. After Bella tells Sarah about the wind farms she plans to visit on the sophomore trip to Montreal, and Sarah decides to go talk to a French power company in Quebec to get power, with Bella helping to translate. However, the price is too high, and Sarah is forced to let Lydon Industries drill on three plots of land, one of which is right under Grover's house, which he built by himself as a wedding gift for his late wife. After agreeing to the deal and telling a hurt Grover, the power comes back on. Also, when Bella's dad finds out about her helping Sarah, he bans her from going to Montreal. Tyler stays behind with her and he and Maya create a poster to bring Montreal to her, and Maya apologizes to Bella for being cold.

Sarah tries to talk to different council members, but to no avail. Ellen finds out Danny's engaged, and tells Sarah, who distances herself from her brother. The teenagers protest against the borders, only to get arrested and detained. They're released with no charges when Sarah and AJ go to get them. Sarah decides to smuggle basic supplies for her citizens through water, and AJ takes the boat to the other side, but ends up in Concord prison when it sinks. Grover burns down his own house that night to have control over something for once. Soon after, the borders are temporarily opened, and Corrinne takes Josh to go get medical help, due to his diabetes. When Bella, Tyler, and Maya tell Sarah about their small protest and its positive response online, Sarah realizes that's the reason Governor Taggert opened the borders temporarily. In response, she organizes a town-wide protest, and she's arrested at the end of it. All charges are dropped when the protest goes viral, and Sarah is released from prison. She goes to negotiate a deal with the governor--if the latter reopens the borders on both sides, Sarah will let the governor get the credit for the truce. Governor Taggert agrees to it, and lets the borders remain open.
