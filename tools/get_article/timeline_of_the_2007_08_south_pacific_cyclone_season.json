      "text": "# Timeline of the 2007–08 South Pacific cyclone season\n\nThe 2007–08 South Pacific cyclone season was a below-average season with only four tropical cyclones, forming within the South Pacific to the east of 160°E. The season officially ran from November 1, 2007, to April 30, 2008, although the first cyclone, Tropical Depression 01F, formed on October 17.\nWithin the South Pacific, tropical cyclones are monitored by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji, and the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) in Wellington, New Zealand. RSMC Nadi attaches an F suffix to tropical disturbances that form in or move into the South Pacific. The United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issues unofficial warnings within the South Pacific, designating tropical cyclones with a number and a P suffix. RSMC Nadi and TCWC Wellington both use the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale, and measure wind speeds over a period of ten minutes, while the JTWC measures sustained winds over a period of one minute and uses the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale.\nThis timeline includes information from post-storm reviews by RSMC Nadi, TCWC Wellington and the JTWC. It documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. Reports among warning centers often differ; as such, information from all three agencies has been included.\nTimeline of storms\nOctober\n;October 17\n:1800 UTC, (0600 FST, October 17)&nbsp;– RSMC Nadi reports that Tropical Disturbance 01F has formed about 880&nbsp;km (545&nbsp;mi) to the northwest of Port Vila, Vanuatu.\n:2100 UTC, (0900 FST, October 17)&nbsp;– RSMC Nadi reports that Tropical Disturbance 01F has intensified into a tropical depression.\n;October 19\n:0900 UTC, (2100 FST)&nbsp;– RSMC Nadi issues the final advisory on Tropical Depression 01F.\nNovember\nalt=An area of poorly organized convection.\nalt=A track-map of a tropical depression moving from Vanuatu through the Southern Pacific Ocean\n;November 1\n*0000 UTC, (1200 FST)&nbsp;– The 2007–08 South Pacific cyclone season officially begins.\n;November 20\n*1800 UTC, (0600 FST, November 21)&nbsp;– RSMC Nadi reports that Tropical Depression 02F has formed about 310&nbsp;km (190&nbsp;mi) to the northeast of Nadi, Fiji.\n;November 22\n*2100 UTC, (0900 FST, November 23)&nbsp;– RSMC Nadi issues the final advisory on Tropical Depression 02F, as it rapidly dissipates to the southeast of Fiji.\n;November 24\n*2100 UTC, (0900 FST, November 25)&nbsp;– RSMC Nadi reports that Tropical Disturbance 03F has formed about 390&nbsp;km (240&nbsp;mi) to the west of Port Vila, Vanuatu.\n;November 25\n*0600 UTC, (1800 FST)&nbsp;– RSMC Nadi reports that Tropical Disturbance 03F has intensified into a tropical depression.\n;November 27\n*2100 UTC, (0900 FST, November 28)&nbsp;– RSMC Nadi reports that Tropical Depression 03F has weakened into a tropical disturbance.\n;November 28\n*0000 UTC, (1200 FST)&nbsp;– RSMC Nadi reports that Tropical Disturbance 03F has re-intensified into a tropical depression.\n*2100 UTC, (0900 FST, November 29)&nbsp;– RSMC Nadi reports that Tropical Depression 03F has weakened into a tropical disturbance.\n;November 30\n*0900 UTC, (2100 FST)&nbsp;– RSMC Nadi reports that Tropical Disturbance 03F has re-intensified into a tropical depression.\nDecember\nalt=A tropical cyclone within the Fijian Islands.
