The mission in turn was given to Lieutenant colonel George Shuffer and his 2/2nd Infantry. Shuffer established a Task Force consisting of his unit plus Troop A, 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment and Battery C, 2nd Battalion, 33rd Artillery Regiment. Shuffer divided Highway 13 into 3 sectors each secured by a company and with the command group, cavalry and artillery in the middle sector. Each day patrols would be sent out to sweep the Highway and its surroundings and they would withdraw into night defensive positions.\nThe commander of the VC 9th Division, Senior Colonel Hoàng Cầm decided to attack the American forces, gathering his units on the afternoon of 11 November. The main target would be the central American unit located just south of the village of Bau Bang, with the main assault by the 272nd Regiment supported by mortars and recoilless rifles and elements of the 271st Regiment. While the 273rd Regiment would attack from the south and block Highway 13 to the south preventing any reinforcement, while the 7th Battalion would be held in reserve.\nBattle\nOn the night of 11 November two mortar rounds hit Shuffer's central position and a night ambush killed two VC. During this time the VC completed their preparations for their attack, placing heavy weapons in and around the village as well as laying wires for field telephones around the American positions.\nAt 06:05 on 12 November, as Shuffer's forces prepared to start patrolling Highway 13, the VC launched their attack. Starting with a barrage of 50 mortar rounds, a battalion of VC attacked from the southwest. The attack was quickly met by return fire from Troop A's M113s which broke up the attack. A second attack from the south and a third attack from the southeast were similarly beaten back by the waiting American force.\nAt 07:00 what might have been the VC main attack was launched from the village of Bau Bang to the north. Initially penetrating the American position, this attack was also repulsed. Battery C used its guns in anti-personnel mode firing 55 rounds at ground level with two second fuses. Air strikes by United States Air Force A-1Hs and United States Navy A-4s were directed against the VC mortars and recoilless rifles positioned in and around Bau Bang.\nAt 09:00 the VC launched a final assault from the north, but were met with concentrated artillery fire and air strikes. By 13:30 the VC had abandoned their attacks and withdrawn.\nAftermath\nTotal U.S. casualties were 20 killed and 103 wounded, while VC losses were 146 killed (body count) and a further 50 were believed to have been killed, but the bodies were removed. The 2/2nd Infantry and attached units received a Valorous Unit Award for this action.\nVietnamese sources only acknowledged 109 killed and over 200 wounded for the VC and claimed to have killed or wounded 2,000 Americans and destroyed 39 tanks and eight heavy artillery pieces.
