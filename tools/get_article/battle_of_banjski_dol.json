The small size of the detachment forced its commander, Captain Andrei Bucharestliev, to withdraw to the Kukla newspaper. In order for the division to continue its attack, a complete deployment of its vanguard units was required. The detachment did not wait for the attack and withdrew again, this time to the village of Dolna Nevlya.\nInstead of continuing the attack in the direction of Nesla-Gaber-Aldomirovtsi-Slivnitsa, the Shumadia division settled around the village of Borovo, and the main forces spent the night in the border area near the village of Banski dol.\nThe task of the Dolnonevlyansky covert detachment is to deploy and reconnoiter the enemy, slowing him down and inflicting maximum losses on him. The detachment, under the command of Captain Bucharestliev, managed to successfully complete the given task, and for the entire first day of hostilities the division managed to enter only 4&nbsp;km. in the territory of the Principality of Bulgaria.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n* '' 'Stanchev' ,  'S.'
