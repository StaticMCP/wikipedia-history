It covered an area of , and existed as a local government entity from 1881 until 2008, when it amalgamated with neighbouring Shire of Blackall to form the Blackall-Tambo Region.\nThe council consisted of a Mayor and 9 elected councillors. No wards or electoral divisions existed.\nThe Barcoo River travels through the shire's former area on its way to Cooper Creek and eventually Lake Eyre. Like much of the west, sheep became the mainstay of the economy. Today, cattle and tourism are of major importance to the region.\nHistory\nKargoolnah Division was created on 11 November 1879 as one of 74 divisions around Queensland under the Divisional Boards Act 1879, and included the areas of Blackall, Tambo and Barcaldine and parts of Jericho. On 30 June 1881, a new Tambo Division was proclaimed and excised from Kargoolnah Division.\nOn 11 October 1883, there was an adjustment of boundaries between Tambo Division and Murweh Division.\nWith the passage of the Local Authorities Act 1902, Tambo Division became the Shire of Tambo on 31 March 1903.\nOn 15 March 2008, under the Local Government (Reform Implementation) Act 2007 passed by the Parliament of Queensland on 10 August 2007, the Shire of Tambo merged with the Shire of Blackall to form the Blackall-Tambo Region.\nTowns and localities\nThe Shire of Tambo included the following settlements:\n* Tambo\n* Bayrick\n* Caldervale\n* Landsdowne\n* Lumeah\n* Macfarlane\n* Minnie Downs\n* Mount Enniskillen\n* Scrubby Creek\n* Windeyer\n* Yandarlo\nChairmen\n* 1927: James Miller\nPopulation\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
