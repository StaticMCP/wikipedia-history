The term Lanmi translates to \"man of war\" or \"warrior\" in the Meitei language. The institution of Lanmi played a central role in Manipur’s military system and cultural heritage, especially during its time as an independent kingdom before its integration into Republic of India.\nHistorical background\nManipur was historically an independent kingdom ruled by Meitei monarchs. Its strategic location and frequent conflicts made it necessary for the kingdom to develop a strong and well-organized military force. The foundation of the Lanmi system coincided with the establishment of a centralized administrative structure, notably during the reign of King Meidingu Punshiba (1404–1432).\nThe military department created under Punshiba was called Shingchep Meira Haijouroi (Torch Swingers). The Lanmis served the king during royal processions and also took part in battles. They carried traditional arms such as swords, spears, and shields and also had ceremonial roles during peace times.\nRoles and duties\nIn times of war, Lanmis fought as skilled warriors. During peace, they took on various roles including:\n* Crafting bamboo items and constructing buildings\n* Organizing and clearing sites for rituals\n* Attending royal animals like elephants and horses\n* Guarding criminals and convicts\n* Catching specific birds and animals for ceremonial purposes\nIt was customary that husbands of the king’s daughters were not allowed to join the Lanmi ranks. Lanmis also participated in specialized rituals and festivals, including Ayang Chatpa, which involved religious offerings and taboos.\nMilitary organization\nThe Meitei army, including the infantry, was organized using a decimal system, similar to that of the Mughals. The basic unit was a regiment of 1,000 soldiers, originally called a fauji or doli, later known as a tuli. The entire army was made up of 13 tulis, each with its own name and command.\nEach Tuli was divided into several Lups (companies). A Tuli usually had 7 to 17 companies. Each Lup was led by a Lakpa, and below him were various officers including Hidang Hanjaba, Thangsuhanba, Thangsunaha, Tenshuhanba, Tenshunaha, and Meiraba. During the British period, ranks like Captain, Subedar, and Jamadar were also used. The commander of a Tuli was called Lallup Chingba or Tulinaha Major.\nUnder King Garibaniwaj (1709–1748)\nThe military of Manipur reached its peak during King Garibaniwaj’s rule. He established a formal military structure with three main branches:\nInfantry\n, a warrior leader in the Meitei infantry]]\n, a warrior leader in the Meitei infantry]]\n, the Maharaja of Kangleipak (Manipur Kingdom)]]\nKhong Lanmi (), also known as Khongmi Lanmi (), refers to the infantry or foot soldiers of the Meitei traditional army. It was one of the three main divisions of the military, along with Sagol Lanmi (cavalry or horsemen) and Hi Lanmi (naval or boat army).\nThe Khong Lanmi were the most numerous and important branch of the Meitei military forces. These infantry soldiers were trained to engage in direct hand-to-hand combat and often faced enemies fearlessly, sometimes fighting against several opponents at once.\nThe Khong Lanmi were recruited through the Lallup system, a type of compulsory military service. All able-bodied Meitei males aged 17 or 18 to 60 years were trained as soldiers. They had to serve the state for 10 days out of every 40 days, ensuring the kingdom had a constant supply of well-trained troops.\nThe infantry used both traditional and modern weapons, especially in different historical periods. Common weapons included:\n* Thang (sword)\n* Ta (spear)\n* Langshoi (club or blunt weapon)\n* Tapak (broad-tipped spear)\n* Oblong shields\n* Shingjang (axe)\n* Naori (sling)\nFrom the late 16th century, firearms began to be used. King Mungyamba brought guns from Khamral (Burma or China) in 1584 C.E. Later, King Khagemba used guns against enemies in Cachar kingdom and Tripura kingdom. In Pamheiba’s reign (1709–1748), bell metal cannons called Sen Kamran were used. By 1825, Raja Gambhir Singh received 1,500 muskets from the British, indicating further modernization of the army.\nAt various points in history, the infantry had a significant strength:\n* King Garibaniwaj had 13,000 well-equipped foot soldiers and an additional 7,000 auxiliary troops.\n* The Manipuri army had a total of 13 regiments (Tulis), each with about 1,000 soldiers.\nThe thirteen regiments of Khong Lanmi included:\n1. Tulihal\n2. Tuliyaima\n3. Tulinaha\n4. Bhitna Tuli\n5. Vishnu Senahal Tuli\n6. Vishnu Naha Tuli\n7. Top Tuli\n8. Loya Tuli\n9. Kang Tuli\n10. Kangnao Tuli\n11. Oinamlong Tuli\n12. Naya Tuli\n13. Bamdiyar Tuli\nThe Khong Lanmi were not just a military force but also an integral part of Meitei society. The Lallup system tied military duty to citizenship, ensuring that military service was both a responsibility and a rite of passage for all Meitei men.\nCavalry\nSagol Lanmi (Cavalry):\n* Elite horsemen, known for their agility and combat skills\n* Famous for using the Arambai (dart-like weapon)\n* Wore specific uniforms including kokyets (turbans), Lanphi (war cloth), and greaves\n* Used in major battles against external enemies like the Awa (Burmese)\nNavy\nHi Lanmi (Boat Army):\n* Used boats for warfare in marshy terrains and rivers\n* Conducted operations on the Ningthi River and Barak River\n* Boat races (Hiyang Tannaba) were held annually as both training and entertainment\nDepartments related to military production\n, the Maharajah of Kangleipak]]\nSeveral departments existed to support the military, each with specialized roles:\n* Khut-heiba: Made bows, arrows, and ceremonial flags\n* Thangsa Hanba: Produced spear handles, shields, and iron parts\n* Thangsaba: Worked as blacksmiths, making swords and other weapons\n* Arambai-making teams: Involved leather workers, cane workers, and archers\nweapons]]\nRituals connected to war and hunting\nTraditional Meitei culture integrated rituals into military life to maintain spiritual balance and honor:\n* Yenbum Huiroi Chanba: For absolving sins from improper kills\n* Lanchak Thakpa: Performed by descendants to cleanse ancestors’ war sins\n* Nungoibi Lallu Chanba: Offering skulls to a female deity after war\n* Lanmi Yanba: Ritual \"defeat\" of the enemy’s commander before actual battle\n* Keiyang Thekpa: Ritual after capturing a tiger\n* Lanbao Tamba: Reporting war success to state deities\n* Thenggou: Spear dance performed by heroes and generals for success\n* Ougri: Sacred chant used for blessing the kingdom or cursing enemies\nMilitary rewards and honors\nManipur had a structured reward system for warriors and hunters:\n* For capturing enemies in war:\n** Honors ranged from shirts of honor to being gifted a royal wife\n** Highest honor was Thangballoi, signifying the capture of 100 enemies or animals\n* For capturing animals:\n** Rewards included land, salt, ceremonial items, and sometimes royal honors\nMartial omens and predictions\nBefore going to war, ancient Meiteis practiced various forms of divination:\n1. Leichillon Kanglon Yengba: Observing cloud shapes for omens\n2. Shaya Miren Yengba: Examining one's shadow or reflection to predict fate in battle\nLegacy\n]]\nDuring the monarchical era, martial training and military service were essential for all able-bodied men in Manipur. The Lanmi system not only protected the kingdom but also defined Meitei identity and pride.\nIn modern times, these traditions have largely faded, but there is growing interest in preserving and reviving Manipur's ancient martial culture. Many scholars and cultural activists advocate for teaching the younger generations about the martial heritage of the Lanmi and its role in shaping Manipur’s history.\nGallery\nThe tableau of Manipur passes through the Raj path during the 61st Republic Day Parade-2010, in New Delhi on January 26, 2010.jpg\nHiyang Tannaba — Classical Dragon Boat Racing (in the imperial moat of the Kangla Fort of Imphal) — Cultural heritage of Meitei civilization — Living tradition of Ancient Kangleipak (early Manipur) — 1891 British artwork.jpg\nPaona Brajabashi.jpg\nAn exhibition of a Sagol Kangjei (Meitei Classical Polo) match & a demonstration of ‘Arambai’ (Meitei martial iron tipped peacock feathered weapon) in a pologround of the Marjing Polo Complex, during the G20 summit.jpg\nAn artwork of the Lainingthou Sanamahi Kiyong shrine, a Meitei cavalry or horse soldier holding a 7 coloured Meitei cultural flag representing 7 clans (Yek Salai 7) on Meetei Sagol (Meitei horse or Manipuri pony).jpg\nSculpture of Meitei king Meidingu Nara Singh, the Maharaja of Kangleipak (Manipur Kingdom), installed in the MMRC and Unity Park, Khangabok, Thoubal.jpg\nVisiting the Kangla Fort.jpg\nSee also\n* Shamu (Meitei culture)\n* Meitei confederacy\n* Pana (Meitei culture)\n* Meitei martial arts\n*Meitei traditional martial arts\n** Thang Ta\n** Sarit Sarak\n** Cheibi\n* Meitei traditional weapons\n* Meitei traditional toys\n* Meitei traditional games\n* Meitei royal etiquette\n* Anglo Manipuri Treaty (1762)\n* Manipur Levy\n* Anglo Manipuri Treaty (1833)\n* Agreement Regarding Compensation for the Kubo (Kabaw) Valley (1834)\n* Anglo-Manipur War\n* Ahom–Meitei relations\n** Kuranganayani\n** Meitei people in Assam\n*** Induprabha\n* Burmese–Meitei relations\n** Chakpa Makhao Ngambi\n** Seven Years' Devastation (Chahi Taret Khuntakpa)\n** Meitei people in Myanmar\n** Meitei–Shan relations\n* Takhel Ngamba\n** Meitei queens of Tripura\n** Meitei people in Tripura\n* Meitei people in Bangladesh\nNotes\nReferences"
