A. Salvatore. It is set in the world of Corona, primarily in the kingdoms of Honce-the-Bear and Behren, and amongst the nomadic To-gai-ru. The series is separated into two trilogies connected by a single book, Mortalis. The saga has an accompanying roleplaying game entitled Demon Wars.\nThe first trilogy\nThe Demon Awakens\nDivided by the catastrophe and the destruction of their village, Dundalis, Elbryan Wyndon and Jilseponie \"Pony\" Ault struggle to sort out their lives. Elbryan is taken in by the Touel'alfar, the winged elves of Corona, while Pony makes her way to the city of Palmaris where she is raised by the Chilichunks, a husband and wife who own a tavern in the city.  Meanwhile, Avelyn Desbris comes to terms with the all-too-human brothers of the Abellican Church and the myriad injustices he witnesses them cause.\nDuring their time apart, Elbryan is trained by the Touel'alfar as a ranger and takes on the name Nightbird, while Pony becomes a barmaid at the Chilichunk's tavern, Fellowship Way, and eventually enters into the military after marrying the nobleman Conner Bildeborough, before rejecting him on their wedding night, annulling it. Avelyn learns to use powerful gemstone magic, but leaves the Church after finding it to not be the holy place he had hoped for and receiving a vision of the awakened Demon Dactyl.\nElbryan and his friends recruit the people of the Timberlands, whose homes have been destroyed by the demon's army, and train them into a guerrilla fighting force. With them, the three attack the enemy, but it becomes apparent that the only way to truly stop the encroaching darkness is to defeat the dactyl itself. They journey to the Barbican and Mount Aida to face the dactyl, and it is defeated at the cost of Avelyn sacrificing himself.\nThe Demon Spirit\nEven with the destruction of the Dactyl Bestesbulzibar, its servants continue to roam the land wreaking havoc. Elbryan, Pony, and the small group of fighters they have recruited, defeat the demon's army as best they can. They discover that their friend Bradwarden, who they thought was dead, is still alive and taken by the Church. The Chilichunks are also captured as a means to lure Pony out so that Father Abbot Markwart can take back the Ring Stones stolen by Avelyn.\nThe Church no longer has a solid foundation; Master Jojonah is a high-ranking member of the Church and a former teacher of Avelyn.  He sees the rot in his beloved institution and works quietly to bring about Avelyn's truth, which leads to his death as Elbryan and his companions free Bradwarden.\nThe Demon Apostle\nElbryan travels north to reclaim the Timberlands while Pony heads south to the city of Palmaris. Eventually, Elbryan, Pony and their companions confront Markwart, his lackey Marcalo De'Unnero, and the spirit of Bestesbulzibar. In the end De'Unnero is defeated, Markwart is slain, and Bestebulzibar's spirit flees again. Elbyran succumbs to wounds inflicted in his battle with Marcalo.\nMortalis\nPony copes with Elbryan's death and fights against a plague infecting the people of the kingdom. Aydrian Wyndon, Elbryan's and Pony's child, and Brynn Dharielle, a To-Gai girl turned ranger, are introduced to the story.\nThe second trilogy\nAscendance\nThe plans of the Touel'alfar go awry due to Aydrian's own arrogance, cultivated by a dark force.\nTranscendence\nBrynn Dharielle embarks on a quest to free her people from the tyranny of the Behrenese kingdom.\nImmortalis\nThe final novel of the DemonWars Saga brings all of the main characters from the previous two books together to combat the evil still residing in the land.\nCharacters\nElbryan Wyndon\nThe nephew of ranger Mather Wyndon, he was taken in and trained by the Touel'alfar, the winged elves of Corona.  After several years of training under his mentor and close friend Belli'mar Juraviel, he is given the name Nightbird and is charged to defend the lands of the North against the armies of Bestesbulzibar, the Demon dactyl.  Alongside his mate and later wife Pony and her mentor, former Abellican Brother Avelyn Desbris, Elbryan goes to Mount Aida and defies the dactyl.\nAfter this victory, Elbryan leads the resistance against the remaining evil forces and takes the fight to the corrupt leadership of the Abellican Church that betrayed Avelyn.  He is killed in the final battle against the Church after fighting the Bishop of Palmaris Marcalo De'Unnero. He is given a national funeral and recognized as a ranger even greater than his uncle was.\nDuring the final days of the war between Pony and her son Aydrian (who was also possessed by the demon), the young man summons his father's zombie-spirit to defeat his mother. Pony awoke Elbryan's consciousness from within the zombie and they banish Bestesbulzibar from Aydrian's body.  After Pony's death, Aydrian breaks the spell protecting Andur'Blough, the hidden valley of the elves, and destroys what remains of Bestesbulzibar.\nJilseponie \"Pony\" Wyndon Ursal\nPony is Elbryan's childhood friend.

After joining the army, she meets former Abellican Brother Avelyn Desbris, who had run away from the Church with hundreds of gemstones, the source of their power.

Avelyn remains with the resistance run by Elbryan and Pony, using his magic to defeat the hordes of goblins, giants and  that served as the Dactyl's armies.\nAvelyn is killed during his duel with the Dactyl in Mount Aida where he destroys the Demon's physical form. Bishop Francis Delacourt of Palmaris, once the Father Abbot's most trusted advisor and staunch anti-Avelynist, recommends to Bishop of Honce-the-Bear, Je'howeth, that Avelyn be canonized as a saint of the Abellican Church. His teachings help change the Abellican Church for the better.\nAydrian Wyndon\nAydrian Wyndon is Elbryan and Pony's son. He was taken and raised secretly by Lady Dasselrond, the Queen of the Touel'alfar. The elves had allowed Pony to believe her child had died in the womb in her spirit battle with Markwart. Also kept secret from all, including the elves, was that the Demon Dactyl's spirit had infected the child's soul and left a piece of itself there.\nAydrian is raised under the harsh tutelage of the elves. From a very young age he begins his ranger training, and Lady Dasselrond also trains him to use the magic gemstones, being the only elf to possess a stone and have any knowledge with using them.\nAydrian demonstrates he is as good of a fighter as his father and as powerful as his mother with the magic gemstones, if not more. Under the guidance of the Demon Dactyl's spirit, he is able to tap deeper into the magic gemstones than anyone in history besides the legendary St. Abelle, who was the founder of the entire Abellican Order.\nAydrian leaves the elves after overpowering the queen in a magical test of wills. During his journeys he meets his parents' sworn enemy Marcalo De'Unnero (who had become a weretiger). They join forces and began to plot until Aydrian kills King Danube and takes the throne for himself. As king he threw the lands into war and is defeated by Midalis.\nDuring the battle Aydrian displays his gemstone power by bringing his father's corpse back to life. However, as his father became whole he regains control of himself and with Pony they use a soul stone to attack their son's spirit and find the Demon Dactyl there. They fight the demon as they had before and free their son. During the spiritual battle Aydrian is physically rendered frozen and has his heart pierced by Brynn Dharielle, dying shortly after being freed from the demon. Pony uses her soul stone, and with Elbryan's help they bring Aydrian back to life at the expense of Elbryan's life.\nPublication\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nCritical reception\nThe series has been reviewed positively by the sources that have critiqued it. When critiquing the series, Aiden Moher gave it a positive review, noting that \"By mixing philosophical themes about power, corruption, religion and free will with typical adventurous tropes and set pieces, Salvatore delivers a heady mix that manages to bring together so many elements of what makes secondary world fantasy so wonderful... in DemonWars the true villains are greed and corruption, fear, desire and anger. All the characters... succumb to these weaknesses\" McLaurin, when writing for SF Site also reviewed the first novel positively, noting \"If Salvatore's goal is to write books that are fun to read, he achieves it with The Demon Awakens.\" Publishers Weekly, however, when reviewing the later installment Child of a Mad God, criticised Salvatore's worldbuilding as \"lacklustre\".\nOther media\nAudiobooks\nThe audio entertainment publisher GraphicAudio has produced all seven books of The DemonWars Saga with a full cast of voice actors, narrator, sound effects and original music.\nReferences"
