Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural heritage consists of natural features (physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia accepted the convention on 7 August 1978, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. Saudi Arabia has eight sites on the list and a further fourteen on the tentative list. It has served on the World Heritage Committee once, from 2019 to 2023.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\"| Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\"| Location (province)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\"| Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Al-Hijr Archaeological Site (Madâin Sâlih)\n|\n|Al-'Ula\n|2008\n|1293; ii, iii (cultural)\n|The Archaeological Site of Al-Hijr (Madâin Sâlih) features well-preserved monumental tombs with decorated facades dating from the 1st century BC to the 1st century AD.
