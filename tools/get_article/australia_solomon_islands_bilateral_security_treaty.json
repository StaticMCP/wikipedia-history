The treaty was signed in 2017 and came into force in 2018. The treaty replaces the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) treaty which expired in 2017 when Australian personnel were withdrawn.\nThe treaty allows for Australian police, defence and civilian personnel to deploy to the Solomon Islands to assist with a range of security threats, including natural disasters, where both governments agree.\nThe treaty was invoked in November 2021 when the Solomon Islands government requested assistance from Australia to support the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force in restoring order during the 2021 Solomon Islands unrest.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/ATS/2018/14.html Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of Solomon Islands Concerning the Basis for Deployment of Police, Armed Forces, and other Personnel to Solomon Islands] - Australasian Legal Information Institute"
