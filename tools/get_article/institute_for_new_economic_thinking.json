It was launched at Cambridge King's College as a tribute to alumnus John Maynard Keynes.\nAffiliates\nIn November 2010, INET announced that about $7 million would be provided for the inaugural round of grants. Another four task groups tled by INET advisory board members were awarded more than $3 million in grants in 2010. One of these awards was to Steven Pincus of Yale and James Robinson of Harvard for research on the origins of the British Industrial Revolution. In 2011, $4 million in grants from INET and the Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI) was divided among 29 recipients. The Institute has disbursed approximately $4 million annually in research grants to students and professors.\nThe Cambridge-INET Institute (co-funded with William H. Janeway) established an advanced institute for economic thinking at the University of Cambridge, The Cambridge-INET Institute was endowed witha $3.75 million grant from INET that was matched with an additional $3.75 million grant from the Keynes Fund for Applied Economics, Isaac Newton Trust, Mohammed El Erian, the Cambridge Endowment for Research in Finance, and the University of Cambridge Faculty of Economics. Professor Sanjeev Goyal held the position of inaugural director of Cambridge-INET.
