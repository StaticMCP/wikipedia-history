Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to \"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position\".\nIn 2012, the award - then known as \"Best Regional Mexican or Tejano Album\" - was one of the new categories that resulted from the Recording Academy's wish to decrease the list of categories and awards for that year. According to the Academy, \"it was determined that musical distinctions among some of the regional Mexican subgenres were often very difficult to draw, so the restructuring in categories was warranted\". This award combined the previous categories for Best Regional Mexican Album and Best Tejano Album. Other Latin categories were also either merged or discontinued.\nFurther restructuring took place in 2012 and was implemented in the 2013 Grammy Award season. As of 2013, this category was merged with the Best Banda or Norteño Album category which had been created in 2012. According to the Academy, \"Best Banda or Norteño Album and Best Regional Mexican or Tejano Album are now merged into one category: \"Best Regional Mexican Music Album (including Tejano)\", for albums containing at least 51 percent playing time of new vocal or instrumental regional Mexican (banda, norteño, corridos, gruperos, mariachi, ranchera, and Tejano) recordings.\" The category received its current name at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards following consultation with the Mexican music community and aims to recognize and acknowledge Mexican-influenced music produced in other countries.\nAs of 2024, Mexican singer Vicente Fernandez holds the record for the most wins in this category, with three, including  one received posthumously at the 64th Grammy Award ceremony. Mariachi Divas de Cindy Shea holds the record for the most nominations, with six (one of which went on to be awarded with a Grammy). Mexican band Banda El Recodo is the most nominated act without a win, with three unsuccessful nominations.\nRecipients\nwas the first recipient of the award.]]\nwinner Lila Downs.]]\n.]]\n, including the last one in 2022 received posthumously.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"7%\" | Year\n! width=\"25%\" | Performing artist(s)\n! width=\"25%\" | Work\n! width=\"35%\" class=unsortable|Nominees\n! width=\"5%\" class=unsortable|Ref.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2012\n| Pepe Aguilar\n| Bicentenario\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2013\n| Lila Downs\n| Pecados y milagros\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2014\n| Mariachi Divas de Cindy Shea\n| A Mi Manera\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2015\n| Vicente Fernández\n| Mano a Mano – Tangos a la Manera de Vicente Fernández\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2016\n| Los Tigres del Norte\n| Realidades (Deluxe Edition)\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2017\n| Vicente Fernández\n| Un Azteca En El Azteca, Vol. 1\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2018\n| Aida Cuevas\n| Arrieros Somos – Sesiones Acústicas\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2019\n| Luis Miguel\n| ¡México Por Siempre!\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2020\n| Mariachi los Camperos\n| De Ayer Para Siempre\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2021\n| Natalia Lafourcade\n| Un Canto por México, Vol. 1\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2022\n|Vicente Fernández\n|''A Mis 80's\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2023\n| Natalia Lafourcade\n| Un Canto por México — El Musical\n|\n|\n|-\n!2024\n|Peso Pluma\n|Génesis\n|\n|\n|-\n!2025\n|Carín León\n|Boca Chueca, Vol. 1''\n|\n|\n|-\n!2026\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nSee also\n*Grammy Award for Best Banda or Norteño Album\n*Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop, Rock or Urban Album\n*Grammy Award for Best Tropical Latin Album\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.grammy.com Official Site of the Grammy Awards]"
