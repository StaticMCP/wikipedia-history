He was the grandfather of the physicist, meteorologist and geologist Robert Traill Omond FRSE (1858-1914).\nEarly life\nTraill was born at Kirkwall in Orkney, the son of the Rev Thomas Traill (died 1782), the minister in Kirkwall, and his wife Lucia. His father died the year after he was born.\nHe studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh under Dr Alexander Monro, gaining his doctorate (MD) in 1802. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1819. His proposers were Robert Jameson, John Murray, Lord Murray, and Thomas Charles Hope. He was Curator of the Society's museum from 1834 to 1856.\nHe practised medicine for 30 years in Liverpool, and was a founder of the Royal Institution of Liverpool, the Liverpool Mechanics' Institution and the Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool. He became acquainted with the Arctic explorer William Scoresby, contributing a list of animals observed in eastern Greenland to Scoresby's Journal of a Voyage to the Northern Whale Fishery (1823). Scoresby named Traill Island in Greenland for him. Mount Traill in Nigeria was named after him by William Balfour Baikie.\nIn 1812 he first suggested creation of a Royal Society of Liverpool which eventually came to fruition in 1821.\nWhen John James Audubon arrived in Liverpool in July 1826 Traill helped him to find a publisher for his The Birds of America. Audubon named the Traill's flycatcher after him, which at one time referred to a species which included both the willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii) and the alder flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum).\nAlways interested in railways, in October 1829 he and his family attended the famous Rainhill trials and saw first hand Stephenson's \"Rocket\" win the competition. During this trial he, his wife and two daughters were invited as passengers in a rival engine, the \"Novelty\" built by Braithwaite and Ericsson, one of the runners-up in the trials. This makes them possibly the first passengers on a steam train.\nUniversity of Edinburgh and the Encyclopædia Britannica\nTraill returned to the University of Edinburgh in 1832 as a professor of medical jurisprudence, and served in this role until death, also serving as President of the Royal College of Physicians in Edinburgh 1852 to 1854. In 1833 he was elected a member of the Aesculapian Club. In 1837 Traill was elected a member of the Harveian Society of Edinburgh and served as president in 1842.\nIn 1847 he replaced Macvey Napier as main Editor of the Encyclopædia Britannica (1852–61) and was creator of its 8th edition: works concluding a year before his death.\nHe was a keen (but unsuccessful) supporter of women attending the university.\nHe was President of the Royal Scottish Society of the Arts 1843–44.\nIn 1840 he was living at 10 Albyn Place in Edinburgh's Moray Estate close to Charlotte Square.\nHe died at his final home, 29 Rutland Square in Edinburgh's West End on 30 July 1862, and was interred at St Cuthbert's cemetery. The grave contains members of both the Omond family and Traill family and stands against an outer eastern wall of the southern section, under the shadows of Edinburgh Castle.\nFamily\nIn July 1811 he was married to Christian Robertson (1780-1842), daughter of Rev Harry Robertson of Kiltearn, Ross-shire and the widow of James Watson of Crantit, an Orkney factor for Lord Dundas. She had married James Watson aged 19 and had five children by him by age 28 when he died, the youngest being born after his father's death. She had a further five children with Traill, two sons and three daughters.\nTheir daughter Mary Eliza Traill married Robert Omond. Their children included Robert Traill Omond.\nThomas appears to have been cousin or second cousin to Rev Robert Traill (and shows a strong family resemblance).\nPublications\n*Thermometer and Pyrometer (1828)\n*The Medico-Legal Examination of Dead Bodies (1839) a standard textbook on postmortems co-written with Robert Christison and James Syme.\n*The Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia (12th Edition - 1841)\n*Memoir of William Roscoe (1853)\nArtistic recognition\nHis portrait by Alexander Mosses is held by the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh but rarely displayed.\nSee also\n*:Category:Taxa named by Thomas Stewart Traill\nReferences\nSources\n*Audubon to Xánthus, Barbara and Richard Mearns\nExternal links\n*\n*"
