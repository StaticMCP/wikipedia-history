They broke away from the Roman Catholic Church over their veneration of the Mexican folk saint and female deity Santa Muerte. They were primarily active in the border regions of the United States and Mexico and have a particular presence among Mexican immigrants in the United States. It was founded by David Romo Guillén, who served as its archbishop and primate. However, in 2012 he was sentenced to 66 years in prison for kidnapping and extortion.\nBeliefs and organization\nThe Traditionalist Mexican-American Catholic Church follows both the Nicene Creed and the Athanasian Creed, maintains the seven sacraments, an all-male priesthood, is open to homosexuals among the faithful and, generally speaking, is socially conservative regarding abortion but does not practice clerical celibacy, allows the use of contraceptives and does not require chastity before marriage. They also maintain their veneration of the Mexican folk saint and female deity Santa Muerte, which the Roman Catholic Church had condemned to be blasphemous and Satanic. They reject the Catholic doctrines of papal infallibility, the Immaculate Conception, and the Assumption of the Virgin Mary.\nChurch services are conducted every Sunday and attendees often invoke the name of Santa Muerte to intercede before God, rather than other saints, and leave offerings to Santa Muerte. The church follows the Catholic practices of baptism, holy communion, confirmations, weddings, exorcisms, and the praying of rosaries.\nStatus in Mexico\nDue to the connection between Santa Muerte and drug trafficking in Mexico, the Mexican federal government ruled that the Traditionalist Mexican-American Catholic Church did not have the qualifications for a religion and removed the Church from the list of officially recognized religions. Protests arose in 2006 among church members, although the Church can legally worship without recognition from the government.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090830050123/http://unicosantuarionacionaldelasantamuerte.com/ Official website]"
