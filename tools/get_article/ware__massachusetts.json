The population was 10,066 as of 2020. It is part of the Springfield, Massachusetts Metropolitan Statistical Area.\nThe census-designated place of Ware, comprising the main settlement of the town, is in the southeastern corner of the town. The area's students are served by Ware Junior Senior High School.\nHistory\nWare was first settled on Equivalent Lands in 1717[https://archive.org/details/historicalcolle04barbgoog/page/n340  Historical Collections]; John Warner Barber; Dorr; 1841. and was officially incorporated in 1775. Its name derives from the word \"weir.\" The native Americans who settled in the area would construct weirs for trapping fish on the Ware River. The English settlers pronounced the word \"ware.\"\nIn 1716, a tract of land which was slightly more than  in size was granted to John Read. He named it \"The Manor of Peace\" and had it in mind to develop in the style of an English manor, anticipating that it would later become a very valuable country estate. He leased out the land and did not sell  until after his death, when he bequeathed a gift of  to serve as a ministry lot. As time passed, the town of Ware grew up around the old Congregational meeting house and later became a small center of local manufacturing and commerce.\nIn 1729, the first grist and sawmills were built on the banks of the Weir River by Jabez Olmstead, eventually becoming part of the Ware Millyard Historic District. During the American Revolution, there were at least eight taverns and several inns in the area. Two of the most famous were Ebenezer Nye's tavern and John Downing's. After town meetings were held, they would often adjourn to the latter establishment. By the 1830s, it was not uncommon to see textile mills dotted along the various local rivers. At this point, the Ware community was making the transition from an agrarian economy to an industrially based society. The post Civil War era (1860s–1900s) brought a new prosperity to the now established textile mill town. \"Ware factory village\", as it was known, sprang up overnight and formed the basis for new growth and development.\nFor nearly 100 years, the Otis company had been the largest single Ware employer. Cotton had been the primary raw material, and by 1937 denims, awnings and tickings were the principal output. It had been very prosperous until World War I, when its employees numbered close to 2,500. By the 1920s, however, the company began to decline due to lack of modern machinery and movement of industry to the south.\nIn 1922, it was affected by the New England Textile Strike, shutting down the mills in the town over an attempted wage cut.\nBy the mid-thirties, the directors decided to liquidate, although no public announcement was made. Shortly thereafter, the company sold its interests to three \"cotton men\"—Lawrence W. Robert Jr., Edward J. Heitzeberg, and Paul A. Redmond—all with close connections to Alabama Mills, which owned factories in the South.\nInstantly, the townspeople rallied to the cause. A public mass meeting was called that evening and plans to raise the necessary cash in order to forestall what appeared to be the imminent ruin of the town were formulated. The citizens of Ware were able to purchase the mills with the backing of the Ware Trust Company. The mills became Ware Industries Inc., and Ware came to be known nationwide as \"The Town That Can't Be Licked\".\nThe town gained lands in the late 1930s as part of the construction of the Quabbin Reservoir. The reservoir dammed the Swift River in the former town of Enfield, flooding the valley. Four towns—Enfield, Greenwich, Prescott and Dana—were disincorporated in 1938 by this building of the reservoir. Much of Enfield and Greenwich became part of the town of Ware, extending the town's lands northward. Today, the town is home to most of the Winsor Dam and its spillway, and the Goodnough Dike, both of which lie within the Quabbin Reservation. Ware's portion of this land is some of the most accessible land in the reservation, with a large lookout tower atop Quabbin Hill. Ware also bears the morbid distinction of being host to the Quabbin Park Cemetery, where most of the graves in the former towns were relocated to, as well as most of the town monuments.\nHistoric districts\n*Ware Center Historic District\n*Church Street Historic District\n*Ware Millyard Historic District\nGeography and transportation\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which  are land and , or 14.01%, are water. Ware lies at the southern end of the Quabbin Reservoir and the Quabbin Reservation. The reservation lands within town include two islands, the former Little Quabbin Hill and Mount Lizzie, neither of which were covered by the waters of the reservoir. The Swift River forms the western boundary of the town, and the Ware River flows through the southeastern part of the town, meeting in Palmer to form the Chicopee River (along with the Quaboag River), which flows into the Connecticut River. The lands of Ware are hilly between the valleys of the Swift and Ware rivers, and much of the land not surrounding the central part of town is heavily forested, with marshes lining the Ware River in spots. Along the Swift River lies the Herman Covey–Swift River Wildlife Management Area.\nWare is the easternmost town in Hampshire County and is bordered by Franklin County to the north, Worcester County to the east, and Hampden County to the south. The town is bordered by New Salem to the northwest, Petersham to the north, Hardwick to the northeast, New Braintree and West Brookfield to the east, a small portion of Warren to the southeast, Palmer to the south, and Belchertown to the west. (There is no land link between New Salem or Petersham and Ware due to the Quabbin Reservoir.) Downtown Ware lies  east-southeast of the county seat of Northampton,  northeast of Springfield,  west of Worcester, and  west of Boston.\nWare has no interstates or limited-access highways, the town center being  north of Exit 63 (the Palmer exit) of Interstate 90. The town is linked to Route 9, the major east-west route through central Massachusetts, by Route 32, which runs concurrently with Route 9 from their merging point to just west of the West Brookfield town line, where Route 32 crosses through the eastern edge of Ware as it heads north. Route 9 heads west through town, passing along the edge of the Quabbin Reservation on its way towards Belchertown.\nThe town is served by the Pioneer Valley Transit Authority (PVTA)'s Ware Shuttle, which operates seven days a week and connects the Church Street Senior Center and Valley View to Ware Center, Ware Walmart, Palmer Center, Palmer Big Y, and Wilbraham Big Y; in Wilbraham, riders can transfer to other PVTA routes into Springfield. The town is also served by a commercial rail line, the Massachusetts Central Railroad, which follows the former Ware River Railroad line along the Ware River from Barre to where the line meets the Boston and Albany Railroad lines in Palmer. There is a private general aviation airstrip along Route 32 in the eastern part of town. The nearest national air service airports are Bradley International Airport in Connecticut and Worcester Regional Airport in Massachusetts.\nDemographics\n|10385\n}}\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 9,707 people, 4,027 households, and 2,597 families residing in the town.
