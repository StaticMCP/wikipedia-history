Responding to Charles' attempt to raise an army against them, an army of Covenanters crosses the Tweed and overruns an English force at the Battle of Newburn (28 August), before occupying the city of Newcastle and other parts of northern England.\n* 1640: The Treaty of Ripon (26 October) is agreed which leaves the Scots in indefinite occupation of north-east England, while receiving daily payments from England, until a final settlement is negotiated.
