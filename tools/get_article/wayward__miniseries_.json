Having enough of this behaviour and after having a fight with her father and mother when there were guests amongst them, Abbie's parents (when Abbie is asleep after getting back from strolling around with Leila) send her to Tall Pines Academy, in Vermont. Across the town, Alex and Laura move in to Tall Pines to begin their upcoming family life. They find a strange hidden room with a painted door. While on duty, Alex comes across Riley, a student who fled the academy, who follows Alex home. In the ensuing confrontation, Riley is fatally wounded, and tells Alex of written evidence of strange occurrences at the academy before dying.\n|LineColor       = 32432D\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = Abbie meets the residents and staff of Tall Pines Academy, including head teacher Evelyn, head staff Rabbit and Duck, her roommate Stacey, and Riley's alleged best friend Rory, and is introduced to the school's strict rules. Leila, learning of Abbie's location, travels to Tall Pine with her older boyfriend, Kyle, who abandons her once she reveals her intents. At Tall Pines, she meets Alex. She infiltrates the academy and briefly reunites with Abbie before being taken. At a grocery store, Alex notices odd behaviours from the townspeople. Evelyn dines with Alex and Laura, where she makes strange and cold comments about Laura's dead parents. In the room with the painted door, Alex discovers multiple blood stains on the ceiling, presumably from the floor above. Later that night, he finds Laura sleepwalking, trying to leave the house.\n|LineColor       = 32432D\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = Leila and Abbie decide to escape the facility through a meticulous plan. They participate in \"Hot Chair,\" a supposed therapy exercise in which the students criticize each other in hopes of self-improvement. Rory, deemed a pathological liar, is scolded off by the students until he suffers an emotional breakdown and is then comforted by the others. Terrified by the experience, Leila and Abbie speed up their plan, ending up locked in a flooded room with a door containing a fingernail after Oatmeal Beth tricks them. Alex discovers that the police station was previously a school. He visits the school to pick up Riley's possessions in hope of finding the written evidence he had mentioned. He encounters Abbie and Leila, who ask for help escaping. As they are discovered, Alex has Leila hit him, allowing him to secretly give Abbie a walkie-talkie so they can communicate. As punishment for hitting a police officer, Leila is subjected to the \"Mirror Room\", where she is psychologically tortured for the night. Abbie and Alex talk, after Abbie sneaks into the bathroom after lights out.\n|LineColor       = 32432D\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = Leila, alongside her roommate Ello, are made to carry rocks across a field as further punishment. She befriends her, learning she was a drug addict on her death bed before, and Ello warns her to start following the system to get out. Meanwhile, Abbie meets Rory, Riley's roommate, to find the journal. Their search in the kitchen is unsuccessful when Daniel reveals both that the journal was found earlier by Duck, who later burns it, and that Rory lied about his friendship with Riley, leaving Abbie disgusted. Alex helps Laura open a market, where he realizes the town has no children besides the ones from the academy, and that the graduates are assigned to people, not adopted. Stacey reveals she was rewarded with something called a \"Leap\", which will grant her \"total health\", something she believes will help her finally get adopted. After telling the truth about his non-relationship to Riley and apologizing, Rory helps Abbie follow Stacey, where she discovers the \"Leap\" is a drug-induced torturous ritual in the flooded room, and learns Riley is dead. After Alex and Laura fight over the latter not telling him about the lack of children in town, Evelyn visits Laura, expressing her disappointment in the idea of the two leaving the town. Later that night, Alex finds Laura sleepwalking into the local pond.\n|LineColor       = 32432D\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = During the \"Hot Chair,\" the students scold off Abbie and Leila; their relationship takes a hit when Rabbit exposes Leila's use of cocaine.

Leila and Ello begin a relationship, but Ello relapses and begins to overdose. To rescue her, Abbie stops the revolt.

She then holds a baby shower, where she requests to Evelyn to cut ties.\n|LineColor       = 32432D\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = As punishment for their revolt, the students are forced to fight for freedom by reaching the summit of the local mount. Soon after beginning, Abbie and Rory are stripped of their resources, including Rory's inhaler. They meet Daniel and Marty, who assist each other in climbing. Abbie, prioritizing her freedom over the well-beings of her fellow students, scolds Rory, but rescues him as he suffers an asthma attack. Stacey, supported by Rabbit, stabs Daniel, whose death is disguised as an escape attempt. Marty wins the competition, but his tricked reward causes him to join the others. Abbie and Rory embrace.

Martin acted as showrunner on the series alongside Ryan Scott, as well as executive producer. Production is through London- and Los Angeles–based Objective Fiction and Canada’s Sphere Media. Scott also served as executive producer alongside Ben Farrell for Objective Fiction along with Hannah Mackay, Jennifer Kawaja and Bruno Dubé.\nBrandon Jay McLaren joined the cast in May 2024. In June 2024, Sarah Gadon, Toni Collette, Patrick J. Adams, Alyvia Alyn Lind, Patrick Gallagher, Sydney Topliffe and Josh Close joined the cast.\nThe series was initially called Tall Pines. Filming began in Ontario, Canada, in mid-2024.\nThemes\nMartin said this is a story they have \"been dying to tell for years.\" Martin's best friend in high school had been sent to a school for troubled teens, like Tall Pines, for two years, and later told them \"insane stories\" about the school's \"weirdly theatrical aggressive therapy.\" Their friend's school was later shut down for abuse and neglect, and Martin eventually learned that such schools were largely unregulated and lacked transparency regarding their methods. Martin also learned that much of the troubled teen industry originated in 1970s self-help cults like Synanon, and this served as inspiration for the structure of Tall Pines. Martin's friend from high school served as a consultant for the show, and a writer on the show attended a similar school as well.\nMartin says that Abbie and Leila are based on their relationship with their high school best friend, and the show is \"like a love letter to that friendship, and to teen friendship.\" They wanted the show to produce an emotional connection in viewers rather than sharing a specific message.\nMartin said that they wrote their character, Alex, as a trans man due to the show's setting in 2003. Martin is nonbinary, but they felt that there was not much public understanding of nonbinary identities at that time, so \"who knows where I’ll end up on that spectrum?\" They described Alex as a stand-in for audience members: he is an imperfect but earnest newcomer to town, skeptical of his surroundings even as he longs to be accepted.\nMartin also wanted the show to explore the themes of acceptance and ignorance of unjust systems. Joining cults is one metaphor for this, as is Alex's hunt for acceptance and a heteronormative family life, and teenage rebellion shows a contrasting approach to injustice.\nRelease\nWayward premiered in the Primetime program at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival, in advance of its streaming release on Netflix on 25 September 2025.\nReception\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 78% approval rating based on 54 critic reviews. The website's critics consensus reads, \"An eerie mystery that eschews easy answers, Wayward can occasionally feel as listless as its title, but surprising twists and Toni Collette's committed performance keep this thriller intriguing.\" The audience score is only 47% though. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, gave a score of 71 out of 100 based on 18 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
