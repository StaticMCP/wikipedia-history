The empire was founded by\nChandragupta Maurya in 322 BCE and lasted until 185 BCE. The Mauryan Empire was the first pan-Indian empire. At its height, the empire covered most of the Indian subcontinent. The Mauryan Emperor was the monarchical head of state and wielded absolute rule over the empire.\nChandragupta's chief minister Chanakya, sometimes called Kautilya, advised Chandragupta Maurya and contributed to the empire's legacy. Bindusara, Chandragupta's son, assumed the throne around 297 BCE. He kept the empire running smoothly while maintaining its lands. Bindusara's son, Ashoka, was the third leader of the Mauryan Empire. Ashoka left his mark on history by erecting large stone pillars inscribed with edicts that he issued. After Ashoka's death, his family continued to reign, but the empire began to break apart. The last of the Mauryas, Brihadratha, was assassinated by his Senapati, Pushyamitra Shunga who went on to found the Shunga Empire in 185 BCE.\nFamily tree\nList of emperors\n;Rulers-\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=2 | Ruler!!Reign!!Notes\n|-\n|Chandragupta Maurya (𑀙𑀦𑁆𑀤𑁆𑀭𑀕𑀼𑀧𑁆𑀢𑀸 𑀫𑀸𑀉𑀭𑁆𑀬𑀸)|| | ||322–297 BCE|| Founder of the Maurya Empire.\n|-\n|Bindusara (𑀩𑀺𑀦𑁆𑀤𑀼𑀲𑀸𑀭𑀸)|| ||297–273 BCE||Known for his foreign diplomacy and crushed of Vidarbha revolt.\n|-\n|Ashoka (𑀅𑀰𑁄𑀓𑀸)|| ||268–232 BCE||Greatest emperor of dynasty.
