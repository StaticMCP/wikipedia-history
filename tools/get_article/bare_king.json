The relative weakness of the pieces in shatranj may have made this form of a win desirable. A possible exception to the bare king rule was if the king immediately after being bared was able to recapture, leaving the opponent with a bare king as well. This situation, called a \"Medinese victory\" (because in Medina, it was still a win for the player first baring the opposing king), was often considered a draw.\nContemporary\nUnder modern rules, a player with a bare king does not automatically lose and may continue playing. A bare king can never give check, however, and can therefore never deliver a checkmate or win the game. A bare king can in some situations play to a draw, such as by stalemate, capturing the opponent's pieces to reduce his advantage to an unwinnable one or if the opponent of a bare king oversteps the time limit. If both players are left with a bare king, the game is immediately drawn.  Similarly, if one player has only a king and either a bishop or a knight while the opponent has a bare king, the game is immediately drawn.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
