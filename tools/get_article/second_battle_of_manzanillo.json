Two American gunboats attempted unsuccessfully to destroy the Spanish ships in the harbor of Manzanillo, Cuba.\nThe battle\nThe  and  arrived at Manzanillo on 1 July expecting to find an American squadron, but did not know that the squadron had fought a battle in the harbor and retired the previous day. Adolph Marix, in command, nonetheless decided to follow orders and sailed the two ships into the bay to capture or destroy any enemy shipping there. In the harbor, the American ships came across several small vessels including the  gunboats Estrella and Guantánamo, the  Delgado Parejo, and a barracks ship. The Americans then proceeded to open fire on the vessels but could not get close enough to destroy them, due to the shallow water that lay in between the harbor and the two warships. Not only did the Spanish gunboats return fire, but also infantry and artillery from the shore.\nThe Americans were outnumbered, and after Scorpion had been hit 12 times the attackers withdrew. Osceola was not hit and the Americans reported no casualties, while Spanish casualties were three men wounded aboard the pontoon María.\nAftermath\nAs had occurred the day before, the Spanish had managed to repel the American squadron. Wrote one American sailor:\nScorpion and Osceola met the American squadron which had attacked the previous day and waited for reinforcements to arrive, before finally managing to destroy the Spanish naval force at Manzanillo on 18 July.\nOrder of battle\nUnited States\nArmed tug\n*\nPatrol yacht\n*\nSpain\nGunboats\n* Estrella\n* Guantánamo\n* Delgado Parejo\nPontoons\n* Maria\n* Cuba Española\n* Guardián\nNotes\nSources\n*\n* [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B0CE1D71E39E433A2575AC0A9619C94699ED7CF \"GUNBOATS ENGAGE SPANIARDS\"], The New York Times.
