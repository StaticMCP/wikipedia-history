He is the head of the Saudi Arabian royal family, the House of Saud. The king is the commander-in-chief of the Saudi Arabian Armed Forces and the head of the Saudi national honors system. The king is called the \"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\" (; Khadim al-Haramayn aš-Šarīfayn), a title that signifies Saudi Arabia's jurisdiction over the mosques of Masjid al-Haram in Mecca and Al-Masjid an-Nabawi in Medina. The title has been used many times through the history of Islam. The first Saudi king to use the title was Faisal; however, King Khalid did not use the title after him. In 1986, King Fahd replaced \"His Majesty\" with the title of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, and it has been since used by both King Abdullah and King Salman. The king has been named the most powerful and influential Muslim and Arab leader in the world according to The Muslim 500.\nHistory\nKing Abdulaziz Al Saud, known in the West as Ibn Saud, regained his patrimony, which is known as today's Saudi Arabia, in 1902. Restoring his family as emirs of the Emirate of Riyadh, he then established the Sultanate of Nejd as his headquarters in 1922. Following the establishment of Riyadh as the capital of his state, Ibn Saud then captured Hejaz in 1925.\nIbn Saud proclaimed his dominions as the Sultanate of Nejd in 1921, shortly before completing the unification of the region. He was proclaimed king (malik) of Hejaz in 1926, and raised Nejd to a kingdom as well in 1927. For the next five years, Ibn Saud administered the two parts of his realm, the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd, as separate units. On 23 September 1932, he formally united his territories into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\nSuccession\nThe kings since Ibn Saud's death have all been his sons, and all likely immediate successors to the reigning King Salman will be from among his progeny. This makes the Saudi monarchy quite distinct from Western monarchies, which usually feature large, clearly defined royal families and orders of succession, and use the primogeniture system of succession. Muhammad bin Nayef was the first grandson of Ibn Saud to be in the line of succession before being deposed from the position of Crown Prince by a royal decree in 2017.\nOther functions\nThe king of Saudi Arabia is also considered the head of the House of Saud and, until 2021, the prime minister. The crown prince was also the \"deputy prime minister\" until 2021 and is currently prime minister. The kings after Faisal have named a \"second deputy prime minister\" as the subsequent heir after the crown prince.\nOpposition\nCriticism of the king, religious leaders, or government is not allowed and can generally mean jail time for the critics. It can also result in death.\nKings of Saudi Arabia (present)\nThis is a list of rulers of Saudi Arabia, a kingdom on the Arabian Peninsula.\nSheikhdom of Diriyah\n* 1446–1727 Sheikhdom of Diriyah\n| life1       = 1640 – 1725\n| reignstart1 = 1720\n| reignend1   = 1725(death by natural causes)\n| notes1      = Was the eponymous ancestor of the House of Saud  Son of Emir Muhammad bin Muqrin\n| family1     = Muqrin\n| image1      =\n| alt1        = Saud bin Muhammad Al Muqrin\n}}\nFirst Saudi State\n* 1744–1818 Emirate of Diriyah\n| life1       = 1687–1765\n| reignstart1 = 1727\n| reignend1   = 1765\n| notes1      = Founder of the Saudi State and Son of Saud I\n| family1     = Saud\n| image1      =\n| alt1        = Muhammad bin Saud\n| name2       = Abd al-Aziz I\n| nickname2   =\n| native2     =\n| life2       = 1721–1803\n| reignstart2 = 1765\n| reignend2   = 1803\n| notes2      = Son of Imam Muhammad I\n| family2     = Saud\n| image2      =\n| alt2        = AbdulAziz bin Imam Muhammad I\n| name3       = Saud II\n| native3     =\n| life3       = 1748–1814\n| reignstart3 = 1803\n| reignend3   = 1814\n| notes3      = Son of Imam Abdulaziz I.\n| family3     = Saud\n| image3      =\n| alt3        = Saud bin Abdul-Aziz bin Muhammad bin Saud\n| name4       = Abdullah I\n| nickname4   =\n| native4     =\n| life4       = 1785–1818\n| reignstart4 = 1814\n| reignend4   = 1818\n| notes4      = He was the last ruler of the First Saudi State and was executed by the Ottomans.
