McNear is best remembered as the original voice of Doc Adams in the radio version of Gunsmoke and as Floyd Lawson (Floyd the Barber) on The Andy Griffith Show (1961–1967).\nCareer\nMcNear studied at the Oatman School of Theater and later joined a stock company in San Diego. McNear also worked in radio from the late 1930s, including in the 1937–1940 radio serial Speed Gibson of the International Secret Police as ace operator Clint Barlow. McNear could be effective in such authoritative roles, but he gravitated more toward character roles, often comic.\nHe enlisted as a private in the United States Army Air Corps on November 17, 1942, during World War II.\nHe created the role of Doc Charles Adams on CBS Radio's Gunsmoke (1952–1961). Before and during the run, he was featured in many other CBS radio programs, such as frequent roles on the popular radio detective series Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar between 1955 and 1960. Other radio credits included appearances on the anthologies Escape and Suspense.\nMcNear made his film debut in an uncredited role in the 1953 film Escape from Fort Bravo. In 1956, he appeared in the episode \"The Pest Hole\" (S1E24) in the TV version of Gunsmoke. In a 1958 episode of Leave it to Beaver, McNear made a TV appearance as a barber named \"Andy\", who gave Wally his first shave. Over the course of his career, he would appear in over one hundred film and television guest spots. In 1959, McNear portrayed Dr. Dompierre in the film Anatomy of a Murder, who testified about collecting evidence of a rape. In a 1960 episode of Peter Gunn, titled \"A Slight Touch of Homicide\", McNear used the mannerisms he later developed as Floyd the barber to play Barnaby, a vigilante  chemist who killed 15 mobsters with explosives.\nIn 1961, McNear was cast as the vague, chatty barber Floyd Lawson on The Andy Griffith Show. In 1963, he suffered a stroke that rendered most of the left side of his body paralyzed. He left the series for nearly a year and a half to recover. Andy Griffith asked McNear to return to the series. McNear agreed despite being unable to walk or stand, and the production crew accommodated him accordingly. Floyd was subsequently seen onscreen either seated or standing with support. Many scenes were shot with him sitting on a bench outside the barber shop, as opposed to trimming hair as before. In most of his post-stroke scenes, McNear's left hand would be holding a newspaper or resting in his lap, while he moved his right arm and hand as he spoke his lines. In a 1964 episode, \"Otis Sues the County,” McNear's character is heard, but not seen, walking into the courthouse; the next scene shows Floyd already seated in a chair. In a 1966 episode, “Wyatt Earp Rides Again,” McNear, as Floyd, is shown standing at his barber’s chair using both hands to treat the hair of deputy Warren (Jack Burns); however, such appearances were rare.\nIn the seventh season finale of The Andy Griffith Show, \"Goober's Contest\", in which Floyd Lawson makes his final appearance, McNear is speaking from his parked car but an obvious double is shot from the back while driving the car away. According to Jack Dodson, who played Howard Sprague on The Andy Griffith Show, McNear began having difficulty remembering his lines and became anxious and frustrated during his last season. He left the series after the seventh season in 1967; the series would only remain for another year and Lawson's barber shop and position in the show was loosely replaced by Emmett Clark, a repairman with a fix-it shop (located where the barbershop used to be) played by Paul Hartman (who continued the role in Mayberry R.F.D.). In the eighth season episode, \"Goober the Executive,\" Andy addresses the replacement by saying \"Floyd decides he's got enough money and wants to retire, Emmett moves right in.\"\nEarlier in 1961, McNear was uncredited in the animated title role of the AT&T instructional film, Mr. Digit and the Battle of Bubbling Brook, who taught Ethel (Peg Lynch) of Ethel and Albert about the advantages of all-number calling. Alan Bunce, who played Albert, also reprised his role in that video.\nIn 1962 he made a guest appearance on The Twilight Zone in the episode \"Hocus Pocus and Frisby\". In 1964, McNear also took a role on Gunsmoke, playing Dodge City's general store owner in \"Aunt Thede\" (S10E13).\nDeath\nOn January 3, 1969, McNear died at San Fernando Valley Veterans Hospital in California at the age of 63 of complications from pneumonia caused by a stroke. He was survived by his wife Helen and his son Christopher.\nFilmography\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Film\n|-\n! Year\n! Title\n!
