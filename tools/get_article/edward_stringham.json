His dissertation was titled \"Essays on Self-Policing in Financial Markets\".\nCareer\nHe was associate professor at San Jose State University from 2002 to 2008, the F.A. Hayek Endowed visiting professor at University of Klagenfurt in 2008, and Shelby Cullom Davis visiting associate professor at Trinity College from 2008 to 2010. He has also held faculty positions at Fayetteville State University and Texas Tech University.\nHe has been the editor of the Journal of Private Enterprise since 2006. Additionally, he served as the President of the Association of Private Enterprise Education from 2006 to 2007. He has edited Anarchy, State and Public Choice (2005) and Anarchy and the Law: The Political Economy of Choice (2007).\nIn 2006, he published a study together with Bethany Peters titled \"No Booze? You May Lose: Why Drinkers Earn More Money Than Nondrinkers\" (with the Reason Foundation). For that seeming controversial statement, he made numerous television appearances. In 2009 and 2010 he published the related \"The Catastrophe of What Passes for Alcohol Policy Analysis\" and he gave testimony before the Connecticut legislature on alcohol restrictions.\nInterviews and discussions\nIn an interview with Forbes in 2019, Stringham opposed any tax and social security.\nIn May 2020, Stringham said during a CNBC interview that the unemployment rate was expected to reach 16% but that the slight improvements were already noticeable.\nIn July 2020, The Christian Science Monitor discussed the question \"Why libertarians are joining BLM calls to defund police\". Stringham pointed out a lot of parallels with the libertarians believing that the responsibilities of police departments today would be better performed by local private security bodies and suitable alternatives to state police as adopted in some other countries.\nMedia appearances\nStringham has appeared on dozens of media outlets including CNBC, Fox News, MTV, and NPR.\nBibliography\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091104211513/http://economics.gmu.edu/bcaplan/misbas.doc Mises, Bastiat, Public Opinion and Public Choice], By Bryan Caplan & Edward Stringham\n* [http://reason.org/files/42af0a281133fdcfaec166fe7318b57f.pdf No Booze?
