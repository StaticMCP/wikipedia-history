Del.) is the Federal district court having jurisdiction over the entire state of Delaware. The Court sits in Wilmington.\nBecause Delaware is the state of incorporation for most major U.S. corporations, the District of Delaware hears and tries many patent and other complex commercial disputes that must be heard in federal court for diversity of citizenship reasons, and hears many appeals from bankruptcy disputes which are filed with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.\nAppeals from the Court are heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which sits in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit).\nThe acting United States attorney for the District of Delaware is Shannon T. Hanson since January 21, 2025.\nHistory\nThe court was one of the original 13 courts established by the Judiciary Act of 1789, , on September 24, 1789. From its establishment until 1946, the court had a single judge. A temporary additional judgeship was authorized on July 24, 1946, by , and was made permanent on September 5, 1950, by . A third judge was authorized on February 10, 1954, by , and a fourth on July 10, 1984, by .\nCurrent judges\n:\nFormer judges\nChief judges\nSuccession of seats\nUnited States attorneys\nSource:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |U.S. Attorney\n!Term started\n!Term ended\n!Presidents served under\n|-\n|George Read II\n|\n|1789\n|1816\n|George Washington and John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison\n|-\n|George Read III\n|\n|1816\n|1836\n|James Monroe, John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson\n|-\n|James A.
