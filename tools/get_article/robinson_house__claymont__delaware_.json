It was built in 1723, on the site of the original settlement on Naaman's Creek.  The Block House, which stands a few yards northeast of the Robinson House, is the only remaining building from the original 1654 settlement.\nGeorge Washington, General Anthony Wayne, the Marquis de Lafayette, and \"Light Horse\" Harry Lee were all guests at the Robinson House.  From 1914 to 1964, the Robinson House was home to the Naamans Tea House.\nThe Robinson House is currently the home of the Claymont Historical Society, the Darley Society, and the Naamans Heritage Association.\nGallery\nImage:Naamans-on-Delaware.jpg|The Robinson House, image from Postcard ca 1910.\nImage:Robinson house02.jpg|Robinson House - Facing West - April 2006\nImage:Robinson house03.jpg|Robinson House Rear (right side) and Block House Rear (left side)\nImage:Robinson house04.jpg|Robinson House Sign on Naamans Road, Claymont, DE\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
