More than 100,000 people have been buried at the cemetery since its opening in 1792.\nDuring the Kościuszko Uprising of 1794 and during World War II, intense fighting took place at the cemetery. Worth seeing is the neoclassical Halpert family chapel (1835), which serves the Lutheran community. The chapel was rebuilt in 1975, however, many historic and monumental tombstones are in need of restoration. As in the Roman Catholic Powązki Cemetery, a committee for the restoration of the cemetery has been established, and collects money on All Saint's Day for the treasures of the burial ground to be returned to their former glory.\nSelected notable burials\nA few of the notable people buried here:\n* Juliusz Bursche (1862–1942), bishop of the Evangelical-Augsburg Church in Poland.
