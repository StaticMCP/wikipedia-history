The cover art uses a picture of the Crab Nebula. The title is possibly a reference to the concept of warriorship in the Shambhala tradition: the first step on the warrior's path is to become meek.\nTrack listing\n#\"Blessing Force\" – 9:29\n#\"Gone Beyond\" – 3:22\n#\"Meek Warrior\" – 2:17\n#\"No Space in This Realm\" – 5:12\n#\"Lightning Bolt of Compassion\" – 4:10\n#\"The Rider (Dolphin Song)\" – 7:20\n#\"Love and Space\" – 3:37\nReferences"
