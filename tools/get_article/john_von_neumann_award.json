The award was established in 1994 and is given annually. In 2013, separately from the annual prize, Kenneth J. Arrow was given the Honorary John von Neumann Award.\nThis award differentiates itself from other scientific awards on the basis that it is given by students of economics and various social sciences, decided after a long deliberation process. The students select the nominees and vote for the prize-winner in the Assembly of the College after a review and debate regarding the pre-selected names.\nMost of the recipients of the award have been academics working in some branch of economics - an exception is the philosopher and political theorist Jon Elster. Multiple recipients, such as Jean Tirole, Esther Duflo, and Joshua Angrist were subsequently awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics. Others like Gary Becker and John Harsanyi received the award after they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics. Kenneth J. Arrow also received the Honorary John von Neumann Award in 2013 after being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1972.\nOverall eleven recipients have received the Nobel Prize in Economics, eight after getting the Neumann-award (Tirole, Williamson, Acemoglu, Aghion, Angrist, Duflo, Thaler), and four beforehand (Harsányi, Becker, Arrow, Roth).\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin: 1ex auto 1ex auto\"\n|-\n!
