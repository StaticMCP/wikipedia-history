      "text": "# 1987 Minnesota Vikings season\n\nThe 1987 season was the Minnesota Vikings' 27th year in the National Football League. A players' strike caused the cancellation of the September 27 game at the Kansas City Chiefs, while the games played on October 4, 11 and 18 were played with replacement players. The Vikings finished with an 8–7 record.\nDespite finishing the season only one game over .500, and losing three of their final four games, Minnesota sneaked into the playoffs with the final Wild Card position. There, they won two huge upsets, beating the New Orleans Saints (12–3), and the San Francisco 49ers (13–2) on the road to advance to their first NFC Championship Game in 10 years. The Vikings were unable, however, to defeat the eventual Super Bowl champion Washington Redskins in the NFC Championship Game.\nThe last remaining active member of the 1987 Minnesota Vikings was quarterback Rich Gannon, who played his final NFL game in the 2004 season, although he missed the 1989 and 1994 seasons.\nOffseason\n1987 draft\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:lightsteelblue;border:1px solid #aaaaaa;width:2em\"|\n|Pro Bowler\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"6\" style=\"\"| 1987 Minnesota Vikings Draft\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Draft order\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Player name\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Position\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| College\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Notes\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Round\n!style=\"\"| Selection\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 1 || 14\n| D.

However, a bruised throwing arm meant he had to leave the game.  Wade Wilson then took over. The Cowboys tied it up with two touchdowns of their own in the second quarter, but another throw from Kramer to Carter, this time from 37 yards, meant the Vikings took a seven-point lead into halftime. Darrin Nelson extended the Vikings' lead with the opening score of the second half, running 52 yards for the Vikings' fourth touchdown of the game. A field goal and another touchdown for the Cowboys reduced the Vikings' lead to four points going into the final quarter, but they restored the two-score margin with a field goal from Chuck Nelson and a 1-yard run from Rick Fenney. The Cowboys managed to come back and tie the game with just over two minutes left to play, enough time for the Vikings to drive downfield and set up a potential game-winning, 46-yard field goal attempt for Chuck Nelson with nine seconds left. He missed the kick and the game went to overtime. Both teams failed with their first two possessions, with both throwing interceptions. Vikings linebacker Scott Studwell returned his interception to the Minnesota 40-yard line to begin their third drive of the extra period. They opened with four straight run plays, including a fourth-down conversion to get them to midfield, followed by a 24-yard pass from Wilson to Carter, before Darrin Nelson ran the remaining distance for the walk-off game-winning touchdown. The result brought the Vikings to a 7–4 record with four games left to play.\nStandings\nPostseason\nSchedule\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Round\n!style=\"\"| Date\n!style=\"\"| Opponent (seed)\n!style=\"\"| Result\n!style=\"\"| Record\n!style=\"\"| Venue\n|-style=\"background:#cfc\"\n!

Washington scored first on a 98-yard drive that was capped by running back Kelvin Bryant's 42-yard touchdown reception from quarterback Doug Williams. However, Minnesota tied the game before halftime with quarterback Wade Wilson's 23-yard touchdown pass to Leo Lewis. In the third quarter, Redskins linebacker Mel Kaufman returned an interception 10 yards to the Minnesota 17-yard line to set up kicker Ali Haji-Sheikh's 28-yard field goal. In the final period, Vikings kicker Chuck Nelson made an 18-yard field goal to tie the game, 10–10. The Redskins then marched 70 yards to score on Williams' 7-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Gary Clark to take the lead, 17–10, with 5:06 remaining in the game. Minnesota then advanced to the Washington 6-yard line, but Wilson's fourth down pass, intended for running back Darrin Nelson in the end zone was defended by Darrell Green with 52 seconds remaining and the Redskins ran out the clock.\nStatistics\nTeam leaders\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=150px style=\"\"| Category\n!width=150px style=\"\"| Player(s)\n!width=75px style=\"\"| Value\n|-\n| Passing yards || Wade Wilson || 2,106\n|-\n| Passing touchdowns || Wade Wilson || 14\n|-\n| Rushing yards || Darrin Nelson || 642\n|-\n| Rushing touchdowns || D.J.
