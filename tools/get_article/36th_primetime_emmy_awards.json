The ceremony was broadcast on CBS, from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, Pasadena, California.\nThe top shows of the night were Cheers and Hill Street Blues. Cheers won its second straight Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, while Hill Street Blues made history. It became the first show to win the Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series four times. This record has been tied by L.A. Law, The West Wing, Mad Men and Game of Thrones, but still stands. Hill Street Blues also added to another streak. It received at least 14 major nominations for the fourth straight year, winning four. Cheers received the most nominations on the comedy side (10), winning three.\nSir Laurence Olivier won the last of his five career Emmys this evening. His win was also the last time a non-Network Syndicated performance won an Acting Award.\nWinners and nominees\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Cheers (NBC)'\n** Buffalo Bill (NBC)\n** Family Ties (NBC)\n** Kate & Allie (CBS)\n** Newhart (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Hill Street Blues (NBC)'\n** Cagney & Lacey (CBS)\n** Fame (Syndicated)\n** Magnum, P.I.
