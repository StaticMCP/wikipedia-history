In 1891, the firm was instructed to design a new building for the Montreal Board of Trade. Maxwell returned home to Montreal to supervise its construction, helped by having good relations with influential members of the Board.\nIn 1892, the jeweller Henry Birks hired Maxwell to design a new store in Montreal's Phillips Square. Maxwell also designed several stations and hotels for the Canadian Pacific Railway, including the West Vancouver station (1897) and the McAdam station (1900). In 1899, he designed a country house for Louis-Joseph Forget at Senneville, Quebec, a good example of his domestic work.\nIn 1902, he went into partnership with his younger brother, William Sutherland Maxwell, who had studied at the École des beaux-arts in Paris. In 1903, he was elected to the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.\nSelected buildings\n*Lady Meredith House at 1110 Pine Avenue West, Montreal (1894)\n*Royal St. Lawrence Yacht Club – clubhouse (1895)\n*London and Lancashire Life Building, Montreal (1898)\n*Vancouver CPR depot (1898–1914)\n*McAdam station (1900)\n*Charles Meredith House at 1130 Pine Avenue West, Montreal (1904)\n*Montreal Museum of Fine Arts (1910)\nFile:Holy Trinity Serbian Orthodox Church in Montreal.jpg|Holy Trinity Serbian Orthodox Church in Montreal, formerly Melville Presbyterian Church (1897-1900)\nFile:Residence H-Vincent-Meredith 01.jpg|Lady Meredith House (1894)\nFile:Vancouver CPR depot (HS85-10-24306).jpg|Vancouver CPR depot (1898–1914)\nFile:McGill University downtown campus 26.JPG|Charles Meredith House (1904)\nNotes\nExternal links\n* [http://cac.mcgill.ca/maxwells/edbio2.htm Biography of Edward Maxwell] – at McGill.ca\n* [https://vimeo.com/122488234 Edward Maxwell's CPR Depot (1898–1914)] – at Vimeo.com\n* [http://www.patrimoine-culturel.gouv.qc.ca/rpcq/detail.do?methode=consulter&id=7764&type=pge#.Xm7kBveJKpo Outline of Edward Maxwell's life] – Répertoire du patrimoine culturel du Québec (in French)\n* [http://linuxfocus.org/~guido/book-a-history-of-the-town-of-baie-d-urfe/then-and-now/#maxwelton Maxwelton] – Maxwell's farmhouse (between Oakridge and Calais streets in Baie-D'Urfé, Quebec)\n* [https://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=13464&pid=0 Tillietudlem] – Maxwell's summer residence (at 434 Bar Road in St. Andrews, New Brunswick)"
