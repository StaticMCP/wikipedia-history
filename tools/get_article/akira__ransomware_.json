It targeted over 250 entities including: US energy firm BHI Energy, Nissan Australia, the Finnish IT services provider Tietoevry, and Stanford University. The group has also claimed responsibility for a ransomware attack on the Toronto Zoo, though the zoo has not linked the incident to any particular threat actor. Akira is offered as ransomware-as-a-service.\nAkira is estimated to have earned up to $42 million from its inception in March 2023, until April 2024.\nMethods\nAkira primarily targets Cisco VPN products as an attack vector to breach networks, especially those without multi-factor authentication enabled. The group uses publicly available or natively installed tools and techniques for lateral movement. There are both Windows and Linux variants of Akira ransomware.\nAkira uses double-extortion ransomware techniques, in which data is exfiltrated from the environment before it is encrypted with threats to publish this data if a ransom is not paid.\nAkira v2\nAkira v2 is written in Rust and is designed to locate files based on specific parameters, tailoring encryption to more specific file types. These file types are often associated with database project files, optical media, Exchange mailbox databases, virtual hard disks, and other file types associated with virtualization and virtual machines.\nKey Generation\nAkira used CryptGenRandom to generate a symmetric key, which itself was then encrypted by the combination of a ChaCha20 stream cipher and an RSA-4096 public key, which was appended to the end of encrypted files. The threat actors possessed the private key, preventing decryption without paying a ransom.\nAkira ransomware has both a Windows and Linux version, though the Windows version uses the Windows CryptoAPI library while the Linux variant uses the Crypto++ library to encrypt devices when the ransomware is deployed.\nDecryptor\nIn June 2023, Avast released a decryptor for the Akira ransomware, likely exploiting the partial file encryption approach used at the time to crack the encryption without obtaining any keys. The decryptor does not work natively on Linux systems, and if needed it is recommended to use a WINE layer to run the decryptor on a Linux machine.\nIn April 2025, There's one more public decryptor available for Akira ransomware uses multiple GPUs to perform bruteforce attack on ransomware and cracks private keys of the ransomware. It is only available for Linux variant of Akira Ransomware so far. The tool was developed by Yohanes and available on GitHub as well as Akira Decryptor with usage guide.\nReferences\nSee also\n* Conti (ransomware)"
