Nicknamed Sparkle, he was both a cricketer and rugby player.\nEarly life\nWatt was born in Rosebank, Cape Town and educated at Bishops. At school he did not play for the school's first rugby team and in 1928 he went to the United States where he joined a bank and then worked for the Quaker Oats Company in Chicago. While living in Chicago, he became involved in promoting rugby union and cricket in the area.\nCricket career\nAn Australian cricket team, with a young Don Bradman in the team, toured the US and Canada. Watt, playing for an Illinois XI, bowled Sir Donald Bradman twice in one match in Chicago in 1932 as a fast bowler. When Howard Watt met him again in 1937, Bradman remembered him as one of the few people to dismiss him so cheaply.\nIn 1934 he returned to South Africa and started playing first-class cricket for Western Province, for whom he opened bowling. He played in six matches for Western Province with a best return of 6–84 for Western Province against Griqualand West in Kimberley in 1934/35. In 1938 he moved to the Transvaal area and played for North Eastern Transvaal. In 1928, Watt played against the England touring team and took 2–59, including the wickets of Len Hutton and Eddie Paynter.\nRugby union career\nIn 1934, Watt also joined Villagers and was chosen for  in 1935 and was a member of the 1936 Currie Cup winning team.\nHe was a member of the 1937 Springbok touring team to Australia and New Zealand and although he participated in seven tour games he did not play a test match.\nSee also\n*List of South Africa national rugby union players – Springbok no. 260\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
