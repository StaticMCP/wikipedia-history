The army has since been retired.\nThe residents of the self-declared republic celebrate this independence annually on Užupis Day, which falls on April 1.\nArtistic endeavours are the main preoccupation of the Republic; the President of the Republic of Užupis, Romas Lileikis, is himself a poet, a musician, and a film director. Tomas Čepaitis, the micronation's foreign minister, is himself a translator and artist.\nLegal status\nIt is unclear whether the statehood of the Republic, recognised by no government, is intended to be serious, tongue-in-cheek, or a combination of both. The decision to place Užupis Day on April 1 (April Fools' Day) may not be coincidental, emphasising the importance of humor over \"serious\" political decisions.\nThe Republic has granted honorary citizenship to several notable individuals, including the 14th Dalai Lama, who first visited the Republic in 2013. He later returned in 2018 to plant a tree in the Republic's \"Tibet Square\" to mark 100 years since the Council of Lithuania proclaimed the restoration of an independent state of Lithuania.\nArtūras Zuokas, a former mayor of Vilnius, lives in Užupis.\nPublic image\nThe flag of the Republic features the palm of a hand on a white background. The colour of the palm emblem changes seasonally, in the sequence blue (Winter), green (Spring), yellow (Summer), and red (Autumn).\nAmbassadors\nat Ars Electronica Festival in Linz (AT) in 2019.]]\nThe Užupis Ministry of Foreign Affairs has appointed more than 500 ambassadors worldwide. The ambassadors have the task to build bridges between people.\nSome ambassadors represent the republic and its constitution in a certain state or geographic region while others share the republic's spirit in various realms of life like the ambassador among humming birds, the ambassador of knowledge for humanity or the ambassador for whistling in the streets.\nThe Embassy of the Republic of Užupis to Munich builds bridges between arts and AI technology to make artificial intelligence more ethical and more accessible to society. Well-known ambassadors include the experimental filmmaker Jonas Mekas, the art critic Konstyantyn Doroshenko, and the designer Dr. Nelly Ben Hayoun.\nEvery year the ambassadors meet for their world conference in Užupis on the day before national day celebrations on April 1.\nRepresentatives of the Republic of Užupis have met with the President and Foreign Minister of Liberland to discuss mutual recognition.\nConstitution\nCopies of the 38 articles of the Republic's constitution and 3 mottos - \"Don't Fight\", \"Don't Win\", \"Don't Surrender\" - in 23 languages, can be found affixed to a wall in Paupio street in the area. Sanskrit and Hindi versions of the constitution were added on 25 May 2017.\nSome of these articles would be unremarkable in a constitution; for instance, Article 5 simply reads \"Man has the right to individuality.\"\nOthers are more idiosyncratic; a typical example can be found in Article 1 (\"People have the right to live by the River Vilnelė, while the River Vilnelė has the right to flow past people.\"), 12 (\"A dog has the right to be a dog.\") and 37 (\"People have the right to have no rights.\"), which can be seen as unusual compared to fundamental rights set out by the EU.\nThere are a number of paired articles, such as Articles 16 (\"People have the right to be happy.\") and 17 (\"People have the right to be unhappy.\") which declare people's right to either do or not do something, according to their desire.\nMinister of Foreign Affairs Thomas Chepaitis, Ambassador H. E. Max Haarich, AI-Expert Alex Waldmann and humanoid Roboy formulated an additional article for the Munich Embassy:\"Any artificial intelligence has the right to believe in a good will of humanity.\" This makes the Užupian constitution the world's first constitution to mention artificial intelligence.\nIn September 2018 the constitution was blessed by Pope Francis during his visit to Vilnius.\nFile:Constitution of the Republic of Užupis - Munich version.jpg|The Munich version of the constitution of the Republic of Užupis including an additional article about artificial intelligence (no. π).\nFile:Uzupis Constitution.JPG|A board featuring the Uzupis Constitution\nInfrastructures\nThe Republic of Užupis does not house internet-cafes, markets, shopping malls, or governmental institutions (except Užupian), and there is no embassy to Lithuania.\nIn creative works\nThe Republic of Užupis, a 2009 novel by the South Korean author Hailji, chronicles the journey of an Asian man named Hal visiting Užupis to inter the ashes of his father, believing the \"Republic\" to be his ancestral homeland.\nUžupis was the topic of a 2015 piece of music by Matt Howden's The Mighty Sieben, featuring the three mottos, \"Don't Fight\", \"Don't Win\", \"Don't Surrender\". The track was written in celebration of, and first performed at, the Mėnuo Juodaragis Festival held in Lithuania.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.uzupiorespublika.com/en/home/ Official Website of the Republic of Užupis]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36HaU_XcKyA Video report about Vilnius, featuring a lot of scenes filmed in Užupis : Locks on bridges, the Republic and the Constitution]\n* [http://vilnews.com/2011-03-1-april-is-uzupis%E2%80%99-independence-day 1 April is Užupis’ Independence Day!] VilNews e-magazine 5 February 2019\n__NOTOC__"
