This was revealed by his son, Jinggoy Estrada, in a YouTube video in 2020. The burial place was built near a rock where the former president frequently prays in his former resthouse, which became the location of his house arrest after his presidency.\nVice presidential burial places\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!
