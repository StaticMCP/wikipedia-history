It took place in Kolno, in Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, now part of Poland, and ended without definitive victors, with both sides retreating.\nHistory\nPrussian General Heinrich Johann Günther, carrying about 750 troops, marched from Kozioł near the Pisa river to Szczuczyn, when on 9 July, he found the presence of Polish–Lithuanian insurgents, led by colonel Walenty Kwaśniewski, stationed in Kolno. Günther decided to strike it by surprise. At 1 am, the Prussians attacked the town, which contained around 1,450 Polish–Lithuanian soldiers.\nThe Prussians struck at the insurgents positions through the dikes on the Łabna river. The attack collapsed under the Polish–Lithuanian infantry fire. At around 10 am, Günther ordered the battle to be stopped and all captured prisoners of war executed, after which he withdrew near Pisz. Kwaśniewski's group, on the other hand, withdrew to Borkowo.\nReferences"
