In the upcoming seconds, the video starts to explain the situation as it shows that in the evening prior, there was a prom taking place inside the gym, with Smiley holding a concert. The video shows him in double, with one half of him being a mere participant of the prom, and the other half showing him as the concert lead singer. His unpopular half brings his girlfriend along at the party, and not long after, the girl is noticed by the other half of him who was already on the stage. Alongside the crowd, they proceeded in dancing all night and through the end of the party, the girlfriend dumps his unpopular half and leaves the prom with the singer half. The expression of a \"Dead Man Walking\" was proved by the mumble dancing style adopted by the crowd in the video, also hinting at Smiley's hangover from the beginning of it.\nThe music video represented a world premiere, being the first video to feature integrated elements of augmented reality, available at the [https://download.cnet.com/hahaha-reality/3000-2133_4-75722800.html HaHaHa Reality App].\nThe video also featured several of Smiley's fellow HaHaHa Production colleagues Alex Velea, Pacha Man, Don Baxter, Sore, Speak, and his Românii au talent show co-presenting partner Pavel Bartoș.\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!
