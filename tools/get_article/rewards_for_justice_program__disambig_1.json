RFJ directly addresses the foreign threat by identifying entities such as key leaders and financial mechanism of the foreign terrorist organizations. The Rewards for Justice Program is managed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency (NSA) and Department of Defense (DOD). Rewards for Justice is seeking information for individuals who operate under terrorist groups or terrorist organizations that participate in launching cyber-attacks against United States critical infrastructure such as electrical grids and renewable energy resources from United States Presidential election interferences.\nHistory\nOn December 22, 2011, Rewards for Justice announced a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to Ezedin Abdel Aziz Khalil (aka Yasin al-Suri), the leader of an al-Qaeda fundraising network in Iran that transfers money and recruits via Iranian territory to Pakistan and Afghanistan. It marked the first time that Rewards for Justice offered a reward for information leading to a terrorist financier. The program was established by the 1984 Act to Combat International Terrorism (Public Law 98-533), and it is administered by the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security. The Rewards for Justice Program was formerly known as the Counter-Terror Rewards Program, soon shortened to the HEROES program. In 1993, DS launched www.heroes.net to help publicize reward information. By 1997, the site was getting more than one million hits a year from 102 countries. Smith is also credited with the idea to put photos of wanted terrorists on matchbook covers. DSS agents assigned to embassies and consulates throughout the world ensured that the matchbooks got wide distribution at bars and restaurants. The secretary of state is currently offering rewards for information that prevents or favorably resolves acts of international terrorism against U.S. persons or property worldwide. Rewards also may be paid for information leading to the arrest or conviction of terrorists attempting, committing, conspiring to commit, or aiding and abetting in the commission of such acts. As of 2022, The Rewards for Justice program has paid more than $250 million to 125 individuals for leading information that prevented international terrorist attacks or helped bring to justice those involved in prior acts.\nAfter the September 11 attacks, the list of wanted terrorists increased dramatically, and rewards were also increased, as part of the U.S. efforts to capture al-Qaeda leadership. However, the plan has been largely ineffective against Islamic terrorists. The largest reward offered was $25 million for the leader of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, which had \"attracted hundreds of anonymous calls but no reliable leads.\" Osama bin Laden was shot and killed inside a private residential compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, by members of the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group and Central Intelligence Agency operatives in a covert operation on May 2, 2011. [https://eca.state.gov/files/bureau/remarks_for_das_hartung_-_antiquities_event.pdf Robert A. Hartung, Assistant Director of Diplomatic Security's Threat Investigations and Analysis Directorate, announced on September 2, 2010 that the U.S. Department of State's Rewards for Justice program is offering rewards of up to $5 million each for information that leads law enforcement or security forces to Hakimullah Mehsud and Wali ur Rehman.] Former U.S. secretary of state Hillary Clinton presented a list of \"the five most wanted terrorists\" to Pakistan; the list included Ayman al-Zawahiri, Mohammed Omar, Ilyas Kashmiri, Atiyah Abd al-Rahman and Sirajuddin Haqqani. Each of these five had bounties issued against them by the program; however, Kashmiri, who US Intelligence officials said they were 99% sure was killed in an airstrike in South Waziristan on June 3, 2011, was removed from the list. Rahman was killed in an airstrike in North Waziristan in August 2011. Omar died of tuberculosis in Karachi, Pakistan, in April 2013. Al-Zawahiri was killed in a drone strike in Kabul, Afghanistan, in July 2022.\nRFJ Most Wanted\nOn August 10, 2022, a federal jury located within the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in Newark, New Jersey, indicted Mansour Ahmadi, Ahmad Khatibi Aghda, and Amir Hossein Nickaein Ravari on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud related to recent activity in connection with computers, intentional damage to a protected computer, and transmitting a demand in connections to damaging a protected computer. The Rewards for Justice Program announced $10 million dollar through the approval of the United States Department of State administered by the United States Department of Treasury the amount offered on information in regard to the location or whereabouts of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) also known as the Iranian cyber actors. During the press conference, the FBI asked for the help of public in seeking information for hackers. Later in the day, the FBI and Rewards for Justice had then uploaded a flyer for Mansour Ahmadi, Ahmad Khatibi Aghda, and for Amir Hossein Nickaein Ravari.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Name\n!Terrorist Organization(s)\n!Terrorist Activity\n|-\n|Ahmad Khatibi Aghda\n|Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Electronic Warfare\n|Indicted of conspiracy charges to commit wire fraud related to recent activity in connection with computers, intentional damage to a protected computer, and transmitting a demand in connections damaging a protected computer\n|-\n|Amir Hossein Nickaein Ravari\n|Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Electronic Warfare\n|Indicted of conspiracy charges to commit wire fraud related to recent activity in connection with computers, intentional damage to a protected computer, and transmitting a demand in connections damaging a protected computer\n|-\n|Mansour Ahmadi\n|Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Electronic Warfare\n|Indicted of conspiracy charges to commit wire fraud related to recent activity in connection with computers, intentional damage to a protected computer, and transmitting a demand in connections damaging a protected computer\n|-\n|Mahdi Lashgarian\n|Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Cyber-Electronic Command; IRGC-CEC; IRGC Jangal Organization; Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Electronic Warfare and Cyber Defense Organization; Mr. Soul\n|Participated in malicious cyber activities against United States critical infrastructure in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)\n|-\n|Milad Mansuri\n|Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Cyber-Electronic Command; IRGC-CEC; IRGC Jangal Organization; Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Electronic Warfare and Cyber Defense Organization; Mr. Soul\n|Participated in malicious cyber activities against United States critical infrastructure in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)\n|-\n|Mohammad Amin Saberian\n|Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Cyber-Electronic Command; IRGC-CEC; IRGC Jangal Organization; Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Electronic Warfare and Cyber Defense Organization; Mr. Soul\n|Participated in malicious cyber activities against United States critical infrastructure in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)\n|-\n|Mohammad Bagher Shirinkar\n|Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Cyber-Electronic Command; IRGC-CEC; IRGC Jangal Organization; Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Electronic Warfare and Cyber Defense Organization; Mr. Soul\n|Participated in malicious cyber activities against United States critical infrastructure in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)\n|}\nAnnouncements\nIn April 2020, Rewards for Justice Program offered $5 million for information leading to identify North Korean hackers who target United States critical infrastructure.
