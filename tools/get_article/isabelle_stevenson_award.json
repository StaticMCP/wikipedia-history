A single recipient is chosen by the Tony Award Administration Committee and may not be presented at every ceremony. The international press regards the Tony Awards as America's most prestigious theater awards.\nThe American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League present the winner with a copy of a circular brass and bronze medallion designed by art director Herman Rosse at an annual award ceremony in New York City. The award has been presented annually since the 63rd Tony Awards in 2009. Actress Phyllis Newman was chosen as its inaugural recipient for her work in establishing the Phyllis Newman Women's Health Initiative in 1995 and raising $3.5&nbsp;million for the organization. Since then, another six women and eight men have received the award and no one has won it more than once. As of the 78th Tony Awards in 2024, actor Celia Keenan-Bolger is the most recent winner in this category.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Winners of the Isabelle Stevenson Award\n|-\n! scope=col | Year\n! scope=col class=unsortable | Image\n! scope=col | Recipient(s)\n! scope=col class=unsortable | Notes\n! scope=col class=unsortable |\n|-\n|2009\n|\n! scope=row |\n| align=left | Newman established The Phyllis Newman Women's Health Initiative in 1995 and raised $3.5&nbsp;million for it.\n|\n|-\n|2010\n|\n! scope=row |\n| align=left | Pierce is an honorary member of the national board of the Alzheimer's Association and a campaigner for research into Alzheimer's disease.\n|\n|-\n|2011\n|\n! scope=row |\n| align=left | Ensler established the V-Day global movement to stop violence against girls and women through awareness and education.\n|\n|-\n|2012\n|\n! scope=row |\n| align=left | Peters co-formed the animal charity Broadway Barks with actress Mary Tyler Moore to lobby for the adoption of animal shelters for homeless pets in New York City.\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|\n! scope=row |\n| align=left | Kramer co-founded the Gay Men's Health Crisis and later established ACT UP, an international activist and direct action network to develop treatments of HIV/AIDS.\n|\n|-\n|2014\n|\n! scope=row |\n| align=left | O'Donnell established the non-profit arts education organization Rosie's Broadway Kids (now Rosie's Theater Kids) in 2003 to allow New York City public school students to learn dance, drama and music.\n|\n|-\n|2015\n|\n! scope=row |\n| align=left | Schwartz fostered upcoming writers as a long-time board member of the ASCAP Foundation and the ASCAP Musical Theatre Workshop.
