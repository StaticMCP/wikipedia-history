It is being developed by The Howard Hughes Corporation. Once completed, this beachfront development will have luxury residences, retail stores, entertainment venues, pedestrian friendly streets, a Skyline rail station, and public open space.\nThe Development process\nOver the course of the next decade, The Howard Hughes Corporation plans to add more than one million square feet of retail shops and 4,000 high-rise residential opportunities. To ensure the development of Ward Village honors the distinct history of Honolulu and Hawaii, The Howard Hughes Corporation engages in thorough and ongoing consultation with the O'ahu Island Burial Counsel, the State Historic Preservation Division, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, the Ala Moana/Kaka'ako Neighborhood Board, the Hawaii Community Development Authority, the City and County of Honolulu, tenants, neighbors and recognized cultural descendants.\nPhase one development\nPhase one of the project featured the development of two residential condominium towers—Waiea and Anaha—as well as a new master plan information center and residential sales gallery in the IBM Building.\nThe towers were completed in 2017 and 2018 respectively.\nWaiea\nWaiea features 171 residences, including 10 villas and 10 penthouses. The tower is designed by James K.M. Cheng and Hawaii-based Rob Iopa of WCIT Architecture. The interiors of Waiea are created by interior designer, Tony Ingrao and the landscaping is designed by SWA Group.\nWaiea once had a Nobu's restaurant upon completion which closed and is now a Jinya Ramen Bar.\nAnaha\nThe Anaha tower includes 311 residences, including 73 flats and townhomes. Anaha is collaboratively designed by architecture and design firms Solomon Cordwell Buenz and Ben Woo Architects. The interiors are designed by designer Woods Bagot and the exterior spaces are created by landscape designer Surface Design of San Francisco.\nA Merriman's restaurant anchors this building.\nIBM Building\nIn 2008, a redevelopment plan slated the IBM Building for demolition, but public backlash led to its preservation instead. The building was renovated and repurposed by Woods Bagot to be a sales center for Howard Hughes Corporation, as part of the development company's master plan for the surrounding Ward Village development, officially reopening in 2014. Howard Hughes built model units in the building for several of their nearby condominiums, and also utilized it as office space; it occupied the second, third, sixth and seventh floors while maintaining an information center on the first.\nChanges seen in Ward Village\nHere are the changes in Ward Village's urban fabric seen throughout its development.\nIn 2016, The old Pier 1 Imports was demolished to make way for Anaha. In 2017, the Office Depot/Nordstrom Rack was demolished to make way for Aeo/Whole Foods. In late 2017, the 1970s Ward Warehouse was mostly demolished to make way for Gateway Towers. At the same time, The Marukai Ward store and surrounding warehouses was shut down and was demolished to make way for the public Victoria Ward park, and the A'alii, Kōʻula, and The Park Ward Village condos.

The 1980s Ward Centre will be demolished to make way for Melia and Ilima - Date TBD.\nGateway Towers\nGateway Towers was designed by the firm of Richard Meier, and was to feature 236 units. These were going to be the most luxurious condos in the neighborhood, and were to feature unique considerations such as a bridge linking the two towers.\nGateway towers would be redesigned due to engineering problems, as well as the need for a bigger Victoria Ward Park.
