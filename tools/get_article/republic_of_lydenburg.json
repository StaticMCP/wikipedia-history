The village of Lydenburg was founded in 1849 by a group of Voortrekkers led by Hendrik Potgieter after they had left their previous settlement near Ohrigstad in the North due to a malaria epidemic. The republic later, in 1857, joined the republic of Utrecht. In 1860 both merged republics rejoined the South African Republic"
