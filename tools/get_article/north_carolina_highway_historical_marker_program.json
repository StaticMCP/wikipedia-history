      "text": "# North Carolina Highway Historical Marker Program\n\nThe North Carolina Highway Historical Marker Program was created by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1935. Since that time over 1600 black and silver markers have been placed along numbered North Carolina highways throughout the state. Each one has a brief description of a fact relevant to state history, and is located near a place related to that fact.\nHistorical Marker Districts\nNorth Carolina's counties are divided into seventeen districts for the highway marker program; each district is designated by a letter, and covers between four and eight counties. Each marker is assigned an identifier that begins with the letter of the district.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Name of District\n!Counties Within the District\n|-\n|District A\n|Bertie, Camden, Chowan, Currituck, Gates, Hertford, Pasquotank, Perquimans\n|-\n|District B\n|Beaufort, Dare, Hyde, Martin, Tyrrell, Washington\n|-\n|District C\n|Carteret, Craven, Jones, Onslow, Pamlico\n|-\n|District D\n|Brunswick, Columbus, New Hanover, Pender\n|-\n|District E\n|Edgecombe, Franklin, Halifax, Nash, Northampton, Warren\n|-\n|District F\n|Greene, Lenoir, Pitt, Wayne, Wilson\n|-\n|District G\n|Alamance, Caswell, Durham, Granville, Orange, Person, Vance\n|-\n|District H\n|Chatham, Hartnett, Johnston, Lee, Wake\n|-\n|District I\n|Bladen, Cumberland, Hoke, Robeson, Sampson, Scotland\n|-\n|District J\n|Forsyth, Guilford, Rockingham, Stokes\n|-\n|District K\n|Anson, Davidson, Montgomery, Moore, Randolph, Richmond\n|-\n|District L\n|Cabarrus, Mecklenburg, Rowan, Stanly, Union\n|-\n|District M\n|Alexander, Alleghany, Ashe, Davie, Iredell, Surry, Wilkes, Yadkin\n|-\n|District N\n|Avery, Burke, Caldwell, McDowell, Mitchell, Watauga, Yancey\n|-\n|District O\n|Catawba, Cleveland, Gaston, Lincoln, Polk, Rutherford\n|-\n|District P\n|Buncombe, Haywood, Henderson, Madison, Transylvania\n|-\n|District Q\n|Cherokee, Clay, Graham, Jackson, Macon, Swain\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ncmarkers.com/search.aspx North Carolina Highway Historical Marker Program, Searchable Database.]\n* [https://files.nc.gov/ncdcr/NC-Historical-Markers-Guide-Final-July-2020.docx Guide to North Carolina Highway Historical Markers, July 2020 Edition.]\n* [https://nc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=c53c699fdac146dbaccd215c986ac3d0 North Carolina Highway Historical Markers -- a web map of all 1600+ highway historical markers.]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/NCHistoricalMarkers/ North Carolina Highway Historical Marker Facebook Page.]"
