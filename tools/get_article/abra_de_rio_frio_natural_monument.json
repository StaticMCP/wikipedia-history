Received the status of natural monument on February 18, 1993.\nThe natural space aims to protect the geological and orographic structure of the open cold river, the only natural step through the Andean Cordilleras, linking the high western plains and tectonic Táchira depression.\nThe area is of a very populated vegetation, whose flora plays a regulating role of the microclimatic conditions in its surroundings. Close to its borders, which extend to the banks of the river Uribante, join the rivers Frío and Quinimari.\nThe natural area also protects the transitability of the road that connects San Cristóbal with the regions of the Uribante.\nSee also\n*List of national parks of Venezuela\n*Meseta la Galera Natural Monument\n*Teta de Niquitao-Guirigay Natural Monument\nReferences"
