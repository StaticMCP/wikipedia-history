He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1726. He married Elizabeth Howard, the daughter and coheiress of Matthew Howard of Hackney, Middlesex on 8 April 1729.\nCareer\nRudge was returned unopposed as Whig Member of Parliament (MP) for Aylesbury on the interest of his brother-in-law, Sir William Stanhope, at a by-election on 21 February 1728. He generally voted against the Government and did not stand at the 1734 general election. His father died in 1740 and he succeeded to his estate at Evesham. He was also returned unopposed as MP for Evesham, which was formerly his father's seat, at the  1741 general election. He was returned unopposed again at the 1747 general election.\nIn September 1753 Rudge was described as ‘one who though he had not much attended Parliament always voted with Government’. At the 1754 general election the Administration put up a candidate to oppose him. Rudge was defeated, although he was said to have spent ‘the greatest profusion of money’ in the contest.  He was returned as MP for Evesham in a contest at a by-election on 23 April 1756. He did not stand at the 1761 general election.\nRudge died without issue on 6 June 1763.\nReferences"
