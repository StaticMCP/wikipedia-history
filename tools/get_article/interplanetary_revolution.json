The subtitle is written in the rhymed style of Russian folk narratives.}} is one of the first Soviet animated films, shot in 1924. A production of the experimental animation workshop set up  by the authors. studio. while the film itself credits the production to \"бюро гос.тех.кино\" (GosTekhKino bureau) and the studio was claimed elsewhere to be under the auspices of Gostekhkino, housed at the premises of the former Moscow restaurant \"Yar\".}}\nThe 8-minute black and white silent animated short was directed and written by  Nikolai Khodataev,  and Yuri Merkulov.\nBackground\nIn 1924, Vasily Zhuravlev published the screenplay The Conquest of the Moon by Mr. Fox and Mr. Trott, which later formed the basis for Interplanetary Revolution by directors Nikolai Khodatayev, Zenon Komissarenko and Yuri Merkulov, also students of the State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company. The cartoon was created as animated inserts for the science fiction film Aelita by Yakov Protazanov. However, in the end it was not included in it and was released separately as a parody in the same year, but was not shown in theatres.

The \"red warrior kommissar Kominternov\" () follows them, but he lands on a futuristic Mars, where he fosters a victorious proletarian revolution.\nAnalysis\nThe animation is of primitive cutout style, with almost no intertitles.\nThe film is made of cliches: it shows a bourgeois with buldog's heads with an axe wearing a top hat under which a swastika is hidden, vampires in tailcoats with swastikas on their foreheads who suck the blood of a worker. Their hair stands on end from the newspaper \"Pravda\", etc.\nPolish historian  notices that one uniformed character with moustache closely resembles Polish marshal Pilsudski.\nNot only the images of capitalists, but the communists as well were parodied. The propaganda in the film is described as extremely cliched and straightforward (but probably only from the modern point of view).\nThe filmmakers seem to poke some fun at Aelita: Kominternov sees a man and a woman on the Moon kissing.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
