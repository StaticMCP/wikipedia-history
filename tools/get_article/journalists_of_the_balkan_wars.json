Montenegro declared war on 8 October and Bulgaria, Serbia and Greece followed suit on 17 October. The war concluded with the signing of the Treaty of London on 30 May 1913. The Second Balkan War broke out when Bulgaria, dissatisfied with its share of the spoils of the First Balkan War, attacked its former allies, Serbia and Greece, on 29 June 1913. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Bucharest by the three powers on 10 August 1913.\nAn estimated 200–300 journalists from around the world covered the war in the Balkans in November 1912.\nReporting on the war from Greece\nThe official censorship bureau was established at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Athens. Each journalist had to make an application to proceed to the front, and enclose a photograph, together with a certificate from their country's Ministry in Athens. The Greek Government then issued the journalist an identity card which identified the paper he or she represented, his or her photograph, and a copy of his or her signature.  The journalist was given a spade-shaped blue-and-white badge the size of a small plate to pin on their chest, on which the letters \"ΕΦ\" were worked, being the initial letters of the Greek word for \"Newspaper\" (Εφημερίδα).\nThe day after the Battle of Sarantaporo, journalists were allowed to proceed to the Epirus front.\nReporting on the war from Bulgaria\nFollowing the outbreak of hostilities in 1912, almost 150 foreign correspondents rushed to Bulgaria, which was soon identified as the center of all major military developments. The Bulgarian government was successful in identifying and controlling the journalists. The authorities required each journalist to carry a red identification card that included his or her photograph and signature, to wear a red brassard that had the letters \"BK\" meaning военен кореспондент and a number, and to carry a document informing the various persons who the journalist was and what the Army Headquarters would allow them to do.\nReporting on the war from Serbia\nForty-five journalists from all around the world assembled in Belgrade to cover the First Balkan War. Foreign journalists, unless cleared by the General Staff, were not permitted in forward positions for the duration of hostilities.\nMotion pictures and the Balkan Wars\nThe First Balkan War provided the most extensive testing ground before the First World War for the new technology of large-scale filming, with more than 20 camera operators travelling to the region. One of the first movies, and definitely the first war documentary in German film history, was created by two German cinematographers: Robert Isidor Schwobthaler, and Albert Herr. The film was titled With the Greeks in the firing line (1913). It has been preserved by the UCLA Film & Television Archive from a 35mm tinted nitrate print. It can be watched through [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv6r63vRMMg&t=3762s this link.] The two cinematographers are seen together for ten seconds (36:05 - 36:26) in the film. Schwobthaler is the bearded man on the left, and Albert Herr on the right of the picture. Schwobthaler is seen in several parts of the film, which probably makes Albert Herr the man behind the movie camera.\nThe Journalists\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"15%\" |Name\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"5%\" |Nationality\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"5%\" |Conflict\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"15%\" |News media\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"20%\" |Area & dates\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"40%\" |Other information\n|-\n| McLellan, David\n| British/Scottish\n| B.W.I\n| War journalist for the Daily Mirror, (London).\n| Northern Greece\n| One of the first journalists to be given permission by the Greek Foreign Affairs Office to report from the war zone.\n|-\n| Mayov, Maud\n| Russian\n| B.W.I\n| War journalist for the Agence télégraphique de Saint-Pétersbourg, (St. Petersburg).\n| Northern Greece\n| His name is also written as Maud Mayow.\n|-\n| Cassano, Mario\n| Italian\n| B.W.I\n| War journalist for La Stampa, (Torino).\n| Northern Greece\n|\n|-\n| Kalapothakis, Dimitrios\n| Greek\n| B.W.I\n| War correspondent for the Chicago Daily News, (Chicago).\n| Northern Greece\n| His name in Greek is Δημήτριος Καλαποθάκης.
