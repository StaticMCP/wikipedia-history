It preserves the history of St. Lawrence County.\nHistory\nThe Association was first founded in 1947, and was chartered in 1955.  In 1965, the Association's archives began being stored in a Baptist church in Richville.  The Silas Wright Museum was opened in 1978 and the archives were moved there.  The Association was accredited by the American Alliance of Museums in 1982.\nSee also\n* List of historical societies in New York (state)\nReferences"
