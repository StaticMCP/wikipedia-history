After being built they were dismantled and reassembled at North Ipswich Railway Workshops. Originally classified the A class, per Queensland Railway's classification system they were designated the A10 Avonside class in 1890, A representing they had two driving axles, and 10 the cylinder diameter in inches.\nOne, 3 Lady Bowen, operated the first Queensland Railways service in 1865 between Grandchester and Ipswich. Initially operating on the Southern & Western Railway out of Ipswich, one was transferred to the Central Railway out of Rockhampton in 1867 and the other three to Maryborough in 1879.\nClass list\n{|cellpadding=\"2\"\n|\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Works number\n!Southern & WesternRailway number\n!Maryborough Railwaynumber\n!Central Railwaynumber\n!Queensland Railwaysnumber\n!Name\n!In service\n!Notes\n|-\n|align=center|552\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|\n|align=center|\n|align=center|Premier\n|align=center|January 1865\n|Transferred to Maryborough May 1880, condemned 1888\n|-\n|align=center|555\n|align=center|2\n|align=center|2\n|align=center|\n|align=center|108\n|align=center|Faugh-a-Ballagh\n|align=center|January 1865\n|Transferred to Maryborough January 1880, renumbered 108 1890, sold to contractor Overend & Paterson\n|-\n|align=center|554\n|align=center|3\n|align=center|3\n|align=center|\n|align=center|\n|align=center|Lady Bowen\n|align=center|February 1865\n|Transferred to Maryborough 1879, condemned 1888\n|-\n|align=center|553\n|align=center|4\n|align=center|\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|133\n|align=center|Pioneer\n|align=center|February 1865\n|Transferred to Rockhampton 1867, renumbered 133 1890, withdrawn 1896\n|-\n|}\n|}\nReferences"
