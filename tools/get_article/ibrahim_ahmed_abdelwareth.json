Abdelwareth represented Egypt at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, where he entered both the discus and shot put in the F37/F38. He finished eighth in the discus, but found success in the shot put where a throw of 15.53 gave him the silver medal. Abdelwareth has also found success at the World Championships winning gold in the 2011 IPC Athletics World Championships in Christchurch. As of 2013, Abdelwareth was reclassified as a T44 athlete, where he has found it difficult to repeat his earlier success.\nReferences"
