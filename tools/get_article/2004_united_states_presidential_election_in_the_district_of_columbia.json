Voters chose three representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Prior to the election, Washington DC was considered to be a jurisdiction Kerry would win or safely blue.\nAs expected, the District of Columbia voted by an extremely large margin in favor of the Democratic candidate John F. Kerry. John F. Kerry won DC by a margin of victory of 79.84% over the incumbent George W. Bush, more than any state.  At the time, this was also the largest Democratic margin of victory over a Republican candidate in the history of the district, but has since been surpassed by all presidential elections since. The greatest victory margin of these subsequent years was in 2016. Such victory margins may perhaps be attributed to the fact that D.C. only encompasses an urban core area (and those are generally very liberal in nature). A recent San Francisco study based on the 2004 presidential election exit polls, ranked Washington, D.C. as the 4th most liberal city in the country. This information supports the fact that the District of Columbia has never voted for a Republican since the ratification of the 23rd Amendment.\nAs of 2024, this marks the last time that a Democratic presidential nominee would receive less than 90% of the vote in the District of Columbia.\nPrimaries\n* 2004 District of Columbia Democratic primary\nCampaign\nPredictions\nThere were 12 news organizations that made state-by-state predictions of the election.

D.C. is allocated 3 electors. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 3 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 3 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.\nThe electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 13, 2004, to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols.\nThe following were the members of the Electoral College from D.C. All were pledged to and voted for John Kerry and John Edwards.\n# Linda W. Cropp\n# Jack Evans\n# Arrington L.
