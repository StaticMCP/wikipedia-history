It was a second-line Territorial Army formation, and fought in the Battle of France with the 23rd (Northumbrian) Division. The brigade was later part of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division. It went on to fight in the North African campaign, the Allied invasion of Sicily, the Normandy landings and the North West Europe campaign.\nOrder of Battle\nFirst World War\n* 11th Battalion, Prince of Wales's Own (West Yorkshire Regiment)\n* 8th Battalion, Alexandra, Princess of Wales's Own (Yorkshire Regiment)\n* 9th Battalion, Alexandra, Princess of Wales's Own (Yorkshire Regiment)\n* 11th Battalion, Duke of Wellington's (West Riding Regiment)\n* 69th Machine Gun Company, Machine Gun Corps (formed 4 March 1916, moved to 23rd Battalion, Machine Gun Corps 1 April 1918)\n* 69th Trench Mortar Battery (formed 13 June 1916)\nSecond World War\n69th Infantry Brigade was constituted as follows during the war:\n* 5th Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment\n* 6th Battalion, Green Howards\n* 7th Battalion, Green Howards\n* 69th Infantry Brigade Anti-Tank Company (formed 1 September 1940, disbanded 1 January 1941)\n* 69th Infantry Brigade Support Company (from 16 May 1943, left 31 December 1943)\nCommanders\nThe following officers commanded 69th Infantry Brigade during the war:\n* Brigadier Viscount Downe\n* Brigadier J.A.

Stanier\nNorth Africa\nIn April 1941 the 69th Brigade, as part of 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, was dispatched to the Middle East first via Cyprus, Iraq, Syria, Egypt and then into Libya as part of XIII Corps in the British Eighth Army which was one of the best-known formations in the Second World War.\nBattle of Gazala\nThe \"Gazala Line\" was a series of occupied \"boxes\" each of brigade strength set out across the desert with minefields and wire watched by regular patrols between the boxes. The Free French were to the south at the Bir Hakeim box. The line was not equally staffed with a greater number of troops covering the coast leaving the south less protected.\nBy late May Rommel was ready. Facing him on the Gazala defences were 1st South African Division, nearest the coast, 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division (on their left) and 1st Free French Brigade furthest left at Bir Hakeim. The British 1st and 7th Armoured Divisions waited behind the main line as a mobile counter-attacking force while 2nd South African Division formed a garrison at Tobruk and 5th Indian Infantry Division (which had arrived in April to relieve 4th Indian Infantry Division) were held in reserve.\nThe 69th Brigade position at the start of the battle can be seen in the map (right), it was during this battle that their sister brigade the 150th Infantry Brigade was destroyed in its isolated brigade box by the Afrika Corps and never reformed. The 69th Brigade and the remaining units of 50th Northumbrian Division had to escape by attacking west through the enemy lines then sweeping back east to the south of the enemy forces, eventually they reached the El Alamein line by 1 July.\nEl Alamein\nThe Battle of El Alamein is usually divided into five phases, consisting of the break-in (23–24 October), the crumbling (24–25 October), the counter (26–28 October), Operation Supercharge (1–2 November) and the breakout (3–7 November). No name is given to the period from 29 to 30 October when the battle was at a standstill.\nIn the Second Battle of El Alamein, 69th Infantry Brigade and 50th (Northumbrian) Division were initially deployed in the south (see map), where it was to attack the Italian 185th Infantry Division \"Folgore\", supported by elements of the British 7th Armoured Division. Since the division was understrength, owing to the loss of the 150th infantry Brigade, the 1st Free French Brigade and 1st Greek Brigade were attached to it for the battle. It was then transferred north to take part in Operation Supercharge.\nTunisia\nMareth Line\nThe division fought in Tunisia, where Montgomery launched his major attack, Operation Pugilist, against the Mareth Line in the night of 19 March 1943 – 20 March 1943. The 69th Infantry Brigade part of 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, with difficulty, penetrated the Italian held line near Zarat. The terrain and heavy rain, however, prevented deployment of tanks and anti-tank guns and the 15th Panzer Division's counter-attack on 22 March recaptured much of the bridgehead.\nLieutenant Colonel Derek Anthony Seagrim, VC 20/21 March 1943\nLieutenant-Colonel Seagrim was killed in action shortly afterwards, on 6 April 1943.\nSoon after, XXX Corps prepared a new attack towards Tallouf. The 4th Indian Infantry Division was detailed to make a night attack on 23 March around the left-hand end of the Line. This would coincide with the wide \"left hook\" manoeuver Montgomery was planning. Operation Supercharge II, \"left hook\" outflanking maneuver via the Tebaga Gap. Montgomery reinforced the flanking attack, which on 26 March forced an Axis retreat that was completed by 31 March with the Eighth Army in pursuit.\nGabes\nBoth the Eighth Army and the U.S. II Corps continued their attacks over the next week, and eventually the Eighth Army broke the lines and the DAK was forced to abandon Gabes and retreat to join the other Axis forces far to the north. On the night of 5 April, Wadi Akarit, was attacked and the \"Tobruk\" Battalion of the Italian San Marco Marines, was destroyed, although casualties among the 6th Green Howards had been severe; two senior officers, six senior NCO's and junior officers and one hundred and eighteen other ranks killed.\n\"When we were about ten yards away we had reached the top of the slit trench and we killed any of the survivors,\" recalled British infantryman Bill Cheall of the 6th Green Howards, who had just seen his section leader shot down by a San Marco Marine. \"It was no time for pussy footing, we were intoxicated with rage and had to kill them to pay for our fallen pal.\"\nGerman General Hans-Jürgen von Arnim later said of the San Marco Marines fighting abilities in Tunisia in 1943, that they were \"the best soldiers I ever commanded\".\nThe Eighth Army's attack along the eastern coast of Tunisia, lead eventually to the surrender of Axis forces in Africa. 250,000 men were taken prisoner, a number equal to that at Stalingrad.\nOperation Husky , Sicily Invasion\nAfter Tunisia the brigade was still part of 50th Northumbrian Infantry Division and was involved in the Sicily landings of July 1943. After Sicily the brigade and the division were recalled from the Eighth Army in Italy to prepare for the invasion of North-West Europe.\n, 6 June 1944]]\nNormandy, Gold Beach\nGold was the Allied codename for the centre invasion beach during the Second World War Allied Invasion of Normandy, 6 June 1944. It lay between Omaha and Juno, was 8&nbsp;km wide and divided into four sectors. From West to East they were How, Item, Jig, and King.\nThe 69th Brigade assaulted the east side of Gold, with attached armour support from the 4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards. Company Sergeant-Major Stanley Hollis of the brigade's Green Howard battalion single handededly captured a pill box. Later in the day, he led an assault to destroy German gun positions. For his action he was awarded the Victoria Cross. He was the only soldier to earn that medal on D-Day.\nOperation Market Garden\nOperation Market Garden (17 September 1944 – 25 September 1944) was an Allied military operation in the Second World War in the Netherlands and Germany. The land portion of the operation was Garden, for which the brigade was assigned to in reserve. On 22 September, the 69th Brigade was split in two, when German forces cut the axis of the advance. The next day, the brigade neared Nijmegen and came under German artillery fire. On 26 September, the brigade attempted an aborted assault on Haalderen, and the fighting ran through 27 September. On 30 September, the brigade along with the entire division, were tasked with defending the area north of Nijmegen and were assaulted by 70 tanks and the equivalent of an infantry division. In defense of the brigade's front, 12,500 25-pound shells were fired and B Company, 2nd Cheshire Regiment fired 95,000 machine-gun rounds.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20071117092536/http://www.greenhowards.org.uk/bill-cheall/cheall05.htm\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160805121848/http://www.routetovictory.info/50history.php]\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20160325024342/http://unithistories.com/units_british/50InfDiv.html\n* [http://www.6juin1944.com/assaut/gold/en%20page.php?page=69landing 69 Infantry Brigade Landing Table Gold Beach]"
