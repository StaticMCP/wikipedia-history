      "text": "# Warabe uta\n\nare traditional Japanese songs, similar to nursery rhymes. They are often sung as part of traditional children's games. They are described as a form of min'yo: traditional Japanese songs, usually sung without accompanying instruments.\nThe centuries-old lyrics are often incomprehensible to modern Japanese (especially to children who are singing it), and others can be quite sinister on close analysis. Like many children's songs around the world, because people are used to them from an early age, they are often oblivious to the real meanings.\nExamples\nTōryanse\n\"Tōryanse\" is often played as an electronic tune at pedestrian crossings in Japan to signal when it is safe to cross.\nJapanese:\n通りゃんせ　通りゃんせ\nここはどこの　細通じゃ\n:天神さまの　細道じゃ\nちっと通して　下しゃんせ\n:御用のないもの　通しゃせぬ\nこの子の七つの　お祝いに\nお札を納めに　まいります\n:行きはよいよい　帰りはこわい\nこわいながらも\n通りゃんせ　通りゃんせ\nRomaji:\nTōryanse, tōryanse\nKoko wa doko no hosomichi ja?\n: Tenjin-sama no hosomichi ja\nChitto tōshite kudashanse\n: Goyō no nai mono tōshasenu\nKono ko no nanatsu no oiwai ni\nO-fuda wo osame ni mairimasu\n: Iki wa yoi yoi, kaeri wa kowai\nKowai nagara mo\nTōryanse, tōryanse\nTranslation:\nLet me pass, let me pass\nWhat is this narrow pathway here?\n:'' It's the narrow pathway of the Tenjin shrine\nPlease allow me to pass through\n: Those without good reason shall not pass\nTo celebrate this child's 7th birthday\nI've come to dedicate my offering\n: Going in will be fine, fine, but returning will be scary\nIt's scary but\nLet me pass, let me pass''\n(When infant mortality was high, people traditionally celebrated when a child survived to reach the age of 7. See Shichigosan)\nThis particular warabe-uta is sung as part of a traditional game identical to \"London Bridge Is Falling Down\". Two children facing each other link their hands to form an arch 'checkpoint', and the remaining children walk through underneath in a line (and back round again in circles). The child who happens to be under the arch when the song finishes is then 'caught'.\nThe tune is played at Japanese pedestrian crossings by analogy with this game, i.e., it is safe to cross until the music stops.\nTeru-teru-bōzu\nA teru teru bōzu is a little traditional hand-made doll which supposedly brings sunshine. \"Teru\" is a Japanese verb which describes sunshine, and a \"bōzu\" is a Buddhist monk. Children make teru-teru-bōzu out of tissue paper and a string and hang them from a window to wish for sunny weather. There is a famous warabe uta which is about the small ghost-like dolls which people can see hanging on rainy days.\nJapanese:\nてるてるぼうず、てるぼうず\n明日天気にしてをくれ\nいつかの夢の空のよに\n晴れたら金の鈴あげよ\nてるてるぼうず、てるぼうず\n明日天気にしてをくれ\n私の願いを聞いたなら\n甘いお酒をたんと飲ましょ\nてるてるぼうず、てるぼうず\n明日天気にしてをくれ\nそれでも曇って泣いてたら\nそなたの首をちょんと切るぞ\nRomaji:\nTeru-teru-bōzu, teru bōzu\nAshita tenki ni shite o-kure\nItsuka no yume no sora no yo ni\nHaretara kin no suzu ageyo\nTeru-teru-bōzu, teru bōzu\nAshita tenki ni shite o-kure\nWatashi no negai wo kiita nara\nAmai o-sake wo tanto nomasho\nTeru-teru-bōzu, teru bōzu\nAshita tenki ni shite o-kure\nSore de mo kumotte naitetara\nSonata no kubi wo chon to kiru zo\nTranslation:\nTeru-teru-bozu, teru bozu\nDo make tomorrow a sunny day\nLike the sky in a dream sometime\n'' If it's sunny I'll give you a golden bell\nTeru-teru-bozu, teru bozu\nDo make tomorrow a sunny day\nIf you make my wish come true\nWe'll drink lots of sweet sake\nTeru-teru-bozu, teru bozu\nDo make tomorrow a sunny day\nbut if it's cloudy and I find you crying (i.e. it's raining)\nThen I shall snip your head off''\nThe lyrics are allegedly about a story of a monk who promised farmers to stop rain and bring clear weather during a prolonged period of rain which was ruining crops. When the monk failed to bring sunshine, he was executed.\nYuki\nis a song Japanese children sing when it's snowing and they want to play outside. 'Yuki' means 'Snow' in Japanese. The song is also commonly known as 雪やこんこ (Yuki ya konko) The snow falls densely.\nJapanese:\n雪やこんこ 霰やこんこ\n降っては降っては ずんずん積る\n山も野原も 綿帽子かぶり\n枯木残らず 花が咲く\n雪やこんこ 霰やこんこ\n降っても降っても まだ降りやまぬ\n犬は喜び 庭駈けまわり\n猫は火燵で 丸くなる\nRomaji:\nyuki ya konko, arare ya konko\nfuttewa futtewa zunzun tsumoru\nyama mo nohara mo wataboshi kaburi\nkareki nokorazu hana ga saku\nyuki ya konko, arare ya konko\nfuttemo, futtemo, mada furiyamanu\ninu wa yorokobi, niwa kakemawari\nneko wa kotatsu de marukunaru\nTranslation:\nThe snow falls densely, the hail falls densely!\n'' It's falling and falling, collecting more and more.\nThe mountains and the fields are also wearing their cotton hats,\nand in every tree flowers bloom.\nThe snow falls densely, the hail falls densely!\nIt's still falling and falling, never stopping.\nThe dog is happy, running around the garden,\nthe cat is curled up under the kotatsu.''\nA kotatsu is a low, heated table. In the first stanza, flowers blooming in winter probably refers to the snow collecting on empty branches. The literal translation of the line is something like  \"No withered trees remaining, flowers bloom\".\nReferences"
