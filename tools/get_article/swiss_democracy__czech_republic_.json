It contested the 2021 Czech parliamentary election, led by molecular geneticist and anti-vaccination activist Soňa Peková and its founder Tomáš Ráždík, and presented lists in all 14 electoral regions. The party earned 0.31% of the vote, and failed to meet the electoral threshold.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the party participated in protests challenging the anti-pandemic restrictions in place, led by the Chcípl PES movement and together with Tricolour, Svobodní, Free bloc and other parties in organisations.\nIn 2022, Swiss Democracy took part in a series of anti-governmental protest under banner of Czech Republic First!, criticising the Cabinet of Petr Fiala.\nIt contested the 2024 European Parliament election together with the Party of the State of Direct Democracy – Party of Labour, running on a eurosceptic platform. It gained 0.09% of the vote and no seats in the European Parliament.\nThe party contested 4 out of 27 districts in the 2024 Czech Senate election, but did not qualify for the second round in any of them.\nIdeology\nSwiss democracy calls for the adoption of a new constitution, \"copied\" from the Swiss counterpart, citing Switzerland's high prosperity compared to other European nations.\nThe party maintains the opinion that the 2003 Czech European Union membership referendum was manipulated, and that Czech Republic should leave the European Union, and maintain its foreign relationships with other European countries by bilateral agreements.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the party called the acting cabinet of Andrej Babiš \"neo-marxist\" and Prime Minister Babiš a \"dictator\".\nElectoral results\nChamber of Deputies\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:100%;&quot;\"\n!Election\n!List leader\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n|-\n!2021\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Tomáš Raždík\n|16,823\n|0.31 (#12)\n|}}\n|-\n!2025\n|12,097\n|0.22 (#11)\n|}}\n|}\nSenate\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Election\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Candidates\n! colspan=\"4\" |First round\n! colspan=\"3\" |Second round\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Seats\n! rowspan=\"2\" |+/–\n|-\n!Votes\n!%\n!Runners-up\n!Place\n!Votes\n!%\n!Place\n|-\n!2024\n|4\n|3,859\n|0.5\n|}}\n|20th\n| colspan=\"3\" |—\n|}}\n|New\n|}\nEuropean Parliament\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:100%;&quot;\"\n!Election\n!List leader\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n|-\n!2024\n|Pynelopi Cimprichová\n|2,559\n|0.09 (#25)\n|}}\n|}\nNotes\nReferences"
