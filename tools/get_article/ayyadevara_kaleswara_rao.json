He was also the founding member of Vignyana Chandrika, a literary society to fund and encourage original literary works in Telugu and also translations from European and other Indian languages in to Telugu.\nCareer as a lawyer\nKaleswara Rao moved to Madras along with his mother and wife to join the Law College in early 1904 and studied B.L. until the following year.
