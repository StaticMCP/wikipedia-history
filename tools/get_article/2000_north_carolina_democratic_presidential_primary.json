The North Carolina primary was a semi-closed primary, with the state awarding 103 delegates towards the 2000 Democratic National Convention, of which 86 were pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the results of the primary.\nVice president Al Gore won the state with 70% of the vote, gaining 73 delegates, far ahead of senator Bill Bradley, who attained around 18% and 13 delegates. The Uncommitted option won around 9% of the vote and Lyndon LaRouche Jr. won just 2%, failing to meet the threshold to attain delegates.\nProcedure\nNorth Carolina's Democratic primary took place on May 2, 2000, the same date as the Indiana primary and the D.C. Primary.\nVoting took place throughout the state from 6:30&nbsp;a.m. until 7:30&nbsp;p.m. In the semi-closed primary, candidates had to meet a threshold of 15 percent at the congressional district or statewide level in order to be considered viable. The 86 pledged delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention were to be allocated proportionally on the basis of the results of the primary. Of these, between 4 and 7 were allocated to each of the state's 12 congressional districts and another 11 were allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates), in addition to 19 at-large delegates.\nThe delegation also included 12 unpledged PLEO delegates: 8 members of the Democratic National Committee, 6 members from Congress, those being Senator John Edwards, Representatives Eva Clayton, Bob Etheridge, David Price, Mike McIntyre, Mel Watt, the governor Jim Hunt, and 2 add-ons.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;float:none;padding:5px;\"\n! colspan=\"4\"| Pledged nationalconvention delegates\n|-\n!
