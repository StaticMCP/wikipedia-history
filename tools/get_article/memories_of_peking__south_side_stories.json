Originally serialized in two parts in the December 1957 issues of Free China Journal, it was first published as a collection in 1960 by Taichung Kuangchi Publishing and became Lin's breakthrough work. The overarching theme of the novel is \"farewell,\" and it is structured meticulously with progressive layers.\nPlot\nSet in the 1920s in a courtyard in the southern part of Beijing, the novel depicts the warm family life of Ying-tzu and her family. The novel is imbued with a nostalgic tone, portraying the author's emotions in a simple and straightforward manner.\nThe narrative begins with the prologue \"Winter Sun, Childhood Years, the Camel Caravan\", and subsequent chapters each focus on one or two main characters. Through Ying-tzu's interactions with each character, the novel provides a child's perspective on the joys and sorrows of human life. The final chapter, \"Papa’s Flowers Have Fallen, and I Was Not Longer a Child\", marks the father's death, and Ying-tzu must begin to take on the responsibility of caring for her siblings, signaling the end of her childhood. The story concludes with a subtle sadness. Additionally, three major chapters in Memories of Peking: South Side Stories describe the stories of women: \"Hui-an Hostel\", Lan I-niang\" (Aunt Lan), and \"Donkey Rolls\", depicting the unfortunate experiences of different women of that era.\nMemories of Peking: South Side Stories was first published by Kuangchi Publishing in July 1960. After subsequent editions, Lin Hai-yin reclaimed the copyright and began self-publishing from the third edition, with her own Belles-Lettres Publishing handling the publication. The novel has seen multiple editions in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and it has been translated into English, Korean, German, Japanese, and other languages.\nReferences"
