Gilbert married first, Gertrude Rosabel Katherine Gore (1871-1920).  Gilbert and Gertrude were the parents of:\n*Gilbert Thomas Gore McMicking, b.2 August 1894, Stanton Lacy, Shropshire, England – d.11 November 1918 in Netherlands\n*Ralph Gore McMicking, b. May, 1897, Dadford, England – d.1964,Surrey, England\n*Robert James Gore McMicking (b. 6 October 1905 – d.1983, Surrey).\nOn 22 July 1921 at London, England, Gilbert married second, Ethel Eliza Binny Douglas (1876-1935).\nHe served with the Honourable Artillery Company and reached the rank of Major. After the outbreak of the Second Boer War in October 1899, a corps of imperial volunteers from London was formed in late December 1899. The corps included infantry, mounted infantry and artillery divisions and was authorized with the name City of London Imperial Volunteers (CIV). It proceeded to South Africa in the early months of 1900, returned in October the same year, and was disbanded in December 1900. Major McMicking was appointed in charge of Field Battery (the artillery division) of the CIV on 1 January 1900, with the temporary rank of Major in the Army, and left London for South Africa in early February with a contingent of officers and men of the Honourable Artillery Company. He served in command of the artillery division of the CIV until the corps was disbanded. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) for his services in South Africa in 1901.\nHe was Member of Parliament (MP) for Kirkcudbrightshire from 1906 to January 1910, and from December 1910 until the constituency was abolished for the 1918 general election.  He was then elected for the new Galloway constituency, and stood down at the 1922 general election.\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*"
