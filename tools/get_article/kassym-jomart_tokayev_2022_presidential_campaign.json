From there, he also proposed a constitutional change regarding the presidential term office to be extended for a nonrenewable seven-year term. Tokayev was nominated for presidency by the People's Coalition on 6 October 2022, which consisted of several major pro-government political parties and public associations in support. He was officially registered as a candidate on 12 October by the Central Election Commission after garnering a total of 399,809 signatures.\nBackground\nPresident Kassym-Jomart Tokayev became president following the 2019 election, where he secured his first five-year term of office upon the vote. Had Tokayev chose to run once his term expired the in originally scheduled 2024 presidential election, he would have been eligible by law to seek re-election and possibly continue hold office until 2029.\nAnnouncement\nAt the annual State of the Nation Address held on 1 September 2022, Tokayev announced the 2022 presidential election to take place in autumn. From there, Tokayev voiced his interest to run for reelection and proposed a constitutional amendment in changing the president's term of office to a once seven-year term that was planned to be enacted after the elections were initially held, which would have shorten his second term in office to 2027. However, the Parliament of Kazakhstan after public controversy regarding fears of extending presidential time in office, implemented the changes to the law prior before the vote, thus granting the opportunity for Tokayev to serve seven years as president upon being reelected. Tokayev then signed the ratified constitutional amendments into law. After setting the date for the 2022 election by a presidential decree, Tokayev reiterated his commitment to run again and hinted that his election manifesto would outline \"new initiatives aimed at achieving socio-economic progress\".\nNomination\nAmidst receiving presidential nominations by a number of public associations and political parties, Tokayev expressed his desire to be nominated from \"a broad coalition of socio-political forces\". This led to the formation of the People's Coalition which included the pro-government parties of Amanat, Aq Jol Democratic Party, and People's Party of Kazakhstan and various public associations supporting Tokayev. The People's Coalition held its first forum on 6 October 2022 that was attended by 2,000 representatives of political parties and more than 30 republican associations.

On 12 October 2022, Tokayev was officially registered by the CEC as candidate after submitting a total of 399,809 signatures in support.\nÄlnur Iliaşev, a civil activist and lawyer, appealed to the Supreme Court of Kazakhstan and demanded the CEC to reject Tokayev's candidacy, in which he argued that Tokayev's decree in appointing snap elections violated the principles of voting rights and that the CEC deprived citizens' voting rights to what Iliaşev described the actions as being \"illegal and unconstitutional\".
