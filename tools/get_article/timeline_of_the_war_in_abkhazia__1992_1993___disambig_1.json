Ethnic Armenians and Russians within Abkhazia's population, largely supported Abkhazians and many fought on their side. The separatists were supported by thousands of the North Caucasus and Cossack militants and by the Russian Federation forces stationed in and near Abkhazia.\nHandling of this conflict was aggravated by the civil strife in Georgia proper between the supporters of the ousted Georgian president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia and the post-coup government headed by Eduard Shevardnadze, as well as the Georgian-Ossetian conflict.\n1992\nAugust\n14\nPolice forces had been sent to Abkhazia to defend communication means.  The Abkhazian government was informed about this operation.  The Sukhumi Battalion of Soso Akhalaia (former officer of the Sukhumi Police Office) that returned from the Tskhinvali region led the police.  A Tbilisi police unit had followed the battalion led by David Zeikidze.\nThe first attack took place in Ochamchire, near the village of Okhurei where the Abkhaz militia fired upon the police escort.\nThe next attack in Agudzera destroyed one Georgian armored troop carrier.\nAnother attack had been carried out near the village of Machara.  One Georgian had been wounded and one Abkhaz boevik, who was sitting on the roof of a building shooting at the moving column, was killed.\nThe ambushed Abkhaz boeviks blew up one Georgian armored troop carrier.  For some reason, reporters from Russian TV immediately showed up and reported that Georgian troops entered Abkhazia with tanks and occupied Sukhumi.\nTo avoid further bloodshed, Georgian units moved up to the city suburb.\nThe separatists called for a mobilization (Sergei Shamba addressed the Abkhaz population, calling them to report to certain places, which were defined in advance). The Presidium of the Supreme Council of Abkhazia, more accurately Vladislav Ardzinba, decided the further developments.\nArmed Abkhaz separatists took control of strategic points in the city.\n15\nA small Georgian military unit had been dispatched to Gagra from the coast.\nT. Sigua and J. Ioseliani arrived in Sukhumi for negotiations.  It was decided to hold the negotiations in the Sukhumi Governmental Summer Residence, so-called Joseph Stalin's Dacha, but Sergei Bagapsh asked to change the place.  The negotiators from the Georgian side were: T. Sigua, Jaba Ioseliani (members of the State Council), Tamaz Nadareishvili (Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Council of Abkhazia), V. Kolbaia (Deputy), N. Meskhia (Deputy), A. Ioseliani (Head of the Security Service of Abkhazia); from the Abkhazian side: S. Bagapsh (First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Abkhazia), Z. Labakhua (Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Abkhazia, A. Ankvab (Deputy, Ministry of Interior), Z. Achba, S. Shamba, D. Pilia (Deputies).  T. Sigua informed them that police forces had entered Abkhazia with the aim to defend communication systems, which was negotiated with Ardzinba.  This information surprised the Abkhazian side.  Sigua requested a meeting with Ardzinba, but he refused and avoided the possibility of  dialogue.  Z.  Labakhua offered to control the railroads and other communication means with a group of 200 Georgians and 200 Abkhazians from the Psou River down to the Samegrelo Region.

They observed conflict development in Gagra, Gudauta, Akhali Atoni (Novy Afon), Sukhumi, Ochamchire, Tkvarcheli and Gali.\n31\nAfter having negotiations with central government, the formation of Loti Kobalia left Senaki.\nAugust\n1–20\nGeorgian side gave proper treatment to the agreement: disbanded battalions, moved all military equipment and installations to Poti, left only two check-points at the Gumista River.\nJoint commission controls Agreement implementation and Georgian side takes an active part in this process.\n2\nHead of State established Commission on Peaceful Resolution of Conflict chaired by Zhiuli Shartava that was to implement July 27 Agreement.\n6\nIn a statement sent to Boutros-Ghali and Yeltsin Ardzinba blamed the Georgian side for mistreating the Agreement.  That gave advance warning of Sukhumi assault.\n9\nPrime Minister of Georgia T. Sigua resigned.\n24\nV. Ardzinba meets Yeltsin in Moscow.\n28\nFormation of Loti Kobalia seized Senaki and Abasha.\n31\n62 Deputies of Gamsakhurdia's Parliament gathered in Zugdidi discussing Russian-Georgian relations, current situation and demanded broadcast time on TV.\nSeptember\n1–15\nDisplaced people return to their homes.  Schools and other educational institutions start operating again.  Reconstruction of Sukhumi is in progress.\n7\nL.

Kobalia starts \"campaign\" in Guria region.\n16\nSeparatists begin assault to the East (Tkvarcheli-Ochamchire) front.\n17\nRussian detachments and confederant formations crossed Gumista River, took both bridges and seized part of Achadara.  The forces were unequal.  The Georgian side did not have technique and installations, neither launchers nor artillery; great lack of ammunition.\nBacked with artillery and aviation enemy attacked the villages Tavisupleba, Birtskha and Odishi.\nMountain Peoples’ Confederation announced mobilization of all military formations to be dispatched to Abkhazia.\nShevardnadze has confidential meeting with P. Grachev in Adler.\n18\nThe following is the appeal of Shevardnadze: \"To all friends of my homeland,\nI am addressing you from the besieged Sukhumi not knowing if my words will ever reach you.  The fighting is underway only a few blocks away from where I am with my friends.  Regardless what happens I will not leave this town which has been treacherously deceived once again.  I will not leave Sukhumi residents who have suffered immensely in their own town, left to their fate vis-a-vis a brutal, inhuman force, which keeps shelling the residential areas.  40 civilians had been killed and 153 wounded in the last two days.  The total number of casualties has reached 2,031 while that of the wounded is 5802. How often have I asked myself – what is happening? What for?\nThe Gudauta leaders say they are fighting for freedom, for the right to live on their native land.  But it is not the same freedom, or the same right that the 240 000 Georgians, whose roots on this soil can be traced many centuries back, thirst for and are trying to gain.... We did not intend to conquer anyone – can one conquer his own people or seize his own land – the seedbed of our culture and statehood.  We only aspired to defend the sovereignty of the Republic, protect its vital communications, do away with the hotbeds of sabotage and terror, and we wanted to do all that with consent and participation of our Abkhaz fellow-countrymen.... I am writing this at 3 a.m.  The city is being shelled.  1500 houses have already been destroyed.  There is no water, no bread, no light and the hope is dwindling.  The shelling continues.  A few shells have just hit a maternity home, where there were mothers and their infants. I am not saying good-bye, I don’t want to.  May God send you peace and happiness.\"  31\nMinister of Defense of Russia makes a provocative announcement in Moscow: \"Neither Georgians nor Abkhazs would like peace.  One is up for blood while another is unable to control the situation.  There is a real civil war in Georgia and not only on the territory of Abkhazia.\"\n19\nJoint Commission on conflict settlement had the first sitting in Adler.  Destructive position of Abkhaz side made the meeting futile (First Deputy of Separatist Government N. Khashba was most active).\nFormations of separatists are controlling Tamishi and Kindgha roadways.\nRussian Government made a statement (signed by Viktor Chernomyrdin) on violation of ceasefire Agreement of 27 July 1993 by Abkhaz side that reads: \"In case of further violation of Sochi Agreement from Abkhaz side the measures of International Law are to be exercised, in particular, the energy supply from the territory of Russia is to be cut off.\" 32\nSeptember 20\nThe all-Georgian women organization \"Tetri Mandili\" (Secretary Keti Dolidze) organized the action, which was directed against the war and bloodshed. The train in which there were hundreds of activists of various nationalities (Georgians, Russians, Ukrainians, Jews, Germans, Lithuanians, Armenians, Azerbaijanians, etc.), moved from Tbilisi to Abkhazia and reached Ochamchire.\n21\nShevardnadze visited battle positions in the suburb of Sukhumi.\n21–23\nRussian detachments, Abkhaz separatists and mercenaries entered Sukhumi suburb.\nEnemy formations moved ahead to Shroma side and approached Sukhumi funicular, seized Achadara and from Lechkopi Cemetery came to the Central Railway Station, crossed the railway till the sea shore and besieged Georgian battalions around lighthouse; another part moved along Chochua Street and joined them at the so-called Mount Trapezium.\n24\nAt the press conference in Sukhumi Shevardnadze evaluated the situation.\nShevardnadze appeals to Sukhumi population and defenders by radio: \"Dear friends, Citizens of Sukhumi and Georgia!  Georgia is facing the most difficult days, especially Sukhumi.  Separatists and foreign invaders entered into city.  I am proud of your courage… Separatists and adventurers will be judged by history.... They do not want Georgians to live in this Georgian City.  Many of them dreams to repeat the Gagra tragedy here.... I know that you understand the challenge we are facing.  I know how difficult the situation is.  Many people left the city but you stay here for Sukhumi and for Georgia…  I call you, citizens of Sukhumi, fighters, officers and generals: I understand the difficulties of standing on the positions now, but we have no right to step back, we all have to keep our places.  We have to fortify the city and save Sukhumi.  I would like to tell you that all of us – Government of Abkhazia, Cabinet of Ministers, Mr. Zhiuli Shartava, his colleagues, city and regional government of Sukhumi are prepared for action.  The enemy witnesses our readiness, that's why he is fighting in the most brutal way and destructs our beloved Sukhumi.  I call you to keep peace, tenacity and self-control.  We have to meet the enemy in our streets as they deserve.\" 33\n18–27\nGamsakhurdia arrives in Senaki from Chechnya.  He holds mass meetings in Senaki, Chkhorotsqu, Zugdidi and Gali; He also arrives in Ochamchire and meets some field-commanders and L. Kobalia formation.\n16–27\nForty-five days' cease-fire made displaced people to perpetrate a blunder and they returned.  Schools are full of children.  The fighters are concerning about their families.  Civil aviation has no capacity to evacuate children, women and elders.  The population, already adapted to shelling and bombardments is leaving the city in the peaceful manner.  Nobody had believed that Sukhumi would have been fallen.  They did not feel disaster that was facing those Georgians, which were staying in Sukhumi...\nWhole Georgia stands to help the brothers.  All civilian flights are canceled.  Volunteers are rushing to help with bare hands.  Georgians are perishing in unequal fighting.  Enemy blew up the plane full of peaceful population.  All of who burnt inside...\nSeparatists brought down another airplane with only civilians on the board.\nShelling Sukhumi airport separatists blew up plane that was just about to evacuate civilians.  Son of world-known athlete Levan Tediashvili, Vakhtang Tediashvili dies there rescuing people from the burning airplane.\nNegotiations with the supporters of ex-President Gamsakhurdia are in progress.  Their military formations are dislocated in Samegrelo region.  Their leaders (Loti Kobalia, Akakiy Eliava) do not agree to fight against enemies together with \"Junta\" (as they called Central Government) army and leaves alone besieged Sukhumi.\nIn the vicinity of the Kodori River Georgians dislocated about 3000 fighters and 60 armored vehicles.  There are also some formations of ex-President.  For some reasons they can not force over the river and help Sukhumi.\n29\nTogether with Georgian Military Headquarter Shevardnadze moves to Agudzera.\nThe Parliament of Georgia calls Head of State Shevardnadze back to Tbilisi to continue his duty, prevent more bloodshed and larger civil war.\n25–28\nThe population and military formations retreated on two directions. Boats evacuated part of them from Gulripshi and another part (the largest one) moved through Kodori Gorge Merkheuli-Tsebelda-Lata-Azhara-Gentsvishi-Chkhalta-Sakeni road.  Thousands of people, hundreds of cars and trucks took their Calvary way.  There was no food.  Local population helped them as they could. People moved to Chuberi Crossing.  Night is too cold there.  Women, children and elders were getting sick. Victims of hunger and cold have never been reliably counted.  Many deceased were buried just right there.  Georgia appealed for help to the world.  Many countries responded, especially Ukraine and Armenia, which sent helicopters.  The Government and local population shared bread, meat, and warm clothing. But the facts of marauding and plunder were also fixed.  People abandoned the cars and continued moving on foot.\n28\nBombardment is undertaken in Gulripshi region (Machara, Agudzera, Dranda airport).  Dranda airport is shelled both, from the water-area and ground.\nAirplane takes off from Dranda airport having on board Eduard Shevardnadze, A. Jorbenadze, I. Batiashvili, K. Gabashvili, A. Kavsadze, Sh. Kviraia, journalist R. Egadze, security officers (most of them left Sukhumi through Kodori Gorge), many children and women.  Shelling is conducted from the sea, but high-qualified pilots prevent the crash and the plane lands to Tbilisi via Batumi.\nThe Dranda airport Director Z. Khaindrava, having fixed (at the very last minutes) the damaged plane, manages to deliver to Tbilisi 120 elders, children and women via Gali and Kutaisi.\n29\nSeparatists and mercenaries seized Gulripshi.\n30\nAbkhaz seized Ochamchire and Gali and reached Enguri River at 20.00 hour.\nGali population fled to Zugdidi and Tsalenjikha regions.\nSee also\n*\nFurther reading\n*R.
