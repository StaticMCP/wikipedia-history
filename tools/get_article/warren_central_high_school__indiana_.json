It is the only high school in Warren Township with an enrollment of 3,736 students, in grades 9–12, as of the 2016–2017 school year. Warren Central is known as \"The Pride of the Eastside\". Its school colors are Black and Vegas Gold and the nickname is the Warriors. The school fight song is Rah, Rah For Warren. The original Warren Central opened on January 12, 1925, at the corner of 10th Street and Post Road on the far east side of Indianapolis.  It was a consolidation of the Cumberland and Shadeland schools which both had high schools that were too small for the growing township population. Warren Central was built to house grades 7 to 12 and to give the students a city quality education in a farm community. By the late 1950s, the population of Warren Township had once again outgrown its high school and, on September 6, 1960, a new Warren Central opened at its present location off of 9500 East 16th Street.  In 1976, the Walker Career Center opened on the property of the high school.\nAthletics\nThe school is best known for athletic success, competing as a member of the nationally recognized Metropolitan Interscholastic Conference. Warren Central has a total of 28 State Championship titles since winning its first title in 1980. State championships include Girls Basketball (1), Boys Basketball  (1), Boys Cross Country (2), Boys Track (4), Girls Track (5), Boys Golf (1), Boys Gymnastics (2), Softball (1), Wrestling (2), and Football (9).\nWarren Central was ranked the third-best athletic program in the US and first among public schools by Sports Illustrated in 2007.\nNotable alumni\n*Jamie Asher - former NFL tight end for the Washington Redskins and Philadelphia Eagles\n*David Bell - current wide receiver for the Cleveland Browns\n*Shakir Bell - former CFL running back for the Edmonton Eskimos\n*Justin Beriault - former NFL safety for the Dallas Cowboys\n*JuJu Brents - current cornerback for the Miami Dolphins\n*Sheldon Day - NFL defensive tackle, free agent.\n*Darren Evans - former NFL running back for the Indianapolis Colts and Tennessee Titans\n*Jeff George - former NFL quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts (1990–1993), Atlanta Falcons (1994–1996), Oakland Raiders (1997–1998), Minnesota Vikings (1999), Washington Redskins (2000–2001), Seattle Seahawks (2002) and Chicago Bears (2004)\n*Greg Graham - former NBA shooting guard for the Philadelphia 76ers, New Jersey Nets, Seattle SuperSonics and Cleveland Cavaliers; Graham also played for the Continental Basketball League and the Swedish Basketball League\n*Jewel Hampton - former running back for the CFL's Montreal Alouettes and the NFL's San Francisco 49ers\n*Aubrey Herring - track and field athlete, Indiana State\n*Robert M.
