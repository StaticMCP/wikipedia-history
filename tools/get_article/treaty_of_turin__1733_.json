Charles Emmanuel was promised French military support for the conquest of the Duchy of Milan in exchange for allowing French troops to use his territory in the Duchy of Savoy in the attack on other Italian territories including the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. The treaty paved the way for French military activity on the Italian peninsula in the War of the Polish Succession.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*Perkins, James Breck.
