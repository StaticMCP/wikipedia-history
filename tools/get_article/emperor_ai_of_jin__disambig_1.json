During his brief reign, the actual powers were largely in the hands of his granduncle Sima Yu the Prince of Kuaiji, and the paramount general Huan Wen.  According to historical accounts, he had an obsession with immortality, which resulted in his death, brought about as a result of poisoning by pills given to him by magicians in 364 and in 365.\nEarly life\nSima Pi was born in 341, during the reign of his father Emperor Cheng of Jin, as Emperor Cheng's oldest son.  His mother was Consort Zhou, who in 342 gave birth to his younger brother Sima Yi.  In summer 342, Emperor Cheng grew ill.  The common succession protocol, as He Chong (何充) pointed out, would mean that his oldest son would succeed to the throne, but Emperor Cheng's uncle Yu Bing (庾冰), wanting a new emperor who would also be connected to his clan as well, persuaded Emperor Cheng to pass the throne to his younger brother Sima Yue the Prince of Langya, also a son of his sister Yu Wenjun, under the reasoning that with the powerful rival Later Zhao to the north, the empire needed an adult emperor.  Emperor Cheng agreed, and named Sima Yue as the heir, and Sima Yue succeeded to the throne as Emperor Kang when he died soon after.  The one-year-old Sima Pi was instead created the Prince of Langya on 1 August 342.  He continued in that title after Emperor Kang's death in November 344, as Emperor Kang chose to pass the throne to his infant son Sima Dan (as Emperor Mu).  It is not known when he married his wife Wang Muzhi, only that she carried the title Princess Consort of Langya.\nReign\n{| cellpadding=3px cellspacing=0px bgcolor=#f7f8ff style=\"float:right; border:2px solid; margin:5px;\"\n|colspan=2 align=center style=\"border-top:1px solid\"|\n|-\n!align=center style=\"background:#ccf; border-bottom:2px solid\" colspan=2|Jin Aidi ()\n|-\n|align=right style=\"border-top:1px solid\"|Family name:||style=\"border-top:1px solid\"|Sima (司馬; sī mǎ)\n|-\n|align=right style=\"border-top:1px solid\"|Given name:||style=\"border-top:1px solid\"|Pi (丕, pī)\n|-\n|align=right style=\"border-top:1px solid\"|Posthumous name:||style=\"border-top:1px solid\"|Ai (哀, āi),literary meaning: \"lamentable\"\n|-\n|}\nIn July 361, Emperor Mu died without a son.  Emperor Mu's mother Empress Dowager Chu thus ordered that Sima Pi be made emperor, and he took the throne as Emperor Ai, at age 20.  He created his wife Princess Consort Wang as empress in October 361, and his brother Sima Yi, who previously carried the title the Prince of Donghai, as the Prince of Langya.  Since he was an adult, Empress Dowager Chu did not serve as regent for him, and he honored his mother Consort Zhou as Consort Dowager () in 362, but with supplies and ceremonies similar to the empress dowager.  However, the decision-making process was largely in the hands of the general Huan Wen and Emperor Ai's granduncle Sima Yu the Prince of Kuaiji.\nIn 362, Huan, after securing the Luoyang region, requested that the capital be moved back to Luoyang, where it had been until it had been captured by Han Zhao in 311.  The imperial government, under an edict issued by Emperor Ai, declined.\nIn 363, Consort Dowager Zhou died.  In accordance with proper protocol that he could no longer honor her as mother, out of respect for Empress Dowgaer Chu, Emperor Ai did not observe the normal mourning period due to a mother.\nEmperor Ai was obsessed with seeking immortality, and despite his young age, he died from Chinese alchemical elixir poisoning.  In 364, he became poisoned by pills given him by magicians, and he grew so ill that he was unable to handle important matters.  Empress Dowager Chu had to resume regency on his behalf.\nLater in 364, Former Yan launched a major attack against Luoyang, and Huan and Sima Yu considered a counterattack to relieve Luoyang.  However, as Emperor Ai died in March 365, that plan was cancelled, and Luoyang soon fell.  As he did not have a son, Emperor Ai was succeeded by his brother Sima Yi, as Emperor Fei.  Emperor Ai was preceded in death by his wife Empress Wang, who died about a month before he died; they were buried together with imperial honors.\nEra names\n* Longhe (隆和, py.
