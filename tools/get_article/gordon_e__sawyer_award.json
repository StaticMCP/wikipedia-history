Sawyer Award is an Honorary Award given by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to \"an individual in the motion picture industry whose technological contributions have brought credit to the industry.\" The award is named in honour of Gordon E. Sawyer, the former Sound Director at Samuel Goldwyn Studio and three-time Academy Award winner who claimed that a listing of past Academy Awards, arranged both chronologically and by category, represents a history of the development of motion pictures. It was first presented at the 54th Academy Awards, in April 1982. The Gordon E.
