It is located about  from Porphyry Island Provincial Park, about  from Sleeping Giant Provincial Park and  east of Silver Islet, Ontario. The island is about  east of the city of Thunder Bay.\nThe entire  island constitutes the Edward Island Provincial Park or nature reserve. The island is only accessible by boat and there are no public amenities made available by the park, rather the park is meant to be \"dedicated to the preservation of its unique ecosystems\". The main attraction to the island is the view of Lake Superior.\nReferences"
