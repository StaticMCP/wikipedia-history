It was first awarded in 1999, and is named for Wayne Gretzky. The recipient is selected by the news/sports media. The award was introduced shortly after Gretzky announced his retirement from the NHL in 1999. He played for the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds in the 1977–78 OHL season, scoring 70 goals as a rookie, establishing an OHL record for most goals by a 16-year-old that stood until 2007.\nWinners\nList of winners of the Wayne Gretzky 99 Award.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
