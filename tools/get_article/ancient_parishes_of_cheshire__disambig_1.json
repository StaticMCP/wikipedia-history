Initially, the ancient parishes had only an ecclesiastical function, but reforms initiated by King Henry VIII, developed by Queen Elizabeth I and expanded by later legislation led them to acquire various secular functions that eventually led to a split between the ecclesiastical parishes and the purely civil parishes that exist today.\nAncient parish overall details\nThe data are in the form of two tables: the first one gives information about each ancient parish whilst the second one gives information about each chapelry that may exist within each ancient parish. This complexity is brought about by having ancient parishes which, after the dissolution of the monasteries in the sixteenth century, possessed in some form or another both an ecclesiastical role and a civil role. This dual role existed until the nineteenth century.\nAncient parishes\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Ancient Parish\n!Earliest Reference / Creation Date\n!Constituent Chapelries\n!Constituent Townships\n!Additional Comments\n!References\n|-\n|Acton\n|\n|(none)\n|Acton, Aston iuxta Mondrem, Austerson, Baddington, Brindley, Burland, Cholmondeston, Edleston, Faddiley, Henhull, Hurleston, Poole, Stoke, Worleston; most of Coole Pilate, small parts of Newhall, Baddiley, and Dodcott cum Wilkesley, and part of Sound.\n|At one time included the chapelries of Church Minshull, Nantwich, and Wrenbury, and possibly contained the parish of Baddiley.\n|\n|-\n|Alderley\n|1328\n|(none)\n|Nether Alderley, Over Alderley, Great Warford.\n|Was once a chapelry of Prestbury.\n|\n|-\n|Aldford\n|\n|(none)\n|Aldford, Buerton, Churton by Aldford, Edgerley.\n|\n|\n|-\n|Ashton upon Mersey\n|1350\n|(none)\n|Sale; part of Ashton upon Mersey.\n|The two parishes of Ashton upon Mersey and Bowdon were split up into numerous small portions which were inter-mingled in a complex manner and can only be distinguished completely by viewing the relevant tithe maps for the area.\n|\n|-\n|Astbury\n|\n|Congleton\n|Buglawton, Congleton, Davenport, Eaton, Hulme Walfield, Moreton cum Alcumlow, Newbold Astbury, Odd Rode, Radnor, Smallwood, Somerford, Somerford Booths.\n|At one time included the parishes of Brereton, Church Lawton, and Swettenham.\n|\n|-\n|Audlem\n|\n|(none)\n|Audlem, Buerton, Hankelow, Tittenley.
