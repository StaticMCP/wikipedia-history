He was educated at Rugby School, before going up to New College, Oxford. While studying at Oxford, he played first-class cricket for Oxford University on six occasions between 1864&ndash;66.  In six matches for Oxford, Davenport scored 315 runs at an average of 39.37. His highest score of 107 came opening the batting against the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1866. He also made a single first-class appearance while at Oxford for Southgate Cricket Club in 1864. After graduating from Oxford, Davenport took holy orders in the Church of England and became a master at Wellington College from 1868. After retiring from his position at the college in 1904, he became the rector of Stoke Talmage, Oxfordshire. Davenport died at Stoke Talmage in March 1915.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
