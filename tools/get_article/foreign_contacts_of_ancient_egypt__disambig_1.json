Louvre Museum, reference E 11517. This work of art both shows the influence of Mesopotamia on Egypt at an early date, and the state of Mesopotamian royal iconography during the Uruk period.]]\nPredynastic Egyptians in the Naqada I period traded with Nubia to the south, the oases of the western desert to the west, and the cultures of the eastern Mediterranean to the east.  They also imported obsidian from Ethiopia to shape blades and other objects.  Charcoal samples found in the tombs of Nekhen, which were dated to the Naqada I and II periods, have been identified as cedar from Lebanon.\nEvidence of Naqadan contacts include pottery and other artifacts from the Levant that have been found in ancient Egypt.  Egyptian artifacts dating to this era have been found in Canaan and other regions of the Near East, including Tell Brak and Uruk and Susa in Mesopotamia.\nLapis lazuli trade, in the form of beads, from its only known prehistoric source &ndash; Badakshan, in northeastern Afghanistan &ndash; reached ancient Gerzeh.\nBy the first half of the 4th millennium BC, predynastic Egyptians in Maadi were importing pottery from Canaan.\nEarly Dynastic (c. 3100–2575 BC)\nEvidence of Early Dynastic contacts are basically a continuation of the predynastic above with further extensions into Sudan. There are also some indications of contact with the Aegean and Crete in this period, but this evidence is weak.\nNarmer had Egyptian pottery produced in southern Canaan – with his name stamped on vessels – and then exported back to Egypt.  Production sites included Arad, En Besor, Rafiah, and Tel Erani.  An Egyptian colony that was stationed in southern Canaan dates to this same era. As the largest Egyptian settlement in the area, it is likely that Tell es-Sakan served as the administrative centre for the Egyptian settlements. First Dynasty Egyptian pottery has been found in southern Canaan, some bearing the name of Narmer.\nOther reflections of ancient Near Eastern contact particularly include a design of a flint knife.\nOld Kingdom (before c. 2134 BC)\nEvidence of Old Kingdom trade (external map [http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/foreignrelations/oldkingdom.html here]) extends southward to Nubia (in modern Sudan and Ethiopia) and Punt (probably modern Ethiopia/Eritrea or the Eritreo-Sudanese borderlands, possibly Somalia), eastward to the Near East (Byblos and Ebla, Syria), northward to the Aegean and the Greek islands, and westward (limited evidence) with Libya.\nThe Darb el-Arbain trade route, passing through Kharga in the south and Asyut in the north, was used from as early as the Old Kingdom for the transport and trade of gold, ivory, spices, wheat, animals and plants.\nMiddle Kingdom (before c. 1648 BC)\nEvidence of Middle Kingdom contacts (external map [http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/foreignrelations/mk.html here]) reaches southward to Nubia, in particular Buhen and Kerma. Nubians also lived in ancient Egypt in this period.\nEastward contacts are represented by objects and motific works of ancient Egypt found in the Near East, including modern Anatolia and Byblos and those ancient regions around Canaan and Syria. Some kings of Byblos have been found buried with Egyptian items.\nWestward, evidence of contact with Libya is generally limited to military expeditions.\nNorthward, evidence of contact with the Aegean includes Minoan relics found in Egypt.\nNew Kingdom (before c. 1070 BC)\nNew Kingdom contacts (everywhere except Greece) seem to have been dominated by military activities. Strong northerly contacts with Crete, Mycenea and the Helladic (on the Aegean islands) seem to have persisted during this time. Southward, Egypt conquered Nubia.\nEastward, the Egyptians successfully conquered the ancient regions of Palestine and Syria, being opposed by the Mitanni and the Hittites. Although, limited trade between the regions seems to have continued, culminating in the world's earliest known peace treaty, between Ramesses II and the Hittites.\nWestward, contact with Libya is again generally limited to military activities.\nLate Period (before c. 343 BC)\nForeign contacts in the Late Period of ancient Egypt seem to have been mere extensions of those of the New Kingdom. Military expeditions again persist, everywhere but in ancient Greece. In fact, there is in this period evidence of Greek soldiers fighting for Egyptian pharaohs and the establishment of a Greek trading post, called Naucratis, within Egypt.\nNubia would become dominated by ancient Egypt in this period. Eventually, however, by the 25th Dynasty, Nubia conquers and controls Egypt, only themselves to become later ousted by the Assyrians. Further, some scholars believe the Assyrians were then later driven out by the Napatans.\nDescribed by Herodotus as a road \"traversed ... in forty days,\" the Darb el-Arbain trade route became by his time an important land route facilitating trade between Nubia and Egypt.\nEastward, Egypt gained control over Cyprus but, despite numerous attempts, never over Palestine.\nAgain Libyan contacts in this era are generally limited to military activities.\nReferences\n#  [https://web.archive.org/web/20080213184210/http://www.comp-archaeology.org/WendorfSAA98.html  Fred Wendorf and Romuald Schild, 2000.
