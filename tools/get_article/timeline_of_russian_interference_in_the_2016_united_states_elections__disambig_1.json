Trump subsequently announces a plan to invest $250&nbsp;million in Russia and brand two luxury residential buildings in Moscow, which doesn't come to fruition. Other people on the trip include Leon Black of Apollo Global Management, Ron Bernstein, Theodore Liebman, and Matthew Calamari. During the trip, Trump brings two women he met the night before to a business meeting, and begins a long-term relationship with a former \"Miss Moscow\".

Later, Keene tells the Senate Intelligence Committee that the plans were dropped partly because Kalishnikov died in December 2013.\n* November 3: Butina emails Erickson asking him to not publish photographs of Keene and Torshin dining together because she needs \"time to think how to position this\".\n* November 6: Erickson begins assisting Butina with a visa application so that she can visit the NRA.

Her then-husband, Artem Klyushin, was later involved in the election interference.

Polonskaya tells Papadopoulos that she is a friend of the Russian ambassador in London and offers to help establish contacts with Russia. Papadopoulos leaves the meeting with the expectation that he will be introduced to the Russian ambassador, but it never occurs. Polonskaya is in regular email contact with Papadopoulos, in one message writing, \"We are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump\".\n** Papadopoulos emails Trump campaign officials about his new Russian contacts. He emails Trump's foreign policy team that he met with Putin's niece and the Russian ambassador in London, and claims the ambassador also acts as the Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia. He writes that the Russian leadership wants to meet with campaign officials in a \"neutral\" city or Moscow \"to discuss U.S.-Russia ties under President Trump\", and that Putin and the Russian leadership are ready to meet with Trump. Clovis replies that he thinks any meetings with Russians should be delayed until after the campaign has a chance to talk with NATO allies and \"we have everyone on the same page.\" In 2018, Papadopoulos tells the House Judiciary Committee that he lied about meeting the Russian ambassador.\n** Papadopoulos searches Google for information on Polonskaya and discovers that she is not Putin's niece.\n* March 25: Lawyer Alexandra Chalupa, who worked in the White House Office of Public Liaison during the Clinton administration and has strong ties to the Ukrainian-American community, shares with the Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S. her concerns that Manafort may get involved with the Trump campaign.

The memoranda, addressed separately to Deripaska and Ukrainian oligarchs Lyovochkin, Akhmetov, and Boris Kolesnikov, describe Manafort's new role with the Trump campaign and express his willingness to continue consulting on Ukrainian politics. Manafort follows up with Kilimnik on April 11 to ensure the messages were sent and seen by the recipients.\n* March 31:\n** At the first meeting of Trump's foreign policy team, which includes Trump and Sessions, Papadopoulos speaks of his connections with Russia, and offers to negotiate a meeting between Trump and Putin. The meeting is held at the yet-to-open Trump International Hotel Washington, D.C. Sessions later states he opposed the idea, and two people who were present support his assertions, but differ in what he objected to and how strongly. In late summer 2017 Papadopoulos and Gordon tell Mueller's team that Trump was \"supportive and receptive to the idea of a meeting with Putin,\" and that Sessions supported Papadopoulos's efforts to arrange a meeting. Papadopoulos's lawyers assert in a September 2018 court filing that Trump nodded in agreement to the offer, and that Sessions said the campaign should look into it.\n** Graff prepares a letter for Trump's signature that declines Prikhodko's March 17 invitation to St. Petersburg because of Trump's busy schedule, but says he otherwise \"would have gladly given every consideration to attending such an important event.\"\n** New York investment banker Robert Foresman emails Graff seeking an in-person meeting with Trump. The email is sent after Trump business associate Mark Burnett brokers an introductory phone call. Foresman writes that he has long-standing personal and professional expertise in Russia and Ukraine, and mentions that he was involved with setting up an early private back channel between Putin and former president George W. Bush. He also writes about an \"approach\" he received from \"senior Kremlin officials\" about Trump. He asks Graff for a meeting with Trump, Lewandowski, or \"another relevant person\" to discuss the approach and other \"concrete things\" that he doesn't want to discuss over \"unsecure email.\"\n* Spring:\n** U.S. intelligence officials' suspicions of Russian meddling in the presidential election grow after their counterparts in Europe warn that Russian money might be flowing into the election.\n** Stone tells associates he is in contact with Assange.\nApril 2016\n* April:\n** Between April and November 2016, there are at least 18 further exchanges by telephone and email between Russian officials and the Trump team.\n** Hackers linked to the GRU gain access to the DNC computer network.\n** Russian social media company SocialPuncher releases an analysis showing that Trump has quoted or retweeted Twitter bots 150 times since the beginning of 2016.\n** The IRA starts buying online ads on social media and other sites.

He also meets with officials at the Russian Prosecutor General's office, where he receives a document full of accusations against Magnitsky. U.S. Embassy officials are worried Rohrabacher may be meeting with FSB agents. The meeting at the prosecutor's office is not on his itinerary. The document is given to Rohrabacher by Deputy Prosecutor Viktor Grin, who is under U.S. sanctions authorized by the Magnitsky Act. Rohrabacher subsequently uses the document in efforts to undermine the Magnitsky Act. His accepting the document from Grin, a sanctioned individual, and using it to influence U.S. government policy leads to a July 21, 2017, complaint being filed against Rohrabacher and his staff director, Paul Behrends, for violating Magnitsky Act sanctions.\n** While in Moscow with Rohrabacher, Rohrabacher's aide Paul Behrends introduces Congressman French Hill to Veselnitskaya and Rinat Akhmetshin.

She responds that she is \"back in St. Petersburg\" but \"would be very pleased to support [Papadopoulos's] initiatives between our two countries\" and \"to meet [him] again.\" Papadopoulos replies that she should introduce him to \"the Russian Ambassador in London\" to talk to him or \"anyone else you recommend, about a potential foreign policy trip to Russia.\" Mifsud is copied on the email exchange. Mifsud writes, \"This is already been agreed. I am flying to Moscow on the 18th for a Valdai meeting, plus other meetings at the Duma. We will talk tomorrow.\" Polonskaya responds that she has \"already alerted my personal links to our conversation and your request,\" that \"we are all very excited the possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump,\" and that \"[t]he Russian Federation would love to welcome him once his candidature would be officially announced.\"\n* April 11: Manafort and Konstantin Kilimnik exchange emails about whether recent press coverage of Manafort joining the Trump campaign can be used to make them \"whole\" with Deripaska.

Timofeev is the program director of the Kremlin-sponsored Valdai Discussion Club and a member of the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC). Papadopoulos and Timofeev communicate for months over email and Skype about potential meetings between Russian government officials and members of the Trump campaign. Later records indicate that Timofeev discussed Papadopoulos with former Russian Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov. In August 2017, Papadopoulos tells Mueller's team that he believed at the time his conversations with Timofeev were monitored.\n** Russian hackers break into the DNC's computers.\n* April 19:\n** Russian hackers create a fictitious online persona, \"Carrie Feehan\", to register the domain DCLeaks.com, paid for in bitcoin, to release stolen documents.\n** The IRA purchases its first pro-Trump ad through its \"Tea Party News\" Instagram account.

They are confronted by a large group of protesters, and some violent clashes ensue. The counterprotest was heavily promoted by IRA accounts on Tumblr, Twitter, and Facebook, and the IRA website blackmatters.com. The IRA uses its Blacktivist account on Facebook to contact activist and academic Barbara Williams Emerson, the daughter of Hosea Williams, to help promote the protests. Afterward, RT blames anti-racist protesters for violence and promotes two videos shot at the event.\n* April 25:\n** Timofeev emails Papadopoulos that he spoke \"to Igor Ivanov[,] the President of RIAC and former Foreign Minister of Russia,\" and relays Ivanov's advice that a \"Moscow visit\" should be arranged through the Russian Embassy in Washington because it is a political matter.\n** Before the second Mifsud meeting, Papadopoulos emails Stephen Miller, informing him that \"[t]he Russian government has an open invitation by Putin for Mr. Trump to meet him when he is ready\" and that \"[t]he advantage of being in London is that these governments tend to speak a bit more openly in 'neutral' cities.\"\n** Foresman emails Graff to remind her of his March 31 email seeking a meeting with Trump, Lewandowski, or another appropriate person.\n* April 26:\n** Michael Isikoff of Yahoo News is the first to report on Manafort's legal dispute with Deripaska in the Cayman Islands.\n** Papadopoulos meets Mifsud in London again at the Andaz Hotel.

The public first learns of the hackings of both presidential campaigns on May 18.\n** Papadopoulos meets with Erika Thompson.\n* April 27:\n** Trump, Sessions and Jared Kushner greet Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington D.C. This contact is repeatedly omitted from testimony or denied. Kushner and Sessions knew in advance that the CNI invited Kislyak to the event. Mueller's team did not find any evidence that Trump or Sessions conversed with Kislyak after Trump's speech. Afterward, Kislyak reports the conversation with Sessions to Moscow. Kushner is the first to publicly admit the Kislyak meeting took place in his prepared statement for Senate investigators on July 24, 2017. Also in attendance are the ambassadors from Italy and Singapore, who are major players in the upcoming sale of stakes in Rosneft.\n** Trump speaks at the Mayflower Hotel at the invitation of The National Interest, the magazine of the CNI. He delivers a speech that calls for improved relations between the U.S. and Russia. The speech was edited by Papadopoulos, though his edits were largely rejected by Stephen Miller, and crafted with the assistance of Simes and Richard Burt. Burt is a board member of the CNI and a lobbyist for Gazprom. Papadopoulos brings the speech to the attention of Mifsud and Polonskaya, and tells Timofeev that it should be considered \"the signal to meet\". Simes later moves to Moscow.\n** Papadopolous and Timofeev speak over Skype.

Fancy Bear, in particular, is suspected of affiliation with Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU).\n** Erickson contacts Trump campaign advisor Rick Dearborn. In an email headed \"Kremlin Connection\", Erickson seeks the advice of Dearborn and Sessions about how to arrange a meeting between Trump and Putin. Erickson suggests making contact at the NRA's annual convention in Kentucky. The communication refers to Torshin, who is under instructions to contact the Trump campaign.\n** At Butina's urging, Christian activist Rick Clay emails Dearborn with the subject \"Russian backdoor overture and dinner invite\" offering a meeting between Trump and Torshin. Dearborn, then Sessions's Chief of Staff, sends an email mentioning a person from West Virginia seeking to connect Trump campaign members with Putin. Dearborn appears \"skeptical\" of the meeting request. Jared Kushner rejects the request. Torshin and Trump Jr. later meet and speak at the NRA convention.\n** Papadopoulos travels to Greece and meets with Greece's president Prokopios Pavlopoulos, defense minister Panos Kammenos, foreign minister Nikos Kotzias, and a former prime minister. Putin makes an official visit to Athens during Papadopoulos's trip.\n** Michael Caputo arranges a meeting in Miami with Stone, Florida-based Russian Henry Oknyansky (a.k.a. \"Henry Greenberg\"), and Ukrainian Alexei Rasin. Rasin claims to have evidence showing Clinton was involved in laundering hundreds of thousands of dollars through Rasin's companies. Stone turns down the offer, telling them that Trump won't pay for opposition research. In June 2018, after many repeated denials, Stone finally admits to knowingly meeting with a Russian national in 2016 when asked about this meeting by The Washington Post. In May 2018, Caputo tells Mueller's team that he did not attend the meeting, did not know what Oknyansky was offering, and did not know payment was asked for until Stone told him later. In July 2018, Oknyansky tells Mueller's team that Rasin was motivated by money, and that Caputo attended the meeting. According to the Mueller Report, Mueller's team is unable to find any evidence that Clinton ever did any business with Rasin.\n** A new American shell company, \"Silver Valley Consulting\", is set up by Russian-born accountant Ilya Bykov for Aras Agalarov.\n** Patten and Kilimnik write a letter for Lyovochkin to use in lobbying a \"high-ranking member\" of the State Department.

Alfa-Bank performs the most lookups during this period, followed by Spectrum Health, and then Heartland Payment Systems, with 76 lookups; beyond that no other visible entity makes more than two. The FBI investigated the activity in the context of links between Trump associates and Russian officials and concluded that there were no such links and that there might be \"an innocuous explanation, like marketing email or spam\". This was undercut in 2021. Through September 2021, U.S. government investigators had been unable to explain the activity, which a 2018 analysis showed \"reasons to doubt that marketing emails were the cause\". A Senate report called it \"unusual activity\". Also in September 2021, The New York Times reported that researchers had found that a Russian-made YotaPhone smartphone, rarely used in the U.S., had accessed networks serving the White House, Trump Tower and Spectrum, which researchers reported to CIA counterintelligence in February 2017.\n** Trump becomes the only remaining candidate for the Republican presidential nomination when John Kasich withdraws.\n** Sater texts Cohen asking when he will be traveling to Moscow.

Cohen replies, \"[w]orks for me.\"\n** Papadopoulos meets with Thompson.\n* May 7: Kilimnik and Manafort meet for breakfast in New York City. According to Manafort, they discuss events in Ukraine, and Manafort gives Kilimnik a briefing on the Trump campaign with the expectation that Kilimnik will repeat the information to people in Ukraine and elsewhere. After the meeting, Manafort instructs Gates to begin passing internal campaign polling data and other updates to Kilimnik to share with Ukrainian oligarchs. Gates periodically sends the data using WhatsApp.\n* May 8: Timofeev proposes connecting Papadopoulos with another Russian official.\n* May 9: Thompson thanks Papadopoulos for meeting her the previous Friday, and they arrange for Papadopoulos to meet with her boss, Australian High Commissioner to London Alexander Downer, at the Kensington Wine Rooms in London.\n* May 10:\n** Dearborn receives an email about arranging a back-channel meeting between Trump and Putin with the subject line \"Kremlin Connection.\" It is sent from a conservative operative who says Russia wants to use the NRA's convention to make \"first contact.\"\n** During their scheduled meeting at the Kensington Wine Rooms followed by the Waterway Pub, Papadopoulos drinks a lot and tells Downer and Thompson that the Russians have politically damaging material on Clinton. Later, Papadopoulos gives investigators conflicting accounts of how much alcohol Downer consumed. After WikiLeaks releases the DNC emails two months later, Australian officials pass this information to American officials, causing the FBI to open a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign.  See Crossfire Hurricane (FBI investigation).\n* May 11: Downer informs Canberra of his interactions with Papadopoulos.\n* May 14: Papadopoulos tells Lewandowski the Russians are interested in hosting Trump.\n* May 15: David Klein, a distant relative of Trump Organization lawyer Jason Greenblatt, emails Clovis about a possible campaign meeting with Chief Rabbi of Russia Berel Lazar.

Both efforts (to arrange a back-channel meeting between Trump and Putin) appear to involve Alexander Torshin, who was instructed to make contact with the Trump campaign. Kushner rebuffs the proposal.\n* May 18: The public are informed that both presidential campaigns are targeted by hackers: \"'We're aware that campaigns and related organizations and individuals are targeted by actors with a variety of motivations — from philosophical differences to espionage — and capabilities — from defacements to intrusions,' said Brian P. Hale, director of public affairs for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\"\n* May 19:\n** Manafort becomes Trump's campaign chairman and chief strategist.

We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips. It should be someone low level in the Campaign so as not to send any signal.\"\n** Two competing rallies are held in Houston to alternately protest against and defend the recently opened Library of Islamic Knowledge at the Islamic Da'wah Center. The \"Stop Islamization of Texas\" rally is organized by the Facebook group \"Heart of Texas\". The Facebook posting for the event encourages participants to bring guns. A spokesman for the group converses with the Houston Press via email but declines to give a name. The other rally, \"Save Islamic Knowledge\", is organized by the Facebook group \"United Muslims of America\" for the same time and location.
