Located in Utqiaġvik, Alaska, it is part of the North Slope Borough. The constitution and by-laws of the native village were established in 1940 under the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) of 1934. An IRA corporation was also created.\nThis corporation is not to be confused with the for-profit village corporation in Barrow, Ukpeaġvik Iñupiat Corporation (UIC), created under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971.\nExternal links\n* [http://thorpe.ou.edu/IRA/barchrtr.html The corporate charter from 1940].\n* [http://thorpe.ou.edu/IRA/barcons.html The constitution and by-laws from 1940].\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070312125212/http://www.asrc.com/home/home.asp Arctic Slope Regional Corporation home].\n* [http://www.500nations.com/tribes/Tribes_Alaska.asp A list of all of the Native Villages that are officially recognized]."
