The Whigs were not a direct continuation of the National Republican Party, but most former National Republicans did join the Whigs in the 1830s. Opponents who received over one percent of the popular vote or ran an official campaign that received Electoral College votes are listed. Offices held prior to Election Day are included, and those held on Election Day have an italicized end date.\nNational Republican Party ticket (1828–1832)\n1828\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=175 |Presidentialnominee\n!colspan=2 |1828 (lost)\n!width=175 |Vice presidentialnominee\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |John Quincy Adams of MA(1767–1848)\n|width=350 |\n;Prior public experience\n*U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands (1794–1797)\n*U.S. Ambassador to Prussia (1797–1801)\n*Massachusetts Senate (1802–1803)\n*U.S. Senate (1803–1808)\n*U.S. Ambassador to Russia (1809–1814)\n*U.S. Ambassador to United Kingdom (1815–1817)\n*U.S. Secretary of State (1817–1825)\n*President (1825–1829)\n;Higher education\n*Leiden University\n*Harvard University (BA, MA)\n|width=350 |\n;Prior public experience\n*Attorney General of Pennsylvania (1811)\n*U.S. Attorney General (1814–1817)\n*Acting U.S. Secretary of State (1817)\n*U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom (1818–1825)\n*U.S. Secretary of the Treasury (1825–1829)\n;Higher education\n*Princeton University (BA)\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |Richard Rush of PA(1780–1859)\n|-\n|Opponent(s)Andrew Jackson (Democratic)\n|colspan=2 |\n;Electoral vote (President)\n*Jackson: 178 (68.2%)\n*Adams: 83 (31.8%)\n;Electoral vote (Vice President)\n*Calhoun: 171 (65.5%)\n*Rush: 83 (31.8%)\n*Smith: 7 (2.7%)\n;Popular vote\n*Jackson/Calhoun: 642,553 (55.9%)\n*Adams/Rush: 500,897 (43.7%)\n|Opponent(s)John C.

Even though the party disintegrated, it continued to win some elections under its own banner, as the \"Opposition Party\", or as the American Party. The American, or \"Know-Nothing\" Party, formed from various prohibitionist and nativist movements, based originally on the secret Know-Nothing lodges. It was a moralistic party that appealed to the middle class fear of corruption, which it identified with Catholics, especially the recent Irish immigrants who seemed to bring crime, corruption, poverty and bossism as soon as they arrived. Remnants of the Whig party met once more in convention in 1856, and nominated the Know Nothing's nominees. While the Democratic ticket was focused in the South, and the Republican ticket in the North, the Know-Nothing ticket was on the ballot all across the country, providing alternatives to James Buchanan and John C. Frémont in every state which had a popular vote.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=175 |Presidentialnominee\n!colspan=2 |1856 (lost)\n!width=175 |Vice presidentialnominee\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |Millard Fillmore of NY(1800–1874)\n|width=350 |\n;Prior public experience\n*New York Assembly (1829–1831)\n*U.S. House of Representatives (1833–1835, 1837–1843)\n**Chair of the House Ways and Means Committee (1841–1843)\n*Comptroller of New York (1848–1849)\n*Vice President (1849–1850)\n*President (1850–1853)\n;Higher education\n*None\n|width=350 |\n;Prior public experience\n*Acting U.S. Minister to Texas (1844–1845)\n*U.S. Minister to Prussia (1846–1849)\n;Higher education\n*University of Nashville\n*United States Military Academy (BS)\n*Transylvania University\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |Andrew Donelson of TN(1799–1871)\n|-\n|Opponent(s)James Buchanan (Democratic)John Frémont (Republican)\n|colspan=2 |\n;Electoral vote\n*Buchanan/Breckinridge: 174 (58.8%)\n*Frémont/Dayton: 114 (38.5%)\n*Fillmore/Donelson: 8 (2.7%)\n;Popular vote:\n*Buchanan/Breckinridge: 1,836,072 (45.3%)\n*Frémont/Dayton: 1,342,345 (33.1%)\n*Fillmore/Donelson: 873,053 (21.5%)\n|Opponent(s)John Breckinridge (Democratic)William Dayton (Republican)\n|}\nConstitutional Union Party ticket (1860)\nThe Republican Party was more driven, in terms of ideology and talent; it surpassed the hapless Whig/American Party coalition in 1856. By 1858 the Republicans controlled majorities in every Northern state, and hence controlled the electoral votes for president in 1860. The tattered remnants of the Coalition's southern wing, under the name, \"Constitutional Union Party\", ran a ticket in order to prevent secession. They were joined by a few anti-secessionist Southern Democrats. Nearly all of the Northern wing had already joined the Republicans; the only free states where the Constitutional Union Party garnered more than 3% were Massachusetts and California.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=175 |Presidentialnominee\n!colspan=2 |1860 (lost)\n!width=175 |Vice presidentialnominee\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |John Bell of TN(1796–1869)\n|width=350 |\n;Prior public experience\n*Tennessee Senate (1817)\n*U.S. House of Representatives (1827–1841)\n**Chair of the House Indian Affairs Committee (1829–1832, 1835–1841)\n**Chair of the House Judiciary Committee (1832–1834)\n**Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives (1834–1835)\n*U.S. Secretary of War (1841)\n*Tennessee House of Representatives (1847)\n*U.S. Senate (1847–1859)\n;Higher education\n*University of Nashville (BA)\n|width=350 |\n;Prior public experience\n*U.S. House of Representatives (1825–1835)\n**Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee (1827–1829)\n*Governor of Massachusetts (1836–1840)\n*U.S. Minister to Great Britain (1841–1845)\n*U.S. Secretary of State (1852–1853)\n*U.S. Senate (1853–1854)\n;Higher education\n*Harvard University (BA, MA)\n*University of Göttingen (PhD)\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |Edward Everett of MA(1794–1865)\n|-\n|Opponent(s)Abraham Lincoln (Republican)Stephen Douglas (Democratic)John Breckinridge (Southern Democrats)\n|colspan=2 |\n;Electoral vote\n*Lincoln/Hamlin: 180 (59.4%)\n*Breckinridge/Lane: 72 (23.8%)\n*Bell/Everett: 39 (12.9%)\n*Douglas/Johnson: 12 (4.0%)\n;Popular vote:\n*Lincoln/Hamlin: 1,865,908 (39.7%)\n*Douglas/Johnson: 1,380,202 (29.5%)\n*Breckinridge/Lane: 848,019 (18.2%)\n*Bell/Everett: 590,901 (12.7%)\n|Opponent(s)Hannibal Hamlin (Republican)Herschel Johnson (Democratic)Joe Lane (Southern Democrats)\n|}\nSee also\n*List of Whig National Conventions\n*History of the United States Whig Party\n*Opposition Party (United States)\n*List of United States Democratic Party presidential tickets\n*List of United States Republican Party presidential tickets\n*List of United States Green Party presidential tickets\n*List of United States Libertarian Party presidential tickets\nReferences"
