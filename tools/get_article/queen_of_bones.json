The film was shot in Ontario.\nRelease\nThe film was screened for distributors, but not for the general public, in the Industry Selects program at the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2023, and had its public premiere at the 2023 Whistler Film Festival.\nIn January 2024, it was announced that Falling Forward Films acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film, which made its U.S. premiere at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival in February 2024. It was later announced that its release would be by Vertical on video on demand which took place on August 1, 2025.\nReception\nIm his review for Variety, Dennis Harvey wrote: \"Without much in the way of psychological depth, or potency to its fantastical elements, Queen of Bones makes a pretty tepid overall impression, given the expectations raised by its basic themes.\" Todd Jorgensen of Cinemaloque stated: \"Emphasizing atmosphere over plot, this bleak episode of folk horror from Canadian director Robert Budreau (Born to Be Blue) is more tedious than thrilling... The strong cast helps inject emotional depth and complexity. However, aside from its period visual flourishes, the deliberately paced film might fit better on stage.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/queen_of_bones Rotten Tomatoes]"
