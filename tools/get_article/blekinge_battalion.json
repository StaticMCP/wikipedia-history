The unit was based in Ronneby.\nHistory\nBlekinge Battalion was raised on 1 January 1887, to serve the conscripts of Blekinge County. Its officers were mainly taken from the disbanded Marine Regiment, and the force's strength was set at 300 men, which, in favor of Halland Battalion, was somewhat reduced according to the 1892 parliamentary decision. The battalion was based in Ronneby and trained at Bredåkra, at present Ronneby Airport.\nAccording to the 1901 Defense Reform, the battalion was disbanded as an independent unit on 31 December 1901. Instead it came together with Småland Grenadier Corps (№ 7) to form Karlskrona Grenadier Regiment on 1 January 1902.\nBarracks and training areas\nWhen the battalion was raised in 1887 it was transferred to Vämö plain and had its staff in Karlskrona. In 1888, the battalion came to be relocated to Bredåkra, and on 1 October 1891 the staff was placed to Ronneby. On 1 May 1890, the battalion's volunteer school was transferred to Bredåkra. After the battalion was disbanded, the battalion's camp at Bredåkra was brought into use by the Swedish Air Force, when Blekinge Wing (F 17) was formed in 1944 and was transferred to Bredåkra. Blekinge Battalion in Ronneby came to house Ågården's nursing home for mentally ill. In 1968 the building was demolished.\nCommanding officers\n*1889–1899: Major James Douglas Haasum\n*1900–1902: Major Curt Johan Elof Rosenblad\nNames, designations and locations\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Name\n! style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Translation\n! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight:bold;\" | From\n!\n! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight:bold;\" | To\n|-\n| style=\"font-style:italic;\" | Kungl.
