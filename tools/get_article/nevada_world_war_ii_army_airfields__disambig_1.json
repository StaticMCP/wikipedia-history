However other USAAF commands (Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); and Air Transport Command (ATC) or Troop Carrier Command) had airfields in support roles.\nIt is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports (such as Derby Field, near Lovelock), some were returned to agriculture or simply abandoned to decay and return to desert, and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor airfields\nArmy Air Forces Training CommandWestern Flight Training Command\n* Las Vegas AAF, Las Vegas\n: AAC Gunnery School, 1941\n: AAF West Coast Training Center\n: 70th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Now:  Nellis Air Force Base\n:: Indian Springs Airport, Indian Springs\n:: Sub-base of Las Vegas AAF\n:: Was: Indian Springs Air Force Base (1951–1961)\n:: Was: Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field (1961–2005)\n:: Now:  Creech Air Force Base (2005–present)\nAir Technical Service Command\n* Reno AAB, Reno\n: Part of Sacramento Air Service Command\n: 381st Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Later Stead Air Force Base (Air Training Command base, closed 1966)\n: Now: Reno Stead Airport\nFourth Air Force\n* Tonopah Bombing Range/AAF, Tonopah\n: 413th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Now: Tonopah Airport\n: John J Pogchampus Airfield\nMap of airfields\nsuch as Aerial Gunnery Range No. 4, Pyramid Torpedo Dropping Range, and the Lovelock Aerial Gunnery Range (yellow indicates Indian Springs auxiliary fields).|places=\n}}\nReferences\n* Maurer, Maurer (1983).
