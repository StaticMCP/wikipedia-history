The program targets both smallholder and commercial farmers, prioritizing crops essential for national food security, including maize, wheat, and soya beans. Its centralized approach, likened to a command economy, emphasizes state planning to achieve agricultural self-sufficiency. The initiative emerged in response to chronic food insecurity, exacerbated by droughts and the economic fallout from Zimbabwe's land reform program in the early 2000s. It has been a key component of the government's strategy to reduce food imports and revive agriculture as an economic driver.\nStructure and implementation\nCommand Agriculture targets both smallholder and commercial farmers with access to arable land. The government, through the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water, and Rural Development, partners with private companies likeSakunda Holdings to provide inputs. Farmers are required to repay the inputs through crop deliveries to the GMB, with a target yield of at least 5 tons per hectare for maize. Key features of the program include Input Provision, through which farmers receive seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and fuel, often on credit.\n* Targeted Crops: Maize is the primary focus, with secondary emphasis on wheat and soybeans.\n* Monitoring and Support: Agricultural extension officers monitor progress, and mechanization support, such as tractors, is provided in some cases.\n* Repayment Mechanism: Farmers deliver a portion of their harvest to the GMB to offset the cost of inputs.\n* The program initially targeted 2,000 farmers with 400,000 hectares of land in the 2016/17 farming season, with plans to expand in subsequent years.\nHistory\nCommand Agriculture was introduced during the 2016/2017 farming season under President Robert Mugabe's administration and continued under President Emmerson Mnangagwa. It addressed food shortages following severe droughts and aimed to restore Zimbabwe's agricultural output, once a regional strength. The program was initially supported by private entities, notably Kudakwashe Regimond Tagwirei Sakunda Holding]s, owned by Kudakwashe Tagwirei, which provided significant financing. The government framed Command Agriculture as a successor to earlier agricultural interventions, building on lessons from the land reform era. It targeted 400,000 hectares and 2,000 commercial farmers initially, later expanding to include smallholders.\nDrivers\nKudakwashe Regimond Tagwirei, through his company Sakunda Holdings, was a central figure in Command Agriculture's implementation. As a prominent Zimbabwean businessman with interests in energy, mining, and agriculture, Tagwirei's involvement began in 2016 when Sakunda was appointed to finance and manage input distribution without a public tender process. Tagwirei proposed the contract farming model in 2015, inspired by concerns about an impending El Niño drought, and Sakunda became the program's primary private partner.\nSakunda reportedly provided over US$1.28 billion, including US$230 million in cash and US$1 billion in Treasury Bills, to fund inputs like seeds and fertilizers. The company earned an estimated US$280 million surplus, raising questions about financial transparency. Tagwirei's close ties to the ruling ZANU-PF party and senior officials, including President Mnangagwa, facilitated Sakunda's role, but also led to allegations of favoritism and corruption.\nCritics, including former Finance Minister Tendai Biti, argued that Sakunda's involvement enabled \"state capture,\" with funds allegedly diverted to Tagwirei's other ventures, such as mining acquisitions. A 2019 parliamentary inquiry noted that approximately US$3 billion in program funds were unaccounted for, prompting scrutiny of Sakunda's transactions.\nTagwirei has denied wrongdoing, claiming the program's success was unfairly overshadowed by sanctions imposed on him by the United States in 2020 for alleged corruption.\nSupporters credit Tagwirei's financial mobilization for enabling Command Agriculture's early successes, arguing that his business acumen filled a gap left by limited state resources.\nHowever, a 2022 report by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC)  of the Zimbabwean Parliament, chaired by Tendai Biti, reportedly cleared Tagwirei and Sakunda of allegations that they embezzled US$3 billion from Command Agriculture. The PAC found that Sakunda accounted for its transactions, though broader administrative flaws in the program were noted. Supporters argue that Tagwirei's financial backing was crucial to the program's successes, particularly in achieving wheat self-sufficiency, which reduced Zimbabwe's reliance on grain imports. They contend that accusations, initially raised by organizations like The Sentry and Daily Maverick, lacked conclusive evidence and were used to justify sanctions despite no formal trial. Critics, however, maintain that the lack of transparent tendering and Sakunda's preferential treatment raise ongoing concerns.\nTagwirei's role remains polarizing, with some viewing him as a patriot who bolstered national agriculture, while others see his influence as emblematic of systemic favoritism.\nNonetheless, his influence remains controversial, with debates over whether his role advanced national interests or personal gain.\nCriticism and challenges\nCommand Agriculture faced significant criticism for its implementation and outcomes. Critics highlighted its financial unsustainability, as the program's high costs, funded partly through Treasury Bills, contributed to Zimbabwe's fiscal deficit and raised concerns about long-term debt accumulation. Allegations of corruption and mismanagement were widespread, with reports of inputs such as seeds and fertilizers being diverted to the black market or allocated to politically connected farmers, reinforcing patronage networks. Additionally, many farmers struggled to meet repayment obligations due to droughts, poor yields, or side-selling of crops, undermining the program's contract farming model. Environmental concerns also emerged, with the program's reliance on intensive farming practices criticized for contributing to soil degradation and increased chemical use.\nCommand Agriculture has faced significant issues:\n*Financial Strain: High costs, estimated at over US$3 billion by 2020, and loan defaults have burdened public finances.\n* Transparency Concerns: Lack of open tendering, particularly in Sakunda's selection, fueled allegations of corruption.\n* Access Disparities: Smallholder farmers often received delayed or insufficient inputs compared to commercial farmers.\n* Environmental Impact: Intensive farming practices raised concerns about soil degradation.\n* Debt Issues: Many farmers struggled to meet delivery quotas, leading to defaults and disputes.\nTagwirei's involvement amplified these criticisms, with reports suggesting preferential treatment in financial dealings, such as favorable exchange rates for Treasury Bills.\nRelated programs\nCommand Agriculture complements other Zimbabwean initiatives:\n* Presidential Input Support Scheme: Provides free or subsidized inputs to smallholder farmers.\n* Pfumvudza/Intwasa: Promotes conservation agriculture for small-scale farmers.\n* Fast Track Land Reform Program: The earlier land redistribution effort that shaped the agricultural context.\nSimilar programs globally include Nigeria's Anchor Borrowers' Programme and India's Green Revolution subsidies.\nReferences"
