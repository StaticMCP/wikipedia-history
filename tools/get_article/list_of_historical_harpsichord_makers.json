The makers are grouped according to which regional building tradition they belong.\nGraphical timeline overview\nBelow is an overview of arguably the most important harpsichord makers whose names are known today, but the list is by no means exhaustive. Some of those listed were founders and members of influential harpsichord building dynasties. Others are known only through one or two instruments that have serendipitously survived, but are included because these instruments have proven a popular inspiration to modern builders who copy them. Some of the makers who started the historically informed harpsichord revival are also included.\nNotes on overview\n* Makers whose dates of birth or death are unknown are marked with an asterisk (). In such cases, the time period indicated by the graphic is demarcated by the earliest or latest reference found to the maker. In many cases these are dates of the  youngest or oldest dated instruments by said maker.\n*Note that the piano rapidly became popular at the end of the 18th century, and many builders at the time built both instruments, until the harpsichord effectively became extinct early in the 19th century.\n* The top line shows composers from each era for orientation. All of these composers, except Schubert and Brahms in the nineteenth century, composed for the harpsichord.\n*At the bottom of the chart are listed events that affect the harpsichord in some way, or give historical context.\nItalian makers\nA more detailed list of historical Italian harpsichord makers.\n* Makers whose dates of birth or death are unknown are marked with an asterisk (). In such cases, the time period indicated by the graphic is demarcated by the earliest or latest reference found to the maker.

In such cases, the time period indicated by the graphic is demarcated by the earliest or latest reference found to the maker. In many cases these are dates of the  youngest or oldest dated instruments by said maker.\n* Makers where only the date of birth is known are marked with a double asterisk ().\n* Notable Flemish-born makers that emigrated to other regions, are listed under the building tradition in which they belonged.\nGerman makers\nA more detailed list of historical German harpsichord makers, including a number of notable German émigrés to other regions.\n|JH  I]]\nfrom:1665 till:1719 color:ger text:M Mietke\nfrom:1665 till:1739 color:ger text:JH Gräbner I\nfrom:1670 till:1695 color:ger text:M Vater*\nfrom:1671 till:1746 color:ger text:JM\nfrom:1675 till:1698 color:ger text: M Kaiser*\nfrom:1676 till:1728 color:ger text:JC Fleischer\nfrom:1678 till:1734 color:ger text:A Silbermann\nfrom:1679 till:1756 color:ger text:C Vater\nfrom:1680 till:1737 color:ger text:CC Fleischer\nfrom:1681 till:1769 color:ger text: L Schmuz\nfrom:1683 till:1763 color:ger text:C Zell\nfrom:1683 till:1753 color:ger text:G Silbermann\nfrom:1689 till:1744 color:ger text:HA Hass\nfrom:1689 till:1759 color: fra text: A Vater\nfrom:1697 till:1766 color:ger text: B Fritz\nfrom:1700 till:1764 color:ger text: PF Brosi\nfrom:1700 till:1769 color:fra text:H Hemsch\nfrom:1700 till:1777 color:ger text:JH Gräbner II\nfrom:1706 till:1757 color:flm text:JD Dulcken\nfrom:1707 till:1778 color:ger text:JH  II\nfrom:1709 till:1780 color:ger text:CE Friederici\nfrom:1709 till:1792 color:eng text:J Kirkman\nfrom:1712 till:1773 color:eng text:B Shudi\nfrom:1713 till:1771 color:ger text:JA Hass\nfrom:1716 till:1781 color:ger text: JL Hellen\nfrom:1721 till:1771 color:ger text: C Schmuz\nfrom:1728 till:1792 color:ger text:JC Oesterlein\nfrom:1728 till:1792 color:ger text:JA Stein\nfrom:1732 till:1781 color:flm text:KF Laescke\nfrom:1733 till:1798 color:ger text: G Mallek\nfrom:1736 till:1808 color:ger text:JG Gräbner\nfrom:1746 till:1747 color:ger text: JC Pantzner*\nfrom:1749 till:1818 color:ger text:KFW Lemme\nfrom:1749 till:1827 color:ger text:KA Gräbner\nfrom:1751 till:1799 color:ger text: E Klinger\nfrom:1755 till:1756 color:ger text: J Leydecker*\nfrom:1778 till:1779 color:ger text: M Blum*\nfrom:1804 till:1805 color:ger text: C Block*\nfrom:1922 till:2015 color:rev text:W Zuckermann\nfrom:1926 till:2014 color:rev text:M Skowroneck\nbar:dummy3\nmark:(line,grid1)\nshift:(5,-3)\nfontsize:XS\ntextcolor:years\nat:1500 text:1500\nat:1600 text:1600\nat:1700 text:1700\nat:1800 text:1800\nat:1900 text:1900\nat:2000 text:2000\n}}\n* Makers whose dates of birth or death are unknown are marked with an asterisk (). In such cases, the time period indicated by the graphic is demarcated by the earliest or latest reference found to the maker. In many cases these are dates of the  youngest or oldest dated instruments by said maker.\n* Notable makers born in German speaking states who emigrated to other countries are included here, but listed under the color of the building tradition in which they made their name.\n* Harpsichord building was often considered a lesser side job for organ builders, while some few were specialized in either harpsichord or clavichord building.\n* Note that in the German speaking world the harpsichord was only one of several instruments referred to as clavier, and keyboard instruments seem to have been used more indiscriminately there than in other regions. It is not surprising that, although invented in Italy,  the piano first became popular in the German states and Austria, added to the plethora of 'clavier' instruments.\nSee also\n* Clavicymbalum\n* Clavicytherium\n* Folding harpsichord\n* History of the harpsichord\n* Spinet\n* Virginals\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://Boalch.org Boalch-Mould Online] A searchable database of 2000+ harpsichord and clavichord makers, 2500 instruments, and 4300 instrument photos.\n* The first edition of Donald Boalch's catalog of harpsichord makers is accessible online at [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015007964250;view=1up;seq=9/ www.hathitrust.org].\nSources\n* Makers of the Harpsichord and Clavichord, 1480 to 1840,  Donald Boalch, 1995, 3. ed,  Oxford University Press\n* History of the harpsichord, Edward L.
