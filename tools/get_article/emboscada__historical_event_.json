By thus dismissing the government of Palmela, that had only come to power 5 months earlier, and replacing it with a Cartista government (described as government of the Cabrais without Cabral) presided over by João Francisco de Saldanha Oliveira e Daun, 1st Duke of Saldanha, the monarch rekindled the revolt and precipitated the civil war known as the Patuleia.\nReferences"
