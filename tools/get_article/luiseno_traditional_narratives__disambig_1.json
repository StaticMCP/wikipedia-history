Particularly prominent are several versions of the Southern California Creation Myth. (See also Traditional narratives (Native California).)\nOnline examples of Luiseño narratives\n* [http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/ca/bosc/index.htm Chinigchinich] by Jerónimo Boscana (ca. 1825)\n* [http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/ca/som/index.htm \"A Saboba Origin-Myth\"] by George Wharton James (1902)\n* [http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/ca/lta/index.htm \"The Legend of Tauquitch and Algoot\"] by George Wharton James (1903)\n* [http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/ca/tmmi/index.htm \"Two Myths of the Mission Indians of California\"] by Alfred L.
