Its population in 2006 was 113,227.\nHistory\nThe provincial electoral district was created in 1999 when provincial ridings were defined to have the same borders as federal ridings. It initially consisted of the County of Prince Edward, and the part of the County of Hastings lying south of and including the townships of Hungerford, Huntingdon and Rawdon, south of but excluding the Village of Stirling, and excluding the City of Trenton.\nIn 2003, it was redefined to consist of the County of Prince Edward and the County of Hastings (except the City of Quinte West).\nFor the 2018 election, the district was dissolved into Bay of Quinte and Hastings—Lennox and Addington.\nMembers of Provincial Parliament\nElection results\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | 2003 general election redistributed results\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"130px\" colspan=\"2\" | Party\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"50px\" | Vote\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"30px\" | %\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Liberal ||align=right| 24,447 ||align=right| 55.16\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Progressive Conservative ||align=right| 13,750 ||align=right| 31.03\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| New Democratic ||align=right| 4,588 ||align=right| 10.35\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Others ||align=right| 1,532 ||align=right| 3.46\n|}\n2007 electoral reform referendum\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; clear:both\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n! colspan=4|2007 Ontario electoral reform referendum\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n! colspan=2 style=\"width: 130px\"|Side\n! style=\"width: 50px\"|Votes\n! style=\"width: 40px\"|%\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"blue\"|\n|First Past the Post\n|29,063\n|66.1\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"green\"|\n|Mixed member proportional\n|14,274\n|33.9\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"white\"|\n!Total valid votes\n| 43,337\n|100.0\n|}\nReferences\nSources\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012015710/http://www.elections.on.ca/en-CA/Tools/PastResults.htm Elections Ontario Past Election Results]"
