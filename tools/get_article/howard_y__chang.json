Previously, he was the Virginia and D. K. Ludwig Professor of Cancer Genomics and of Genetics at the Stanford University School of Medicine, where he was also an HHMI investigator. He is best known for his research on long non-coding RNAs.\nBiography\nChang was born in Taipei, Taiwan, to a family of Taiwanese physicians. His father, Chang Chau-hsiung, was a prominent physician and politician who was a member of the People First Party.\nChang earned a bachelor's degree in biochemistry from Harvard University and completed a Ph.D. in biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and earned a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) at Harvard Medical School as part of the \"Harvard-MIT physician scientist training program\" working in David Baltimore's laboratory. He did his dermatology residency and postdoctoral training at Stanford with Patrick O. Brown. After starting his own lab, his group discovered unexpected transcriptional activity for noncoding DNA and identified HOTAIR which further confirmed the importance of long non-coding RNAs.\nChang is a co-inventor of ATAC-seq, a widely-used epigenomic method introduced in 2013 in collaboration with the lab of William J. Greenleaf.\nAwards\n* 2015 - Paul Marks Prize for Cancer Research\n* 2017 - Elected to the National Academy of Medicine\n* 2018 - NAS Award in Molecular Biology for \"discoveries of long noncoding RNAs and technologies unveiling the noncoding genome.\"\n* 2018 - Investigator, Howard Hughes Medical Institute\n* 2020 - Elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\n* 2020 - Elected to the  National Academy of Sciences\n* 2024 - Lurie Prize in Biomedical Sciences\n* 2024 - King Faisal Prize in Biology,\n* 2024 - Stanley J.
