It was originally established by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo in 2001 to provide 'provisional, democratic self-government'. On 17 February 2008, representatives of the people of Kosovo unilaterally declared Kosovo's independence and subsequently adopted the Constitution of Kosovo, which came into effect on 15 June 2008.\nMembers\nThe Assembly of the Republic of Kosovo is regulated by the Constitution of Kosovo and has 120 directly elected members; 20 are reserved for national minorities as follows:\n* 10 seats for the representatives of the Serbs.\n* 4 seats for the representatives of the Romani, Ashkali and Egyptians.\n* 3 seats for the Bosniaks.\n* 2 seats for the Turks.\n* 1 seat for the Gorans.\nAlbanian is the official language of the majority, but all languages of minorities such as Serbian, Turkish and Bosnian are used, with simultaneous interpretation.\nCommittees\nThe Assembly of the Republic of Kosovo in this legislature has a total of fourteen committees, the number of committees varies depending on the legislature.\n#Committee for Agriculture, Forestry, Rural Development, Infrastructure, Environment, Spatial Planning and Infrastructure\n#Committee for Budget, Labor and Transfers\n#Committee for Economy, Industry, Entrepreneurship and Trade\n#Committee for Education, Science, Technology, Innovation, Culture, Youth and Sports\n#Committee for European Integration\n#Committee for Foreign Affairs and Diaspora\n#Committee for Health and Social Welfare\n#Committee for Human Rights, Gender Equality, Missing Persons, Victims of War Sexual Violence and Petitions\n#Committee for Legislation, Mandates, Immunities, Rules of Procedure of the Assembly and Oversight of the Anti-Corruption Agency\n#Committee for Public Administration, Local Government, Media and Regional Development\n#Committee for Security and Defense\n#Committee for the Rights and Interests of Communities and Returns\n#Oversight Committee of the Kosovo Intelligence Agency\n#Public Finance Oversight Committee\nMost recent election results\nNo party won a majority in the Assembly of Kosovo, with Albin Kurti's Vetëvendosje party receiving around 42% of the vote. Turnout was estimated at 41%. The release of official results was delayed by a failure in the election commission's website that was attributed to an increase in user traffic.\nAssembly building\nThe Assembly Building is located at Ibrahim Rugova Square in Pristina, the capital city of Kosovo. The building, which dates from the 1950s, underwent an extensive refurbishment in 2004 which included the complete redesign of the plenary chamber.\nKuvendi i Kosoves 2018.jpg|Assembly Building\nFile:Kosovo Government Building and Parliament, Prishtina.jpg|Assembly Building\nFile:Parliament of the Republic of Kosovo.jpg|Assembly Building\nFile:Parliament of Republic of Kosovo 2.jpg|Assembly Building\nFile:Assembly of the Republic of Kosovo.jpg|Main entrance on Ibrahim Rugova Square\nFile:Kuvendi i Kosoves.jpg|Additional entrance on KLA Street\nFile:Sheshi Ibrahim Rugova, Prishtine.jpg|Ibrahim Rugova Square\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061230123314/http://www.unmikonline.org/constframework.htm Constitutional Framework]"
