The award was named after the legendary Babe Ruth, who led the American League in homers 12&nbsp;times. It was first awarded to Mark McGwire after his record-setting 1998 season. The award was a ,  bronze statue of Ruth based on a 1920 photo of him following through on a tremendous swing.\nThe Babe Ruth Home Run Award was developed by brothers Jim and Brian Sullivan. Jim was the sculptor, while Brian focused on the marketing of the award. The Sullivans originally wanted to create a life-size statue of Ruth as a tourist attraction similar to the Michael Jordan statue. Unable to secure a sponsor, they created the award to honor Ruth. The trophy was estimated to cost around $4,000 as of 2006, and it was funded by the Sullivans and given on behalf of their company, Sullivan Artworks based in Weymouth, Massachusetts. MLB was not interested in sponsoring the award; the American League already honored its home run champion with a nameless award, and the National League offered the Mel Ott Award. Both the awards received little publicity. The Babe Ruth Home Run Award was usually presented to the recipient by Ruth's daughter, Julia Ruth Stevens, or her son, Tom Stevens.\nKey\nwon the most Babe Ruth Home Run Awards with three.]]\nThe only other multiple-time winner is Ryan Howard.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|Year\n|Year the award was earned.
