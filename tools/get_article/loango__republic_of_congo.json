Located on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, Loango had a population of 21,016 in 2023, the date of the country's last official census.\nSince 2011 it has been the capital of the Kouilou Department and of the new Loango District.\nLocation\nLoango lies on the south coast of the Loango Bay, to the southwest of Diosso, a few kilometers north of the city of Pointe-Noire.\nHistory\nDiosso was the former capital of the Kingdom of Loango and home to its rulers' mausoleum.\nRoman Catholic missionaries were active in Diosso, which had a royal palace.\nThe port of Loango was formerly a major slavery port, but the site has now been abandoned and few traces remain.\nThe first radiotelegraph link in the tropics, between Brazzaville and Loango, was created around 1910 using techniques developed by Joseph Bethenod, chief engineer of the Société française radio-électrique (SFR).\nSee also\n* Loango slavery harbour\nNotes\nSources\n*\n*\n|title=Congo: Loango slavery port abandoned |journal=The Morning Call |via=AfricaNews\n|url=http://www.africanews.com/2017/03/20/congo-loango-slavery-port-abandoned-the-morning-call//|accessdate=2018-01-17}}\n*\n*\n*\n|title=Loango Map — Satellite Images of Loango|work=maplandia\n|url=http://www.maplandia.com/republic-congo/kouilou/loandjili-pointe-noire/loango/|accessdate=2018-01-17}}\n*"
