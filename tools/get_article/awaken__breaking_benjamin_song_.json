Written and produced by the band's lead vocalist Benjamin Burnley and lead guitarist Jasen Rauch, \"Awaken\" is the first song by the band released via BMG, after the band left longtime label Hollywood Records.\nBackground\nThroughout 2022, the band began to write material for a follow-up to the band's sixth studio album Ember (2018). Intending to release a new studio album, guitarist Jasen Rauch revealed in May 2023 that new material was currently in production and hoped that the band would release new music within the next year. In October 2024, it was revealed that the band had left longtime label Hollywood Records and had signed with BMG and was preparing to release new music imminently. On October 16, the band released \"Awaken\", their first new music in five years as the lead single from their upcoming untitled seventh studio album.\nMusic video\nThe official music video for \"Awaken\" was released on January 10, 2025 and directed by Kyle Coogan. The music video takes place in a tundra setting, with a storyline of a woman exploring a mountainous region while coming across ice caves, ruins and prehistoric skeletons. It is intertwined with the band performing the song in the snow throughout the whole music video.\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\nBreaking Benjamin\n* Benjamin Burnley – lead vocals, guitar\n* Jasen Rauch – lead guitar, programming\n* Keith Wallen – rhythm guitar, backing vocals,\n* Aaron Bruch – bass, backing vocals\n* Shaun Foist – drums\nAdditional personnel\n* Benjamin Burnley – production\n* Jasen Rauch – production, audio engineer, digital editing\n* Zakk Cervini – mixing, mastering, audio engineer\n* Julian Gargiulo – mixing assistance\n* Kevin Skaff – audio engineer\n* Carlos Chávez – audio engineer\n* Joe Rickard – vocal engineer\n* Mike Warren – audio engineer\n* Paul DeCarli – digital editing\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for \"Awaken\"\n!scope=\"col\"| Chart (2024–25)\n!scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Canada Rock (Billboard)\n| 13\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Digital Song Sales (Billboard)\n| 6\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Hot Rock & Alternative Songs (Billboard)\n| 17\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Rock Airplay (Billboard)\n| 3\n|}\nReferences"
