In 1897, the ACR joined the Central Revolutionary Committee led by Édouard Vaillant, which became the Socialist Revolutionary Party (PSR). The PSR was the second largest Marxist party in France behind the French Workers' Party (POF) led by Jules Guesde. The ACR apparently operated semi-autonomously within the PSR before the ACR and PSR merged into the Socialist Party of France in 1902.\nSee also\n*History of the Left in France\n*Revolutionary Socialist Workers' Party\n*Socialist Revolutionary Party\n*Blanquism"
