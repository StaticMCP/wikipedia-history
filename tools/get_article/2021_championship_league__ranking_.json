The event featured 128 players and was played as three rounds of round-robin groups of four, before a best-of-five final. It was the 17th edition of the Championship League and the first ranking tournament of the 2021–22 snooker season. It was one of two Championship League events held over the season, with a following invitational event held as the 2022 Championship League (invitational).\nKyren Wilson was the defending champion, having defeated Judd Trump 3–1 in the final of the September to October 2020 edition of the tournament. Wilson's title defence ended in Stage Three, where he finished third in his group. David Gilbert won the tournament, defeating Mark Allen 3–1 to win his first ranking title. Allen made the highest  of the event, a 146.\nFormat\nThe 2021 Championship League was hosted from 18 July to 13 August 2021 at the Morningside Arena in Leicester, England.\n128 players took part in the event. The competition began with 32 rounds of group matches with each group consisting of four players. Two groups were played to a finish every day during three blocks, from 18 to 23 July, from 26 to 30 July and from 2 to 6 August, using a two-table setup in the arena. The groups were contested using a round-robin format, with six matches played in each group. All matches in group play were played as best-of-four frames, with three points awarded for a win and one point for a draw. Group positions were determined by points scored, frame difference and then head-to-head results between players who were tied. Places that were still tied were then determined by the highest  made in the group.\nThe 32 players that topped the group tables qualified for the group winners' stage, consisting of eight groups of four players. The eight winners from the group winners' stage qualified for the two final groups, with the final taking place later on the same day. The winner took the Championship League title and a place at the 2021 Champion of Champions.\nPrize fund\nThe breakdown of prize money for the tournament is shown below.\n;Stage One\n*Winner: £3,000\n*Runner-up: £2,000\n*Third place: £1,000\n*Fourth place: £0\n;Stage Two\n*Winner: £4,000\n*Runner-up: £3,000\n*Third place: £2,000\n*Fourth place: £1,000\n;Stage Three\n*Winner: £6,000\n*Runner-up: £4,000\n*Third place: £2,000\n*Fourth place: £1,000\n;Final\n*Winner: £20,000\n*Runner-up: £10,000\n*Tournament total: £328,000\nSummary\nwon his first ranking event.]]\nThe first stage was held over 32 groups with 128 participants between 18 July and 6 August.
