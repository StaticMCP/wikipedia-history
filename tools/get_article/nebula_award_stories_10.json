It was first published in the United Kingdom in hardcover by Gollancz in November 1975. The first American edition was published in hardcover by Harper & Row in December of the same year. Paperback editions followed from Berkley Medallion in the U.S. in December 1976, and Corgi in the U.K. in June 1977. The American editions bore the variant title Nebula Award Stories Ten. The book has also been published in German.\nSummary\nThe book collects pieces published in 1973 and 1974 that won or were nominated for the Nebula Awards for novella, novelette and short story for the year 1975 and nonfiction pieces related to the awards, together with an introduction by the editor. The essays by Dickson and Scholes appeared in the American editions only. The non-winning pieces nominated for Best Novella were omitted from all editions.\nContents\n*\"Introduction\" (James Gunn)\n*\"The Engine at Heartspring's Center\" [Best Short Story nominee, 1975] (Roger Zelazny)\n*\"If the Stars Are Gods\" [Best Novelette winner, 1975] (Gordon Eklund and Gregory Benford)\n*\"Twilla\" [Best Novelette nominee, 1975] (Tom Reamy)\n*\"Ten Years of Nebula Awards\" (Gordon R.

A review in Locus strongly recommended the collection, highlighting Silverberg's \"Born with the Dead\" as \"outstanding\".\nThe anthology was also reviewed by Martin Last in The Science Fiction Review Monthly, January 1976 and Richard Delap in ''Delap's F & SF Review'', March 1976.\nAwards\nThe book placed ninth in the 1976 Locus Poll Award for Best Anthology.\nNotes"
