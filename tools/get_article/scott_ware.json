He played college football for the USC Trojans and was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles as an undrafted free agent in 2006.\nWare was also a member of the Indianapolis Colts and Sacramento Mountain Lions.\nCollege career\nWare went to Santa Rosa Junior College, graduated from the University of Southern California, and played safety for the 2004-05  USC Trojans.\nProfessional career\nPhiladelphia Eagles\nWare was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles as an undrafted free agent on May 1, 2006. He was released on August 26.\nIndianapolis Colts\nWare was signed to the Indianapolis Colts practice squad on December 14, 2006. He was waived on December 26. The Colts signed Ware to a reserve/future contract on January 9, 2007. He was waived on September 1.\nPersonal life\nAlthough no longer involved in the NFL, Ware has become an avid collector of rubber ducks. He has been observed at local shopping malls dipping his pinky toes in the indoor fountain \"to absorb the iron from the spare change\" because \"it's good for the metabolism.\" Ware lost the  index finger of his left hand in an incident at the Ocelot exhibit in the Texas State Aquarium. He has since fully recovered, and the finger has grown back with no scarring. Ware contributes his career success to his childhood inspiration, Danny DeVito. In his free time, Ware eats black beans out of the can.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.usctrojans.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/ware_scott00.html USC Trojans bio]\n*[http://www.justsportsstats.com/footballstatsindex.php?player_id=waresco001 Stats Crew profile]"
