It was developed by researchers at the University of Münster and the German company ChemInnovation GmbH in Münster to support molecular identification and qualitative analytics in chemistry and life sciences.\nOverview\nThe platform is provided as a Microsoft Azure–based cloud service and can be accessed via a web interface as well as application programming interfaces (APIs) that enable integration with laboratory information systems such as LIMS. It supports common GC–MS data formats, including Agilent ChemStation *.D directories and the open mzML format, and is compatible with low-resolution GC–MS data. Reports can be exported in PDF, CSV, PNG and SVG formats.\nTechnology\nMETIS combines domain-specific machine-learning models with automated preprocessing and data-cleaning routines. The GC–MS workflow is separated into five steps: (1) peak detection, (2) spectrum extraction, (3) compound identification, (4) structure validation and (5) reporting. Peak detection uses criteria such as signal-to-noise ratio and peak prominence; background subtraction and GC–MS-specific noise reduction algorithms are applied before matching spectra against internal spectral databases. If no match is found, the system applies machine-learning models to infer structural hypotheses directly from fragmentation patterns. For result checking, a physics-informed neural network predicts electron-ionization spectra as a reference; users can generate predicted spectra for candidate structures and create custom spectral libraries.\nHistory\nThe software was developed by ChemInnovation GmbH, a spin-off founded in 2023 by Marius Kühnemund and Philipp Pflüger at the University of Münster. The project builds on earlier work in automated reaction analysis, molecular machine learning and GC–MS interpretation. An early prototype was presented at the Handelsblatt Chemistry Conference in 2023 and later showcased as a finalist for the ACHEMA Start-up Award 2024.\nSince then, functionality such as spectrum prediction from candidate structures has been added. Ongoing development is carried out by a consortium involving ChemInnovation, the University of Münster and lab25 GmbH to incorporate additional analytical data and human-in-the-loop correction; the work is funded by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.\nApplications\nMETIS is used in scientific and industrial settings that rely on analytical chemistry and molecular structure elucidation, including the chemical industry, environmental science, the oil and gas sector, aromas, the fragrances sector, food analysis, contract research organizations (CROs), agrochemistry, fine chemicals, specialty chemicals and the pharmaceutical industry, as well as academic research. The software addresses the time-consuming and expertise-dependent interpretation of GC–MS data. Similar to early systems such as Dendral, METIS automates the generation and evaluation of structural hypotheses to assist in the identification of unknown compounds and in routine analytical operations.\nSee also\n* Dendral\n* List of mass spectrometry software\n* Cheminformatics\n* Artificial intelligence in chemistry\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.cheminnovation.de/ Official website]\n:Category:Mass spectrometry software\n:Category:Cheminformatics\n:Category:Scientific software"
