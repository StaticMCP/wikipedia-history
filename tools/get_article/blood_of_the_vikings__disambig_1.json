The study of history and archaeology alone could not answer this question.\nBBC Two Controller Jane Root described the station's work with UCL as a unique, nationwide project.\nThe research confirmed that the Vikings did not just raid and retreat to Scandinavia, but settled in Britain for years.  They left their genetic pattern in some parts of the UK population.  Concentrations of Norwegian genetic heritage were found in part of Cumbria in northwest England, the area around Penrith, the Shetland and Orkney Islands and the far north of the Scottish mainland.\nIn addition the research revealed surprising new information about Celtic and Anglo-Saxon heritage on the British mainland.  Men who were tested in mainland Scotland had a percentage of Celtic genetic heritage similar to the population of southern England.  This showed 1) that Celtic heritage persisted among men in southern England after Anglo-Saxon settlement; and 2) that the Scots were not predominantly Celtic.\nThe series included clips from Richard Fleischer's 1958 film The Vikings starring Kirk Douglas to illustrate common modern attitudes towards the Vikings.\nEpisodes\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
