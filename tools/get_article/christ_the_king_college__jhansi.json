It is affiliated with the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE / ISC).\nCollege history\nChrist the King College was established in 1940 in the Civil Lines by the first bishop of Jhansi, Bishop Francis Xavier Fenech, from Malta, Europe. Its first principal was Br. Leo (OFM, CAP) from Mahim, Bombay, who remained for 18 years.\nIn 1940, Christ the King College was shifted to the present St. Joseph’s School in the cantonment area, with its first headmaster \"Mr. Eric D'Souza\". Initially, the school was recognised by Senior Cambridge. However, the students could also appear for the Uttar Pradesh State Board. The recognition of the ICSE/ISC Board was obtained in 1975 by Fr. Tony Late and the first batch of ICSE (X) was passed out in December 1976. In 1977, the academic year was changed from January–December to April–March, and therefore, the first batch of ISC (XII) was passed out in March 1979. After Fr. Augustine took over, and during his tenure, the school touched its zenith, with many students being selected in IITs, PMTs, Olympiads, the NDA, and various exams at the national, state, and regional levels. However, due to the increasing number of students, the school did not get the permission to expand in the cantonment area. As a result, a primary section was constructed and shifted to civil lines in 1978.\nAlumni\nIts Alumni are called CKCians, and sometimes they are unofficially called Old Collegians.\nNational Cadet Corps\nThe motto of NCC is 'Unity & Discipline', adopted on 23 Dec 1957. In living up to its motto, the NCC strives to be one of the greatest cohesive forces of the nation, bringing together the youth hailing from different parts of the country and moulding them into united, secular and disciplined citizens of the nation. NCC training in college is also regular, with a proper dress code. The college organizes regular camps for the NCC cadets and certifies with A grade certificates for those who joined NCC and regulars for training and camps.\nPrincipals of Christ the King College\nThe following are the Rev.
