A significant number of American colonists stayed loyal to the British Crown and as Loyalists fought on the British side while opposite were a significant amount of colonists called Patriots who fought on the American side. In some localities, there was fierce fighting between Americans including gruesome instances of hanging, drawing, and quartering on both sides.\n* As early as 1789, David Ramsay, an American patriot historian, wrote in his History of the American Revolution that \"Many circumstances concurred to make the American war particularly calamitous. It was originally a civil war in the estimation of both parties.\" Framing the American Revolutionary War as a civil war is gaining increasing examination.\n* A group of merchants in Bristol wrote to King George III in 1775 voicing their \"most anxious apprehensions for ourselves and Posterity that we behold the growing distractions in America threaten” and ask for their majesty’s “Wisdom and Goodness\" to save them from \"a lasting and ruinous Civil War\".\n* The \"constrained voice\" is a good synopsis of how the British viewed the American Revolutionary War, from anxiety to a foreboding sense of the conflict being a civil war.\n* In the early stages of the rebellion by the American colonists, most of them still saw themselves as English subjects who were being denied their rights as such. James Otis reportedly said that \"Taxation without representation is tyranny\", in protest of the lack of colonial representation in Parliament. What made the American Revolution look most like a civil war, though, was the reality that about one-third of the colonists, known as loyalists (or Tories), continued to support and fought on the side of the crown.|group=Note}} It became a larger international war in 1778 once France joined.\n* Encyclopædia Britannica: \"Until early in 1778 the conflict was a civil war within the British Empire, but afterward it became an international war as France (in 1778) and Spain (in 1779) joined the colonies against Britain. Meanwhile, the Netherlands, which provided both official recognition of the United States and financial support for it, was engaged in its own war against Britain (see Anglo-Dutch Wars).\"|group=Note}}\n* Signing of the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776.\n* Great Britain would not recognize American independence until signing the 1783 Treaty of Paris.\n* Great Britain cedes, generally, all mainland territories east of the Mississippi River, south of the Great Lakes, and north of the Floridas to the United States.\n* Great Britain cedes Tobago and Senegal to France.\n* Great Britain cedes Menorca, West Florida, and East Florida to Spain.\n|\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n!scope=row style=\"background:#efefef\"| Cherokee–American wars(1776–1795)Part of the American Indian WarsLocation: Old Southwest daughter by the Cherokee]]\n|style=\"background:#efefef\"| |Choctaw}}\n|style=\"background:#efefef\"| Cherokee\nSupported by:\n*  Spain (1783–1788)\n|style=\"Background:#AF9\"| US-allied victory\n|\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n!scope=row style=\"background:#efefef\"|Moroccan seizure of the Betsey(1784)Location: Off the coast of Cádiz, Spain\n|style=\"background:#efefef\"|\n|style=\"background:#efefef\"|\n| style=\"background:#F88\" |Moroccan victory\n* Merchant ship Betsey captured\n* U.S. forced to pay $30,000 ransom\n* Moroccan–American Treaty of Friendship signed, initiating the longest unbroken diplomatic relationship in U.S. history\n|President of the Continental Congress: Vacant (until November 30, 1784); Richard Henry Lee\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|style=\"background:#efefef\"| Northwest Indian War(1785–1793)Part of the American Indian WarsLocation: Northwest Territory]]\n|style=\"background:#efefef\"| |Chickasaw|Choctaw}}\n|style=\"background:#efefef\"|\nGreat Britain\n*  British North America\n|style=\"background:#AF9\"| US-allied victory\n* Treaty of Greenville (1795)\n* American occupation of the Northwest Territory\n|\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n!scope=row style=\"background:#efefef\"|American–Algerian War(1785–1795)Location: Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean\n|style=\"background:#efefef\"|\n|style=\"background:#efefef\"|  Regency of Algiers\n| style=\"background:#F88\" | Algerian victory\n* The United States is unable to defend itself except with merchant marines.\n*Establishment of the United States Navy through the Naval Act of 1794.\n* The U.S. government agrees to pay an annual tribute of $21,600.\n* $1 million tribute offered to the Dey.\n|\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n!scope=row style=\"background:#efefef\"|Quasi-War(1798–1800)Location: Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean]]\n|style=\"background:#efefef\"|\n-----\nCo-belligerent:\n('See: Invasion of Curaçao (1800))\n|style=\"background:#efefef\"|  French Republic\n*  Guadeloupe\nSpain (Neutral Defender)\n(See: Battle of Puerto Plata Harbor)\n|style=\"background:#BBF\"| Inconclusive\nConvention of 1800\n* Peaceful cessation of Franco-American alliance\n* End of French privateer attacks on American shipping\n* American neutrality and renunciation of claims by France\n|President of the United States:John Adams(March 4, 1797 – March 4, 1801)\n|}\nSee also\n* List of notable deployments of U.S. military forces overseas\n* Timeline of United States military operations\n* Military history of the United States\n* United States Armed Forces\n* List of American military installations\n* List of United States drone bases\n* Social history of soldiers and veterans in the United States\n* Confederation of United States of America\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.HIIK.de Heidelberg Institute for International Conflict Research (HIIK)]\n** [https://web.archive.org/web/20080513074927/http://www.hiik.de/en/konfliktbarometer/index.html Conflict Barometer] – Describes recent trends in conflict development, escalations, and settlements\n* [http://library.uta.edu/usmexicwar/ A Continent Divided: The U.S.-Mexico War], Center for Greater Southwestern Studies, the University of Texas at Arlington\n* [http://histropedia.com/timeline/1fjqtpg9bg0t Timeline of wars involving the United States], Histropedia\n* [https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RS21405.pdf U.S. Periods of War and Dates of Recent Conflicts], Congressional Research Service"
