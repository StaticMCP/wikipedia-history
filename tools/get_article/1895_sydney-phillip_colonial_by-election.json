Dean was convicted and sentenced to death, however Meagher managed to persuade two out of three royal commissioners to find that the conviction was unsafe and, as a result, Dean was pardoned. The publicity from the case helped Meagher win the election for Sydney-Phillip in July 1895. Rumours began to circulate that Dean had confessed to buying the poison. Jack Want, the Attorney General, read to the Legislative Council an account by Sir Julian Salomons of his conversation with Meagher, in which Meagher told Salomons that Dean had confessed to Meagher. Meagher initially denied the accusation, however subsequently confessed stating \"I am determined to endure mental torture no longer, nor to stifle the voice of truth ... This awful lesson of my life I will endeavour to atone for in another clime. My resignation of my seat in Parliament accompanies this declaration\".\nSir Henry Parkes announced himself as a candidate, however he withdrew prior to the nominations.\nDates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

It would take 25 years and an act of parliament before he was re-admitted as a solicitor.\nSee also\n*Electoral results for the district of Sydney-Phillip\n*List of New South Wales state by-elections\nNotes\nReferences"
