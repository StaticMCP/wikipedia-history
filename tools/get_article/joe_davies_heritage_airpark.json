The park is located adjacent to the United States Air Force Plant 42 and the Blackbird Airpark Museum. All of the aircraft on display were donated or loaned to the city of Palmdale, which owns and operates the park.\nHistory\nThe Palmdale Plant 42 Heritage Airpark was established on October 20, 1998, by the city of Palmdale and the United States Air Force on land donated to the city of Palmdale by Lockheed Martin Aeronautics. The park is located at 2001 East Avenue P. It is adjacent to United States Air Force Plant 42 to the north and the Blackbird Airpark Museum to the east. The aviation museum was established commemorate the various aircraft which were designed, built, and flown at Plant 42.\nIn 2008, park was renamed to the Joe Davies Heritage Airpark at Palmdale Plant 42 to honor Joe Davies, a resident of Palmdale who served as the commander of Plant 42 from 1963 to 1967 and later served three terms on the Palmdale city council from 1988 to 1996. A memorial plaque was installed at the park in 2021. The park has a program called \"Adopt-a-Plane\" which cleans aircraft on a bi-weekly or monthly basis. Admission and parking are free, and the park is open to the public on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Most of its employees are volunteers.\nAircraft on display\nThe aviation museum has a total of 21 retired military aircraft and a 1:8 scale model on display.\nThe first aircraft to be put on display at the park was a North American F-100 Super Sabre (Bureau number: 54–2299). On September 12, 2014, one of the two Boeing 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (Tail number: N911NA) was put on display at the park as a part of a long-term loan from NASA to the city of Palmdale. According to the city of Palmdale, the Joe Davies Heritage Airpark could display a Boeing 767, a Convair F-102 Delta Dagger, a Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, a Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, a Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, a Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit, and a Rockwell-MBB X-31 in the future. The park plans to have over 40 aircraft on display. In addition to the aircraft on display, the aviation museum also uses various salvaged aircraft parts as decoration elements.
