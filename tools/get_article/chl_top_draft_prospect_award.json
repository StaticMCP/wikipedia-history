The award was first given in 1991, but not awarded from 2003 to 2005. The Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) awards the equivalent Michael Bossy Trophy, awarded to the top draft prospect in its league. There is no equivalent award in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) or Western Hockey League (WHL).\nRecipients\nList of recipients of the CHL Top Draft Prospect Award.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
