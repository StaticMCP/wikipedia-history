It has a single long, grass-like leaf and up to fifteen dark blue to purplish, sometimes white or pinkish flowers with white or pink tufts on top of the anther. It is readily distinguished by its northerly distribution and early flowering period.\nDescription\nThelymitra queenslandica is a tuberous, perennial herb with a single erect, channelled, green, linear to lance-shaped leaf  long and  wide with a purplish base. Between four and fifteen dark blue to purplish, sometimes white or pinkish flowers  wide are borne on a flowering stem  tall. The sepals and petals are  long and  wide. The column is pale blue to pinkish,  long and  wide. The lobe on the top of the anther is tan-coloured to brown with a yellow tip. The side lobes curve upwards and have mop-like tufts of white or pink hairs. The flowers are long-lasting, insect-pollinated and open on warm sunny days. Flowering occurs from June to September.\nTaxonomy and naming\nThelymitra queenslandica was first formally described in 2013 by Jeff Jeanes from a specimen collected near Herberton by David Jones and the description was published in Muelleria. The specific epithet (queenslandica) refers to \"the state of Queensland where this species is apparently endemic.\"\nDistribution and habitat\nThe northern sun orchid mainly grows on forested slopes and occurs between Paluma and Mount Finnigan.\nReferences"
