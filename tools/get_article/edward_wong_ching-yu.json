He attended St Joseph's Primary School and St Joseph's College.\nIn 2001, he began reading law at the City University of Hong Kong (CityUHK). In 2002, he was elected President of the Law Students' Society of CityUHK.\nWong earned a Bachelor of Laws with Honours in 2004, Postgraduate Certificate in Laws at CityUHK in 2005, a Master of Arts in Philosophy at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2016, a Master of Public Administration from the University of Hong Kong in 2018, and a Master of Studies in International Relations at the University of Cambridge in 2024.\nPrivate practice\nWong completed his pupillage and began practising as a barrister at The Chambers of Anthony Francis Neoh, QC, SC, JP in 2006. Over the years, he handled several notable cases, including HKSAR v Tse Sui Luen (謝瑞麟) (DCCC 350/2006) concerning conspiracy to offer advantages to travel agents, HKSAR v Jockey Club Kau Sai Chau Public Golf Course Co Ltd (HCMA 641/2009), HKSAR v Lew Mon-hung (劉夢熊) concerning perverting the course of justice (DCCC 819/2013), HKSAR v Au Yeung Lai Hung Doris [2013] 3 HKLRD 576 in which the Court of Appeal laid down guiding principles on costs in criminal cases, and HKSAR v Lau Shing Chung Simon (2015) 18 HKCFAR 50  in which the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal  ruled on the admissibility of hearsay evidence.\nIn addition to his private practice, Wong served as a Deputy Magistrate of the Judiciary of Hong Kong from 2014 to 2017.\nJudicial career\nWong was appointed as a Permanent Magistrate of the Judiciary of Hong Kong in 2017 and has since presided in all seven Magistrates' court (Hong Kong). In 2023 and 2025, he was appointed as a Deputy District Judge of the District Court (Hong Kong).\nCases presided over by Wong include: a former HSBC vice president receiving\nadvantages, sentenced to 9 months’ imprisonment; a police officer possessing dangerous\ndrugs, sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment; a postman defrauding for overtime\nallowances; an industrial accident at the Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macao Bridge construction\nsite resulting in one death and four injuries; a Labour Department inspector committing\ncruelty to animals, sentenced to 3 weeks’ imprisonment; two quarantine-exempt flight\nattendants who went out in violation of rules after returning to Hong Kong, sentenced to\n8 weeks’ imprisonment; and four Food and Environmental Hygiene Department health\ninspectors charged with conspiracy to steal food testing samples.\nAttempted knife attack\nOn November 4, 2024, a man was involved in an attempted knife attack at the Kowloon City\nMagistrates' Courts. He was swiftly subdued by on-site police officers. The individual had previously been convicted of indecent assault and sentenced to three weeks in prison by Wong in 2021. His appeals against the conviction were dismissed by the Court of First Instance (Hong Kong) of the High Court in April 2024 and Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal in October 2024.\nThe individual has been charged with attempted wounding with intent and was remanded in Siu Lam Psychiatric Centre under special watch.\nIn the aftermath of the incident, the Judiciary of Hong Kong, the Department of Justice (Hong Kong), and the\nHong Kong Bar Association issued strong condemnations of any attacks on judicial\nofficials.\nAs a result, the Judiciary of Hong Kong has begun implementing enhanced security measures at Magistrates' Courts, which include increased security screenings and additional personnel. Furthermore, the Judiciary of Hong Kong is collaborating closely with the Police to bolster patrols and other safety protocols, ensuring the protection of judges, judicial staff, and court users.\nAn editorial in the South China Morning Post underscored that the rule of law hinges on the safety of Hong Kong's judges. It emphasized that attacks on judges are unacceptable, noting that in recent years, some judges in the Region have faced threats, including death threats and harmful substances sent in letters. While safeguarding the courts requires balancing security with operational efficiency, ensuring the safety of judges should remain a top priority.\nReferences"
