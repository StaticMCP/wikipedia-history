They had four children: Eric, Jay, Lee, and Katie.\nAn animal lover, Howard went hunting with a group of friends every year; however, his actual purpose was to fire off rounds but not hit the deer so as to make them wary during the hunting season; in ten years of such conservation-oriented hunting, he did not succeed in killing one animal and maintained a close bond of friendship with his hunting buddies who said that he \"just can't hit the broadside of a barn.\"\nDeath\nHe died on July 2, 1998, at the age of 61 of throat cancer. He was buried in the Texas State Cemetery at Austin, Travis County, Texas, USA. He is survived by his wife, children, and ten grandchildren.\nReferences"
