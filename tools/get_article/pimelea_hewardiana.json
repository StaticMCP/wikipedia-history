It is a shrub with narrowly elliptic leaves and head-like clusters of 7 to 34 unisexual yellow flowers.\nDescription\nPimelea hewardiana is a shrub that typically grows to a height of , it young stems covered with short hairs. The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs, narrowly elliptic to egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base,  long,  wide on a short petiole. The lower surface of the leaves is paler than the upper surface. The flowers are arranged on the ends of branches or in leaf axils in head-like, compact clusters of 7 to 34, surrounded by 4 glabrous, leaf-like involucral bracts  long and  wide. The flowers are unisexual and yellow, the flower tube  long, the sepals  long, and the stamens in male flowers shorter than the sepals. Flowering mainly occurs from April to October.\nTaxonomy\nPimelea hewardiana was first formally described in 1854 by Carl Meissner in the journal Linnaea. The specific epithet (hewardiana) honours the botanist, Robert Heward (1791–1877).\nDistribution and habitat\nForked rice-flower grows in mallee shrubland, usually in rocky ground, from the Glenelg River to the Bacchus Marsh area, west of Melbourne. It was formerly found in south-eastern South Australia, but is now considered to be extinct in that state.\nConservation status\nThis species is listed as \"rare\" on the Department of Sustainability and Environment's Advisory List of Rare Or Threatened Plants In Victoria.\nReferences"
