Tomboy is part of the GNOME desktop environment. As Ubuntu changed over time and its cloud synchronization software Ubuntu One came and went, Tomboy inspired various forks and clones. Its interface is a word processor with a wiki-like linking system to connect notes together. Words in the note body that match existing note titles become hyperlinks automatically, making it simple to construct a personal wiki. For example, repeated references to favorite artists would be automatically highlighted in notes containing their names. As of version 1.6 (2010), it supports text entries and hyperlinks to the World Wide Web, but not graphic image linking or embedding.\nDevelopment of the original Tomboy software ceased in 2017. Starting in 2017 the development team rewrote the software from scratch, for ease of maintenance and installation, renaming it tomboy-ng.  Tomboy-ng is written in Free Pascal.\nFeatures\nSome of the editing features supported:\n* Text highlighting\n* Inline spell checking using GtkSpell\n* Automatic hyperlinking of Web and email addresses\n* Undo/redo\n* Font styling and sizing\n* Bulleted lists\n* Note synchronization over SSH, WebDAV, Ubuntu One, or the Tomboy REST API that is implemented by several server applications\nPlugins\nTomboy supports several plugins, including:\n* Evolution mail links\n* Galago/Pidgin presence\n* Note of the day (disabled by default)\n* Fixed width text\n* HTML export\n* LaTeX math (in the package , not installed by default)\n* Print\nPorts\n* Conboy: a Tomboy port to the Maemo platform written in the C language\n* Gnote: a conversion of the Tomboy code to the C++ language, but is not cross-platform\n* libktomgirl: a platform-independent library that reads and writes the Tomboy File Format\n* Tomdroid: an effort to produce a Tomboy-compatbile notetaking app for the Android operating system.\nSee also\n* Comparison of note-taking software\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
