Whereas the national honours of Nigeria are within the gift of the Federal Government itself, titles in the Nigerian chieftaincy system fall under the purview of the monarchs of the sub-national traditional states of the country. A number of the Heads of State that have served since Independence in 1960 have therefore held such traditional titles, either due to their hereditary background or to their personal achievement.\nMonarch (1960–1963)\nThe succession to the Nigerian throne was the same as the succession to the British one.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=3| Queen of Nigeria\n! colspan=3| Reign\n! rowspan=2| Royal House\n! rowspan=2| Title\n|-\n!\n!

However, her official title of \"Queen of Nigeria\" was often translated into the national languages of the country during her reign (for example, Yoruba: Oba Obirin ti Ile Naijiria).\n|}\nGovernor-General\nThe Governor-General was the representative of the monarch in Nigeria and exercised most of the powers of the monarch.
