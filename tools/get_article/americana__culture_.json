Americana is any collection of materials and things concerning or characteristic of the United States or of the American people, and is representative or even stereotypical of American culture as a whole.\nWhat is and is not considered Americana is heavily influenced by national identity, historical context, patriotism and nostalgia. The ethos or guiding beliefs or ideals which have come to characterize America, such as the American Dream, are central to the idea. Americana encompasses not only material objects but also people, places, concepts and historical eras which are popularly identified with American culture.\nThe name Americana also refers to Americana music, a genre of contemporary music that incorporates elements of various American music styles, including country, roots rock, folk, bluegrass, and blues, resulting in a distinctive roots-oriented sound.\nAs nostalgia\nFrom the mid to late 20th century, Americana was largely conceptualized as a nostalgia for an idealized life in small towns and cities in the United States around the turn of the century, roughly in the period between 1880 and the First World War. It was believed that much of the structure of 20th-century American life and culture had been cemented in that time and place. American author Henry Seidel Canby wrote:\n}}\nMany kinds of cultural artifacts fall within the definition of Americana: the things involved need not be old, but are usually associated with some quintessential element of the American experience. Each period of United States history is reflected by the advertising and marketing of the time, and the various types of antiques, collectibles, memorabilia and vintage items from these time periods are typical of what is popularly considered Americana. The Atlantic described the term as \"slang for the comforting, middle-class ephemera at your average antique store—things like needle-pointed pillows, Civil War daguerreotypes, and engraved silverware sets\".\nThe nostalgia for this period was based on a remembrance of confidence in American life that had emerged during the period due to such factors as a sense that the frontier had finally been \"conquered\", with the U.S. Census Bureau's declaration that it was \"closed\" in 1890, as well as the recent victory in the Spanish–American War. }}\nThe zeitgeist of this idealized period is captured in Disneyland and Magic Kingdom's Main Street, U.S.A. section (which was inspired by both Walt Disney's hometown of Marceline, Missouri and Harper Goff's childhood home of Fort Collins, Colorado), as well as the musical and movie The Music Man and Thornton Wilder's stage play Our Town. Especially revered in nostalgic Americana are small-town institutions like the barber shop, drug store, soda fountain and ice cream parlor; some of these were eventually resurrected by mid-twentieth century nostalgia for the time period in businesses like the Farrell's Ice Cream Parlour chain, with its 1890s theme.\nExamples\n, a former gold mining town in Northern California]]\nCultural symbols\n* American football\n* Baseball\n* Basketball\n* Bruce Wayne and Batman\n* Bugs Bunny\n* Clark Kent and Superman\n* Cowboy\n* Flag of the United States\n* Fourth of July\n* Hollywood\n* Mickey Mouse\n* Mount Rushmore\n*Route 66\n* Small town\n* Statue of Liberty\n* Tent revival\n* Thanksgiving\n*Traveling carnival\n* White picket fence\n*Wild West\nFood\n* Apple pie\n* Barbecue\n* Bubble gum\n* Brownies\n* Buffalo wings\n* Hamburgers\n* Hot dogs\n* Ice Cream\n* Fried chicken\n* Milkshake\n* Muffins\n* Pizza, American-style\nMusic\n* Americana music\n* Blues\n* Country\n* Folk music\n* Jazz\n* Rock and roll\n* \"The Star-Spangled Banner\"\nReligion\n* Camp meeting\n* Tent revival\nClothing and fashion\n* Blue jeans\n* T-shirt\n* Cowboy hat\n* Motorcycle jacket\n* Denim jacket\n* Cowboy boots\n* Penny loafer\n* Workwear\n* College prep\n* Western shirt\nBrand names\n* Alden\n* Allen Edmonds\n* Budweiser\n* Campbell's\n* Chevrolet\n* Coca-Cola\n* DC Comics\n* Disney\n* Ford\n* Harley-Davidson\n* Heinz\n* Jack Daniel's\n* JanSport\n* Jim Beam\n* John Deere\n* Kellogg's\n* KFC\n* Levi's\n* McDonald's\n* Marvel Comics\n* Marlboro\n* Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\n* Nike\n* Stetson\n* Texaco\n* Timberland\n* Warner Bros.\nSimilar concepts\n* Regional\n** Floridiana, artifacts relating to the state of Florida.\n** Hawaiiana, Native Hawaiian cultural artifacts from Hawaii.\n* Anglosphere\n** Australiana, for cultural artifacts from Australia\n** Canadiana, for cultural artifacts from Canada\n** Kiwiana, for cultural artifacts from New Zealand\n* Communist nostalgia, a similar concept in former or currently communist countries\n** Ostalgie, a similar concept in East Germany\n** PRL nostalgia, a similar concept in Poland\n** Soviet nostalgia, a similar concept in the former Soviet Union\n** Yugo-nostalgia, a similar concept in the former Yugoslav states\n* Rhodesiana, a similar concept in Zimbabwe relating to items made when it was known as Rhodesia\nSee also\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Americana Merriam-Webster definition of \"Americana\"]"
