At Mangrol, located northeast of Kota, Maratha general Malhar Rao Holkar decisively defeated the allied Rajput forces.\nBackground\nFollowing the defeat of Marathas at Panipat, Rajput monarchs revolved against them. Malhar Rao Holkar regained lost ground, defeating the Rajputs at Rampura and Ganguri by June 1761, restoring authority over Malwa. He then advanced into Mewar to exact tribute.\nIn the meanwhile, Madho Singh I of Jaipur also approached for alliances against the Marathas and organized Rajput chiefs into a union. The fighting grew stronger, but the monsoon made Holkar wait till autumn when the battle was at its crucial stage.\nBattle\nBattle of Mangrol (28-30 November, 1761) was one of the crucial battles fought between Maratha army of Malhar Rao Holkar and Jaipur Kachhwaha army. Malhar Rao learnt that 12,000 troops of Jaipur had forded Pali Ghat. He marched in their direction toward Kota, to which he received addition of 3,000 local Rajput commanders.\nThe fight continued from dawn till dusk. Jaipur's army initially pushed back the Marathas, leaving 700 of them dead. But after reinforcements from local jagirdars joined the Marathas, they launched a counterattack, causing widespread casualties to Jaipur's army. Several Kachhwaha officers, including their leader, were injured and had to retreat.\nThe Marathas and Kota allies chased the retreating Jaipur troops, causing additional losses along the Sukani River. Malhar Rao pushed on to Mancharpur, 40 miles from Jaipur, putting pressure on Maharaja Madho Singh to open negotiations. The battle further destabilized Jaipur's position and disrupted attempts at resisting Maratha hegemony.\nReference"
