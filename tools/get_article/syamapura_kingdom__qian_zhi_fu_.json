To the north, it adjoined the territory of Duō Mó Cháng (). Historical and archaeological evidence indicates that Qiān Zhī Fú was originally established as a colony by settlers from southern India, maintaining enduring cultural, economic, and political ties with the Indian subcontinent. By the mid-seventh century, during the reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Tang dynasty (r. 649–683), Qiān Zhī Fú functioned as an independent state and engaged in tributary relations with the Chinese imperial court. Contemporary Chinese sources record that the polity maintained a standing military of approximately 20,000 elite soldiers, although it notably lacked cavalry. Accounts of the region’s geography indicate that the territory could be traversed in roughly one month from east to west and twenty-five days from south to north.\nQiān Zhī Fú, together with a contemporary polity in the central Isan region known as the inland Cham of Zhān Bó, was among the most prominent of the five states constituting the trans-Mekong confederation. The other members of this confederation included Pó Àn () at Mueang Phon, Shě Bá Ruò () at Suphanburi, and Mó Là () on the coastal region of Champa. These inland states were distinct from the coastal territories dominated by Dvaravati, which relied primarily upon maritime trade networks for economic and political influence.\nPolitical and economic ties between Qiān Zhī Fú at Si Thep, the Cham polity at Zhān Bó, and other former confederated states in the Chi–Mun river basin — regions that later evolved into Yamanadvipa, also identified with Java — were disrupted following the rise of Angkor in the Tonlé Sap basin during the late ninth century (c. 890s). The subsequent alliance between Angkor and Java enabled the expansion of their influence into the central Thai-Mekong region, culminating in the conquest of Qiān Zhī Fú in 946. This sequence of events reflects broader patterns of state formation, interstate alliances, and shifting political hegemony in early medieval Southeast Asia.\nFollowing the fall of Qiān Zhī Fú at Si Thep to Angkor, its line of monarchs continued until the late tenth century, after which the political center may have shifted to Lavapura in Lavo, only to be captured by Angkor in 1001 or 1005. The city was later retaken by Chandrachota in 1052, and his successor Narai I established a new polity, Xiān (Ayodhya), in the 1080s. This polity endured until the founding of the Ayutthaya Kingdom in 1351. Conflicts with Angkor persisted until the fifteenth century, when the Khmer court relocated to Longvek and later faced pressure from both Siam and Đại Việt, ultimately becoming a French protectorate in 1863.\nQiān Zhī Fú, later known as Gē Luó Shě Fēn, had two allied states—Xiū Luó Fēn to the west of Chenla and Gān Bì in the Savannakhet–Mukdahan region—with similar political structures. The remnant population, the Nyah Kur, who speak a conservative Mon dialect, continue to inhabit the highlands around Si Thep. Their presence indicates the Monic origins of the region’s early inhabitants, who were gradually assimilated into Tai culture following the arrival of northern Chiang Saen and eastern Lao‑Phuthai groups, facilitating trade and interaction with Southern Chinese dynasties and Đại Việt. This linguistic shift was also evident among the Kaleun people, who are believed to have descended from the Austroasiatic Bru people and to have subsequently adopted a Southwestern Tai language.\nPeople\nThe suffix fú  in Qiān Zhī Fú corresponds to the Sanskrit pūra, meaning “town” or “city,” while zhī  denotes “branch” or “subdivision.” Notably, the prefix qiān  phonetically resembles xiān , a term used by Chinese and Đại Việt sources to describe the peoples and polities of the Chao Phraya River basin in the early second millennium. Scholars such as Tatsuo Hoshino have suggested that Qiān Zhī Fú was one of the early Siamese kingdoms—later Taicized—that prospered through trans-Mekong trade connecting Champa in the east with the Menam Basin in the west. Other contemporary Siamese-related polities included Cān Bàn, Xiū Luó Fēn, and Wen Dan.\nThe aforementioned presupposition is supported by the early presence of Siamese peoples, as indicated by the toponym Siam or Syam, attested in several inscriptions, which earlier scholars have interpreted as references to a specific location or population within the Chao Phraya Basin. These inscriptions include K557 (611 CE), K127 (683 CE), K154 (685 CE), K79 (639 CE), and K904 (713 CE). Syam later occurs in slave lists on inscriptions of the Champa and Khmer kingdoms, dated in the 11th and 12th centuries. From approximately the same period, there is also a well-known bas-relief panel of Angkor Wat depicting mercenaries of the Angkorian army, who are identified as syam-kuk, which is believed to be the Siam people.\nIn addition to the early Siamese city-states discussed above, Chinese sources record several Tai principalities further east in the central Mekong Valleys, near the eastern terminus of the trans-Mekong trade routes. These polities are dated to the seventh and eighth centuries and include Gān Bì (), a brother state of Qiān Zhī Fú, located in the region corresponding to present-day Savannakhet–Mukdahan; Jūn Nà Lú (; Cantonese: gwan1 naa5 lou4), transliterated in Thai and Lao as \"'\" and \"'\", meaning “country of Lao rice fields,” located in the  of the Tang at the modern Sakhon Nakhon–Nakhon Phanom–Khammouane; and an additional, unidentified polity, Gǔ Láng Dòng (), situated along the route connecting the first district of  with the second district at Thakhek.\nHistory\nin Si Thep, 7th–8th century CE]]\ninscription in Pallava script on a piece of artifact found in the moated settlement of Si Thep]]\nVaishnavism-influenced period: 4th – 8th century CE\nArchaeological evidence indicates that Qiān at Si Thep developed from a prehistoric farming village approximately 2,500 years ago. During the first archaeological phase (), the early settlement occupied the inner town and exhibited a burial tradition with offerings indicative of cultural interaction with India and neighboring communities in the central region and the Mun River basin to the northeast.\nAccording to descriptions of Qiān Zhī Fú in the New Tang Annals, which correspond to Canasapura (Jiā Luó Shě Fú, ), Tatsuo Hoshino identifies the two polities as the same kingdom during the 7th–8th centuries. He hypothesizes that Qiān Zhī Fú extended eastward into the present-day Chaiyaphum province and further into Nakhon Ratchasima province, encompassing the site at  in the 7th century. Local tradition suggests that Qiān Zhī Fú at Si Thep may have established dynastic relations with the coastal polity of Dvaravati at Kamalanka, which placed its southern neighbor, Tou Yuan, between the allied monarchs Dvaravati to the south and Qiān Zhī Fú to the north. Following the Dvaravati annexation of Tou Yuan, refounded as the Lavo Kingdom in 648, Dvaravati expanded into Qiān Zhī Fú's southeastern territory at  during the subsequent century, prompting Qiān Zhī Fú to cede control of the Nakhon Ratchasima region and retract to its core territory in the northern Menam plain and Pasak Valley. Consequently, based on Tatsuo Hoshino's theory, Si Thep served as the capital of Canasapura, while  functioned as a regional administrative center. Thai historian Athitthan Chanklom () similarly includes Si Thep within the Canasapura polity. Research by Karen M. Mudar also excludes Si Thep from the Dvaravati sphere.\nIn the aftermath of these conflicts, the Lavo—as successor of Tou Yuan under Dvaravati—engaged in further campaigns against Chenla to the southeast. Tatsuo Hoshino suggests that multiple kingdoms participated in these conflicts, including Cān Bàn and Zhū Jiāng, allied with Chenla, and other minor Siamese–Tai polities, including Si Thep's Qiān Zhī Fú or Gē Luó Shě Fēn, Xiū Luó Fēn, and Gān Bì, collectively commanding approximately 50,000 elite soldiers, potentially aligning with the faction offering strategic advantage. Some of these engagements may have coincided with early 10th-century conflicts between Lavo and its northern Monic sister kingdom, Haripuñjaya, which weakened Dvaravati and led to the eastern portion of Dvaravati being subordinated to Tambralinga and Angkor in the 10th and 11th centuries, respectively.\nGolden period: 8th – 10th century CE\nQiān Zhī Fú may correspond to a polity referred to as Tchai pappe Mahanacon in the Du Royaume de Siam. In 756/57, a new dynastic line assumed the throne. During this period, Buddhism supplanted Vaishnavism. Concurrently, Dvaravati's influence over the Menam Valleys declined, allowing monarchs from Qiān Zhī Fú and other Tai principalities in the upper plain to gradually assimilate remaining Dvaravati entities. As noted in the Cefu Yuangui, Gē Luó Shě Fēn, a corrupted form of Si Thep's Jiā Luó Shě Fú, controlled territory west of Dvaravati, granting access to maritime trade routes and contact with Srivijaya. Historical accounts record a Siamese naval expedition led by Passara, son of the king of Syam, which attempted to reach Macassar on Sulawesi but was diverted by a storm near Bali, subsequently establishing the settlement of Passaraan in Java in 800 CE.\n.]]\nThe relocation of the political center to the western lower plain and the enthronement of Qiān Zhī Fú’s new—likely Daic-speaking—dynasty at the western terminus of the trans-Mekong trade route, combined with conflicts between northern Champa and Daic-related Đại Việt at the eastern terminus, resulted in the inland Cham polity of Zhān Bó and other former confederated states in the Chi–Mun basin losing access to maritime routes and dissolving their alliance with Qiān Zhī Fú at Si Thep. These Chi-Mun polities, later associated with Yamanadvipa or Java, established the new trading polities in the area of Angkor to the south to secure maritime access through the Tonlé Sap and lower Mekong. Within a few decades, Angkor emerged as the dominant regional power, eclipsing inland kingdoms.\nThe Pali  or The Chronicle of the Emerald Buddha references a polity named Ayojjhapura, situated north of Lavapura. Its ruler subsequently invaded Inthapatnakhon (), identified as Angkor, and acquired the Emerald Buddha. Another Pali chronicle, Jinakalamali, describes Ayojjhapura as a metropolitan center (mahā-nagara) governed by Rajadhiraj, recognized as the preeminent ruler of Rāmaññadesa. Based on these accounts, Thai scholars locate Ayojjhapura at Si Thep, the only substantial ancient settlement north of Lopburi. These events likely occurred in the early 10th century, during a period of internal instability in Angkor under the reigns of Harshavarman I and Ishanavarman II, and prior to the fall of Si Thep in 946.\nAngkorian invasion: 10th – 11th century CE\nQiān at Si Thep came under the authority of the Shaivism Angkor polity in 946, as evidenced by inscriptions recording the victory of Angkorian king Rajendravarman II (r. 944–968) over Rāmaññadesa to the west. Following this event, Qiān Zhī Fú experienced a decline in prosperity, potentially attributable to climate disruptions, epidemic crises, or alterations in Angkorian trade policies during the 12th–13th centuries. The residual population subsequently migrated to Lavo's Lavapura and to Xiān's Ayodhya.\nDuring the later phase of Qiān Zhī Fú at Si Thep, an early Siamese dynastic line transitioned to Yassouttora Nacoora Louang or Tasoo Nacora Louang, identified with Lavapura of Lavo. Following the loss of the eastern Menam Valley to Angkorian expansion, this dynasty temporarily relocated northward to Sukhothai/Nakhon Thai circa the 1150s. Subsequently, the monarchs shifted their focus southward to the western Menam Valley, where they consolidated control over the region as part of Xiān’s territorial domain, encompassing Suphannabhum, and undertook the reestablishment of Phrip Phri. This region subsequently emerged as a new political and cultural power base for Xiān until the establishment of the Ayutthaya Kingdom in the mid-14th century. The Xiān regained influence over the eastern Menam Valleys at Lavo, previously lost to Angkor, around the 1280s, as indicated by records of significant Xiān settlements in Lavo, as well as Lavo tributes sent to China in 1289 and 1299.\nRulers\nAn inscription discovered at Ban Wang Pai, Phetchabun province (K.978), dated to 550 CE, records the enthronement of a new monarch, identified as a son of Prathivindravarman, father of Bhavavarman I of Chenla. This suggests the existence of dynastic connections between Qiān Zhī Fú and Chenla, although the king's personal name remains unrecorded. Thai scholar Kangwon Katchima argues that the Bhavavarman mentioned in the inscription may not correspond to Bhavavarman I of Chenla, given that the inscription was likely transcribed after 627, several decades subsequent to Bhavavarman I's reign. The reference could therefore pertain to Bhavavarman II—whose origin remains unclear—or to another monarch of the same name.\nThe use of the South Indian regnal title varman among Qiān Zhī Fú rulers indicates substantial influence from south Indian culture, consistent with Chinese sources reporting that the polity was once a South Indian colony before attaining independence at the time of its diplomatic mission to the Tang Dynasty under Emperor Gaozong of Tang circa 656–661.\nFurthermore, if Qiān Zhī Fú at Si Thep constituted the primordial Canasapura, with  functioning only as a regional administrative center—as posited by Tatsuo Hoshino,—then it is plausible that the Canasapura monarchs listed in the Śri Canāśa Inscription K.949, discovered on the island of Ayutthaya, may have reigned at Si Thep. Notably, an Angkorian inscription dated 946 records the victory of king Rajendravarman II over Rāmaññadesa (), coinciding with a period during which the regnal titles of Si Thep Canasapura rulers transitioned from the Buddhism-associated \"datta\" or \"krama\" to the Hindu-oriented \"varman\". Archaeological evidence from Si Thep dating to this era further corroborates Angkorian influence.\nThe Pali Jinakalamali recounts the enthronement of Camadevi at Haripuñjaya in 662 CE and mentions her spouse, Ramaraja, who has been interpreted by multiple Thai scholars as the monarch of Ramburi (; ). The identification of Ramburi remains contested; it has been alternatively proposed that Ramaraja was a prince of Lavo, a prince of Srivijaya, a ruler of Mawlamyine, or a sovereign of Ayutthaya's antecedent polity, Ayojjhapura at Si Thep.\nAdditionally, the 9th-century Sanskrit Phu Khiao Kao inscription K.404, located approximately 100 kilometers northeast of Si Thep in present-day Kaset Sombun district of Chaiyaphum province, mentions a king named Jayasimhavarmman. His precise identity remains uncertain; prior scholarship has variably suggested that he may have ruled Wen Dan, Bhavapura, or Champa. Definitive identification, however, is currently lacking.\nThe following is the list of kings of Qiān Zhī Fú's Si Thep; some of them have currently been the subject of debate.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=2|Name !! rowspan=2|Reign !!rowspan=2|Note||rowspan=2|Source\n|-\n!
