This culture flourished during the Early Cycladic II period (ca 2700-2300 BC) of the Cycladic civilization. The trade relations of this culture spread far and wide from the Greek mainland to Crete and Asia Minor.\nPeriodization\nColin Renfrew has proposed an Early Cycladic subdivision into Grotta-Pelos, Keros-Syros, Kastri, and Phylakopi I periods.\nAfter the Keros-Syros culture, Kastri culture is believed to follow, although this view is not accepted by all. Some researchers in Europe believe that Keros-Syros and Kastri cultures belong to the same phase. Also, sometimes Kastri culture is designated as Kastri/Lefkandi I, because of the similarities with the Greek mainland 'Lefkandi I' phase.\nImportant sites\n\" with ship and fish.

National Archaeological Museum Athens]]\nKeros-Syros culture is well represented by numerous cemeteries on Amorgos (notably Dokathismata) and Naxos (Aplomata, Spedos).\nSome of the best preserved sites of this culture are at Kea and Ios, located not far from Keros.\nOne of the important sites of this culture is Chalandriani at Syros.\nSome of the important artifacts of this culture are the so-called \"Frying pans\" – shallow circular vessels or bowls with a decorated base. They are found especially during the Cycladic Grotta-Pelos and Keros-Syros cultures. It has been suggested that when filled with water they were used as mirrors.\nUse of metal\nThe use of metal became widespread during this period. In all the settlements there were found grave goods in the form of daggers, and also tools such as chisels, tweezers and fishhooks. Also fibulae (brooches) were made of bronze and silver.\nKeros-Syros culture is clearly seen as the successor of Grotta-Pelos.\nThe trade relations of Keros-Syros culture are widespread. They range from the Greek mainland to Crete, where the Cycladic figurines were exported, and imitated by the local artists. Also, the trade went as far as the Asia Minor. Finds at Troy, in the periods of Troy I and Troy II, were also made.\nSee also\n*History of the Cyclades\n*Cycladic art\nNotes\nBibliography\n*C.
