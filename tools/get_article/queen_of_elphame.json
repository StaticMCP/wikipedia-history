In ballads and contemporary texts, she is referred to as Queen of Elphane, Elphen, or the Fairies. She is equivalent to the Queen of Fairy who rules Faërie or Fairyland. The character as described in witch trials has many parallels with the legends of Thomas the Rhymer and Tam Lin.\nHistory of usage\nThe actual text spelling is \"Quene of Elfame\" and other variants in the witch trial transcripts. The supposition of a  -hame stem, leading to the etymological meaning \"Elf-home\" in the Scots language, is speculative on the part of Robert Pitcairn, the modern editor. The Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue lists only the Elfame and elphyne spellings, both defined as \"Fairyland\". Other spellings include:  \"Quene of Elphane\" and \"Court of Elfane\" (accused witch Alison Pearson), \"Court of Elfame\" (Bessie Dunlop), \"Queen of Elphen\" (Andro Man).\nThe \"Queen of Elphame\" designation was only used in isolated instances in the 19th century. cross-referencing to I, 52, 56 (Bessie Dunlop case) and I, 162 (Alison Pearson); and later in regards to Andro Man by Chambers's Journal}} Serious scholarship on Thomas the Rhymer, for instance, generally do not employ this spelling. But it was embraced by Robert Graves who used \"Queen of Elphame\" in his works. Usage has since spread in various popular publications.\nThe theory that the queen whom Thomas Rhymer met at Erceldoune was the Saxon goddess Ercel, i.e. Hörsel or Ursel (cf. St. Ursula) according to a German origin explanation noted in passing by Fiske}} though it has received scarce notice aside from Barbara G. Walker, who cites Graves's  The White Goddess for this insight.\nWitch trials\nThe Queen of Elphame was invoked, under various names, in Scottish witch trials. The forms \"Queen of Elfame\" (sic.) (\"Elphane\",  also \"Court of Elfane\")  occur in documents from the trial of Alison Pearson (Alesoun Peirsoun) in 1588, and emendation to \"elf-hame\" was suggested by the editor, Robert Pitcairn.  Alison was carried off to Elfame on a number of occasions over the years, where she made good acquaintance with the Queen. But rather than the Queen herself, it was mostly with her elfin minions that Alice engaged in specific interactions, with William Simpson, Alison's cousin or uncle being a particularly close-knitted mentor, teaching her medicinal herbs and the art of healing, which she then profited from by peddling her remedies to her patients, which included the Bishop of St. Andrews. The elfin folk from this world would arrive unexpectedly, allowing her to join in their herb-picking before sunrise, and brewing their salves (sawis) before her eyes. But they were often abusive, striking her in a manner that left her bereft of all her powers (\"poistee\" or \"poustie\") on her sides, rendering her bedridden for twenty weeks at a time.\nThe form \"Queen of Elphen\" occurs in the 1598 witchcraft trial indictment (ditty) and confession of Andro Man (Andrew Man) of Aberdeen. Andro Man confessed that as a boy he saw \"the Devil\" his master \"in the likeness and shape of a woman, whom [he] callest the Queen of Elphen,\" and as an adult, during the span of some thirty-two years he had carnal relations with the \"Quene of Elphen\" on whom he begat many bairns. Further down however, the Devil whom he calls \"Christsonday\" is the  (husband), though \"the Quene has grip of all the craft\".\nAndro Man further confessed that on the Holy Rood Day (Ruidday in harvest) the Queen of Elphen and her company rode white horses (quhyt haiknayes) alongside the Devil (Christsondy) who appeared out of snow in the form of a .  She and her companions had human shapes, \"yet were as shadows\", and that they were \"playing and dancing whenever they pleased.\"\nBessie Dunlop in 1576 confessed that the dead man's spirit she had congress with (Thom Reid) was one of \"the good neighbours or brownies, who dwelt at the Court of Faery (Elf-hame)\" (\"gude wychtis that wynnitin the Court of Elfame..\"), and they had come to take her away, but she refused to comply thereby angering Thom. When interrogated, Bessie denied having carnal relations with Thom, though he once took her by the apron and \"wald haif had hir gangand with him to Elfame.\" Bessie was informed that the queen had secretly visited her before, and according to Thom, when Bessie lay in bed in child-birth, it was the \"Quene of Elfame\" who in the guise of a stout woman had offered her a drink and prophesied her child's death and her husband's cure. And indeed, it was at the behest of this Queen who was his master that Thom had come to Bessie at all.\nThe Queen's shape-shifting magic extends to her own person. Andro Man's confession also noted that \"she can be old or young as she pleases\".\nMarion Grant, of the same coven as Andro Man, witnessed the queen as a \"fine woman, clad in a white walicot.\"}} Similarly, Isobel Gowdie's confession described the \"Qwein of Fearrie\" as handsomely (\"brawlie\") clothed in white linen and in white and brown clothes, and that providing more food than Isobel could eat.\nRobert Sempill in a ballad (1583) on the bishop Patrick Adamson refers to Alison Pearson participating in the fairy ride. The Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue also, in giving the entry  \"Fairy-land,\" and gives Sempill's ballad as an example in usage. (Poem 45, v. 372).}}\nFor oght the kirk culd him fobid,\nHe sped him sone, and gat the thrid;\nAne carling of the Quene of Phareis,\nThat ewill win geir to elphyne careis;\nThrough all Braid Abane scho hes bene,\nOn horsbak on Hallow ewin;\nAnd ay in seiking cetayne nyghtis,\nAs scho sayis with sur [our] sillie wychtis.\n&mdash; R.S., 'Legend of the Bischop of St. Androis Lyfe, callit Mr Patrick Adamsone alias Cousteane\", Poems 16th Cent.\nin: Scottish Poems of the XVIth Century, pp. 320–321\nRobert Jamieson also noted the ballad under the etymological explanation of seelie meaning \"happy.\" The ballad thus mention the Queen of Fairies, elphyne meaning Elfland (Fairyland), and seelie witches in a single passage.\nIn 1801, John Leyden identified the Scottish queen of the fairies with Nicneven, the \"gyre-carlin,\" or Hecate. This was accepted by authors such as Sir Walter Scott, but has baffled later scholars; Nicneven is, properly, a witch in the 16th-century poetry of Alexander Montgomerie. She is a worshipper of Hecate and a separate person from the \"Elfe Queene,\" who also appears in the poem.\nBallads\nFrom Thomas the Rhymer (retold by Mary MacGregor, 1908), \"Under the Eildon tree Thomas met the lady\", illustration by Katherine Cameron.\nA similar queen appears in the legend of Thomas the Rhymer, where she spirits Thomas away. In the older prose romance she is the queen of some unnamed supernatural realm; in a later ballad (version A), she identifies herself as \"Queen of Elfland.\" In both the ballad and romance versions, she is initially mistaken for the Queen of Heaven (i.e. the Virgin Mary).  Even in versions where her realm is not directly named, scholars such as J. A. H. Murray identify it as Elfland or Fairyland. In a 1957 edition, Robert Graves rendered the name as Queen of Elphame.\nThere are parallels from this ballad to the witchcraft trial of Andro Man. Man's accusers charged that he had learned the art of healing from the \"Quene of Elphen\" and worked in exchange for \"meit or deit\", just like Thomas the Rhymer. They also made him confess that he had known dead men like Thomas the Rhymer.\nFurthermore, the \"fee\" or \"teind\" to hell in the romance version of the Legend of Thomas the Rhymer is also mentioned in the ballad of Tam Lin and in the historical witchcraft trial of Alison Pearson in 1586.}} referred to as \"E\" version by later scholars such as Emily B.
