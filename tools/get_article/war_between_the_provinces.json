      "text": "# War Between the Provinces\n\n}}\nThe War Between the Provinces is a series of fantasy novels by Harry Turtledove.\nThe novels are a retelling of the American Civil War in a high fantasy setting called the Kingdom of Detina. The series focuses on the Eastern theater of the War Between the Provinces.\nThe names of locations have been changed, and North and South (and west and east) have been reversed, and, rather than skin color, hair color is used as the basis for the dehumanization. Many of the characters are based on real-world characters, and their names indicate this. Often their names are anagrams of the real-world character they are based on, or their nicknames contain their original's name.\nHand-cranked crossbows replace guns to mirror slow reloading times, and the northern rebels have fewer flying carpet paths (railroads) than the southern kingdom, hence giving the slave-owning side the same logistical problems that existed in the American Civil War.\nSome characters with historical counterparts\nSouthern Detinan characters\n* King Avram – counterpart of US President Abraham Lincoln\n* General (later Marshal) Bart – counterpart of General Ulysses S.

The notion was condemned as heretical by most mages, and many threats were made against \"Inward\", which is why he went to great lengths to keep his identity a secret. He is based on British naturalist Charles Darwin.\n* Kermit – He was an emperor on the continent across the Western Ocean from Detina. 50 years before the Detinan Civil War, Kermit waged a war against the other western kingdoms to expand his empire. His efforts were met with tremendous initial success, and he established a reputation as one of the world's all-time great military geniuses. However, he attempted to invade the massive southern kingdom of Sorb during the brutal winter months. Although Kermit's forces were able to make it to the Sorbian capital of Pahzbull, his army was forced to retreat from the city and it would never recover from the massive number of casualties that it sustained from the retreat.
