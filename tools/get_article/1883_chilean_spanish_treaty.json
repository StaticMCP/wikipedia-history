The treaty put an end to the state of war that existed between both states since the Chincha Islands War.\nBackground\nIn 1867, Spain and Chile had reached a preliminary agreement to receive the warships embargoed by the British neutrality laws, which caused the diplomatic incident between Peru and Chile in 1868.\nIn 1871, an armistice was signed in Washington, D.C. between Spain and allies Peru and Chile. Later, at the beginning of the War of the Pacific, Spain signed the two treaties in Paris with Peru (August 14, 1879) and Bolivia (August 21, 1879), which ended the state of war.\nIn 1881, the Chilean government allowed the arrival of Spanish merchant ships to its ports in recognition of the protection provided by Spanish merchants to the Chilean victims of the Battle of Iquique.\nTreaty\nThe representatives for the treaty were Jovino Novoa for Chile and Enrique Vallés for Spain, who signed the treaty in the Peruvian city of Lima, during its occupation by Chile.\nThe treaty itself contains 5 articles that dictate peace, repeal the armistice of 1871, order to communicate it to the president of the United States and order to exchange the ratifications within a year.\nChilean president Domingo Santa María put it into effect in Chile on May 21, 1884.\nSee also\n*\n*Treaty of Defensive Alliance (Bolivia–Peru)\nReferences"
