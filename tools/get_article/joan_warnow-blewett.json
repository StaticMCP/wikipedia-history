This team collected data on 60 scientific collaborations over the span of a decade. They coded the interviews with the collaborative teams in order to create a massive database covering themes such as \"invention and practice; and issues of specialization, decision-making, values, subcontracting, instrumentation, funding and, of course, credit allocation.\"\nPersonal life\nWarnow-Blewett was married three times. Her first marriage, which was until 1964, was to inventor Morton Warnow, with whom she had three children. In 1983, she married physicist John Paul Blewett and was married to Blewett until his death in 2000. Her third marriage was to physics historian, Martin Klein. She had three children: Paul Warnow, Kimmen Sjolander, and Tandy Warnow.\nWarnow-Blewett died in Alamo, California, on May 30, 2006.\nSelected publications\nBetween 1970 and 2001, Warnow-Blewett published 60 works in 105 publications.
