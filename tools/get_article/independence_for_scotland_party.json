MacAskill issued a statement saying that the advert was made without his consent.\nOn 8 January 2021, former SNP councillor Roddy McCuish became the first elected representative of the ISP, when he joined the party while on Argyll and Bute Council, having been sitting as an independent since his re-election in 2017. McCuish would later announce that he would stand down at the 2022 election.\nThe ISP had planned to stand fourteen list candidates in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, one in South Scotland and Glasgow and two in the remaining six regions. However, after  the Alba Party announced their formation and decision to compete in the election, they withdrew their candidates.\nThe ISP contested the 2022 Scottish local elections, running eleven candidates in total.\nThey did not win any seats.\nThe party leader, Collette Walker, was a candidate in the 2023 Rutherglen and Hamilton West by-election. It was her party's first United Kingdom parliamentary election. She finished in ninth place with 0.68% of the vote, and lost her deposit.\nAt the 2024 general election, ISP stood two candidates: John Hannah (Bathgate and Linlithgow) and Walker (East Renfrewshire).\nThe party campaigned on a platform of Abstentionism in the election.\nBoth Hannah and Walker were unsuccessful in their bid to win a seat, receiving 0.9% and 0.6% of votes respectively .\nFor the 2026 Scottish Parliament election, ISP is standing candidates as part of Liberate Scotland. Liberate Scotland is a pro-independence electoral alliance, formed by some of the smaller parties and independents to avoid splitting the nationalist vote.\nElections contested\nUnited Kingdom House of Commons\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Leader\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Election\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Candidates\n! colspan=\"2\" |General\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Rank\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Notes\n|-\n!
