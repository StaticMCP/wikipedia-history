President Ulysses S. Grant had considered seeking a third term, but with various scandals, a poor economy and heavy Democratic gains in the House of Representatives that led many Republicans to repudiate him, he declined to run. The convention resulted in the nomination of Governor Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio for president and Representative William A. Wheeler of New York for vice president.\nThe Republican ticket of Hayes and Wheeler went on to lose the popular vote to Democrats Samuel J. Tilden and Thomas A. Hendricks in the election of 1876, but won the electoral vote after a controversy which was resolved by the Compromise of 1877.\nOverview\nThe convention was called to order by Republican National Committee chairman Edwin D. Morgan. Theodore M. Pomeroy served as the convention's temporary chairman and Edward McPherson served as permanent president.\nThe principal candidates at the convention included Senator James G. Blaine of Maine, the former Speaker of the House; Senator Oliver P. Morton of Indiana; Secretary of the Treasury Benjamin H. Bristow of Kentucky; Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York; Governor Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio; and Governor John F. Hartranft of Pennsylvania. James Russell Lowell, well-known poet and a professor at Harvard College, spoke on behalf of Hayes.\nTwo candidates, Benjamin Bristow and Marshall Jewell of Connecticut, were serving as Cabinet members in the Grant administration.\nPresidential nomination\nPresidential candidates\nImage:President Rutherford Hayes 1870 - 1880 Restored (cropped).jpg|Governor Rutherford B.

Hayes as the party's nominee for president]]\nBlaine led after the first ballot, but had only 285 of the 378 delegates required to secure the nomination.  Morton, Bristow, and Conkling each had around 100 delegates, while Hayes and Hartranft each had around 60.  The second, third, and fourth ballots saw similar results, but Hayes began to surge on the fifth ballot, passing Morton and Conkling to secure third place after Blaine and Bristow.  The sixth ballot saw Blaine rise to 308, but, with the other candidates fading, Hayes continued his surge, moving into second place.  After the sixth ballot, the Bristow, Conkling, Morton, and Hartranft supporters withdrew their candidates' names from consideration, leaving Hayes as the sole focus of opposition to Blaine.  With the other candidates gone, Hayes won a narrow majority on the seventh ballot and secured the nomination.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Presidential Ballot\n|-\n!
