      "text": "# Data Renaissance\n\n}}\nData Renaissance is the fifth studio album by French musical project the Algorithm. It was released on 3 June 2022 through FiXT.\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = Metal Storm\n| rev2score = 8/10\n}}\nDom Lawson from Blabbermouth.net gave the album 7.5 out of 10 and said: \"There are certainly moments of electronic purity here, but The Algorithm's intuitive subversive streak is always lurking in the background. Even the jittery, insistent beats of \"Multithreading\" are gradually undermined by thick, viscous bass ooze and flashes of ghostly humanity. An album full of intelligence and verve, Data Renaissance is eccentric, enthralling and more than heavy enough to hit the spot.\" Into the Void gave the album positive review, saying: \"Data Renaissance creates some creatively searing aggressive moments that cascade into gorgeous stabs of synth and digital bliss. Rémi Gallego is about as talented as they come when it comes to multi-genre forces in the electronic,synthwave, and metal genres. If the artist brings more atmospherically heavy and inventive works like this to the table, the electro-metal scene is in for a real treat.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n* Rémi Gallego – synthesizer, sequencer, guitar, programming, production, mixing\n* Brian Skeel – mastering\n* Adrien Bousson – artwork\n* Katerina \"Ninja Jo\" Belikova – layout\nReferences"
