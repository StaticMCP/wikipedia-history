Gustáv Husák was elected the new president.\nBackground\nThe health of the incumbent president Ludvík Svoboda was getting worse and members of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia concluded that he won't finish his second term. Vasil Bilak and Gustáv Husák were suggested for the position. Bilak had stronger support but Husák's influence increased thanks to Bilak's authoritarian behaviour.\nReferences"
