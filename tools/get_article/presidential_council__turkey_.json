It comprised the military commanders who joined General Kenan Evren in the 1980 coup d'état. It succeeded the National Security Council (1980–1983), of which Evren had been President, which was formally abolished after the 1983 general election, and reconstituted as the Presidential Council. Evren remained President of Turkey until 1989.\nMembership (in 1985)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! Representing\n! Name\n!
