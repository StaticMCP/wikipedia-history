Since the previous year, Tarifa had been subjected to a naval blockade to prevent the supply of supplies. The naval contingent, led by the Genoese admiral Benedetto I Zaccaria, was composed of a fleet of Genoese, Castilian and Aragonese ships (the latter sub-commanded by Berenguer de Montoliú). Sancho IV of Castile also provided logistical assistance from the Emirate of Granada. The land siege started in July 1292, after the arrival of Sancho IV.\nThe forces of Sancho IV entered the city on October 14, 1292.\nAccording to , the conquest of the city was the most decisive Christian advance in two centuries of conflict in the area of the Strait of Gibraltar.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*"
