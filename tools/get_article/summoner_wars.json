It's cheaper. It's prettier. Less hassle. Perfect multiplayer that allows you to play as often as you like. If you're a fan of strategy games, this is a must-buy. And even if you're not, the game is free to try, and you have nothing to lose.\" Pocket Gamer described the game as \"A complex, but accessible, card-based strategy game that combines elements of Magic: The Gathering with Risk and Stratego.\" Eurogamer wrote \"It's hard not to feel Summoner Wars is a great game, verging on superb, that's held back by a highly polished but functionally thin app. TouchArcade said the game was \"A must-have for gamers who want more tactical maneuvering in their CCGs or more customization in their strategy games. However, its flaws and the price point for full buy-in mean that it's not for everyone, but being free to try and having a flexible IAP system means that it's worth checking out either way.\"\nSee also\n* Summoner Wars (Second Edition)\nReferences"
