Designated as genetically different from the southeastern dwarf salamander (E. quadridigitata) in a 2017 study, in which it was found to have important genetic and physical differences. The species itself has been found in very few numbers, so much more research will likely be needed to understand it better.  It is found in a very small section of the Gulf Coast, resulting in the possibility that it is the most geographically restricted subspecies of dwarf salamander. Its known breeding habitat is within acidic bogs, specifically on mats of Sphagnum moss.\nTaxonomy\nIt was previously thought to be a population of the southeastern dwarf salamander (E. quadridigitata) but a 2017 study found it to be a distinct species based on genetic evidence, and described it as E. sphagnicola. It is unlikely that any previous studies had analyzed populations of this species.\nIt is the most divergent of the eastern species in the dwarf salamander complex, having diverged from the clade containing E. quadridigitata, E. hillisi, and E. chamberlaini during the late Oligocene to mid-Miocene, about 23-15 million years ago.\nPhylogeny\nThe Eurycea sphagnicola was originally believed to be a variant of Eurycea quadridigitata before the 2017 study done by Wray, Means, and Stepphan which found several distinguishable morphological and genetic differences. The Eurycea genus also known as “brook salamanders” are part of the Plethodontinae family which are lungless salamanders. The Eurycea sphagnicola along with 4 other Plethodontinae are distinguished into a complex based on them having 4 digits. The species in this complex are the E. chamberlaini, E. quadridigitata, E. paludicola, E. hillisi, E. sphagnicola. The E. sphagnicola differed from these other species in the complex based on differing measurements and colorings. The character found to be most unique of the E. sphagnicola is with its larvae which has a dorsal tail fin. With very few specimens being found, (36), a considerable amount of research is still needed to further understand the differences of the Eurycea sphagnicola from the other salamanders both in the complex and the overall genus.\nDistribution\nIt is found only in a small portion of the Gulf Coast of the United States, being found in the western Florida Panhandle and southern Alabama and Mississippi. It is likely the most geographically restricted of all species in the dwarf salamander complex.\nHabitat\nIt is notable for its breeding habitats being restricted to mats of Sphagnum moss on acidic hillside seepage bogs. It breeds in sluggish but flowing water.\nReferences"
