It was opened on 29 September 2024 as the final extension of Pune Metro Phase I. It is further being developed as a multimodal transport hub, which will provide seamless integration of metro services with the PMPML and MSRTC Swargate bus stations. Additionally, retail and commercial establishments will be built over the station on a public–private partnership model.\nWhen the operations were started here, commuters faced issues while buying online tickets at the underground station due to weak network signals. Bharti Airtel became the first operator to upgrade the sites along the 17.4km long PCMC–Swargate route with additional deployment of in-building solutions along the 6km long underground stretch.\nThe extension of the Purple Line from Swargate to Katraj was approved by the Government of India on 16 August 2024. Named as Line–1B, this section will include three underground stations on a 5.46km long route. The official ground breaking ceremony took place on 29 September 2024 and is expected to be completed by February 2029.\nStation layout\n| legend = track\n| collapsible = no\n| map = HSTg\\HSTf\nPSTR(L)\\PSTR(R) ~~ ~~ ~~ to\n*P2\\PSTR(L)\\PSTR(R)\\*P1\nPSTR(L)\\PSTR(R) ~~ ~~ ~~ to Train Terminates Here\nHSTg\\HSTf\n| bottom = Station with two tracks and one Island platform\n}}}}\n{|table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 valign=top|G\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=100 valign=top|Street level\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=510 valign=top|Exit/ Entrance\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|M\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Mezzanine\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Fare control, station agent, Ticket/token, shops\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 rowspan=3 valign=top|P\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px white;\" width=100|Platform 1Southbound\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px white;\" width=510|Towards → Train Terminates Here\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Island platform | Doors will open on the right\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=100|Platform 2Westbound\n| style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=\"510\" |Towards ← PCMC BhavanNext Station: Mandai\n|}\nEntry/Exit\nSee also\n* Pune\n* Maharashtra\n* Rapid Transit in India\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgWePzVnevg Details of Swargate Multi-Modal Transport Hub] on YouTube (in Marathi)"
