Hearing that Shah Ismail was approaching the fortress of Merv , Muhammad Sheybani Khan sent a 3,000  Uzbek army under the leadership of Janvafa Mirza against Shah Ismail . Shah Ismail sent Dana Muhammad. The battle took place near the village of Tahirabad. Dana Muhammad was accompanied by his son Akhi Sultan. During the most tense moments of the battle, Sarioghlan, one of the Uzbek Bahadirs, confronted the very old Dana Muhammad. Although Sarioghlan thought that he could easily kill Dana Muhammad, he did not, and Dana Muhammad knocked him off his horse with a spear blow and killed him.  Although the Qizilbash army was in a victorious position, Dana Muhammad was killed by a single arrow shot by Tajli Bahadir, one of the Uzbek Bahadirs. Mirza Muhammad Talysh and Huseyn Bey Halvaçıoğlu joined the battle, which was a great motivation for the Qizilbash army. When the Sultan saw his father's death, he was very sad and, in order to avenge his father, he pursued Tajlı Bahadir, who had fled the battlefield. He caught up with him and killed him with a single blow of his sword.\nSee also\nSafavid EmpireKhanete of BukharaSafavid-Shaybanid Wars\nReferences"
