      "text": "# Phillip A. Stewart\n\nPhillip A. Stewart is a former United States Air Force major general who served as the commander of the Nineteenth Air Force from 2022 to 2023. He previously served as the Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategic Employment of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe from 2020 to 2022.\nOn May 9, 2023, Stewart was relieved from command by Air Education and Training Command Commander Brian S. Robinson \"due to a loss of confidence in his ability to lead, related to alleged misconduct which is currently under investigation.\". In December 2023, he was charged for sexually assaulting a subordinate officer. In June 2024, the sexual assault charges were dropped, but he is still charged with “conduct unbecoming an officer for allegedly inviting a subordinate to spend the night with him” and for “allegedly controlling an aircraft within 12 hours after consuming alcohol”. Steward is the first general in the history of the US armed forces to be tried on these charges by a (military) jury rather than a single judge.\nIn 2025 he was convicted of adultery and dereliction of duty and demoted to the rank of Brigadier general.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n}}"
