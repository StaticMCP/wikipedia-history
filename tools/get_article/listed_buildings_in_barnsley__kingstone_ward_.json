At the front are two storeys and an attic, and a symmetrical front of five bays, the central three bays projecting, the middle bay furthest.  In the second and fourth bays are round-arched portals with pilaster jambs, engaged colonnettes, and pointed hood moulds.  Above are single-light windows, the other windows on the front have two lights, and all have pointed hood moulds.  The middle bay is gabled with a small attic window.  Along the top of the building is a Lombard frieze and a parapet that mainly contains round arches, and has corbelled round corner piers.  Behind the central gable is a small pyramidal roof.

The door is round-headed, and all the windows are sashes.\n|align=\"center\" |\n|-\n|Locke Park Tower\n|\n|align=\"center\"|1877\n|The tower, on the highest point in the park, was designed by Richard Phené Spiers, and has four stages.

Above this is a balcony with terracotta panels between stone piers, behind which the tower has banded rustication and an entablature.  The third stage is a drum with four Corinthian pilasters, and an entablature with a decorated frieze.  The top stage is a wooden arcaded lantern with a conical copper-clad roof and a finial.\n|align=\"center\" |\n|-\n|St Edward's Church\n|\n|align=\"center\"|1900–02\n|The church is in stone with a slate roof, and is in Early English style.  It consists of a nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, north and south porches, north and south transepts, a chancel, and a tower at the crossing.  The tower has corner buttresses rising to form towers with pyramidal roofs, a clock face on the north side, and an open arcaded parapet, and it is surmounted by a pyramidal roof with a lead cap and a cross finial.
