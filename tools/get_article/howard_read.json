      "text": "# Howard Read\n\nHoward Oliver Drinkwater Read is a British screenwriter, comedian, and animator best known for his work with his animated sidekick, Little Howard. His other creations include an angry manager with a conversational style and the worldview of Bernard Manning, Roger T. Pigeon, and H:BOT 2000, a robot from the future. Each of these characters interacts with both Big Howard and each other.\nHoward Read is also known for his on-stage human Guess Who? act: the audience guesses who he has drawn on a large pad of paper, sitting down as their questions exclude those of a certain appearance until only one person is left standing.\nIn 1993, Howard Read invented NikNakNoodles - an amalgamation of Golden Wonder's Pot Noodle and Golden Wonder's other oddly-flavored product,\nNik Naks. Unfortunately, the product was never mass-produced.\nRead is a regular contributor to Robin Ince's Book Club.\nRead also went on to work as a writer for the Disney XD series Counterfeit Cat and the new Danger Mouse series on CBBC.\nLittle Howard\nLittle Howard is a sketched cartoon child aged 6 who is a \"standing-up comedian\". He appears on a laptop or projection screen except on his own TV show, interacting either with Big Howard, the audience, or with other animated characters (including the pigeon Roger, his manager, and H:BOT 2000 (named as MOTHER on Little Howard's Big Question), a computer). He is adept at interrupting Big Howard, dealing with hecklers and doing tarot readings with a pack of Top Trumps. His favorite food is fish and chips and he is currently learning the ukulele.\nEdinburgh Festival Fringe\nThe Big Howard and Little Howard Show was nominated for a Perrier Award at the 2003 Edinburgh Festival Fringe.\nIn 2005, Read staged his own Comeback Special where he performed his first solo Festival show.\nWriting Credits\n* 2021 \"Rabbids Invasion: Mission to Mars\" (Ubisoft/France Télévisions/Netflix)\n* 2021 Horrible Histories Podcast\n* 2021 Horrible Histories 9 (covid-safe mini series) (Lion TV/CBBC) Sketch and song-writer.\n* 2021–22 ''It's Pony Series 2 (Blue Zoo/Nickelodeon)\n* 2018-2021 Deer Squad Series 1 & 2 (NICK jnr/IQIYI)\n* 2019 I Don't Wanna Grow Up (HARE AND TORTOISE/FREEMANTLE) Created, co-writer and performer\n* 2019-2020 Family Jewels (Wildseed Studios) Pilot script for adult animation series\n* 2018-2019 The Blackpool Museum Project, Development writer and animated character bible author.\n* 2019 Ninja Express (CBBC/Boomerang)\n* 2019 Incredible Ant (Wildseed Studios/iQiyi)\n* 2019 Not the End of the World'' (Wildseed studios/Sky)\n* 2019 \"Horrible Histories 8\" (Lion TV/CBBC) BAFTA NOMINATED as part of Best Writer team and WINNER BEST CHILDREN'S COMEDY BAFTA\n* 2018 \"Super Natural\" (King Bert) Development, sketch and song writer.\n* 2018 \"Totems\" (A Productions/Sesame Studios/Apple TV)\n* 2018 \"The World's Worst Children\" (King Bert) development writer\n* 2016-19 \"Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed\" (Beano Studios/CBBC)\n* 2016 Horrible Histories 7 (Lion TV/CBBC), BAFTA NOMINATED as part of Best Writer team\n* 2016 \"The Floogals\" (Sprout/Channel 5)\n* 2012 - 2015 \"Horrible Histories 5 - 6\" (Lion TV/CBBC)\n* 2016 \"Danger Mouse\" (Freemantle/CBBC)\n* 2016 \"The Furchester Hotel\" (Sesame Studios/CBBC)\n* 2015 \"Class Dismissed\" (CBBC)\n* 2015 \"The Tracy Ulman Show\" (Citrus/BBC)\n* 2015 \"Counterfeit Cat\" (Wildseed Studios/Disney XD)\n* 2015 \"The Amazing World of Gumball\" (Cartoon Network)\n* 2013-14 \"Gigglebiz\" (Cbeebies) BAFTA winning live action pre-school sketch show\n* 2009-11 \"Little Howard's Big Question\" (CBBC) British Writer’s Guild Award-winning animated/live-action edu-sit-com.
