Early in his college years, he was also among the students involved in the founding of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity at Yale.\nEarly life and education\nBartlett was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on January 31, 1824, the son of James and Lucy Bartlett. His family descended from a longstanding line of Bartletts from Maine, where they had been farmers for several generations.\nHe prepared for college while working in the law office of Albert Hatch, Esq. After completing his undergraduate studies, he briefly attended the Union Theological Seminary in New York, but poor health led him to change direction. In 1849 he entered the New York University Medical School. He received his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1850 and began practicing shortly afterward.\nMedical career\nAfter earning his degree, Bartlett opened a medical practice in New York City. In January 1856 he relocated to Madison, Wisconsin, where he remained for about two and a half years. In later writings, he described this period as an opportunity to encounter the types of illnesses common in the Midwest. He also commented, somewhat wryly, on being caught up in a period of land speculation that ended abruptly with the financial downturn of 1857.\nBartlett returned to New York soon after and established a homeopathic medical practice. His work in homeopathy aligned with a broader nineteenth-century trend in which alternative medical approaches gained traction. He contributed occasionally to medical journals, although these writings were not numerous.\nPersonal life\nBartlett married Jane Ball, the daughter of Dr. A. S. Ball of New York City, on September 24, 1850. They had eight children. Records list several who survived into adulthood, including Jennie (born 1855), Willie (born 1859), Helen (born 1863), Lucy (born 1865), and Mary (born 1859).\nHe belonged to the Broadway Tabernacle Church in New York City, under the pastorate of Rev. Joseph P. Thompson, D.D. Bartlett lived for much of his life at 43 West 11th Street near Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.\nOutside his medical work, Bartlett had interests in painting and music, though there is no indication that he pursued either professionally.\nLegacy\nBartlett practiced medicine during a period of transition in American medical history, when homeopathy and other emerging approaches competed with established allopathic practices. His work reflects this environment, combining formal medical training with alternative treatment methods typical of the time.\nDuring his undergraduate years he took part in the founding of Delta Kappa Epsilon alongside fourteen other students, a detail preserved in fraternity history.\nBartlett’s career, divided between New York City and the Midwest, placed him within the broader landscape of nineteenth-century American medical experimentation and professional development. His contributions to early homeopathic publications and his long tenure in New York situate him among the many mid-century physicians whose work reflected the changing medical culture of the era.\nReferences"
