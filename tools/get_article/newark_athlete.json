It was filmed in May or June 1891, in the Photographic Building at the Edison Laboratory, West Orange, New Jersey. The firm's Black Maria studio building was not constructed until late 1892 or early 1893.  The film was made to be viewed using Thomas Edison's Kinetoscope.\nIn 2010, Newark Athlete  was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". It is currently the oldest film chosen to be in the Registry.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
