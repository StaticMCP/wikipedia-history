Every year, cultural festivals are held in the town of Darjeeling and its surrounding areas.\nCuisine\nThe people of Darjeeling consume a diverse variety of foods. Each ethnic group has its own distinct traditional food. A popular food in Darjeeling is the momo, a steamed dumpling containing chicken, mutton, pork, beef or vegetables cooked in a doughy wrapping served with a watery vegetable soup and spicy tomato sauce/chutney. Indigenous fermented food products such as gundruk (fermented and dried leafy vegetable), kinema (fermented soybean), and sinki (fermented and dried radish) are consumed by the people. Wai-Wai is a favorite packaged snack of Darjeeling hills comprising noodles that are eaten either dry or with soup. Hard chhurpi, a type of hard cheese made from cow or yak's milk, is another popular mini-snack that is both nutritious and masticatory. Soft chhurpi, a traditional soft cheese, is consumed along with green vegetables as savoury dishes, used as filling for momos, ground with tomatoes and chillies for chutney or made into a refreshing soup. A type of noodle called thukpa, served with soup and vegetables/meat, is extremely popular in and around the hills of Darjeeling. There are a number of restaurants offering a variety of traditional Indian, Continental and Indian Chinese cuisine to cater to tourists. Tea is the most popular beverage, procured from the famed Darjeeling tea gardens, as well as coffee. Chhang or jaanr is a local alcoholic beverage made from fermented millet, maize or rice.\nSt. Andrew's Church, Darjeeling: During snowfall\nArchitecture\nColonial architecture characterizes many buildings in Darjeeling; several cottages, Gothic churches, the Raj Bhawan (Governor House), Planters' Club and various educational institutions are examples. Buddhist monasteries showcase the pagoda-style architecture.\nMusic\nDarjeeling is regarded as a center of music and a hotbed for musicians and music admirers. Singing and playing musical instruments is a common pastime among the resident population, who take pride in the traditions and role of music in their cultural life.

An improvised form of ball made of rubber bands is often used for playing in steep streets, and is known as Chungi.\nFilms\nDarjeeling is also a popular setting for Bollywood and Bengali films. Noted Bengali film director Satyajit Ray shot his film Kanchenjungha (1962) here. Bollywood movies such as Aradhana (1969), Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman (1992),\nMain Hoon Na (2004), Parineeta (2005), Barfi! (2012), Yaariyan (2014) and Jagga Jasoos (2017) were partially filmed in town.\nPlaces of interest\nSome notable places to visit include the Tiger Hill (a panoramic view of Mount Everest and Mount Kanchenjunga together), the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park (notable for conservation of red pandas), monasteries, and the tea gardens. The town attracts trekkers and sportsmen seeking to explore the Himalayas, serving as the starting point for climbing attempts on some Indian and Nepali peaks. Tenzing Norgay, one of the two men to first climb Mount Everest, spent most of his adult life in the Sherpa community in Darjeeling. His success provided the impetus to establish the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute in Darjeeling in 1954. In the Tibetan Refugee Self Help Centre, Tibetan crafts like carpets, wood, and leather work are displayed. Colonial architecture is exemplified in Darjeeling by cottages, St. Andrew's Church, Darjeeling Gothic churches, Planters' Club, the Raj Bhawan and various educational institutions. Several monasteries like Ghoom Monastery (8&nbsp;km or 5&nbsp;miles from the town), Bhutia Busty monastery, Mag-Dhog Yolmowa preserve ancient Buddhist scripts. A Peace Pagoda was built in 1992 by the Japanese Buddhist organisation Nipponzan Myohoji. The Mahakal Temple on Observatory Hill is a pilgrimage site for Hindu and Buddhists.  Although tourists have come to Darjeeling in vastly greater numbers after India's economic liberalisation, they have spent less on average, resulting in Darjeeling's luxury tourism increasingly giving way to mass tourism. Since 2012, Darjeeling has once again witnessed a steady inflow of both domestic and international tourists. As of 2015, around 50,000 foreign and 500,000 domestic tourists visit Darjeeling each year, the so-called \"Queen of the Hills\" continuing to appeal strongly to the imagination of tourists.\nSee also\nChowrasta\nCulture of West Bengal\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*"
