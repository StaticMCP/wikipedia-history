The competing teams were the Oklahoma State Cowboys, from the Big 12 Conference, and the Alabama Crimson Tide, representing the Southeastern Conference.  Oklahoma State won the game, 34–31.\nThis was the only 2006–07 bowl game in which both teams finished 6–6 in the regular season, and the first meeting between the programs on the gridiron. With the dismissal of Alabama head coach Mike Shula occurring in November, Joe Kines served as the Tide's head coach for this contest, with Nick Saban being hired as coach the following January.\nGame summary\nAlabama played Oklahoma State in the Independence Bowl on December 28, 2006.
