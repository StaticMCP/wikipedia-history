The suburb is the home of Mitcham Primary School, Mitcham Girls High School and St Joseph's School. Local landmarks include Kingswood Oval, Eynesbury House, Our Lady of Dolours Catholic Church and the historic Torrens Arms Hotel.\nHistory\nKingswood was established in 1945 as a formal proposal by the City of Mitcham to \"eliminate superfluous subdivisions names\" as requested by the Surveyor General of South Australia. At establishment, it consisted of the sub-divisions of Kingswood Estate, Kingswood Park, Mitchamville and a portion of Old Mitcham.  In February 2003, it was enlarged by the addition of portions of the adjoining suburbs of Netherby and Mitcham.\nAn electric tramway connecting Kingswood to the city centre was opened in 1917, with its terminus in Harrow Terrace near Kyre Avenue. The tramway was replaced with buses in 1954 with a new terminus at the corner of Tutt Avenue and Smith-Dorrien Street.\nNotable people\nAustralia's first female Prime Minister Julia Gillard was a student at Mitcham Primary School, Kingswood from 1969 to 1973. A building at the school is named in her honour.\nSee also\n* List of Adelaide obsolete suburb names\nReferences"
