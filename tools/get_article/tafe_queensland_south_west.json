It has 11 campus locations spread around the outer western suburbs of Brisbane, further out into regional south-west Queensland and partly into Wide Bay Burnett, covering an area approximately equal to the size of France.\nThe process of consolidating TAFE Queensland South West and TAFE Queensland's five other regional registered training organisations (RTOs) began in 2017. TAFE Queensland South West now no longer exists as a separate RTO.\nCampus locations\n*Ipswich\n*Toowoomba\n*Charleville\n*Chinchilla\n*Dalby\n*Inala\n*Kingaroy\n*Nurunderi\n*Roma\n*Springfield\n*Warwick\nSee also\n*TAFE Queensland\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://tafeqld.edu.au TAFE Queensland]"
