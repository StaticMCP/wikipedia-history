It is part of the University of Nebraska system and began operations in 1965.\nHistory\nThe Nebraska College of Technical Agriculture was preceded by the Nebraska School of Agriculture, which was established in 1895 as a part of the University of Nebraska system. In 1911, the Nebraska Legislature passed a bill to re-establish it as a boarding school for high school students. Curtis was selected as the site for the new school, over 11 other applicants in the state. The main building, now known as Agricultural Hall, was completed in 1913, and the school officially opened that same year.\nThe school underwent major expansions between 1928 and 1942. Expansions included new dorms, grain elevators, and heating plants. The college also rebranded to the University of Nebraska School of Agriculture in 1946. However, by the late 1950s, enrollment fell, mainly due to how high schools were introducing their own technical classes. In 1965, the State Legislature passed a bill to replace the school with a new post-secondary school. The college opened as the University of Nebraska Technical School of Agriculture at Curtis, and the previous school was dissolved in 1968.\nIn 1985, during the 1980s farm crisis, the State Legislature announced plans to close the college. The college was intended to close in 1988. In 1987, then-governor Kay A. Orr vetoed the financial appropriation necessary to keep the college open. However, after visiting the campus, she was able to allocate enough money to allow the school to stay open until at least two more years. In 1989, the college rebranded to the Nebraska College of Technical Agriculture. By 1994, the college went on a financial upswing.\nAcademics\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright sortable collapsible\"; text-align:right; font-size:80%;\"\n|+ style=\"font-size:90%\" |Undergraduate demographics as of 2025\n|-\n!
