Eight such courts were established. They were located in Ankara, Eskişehir, Konya, Isparta, Sivas, Kastamonu, Pozantı, and Diyarbakır. All but the Ankara court were terminated in 1921.\nAfter the law authorizing the Independence Courts was passed, the former commander of Turkish Armed Forces, General İsmet İnönü, proposed founding 14 Independence Courts. Only 7 courts were established, as it was felt that there would not be enough cases to justify fourteen courts. One month after the establishment of the courts, another court in Diyarbakır was established, bringing the total number to eight.\nAfter the end of the war, many felt that the Courts were no longer needed.  Although the government hoped to extend the life of the Courts, opposition pressure led to the closure of seven of the Independence Courts in 1921.\nThe Independence Tribunals of 1925\nIn March 1925, the  allowed that Independence Tribunals were reinstated in Ankara and Diyarbakır. The re-establishment was opposed by members of the Progressive Republican Party (TCF), who voiced concerns that they could issue death sentences without the permission of the Grand National Assembly. The Tribunal in Ankara prosecuted members of the TCF for their alleged links with the Sheikh Said revolt. The Party was closed down on the 5 June 1925, but the politicians were later acquitted and released.\nIn Diyarbakır the Tribunal was reinstated to counter the Sheikh Said rebellion. More than 7000 people were arrested by orders of the Independence tribunals and 660 people were executed In order to suppress the revolt. The Independence Tribunal in Diyarbakir prosecuted and sentenced the most. 5010 people were prosecuted of which 2779 were found not guilty and 420 sentenced to death.\nReferences"
