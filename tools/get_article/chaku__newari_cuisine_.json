The mixture is cooked down until it is a solid form, and then pulled on a hook in a manner similar to making taffy and then cut into small rolls, or it may be cooked in a shallow dish and cut into small diamond shaped pieces. Chaku may be eaten separately, or it can also be used in making Yomari (योमरी).\nChaku is served by Nepalese with ghee and yams during the festival of Maghe Sankranti.\nSee also\n* List of Nepalese dishes\nReferences"
