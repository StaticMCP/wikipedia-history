During the 1980s and '90s the band embarked on international tours.\nOn November 30, 2007, F.O.D. played their 25th anniversary show at the First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia. In 2015, SRA Records remastered and reissued a handful of their albums for that year's Record Store Day.\nBand members\nCurrent members\n*Jim McMonagle – vocals, guitar (1982–present)\n*Dave Rochon – bass guitar, vocals  (1983–present)\n*Bob Walker – drums (1986–present)\nFormer members\n*Zeke Zagar – bass guitar (1982–1983)\n*Mike Giannone – drums (1982–1986)\nTimeline\nImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:20\nPlotArea = left:80 bottom:60 top:0 right:30\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat  = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod = from:01/01/1982 till:12/31/2018\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nColors =\nid:Vocals     value:red     legend:Vocals\nid:Guitar     value:green   legend:Guitar\nid:Bass       value:blue    legend:Bass\nid:Drums      value:orange  legend:Drums\nid:Album      value:black   legend:Studio&nbsp;album\nLegend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom\nScaleMajor = increment:3 start:1982\nScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:1982\nLineData =\nlayer:back\ncolor:Album\nat:03/01/1986\nat:06/01/1988\nat:06/01/1990\nat:06/01/1994\nat:06/01/1996\nat:09/01/2000\nat:01/01/2010\nat:10/01/2018\nBarData =\nbar:Jim text:\"Jim McMonagle\"\nbar:Zeke text:\"Zeke Zagar\"\nbar:Dave text:\"Dave Rochon\"\nbar:Mike text:\"Mike Giannone\"\nbar:Bob text:\"Bob Walker\"\nPlotData=\nwidth:11\nbar:Jim from:06/01/1982 till:end color:Vocals\nbar:Jim from:06/01/1982 till:end color:Guitar width:3\nbar:Zeke from:06/01/1982 till:06/01/1983 color:Bass\nbar:Dave from:06/01/1983 till:end color:Bass\nbar:Dave from:06/01/1983 till:end color:Vocals width:3\nbar:Mike from:06/01/1982 till:09/01/1986 color:Drums\nbar:Bob from:09/01/1986 till:end color:Drums\nDiscography\nFull-length albums\n*Shatter Your Day LP (1986, Buy Our Records.
