From 1925 to 1929, shortly after Capone relocated to Chicago, he was the most notorious mobster in the country. Capone cultivated an image of himself in the media that fascinated the public. His personality and character have modeled fictional crime lords and criminal masterminds ever since his death. The stereotypical image of a mobster wearing a pinstriped suit and tilted fedora are based on photos of Capone. His accent, mannerisms, facial construction, physical stature, and parodies of his name have represented gangsters in comics, movies, music, and literature.\nLiterature\n* Capone is featured in a segment of Mario Puzo's The Godfather as an ally of New York mob boss Salvatore Maranzano in which he sends two \"button men\" at the mob boss' request to kill Don Vito Corleone; arriving in New York, the two men are intercepted and brutally killed by Luca Brasi, after which Don Corleone sends a message to Capone warning him not to interfere again, and Capone apparently capitulates.\n* Capone appears in Hergé's comic book Tintin in America, one of only two real-life characters in the entire The Adventures of Tintin series.\n* A reincarnated Capone is a major character in science fiction author Peter F. Hamilton's ''Night's Dawn Trilogy''.\n* Capone's grandniece Deirdre Marie Capone wrote a book titled Uncle Al Capone: The Untold Story from Inside His Family.\n* Al Capone is the inspiration for the central character of Tony Camonte in Armitage Trail's novel Scarface (1929), which was adapted into the 1932 film. The novel was later adapted again into the 1983 film with the central character of Tony Montana, by moving the action to then-present-day Miami.\n* Jack Bilbo claimed to have been a bodyguard for Capone in his book Carrying a Gun for Al Capone (1932).\n* Al Capone is mentioned and met by the main character Moose in the book Al Capone Does My Shirts.\n* A fictional alternate universe version of Al Capone is the second leader of a communist version of the United States known as the United Socialist States of America (USSA) in the 1997 alternate history book Back in the USSA by Eugene Byrne and Kim Newman. In the alternate universe depicted in the book, it was America instead of Russia that had a communist revolution in 1917 with Russia under the control of a democratic version of the Russian Empire as a rival of the USSA in this timeline's version of the Cold War. Many characters (consisting of real historical figures and characters from other fictional works) and events in Back in the USSA are parallel to those in real life with the USSA as the equivalent of the Soviet Union. Capone becomes leader of the Socialist Party of America and the USSA in 1926 after the death of the Party leader and regime's founder, Eugene V. Debs. Just as Debs was the equivalent of Vladimir Lenin, Capone was the equivalent of Joseph Stalin who was Soviet leader after Lenin's death. Capone ruled as a Stalinesque tyrant with widespread repression, a cult of personality based around himself as well as the exile of political opponents and includes the timeline's own version of Stalin's Great Purge where Capone directs the regime to kill his Party rivals. Just as with Stalin, Capone dies in office and replaced by Barry Goldwater who is depicted as a Nikita Khrushchev type reformist.\n* Another fictional alternate universe version of Al Capone is featured in the short story Boss by Mark Bourne in the alternate history anthology, Alternate Tyrants. The short story is written in the style of a Studs Terkel oral history. In it, the fictional version of Terkel narrates that Capone, after seeing a chance astronomical event, decides to start a political career. Capone is eventually elected President of the United States and starts a Mafia-like presidency that lasts for several decades.\nFilm and television\nCapone has been portrayed on screen by:\n* Rod Steiger in Al Capone (1959)\n* Neville Brand in the TV series The Untouchables and again in the film The George Raft Story (1961)\n* José Calvo in Due mafiosi contro Al Capone (1966)\n* Jason Robards in ''The St. Valentine's Day Massacre (1967)\n* Ben Gazzara in Capone'' (1975)\n* Robert De Niro in Brian De Palma's Eliot Ness biopic The Untouchables (1987)\n* Ray Sharkey in The Revenge of Al Capone (1989)\n* Eric Roberts in The Lost Capone (1990)\n* Titus Welliver in Mobsters (1991)\n* Bernie Gigliotti in The Babe (1992), in a brief scene in a Chicago nightclub during which Capone and his mentor Johnny Torrio, played by Guy Barile, meet the film's main character Babe Ruth, portrayed by John Goodman.\n* William Forsythe in The Untouchables (1993–1994)\n* William Devane in Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, season 2, episode 7: \"That Old Gang of Mine\" (1994)\n* F.
