In April 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) granted full Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches that will be played between Czech Republic women and other ICC members after 1 July 2018 have been eligible for full WT20I status. Czech Republic played their first ever WT20I on 8 June 2024 against Austria.\nRecords and statistics\nInternational Match Summary&nbsp;— Czech Republic Women\nLast updated 7 September 2025\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 600px;\"\n|-\n| colspan=7 align=\"center\" | Playing Record\n|-\n!
