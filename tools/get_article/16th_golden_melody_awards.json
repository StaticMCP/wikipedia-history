This mistake resulted in a confusion where Wang took the stage to receive the award without realizing that Mok had made the mistake. The actual award was meant for Huang, who was a relative newcomer compared to the more popular Wang. The mistake was partially blamed on Mok's Cantonese language background, which pronounces the two characters for \"Wang\" () and \"Huang\" () as \"Wong\" with the same tone. The second character in both artist's names also had the same tone in Mandarin, complicating the process because the third part of the name was nearly drowned out by the audience. Wang won the award the following year at the 17th Golden Melody Awards.\nSpecial segments\nLeehom Wang and Jay Chou were interviewed and asked to comment on each other.\nChou also performed a medley piano battle with Nan Quan Mama group member Yuhao Zhan. The medley included segments from Prelude and Fugue No. 2 in C minor in Book 1 of Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier, a capriccio of Chou's song \"Reverse Scales\" (), and the theme song of Super Mario Bros.\nExternal links\n*  [http://info.gio.gov.tw/webPage.asp?CuItem=28450 16th Golden Melody Awards nominees]\n*  [http://info.gio.gov.tw/webPage.asp?CuItem=28026 16th Golden Melody Awards winners]\nReferences"
