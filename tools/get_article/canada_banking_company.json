It failed to obtain permission to issue the notes, faded after few months of operations and disappeared before the start of the 19th century.\nThe company was a private bank, not a public bank, and appears to have been only a deposit-taking institution that issued a few bills, notably army bills. A surviving copy is held in the National Currency Collection of the Bank of Canada.\nRichardson and Forsyth founded the more successful Bank of Montreal in 1817.\nReferences"
