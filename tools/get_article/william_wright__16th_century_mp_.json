He was originally intended to serve with Alan Staveley, but Staveley was replaced by the more experienced William Nelson. He also served as lord mayor of York (1518–1519) having been elected by letters patent. At some point after serving as MP he married Urusula Joye of Riccall. In 1523 he was contracted by Cardinal Wolsey to be master of the archiepiscopal mint. He served a second term a lord mayor in 1535 which was marked by a dispute over the lands at Bishopfields with the Archbishop of York.

He requested to be buried in St Martin's Church in Coney Street and left a third of his goods to his wife and children.\nReferences"
