It lies north of the A158 and west of the A16 roads. It is in the civil parish of Sausthorpe.\nFr T. Pelham Dale, SSC, prosecuted and imprisoned for Ritualist practices in 1876 and 1880, and regarded a martyr by Anglo-Catholics, was the parish priest from 1881 to 1892.\nAswardby Hall was built approximately 1845, with further building works completed around 1910.\nAswardby should not be confused with Aswarby, which is also in Lincolnshire, but about  south-west of Aswardby.\nSee also\n* Roger de Aswardby, 14th-century Master of University College, Oxford\nReferences\nExternal links"
