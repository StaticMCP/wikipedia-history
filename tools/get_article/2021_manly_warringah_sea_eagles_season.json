Des Hasler coached the team for the third consecutive year and eleventh overall at the club. Daly Cherry-Evans captained the club for the fifth consecutive year.\nStephen Humphreys|league=NRL|coach= Des Hasler|stadium=Brookvale Oval (restricted capacity)|captain= Daly Cherry-Evans|prev_season=2020|next_season=2022|league_wins=16|league_draws=0|league_losses=8|year=2021|top_tries= Tom Trbojevic (28)|top_points= Reuben Garrick (334)|avg_attendance=5,705|high_attendance=6,801 (Vs NQL Round 14|low_attendance=3,218 (Vs SOU Round 2)|playoff_result=Preliminary Finals|cup_result=4th|league_rank=4th}}\nBrookvale Oval (4 Pines Park) upgrade and home ground capacity\nConstruction started for a new 3,000-seat grandstand and a centre of excellence on the Northern Hill. The $33.1 million project was to ensure that players and fans get access to better facilities than what the stadium currently provides. Due to that and limited capacity on the hill (due to COVID-19), there were only small crowds allowed in at home games. Grandstands were allowed at 100% on the final game before the games started to play behind closed doors.\nTransfers\nSource:\n2021 gains\n* Josh Aloiai from Wests Tigers\n* Andrew Davey from Parramatta Eels\n* Kieran Foran from Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs\n* Christian Tuipulotu from Sydney Roosters\n* Jason Saab from St. George Illawarra Dragons\n2021 losses\n* Joel Thompson to St Helens R.F.C.

It got so bad that there were talks that coach Des Hasler may get sacked, however he was re-signed on a two-year deal and was told he wouldn't be coaching in 2023 if the club didn't make the finals in 2021 or 22. Captain Daly Cherry-Evans suitability for the role was also questioned. The club achieved their first win in round 5 of the season playing the New Zealand Warriors at Central Coast Stadium when Daly Cherry-Evans kicked a winning field goal to win 13–12. Despite the terrible start to the season it is worth noting that the four clubs that Manly lost to (Sydney Roosters, South Sydney Rabbitohs, St. George Illawarra Dragons and Penrith Panthers) all made up the top four after the first 5 rounds.\nTurbo returns\nIn Round 6 the club faced the Gold Coast Titans in what was expected by many people to be yet another hammering against the club. However, with Tom Trbojevic returning to the side from his fourth hamstring injury in just two years, Manly played the reverse card winning 36–0 with Trbojevic being named man of the match after scoring a try, making 3 assists and being involved with a crucial pass to Cherry-Evans that led to the second try.\nFollowing that performance Trbojevic produced man of the match performances against the Wests Tigers, New Zealand Warriors, Brisbane Broncos and Parramatta Eels, only losing to the Penrith Panthers in that time frame in what was a much better performance than the first time they played. Manly ended the first half to the season with a poor (but controversial) loss to the Newcastle Knights.\nOrigin period\nAfter a bye, Manly thrashed the North Queensland Cowboys 50-18 without Trbojevic, with many players being the potential Man Of The Match, this match also was special as it was a game for Manly icon Bob Fulton, who had died a few weeks earlier (a moment of silence occurred before the match against the Parramatta Eels in Round 11 but this was the first home match since his death).\nThe following week, Manly produced one of the biggest comebacks in history against the Gold Coast Titans after being down 24–8, the team scored 48 unanswered points to win 56–24.\nThe following week, Manly produced their biggest win in club history beating the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs 66–0.\nThe origin period rounded off with a 30–16 loss against the Canberra Raiders and a 32–18 win against the St. George Illawarra Dragons.\nRun to the finals and records broken\nManly started off their run to the finals with a 44–24 win against the Wests Tigers, a 40–22 win against the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks and a 28–18 loss to the Melbourne Storm.\nIn Round 22, Manly beat the Parramatta Eels 56–10 in a very strong performance. Reuben Garrick also achieved a record in the match passing the record for most points scored for the club in a season by a player, passing Matthew Ridge's record of 255, with Garrick having scored 258 points at the end of the round.\nManly continued their winning performances against the Canberra Raiders, winning 19–18.\nIn Round 24, the club's 36–18 win over the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs propelled them into the top four and ensured that Tom Trbojevic would win the prestigious Dally M Medal for player of the year.\nRound 25, the club beat the Cowboys 46–18 in a strong second half performance. Reuben Garrick (304) also passed Hazem El Masri's (288) record for most points in a regular season. The game also saw a collective effort from Reuben Garrick, Daly Cherry-Evans and Tom Trbojevic to score the try of the year.\nFinals\nManly started off with a poor performance to begin the finals, losing to the Melbourne Storm 40–12 at Sunshine Coast Stadium forcing them into a second chance semi due to them finishing in the top four.\nManly produced a 42–6 win against the Sydney Roosters advancing them to the preliminary finals.\nOn the lead up to their preliminary final match against the South Sydney Rabbitohs, many people, especially former Penrith player Ryan Girdler criticised Manly for making the top four but not beating any side that finished in the top four labelling them as 'flat track bullies' stating that they don't deserve to be 80 minutes away from a grand final. Manly went on to lose the match 36–16, with Tom Trbojevic breaking Phil Blake's record (27) for most tries in a season for the club scoring 28.\nTom Trbojevic finished the season as top try scorer for the club, with Reuben Garrick finishing as top point scorer with 334 points.\nResults\nPre-season\nSource:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Date\n!Round\n!Opponent\n!Venue\n!Score\n!Tries\n!Goals\n!Attendance\n|- bgcolor=#FFBBBB\n|Sun 28 February 5:00pm\n|3\n|Wests Tigers\n|Leichhardt Oval\n|52-18\n|K.
