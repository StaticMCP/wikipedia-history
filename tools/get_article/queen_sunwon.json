She was known as Queen Dowager Myeonggyeong () after her husband's death in 1834. She served as regent between 1834 and 1841 during her grandson, Heonjong of Joseon's reign, and in 1849–1852 during her adoptive son, Cheoljong of Joseon's reign. She was posthumously called as Sunwon, the Respectful Empress ().\nBiography\nEarly life\nThe future Queen Consort was born into the Andong Kim clan on 8 June 1789. She was the eldest daughter and third child of Kim Jo-sun and his wife, Lady Sim of the Cheongsong Sim clan. Through her father, Lady Kim was a 5th great-grandniece of Queen Inmok, the second wife of King Seonjo and mother of Princess Jeongmyeong. She was also a first cousin twice removed of Princess Jeongmyeong through her paternal grandmother, Lady Shin.\nHer mother's side was already connected to the royal family since her maternal grandfather, Sim Geon-ji, was a 5th cousin of Sim Neung-geon (심능건, 沈能建; 1752 – 7 July 1817); who was the son-in-law of Yeongjo of Joseon as he was married to his daughter, Princess Hwaryeong. Sim Geon-ji was also close to Sim Hwan-ji (심환지, 沈煥之; 1730 – 18 October 1802); who was a member of the Noron Byeokpa faction. Because of this, Sim Hwan-ji was able to interfere with the final selection of who could become Queen Consort.\nAs Lady Kim was from the Andong Kim clan, which was under the leadership of her father Kim Jo-sun, who was also a member of the Noron faction and served as Jeongjo of Joseon's closest aide, Lady Kim emerged as a powerful soon-to-be queen when she was selected among the young girls.\nQueen consort\nIn 1802 at the age of 13, Lady Kim married King Sunjo and became the Queen of Joseon. The Queen eventually bore 5 children; Hyomyeong in 1809, Princess Myeongon in 1810, Princess Bokon in 1818, and Princess Deokon in 1828—with only one son dying in infancy in 1820.\nRegent\nWhen her husband died in 1834, she became regent for her eight-year-old grandson, King Heonjong and the political power remained in the hands of her family, the Andong Kim clan until 1840, when it passed to the family of Heonjong's mother, Queen Sinjeong, the Pungyang Jo clan, following the Catholic persecution of 1839.\nPrior to the death of her grandson in 1849 and becoming regent once again, the Queen had outlived her children as one of her remaining daughters, Princess Deokon, died in 1844. The Queen eventually became regent again during King Cheoljong's reign in 1849. With her influence, she had the king marry a daughter from her clan in 1851, who was known as Queen Cheorin, and ruled as regent until his fourth year of reign in 1852.\nDeath\nQueen Sunwon later died in Changdeokgung, on 21 September 1857. The Queen's clan power later diminished when Queen Shinjeong adopted Grand Internal Prince Heungseon's son, Yi Myeong-bok, as her own to become the next king. The Queen Dowager stepped down and gave all power to the Grand Internal Prince Heungseon to help his son as regent; thus removing all power of the Andong Kim clan's influence as well as the Pungyang Jo clan in the end.\nQueen Sunwon is buried with her husband in Inreung located in Naegok-dong, Seocho District, Seoul.\nFamily\n* Father\n** Kim Jo-sun (; 1765–1832)\n* Mother\n** Internal Princess Consort Cheongyang of the Cheongsong Sim clan (; 1766–1828)\n* Siblings\n** Older brother - Kim Yu-geun (; March 1785 – July 1840); became the adopted son of Kim Yong-sun () and Lady Hong of the Pungsan Hong clan ()\n** Older brother - Kim Won-geun (; 1786–1832)\n** Younger sister - Lady Kim of the Andong Kim clan (; 1792–?)\n** Younger sister - Lady Kim of the Andong Kim clan (; 1794–?)\n** Younger sister - Lady Kim of the Andong Kim clan (; 1795–?)\n** Younger brother - Kim Jwa-geun (; 1797–1869)\n** Younger brother - Kim Son-geun ()\n* Husband\n** Yi Gong, King Sunjo (; 29 July 1790 – 13 December 1834)\n* Issue\n** Son - Crown Prince Hyomyeong (; 18 September 1809 – 25 June 1830)\n** Daughter - Princess Myeongon (; 1810–1832)\n** Daughter - Princess Bokon (; 1818–1832)\n** Unnamed son (1820–1820)\n** Daughter - Princess Deokon (; 1822–1844)\n** Adoptive son - King Cheoljong of Joseon (; 25 July 1831 – 16 January 1864)\nIn popular culture\n* Portrayed by Han Soo-yeon in the 2016 KBS2 TV series Moonlight Drawn by Clouds.\n* Portrayed by Bae Jong-ok in the 2020–2021 tvN TV series Mr. Queen.\nReferences\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}"
