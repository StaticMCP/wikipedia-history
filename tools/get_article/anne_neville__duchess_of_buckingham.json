Her first husband was Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and she was an important English noblewoman, landholder and book owner during the fifteenth century.\nLife\nAnne was born around 1408, a daughter of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmoreland, and his second wife Lady Joan Beaufort, the legitimised daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster. Sometime before October 1424 she married Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham, heir of Edmund Stafford, 5th Earl of Stafford, and one of the wealthiest men in England.\nThrough her first marriage, Anne became a significant landholder. She managed the estates and financial matters with some success: the revenue of her dower lands increased notably under her direction. Drawing an annual income of £884 in 1460, the year she became a widow, the revenue increased by 40% to £1,245 by 1473, when her grandson Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham came of age.\nShe was widowed in 1460 when Humphrey was killed at the Battle of Northampton and remained unmarried until 1467. In that year she took as her second husband Walter Blount, 1st Baron Mountjoy (d. 1474). His will suggests that a prenuptial agreement was put in place at that time for he left Anne \"all such goods as were her proper goods the day afore our marriage or that she hath brought since or to her given by any person\".\nAs the Dowager Duchess of Buckingham she bore the train of queen consort Elizabeth Woodville at her coronation on 26 May 1465.\nBook ownership\nLike many noblewomen of her age, Anne was highly educated and she has become associated with book collecting. She owned the Wingfield Hours, a psalter that includes a prayer identifying Anne as the owner. Her will contains a number of books in both English and French. These were passed on to her daughter-in-law Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Stafford, and daughter of Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset. The two women had exchanged books during the 1460s when Margaret and her husband Humphrey moved close to Anne in Surrey.\nAncestry\nReferences"
