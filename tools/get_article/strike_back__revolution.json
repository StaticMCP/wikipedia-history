After obtaining intel from Zarkova’s handler, Pavel Kuragin, Coltrane discovers British High Commissioner James McKitterick is being forced to work with the triads to pay off a gambling debt. The team follows him to a meeting with the triads where he is forced to authorise a diplomatic transfer to transport the warhead out of the city. Zarkova and Wyatt are able to evacuate an injured McKitterick, but he later commits suicide. Wanting to avenge Davis, Novin disobeys orders and pursues Laoshu, engaging in a brutal fight and eventually killing him. The rest of the team and Leong pursue the warhead to the Hulu Langat District, and although they are able to arrest the leader of the triad, the warhead is transported away via helicopter.

Wyatt and Mac accompany Ryan to his law firm to retrieve the information, but the building is attacked by Gopan and his men and Ryan is killed. Unable to crack Ryan’s hard drive, the team ambushes Kuragin and use his equipment to track down the secondary location of the suitcase nukes. Vartak confronts Gopan about building the devices, having only enlisted him to build small scale dirty bombs to detonate in mosques around the city. Gopan acknowledges that he was hired by Kingfisher to rebuild the warhead and disguise its origin. Upon discovering a national newspaper has evidence of her dealings with Gopan, Vartak desperately flees with a suicide vest and is pursued by Wyatt, who is able to stop her detonating the device in a Muslim family's house by pushing her out of a window, accidentally killing her. The rest of the team follows the nukes and engage in a firefight, but are unable to stop the transport from escaping. Chetri is able to use a drone to identify the driver as Nemo Kyaw, a Burmese national.

The team meets with Coltrane’s contact in the region, DEA Special Agent Lauren Gillespie, who provides them with intel allowing them to destroy Zaza’s communication network and eavesdrop when he switches to regular channels. She also blackmails Wyatt into killing Zaza’s lieutenant instead of bringing him in for questioning. Section 20 discover Zaza intends to sell the devices to Al-Shabaab, but when the group's arms broker Gabrielle Barre is accidentally killed on arrival, Novin takes her place at the deal. Novin uses Zarkova’s data leaching device to try and ascertain the location of the nukes, but before the extraction is complete Zaza receives a message informing him of her true identity and a firefight breaks out.

Mac confronts Wyatt about him being blackmailed by Gillespie, causing Wyatt to reveal he was part of a special operations unit in Iraq that went rogue and started killing civilians, forcing him to kill his colleagues to stop it. Zaza and the corrupt prison warden agree to have Novin and Zarkova killed in a prison fight, but they end up teaming up with the inmates sent to kill them to escape the facility. The two escape with the help of Mac and Wyatt, but discover the intel has been destroyed. Chetri discovers it was Gillespie that betrayed Novin to Zaza. Confronted by Coltrane, she reveals an alliance with Zaza to gain information about other cartels in the region, having used a DEA slush fund to help finance his rise to power. After abandoning Coltrane, she is kidnapped by Kuragin and taken to where Zaza is keeping the nukes. Section 20 follows, and is able to kill Zaza and acquire the devices, although Gillespie is killed. On exit, Wyatt is shot by Kuragin who takes the devices with Zarkova, although he is eventually found by Mac and Novin. Zarkova confronts Kuragin, who admits to killing Beshnov and her team in Malaysia. Zarkova calls 'Directorate 338' in Moscow to report Pavel's crimes, but after a brief conversation she lowers her weapon and salutes Kuragin.\n|LineColor = 32CD32\n}}\n|Aux3 = 0.121\n|OriginalAirDate =\n|Aux4 = 0.608\n|ShortSummary = Wyatt returns to work, with the gunshot having missed all of his vital organs. Kuragin travels with Zarkova to Jakarta, Indonesia, where they are forced to raise their own funds by robbing a jewelry store as punishment for killing Beshnov. Chetri uncovers information on Roman Lesnitsky, an FSB analyst with information on Kuragin. Although extracting him from Saratov is forbidden by Whitehall, Coltrane tells the team it has been approved. In Russia, Lesnitsky informs Coltrane, Novin and Mac that he is the architect of the “Kingfisher” project, a response to Western economic sanctions after the annexation of Crimea. The team are attacked during the exfil and Lesnitsky flees, but tells them of a man involved named Hassan Ahmed, the recently released founder of an Indonesian Islamic terrorist group. Kuragin and Zarkova meet with Ahmed, but are followed and ambushed by Section 20. Ahmed is able to escape, but the team, Zarkova and Kuragin are arrested by Indonesian Kopassus commandos led by Colonel Aldo, who take the Russians away in separate transport. Coltrane confesses to Chetri the team has not had permission to operate since Myanmar. Novin deduces the soldiers are corrupt and plan to execute them, but they are rescued by Coltrane. Chetri tracks Ahmed alone to an abandoned shopping mall in the city, but is captured when she sees his team preparing one of the suitcase nukes.\n|LineColor = 32CD32\n}}\n|Aux3 = 0.127\n|OriginalAirDate =\n|Aux4 = 0.559\n|ShortSummary = Wyatt and Novin enter the shopping mall, where they are able to obtain Hassan and the device, but are pursued by Aldo’s commandos. It is revealed Hassan's device was never intended to be armed, but to be “discovered” and foiled by Aldo in order to make the current government seem weak. This would allow Aldo’s faction to rise to power and lead a puppet government for the Russians, allowing them to exert international influence and circumvent economic sanctions. Coltrane and Mac meet with Army Chief of Staff General Dewanto, but are attacked by various hostiles resulting in Dewanto being injured. Chetri is revealed to have been kidnapped by Pavel, who uses her to repair a remote detonator, as he intends to go against Lesnitsky's plan and activate the device. Wyatt and Novin escape the mall, however both Hassan and Aldo are killed, leaving no witnesses to testify to Pavel’s machinations. Questioning her loyalties, Zarkova aids Novin in disarming the device when Pavel activates it, and later releases Chetri from captivity as she is no longer willing to go through with Pavel’s plans. In the aftermath, Coltrane is interrogated at a black site in Moscow in order to help corroborate Zarkova’s claims about Kuragin’s true intentions. He and Section 20 are then asked by Zarkova and members of the Russian government to help them bring in Pavel before he causes a war between Russia and the West.\n|LineColor = 32CD32\n}}\n|Aux3 = 0.100\n|OriginalAirDate =\n|Aux4 = 0.515\n|ShortSummary = Four months later Coltrane, Zarkova, Chetri, Mac and Novin remain in pursuit of Pavel.

Wyatt, now working as a private bodyguard for American security tech businessman Caleb Montgomery—and secretly tracking Kuragin independently—finds himself in the same location. During a sale of software between Petrenko and Montgomery, Section 20 reunites with Wyatt and apprehends the two, but Petrenko escapes when Pavel attacks the club with an IED.

Mac, Wyatt and Novin are able to obtain secure the keys before they can be sold by ISIL to Pavel’s group, but a large gunfight erupts during their exfil. Pinned down, Coltrane helps Section 20 escape by providing covering fire, but he is disarmed and captured by Pavel, Petrenko and Orlov before he can rejoin the group.\n|LineColor = 32CD32\n}}\n|Aux3 = 0.133\n|OriginalAirDate =\n|Aux4 = 0.504\n|ShortSummary = Section 20 are able to rescue Coltrane and capture Pavel.

Kuragin uses the keys to target three chemical missiles at London, Paris and Berlin. He injures Zarkova and forces Novin to kill him rather than give up the override code. Wyatt kills Petrenko. With Chetri unable to cancel the launch sequence, the team uses plastic explosive to blow up the missiles in their silos and prevent the launch. They barely escape the complex as it is destroyed.
