As such, it provides context for the post-medieval historiography of the Crusades. This includes authors and works from the sixteenth century through the nineteenth century. Works are referenced, where available, to the various national collection of biographies, collections linked to the digital libraries of the University of Michigan's HathiTrust and OCLC's WorldCat, and the bibliographic work of Les Archives de littérature du Moyen Âge (ARLIMA) and Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF).\nOverview\nHistorians of the Crusades are generally of two types. The first are the authors of works, the original sources, that were done contemporaneously with the historical events. The later works from the early modern period, written in the 16th century through the 19th century, are the subject of this article and include a variety of subjects including:\n* General histories and chronologies of the Crusades, either comprehensive studies or ones narrowly targeted.\n* Regional histories of Western Europe or the Middle East during the Crusader era and, if relevant, beforehand.\n* Ecclesiastical works.\n* Works of fiction or art deemed important by modern Crusades historians.\nSources for biographies include the following. The first is Part V: Brief Biographies of Crusade Historians, of The Routledge Companion to the Crusades by historian Peter Lock. Part IV: Historiography, or What Historians have said about the Crusades, of Lock's tome, also provides historical perspectives on the authors and their works. The second is the Historians of the Crusades (2007–2008), an on-line database of scholars working in the field of Crusader studies. The related articles are listed above.\nSixteenth century\nThe 16th century was marked by two major influences on Crusader histories: the Turkish wars and the Protestant Reformation. The wars with the Ottoman Turks had begun in the 13th century but reached their peak in the 16th. The dichotomy between Protestant and Catholic was reflected in the differing views of the Crusades—an evil arm of the papacy versus meritorious and laudable endeavours. Highlights include:\n* Notable histories include those by Basilius Herold, Reiner Reineck (with commentary by Matthäus Dresser), Heinrich Meibom, Justus Lipsius,  Di Antonio Mossi and Michele Zappulo. The history of Étienne Pasquier was first to assign numbers to the Crusades.\n* Differing views on the Turks and the concept of a Holy War, exemplified by works of Erasmus, Martin Luther, and John Foxe, as well as numerous theological works.\n* The work of poet Torquato Tasso was to be at the forefront of Crusader writing for two centuries.\n*The struggles of the military orders in Malta, Rhodes and Cyprus against the Ottomans, in the works of John Caius and Uberto Foglietta.\nJohn Caius.
