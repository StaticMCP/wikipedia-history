It starred James Naughton, Graham Jarvis, Alley Mills, Steven Peterman, and boasted the first TV series roles for Philip Charles MacKenzie and George Wendt. It was set at Franklin High School in St. Louis, and aired as a part of CBS' Monday night comedy lineup. The theme song was a modified version of Tom Scott's \"Heading Home\", which appeared on his Street Beat album three years earlier.\nThe quick cancellation of Making the Grade allowed series co-star George Wendt the opportunity to star in the series Cheers, which began airing just four months after the final episode of Making the Grade was broadcast.   As well, series creator Gary David Goldberg's next series was the substantial hit Family Ties; it too began airing four months after the cancellation of Making the Grade.\nCast\n* James Naughton as Harry Barnes (Dean of Boys)\n* Graham Jarvis as Assistant Principal Jack Felspar\n* Alley Mills as Sara Conover (drama teacher)\n* Steven Peterman as Jeff Keitan\n* Zane Lasky as Anton Zemeckis\n* George Wendt as Gus Bertoia (physical education teacher)\n* Philip Charles MacKenzie as David Wasserman\n* Veronica Redd as Janice Reeves\nU.S. television ratings\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!
