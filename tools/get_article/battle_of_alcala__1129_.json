Alfonso the Battler took advantage of this and took Zaragoza (1118), Calatayud and Daroca (1120).\nAlfonso I of Aragon attacked the land of Valencia in 1128. The Almoravids responded by sending a powerful army newly arrived from deep Morocco, which joined the African horsemen of the governor of Seville with the aim of hunting down Alfonso of Aragon. They fought at the Castle of els Alcalans and resulted in an Aragonese victory.\nConsequences\nAccording to the Valencian-Muslim poet Ibn al-Abbar, the disastrous defeat of the Almoravids caused Xarq al-Andalus to lose popularity and, after a while, would lead to the proclamation of a few second taifa kingdoms in Xarq al- Andalusia (from 1144 in Valencia)\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://data.internum.org/component.php?id=10185 Castell of the Alcalans]"
