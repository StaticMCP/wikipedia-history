In the 2001 presidential run-off, Pires had defeated Veiga by a margin of only 12 votes. In 2006, Pires won another narrow victory, prevailing by about 3,000 votes and slightly surpassing the 50% majority necessary to avoid a run-off.\nResults\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110210153057/http://www.cne.cv/ National Elections Commission]"
