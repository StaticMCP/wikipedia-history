According to some scholars, the \"Avantivarma\" of Mudrarakshasa is actually another king of the Maukhari dynasty.\nAccording to Bargaon grant of Ratnapal, Mlechchha king Salasthambha took over the rule of Kamarupa from the descendants of Naraka. K.L. Barua states that there was a Mlechha revolt in Kamarupa and the leader of the Mlecchas usurped the throne by deposing Bhaskaravarman's immediate successor Avantivarman. Mukunda Madhava Sharma theorizes that Salasthambha must have overthrown the immediate successor of Bhaskaravarman. P.C Choudhury opines that Salasthambha, the founder of Mlechchha dynasty was known as Avantivarman.\nSee also\n* Pala Dynasty\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
