The term folk music can not be easily defined in a precise manner; it is used with widely varying definitions depending on the author, intended audience and context within a work. Similarly, the term traditions in this context does not connote any strictly defined criteria. Music scholars, journalists, audiences, record industry individuals, politicians, nationalists and demagogues may often have occasion to address which fields of folk music are to a distinct group of people and with characteristics undiluted by contact with the music of other peoples; thus, the folk music traditions described herein overlap in varying degrees with each other. Sometimes, folk songs will often be passed down.\nEurope\n; ;\n|Styles           =\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Styles           =\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n; ; [http://www.hobgoblin.com/info/glossary.htm Hobgoblin Info Source]; ; ;\n|Styles           =\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Styles           = &nbsp;\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n; Winick, Steven D., \"Brittany\", in Mathieson, pp. 110–139; [http://www.ceolas.org/Regions/Brittany/Breton.html Ceolas];\n|Styles           =\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n; ; ; ;\n|Styles           =\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            = Koprivshtitsa|nestinarstvo|sedyanki\n}}\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            = ijujú|gudos\n}}\n; [http://www.hobgoblin.com/info/glossary.htm Hobgoblin Info Source]; ;\n|Styles           =\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            = cantada|correfoc|esbartades|sonador|vetlada|xacota\n}}\n|Styles           = bachîn ringing\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Styles           = Cornish carol\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            = gorsedd\n}}\n; ;\n|Styles           = tamburitza\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Styles           =\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Styles           =\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            = Kalevipoeg\n}}\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            = Kalevala\n}}\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Styles           =\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Styles           =\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            = táncház\n}}\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Peoples          =\n|Geography        =\n|Other            = saga\n}}\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  = &nbsp;\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Styles           =\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            = tarantolati\n}}\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Styles           =\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            = kappleikar\n}}\n|Styles           =\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            = dozynki\n}}\n|Styles           =\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n}}\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Styles           =\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            = capra\n}}\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            = noaite\n}}\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n||Styles           = izvorna|narodna muzika|novokomponovana narodna muzika|sevdalinka&nbsp;\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Styles           =\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Styles           =\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Other            = Pomana\n}}\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
