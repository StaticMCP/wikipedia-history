It can also provide information on the strength of that formation and the equipment used. An order of battle is not necessarily a set structure, and it can change depending on tactical or strategic developments, or the evolution of military doctrine. For example, a division could be altered radically from one campaign to another through the adding or removing of subunits, but retain its identity and prior history. The size of a division can vary dramatically as a result of what forces are assigned and the doctrine employed at that time.\nThe first 3rd Division that was formed was a mere 3,747 men strong and did not include supporting weapons such as artillery. In comparison, the 3rd Infantry Division, from the Second World War period, was over 18,000 men strong and supported by 72 artillery pieces and numerous other support weapons. Each war that the division fought in, between 1809 and 1945, has a corresponding order of battle section.\nNapoleonic Wars\n'', the man who commanded the division for the majority of the Peninsular War, by William Beechey.]]\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815), the British Army grew in size. On 18 June 1809, Lieutenant-General Arthur Wellesley, commander of the British forces in Spain and Portugal, ordered the creation of four divisions, including the 3rd Division. During the division's first action of the Peninsular War (the name given to Napoleonic Wars fought in Spain and Portugal), the Battle of Talavera (1809), it was 3,747 men strong. By the next year, it had grown to a strength of 4,743 men, including attached Portuguese troops. The strength of the division fluctuated over the following years, partially as a result of Portuguese troops being attached and detached. In 1811, the division had increased to 5,480 men. It then peaked at 7,437 men strong during 1813, before decreasing to 4,566 during the final stages of the Peninsular War. It was reformed on 11 April 1815, in the Southern Netherlands (modern-day Belgium), on the resumption of hostilities. It fought at the Battles of Quatre Bras and Waterloo, and had a strength of 6,970 men. It then marched into France. Shortly after, the Napoleonic Wars came to a conclusion. The division remained within the restored French kingdom, as part of the British Army of Occupation until it was disbanded in France during April 1817.\nTalavera Campaign (July 1809)\nDuring this period, brigades were referred to by their commander's names.

On 4 August, Germany invaded Belgium and the United Kingdom entered the war against the German Empire. The division soon after deployed to France, as part of the British Expeditionary Force, and it then served on the Western Front between 1914 and 1918.\nThe war establishment, the on-paper strength, of an infantry division in 1914 was 18,179 men, 5,594 horses, 18 motor vehicles, 76 pieces of artillery, and 24 machine guns. While there was a small change to the number of men and horses in a division in 1915, the main change was the decrease in artillery pieces to 48 and an increase in motor vehicles to 54. The establishment in 1916 increased the division size to 19,372 men, 5,145 horses, 61 motor vehicles, 64 artillery pieces, 40 trench mortars, and 200 machine guns. The 1917 changes saw a decrease to 18,825 men, 4,342 horses, 57 motor vehicles, and 48 artillery pieces, although the number of trench mortars remained the same, and the number of machine guns increased to 264. By 1918, the number of front line infantry within the British Army in France had decreased because of casualties and a lack of eligible replacements, and this had led to a manpower crisis. To consolidate manpower and to increase the ratio of machine guns and artillery support available to the infantry, the number of battalions in a division was reduced from twelve to nine. This resulted in the 1918 establishment of 16,035 men, 3,838 horses, 79 motor vehicles, 48 artillery pieces, 36 trench mortars, and 400 machine guns.\nFirst World War (1914–1918)\n3rd Division}}\n7th Infantry Brigade (until 18 October 1915)\n* 3rd Battalion, Worcestershire Regiment\n* 2nd Battalion, South Lancashire Regiment\n* 1st Battalion, Wiltshire Regiment\n* 2nd Battalion, Royal Irish Rifles\n* 1st Battalion, Honourable Artillery Company (from 9 December 1914, until 14 October 1915)\n* 1/4th Battalion, South Lancashire Regiment (until 12 October 1915)\n8th Infantry Brigade\n* 2nd Battalion, Royal Scots\n* 2nd Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment (until 24 October 1914))\n* 4th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment (until 13 November 1915)\n* 1st Battalion, Gordon Highlanders (until 12 September 1914;
