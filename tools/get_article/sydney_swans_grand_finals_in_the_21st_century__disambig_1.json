      "text": "# Sydney Swans Grand Finals in the 21st century__disambig_1\n\nSince the 2001 AFL season, the Sydney Swans have competed in 7 AFL Grand Finals, winning 2 and losing 5. This period of Swans success has been noted for fielding consistent teams who have made the finals, only missing out on playing finals football 5 times in 24 seasons. However, the Swans have also been noted their lack of success in Grand Finals. This has led to many fans calling the team \"chokers\", with others providing the team with the name the \"Swannywobbles\". The term \"Swannywobbles\" is in reference to the infamous \"Colliwobbles\", a period between 1958 and 1990, where the Collingwood Football Club lost 8 Grand Finals and drew 1.\nPeriod of success\nIn 2005, the Swans defeated the West Coast Eagles in the 2005 AFL Grand Final. This was their first premiership in 72 years, last winning a flag all the way back in 1933. This was their first premiership since moving to Sydney in 1982, where they had previously been based out of South Melbourne. Due to the close margin, with the Swans narrowly winning by 4 points, this Grand Final has been considered one of the greatest of all time. It is also known in football folk law for a closing passage of play where Swans defender, Leo Barry, took a mark in the back pocket to deny the Eagles one last opportunity to score. This moment was made famous by Stephen Quartermain's call of \"Leo Barry you star\".\nThe following year, the Swans made the Grand Final again in a rematch against the 2005 runner ups, the Eagles. In another close game, the Swans lost by only 1 point in another close match.\nIn 2011, Paul Roos, the coach of the 2005 and 2006 Grand Final squad resigned, with John Longmire being appointed as head coach. The following year, the Sydney Swans won another Grand Final, beating the Hawthorn Hawks by 10 points in another classic Grand Final.\nGrand Final losing streak\n2014: Loss to the Hawks\nAfter beating the Hawks, the Swans looked to remain competitive and capitalise on their success. After finishing 4th in 2013 and losing in a preliminary final to the Fremantle Dockers, the Swans signed Lance \"Buddy\" Franklin to a 9-year, $10 million deal. The Swans concluded the season winning the minor premiership with a record of 17-5. After winning a qualifying final against Fremantle, and then beating North Melbourne convincingly by 71 points, the Swans were set to face off against the Hawks again in a rematch of the 2012 Grand Final.\nGoing into the Grand Final, experts were split on the outcome of the game, with neither side being clear favourites. Despite this, Sydney were considered favourites, with the game expected to be a close match. This never came to be, as the Hawks beat the Swans by 63-points. The game was considered over at halftime, as the Swans trailed by 42, before falling behind even further to be trailing by 54 at 3 quarter time.\n2016: loss to the Bulldogs\nFollowing the lopsided 2014 Grand Final, the Swans returned to finals, finishing 4th but were eliminated in straight sets by the Dockers and Kangaroos respectively.\nIn 2016, the Swans had a bounce back season, winning another minor premiership in a season that saw the Swans finish outside the top 4 only once. Despite losing the Qualifying Final against cross-town rivals, the GWS Giants, the Swans won convincingly against the Crows and Cats to qualify for their 5th grand final since 2000.\nHeading into the Grand Final, the Sydney Swans were heavily favoured. This was due to a number of factors surrounding the Western Bulldogs. The Bulldogs has finished 7th, and had gone on a fairytale run to make their first grand final since 1961. Further, key injuries left the Bulldogs depleted, including captain Robert Murphy.\nDespite being clear favourites, the Bulldogs shocked the AFL world beating the Swans 22 points en route to their second ever premiership. They also became the first team to win the premiership from outside the top 4 since the introduction of the AFL's top 4 system. Additionally, the Bulldogs also became the first team since the 1997 Crows to win 4 games in a final series. This marked the Swans 2nd consecutive Grand Final loss, and their 12th Grand Final loss overall.\n2022: loss to the Cats\nFor the first time since 2006, the Swans entered the 2022 Grand Final not as the favourites, with the Cats entering the Grand Final on the back of a 15 game win streak. Head-to-head odds through bets saw the Cats with a $1.47 advantage to the Swans $2.70.\nThe Swans failed to capture a lead at any point during the game, and by quarter time were trailing by 35 points. The Swans would ultimately lose by 81 points, and would tie with the 1980 Magpies as the 5th largest losing margin in an AFL/VFL Grand Final.\n2024: loss to the Lions\nin the 2023 season, the Swans finished 8th and lost to Carlton in an elimination final. Following this, the Swans bounced back in 2024 finishing 17-6, and did not drop top spot on the ladder after finishing top of the ladder in round 8, and included a ten game win streak between round 4 to 15. Other than a 112 point loss to Port Adelaide in round 21, the Swans were definitive favourites throughout the year.\nTheir finals run included a come-from-behind victory against the Giants in the qualifying final, and a definitive victory against Port Adelaide in the preliminary final.\nDespite being favourites going into the Grand Final, Sydney again failed to deliver on the big stage. Other than a close 1st quarter, the Brisbane Lions went on a run to win by 60 points. This loss would be their 4th in a row, and 14th all-time. This would drop their Grand Final winning percentage to 26.3%, the second worst in the AFL behind St Kilda, with 14.3%. This Grand Final would also mark the second time that a team from outside the top 4 would win the premiership, with the other team being the Western Bulldogs in 2016.\nAfter the Grand Final, John Longmire would step down as head coach, with Dean Cox being named as head coach from 2025 onwards. Coincidentally, Cox faced the Swans in both the 2005 and 2006 Grand Finals as a member of the West Coast Eagles.\nGrand Final results\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=text-align:center\n| bgcolor=C0FFC0 style=width:3em | || align=left | Won grand final\n|-\n| bgcolor=FFFFC0 style=width:3em | || align=left | Lost grand final\n|-\n| \"\"Italic\" | Italic || align=left | Playing as South Melbourne Swans\n|-\n| \"\"Bold\" | Bold || align=left | Won minor premiership\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!Season\n!Swans Score\n!Opponent\n!Opponent Score\n!Result\n!Premiership #\n|- style=background:#FFFFC0\n|1899\n|3.8 (26)\n|Fitzroy\n|3.9.27\n|Swans lose by 1 point\n|\n|- style=background:#FFFFC0\n|1907\n|6.9 (45)\n|Carlton\n|6.14.50\n|Swans lose by 5 points\n|\n|- style=background:#C0C0FF\n|1909\n|4.14 (38)\n|Carlton\n|4.12 (36)\n|Swans won by 2 points\n|1\n|- style=background:#FFFFC0\n|1912\n|4.9 (33)\n|Essendon\n|5.17 (47)\n|Swans lose by 14 points\n|\n|- style=background:#FFFFC0\n|1914\n|4.15 (39)\n|Carlton\n|6.9 (45)\n|Swans lose by 6 points\n|\n|- style=background:#C0C0FF\n|1918\n|9.8 (62)\n|Collingwood\n|7.15 (57)\n|Swans won by 5 points\n|2\n|- style=background:#C0C0FF\n|1933\n|9.17 (71)\n|Richmond\n|4.5 (29)\n|Swans won by 42 points\n|3\n|- style=background:#FFFFC0\n|1934\n|12.17 (89)\n|Richmond\n|19.14 (128)\n|Swans lost by 39 points\n|\n|- style=background:#FFFFC0\n|1935\n|7.16 (58)\n|Collingwood\n|11.12 (78)\n|Swans lost by 20 points\n|\n|- style=background:#FFFFC0\n|1936\n|10.18 (78)\n|Collingwood\n|11.23 (89)\n|Swans lost by 11 points\n|\n|- style=background:#FFFFC0\n|1945\n|10.15 (75)\n|Carlton\n|15.13 (103)\n|Swans lost by 28 points\n|\n|- style=background:#FFFFC0\n|1996\n|13.10 (88)\n|North Melbourne\n|19.17 (131)\n|Swans lost by 43 points\n|\n|- style=background:#C0C0FF\n|2005\n|8.10 (58)\n|West Coast\n|7.12 (54)\n|Swans won by 4 points\n|4\n|- style=background:#FFFFC0\n|2006\n|12.12 (84)\n|West Coast\n|12.13 (85)\n|Swans lost by 1 point\n|\n|- style=background:#C0C0FF\n|2012\n|14.7 (91)\n|Hawthorn\n|11.15 (81)\n|Swans won by 10 points\n|5\n|- style=background:#FFFFC0\n|2014\n|11.8 (74)\n|Hawthorn\n|21.11 (137)\n|Swans lose by 63 points\n|\n|- style=background:#FFFFC0\n|2016\n|10.7 (67)\n|Western Bulldogs\n|13.11 (89)\n|Swans lose by 22 points\n|\n|- style=background:#FFFFC0\n|2022\n|8.4 (52)\n|Geelong\n|20.13 (133)\n|Swans lost by 81 points\n|\n|- style=background:#FFFFC0\n|2024\n|9.6 (60)\n|Brisbane\n|18.12 (120)\n|Swans lost by 60 points\n|\n|}\nReferences"
