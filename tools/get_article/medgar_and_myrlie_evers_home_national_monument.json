Built in 1956, it was the home of African American civil rights activist Medgar Evers (1925–1963) at the time of his assassination. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2017. The John D. Dingell Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, signed March 12, 2019, by President Donald Trump, authorized it as a national monument; it was established on December 10, 2020, after the National Park Service (NPS) acquired it from Tougaloo College.\nDescription and history\nThe house stands in northern Jackson, in what is called the Elraine Subdivision.  This area was developed as the first planned middle-class subdivision for African-Americans in Mississippi after World War II.  The house is on the north side of Margaret Walker Alexander Drive, a few doors east of its junction with Missouri Street.  It is one of 36 similar single-story ranch-style houses built by Leroy Burnett and Walter J. Thompson.  It is a single-story wood-frame structure, set on a foundation of brick piers.  It has a broad shallow-pitch gabled roof, with a built-up covering of gravel.  The roof has extended eaves with the rafters exposed.  To the left side, the roof extends across a carport which is accessed via the original concrete driveway; the main entrance is under the carport shelter.  Part of the facade is faced in brick veneer, while the rest is finished in asbestos siding.  Interior features include a bullet hole in the wall separating the kitchen and living room.\nThe house was purchased new by Medgar and Myrlie Evers in 1956, and remained their home until 1963.  The Everses were both active civil rights activists, and had for some time been specific targets of racist violence.  They chose this house in part for features that improved its security: it was not on a corner lot, and its entrance under the carport provided better cover than a front door would.  On May 28, 1963, a Molotov cocktail was thrown onto the carport.  On June 11, 1963, Evers attended a meeting of civil rights groups in Jackson to formulate a response to actions taken by George Wallace, then Governor of Alabama, to prevent African-Americans from enrolling at the University of Alabama.  Arriving home around midnight, Evers, standing in the carport, was shot by Byron De La Beckwith, using a sniper rifle, from an undeveloped lot about  away.  The bullet passed through the house's picture window, and through the wall between the living room and kitchen before coming to rest.  Evers died early the next morning.\nMyrlie Evers moved to California in 1964, continuing the civil rights crusade.  She maintained ownership of the house for thirty years, using it as a rental property.  She donated the property to Tougaloo College in 1993.  The house underwent repairs and stabilization in 1995–96, and was restored to the appearance that it had during the Evers residency in 2013.\nSee also\n* List of National Historic Landmarks in Mississippi\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Hinds County, Mississippi\n* Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument\n* Freedom Riders National Monument\n* Civil Rights Memorial, Montgomery, Alabama\n* Civil rights movement in popular culture\n* List of national monuments of the United States\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.nps.gov/memy/index.htm Official National Park Service site]"
