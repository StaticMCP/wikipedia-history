Romaine is banished to Hell by the Spectre, despite Mister Terrific (Terry Sloane) insisting that the families of Romaine's victims deserve to see him stand trial.\nNow trapped in Hell, Romaine makes a deal with the demon Shaitan, gaining the power to possess the bodies of others in exchange for giving Shaitan the chance to confront the Spectre. Returning to Earth shortly before a meeting between the Justice Society of America (JSA) and the Justice League, the Spirit King possesses the Flash (Jay Garrick) and uses him to kill Mister Terrific. However, the spirit of Mister Terrific returns and disrupts the connection between the Spirit King and Shaitan, banishing the Spirit King to Hell once again.\nYears later, the Justice Society investigate a spree of violence in Portsmouth, one of the victims being a friend of Doctor Mid-Nite. While Mid-Nite and the new Mister Terrific (Michael Holt) debate religion in a church, they are visited by Hal Jordan, the current Spectre, who reveals that his attempts to turn the Spectre's mission to one of redemption as opposed to one of vengeance had weakened the Spectre's hold on the spirits he had once damned. As a result, the condemned souls escape, with the Spirit King leading them against the JSA. As the JSA try to hold their own against the undead army, the Spirit King once again possesses the Flash, using him to attack Sentinel and seriously injure Mister Terrific. However, Jordan banishes the Spirit King and his army back to Hell.\nReferences\nSee also\n*List of Justice League enemies"
