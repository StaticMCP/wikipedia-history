He worked as a builder and spent a night in prayer before making the decision to join The Salvation Army. After a short period spent at the Whitechapel Corps, he was appointed to the work of officer training.\nIn 1884, he was transferred to Australia, where he was instrumental in expanding the work of the Army, and was the first Commander of The Salvation Army Australia Southern Territory, from 1886 to 1889. Later appointments included British Commissioner, International Training Commissioner and Foreign Secretary at the International Headquarters in London.\nHoward was appointed The Salvation Army's Second Chief of Staff by General Bramwell Booth in 1912, a post he held until his retirement from active service in 1919. In 1920, he was awarded the Order of the Founder, the Salvation Army's most prestigious award. Commissioner Howard died in Margate in Kent in 1923.\n]]\nTwo of the children he had with his wife Martha (1847-1937) died young. His son John Howard married Florence Annie Lawley, the daughter of Commissioner John Lawley.\nHe died on July 1, 1923. Like many prominent Salvationists, T. Henry Howard is buried in Abney Park Cemetery.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D0DE1D6133EE233A25756C0A9669D946997D6CF Howard] in The New York Times October 5, 1908, Retrieved on 2008-10-31\n*\n*\n* [http://www.sacollectables.com/officers.html Howard on Salvation Army Collectables]"
