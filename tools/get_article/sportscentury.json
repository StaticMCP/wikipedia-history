The episodes for the top two athletes, Michael Jordan and Babe Ruth, appeared on a special combined edition broadcast on Christmas Day on ABC. The top two names were announced in no particular order, and the final positioning was announced at the conclusion of the two episodes. An additional list of numbers 51–100 were announced on the ESPN SportsCentury website. Themed specials such as Greatest Games, Greatest Coaches, Greatest Dynasties, and Most Influential Individuals were premiered throughout the year, as well as six SportsCenter of the Decade programs.\nAfter the initial run was complete, the episodes were rerun at various times on ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPN Classic. The original plan for the series was to expand to include #51 through #100. Ultimately, the series featured just over half of the athletes from #51 to #100, and instead expanded to include over 150 other athletes, coaches, owners, personalities, and notable moments in sports history. Acknowledgements were given to athletes that were notable for more recent accomplishments, even if they spent only a small part of their career in the 20th century (e.g., Tiger Woods, Tom Brady), or were recently deceased (e.g. Pat Tillman, Dale Earnhardt). Special subsets of episodes were created revolving around a particular event, including athletes associated with the particular sport. They would typically air in the days leading up to those events. (e.g., Winter Olympics, golf majors, Indianapolis 500, etc.)\nESPN Classic began to feature the program, with host Chris Fowler, as the highlight of its weeknight prime-time programing, airing five nights a week. After cycling through the entire series several times, and after debuting several new episodes, it was removed as a nightly program.  , reruns of the documentary series airs Monday through Friday at 4 p.m. Eastern time.  The last original program was that of Shaquille O'Neal, which aired in November 2007.\nControversy\nThe final order of choices led to debate, some of which came from the SportsCentury camp.  Bob Costas, one of the series' voters, said, \"I had Babe Ruth as my number one, but I think the list they came up with was a good one. Everybody more or less deserved to be there.\"  ESPN writer Bud Morgan conceded that the Secretariat pick \"was kind of controversial because a lot of people took the attitude 'What is a four-legged animal doing on this list?'\"\nTony Kornheiser, whose ballot was topped by Ruth, Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan, said, \"I can't conceive of how Ruth didn't finish number one.  He had the greatest impact of anybody on a sport by far... Michael Jordan didn't have as many championships as Bill Russell and didn't score as many points as Wilt Chamberlain, and really didn't do anything to advance his sport, so maybe in retrospect I upgraded him a bit too much because the way he performed was so spectacular, and because of television I got to see highlights.  They may have overpersuaded a lot of us... Did Jim Thorpe get the praise he deserved?  Probably not, because there weren't enough people old enough to really remember him.\"\nESPN anchor Charley Steiner said \"I think picking [Jordan] number one was a generational decision, not a historical one.  Babe Ruth deserved it more.\"\nDon King lawsuit\nIn 2005, Don King and his promotional company, Don King Productions, Inc. filed a $2.5 billion defamation suit against the Walt Disney Company, the current owners of ESPN and ABC Cable Networks Group, and Advocate Communications, after a documentary alleged that King had \"killed, not once, but twice\", threatened to break Larry Holmes' legs, had a hospital invest into a film that was never made, cheated Meldrick Taylor out of $1 million, and then threatened to have Taylor killed. Though the documentary repeated many claims that were already made, King said he had now had enough. King's attorney said \"It was slanted to show Don in the worst way. It was one-sided from day one, Don is a strong man, but he has been hurt by this.\"\nThe case was dismissed on summary judgment with a finding that King could not show \"actual malice\" from the defendants, and that King had failed to prove that any of the challenged statements were false. The judgement also pointed out that the studio had tried on a number of occasions to interview King for the documentary, but he had declined; while not suggesting that King had a legal obligation to do so, the court sympathized with ESPN's circumstances on those grounds. King appealed the decision and, 3 years later, the Second District Court of Appeals upheld the summary judgement, but disagreed with the original finding that none of the statements were false. In any case, Judge Dorian Damoorgian ruled, \"Nothing in the record shows that ESPN purposefully made false statements about King in order to bolster the theme of the program or to inflict harm on King\".\nRecognition\nSportsCentury won a Peabody Award in 1999 \"for overall excellence in sports broadcasting.\"\nSportsCentury: Top 50 American Athletes of the 20th Century (Original series)\nwas voted No. 2]]\nwas voted No. 3]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
