It was then jointly administered by the Diocese of Lichfield and Staffordshire County Council. A new school building was also constructed. In April 2021 the school converted to academy status and was renamed The King's Church of England Academy. The school is now a founding member of \tThree Spires Trust.\nThe King's Church of England Academy offers GCSEs, BTECs, OCR Nationals and NVQs as programmes of study for pupils, while students in the sixth form have the option to study from a range of A-levels, further BTECs and NVQs.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.thekings.staffs.sch.uk/ The King's Church of England Academy official website]"
