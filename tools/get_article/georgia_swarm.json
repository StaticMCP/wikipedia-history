They have been playing at the 13,000-seat Gas South Arena since their 2016 season.\nTeam history\nOriginally formed as the 2002 expansion Montreal Express, the owners of the Minnesota Swarm purchased the inactive Express franchise from the NLL to create the Swarm in 2004. They played at the Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul, Minnesota from 2004 until 2015. On May 22, 2015, team owner John Arlotta announced that the Xcel Energy Center did not renew the contract for the team. Instead of negotiating for a new lease, the Swarm began looking for potential relocation sites and eventually chose the Atlanta metro area.\nIn 2017 the Swarm won the NLL championship title against the defending Saskatchewan Rush 2–0 in a best of three series.\nCurrent roster\nHead coaching history\nNote: This list does not include coaches from the Minnesota Swarm.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | #\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Name\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Term\n! colspan=\"4\" | Regular Season\n! colspan=\"4\" | Playoffs\n|-\n!
