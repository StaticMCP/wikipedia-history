They are generally finer and sandier, and usually more hard-fired than the earlier and comparable York Glazed Ware.\nForm and decoration\nThe main form produced from Brandsby-type ware is the jug (or baluster jug), but cooking pots, bowls and condiment dishes also feature. Initially the forms are very similar to York Glazed Ware, but the ware later develops its own unique decorative style including rouletting or roller-stamping, combed wavy lines, or plain incised lines.\nSee also\n*History of Yorkshire\n*Medieval York\n*York Glazed Ware\n*Humber ware\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/641326 Brandsby Ware jug handlge fragment on the Portable Antiquities Scheme Database]\n*[http://www.yorkmuseumstrust.org.uk/collections/search/item/?id=178&search_query=bGltaXQ9MTYmc2VhcmNoX3RleHQ9YnJBTkRTQlkmR3MlNUJvcGVyYXRvciU1RD0lM0UlM0QmR3MlNUJ2YWx1ZSU1RD0mR2UlNUJvcGVyYXRvciU1RD0lM0MlM0QmR2UlNUJ2YWx1ZSU1RD0mRk49 Brandsby Ware jug in the Yorkshire Museum]"
