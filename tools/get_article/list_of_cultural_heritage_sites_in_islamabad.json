Relics and human skulls have been found dating back to 5000 BC that show this region was home to Neolithic people who settled on the banks of the Soan River, and developed small communities in the region at around 3000 BC. Islamabad's cultural heritage includes various archaeological sites, government buildings, shrines, stupas, landmarks, and national monuments.\nAccording to one survey by Quaid-i-Azam University in 2010, there are around 450 heritage sites in the capital territory and the adjoining Rawalpindi District. The Capital Development Authority formed a committee in 2011 to locate and preserve 150 of these historical and archaeological sites.\nFollowing is an incomplete list of the cultural heritage sites in Islamabad Capital Territory.\nnortheast of the Diplomatic Enclave\n| district = Islamabad Capital Territory\n| lat = 33.7453\n| lon = 73.1112\n| commonscat = Shrine of Bari Imam\n| image = Bari Imam.jpg\n}}\n| district = Islamabad\n| lat = 33.6862\n| lon = 73.0765\n| commonscat = Pakistan Museum of Natural History Islamabad\n| image =Pakistan Museum of Natural History.JPG\n}}\n| district = Islamabad city\n| lat = 33.7319\n| lon = 73.0957\n| commonscat = Parliament House, Islamabad\n| image = Pakistani parliament house.jpg\n}}\n| district = Islamabad Capital Territory\n| lat =\n| lon =\n| commonscat = Shah Allah Ditta caves\n| image = Sadhu da Bagh.jpg\n}}\n| district = Islamabad Capital Territory\n| lat =\n| lon =\n| commonscat = Jira rock shelters\n| image = Jira rock shelters.jpg\n}}\n| district = Islamabad Capital Territory\n| lat =\n| lon =\n| commonscat = Sain cup marks\n| image =\n}}\n|}\nReferences"
