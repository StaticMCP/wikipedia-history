It featured eight teams playing in a round-robin group stage, followed by a Finals Day. It ran alongside the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy, as well as featuring double-header matches with the men's T20 Blast. Southern Vipers, who were the defending champions, won the tournament, beating The Blaze in the final.\nFormat\nTeams played each other once in a group of eight, with the top three qualifying for the knock-out stage. This represented an addition of one match per team from the previous season, which saw teams divided into two groups of four. The top three teams in the group advanced to Finals Day, which was played at New Road, Worcester, with the top-placed team advancing directly to the final and the other two teams playing in the semi-final. 20 group stage matches were played as double-headers with matches from the men's T20 Blast.\nTeams\nThe teams were as listed below. The Blaze changed their name prior to the 2023 season, having previously been known as Lightning.\n* Central Sparks (representing Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Herefordshire, Shropshire and Staffordshire)\n* Northern Diamonds (representing Yorkshire, Durham and Northumberland)\n* North West Thunder (representing Lancashire, Cheshire and Cumbria)\n* South East Stars (representing Surrey and Kent)\n* Southern Vipers (representing Hampshire, Sussex, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Dorset, Isle of Wight and Oxfordshire)\n* Sunrisers  (representing Middlesex, Essex, Northamptonshire, Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire, Huntingdonshire, Norfolk and Suffolk)\n* The Blaze (representing Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire)\n* Western Storm (representing Glamorgan, Gloucestershire, Somerset, Cornwall, Devon, Wiltshire and Cricket Wales)\nStandings\nTeams received 4 points for a win.
