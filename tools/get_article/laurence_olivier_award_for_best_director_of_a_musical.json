The awards were established as the Society of West End Theatre Awards in 1976, and renamed in 1984 in honour of English actor and director Laurence Olivier.\nThis award was introduced in 1991, along with Best Director of a Play, when the original (and singular) Best Director award was divided. The new pair of awards were last presented in 1995, after which the original Best Director award returned to the roster of Olivier Awards.\nWinners and nominees\n1990s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#bebebe;\"\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:30%;\"| Director\n! style=\"width:60%;\"| Production\n|-\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\"| 1991\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE\"\n| Richard Jones\n| Into the Woods\n|-\n| Charles Augins\n| Five Guys Named Moe\n|-\n| Ian Judge\n| Show Boat\n|-\n| Steven Pimlott\n| Sunday in the Park with George\n|-\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\"| 1992\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE\"\n| Simon Callow\n| Carmen Jones\n|-\n| Judi Dench\n| The Boys from Syracuse\n|-\n| Ken Hill\n| The Phantom of the Opera\n|-\n| Steven Pimlott\n| Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\n|-\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\"| 1993\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE\"\n| Nicholas Hytner\n| Carousel\n|-\n| Sam Mendes\n| Assassins\n|-\n| Mike Ockrent\n| Crazy for You\n|-\n| Harold Prince\n| Kiss of the Spider Woman\n|-\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\"| 1994\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE\"\n| Declan Donnellan\n| Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\n|-\n| Michael Blakemore\n| City of Angels\n|-\n| John Caird\n| ''The Beggar's Opera\n|-\n| Sam Mendes\n| Cabaret\n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"| 1995\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE\"\n| Scott Ellis\n| She Loves Me\n|-\n| Sam Mendes\n| Oliver!\n|-\n| David Toguri and Gwenda Hughes\n| Once on This Island''\n|}\nSee also\n* Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Director of a Musical\n* Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*"
