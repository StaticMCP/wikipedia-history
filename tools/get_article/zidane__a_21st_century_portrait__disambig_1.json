During the last minutes of the match, Zidane was sent off as a result of a brawl.\nThe film bears a similarity to Football As Never Before (aka \"Fußball wie noch nie\"), a documentary made in 1970 by acclaimed German filmmaker Hellmuth Costard about Manchester United footballer George Best. In the experimental film Costard used eight 16mm film cameras to follow Best, in real time, for the course of an entire game against Coventry City. These films also inspired Spike Lee's 2009 documentary ''Kobe Doin' Work.\nThe film was featured at the 2006 Edinburgh International Film Festival.\nSoundtrack\nScottish post-rock band Mogwai provided the soundtrack to the film, at the request of Douglas Gordon. After seeing some footage of the film with a remix of \"Mogwai Fear Satan\" playing in the background, they agreed to do it.\nSee also\n* List of association football films\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.goethe.de/ges/spr/prj/tor/film/fpw/dok/en827345.htm Football As Never Before]'' at the Goethe-Institut\n* [http://www.dvd.reviewer.co.uk/reviews/review.asp?Index=5632&User=10889 UK release review by Brian Elliott of DVD Reviewer]\n* [http://www.soccer-spain.com/ssdocs/reports2004/div1/day33/report7.html Match Recap at Soccer Spain]\n* [http://nplusonemag.com/football-as-before N+1 Review of the film]"
