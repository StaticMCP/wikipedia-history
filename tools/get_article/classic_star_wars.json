Watson comments that \"This is very weak indeed. The Star Wars'' concept deserves much better treatment than this basic pulp and clearly does not work in this format.\" Conversely, internet reviewer John Hansen says, \"The Goodwin/Williamson strips are all about the childhood wonder brought out by the original trilogy and fans' memories of seeing the films for the first time.\"\nSee also\n* ''Splinter of the Mind's Eye''\nReferences\nFootnotes\nCitations"
