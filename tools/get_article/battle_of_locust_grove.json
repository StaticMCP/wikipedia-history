About 250 Union troops commanded by Colonel William Weer, surprised approximately 300 Confederate troops commanded by Colonel James J. Clarkson, who were encamped near Pipe Springs. The Confederates, unable to form a battle line, were quickly dispersed into a thicket of locust trees.  The skirmish resulted in about 100 Confederate soldiers dead and about 100 wounded or captured. Their commander was one of the prisoners. The Union claimed that its losses were three killed and six wounded. The Union troops also captured most of the Confederate supplies, including 60 wagons, 64 mule teams and a large quantity of other supplies. A number of Confederate troops escaped capture and took off for Tahlequah and Park Hill.\nWeer and his men spent the Fourth of July at the battle site dividing the captured clothing among the victorious soldiers and apportioning all other captured supplies among the various units. After breaking camp, Weer and his men proceeded to Flat Rock, about  from Fort Gibson, which was then held by the Confederates.\nThe site of the battle is East of the present-day town of Locust Grove, Oklahoma. There is a commemorative marker on Scenic Route 412 in Pipe Springs Park, at coordinates 36° 11.889′ N, 95° 8.998′ W. The inscription reads:\n“Federal troops suddenly attacked a Confederate camp along the ridge near here at dawn, July 2, 1862. The surprised Confederates hardly returned fire before their officers and heavy supplies were captured. Yet, hot fighting in the woods lasted nearly all day.”\nOn April 8, 1864 Weer was arrested for misappropriation of prisoner funds, drunkenness and neglect of duty. He was convicted following a court martial and cashiered from the army on August 20, 1864.\nNotes\nReferences"
