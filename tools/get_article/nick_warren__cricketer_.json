He was a right-handed batsman and his bowling style was right arm fast-medium. He was born in Moseley, Birmingham.\nHe was said to have shown potential in the England Under 17 team against Ireland in 1999, and he went on to tour Malaysia with the Under 19's, and played in the Youth World Cup in Sri Lanka during 1999–2000. While in the England A cricket team, his Youth Test debut came in 2002 against West Indies A.\nHowever, Warren's career appeared to be on the verge of decline when his contract at Warwickshire was ended in 2003. During his fight to keep his place, he missed three months of play due to a stress-fracture of the spine in 2004. However a run of 'impressive performances' earned him a renewal on his contract, in which he played Northamptonshire in the Frizzell County Championship, taking three wickets for one run in ten balls.\nWarren did not hold down his place, however, and did not appear for the first team after the 2005 season.\nNotes\nExternal links\n*"
