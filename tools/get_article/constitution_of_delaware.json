The term of the Governor is for four years, from the third Tuesday in January following the election. A person may be elected Governor only twice. The Governor must be thirty years old, a citizen and inhabitant of the United States for twelve years before the day of the election, and for the last six years of that time an inhabitant of Delaware.\nThe Governor is commander-in-chief of the state armed forces including the militia and, with the consent of the State Senate, appoint the Secretary of State to serve at the pleasure of the Governor.\nLegislation approved by the General Assembly is submitted to the Governor for approval. In the event approval is not given, the legislation is returned to the General Assembly, reconsidered, and may become law without the Governor's approval only if three-fifths of each House of the General Assembly approve it.\nMembers of the Delaware Constitutional Convention of 1897.
