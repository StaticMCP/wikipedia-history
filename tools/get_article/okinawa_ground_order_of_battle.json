This offensive, called Operation Iceberg by its planners, was the final Allied offensive in the Pacific Theater of Operations in World War II.\nThe defending Japanese military was determined to inflict a casualty rate so high that the U.S. government would choose not to invade the Japanese home islands. To this end, the southern portion of Okinawa had been covered with the most extensive system of fortifications and interlocking fields of fire the Americans had yet encountered in the Pacific Theatre. In anticipation of this level of resistance, five full divisions, two Marine and three Army, were committed to the struggle.\nThe initial American landings took place on 1 April 1945 and the island was not declared secure until 22 June, a period of 82 days, far longer than was expected by US planners. Four days before the end of the campaign, Lieutenant General Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr. became the highest ranking U.S. military officer to be killed in action in the Second World War.\nSummary of opposing ground forces\nUnited States\nUS Tenth Army\nLieutenant General Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr., USA ()\n:  III Amphibious Corps\n: Major General Roy S.

US progress in the Central Pacific led them to activate the Thirty-Second Army on the island in April 1944. In June, 5,000 men of the 44th Independent Mixed Brigade were lost at sea when their transport was torpedoed by a US submarine. The 9th Division, a veteran unit, was intended for Okinawa but was stranded on Formosa when the high command decided it couldn't risk more slow-moving transports in the East China Sea. The unprecedented American casualty figures would almost certainly have been considerably higher had these men made it to Okinawa.\nJapanese Thirty-Second Army\nLieutenant General Mitsuru Ushijima ()\nApprox. 67,000 men under arms, incl. 5,000 Okinawan conscripts\n: 24th Division\n: 62nd Division\n: 44th Independent Mixed Brigade\nAmerican forces\nUS Tenth Army\nLieutenant General Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr., USA ()\nMajor General Roy S.
