According to the publisher, the series \"deals with the interaction of British and non-western societies from the Elizabethan era to the late twentieth century, aiming to provide a balanced treatment of the ruled as well as the rulers, and to take into account the significance of the Empire for the peoples of the British Isles\". The editor-in-chief for the main series was Wm. Roger Louis.\nIn addition to the principal five volumes, the Oxford History of the British Empire also includes a spin-off \"Companion Series\" which \"pursue themes that could not be covered adequately in the main series\". 16 volumes have been published in the series since 2004.\nVolumes\nThe Main Series\nThe Oxford History of the British Empire comprises five edited volumes, tracing the history of the British Empire in a chronological manner:\n*Volume I: The Origins of Empire: British Overseas Enterprise to the Close of the Seventeenth Century. 1998.

Saul Dubow in H-Net noted the uneven quality of the chapters in volume III and also the difficulty of such an endeavour given the state of historiography of the British Empire and the impossibility of maintaining a triumphalist tone in the modern era. Dubow also felt that some of the authors had tended \"to 'play safe', awed perhaps by the monumental nature of the enterprise\".\nMadhavi Kale of Bryn Mawr College, writing in Social History, also felt that the history took a traditional approach to the historiography of the empire and placed the English, and to a lesser extent the Scottish, Irish and Welsh at the centre of the account, rather than the subject peoples of the empire. Kale summed up her review of volumes III–V of the history by saying it represented \"a disturbingly revisionist project that seeks to neutralize ... the massive political and military brutality and repression\" of the empire.\nSee also\n*Historiography of the British Empire\nReferences"
