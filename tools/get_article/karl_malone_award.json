      "text": "# Karl Malone Award\n\n}}\nThe Karl Malone Power Forward of the Year Award is an annual basketball award given by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame to the top men's collegiate power forward. Following the success of the Bob Cousy Award which had been awarded since 2004, the award was one of four new awards (along with the Jerry West Award, Julius Erving Award, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award) created as part of the inaugural College Basketball Awards show in 2015. It is named after Karl Malone, a Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee who played the position. The inaugural winner was Montrezl Harrell of Louisville.\nKey\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Awarded a national player of the year award: Sporting News; Oscar Robertson Trophy; Associated Press; NABC; Naismith; Wooden\n|-\n| Player (X)\n| Denotes the number of times the player has been awarded the Karl Malone Award at that point\n|}\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
