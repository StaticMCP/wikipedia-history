Scotland was allocated 72 seats in total, with 70 territorial seats, comprising 32 burgh constituencies and 37 county constituencies. There were also two university constituencies, Glasgow and Aberdeen Universities and Edinburgh and St Andrews Universities. As voters in university constituencies voted in addition to their territorial vote, the results are compiled separately.\nWilliam Gladstone had led the Liberals to power three years earlier, however following his retirement in 1894 the Earl of Rosebery had been appointed as prime minister. Rosebery's government found itself largely in a state of paralysis due to a power struggle between him and William Harcourt, the Liberal leader in the Commons. The situation came to a head on 21 June 1895, when Parliament voted to dismiss Secretary of State for War Henry Campbell-Bannerman; Rosebery, realising that the government would likely not survive a motion of no confidence were one to be brought, promptly resigned as prime minister. Conservative leader Lord Salisbury was subsequently re-appointed for a third spell as prime minister, and promptly called a new election. Although the Liberals won a majority of the seats in Scotland, they suffered large losses, and when combined with results from across the United Kingdom the Conservatives/Liberal Unionist alliance achieved a parliamentary majority of 153 for Lord Salisbury.\nThe Independent Labour Party, having only previously existed as a loose grouping of left-wing politicians, formally organised into a party led by Keir Hardie in 1893 and contested their first election.\nResults\nSeats summary\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"width:200px\" colspan=3 | Party\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Seats\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Last Election\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Seats change\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFD700\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=2 | Liberal\n| align=center| 39\n| align=center| 51\n| align=center|  12\n|-\n| rowspan=3 | &nbsp;\n| colspan=2 | Conservative and Liberal Unionist (Total)\n| align=center| 33\n| align=center| 21\n| align=center|  12\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#2061a2\" | &nbsp;\n|Liberal Unionist\n| align=\"center\" | 14\n| align=center| 11\n| align=center|  3\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#0087dc\" | &nbsp;\n|Conservative\n| align=\"center\" | 19\n| align=center| 10\n| align=center|  9\n|-\n| colspan=3 | Total\n| align=center| 72\n| align=center| 72\n| align=center|\n|}\nBurgh & County constituencies\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"width:100px\" colspan=2 | Party\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Seats\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Seats change\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Votes\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| %\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| % Change\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#FFD700\"|\n| Liberal\n| align=center|39\n| align=center|  12\n| align=center| 236,446\n| align=center|51.7\n| align=center|  2.2\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#0281AA\"|\n| Conservative & Liberal Unionist\n| align=center| 31\n| align=center|  12\n| align=center| 214,403\n| align=center| 47.4\n| align=center|  3.0\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#B22222\" | &nbsp;\n| Independent Labour Party\n| align=\"center\" | 0\n| align=\"center\" |\n| align=\"center\" | 4,269\n| align=\"center\" | 0.8\n| align=\"center\" |  0.8\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| Others\n| align=\"center\" | 0\n| align=\"center\" |\n| align=\"center\" | 608\n| align=\"center\" | 0.1\n| align=\"center\" |\n|-\n| colspan=2 | Total\n| align=center| 70\n| align=center|\n| align=center| 455,726\n| align=center| 100.0\n| align=center|\n|}\nUniversity constituencies\nThe two university constituencies each elected an additional member to the house.
