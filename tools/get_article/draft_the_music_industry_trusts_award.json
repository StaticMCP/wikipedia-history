Alongside the more public-facing BRIT Awards, The MITS Award is a major funder of The BRIT Trust and its beneficiary The BRIT School.\nHistory\nOriginally known as the ‘British Music Industry Award’, the committee was established in 1992 by Michael Levy as a joint venture for fundraising between The BRIT Trust and Nordoff & Robbins. The first gala dinner event honoured John Deacon, Director General of the British Phonographic Industry. Since then, it has raised over £7m for its charities.\nRecipients\nRecipients of The MITS Award are widely recognised for making an outstanding contribution towards the global success of the UK music industry, alongside their notable philanthropic efforts.\nThe MITS Award’s list of recipients represents a broad spectrum of influential people from across different sectors of the industry. It has been awarded to popular artists such as Kylie Minogue and producers such as Sir George Martin, as well as record company executives like Ahmet Ertegun and Rob Dickins. Other figures in the wider entertainment industry have also been recognised, such as broadcasters Jonathan Ross and Sir Michael Parkinson, for the platform and promotion they have provided to musicians.\nWhile the MITS Award is most often awarded to an individual, creative and business partnerships have also been recognised together, such as Elton John and Bernie Taupin, and Richard Griffiths and Harry Magee of Modest!
