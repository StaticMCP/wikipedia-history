      "text": "# Inkster Award\n\nThe Inkster Award is an annual award recognizing the highest ranked women's collegiate golfer in her final year of NCAA eligibility. The award is presented by the Women's Golf Coaches Association (WGCA).\nThe award is meant to shine a light on an NCAA senior who commits a full college career to her team, and is named after Juli Inkster, a World Golf Hall of Fame member who was a three-time All-American while at San Jose State University from 1979 to 1982. Inkster waited to turn professional until finishing her four-year commitment to her school, collecting 17 individual titles during her college career.\nIn 2025, the Division I Inkster Award winner received $50,000 and sponsor invitations to the Meijer LPGA Classic and the Portland Classic, plus a two-day mentorship retreat with Juli Inkster, and automatic advance to the second stage of LPGA Q-School.\nRecipients\nDivision I\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
