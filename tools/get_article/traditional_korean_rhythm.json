There is a basic format, but there are many variations while playing the songs. Korean traditional music is usually sung within the Jangdan, played by the Janggu or hourglass drum. This accompaniment is called 'hitting the Jangdan'. But in music mainly composed by percussion instruments like Korean traditional folk music, it is called 'hitting the steel' or 'hitting the Pungmul (풍물)' which is Korean traditional folk music. Jangdan can be categorized into two groups: Jeong-Ak (formal music) Jangdan and Min-Sok-Ak (traditional folk music) Jangdan.\nHow to read Jangdan\nJangdan are represented visually via rhythmic scores referred to as \"Akbo\" or \"Karakbo\". Most Karakbo are geared towards representing the beats the janggu plays. Janggu have two distinct drum sticks, the yeolchae and gungchae. The yeolchae is played on the higher-pitched drum head whereas the gungchae is played on the lower-pitched drum head. Which side the yeolchae is played depends on the preference of the player, but the dominant hand is used.\nWhen playing janggu as an accompaniment to Pansori, usually only the yeolchae is used (the hand that plays the gungchae is kept empty and may tap or mute the lower-pitched drum head instead). and nothing on the left. However, while playing outdoor music such as P'ungmul or SamulNori, people use the gung chae with their left (non dominant) hand. Also, it is general to hit the middle of the drum head, but exceptionally, a corner of the drum head with a small volume is used while playing solo or indoor music.\nJeong-Ak (Formal music) Jangdan\nJangdan, used in Jeong-Ak, is usually played by Janggu. It is often used in Jangdan in Young-San-Hoe-Sang(靈山會相). Also, Jangdan's music for national ceremonies is an example. There are many combinations of rhythms in slow Jeong-Ak Jangdan, many Doduri in normal speed Jangdan, and many Ta-ryoung in fast Jangdan.\nSang-Young-San Jangdan\nSang-Young-San Jangdan has a very slow 10-beat tempo. If one beat is considered a half note, the Jangdan is a 10/2 beat tempo, and if considered a quarter note, the Jangdan is a 10/8+8+8 beat tempo. Sometimes it is considered a 20-beat tempo for very slow music. The Sang-Young-San Jangdan is used in the first and middle part of the Young-San-Hoe-Sang(靈山會相), 1~3 chapter of Yeo-Min-Rak(與民樂), 1~4 chapter of Bo-Heo-Sa/Bo-Heo-Ja(步虛子).\nSe-Ryoung-San Jangdan\nSe-Ryoung-San Jangdan is a 10-beat tempo, similar to Sang-Young-San Jangdan but a bit faster, so it has many variations. It is used in Se-Young-San in Young-San-Hoe-Sang, Ga-Rak-Deo-Ri, 4~7 chapter of Yeo-Min-Rak, and 5~7 chapters of Bo-Heo-Sa/Bo-Heo-Ja(步虛子).\nDoduri Jangdan\nDoduri Jangdan is the most used Jangdan in Jeong-Ak (formal music), with a 6-beat tempo in normal speed.
