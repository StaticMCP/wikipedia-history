      "text": "# 2026 Estonian presidential election\n\nAn indirect election is expected to take place in Estonia in 2026 to elect the president of Estonia, who will be the country's head of state.\nProcess\nBy law, the president of Estonia is indirectly elected. The Riigikogu has the task of electing the president in the first instance. If no candidate receives the required supermajority of two-thirds (68 votes out of 101), the president is selected by an electoral college consisting of MPs and representatives of local (municipal) governments. If the electoral college fails to achieve a supermajority as well, the process is to return to the parliament yet again.\nThe incumbent Alar Karis has served one term and is eligible to be elected to a second consecutive term in office.\nCandidates\nIndividuals must be nominated by one-fifth of the members of Riigikogu (21 MPs) in order to officially stand as candidates.\nUnlikely to run\nThe following individual is eligible, and has not outright declined his nomination, but considers it unlikely.\n* Alar Karis, incumbent President of Estonia (since 2021)\nNotes\nReferences"
