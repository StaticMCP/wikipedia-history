When the Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio railroad was built through the area in 1876, the stop was named \"Hilda\". In 1900, a local businessman, C. F. Blumberg, built a general store east of the rail stop.

The railroad was not persuaded, but the post office that opened in 1900 was called McQueeney.\nLake McQueeney was created in 1925 by damming the Guadalupe River.
