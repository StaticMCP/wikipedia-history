The announcement was made by the Election Commission of India. Article 67 of the Constitution of India provides that the vice president of India shall remain in office for a period of five years. The winner of this election was Jagdeep Dhankhar, who succeeded Venkaiah Naidu as vice president on 11 August 2022. On 16 July 2022, Jagdeep Dhankhar, the then-serving Governor of West Bengal, was nominated as a vice-presidential candidate by the BJP. On 17 July 2022, Margaret Alva was announced as the vice-presidential candidate by the UO and some non-UO Parties. Hence, Jagdeep Dhankhar won the election with 528 electoral votes, defeating the United Opposition candidate Margaret Alva. It was the vice-presidential election with the largest margin of victory since the 1992.\nElectoral system\nThe Vice President is elected by an electoral college, which includes members of the Rajya Sabha and of the Lok Sabha. The nominated members of the upper house are also eligible to vote in the election process. Voting is done by secret ballot.\nElection schedule\nUnder sub-section (1) of Section (4) of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Act 1952, the schedule for the election of the Vice President of India had been announced by the Election Commission of India on 29 June 2022.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!S.No.\n!Event\n!Date\n!Day\n|-\n!1.\n|Issue of election commission's notification calling the election\n|5 July 2022\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Tuesday\n|-\n!2.\n|Last date for making nominations\n|19 July 2022\n|-\n!3.\n|Date for the scrutiny of nominations\n|20 July 2022\n|Wednesday\n|-\n!4.\n|Last date for the withdrawal of candidatures\n|22 July 2022\n|Friday\n|-\n!5.\n|Date on which a poll shall, if necessary, be taken\n| rowspan=\"2\" |6 August 2022\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Saturday\n|-\n!6.\n|Date on which counting, if required, shall be taken\n|}\nElectoral college\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| House\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n|-\n!NDA\n!UO\n!Others\n|-\n!Lok Sabha\n||background-color=|border border-color=darkgray|width=|per=1}}\n||background-color=|border border-color=darkgray|width=|per=1}}\n||background-color=|border border-color=darkgray|width=|per=1}}\n|-\n!Rajya Sabha\n||background-color=|border border-color=darkgray|width=|per=1}}\n||background-color=|border border-color=darkgray|width=|per=1}}\n||background-color=|border border-color=darkgray|width=|per=1}}\n|-\n!Total\n||background-color=|border border-color=darkgray|width=|per=1}}\n||background-color=|border border-color=darkgray|width=|per=1}}\n||background-color=|border border-color=darkgray|width=|per=1}}\n|}\n* Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly was dissolved and President's rule had been imposed, so the all 4 Rajya Sabha seats of Jammu and Kashmir are vacant.\n* The only Rajya Sabha seat of Tripura was also vacant.\n* 3 nominated member seats in the Rajya Sabha were also vacant.\nCandidates\nNational Democratic Alliance\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
