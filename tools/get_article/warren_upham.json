He married Addie M. Bixby in 1885 and they had a daughter.\nUpham worked as a geologist in New Hampshire before moving in 1879 to Minnesota to study the resources and glacial geology of that state.\nHe worked for the U.S. Geological Survey from 1885 to 1895.  Upham's first major report on Lake Agassiz was published in 1890 by the Geological Survey of Canada, but the main product of his many years of study (\"The Glacial Lake Agassiz\") was published in 1895 as Monograph 25 of the U.S. Geological Survey's monograph series.\nUpham graduated from Dartmouth College in 1871 and worked under Minnesota state geologist Newton H.
