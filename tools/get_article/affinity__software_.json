It is a simultaneously a vector graphics editor, a raster graphics editor and a desktop publishing application.\nIt was first released in 2025 as a successor to Serif's Affinity Designer, Affinity Photo and Affinity Publisher, with the three positioned as direct competitors to Adobe's Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign respectively, it integrates their functionality into a singular application, and switched to a freemium model monetized by AI features exclusive to Canva Pro subscribers.\nFunctionality\nAffinity is divided into a number of workspaces (\"studios\"), which are equivalent to the previous suite of Affinity applications: \"vector\" for vector graphics (Designer), \"pixel\" for raster editing (Photo), and \"layout\" for desktop publishing (Publisher). Additionally, it introduces the ability to create custom workspaces.\nThe application supports real-time previews and non-destructive editing, which are based on GPU acceleration. Supported file formats include Adobe Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator files, PDF, SVG, and TIFF, as well as a custom .af file format.\nVector editing\nRaster editing\nAffinity includes photo editing tools  including adjustments, masks, blend modes, batch processing, and retouching facilities. Additionally, the application can develop RAW files, similar to Adobe Lightroom.\nDesktop publishing\nPublishing features include master pages, text styles, and advanced typography.\nAI features\nThe application supports Canva's existing AI features, such as background removal and generative fill. This requires a Canva subscription.\nDevelopment\nIn September 2025, Serif pulled all existing versions of Affinity Designer, Affinity Photo and Affinity Publisher from sale amid an upcoming announcement on 30 October; ahead of the announcement, the iPadOS versions of the Affinity suite also became free on App Store. During a \"Creative Freedom\" keynote on 30 October 2025, Canva (who acquired Affinity in 2024) released a new version now simply branded as \"Affinity\" (also known as \"Affinity by Canva\") , and referred to internally as version 3.0. Version 3 drops the separate Affinity Photo, Designer and Publisher applications and integrates their functionality into a singular application, and adds the ability to export directly to the Canva platform. It also adds a Canva AI studio, including background removal, \"Expand & Edit\", and generative fill.\nAs of version 3, Affinity has switched to a freemium model; it is now available at no charge to users, although access to Canva AI features are locked behind the existing Canva Pro subscription service. Serif stated that the perpetually-licensed version 2 will remain available to existing owners, although it will no longer be actively maintained. The new version is currently available for macOS and Windows only, with an iPadOS version to be released soon.\nReception\nThe change in business model by Canva in 2025 was met with mixed reception, including concerns about its incorporation of AI features. Some users were concerned that their projects would be used for machine learning purposes, or that future versions would suffer from a lack of maintenance or become adware. Additionally, some felt it turned Affinity into a fundamentally subscription based software, given the prevalence of these features in professional contexts.\nAffinity publicly stated on social media that it would remain \"free forever\", users' projects would not be used to train AI models, and that \"Canva has built a sustainable business model that allows this kind of generosity. And when more professionals use Affinity, Canva can sell more seats into businesses.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
