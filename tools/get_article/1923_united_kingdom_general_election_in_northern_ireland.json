There were ten constituencies, seven single-seat constituencies with elected by FPTP and three two-seat constituencies with MPs elected by bloc voting. Only three of the constituencies had contested elections.\nResults\nVoting only took place for 4 of 13 seats. The other 9 MPs (all Ulster Unionists) were unopposed. The election saw no change in the representation of the 13 seats in Northern Ireland.\nIn the election as a whole, the Conservative Party, now led by Stanley Baldwin, lost its majority and the Labour Party formed a minority with Ramsay MacDonald as Prime Minister. The Ulster Unionists sat as members of the Conservative Party.\n}}\n|gain       = 0\n|loss       = 0\n|net        = 0\n|votes      = 79,453\n|votes %    = 49.4\n|seats %    = 84.6\n|plus/minus = -7.8\n}}\n|}\nVotes in constituencies using the bloc voting system are counted as 0.5 each, as each voter had one vote per seat.\nMPs elected\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!
