The episode was originally titled \"See You Next Tuesday\", before being changed to the final title of \"Look Who's Stalking.\" In an interview, Krysten Ritter, who plays Gia Goodman, stated that she was \"most proud of\" her work in \"Look Who's Stalking\" out of the 8 episodes of the series in which she appeared. She elaborated that in this episode, \"the writers gave me a lot of fun stuff to do.\" \"Look Who's Stalking\" also features an appearance from Max Greenfield, who portrays Leo D'Amato.\nIn addition, several important recurring characters of the second season appear in the episode, including Terrence Cook (Jeffrey Sams), Don Lamb (Michael Muhney), Cindy \"Mac\" Mackenzie (Tina Majorino), Kendall Casablancas (Charisma Carpenter), and Woody Goodman (Steve Guttenberg).

Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a mixed review, writing that \"I don't want to say that \"Look Who's Stalking\" is a bad episode exactly, although it is frustratingly direct,\" commenting on how the episode mainly served to tie up loose plot ends. \"The pieces are getting moved around here, and while I admire the narrative drive, it's hard not to see the manipulation.\" Reviewer Alan Sepinwall wrote that the episode made him \"psyched for the conclusion.\" He also stated that \"By making Woody's potential guilt such an in-your-face part of the hour, Rob and company have done one of two things: either Woody is yet another red herring or he is the bad guy and they're not going for some cheap, contrived \"Gotcha!\" in episode 22.\"\nTelevision Without Pity gave the episode a \"B−\". Price Peterson, writing for TV.com, wrote that \"the developments of this episode were strictly of the set-up variety, but \"Look Who's Stalking\" still managed to wring tons of tension out of its various situations. […] good episode, but I feel bad for anyone who had to wait a week for the next one.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://marsinvestigations.net/episodes.php?id=220&title=look_whos_stalking \"Look Who's Stalking\"] at Mars Investigations"
