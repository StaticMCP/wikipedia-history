He was admitted solicitor in 1840 and eventually became head of the legal firm of E and E L Waugh and Musgrove of Cockermouth. He was one time Registrar of the County Court and Clerk to the magistrates.\nAt the 1880 general election, Waugh was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Cockermouth, replacing the Liberal William Fletcher who had been elected at a by-election in 1879. At the 1885 general election, the town of Cockermouth ceased to be a parliamentary borough, and the name was transferred to a new county division.  Waugh did not contest the new constituency.\nWaugh married Mary Liddell, daughter of Thomas Liddell of Carlisle in 1843.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
