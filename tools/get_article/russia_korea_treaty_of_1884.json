Treaty negotiations with several Western countries were made possible by the completion of the initial Japanese overture.\nIn 1882, the Americans concluded a treaty and established diplomatic relations, which served as a template for subsequent negotiations with other Western powers.\nTerms\nThe Russians and Koreans negotiated and approved a multi-article treaty with provisions similar to those of other Western nations.\nMinisters from Russia to Korea were appointed in accordance with the treaty: Karl Ivanovich Weber, appointed October 14, 1885; Alexey Shpeyer, appointed March 28, 1898; Paul Pavlov, appointed December 13, 1898.\nThe treaty remained in effect even after a Japanese protectorate was established over Korea in 1905.\nSee also\n* Unequal treaties\n* List of Ambassadors from Russia to North Korea\n* List of Ambassadors from Russia to South Korea\nNotes\nReferences\n* Kim, Chun-gil.
