The flag of the Russian SFSR was a defacement of the flag of the USSR. The constitution stipulated:\nThe symbol of the hammer and sickle represented the working class; more specifically, the hammer represented the urban industrial workers and the sickle represented the rural and agricultural peasants. The red star represented the Communist Party and Communism. The red of the flag represented revolution in general and the Russian Revolution in particular. The blue stripe symbolized the wide Russian skies and the waters of its seas and rivers.\nHistory\nThe first flag of the Russian SFSR, adopted on 14 April 1918, was a flag showing the full name of the recently created Soviet republic before the then imminent Russian spelling reform. Its ratio was unspecified.\nFrom June 1918, the flag was red with the gold Cyrillic characters РСФСР (RSFSR) in the top-left corner, in a traditional Vyaz' style of ornamental Cyrillic calligraphy.\nFrom 1920, the characters were redesigned as described by the Russian Constitution of 1925. However, this flag was oftentimes not used, with the 1918 flag being used until 1937.\nFlag of the Russian SFSR (14 April 1918)\n|Flag RSFSR 1918.svg  | Flag of the Russian SFSR (17 June 1918 – 21 January 1937)\n|Flag of Russia (1918, cross).svg  | Early variant of the flag of the Russian SFSR, approved on 10 July 1918\n|Flag of the Russian SFSR 1937-1954.svg  | Flag of the Russian SFSR (21 January 1937 – 9 January 1954)\n}}\nIn February 1947, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR issued a resolution urging the Soviet republics to adopt new flags. The design was suggested to be based on the state flag of the USSR, as to indicate the idea of the republic within the union, and to include colors and national ornaments to express the geographical, national, historical and cultural characteristics of each republic. In the Russian SFSR, the chairman of the Secretary of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet  opened the first meeting the next month to redesign the national flag.\nOn 9 January 1954, the new national flag of the RSFSR was approved by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR. The flag was designed by artist Valentin Petrovich Viktorov. On 2 June 1954, the description of the flag was included in the Constitution of the RSFSR.\nAfter the attempted coup of 1991, Boris Yeltsin, the president of the Russian SFSR adopted a resolution that the imperial tricolor flag of the Russian Empire would be the flag of RSFSR. On 22 August 1991 the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR decided:\nIt was first hoisted at 12:00 pm on 22 August 1991 at the White House. A tricolor with the hammer and sickle on the centre was also later proposed.\nOn 1 November 1991, the Constitution of the RSFSR was amended to adopt the white-azure-scarlet flag as the official national flag.\nFlag of the Russian SFSR (9 January 1954 – 22 August/1 November 1991)\n|Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (1954–1991, dark blue).svg  | Dark blue variant of the flag of the Russian SFSR (9 January 1954 – 22 August/1 November 1991)\n|Flag_of_Russia_(1991-1993).svg  | Flag of the Russian SFSR (22 August/1 November 1991 – 25 December 1991), Russian Federation (until 11 December 1993)\n}}\nProposed flag of the Russian SFSR\n1948 Alexey Kokorekin's proposal\n|Proposed flag of the Russian SFSR (with tricolor).svg| Another proposal with the tricolour at the bottom\n|Proposed flag of the Russian SFSR (with РСФСР).svg| A proposal with gold Cyrillic characters РСФСР\n|Proposed flag of the Russian SFSR.svg| Mikhail Rodionov's 1950 proposal\n}}\nSince the first meeting for creating new national flag of the RFSFR in March 1947, some proposals were sent to the authority. The graphic artist  create a proposal to add white and blue horizontal stripes at the bottom, both two stripes took  of the flag's height. His proposal was submitted to the Secretary of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR Alexander Gorkin in June 1948 and again to the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the RSFSR Boris Chernousov in December 1949, but was not approved.\nMikhail Rodionov also created another proposal for the state flag of the RSFSR. It consisted of a traditional tricolour flag and a hammer and a sickle in the middle of the flag. Because of his proposal, he was accused of nationalism and anti-Sovietism in 1950, at the Leningrad affair case.\nOther Russian SFSR flags\nThe banner of the republic was a 1:1 ratio red flag with gold fringe, commonly used in ceremonies. The banner was also used for the first inauguration of Boris Yeltsin as President of the Russian SFSR on 10 July 1991.\nColour scheme\n{| class=wikitable width=60% style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
