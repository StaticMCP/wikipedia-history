The King's Bench was a court of common law which modern academics argue was founded independently in 1234, having previously been part of the curia regis. The court became a key part of the Westminster courts, along with the Exchequer of Pleas (qualified to hear cases involving revenue owed to the King) and the Court of Common Pleas (qualified to hear cases between subject and subject); the latter was deliberately stripped of its jurisdiction by the King's Bench and Exchequer, through the Bill of Middlesex and Writ of Quominus respectively. As a result, the courts jockeyed for power. In 1828 Henry Brougham, a Member of Parliament, complained in Parliament that as long as there were three courts unevenness was inevitable, saying that \"It is not in the power of the courts, even if all were monopolies and other restrictions done away, to distribute business equally, as long as suitors are left free to choose their own tribunal\", and that there would always be a favourite court, which would therefore attract the best lawyers and judges and entrench its position. The outcome was the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, under which all the central courts were made part of a single Supreme Court of Judicature. Eventually the government created a High Court of Justice under Lord Coleridge by an Order in Council of 16 December 1880. At this point, the King's Bench formally ceased to exist.\nThe number of Justices at any one time varied; until 1348 it fluctuated between two and four, while between 1349 and 1391 there was only one. The number continued to change, but after 1522 was (in principle) fixed at three. Acts of Parliament in 1830 and 1868 provided funding for a fourth and fifth Justice respectively. Salaries were first established in 1278, with one Justice receiving 50 marks a year and the others 40. From 1307 all received 40, with additional pay increases resulting in each being paid £100 by 1389. Salaries of £1,000 a year were provided from 1645, increasing to £1,500 in 1714, £2,000 in 1759, £3,000 in 1799 and (after variations) the salary settled at £5,000 in 1828. In 1799 pension provisions were first made, starting at £2,000 a year and peaking at £3,500 in 1825.\nList of justices\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"align:center;\"\n!width=\"260\"|Name\n!width=\"235\" class=\"unsortable\"|Born/Died\n!width=\"235\" class=\"unsortable\"|Active service\n!width=\"360\" class=\"unsortable\"|Reason for termination\n!width=\"3\" class=\"unsortable\"|Notes\n|-\n|||d. 1277/8||1272–1274||Became a Justice of the Common Pleas||\n|-\n|||d. 1290||1273–127412781290||||\n|-\n||| ||1273–1278||Became a Justice of the Common Pleas||\n|-\n||| ||12781288–1290||Became justice of an eyre circuitConvicted of judicial misconduct||\n|-\n|||1235–1295/6||1274–1278||Became senior justice of a court in Wales||\n|-\n||| ||1276–1289|| ||\n|-\n||| ||1285–1287|| ||\n|-\n|||c. 1225–1292||1288–1290||Convicted of judicial misconduct||\n|-\n|||c. 1245–1295||1290||Became Chief Justice of the King's Bench||\n|-\n|||c. 1247–1317||1290–1295||Became Chief Justice of the King's Bench||\n|-\n|||d.1294||1290–1294||Died||\n|-\n||| ||1294–1230|| ||\n|-\n|||c. 1260–1321||1296 – 10 March 1316||Became a Justice of the Common Pleas||\n|-\n|||d. 1317||1296–1303||Became an Assize justice||\n|-\n|||c. 1261–1328||1301–1323||Retired||\n|-\n||| ||6 August 1316 – 6 August 1320||Became a Baron of the Exchequer||\n|-\n|||d. 1331/2||6 August 1320 – 1 May 1329||Became Chief Justice of the King's Bench||\n|-\n|||c. 1281 – August 1354||1323 – 3 May 1324||Became a Justice of the Common Pleas||\n|-\n||| ||3 May 1324 – 1326  6 March 1327 – 1328||Became a Justice of the Common Pleas ||\n|-\n|||d.1329/30 ||9 March 1327 – 1329||Became an Assize justice||\n|-\n|||d. 5 March 1344||11 September 1329 – 29 January 1332||Became a Justice of the Common Pleas||\n|-\n|||c. 1271 – c. 1350||30 December 1329 – 1330||Became an Assize justice ||\n|-\n|||c. 1290 – 14 March 1362||22 December 1330 – 28 March 1332||Became Chief Justice of the Common Pleas||\n|-\n||| ||22 December 1330 – 1331||Became Chief Justice of the Justiciar's Court in Ireland||\n|-\n||| ||18 January 1331 – 1333|| ||\n|-\n|||d. 1336||28 January 1332 – 1335|| ||\n|-\n|||d. 1350||1332–1334|| ||\n|-\n|||1289/90–1369||20 March 1334 – 14 May 1334  22 October 1344 – 10 November 1345||Became a Justice of the Common PleasBecame a Justice of the Common Pleas||\n|-\n|||c. 1348||24 September 1334 – 1344||Became Chief Justice of the Common Pleas in Ireland||\n|-\n||| ||1338|| ||\n|-\n||| ||1338|| ||\n|-\n|||d. 1352/6||2 May 1339 – 8 January 1341||Became Chief Justice of the Common Pleas||\n|-\n|||d. c. 1350||8 January 1341 – 1348||Became an Assize justice||\n|-\n|||d. 1356/7||28 October 1341 – 1353||Retired||\n|-\n||| ||1342|| ||\n|-\n|||d. 27 May 1361||1345 – 16 November 1346||Became Chief Justice of the King's Bench||\n|-\n|||d. 1359/60||1354–13555 July 1357||Became a Justice of the Common Pleas||\n|-\n|||c. 1365||12 October 1355 – 10 July 1361||Became Chief Justice of the King's Bench for Ireland||\n|-\n||| ||25 June 1361 – 1377|| ||\n|-\n|||d. 19 February 1388||6 May 1378 – 22 June 1381|| ||\n|-\n|||d. 1387||26 February 1383 – 1386|| ||\n|-\n||| ||25 October 1387|| ||\n|-\n|||d. 1408||20 May 1389 – 1407|| ||\n|-\n|||d. 3 July 1415||20 May 138930 May 1394 - 1414||Retired||\n|-\n|||d. 6 January 1428 ||4 May 1408 – 6 January 1428||Died||\n|-\n|||d. 30 April 1423||16 June 1415 – 1422|| ||\n|-\n|||d. 1443||16 June 1415 – 21 January 1424||Became Chief Justice of the King's Bench||\n|-\n||| ||23 January 1424 - 1434|| ||\n|-\n|||d. 25 December 1448||6 February 1426 – 21 February 1445||Retired||\n|-\n|||d. 1 January 1455||3 July 1434 – 1 January 1455||Died||\n|-\n|||d. 27 March 1476||1 July 1443 – 6 April 1471|| ||\n|-\n||| ||6 February 1444 – 13 May 1461||Became Chief Justice of the King's Bench||\n|-\n|||22 May 1476||5 May 1445 – 6 April 1471|| ||\n|-\n|||d. 1460||3 July 1453 – 18 March 1460|| ||\n|-\n|||d. 5 May 1481||9 August 1464 – 23 January 1469||Became Chief Justice of the King's Bench||\n|-\n|||d. 6 October 1475||4 June 1465 – 6 October 1475||Died||\n|-\n||| ||18 April 1469 – 17 June 1471||Became a Justice of the Common Pleas||\n|-\n|||d. 25 April 1480||17 June 1471 – 25 April 1480||Died||\n|-\n|||d. 3/4 May 1477||29 April 1475 – 3/4 May 1477||Died||\n|-\n|||d. 1495||8 October 1477 – 1495||Died||\n|-\n|||d. 22/23 December 1483||14 May 1481 – 22/23 December 1483||Died||\n|-\n|||d. 14 March 1488||22 October 1484 – 14 March 1488||Died||\n|-\n|||d. 10 September 1508||16 June 1488 – 10 September 1508||Died||\n|-\n|||d. 7/8 January 1519||24 November 1495 – 26 November 1506||Became Chief Justice of the Common Pleas||\n|-\n|||1461 – 30 January 1531||28 April 1507 – 23 April 1520||Became Chief Justice of the Common Pleas||\n|-\n|||d. 2 June 1535||21 May 1509 – 28 November 1533|| ||\n|-\n|||d. 5 November 1530||23 April 1520 – 5 November 1530||Died||\n|-\n|||c. 1470 – 1538||6 February 1522 – 24 January 1526||Became Chief Justice of the King's Bench||\n|-\n|||d.
