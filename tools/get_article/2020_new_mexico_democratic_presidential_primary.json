The New Mexico primary was a closed primary, with the state awarding 46 delegates to the 2020 Democratic National Convention, of whom 34 were pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the primary results.\nFormer vice president and presumptive nominee Joe Biden won the primary with roughly 73% of the vote and won 30 delegates, helping him cross the necessary majority of 1,991 delegates and officially win the Democratic nomination three days later during the vote count, while senator Bernie Sanders, who had suspended his campaign two months earlier, narrowly passed the threshold of 15% and received 4 delegates and senator Elizabeth Warren, also withdrawn, received most of the remaining votes with around 6%.\nProcedure\nNew Mexico was one of seven states and the District of Columbia that voted on June 2, 2020, in the Democratic primaries, along with Indiana, Maryland, Montana, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Four of these states had moved their elections to June due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.\nVoting took place throughout the state from 7&nbsp;a.m. until 7&nbsp;p.m. In the closed primary, candidates had to meet a threshold of 15% at the congressional district or statewide level in order to be considered viable. The 34 pledged delegates to the 2020 Democratic National Convention were allocated proportionally on the basis of the primary results. Of these, between 5 and 9 were allocated to each of the state's 3 congressional districts and another 4 were allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates), in addition to 7 at-large delegates. Originally planned with 29 delegates, the final number included a 20% bonus of 5 additional delegates on the 19 district and 6 at-large delegates by the Democratic National Committee due to the June date, which belonged to Stage III on the primary timetable.\nState delegates first voted on district-level delegates for the national convention at district conventions on June 13, and then voted on the 7 at-large and 4 pledged PLEO delegates at the state post-primary convention between June 19 and June 20. The delegation also included 12 unpledged PLEO delegates: 5 members of the Democratic National Committee, 5 members of Congress (both senators and all 3 representatives), the governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, and former DNC chair Fred R. Harris.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;float:none;padding:5px;\"\n! colspan=\"2\"| Pledged nationalconvention delegates\n|-\n!
