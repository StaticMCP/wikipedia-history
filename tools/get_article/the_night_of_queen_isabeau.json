The film depicts the marriage between the mad Charles VI of France and his wife Queen Isabeau. It was shot at the Babelsberg Studios in Berlin. The film is now considered a lost film, but contemporary reviews praised Wiene's direction. The story revolves around insanity, a common theme in his films.\nCast\n* Fern Andra as Königin Isabeau\n* Fritz Kortner as Connetable\n* Hans Heinrich von Twardowski as Page\n* Elsa Wagner\n* Lothar Müthel as Jehan\n* John Gottowt as Buckliger Narr\n* Albert Lind\n* Alexander Moissi as King Karl VI.\n* Harald Paulsen\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Jacobsen, Wolfgang.
