In 1997 Vladimir Moser was ordained and appointed as a preacher of the Lutheran congregation in Tiraspol. Moser founded congregations in Bender, Chișinău, Rîbnița, and Camenca. In the spring of 1999, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Republic of Moldova was registered formally with the Moldovan authorities.\nNorsk Luthersk Lekmannsmisjon (NLL) started missionary work in Moldova in the fall of 1999 and created a formal cooperation agreement with the ELCRM. A little later the Nordisk Östmission (NÖ) also began missionary work in Moldova. also in cooperation with the ELCRM.
