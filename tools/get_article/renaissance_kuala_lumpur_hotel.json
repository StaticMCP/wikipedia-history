It consisted of two towers with guest rooms, the East Wing and the West Wing. They were connected by a podium structure, containing the lobby, restaurants, meeting facilities, and a pool deck on the roof. An underground tributary of the Gombak river runs under the East Wing. The Renaissance Kuala Lumpur Hotel also houses the Mandara Spa.\nIn 2020, the hotel temporarily closed for an extensive renovation and repositioning. The East Wing was later rebranded as Four Points by Sheraton Kuala Lumpur, City Centre, while the West Wing continues under the Renaissance brand.\nRenovation and Dual-Brand Relaunch (2023)\nIn October 2023, the Renaissance Kuala Lumpur Hotel reopened after a major renovation that introduced redesigned rooms, updated public areas, and new family-oriented facilities.\nThe property became part of Malaysia's first dual-branded complex under Marriott International, sharing its address with the Four Points by Sheraton Kuala Lumpur, City Centre.
