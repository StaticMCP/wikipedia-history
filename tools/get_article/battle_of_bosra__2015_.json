According to an opposition activist from Daraa, 10,000 rebels were involved in the battle.\nOn 24 March 2015, rebels advanced in the town and besieged a number of soldiers in the ancient citadel, which the Army relieved after a counterattack. The Syrian Air Force launched 10 airstrikes on the town, while 30 barrel bombs were also dropped that day. The Army also fired rockets on the nearby Maaraba hospital, where injured rebels were being treated, which completely levelled the building.\nOn 25 March 2015, FSA rebels backed by Islamist factions captured the town and its UNESCO archaeological sites. According to a pro-government source, Army and militia units retreated from their positions in the town after the promised reinforcements were not deployed.\nAftermath\nOn 29 March, local clashes took place in Glen town in the Daraa countryside between the Islamic Muthanna Movement and the Lions of Sunna Brigade after an \"argument\" occurred about dividing the seized weapons and ammunition in Bosra. One fighter from the Islamic Muthanna Movement was killed, while three fighters were injured from both sides in the clashes. Ahmad al-Awda turned against Al-Nusra and the Islamic Muthanna Movement and \"expelled\" them from the city.\nReferences"
