It focuses on the history of the City of Akron and Summit County, Ohio.\nPurpose\nis one of the properties owned by the Summit County Historical Society.]]\nThe mission of SCHS is to preserve and interpret the history of Summit County and Akron, and to educate communities about the people and events that have shaped the local history. The Society owns and manages three properties: the Perkins Stone Mansion, John Brown House, and Old Stone School in downtown Akron—a joint project with Akron Public Schools.

The Summit County Historical Society is a member of the , the Northeast Ohio Inter-Museum Council and the American Association for State and Local History.\nSheep were a vital part of the Perkins farm in the past. So, currently, each summer a flock of sheep are loaned from a local farm and brought to the property. Shepherding demonstrations are offered during this season.\nHistory\nThe Summit County Historical Society (SCHS) was founded in 1924 by the Cuyahoga Portage chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution to celebrate the centennial of the City of Akron. In 1929, the Society acquired its first property, the Old Stone School on South Broadway. The 1840 stone school building was donated by the City of Akron. In 1939, Carl Pockrandt was elected president of the Society, a post he held for over thirty years. Under his leadership membership swelled to almost 2,000. At the death of May Perkins, widow of Charles Perkins, in 1943 the John Brown House was bequeathed to the Society, with $10,000 (~$}} in ) for its upkeep. The one-time home of the famed abolitionist was to be used for historical purposes. In 1945, the Society purchased the Perkins Stone Mansion from George Perkins Raymond for $25,000 (~$}} in ).\nA time capsule was buried in the porch of the Perkins Stone Mansion in 1950. It was opened in 2000 and contained several historic documents and artifacts relating to local history. In 1965, SCHS acquired Bronson Memorial Church in Peninsula. The 1839 church was maintained by the Cuyahoga Valley Association until 1982. It was deeded to the Peninsula Valley Historic & Education Foundation in 2003.\nIn 1967, during a joint effort with Akron Public Schools, the Society restored the Old Stone School. Today, Akron Public Schools and The Society host school visits and special events at the site.\nIn 1976, SCHS hired its first Executive Director, James D. Strider. In 1981, the Society sponsored the publication of Akron:  City at the Summit by George Knepper and in 1983, SCHS renovated the former wood shed into exhibit space and offices. A bequest by Carl Pockrandt of $11,000 was used for the renovation. The building was named in his honor. The space continues to house the staff offices and Mutton Hill Gift Shop.\nThis building, the former woodshed, houses staff offices and is located behind the Perkins Stone Mansion.\nIn 1986, the Perkins Stone Mansion was completely restored and in 1992 the Carriage house was renovated for the use of exhibits and meeting space.\nThe Wash House was renovated in 1994. In 1998, the John Brown House and Perkins Stone Mansion and a portion of the stone wall were renovated followed by a renovation of the Pockrandt Visitor Center in 2001. In 2006, the interior restoration was part of a project guided by the Junior League of Akron and a replica of the original Perkins Gazebo was erected on the grounds.\nPresent day\nThe Summit County Historical Society continues to provide historical information and research to the Akron area.
