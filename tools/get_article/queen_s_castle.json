It is a rustic, lakeside camp structure built about 1881 on the shore of Seneca Lake.\nBackground\nIt is a one-story, roughly square, 17 feet, 6&nbsp;inches by 18 feet, structure surmounted by a steeply pitched wood shingled hipped roof.  It is the sole surviving component of Camp Fossenvue, established in 1875 as an informal, lakeside summer retreat where liberally minded young women could indulge in a variety of radical, even scandalous, intellectual, physical, and recreational activities.  Its last year of operation as a women's camp was in 1901. In 1924, the site was sold to the Elmira Council of Boy Scouts for Camp Seneca, which continued to operate until 1989. The United States Department of Agriculture purchased the property in 1996, adding it to the Finger Lakes National Forest.\nIt was designed by \"locally prominent\" Arthur Nash, who appears to be North Carolina architect Arthur C. Nash, was born in Geneva, New York.)\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070822215042/http://www.co.seneca.ny.us/history/Fossenvue%20%28Queen%27s%20Castle%29.doc Fossenvue description]\n* [http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.rbc/gen.0001 Embers from Fossenvue backlogs, 1875-1900.] From the Rare Book and Special Collections Division at the Library of Congress"
