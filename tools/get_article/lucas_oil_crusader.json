It was driven by Linsey Weenk, former Blue Thunder driver, who debuted in 2011 in Houston, Texas. It featured one of the first trucks to change its roof artwork, which is the medieval knight decal and the truck's logo, and then after a while, it was replaced with the Lucas Oil logo. It also had the Lucas Oil flags at the back of the truck. It was sponsored by Lucas Oil since its debut in Houston, Texas, 2011. The truck was supposedly retired on July 28, 2019, but returned in 2020 to compete in Stadium Championship Series Red.\nHistory\nIn 2011, the truck debuted at Houston, Texas, and the truck was driven by Linsey Weenk, who had previously driven Blue Thunder and Iron Outlaw from previous years. However, the truck made its first Monster Jam World Finals appearance with Weenk still behind-the-wheel. He defeated Nitro Circus in Round 2, El Toro Loco in Round 3, but lost to Maximum Destruction in the semi-finals in Racing. He got a 27 in freestyle which tied with El Toro Loco.\nIn 2012, the truck has red beadlocks in each tire. Weenk once again competed at the World Finals. He defeated Advanced Auto Parts Grinder in Round 2, but he lost to Monster Energy in Round 3 in Racing. He got a 21 in freestyle. In the same year, Linsey was the first driver to land 2 backflips in one single freestyle run. The first one was in bonus time, and the second one was after all the scores were in, but broke both rear wheels (only for the Monster Jam fans), in Metlife Stadium, East Rutherford, New Jersey.\nIn 2013, Weenk competed again at the World Finals. However, he lost to Captain America in Round 1 in Racing. He got a 27 in freestyle which tied with Iron Man and Stone Crusher.\nIn 2014, Weenk competed in the World Finals for Racing and Freestyle. However, he defeated FOX Sports 1 Cleatus in Round 1, Spider-Man in Round 2, but lost to Grave Digger in Round 3. He got a 30.5 in freestyle.\nIn 2015, Weenk gets invited at the World Finals. He defeated Zombie in Round 1, Grave Digger the Legend in Round 2, but lost to Monster Mutt in Round 3 in Racing. He got a 26 in freestyle.\nIn 2016, Weenk competed at the World Finals for the 15th time. He defeated Dragon in Round 1, but lost to Coty Saucier's Monster Energy in Round 2 in Racing. He got a 17.5 in freestyle.\nIn 2017, Weenk competed in the FS1 East Series and won the Series. Linsey competed at the World Finals, he defeated Adam Anderson's Grave Digger in Round 1, but lost to Megalodon in Round 2 in Racing.

He got a 8.691 in freestyle.\nOn 28 July 2019, the truck was supposedly retired after its last show at Hagerstown (due to Monster Jam's contract with Lucas Oil ending that year), but returned in 2020.\nIn 2020, the truck competes on Stadium Championship Series Red (which would later be ended due to the COVID-19 pandemic) and finishes 4th in standings.\nIn December, the truck was retired permanently, as revealed by Linsey himself in an Instagram post.\nDrivers\n* Linsey Weenk (2011–2020)\n* Marc McDonald (2020; Indianapolis and Atlanta event)\nAwards\nMonster Jam World Finals\n* 2011\n#Driver: Linsey Weenk\n# Racing: Lost to Maximum Destruction in Round 4\n#Freestyle: Scored 27 - Tied for Seventh with El Toro Loco\n* 2012\n#Driver: Linsey Weenk\n#Racing: Lost to Monster Energy in Round 3\n#Freestyle: Scored 21 - Ninth\n* 2013\n#Driver: Linsey Weenk\n#Racing: Lost to Captain America in Round 1\n#Freestyle: Scored 27 - Tied for Fourth with Iron Man and Stone Crusher\n* 2014\n#Driver: Linsey Weenk\n#Racing: Lost to Grave Digger in Round 3\n#Freestyle: Scored 30.5 - Tied for Fifth with Captain America\n* 2015\n#Driver: Linsey Weenk\n#Racing: Lost to Monster Mutt in Round 3\n#Freestyle: Scored 26 - Tenth\n* 2016\n#Driver: Linsey Weenk\n#Racing: Lost to Coty Saucier's Monster Energy in Round 2\n#Freestyle: Scored 17.5 - Seventeenth\n* 2017\n#Driver: Linsey Weenk\n#Racing: Lost to Megalodon in Round 2\n#Freestyle: Scored 6.695 - Twenty-Fourth\n* 2018\n#Driver: Linsey Weenk\n#Racing: Lost to FS1 Cleatus in Round 1\n#Freestyle: Scored 8.691 - Fourth\n* 2019\n#Driver: Linsey Weenk\n#Racing: Lost to Son-Uva-Digger in Round 2\n#Freestyle: Scored 8.907 - Sixth\nSee also\n* Monster Truck\n* List of Monster Trucks\nReferences"
