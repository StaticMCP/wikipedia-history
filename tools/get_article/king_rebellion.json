The team relocated to King Township after the 2023–24 OJHL season from Brantford, Ontario where it was known as the Brantford 99ers.\nTeam identity\nThe name King Rebellion is a reference to King Township's part in the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837, and is also the name of the King Township Minor Hockey Association’s rep teams.\nArena\nThe team plays its home games at the Township-Wide Recreation Centre, also known as the Zancor Centre, in King Township. Construction of the facility began in April 2022 and was scheduled for completion in September 2024, however, a break-in at the site that resulted in damage to the mechanical systems delayed the completion until January 2025.\nHistory\nThe team debuted in the 2024–25 OJHL season after the franchise, which was formerly known as the Brantford 99ers, relocated to King Township and was rebranded as the King Rebellion.\nThe Rebellion finished the 2024–25 regular season in 7th place in the West conference, with a record of 24 wins, 25 losses, 2 ties and 5 overtime losses. In the post-season, they were eliminated after the first round of the playoffs after losing to the second-place Collingwood Blues 4-1.\nGeoff Schomogyi was appointed as head coach in May 2025, replacing Mark Joslin.\n|+ style=\"background:#001F3C; border:#EFBF39 3px solid\"|\n! style=width:4em   | Season\n! style=width:2.2em |\n! style=width:2.2em |\n! style=width:2.2em |\n! style=width:2.2em |\n! style=width:2.2em |\n! style=width:2.2em |\n! style=width:2.2em |\n! style=width:2.2em |\n!
