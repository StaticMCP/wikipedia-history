Anderson and published by American company Bantam Spectra. It is a tribute to H. G. Wells' 1898 novel The War of the Worlds; each story envisions a famous individual's reactions to the Martian invasion and the impact of the invasion on a different part of the world.\nSeveral of the stories tie into other works of fiction; Anderson would also later go on to write The Martian War, a novel that also presented Wells' Martian invasion from the viewpoints of Wells and several other fictional and historical characters.\nReception\nThe book has been reviewed by:\n* Gary K. Wolfe (1996) in Locus, #424 May 1996\n* Stephen Baxter (1996) in Interzone, #109 July 1996\n* Mark R. Kelly (1996) in Locus, #428 September 1996\n* Moshe Feder (1996) in ''Asimov's Science Fiction'', September 1996\n* Don D'Ammassa (1996) in Science Fiction Chronicle, #190 October 1996\n* Thomas A. Easton [as by Tom Easton] (1996) in Analog Science Fiction and Fact, October 1996\n* Brian M. Thomsen [as by Brian Thomsen] (1996) in Dragon Magazine, November 1996\n* Robert M. Price (1997) in Crypt of Cthulhu, Lammas 1997\n* John Deakins (1997) in Absolute Magnitude, Spring 1997\n* James Schellenberg (2000) in Challenging Destiny, April 2000\nPolish science fiction editor and critic, Maciej Parowski, positively commented on the anthology in his 2011 book Małpy Pana Boga – Słowa, noting that it was a well executed difficult endeavour, difficult because the writers were limited by the theme (reactions of the famous individuals to the Martian invasion). He singled out stories by Tiedemann and Wolverton as particularly notable.\nImpact\nGlobal Dispatches was one of the works consulted by Stephen Baxter for his own sequel to The War of the Worlds, The Massacre of Mankind.\nTable of contents\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!
