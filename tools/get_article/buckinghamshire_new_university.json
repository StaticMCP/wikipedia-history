The institution dates from 1891, when it was founded as the School of Science and Art, and has since then has variously been known as Wycombe Technical Institute, High Wycombe College of Technology and Art and the Buckinghamshire College of Higher Education. It was a university college from 1999 until 2007, when its application for university status was accepted.\nThe university is a member of the GuildHE.\nHistory\n19th century origins\nFounded in 1891 as the School of Science and Art, it was initially established with public funds raised from a tax on beer and spirits and set about providing evening classes to residents of High Wycombe and the local area.\n20th century\nAfter World War I, it was renamed the Wycombe Technical Institute, forging close links with local crafts such as furniture making and cabinetry and helping to provide skills to injured war veterans in order that they might find work in local industries.\nFurther building took place after World War II, and on 6 May 1963 the new facilities were officially opened by the Minister of Education, Sir Edward Boyle. A new change of name, the High Wycombe College of Technology and Art accompanied this expansion.\nBy the 1960s, around 3,000 people worked in the manufacture of furniture in High Wycombe, and 80% of the wooden chairs manufactured in Britain were made there.\nIn 1975 High Wycombe College of Art and Technology merged with the Newland Park College of Education in Chalfont St Giles, and was renamed the Buckinghamshire College of Higher Education. In the same decade Missenden Abbey, a former Augustinian monastery founded in 1133, was acquired, and in May 1988 it was officially opened as a management centre by Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester.\nIn March 1999 it was awarded University College status by the government, changing its name once again to Buckinghamshire Chilterns University College. Around this time the Which University guide described it as a \"concrete labyrinth\", which was unlikely to be \"bringing home architectural awards\".\n21st century\nIn 2007 its application for university status was approved by the Privy Council and it took its current name \"Buckinghamshire New University\", abbreviated to Bucks. The university changed its shortened name to 'BNU' in 2021.\nAlternative names such as 'University of Wycombe', 'Wycombe University', 'University of High Wycombe', 'High Wycombe University', 'University of Buckinghamshire' and 'Buckinghamshire Chilterns University' were rejected. The chosen name was to lead to displeasure from the University of Buckingham for also using the county name.\nBucks had  plans to consolidate its campuses into a purpose-built site near to Hughenden Park in High Wycombe on land previously owned by CompAir. While these plans fell through, the university changed plans to renovate and enlarge the main campus as well as consolidate both the Wellesbourne and Chalfont campuses onto the High Wycombe site. Additionally, new halls of residence have been built at the Hughenden Park site.\nThe university is a lead academic sponsor of Buckinghamshire University Technical College, a new university technical college which opened in Aylesbury in September 2013.\nCampuses\nThe university operates over four campuses: High Wycombe Campus (previously belonging to the High Wycombe College of Art and Technology), since 2009 a site in Uxbridge in the London Borough of Hillingdon, a thriving base for nursing students and applied healthcare research, a campus in Aylesbury and a site known as Missenden Abbey which is also a conference centre.\nIn 2008, the university disposed of two existing campuses; the Chalfont Campus (near Little Chalfont) and the Wellesbourne Campus (near Hazlemere).\nGateway building\nThe university undertook a major development of the High Wycombe Campus with a large structure, known as the Gateway Building, being built onto the front of the existing building. It won a RIBA award in 2010.\nThe Gateway offers facilities including a sports/events hall, fitness centre and performance lab, dance and drama studios, sound design labs, music recording studios and video production suites, a 'modern integrated learning resources centre', a cafe and meeting and conference rooms. It also has green screen facilities and a motion capture system.\nHalls of residence\nThere is a range of accommodation at Bucks New University including halls of residence, managed houses and the student village:\n* Brook Street Halls, the first to be built for Bucks New University, has 396 rooms and is situated opposite High Wycombe bus station, a five minutes' walk from the university campus.\n* Hughenden Park Student Village was completed in 2009. All 410 student rooms are en-suite and the area is a 15 minutes' walk from the University's Wycombe campus.\n* Windsor House is located in High Wycombe town centre. Much of the estate used to build the halls has been bought from The Chilterns Shopping Centre.\nAcademic profile\nCabair at Denham International\nReputation and rankings\n}}\nIn November 2013 it was ranked 12th in the UK by the Huffington Post in a list of creative universities.\nIt was also included in a list of the top 14 creative universities in the UK by The Daily Telegraph in December 2013. Domestically, the university is ranked 70th out of 121 universities for 2023 (Guardian) and 39 out of 105 universities in England for teaching quality (Times / Sunday Times).\nResearch standing\nFor the most recent 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF), the grading \"internationally excellent\" or \"world leading\" was for some submissions in the areas Allied Health Professions, Business and Management Studies, Sport and Exercise Sciences, Art and Design.\nSpecialist courses\nThe university runs several specialist courses.\nThe Air Transport with Commercial Pilot Training is a course offering students the opportunity to study for a professional pilot's licence whilst undertaking university studies in areas such as globalisation of the air transport industry and health safety and security for airlines and airports. Many former students (including Virgin Atlantic deputy chief pilot David Brooks) have gone on to attain jobs as pilots in flying schools, charter companies and airlines around the world including Susi Air, Cathay Pacific, Qatar, BMI and Ryanair.\nAlthough the Air Transport with Commercial Pilot Training course aims to provide guidance and support to students with the aim of becoming commercial pilots, many students are inspired by various modules of the course and pursue careers in other areas within the air transport industry. In 2009 graduate Antony Coe set up his own business DexFix computer repairs. Following this and in conjunction with his studies in Health safety and security for airlines and airports Coe now provides contract services to the counter terrorism task forces worldwide.\nIn 2023, the university established a new [https://www.bucks.ac.uk/school-aviation-security/centre-intelligence-security-and-resilience Centre for Intelligence, Security and Resilience] and expanded its offerings for students at the start of their careers as well as middle managers looking to apply analysis and information leadership to emerging challenges where intelligence, security and resilience coincide. Key staff in this endeavour include Fiona Galbraith, Mike Croll, Beverley Griffiths, Joel Weaver, Rania Khbais and Shelley Jones.\nThe university offers several other courses such as Music Management and Film and Television Production.
