On 31 March 1933, the sitting Landtag was dissolved by the Nazi-controlled central government and reconstituted to reflect the distribution of seats in the national Reichstag. The Landtag subsequently was formally abolished as a result of the \"Law on the Reconstruction of the Reich\" of 30 January 1934 which replaced the German federal system with a unitary state.\n1918\nThe 1918 Mecklenburg-Strelitz state election was held on 15 December 1918 to elect the 42 members of the constituent assembly.\nElections in Germany Elections in Germany Elections in Germany Elections in Germany Elections in Germany Elections in Germany Elections in Germany}}\nReferences"
