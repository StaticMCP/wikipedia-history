The institution was established in 1898 as the Municipal Archive of Ljubljana with contemporary institution, itself established in 1951, serving as the direct successor of the Municipal Archives. Alongside headquarters in Ljubljana the institution oversees local organizational units in Kranj, Novo Mesto, Škofja Loka and Idrija. The archives holds around 16,000 linear meters of archival material. Most of the material pertains to the regions it serves and is generally over 30 years old, with the oldest items dating back to the 14th century. Since 2010 the archive is a part of the е-ARH.si of the Government of Slovenia project aimed at the development of the public electronic archive in Slovenia.\nSee also\n* List of archives in Slovenia\nExternal links\n* [https://www.zal-lj.si/ Official website]\nReferences"
