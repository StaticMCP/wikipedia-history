Kościuszko with 6,200 men, who planned to prevent the linking of three larger Russian corps, commanded by generals Fyodor Denisov, Ivan Fersen and Alexander Suvorov. He also had requested the support of Adam Poniński (who had 4,000 soldiers), but Poniński failed to arrive on the battlefield in time.\nBattle\nKościuszko had spent the night in an abandoned manor house of the Zamoyskis with his army in the field in front flanked by woods, and a river behind the house.  Denisov and then Fersen attacked the next morning, and the Poles burned the village on their left flank to prevent it being used as cover.  Initially, the Russian advance was slowed by the mud, but after three hours the Poles ran out of ammunition for their cannons.  The Russian infantry then made a bayonet charge and slaughtered the Poles for the next three hours.\nAfter three horses were shot from under him, Kościuszko finally tried leaving the battlefield, but his horse tripped. A Cossack stabbed him with a pike from behind, followed by a second Cossack who stabbed him in the left hip.  Attempting to take his own life, Kościuszko found his pistol empty, and then passed out in the mud, but was not identified as the Polish commanding general. He was stripped by two unknown horsemen, but then saved and carried away from the battlefield by Denisov's Cossacks and later taken prisoner.\nAftermath\nKościuszko was taken to St. Petersburg by General Alexei Khrushchev and two thousand Russian soldiers.  The news of the fall of Warsaw reached him on 17 November.\nThe Battle of Maciejowice is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription \"MACIEJOWICE 10 X 1794”.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://wars175x.narod.ru/btl_mcj_odb_e.html 10.10.1794.
