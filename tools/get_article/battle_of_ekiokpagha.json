Its designation as a battle is a mere historical formality as there was no fighting, but Ewedo's forces killed Chief Oliha, a senior ally of Ogiamien. The battle was fought between Ewedo, the recently coronated Oba of Benin, and Ogiamien III, the head of a royal family in the Benin Empire who disputed his claim to the throne. Oba Ewedo was victorious and established his palace at the site of the battle. Ewedo recognised Ogiamien III as a chief under his kingship.\nThe battle and its aftermath have been reenacted in the coronation rituals of the subsequent Obas of Benin, as a symbol of the historical and traditional enmity between the Oba and the Ogiamien family.\nBackground\nThe conflict between Ewedo and Ogiamien III originated with the establishment of the Benin dynasty in the 12th century AD by Prince Oranmiyan from Ife. Oranmiyan was invited to rule by the Benin elders due to their dissatisfaction with the rule of  ('king') Owodo. Owodo's reign was marked by misrule and the decline of the Ogiso monarchy, leading to a crisis of leadership. To restore stability, the elders sought a new leader and invited Oranmiyan.\nUpon his arrival in Benin, Oranmiyan had a relationship with Erimwinde, daughter of Ogie of Egor, a settlement northwest of Benin City. Erimwinde gave birth to a son, Eweka, who would become the first Oba of Benin. However, Oranmiyan faced environmental challenges and hostility from the local populace, which led to his departure from Benin. Before leaving, he entrusted his son to Chief Evian, the Odionwere (head of the elders) of Benin.\nEweka, raised by Evian, became the first Oba of Benin and initiated efforts to expand his influence and authority. However, he encountered resistance from indigenous chiefs, particularly Ogiamien III, who contested Eweka's legitimacy to succeed the Ogiso monarchy. Ogiamien III, who claimed descent from the first Ogiso, Igodo, commanded a substantial territory and possessed a formidable army. Refusing to pay tribute or acknowledge Eweka's authority, Ogiamien III posed a persistent challenge.\nDespite attempts by Eweka and his successors to quell Ogiamien and his followers, success remained elusive over several generations. The conflict persisted until the reign of Oba Ewedo, who assumed the throne in 1255 AD. Ewedo sought to establish secure rule over Benin and devised a plan to end the Ogiamien family's defiance. This plan aimed to entice Ogiamien III into a decisive battle to secure Ewedo's authority.\nBattle\nEwedo secured the allegiance of Ubi, the eldest son of Ogiamien, through secret negotiations. Ewedo promised rewards to Ubi for his assistance in entering Benin City and establishing his rule. Aware of the resistance from the Edo people towards the monarchy's reinstatement, Ubi suggested a covert approach.14}}\nThe strategy required Ewedo to symbolically announce his intention to enter the city by adorning himself with a white-cloth-covered rooster. Upon his arrival, Ubi would theatrically deny him entry, confiscate the rooster, and declare the onset of war after a week. This act was to be followed by Ewedo's offer of tributes to Ubi, convincing him to grant passage and control of the city on the seventh day.\nEwedo executed the scheme. The rooster, representing a sacrificial entity, was taken by Ubi, who then feigned escape, prompting a pursuit by Ewedo's men. Ubi discarded the rooster near a cemetery, ceasing the pursuit and marking the location that would become the new royal palace. Seven days later, the opposing forces gathered at Ekiokpagha for a decisive encounter. However, before reaching the battleground, Ewedo's forces unexpectedly encountered and eliminated Oliha, a high-ranking chief of Ogiamien, leading to the proverbial phrase  (\"We have not reached Ekiokpagha yet, but we have killed Ogiamien's Oliha\"), indicating the premature victory over Ogiamien's forces.\nThe narrative suggests a level of collusion between the two factions, traditionally seen as adversaries. Following these events, Ewedo relocated from Usama, his provisional abode, to the current palace site. This move was strategic, connecting him with the land's original custodians and ancestors, thereby solidifying the legitimacy of his reign. Despite the outward harmony, Ewedo stationed his personal guards close to Ogiamien III's residence, indicating underlying mistrust.16}}\nTreaty\nThe Treaty of Ekiokpagha was established between Ogiamien III and Ewedo, signifying a new era of peace and cooperation. Under this treaty, the Ogiamien and his followers committed to reconciliation, declaring an immediate halt to hostilities that had arisen during the tumultuous interregnum. A central element of the accord was the recognition of Ewedo's sovereignty over the Benin kingdom, with the Ogiamien formally acknowledging Ewedo's rule. In a gesture of unity, the Ogiamien relinquished any claim to the kingship of the Benin kingdom and transferred the Royal Stool of the Ogiso to Ewedo.\nThe treaty also honoured the hereditary status of the Ogiamien, granting him the title of a hereditary chief and ensuring that he and his descendants would be recognised as members of the Benin nobility. Furthermore, the treaty specified that no chiefs, , were to have the authority to intervene or exert political influence over the Ogiamien within his domain. The commitment to peace was underscored by a clause that prohibited the resumption of armed conflict or bloodshed following the treaty's ratification.62 | loc=\"Sixth, there will be no resort to armed struggle and bloodshed or renewal of conflicts once the agreement has been endorsed.\"}} Lastly, the Treaty of Ekiokpagha instituted a tradition of reaffirmation by each new Oba of Benin with the Ogiamien, ensuring that no retributive measures would be taken against the supporters of either side for their past political actions.\nAftermath and legacy\nThe Battle of Ekiokpagha marked a decisive end to the conflict between previous Obas of Benin, including Ewedo and the Ogiamien family, signifying the unification of the Benin monarchy. Oba Ewedo earned the epithet \"Ewedo the Great\" for redefining the authority structures within the Benin nation. His reign brought transformative measures, including the establishment of the  ('kingmakers'), the expansion of city walls, the institution of a guild system, and the promotion of trade and commerce.\nIn the aftermath, Ogiamien III assumed a subordinate role as a chief under the Oba, retaining specific privileges and influence. He retained possession of his palace and title, securing a share of tribute from the villages under his jurisdiction. Exempted from certain customary obligations such as prostrating before the Oba or wearing a cap in his presence, Ogiamien III was acknowledged as the representative of the indigenous people and the custodian of the Ekiokpagha Treaty.\nThe Battle of Ekiokpagha and its aftermath are ritually reenacted during the coronation ceremonies of subsequent Obas of Benin, symbolising the historical tensions between the Oba and the Ogiamien family. The reenactments occur at a constructed \"bridge\" adorned with fresh palm fronds, representing the crossing from Isekhere's territory to Ogiamien's domain, where the Oba is ceremonially challenged. Another enactment unfolds at Ekiokpagha, where a simulated conflict transpires between the Oba and Ogiamien, ultimately culminating in reconciliation. These ritualistic performances serve to renew the terms of the treaty, averting potential displeasure of the land that might result in afflictions upon the city.\nIn recent times, particularly surrounding the 2016 coronation of Ewuare II, the Battle of Ekiokpagha has become a point of controversy. The Ogiamien family, led by Arisco Osemwengie, asserted their claim to the Benin throne, challenging the authority and legitimacy of the Oba. Refusing to participate in the coronation rituals, they demanded recognition as a distinct kingdom. In response, the palace dismissed these claims as unfounded, labelling them rebellious and disrespectful, and contending that the Ogiamien family lacked ancestral ties to the Ogiso monarchy, considering them as former slaves.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
