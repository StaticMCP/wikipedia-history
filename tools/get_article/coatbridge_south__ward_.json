Covering neighbourhoods in the south-east of Coatbridge (Calderwood, Carnbroe, Greenend, Kirkshaws, Rosehall, Shawhead, Sikeside, Victoria Park and Whifflet), it currently elects four councillors. A boundary review in 2017 caused the addition of an area between Langloan Street, the A725 and the A89, with a small increase in the electorate and an additional seat from the original three. The ward had a population of 16,889 in 2019.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|James Brooks(Labour)\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|John Higgins(Labour)\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Ian Ferrie(SNP)\n!colspan=2; rowspan=2|3 seats\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=1|Imtiaz Majid(SNP)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2|Tom Castles(Labour)\n|rowspan=1|Gordon Encinias(Labour)\n|rowspan=3|Tracy Carragyer(SNP)\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Fergus MacGregor(SNP)\n|-\n!2018 by-\n|rowspan=2|Geraldine Woods(Labour)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1|Andrew Bustard(Labour)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 Election\n2017 Election\n|numcounts= 8\n}}\n2018 By-election\n*On 13 August 2018, Labour councillor Gordon Encinias died, having been unwell for some time.
