It is legally responsible for the preparation and publication of the official historical documentary record of U.S. foreign policy in the Foreign Relations of the United States series, which can be accessed at its website. It researches and writes historical studies on aspects of U.S. diplomacy for use by Department of State employees and the public.\nThe office makes recommendations to other bureaus regarding the identification, maintenance, and long-term preservation of important historical diplomatic records. Its outreach activities include participating in the planning and installation of the historical components of the department's planned United States Center for Diplomacy, counseling private scholars and journalists on historical research issues, and responding to government and public inquiries on diplomatic history questions.\nList of Directors of the Office of the Historian\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!#\n!Directors of the Office of the Historian\n!Term start\n!Term end\n|-\n|1\n|Gaillard Hunt\n|1919\n|1924\n|-\n|2\n|Harry Dwight\n|1924\n|1924\n|-\n|3\n|Tyler Dennett\n|1924\n|1931\n|-\n|4\n|David Hunter Miller\n|1931\n|1933\n|-\n|5\n|Cyril Wynne\n|1933\n|1939\n|-\n|6\n|E.
