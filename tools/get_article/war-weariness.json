The causes normally involve the intensity of casualties—financial, civilian, and military. It also occurs when a belligerent has the ability to leave the conflict easily but continues to stay. War-weariness normally leads to a distrust in government or military leadership and can spark protest and anti-war movements. It can also be fueled when a belligerent is found guilty of war crimes, which can create domestic and international backlash. Rates of enlistment and the morale of the armed forces are often affected by war-weariness.\nIt is relevant for war initiation but less so for war involvement.\nIn The Causes of War, Australian historian Geoffrey Blainey argues, \"If war-weariness was one of the spokes in Mr. Neville Chamberlain's umbrella of appeasement, and if it was one of the Anglo-French attitudes which fed Hitler's confidence, it cannot be called a peaceful influence\". Even so, Blainey concludes, \"War-weariness in a nation often promotes peace and war-fever promotes war, but there have been notable instances where war-weariness promoted war\".\nWar-weariness is less likely to appear in military dictatorships, especially those with heavy propaganda and censorship. According to Immanuel Kant, democratic nations have a better chance of having unpopular news of the war reach the masses, which increases their chance and level of war-weariness.\nHistorical examples\n* Opposition to World War I\n** 1917 French Army mutinies\n** Kiel mutiny and German revolution of 1918–1919\n* Opposition to World War II\n** German resistance to Nazism\n** Japanese People's Anti-war Alliance\n** Mutinies during WWII\n* Russian civil war\n** Kronstadt rebellion\n* Cold War\n** Opposition to the Vietnam War\n* War on Terror\n** Opposition to the Iraq War\n** Opposition to the War in Afghanistan (2001–2021)\nReferences\nde:Kriegsmüdigkeit"
