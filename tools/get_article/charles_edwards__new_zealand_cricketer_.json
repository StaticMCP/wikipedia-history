In a one-day match against the touring Australians in 1886–87 he took 6 for 39.\nEdwards was appointed manager of the Napier Gas Company in 1886, and still held that position at the time of his sudden death in Napier in March 1924.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/21/21843/21843.html Charles Edwards] at CricketArchive"
