It is composed of five companies, a historical company and one artillery battery plus a military band, a fanfare trumpet section and a Corps of Drums. It is stationed at the Casa de Nariño in Bogotá and carries the traditions of Simon Bolivar's infantry guards company raised in the midst of the Spanish American wars of independence in 1815.\nHistory\nThe origins of the Presidential Guard Battalion can be traced back to the honor guard of the Viceroy of New Granada during the colonial era. In 1751 then Viceroy of New Granada, José Alfonso Pizarro, ordered the creation of an honor guard for the viceroy, this guard was composed of two companies, an infantry company known as the Compañia de Infanteria de la Guardia del Virrey o Alabarderos (Infantry Company of the Viceroy’s Guard or Halberders) and a cavalry company known as the Compañía de Caballería de la Guardia del Virrey (Cavalry Company of the Viceroy’s Guard). The Viceroy’s guard had its quarters in a building diagonal to the main cathedral of Bogotá (then known as Santafé). The infantry company was dissolved in 1784 but reestablished in 1790.\nWar of Independence\nOn February 12, 1815, whilst in the city of Mompox,  General Simón Bolívar acting as captain general (equivalent to the commander-in-chief of the army) of the army of New Granada, published a decree ordering the formation of the honor guard corps. This unit is what the 37th Presidential Guard Infantry Battalion traces its origins to.\nAccording to the decree, this guard of honor would be made up of a company of Zapadores, one of Grenadiers, one of line riflemen, one of Hunters, an artillery picket and a cavalry squadron, heavily armed.\nBolivar ordered that the uniform of this unit be: red jacket, green turn-backs, collar, and cuffs with green or white pants, and black tie; the infantry will wear hunters' cap, gold caps and alamares of the same next to the flap and turns; the cavalry, hussar caps and silver capes.\nThe government of the United Provinces of New Granada also established a unit called the Honor Guard for the president of New Granada, its uniform was the same as the one established by Bolivar's decree. According to the chronicler José María Caballero, on July 20, 1815, the unit displayed its uniform for the first time, they wore  green pants and red jackets with black bear caps. The caps had the inscription \"Guard of Honor\" on them.\nOfficial creation\nOn December 7, 1927, President Miguel Abadía Méndez signed a decree officially founding the Presidential Guard. On August 16, 1928, the battalion was given its current name, with its first commander being Lieutenant Colonel Roberto Perea Sanclemente. Memorable actions of this battalion are remembered such as the protection given to the president  during the violent acts of the Bogotazo (April 9, 1948) and during the Palace of Justice Siege on November 6, 1985. Resolution 3446 of August 17, 1955, created the medallion “Guardia Presidencial” and Decree 1880 of 1988 ruled the award merits for this prize given to the distinguished members of the battalion for their loyalty, service and good behavior.\nFunctions\nThe battalion provides security to the Presidency of Colombia by meeting the requirements imposed on it by the Secretary of Security of the President of Colombia. The Fergusson Company is the chief ceremonial unit in the battalion, being in charge of providing an Honor Guard during military ceremonies such as parades, state visits, and funeral honors. On select days at the Casa de Nariño, the public can witness the flag lowering and raising ceremony in the afternoon performed by the battalion's personnel. The other 4 companies are solely responsible for the logistical security of the head of state. It reports to the 13th Brigade part of the 5th Division's and is periodically deployed in wartime and in situations of social unrest, but mostly in the security of the President of Colombia and his/her family.\nChanging of the Guard\nThe Changing of the Guard (Cambio de guardia) is a 105 year old traditional military parade of the battalion that takes place on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays at 4 PM (COT) in the central square (Plaza de Armas) of the Casa de Nariño. It marks the changing of the security command at the palace. The changing of the guard involves the Fergusson Company and the battalion's military band and corps of drums.\nComposition\n.
