He was among the leading military commanders of the Hongwu Emperor, the first emperor of the Ming.\nBiography\nDeng Yu was born on 17 March 1337 in Hong County, located in central China (present-day Si County, Suzhou, Anhui). He was one of the commoners from Anhui who joined the Red Turban Rebellion against the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty, which ruled China at the time. By the mid-1350s, he had joined forces with Zhu Yuanzhang (the future Hongwu Emperor), who was a general of the rebel state of Song. Deng participated in the Zhu's conquest of inland Zhejiang in 1358. He then went on to serve in Jiangxi, where Zhu was attempting to conquer the state of Han.\nIn early 1362, Deng was in command of the garrison in Nanchang, an important city in Jiangxi. In April of that year, the city was unexpectedly attacked by Zhu Cong and Kang Tai, former Han generals who had defected to Zhu Yuanzhang's side but had now returned to the Han side. The attack was successful, as Zhu and Kang's artillery destroyed the city walls and their infantry stormed in. Deng had no choice but to flee. A month later, Nanchang was recaptured by Xu Da's troops, who had been recalled from the siege of Wuchang. Zhu Wenzheng was appointed as the new commander of the city, with Deng serving as his deputy. The garrison was reinforced and the city was fortified.\nThe careful preparation paid off when the city was besieged by a Han army in June 1363. Nanchang successfully held out until Zhu Yuanzhang arrived in late August and won the war at the Battle of Lake Poyang. In October 1363, Zhu sent Deng (along with Li Shanchang) to command the defense of Nanjing. The following year, Deng participated in the pacification of Jiangxi. After Zhu Wenzheng was dismissed in February 1365, Deng took command of Nanchang with the rank of junior administrator of the branch secretariat of Jiangxi. Three months later, he was transferred to Huguang, where he oversaw the demobilization of former Han soldiers and their conversion into soldier-peasants.\nIn November 1367, he was appointed right censor-in-chief, and in February 1368, he was included among the tutors of the heir to the throne. In early 1368, Zhu Yuanzhang declared himself emperor, named his state the Ming, and appointed his eldest son Zhu Biao as his heir.\nIn February 1368, Deng launched attacks on Yuan positions in southern Henan and successfully cleared the adjacent areas of Shanxi by 1369. In early 1370, under the leadership of Xu, he marched from Xi'an against the Mongol army led by Köke Temür. Deng emerged victorious, driving Köke Temür back into Mongolia and capturing 84,000 enemy soldiers.\nIn December 1370, he was granted the title of Duke of Wei, ranking sixth among those who were also awarded titles. The following year, he was responsible for overseeing the supply of troops for the attack on Sichuan. In 1372, he led the army in suppressing rebellions in Huguang and Guangxi. After successfully completing this task, he was given the task of conquering Tibet in February 1373. However, in early 1374, Xu and Tang He suffered defeats at the hands of the Mongols in the north, leading to him being appointed as one of Xu Da's deputies on the northern border. Later that year, he was transferred to Shaanxi, where he oversaw the construction of military farms.\nDeng did not take to the field until 1377, when he, along with Mu Ying as his deputy, marched against the rebellious Tibetans. The Chinese penetrated deep into Tibetan territory at Lake Koko Nor and reached the Kunlun Mountains, defeating the enemy and capturing a large number of cattle and horses.\nOn his way back to the capital, he died in Shouchun, Anhui on 9 December 1377. The Emperor honored Deng's contributions to the state by granting him the posthumous title of Prince of Ninghe and the posthumous name of Wushun.\nDeng was survived by five sons. His eldest son, Deng Zhen, who was an officer, became the Duke of Shen () in 1380. He was executed in 1390 at the age of twenty-two on false charges of belonging to the Li Shanchang clique. The title was inherited by his adopted son, Deng Yuan, who was the son of his younger brother, Deng Ming. The Deng family lost their ducal title during the Yongle era, but they continued to serve in the military. In 1532, they were granted the title of Marquis of Dingyuan. The last marquis died in 1644 during the fall of Beijing.\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n**\n**"
