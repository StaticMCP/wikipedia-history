The Borough contains over 30 parks, 24 playgrounds, sports grounds and open spaces. There are also over 20 allotments sites which are either self-managed or run by the local council. An assessment conducted in 2006 identified  of park and  of other open spaces in the borough.\nMuch of the borough's Thames river frontage is open and accessible to the public. To the north of the town centre Canbury Gardens extends to the Lower Ham Road beyond which the Dysart open space, Royal Park Gate recreation ground and the adjacent Hawker Centre sports ground form a continuation of Ham Lands in the neighbouring London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. To the south of the town centre Queens Promenade provides open river frontage as far as Surbiton. Pedestrian access to the course of the Hogsmill River leads from its mouth at the Thames, south of the town centre, to the Hogsmill River Park and beyond.\nOther open spaces include the western half of Beverley Park and the University of London Athletic Ground and the BBC Sports Ground, Motspur Park.\nHistorically, the southern tip of Richmond Park fell within the borough boundaries but it was incorporated into Richmond upon Thames in 1994.\nThe local authority's approach to managing its parks and open spaces are set out in its Green Spaces strategy, 2015–2021.\nThe main parks and open spaces managed by Kingston upon Thames Borough Council are:\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Name!!Locality!!Notes\n|-\n|Alexandra Recreation Ground||Surbiton||\n|-\n|Athelstan Recreation Ground||Kingston||\n|-\n|Barton Green||New Malden||\n|-\n|Beverley Park||New Malden||\n|-\n|Blagdon Road Recreation Ground||New Malden||\n|-\n|Canbury Gardens||Canbury||\n|-\n|Castle Hill Local Nature Reserve||Chessington||\n|-\n|Churchfields Recreation Ground||Chessington||\n|-\n|Claremont Crescent Gardens||Surbiton||\n|-\n|Cromwell Open Space||New Malden||\n|-\n|Dickerage Recreation Ground||New Malden||\n|-\n|Dysart open space||Canbury||Contiguous part of Ham Lands\n|-\n|Elmbridge Meadows||Berrylands||Hogsmill Valley\n|-\n|Elm Road Recreation Ground||Kingston||\n|-\n|Fairfield Recreation Ground||Kingston||\n|-\n|Fishponds Park||Surbiton||\n|-\n|Green Lane Recreation Ground||New Malden||Hogsmill Valley\n|-\n|King Edwards Recreation Ground||Chessington||\n|-\n|King George's recreation Ground||Chessington||\n|-\n|Kingston Road Recreation Ground||New Malden||\n|-\n|Latchmere Recreation Ground||Canbury||\n|-\n|Long Meadows||Old Malden||Hogsmill Valley\n|-\n|Manor Park||Old Malden||\n|-\n|Memorial Gardens||Kingston||\n|-\n|Queens Promenade||Kingston to Surbiton||\n|-\n|Raeburn Avenue Open Space||Berrylands||\n|-\n|RAF Chessington||Hook||\n|-\n|Royal Park Gate Open Space||Canbury||\n|-\n|Rose Walk||Berrylands||Hogsmill Valley\n|-\n|Sir Frances Barker Recreation Ground||Chessington||\n|-\n|Southwood Open Space||Old Malden||Hogsmill Valley\n|-\n|St Andrews Square||Seething Wells||\n|-\n|Tolworth Court Farm Fields Local Nature Reserve||Tolworth||\n|-\n|Woodgate Avenue||Chessington||\n|-\n|The Wood and Richard Jefferies Bird Sanctuary||Surbiton||\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.goparks.london/boroughs/kingston-upon-thames/ GoParks London – Kingston upon Thames]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051031141252/http://www.kingston.gov.uk/environment/land_and_premises/hogsmill.htm Hogsmill Valley Walk]"
