Primarily a central-midfielder, Harhys is also capable of playing as a defensive-midfielder, centre-back and occasionally as a right-back.\nHe is the younger brother of Ryhan Stewart, who is also a professional footballer currently playing for Kanchanaburi Power.\nClub career\nYoung Lions\nHaryhs signed for Young Lions in 2020. He made his professional debut on 1 March 2020 in a 1–4 lost against Hougang United. He was named in Goal Singapore's NxGn 2020 list shortly after his first appearance at senior level. Throughout the 2023 Singapore Premier League season, he was named the club captain after actual captain, Jacob Mahler moved to Madura United.\nBG Pathum United\nOn 18 January 2024, Haryhs sealed his first overseas move by signing a one-and-a-half-year contract with Thai League 1 club, BG Pathum United in which saw him move on loan to fellow league side Chiangrai United.\nLoan to Chiangrai United\nOn 18 January 2024, Stewart joined Chiangrai United until the end of the 2023–24 Thai League 1 season in June. He made his official debut coming on as a substitute during a league match against Uthai Thani in a 1–1 draw on 11 February.

This move meant that Harhys would be playing in Europe for the first time in his career, and also making him the first Singaporean to play for a Kosovar team.

He scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 defeat to Rayong on 27 September.\nInternational career\nOn 21 March 2024, Harhys made his debut for Singapore in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification match against China.\nPersonal life\nHarhys was born in Singapore to a Welsh British father and a Malay Singaporean mother.
