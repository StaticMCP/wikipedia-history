      "text": "# African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund\n\nThe African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund is a program formed in 2017 to aid stewards of Black cultural sites throughout the nation in preserving both physical landmarks, their material collections and associated narratives. It was organized under the auspices of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The initiative which awards grants to select applicants and advocates of Black history is led by architectural historian Brent Leggs. It is the largest program in America to preserve places associated with Black history and has currently raised over $150 million.\nHistory\nThe program was conceived as a means towards creating greater resilience and capacity for sensitive and threatened places that tell the stories of Black American history. Support from the fund has aided the stabilization and restoration of numerous structures and properties from churches to cemeteries, from the Harriet Tubman Home in Auburn, New York to the Cleveland Public Theater in Ohio. The Action Fund has an advisory council which includes Ford Foundation president Darren Walker, literary critic and author Henry Louis Gates Jr., educator and historian Lonnie Bunch and actress Phylicia Rashad to name a few. Donors to the Fund have included philanthropist MacKenzie Scott who made a $20 million gift in 2021.\nSince it was started, it has given grants to more than 300 preservation projects in overlooked communities across the United States.\nSimultaneously to fixing dilapidated or threatened bricks and mortar projects, the goal of the fund is also to effect social change in neglected neighborhoods. The award of monies for the reuse and revitalization of culturally meaningful structures and landscapes results in a positive benefit for marginalized residents. Restoration of the home of blues artist Muddy Waters for example is less about just repairing a house - it is also about creating a venue for other musicians to be inspired and perhaps record their own music.\nPreserving Black Churches Project\nAccording to Leggs, its executive director, the Action Fund next plans to partner with Black churches as part of an investment in revitalizing community religious centers. A donation of $20 million to the Preserving Black Churches Project was announced on Martin Luther King Day in January 2022. The gift was made by the Lilly Endowment, one of the largest endowments in the United States.\nGrantees\nIn 2018, $1 million was awarded to 16 projects.\n* August Wilson House (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)\n* African American Homesteader Sites (New Mexico, Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas, and South Dakota)\n* Buffalo Soldiers at Yosemite (Yosemite, California)\n* Civil Rights Sites of Birmingham (Birmhingam, Alabama)\n* Freedom House Museum and Virginia National Urban League Headquarters (Alexandria, Virginia)\n* The Grand Old Lady (Washington, D.C.)\n* Historic Roxbury (Boston, Massachusetts)\n* John and Alice Coltrane Home (Huntington, New York)\n* Mars Hill Anderson Rosenwald School (Marshall, North Carolina)\n* Mary and Eliza Freeman Houses (Bridgeport, Connecticut)\n* Mountain View Black Officers Club (Fort Huachuca, Arizona)\n* Shockoe Bottom (Richmond, Virginia)\n* South Side Community Art Center (Chicago, Illinois)\n* Tuskegee University Rosenwald School Program (Tuskegee, Alabama)\n* Weeksville's Hunterfly Row Houses (Brooklyn, New York)\n* Wilfandel Clubhouse (Los Angeles, California)\nIn 2019, $1.6 million was awarded to 22 projects and funding came through the Mellon Foundation.\n* African Meeting House (Boston, Massachusetts)\n* Alabama Historical Commission (Alabama)\n* Clinton African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church (Great Barrington, Massachusetts)\n* Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church (Charleston, South Carolina)\n* Emmett and Mamie Till Interpretive Center (Sumner, Mississippi)\n* Explored Landscapes of Afro-Virginia (Virginia)\n* The Forum (Chicago, Illinois)\n* God's Little Acre (Newport, Rhode Island)\n* Harriet Tubman Home (Auburn, New York)\n* Historic Evergreen Cemetery (Richmond, Virginia)\n* Historic Westside Las Vegas (Las Vegas, Nevada)\n* Hutchinson House (Edisto Island, South Carolina)\n* Langston Hughes House (Harlem, New York)\n* McGee Avenue Baptist Church, Stuart Street Apartments (Berkeley, California)\n* Morris Brown College's Fountain Hall (Atlanta, Georgia)\n* Oregon Black Pioneers Corporation, (Oregon)\n* Pauli Murray Home and Center for History and Social Justice (Durham, North Carolina)\n* Satchel Paige House, (Kansas City, Missouri)\n* South Carolina African American Heritage Foundation, (South Carolina)\n* Texas Endangered Historic Black Settlements & Cemeteries (Texas)\n* Treme Neighborhood Revival Grants Program (New Orleans, Louisiana)\n* Wright Building (Deland, Florida)\nIn 2020, 27 grants were awarded totaling $1.6 million in funding.\n* Africatown Heritage Preservation (Mobile, Alabama)\n* The Historic Vernon A.M.E Church (Tulsa, Oklahoma)\n* Founder's Church of Religious Science (Los Angeles, California)\n* While We Are Still Here (Harlem, New York City, New York)\n* The Clifton House (Baltimore, Maryland)\n* Sweet Auburn Works (Atlanta, Georgia)\n* Lewis H.
