Rouvas has received in excess of 52 awards out of 120 nominations, making him one of the most awarded Greek artists in history. In addition to these recognized awards, Rouvas was also named \"Entertainer of the Decade\" by Down Town in 2009, while in 2010 Forbes ranked him as the third most powerful and influential Greek celebrity and highest-ranked singer. He was also named Greek People's first \"Sexiest Man Alive\".\nNote that this list includes only recognized awards and not polls and other awards. The list may be incomplete due to the lack of sources on Greek awards prior to the new millennium.\nArion Music Awards\nThe Arion Music Awards are the official Greek music awards since 2002, and are the successor of the Hellenic Music Pop Corn Awards which were organized by the Greek magazine Pop Star from 1997–2001. The Arions were held for the first five years by Mega Channel and now are held by ANT1. The awards are usually held in April but in 2007 were held in October due to the network change, and thus, no ceremony for the 2008 edition was held. Rouvas has won six awards from 25 nominations.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Nominated work\n!Award\n!Result\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2001\n|rowspan=\"3\"|\"Disco Girl\"\n|Best Pop Song\n|style=\"background: #ddffdd\"|Won\n|-\n|Best Male Pop Singer\n|style=\"background: #ffdddd\"|Nominated\n|-\n|Song of the Year\n|style=\"background: #ffdddd\"|Nominated\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|2003\n|\"Ola Kala\"\n|Best Pop Song\n|style=\"background: #ffdddd\"|Nominated\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Ola Kala\n|Best Pop Album\n|style=\"background: #ffdddd\"|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Male Pop Singer\n|style=\"background: #ffdddd\"|Nominated\n|-\n|\"Ola Kala\"\n|Video of the Year (Xavier Gens/Bullring)\n|style=\"background: #ffdddd\"|Nominated\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|2004\n|\"Pes Tis\"\n|Best Pop Song\n|style=\"background: #ffdddd\"|Nominated\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|To Hrono Stamatao\n|Best Pop Album\n|style=\"background: #ffdddd\"|Nominated\n|-\n|Best Male Pop Singer\n|style=\"background: #ddffdd\"|Won\n|-\n|\"Pes Tis\"\n|Video of the Year (Xavier Gens/Bullring)\n|style=\"background: #ffdddd\"|Nominated\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|2005\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Shake It''\n|Best Pop Song\n|style=\"background: #ffdddd\"|Nominated\n|-\n|Video of the Year\n|style=\"background: #ffdddd\"|Nominated\n|-\n|Male Artist of the Year\n|style=\"background: #ffdddd\"|Nominated\n|-\n|Best-Selling Greek Single of the Year\n|style=\"background: #ddffdd\"|Won\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|2006\n|\"S'eho Erotefthi\"\n|Best Pop Song\n|style=\"background: #ffdddd\"|Nominated\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|''S'eho Erotefthi\n|Best Pop Album\n|style=\"background: #ddffdd\"|Won\n|-\n|Best Male Pop Singer\n|style=\"background: #ddffdd\"|Won\n|-\n|\"Mila Tis\"\n|Video of the Year (White Room)\n|style=\"background: #ffdddd\"|Nominated\n|-\n|S'eho Erotefthi\n|Record of the Year\n|style=\"background: #ffdddd\"|Nominated\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|2007\n|Iparhi Agapi Edo\n|Best Pop Album\n|style=\"background: #ffdddd\"|Nominated\n|-\n|\"Ola Gyro Sou Gyrizoun\"\n|Best Pop Song\n|style=\"background: #ddffdd\"|Won\n|-\n|Iparhi Agapi Edo\n|Pop Artist of the Year\n|style=\"background: #ffdddd\"|Nominated\n|-\n|\"Ego Travao Zori\"\n|Video of the Year\n|style=\"background: #ffdddd\"|Nominated\n|-\n|\"Ola Gyro Sou Gyrizoun\"\n|Song of the Year\n|style=\"background: #ffdddd\"|Nominated\n|-\n|}\nBalkan Music Awards\nThe Balkan Music Awards is an award ceremony organized by Balkanica TV since 2010, celebrating the best in music from Balkan countries.
