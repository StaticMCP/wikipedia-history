Notable Gold recipients have included the Maserati MC20 (Product Design, 2021), San Francisco International Airport’s Terminal 3, Boarding Area E by Gensler (Interior Design, 2015), the Moesgaard Museum by Henning Larsen (Architecture, 2015), and Blade by Mino Caggiula (Architecture, 2023). A searchable directory of yearly winners is maintained by the organizer.\nHistory\nA handful of designers, thinkers and entrepreneurs created the International Design Awards in 2007 as a response to the lack of recognition and celebration for smart and sustainable multidisciplinary design.\nThe International Design Awards were developed by Farmani Group. Recipients of Designer of the Year or Emerging Designer of the Year are awarded by invitation to the biannual International Design Awards gala in Los Angeles, a press campaign including links to their website reaching over 100,000 design professionals, press and potential clients, inclusion in the International Design Awards Design Directory and their Gallery of Winning Work, a feature in the International Design Awards Book of Designs, which is distributed to museums and design bookstores internationally, an International Design Awards Certificate of Achievements and permission to use the International Design Awards Winner's Seal on their website and printed materials.\nFarmani Group assembled IDA as the design sibling of the Annual Lucie Awards for Photography.\nHonorees\n2007\nDesigner of the Year:\n*Architect of the Year - Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP - Al-Rajhi Bank Headquarters\n*Fashion Design of the Year - JC Obando - Fall 2007\n*Graphic Design of the Year – Volume Inc. - SFMOMA Poster\n*Interior Design of the Year – Ministry of Design – SHO U\n*Product Design of the Year – Humanscale Design Studio – T5\nEmerging Designer of the Year:\n*Architect of the Year – Orangelabs Studio – Biomedical Research Institute\n*Graphic Design of the Year – Student – Symbols to Cultivate Change\n*Interior Design of the Year – Timothy Schreiber – Evolution_Table\n*Product Design of the Year – Pratt Institute – The Min.
