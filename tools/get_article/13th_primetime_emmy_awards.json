It was hosted by Joey Bishop and Dick Powell. All nominations are listed, with winners in bold and series' networks are in parentheses.\nThe top show of the night was the NBC anthology Hallmark Hall of Fame for their production of Macbeth. It won in all its nominated categories, tying the record (since broken) of five major wins. A milestone was set by The Flintstones, it became the first ever animated show to be nominated in one of the main series categories (comedy or drama). It would be the only animated show to accomplish this feat until 2009, when Family Guy was included in the expanded comedy field.\nWinners and nominees\nWinners and nominees are listed below.\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'The Jack Benny Show (CBS)'\n** The Andy Griffith Show (CBS)\n** The Bob Hope Show (NBC)\n** Candid Camera (CBS)\n** The Flintstones (ABC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'Hallmark Hall of Fame: \"Macbeth\" (NBC)'\n** Naked City (ABC)\n** Sacco-Vanzetti Story (NBC)\n** The Twilight Zone (CBS)\n** The Untouchables (ABC)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'Astaire Time (NBC)'\n** Belafonte New York (CBS)\n** The Garry Moore Show (CBS)\n** An Hour with Danny Kaye (CBS)\n** The Jack Paar Tonight Show (NBC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Young People's Concerts: Aaron Copland Birthday Party (CBS)'\n** Captain Kangaroo (CBS)\n** The Huckleberry Hound Show (Syndicated)\n** The Shari Lewis Show (NBC)\n** Shirley Temple Theatre (NBC)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'The Twentieth Century (CBS)'\n** CBS Reports (CBS)\n** NBC White Paper (NBC)\n** Project XX (NBC)\n** Winston Churchill: The Valiant Years (ABC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'Hallmark Hall of Fame: \"Macbeth\" (NBC)'\n** 1960 Presidential Nominating Conventions (NBC)\n** Astaire Time (NBC)\n** An Hour with Danny Kaye (CBS)\n** Sacco-Vanzetti Story (NBC)\n|}\nActing\nLead performances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Raymond Burr as Perry Mason in Perry Mason (CBS)'\n** Jackie Cooper as Lt.
