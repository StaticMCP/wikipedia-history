Estimated to have been built in the 1720s, it ranks among Westborough's oldest buildings. The house was constructed along the Old Connecticut Path, a former Native American trail. Jonah Warren, a tanner who moved to Westborough in 1719 and likely built the house, also contributed to constructing the town's first meetinghouse.\nThe property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Worcester County, Massachusetts\nReferences"
