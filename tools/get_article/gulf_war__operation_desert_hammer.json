John Lee of NextGen said of the game, \"There's some entertaining play here, but it doesn't last long. The missions get monotonous. You drive around in 3D sand and blow up tanks and trucks and buildings. And that's about it. In fact, it's rare to find such an arcade-style action game on PC, and playing this shows why.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120110022357/http://strifeguidereviews.com/ Strife Guide Review]\n*"
