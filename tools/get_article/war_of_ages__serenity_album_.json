The album was released on March 22, 2013 in Europe and sometime in March or April in North America and Asia, via Napalm Records.\nWar of Ages continues to show Serenity perfecting their symphonic metal music and still keeping true to their power metal root. It also marks the first album with an additional singer, female vocalist Clémentine Delauney, formerly of Whyzdom, and as it turns out a few years later, her last. This will also mark the final album of longtime guitarist Thomas Buchberger as an official member of Serenity. Both departures were announced via their  on February 3, 2015.\nThe album itself focuses on historical figures and events, just as its predecessor Death & Legacy had done, keeping true to Serenity's historical concept. Characters stories, such as Beethoven, Napoleon, and others have their tales told through Serenity's words and melodic tone.\nHistory\nWar of Ages is the first Serenity album with an additional singer. Clémentine Delauney, who joined the band officially on January 21, 2013. makes here Serenity debut with soaring vocals, adding a very melodic counterpart to longtime Serenity front man Georg Neuhauser. The band says: \"While staying true to all Serenity trademarks such as symphonic orchestras, heavy rhythms, amazing melodic vocals and bombastic choirs, we also brought in some new elements in form of various new sounds in the Serenity universe and a constant implementation of female vocals supporting outstanding singer Georg Neuhauser.\"\nAnnouncement for official release of the album came via the band's website, stating, \"While staying true to all Serenity trademarks such as symphonic orchestras, heavy rhythms, amazing melodic vocals & bombastic choirs we also brought in some new elements in form of various new sounds in the Serenity universe and a constant implementation of female vocals supporting outstanding singer Georg Neuhauser.\nThe artwork cover for War of Ages was created by Spiros Antoniou, who previously worked with Serenity on their debut album Words Untold & Dreams Unlived.
