At the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards, it was nominated for Best Rock Album, and the song \"Guerrilla Radio\" won the award for Best Hard Rock Performance. In their year-end lists, Time and Rolling Stone magazines both named the album the best of 1999.\nThe album has been certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, indicating sales of at least two million units. It would be the last full-length studio album of original material released by the band before their first breakup in 2000 (their next album consisted entirely of covers and was released after the breakup).\nMusic and concept\nMusically, The Battle of Los Angeles has been described as rap metal, funk metal, and rap rock. \"Voice of the Voiceless\", a song referring to American political activist and journalist Mumia Abu-Jamal, references a letter written by Mao Zedong, called \"A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire\". Another Rage–Mumia–Mao connection can be seen in Mumia's paraphrased words from Mao's \"power grows out of the barrel of a gun\" when Mumia gave testimony in his trial for the murder of a Philadelphia police officer in an altercation after a traffic stop: \"It is America who has seized political power from the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian [Native American]] race, not by God, not by Christianity, not by goodness, but by the barrel of a gun.\"\nThe album's cover art was an original piece spraypainted by Joey Krebs (also known as \"The Street Phantom\", \"The Phantom Street Artist\", or Joel Jaramillo), a well-known Los Angeles graffiti artist who has exhibited at numerous galleries in Los Angeles, New York City, and throughout the United States. Phantom's graffiti work regularly uses an outline profile of a human with text overlaid.\nRelease and promotion\nThe Battle of Los Angeles debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200, selling 420,000 copies its first week and keeping Mariah Carey's highly anticipated new album Rainbow from reaching the top of the chart. It was nominated for Best Rock Album at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards.\nThe music videos made for \"Sleep Now in the Fire\" and \"Testify\" were directed by documentarian Michael Moore, who appears in both videos.\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = Entertainment Weekly\n| rev2score = A\n| rev3 = Houston Chronicle\n| rev3score =\n| rev4 = Los Angeles Times\n| rev4score =\n| rev5 = NME\n| rev5score = 7/10\n| rev6 = Pitchfork\n| rev6score = 8.7/10\n| rev7 = Rolling Stone\n| rev7score =\n| rev8 = The Rolling Stone Album Guide\n| rev8score =\n| rev9 = Spin\n| rev9score = 9/10\n| rev10 = USA Today\n| rev10score =\n}}\nIn their year-end lists, Time and Rolling Stone magazines both named The Battle of Los Angeles the best album of 1999.
