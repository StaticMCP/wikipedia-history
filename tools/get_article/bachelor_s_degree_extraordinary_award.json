It is a bit similar to the Major de promotion (\"first in class\") in France or to the Academic Excellence Award (Bachelor's Award) or the Outstanding Academic Achievement Award in some universities such as the Central European University.\nThe award\nThe Bachelor's Degree Extraordinary Award is awarded annually by the Governing Council of each Spanish university, for each bachelor's degree that the university offers (Medicine, Law, Economics, ...), to students who have the best academic records (with an academic record full of distinctions and Honours), that is, to students who are the first in their graduating class.\nAs a university award, each university approves its own regulations on the awarding of the Bachelor's Degree Extraordinary Award. The extraordinary awards will be granted by the Rector at the proposal of the Centers, Faculties or Schools. The prizes usually have an economic endowment, either in direct mode or in way of exemption of payments in subsequent studies.\nAward name\nAs the prize is awarded by each university, there may be some slight variation in the name, but most universities follow the same name.
