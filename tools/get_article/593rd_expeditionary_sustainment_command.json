The brigade was inactivated on the islands of Leyte and Luzon in the Philippines on 20 May 1946.\nIt was reactivated as the 593d Engineer Base Depot in Guam on 16 December 1948. Following a series of reactivations and redefinitions, it participated in 14 campaigns in Vietnam from 1966 to 1972 as the 593d General Support Group assigned as HQ Qui Nhon Sub Area Command of the 1st Logistics Command, earning its second Meritorious Unit Commendation and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry with Palm.\nInactivated in April 1972, it was again activated on 21 March 1973, as the 593d Area Support Group at Fort Lewis. The Group was immediately responsible for many post-support missions critical to the day-to-day operations of Fort Lewis, while simultaneously being prepared to deploy worldwide in support of I Corps, PACOM, Homeland Defense and War on Terrorism requirements across the full spectrum of Army, Joint and Interagency operations. Brigade personnel and units have supported a variety of missions ranging from SBCT National Training Center rotations, conducting the command, control and onward movement of all equipment during the redeployment of the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 2d Infantry Division, to the Japanese CALFEX while annually hosting the Washington Special Olympics.\nOn 31 August 1990, the 593d Area Support Group deployed to Saudi Arabia for participation in operations Desert Shield, Desert Storm and Desert Farewell. In addition, the 593d Area Support Group deployed on 24 December 1992, to Somalia for Operation Restore Hope.\nOn 16 November 1993, the 593d Area Support Group was re-designated as the 593d Corps Support Group. Following its re-designation, it was deployed to El Salvador for a Joint Humanitarian Mission. Between November 1998 and February 1999, the 593d Corps Support Group successfully joined with other military personnel to restore hope in that part of Central America.\nOn 16 January 2004, the 593d Corps Support Brigade deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom providing logistical support for the 13th COSCOM. The 593d Corps Support Brigade also has supported Operation Enduring Freedom by sending units to Afghanistan.\nOn 28 June 2006, the 593d Corps Support Brigade deployed again to Iraq and exercised command and control over all Army logistics in western Iraq. On 1 May 2007, the 593d Corps Support Brigade transformed into the 593d Sustainment Brigade in Al Asad, Iraq. The 593d Sustainment Brigade again deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in May 2009, executing one of the largest retrograde operations in history when it supported the 1st Theater Sustainment Command moving equipment and supplies both out of Iraq and into Afghanistan.\nOn 12 June 2012 the 593d Sustainment Brigade deployed to Afghanistan as the headquarters of the CENTCOM Materiel Recovery Element (CMRE) directing and managing base closures and the flow of equipment and supplies out of the Afghanistan Theater.\nUpon redeployment to JBLM, the 593d Sustainment Brigade was reset and converted to an Expeditionary Sustainment Command (ESC) and continues to provide logistical support to I Corps, Joint Base Lewis-McChord and the United States Army. *[https://web.archive.org/web/20140221051450/http://www.lewis-mcchord.army.mil/593csg/history.html]\n593d SB became the first command of the CENTCOM Materiel Recovery Element (CMRE) mission in Afghanistan in June 2012.\n593d ESC was officially stood up as an ESC on 27 August 2013 by BG Kurt Ryan and CSM Erik Frey.\nMission statement\n593rd Sustainment Command (Expeditionary) provides deployable mission command to support joint forces, coalition forces and civil authorities; supports sustainment, theater opening, and RSO to enable freedom of action in the PACOM AOR; and provides trained and ready forces from JBLM in support of Unified Land Operations. *[https://web.archive.org/web/20140302164236/http://www.lewis-mcchord.army.mil/593csg/mission.html]\nOrganization\nOrganization of the command is as follows;\n*Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 593rd Sustaiment Command\n*51st Signal Battalion (Expeditionary)\n*13th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion\n*53rd Transportation Battalion (Movement Control)\n*62d Medical Brigade\nOfficial website\n* [https://www.army.mil/593rdCSC/ 593rd Corps Sustainment Command - JBLM]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130517022103/http://www.lewis-mcchord.army.mil/593csg/ 593d Expeditionary Sustainment Command - JBLM]\nReferences\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090303234113/http://www.defendamerica.mil/articles/may2007/a050707tj1.html defendamerica.mil News Articles]\n*[https://archive.today/20070527130010/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Sustain/593SustainmentBrigade.htm The Institute of Heraldry: 593rd Sustainment Brigade]"
