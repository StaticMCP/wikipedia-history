Cave is on the right bank of Tskaltsitela river, the tributary of the Rioni, near Godogni village bridge.\nMorphology\nIazoni cave is carved in the Lower Cretaceous limestone, which is a riverbed material. Cave total length is 40 meters. Cave is notable for it arch-shaped ceilings naturally decorated with small  stalactites accompanied by stalagmites on the floor. Width of the cave is quickly reduced to 2.5 m  at a distance of just 10 m from the entrance and the ceiling height decreases to 0.5 m closer to the cave end section. Silty muck makes cave floor slippery and access to cave difficult.\nFauna and paleontological findings\nThe cave provides shelter to various animals. It is home to troglofauna such as Troglocaris (Xiphocaridinella) kutaissiana (Sadowsky, 1930).\nPaleontological findings of animal bones and flint tools established presence of cave dwellers of the Paleolithic Age.\nSee also\n*Tskaltsitela Gorge Natural Monument\nReferences"
