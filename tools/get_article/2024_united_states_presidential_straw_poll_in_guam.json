Guam is a territory and not a state, making it ineligible to elect members of the Electoral College. However, Guam does conduct a non-binding presidential straw poll during the general election.\nIn the 2024 presidential election, incumbent Democratic president Joe Biden initially ran for re-election and became the party's presumptive nominee. However, he withdrew from the race on July 21 and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, who launched her presidential campaign the same day. The Republican nominee is former president Donald Trump.\nThis is the first time since 2000 that the straw poll voted for the candidate which lost the national popular vote, and the first time ever that the winner of the straw poll won by a plurality instead of a majority. Although Harris won the straw poll, she only won by a plurality, due to Trump's gains with Asian and Pacific Islander voters. Guam is 33% Chamorro and 36% Asian, and just 7% White.\nBackground\nGuam has held a straw poll coinciding with every presidential election since 1980 to gauge residents' preferences and raise awareness regarding the territory's lack of federal representation.\nIn the 2020 presidential straw poll, Biden defeated then-incumbent President Donald Trump with 55.38% of the popular vote.\nResults\n}}\n|votes=13,510|percentage=49.46|change=5.92}}\n|votes=12,624|percentage=46.22|change=4.31}}\n|votes=938|percentage=3.43|change=n/a}}\n|votes=119|percentage=0.44|change=0.26}}\n|votes=45|percentage=0.16|change=0.36}}\n|votes=44|percentage=0.16|change=n/a}}\n|votes=34|percentage=0.12|change=0.19}}\nSee also\n* United States presidential straw polls in Guam\nReferences"
