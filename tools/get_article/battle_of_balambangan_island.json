The battle was part of the Bruneian–Sulu War between forces of the Bruneian Sultanate and the forces of the Sulu Sultanate.\nBackground\nIn pre-1762, the Sulu Sultanate took over Manila from Brunei. Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien was displeased. In retaliation, the Sultan sent a mission to take place Manila from Azim ud-Din I. The mission didn't arrive until 1769 and indirectly fought the Spanish instead of the Sulu Sultanate.\nThe Sulu Sultanate then despatched a force under the command of Datu Teting to attack Balambangan in 1775\nBattle\nThe leaders of Balambangan retreated to find safety in Labuan after the British quickly established a presence in Brunei. When the two forces clashed, Datu Teting surrendered the island and his troops fled back to Sulu after learning that the warriors of Brunei, led by Pengiran Temenggong Ampa, were far too strong for them to defeat.\nHowever, before retreating, his troops burned down parts of Balambangan however this was averted by Pengiran Temenggong Ampa.\nAftermath\nDespite some of Balambangan being burned down, the island was mostly safe from Sulu hands. However Datu Teting would return to fight them again in 1788 in Kampung Sembulan.\nReferences"
