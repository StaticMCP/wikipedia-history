Initially, it was restricted to Samoans, but has since accepted other Polynesians. The King Cobras have had a presence across South, Central, North and West Auckland, Hutt Valley, Wellington, Dunedin and Christchurch.\nThe Cobras have proven to be very violent and have a history of possessing firearms. They have been involved in major cases of drug dealing, including in methamphetamine, cocaine, and marijuana. In 2003, members of the King Cobras ran a large methamphetamine ring along with the Head Hunters in one of Aucklands biggest drug cases. The King Cobras have been involved in several murder cases, including that of a 15-year-old boy, and the shooting of a rival gang member, as part of a membership process.\nSee also\n* Gangs in New Zealand\n* Black Power (New Zealand gang)\n* Mongrel Mob\n* Killa Beez (gang)\nReferences\nExternal links"
