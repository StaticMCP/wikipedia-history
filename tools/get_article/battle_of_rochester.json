The Vikings entered at Medway and attacked Rochester, but were unable to seize the town due to strong resistance. Alfred arrived with an army, which forced some of the Vikings to retreat back to their ships and sail for Francia, while another group of Vikings stayed behind and came to terms with the King.\nReferences"
