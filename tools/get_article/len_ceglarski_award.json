The award was created and named in honor of long-time Boston College head coach Len Ceglarski who retired following the 1991–92 season. The Len Ceglarski Award was first bestowed in 1992 and every year thereafter.\nNo goaltender has ever won the award in league history. Only Steve Kariya, Joe Gambardella, Jacob Bryson, and Hudson Schandor have received the award more than once, Gambardella and Bryson winning in two consecutive years, and Kariya doing so in three consecutive years from 1996–97 to 1998–99.\nAward winners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Year !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Winner !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Position !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| School\n|-\n| 1991–92 || Joe Flanagan || Center || New Hampshire ||\n|-\n| 1992–93 || Shane Henry || Center || Massachusetts Lowell ||\n|-\n| 1993–94 || Michael Spalla || Defenceman || Boston College ||\n|-\n| 1994–95 || Steve Thornton || Center || Boston University ||\n|-\n| 1995–96 || Todd Hall || Defenceman || New Hampshire ||\n|-\n| 1996–97 || Steve Kariya || Left Wing || Maine ||\n|-\n| 1997–98 || Steve Kariya || Left Wing || Maine ||\n|-\n| 1998–99 || Steve Kariya || Left Wing || Maine ||\n|-\n| 1999–00 || Cory Larose || Center || Maine ||\n|-\n| 2000–01 || Mike Jozefowicz || Defenceman || Northeastern ||\n|-\n| 2001–02 || Jon DiSalvatore || Defenceman || Providence ||\n|-\n| 2002–03 || Martin Kariya || Left Wing || Maine ||\n|-\n| 2003–04 || Steve Saviano || Left Wing || New Hampshire ||\n|-\n| 2004–05 || Jason Guerriero || Center || Northeastern ||\n|-\n| 2005–06 || Danny O'Brien || Right Wing || Massachusetts Lowell ||\n|-\n| 2006–07 || Mike Lundin || Defenceman || Maine ||\n|-\n|-\n| 2007–08 || Chris Higgins || Center || Boston University ||\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Year !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Winner !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Position !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| School\n|-\n| 2008–09 || Dean Strong || Right Wing || Vermont ||\n|-\n| 2009–10 || Ben Smith || Right Wing || Boston College ||\n|-\n| 2010–11 || Brian Flynn || Right Wing || Maine ||\n|-\n| 2011–12 || Chris Connolly || Left Wing || Boston University ||\n|-\n| 2012–13 || Chris McCarthy || Left Wing || Vermont ||\n|-\n| 2013–14 || Ross Mauermann || Left Wing || Providence ||\n|-\n| 2014–15 || Michael Sit || Center || Boston College ||\n|-\n| 2015–16 || Joe Gambardella || Center || Massachusetts Lowell ||\n|-\n| 2016–17 || Joe Gambardella || Center || Massachusetts Lowell ||\n|-\n| 2017–18 || Jacob Bryson || Defenceman || Providence ||\n|-\n| 2018–19 || Jacob Bryson || Defenceman || Providence ||\n|-\n| 2019–20 || Benjamin Freeman || Forward || Connecticut ||\n|-\n| 2020–21 || Patrick Grasso || Forward || New Hampshire ||\n|-\n| 2021–22 || Jackson Pierson || Forward || New Hampshire ||\n|-\n| 2022–23 || Hudson Schandor || Forward || Connecticut ||\n|-\n| rowspan=2|2023–24 || Ryan Ufko || Defenseman || Massachusetts || rowspan=2|\n|-\n| Eamon Powell || Defenseman || Boston College\n|-\n| 2024–25 || Hudson Schandor || Forward || Connecticut ||\n|}\nWinners by school\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| School !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Winners\n|-\n|Maine || 7\n|-\n|New Hampshire || 5\n|-\n|Providence || 4\n|-\n|Massachusetts Lowell || 4\n|-\n|Boston College || 4\n|-\n|Boston University || 3\n|-\n|Connecticut || 3\n|-\n|Northeastern || 2\n|-\n|Vermont || 2\n|-\n|Massachusetts || 1\n|}\nWinners by position\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Position !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Winners\n|-\n| Center || 9\n|-\n| Right Wing || 4\n|-\n| Left Wing || 8\n|-\n| Forward || 5\n|-\n| Defenceman || 8\n|-\n| Goaltender || 0\n|}\nSee also\n*Hockey East Awards\nReferences\nGeneral\n*\n*\n*\nSpecific\nExternal links\n*[http://www.collegehockeynews.com/reports/confinfo.php?c=5&d=history Hockey East Awards (Incomplete)]"
