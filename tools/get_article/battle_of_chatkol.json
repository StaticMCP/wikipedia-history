The position was held by the Belgian UN contingent for 55 consecutive nights, during which time they came under heavy attack.\nChatkol\nThe small village of Chatkol (, sometimes \"Chat-kol\") lay in the centre of the zone known as the Iron Triangle between Chorwon and Kumhwa in the south, and Pyonggang in the north. specifically, Cheorwon County, , Backdeok-ri (38°-19′-39.7″N / 127°-24′-13.0″E)\nChatkol was viewed as a decisive communications hub by both the UN and PVA owing to its proximity to the railway running north-east through the triangle.\nDefences around Chatkol\nThe villages of Chatkol and Sandong-ni were surrounded from the north to east by an arc of defensive fortifications known as the \"boomerang\" on the White Horse Mountain Range hill line On the northern portion of the defensive line, there were three outposts named (from left to right) Alice, Barbara, and Carol. The first letter of each outpost denoted which company of the Belgian contingent was responsible for their defence, while the heavy weapons company defended the eastern arc of the \"boomerang.\" The Belgian command post was established at Sandong-ni to the north-west of the trench line.\nEach outpost was manned by as few as three men during the day, but at night—the preferred time for PVA assaults—this could be increased to over ten men. Both the main positions, and the outposts themselves, were heavily built and easily defensible, incorporating bunkers and trench lines.\nIn the east, the Belgian positions bordered the Republic of Korea Army 9th Infantry Division.\n8–9 March: retaking Outpost Carol\nOutpost Carol was at a vulnerable point on the far right of the northern sector of the defences, 200 meters in front of the Belgian front line. Carol had been manned by seven soldiers and two machine guns when it was overrun by over 100 PVA soldiers. The Belgians could not react to the loss of the outpost immediately as they came under heavy and accurate artillery fire from nearby PVA positions.\nThe next morning, at 06:45 and with US artillery support and smoke screen, Belgian soldiers successfully assaulted and re-took the position. In this action five Belgians were killed and 17 wounded while PVA losses were estimated at 25 killed, 40 wounded.\n13 March: retaking Outpost Alice\nOutpost Alice was attacked at 00:15, first by an artillery bombardment, then by a massed PVA infantry attack. Retreating to their lines under fire, one soldier from the original garrison was found to be missing. When Alice was retaken, patrols were sent out to find the missing soldier. By 06:00, a wounded soldier, the survivor of Outpost Alice, was seen crawling towards the front line and was evacuated to a MASH hospital by helicopter.\n7–8 April\nRealizing that a PVA breakthrough was a distinct possibility, Corporal Raymond Beringer of the Luxembourg Platoon, A Company moved his .30 caliber machine gun to the roof of his bunker to enable a broader field of fire. After the battle, the bodies of over 20 PVA soldiers were found within 200 meters of his bunker. For this action, Cpl. Beringer was awarded the American Bronze Star and recommended for the Silver Star. Despite this, the paperwork containing the recommendations for both medals were lost and the award was only made in 1992.\n18-19 April\nThe B Company was attacked, and bombardment destroyed the machine gun and position of Sgt. Willem Hullebroeck.  He left his collapsed position to take the weapon of a wounded comrade and immediately resumed fighting.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120206162149/http://hendrik.atspace.com/eng/korchatkol.html The Chatkol Battles, 28 February - 21 April 1953]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120827123641/http://www.warfoto.com/3rdsociety3.htm Cpl.
