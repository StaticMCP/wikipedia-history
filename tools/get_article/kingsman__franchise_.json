The franchise is based on the comic book series created by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons, a 2012 Marvel Comics release set in the Millarworld shared universe which is based on a concept by Millar and Matthew Vaughn. It has garnered success both financially and critically.\nKingsman: The Secret Service, the film, is directed by Vaughn from a script that he co-wrote with Jane Goldman, starring Colin Firth and Taron Egerton. It was released in February 2015. The sequel Kingsman: The Golden Circle and the comic book Kingsman: The Red Diamond were both released in September 2017. The prequel film ''The King's Man was released in December 2021 starring Ralph Fiennes. The crossover comic Big Game was published in July 2023. The films were released by 20th Century Studios, while The Red Diamond and Big Game were published by Image Comics. The spin-off film Argylle was released in February 2024 by Universal Pictures and Apple Original Films, directed by Vaughn, and co-starring Henry Cavill as Agent Argylle of Kingsman.\nAdaptations of the films have been published, and a handful of Kingsman video games have been released since 2012, although they are unavailable in the UK.\nOrigin\nKingsman (comic series)}}\nThe Kingsman film franchise is based on the comic book series of the same name, which began with the 2012 comic book The Secret Service. Three sequels, Mum's the Word, The Big Exit and The Red Diamond, followed from 2016 to 2018. The series was initially known as The Secret Service before being rebranded after the first Kingsman'' film's release. The series was created by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons. It is set in Millar's shared universe, the \"Millarworld\", first displayed when the celebrity kidnappings that take place in Kingsman Vol. 1 are referenced in Kick Ass: The Dave Lizewski Years Book Four, culminating in the 2023 series Big Game, featuring Gary \"Eggsy\" Unwin aiming to prevent Mindy McCready / Hit-Girl (from Hit-Girl & Kick-Ass) from being assassinated by the Fraternity, led by Wesley Gibson (from Wanted).\nFilms\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Having dropped out of training for the Royal Marines, becoming a stereotypical chav and being arrested for stealing a car, Gary \"Eggsy\" Unwin's release is arranged by Harry Hart, a Kingsman and his late father's colleague. Hart, a veteran spy of the secret organisation Kingsman, recruits Eggsy into the agency's competitive training programme as a global threat emerges from a billionaire, Richmond Valentine.\nThe concept of an adaptation of The Secret Service originated when Millar and Vaughn were at a bar discussing spy movies, lamenting that the genre had become too serious and deciding to do \"a fun one.\" To have the time to make the film, Vaughn had to opt out of directing X-Men: Days of Future Past, which he called \"a really tough decision\".  He reasoned that if he did not do it, \"somebody else ... [would] wake up and do a fun spy movie. Then I would have written a bloody screenplay that no one would want to make.\" Colin Firth joined the cast to lead the film on 29 April 2013. It was initially reported in 2013 that Leonardo DiCaprio was in talks to play a villain, but Vaughn denied that he was ever considered. Instead the role went to Samuel L. Jackson. Jackson took the role in part because of a careerlong dream to be in a James Bond movie. He felt that this was unlikely to come true and said, \"I felt like this was an opportunity to play a really great Bond villain.\" Jackson's character has a notable lisp, a choice he decided to make based partially on the stutter he had as a kid. In September 2013, Vaughn cast Sophie Cookson as the female lead, preferring a newcomer over more obvious candidates like Emma Watson and Bella Heathcote. Mark Hamill was cast as Professor James Arnold, a reference to his character in the source comic book being himself.\nPrincipal photography began 6 October 2013 in Deepcut, Surrey, on a budget reported to be one-third of the $200 million budget of Skyfall. The Alexandra Road Estate in Camden was used for Eggsy's home area, and some scenes were filmed at Imperial College London. The Black Prince Pub in Kennington, South London, was used for various fight scenes and the car chase. Savile Row in Mayfair was also employed as a location and the exterior of tailors Huntsman, which provided the clothes, and James Lock & Co. in St James's, which provided the hats. Elton John was rumoured to have a role in the film. Although this would prove untrue, John did appear in the film's sequel. Kingsman: The Secret Service was released in the United Kingdom on 29 January 2015.\nKingsman: The Golden Circle (2017)\nThe second film, Kingsman: The Golden Circle (2017) is set over the course of one week. When Kingsman's headquarters are destroyed, their agents discover an allied spy organisation in the United States, the Statesman. The two join forces to defeat a common enemy to save the world.\nNear the release of Kingsman: The Secret Service, Millar and Vaughn said a sequel was possible if the first film performed well at the box office, and Vaughn expressed interest in directing the sequel. Vaughn also noted that he had hoped to have Firth in the sequel, but it was later reported that Firth would not be returning.\nOn 29 April 2015, Fox announced that a sequel was in production, but that it was unclear if Vaughn would direct due to his interest in directing a Flash Gordon film. On 11 June 2015, Vaughn told Yahoo that he had begun writing the sequel's script and that he might direct. In September 2015, Millar reiterated that the sequel was in development and that Vaughn was looking for ways to bring Firth back without sacrificing the story's integrity. Later that month, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that Egerton had also signed on for the Robin Hood: Origins franchise, which would begin shooting in February 2016; Egerton's schedule was accordingly in conflict with the Kingsman sequel. But in mid-October it was confirmed that the scheduling issues had been settled between both studios. Lionsgate planned to begin Robin Hoods production right after Egerton wrapped filming on Kingsman: The Golden Circle, which was expected to begin production in April 2016.\nOn 17 February 2016, it was revealed that Julianne Moore was in negotiations to play the film's villain. On 10 March 2016, Halle Berry was cast as the head of the CIA. Her role later turned out as that of Statesman's tech support. In late March, Vaughn confirmed Berry's and Moore's casting, as well as the title, Kingsman: The Golden Circle. On 8 April 2016, Pedro Pascal was cast as Jack Daniels. The same day, a promotional poster was released featuring Firth's character's glasses, confirming his return; Firth's return was officially confirmed on 11 July 2016. Channing Tatum confirmed his casting on his Twitter account, while Variety confirmed that Elton John was in talks for a role. In late April, Vaughn said of the sequel, \"writing this was the hardest thing I've ever done.\" Jeff Bridges was added to the cast on 28 May 2016.\nPrincipal photography on the film began on 15 May 2016 in Birmingham. Filming also took place in Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden. On 13 September 2016, Kingsman: The Golden Circle completed initial filming. Additional footage was shot in London in December 2016.\nKingsman: The Golden Circle was originally scheduled for release on 16 June 2017, by 20th Century Fox, but was pushed back to 6 October. Then it was pushed up from 6 October to 22 September. The film was given an IMAX release. It eventually opened in the UK on 20 September.\nPrequel film\n''The King's Man (2021)\nIn June 2018, Vaughn announced that a prequel film was in active development, stating that the plot would take place during the early 1900s and depict the formation of the spy agency, and that the project would be filmed back-to-back with \"the third regular Kingsman'' film\". In September 2018, it was announced that Ralph Fiennes and Harris Dickinson would star in the prequel. In October 2018, it was rumored that Rachel Weisz and Brad Pitt were being considered for roles in the film. In November 2018, it was revealed that Daniel Brühl, Charles Dance, Rhys Ifans, and Matthew Goode would co-star in the film. The film would reportedly be a period drama stylistically, and will explore the formation of the Kingsman tailors and agency, with the tagline for the film being \"The man who would be Kingsman.\" In June 2019, the film's official title was announced to be ''The King's Man.\nThe King's Man was released on 22 December 2021 by 20th Century Studios. The film was originally slated for a November 2019 release but was delayed eight times due to production issues and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSpin-offs and crossover\nArgylle (2024)\nOn 2 February 2024, Argylle'', starring Bryce Dallas Howard, Henry Cavill, John Cena, Sam Rockwell, Samuel L. Jackson, and Bryan Cranston, was released. The film's plot centres on the reclusive spy novelist Elly Conway, portrayed by Howard, who is drawn into the world of spies and espionage after she realises that a new spy novel she is writing mirrors real-world events.\nElly Conway happens to be part of the Kingsman universe.\nShort film\nTBT: That Time Archer Met Kingsman (2017)\nArcher (TV series)}}\nOn 20 July 2017, Fox released an animated crossover short film between Kingsman and Archer, titled TBT: That Time Archer Met Kingsman, featuring Gary \"Eggsy\" Unwin and Sterling Archer. The short was unveiled at the 2017 Comic-Con's Kingsman: The Golden Circle panel in Hall H, following Eggsy as he discovers Archer to have stumbled into the Kingsman's secret arsenal hidden in the bespoke suit shop, helping himself to guns and alcohol. Fighting to reclaim the goods, Eggsy challenges Archer to \"the most gentlemanly of competitions\": a drinking contest, while planning to drug him via a glass; Archer instead drinks the bottle and passes out. Eggsy, insulted by Archer's behaviour, vows to go to America and \"teach them a lesson\". H. Jon Benjamin reprises his role as Sterling Archer.\nMain cast and characters\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\" | Characters\n! colspan=\"4\" | Films\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Short film\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Original series\n! colspan=\"1\" | Prequel film\n!

To have the time to make the film, Vaughn had to opt out of directing X-Men: Days of Future Past'', which he called \"a really tough decision\".  He reasoned that if he did not do it, \"somebody else... [would] wake up and do a fun spy movie. Then I would have written a bloody screenplay that no one would want to make.\" Colin Firth joined the cast to lead the film on 29 April 2013. It was initially reported in 2013 that Leonardo DiCaprio was in talks to play a villain, although Vaughn himself later denied that he was ever considered, stating that he came as close to playing the role \"as I am to becoming the Pope\".  Instead the role of the villain went to Samuel L. Jackson. Jackson took the role in part because of a career-long dream to be in a James Bond movie. As he felt that this was unlikely to come true, he took on the role, stating \"I felt like this was an opportunity to play a really great Bond villain\". Jackson's character has a notable lisp, which was partially inspired by the stutter he had during his childhood. In September 2013, Vaughn cast Sophie Cookson for the female lead, preferring a newcomer over more obvious candidates like Emma Watson and Bella Heathcote. Mark Hamill was cast as Professor James Arnold, a reference to his character in the source comic book being named \"Mark Hamill\".\nMillar and Vaughn stated that a sequel was possible if the first film performs well at the box office, and Vaughn expressed interest in directing the sequel. Vaughn also noted that he hoped to have Firth back in the sequel, and that Strong was interested in returning as well. It was confirmed that Taron Egerton was contracted for the sequel. When asked how they would incorporate Firth's character into the sequel, Millar stated that various ideas have been discussed, including giving Harry Hart an evil brother, or perhaps turning the character into a ghost. Fox later announced a sequel was in the works, but it was unclear if Vaughn would return to direct. On 11 June 2015, it was confirmed Vaughn had begun writing the sequel, and that he might return to direct it. Principal photography was set to begin in April 2016, with a 6 October 2017 release date. It was reported that Julianne Moore was in talks to star as the new villain, and Halle Berry might sign on as the Head of the CIA. On 18 March 2016, Edward Holcroft was also confirmed to reprise his role as Charles \"Charlie\" Hesketh. Vaughn later revealed the sequel's title to be Kingsman: The Golden Circle. The plot follows Eggsy and Merlin joining forces with \"Statesman\", their American counterpart after Kingsman was destroyed by the film's villain Poppy, played by Moore. On 7 April 2016, Egerton revealed the first poster for the film, which strongly hinted that Firth would return for the film; the poster features Harry Hart's trademark pair of glasses with one of the lenses missing below the tagline (a borrowed quote from Mark Twain) stating \"reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated\". Sophie Cookson will also reprise her role as Roxy Morton in the sequel. The next day, Deadline reported that Pedro Pascal was in talks for the role of Jack Daniels. On 12 April 2016, Elton John was in talks about joining the cast of the upcoming sequel. The next day, Channing Tatum announced on his Twitter account that he was joining the cast as Agent Tequila.\nA prequel to the franchise titled ''The King's Man was released on 22 December 2021. In June 2018, Vaughn announced that the prequel film would be titled Kingsman: The Great Game and stated that the plot would take place during the early 1900s and would depict the formation of the spy agency and would be filmed back-to-back with \"the third regular Kingsman film\". On 9 November 2018, Egerton confirmed he would not return for the prequel, however, he would still portray the character in future installments. It was originally scheduled to be released on 8 November 2019, but delayed eight times through 2020 and 2021 due to production issues and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Matthew Vaughn stated that if a sequel were to be developed he would like to see the story about the first decade of the Kingsman agency with all characters that audience see at the end. According to the Hollywood Reporter, he said:\nKingsman: The Blue Blood is the planned sequel to The Golden Circle'' and the fourth movie in the franchise. In December 2017, Vaughn provided insight into his plans for the untitled film, confirming there would be one massive new addition to the cast, though he has not decided who would play the role yet. In March 2018, Vaughn confirmed he was still working on the script for the movie. In another interview, he teased the possible return of Mark Strong's Merlin, but did not confirm or deny the rumours. Vaughn revealed to Empire that he's planning a Kingsman movie which would cap-off the \"Harry Hart-Eggsy relationship\" trilogy. In December 2021, Vaughn revealed that filming on the sequel will begin in September 2022.\nVaughn revealed that a spin-off film of Kingsman: The Golden Circle, revolving around the Statesman, an American secret agent organization, was in early development.

The game also includes characters from Kingsman: The Secret Service'', and was released globally on 14 September 2017, about a week before the film's release. Unlike the films, the game does not have graphic violence or explicit language, but it is classified a \"12+\" rating for \"mild realistic violence\". In the days before the film's release, another mobile game based on the Kingsman franchise, simply titled Kingsman: The Secret Service, was announced to be in development also for iOS and Android, by American mobile game developer YesGnome. The game is a hybrid action adventure-construction simulator, where players construct impregnable secret bases, similar to Fallout Shelter, while infiltrating enemy bases in run-and-gun missions based on the plot of at least the first film.
