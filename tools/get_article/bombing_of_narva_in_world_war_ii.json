Most of the buildings in the city was destroyed during the war, only 198 out of 3550 buildings were considered habitable. The most damaging of these air raids are known as the 'March bombings', destroying most of the city and killing hundreds.\nBackground\nAfter the Baltic States was invaded and occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940, Nazi Germany launched their invasion of the Soviet Union and the territories it occupied in 1941. German forces captured Narva in August 1941, and the town remained in German occupation until 1944. After heavy fighting during the Battle of Narva, causing heavy casualties on both sides, Narva was recaptured by the Soviet forces in July 1944, after German troops withdrew from the area.\nAerial bombings\nDuring the Summer War, German forces captured Narva in August 1941, and the city faced minor damage due to small scale aerial bombing raids by the Soviet Union. The city would remain facing small scale air raids by the Soviet Union until 1944, which would be known as the March Bombings (Estonian: Märtsipommitamine), which affected a number of Estonian cities.\nMarch bombing and the Battle of Narva\nStarting from 25 January 1944 to 3 March 1944, a majority of the city's population was evacuated as battles approached and the Battle of Narva began. The Battle of Narva began on 2 February 1944, between soldiers fighting under the Nazi German army and soldiers fighting under the Soviet army to obtain the Narva Isthmus, which was strategically important.\nIn late February/early March, Soviet command planned multiple air raids on Narva, and other Estonian cities, including Estonia's capital, Tallinn. Narva experienced these air raids on March 6, 7, and 8, causing major infrastructural and civilian/soldier casualties. Around 100 Soviet bombers participated in these aerial raids on Narva. These air raids that affected cities in Estonia was known as the March Bombings. The city was further damaged during the battle from artillery shelling by both sides.\nNarva was bombed again on 25 July 1944, and the city was recaptured by Soviet forces on 26 July 1944, as part of the Narva offensive after German troops withdrew from the area.\nAir raids 1941-1944\nNarva experienced multiple air raids from 1941-1944:\n1941\nNarva experienced around 30 air raids in late 1941.

Only a few structures were restored; the Narva Town Hall and the Hermann Castle.\nHuman casualties\nCivilian casualties were fairly low, due to the evacuation which evacuated 85% of the city's population. Around 900 people died during the actual air raids during 1944. In 1939, Narva's total population measured 22,400, but in 1945, the city's population measured ~6,600. This significant decrease is mainly due to evacuations, but also due to deportations, refugees, relocations, and other deaths during the war.\nSee also\n* Bombing of Tallinn in World War II\n* Battle of Narva\n* Estonia in World War II\nReferences"
