After arriving in the United States, his talent (and a somewhat difficult nature) was discovered and Irishman Kevin Babington took over the reins shortly thereafter. Since then, Carling King was eighth in the World Equestrian Games in Jerez, Spain 2002, won multiple international Nation's Cups in 2003, and was the 2001 Samsung Nation's Cup leading horse. Kevin and Carling King placed 4th individually at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. After winning several major Grand Prix competitions in 2004, King was sidelined with an injury to one of his ligaments but has since returned to competition successfully.\nBefore his arrival in the US, \"King\", as he was nicknamed, was crowned the 5 year-old champion at the prestigious RDS Dublin Horse Show with rider Michael Buckley. The class was renamed in his honor as the \"Carling King Five Year Old National Championship\".\nKing was famous for his incredible consistency in competition and his stylish technique. Although most of his grooms managed to find a softer side, he was known for being somewhat tough and would, on occasion, bite the arm of those not paying enough attention.\nCarling King was officially retired on 9 March 2007 at the age of 16. He was euthanized on 16 February 2014.\nReferences\n*[http://www.irishdraught.ie Irish Draught Society]\n*[http://www.irishhorseboard.com Irish Horse Board] – Ireland's Sport Horse Studbook\nExternal links\n*[http://www.jamd.com/image/g/51203847 Photo of Carling King and Kevin Babington competing at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece.]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101103185807/http://www.kevinbabington.com/about-kevin KevinBabington.com - About Kevin Babington]"
