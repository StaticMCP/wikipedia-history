Incumbent President Bill Clinton did not appear on the ballot allowing for a minor candidate, Roland Riemers, to win the primary.\nClinton refused to contest the election due to the North Dakota Democratic-Nonpartisan League violating national party rules by holding its presidential primary too early and allowing non-Democrats to vote in that Primary.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:0.2em 0.4em;\" |1996 North Dakota Democratic presidential primary\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" |Candidate\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Roland Riemers\n|656\n|41.36%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Lyndon LaRouche\n|547\n|34.49%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Vernon Clemenson\n|383\n|24.15%\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n!Total\n!1,586\n!100%\n|}\nReferences"
