It was ported to the MS-DOS and Commodore 64.\nGameplay\nDino Wars is a strategy game where the objective is to either capture the egg from the opposing side or to eliminate all units from the opponent army. The game can be played against the computer or another human. There are five environments available: desert, jungle, river, volcanic, and chess. Each side consists of 17 dinosaurs (9 in the Commodore 64 version). There are eight different dinosaurs, each having different statistics that affect their combat ability (e.g. strength, agility, armor). The units move on a grid and when two units occupy the same grid space, a battle occurs on a separate screen. The battle is depicted as a one-on-one fighting game, each dinosaur has a health meter which needs to be depleted in order to win the fight. The battle mode can be played on its own without the strategy part. The game also includes an encyclopedia which contains educational information about dinosaurs and related concepts.\nReception\n| AmAction = 70%\n| AmPower = 45%\n| JS = 55%\n| TILT = 12/20\n| VGCE = 8/10\n| rev1 = '\n| rev1Score = 87%\n| rev2 = '\n| rev2Score = 73%\n| rev3 = '\n| rev3Score = 5/5\n| rev4 = '\n| rev4Score = 39% (Amiga)8% (C64)\n}}\nComputer Gaming World compared the game to Archon (1983) and Beast War (1985). They liked the graphics but disliked the game mechanics in both action and strategy phases. VideoGames & Computer Entertainment called the graphics and sound \"excellent\" and it was noted as \"the best dinosaur game ever\". Amiga Action called the gameplay poor and said the game is aimed more for younger people than the hardcore gamers. Amiga Power said the action part has too few moves available and called the game design too simplistic.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://amiga.abime.net/games/view/dino-wars Dino Wars] at the Hall of Light\n*[https://www.lemon64.com/game/dino-wars Dino Wars] at Lemon64"
