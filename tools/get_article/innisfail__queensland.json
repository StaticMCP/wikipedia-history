The town was originally called Geraldton until 1910. In the , the town of Innisfail had a population of 7,173 people, while the locality of Innisfail (the town's centre) had a population of 1,091 people.\nInnisfail is the largest township of the Cassowary Coast Region and is known for its sugar and banana industries, as well as for being one of Australia's wettest towns. In March 2006, Innisfail gained worldwide attention when Tropical Cyclone Larry passed over, causing extensive damage.\nGeography\nInnisfail's town centre is situated at the junction of the Johnstone River and South Johnstone River, approximately  from the coast. It is located near large tracts of old-growth tropical rainforest surrounded by vast areas of extensive farmlands. Queensland's highest mountain, Mount Bartle Frere, part of Australia's Great Dividing Range, is  to the north.\nThe town's central business district is in the vicinity of Edith Street and Rankin Street ().\nClimate\nHowe St. in East Innisfail is commonly affected by even minor flooding\nInnisfail experiences a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen: Af) and has no month with an average temperature below  or with less than  of rainfall. However, as a trade-wind climate that experiences frequent cyclones, it is not equatorial. Consistently, humid, very warm to hot weather dominates in Innisfail. In particular Innisfail is reputed as being among the wettest towns in Australia. Babinda,  north of Innisfail is generally considered to be the wettest.\nUnlike most of tropical Australia, the southern winter or \"dry\" season is not completely dry as moist easterly winds bring frequent showers; rainfall is, however, still far lower than during the southern summer. Monthly totals of over  are common in the region between January and April and some months will not experience a day without rain if the monsoon is unusually heavy. The town gets around 63.5 clear days per year.\nDuring the summer \"cyclone season\", Innisfail is frequently under threat from tropical cyclones developing in the Coral Sea. High rainfall associated with these storms, combined with Innisfail's riverside location often causes flooding.\nClimate data is taken from Innisfail weather station, which has recorded rainfall since 1881 and temperature since 1908. Meanwhile, sun data was borrowed from the South Johnstone EXP weather station, 9.7 km SW of Innisfail.\n(1965-1999 sun, sourced from South Johnstone EXP weather station, 9.7 km away)\n| source =\n| collapsed = Yes\n}}\nHistory\nPrior to European settlement the Innisfail area was occupied by five separate societies of the Mamu people. These Aboriginal people followed migratory lifestyles in the rainforest and traversed rivers in string-bark canoes.\nThe first arrival of European people came in January 1872 when survivors of the shipwreck, the \"Maria\" arrived on the coastal areas surrounding what is now the Johnstone River. Sub-Inspector Robert Arthur Johnstone of the Native Police came with the intention of rescuing remaining survivors and collectively punishing Aboriginals thought to have killed a number of the shipwrecked crew. In mid 1873, Johnstone returned to the area as part of another punitive mission and ventured further upriver between what is today Flying Fish Point and Coquette Point. Johnstone wrote very highly of the area, stating:\nIn October 1873, Johnstone again returned as part of the Northeast Coast Expedition led by the explorer George Elphinstone Dalrymple. British settlement was first established at the junction of the north and south branches of the Johnstone River by this expedition on 5 October 1873. It was named '''Nind's Camp''' after Philip Henry Nind who accompanied the party.\nLater in 1879, Irishman Thomas Henry Fitzgerald arrived in the area to establish a sugar industry at his Innisfail Estate (now the locality of that name). He was accompanied by large numbers of Kanaka South Sea Islanders workers accompanied by smaller numbers of Irish labourers.  The house built by Fitzgerald and thus the first establishment in the area was called Innisfallen, after the largest island in the Lakes of Killarney, Ireland.  (island of destiny) is an ancient Irish name for Ireland itself. The name is used in the rarely sung third verse of \"The Soldier's Song\", the Irish national anthem. The stone mentioned may be the stone at Tara, County Meath, at which high kings of Ireland were crowned.\nFrom 1879, the settlement was named Geraldton (officially in July 1883) by Fitzgerald, but on 20 August 1910 it was renamed \"Innisfail\" to avoid confusion with the town of the same name in Western Australia. It was Margaret-Mary Noone a long time resident of the area who suggested the name Innisfail as a way to honour T.H Fitzgerald's pioneering efforts and Ireland\nJohnstone River Post Office opened on 1 November 1882 (a receiving office had been open from 1880), was renamed Geraldton two months later and Innisfail in 1910.\nThe settlers who moved into this region from 1889 were exceptionally diverse. The first influential group were Anglo-Celtic, but they were outnumbered by \"Kanaka \" South Sea Islanders. Aboriginal and Torres Strait workers, Chinese miners who developed the banana industry and retail businesses. French merchants, and German timber and sugar producers.\nIn May 1885, the Queensland Government called for tenders to build the Geraldton Hospital to replace the existing tent hospital; however, the tenders submitted were more expensive than the government was willing to pay, so they called again for tenders in September 1885 resulting in a contract with E. Couchman for £1527.\nGeraldton Provisional School opened on 18 July 1887 in the present-day Anzac Memorial Park on the corner of the Bruce Highway and Ernest Street () with an initial enrolment of 15 boys and 13 girls under head teacher Thomas Edward White. On 1 August 1894, it became Geraldton State School. On 21 January 1908, the school relocated to Emily Street. On 8 April 1913, the name was changed to Innisfail State School to reflect the renaming of the town. The original school site is commemorated with a plaque laid on 4 July 1987.\nThe Innisfail Parish within the Roman Catholic Vicariate Apostolic of Cooktown (now the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cairns) was established in 1898. It is now merged with the Mourilyian and South Johnstone parishes.\nSacred Heart Catholic School opened on 2 November 1902 with an enrolment of 42 students. It was operated by the Sisters of the Good Samaritan. It was renamed Good Counsel Catholic Primary School in 1975. When the Sisters were no longer able to lead the school, it was briefly led by the Marist Brothers until the first lay principal was appointed in 1982. The Sisters withdrew from teaching in the school in 1990.\nIn 1906, Patrick Leahy established the Johnstone River Advocate newspaper, with the first issue published in December that year. Later it was renamed the Johnstone River Advocate and Innisfail News, the Evening Advocate, and the Innisfail Chronicle. The newspaper continues to be published as the Innisfail Advocate.\nIn June 1912 there was a meeting that resulted in the creation of the Johnstone River Agricultural Association with the intention to hold their first agricultural show that same year. The first show was held on Friday 11 and Saturday 12 October 1912 in recreation ground (now Callender Park) with exhibits in the Shire Hall and the Oddfellows Hall. In 1935 the show needed more space and the present showgrounds were established (in present-day Goondi Hill) with purpose-built buildings and a show ring. The show was held annually apart from 1942 and 1942 when, due to World War II, the army was using the showground. In 1986 many of the showgound's buildings were badly damaged by Cyclone Winifred with further damage sustained during Cyclone Larry in 2006. In 2002 the show introduced a banana packing competition which was very popular.\nThe first Methodist church in Innisfail was completed about October 1913; a Methodist  home missionary had been stationed from 1911. The church was at 61 Rankin Street (), opposite the Catholic church.\nA huge cyclone swept through Innisfail on 10 March 1918, causing immense damage and killing many people. Buildings destroyed included the Anglican Church and the Methodist Church. So many buildings were severely damaged, that many new buildings were erected after the cyclone using concrete rather than the more traditional timber with tin roof. As Art Deco architecture was popular at that time, many of the new buildings were built in the Art Deco style. As a result, Innisfail is now considered one of the best Australian towns for Art Deco and Streamline Moderne architecture.\nThe 1920s and 1930s saw the beginning of a major period of settlement by Italian immigrants and noteworthy populations from Greece and Malta. Later in this period populations from Yugoslavia, India and the Philippines would also settle in the area.\nOn Sunday 1 July 1928, Bishop John Heavey officially opened and blessed the new Catholic presbytery, built of reinforced concrete to protect it from cyclones, after the Catholic church and associated buildings were all destroyed in the cyclone of 1918. Heavey returned some week later to officially open and bless the new Mother of Good Counsel Catholic Church which cost £20,000 and was described as the largest Catholic church in Queensland outside of its capital Brisbane.\nOn 31 March 1931, a civic reception was held for an international Cricket Team which was followed by a tree planting ceremony where a number of palm trees were planted commemorate the visit to Innisfail by the team.  Among the team was cricketer, Sir Donald Bradman. Donald Bradman was part of the international team, led by New South Wales Captain, Alan Kippax in 1931.  These palms still stand in the town centre.\nOn Sunday 10 November 1935, a Greek Orthodox Church was opened and dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin (also known as the Dormition of Our Lady) by Archbishop Timotheos, the Greek Orthodox Archbishop for Australia and Oceania, in the presence of 300 people. It was the second Greek Orthodox Church to be built in Queensland and the sixth to be built in Australia, but the first to be built outside of an Australian capital city. The brick church cost £1,000. The church began to deteriorate and local builder Mick Kremastos re-built the church in 1970.\nInnisfail East State School opened on 3 February 1936.\nInnisfail State High School opened on 24 January 1955 and operated until the end of 2009 at 2 Stitt Street (Mighell, ). In 2010,  it was amalgamated with the Innisfail Inclusive Education Centre (a special education facility) and Tropical North Queensland TAFE (Innisfail Campus) to form Innisfail State College using the site of the TAFE campus at Innisfail Estate. Innisfail State High School's website was archived.\nOn 3 July 1970, Innisfail State School introduced a special education program called Opportunity Classes. In 1980 these were replaced by the opening of Innisfail Special School on 29 January 1980. On 7 March 2003 the school was renamed Innisfail Inclusive Education Centre. In 2010 it was amalgamated into the Innisfail State College.\nRadiant Life Christian College opened on 13 February 1982 and closed on 1 November 1991.\nIn 2001, Los Angeles band Sugar Ray filmed part of their music DVD \"Music in High Places\" at the Johnstone Crocodile Farm in Innisfail.\nThe Innisfail War Memorial in Jack Fossey Park on Fitzgerald Esplanade was dedicated on 16 April 2005; it commemorates those who served in all wars.Innisfail Banana crops devastated by Cyclone Larry|alt=\nInnisfail suffered extensive damage in 2006 due to tropical Cyclone Larry, an Australian Category 5 cyclone with over 100mm of rain in the span of three hours. It struck Innisfail at 7am on 20 March 2006, with the eye of the storm passing over the town.\nSevere structural damage occurred over the entirety of the township, the main damage being a portion of houses losing roofs and windows and the cyclone rendered even more homes structurally unsound. Power was effectively eliminated from the town and generators became a luxury in many homes. Clean drinking water was also compromised in many homes leading to health fears. The swift response of the Australian Defence Force was praised by many and the cleanup campaign they orchestrated allowed for total utilities restoration within 3 weeks. Severe damage was done to crops and plantations (mainly bananas) which had a serious economic impact on the region. Only one indirect death was record as a result of the cyclone. While Innisfail was always reputed to have a positive sense of community spirit, the aftermath of Tropical Cyclone Larry and the unified cleanup effort acted to promote this spirit through shared suffering.\nCyclone Larry was a direct and primary cause of the widely reported and dramatic surge in banana prices in Australia. Inflated cost remained until farmers were able to meet demand again in early 2007.  After the cyclone the township underwent something of an economic boom that stemmed from an influx of tradespeople and business eager to capitalise upon relatively significant insurance payouts. According to reports local trade had increased some 30 – 40% opposed to expected increases of 10%.\nOn 8 February 2007, the Johnstone Shire Council was sacked by the Queensland Government by the Local Government Minister, Andrew Fraser because of internal conflict, inappropriate behaviour and financial problems.\nIn 2011, in the early morning of 3 February, Cyclone Yasi crossed the far north Queensland coast causing damage to the Innisfail area. Although the damage was not as severe as Cyclone Larry, Cyclone Yasi still had a huge impact on Innisfail bringing strong winds of possibly 285&nbsp;kilometres per hour.\nDarlinga Forest School in February 2021 at 89 Mourilyan Road, East Innisfail. However, it was closed in mid-2023 by the Queensland Government's Non-State Schools Accreditation Board.\nDemographics\nIn the , the town of Innisfail had a population of 7,236 people, which includes the urban and suburban parts of the localities of Innisfail, Cullinane, Innisfail Estate, East Innisfail, Webb, South Innisfail, Mighell, Goondi Hill, Hudson, and Goondi Bend.
