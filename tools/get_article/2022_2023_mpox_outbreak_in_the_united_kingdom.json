The United Kingdom was the first country, outside of the endemic African areas, to experience an outbreak. , there were 2,208 confirmed cases in the United Kingdom, with 2,115 in England, 54 in Scotland, 24 in Wales, and 15 in Northern Ireland.\nBackground\nAn ongoing outbreak of mpox was confirmed on 6&nbsp;May&nbsp;2022, beginning with a British resident who, after travelling to Nigeria (where the disease is endemic), presented symptoms consistent with mpox on 29 April 2022. The resident returned to the United Kingdom on 4&nbsp;May, creating the country's index case of the outbreak. The origin of several of the cases of mpox in the United Kingdom is unknown. Some monitors saw community transmission taking place in the London area as of mid-May, but it has been suggested that cases were already spreading in Europe in the previous months.\nTransmission\nA large portion of those infected were believed to have not recently traveled to areas of Africa where mpox is normally found, such as Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as central and western Africa. It is believed to be transmitted by close contact with sick people, with extra caution for those individuals with lesions on their skin or genitals, along with their bedding and clothing. The CDC has also stated that individuals should avoid contact and consumption of dead animals such as rats, squirrels, monkeys and apes along with wild game or lotions derived from animals in Africa.\nIn addition to more common symptoms, such as fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and rashes or lesions, some patients have also experienced proctitis, an inflammation of the rectum lining. CDC has also warned clinicians to not rule out mpox in patients with sexually transmitted infections since there have been reports of co-infections with syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and herpes.\nHistory\nThe first known case was detected in the beginning of May 2022, in a British resident who had travelled to Lagos and Delta State in Nigeria, in areas where mpox is considered to be an endemic disease. The person developed a rash on 29 April while in Nigeria and flew back to the United Kingdom, arriving on 4 May, and presented to hospital later the same day. Mpox infection was immediately suspected, and the patient was hospitalised at Guy's Hospital and isolated, then tested positive for the virus on 6 May.\nIn late May, cases started to be reported in the other constituent countries, with Public Health Scotland reporting its first case on 23 May. Public Health Wales and the Public Health Agency of Northern Ireland each reported one case on 26 May.\nOn 1 June, a case was reported in Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory.\nOn 30 August 2022, 3413 cumulative cases (3,279 confirmed and 134 highly probable cases) of human mpox up to (and including) 29 August were reported for the UK.\nUK cumulative and weekly cases\n* (*) total cases =

Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said \"we're taking it very, very seriously\" and that the UK government had already started purchasing smallpox vaccines.\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) advised people who have had close contact with a person infected with mpox to self-isolate for 21 days. Self-isolation is not mandatory.\nFurthermore, to combat the continued spread of the outbreak, the UKHSA has offered doses of the Imvanex smallpox vaccine, also effective against mpox, to people having had close contact with people confirmed to having been infected.\nOn 30 May, the four main public health agencies published a consensus statement describing the principles they will put in use, with the aim of limiting community transmission.\nNumber of cases confirmed in constituent countries\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Cases of mpox\n!Constituent country\n!Case(s)\n|-\n|\n|15\n|-\n|\n|54\n|-\n|\n|24\n|-\n|\n|2,115\n|-class=sortbottom\n|Total\n|2,208\n|}\nSee also\n* 2022–2023 mpox outbreak in Canada\n* 2022–2023 mpox outbreak in Europe\n* 2022–2023 mpox outbreak in the United States\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links"
