(Declan lived in the Eastern Cloudwall.)\nHunter Aaron Randolph\nA Enforcer who is feared among the Unseen, and is the older brother of Cole Randolph. Cole convinces him to switch sides in Book 3, Crystal Keepers.\nReception\nA writer at Kirkus Reviews states, “Mull gives his protagonist opportunities aplenty to demonstrate courage, quick wit and a talent for teasing. He also lays inventive twists on magical gear and workings and crafts such oddball monsters and settings that even a native-born character complains at one point, “I keep waiting for this to get less weird, and it keeps not happening.” From the evidence, readers may consider that a promise from the author.”\nCarrie R. Wheadon from Common Sense Media stated in her review, “Fans of Brandon Mull know he needs a warm-up period with each of his series, and SKY RAIDERS is an OK warm-up that rabid fans will enjoy... But casual fans and readers who like a clear picture of where the story is headed at the regularly appointed time... will be drumming their fingers,... because the action isn't moving the story along.  Another problem with spending most of the book making this new world cool and interesting: The main character, still a sixth grader, barely mentions parents or mourns the life he left behind. The omission seems almost as strange as, well, fighting plastic dinosaurs on top of a cheesecake.”\nSimon Lipskar at Publishers Weekly stated in a review, “Although Mull packs quite a bit into this initial installment, he skillfully mixes the capricious logic of dreams with high stakes and constant danger. The intriguing premise, strong world-building, and numerous twists make this a real page-turner.”\nTori Ackerman stated in a book review for Deseret News, “While the Beyonders series hinted at a darker and more somber theme and Fablehaven stayed very lighthearted and humorous, \"Sky Raiders\" meets both of those needs for the reader in a perfectly blended mix.”\nWith regards to the audio book, an agent for Publishers Weekly stated in their review, “Narrator Nobbs projects a youthful voice appropriate to the characters in the novel. The strong narration of the more descriptive elements of the book provides a nice balance with the emotional states of the characters. However, occasionally the characters voices are indistinguishable from one and another, making it difficult to keep track of who said what.”\nReferences"
