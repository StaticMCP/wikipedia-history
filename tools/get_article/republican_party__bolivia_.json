In 1917, the Republicans ran a presidential candidate but were defeated in the Liberal-controlled elections.\nThe Republican Party grabbed power in a bloodless coup on 12 July 1920.\nAfter the revolution of 1920, the Republican party split into two factions, each headed by highly personalistic political caudillos, both of whom coveted the presidency: José María Escalier of the Genuine Republican Party (Escalieristas), and Bautista Saavedra of the Republican Socialist Party (Saavedristas).\nNotes"
