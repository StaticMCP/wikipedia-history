He is the elder son of Francis Douglas, 11th Marquess of Queensberry, and his only son by his second wife, artist Cathleen Sabine Mann (married 1926 – divorced 1946). His maternal grandparents were an interior decorator, Dolly Mann (née Florence Sabine-Pasley) and artist Harrington Mann. He succeeded his father in 1954.\nEarly life\nHe was born in London, and was educated at Ashbury College Ottawa and Eton College.\nCareer\n'Country Garden' tableware, using graphics designed by Jessie Tait on shapes designed by Queensberry]]\nHe served in the Royal Horse Guards. In the 1950s he worked in the pottery industry. He was Professor of Ceramics at the Royal College of Art from 1959 to 1983. He belongs to the Crafts Council, was President of the Design and Industries Association from 1976 to 1978, is a Fellow of the Chartered Society of Designers (and recipient of the Minerva Medal, the Society's highest award), and was Senior Fellow of the Royal College of Art from 1990, and Professor of Ceramics there.\nMembership of House of Lords\nWhen Queensberry succeeded to his peerages in 1954, he didn't become a member of the House of Lords, the upper house of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, because he was a Peer of Scotland but he became it after the Peerage Act 1963 when all Scottish Peers were given seats in the House. This right was lost under the House of Lords Act 1999 which as from November 1999 reduced the number of hereditary peers with seats in the Lords from several hundred to only ninety-two, most elected from the peers' own ranks.\nViews on LGBT issues\nAs a hereditary peer, Queensberry spoke in the House of Lords during the passage of the Sexual Offences Act 1967, which legalized homosexual acts in England and Wales. In 2016 he drew a contrast between his views on homosexuality and those of his great-grandfather John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry, well known for his role in the downfall of the Irish author and playwright Oscar Wilde.\nThe 12th marquess explained that he had been delighted to associate his family with a liberalising measure because the Queensberry name \"had become so associated with the way Oscar Wilde was pilloried in 1895\".\nPersonal life\nQueensberry has been married three times: first in 1956 (div 1969) to Ann Jones (the actress Ann Queensberry), by whom he had two daughters; secondly in 1969 (div 1986) to Alexandra \"Lexa\" Mary Clare Wyndham Sich (daughter of Rev. Guy Wyndham Sich and Jean Denise Theobald), by whom he had three sons (the eldest born during his first marriage) and one daughter; and thirdly in 2000 to Hsueh-Chun Liao (廖雪君), by whom he had a daughter, legitimated by marriage (d. 2018).\nIssue:\n* Lady Emma Cathleen Douglas (b. 1956) married 1986 Damon Lewis Vincent Heath, and has issue\n* (illegitimate) Ambrose Jonathan Carey (b. 1961), see below\n* Lady Alice Douglas (b. 1965) married 1stly 1989 (div) Ali Ugan; md 2ndly 1995 (div) Simon Melia, and has surviving issue, a daughter named Hero and a son named Tybalt.\n* Sholto Francis Guy Douglas, Viscount Drumlanrig (born 1 June 1967), legitimated by decision of Lord Lyon when his parents married\n* Lady Kate Cordelia Sasha Douglas (b. 1969) married 1999 Tom Weisselberg, and has issue\n* Lord Milo Luke Dickon Douglas (1975–2009)\n* Lord Torquil Oberon Tobias Douglas (b. 1978)\n* Lady Beth Shan Ling Douglas (1999–2018), legitimised later in 2000 by her parents' marriage\nQueensberry's eldest but illegitimate son, Ambrose Jonathan Carey (b. 1961), is head of a British security and intelligence firm.
