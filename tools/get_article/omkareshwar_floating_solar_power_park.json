Reportedly, this plan will be the largest floating solar power generation facility globally.\nIn August 2023, a capacity of 278 MW had been activated. The first part of the project started with solar panels that each generate 0.5MW and 0.4MW of power.\nIn April 2024, parts of it were damaged in a storm, likely due to insufficient anchoring.\nThe project was commissioned by Rewa Ultra Mega Solar Limited, a joint venture between Madhya Pradesh UrjaVikas Nigam Limited and Solar Energy Corporation of India. The project was commissioned in August 2024 with 90 MW.\nReferences"
