For his direction of Farlig Ungdom he took home the award for Best Danish Film for a fourth time, a record that would stand more than forty years until Lars von Trier in 1997 received his fourth Best Danish Film Bodil for Breaking the Waves.\nForeign films were well represented with René Clément's Forbidden Games winning the Bodil Award for Best European Film, and Julius Caesar directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz winning the award for Best American Film.\nWinners\nBest Danish Film\n*Farlig Ungdom directed by Lau Lauritzen Jr.\nBest Actor in a Leading Role\n* in Hendes store aften\nBest Actress in a Leading Role\n*Tove Maës in\nBest Actor in a Supporting Role\n*Not awarded\nBest Actress in a Supporting Role\n*Not awarded\nBest European Film\n*Forbidden Games directed by René Clément\nBest American Film\n*Julius Caesar directed by Joseph L.
