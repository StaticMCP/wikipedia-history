      "text": "# List of military attachés in World War I\n\n}}\nThe functions of a military attaché are illustrated by the American  military attachés in Japan during the war years.  A series of military officers had been assigned to the American diplomatic mission in Tokyo since 1901 when the US and Japan were co-operating closely in response to the Boxer Rebellion in China. The military attaché advised the United States Ambassador to Japan on military matters, acted as a liaison between US Army and the Imperial General Headquarters, and gathered and disseminated intelligence.  The military attaché's office in Tokyo usually had two assistants and a number of \"language officers\" who were assigned specifically to learn Japanese whilst attached to Japanese Imperial Army regiments as observers.  These \"language officers\" translated training and technical manuals and reported on conditions in Japanese military units.\nSelected military attachés serving with Entente powers\nRussia\n* Nakajima Masatake, Japan (1915).\n* Mitsumasa Yonai, Japan (1915).\n* Vidkun Quisling, Norway (1918).\nFrance\n* James Collins, US (1917).\nUnited Kingdom\n* Arne Dagfin Dahl, Norway (1916-1919).\n* Teijiro Toyoda, Japan (1914).\n* Nicholas Alexandrovich Wolkoff, Russia (1913-1919)\nUnited States\n* Lieutenant Colonel Karl F.
