The Blue Hens have enjoyed a resurgence in conference and national prominence in the last 2 years under head coach Ian Hennessy. The team qualified and lost in the semi-finals of the CAA in 2010 before winning its first ever conference championship in 2011. The 2011 team defeated the University of Virginia in the NCAA first round before succumbing to Final Four participant UCLA in the second round. The team's previous apex of success came in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when the Blue Hens qualified into the 1968 and 1970 editions of the NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship, their only appearances in the tournament to date.\nOn November 13, 2011, the Blue Hens earned their first-ever CAA Tournament Championship, thus earning their first berth into the NCAA tournament in 41 years. The team also clinched an NCAA at-large berth in 2013, finishing the season with a record of 14-4-1, and hosted the program's first ever NCAA tournament match in a 2-1 OT loss to St. John's.\nThe Blue Hens will depart the CAA for the Summit League on July 1, 2025, following the full athletic department move to Conference USA.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
