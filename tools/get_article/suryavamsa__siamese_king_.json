He was the elder son of Suvaṇṇapabbata (), the second queen consort of King Srisimha. Upon the death of his half-brother Surindraraja, the son of the first queen consort Suchāvatīdevī (), Sūryavaṃśa ascended the throne at the age of 25. His reign, which endured for 32 years, ultimately came to an end when he was overthrown by his younger brother, Anuraja.\nAccording to the same source, Sūryavaṃśa was married to Queen Padmavatī (), who later engaged in an illicit affair with Prince Anuraja. The two subsequently eloped, an act that provoked the king’s profound indignation. In retaliation, Sūryavaṃśa ordered Anuraja’s arrest; however, the attempt was unsuccessful. In the aftermath, Anuraja is said to have raised a military force, launched a campaign against Sūryavaṃśa, and ultimately seized the throne. Following his victory, Anurāja founded a new royal city named Siṃhapurī () and established it as the capital, thereby transferring the seat of power from Chai Nat to Sing Buri.\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nSource\n*"
