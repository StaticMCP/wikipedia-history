It was written by Luis Alcoriza.\nPlot\nA local radio station decides to try out an experiment and offers the first homeless man that walks by the chance of becoming a millionaire for a day. The fortunate man, Pablo Rojas (Adalberto Martinez), sleeps with other homeless people on the floor of a shelter.  After living a day of luxury, he returns to the shelter to tell his friends that the life of a millionaire was not much different from their own: They ate, slept and worked whenever they wanted; the only difference was that the rich had ulcers.\nCast\n* Adalberto Martínez - Pablo Rojas\n* Silvia Derbez - Toña\n* Elda Peralta - Elda Negri\n* José Gálvez - Raúl Olmedo\n* Rafael Banquells - Actor en película\n* Nicolás Rodríguez - Don Abraham\n* Óscar Ortiz de Pinedo - Director de la editorial\n* Antonio Bravo - Maître d'\n* Conchita Gentil Arcos - Dueña de vitrina\n* Carmen Fernett - Chela Santiesteban\n* Enedina Díaz de León - Puestera de bebidas\n* Omar Jasso - Amigo borracho de Pablo\n* Guillermo Cramer - Amigo pordiosero de Pablo\n* Julio Sotelo - Anunciador cabaret\n* Jorge Mondragón\n* José Pardavé\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
