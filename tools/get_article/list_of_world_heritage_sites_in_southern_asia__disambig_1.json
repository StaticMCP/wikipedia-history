Bhutan and Maldives, which are also located within the region, do not have any World Heritage Sites.\nThe first sites recognised as World Heritage Sites in South Asia were the Sagarmatha National Park and the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal, inscribed in 1979. Nepal has currently a total of four sites. Sri Lanka has eight sites and Bangladesh has three sites. Pakistan has six sites. Two sites are located in Afghanistan, both of which are enlisted as endangered. India is home to most of the inscribed sites in the region (sixth globally) with 43 sites. Each year, UNESCO's World Heritage Committee may inscribe new sites on the list or delist sites that no longer meet the criteria. Selection is based on ten criteria: six for cultural heritage (i&ndash;vi) and four for natural heritage (vii&ndash;x). Some sites, designated \"mixed sites\", represent both cultural and natural heritage. In Southern Asia, there are 53 cultural, 12 natural, and 1 mixed site.\nThe World Heritage Committee may also specify that a site is endangered, citing \"conditions which threaten the very characteristics for which a property was inscribed on the World Heritage List.\" Two sites in this region are currently listed as endangered.\n:\nWorld Heritage Sites\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n! style=\"width:15%;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! scope=\"col\" | Location\n! scope=\"col\" | Criteria\n! scope=\"col\"| Areaha (acre)\n! scope=\"col\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Refs\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Agra Fort\n|\n| }}\n| Cultural:(iii)\n|\n| align=\"center\" |1983\n|Agra Fort is a 16th-century Mughal imperial fortress in Agra.

The first monuments date to the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE and were created by the followers of Theravada Buddhism. Further monuments were added in the 5th and 6th centuries CE, during the Vakataka dynasty, by the followers of Mahayana Buddhism. The monuments are masterpieces of Buddhist art and exerted strong artistic influence in India and the broader region, especially in Java.\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ancient City of Polonnaruwa\n|\n| }}\n| Cultural:(ii), (iii), (vi)\n|\n| align=\"center\" |1982\n|Following the destruction of Anuradhapura by the Chola dynasty, Polonnaruwa became the capital of the eponymous kingdom under Vijayabahu I. Several Hindu temples and bronze sculptures remain from the period. The city saw its golden age in the 12th century under Parakramabahu I, when numerous Buddhist monuments and temples were constructed, including the Vatadage (pictured), a temple that used to house the relic of the tooth of Buddha. It declined in the 13th century.\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ancient City of Sigiriya\n|\n| }}\n| Cultural:(ii), (iii), (iv)\n|\n| align=\"center\" |1982\n|Sigiriya was the short-lived capital of King Kashyapa, who ruled between 477 and 495, after he had his father King Dhatusena killed. The city is built on and around the \"Lion's rock\", a  granite volcanic plug. After the defeat of Kashyapa by his brother Moggallana I, the site was returned to Buddhist monks who had lived in the grottoes in the area earlier. Today, the site is in ruins, with parts of fortifications and buildings preserved, as well as frescos representing feminine figures. The style of these frescos was influential in the following centuries.\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Archaeological Ruins at Moenjodaro\n|\n| }}\n| Cultural:(ii), (iii)\n|\n| align=\"center\" |1980\n|Mohenjo-daro was one of the largest cities of the Indus Valley Civilisation and was the first planned city in South Asia. Located on the banks of the Indus River, it flourished between 2,500 and 1,500 BCE. The city was mostly built with baked brick and followed a strict grid plan. There were public baths, a granary, and an elaborate drainage system. A Buddhist stupa was built over the ruins in the 2nd century CE.

There are several Buddhist monuments in the area, including statues and carved caves. The exchange of Indian, Hellenistic, Roman, and Sasanian influences resulted in a particular artistic expression, the Gandhara art. Later, during the Islamic period, several fortifications were built, and the Buddhist culture declined. Two colossal standing Buddha statues (the larger one pictured) were destroyed by the Taliban in 2001, an act that resulted in international condemnation.
