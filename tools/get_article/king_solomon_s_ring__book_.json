      "text": "# King Solomon's Ring (book)\n\n'King Solomon's Ring' (, , referencing 1 Kings 4:33) is a general-audience zoological book, written by Austrian scientist Konrad Lorenz in 1949. The first English-language edition was published in 1952.\nThe English title refers to the legendary Seal of Solomon, a ring that supposedly gave King Solomon the power to speak to animals. Lorenz claimed to have achieved this feat of communication with several species, by raising them in and around his home and observing their behavior. ''King Solomon's Ring'' describes the methods of his investigation and his resulting conclusions about animal psychology.\nIn August 2003, it was BBC Radio 4's Book of the Week read by Nigel Anthony.\nReferences\n*Konrad Lorenz (1961) ''King Solomon's Ring''  Translated by Marjorie Kerr Wilson.
