Maryland voters chose seven representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nMaryland was won by the National Union candidate incumbent Republican President Abraham Lincoln of Illinois and his running mate former Senator and Military Governor of Tennessee Andrew Johnson. They defeated the Democratic candidate 4th Commanding General of the United States Army George B. McClellan of New Jersey and his running mate Representative George H. Pendleton of Ohio. Lincoln won the state by a margin of 10.18%.\nThis was the last time that a Republican would win Maryland in a presidential election until William McKinley won it in 1896.\nResults\nResults by county\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n! rowspan=\"2\" |County\n! colspan=\"2\"  |Abraham Lincoln\nNational Union\n! colspan=\"2\"  |George B.
