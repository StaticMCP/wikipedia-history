Richard Hipp.\nFeatures\nsource tree]]\nFossil is a cross-platform distributed version control system that runs on Linux, BSD derivatives, Mac and Windows. It is capable of performing distributed version control, bug tracking, wiki services, and documentation.\nThe software has a built-in web interface, which reduces project tracking complexity and promotes situational awareness. A user may simply type \"fossil ui\" from within any check-out and Fossil automatically opens the user's web browser to display a page giving detailed history and status information on that project. The fossil executable may be run as a standalone HTTP server, as a CGI application, accessed via SSH, or run interactively from the CLI.\nTo simplify centralized development, Fossil provides an \"autosync\" mode to automatically sync changes when commits are made, in a similar manner to centralized version control systems.\nContent is stored using a SQLite database so that transactions are atomic even if interrupted by a power loss or system crash.\nFossil is free software released under a BSD license (relicensed from previously GPL).\nAdoption\nFossil is used for version control by the SQLite project, which is itself a component of Fossil. SQLite transitioned to using Fossil for version control over CVS on 2009-08-12.\nSome examples of other projects using Fossil are:\n* Tcl/Tk Project\n* Pikchr\n* MySQL++, a C++ wrapper for the MySQL and MariaDB C APIs\n* LuaSQLite3\n* libfossil\n* fnc, the ncurses-based Fossil UI experience in the terminal\n* Androwish, the Tcl implementation for Android\nSource code hosting\nThe following websites provide free source code hosting for Fossil repositories:\n* Chisel. Original site owner James Turner announced that the site would cease operation on May 1, 2013. After domain ownership was transferred on May 1, 2013, it continued operation.\n* SourceForge (unofficially through webpages hosting service)\nSee also\n* Comparison of revision control software\n* List of revision control software\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n*"
