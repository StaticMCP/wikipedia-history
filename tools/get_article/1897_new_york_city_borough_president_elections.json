The City of Greater New York, as the newly enlarged New York City was colloquially known, had been created from what had been New York City, Richmond County, Kings County (then coterminous with the City of Brooklyn), and the western part of Queens County. The city was then divided into five boroughs, which each elected a borough president every four years.\nDemocrats won the presidencies of all five boroughs, as well as the mayoralty, Comptroller, and Council President of the new city.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## 1897 New York City Borough President elections\n\n#REDIRECT 1897 New York City borough president elections\n}}"
