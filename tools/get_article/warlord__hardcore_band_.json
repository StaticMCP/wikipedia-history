Formed in 1997, Warlord was signed to Solid State Records during their brief existence. Before disbanding, the band did a tour with fellow Solid State band, Training for Utopia. The band has a compilation coming out, to help drummer Timothy Henderson with his health problems. The compilation has a new song and an unreleased track from Rock the Foe Hammer.\nIn their tenure, the band released an EP, titled Warlord, and a debut album Rock the Foe Hammer, both of which came out through Solid State.\nMembers\nLast known lineup\n* Ricky Rodgers – vocals, lead guitar (1997–1999, 2015) (formerly of Fuse of Ire and Catechuman)\n* Phil Smith – bass (1998–1999, 2015) (World Against World)\n* Timothy Henderson – drums, backing vocals (1997–1999, 2015) (formerly of Mr. Bishop's Fist and Catechuman)\nFill-in musicians\n* Jonathon Ford – bass, backing vocals (1997–1998) (formerly of Roadside Monument, Catechuman and Mr. Bishop's Fist)\nFormer\n* Brian Fletchner – rhythm guitar, backing vocals (1997–1998) (Pilgrims, AAPOAA)\nTimeline\nImageSize = width:800  height:auto barincrement:20\nPlotArea = left:90  bottom:80 top:0 right:10\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod = from:01/01/1997 till:08/01/1999\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nColors =\nid:Vocals   value:red         legend:Vocals,_lead_guitar\nid:Guitar   value:green       legend:Rhythm_guitar\nid:Bass     value:blue        legend:Bass\nid:Drums    value:orange      legend:Drums\nid:BV       value:pink        legend:Backing_vocals\nid:Album    value:black       legend:Studio_album\nid:EP       value:gray(0.55)  legend:Other_release\nid:bgbars   value:gray(0.95)\nLegend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:4\nBackgroundColors=bars:bgbars\nScaleMajor = increment:1 start:1997\nLineData =\nlayer:back\nat:11/11/1997 color:EP\nat:07/13/1999 color:Album\nBarData =\nbar:Ricky     text:\"Ricky Rodgers\"\nbar:Brian     text:\"Brian Fletchner\"\nbar:Jonathon  text:\"Jonathon Ford\"\nbar:Phil      text:\"Phil Smith\"\nbar:Tim       text:\"Tim Henderson\"\nPlotData=\nwidth:11\nbar:Ricky  from:start       till:end         color:Vocals\nbar:Ricky  from:01/01/1998  till:end         color:Guitar width:3\nbar:Brian  from:start       till:01/01/1998  color:Guitar\nbar:Brian  from:start       till:01/01/1998  color:BV width:3\nbar:Phil   from:01/01/1998  till:end         color:Bass\nbar:Tim    from:start       till:end         color:Drums\nbar:Tim    from:start       till:end         color:BV width:3\nDiscography\nEPs\n* Warlord (1997; Solid State)\nStudio album\n* Rock the Foe Hammer (1999; Solid State)\nCompilation appearances\n* \"Set Sail to the Kingdom\" on We Bear the Scars (2017)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
