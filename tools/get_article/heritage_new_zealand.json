It was set up through the Historic Places Act 1954 with a mission to \"...promote the identification, protection, preservation and conservation of the historical and cultural heritage of New Zealand\" and is an autonomous Crown entity. Its current enabling legislation is the Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act 2014.\nHistory\nCharles Bathurst, 1st Viscount Bledisloe gifted the site where the Treaty of Waitangi was signed to the nation in 1932. The subsequent administration through the Waitangi Trust is sometimes seen as the beginning of formal heritage protection in New Zealand. Public discussion about heritage protection occurred in 1940 in conjunction with the centenary of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. The purchase of Pompallier House in 1943 by the government further raised the issue of how historic buildings should be cared for.\nDuncan Rae, the MP representing the  electorate, suggested that a heritage organisation should be set up and put in a private member's bill. Whilst this did not proceed, the First National Government (of which he was a member) took responsibility of the issue and the Historic Places Act 1954 was passed, which established the National Historic Places Trust as a non-governmental organisation (NGO). The trust was governed by a 12-member board plus a chairman, and they first met in 1955. The National Historic Places Trust came under the responsibility of the Minister of Internal Affairs. The composition of the board was defined in the legislation and the board was appointed on the recommendation of the minister. The name of the organisation was changed to New Zealand Historic Places Trust in 1963.\nEarly work undertaken by the trust included the recording of Māori rock paintings, as some sites were to be submerged, e.g. through the Waipapa Dam and Benmore Dam. In 1961, the trust bought Te Waimate mission, the second-oldest building in New Zealand. In Akaroa, the trust enabled the Akaroa County Council via a significant grant to buy the Eteveneaux cottage, which serves as a link to Akaroa's French history.\nIn 2004, the New Zealand Historic Places Trust became an autonomous Crown entity. On 14 April 2014, the organisation's name changed to \"Heritage New Zealand\". Later that year, the enabling legislation—Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act 2014—was passed. There were changes in governance introduced by the new legislation, e.g. the branch committees were dispensed with. The legislation, which came into effect on 20 May 2014, also finished the transition from an NGO to a crown entity.\nGovernance\nIt is governed by a board, appointed by the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage and currently chaired by Hon. Marian Hobbs, and a Māori Heritage Council, currently chaired by Sir John Clarke. Past chairs include Dame Anne Salmond. The head office is in Antrim House, Wellington, while regional and area offices are in Kerikeri, Auckland, Tauranga, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.\nPublication\nIt publishes the quarterly magazine Heritage New Zealand.\nListings\nBuildings owned by Heritage New Zealand include the Kerikeri Mission House, the Stone Store, Hurworth Cottage, Te Waimate Mission house, and Clendon House, the Rawene residence of James Reddy Clendon. Additionally, the Clendon family papers and document stored at the house were inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World Aotearoa New Zealand Ngā Mahara o te Ao register.\nNew Zealand Heritage List / Rārangi Kōrero\nThe New Zealand Heritage List / Rārangi Kōrero (formerly known as the Register) is divided into five main areas:\n*Historic Places\n*Historic Areas\n*Wāhi Tapu (Māori sacred sites)\n*Wāhi Tapu Areas\n* Wāhi Tūpuna – places important to Māori for ancestral significance and associated cultural and traditional values\nThe historic places are organised in two categories:\n*Category 1  – \"...places of 'special or outstanding historical or cultural heritage significance or value'\"\n*Category 2 – \"...places of 'historical or cultural heritage significance or value'\"\n, the register contains over 5,600 entries. The Canterbury earthquakes of September 2010 and February 2011 resulted in damage to a number of historic buildings in Christchurch.  Post-earthquake redevelopment has caused a significant loss of heritage buildings in Christchurch.\nMāori Heritage Council\nThe Māori Heritage Council (MHC) sits within Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga and was established by the Historic Places Act 1993. The functions of the Council include:\n*the protection and registration of wahi tapu and wahi tapu areas\n*assisting the Trust to develop and reflect a bicultural view in the exercise of its powers and functions\n*providing assistance to whānau, hapū and iwi in the preservation and management of their heritage resources\n*consideration of recommendations in relation to archaeological sites\n*advocacy of the interests of the Trust and Council so far as they relate to Māori heritage at any public or Māori forum.\nSir John Clarke is the chair of the MHC.\nGallery\nImage:AntrimHouse.jpg|Antrim House, Wellington\nImage:Fyffe House, Kaikoura.jpg|Fyffe House, Kaikōura\nImage:Flag of the New Zealand Historic Places Trust.jpg|The flag of the Historic Places Trust flying outside Fyffe House in Kaikōura\nImage:Kemp House, Kerikeri, New Zealand.jpg|Mission House, Kerikeri\nImage:Stone store, Kerikeri, New Zealand.jpg|Stone Store, Kerikeri\nImage:Old saint pauls 2.jpg|Old St Paul's, Wellington\nFile:God Defend New Zealand blue plaque.jpg|Historic Places Trust blue plaque in Dunedin at the site of the first performance of God Defend New Zealand\nEquivalent function outside New Zealand\n*  – Monument historique\n*  – Deutsche Stiftung Denkmalschutz and National Heritage Sites (Kulturdenkmal)\n*  – Historic building, see List of Grade I historic buildings in Hong Kong, List of Grade II historic buildings in Hong Kong and List of Grade III historic buildings in Hong Kong\n*  – Rijksmonument\n*  – Listed building or Scheduled Ancient Monument\n*  – National Register of Historic Places and National Historic Landmark\nSee also\n*SAHANZ (Society of Architectural Historians of Australia and New Zealand)\n*:Category:Heritage New Zealand\n*:Category:Lists of historic places in New Zealand\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.heritage.org.nz Heritage New Zealand] (official website)\n* [http://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2014/0026/latest/DLM4005414.html Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act 2014]"
