      "text": "# Sturt County, Queensland\n\nSturt County is a cadastral division of North Gregory District of Western Queensland and a County of Queensland, Australia.\nLike all counties in Queensland, it is a non-functional administrative unit, that is used mainly for the purpose of registering land titles.\nThe county dates from colonial times but the current iteration dates from  the 8th March 1901, when the Governor of Queensland issued a proclamation legally dividing all of Queensland into counties under the Land Act 1897.\nLike all counties in Queensland, it is a non-functional administrative unit, that is used mainly for the purpose of registering land titles. From 30 November 2015, the government no longer referenced counties and parishes in land information systems however the Museum of Lands, Mapping and Surveying retains a record for historical purposes.\nThe entire County is incorporated lands.\nReferences"
