He also notably investigated the death of Terrance Franklin, disproving the police officers' narrative and resolving the case.\nIn February 2012, Primeau worked on the Trayvon Martin shooting case.

He said he believed it was Martin.\nIn the same year, Primeau was approached by author and JFK assassination researcher Bill Kelly, who wanted technical help in combining two audiotapes of Air Force One radio transmissions. Primeau concluded that parts of the original tape were missing.\nIn October 2013, Primeau was hired by an Orlando Sentinel journalist to analyze the voice of Susan Bennett, an American voice-over artist, known for providing the female American voice of Apple's Siri. After finishing his analysis, and the comparison of the Siri voice and Bennett's, he claimed the voices were a 100% match, thus confirming Bennett provided her voice for Siri.\nIn 2014, he was working on the case of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Primeau concluded that tape edits were obviously made. Primeau was asked by CNN to analyze tapes made by Trump attorney Michael Cohen. This included a three-minute conversation of Cohen with Trump regarding payments made to a Playboy model.\nPrimeau has also been quoted as a notable expert on differentiating & authenticating real audios from generative AI which has proliferated every field, including the legal domain.\nBibliography\nPrimeau is the author of one self-published book on audio forensics:\n*The Art of Production, Primeau Productions, 2008,\nDocumentaries and TV\nPrimeau made appearances in the following TV shows and documentaries:\n*The Proof is Out There.\n*CNN Newsroom.\n*Cuomo Prime Time.\n*20/20.\n*Contact.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.primeauforensics.com Official website]"
