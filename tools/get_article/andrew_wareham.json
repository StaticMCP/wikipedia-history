He is employed as a reader in the department of humanities at Roehampton University, London.\nEducation and career\nHe was educated at Birmingham University (BA, PhD, PGCE) and King's College London (MA). His doctoral dissertation, supervised by Nicholas Brooks and completed in 1992, investigated the late Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman aristocracy in East Anglia. After working as a temporary lecturer in medieval history at the Universities of Manchester and Oxford (1992–4), he was employed by the Institute of Historical Research (1995–2002).  His connections through family and friends with South/East Asia led to his work on the comparative history of Europe and South/East Asia in the early middle ages, partly completed while an academic visitor at the Department of Economic History, LSE and the Department of Economics, Lingnan University (2003–4).\nHe was a research associate in the Department of Digital Humanities at King’s College London (2003–6) working on the AHRC Durham Liber Vitae project, and in 2006 he was appointed as director of the British Academy Hearth Tax Project ([https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/Research-Centres/Centre-for-Hearth-Tax-Research/ Centre for Hearth Tax Research]) in the Department of Humanities at Roehampton University. In 2007 he was promoted to reader in medieval & early modern history. In 2010 John Price, Ruth Selman and Wareham established the first digital portal for the publication of hearth tax records (Hearth Tax Online, 2010). In 2019 this was replaced by [http://gams.uni-graz.at/context:htx Hearth Tax Digital], which was designed by Georg Vogeler and Wareham, and arises from a partnership between the British Academy Hearth Tax Project and [https://informationsmodellierung.uni-graz.at/en/ Centre for Information Modeling], and provides a new approach to researching the Restoration hearth tax. Users can read and search the returns with all their contextual information and in the original order in which the documents were written and search all the data across counties and returns in the advanced search function, with the enquiries providing the other names which were listed with the name being searched for. This transforms the nature of family history searches for genealogists and through the advanced search and database function provides a powerful research tool for historians.\nBibliography\nBooks\n* (ed. with H.
