There were ten constituencies, seven single-seat constituencies with elected by FPTP and three two-seat constituencies with MPs elected by bloc voting.\nResults\nThe Nationalist Party ran in this election, having not contested the previous election in 1924. It regained the two seats in Fermanagh and Tyrone it had held from 1922 to 1924.\nIn the election as a whole, the Conservative Party, which included the Ulster Unionists, led by Stanley Baldwin, lost its majority and the Labour Party formed a minority government with Ramsay MacDonald as Prime Minister.\n}}\n|gain       = 0\n|loss       = 2\n|net        = -2\n|votes      = 247,291\n|votes %    = 68.0\n|seats %    = 84.6\n|plus/minus = -15.8\n}}\n|gain       = 2\n|loss       = 0\n|net        = +2\n|votes      = 24,177\n|votes %    = 6.6\n|seats %    = 15.4\n|plus/minus = +15.4\n}}\n|}\nVotes in constituencies using the bloc voting system are counted as 0.5 each, as each voter had one vote per seat.\nMPs elected\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!
