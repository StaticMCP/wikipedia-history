She is best known for playing the role of Delia Ryan on the television soap opera ''Ryan's Hope'' from 1979 to 1982.\nEarly life and education\nBorn in Atlanta, Georgia, Edwards' parents divorced when she was 10, and she lived with her mother on Cape Cod.\nAfter graduating from the California Institute of the Arts in 1976, she acted in the theater and later worked as a waitress to buy a van to take her to Hollywood.\nCareer\nEdwards worked as a secretary in Santa Monica, California, and unsuccessfully auditioned for General Hospital before winning the role of Delia Ryan on ''Ryan's Hope in early 1979. Edwards moved to New York and played the role until 1982. She received a nomination for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her performance after a storyline where Delia ran over boyfriend Barry Ryan with the car of Faith Coleridge whom she had been driving home after finding her drunk. Her predecessor, Ilene Kristen, was a fan favorite, but Edwards, with her softer, ditsier portrayal, did manage to win over viewers.
