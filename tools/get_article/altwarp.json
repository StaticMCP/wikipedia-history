It has about 500 inhabitants and is located on the Nowe Warpno Bay opposite the Polish town of Nowe Warpno within the historic region of Pomerania.\nHistory\nFrom 1648 to 1720, Altwarp was part of Swedish Pomerania. From 1720 to 1945, it was part of the Prussian Province of Pomerania.\nFollowing the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, in 1945, the municipality passed to Poland under its Polish name Stare Warpno. After a few months, a minor territorial exchange was made between Poland and Germany, as a result of which the village became part of East Germany. From 1945 to 1952, Altwarp was part of the State of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, from 1952 to 1990 of the Bezirk Neubrandenburg of East Germany and since 1990 again of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.\nReferences"
