The 2002 legislative election resulted in a victory for the ČSSD who formed a coalition with KDU-ČSL and US-DEU. The coalition nominated Lubomír Zaorálek for the office of President. The incumbent President Václav Klaus did not intend to seek reelection because he considered it \"a lost fight\" but members of ODS persuaded him to participate to show the governing coalition that ODS was prepared to be a strong opposition.\nVoting and aftermath\nNo President was elected in the first round of voting as Zaorálek received 99 votes and Klaus received 76. The coalition government held 101 seats in the Chamber of Deputies indicating that two coalition MPs did not vote for Zaorálek. In the second round of voting, Zaorálek received 101 votes. Klaus congratulated him on the victory and said he respected the election results.\nReferences"
