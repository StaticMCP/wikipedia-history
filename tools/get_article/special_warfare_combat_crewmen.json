Their rating is Special Warfare Boat Operator (SB).\nProspective SWCC sailors go through a special training program at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, where they learn boating and weapons tactics, techniques, and procedures that focus on clandestine infiltration and exfiltration of SEALs and other special operations forces. SWCCs employ their specialized training, equipment, and tactics conducting missions worldwide, both independently and in support of US and foreign special operations forces (SOF).\nHistory\nunderway with sister boat PT-109]]\nOrigins\nSpecial boat teams trace their history to the PT boats of World War II. Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three rescued General Douglas MacArthur (and later the Filipino president Manuel L. Quezon) from the Philippines after the Japanese invasion and then participated in guerrilla actions until American resistance ended with the fall of Corregidor. PT boats subsequently participated in most of the campaigns in the Southwest Pacific by conducting and supporting joint/combined reconnaissance, blockade, sabotage, and raiding missions as well as attacking Japanese shore facilities, shipping, and forces. PT boats were used in the European Theater beginning in April 1944 to help the Office of Strategic Services insert spies and French Resistance personnel and for amphibious landing deception.\nBirth of NSW-Task Force 116, and the Vietnam War\nThe modern special boat operator grew out of efforts during the Vietnam War to develop forces for riverine warfare. In February 1964, Boat Support Unit ONE (BSU-1) was established under Naval Operations Support Group, Pacific to operate the newly reinstated fast patrol boat (PTF) program and to operate high-speed craft for NSW forces. Nicknamed (SWIFT) crews BSU-1 would directly support Naval Special Warfare Operations, initially outfitted primarily by Underwater Demolition Team (UDT) and the newly established SEALs. The schooling was in Coronado, California, and every new sailor that wasn't already a UDT or SEAL was trained extensively in boat/weapons operations, and advanced swimming to work alongside UDT or SEALs. The boat crew members underwent a right of passage similar to \"Hell Week\" by SEALs. A UDT and SEAL platoon was assigned to each of BSU-1's squadrons of Mobile Support Teams (MST 1-3). The squadrons inserted and extracted from their patrol area by PBRs. In late 1964, the first PTFs arrived in Da Nang, Vietnam. In 1965, Boat Support Unit One began training patrol craft fast (SWIFT) crews for Vietnamese coastal patrol and interdiction operations. As the Vietnam mission expanded into the riverine environment, additional craft, tactics, and training evolved for riverine patrol and direct UDT/SEAL support. Boat Support Unit TWO was initially formed in 1965 to run and maintain high-speed boats for the UDT and SEAL teams at Little Creek, VA.\nIn 1966, River Patrol Force (Task Force 116) operated river patrol boats on counterinsurgency operations in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam in Operation Game Warden. The task force utilized small watercraft far up the Mekong River into Laos and supported the Amphibious Ready Groups operating on South Vietnam's river such as Operation Market Time. These boats would insert UDTs or SEALs by patrol craft while they went ashore to demolish obstacles and enemy bunkers.\nIn July 1968, Light SEAL Support Craft (LSSC) began replacing PBRs as their primary support craft. Mobile Support Teams (MST 1-3) provided combat craft support for UDT/SEAL operations, as did patrol boat, river (PBR) and patrol craft, fast (PCF) sailors.\nOn 1 July 1971, Boat Support Units ONE and TWO missions broadened to encompass coastal/riverine patrol and interdiction. Both commands were renamed into Coastal River Squadron ONE and TWO. A wide range of small boat projects were developed and tested with the command's help. The Coastal Patrol and Interdiction Craft, the Landing Craft Swimmer Recovery Vessel, the FLAGSTAFF (PGH-1), one of the Navy's first operational hydrofoils, and the Swimmer Delivery Vehicle, which carried on the now-renamed SEAL Delivery Vehicle diving operations, were among them. After UDT-13 was split in 1975, several of its members joined Coastal River Squadrons and others contributed to the creation of the UCT teams.\nIn 1978, Coastal River Squadron ONE became Special Boat Squadron ONE. Special boat units, which were still composed primarily of UDT/SEAL personnel or specialized boat crew members, spawned four operational special boat units from the original MSTs: SBU-11, SBU-12, SBU-13, and Special Boat Detachments. The following year, in 1979, Coastal River Squadron TWO became Special Boat Squadron TWO. This formed three more operational special boat units: SBU-20, SBU-22, and SBU-24.\nIn 1983, remaining UDT diver teams underwent their final consolidation with the SEAL teams. The establishment of the United States Naval Special Warfare Command took place in 1987, consolidating the Special Boat Units and SEALs into a single command. Additionally, a new special boat unit, SBU-26, was also established during this time.\nNaval Special Warfare Group 4 (NSWG-4) was established in October 2002 as a result of changes to the NSW's restructure.\nSpecial Boat Teams 12, 20, and 22 all were established merged from various SBU units. NSWG-4 is tasked with organizing, equipping, and training established SWCC crews to assign combatant craft to the restructured Special Boat Teams to support Naval Special Warfare.\nWar on drugs and Panama\nThe United States Navy contributed extensive special operations assets to the war on drugs and Panama's invasion, codenamed Operation Just Cause. This included SEAL Teams 2 and 4, Naval Special Warfare Unit 8, and Special Boat Unit 26, all falling under Naval Special Warfare Group 2; and the separate Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU).\nDuring Operation Snowcap part of a counter-drug operations in Colombia, a Special Boat Team came under attack in the Antioquia Valley region while conducting reconnaissance operations. The boat team held off a force of roughly 150 Colombian rebel insurgents believed to be part of Colombia's counter-revolutionary movement (FARC). Throughout the three days and nights of fighting, the boat team was repeatedly surrounded and cut off from escape. Short of ammunition and water, the team held on until first light on day three, regrouped and counter-attacked, punching a hole in the insurgents defense line and later linking up with U.S. Navy SEALs and Colombian special forces. Members of the team were cited for their heroism and bravery.\nWar on terror\n]]\nFollowing the September 11 attacks, SWCC deployed throughout the War on Terror, including the War in Afghanistan and Iraq War. SWCC assisted in the security of numerous oil platforms in the Persian Gulf, as well as conducted Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure (VBSS) and reconnaissance operations. Some Special Warfare boat operators were attached to SEAL Teams or occasionally with Marine special operations as medics and JTACs. Overtime throughout the conflict, some SWCCs were utilized to supplement Navy SEALs on land functioning as their \"Engineers\" as adept mechanics, gunners, and drivers during convoys or insertion/extraction operations. SWCC were intregral in the war on terror, particularly in the Battle of Al Faw (2003), Battle of Umm Qasr, 2013 raid on Barawe and Siege of Marawi.\nFacing the growing rise of terror groups in the Philippines, the Navy dispatched special boat teams to train and advise Armed Forces of the Philippines and conduct maritime operations against piracy, trafficking, and port/waterway security. Some 160 U.S. special operators went on patrol with Filipinos in the jungles of Basilan island, an Abu Sayyaf stronghold. In 2002, a MH-47 Chinook helicopter with 10 American operators crashed during a night operation; none survived. In 2007, SWCC operated Mark V Special Operations Craft and conducted various maritime interdiction, visit-board-search-and-seizure, and reconnaissance operations. Some unconventional tactics and equipment were used, such as canoes with outboard motors, small boats, and jetskis for low-profile collection operations.\nSWCC detachments have participated in nearly every major conflict since then, notably in the Persian Gulf (operations Prime Chance and Earnest Will 1987-88, Operation Snowcap 1987-1995, the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989-1990, the 1990-1991 Gulf War and the ongoing Global War on Terror, and counter-narcotics operations in South and Central America.\nMissions\nSWCCs operate and maintain state-of-the-art, high-performance vessels to support special operations, particularly clandestine insertion and extraction and in shallow water where large ships cannot operate. In recent years, SWCC have trained for tactical driving and convoy operations.\nSWCC also perform search and rescue for combat and humanitarian assistance, help law enforcement agencies, and train foreign units.\nSpecial warfare boat operator (SB) rating\nThe special warfare boat operator (SB) rating was established on 1 October 2006, under the same order that created the special warfare operator (SO) rating for SEALs.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Senior NCOs can serve as Patrol Officer, Detachment Chief, Boat Captain, Senior Navigator, Senior Communications Operator, or Chief Engineer.\nSpecial Boat Teams are commanded by Navy SEAL officers and SWCC Warrant officers. These Officers lead Special Boat Team (SBT) operators and direct personnel in the execution of combatant craft operations, and may serve as Boat Troop commanders; Detachment officers-in-charge; or a variety of administrative positions.\nQualification insignia\nThe special warfare combatant-craft crewman insignia is a Navy qualification badge. First proposed in 1996, an initial version was approved for wear in 2001.\nOn 19 August 2016, the original insignia was replaced with three insignias that indicate qualification level: SWCC Basic, SWCC Senior, and SWCC Master.  The SWCC Basic Insignia is a 2.5-by-1.25-inch silver matte metal pin depicting a Mark V Special Operations Craft atop a bow wave in front of a naval enlisted cutlass crossed with a cocked flintlock pistol.  The SWCC Senior insignia adds an upright anchor in the background. The SWCC Master insignia adds a banner with three gold stars on the upper portion of the anchor.\nTraining\nTo become a special warfare combatant-craft crewman, a service member must apply and be accepted to special programs, complete a special boot camp (called 800 divisions) alongside SEAL (SO) candidates, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) candidates, Diver Candidates and Aviation Air Rescue candidates.\nSWCC candidates then go to Naval Special Warfare Preparatory School (NSWPS, also called BUD/S Prep) in Great Lakes Chicago, then to Coronado, California, to attend Basic Underwater Demolition Orientation/or SEAL Orientation (BO). Upon testing out of BO, SWCC candidates attend Basic Crewman Selection (BCS).  SWCC candidates go on to Basic Crewman Training (BCT); following this, SWCC candidates will undergo Crewman Qualification Training (CQT) and then go on to specialized individual schools.\nPipeline\nApplicants must:\n*Meet specific eyesight requirements: 20/40 best eye; 20/70 worst eye; correctable to 20/25 with no color blindness\n*Meet the minimum Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) score: AR+VE=103, MC=51\n*Be 30 years old or younger; min. 17\n*Be a U.S. citizen\nInitial SWCC training consists of:\n* 8-week Naval Special Warfare Prep School-(BUD/S Prep) Great Lakes, Illinois\n* 3-week BUD/S Orientation at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, California\n* 7-week Basic Crewman Selection (BCS) at the Naval Special Warfare Center, NAB Coronado.\n* 7-week Basic Crewman Training (BCT) at the Naval Special Warfare Center, NAB Coronado.\n* 21-week SWCC Crewman Qualification Training (CQT) at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado\nScreening\nTo proceed to basic crewman training, a trainee must pass this test:\n*Swim 500 yards under 13 minutes (Side Stroke / Breast Stroke)\n*Rest 10 minutes\n*50 push-ups within 2 minutes\n*Rest 2 minutes\n*50 sit-ups within 2 minutes\n*Rest 2 minutes\n*6 pull-ups within 2 minutes\n*Rest 10 minutes\n*1.5-mile run under 12 minutes\n*Pass a basic underwater demolition/SEAL physical fitness screening test in boot camp and in the delayed entry program in order to qualify\nBut the Navy says it expects successful candidates to perform more like this:\n*Swim 500 yards under 10 minutes (Side Stroke / Breast Stroke)\n*Rest 10 minutes\n*70 push-ups within 2 minutes\n*Rest 2 minutes\n*70 sit-ups within 2 minutes\n*Rest 2 minutes\n*10 pull-ups within 2 minutes\n*Rest 10 minutes\n*1.5-mile run under 10 minutes\n*Pass a basic underwater demolition/SEAL physical fitness screening test in boot camp and in the delayed entry program in order to qualify\nNaval Special Warfare Preparatory School (BUD/s Prep)\nThe two-month Naval Special Warfare Preparatory School (NSW Prep or BUD/s Prep) takes place at Great Lakes, Illinois. NSW Prep has one goal: Improve a SWCC candidates physical readiness for the grueling trials of Basic Crewman Selection (BCS). Students are introduced to the obstacle course, soft sand runs, knot tying, open water swimming, water rescue, drownproofing, and basic navigational skills. Many candidates will quit during the first three weeks. After they pass Pre-BUD/s, candidates will go to BUD/S Orientation at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, California. Here they will spend the rest of their training and the next three weeks preparing for their pipeline along with SEAL candidates.\nBasic Crewman Selection (BCS)\nInstructors of the SWCC Basic Crewman Selection course train, develop, and assess SWCC candidates in physical conditioning, water competency, teamwork, and mental tenacity. This course starts with a three-week indoctrination. The SWCC basic crewman training last seven weeks. Physical conditioning with running, swimming, and calisthenics grows harder as the weeks progress. Students abilities, mental fortitude and teamwork skills are tested during an arduous 4-day evolution involving little sleep, constant exposure to the elements, underway boat and swimming events, and a test of navigational skills and boat tactics. This test is referred to as the Crucible or \"The Tour\". SWCC students participate in weekly timed runs, timed obstacle course evolutions, pool, bay and ocean swims, and learn small-boat seamanship. Upon the completion of SWCC Basic Crewman Selection(BCS), students advance to Basic Crewman Training(BCT).\nCrewman Qualification Training (CQT)\nDuring the 21-week crewman qualification training, instructors train and evaluate SWCC candidates in basic weapons, seamanship, casualty care, and small unit tactics. In the first phase, Basic, candidates learn first aid, small arms, heavy weapons, basic combat skills, engineering, and towing and trailering procedures for SWCC boats. Candidates must pass tests in every subject to move on.\nThe final, or Advanced, phase includes communications, Tactical Combat Casualty Control (TCCC), navigation and boat handling, mission planning and execution, live fire while underway on the boats. Students are introduced to the NSW mission planning cycle, enabling them to participate in the planning, briefing, execution, and debriefing of an NSW mission. Physical training is geared to prepare the student to meet the requirements of the operational special boat teams. CQT concentrates on teaching maritime navigation, communications, waterborne patrolling techniques, marksmanship and engineering, as well as small unit tactics and close-quarters combat. After finishing CQT, SWCCs attend SERE Level C school.\nCandidates that have made it through the pipeline are awarded their SWCC pins, designating them as a Special Warfare Boat Operator (SB) rating. They are subsequently assigned to a Special Boat Team to begin preparing for their first deployment.\nFurther training\nSWCCs receive broad individual and detachment in-house training and attend schools as needed to support Naval Special Warfare Command. Before reporting to a Special Boat Team, SWCCs attend a 12-week language course, where they must learn a language assigned to them according to the needs of their respective teams. SWCC attend Naval Small Craft Instruction and Technical Training School to receive tactical boat training.\nEvery SWCC receives basic medic assistant training for combat lifesaving skills. After reporting to the teams SWCCs may attend schools relative to their respective individual specialities and or mission readiness schools such as desert survival, jungle survival, cold water survival, special operations combat medic training, naval special warfare combat fighting course, fast-rope, air assault, designated marksman school, tactical driving, and many others offered within Naval Special warfare.\nAdvanced equipment\nSWCC often go to new U.S. Department of Defense schools according to the needs of their respective team and adaptable mission set. SWCCs also receive in-house training with the latest technology, such as advanced radio communications, advanced weapons systems, advanced navigation systems, small unmanned aerial systems (SUAS), outboard, diesel, and waterjet engines.\nAerial deployment training\nSWCCs can drop boats from aircraft using specialized equipment. The Maritime Craft Aerial Deployment System (MCADS) drops an 11-meter RIB (Rigid Inflatable Boat) rigged with four large parachutes from the back of a C-130 or C-17 at about 3,500 feet. About four SWCCs immediately follow the boat out of the plane, land nearby, and have the boat ready to go in about 20 minutes.\n, 160th SOAR's MH-47 Chinook]]\nSWCC personnel can also use Army CH-47 helicopters to insert and exfiltrate their boats, using slings dubbed the Maritime External Air Transportation System (MEATS).\nRisks\nIn November 2024, The New York Times published reporting on the prevalence of chronic brain trauma among members of the Navy's Special Boat Teams. The investigation revealed that medical professionals were warning about the risk of brain injuries during missions, including warnings that boat crews could be subjected to sudden \"jerks of up to 64 Gs\" and suggested that some providers were concerned that the missions were contributing to neurological injuries such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (C.T.E.). A group of 12 SWCC veterans, nearly all at the chief or senior-chief level, reported a range of symptoms including cognitive decline, impulsivity, depression, and violent behavior, often escalating as they progressed in their careers, attributing these issues to the physical impacts from the boats. According to the Times, nearly all of the approximately 300 respondents to a questionnaire reported experiencing concussion symptoms from their time on the boats, with most still facing these issues years later. Nearly a quarter indicated that they had experienced suicidal thoughts. However, as there is no public data from the Navy, and no blood test or brain scan exists that can definitively detect this type of damage in living brains, it remains unclear how many sailors have been injured. According to a Naval Special Warfare spokesperson, the risks to the boat crews “are well recognized,” noting that boat team leaders are chosen for their “sustained superior performance” and undergo extensive testing.\nSWCC units\nNaval Special Warfare Group 4\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em 0.5em 0.5em 1em; padding:0.5em; font-size:95%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!
