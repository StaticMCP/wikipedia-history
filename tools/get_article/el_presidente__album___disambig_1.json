The album was also released on 8 February 2006 in Japan with two extra tracks, a new recording called \"Lies\" and a cover of Prince's \"Raspberry Beret\", which was also included as a B-side to \"Turn This Thing Around\". In total four singles have been released from the album, \"Rocket\", \"100 MPH\", \"Without You\" and \"Turn This Thing Around\".\nThe current line up of El Presidente is not actually featured on the album. It was recorded by Dante Gizzi and his brother Guiliano (Who played with Dante in the band Gun). Other guests on the album are Liam Nugent and Ross Galloway, who played synths and performed backing vocals respectively on the single \"Rocket\". Emma Murphy also performs backing vocals on \"If You Say You Love Me\", \"Hanging Around\" and \"Old Times\". Alan Thornton (also a former Gun member) drums on all tracks apart from the opening 3 tracks, and track 10. In the album's booklet it claims that Alan did indeed drum on the tenth track, but a recent investigation showed that the booklet was misprinted, and Dawn Zhu was the drummer. Zhu also plays on the opening three tracks.\n| rev2 = The Observer\n| rev2Score =\n| noprose = yes\n}}\nTrack listing\nDeluxe Edition\nEl Presidente (Deluxe Edition) was released with a bonus DVD.\nTrack listing\n# \"Without You\"\n# \"Rocket\"\n# \"100 MPH\"\n# \"Turn This Thing Around\"\n# \"Count on Me\"\n# \"If You Say You Love Me\"\n# \"Hangin' Around\"\n# \"I Didn't Really\"\n# \"Old Times\"\n# \"Keep on Walking\"\n# \"Honey\"\n# \"Come on Now\"\n# \"Lies\"\n# \"Raspberry Beret\"\n# \"Sushi and Wine\"\n# \"How Many Roads\"\n# \"Hold On\"\nBonus DVD\n# \"Without You\" (video)\n# \"Rocket\" (video)\n# \"100 MPH\" (video)\n# \"Turn This Thing Around\" (video)\n# The making of \"Turn This Thing Around\"\n# \"Rocket\" (live)\nReferences"
