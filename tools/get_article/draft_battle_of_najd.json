The Imam of Muscat, Said bin Sultan, appealed to Hossein Ali Mirza, Qajar governor of Fars, for aid. In 1811 (1226 AH), Sadeq Khan Qajar led several thousand musketeers from Southern Iran to Muscat, where they joined Omani forces and advanced into Najd.\nThe Wahhabi commanders Muhammad ibn Seif and Seif ibn Malik, supported by Bedouin cavalry, initially repelled the Persians but fell into disorder after quarrelling over plunder. Sadeq Khan counterattacked, inflicting heavy losses and forcing a Wahhabi retreat. The Qajar–Omani army advanced near Diriyah, plundered districts of Najd, and then returned to Muscat.\nThough the campaign did not break Wahhabi power, it secured Muscat temporarily and signaled Qajar ability to project force into Central Arabia.\nThe campaign\nSadeq Khan Qajar landed with Iranian musketeers at Muscat and joined the Omani army before advancing into Najd. The Wahhabis assembled their forces under Muhammad ibn Saif and Saif ibn Malik, supported by Bedouin cavalry. The battle opened with exchanges between Musketeers and archers. The Wahhabis at first gained ground, but quarrels over booty among their Bedouin allies broke their cohesion. Sadeq Khan seized the moment, counterattacked, and routed the enemy. The Wahhabi commanders were wounded and forced to flee, while Qajar–Omani forces raided the Najd districts up to the outskirts of Diriyah before withdrawing to Muscat.\nAftermath\nThe campaign boosted Omani security and weakened Wahhabi forces in Najd. Rumors of Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud death spread, alarming his followers and pleasing the Ottomans. Sultan Said of Oman rewarded the Qajar commanders with gifts and money, while chroniclers marked the expedition as a successful joint action.\nLegacy\nThe Qajar–Omani campaign in Najd marked one of the first coordinated Persian-Arab efforts against the rising Wahhabi-Saudi state. It temporarily disrupted Wahhabi expansion, secured Omani trade routes, and demonstrated the Qajar dynasty’s willingness to project power into Arabia. Although the victory did not permanently curb Saudi influence, it set a precedent for future military interventions and shaped regional alliances in the Persian Gulf.\nReferences"
