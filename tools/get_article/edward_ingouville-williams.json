He was killed in action while serving as commander of the 34th Division during the Battle of the Somme in July 1916.\nEarly life and military career\nIngouville-Williams was born in Purbrook, Hampshire, to General Sir John W. C. Williams, an officer of the Royal Marines, and Georgiana Isabella, the daughter of a wealthy landowner.\nHe was commissioned as a subaltern, with the rank of second lieutenant, in the East Kent Regiment (3rd Regiment of Foot; known as \"the Buffs\") on 23 April 1881. He participated in the Nile Expedition (1884–1885) and served as adjutant to the regiment from 1894 to 1898 after promotion to captain. He was seconded to the Egyptian Army in 1898 and 1899, during which time he was appointed a brevet major in November 1898 and took part in the Battle of Atbara, and the Battle of Khartoum, for which he was later mentioned in dispatches. He was promoted from supernumerary captain to captain in June 1899.\nFrom 1899 to 1902, he served under Sir Charles Warren in the Second Boer War. He was present at the Relief of Ladysmith and was twice mentioned in dispatches during the war. His brother George, a major in the South Staffordshire Regiment, was killed in action during the conflict. By the end of the war, he had been awarded the Queen's South Africa Medal King's South Africa Medal, and the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), and had been promoted to lieutenant colonel, after having held the local rank earlier in the war. He changed his name to Ingouville-Williams in 1902, apparently in memory of his mother, whose maiden name was Ingouville.\nIn April 1903, Ingouville-Williams was transferred from the East Kents to the Worcestershire Regiment as a major. The next year he took command of the 2nd Battalion of the Worcesters, with whom he spent much of the following five years in British India, during which time he was promoted twice, first to lieutenant colonel in March 1904 and then to brevet colonel in December 1905. After completing his tour as his battalion's commanding officer (CO), he was, after being promoted to the full rank of colonel in March 1908, placed on a period of half-pay.\nHe was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in June 1910 and went on to serve as commandant of the School of Instruction for Mounted Infantry in March. After relinquishing command of the school to Sydney Turing Barlow Lawford, he then took command of the 16th Infantry Brigade, part of the 6th Division, from June 1912 until the outbreak of the First World War just over two years later. As a result of his new appointment, he received a temporary promotion to the rank of brigadier general.\nFirst World War\nIngouville-Williams and his brigade, now part of the 6th Division, were ordered to France soon after the outbreak of the First World War.\nHe remained in command of the 16th Brigade until June 1915, when he was promoted to major-general and sent home to command the newly formed 34th Division, a Kitchener's Army unit. After training in England, he took the 34th to the Western Front in January 1916 and led the division at the beginning of the Battle of the Somme in summer 1916. He earned another four mentions in despatches during the war. On 22 July, Ingouville-Williams and his aide-de-camp personally inspected the ground on which the division was expected to fight the following week. On his way back, he was caught in an artillery barrage and was killed instantly after being struck by a piece of shrapnel.\nHe was buried at Warloy-Baillon Communal Cemetery extension in France.\nReferences"
