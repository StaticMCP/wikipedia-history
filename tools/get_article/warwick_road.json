Its original alignment, which was gazetted in 1949 as Road No. 10578 by the Wanneroo Road Board, was a straight east–west road extending to Alexander Drive, but in the mid-1970s, the alignment was altered southwards in the vicinity of the freeway alignment in preparation for connecting to the Mitchell Freeway when it was extended 1986. In the late 1970s, the section east of Wanneroo Road was split off to form Marangaroo Drive.\nApart from the Glengarry and Greenwood neighbourhood shopping centres, Warwick Road also passes Warwick Open Space east of Erindale Road and the Percy Doyle Reserve, which includes sports and recreation facilities and the Duncraig Library, near Marmion Avenue.\nRenamed segments of the old alignment include Arnisdale Road west of the freeway, Tuart Road east of the freeway, and Mereworth Way/Warwick place east of Wanneroo Road. There is also a small, discontinuous, segment west of the intersection west of Marmion Avenue.\nMajor intersections\nAll intersections listed below are traffic light-controlled unless otherwise indicated.\n–– tripoint\n|type=concur\n|km=0.0\n|road= Marmion Avenue (State Route&nbsp;71)\n|notes=Western terminus of arterial road section.
