It is found in forest borders and woodland in south-eastern Brazil. It was previously considered conspecific with the gray-throated warbling finch, and together they were known as the red-rumped warbling finch. The SACC found enough evidence to split them in 2009.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Buff-throated Warbling Finch\n\n#REDIRECT Buff-throated warbling finch\n}}"
