The series, created by Richard and Esther Shapiro and produced by Aaron Spelling, revolves around the Carringtons, a wealthy family residing in Denver, Colorado.\nSeason six stars John Forsythe as millionaire oil magnate Blake Carrington; Linda Evans as his wife Krystle; Jack Coleman as Blake and Alexis's earnest son Steven; Gordon Thomson as Blake and Alexis' eldest son Adam; Pamela Bellwood as Steven's ex-wife, Claudia; Heather Locklear as Krystle's niece and Steven's ex-wife Sammy Jo; Michael Nader as Alexis's husband Dex Dexter; Catherine Oxenberg as Blake and Alexis' youngest daughter, Amanda; Michael Praed as Amanda's husband Prince Michael of Moldavia; Diahann Carroll as Blake's half-sister Dominique Deveraux; Ted McGinley as Clay Fallmont; and Joan Collins as Alexis Colby, Blake's ex-wife and the mother of Adam, Fallon, Steven and Amanda. The season also features Maxwell Caulfield as Jeff's cousin, Miles Colby; Christopher Cazenove as Blake's brother, Ben Carrington; Kate O'Mara as Alexis' sister Caress Morell; and George Hamilton as con man Joel Abrigore.\nA spin-off series, The Colbys, was launched in November 1985, starring John James and Emma Samms as their Dynasty characters, Jeff Colby and Fallon Carrington. To set up the new series, Dynasty introduced the series regulars of The Colbys, including Charlton Heston as wealthy Colby Enterprises CEO Jason Colby; Stephanie Beacham as his wife Sable; Tracy Scoggins as their daughter Monica, twin sister to Miles; Claire Yarlett as Bliss Colby; Jason and Sable's youngest daughter; Barbara Stanwyck as Jason's sister Constance Colby; and Ricardo Montalbán as shipping tycoon Zach Powers.\nDevelopment\nThe season six premiere episode \"The Aftermath\" garnered a 28.1 rating, higher than any other episode in the entire series, as viewers wanted to see who survived the \"Moldavian Massacre\" cliffhanger from the season five finale. The only casualties were Steven's boyfriend Luke Fuller (William Campbell), and Jeff's love interest Lady Ashley Mitchell (Ali MacGraw). In the 2006 CBS special Dynasty Reunion: Catfights & Caviar, Gordon Thomson stated that it was the \"follow-up\" that was the letdown, not the cliffhanger itself. John James stated in the 2001 episode of E! The True Hollywood Story featuring Dynasty that the Moldavian Massacre was when the show \"maxed out\" and \"overdosed\" on outrageousness. Joan Collins was conspicuously absent from the season six opener, as she was in a tense contract renegotiation with the show, seeking an increased salary. She returned to the series in the season's second episode.\nAlthough still a top ten series, Dynasty dropped from first to seventh place in the ratings for its sixth season. A spin-off series, The Colbys, was launched in November 1985, starring John James and Emma Samms as their Dynasty characters, Jeff Colby and Fallon Carrington.\nPlot\nSpurned by Blake, Alexis finds his estranged brother Ben and the duo successfully plot to strip Blake of his fortune.
