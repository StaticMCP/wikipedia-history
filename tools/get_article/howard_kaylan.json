He also was a member of Frank Zappa's band, The Mothers of Invention.\nEarly years\nKaylan was born in the Bronx to a Jewish family and grew up in Utica, New York, and Westchester, a neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. He studied choral music and clarinet, and won a Bank of America Fine Arts Award at age 16. He graduated early (as valedictorian) from Westchester High School, and briefly attended University of California, Los Angeles on a scholarship.\nMusic career\nThe Turtles\nKaylan and Mark Volman founded The Turtles, a popular band of the late 1960s, for which, despite the fact that not all of their songs were written by the band members, Kaylan has been a prolific songwriter, and co-wrote Elenore with his bandmates. At the end of 1970, Kaylan and Volman signed on as members of Frank Zappa's band, The Mothers of Invention. The pair recorded tracks on five albums, toured to support them, and appeared in the film 200 Motels, a semi-documentary film directed by Zappa. They were compelled to use the names Flo & Eddie (\"Flo\" being shortened from \"Phlorescent Leech\") and were not allowed legal use of their own names, or that of The Turtles, until multiple lawsuits from that band were settled in 1985.\nIn 1985 the name \"The Turtles\" reverted to Kaylan and Volman after fifteen years in litigation, as well as all of the master recordings they made. Thanks to Burger King, the NFL, Sony PlayStation, and countless other television advertisements and motion pictures, the Turtles' catalog remains a staple for licensing and reproduction in the twenty-first century.\nFrank Zappa\nKaylan and Volman joined The Mothers of Invention, Frank Zappa's band, after the Turtles broke up, but were contractually prevented from using their real names, and were thus given the names \"The Phlorescent Leech\" (Volman) and \"Eddie\" (Kaylan).\nPhlorescent Leech and Eddie appeared on Frank Zappa's 1970 album ''Chunga's Revenge'' and in 1971 as lead vocalists on Zappa's Fillmore East album as Howard Kaylan/Mark Volman where they sang \"Happy Together\", then on Just Another Band From L.A., 200 Motels and much later Playground Psychotics and other Zappa compilations of old live concerts from 1970–71.\nKaylan and Volman left The Mothers of Invention after an irate fan pushed Zappa into the orchestra pit at the Rainbow Theatre in London during a concert on December 10, 1971, seriously injuring him. With Zappa using a wheelchair and unable to sing or play guitar for a year, The Mothers of Invention were on hiatus so Kaylan and Volman set out on their own as Flo & Eddie, never officially returning to the Mothers.\nFlo & Eddie\nKaylan and Volman signed with Columbia as Flo & Eddie. In his autobiography Shell Shocked, Kaylan revealed that upon receiving the cover art for their first album, they were appalled to learn that the printer had mistakenly printed the duo's stage names in the wrong order above their photograph. Volman was identified as Flo, which had been Kaylan's stage name in Zappa's band, and Kaylan was identified as Eddie, Volman's stage name. The label refused to reprint the cover, saying that it would cost too much money. Thus, Kaylan and Volman decided to professionally swap stage names.\nFlo & Eddie released nine albums on Warner Bros. Records and Columbia Records in music; in film they provided music and voices for animated films like Down and Dirty Duck; and they appeared in radio broadcasting.\nIn the 1980s, \"Rock Steady With Flo and Eddie\" was recorded in Kingston, Jamaica, and the partners began writing comedy and script with Chris Bearde, Larry Gelbart, and Carl Gottlieb. Simultaneously, they began writing regularly featured columns for Creem, Phonograph Record Magazine and the Los Angeles Free Press.\nThey also produced many albums for other bands and artists, as well as singing backing vocals on over 100 albums. Flo & Eddie can be heard singing with John Lennon, Bruce Springsteen, Ramones, Blondie, Duran Duran, The Psychedelic Furs, T. Rex, Alice Cooper and many more.\nSolo work\nIn the mid-1990s, Kaylan turned his attention to the collecting and writing of dark fantasy literature and science fiction. He wrote two short stories, by way of experimentation, and both were published in the best-selling anthologies \"Phantoms of the Night\" and \"Forbidden Acts\".\nIn 2006, Kaylan released a solo album, Dust Bunnies, described as songs \"hand-picked by Kaylan from years of seldom-heard B-sides and album cuts recorded by many of his favorite artists and supplemented by new arrangements of more familiar pieces and a rock original or two.\" It includes covers of The Honeycombs' \"Have I the Right?\", Barry Ryan's \"Eloise\", and The Left Banke's \"Love Songs in the Night\" and \"Two by Two\".\nAs of 2008 Kaylan penned the widely read \"Eddie's Media Corner\" on his official website.\nHealth and retirement\nIn 2018, Kaylan retired from touring due to requiring heart and back surgery; he was replaced in the Happy Together tour by Ron Dante (of the Archies, the Cuff Links, and the Detergents fame).\nMedia appearances\nHe portrayed an orthodox minister who \"married\" Laura to Stavros in a dream sequence on General Hospital, an old hippie on Suddenly Susan, and a younger one on the ''It's Garry Shandling's Show.\nIn 1983, Kaylan appeared in the comedy Get Crazy, starring Malcolm McDowell and Daniel Stern. Kaylan played the part of Captain Cloud, a spiritual guru type of character, leader of a caravan of time-lost, gypsy-like hippies. In 1987, Kaylan and Volman appeared in a new music video of the song \"Happy Together\", made to promote the romantic comedy Making Mr. Right, which featured the song during its end credits.\nIn 2001, Kaylan wrote a treatment for a very short film about his first night on tour in London. After taking it to his friend (and Rhino Records president) Harold Bronson for input, the project was lengthened and shot as a one-hour movie. The following year, scenes were added, and it was back into the movie studio again to complete a full-length feature. My Dinner with Jimi thus became the first film written by Kaylan. It was produced by Bronson for Rhino Entertainment and directed by Bill Fishman (Tapeheads, Car 54, Where Are You?'') for Fallout Films. In 2005, Kaylan appeared in a featured role in Stephen King's Riding the Bullet.\nKaylan's autobiography Shell Shocked: My Life with the Turtles, Flo and Eddie, and Frank Zappa, Etc. was published by Backbeat Books in March 2013. The book was written with Jeff Tamarkin, and it included a foreword by Penn Jillette and cover art by Cal Schenkel.\nDiscography\nWith The Turtles\nStudio albums\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Album\n!Label\n|-\n|1965\n|''It Ain't Me Babe\n| rowspan=\"6\" |White Whale\n|-\n|1966\n|You Baby\n|-\n|1967\n|Happy Together\n|-\n|1968\n|The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands\n|-\n|1969\n|Turtle Soup''\n|}\nSingles\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Title (A-side / B-side)\nBoth sides from same album except where indicated\n!Album\n!Label\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |1965\n|\"It Ain't Me Babe\" / \"Almost There\" (from You, Baby)\n| rowspan=\"2\" |''It Ain't Me, Babe''\n| rowspan=\"26\" |White Whale\n|-\n|\"Let Me Be\" / \"Your Maw Said You Cried (In Your Sleep Last Night)\"\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" |1966\n|\"You Baby\" / \"Wanderin' Kind\" (from ''It Ain't Me, Babe)\n|You, Baby\n|-\n|\"It Was a Very Good Year\" / \"Let the Cold Winds Blow\"\n|It Ain't Me, Babe\n|-\n|\"Grim Reaper of Love\" / \"Come Back\" (from Wooden Head)\n|Golden Hits''\n|-\n|\"We'll Meet Again\" / \"Outside Chance\" (from Golden Hits)\n|Wooden Head\n|-\n|\"Making My Mind Up\" / \"Outside Chance\" (from Golden Hits)\n| rowspan=\"1\" |Happy Together\n|-\n|\"Can I Get to Know You Better?\" / \"Like the Seasons\" (from Happy Together)\n| rowspan=\"1\" |Golden Hits\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |1967\n|\"Happy Together\" / \"Like the Seasons\"\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Happy Together\n|-\n|\"She'd Rather Be with Me\" / \"The Walking Song\"\n|-\n|\"Guide for the Married Man\" / \"Think I'll Run Away\"\n|-\n|\"You Know What I Mean\" / \"Rugs of Woods & Flowers\" (from Happy Together)\n| rowspan=\"1\" |Golden Hits\n|-\n|\"She's My Girl\" / \"Chicken Little Was Right\" (Non-LP track.
