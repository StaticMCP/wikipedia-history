It was developed during the Second World War by Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers, based on Carl Jung's theory. This tool categorizes individuals into 16 personality types through 4 dichotomies, including Extraversion/Introversion, Sensing/Intuition, Thinking/Feeling, and Judging/Perceiving (Velichko et al., 2015). It was initially used as a psychological assessment tool but is now widely employed as a means for self-discovery and social interaction.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ MBTI Dimension Description\n|-\n!

However, it became popular during the pandemic, particularly in East Asia, evolving into a symbol of social identity. In South Korea, Japan, China, and elsewhere, MBTI is more than just a test; it has become an essential element in self-introductions, friendship formation, and dating. And this is a result of a highly connected social media environment combined with the younger generation's desire for self-exploration (Seo & Yeung, 2022). By 2025, MBTI has become a core element of everyday conversation among East Asian youth, effectively replacing older frameworks like blood type personality theory and emerging as a hallmark of globalised self-expression. This evolution has been boosted by social media algorithms, though the psychological pressure stemming from excessive labelling remains a point of contention. Detailed case studies are covered in the sections “Dating Culture”, “K-pop Fandoms and Idol Culture”, and “Regional Comparisons (South Korea, Japan, China)”.\nMBTI in Dating Culture\nUse of MBTI as a Compatibility Tool\nIn the 2020s, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator gained significant recognition and popularity in the dating culture of East Asia. This can be especially seen in areas like South Korea, Japan, and China, where individuals would ask for someone’s MBTI as a common icebreaker or conversation starter. According to journals, MBTI has become a standard self-introduction tool among the Korean youth, where reports indicate that young adults frequently use it as a shortcut for assessing compatibility between one another. This often happens before deeper personal interaction occurs, as the four-letter type has become a symbolic representation of temperament and relational style (Lee & Shin, 2024). Similarly, BBC News reported that there has been an increase of single people in South Korea who rely on personality types to judge their possible partners and decide whether pursuing a relationship is worthwhile (Lee, 2025).\nInfluence on Dating Apps and Matchmaking\nThe trend goes further into formal and official dating services. Several South Korean matchmaking events have been held, including MBTI-themed “MBTI Cupid” socials, where it explicitly pairs participants based on whether their personality types are considered compatible (Staff, 2023). This reflects the growing belief that MBTI can be used to predict romantic harmony. Major Korean dating or social media apps have multiple users to show their MBTI type on profiles, which indicates the culture and how it is an integral part of social introductions (Lee, 2025). Researchers in South Korea have also proposed algorithmic MBTI-based matchmaking systems in order to create a design recommending users to “high compatibility” partners (An & Kim, 2017).\nSocial Filtering and Stereotypes\nA dating culture based on MBTI has led to the “MBTI filter” which journalists describe as a tendency for young adults to base their decision on accepting or rejecting potential partners on the perceived compatibility stereotypes. There are certain types that are labeled as desirable or undesirable in romantic contexts; for example, an ENFP and INFJ pairing is widely viewed online as an “ideal couple” amongst the South Korean MBTI communities, while types such as INTP or ISTJ are sometimes associated with negative dating stereotypes. These stereotypes raised concerns about personality reductionism, where people started to overly rely on simplified 4-letter labels rather than real personal interaction (Clarion, 2019).\nMBTI in Kpop Fandoms\nThe Rise of MBTI in K-pop\nThe MBTI trend has taken South Korea, especially the K-pop fandom by storm. Once overshadowed by the blood type personality theory, MBTI surged in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic as a more nuanced and relatable way to understand oneself and others (Wang, 2025).\nIn the K-pop industry, MBTI has become more than just a personality test. It’s a cultural shorthand, a bonding tool, and a marketing strategy. Fans eagerly memorize their favorite idols’ MBTI types, analyze group dynamics through personality lenses, and even use MBTI to determine compatibility with their biases. MBTI has evolved into a mainstream identity marker for both celebrities and the general public.\nHow does MBTI resonate with K-pop Fans\nMBTI offers fans a structured way to understand their own personalities and those of their idols. It also provides a sense of identity and belonging, especially for younger fans navigating self-discovery. Entertainment companies recognize its potential to humanize idols and foster deeper emotional connections with fans (JASMIN, 2025).\nFans could get the sense of connection between themselves and their idol by knowing their idol’s MBTI. For example, fans often say things like “I’m an INFP with my idol!,” creating a perceived emotional bond. MBTI enriches the fan experience by adding layers of meaning, connection, and creativity. It transforms fandom from a passive act of consumption into an active journey.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! Ranking\n! Idol\n!

MBTI in the K-pop industry  is often used as a means to showcase idols' personalities in a more relatable manner. While this can be fun and relatable to the fans, it often leads to stereotyping. For example, idols who identify as INFPs are frequently labeled as shy, emotional, and sensitive, while ISTJs are assumed to be rigid and overly serious, regardless of how they behave in real life. These assumptions can shape public perception, influencing how fans interpret an idol’s actions, speech, and even facial expressions. When an idol’s behavior deviates from their “type,” fans may express confusion or disappointment, reinforcing the pressure to conform to MBTI-based expectations. The oversimplification of the personality of the idol’s MBTI limits how idols express themselves publicly.\nCriticisms\nEvery idol was labeled by their MBTI, which has a ‘standard answer’ of what the person should behave, whenever their behaviour was not similar to the descriptions of their MBTI, it led to disappointment or judgments from the public as their behaviour was tightly monitored by the public. It also led to a misinterpretation of the idol’s true personality.\nMBTI in Workplace\nIn East Asia, particularly in South Korea, Japan, and China, MBTI has transcended its origins as a simple psychological test to become a multifaceted HR tool utilized for team building, recruitment, and leadership development (Seo & Yeung, 2022). By 2025, Gen Z (born 1997–2012) constitutes 27-30% of the global workforce (CSG The Global Talent Experts, 2025); it has emerged as a key trend aiding younger generations in self-discovery and workplace adaptation. However, this process is accompanied by the reinforcement of stereotypes and ethical controversies, revealing the dual nature of the MBTI.\nApplications in Practice\nMBTI is used in various contexts in the workplace, particularly in East Asia, where a strong collectivist culture exists. In Korean companies, the MBTI test is compulsory during new employee onboarding workshops, and the results are used to form project teams and adjust communication styles (Lacroix, 2025). This focuses on Extraversion/Introversion and Judging/Perceiving to optimise work efficiency. In Japan, within traditional hierarchical structures, MBTI is employed as ‘soft skills’ training to aid Gen Z employees' adaptation, with increasing instances of sharing type-specific feedback during team meetings. Furthermore, a trend of “mandatory MBTI submission” is observed in Korea and China, where companies require MBTI results to be attached to CVs during recruitment, and this serves as a quick means of assessing candidates' suitability (Korea JoongAng Daily, 2022).\nAdvantages and Empirical Benefits\nThe workplace application of the MBTI offers clear benefits in enhancing self-awareness and improving team dynamics. According to research, MBTI-based training enhances sympathy and understanding among employees, which increases team cooperation and productivity. It has been proven particularly effective in overcoming communication barriers within hierarchical structures, notably in the Japanese business environment (The Myers-Briggs Company, n.d.). A study of Korean airline cabin crew found MBTI types (e.g., ENFJ) positively correlated with cultural adaptability and mental health, contributing to reduced turnover rates among Korean crew members in Middle Eastern airlines (Song et al., 2021). Furthermore, it is useful in reinforcing soft skills such as emotional intelligence and is considered more accessible than the Big Five model. These effects also contribute to sustainable community growth, with MBTI being actively utilised as a “decoding tool” for mentoring in Gen Z-focused workshops (Learning Partners, 2025).\nStereotypes and Criticisms\nMBTI is criticised for fostering workplace discrimination and stereotypes through excessive simplification. For instance, in South Korea, INFPs are labelled “dreaming idealists” and INTJs “cold-blooded strategists”, with a “preference for T types” in recruitment processes disadvantageously affecting F-type applicants (Korea JoongAng Daily, 2022). In China, the stereotype that ‘J types are disciplined’ reinforces prejudice, with scholars defining this as a ‘new form of discrimination’ (Fan & Dong, 2024). Ethically, using MBTI as a hiring criterion may violate Chinese labour law, sparking a backlash movement among job seekers on social media in 2024 that led to “MBTI fatigue” (HROne Team, 2025). Furthermore, its lack of scientific reliability with 50% variability upon retesting remains a core point of ongoing criticism (Early Years TV, n.d.). These issues demonstrate how MBTI can facilitate self-justification or the stigmatisation of others within East Asia's collectivist cultures.\nRecent Trends and Future Outlook\nFrom 2024 to 2025, MBTI in East Asia evolved through integration with AI, leading to a 55% increase in social media discussions (Wang, 2025). However, as criticism of “MBTI overload” intensifies, skepticism over its continued relevance is spreading. And Chinese scholars interpret this as signalling a shift in attitudes towards psychology while proposing the adoption of scientific alternatives like the Big Five for sustainability (Ma, 2025). Overall, MBTI functions as a catalyst for workplace culture, yet a balanced approach and ethical use remain essential.\nPopularity\nSouth Korea\nThe MBTI personality test has become widely popular in South Korea in recent years, with 68.5% of individuals expressing positive sentiments towards it (Lee & Shin, 2024). It is believed that the COVID-19 pandemic was crucial to the rise in popularity in South Korea. Lee & Shin (2024) also stated that the decrease in social interactions and increase in solitary time at home allowed people to spend more time on self-reflection, which sparked an interest in people taking the MBTI test to explore themselves. Korea has a cultural tendency to categorize people, and with this group-oriented culture combined with the power of social media, commercialism, and campaigns, MBTI became a trend obsessed over by many across the country of South Korea (Min, 2023). Gradually, the MBTI of a person became a consideration factor for people who are looking to date in South Korea under the influence of its culture to categorize people. It was stated that the MBTI approach to dating appeals more to the MZ Generation, which refers to the combination of Millennials and Gen Z, who would prefer knowing their dating partners’ personalities by MBTI rather than wasting time with more traditional ways (Yeung & Seo, 2022). As the popularity of MBTI grew, it has affected not only dating but also areas such as workplaces and the entertainment industry in South Korea, where many supporting fans idolize celebrities who share similar MBTIs. This indicates MBTI has a massive impact on pop culture, such as dating, entertainment, etc., across the country, where youngsters show huge interests.\nJapan\nSimilar to South Korea, Japan is also a country that adopts the trend of MBTI, and it is hugely popular among Gen Z. According to Kuo (2025), 41.3% of Gen Z females in Japan have taken the test; moreover, 60% of the Gen Z respondents have stated that not only are they in possession of their own MBTIs but also their friends’ and acquaintances’. News on Japan (2025) stated that the popularity of K-pop idols revealing their MBTI types fueled fascination amongst Japanese fans, and brands across Japan have also picked up on the trend. For example, 7-Eleven launched a scheme that allowed customers to collect packets corresponding to their own MBTIs. The marketing strategy demonstrated how interactive customer-seller interaction helped increase the popularity of MBTI across the country.\nChina\nChina is another country that has been under the influence of MBTI, which has become a youth phenomenon across the country. As of December 2023, the popularity of MBTI-related topics reached over 31.2187 million within the past 180 days on the Chinese platform Xiaohongshu (Wu et al., 2024). This phenomenon indicates MBTI is not just famously known across the likes of South Korea but in other Asian countries as well. While youngsters from South Korea and Japan use MBTI for entertainment and social purposes, youngsters from China try to find the linkage between MBTI and career prospects. Fan & Dong (2024) claimed that young people and employers have started to seek an individual’s MBTI results as something that is fixed and definitive, which could lead to young people defining themselves solely on their MBTIs or personalities. This shows the significance of MBTI in job seeking across the country and how it has reshaped the view of how young people weigh their own personalities (Zhang, 2024).\nReferences\nAn, H.-J., & Kim, S.-I.
