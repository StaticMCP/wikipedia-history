Six metropolitan statistical areas of more than one million residents do not have inter-city train service, nor do the states of South Dakota or Wyoming. There are no international passenger trains between the United States and Mexico, nor to Canada outside of Ontario, Montreal, and Vancouver.\nCities lacking inter-city rail service\nFor purposes of this list, a city is considered served if it is within  of an Amtrak or other inter-city passenger rail station.

From 1973 to 1981 Amtrak operated the Inter-American, which allowed for transfers between Laredo, Texas and Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas for connecting service with the Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México. The closest Amtrak service to Mexico may be found at stations along the western portion of the Sunset Limited and southwestern portion of the Texas Eagle in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California; as well as the Pacific Surfliner service to Union Station in San Diego.\nAmtrak has studied rail lines formerly canceled that could renew service to some cities. Cities involved include Boise, Mobile, Tallahassee, the Quad Cities (four adjoining cities in northwest Illinois and southeastern Iowa), Billings, and Wichita. Proposals for high-speed rail could also restore service for several cities. Other services Amtrak could restore include the Pioneer (serving Chicago-Denver-Seattle via the California Zephyr), the Black Hawk (Chicago-Dubuque, eastern Iowa), the North Coast Hiawatha (serving Chicago-Fargo-Seattle via the Montana Rail Link), the Montrealer (Extension of the Vermonter from St. Albans, VT to Montreal, QC), the Coast Daylight (supplementing the Coast Starlight between Los Angeles and the Bay Area), and the New Orleans-Orlando segment of the Sunset Limited.\nSee also\n* List of Amtrak routes\n* List of Amtrak stations\n* List of busiest Amtrak stations\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.trainweb.org/moksrail/documents/pop/pop_article.htm Article on the missing markets that America's rail service doesn't serve (analysis and charts)]\n*[http://www.trainweb.org/moksrail/documents/pop/msa.htm Chart showing U.S. population centers and Amtrak service]"
