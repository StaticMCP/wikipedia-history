Gémeaux Award, the French version of the Gemini Awards were held for the first time this year as well. The 1985 television miniseries Anne of Green Gables was the most prominent winner.\nEnglish-language television coverage of the ceremonies was originally scheduled for broadcast on CBC Television, but labour disruptions at that network forced the telecast to move to a syndicated arrangement of private television stations including Toronto's Citytv. Unused cable channels in Montreal carried the broadcast in that city. The inaugural Gemini Awards were hosted by Second City Television performers Eugene Levy, Andrea Martin and Dave Thomas from the Metro Toronto Convention Centre.\nAwards\nBest Comedy Program or Series\n* Seeing Things\n* Four on the Floor\n* ''Hangin' In\nBest Documentary, Single Program or Series\n* Glenn Gould: A Portrait, Parts 1 and 2\n* 444 Days to Freedom: What Really Happened in Iran\n* Karsh: The Searching Eye\n* Making Overtures: The Story of a Community Orchestra\nBest Dramatic Series\n* Night Heat\n* The Campbells\n* Danger Bay\nBest Dramatic Mini Series\n* Anne of Green Gables\n* Red Serge\n* Spearfield's Daughter\nBest TV Movie\n* Love and Larceny\n* The Execution of Raymond Graham\n* Tramp at the Door\nBest Short Drama\n*Oakmount High\n*The Exile\n*In This Corner\n*Undertow\nBest Information Program or Series\n* The Fifth Estate\n* Canada AM\n* The Journal\n* Live It Up!\n* Peter Ustinov's Russia''\nBest Children's Series\n* Fraggle Rock\n* OWL/TV\n* ''Today's Special\n* Wonderstruck\nBest Writing in a Dramatic Program\n* 'Donald Brittain and Richard Nielsen, ''Canada's Sweetheart: The Saga of Hal C.
