Originally both tanks only came equipped with machine guns but in 1940, the M2A4 was upgraded to a 37mm anti-tank gun. The machine gun-armed tanks were never used in combat, and only a handful of cannon-armed vehicles saw service in the Pacific; but their design formed the basis of the later M3/M5 Light Tank. The British officially called their M3s Stuarts, and often referred to them as \"Honeys\".\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right; width:40%\"\n!     !! 1940 !! 1941 !! 1942 !! 1943 !! 1944 !! 1945 !!

Production was delayed and by the time it entered service, it was considered obsolete.\nThe M24 Chaffee was intended as a replacement for the M3 and M5 series;\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right; width:40%\"\n!     !! 1940 !! 1941 !! 1942 !! 1943 !! 1944 !! 1945 !!

This tank was never to see combat service, but its chassis and suspension were used as a basis for the Lee and Sherman tanks. Following the German invasion of France in 1940, a small number of Medium M2A1 tanks (an improved model) were manufactured for training. A better tank (which was eventually to become the Medium M3 Lee) was designed as an interim until the M4 could be produced. The M3 was ordered in large numbers by the British to a slightly different specification but by the time Lend-Lease was introduced the two variants were more alike except for the turret. Over half of M3 production would be supplied to the US's allies - the UK and USSR.\nThe Lee was superseded by the Medium M4 Sherman. This originally carried a 75&nbsp;mm gun; later versions of the Sherman were armed with a 76&nbsp;mm gun or a 105&nbsp;mm howitzer.\nOn the Sherman hull, the M10 and M36 tank destroyers (officially called \"Gun Motor Carriages\") were produced.\nThe M7 Howitzer Motor Carriage was originally built on the M3 medium tank chassis, but later versions were built on the similar M4 tank chassis.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n!       !! 1940 !! 1941 !! 1942 !! 1943 !! 1944 !! 1945 !!

An earlier design, the Heavy Tank M6, was not accepted for large scale production and only 40 were produced. Work began in early 1945 to develop a significantly heavier variant of the M26 Pershing, the T32 Heavy Tank, but after the end of the World War II, the project was cancelled and the four prototype vehicles were scrapped.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n!     !! 1940 !! 1941 !! 1942 !! 1943 !! 1944 !! 1945 !!
