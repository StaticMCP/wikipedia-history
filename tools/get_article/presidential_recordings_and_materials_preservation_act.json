Nixon.  It placed Nixon's presidential records into federal custody to prevent their destruction.  The legislative action was intended to reduce secrecy, while allowing historians to fulfill their responsibilities.\nApplication\nThe Act applies only to President Nixon's presidential materials.  Under the statute, materials related to the Abuse of Governmental Power  and the constitutional and statutory duties of the President and his White House staff are retained by the National Archives.  The Act mandates that the National Archives preserve and process these materials, and prepare them for public access.  The National Archives was required to segregate and return to Nixon's estate those  materials identified as purely \"personal-private\" or \"personal-political\" and unrelated to the President's  constitutional and statutory duties.  The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Act's constitutionality in Nixon v. Administrator of General Services.\nLegislative history\nThe Act was introduced as  by Senator Gaylord Nelson on September 18, 1974; passed by both houses with amendments on December 9, 1974; and was signed into law by President Gerald Ford on December 19, 1974.\nSee also\n* Presidential Records Act\n* Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum\n* Executive Order 13233\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.archives.gov/presidential-libraries/laws/1974-act.html Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act (PRMPA) of 1974] at the U.S. National Archives\n* [http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/aboutus/laws/index.php  Nixon Presidential Materials] at the Nixon Library"
