Early in the morning of that day, nine prisoners had escaped, four of which had been sentenced to death due to their involvement in the 2001 Kodori crisis. President Ardzinba initially refused to accept Gagulia's resignation, but was forced to agree on 8 April. Vice President Valery Arshba denied on 8 April that the government's resignation was due to the prison escape, and stated that instead it was caused by the opposition's plans to hold protest rallies on 10 April.

On 7 July Agrba's resignation was accepted and he was replaced by Mikhail Tarba.

Shamba was also appointed as Foreign Minister, the position he had resigned from in June, succeeding Igor Akhba. A new Ministry for Emergency Situations was created, to which deputy Interior Minister Sergei Matosyan was appointed. The portfolio for Youth, Sports, Resorts and Tourism was redistributed over the existing Ministries for Education (Youth and Sports) and Economy (Resorts and Tourism).
