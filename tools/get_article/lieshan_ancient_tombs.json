      "text": "# Lieshan Ancient Tombs\n\nLieshan Ancient Tombs (; ), located in Nyingchi Prefecture, Tibet Autonomous Region, are a complex of over 200 burial sites dating to the 7th–9th century CE, reflecting the Tibetan Plateau's unique mortuary traditions during the Tubo Kingdom period.\nHistory\nNestled at an elevation of 3,200 meters on the forested slopes of the Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains, the tombs blend into the alpine ecosystem, with their stone-and-earth structures designed to withstand seismic activity and harsh weather. Archaeological studies show that builders used slate and granite from the area and put it on tiered platforms to keep the soil from washing away and protect the juniper and rhododendron forests nearby.\nThe largest tomb measures 35 meters in length and 12 meters in height, featuring a central burial chamber flanked by sacrificial pits containing pottery, iron tools, and horse remains. Excavations in the 1980s uncovered intact wooden coffins sealed with yak leather, indicating advanced preservation techniques adapted to the humid subtropical climate of southeastern Tibet. Notably, the tombs' east-west alignment aligns with ancient Bon religious cosmology, emphasizing harmony between human activity and mountainous terrain.\nProtection\nModern conservation efforts since 2010 have prioritized ecological balance, employing non-invasive technologies like ground-penetrating radar to minimize disturbance to the site's fragile permafrost layer. The tombs' integration into the natural landscape offers insights into how early Tibetan societies engineered sustainable burial practices in ecologically sensitive zones.\nReferences"
