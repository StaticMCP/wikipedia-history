The award recognizes journalists from North Africa, the Middle East, and the Gulf who have distinguished themselves through the quality of their work and their commitment to human rights, democracy, good governance, and civic engagement. Each winner receives a €10,000 prize.\nHistory\nThe establishment of the Samir Kassir Award was announced on October 7, 2005, by the European Commission during a press conference in Beirut. The award was created to support journalists covering issues related to human rights, good governance, the rule of law, the fight against corruption, freedom of expression, democratic development, and citizen participation.\nThe Samir Kassir Foundation, launched on February 1, 2006, by friends of Samir Kassir, collaborates with the European Union to administer the award. The first award ceremony took place on June 2, 2006, marking the first anniversary of Kassir's assassination. Initially, the award was divided into two categories: best article and best master's thesis. Over the years, it evolved to focus on print journalism and later included categories for best opinion article, best investigative article, and best audiovisual news report. The 2020 edition also included a special Students' Award, granted by students from Lebanese universities, and since2021 by students from universities across the MENA region.\nSince its inception, the Samir Kassir Award has been awarded 19 times, recognizing the work of 57 journalists and researchers, including 34 men and 23 women.\nThe award has been granted 18 times to Egyptian winners, 12 times to Syrian winners, 9 times to Lebanese winners, 5 times to Palestinian winners, 4 times to Iraqi winners, 3 times to Tunisian winners, and once each to Yemeni, Algerian, Jordanian, and Libyan winners.\nJury Composition\nThe award jury comprises seven members of different nationalities and backgrounds, including four from the Arab world and three from European Union Member States.
