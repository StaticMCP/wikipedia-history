Davies of The Guardian commented on the show saying that it is \"an anxiety-quelling Ted talk in audio form.\" Morgan McNaught of The A.V. Club praised the episode featuring Austin Channing Brown on her recently published book, I'm Still Here, calling the episode \"richly informative.\"\nAwards\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Award\n!Date\n!Category\n!Result\n!Ref.\n|-\n|Webby Awards\n|2021\n|Interview or Talk Show\n|\n|\n|-\n|iHeartRadio Podcast Awards\n|2021\n|Best Advice or Inspirational Podcast\n|\n|\n|}\nSee also\n*List of psychology and self-help podcasts\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
