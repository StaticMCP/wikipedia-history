This article was invoked in the case of Sun Zhigang incident to overturn regulations on the detention of migrants.\nIn addition Articles 78 to 92 outline a procedure for resolving conflicts between laws which is primarily legislative in nature.\nExternal links\n*http://www.gov.cn/english/laws/2005-08/20/content_29724.htm\nReferences"
