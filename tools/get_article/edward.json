It is derived from the Anglo-Saxon name Ēadweard, composed of the elements ēad \"wealth, fortune; prosperity\" and weard \"guardian, protector”.\nHistory\nThe name Edward was very popular in Anglo-Saxon England, but the rule of the Norman and Plantagenet dynasties had effectively ended its use amongst the upper classes. The popularity of the name was revived when Henry III named his firstborn son, the future Edward I, as part of his efforts to promote a cult around Edward the Confessor, for whom Henry had a deep admiration.\nVariant forms\nThe name has been adopted in the Iberian peninsula since the 15th century, due to Edward, King of Portugal, whose mother was English. The Spanish/Portuguese forms of the name are Eduardo and Duarte. Other variant forms include French Édouard, Italian Edoardo and Odoardo, German, Dutch, Czech and Romanian Eduard and Scandinavian Edvard.\nShort forms include   Ed, Eddy, Eddie,  Ted, Teddy and Ned.\nPeople called Edward\nMedieval\n* Edward the Elder (c. 874–924), the son of Alfred the Great\n* Edward the Martyr (c. 962–978), English king and Christian martyr\n* Edward the Confessor (c. 1003–1066), English King; patron saint of England until 1348\n* Edward I of England (1239–1307), called Longshanks; conqueror of Wales\n* Edward Balliol (c. 1283–1367), pretender to the Scottish throne during the reign of David II\n* Edward II of England (1284–1327), deposed in January 1327, probably murdered\n* Edward III of England (1312–1377), English king\n* Edward, the Black Prince (1330–1376), eldest son of King Edward III\n* Edward, Duke of Guelders (1336–1371)\n* Edward IV of England (1442–1483), older brother of Richard III, father of Edward V\n* Edward V of England (1470–c. 1483), one of the princes in the Tower\nModern\nRoyalty and nobility\n* Edward VI of England (1537–1553), the son of Henry VIII and Jane Seymour\n* Edward, Count Palatine of Simmern (1625–1663), Count Palatine\n* Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany (1739–1767), brother of George III\n* Lord Edward FitzGerald (1763–1798), Irish aristocrat and revolutionary\n* Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn (1767–1820), the son of George III, father of Queen Victoria\n* Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar (1823–1902), son of Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach\n* Princess Edward of Saxe-Weimar (1827–1904), wife of Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar\n* Edward VII of the United Kingdom (1841–1910), the son of Queen Victoria\n* Lord Edward Cecil (1867–1918), son of the 3rd Marquess of Salisbury\n* Edward VIII of the United Kingdom (1894–1972), the son of George V, abdicated\n* Prince Edward, Duke of Kent (born 1935), grandson of George V\n* Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh (born 1964), the son of Queen Elizabeth II\n* Lady Edward Manners (born 1975), wife of Lord Edward Manners and daughter-in-law of the 10th Duke of Rutland\n* Edward Windsor, Lord Downpatrick (born 1988), the grandson of The Duke of Kent\nPoliticians\n* Edward D.
