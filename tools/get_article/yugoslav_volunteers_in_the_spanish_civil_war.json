According to Spanish statistics, 148 Yugoslav volunteers received the officer rank during the conflict.\nMost of them fought in the battalions Dimitrov and Đuro Đaković of the International Brigades, and many of them participated and perished during the Battle of Ebro in 1938. They were recruited by the outlawed Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ) in their home regions, or through the recruitment centre of the Comintern that Josip Broz Tito managed in Paris. There were four airmen among the volunteers, the most notable being fighter pilot Božidar \"Boško\" Petrović who attained the status of \"flying ace.\"\nAfter the war, those who managed to flee across the Pyrenees fell captive in internment camps in France, with many being repatriated illegally by the Yugoslav communist organisation. Some of them later became leaders of the resistance against the Nazi occupation.\nThree former members of the International Brigades ended up commanding armies of the Yugoslav Partisans during World War II: Peko Dapčević (1913–1999), Kosta Nađ (1911–1986) and Petar Drapšin (1914–1945). Koča Popović (1908–1992) was another prominent Partisan commander who fought for the Spanish Republicans.\nComposition\nThe exact number of Yugoslavs who volunteered in Spain is unknown and is still being researched. The Belgrade-based Association of Spanish Fighters, established in 1946, cites a figure of 1,775 confirmed members. It estimates 595 of these were killed in Spain, and another 116 in Yugoslavia during World War II.\nThe ethnic composition of Yugoslavs is also unknown. A surviving personnel archive of the 129th International Brigade, compiled in Barcelona in May 1938, lists 1,052 people originating from Yugoslavia. Ethnicity data is missing for 140 of them, and the remaining 912 are listed as 48% Croats, 23% Slovenes, 18% Serbs, 3.2% Montenegrins and 1.5% Macedonians.\nThe matter is further complicated by the fact that only about a quarter (421) is estimated to have come directly from Yugoslavia. The rest were predominantly working class Yugoslavs who had emigrated elsewhere and then came to Spain from other countries, such as France (420), Belgium (191), the Soviet Union (84), Canada (83), the United States (57), and others.\nData about political affiliations of volunteers is also incomplete. Spanish sources say that out of 1,040 Yugoslavs on record some 561 self-described as communists, ten as social-democrats, eight were affiliated with the Croatian Peasant Party and four were anarchists. The remaining 457 had no political affiliation to declare.\nLegacy\n*A street in New Belgrade, a municipality of Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, bears the name [http://www.planplus.rs/ulica/20853/beograd-novi-beograd-spanskih-boraca Španskih boraca] (Spanish fighters).\n*The People's Library in Podgorica, Montenegro is named after Radosav Ljumović, a Montenegrin volunteer in the Spanish Civil War.\n*The \"Španski Borci\" cultural centre in Ljubljana, Slovenia, is named after the Yugoslav volunteers in the Spanish Civil War.\nNotable people\n* Đorđe Andrejević-Kun (1904–1964)\n*  (1912–1999)\n*  (1914–2001)\n*  (1904–1942)\n*  (1914–1941)\n* Aleš Bebler (1907–1981)\n*  (1905–1942)\n*  (1905–1989)\n*  (1913–1942)\n*  (1913–1937)\n* Milan Blagojević Španac (1905–1941)\n*  (1912–1986)\n*  (1897–1941)\n*  (1905–1995)\n*  (1910–1942)\n* August Cesarec (1893–1941)\n*  (1911–1944)\n*  (1914–2010)\n* Rodoljub Čolaković (1900–1983)\n* Milan Ćopić (1897–1941)\n* Vladimir Ćopić (1891–1939)\n* Matija Šiprak (1913–1937)\n*  (1912–1941)\n*  (1917–1941)\n*  (1905–1938)\n*  (1914–1943)\n*  (1905–1974)\n*  (1912–1942)\n*  (1909–1941)\n* Peko Dapčević (1913–1999)\n*  (1907–1941)\n* Robert Domany (1918–1942)\n* Žikica Jovanović Španac (1914–1942)\n* Petar Drapšin (1914–1945)\n*  (1912–1942)\n* Ivan Gošnjak (1909–1980)\n*  (1914–1944)\n*  (1895–1941)\n*  (1884–1959)\n*  (1903–1942)\n*  (1900–1936)\n*  (1903–1989)\n*  (1905–1994)\n*  (1906–1974)\n*  (1910–1942)\n*  (1914–1976)\n*  (1901–1939)\n* Žikica Jovanović Španac (1914–1942)\n*  (1908–1942)\n*  (1911–1943)\n*  (1914–2004)\n*  (1911–1944)\n*  (1884–1946)\n* Josip Kopinič (1911–1997)\n*  (1912–1938)\n* Veljko Kovačević (1912–1994)\n*  (1906–1986)\n*  (1913–1992)\n* Josip Križaj (1911–1948)\n* Dušan Kveder (1915–1966)\n*  (1916–1941)\n*  (1905–1942)\n* Branko Krsmanović (1915–1941)\n*  (1906–1945)\n*  (1915–2006)\n*  (1913–1986)\n* Vladimir Majder (1911–1943)\n*  (1902–1939)\n*  (1914–1979)\n*  (1910–1937)\n*  (1895–1963)\n*  (1902–1987)\n*  (1919–1942)\n* Kosta Nađ (1911–1986)\n* Guido Nonveiller (1913–2002)\n* Gojko Nikoliš (1911–1995)\n*  (1904–1942)\n* Marko Orešković (1896–1941)\n* Blagoje Parović (1903–1937)\n*  (1913–1943)\n* Boško Petrović (1911–1937)\n*  (1913–1942)\n* Koča Popović (1908–1992)\n* Vlado Popović (1914–1972)\n*  (1901–1944)\n*  (1911–1941)\n*  (1915–1963)\n*  (1908–1937)\n* Franc Rozman (1911–1944)\n* Ivan Rukavina (1912–1992)\n*  (1915–1941)\n*  (1914–1941)\n*  (1913–1943)\n* Drago Štajnberger (1916–1942)\n*  (1911–1984)\n*  (1915–1985)\n*  (1913–1937)\n*  (1914–1990)\n*  (1900–1978)\n*  (1912–1993)\n*  (1915–1997)\n*  (1896–1937)\n*  (1911–1991)\n*  (1907–1941)\n* Veljko Vlahović (1914–1975)\n*  (1901–1943)\n* Ratko Vujović (1916–1977)\n*  (1905–1941)\n*  (1903–1977)\n*  (1913–1944)\n*  (1918–1942)\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*[http://www.rastko.rs/rastko-ru/delo/12909 Живојин Павловић, Биланс совјетског термидора: Приказ и открића о делатности и организацији Стаљинског терора]\n*[http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=139062 Свједочанства о Далматинцима у Шпањолском грађанском рату]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160706060327/http://www.isi.mod.gov.rs/images/biblioteka/vig_feb_2008_print.pdf др Август Лешник - „Крв и живот за слободу“ – Југословени интербригадисти у Шпанији (1936—1939)]\n*MDC \"[http://www.mdc.hr/muzealci-ispis_en.aspx?muzealacId=87&print=yes Mihovil Vojnović]\" Retrieved 2012-02-29\n*Beogradski Short Film Festival \"[https://archive.today/20120912023221/http://www.shortfilmfest.org/52nd/eng/specijal12.htm In Memoriam]\" Retrieved 2012-02-29\n* Website of the Association of Yugoslav Volunteers, «[http://www.yuinterbrigade.org/ YuInterBrigade]»\n* YouTube «[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DihY6PKBPA8 Naši Španci - Jugoslaveni u Španjolskom građanskom ratu]» (Gallery)"
