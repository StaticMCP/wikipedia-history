The site includes effigy mounds in the shape of a water spirit, a bird, and two bears, along with several linear and conical mounds. The mounds were built during the Late Woodland period between roughly 700 and 1000 A.D., the era in which most effigy mounds in Wisconsin were built. The site was maintained by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation as a wayside until 2006, when the Ho-Chunk Nation took ownership of the property.\nThe site was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 20, 1998.\nReferences\nExternal links"
