With a height of 697.8 meters it is the highest peak in the Schnee Eifel and third highest in the Eifel.\nGeography\nLocation\nThe Schwarzer Mann rises in the west of the Eifel in the Schnee Eifel, near the border with Belgium and within the High Fens-Eifel Nature Park. Its mountain summit lies around 3&nbsp;kilometres west of Halenfeld (part of Buchet), 3.8&nbsp;km west-northwest of  Wascheid (part of Gondenbrett) and 3.3&nbsp;km (each as the crow flies) north of  Sellerich; the boundary between Buchet and Sellerich runs over the top. In the vicinity is the town of Prüm to the southeast as well as the villages of Bleialf to the west-southwest and Ormont to the northeast. On the northern slopes of the mountain rises the Alfbach stream, on the eastern mountainside, the Litzenmehlenbach and on its southern slopes, the Mönbach.\nNear the summit is the Tranchotstein. This small boundary stone was named after French geographer, Jean Joseph Tranchot (1752–1815), who undertook a survey of the Rhinelands by order of Napoleon Bonaparte.\nGeology\nThe Schwarzer Mann is made of quartzite which is also 15-kilometers-long.\nUsage\nThe area surrounding of Schwarzer Mann is a well-developed hiking area and the largest skiing area in Rhineland-Palatinate.\nFlora and fauna\nThe heavily wooded mountain ridge is covered mainly with spruce and is host to a number of rare wild species including the European wildcat.\nName\nThe name of the mountain is derived from the nearby abandoned lead ore mine in Bleialf from which the miners would return with blackened faces.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110718202830/http://www.blockhaus-schwarzer-mann.de/de/index.htm Skiing area Schwarzer Mann]\n* [http://www.pruem.de/touristik/wolfsschlucht.html Website of the city Pruem]"
