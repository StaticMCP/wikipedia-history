The event was the first Grammy ceremony not to be held in either New York City or Los Angeles (the 64th Grammys, staged in Las Vegas in 2022, would be the second).  The 15th Grammys were also the first to be broadcast live on CBS, which has carried every Grammy telecast since.\nPerformers\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Artist(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Song(s)\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Mike Curb Congregation\n| Medley\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Loggins & Messina\n| \"Your Mama Don't Dance\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Charley Pride\n| \"Kiss An Angel Good Mornin'\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | The Staple Singers\n| \"I'll Take You There\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Donna Fargo\n| \"Happiest Girl in the Whole USA\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Mac Davis\n| \"Baby, Don't Get Hooked on Me\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Helen Reddy\n| \"I Am Woman\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Andy Williams\n| Medley of Song of the Year nominees:  \"Alone Again (Naturally)\"  \"Song Sung Blue\"  \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\"  \"American Pie\"  \"The Summer Knows\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Curtis Mayfield\n| \"Freddie's Dead\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Don McLean\n| \"Vincent\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Gilbert O'Sullivan\n| \"Alone Again (Naturally)\"\n|}\nPresenters\n* The 5th Dimension -
