The attraction is an Arts Council England Accredited Museum and holds a number of awards, including the TripAdvisor Hall of Fame, the Sandford Award for Heritage Education and the VisitEngland Quality Rose Marque. The centre was famed for its multi-sensory interpretation and lifelike manequins when it opened, winning the Attraction of the Year from the English Tourism Board and the Blue Peter Children's Museum of the Year award in 1993. It depicts the 1950s heyday of Great Grimsby's world famous fishing fleet, using displays consisting of preserved trawler interiors and carefully crafted recreations. The centre is also home to three historic fishing vessels. Perseverance is a sail trawler built in Boston Lincolnshire and is displayed in the main atrium of the museum.
