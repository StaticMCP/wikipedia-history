Democrats were elected in all Boroughs except Queens. This and Democratic victories in other contests were all a part of what was considered \"a Crushing Defeat to [the] City G.O.P. [delivered]\" by Tammany Hall.\n{|class = \"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ class = \"nowrap\"|Summary of results by Borough\n|-\n!Borough !!|Democratic candidate, vote, % !!| Republican candidate, vote, %\n|-\n|style=\"background:aqua;\"|Manhattan ||Julius Miller, 237,981, 71.77%||Fay, 93,605, 28.23%\n|-\n|style=\"background:magenta;\"|The Bronx ||Henry Bruckner, 168,484, 77.52%|| Welsch, 48,850, 22.48%\n|-\n|style=\"background:red;\"|Brooklyn || James J.
