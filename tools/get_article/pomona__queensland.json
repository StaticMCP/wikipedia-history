In the , the locality of Pomona had a population of 2,931.\nGeography\nThe locality of Pomona is bounded to the south by the Bruce Highway and along most of its northern boundary by Six Mile Creek.\nThe township of Pomona is surrounded by rural residential acreage properties and small farms. A significant portion of the locality is within Yurol State Forest, a legacy of days past when the town once was a centre of forestry activities. The forest is now preserved as koala habitat.\nMount Cooroora is in the south-west of the locality (), rising to . It is a high intrusive volcanic plug within the Tuchekoi National Park. It is approximately  south-west of the town. The surrounding area is of high importance to Aboriginal people and there are many sites of Indigenous cultural importance across the region. Mount Cooroora has significant landscape, social and economic values to the town, while its vertical columns are an attraction to geologists. It is a popular site in the cooler months for visiting tourists climbing to the summit to appreciate excellent views looking east to the Sunshine Coast and west into the Mary Valley. Hikers, horse riders and mountain bike riders use the excellent trail network at its base.\nPomona is within the Noosa Biosphere recognised by the United Nations Economic, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 2007 as a World Biosphere Reserve.\nHistory\nEarly to present\nPomona was first settled by Europeans in the late 1880s, but had been home to the Kabi Kabi/Gubbi Gubbi indigenous peoples for thousands of years before that. Early settlers collected timber from the area.\nPomona was renamed in 1900, after the Roman goddess of fruit, following the government rejection of the names Pinbarren and Cooroora. Its name avoided confusion with the neighbouring towns of Cooroy and Cooran and reflected the fertile nature in the area.\nThe state electoral district to which Pomona was part of from 1912 until 1992 was named Cooroora. The seat was renamed Noosa following the 1991 electoral district's re-shuffle. Pomona is in the Wide Bay federal electoral division.\nRailway\nThe railway to Pomona commenced operation in 1891, with the first station being a small wooden structure of about 12’x10’ and was under the supervision of Mrs. J.

Colonial buildings are also a feature of the town and can be viewed along a signed history walk.\nEmergency services\nThe first Pomona Fire and Rescue Station was commissioned in 1956 next to the Subway which often meant it was flooded during moderate to major storms. in 2015 it was replaced with a new station next to the Ambulance Station, this features a quad bay shed, indoor and out door training facilities.\nOn 17 July 1917, the Pomona branch of the Queensland ambulance service transport brigade (QATB) was established with the opening of Ambulance House in Ambulance Street, where the local Superintendent operated from.

In 1976 the primary school was relocated to the Ellis Estate to join the Pomona High School.\nIn 1945 the secondary department was established next door to the primary school. The department was moved in 1970 to the Ellis Estate as the Pomona High School, and joined later by the primary school in 1976. In 1995, the high school was moved again to its current location on Summit Road and renamed Cooroora Secondary College. On 25 September 2006, Cooroora Secondary College was made a campus of Noosa District State High School, with year 10 students forcibly transferred to the Cooroy campus from 2 September 2007. On 15 May 2007, a town meeting saw 687 Pomona residents sign a petition to cancel to the transfer of year 10 to Cooroy, cancel the transfer of the school to be under Noosa District State High School and to add years 11 and 12 to the school.

The structure is described as \"octagonal stone rotunda with a diameter of about ten feet. The base and pillars comprise stone obtained from, local quarries, and the structure is finished with a red tile roof. The floor is cemented and the ceiling of the rotunda is of asbestos sheeting painted white. An electric point is situated underneath an ornamental covering, and this will be utilised to provide an eternal flame when the North Coast electricity scheme has been extended to Pomona.\"\nIn 2018 a community effort saw the rotunda restored after the Council suggested the memorial be converted into a bus stop. The former electric light was restored and replaced with a modern 'eternal' flame style flame light that is automatically turned on every night. The surrounding gardens were cleaned up and restored by the Noosa and District Land Care.

Visitors may also walk to the top of Mount Cooroora, the solidified lava plug of an ancient volcano worn away over time.  Every July, thousands of people cheer 100 runners who race to the top of the mountain and back in under 30 minutes in the annual King of the Mountain. In the past, those not fit enough to race up the mountain participated in 'billy cart' races or the world thong throwing championships (thongs of the footwear variety) with the rules stating that a size 10 thong, or larger, was required.  As at 2010, the record throw was 42.8 metres.\nIn 2024, the Cooroy-Pomona Lions Club, organisers of the King of the Mountain Race, announced that the event will no longer be held, due to restrictions imposed by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service. The club said it will continue to conduct the associated annual Family Fun Day in Stan Topper Park.\nThe district's rural roots are celebrated every September with the staging of the annual \"show\" (county fair).  The Noosa Country Show has been a local institution since 1909.\nLocal food and craft markets are held every Saturday morning. Every month, environmentally aware enthusiasts collect and distribute seeds of native plants. A weekly swap of home-grown food is another activity enthusiastically embraced, as is permaculture.\nAttractions\nPomona is notable for its relaxed streetscape of distinctive timber and art deco buildings, the heritage-listed Majestic Theatre and the walk to the top of its imposing mountain sentinel Mount Cooroora in the Tuchekoi National Park. The Majestic, built in 1921, is claimed to be the world's oldest continuously operating silent movie theatre built for that purpose. However, it is not the first theatre in the world in which silent films were screened. The Majestic has been a community-owned enterprise since October 2006.\nAustralian musician Darren Hanlon's album \"Fingertips and Mountaintops\" was entirely recorded in the Majestic Theatre.\nThe Noosa Shire Museum contains objects, photographs and historic documents that explain much of the early history of the area. It is also a Keeping Place of indigenous sacred objects. The old Pomona Railway Station has been moved to the other side of the railway tracks to become the Railway Station Art Gallery.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://queenslandplaces.com.au/pomona University of Queensland: Queensland Places:Pomona]\n*[http://www.themajestictheatre.com.au/ Majestic Theatre home page]\nGeographical points of interest\n* Former Pomona Hospital ()\n* Pomona Post Office ()\n* Former ANZ Bank ()\n* Former Pomona State School location, Current Pomona Kindergarten and main town park ()\n* Soldiers Memorial Park & King George V Memorial ()\n* Former Railway Hotel location ()\n* Pomona Hotel ()"
