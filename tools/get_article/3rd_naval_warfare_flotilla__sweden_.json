The flotilla is located at Karlskrona Garrison and shares its location with the 1st Submarine Flotilla.\nHistory\nThe flotilla was established on 1 January 1983 as the 4th Surface Attack Flotilla, formed from the remnants of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla and the 1st Patrol Boat Flotilla, which had been disbanded in the preceding years.\nThe process of establishing the flotilla was problematic. There was no space available onboard any vessel within the flotilla to accommodate the headquarters, so it had to be temporarily based on land. Additionally, the financial constraints faced by the Swedish Armed Forces at the time were further complicated by efforts to digitalize the navy’s economic management. This shift to computerized systems made financial administration more difficult, as few personnel were familiar with the new technology.\nOrganization\nThe 3rd Naval Warfare Flotilla is unique among non-amphibious naval units in that it includes the only missile unit of its kind. The unit, known as the 311th Missile Unit, operates a highly mobile anti-ship missile system primarily used to support naval forces in engagements with other vessels.\nAs of 2024, the peacetime organization of the 3rd Naval Warfare Flotilla is as follows:\n*3rd Naval Warfare Flotilla\n**3rd Flotilla Staff\n**31st Corvette Division\n***311th Missile Unit\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n**33rd Mine Clearance Division\n***\n***\n***\n**34th Support Division\n***34th Support Unit\n***\nHeraldry and traditions\nCoat of arms\nThe coat of arms of the 3rd Surface Attack Flotilla (Tredje ytattackflottiljen) 1997–1998 and 3rd Surface Warfare Flotilla (Tredje ytstridsflottiljen 1998–2004.

The unit later adopted a new coat of arms.\nFile:Tredje ytstridsflottiljen vapen.svg|Coat of arms of the 3rd Surface Attack Flotilla (Tredje ytattackflottiljen) 1997–1998 and 3rd Surface Warfare Flotilla (Tredje ytstridsflottiljen) 1998–2004.\nFile:3. sjöstridsflottiljen vapen.svg|Coat of arms of the 3rd Surface Warfare Flotilla (Tredje ytstridsflottiljen) and the 3rd Naval Warfare Flotilla (3. sjöstridsflottiljen).\nFlag\nThe flag is a double swallow-tailed Swedish flag.
