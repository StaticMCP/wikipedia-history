He received his first parish on 13 October 1372; he was at various times, rector or prebend of Ashton-under-Lyne, New Lafford, Sleaford, Swineshead, Grindall (in the East Riding of Yorkshire), Manchester, Oxton and Cropwell, Riccall, and Ketton; frequently in plurality.\nHe was responsible for (in 1420) building St. Luke's church in Brislington. He enlarged Manchester Cathedral into a collegiate church in 1421. There is a statue of him on the exterior of the Manchester town hall.\nHe inherited the title and lands when his brother John died on 27 July 1398; but asked, three years later, to be excused from Parliament. (He was summoned, on pain of his life, in 1403.) He died, and was presumably buried, at his then parish of Swineshead, Lincolnshire.\nNotes\n*"
