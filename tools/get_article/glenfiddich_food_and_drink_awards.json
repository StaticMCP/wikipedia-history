The awards had been sponsored since 1972 by William Grant & Sons, a family-owned Scottish distiller that produces Glenfiddich, a Speyside single malt Scotch whisky.\nIn total 12 awards were made annually.\nIn 2008, Glenfiddich discontinued the Food and Drink Awards, reviewing their \"strategy, scope and potential application in some of Glenfiddich’s key markets outside the UK\".\nSee also\n* Glenfiddich Spirit of Scotland Awards\nExternal links\n*[http://www.glenfiddich.com Glenfiddich website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20031215232538/http://www.glenfiddich.com/foodanddrink/ Glenfiddich Food and Drink Awards official website]"
