Voters chose 33 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nNew York voted for the National Union candidate, incumbent Republican president Abraham Lincoln and his running mate Andrew Johnson. They defeated the Democratic candidate George B. McClellan and his running mate George H. Pendleton. Lincoln won the state by a bare margin of 0.92%.\nAlthough he lost the state, New York would prove to be McClellan's fourth strongest state after Kentucky, New Jersey, and Delaware.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1864 United States presidential election in New York\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#FF3333; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | National Union\n| Abraham Lincoln (incumbent)\n| align=\"right\" | 368,735\n| align=\"right\" | 50.46%\n| align=\"right\" | 33\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic\n| George B.
