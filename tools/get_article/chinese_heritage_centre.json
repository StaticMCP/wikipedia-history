As the first and only university institute for the study of overseas Chinese, it serves as a research centre, a library and a museum.\nHistory\nThe centre's building was constructed between 1953 and 1955 with a donation from businessman Lim Lean Teng. Designed in the traditional Chinese architectural style, it originally served as the Administration Building of Nanyang University. Nanyang University was the only Chinese-medium university outside of China. In 1981, the Singapore government established the English-medium Nanyang Technological Institute on the former Nanyang University campus, with the building continuing to use Chinese.\nOn 17 May 1995, the Chinese Heritage Centre was established as a non-profit organisation with an international board of governors comprising prominent Chinese business leaders, scholars, and public servants. In December 1999, it was designated as a national monument of Singapore. In 2011, the Chinese Heritage Centre was restructured into an autonomous institute under NTU. It is primarily funded through private donations and government matching grants on a 1:1 basis.\nFacilities\nLocated within the campus of NTU in Jurong West, Singapore, the centre houses the Wang Gungwu Library and an overseas Chinese museum. According to its website, the museum holds two exhibitions, including Chinese More Or Less: An Exhibition on Overseas Chinese Identity and Nantah Pictorial Exhibition.\nSee also\n* The Encyclopedia of the Chinese Overseas\nReferences"
