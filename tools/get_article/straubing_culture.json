It was recognized as an autonomous culture by Karl Schumacher in 1917.\nCharacteristics\nEconomy\nThe economy was sustained mainly by agriculture and the herding of diverse animal species. Important was also the metallurgic sector.\nDwellings\nHamlets constituted by one or two long-houses placed west of their graveyards. The houses were made of wood, with a North-South orientation; basically were longhouses composed by one or two naves.\nBurials\nThe burial practices continued the Bell Beaker Culture rites involving sex-differentiated body positioning in a crouched position as with the orientation of the tomb. Some objects found with buried individuals were bronze daggers, bracelets, and even objects made of amber.\nGenetic profile\nY-DNA analysis with enough genetic coverage was obtained from 21 male individuals buried in the Lech valley, five sampled individuals had derived alleles placing them on the lineage spanning R1b-M269 to R1b-L11/P310, but were not covered at P312/S116; 15 sampled males had the subvariant R1b-P312/S116* (with no more derived alleles further downstream called). There was only a male from the I clade. The autosomal composition detected was ~13% Western HG, ~47% Anatolian farmer, ~38% Yamnaya.\nGallery\nFile:GBM - Bronzezeit 6a Keramik.jpg\nFile:GBM - Bronzezeit 8 Scheibenkopfnadeln.jpg\nBibliography\n* Gustav Behrens: Straubinger Stufe.
