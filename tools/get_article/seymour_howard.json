His father was William Albert Howard (1854-1940) and his mother, Elizabeth Mary Seymour. He married Edith Maud Turner on 10 September 1913. They had two sons:\nSir Hamilton Edward de Coucey Howard, 2nd Baronet (1915-2001).\nDavid Seymour de Coucey Howard (1919-1954). Later, they resided at Adelaide Crescent in Hove, East Sussex. He became a Knight Commander in the Order of Christ of Portugal and a Knight of Grace in the Order of St. John of Jerusalem.\nIn February 1955, he was knighted. Ten months later, in December of that year, he became Sir Seymour Howard, 1st Baronet of Great Rissington.\nCareer\nHe was a Director of Home and Foreign Securities Corporation.\nIn September 1930 he was adopted by Chippenham Liberal Association as their prospective parliamentary candidate. Chippenham was regarded by the Liberal party as a good prospect, given that their candidate in 1929 had come second, only 1,731 votes behind the winning Conservative. At the time Howard was also living in Corsham, which was a part of the constituency. However, in the political climate of 1931, his Conservative opponent was seen as the most natural candidate in support of the newly formed National Government;\nIn May 1938 Howard agreed to stand again for parliament at the 1938 Barnsley by-election as a Liberal candidate in support of the National Government. Barnsley had last been won by a Liberal at the 1931 General Election. Following the Liberal split of that year, the Barnsley Liberal Association had supported its MPs decision to join the Liberal National breakaway. The Barnsley Conservative Association had chosen not to run candidates of their own and instead support Liberal National candidates. However, Labour had easily regained the seat in 1935. Howard received Conservative support and might have hoped to re-gain the seat but was well beaten;\nDuring the Second World War, he worked at the Ministry of Aircraft Production. He served as Sheriff of the City of London in 1944 and Lord Mayor of London in 1954, as well as Alderman of the City of London from 1945 to 1960. He was a Conservative Party member of the London County Council from 1946 to 1949 representing the City of London.\nReferences"
