Rosewell was an American politician who served as Cook County treasurer.\nEarly life\nRosewell was born in 1924 or 1925. He was the youngest son of his parents. His father was a truck driver, and his mom was a homemaker.\nRosewell grew up in the Garfield Park neighborhood on the West Side of Chicago. He went to Our Lady of Sorrows Elementary School and St. Philip High School. He graduated from DePaul University.\nCareer\nRosewell served two years in the United States Army.\nRosewell began his political career as a young man, working in the 24th Ward of Chicago as a precinct captain.\nIn the 1950s he became involved in a Young Democrats group, helping found the organization. Other members at the time included Richard Mell, Ted Lechowicz, and Harry Comerford.\nRosewell served as executive director of the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority. He served as a commissioner of the Chicago Park District.\nHe worked in the private sector as a vice president in the public funds division of Continental Illinois. He worked there until 1974. During his time with the bank, he won election to the Illinois Constitutional Convention as a delegate from the 18th legislative district. At the convention he spoke in favor of allowing the legislature to establish a lottery.\nCook County Treasurer\nIn 1974, Richard J. Daley asked Rosewell to run for Cook County treasurer. As the Democratic nominee, he was elected.\nHe was reelected in 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990, and 1994.\nIn 1984, he was acquitted of bank fraud by a jury. He had been indicted on June 8, 1983. It had been alleged that he had understated debts from a failed clothing venture of his in order to qualify to receive loans from banks which also held substantial deposits from the county government.\nUnder indictment, Rosewell opted not to seek reelection in the 1998 election to what would have been a seventh term. In the autumn of 1998, he resigned after pleading guilty to charges of having put two state legislators (Bruce Farley and Miguel Santiago) in ghost jobs in the treasurer's office, which gave thousands of dollars in salary and benefits in exchange for little or no work. During his trial, federal prosecutors argued that Rosewell's office had widespread corruption and nepotism.\nDeath\nRosewall died at Riverside Medical Center in Kankakee, Illinois on July 29, 1999, from a chronic liver ailment related to hepatitis C. After his death, his former spokesman Tom Leach said that he had suffered this ailment since 1996.\nAfter his death, a federal judge vacated his conviction, saying that Rosewell had been mentally unfit when he signed his plea agreement.\nPersonal life\nRosewell as a devout catholic, and once met Pope John Paul II.
