It is analogous to the position of president of the Legislative Assembly of the Azores and both are equally 14th in the Portuguese order of precedence, being this the highest ranking position of any regional governing body.\nFollowing the first Madeiran regional elections the same year, which resulted in the Democratic Peoples' Party (now Social Democratic Party) having the majority of members of parliament, Emanuel Nascimento dos Santos Rodrigues was elected the first president of the Legislative Assembly. The position has since been held by members of the same party, which has never lost its majority. The current President is Rubina Leal, the first woman to hold the post.\nTwo of the presidents were physicians (Nélio and Miguel Mendonça), two were/are lawyers (Rodrigues and Tranquada Gomes) and one (Leal) a Sociologist before taking office.\nList of presidents\nThe colors indicate the political affiliation of each president.\n:\n:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Term\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" |President\n(Birth–Death)\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Portrait\n! colspan=\"2\" |Term of office\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Party\n|- style=\"background: #cccccc\"\n! style=\"width: 150px;\" | Took office\n! style=\"width: 150px;\" | Left office\n|- style=\"background:#DCDCDC\"\n! colspan=\"7\" |Legislative Assembly of Madeira (1976–present)\n|- style=\"background:#FFCC99\"\n| I\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:; color:white;\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Emanuel Rodrigues (born 1943)\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" |19 July 1976\n| rowspan=\"2\" |8 November 1984\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Social Democratic\n|- style=\"background:#FFCC99\"\n| II\n|- style=\"background:#FFCC99\"\n| III\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background:; color:white;\" |\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Nélio Mendonça(1930–2009)\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n| rowspan=\"3\" |8 November 1984\n| rowspan=\"3\" |1994\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Social Democratic\n|- style=\"background:#FFCC99\"\n| IV\n|- style=\"background:#FFCC99\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" |V\n|- style=\"background:#FFCC99\"\n| rowspan=\"6\" style=\"background:; color:white;\" |\n| rowspan=\"6\" |Miguel Mendonça(born 1935)\n| rowspan=\"6\" |\n| rowspan=\"6\" |1994\n| rowspan=\"6\" |20 April 2015\n| rowspan=\"6\" |Social Democratic\n|- style=\"background:#FFCC99\"\n| VI\n|- style=\"background:#FFCC99\"\n| VII\n|- style=\"background:#FFCC99\"\n| VIII\n|- style=\"background:#FFCC99\"\n| IX\n|- style=\"background:#FFCC99\"\n| X\n|- style=\"background:#FFCC99\"\n| XI\n| rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:; color:white;\" |\n| José Tranquada Gomes(born 1958)\n|\n| 20 April 2015\n| 15 October 2019\n| Social Democratic\n|- style=\"background:#C2E2F8\"\n| style=\"background:#FFCC99\"| XII\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background:; color:white;\" |\n| rowspan=\"3\" | José Manuel Rodrigues(born 1960)\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 15 October 2019\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 10 April 2025\n| rowspan=\"3\" | CDS – People's Party\n|- style=\"background:#C2E2F8\"\n| style=\"background:#FFCC99\"| XIII\n|- style=\"background:#C2E2F8\"\n| style=\"background:#FFCC99\"| XIV\n|- style=\"background:#FFCC99\"\n| style=\"background:#FFCC99\"| XV\n| rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:; color:white;\" |\n| Rubina Leal(born 1966)\n|\n| 10 April 2025\n| Incumbent\n| Social Democratic\n|- style=\"background:#C2E2F8\"\n|}\nReferences and footnotes"
