The full version of the game was released on 21 October 2013 as playable in North America and Europe. The game was developed with Crytek's in-house CryEngine 3. Warface: Clutch centers around online firefights in player versus player (PvP) matches, with microtransactions allowing players to purchase weapons, equipment, and cosmetic gear. The Xbox 360 port, which was developed by Crytek UK, was discontinued in February 2015. The console version of the game was relaunched for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2018 and on the Nintendo Switch in 2020. Members of the game's development team split from Crytek Kiev in February 2019 to form a new development studio, Blackwood Games, who will handle future development duties for Warface: Clutch. A tactical shooter spin-off game named Warface: Breakout was released on 26 May 2020 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.\nGameplay\n2013]]\nClasses and weapons\nPlayers can choose between five different classes: Sniper, Rifleman, Engineer, Medic, or SED (humanoid robot). Each class has its own specific combat role, with Medics reviving fallen and healing injured teammates, Engineers restoring and repairing armor and being able to revive SEDs, Riflemen providing additional ammunition, SEDs for suppressive fire and eliminating large groups of enemies in a short amount of time, and Snipers for engaging in long-range firefights.\nEach class comes has its own unique weapons and equipment, often split into two categories. Riflemen can choose between a variety of assault rifles and light machine guns, and have the ability to distribute ammunition to themselves and other players. Snipers can wield bolt-action and semi-automatic marksman and sniper rifles. Medics have access to automatic and pump action shotguns, as well as the ability to heal and revive teammates. Engineers can use SMGs and personal defense weapons, and can replenish armor, place explosive mines, revive SEDs and quickly interact with explosives. SEDs however, are different as they have access to heavy weaponry, as well as a grenade launcher that does medium damage along with a flash effect.\nEvery class carries a secondary firearm, and an additional melee weapon. Each soldier's tool belt is supplied with a hand grenade, and can be modified or expanded with extra smoke or flash-bang grenades. The Engineer can also carry anti-personnel mines. Weapons have customization slots that can be used to outfit a firearm with scopes, bipods, handles, flash guards, and suppressors.\nGame modes\nPlayers can compete online in PvP matches. [Such as: Team Death Match, Free For All, Storm, and many more.] Or combine their efforts against AI-controlled enemies in PvE battles, as well as Spec Ops. As players complete matches and missions, they can earn Experience Points, Warface Dollars, and Vendor Points. The amount of rewards earned varies depending on the number of players, the mission played, the mission's duration, the amount of checkpoints, and other criteria.\nIn-game currency\nWarface Dollars can be used to rent weapons, and purchase armor and other items. Experience Points allow each player increase their personal Rank (level) in the game. Vendor Points are used to progress through the Arsenal tree, which features three categories of items that are unlocked in line with the player's in-game progression: Weapons, Attachments, and Equipment. VIP Booster Packs, which can be purchased from the in-game store, allow the player to earn additional Experience Points, Warface Dollars, and Vendor Points after a match. Another form of in-game currency, Kredits,(Ks) are a premium currency that allow the purchase of the VIP Booster packs, player skins, bundles, special weapons, and more. Kredits are purchased with real-world money and are often required to purchase high-end items including but not limited to: golden guns, skinned guns, boxes, and armor.\nDevelopment\n2015]]\nIn August 2011, Crytek announced that Warface would be released for PC in Western markets in 2012.
