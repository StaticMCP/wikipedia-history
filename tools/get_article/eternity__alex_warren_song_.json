It was released on July 18, 2025, through Atlantic Records as the fourth single from his debut studio album, ''You'll Be Alright, Kid, which was released on the same day. Warren wrote the track alongside Adam Yaron, Cal Shapiro, and Mags Duval, with Yaron also serving as producer.\nBackground and composition\nOn July 14, 2025, four days before the release of his debut studio album You'll Be Alright, Kid, Warren discussed the inspiration behind \"Eternity\". The song was written in response to personal grief, reflecting on the deaths of both of his parents; his father died of cancer when Warren was nine, his mother died due to alcohol-related issues. In an interview with Los Angeles Times'', he noted that some listeners had envisioned the track being played at their weddings. He compared this response to the reception of Lewis Capaldi's 2019 single \"Someone You Loved\", which was similarly interpreted as romantic despite its actual meaning.\nDescribed as \"a powerful song about loss and missing your special person\", the track features Warren's \"deep, chesty baritone\", which transitions into a \"more conventional pop pitch\". The minimalist production includes acoustic plucks, vocal harmonies and a subdued backing choir. The song was released on July 18, 2025, as both the opening track and third single from his debut studio album.\nLyrics and meaning\nFramed as a reflective ballad, \"Eternity\" voices first-person mourning and addresses an absent “you,” using images of time, light and separation to portray ongoing grief and continued attachment beyond loss; the lyric returns to the line “feels like an eternity” and references “paradise” and “chasing the light.” Music publications characterized the track as a “heartbreaking” ballad, emphasizing its plaintive tone and cathartic swell.\nCritical reception\nTim Strong of Showbiz By PS cited the song as an example of the album's \"extremely formulaic and calculated\" nature, noting that it contains \"surface-level catchy moments with potential for virality\" but lacks \"substance\".\nMusic video\nThe accompanying music video was released on July 18, 2025.\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Weekly chart performance for \"Eternity\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2025)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Croatia International Airplay (Top lista)\n| 27\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Greece International (IFPI)\n| 33\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Iceland (Tónlistinn)\n| 15\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Lebanon (Lebanese Top 20)\n| 9\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania (AGATA)\n| 86\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania Airplay (TopHit)\n| 27\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Luxembourg (Billboard)\n| 9\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Malta Airplay (Radiomonitor)\n| 15\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Poland (Polish Airplay Top 100)\n| 28\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Poland (Polish Streaming Top 100)\n| 76\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Portugal (AFP) NOTE: Replace citation with the template if portuguesecharts.com is updated.-->\n| 58\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Romania Airplay (TopHit)\n| 148\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nMonthly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Monthly chart performance for \"Eternity\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2025)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Estonia Airplay (TopHit)\n| 13\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania Airplay (TopHit)\n| 40\n|-\n|}\nCertifications\nReferences"
