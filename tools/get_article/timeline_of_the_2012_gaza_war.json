The IDF also struck against 20 Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip, including underground rocket launchers and an ammunition warehouse stocking Iranian-made, long-range Fajr-5 missiles. The IDF said that many of the targeted weapon stashes were in residential areas and evidenced \"the pattern of Hamas to use the population in Gaza as human shields.\" Israel claims to have destroyed most of this long-range capability.

Hamas argued that the IDF bombed a Hamas commander's house in Gaza during the ceasefire, something the IDF strongly denied, and accused Hamas of violating the cease fire.\nMohammed Sadallah, a four-year-old Gazan boy, was killed after an explosion in Annazla. Initially it was stated by Hamas to have been caused by an Israeli bomb. However, experts from the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights examined the site and opined the explosion was caused by a Palestinian rocket. They boy's mother acknowledged that either case could be possible. According to the New York Times, \"the damage was nowhere near severe enough to have come from an Israeli F-16, raising the possibility that an errant missile fired by Palestinian militants was responsible for the deaths.\" Israel denied that it carried out any attacks in the area at the time. The Associated Press reported that \"no one appeared to have witnessed the strike\" and that \"local security officials quickly took what remained of the projectile, making it impossible to verify who fired it.\" The Egyptian prime minister was filmed lifting the body saying \"the boy, the martyr...is something that we cannot keep silent about,\" before promising to defend the Palestinian people.\nThrough the evening of 16 November, around 500 rockets were fired from Gaza.

The IDF said that it targeted Hamas communications devices located on the roofs of two media buildings. It alleged Hamas was using journalists as human shields. Reporters without Borders (an international NGO focused on issues of freedom of the press) issued a strong condemnation of the attacks. Christophe Deloire, the director of RWB, described the attacks as unjustified and as a threat to freedom of information, stating that \"even though the outlets targeted are linked to Hamas, it does not legitimize the attacks.\" The attacks injured five people; one cameraman lost his leg. Lieutenant Colonel Avital Leibovich responded by urging journalists to avoid areas with any Hamas presence whatsoever, while another Israeli government official stated that the offices of both Al Quds and Al Aqsa were legitimate military targets. Sam Kiley, a correspondent for Sky News who was present during the attack, said that there was 'reason to disbelieve' Israel's official account of the incident, and that he believes the incident demonstrates that no civilian in Gaza can feel safe. The Foreign Press Association also issued a statement expressing concern over the strike, and pointing to a UN Security Council statement that condemned all attacks against journalists in combat zones.\nRockets were launched from Gaza towards Tel-Aviv, which were intercepted by Tel Aviv's iron dome.

Fourteen more people were killed in total in the other attacks of that day. According to Israel, the target was Yehiya Rabiah, allegedly a senior commander of rocket operations. A relative of the al-Dalu family said, however, people in the area have never heard of the man before. \"I have never heard such a name (Yihia Abayah). This is nonsense\", he said to Reuters. The IDF now says of the strike that it was intentional and that the target was Mohamed al-Dalu, a police officer who died in the strike. After the change in explanation, IDF spokeswoman Avital Leibovich accused him of being \"a known terror operative affiliated with the military wing of Hamas\", though neighbors of the family state there is no connection between the al-Dalu family and militant groups.
