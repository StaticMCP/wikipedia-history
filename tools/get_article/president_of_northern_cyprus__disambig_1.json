Rauf Denktaş was the first and founding president of Northern Cyprus, and retired in 2005. His position was taken over by Mehmet Ali Talat, followed by Derviş Eroğlu, then Mustafa Akıncı, Ersin Tatar, and the current president, Tufan Erhürman.\nThe president is elected every five years. Presidential elections are held in two rounds if no candidate gains more than 50% of the votes in the first round. It is necessary that the president is originated from the island of Cyprus. The president must have lived in the country for five years, received secondary education and be over 30 years old.\nThe presidency is not a ceremonial position in the semi-presidential political system of Northern Cyprus. The president reserves the right to dismiss the Assembly of the Republic in case a government cannot be formed within sixty days or three successive governments receive votes of no confidence. They also can preside over the Council of Ministers if they wish to do so, approve the appointments of the judges and president of the Supreme Court and have the right to send laws approved by the Assembly of the Republic to the Supreme Court. The president has also traditionally been the chief negotiator for the resolution of the Cyprus dispute and been responsible for the foreign relations of Northern Cyprus.\nThe president is represented by the speaker of the Assembly of the Republic when the president is abroad.\nThe most recent presidential election was held on 19 October 2025. Tufan Erhürman is the current president.\nList of presidents of Northern Cyprus (1975–present)\nPresident of the Turkish Federated State of Cyprus (1975–1983)\nThe Turkish Federated State of Cyprus was intended as an autonomous part of Cyprus, but was rejected by the government of the Republic of Cyprus.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!\n!
