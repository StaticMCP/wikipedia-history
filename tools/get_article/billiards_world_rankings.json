      "text": "# Billiards world rankings\n\nThe billiards world rankings are the official system of ranking English billiards players to determine automatic qualification and seeding for tournaments.\nThe rankings are maintained by the sport's governing body, World Billiards, a subsidiary of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association. A player's ranking is based on their performances in designated ranking tournaments. The ranking list rolls on at the end of each season, with every player's points being halved at the season switchover. A season begins on 1 July, and ends on 30 June of the following year.\nAs of 2012, the distinction between professional and amateur players was removed. Both male and female players are included on the list.\nTop Ranked Players\n, the top ranked player from 2016 to 2021]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!  !! colspan=\"4\" |Ranking\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Season || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4\n|-\n| Before 1989 ||  colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | No information\n|-\n| 1989–90 ||  Mike Russell ||  Norman Dagley ||  Ian Williamson ||  Peter Gilchrist\n|-\n| 1990–91 ||  Mike Russell ||  Peter Gilchrist ||  Ian Williamson ||  Norman Dagley\n|-\n| 1991–92 ||  Geet Sethi ||  Mike Russell || Robby Foldvari || Peter Gilchrist\n|-\n| 1992–93 ||  Geet Sethi ||  || ||\n|-\n| 1993–94 ||  Geet Sethi ||  Robby Foldvari ||  Mike Russell ||  Peter Gilchrist\n|-\n| 1995–96 ||  Mike Russell ||  Geet Sethi ||  Peter Gilchrist ||  Robby Foldvari\n|-\n| 2002–03 ||  Mike Russell ||  Peter Gilchrist ||  David Causier ||  Chris Shutt\n|-\n| 2003–04 ||  Mike Russell ||  Peter Gilchrist ||  David Causier ||  Chris Shutt\n|-\n| 2004–10 ||  colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | No official ranking list produced\n|-\n| 2010–11 ||  David Causier ||  Dhruv Sitwala || colspan=\"2\" |  Peter Gilchrist and  Robert Hall\n|-\n| 2011–12 ||  David Causier ||  Billy Bousfield ||  Phil Mumford ||  Robert Hall\n|-\n| 2012–13 ||  Mike Russell ||  Robert Hall ||  David Causier ||  Martin Goodwill\n|-\n| 2013–14 ||  David Causier ||  Peter Gilchrist ||  Robert Hall ||  Matthew Bolton\n|-\n| 2014–15 ||  David Causier ||  Peter Gilchrist ||  Robert Hall ||  Mike Russell\n|-\n| 2015–16 ||  David Causier ||  Peter Gilchrist ||  Robert Hall ||  Mike Russell\n|-\n| 2016–17 ||  Peter Gilchrist ||  David Causier ||  Robert Hall ||  Mike Russell\n|-\n| 2017–18 ||  Peter Gilchrist ||  David Causier ||  Robert Hall ||  Mike Russell\n|-\n| 2018–19 ||  Peter Gilchrist ||  David Causier ||  Robert Hall ||  Martin Goodwill\n|-\n| 2019–20||  Peter Gilchrist ||  David Causier ||  Robert Hall ||  Ryan Mears\n|-\n| 2020–21||  Peter Gilchrist ||  David Causier ||  Robert Hall ||  Ryan Mears\n|}\nNotes\n: Gilchrist and Hall were joint 3rd ranked.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.wbeventsonline.com/?page_id=214 World Billiards Current Ranking List]\n* [https://world-billiards.com/ranking-system/ World Billiards Ranking System]"
