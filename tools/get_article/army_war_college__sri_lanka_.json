With the re-designation of the former Army Training Centre as the Sri Lanka Military Academy (SLMA) in 1981, the Officers Study Centre (OSC) was established in the SLMA to conduct the Junior Staff Course, the Senior Tactics Course and the Senior Administration Course. Aimed at mid-career officers to develop basic command and staff techniques in the British tradition, for staff officer grade III/II appointments (officers in the ranks of Lieutenant / Captain / Major). With the end of the civil war, the Army established the Officer Career Development Centre in 2012 as a junior staff college with the Junior Command Course (JCC) and the Junior Staff Course (JSC) transferred to it from the OSC. OCDC initiated the Unit Command Course in 2018 and replaced it with the Senior Command Course for prospective battalion commanders in 2021. In December 2021, the OCDC was renamed as the Army War College.\nCourses\n* Senior Command Course (SCC) - 13 week course aimed at Lieutenant Colonels and Majors to become successful battalion commanders.\n* Junior Command Course (JCC) - 13 week course aimed at Majors and Captains to become successful grade II level command, staff, and instructional appointments.\n* Junior Staff Course (JSC) - 13 week course aimed at Captains and Lieutenants to become successful grade III level staff appointments.\nSee also\n*Higher Command and Staff Course\n*Defence Services Command and Staff College\n*Army School of Logistics\n*Naval and Maritime Academy\n*Sri Lanka Air Force Junior Command & Staff College\n*Army War College, Mhow\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://alt.army.lk/awc/ Army War College]"
