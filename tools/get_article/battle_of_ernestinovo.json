It was fought between Croatia, and SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia which was supported by the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA). The JNA took Ernestinovo then the battle for Antunovac began.\nCourse of the battle\nThe attack on Ernestinovo and Seles began on November 20. Before five o'clock in the morning on November 20, 1991, a fierce attack by the JNA and Croat Serbs on defenders, who defended Ernestinovo until their last breath, began from all surrounding strongholds.\nAll the force fell on Ernestinovo that day - from aerial rocket fire to rocket fire with multi-barreled launchers and grenades, from all calibers of artillery and armored vehicles, all with infantry attacks. 11 tanks moved to the place and the defenders had nothing to defend themselves.\nThe fact that the place was inhabited made it even more difficult for the defenders, so around noon they started pulling people out of the southern part of the village towards Osijek.\nThat day and the next day, 27 people died, some civilians, some soldiers. A total of 41 people died in Ernestinovo.\nReferences"
