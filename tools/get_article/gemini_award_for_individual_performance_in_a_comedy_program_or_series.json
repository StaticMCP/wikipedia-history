However, as Canadian television comedy was dominated in that era primarily by sketch comedy, comedy-drama or stand-up performance shows, rather than traditional sitcoms, comedy performance categories were discontinued after the 2nd Gemini Awards in 1987; for the next few years, performances in comedy-drama shows were eligible to be nominated in the drama performance categories, while sketch comedy performers could be nominated for Best Performance in a Variety or Performing Arts Program or Series.\nBeginning with the 6th Gemini Awards in 1992, the Academy introduced a single award for Best Performance in a Comedy Program or Series, whose winners or nominees could be either an individual or an ensemble; separate awards for individual performance and ensemble performance were then introduced for the 16th Gemini Awards in 2001.\nAfter 2010, with the reemergence of scripted comedy series in Canadian television, the category was discontinued. Separate categories for Best Actor in a Comedy Series and Best Actress in a Comedy Series were reintroduced, alongside new categories for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series and Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, as of the 26th Gemini Awards in 2011. Since 2012, all four of the separate categories have continued to be presented as part of the contemporary Canadian Screen Awards.\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#bebebe;\"\n! style=\"width:8%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:19%;\"| Actor\n! style=\"width:19%;\"| Series\n! style=\"width:2%;\"| Ref\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\"| 2001  16th Gemini Awards\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Jason Rouse\n| Comedy Now!\n|\n|-\n| Glen Foster\n| Comedy Now!\n| rowspan=4|\n|-\n| Jessica Holmes\n| Comedy Now!\n|-\n| Shaun Majumder\n| Halifax Comedy Festival\n|-\n| Jonathan Torrens\n| Jonovision\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\"| 2002  17th Gemini Awards\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Bette MacDonald\n| Halifax Comedy Festival\n|\n|-\n| Jayne Eastwood\n| The Endless Grind\n| rowspan=3|\n|-\n| Peter Keleghan\n| Royal Canadian Air Farce\n|-\n| Nikki Payne\n| Halifax Comedy Festival\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\"| 2003  18th Gemini Awards\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Brian Hartt\n| Winnipeg Comedy Festival\n|\n|-\n| Omid Djalili\n| Just for Laughs\n| rowspan=4|\n|-\n| Leonie Forbes\n| Lord Have Mercy!\n|-\n| Linda Kash\n| Made in Canada\n|-\n| Nikki Payne\n| Comedy Now!\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\"| 2004  19th Gemini Awards\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Gavin Crawford\n| 'This Hour Has 22 Minutes: \"Episode 4\"'\n|\n|-\n| Gavin Crawford\n| The Gavin Crawford Show: \"Oh the Huge Manatee\"\n| rowspan=4|\n|-\n| Roman Danylo\n| Comedy Inc.\n|-\n| Shaun Majumder\n| Comedy from the Coast\n|-\n| Russell Peters\n| Comedy Now!\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\"| 2005  20th Gemini Awards\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Mary Walsh\n| Hatching, Matching and Dispatching\n|\n|-\n| Irwin Barker\n| Halifax Comedy Festival\n| rowspan=4|\n|-\n| Lewis Black\n| Just for Laughs\n|-\n| Colin Fox\n| Puppets Who Kill: \"Buttons the Dresser\"\n|-\n| Levi MacDougall\n| Comedy Now!\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" align=\"center\"| 2006  21st Gemini Awards\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Mark McKinney\n| 'Robson Arms: \"A Material Breach\"'\n|\n|-\n| Brigitte Bako\n| G-Spot: \"HBO\"\n| rowspan=5|\n|-\n| Danny Bhoy\n| Just for Laughs\n|-\n| Derek Edwards\n| Halifax Comedy Festival\n|-\n| Jeremy Hotz\n| Just for Laughs\n|-\n| Richard Waugh\n| ''Jimmy MacDonald's Canada: \"The Lost Episodes: The Canadian Sexplosion\"\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\"| 2007  22nd Gemini Awards\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Phyllis Ellis\n| 'The Wilkinsons: \"I Don't Want to Lose You to LA\"'\n|\n|-\n| John Cleese\n| Just for Laughs\n| rowspan=4|\n|-\n| Elvira Kurt\n| Halifax Comedy Festival: \"Episode 3\"\n|-\n| Rick Mercer\n| Rick Mercer Report: \"Episode 5\"\n|-\n| Teresa Pavlinek\n| The Jane Show: \"House of Jane\"\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\"| 2008  23rd Gemini Awards\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Jo Koy\n| Just for Laughs''\n|\n|-\n| Natalie Brown\n| Sophie: \"Door Number Two\"\n| rowspan=4|\n|-\n| Louis C.K.\n| Just for Laughs\n|-\n| Jon Dore\n| The Jon Dore Television Show: \"Jon Gets Scared\"\n|-\n| Ian Sirota\n| Comedy Inc.: \"Episode 4x03\"\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\"| 2009  24th Gemini Awards\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Debra DiGiovanni\n| Halifax Comedy Festival\n|\n|-\n| Benjamin Arthur\n| Less Than Kind: \"Pakikisama\"\n| rowspan=4|\n|-\n| Jon Dore\n| The Jon Dore Television Show: \"Jon Does Drugs\"\n|-\n| Terry McGurrin\n| Comedy Now!: \"Comedy Now! starring Terry McGurrin\"\n|-\n| Brooke Palsson\n| Less Than Kind: \"French Is My Kryptonite\"\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\"| 2010  25th Gemini Awards\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Benjamin Arthur\n| Less Than Kind: \"That's Somebody's Knish!\"\n|\n|-\n| Lisa Durupt\n| Less Than Kind: \"Road Trip\"\n| rowspan=4|\n|-\n| Wendel Meldrum\n| Less Than Kind: \"I Am Somewhere\"\n|-\n| Rick Mercer\n| Rick Mercer Report: \"Episode 1\"\n|-\n| Pete Zedlacher\n| Just for Laughs\n|}\nReferences"
