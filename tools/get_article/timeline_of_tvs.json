It provided the ITV service for the South and South East of England from 1982 to 1992.\n1980s\n1980\n* 28 December – The Independent Broadcasting Authority announces that Television South (TVS) has been awarded the franchise to broadcast to South and South East England. TVS will replace Southern Television at the start of programming on 1 January 1982.\n1981\n* August – TVS purchases Southern’s studios, but the incumbent continues to use them until their franchise runs out at the end of the year, forcing TVS to operate out of portakabins located in the car park.\n1982\n* 1 January –\n**TVS launches at 9:30&nbsp;am.\n** At 5:15 pm, TVS broadcasts the first main edition of their new regional news magazine Coast to Coast. At first, the programme airs between 5:30 and 6:30 pm, consisting of two sub-regional segments at 5:30 and 6:20 pm, ITN's News at 5:45 and a pan-regional segment at 6:00 pm.\n* Spring – The main evening edition of Coast to Coast is cut to a single 30-minute programme, beginning at 6:00 pm; the change also sees the launch of fully separate editions for the South and South East.\n* Autumn – TVS opens The Maidstone Studios.\n1983\n* 1 February – ITV’s breakfast television service TV-am launches. Consequently, TVS’s broadcast day always begins at 9:25 am.\n* Following the opening of their new studios at Maidstone, TVS closes the studios in Dover which they had used as a news-gathering base for the South East area which had previously been used by TVS's predecessor, Southern. The studios are demolished the following year.\n1984\n* 12 April – Whitbread acquires a 20% stake in TVS from European ferries, as the latter wishes to concentrate their financial and management resources on the shipping and property sectors.\n* 17 August – Greg Dyke, formerly of TV-am, is appointed as Director of Programmes at TVS.

Their education series are also deemed 'too didactic', while their religious output is branded as having 'barely discernible religious content'. Dyke accepts the IBA criticism, but highlights that TVS had already begun remedying the issues and faults, with a new editor for their Southampton news operation, and a new head of religious output being brought in, along with a Controller of Drama - a first for TVS. Once again, TVS express concern about their relationship with the \"Big Five\" ITV stations, and how they control the channel's output.\n* November – Whitbread sells their 20% stake in TVS.\n* TVS starts to branch out into other areas, by purchasing Midem, an organisation that promotes trade fairs; and Gilson International, a Los Angeles distribution company selling programmes outside the US.
