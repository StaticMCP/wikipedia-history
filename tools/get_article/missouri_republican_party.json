Its chair is former lieutenant governor Peter Kinder, who was elected in February 2025. It is currently the dominant party in the state, controlling most of Missouri's U.S. House seats, both U.S. Senate seats, both houses of the state legislature, and all statewide offices, including the governorship.\nHistory\nFrancis Preston Blair Jr. was the only Republican member of congress from a border state at the beginning of the American Civil War. However, he proposed that the state party instead merge with unionist Whigs and Democrats to form the Union Party.\nBlair and other Unionists in Missouri supported the removal of John C. Frémont's military command and the rescinding of his emancipation order. However, B. Gratz Brown, the former chair, supported Frémont. Blair and Brown disagreed on gradual compensated emancipation and slave colonization with Blair in support and Brown in opposition.\nThe Radical Republicans, including Brown, held a separate convention in 1864. They sent an uncommitted delegation to the 1864 National Union National Convention which was seated. Brown wanted to send a delegation to Frémont's Radical Democratic convention. This delegation was the only one to vote against Lincoln.\nThe Radical wrote the state constitution in 1865, which emancipated slaves while Blair returned to the Democratic Party.\nMembers of the party left to form the Liberal Republican Party. Brown, their gubernatorial nominee, won the 1870 election.\nAfter around 58% of Missouri voters approved November 2024 Proposition A to introduce a Missouri law to mandate that most employers are to provide sick leave to employees and also raise the minimum wage in line with inflation, Missouri's Republican lawmakers responded in May 2025 by repealing those portions of Proposition A, pending governor approval.\nCurrent Republican officeholders\nFile:Josh Hawley, official portrait, 116th congress.jpg|Senior U.S. Senator Josh Hawley\nFile:Sen.
