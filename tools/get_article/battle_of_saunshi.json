Hyder Ali attempted to try to regain his lost territories of Malabar and Coorg from the Marathas and was successful in doing so. Hyder Ali decided to attack the Marathas at Saunshi. Hyder Ali sent his trusted general Muhammad Ali to attack the Maratha garrison stationed at Saunshi. The result of the battle was a decisive victory for Mysore and Hyder Ali against the Maratha forces. Maratha Chief Konher Rao was killed in the battle and Pandurang Rao was captured and taken as a prisoner by the Mysore forces.\nReferences"
