To counter the deprivation they face in real life, his characters often seem to create a fantasy world around them, lending elements of magical realism to Farooki's signature style.\" \"Mostofa Sarwar Farooki could be the next South-east Asian filmmaker to break out\", The Hollywood Reporter wrote in the review of his film Television.

This group of young film makers used to be Farooki's assistant directors. They then used local cable television networks as a platform to master their hands in story telling and created an audience for the stories they tell. Their works have managed to connect primarily with the youth in urban and suburban parts of the Bangladeshi society for the realism in story topics and realism in execution.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
