Powers Warehouse and Factory is a historic industrial building in Portland, Oregon, United States. Built in 1925, it is one of the last remnants of two important phases in Portland's economic history: the city's once-prominent furniture manufacturing and distribution industry, and worker housing for the war industries of the World War II era.\nThe warehouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Northeast Portland, Oregon\nReferences"
