Members of the dynasty, the Abgarids, reigned between 134 BC and AD 242 over the city of Edessa and the Kingdom of Osroene in Upper Mesopotamia. Some members of the dynasty bore Iranian names, while others had Arabic names, including Abgar itself. J.B. Segal notes that the names ending in \"-u\" are \"undoubtedly Nabatean\". The Abgarid dynasts spoke \"a form of Aramaic\".\nFollowing the Battle of Carrhae (53 BC), members of the dynasty pursued a broadly pro-Parthian policy for about two centuries. At the turn of the 2nd century AD, the Romans turned Osroene into a Roman client state. During Caracalla's reign (198–217), most likely in 214, Abgar IX Severus was deposed and Osroene was incorporated as a Roman province (colonia). Thereafter, Abgarid dynasts only ruled in name. Abgar X Frahad, the last nominal Abgarid ruler, settled in Rome together with his wife.\nKings\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" | style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; width: 75%\"\n|+Kings of Edessa/Osroene\n!width=\"220px\"|King !! align=\"center\"  width=\"120px\"|Reign !! |Comments\n|-\n|Aryu||132–127 BC ||\n|-\n|Abdu, son of Maz'ur || 127–120 BC||\n|-\n|Fradasht, son of Gebar'u || 120–115 BC||\n|-\n|Bakru I, son of Fradasht|| 115–112 BC||\n|-\n|Bakru II, son of Bakru|| 112–94 BC|| Ruled alone\n|-\n|Bakru II and Ma'nu I||94 BC|| Ruled together\n|-\n|Bakru II and Abgar I Piqa|| 94–92 BC|| Ruled together\n|-\n|Abgar I|| 92–68 BC||Ruled alone\n|-\n|Abgar II, son of Abgar I || 68–53 BC||\n|-\n|Interregnum|| 53–52 BC ||\n|-\n|Ma'nu II || 52–34 BC||\n|-\n|Paqor|| 34–29 BC ||\n|-\n|Abgar III || 29–26 BC||\n|-\n|Abgar IV Sumaqa|| 26–23 BC ||\n|-\n|Ma'nu III Saflul|| 23–4 BC ||\n|-\n|Abgar V Ukkama, son of Ma'nu || 4 BC–7 AD|| 1st tenure\n|-\n|Ma'nu IV, son of Ma'nu|| 7–13 AD ||\n|-\n|Abgar V Ukkama || 13–50 AD|| 2nd tenure\n|-\n|Ma'nu V, son of Abgar|| 50–57 AD ||\n|-\n|Ma'nu VI, son of Abgar|| 57–71 AD ||\n|-\n|Abgar VI, son of Ma'nu || 71–91 AD||\n|-\n|Interregnum|| 91–109 AD ||\n|-\n|Abgar VII, son of Ezad || 109–116 AD||\n|-\n|Interregnum|| 116–118 AD ||\n|-\n|Yalur (Yalud) and Parthamaspates|| 118–122 AD || Ruled together\n|-\n|Parthamaspates|| 122–123 AD || Ruled alone\n|-\n|Ma'nu VII, son of Ezad || 123–139 AD||\n|-\n|Ma'nu VIII, son of Ma'nu|| 139–163 AD || First tenure\n|-\n|Wa'el, son of Sahru|| 163–165 AD || Installed by the Parthians\n|-\n|Ma'nu VIII, son of Ma'nu|| 165–177 AD|| Second tenure\n|-\n|Abgar VIII the Great, son of Ma'nu|| 177–212 AD ||\n|-\n|Abgar IX Severus, son of Abgar|| 212–214 AD || Deposed by the Romans; Osroene incorporated as a Roman province (colonia)\n|-\n|Ma'nu IX, son of Ma'nu|| 214–240 AD|| Ruled only in name\n|-\n|Abgar X Frahad, son of Ma'nu|| 240–242 AD||  Ruled only in name\n|}\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*"
