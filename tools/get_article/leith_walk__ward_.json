Established in 2007 along with the other wards, it currently elects four councillors. Its territory spans the area between Edinburgh city centre and the port of Leith to its north-east, centred around Leith Walk, the primary thoroughfare between them.\nNorthern parts of the ward fall within the historic burgh of Leith, but other neighbourhoods such as Broughton, Powderhall, Hillside and Canonmills (divided between Leith Walk and Inverleith wards) were always part of Edinburgh. Bonnington and Pilrig are on the boundary between the two burghs but entirely within Leith Walk ward, which in 2019 had a population of 34,651.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Louise A Lang(Liberal Democrats)\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Deidre Brock(SNP)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Maggie Chapman(Greens)\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Angela Blacklock(Labour)\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Nick Gardner(Labour)\n|-\n!2015\n|rowspan=3|Lewis Ritchie(SNP)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Marion Donaldson(Labour)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Susan Rae(Greens)\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Amy McNeese-Mechan(SNP)\n|-\n!2019\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Rob Munn(SNP)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Jack Caldwell(Liberal Democrats)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|James Dalgleish(Labour)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2019 by-election\nOn 28 January 2019, Labour councillor Marion Donaldson announced she was resigning from the council citing reports of internal party tensions.
