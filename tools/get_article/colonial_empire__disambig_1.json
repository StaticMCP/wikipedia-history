Such states can expand contiguous as well as overseas. Colonial empires may set up colonies as settler colonies.\nBefore the expansion of early modern European powers, other empires had conquered and colonized territories, such as the Roman Empire in Europe, North Africa and Western Asia. Modern colonial empires first emerged with a race of exploration\nbetween the then most advanced European maritime powers, Portugal and Spain, during the 15th century. The initial impulse behind these dispersed maritime empires and those that followed was trade, driven by the new ideas and the capitalism that grew out of the European Renaissance. Agreements were also made to divide the world up between them in 1479, 1493, and 1494. European imperialism was born out of competition between European Christians and Ottoman Muslims, the latter of which rose up quickly in the 14th century and forced the Spanish and Portuguese to seek new trade routes to India, and to a lesser extent, China.\nAlthough colonies existed in classical antiquity, especially amongst the Phoenicians and the ancient Greeks who settled many islands and coasts of the Mediterranean Sea, these colonies were politically independent from the city-states they originated from, and thus did not constitute a colonial empire.  This paradigm shifted by the time of the Ptolemaic Empire, the Seleucid Empire, and the Roman Empire.\nThe European countries of the modern era that are most remembered as colonial empires are the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Netherlands, France, Germany and Belgium.\nHistory\nEuropean colonial empires\nPortugal began establishing the first global trade network and one of the first colonial empires under the leadership of Henry the Navigator. The empire spread throughout a vast number of territories distributed across the globe (especially at one time in the 16th century) that are now parts of 60 different sovereign states. Portugal would eventually control Brazil, territories such as what is now Uruguay and some fishing ports in north, in the Americas; Angola, Mozambique, Portuguese Guinea, and São Tomé and Príncipe (among other territories and bases) in the North and the Subsaharan Africa; cities, forts or territories in all the Asian subcontinents, as Muscat, Ormus and Bahrain (amongst other bases) in the Persian Gulf; Goa, Bombay and Daman and Diu (amongst other coastal cities) in India; Portuguese Ceylon; Malacca, bases in Southeast Asia and Oceania, as Makassar, Solor, Banda, Ambon and others in the Moluccas, Portuguese Timor; and the granted entrepôt-base of Macau and the entrepôt-enclave of Dejima (Nagasaki) in East Asia, amongst other smaller or short-lived possessions.\nDuring its Siglo de Oro, the Spanish Empire had possession of Mexico, South America, the Philippines, all of southern Italy, a stretch of territories from the Duchy of Milan to the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium, parts of Burgundy, and many colonial settlements in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Possessions in Europe, Africa, the Atlantic Ocean, the Americas, the Pacific Ocean, and East Asia qualified the Spanish Empire as attaining a global presence. From 1580 to 1640 the Portuguese Empire and the Spanish Empire were conjoined in a personal union of its Habsburg monarchs during the period of the Iberian Union, but beneath the highest level of government, their separate administrations were maintained.\nSubsequent colonial empires included the English, Dutch and French empires. Throughout the 19th and early 20th century, by virtue of its technological and maritime supremacy, the British Empire steadily expanded to become by far the largest empire in history; at its height ruling over a quarter of the Earth's land area and 24% of the population. Britain's role as a global hegemon during this time ushered in a century of \"British Peace\", lasting from the end of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars to the start of World War&nbsp;I. During the New Imperialism, Belgium, Italy and Germany also built their colonial empires in Africa, while Japan started to encroach into former Chinese domains after they have settled their own reformation.\nTimeline\nThe chart below shows the span of some European colonial empires.\n* Black lines mark the year of the empires largest territorial extent of land area.\n* Red represents that the empire is at that time a monarchy.\n* Blue represents that the empire is at that time a republic.\nImageSize  = width:750 height:450\nPlotArea   = width:650  height:350 left:50 bottom:50\nDateFormat = yyyy\nPeriod     = from:1400 till:2000\nTimeAxis   = orientation:vertical\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:50 start:1400\n# there is no automatic collision detection,\n# so shift texts up or down manually to avoid overlap\nColors=\nid:red  value:red\nDefine $dx = 25 # shift text to right side of bar\nDefine $dy = -5 # adjust height\nPlotData=\nbar:Belgian color:red width:25 mark:(line,white) align:left fontsize:7\nfrom:1908  till:1962 shift:($dx,-2)    color:red\nat:1928 mark: (line,black)\nbar:British color:red width:25 mark:(line,white) align:left fontsize:7\nfrom:1707  till:1997 shift:($dx,-2)    color:red\nat:1920 mark: (line,black)\nbar:Danish color:red width:25 mark:(line,white) align:left fontsize:7\nfrom:1536  till:1953 shift:($dx,-2)    color:red\nat:1810 mark: (line,black)\nbar:Dutch color:red width:25 mark:(line,white) align:left fontsize:7\nfrom:1602  till:1806 shift:($dx,-2)    color:blue\nfrom:1806  till:1975 shift:($dx,-2)    color:red\nat:1806 mark: (line,red)\nat:1930 mark: (line,black)\nbar:English color:red width:25 mark:(line,white) align:left fontsize:7\nfrom:1585  till:1649 shift:($dx,-2)    color:red\nfrom:1649  till:1660 shift:($dx,-2)    color:blue\nfrom:1660  till:1707 shift:($dx,-2)    color:red\nat:1649 mark: (line,blue)\nat:1660 mark: (line,red)\nat:1707 mark: (line,black)\nbar:French color:red width:25 mark:(line,white) align:left fontsize:7\nfrom:1534  till:1792 shift:($dx,-2)    color:red\nfrom:1792  till:1814 shift:($dx,-2)    color:blue\nfrom:1814  till:1870 shift:($dx,-2)    color:red\nfrom:1870  till:1980 shift:($dx,-2)    color:blue\nat:1792 mark: (line,blue)\nat:1814 mark: (line,red)\nat:1870 mark: (line,blue)\nat:1920 mark: (line,black)\nbar:German color:red width:25 mark:(line,white) align:left fontsize:7\nfrom:1884  till:1918 shift:($dx,-2)    color:red\nat:1912 mark: (line,black)\nbar:Italian color:red width:25 mark:(line,white) align:left fontsize:7\nfrom:1885  till:1946 shift:($dx,-2)    color:red\nfrom:1946  till:1960 shift:($dx,-2)    color:blue\nat:1946 mark: (line,blue)\nat:1939 mark: (line,black)\nbar:Portuguese color:red width:25 mark:(line,white) align:left fontsize:7\nfrom:1415  till:1999 shift:($dx,-2)    color:red\nfrom:1910  till:1999 shift:($dx,-2)    color:blue\nat:1910 mark: (line,blue)\nat:1815 mark: (line,black)\nbar:Russian color:red width:25 mark:(line,white) align:left fontsize:7\nfrom:1721  till:1917 shift:($dx,-2)    color:red\nat:1895 mark: (line,black)\nbar:Spanish color:red width:25 mark:(line,white) align:left fontsize:7\nfrom:1492  till:1931 shift:($dx,-2)    color:red\nfrom:1931  till:1947 shift:($dx,-2)    color:blue\nfrom:1947  till:1975 shift:($dx,-2)    color:red\nat:1873 mark: (line,blue)\nat:1874 mark: (line,blue)\nat:1931 mark: (line,blue)\nat:1810 mark: (line,black)\nat:1947 mark: (line,blue)\nbar:Swedish color:red width:25 mark:(line,white) align:left fontsize:7\nfrom:1638  till:1663 shift:($dx,-2)    color:red\nfrom:1784  till:1878 shift:($dx,-2)    color:red\nat:1658 mark: (line,black)\nList of colonial empires\n:\n*  Belgian Empire (1908–1962)\n** Possessions in Africa\n*** (1908–1960)\n***  Ruanda-Urundi (1922–1962)\n** Possessions in Asia\n*** Belgian concession of Tianjin (1902–1931)\n*  British Empire (1707–1997/present)\n** Evolution of the British Empire;
