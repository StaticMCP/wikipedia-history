Most parties restrict membership to individuals who meet age and citizenship requirements, share the party’s core principles, and agree to abide by its constitution and rules. Members are typically prohibited from joining or supporting rival political organisations or from standing against officially endorsed candidates. In addition to full membership, some parties offer forms of associate or supporter status, which allow limited participation without the obligations of full membership.\nWhilst these rules help preserve party integrity and cohesion, they also define the extent to which individuals can engage with political life in the UK. Supporters without formal membership may contribute to campaigning or fundraising, but generally have fewer rights in internal decision-making or leadership elections.\nHistory\nMembership of political parties has been in decline in the UK since the 1950s, falling by over 65% from 1983 (4 per cent of the electorate) to 2005 (1.3 per cent). In 2022, 1.5% of the British electorate were members of the Conservative Party, Labour Party, or the Liberal Democrats. Typically party affiliation allows an individual to support only a single party. However, two notable exceptions to this are: the Co-operative Party which permits its members to also have membership of the Labour Party and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP); and the Scottish National Party, which permits membership of Plaid Cymru.\nAccording to the UK Parliament website sourced from a report by Olympic Britain, during the 1950s there were 2.8 million members of the Conservative Party and 1 million Labour Party members. In the years after 1945 until the early 1990s, supporters of the Socialist and Cooperative parties and trade unions linked with the Labour Party increased the overall Labour Party movement by 5 to 6 million, from which point they began to fall and currently number about 3.5 million.\nDespite being founded in 1900, the Labour Party did not begin keeping track of its membership until 1928. On the other hand, the Conservative Party rarely releases their total membership statistics; additionally, there are no clear membership statistics for the Conservative Party before 1945. It is estimated that between World War I and World War II, membership levels were around 1.5 million; however, exact numbers are unknown.\nCurrent membership\n{| class =\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Party\n!

The registered supporter class was abolished in 2021.\nConservative Party\nThe Conservative Party's membership was revealed as 131,680 at the end of the 2024 Conservative Party leadership election.\nLiberal Democrats\nLib Dem membership increased sharply after the confirmation on 18 April 2017 of the 8 June 2017 general election. Membership again increased sharply in the period before and after the two elections of May 2019, for the UK Councils and the European Parliament.\nScottish National Party\nThere was a huge surge in membership after the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, prior to which the SNP had just over 25,000 members. Membership peaked at over 125,000 in August 2018, before falling by tens of thousands in the final years of Nicola Sturgeon's leadership.\nReform UK\nMembership increased by over 50% from 31,000 to 45,000+ in the eight days after Nigel Farage announced he would be returning to lead the party.\nGreen Party of England and Wales\nOn 31 December 2015, the Green Party of England and Wales announced its membership as 63,219, its highest known membership up to that date. On 19 September 2025, it was revealed that the party had reached over 75,000 members. Less than a month later, on 9 October 2025, the party tweeted it had reached 95,000 members, a day after announcing it had surpassed 90,000. This \"surge\" has been accredited to their new leader, Zack Polanski, who was elected a month prior. On 12 October 2025, the party reached a record-breaking 100,000 members, marking an over 45% increase since Polanski was elected, and as of 27 October 2025, the Green Party has over 150,000 members.\nCo-operative Party\nThough the Co-operative Party stands joint candidates with the Labour Party, their membership bases are independent (members have the option of joining both parties).\nEnforcement\nThere are few high-profile cases of membership criteria enforcement and as such tend to happen under exceptional circumstances.\n2015 Labour leadership election\nDuring the 2015 Labour party leadership election it emerged that 260 former candidates from the Green Party, Left Unity and the Trade Union and Socialist Coalition had attempted to become registered supporters, but were subsequently blocked from voting. Shortly before this, it was revealed that Conservative MP and former junior minister Tim Loughton had been caught applying to become a registered Labour supporter, subsequently claiming that his intention was to \"blow the gaff on what a complete farce the whole thing is\". Veteran Labour MP Barry Sheerman also joined calls for the election to be \"paused\" over the fears of infiltration by other parties. The Labour Party told representatives of the four candidates at a meeting on 11 August that 1,200 members and supporters of other parties had been excluded and a further 800 were under investigation. Harriet Harman at the time admitted that as many as 100,000 people may be blocked from voting.\nThe number of those rejected eventually reached 56,000, around 9.1 per cent of the 610,753 considered eligible to vote at the start of the contest. According to the party, 45,000 of those were rejected for not being on the electoral register.\nLabour also confirmed that it would cancel supporters' votes after they had been cast, if it was found that they were members of other parties. A number of high-profile individuals have been blocked from voting, including Marcus Chown, Jeremy Hardy, Douglas Henshall, Ken Loach, Francesca Martinez, Mark Serwotka, Pete Sinclair, Mark Steel, Luke Wright and Toby Young.\nAndrew MacKinlay, a former Labour MP, further alleged that Labour was attempting to rig its own leadership election against Corbyn; a view shared by Jeremy Hardy. Such allegations became known to the media – and particularly Corbyn supporters – as the \"Labour Purge\", with #LabourPurge trending on Twitter. Claims of such a \"purge\" of Corbyn supporters were rejected by Harman who insisted that the exclusion processes were impartial to candidates. Scottish newspaper The National printed a page-long satirical cartoon speculating further vote-rigging by Labour's leadership.\nBrexit\nConservative peer Michael Heseltine had the whip removed in 2019 after expressing his intention to vote Liberal Democrat. Conservative policy appears to make such expulsions discretionary, despite threats from Conservative Campaign Headquarters.\nTony Blair's support for pro-remain parties led to questions about why he had not been expelled from the Labour Party. Alastair Campbell was expelled from the Labour Party after saying he voted for the Liberal Democrats in the 2019 European election. Many Labour members came out in support of Campbell using the hashtag #expelmetoo, reporting that they had similarly voted for the Liberal Democrats or other remain parties.\nCriteria for membership\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Party\n!Membership restrictions\n|-\n|Conservative Party\n|\"open to all who share its objects and values and who undertake to be bound by this Constitution\"\n\"Membership of the Conservative Party is not compatible with Membership of or association with any other registered political party\"\n|-\n|Labour Party\n|\"are not members of political parties or organisations ... declared ... ineligible for affiliation to the party.\"\n\"[Must not stand in] opposition to a Labour candidate\"\n\"[Must not support] a political organisation ... who stands against an official Labour candidate\"\n|-\n|Liberal Democrats\n|\"Open to all persons who agree with its fundamental values and objectives without discrimination as to age, ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender or sexual orientation.\"\n\"Membership may be revoked [due to] standing against the candidate of the Party\"\n\"Membership may be refused [due to] membership of another political party in Great Britain\"\n|-\n|Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)\n|\n|-\n|Scottish National Party (SNP)\n|\"I endorse the aims of the Party\"\n\"A member may not contest or be a member of any organisation [deemed to be a Political Party] contesting elections in opposition to the Party\"\n|-\n|Sinn Féin\n|\"only residents of Ireland are eligible for membership\"\n|-\n|Plaid Cymru\n|\"I endorse the aims of the Party and agree to abide by its constitution.
