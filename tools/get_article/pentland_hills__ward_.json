Established in 2007 along with the other wards, it mainly covers the villages and suburban developments in the south-west hinterland beyond the A720 Edinburgh city bypass road (Baberton, Balerno, Currie, Juniper Green and Ratho, plus the campus of Heriot-Watt University), up to the boundaries with West Lothian, Midlothian and a small border with the Scottish Borders at the edge of the Pentland Hills.\nInitially electing three councillors, within the bypass it covered the Kingsknowe neighbourhood and the southern part of the Wester Hailes housing scheme plus its smaller neighbour Clovenstone; the boundaries were redrawn for the 2017 election, losing Kingsknowe but gaining the northern part of Wester Hailes plus the Calders area, with the population increasing and four councillors being returned. In 2019, the ward had a population of 32,703.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Ronald Cairns(SNP)\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Alastair S Paisley(Conservative)\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Ricky Henderson(Labour)\n!colspan=2; rowspan=2|3 seats\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=1|Bill Henderson(SNP)\n|rowspan=1|Dominic Heslop(Conservative)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2|Neil Gardiner(SNP)\n|rowspan=2|Graeme Bruce(Conservative)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Sue Webber(Conservative)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1|Stephen Philip Jenkinson(Labour)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Fiona Glasgow(SNP)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2017 election\n2017 City of Edinburgh Council election\n2012 election\n2012 City of Edinburgh Council election\n2007 election\n2007 City of Edinburgh Council election\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/scotland/pentland-hills-ward-city-of-edinburgh#.YGRONlPTVkw Listed Buildings in Pentland Hills Ward, City of Edinburgh] at British Listed Buildings"
