Before television, King worked as a stand-up comedian. He was voted comedian of the year in 1997 by Metro magazine readers and nominated for the Billy T Award in the same year. After his television debut, King began to appear on more prominent New Zealand television comedy shows, notably Comedy Central, Game of Two Halves and Strassman. In 2002 he was nominated twice at the 2002 NZ Television Awards for his stand-up show An Audience With the King. He went on to host Mike King Tonight from 2003. The show aired for only one season.\nHe is well known for his work on mental health advocacy, which began in 2009 with his radio show, The Nutters Club. It was broadcast on New Zealand's Radio Live and then Newstalk ZB. He founded The Key to Life Charitable Trust, in 2012 which promotes suicide prevention and suicide awareness. King was named New Zealander of the Year in 2019 for his mental health advocacy work. He was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2019 and he returned the honour in 2021 as a protest over the lack of progress in the mental health system.\nHe is also known in New Zealand as a spokesperson for New Zealand pork, presenting 30-second TV commercials on cooking pork known as ''Mike's Meals until he disengaged from the pork industry.\nEarly life\nKing was born in April 1962 and raised in Whenuapai, New Zealand. He is one of five siblings. King attended Massey High School from 1974 until 1977, and then trained as a chef from 1978 to 1981 at the Auckland Technical Institute in Auckland, New Zealand. Mike King lives in Papatoetoe with his family.\nCareer\nInitially making his name as a stand-up comedian, playing heavily on his Māori origins, he made the move to a more lucrative mainstream audience, appearing on the New Zealand TV shows Comedy Central, Game of Two Halves, Strassman, TV Bloopers and Practical Jokes, Pulp Comedy and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. In 1997 he was nominated for the prestigious Billy T Award.\nIn 2003 King starred in his own talk show, Mike King Tonight, which was produced by Greenstone Pictures. The show ran for only one season.\nIn 2004 he hosted Mike King. Although similar in concept to Mike King Tonight, it was produced by Touchdown Television. It was shot on a smaller stage and no longer included the live band present on Mike King Tonight. It also ran for only one season.\nHealth\nIn 2006 he revealed that he suffered from depression, and took on the role of patron for the Phobic Trust. He provided further details in his 2008 autobiography.\nOn Jan 14, 2007, King collapsed in a Melbourne hotel and was left momentarily unconscious and partially paralyzed from a blood clot in a blood vessel which burst in the back of his neck, a very rare condition. He was attending a poker championship in Melbourne (a prize he claimed after winning a poker tournament in Auckland, New Zealand). It was not known whether he had a heart attack or stroke.\nHis life was saved by his good friend and poker player Richard Lancaster. Lancaster found him in a state of paralysis and sent him to Alfred Hospital.\nAddiction and mental health\nIn recent interviews, King has openly released information surrounding his several-year addiction to the drug cocaine. He claims to have purchased a travel agency to assure himself of access to the drug: \"If it ever came to it I could always jump on a plane and put myself up in a hotel for a few days\".\nIn 2009, King started a Radio Live programme airing on Sunday evenings entitled The Nutters Club. On the programme, King works with mental health professionals David Codyre and Malcolm Falconer, and invites listeners to phone in with comments and to share stories or issues which might be troubling them. In 2013, The Nutters Club'' moved to Newstalk ZB.\nIn 2012, King founded the Key to Life Charitable Trust. In 2019 King was named New Zealander of the Year. After this, he set up a social media campaign for mental health awareness as well as a Gumboot Friday which raised money to help youth to access counselling.\n]]\nIn the 2019 Queen's Birthday Honours, King was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit (ONZM), for services to mental health awareness and suicide prevention. In June 2021, he returned the medal to the government in protest of a lack of progress improving the mental health system, a move he had foreshadowed a month prior. His resignation was accepted by the Queen, who directed that King's appointment as an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit be cancelled and annulled.\nIn May 2024, Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters and Mental Health Minister Matt Doocey confirmed that the National-led coalition government would invest NZ$24 million in I Am Hope's Gumboot Friday programme providing counselling to young people.\nIn late October 2024, King attracted controversy after making remarks questioning the link between alcohol and suicide during an interview with Newstalk ZB radio station on 30 October. He said that \"alcohol is not a problem for people with mental health issues. It's actually the solution to our problem, until you come up with a better solution. I would suggest to you that alcohol has prevented more young people from taking their own lives\nthan it actually takes their own lives.\" King added that alcohol had helped with his mental health issues until he received counselling. King's remarks were criticised as \"really unhelpful\" and dangerous to people with mental health issues by the Mental Health Foundation while the Labour Party called upon the New Zealand Government to cut funding to his Gumboot Friday programme.\nMental Health Minister Doocey expressed disagreement with King's remarks while Green Party MP Tamatha Paul said that public figures needed to use their words wisely when talking about the impact of alcohol.\nBy contrast, ACT leader David Seymour minimised the impact of King's remarks, saying he was more worried about the \"speech police\" capitalising on King's remarks.\nPork marketing\nBeginning in 2008, King was the spokesman for New Zealand Pork, presenting 30-second TV commercials showcasing quick-fix meals using pork known as ''Mike's Meals. He dropped out of the campaign after SAFE'' contacted him about pig farming conditions in New Zealand.\nIn May 2009, he spoke out against the factory farming of pigs, and apologised for his previous promotional work. Appearing on the Sunday programme, he said \"I will not be a party to this brutality, this callous and evil treatment of pigs. It's disgusting and it needs to stop.\"\nDriving charge\nIn November 2012, King was ordered to complete 200 hours of community work after pleading guilty to a driving charge.\nFilmography\nTelevision\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Title\n!Notes\n|-\n|1996\n|Pukukata\n|\n|-\n|1997\n|Comedy Central\n|\n|-\n|1997–2001\n|Pulp Comedy\n|\n|-\n|1998\n|Newsflash\n|\n|-\n|1999–2005\n|Game of Two Halves\n|\n|-\n|2000\n|Project Timor\n|Television documentary\n|-\n|2000–2003\n|TV2 Big Comedy Gala\n|\n|-\n|2000–2002\n|Strassman\n|\n|-\n|2001\n|The Truth about Kiwi Men\n|Television documentary\n|-\n|2001\n|An Audience with the King\n|\n|-\n|2002\n|''Von Tempsky's Ghost\n|\n|-\n|2002\n|The Last Laugh\n|\n|-\n|2002\n|Blokes: The Kiwi Male Revealed\n|Television documentary\n|-\n|2003\n|Mike King Tonight\n|Host\n|-\n|2003\n|Mike King's Christmas Special\n|Host\n|-\n|2004\n|Mike King\n|Host\n|-\n|2009\n|Lost in Translation\n|Presenter\n|-\n|2010\n|A Night at the Classic\n|\n|-\n|2010–present\n|The Nutters Club\n|Television and Radio Broadcast\n|-\n|2012\n|Postcard from Afghanistan with Mike King\n|\n|-\n|2014\n|Through the Lens – The First 10 Years of Māori Television\n|\n|-\n|2014\n|Happy Hour\n|\n|-\n|2014\n|The Last Saint\n|Film\n|-\n|2018\n|The AM Show\n|\n|-\n|2019\n|Breakfast\n|\n|-\n|2020\n|The Project\n|\n|-\n|2021\n|Have You Been Paying Attention?[47]\n|Guest Quiz Master\n|-\n|2022\n|Celebrity Treasure Island\n|Intruder (Joined Later In The Game)\nLeft On Day 6\n|}\nBooks\n* The Nutters Club'' (2011)\nPersonal life\nKing has been married since 2015 to Joanna King (née Methven), and they have one daughter.\nAwards and recognitions\n*2019 Gladrap Boxing Awards Event of the year (Nominated)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://keytolife.org.nz/ The Key to Life Charitable Trust Official Website]"
