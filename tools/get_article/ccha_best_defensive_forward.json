      "text": "# CCHA Best Defensive Forward\n\nThe CCHA Best Defensive Forward is an annual award given out at the conclusion of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) regular season to the best defensive forward in the conference as voted by the coaches of each CCHA team.\nThe Best Defensive Forward was first awarded in 1990 and every year thereafter until 2013 when the original CCHA was dissolved as a consequence of the Big Ten Conference forming its men's ice hockey conference.\nThe CCHA was revived in 2020, with play resuming in the 2021–22 season, by seven schools that left the Western Collegiate Hockey Association, with an eighth school joining before play started. The revived league folded the Best Defensive Forward award into a new CCHA Forward of the Year award. The award was revived in 2024.\nJackson Jutting is the only player to win the award multiple times.\nAward winners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Year !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Winner !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Position !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| School\n|-\n| 1989–90 || Pete Stauber || Left wing || Lake Superior State\n|-\n| 1990–91 || Jeff Napierala || Right wing || Lake Superior State\n|-\n| 1991–92 || Pat Ferschweiler || Right wing || Western Michigan\n|-\n| 1992–93 || Chris Bergeron|| Center || Miami\n|-\n| 1993–94 || Mike Stone || Center || Michigan\n|-\n| 1994–95 || Wayne Strachan || Right wing || Lake Superior State\n|-\n| 1995–96 || Bates Battaglia || Left wing || Lake Superior State\n|-\n| 1996–97 || John Madden || Center || Michigan\n|-\n| 1997–98 || Terry Marchant || Center || Lake Superior State\n|-\n| 1998–99 || Mike York || Center || Michigan State\n|-\n| 1999–00 || Shawn Horcoff || Center || Michigan State\n|-\n| 2000–01 || John Nail || Right wing || Michigan State\n|-\n| 2001–02 || Bobby Andrews || Center || Alaska-Fairbanks\n|-\n| 2002–03 || Jed Ortmeyer|| Right wing || Michigan\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Year !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Winner !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Position !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| School\n|-\n| 2003–04 || Dwight Helminen || Center || Michigan\n|-\n| 2004–05 || Eric Nystrom || Left wing || Michigan\n|-\n| 2005–06 || Drew Miller || Left wing || Michigan State\n|-\n| 2006–07 || Nathan Davis || Center || Miami\n|-\n| 2007–08 || Justin Abdelkader || Center || Michigan State\n|-\n| 2008–09 || Tim Miller || Left wing || Michigan\n|-\n| 2009–10 || Tommy Wingels || Center || Miami\n|-\n| 2010–11 || Carl Hagelin || Left wing || Michigan\n|-\n| 2011–12 || Luke Glendening || Right wing || Michigan\n|-\n| 2012–13 || Dane Walters || Right wing || Western Michigan\n|-\n| rowspan=2| 2023–24 || Jackson Jutting || Forward || Bemidji State\n|-\n| Connor Milburn || Forward || Lake Superior State\n|-\n| 2024–25 || Jackson Jutting || Forward || Bemidji State\n|}\nWinners by school\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| School !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Winners\n|-\n|Michigan || 8\n|-\n|Lake Superior State || 6\n|-\n|Michigan State || 5\n|-\n|Miami || 3\n|-\n|Bemidji State || 2\n|-\n|Western Michigan || 2\n|-\n|Alaska || 1\n|}\nWinners by position\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Position !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Winners\n|-\n| Center || 11\n|-\n| Right wing || 7\n|-\n| Left wing || 6\n|-\n| Forward || 3\n|}\nSee also\n*CCHA Awards\nReferences\nGeneral\n*\n*\nSpecific\nExternal links\n*[http://www.collegehockeynews.com/reports/confinfo.php?c=2&d=history CCHA awards (incomplete)]"
