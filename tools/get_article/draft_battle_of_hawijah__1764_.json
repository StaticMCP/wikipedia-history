The battle resulted in a decisive tribal victory, forcing the Ottoman garrison to retreat and temporarily granting the Al-Obeid effective control over Hawija and its surrounding countryside.\nBackground\nThe Al-Obeid tribe, one of the largest Arab tribes in northern Iraq, resisted Ottoman taxation and conscription throughout the 18th century. In 1769, an Ottoman detachment was dispatched from Baghdad to Hawija in an attempt to collect taxes and suppress tribal dissent.\nBattle\nThe Ottomans advanced with a provincial force of infantry and cavalry. As the column approached Hawija, Al-Obeid fighters ambushed them in open terrain. Tribal cavalry overwhelmed the Ottoman troops, capturing supplies and weapons. The Ottomans suffered heavy losses and were forced into a disorganized retreat.\nAftermath\nFollowing the victory, the Al-Obeid controlled Hawija and the surrounding rural areas for several years, effectively limiting Ottoman authority in the region. The rebellion inspired other Sunni Arab tribes to resist Ottoman centralization.\nHowever, by the early 19th century, the Ottoman Empire reasserted its power through a series of punitive expeditions. Despite this, the memory of the Battle of Hawija remained a key part of Al-Obeid tribal identity.\nLegacy\nThe battle is remembered among the Al-Obeid as a symbol of tribal strength and independence. It demonstrated the ability of Iraqi tribes to temporarily defeat Ottoman military forces despite being outmatched in equipment and organization.\nSee Also\nAl-Obeid tribe\nAl-Obeid tribal rebellions\nOttoman Iraq\nShammar\nReferences\n1.
