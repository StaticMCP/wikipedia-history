When it was available the aircraft was supplied as a kit for amateur construction.\nThe S-51D is a 70% scale version of the World War II P-51D Mustang fighter aircraft.\nDesign and development\nDesigner Jim Stewart took a leave of absence from his employer, Pratt & Whitney, in 1989 to work on the S-51D's tooling and design. The prototype took flight on 30 March 1994 and by late June had completed its 40 hours of test flying.\nThe S-51D Mustang features a cantilever low-wing, a two-seats-in-tandem enclosed cockpit under a bubble canopy, retractable conventional landing gear, and a single engine in tractor configuration.\nThe aircraft is made from sheet aluminum. Its  span wing mounts flaps and has a wing area of . The cabin width is . The acceptable power range is . The specified propeller is a  diameter, constant speed four-bladed Hartzell Propeller unit, that is driven by a  spur gear with a (2.13:1) reduction ratio.\nThe S-51D Mustang has a typical empty weight of  and a gross weight of , giving a useful load of . With full fuel of  the payload for the pilot, passenger, and baggage is .\nThe standard day, sea level, no wind, take off with a  engine is  and the landing roll is .\nThe manufacturer estimated the construction time from the supplied standard kit as 2000&nbsp;hours. A fast-build kit was also available.\nOperational history\nBy 1998 the company reported that 72 kits had been sold and two aircraft were completed and flying.\nIn March 2014, 12 examples were registered in the United States with the Federal Aviation Administration, although a total of 19 had been registered at one time.\nSpecifications (S-51D Mustang)\n|more general=\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=liquid cooled\n|eng1 type=eight cylinder, four stroke engine\n|eng1 kw=\n|eng1 hp=400\n|prop blade number=4\n|prop name=Hartzell Propeller constant speed propeller\n|prop dia m=\n|prop dia ft=\n|prop dia in=91\n|prop note=\n|perfhide=\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=275\n|max speed kts=\n|max speed note=\n|cruise speed kmh=\n|cruise speed mph=260\n|cruise speed kts=\n|cruise speed note=\n|stall speed kmh=\n|stall speed mph=70\n|stall speed kts=\n|stall speed note=flaps and landing gear down\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|never exceed speed mph=\n|never exceed speed kts=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|range km=\n|range miles=700\n|range nmi=\n|range note=\n|endurance=\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling ft=24000\n|ceiling note=\n|g limits=+9/-4.5 (structural)\n|roll rate=\n|glide ratio=\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate ftmin=2780\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|lift to drag=\n|wing loading kg/m2=\n|wing loading lb/sqft=24.4\n|wing loading note=\n|power/mass=\n|thrust/weight=\n|more performance=\n|avionics=\n}}\nSee also\n*Cameron P-51G\n*Jurca Gnatsum\n*Loehle 5151 Mustang\n*Papa 51 Thunder Mustang\n*ScaleWings SW51 Mustang\n*W.A.R.
