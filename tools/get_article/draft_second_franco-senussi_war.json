It followed the First Franco-Senussi War and represented a continuation of Senussi resistance against European colonial expansion in North Africa.\nBackground\nAfter the Senussi had confronted Italian colonial forces in Libya and the British in Egypt, tensions escalated again with the French in the Sahara. The Senussi sought to maintain control over trans-Saharan routes and defend their religious and political influence, while the French aimed to secure their colonies in Chad, Niger, and southern Algeria.\nCourse of the war\nThe conflict erupted as the French expanded deeper into the Fezzan and the desert regions bordering their territories. The Senussi fighters, using guerrilla tactics, engaged in several clashes with French patrols and military outposts. Despite their resistance, the Senussi were eventually weakened by French superior weaponry, supply lines, and alliances with some local tribes.\nOutcome\nThe war ended with a French victory. It reduced Senussi influence in the Sahara and tightened French control over the region. However, the Senussi order continued to resist colonial powers in other areas, especially against the Italians in Libya.\nLegacy\nThe Second Franco-Senussi War is considered part of the larger struggle of the Senussi movement against European colonialism in North Africa. It also illustrates the interconnected nature of colonial conflicts involving France, Italy, and Britain in the region during the early 20th century.\nReferences\nHistory of European Colonialism in Africa."
