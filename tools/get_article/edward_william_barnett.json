He was then elected MP for the constituency in another by-election in 1873 before being defeated at the next election in 1874.\nThe short duration of his term from his election, which took place in an autumn recess, to the 1874 general election meant Barnett never took his seat in the House of Commons.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://genealogy.kolthammer.org/Bonnycastle-o/p3900.htm#c3900.4 Edward William Barnett]"
