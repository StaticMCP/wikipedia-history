By the time of the treaty of Marienburg, Swedish prospect in the war had diminished, and Charles X Gustav was willing to offer Frederick William I a reward for fighting on his side. While the latter was to remain a Swedish vassal for Prussia, he was promised hereditary sovereignty in four voivodeships of Greater Poland in return for participating in the Charles X Gustav's Polish campaigns. This alliance proved victorious in the subsequent Battle of Warsaw, but as further campaigns stalled, Frederick William I was to gain full sovereignty in Prussia by the Treaty of Labiau in November 1656.\nSources\nReferences\nBibliography\n*Erdmannsdörffer, Bernhard: Friedrich Wilhelm (Kurfürst von Brandenburg), in: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, published by Historische Kommission bei der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Band 7 (1878), pp. 480–497, [http://de.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=ADB:Friedrich_Wilhelm_(Kurf%C3%BCrst_von_Brandenburg)&oldid=975965 fulltext at de.wikisource]\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719045058/http://www.ieg-mainz.de/likecms/index.php?site=site.htm&dir=&nav=&siteid=133&treaty=313&page=1&lastsiteid=77&sq=&is_fts=1&filter_select=&filter_wt=&filter_id=&filter_l=&filter_p=&searchlang=de&searchstring=1656&date=&year_from=&year_till=&location= Scan of the treaty of Marienburg at ieg-mainz.de (Institut für Europäische Geschichte Mainz), 18 pages]"
