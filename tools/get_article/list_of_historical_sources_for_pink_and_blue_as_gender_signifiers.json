The current tradition in the United States (and an unknown number of other countries) is \"pink for girls, blue for boys\".\nPrior to 1940, two conflicting traditions coexisted in the U.S., the current tradition, and its opposite, i.e., \"blue for girls, pink for boys\". This was noted by Paoletti (1987, 1997, 2012).\nSince the 1980s, Paoletti's research has been misinterpreted and has evolved into an urban legend: that there was a full reversal in 1940, prior to which the only tradition observed was the opposite of the current one. Quoting the concluding lines of this study: \"In conclusion, there are strong reasons to doubt the validity of the standard PBR [pink-blue reversal] account; if anything, gender-color associations seem to be much more stable than currently believed\"\nKey to tables\nYear = year of publicationLocation = place to which text pertainsComments = brief quote from original text\nPink for girls, blue for boys\n19th century\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
