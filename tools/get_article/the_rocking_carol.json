It was translated from Czech (\"\") in 1928 and is performed as a lullaby to the baby Jesus.\nHistory\n]]\nThe carol was first published in an anthology in 1920 in Czechoslovakia, where it was described as a traditional Czech carol. It was loosely translated into English by Percy Dearmer, as part of his effort of resurrecting hymns that had fallen into disuse and introducing European hymns into the Church of England. The carol is sung in the form of a lullaby to Jesus while rocking the manger as if it were a more modern cradle, as noted by the repetitive chorus of \"We will rock you\". It was first published in The Oxford Book of Carols, which Dearmer had edited alongside Martin Shaw and Ralph Vaughan Williams, in 1928.\nAfter initial publication, the carol gradually decreased in popularity until the 1960s when the English actress Julie Andrews performed a commercially released version of it. Following this, it was published in Carols for Choirs by Reginald Jacques and David Willcocks.\nDescription\n\"The Rocking Carol\" consists of two verses of eight lines each. It is performed with a 10.7.8.8.7.7 metre. The hymn continues to be published within Church of England and Anglican hymnals. The hymn has been described as the quintessential lullaby carol and compared with similarly worded Christmas carols, \"Silent Night\" and \"Away in a Manger\"; hymnologists opine that the lyrics and melody both strongly suggest the rocking of a cradle.\nMelody and words\nThe original Czech lyrics are:\n1. Hajej, nynej, Ježíšku,\nJežíšku, pučíme ti kožíšku.\nBudeme té kolíbati,\nAbys moh' libě pospati,\nHajej, nynej, Ježíšku,\nPučíme ti kožíšku.\n2. Hajej, nynej, miláčku,\nMiláčku, mariánský synáčku.\nBudeme té kolíbati,\nAbys moh' libě pospati,\nHajej, nynej, miláčku,\nMariánský synáčku.\nThe English words are a poetic translation.\n:\n\\header { tagline = ##f }\n\\layout { indent = 0 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n\\context { \\Score \\remove \"Bar_number_engraver\" }\n\\context { \\Voice \\remove \"Dynamic_engraver\" }\n}\nglobal = { \\key f \\major \\time 2/4 \\autoBeamOff }\nsoprano = \\relative c' { \\global \\set Staff.midiPanPosition = -0.5 \\set midiInstrument = \"recorder\"\nf8\\mf a c c | d d16 ([b]) c4 | d8\\pp d16 ([b]) c4 |\nbes8\\mf bes16 ([g]) a8 a16 ([f]) | g8 g16 ([e]) f4 |\na8 c bes a | g a g c, |\na'\\pp c bes a | g a g c, |\nf8\\mf a c c | d d16 ([b]) c4 |\nbes!8\\pp bes16 ([g]) a8 \\tempo 4 = 36 a16 ([f]) | g8 g16 ([e]) f4 \\bar \"|.\"\n}\nalto = \\relative c' { \\global \\set Staff.midiPanPosition = 0.5 \\set midiInstrument = \"flute\"\nf8\\mf a f a | g g g4 | g8\\pp g g4 |\nf8\\mf d e c | d c c4 |\nf8 f f f | e d e c |\nf\\pp f f f | f f e c |\nf8\\mf a f a | g g g4 |\nf8\\pp d e c | d c c4 \\bar \"|.\"\n}\ntenor = \\relative c' { \\global \\set Staff.midiPanPosition = -1 \\set midiInstrument = \"oboe\"\na8\\mf c a c | b b16 ([d]) c4 | b!8\\pp b16 ([d]) c4 |\nd8\\mf bes c a | bes g a4 |\nc8 a bes c | c a c c |\nc\\pp a bes c | d d g, c |\na8\\mf c a c | b b16 ([d]) c4 |\nd8\\pp bes c e | bes g a4 \\bar \"|.\"\n}\nbass = \\relative c { \\global \\set Staff.midiPanPosition = 1 \\set midiInstrument = \"bassoon\"\nf8 f f f | f g e4 | f8 g e4 |\nd8 g c, f | bes, c f,4 |\nf'8 f d f | c f c c |\nes f d c | b b c c |\nf8 f f f | f g e4 |\nd8 g c, f | bes, c f,4 \\bar \"|.\"\n}\nverseOne = \\lyricmode { \\set stanza = \"1.\"\nLit -- tle Je -- sus, sweet -- ly sleep, do not stir;\nwe will lend a coat of fur.\nWe will rock you, rock you, rock you,\nwe will rock you, rock you, rock you.\nSee the fur to keep you warm,\nsnug -- ly round your ti -- ny form. }\nverseTwo = \\lyricmode { \\set stanza = \"2.\"\nMa -- ry's lit -- tle ba -- by, sleep, sweet -- ly sleep,\nSleep in com -- fort, slum -- ber deep.\n\\repeat unfold 16 { \\skip 1 }\nWe will serve you all we can,\ndar -- ling, dar -- ling lit -- tle man.\n}\n\\score {\n\\new ChoirStaff >\n\\new Lyrics \\lyricsto \"soprano\" \\verseOne\n\\new Lyrics \\lyricsto \"soprano\" \\verseTwo\n\\new Staff\n>\n>>\n\\layout { }\n}\n\\score { >\n\\midi {\n\\tempo 4=42\n\\context { \\Score midiChannelMapping = #'instrument }\n\\context { \\Staff \\remove \"Staff_performer\" }\n\\context { \\Voice \\consists \"Staff_performer\" }\n}\n}\n:Source\nCriticism\nAfter publication, the final line of the carol met with dissatisfaction, with a number of hymnal editors altering it from \"Darling, darling little man\" to \"Son of God and Son of Man\". Barry Cooper has argued that it has only minor biblical references and is written without theological content and \"painting a wholly imaginary scene\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n* , Choir of New College Oxford"
