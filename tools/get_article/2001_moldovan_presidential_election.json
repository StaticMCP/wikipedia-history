The Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova (PCRM) won 50.07% of the vote and 71 of the 101 seats in the February 2001 parliamentary election; by this time the constitution had been changed to provide for election of the President through the Parliament rather than popular vote. In March, the PCRM's Central Committee nominated Vladimir Voronin as its presidential candidate at a plenum, and on April 4, 2001 Voronin was elected as president by the Parliament. Of the 89 deputies participating in the vote, 71 voted for Voronin, 15 voted for Dumitru Braghiş, and three voted for Valerian Cristea. He was sworn in at a ceremony in Chişinău on April 7, 2001. The Constitutional Court ruled that the President could also lead a political party, and Voronin was re-elected as the PCRM's leader.\nResults\nReferences"
