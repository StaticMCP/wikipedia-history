Renowned for its distinct flavor and creamy texture, it is often considered a top-tier durian variety.\nThe Sultan King durian originated in Bukit Merah, a town located on the border between Penang and Perak states in Malaysia. It was officially registered with the Department of Agriculture in 1934 under the cultivar code \"D24\".\nHistory\nThe Sultan King durian was originally known as a luxury fruit because it was only available for a short season and was traditionally reserved for Malaysian sultans. The durian's name comes from its royal association with the Malaysian state rulers.\nCharacteristics\nFlavor and texture\nD24 durians are known for their sweet and slightly bitter taste, offering a complex flavor profile that balances sweetness with a subtle tang. Some describe hints of caramel or buttery taste, adding to its luxurious flavor. The flesh has a soft and creamy texture that ranges from sticky to moist.\nAppearance\nIt is typically small to medium-sized, weighing between 1.5 and 2 kilograms. The fruit often has an ellipsoidal or even heart-shaped form with a short stem and is covered in sharp, pointed spikes. It can sometimes display bulbous, curved bumps on one side, giving it an uneven appearance. The husk color ranges from green to brown to yellow.\nCultivation\nSultan King durians thrive in tropical climates with high humidity and ample rainfall. They require well-drained soil and plenty of sunlight. The trees are typically propagated through grafting to ensure consistent fruit quality.\nThey prefer temperatures ranging from 24&nbsp;°C to 30&nbsp;°C (75&nbsp;°F to 86&nbsp;°F) and are highly sensitive to cold. An annual rainfall of 1,500 to 3,000&nbsp;mm is ideal, but a dry period of 1 to 2 months before flowering is necessary for optimal fruit production. Protection from strong winds is also beneficial due to their large canopy.\nCulinary uses\nSultan King durians are primarily consumed fresh. They are often enjoyed on their own or used in various desserts, such as durian ice cream, durian cakes, durian mooncakes and durian pastries. In some regions, durian is also used in savory dishes, such as durian curry.\nReferences"
