A distinguishing feature of the flag is its six fringes, which were added to represent the original six sestiere of Venice. The fringes also serve to prevent damage being caused to the central section of the flag by wind.\nDuring times of peace, the Lion of Saint Mark was depicted alongside an open book. However, when the Republic was at war the Bible was replaced with the lion grasping an upright sword. During the corteo dogale (), four banners of Saint Mark with different background colours, white, purple, blue, and red, were carried, with the one in front representing the state of the republic at that time (at peace, in a truce, in an alliance, at war, respectively). When at war, the war version of the Lion of Saint Mark was used.\nThe flag inspired the modern flag of the Veneto region in Italy.\nHistory\nIt is unclear as to when the republic officially adopted the flag. One chronicler, John the Deacon, described how in 998 Doge Pietro Orseolo II was presented with a \"triumphale vexillum\" (triumphal banner) before leading a naval expedition against the Narentines, pirates who moored off the eastern coast of the Adriatic and harassed Venetian seamen. However, this chronicle does not explicitly mention the use of the Lion of Saint Mark within the flag or mention the colours used upon the banner.\nThe first recorded use of the Lion of Saint Mark on a red field by the Venetians dates back to the late thirteenth century. Genoese archivist Jacobus de Voragine makes reference to the Lion of Saint Mark as the official symbol for Venice. He also mentions how the phrase \"PAX TIBI MARCE EVANGELISTA MEUS\" was found on the flag.\nThe winged lion was chosen as a symbol of Venice due to its connotations with Saint Mark. Venetian tradition states how Saint Mark was travelling from Aquileia to Rome when an Angel appeared whilst he was in the lagoon of Venice and stated '''Pax tibi, Marce, evangelista meus. Hic requiescet corpus tuum'  (Peace be with thee, O Mark, my evangelist. Here thy body will rest). The legend was used in 828 by Venetian merchants Rustico da Torcello and Bon da Malamocco to justify their journey to Alexandria to take the corpse of Saint Mark to Venice and inter it within the city. From that moment Saint Mark became the patron saint of Venice and thus began the association between the city and the winged lion.\nVexillologist Whitney Smith suggests that the colours chosen, red and gold, were selected on the basis that they were the colours of the Byzantine Empire, the previous rulers of the region.\nFor 337 years 12 Gonfalonieri, mercenaries from Perast (modern day Montenegro), were appointed by the Venetian senate to guard the flag of the Republic at all times on the pain of death. 8 were executed in 1571 after the Battle of Lepanto for failing to protect it.\nFollowing the fall of the Republic of Venice in May 1797 by France and Austria, the Lion of Saint Mark was suppressed throughout Venice. As a result, the traditional flag of the Republic of Venice was abolished and replaced with two equal horizontal bands of blue on top of yellow.\nThe last place where the flag was used as a symbol of the Republic was Perast, in Venetian Albania, a town faithful to Venice. Perast continued to celebrate its loyalty to Venice for several months by continuing to fly the flag. On 23 August 1797, the Austrian navy arrived in the town and the Banner of St. Mark was hauled down for the last time. Captain Joko Viskovich made a speech in the local language, stating \"The history of this day will be known throughout all Europe, how Perast has maintained, with dignity, to the very end, the honour of the Venetian flag, honouring it with this solemn act, lowering it to the ground, bathed in our universal and bitter tears'''.\nUsage of the Lion of Saint Mark in the flag of Venice would not return until 1848, when it appeared in the canton of the flag of the Republic of San Marco.\nModern usage\nThe flag enjoys continued usage throughout the city of Venice. It can be found flying from the balconies of homes, hotels, and government offices. Some residents of the city also elect to fly the flag as an ensign from the stern of private boats, whilst some gondoliers choose to attach the flag to their gondola. On some occasions, the flag of the Republic of Venice flies atop a flagpole outside St. Mark's Basilica in Piazza San Marco.\nEven if it is not the flag of the Veneto region, it is preferred by people and institutions across the entire region because of its symbolic meaning of the unity of Venetian people and the historic heritage of the Republic of Venice. The flag can be seen in many other cities as Verona and Treviso, but it is used in some towns from Friuli too, once under the rule of Venice. The Venetian people tend to recognize themselves in this flag, which has become the true symbol of their unity.\nUsage of the flag has also been adopted as a symbol by some claiming to represent the Venetian regionalist movement.\nThe flag of the Republic of Venice appears alongside the flag of Genoa, the Cross of Pisa, and the flag of the Republic of Amalfi on the ensign of the Italian navy.\nGallery\nHistorical flags of the municipality\nFile:Flag of Venice (1879).svg|alt=(1879–1942)[14]|1879–1942\nFile:Flag of Venice (1942).svg|alt=(1942–1945 de facto; 1997 de jure)[15]|1942–1947 de facto; 1997 de jure\nFile:Flag of Venice (1922).svg|alt=(1922 de facto – 1997 de facto)[16]|1922 de facto – 1997 de facto\nFile:Flag of Venice.svg|alt=(1997–present)[17]|1997–present\nHistorical flags of the republic\nState flags\nFile:Variant flag of the Serene Republic of Venice.svg|alt=Flag of the Republic of Venice, showing the Lion of Saint Mark holding a Bible, associated with peace.[18]|Flag of the Republic of Venice, showing the Lion of Saint Mark holding a Bible, associated with peace.\nFile:Variant war flag of the Serene Republic of Venice.svg|alt=Flag of the Republic of Venice, showing the Lion of Saint Mark holding a sword, associated with war.[19]|Flag of the Republic of Venice, showing the Lion of Saint Mark holding a sword, associated with war.\nFile:Standard of the Republic of Venice (1648).svg|Heraldic Standard of 1648\nFile:Flag of Republic of Venice (1659-1675).svg|alt=Official flag of the Republic of Venice used by the Doge Domenico Contarini (1659-1675)[21][22][23][24]|Official flag of the Republic of Venice used by the Doge Domenico Contarini (1659-1675)\nFile:Flag of the Republic of Saint Mark.svg|alt=Flag of the Republic of San Marco (1848-1849)[25]|Flag of the Republic of San Marco (1848-1849)\nNaval and land fortifications flags\nFile:Naval and land fortifications flag of the Republic of Venice (XII-XIII century).svg|alt=|12th-13th century\nFile:Naval and land fortifications flag of the Republic of Venice (XIV century).svg|alt=|14th century.\nFile:Naval and land fortifications flag of the Republic of Venice (XIV century-1797).svg|alt=|14th century-1797\nFile:Naval and land fortifications flag of the Republic of Venice (XVIII century-1797 variant).svg|alt=|Variant in use during the last years of the republic\nFile:Naval and land fortifications flag of the Republic of Venice (XVIII century-1797 land variant).svg|Variant in use during the last years of the republic flown on land fortifications\nAdditional images\nFile:Venice flag.jpg|A modern-day replica of the flag flown from a balcony in Venice\nFile:Venezia-DSCF9899.JPG\nFile:Flag of Veneto.svg|Flag of the Italian administrative region of Veneto (adopted in 1975)\nFile:Giovanni Antonio Canal, il Canaletto - The Bucintoro Returning to the Molo on Ascension Day - WGA03887.jpg|Canaletto (1730) - The venetian flag on the Bucintoro\nReferences\nNotes\nFurther reading\n* , 378 pp.\n* , 66 p."
