Associated organisations have been established to study and monitor trends and statistics as well as provide support and guidance to adolescents.\nSexual activity and contraception use\nThe Family Planning Association, was established in the 1930's. In 1952, the charity began to offer contraceptive advice to single women who were just about to wed.\nA study in Manchester revealed that, between the years 1937 and 1954, almost a quarter of underage girls came to the attention of one female police officer, regarding pregnancy. It was also noted that the girls often came from backgrounds of broken homes or bad parental influence. It was found that they also tended to have a lower than average IQ.\nThe combined oral contraceptive pill became available in 1961, but initially only to married women. The proportion of teenage girls who were married rose from 5% in 1951 to 8% in 1961. In the same year, a study on Scottish women found that almost a quarter of single women were sexually experienced before their 20th birthday. The proportion of sexually experienced single women had risen by 6% during the late 1940s, and it rose again by 15% during the late 1950s. The findings of the study concluded that there was an increase in sexual intercourse among young single women after the advent of the contraceptive pill in 1961.\nIn 1964, the United Kingdom had its first comprehensive survey on sexual behaviour amongst unmarried teenagers. The survey revealed that by the age of 18, a third of boys and approximately one in six girls were sexually experienced. The survey also highlighted that for girls under the age of 16, one in twenty were sexually active. Approximately one in three teenage girls, who engaged in premarital sexual intercourse, fell pregnant. In the survey, amongst sexually experienced individuals, one-fifth of girls and two-fifths of boys always used birth control. Condoms served as the most common form of birth control (selected by around 80% of those using birth control).\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em;\"\n|-style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=100px\n|+Percent of adolescents who have had sex before the age of 16\n|-\n!style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=100px| Year\n!style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=100px| Boys\n!style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=100px| Girls\n|-\n!style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=100px| 1964\n!style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=100px| 14%\n!style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=100px| 5%\n|-\n!style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=100px| 1974\n!style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=100px| 31%\n!style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=100px| 12%\n|-\n!style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=100px| 1991\n!style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=100px| 28%\n!style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=100px| 19%\n|-\n!style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=100px| 2001\n!style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=100px| 30%\n!style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=100px| 26%\n|-\n!style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=100px| 2008\n!style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=100px| 34%\n!style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=100px| 38%\n|-\n!style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=100px| 2012\n!style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=100px| 30.9%\n!style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=100px| 29.2%\n|}\nIn 1964, Helen Brook set up the Brook Advisory Centres, offering contraceptive advice to single people under the age of 25. In 1967, a change in the law allowed local health authorities to offer contraceptive services to unmarried individuals. By 1968, only one in six authorities were providing such a service. Mr. K. Robinson, answered a question in the House of Commons regarding the new Family Planning Act in October 1967, in which he stated that it would be unwise to exclude girls under 16 from receiving advice at family planning clinics (FPC); though, these girls would only be seen at FPCs in exceptional circumstances even with parental consent.\nBy 1969, Brook Advisory Centres were offering contraceptive advice to over ten thousand unmarried people under 25—the majority aged between 19 and 21, with around one in six being under 19. In 1970, The Family Planning Association were mandated to offer contraception to unmarried people. In 1971, a survey on Scottish single female students revealed that one third of these students had had sexual intercourse by the age of 18. Over half had not using any form of contraception. The survey also showed that one in seven girls, who had recently been sexually active, had a partner who was a casual boyfriend.\nIn 1971, a doctor was reported for informing the parents of a 16-year-old girl that she had come to him seeking contraception. This prompted the British Medical Association to advise doctors to maintain young patients' confidentiality when seeking contraception. Three-quarters of teenagers visiting Brook Advisory Centres during the early 1970s were doing so without their parents' knowledge.\nControversy was also sparked when a 12-year-old girl, who had recently undergone an abortion, was put on the contraceptive pill with her parents' consent by gynecologist Dr Mary Wilson at Calthorpe nursing home in Birmingham. She said \"so many girls come back pregnant again after three or four months, that is why I gave her a supply of the pill and contraceptive advice\". Labour MP Leo Abse was concerned that the prescribing of the pill to a 12-year-old child was an offence under the sexual offences act.\nIn 1975, under the new National Health Service reorganisation act, contraception was made available free of charge to everyone, including single people and those aged under 16. Clarification was given to doctors that they could provide contraception to patients under 16 without parental consent in certain circumstances. The average age of first sexual intercourse for girls had now dropped from 21 in the mid-1950s to 18. Over a quarter of boys under 16 and almost one in eight girls under 16 were sexually experienced.\nIn 1976, a report by the British Pregnancy Advisory Service found that 69 percent of girls under the age of 16, who had came to them for an abortion during the year, had used no contraception. Most of them were experienced at sex. By 1978, Brook Advisory Centres were government funded and 3% of Brook's clients were under the age of 16.\nIn 1980, the 1974 DHSS circular about parental consent and the issuing of contraception/abortion advice to girls under 16 was reviewed. The conclusion was that a doctor or a professional worker should always seek to persuade the child to involve her parents or guardian at the earliest stage of consultation; but it was accepted that occasionally contraception would be given without parental consent.\nThe number of girls under 16 visiting family planning clinics in England reached over seventeen thousand in 1983, but cuts in health service expenditure forced the closure of many family planning clinics and a restriction in the services available to young people that year.\nIn 1984, a high court ruling in favour of Victoria Gillick, it was deemed illegal for health professionals to advise or give girls under 16 contraceptives without parental consent except in exceptional circumstances; the number of girls under 16 visiting family planning clinics each year dropped to twelve thousand in response. When the House of Lords overturned the high court ruling in 1985 and confidential contraceptive advice to young people was restored, the number rose again to sixteen thousand per year.\nIn the first sex survey of its kind, the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (NATSAL) in 1991 revealed that one in six girls under 16 and a quarter of boys under 16 were sexually experienced. A fifth of sexually active 16- and 17-year-olds and over half of 18- and 19-year-olds were using at least one method of contraception. The second NATSAL in 2001 showed that the average age of first intercourse had dropped from 17 in the 1980s to 16. It also revealed that a quarter of girls and nearly a third of boys were sexually experienced before the age of 16.\nA survey conducted in 2005 found that the number of girls under 16 visiting family planning clinics had risen throughout the 1990s to peak at over ninety-one thousand in 2003, before falling to eighty-three thousand. The most popular choice was the condom with over half choosing this method of contraceptive.\nSexually transmitted infections\nThe proportion of patients visiting sexual health clinics for treatment of venereal disease, particularly the sexually transmitted infection gonorrhoea, has shown a general increase over the years.\nFor women, the figures from a study in Manchester showed teenagers accounted for 10% of patients in 1939, up to 23% in 1954. Later studies show figures of 23% in 1957, 27% in 1963, and 33% in 1981. The rate of new cases of gonorrhoea diagnosed at sexual health clinics amongst girls under 16 in England increased more than threefold from 2.76 per hundred thousand of the population in 1966 to 9.38 in 1976.\nIn men, the proportion of patients at sexual health clinics who were under the age of 20 rose from 3.8% in 1939 to 4.8% in 1954. Amongst boys under 16 the rate of gonorrhoea diagnoses rose from 0.94 per hundred thousand of the population in 1966 to 2.19 in 1976.\nIn 1971 the number of teenagers visiting sexual health clinics with gonorrhoea reached over ten thousand, 60% were girls and one in twenty were under 16. The number of persons under 16 being diagnosed with gonorrhoea in England fell from 637 in 1976 to 361 in 1981, but the levels rose again and in 1996 there were over ten thousand new cases of gonorrhoea to teenagers reported in sexual health clinics, up over 30% from 1995. In a study in 2005 this number had fallen to 3,700.\nLevels of chlamydia in teenagers rose throughout the 1980s and 1990s; in 1996 the levels increased by over 16% from the previous year, and by 2005 it was the most common sexually transmitted infection amongst teenagers with over thirty thousand new cases reported, almost 28% of all new cases. In 2006 a screening programme of young people by the Department of Health revealed that 12% of girls aged 16–19 and 13% of men aged 20–24 were infected with chlamydia.\nSee also\n* Adolescent sexuality\n* Age-of-consent reform in the United Kingdom\n* Ages of consent in Europe\n* Teenage pregnancy in the United Kingdom\nReferences"
