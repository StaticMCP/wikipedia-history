He obtained a master's degree in 1866, and subsequently became a tutor at Magdalen College in 1868. He was appointed a public examiner in the Honours School of Science. He was elected a fellow of Magdalen College in 1882. He was curator of the University Botanic Gardens, and a member of the Linnean and Ashmolean Societies. He married Elizabeth Beardoe Grundy in 1863.\nIn 1877, his father died and he inherited shares in the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, and became a director and deputy chairman of its successor Great Central Railway. He was also a director of the South Eastern and London Chatham and Dover Railway companies, Liverpool, St Helens & South Lancashire Railways and was chairman of Wigan Junction Railways and Oldham, Ashton-under-Lyne and Guide Bridge Junction Railways.
