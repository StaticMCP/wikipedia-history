1,807 (51%) were females. Population below 6 years was 460. The total number of literates in Dwariapur was 2,302 (74.00% of the population over 6 years).\nDhokra craft\nThere is a group of families involved in making dhokra craft at Dwariapur. They originally belonged to the former princely Bastar state in Central India, now Bastar district in Chhattisgarh. They migrated to what is now Dhenkanal district in Odisha and then on to Medinipur, Bankura, Purulia and Bardhaman - they were scattered all around. In Purba Bardhaman district, they settled in Dwariapur. They make metal castings by a process that is believed to have been practised from ancient times and they learnt the traditional intricacies from their fore-fathers.\nAround 1952, there were 15/ 16 families at Dwariapur involved in this metal craft. They made small metallic measuring bowls, small deities and decorative items and sold them to villagers. They were extremely poor and mostly illiterate. The artistry of their craft was appreciated and attracted attention. Subsequently, Government agencies stepped in. A few of them were taken to Kolkata for training in design centres in order to enlighten them about updating their practices. They were provided with loans and steps were taken to market their products.\nProvash Sen, a former director of the Regional Design Centre at Kolkata of the All India Handicrafts Board, contributed substantially to the appreciation and improvement in the status of the dhokra craftsmen. In 1966, Sambhunath Karmakar received a national award from Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, President of India, for his creation “Rath”.   In 1971, Baikuntha Karmakar received a national award from V.V. Giri, President of India, for his creation “horse”. In 1986, Haradhan Karmakar received a national award from Gyani Zail Singh, President of India, for his creation “Laksmisaj”. In 1987, Matar Karmakar, then working at the Kolkata Design Centre, received the President’s Award and a cash reward of Rs. 10,000 from R. Venkataraman, President of India. In 1990, Haradhan Karmakar and Mahamaya Karmakar were sent to Small Scale Industries Centre at London for an exhibition of dhokra craft.\nIn a report by the Micro, Small and Medium Industries Development Institute, it says that the degree of excellence of products like, sola craft of Bankapasi and dhokra of Dwariapur is now acceptable to European markets.\nAn organization named NISTADS got involved in developing a new furnace for Dhokra artisans. The clash of modernity and traditions had its own problems. However, the modern furnace has found acceptance at both Dwaraipur and Bikna, some two hours by road, in Bankura district, another place where around 36 families are involved in the dhokra craft.\nTransport\nState Highway 14, running from Dubrajpur (in Birbhum district) to Betai (in Nadia district), passes through Dwariapur.\nReferences\nExternal links"
