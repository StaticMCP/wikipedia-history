For example, Jamie Dornan (Fifty Shades Freed) and Kevin Spacey (Billionaire Boys Club) received enough votes for Worst Actor, but neither were included on the final nominee list.\nThe ballot itself was also heavily criticized for overlooking critically panned films and the nomination and win of non-acting performances for documentary stock footage.\nDespite mix-to-poor reviews, the awards was criticized for nominating The Meg in the Worst Remake, Rip-off or Sequel as a rip-off of Steven Spielberg's 1975 film Jaws despite having nothing to do with the film besides having a shark as an antagonist.\nSee also\n* 91st Academy Awards\n* 76th Golden Globe Awards\n* 72nd British Academy Film Awards\n* 34th Independent Spirit Awards\n* 25th Screen Actors Guild Awards\n* 24th Critics' Choice Awards\n* 45th Saturn Awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
