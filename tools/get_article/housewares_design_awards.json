The competition was introduced in 2003 by HomeWorld Business, a housewares industry trade publication.\nThe Housewares Design Awards attracts hundreds of product entries each year. These entries are evaluated by an independent panel of judges made up of designers and retailer buyers, a process managed by the Housewares Design Awards LLC.\nContest criteria include unique appearance, functionality, positioning, innovative technology or materials, safety, environmental benefits, emotional appeal, social impact and the ability to meet consumer needs.\nTwelve \"Best in Category\" Awards and three \"Best of the Best\" awards are presented at the gold, silver and bronze levels. The \"Green House Design Awards,\" which honor eco-friendly housewares products, are also given each year.\nCategories\n* Cookware & Bakeware\n* Countertop Cooking & Beverage Appliances\n* Countertop Food Prep Appliances\n* Countertop Kitchenware\n* Cutlery\n* Floor Care & Cleaning Appliances\n* Gadgets & Kitchen Tools\n* Home Environment Appliances\n* Home Organization, Laundry Care & Non-Electric Cleaning\n* Home & Outdoor Décor\n* Personal, Health & Garment Care\n* Tableware, Serveware & Beverageware\nReferences\n* Enna, Renee.
