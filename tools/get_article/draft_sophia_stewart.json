As their ideas were coined from her book known as The Third Eye. Before Terminator, James Cameron was a horror movie director and needed a big break. He Had just directed Piranha II which was a mega failure in the box office back then and when Susan Merzback, Vice President of Creative Affairs at 20th Century Fox at the time told the story to James Cameron, he had to jump on it. This wasn't Cameron's first rodeo as he was also sued by the creator of Outer Limits for copyright infringement also. These franchises combined are worth over 10 billion dollars and Sophia hadn't received a single cent, that is until 2014 when on September 25th of 2014 the Federal Court of Utah awarded her $305,235.62 in attorney fees as the lawyer failed to represent, but did not win the $2.5 billion ‘Matrix’ lawsuit. To this day she still has not received justice for the malpractice done against her.\nReferences\n__NOEDITSECTION__"
