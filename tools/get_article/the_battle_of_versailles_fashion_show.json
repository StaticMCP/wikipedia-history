Each designer was to submit eight designs for consideration. The Parisian designers viewed their competition as mere sportswear designers. The American designers used ten black models, an unprecedented number at the time.  The American designers and their models stole the show, providing a youthful approach and stunning the primarily French audience.\nIn 2011, the Huffington Post Game Changer Awards honored the African American models of Versailles with the Style Award. The models included Pat Cleveland, Bethann Hardison, Billie Blair, Jennifer Brice, Alva Chinn, Norma Jean Darden, Charlene Dash, Barbara Jackson, Ramona Saunders, and Amina Warsuma.\nIn 2012, filmmaker Deborah Riley Draper chronicled the event in the feature documentary, ''Versailles '73: American Runway Revolution''.  The film included designer Stephen Burrows, French Chambre Syndicale President Didier Grumbach, and many of the models, journalists and guest who attended the event in 1973.\nIn 2016 another documentary \"Battle at Versailles\" was made by the fashion network M2M, chronicling the event. The film was narrated by Stanley Tucci and featured many of the event's participants.\nA fictionalized version of the Battle is depicted in the television miniseries Halston, which premiered May 2021 on Netflix.\nOn December 7, 2023, Madrid-based board game publisher Salt & Pepper Games launched a crowdfunding campaign for their card-driven tabletop game depicting the event on the Gamefound platform. In \"The Battle of Versailles,\" two players take the role of either the American or French design teams in a fashion battle to contribute the most to the reconstruction of the Palace of Versailles.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Clarissa Cruz, [http://www.oprah.com/spirit/African-American-Models-Pat-Cleveland-Bethann-Hardison-Alva-Chinn/1 \"The Bold and the Beautiful: 3 Women Who Paved the Way for Black Models\"], O, The Oprah Magazine, May 2012.\n* [http://www.versailles73movie.com \"Versailles '73:  American Runway Revolution\".]\n* [https://archiveondemand.fitnyc.edu/items/show/614 \"Versailles '73:  American Runway Revolution\" panel discussion] from Archive on Demand\n* [https://archiveondemand.fitnyc.edu/items/show/671 \"The Battle of Versailles: Robin Givhan in conversation with Patricia Mears\"] from Archive on Demand\n* [http://www.ablackmodelinparis.com \"A Black Model in Paris\"]"
