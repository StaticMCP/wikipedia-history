In earlier times a group of scattered communities linked by the railway branches that now constitutes the Railway Reserve Heritage Trail.\nOverview\nThe Mundaring and Hills Historical Society was formed in 1989. Prior to this historical and heritage issues in the Hills region saw significant losses of information, and loss of details of people and properties.  The Society has corrected this, being able to attract significant funding and patronage to maintain a museum and to collect a wide range of materials and information. It is also one of the organisations heavily involved in the annual Trek the Trail that utilises sections of the Railway Reserve Heritage Trail as an outdoor event.\nThe Mundaring and Hills Historical Society was a finalist in the 2011 Western Australian Heritage Awards.\nProjects\nProjects that the Mundaring and Hills Historical Society have been involved in include:\n* Childow Proclamation Train Sculpture 2004 – to mark the 175th anniversary of Western Australia and Proclamation Day 2004. Chidlow was the last stopping point, prior to entering Perth, for the WA Governor's train carrying WA's first constitution in 1890. The MHHS was successful in obtaining a grant for the purpose of marking this event.[http://www.175anniversary.wa.gov.au/index.cfm?fuseaction=GRANTS.small_1 175th Anniversary of Western Australia]\n* Parkerville Roll of Honour Restoration 2004 – Restoration was made possible via a grant from the ANZAC Day Working Group's Small Grant Scheme and with a significant contribution by the local Ratepayers and Residents Group. Mundaring and Hills Historical Society researched the Roll and were able to provide new insights into the men honoured on the roll.[http://www.anzac.dpc.wa.gov.au/index.cfm?event=memorialAdoptedBy&mem=304 ANZAC – A Grateful State Remembers]\nPublications\n*\n*\n*\n*\nMundaring District Museum\nThe Society has its operational headquarters in a heritage property –  the brick and iron Mundaring Station Master's House.
