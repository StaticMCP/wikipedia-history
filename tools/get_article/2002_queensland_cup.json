After earning a first round bye, they defeated Ipswich by a point in the major semi final, qualifying for their sixth overall and fourth consecutive Grand Final. Ipswich qualified for the finals for the first time after finishing third, and defeated the East Coast Tigers in the first week of the playoffs. The loss to Redcliffe saw them face Norths in the preliminary final, in which they won 29–26 to set up a rematch with the Dolphins in the Grand Final. In the regular season, Redcliffe defeated Ipswich on both occasions (20–18 in Round 2 and 24–12 in Round 12).\nFirst half\nIt took just 10 seconds for tensions to flare in the decider after Jets' prop Danny McAllister was hit with a high tackle from the kick off by Dolphins' captain Luke Scott. An all-in brawl erupted, with both teams coming together in a melee. Moments after the referees had finally regained order, the fight erupted again between Scott and McAllister. Both players were subsequently sent to the sin bin. In the 12th minute, Redcliffe opened the scoring through winger Aaron Barba. It was a dominant first half for the Dolphins, who led 22–0 at half time after tries to Bara (his second), Damien Richters and Barry Berrigan added tries.\nSecond half\nThree minutes into the second half, Redcliffe pushed their lead to 28 when winger Phil Shilvock scored, the try all but wrapping up the game. Ipswich finally got on the scoreboard in the 49th minute when winger Steven West latched onto a Ricky Bird grubber. Redcliffe scored again in the 61st minute, when a pinpoint Shane Perry chip kick found Trent Leis, who scored in his third Grand Final. Jets' centre Aaron Bulow scored seven minutes later but the game was well out of reach for Ipswich, as Redcliffe secured their third premiership. Dolphins' hooker Barry Berrigan was named man of the match.\nThe victorious Redcliffe side featured two players who would play in the Brisbane Broncos 2006 NRL Grand Final win over the Melbourne Storm, with Shane Perry starting at halfback and David Stagg starting at centre in the victory.\nPlayer statistics\nLeading try scorers\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!Pos\n!width=120 |Player\n!Team\n!Tries\n|- bgcolor=\"#d0ffd0\"\n| rowspan = 1 |1||align=\"left\"|Dan Kennedy||align=\"left\"| Burleigh Bears||34\n|-\n| rowspan = 1 |2||align=\"left\"|Aaron Barba||align=\"left\"| Redcliffe Dolphins||28\n|-\n| rowspan = 2 |3||align=\"left\"|Brian Jellick||align=\"left\"| Redcliffe Dolphins||21\n|-\n|                 align=\"left\"|Elia Tuqiri||align=\"left\"| Toowoomba Clydesdales||21\n|-\n| rowspan = 1 |5||align=\"left\"|Nick Parfitt||align=\"left\"| Toowoomba Clydesdales||19\n|}\nLeading point scorers\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!Pos\n!width=120 |Player\n!Team\n!width=20 |T\n!width=20 |G\n!width=20 |FG\n!width=20 |Pts\n|- bgcolor=\"#d0ffd0\"\n| rowspan = 1 |1||align=\"left\"|Damien Richters||align=\"left\"| Redcliffe Dolphins||10||103||-||246\n|-\n| rowspan = 1 |2||align=\"left\"|Greg Bourke||align=\"left\"| Burleigh Bears||17||77||-||222\n|-\n| rowspan = 1 |3||align=\"left\"|Scott Thorburn||align=\"left\"| East Coast Tigers||10||81||1||203\n|-\n| rowspan = 1 |4||align=\"left\"|Cameron Smith||align=\"left\"| Norths Devils||8||76||-||184\n|-\n| rowspan = 1 |5||align=\"left\"|Justin McKay||align=\"left\"| North Queensland Young Guns||8||75||1||183\n|}\nEnd-of-season awards\n* Courier Mail Medal: Scott Thorburn ( Easts Tigers)\n* Rookie of the Year: David Stagg ( Redcliffe Dolphins)\nSee also\n* Queensland Cup\n* Queensland Rugby League\nReferences"
