The book was published in 2024 by Winning Team Publishing, a company co-founded by Donald Trump Jr. and Sergio Gor. Kirk, the founder of the youth organization Turning Point USA, presents the book as a blueprint for a right-wing revolution to combat what he defines as \"wokeism\".\nContent and themes\nThe central premise of Right-Wing Revolution is that \"wokeism\" is a \"lethal ideology\" that has infiltrated every aspect of American society, including education, media, business, and government. Kirk argues that this ideology poses an existential threat to Western civilization by promoting moral relativism and seeking to \"humiliate and erase anyone who does not bow at its altar\". The book is structured to first diagnose the problems that Kirk attributes to this ideology and then to offer a prescriptive plan for countering its influence.\nThe book's themes are consistent with Kirk's public commentary and activism. It frames the current political and cultural landscape as a \"spiritual battle of Good vs. Evil\" and a direct confrontation between this ideology and traditional American values. Kirk outlines a series of \"actionable steps\" for conservatives to push back against \"wokeism\" at all levels of society. These arguments reflect Kirk's focus on what he and his organization, Turning Point USA, identify as the \"culture wars\".\nPublication and sales\nRight-Wing Revolution was published on June 18, 2024. Following Kirk's death in September 2025, his books, including Right-Wing Revolution, experienced a significant surge in sales. Fox Business reported that the book was among Amazon's top 20 bestsellers in the wake of his death.\nReception and impact\nRight-Wing Revolution was criticized for being hypocritical and lazy, and creating an overly simplistic view of modern American politics.\nThe book mirrors Kirk's broader \"culture war\" rhetoric that he previously helped popularize, particularly on college campuses.\nReferences"
