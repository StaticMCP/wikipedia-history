Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, did not itself bestow a national championship.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Increase in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFE6E6; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Decrease in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFFFE6; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Not ranked previous week\n|-\n| style=\"background:#9cf; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\"|\n| &nbsp;\n| National champion\n|-\n|\n| &nbsp;\n| Win–loss record\n|-\n|\n| &nbsp;\n| Number of first place votes\n|-\n|\n|\n| Tied with team above or below also with this symbol\n|}\nChampions (by ranking)\nThe AP Poll and most other rankings consider Texas A&M the season's champion. The Dickinson System considers USC the season's champion. Litkenhous Ratings and the Sagarin Ratings Predictor method consider Cornell to have been the season's chamnpion.\n*AP poll: Texas A&M\n*Berryman QPRS: Texas A&M\n*Billingsley Report: Texas A&M\n*Boand System: Texas A&M\n*College Football Researchers Association: Texas A&M\n*DeVold System Texas A&M\n*Dickinson System: USC\n*Dunkel System: Texas A&M\n*Helms Athletic Foundation: Texas A&M\n*Houlgate System: Texas A&M\n*Litkenhous Ratings: Cornell\n*National Championship Foundation: Texas A&M\n*Poling System: Texas A&M\n*Sagarin Ratings Elo chess method: Texas A&M\n*Sagarin Ratings Predictor method Litkenhous Ratings: Cornell\n*Williamson System: Texas A&M\nNote: AP Poll, Boand System, Dickinson System, Dunkel System, Houlgate System, Litkenhous Ratings, Poling System, and Williamson System were given contemporarily.
