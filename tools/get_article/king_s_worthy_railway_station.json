It was built in 1909 as a direct petition from local residents of Easton and Abbots Worthy.\nConstruction of the station resulted in the addition of another passing loop on the line and a single siding which was later provided with a goods shed. Five years before the closure of the station the passing loop was removed leaving the station building on the remaining single platform (previously the northbound platform). The station was demolished after closure and the site is now under the A34 dual carriageway.\nMap\nmap showing (right) railways in the vicinity of King's Worthy]]\nRoutes\nLine and station closed |next=Line and station closed |route=Great Western RailwayDidcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway |col= }}\nReferences"
