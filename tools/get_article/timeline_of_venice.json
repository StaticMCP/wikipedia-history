Such accounts are found in some medieval chronicles, but not accepted by modern scholars, since settlements on Rialto were fully urbanized much later and transformed into Venice proper only since the first half of the 9th century.\n** First mention of Poveglia.\n* 452 – Traditional date for the adoption of a \"consular government\" in Venice. Not accepted by modern scholars.\n* 554 – The Gothic War ends with Byzantine victory. Entire Italy is again under imperial rule, and governed as the Praetorian prefecture of Italy, that includes the province of Venetia et Histria, centered in Aquileia.\n* 568 – Lombards invade Italy, and conquer Aquileia. Byzantine province of Venetia is reduced to coastal regions, and its administrative center is moved to Oderzo, while ecclesiastical center is moved from Aquileia to Grado.\n* 584 – The remaining Byzantine territories of the Praetorian prefecture of Italy are reorganized into the Exarchate of Ravenna, that also includes the remnants of Byzantine Venetia.\n* 639 – Byzantine Venetia is governed by magister militum Mauricius.\n* 697 – Traditional date for Paolo Lucio Anafesto becoming the first Doge of Venice.

Byzantine Venetia is governed by magister militum Marcellus.\n* 726 - Byzantine emperor Leo III inaugurates iconoclastic religious policies, provoking resistance throughout Byzantine Italy, including the remnants of Byzantine Venetia. Orso Ipato is elected as doge, by traditional accounts, that are accepted in principle by modern scholars, but not in all details.\n* 751 - Fall of Ravenna to the Lombards marks the end of the Exarchate of Ravenna and weakens Byzantine rule over the Venetian Lagoon.\n* 774 – Catholic diocese established on Olivolo, comprising Dorsoduro, Luprio, and Rialto.\n* 810 - King Pepin of Italy invades the Venetian Lagoon, but fails to capture the region.\n* 812 - The Treaty of Aachen is concluded between Byzantines and Franks, and ratified by the Treaty of Ratisbon (814).
