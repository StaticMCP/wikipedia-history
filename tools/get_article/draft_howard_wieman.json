Bonner Prize in Nuclear Physics\n.\nThe citation reads:\n“For developing foundational experimental and theoretical tools to enable and guide generations of experiments in relativistic heavy ion physics. The combination of experiment and theory led to the initial discoveries at RHIC, ongoing precision studies of the properties of hot nuclear matter, and to exploration of the nuclear matter phase diagram.”\nWieman is best known for leading the team that designed the  STAR\nTime Projection Chamber (TPC) which was used to discover a new state of matter, the strongly interacting Quark-gluon plasma. The discovery was made at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The  STAR TPC was built in Berkeley ,\ninstalled at RHIC, and tested throughout 1998 and 1999. The first Gold-Gold collisions at RHIC were recorded with the TPC on June 12, 2000\n. A brief seven months later, in January 2001, the STAR collaboration published the first measurement of elliptic flow in ultra-relativistic Gold-Gold collisions which indicated that the collision zone at RHIC energies is behaving hydrodynamically and with significant thermalization.  This was a key step in making the discovery of a strongly interacting Quark Gluon Plasma, and a perfect liquid\n,\nwhich was announced in 2005 by all 4 RHIC detector collaborations.\nAt the time of installation, The STAR TPC was the biggest in the world (50,000 liters) and the photo\nof the first Gold-Gold collision in the TPC is an iconic figure that appears frequently in textbooks      .\nThe STAR TPC is still in operation today after having taken significant and ground breaking data every year since 2000\n.\nWieman received his bachelor's degree from Oregon State University in 1966 and his doctorate in 1975 from the University of Washington.  His doctoral advisor was Isaac Halpern. He was a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Colorado and then spent the bulk of his career as a Senior Scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\n.\nAt times, he also worked for and in collaboration with the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI, Darmstadt). He retired from LBNL in 2011 but remains active in research.\nAt LBNL he was responsible for the design and installation of the Low Energy Beam Line at the Bevalac heavy ion accelerator and for the development of two generations of large Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). His first TPC was the EOS Time Projection Chamber at the Bevalac,\nwhich he co-led with Hans-Georg Ritter.  Wieman then led the design and construction of a larger TPC for the  STAR  detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory.   He finished his career working with thin, high resolution, active pixel sensors.  In particular, the Heavy Flavor Tracker (HFT) pixel detector for the STAR experiment was a ground-breaking device\n.\nIt became operational in 2014 and was used to observe D mesons produced in heavy ion collisions.\nWieman is a  Fellow  of the American Physical Society , was awarded the LBNL J.M. Nitschke Technical Excellence Award in 1999 , and received the APS Tom W. Bonner Prize for Nuclear Physics  in 2015.\nReferences"
