The award goes to the producers of the series. The award is often cited as one of the \"main awards\" at the Emmys ceremonies.\nHistory\nSince its institution in 1951 the award has changed names many times in its history. It was first called Best Dramatic Show from 1951 to 1954, then Best Dramatic Series in 1955 and 1956. In 1957, no specific award for drama was given, but in 1958 the category was split into two separate categories, Best Dramatic Anthology Series, and Best Dramatic Series with Continuing Characters with a winner selected from each category. The following year, the category was differently split into two separate categories, Best Dramatic Series – Less Than One Hour. In 1960, the name was changed yet again to Outstanding Program Achievement in the Field of Drama; this name was kept from 1960 to 1964. In 1966, it had its sixth name change to Outstanding Dramatic Series or Outstanding Series-Drama; this was used from 1966 until recently, when it became Outstanding Drama Series.\nIn 1988, Rumpole of the Bailey (PBS) was initially nominated in the Outstanding Miniseries category but the Academy ruled that the nomination was not valid a few days later and later allowed the program to compete in the Outstanding Drama Series category.\nSince 2000, every single winner has been a serial drama: The West Wing (2000–2003), The Sopranos (2004, 2007), Lost (2005), 24 (2006), Mad Men (2008–2011), Homeland (2012), Breaking Bad (2013–2014), Game of Thrones (2015–2016, 2018–2019), ''The Handmaid's Tale (2017), Succession (2020, 2022-2023), The Crown (2021), Shōgun (2024) and The Pitt (2025). Since the advent of Hill Street Blues in 1981, every winner has had some serialized arcs with the exception of Law & Order. The majority of these shows have won between their first and fifth seasons. Only one show have been exceeded with more than sixth seasons onwards who have won multiple times is Game of Thrones with sixth, seventh, and eighth; the remaining shows within more than sixth seasons who also won one are The Sopranos with sixth and Law & Order with seventh.\nSince 1967, they are the only non-US series or television series from outside the United States to be nominated including The Avengers, The Forsyte Saga, The First Churchills, Elizabeth R, The Six Wives of Henry VIII, Upstairs, Downstairs, Rumpole of the Bailey, Downton Abbey, Bodyguard, Killing Eve, Squid Game, and Slow Horses; most non-US series are entirely United Kingdom, Squid Game is the only Asia and South Korea to do so. Elizabeth R and Upstairs, Downstairs are the only two to win, while the latter is the only one to win multiple times.\nGame of Thrones, Hill Street Blues, L.A. Law, Mad Men, and The West Wing share the record for most wins in the category with four. Law & Order holds the record for most nominations in the category with eleven, while Better Call Saul holds the record for most nominations without a win with seven.\nSince 2022, Squid Game (Korean) and Shōgun (Japanese) are the only non-English language series to be nominated in that category; Shōgun being the first to win.\nSince 2023, The Last of Us and Fallout are the only series based on their respective video games to be nominated in that category.\nWinners and nominations\nThe following tables, divided by decade, display the winners and nominees of the \"Drama Series\" award, according to the Primetime Emmy Awards database:\n1950s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"90%\" | Program\n! width=\"5%\" | Network\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\"|Best Dramatic Show\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center\"| 1951(3rd) || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Pulitzer Prize Playhouse || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | KECA-TV\n|-\n| Fireside Theatre || KTLA\n|-\n| I Remember Mama || KTTV, CBS\n|-\n| The Philco Television Playhouse || KNBH, NBC\n|-\n| Studio One || KTTV, CBS\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center\"| 1952(4th) || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Studio One || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | CBS\n|-\n| Celanese Theatre || ABC\n|-\n| The Philco-Goodyear Television Playhouse || NBC\n|-\n| Pulitzer Prize Playhouse || ABC\n|-\n| Robert Montgomery Presents || NBC\n|-\n| rowspan=13 style=\"text-align:center\" | 1953(5th)\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\"| Best Dramatic Program\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Robert Montgomery Presents\n| NBC\n|-\n| Celanese Theatre || ABC\n|-\n| Kraft Television Theatre || rowspan=\"2\" | NBC\n|-\n| The Philco-Goodyear Television Playhouse\n|-\n| Studio One || CBS\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\"| Best Mystery, Action or Adventure Program\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Dragnet\n| NBC\n|-\n| The Big Story || NBC\n|-\n| Foreign Intrigue || Syndicated\n|-\n| Martin Kane, Private Eye || NBC\n|-\n| Racket Squad || CBS\n|-\n| rowspan=13 style=\"text-align:center\" | 1954(6th)\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\"| Best Dramatic Program\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| The United States Steel Hour\n| ABC\n|-\n| Kraft Television Theatre || rowspan=\"3\" | NBC\n|-\n| The Philco-Goodyear Television Playhouse\n|-\n| Robert Montgomery Presents\n|-\n| Studio One || CBS\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\"| Best Mystery, Action or Adventure Program\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Dragnet\n| NBC\n|-\n| Foreign Intrigue || NBC\n|-\n| I Led 3 Lives || Syndicated\n|-\n| Suspense || rowspan=2|CBS\n|-\n| The Web\n|-\n| rowspan=19 style=\"text-align:center\" | 1955(7th)\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\"| Best Dramatic Series\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| The United States Steel Hour\n| ABC\n|-\n| Four Star Playhouse || CBS\n|-\n| Medic || rowspan=\"2\" | NBC\n|-\n| The Philco-Goodyear Television Playhouse\n|-\n| Studio One || CBS\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\"| Best Mystery or Intrigue Series\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Dragnet\n| NBC\n|-\n| Foreign Intrigue || NBC\n|-\n| I Led 3 Lives || rowspan=3| Syndicated\n|-\n| Racket Squad\n|-\n| Waterfront\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\"| Best Western or Adventure Series\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Stories of the Century\n| Syndicated\n|-\n| The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok || rowspan=2|Syndicated\n|-\n| Annie Oakley\n|-\n| Death Valley Days || CBS\n|-\n| The Roy Rogers Show || NBC\n|-\n| rowspan=13 style=\"text-align:center\" | 1956(8th)\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\"| Best Dramatic Series\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| '''Producers' Showcase\n| NBC'\n|-\n| Alcoa-Goodyear Theatre || NBC\n|-\n| Climax! || rowspan=\"3\" | CBS\n|-\n| Studio One\n|-\n| The United States Steel Hour\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\"| Best Action or Adventure Series\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n|| Disneyland || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | ABC\n|-\n| Alfred Hitchcock Presents || CBS\n|-\n| Dragnet || NBC\n|-\n| Gunsmoke || rowspan=2 | CBS\n|-\n| The Lineup\n|-\n| rowspan=13 style=\"text-align:center\" | 1957(9th)\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\"| Best Series – Half Hour or Less\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n|| The Phil Silvers Show (comedy) || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | CBS\n|-\n| Alfred Hitchcock Presents (anthology) || CBS\n|-\n| Father Knows Best (comedy) || NBC\n|-\n| The Jack Benny Program (comedy) || rowspan=2|CBS\n|-\n| Person to Person (interview)\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\"| Best Series – One Hour or More\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n|| '''Caesar's Hour (comedy) || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | NBC'\n|-\n| Climax!
