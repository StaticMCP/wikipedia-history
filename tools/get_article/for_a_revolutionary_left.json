Founded in 2017 to run in the 2018 Italian general election, its leader was Marco Ferrando.\nComposition\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|Parties\n!Main ideology\n!Leaders\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Workers' Communist Party (PCL)\n|Communism\n|Marco Ferrando\n|-\n|bgcolor=#DC100F|\n|Left Class Revolution (SCR)\n|Communism\n|Claudio Bellotti\n|}\nBoth parties were Trotskyist, even though they adhered to different strands of Trotskyism as well as different political internationals. Moreover, both of them were for a long time factions within the multi-tendency Communist Refoundation Party (PRC) and later splinter groups of that party.\nWorkers' Communist Party\nThe PCL had its roots in the Communist Revolutionary League, active since 1979, affiliated to Proletarian Democracy (DP) since 1989 and finally merged into the PRC, like most of DP, in 1991. Within the PRC, the group was known as Communist Project. In 2006 the group left the party and set up the PCL, Italian section of International Socialist League.\nLeft Class Revolution\nSCR was launched in 2014, within the PRC, as the re-boot of HammerSickle (FM), a group formed in 1986 within the youth section of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) in Ferrara, Emilia-Romagna, editing a journal under the same name. In 1991 the group joined the PRC and was organised as an internal faction. In 2016 SCR left the PRC and became an independent party.\nElectoral results\nItalian Parliament\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n|colspan=6|Chamber of Deputies\n|-\n!Election year\n!No. ofoverall votes\n!% ofoverall vote\n!No. ofoverall seats won\n!+/–\n!Leader\n|-\n!2018\n|29,176\n|0.08\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n|colspan=6|Senate of the Republic\n|-\n!Election year\n!No. ofoverall votes\n!% ofoverall vote\n!No. ofoverall seats won\n!+/–\n!Leader\n|-\n!2018\n|32,501\n|0.10\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nReferences"
