Its natural habitat is sub-tropical or tropical moist lowland forests.\nThis species was formerly considered one of the 15 recognised subspecies of what was then known as the variable dwarf kingfisher (Ceyx lepidus or Alcedo lepidus). A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2013 found that most of the insular subspecies had substantially diverged from one another. The variable dwarf kingfisher was therefore split and 12 of the subspecies, including the Guadalcanal dwarf kingfisher, were promoted to species status. At the same time the name of the variable dwarf kingfisher was changed to the Moluccan dwarf kingfisher.\nIn 2023 the Malaita dwarf kingfisher (Ceyx malaitae) was made a subspecies of the Guadalcanal dwarf kingfisher.\nReferences"
