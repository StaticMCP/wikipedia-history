Lewis also commissioned a script from Gordon and Otto Preminger, who Gordon sold his half of the rights of The Scalpel, the Sword to, wanted to produce it despite it not being written. Allan refused to sell his rights stating that \"I didn't want Preminger to direct it\". Allan bought his script back from 20th Century Fox after being commissioned by Lewis. CAN$10,000 () was invested by the Canadian Film Development Corporation into Allan's first-draft script in 1976. John Kemeny secured additional investment from Columbia. Allan, Norman Jewison, Kemeny, and Michael Spencer travelled to China, with CFDC funding. Between 1975 and 1978, Allan rewrote the script four times for each new head of Columbia.\nWarner Bros. stated that they would only finance the film if a major star was cast as Bethune. Robert Redford, Jack Nicholson, Paul Newman, Dustin Hoffman, and Warren Beatty were listed as possible options. Redford was interested, but requested a rewrite of the script which Kemeny and Kotcheff could not finance. Jewison proposed making a television series, but all of the networks declined.\nIn June 1980, Kemeny and Denis Héroux announced a plan to create Bethune-The Long March on a budget of $25 million. Kotcheff was attached to direct the film. Kemeny and Kotcheff tried to negotiate a deal with the China Film Corporation and August First Film Studio. Filming was meant to start in February 1981, but financial troubles resulted in the rights reverting to Allan. Kemeny left the project in 1984.\nNicolas Clermont and Pieter Kroonenburg became involved in 1985, after being shown the script by Allan's daughter Julie, who worked for their company Filmline. Kroonenburg was first made aware of the project by Gilles Carle in 1984. Filmline purchased the script for $5,000. Julie also negotiated with the Chinese government and the film was given support from August First Film Studio while the Chinese received the distribution rights for China and eastern Europe. Clermont stated that \"What it cost Bertolucci and Spielberg $5 million to $6 million to shoot in China cost us nothing\". French producer Jacques Dorfmann joined the production and was given the distribution rights for Europe. According to Kroonenburg the deal with China was worth $3–4 million and aided in filming the movie in five provinces. Chinese screenwriter Li Bai edited the script.\nKroonenburg and Clermont were interested in having a European coproducer. Leo Pescarolo, an Italian producer whose brother-in-law worked on the Marco Polo miniseries in China, was interested in the project, but was unable to work out a deal. Dorfmann was making A Woman of Shanghai in China, but needed funding. Dorfmann agreed to become a minority coproducer for Bethune in exchange for Kroonenburg and Clermont being minority coproducers for his film.\nJewison considered directing the film, but was unable to due to scheduling conflicts with Moonstruck. Sidney J. Furie was offered the position, but stated that he could only do it if the film was delayed. Kotcheff was attached to direct the film, but left due to payment disputes after only being offered $500,000. Kotcheff also believed that the film's budget was not high enough and would encounter similar problems to Joshua Then and Now. Sutherland proposed Ralph L. Thomas, a friend of his and who directed a film he starred in. Thomas stated that the script needed major changes. In January 1987, Phillip Borsos, who had been out of work for eighteen months and multiple recent projects cancelled, was selected to direct.\nIn the 1940s Darryl F. Zanuck wanted Walter Pidgeon to play Bethune, Pidgeon later portrayed him in a radio drama. Sean Connery, Richard Dreyfuss, Christopher Plummer, and Redford were interested in playing Bethune, but Donald Sutherland, who previously played Bethune in a CBC Television movie, was selected. Sutherland previously attempted to create a $40 million film based on Roderick Stewart's Bethune biography with Gillo Pontecorvo directing.\nwas the actor who played Bethune]]\nAn agreement in 1986 divided the budget with $5 million coming from Canada, $3 million from China, and $2 million from France. An agreement signed by Minister of Communications Flora MacDonald and Ai Zhisheng on 23 February 1987, listed the budget of the film as $13.5 million. Hemdale Film Corporation bought the United States distribution rights for $2.5 million and Telefilm invested $8.2 million. The film's budget rose from $11 million to between $15–20 million. It was the most expensive film in Canadian history at the time until Shadow of the Wolf.\nShooting\nThe film was in production for five years. The film was shot in China from 15 April to 4 August 1987, although filming was halted for one week in May due to the Canadian production crew protesting the poor working conditions. The protest increased the film's budget by $50,000. Further production was halted for a year due to financial problems until Telefilm granted another $2.5 million to the production. Jane Birkin was initially cast to play Frances Bethune, but was unavailable for shooting in Spain and was replaced by Helen Mirren. Shooting was completed in Canada and Spain by 23 December 1988. MacDonald ordered Telefilm to complete the movie at any cost, but the Canadian government's support for the film waned after the Tiananmen Square Massacre.\nBob McKeown produced Strangers in a Strange Land, a documentary about the filming of Bethune: The Making of a Hero in China, and it was shown at the 1988 Toronto International Film Festival. The film cost $200,000, with Filmline and the documentary producers evenly dividing the cost. Filmline refused to approve the documentary airing on television as they felt it was too negative.\nCommunication issues between the English and Chinese speaking crew troubled the production. Neil Trifunovich, the special effects coordinator, stated that \"The Chinese couldn’t understand why we would not blow up a real mule. They wanted to put explosives on the side of the animal’s head.\" when they were filming a scene of an artillery attack on a mule train. 2,000 extras from villages in Wutai County were used for Bethune's funeral scene.\nA Japanese plane could not be found in China for a scene of an attack against Bethune's caravan, but was found in Canada. However, the Chinese could not find somebody to fly it and a foreign pilot would not be allowed to fly over a military sensitive area. A model plane, that arrived months late, was given to the production, but it was destroyed in a test flight. Sutherland stated \"Thankfully, the pilot was unhurt\".\nAllan criticized Sutherland for wanting the script rewritten and that he was \"egomaniacal\". Allan, whose contract with Filmline required his permission to be granted to any script changes, approved Don Miller to be a script doctor while Dennis Clark was hired by Sutherland. Sutherland claimed that \"Ted’s script was pretentious and two-dimensional and unplayable\" and that the script was rewritten by Dennis Clark, one of the three uncredited writers. Clark also claimed that he wrote the film and stated that \"Contractually, I shouldn’t be talking to you, but the producers haven’t paid me for my last year of work, so I have no qualms about it\", as he was still owed $30,000 for his work on the film. Borsos stated that there were thirty-three drafts of the film, and that Clark wrote most of the film. Clermont stated that Clark's claims were \"totally ridiculous\" and that he should either file a union grievance or \"shut up\".\nEditing\nThe edit proposed by Borsos, telling the film in chronological order, was rejected by the producers, Telefilm, and Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in September 1989. The film was instead edited, without the involvement of Borsos, to be shown as a series of flashbacks. Borsos' version of the film was 150 minutes long while the version accepted by the producers was 116 minutes long.\nRelease\nThe film was initially planned to be shown at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival and theatrically released in late 1988. Clermont later hoped to have the film shown at the 1988 Toronto International Film Festival. The film was supposed to open the 1989 Montreal World Film Festival, but delays with the musical score shifted it to closing the festival, with Shirley Valentine opening instead, before being removed from the schedule.\nThe film was not shown at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival as its editing was only finished \"10 minutes before\" Clermont \"got on the plane to Cannes\" according to Kroonenburg. The film was shown to around 250 people at a theatre in Cannes, but journalists were not allowed in. The film premiered at the 1990 Montreal World Film Festival on 27 August. Around $2 million was spent by Filmstar on advertising the movie. The film was unsuccessful at the box office, grossing less than $400,000 during its theatrical run. The film was re-edited and aired on television as a two-part four-hour miniseries on 1–2 January 1992.\nReception\nMarc Horton gave the film 3 stars in his review for the Edmonton Journal, in which he praised Sutherland's performance, but criticized the fast pace of the theatrical cut and how much it jumped from location to location. Stephen Holden, writing in The New York Times, was critical of the film's non-chronological presentation and for placing Bethune's time in Spain late in the film despite it occurring before his time in China. Bob Remington, reviewing the miniseries in the Edmonton Journal, stated that it was not a significant improvement from the theatrical release and was \"more drawn out than Mao's Long March\".\nNoel Taylor praised the film's visuals and usage of landscapes in his four star review in the Ottawa Citizen The Oregonians 2½ star review praised the location shooting, but noted that Sutherland did not feel like Bethune and that the film was \"more educational than dramatic\". The film's photography and Sutherland's performance was praised by John Levesque in The Hamilton Spectator. Bob Campbell, writing in The Star-Ledger, gave the film two stars in his review which criticized the scenes in Montreal as \"cramped, dull and artificial\" and in Spain as \"stiff and sketchy\", but praised the scenes in China as the best part of the film.\nKevin Thomas, writing in the Los Angeles Times, stated that the film was \"an often absorbing and intelligent film biography, boasts one of Donald Sutherland’s best portrayals\". Christopher Johnston, writing in The Canadian Press, praised Sutherland's acting, but criticized the lack of scenes depicting his childhood and not enough focus being placed on his relationship with her wife. Dave Kehr, writing in the New York Daily News, gave the film one star and compared it to other \"overstuffed biographies\" like The Story of Alexander Graham Bell (1939) and Wilson (1944). Robert W. Butler, writing in The Kansas City Star, gave the film 2½ stars and stated that a history lesson rather than a compelling film.\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"5\" scope=\"row\"| 10th Atlantic International Film Festival\n| rowspan=\"5\" | 1990\n| Best Feature Film\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Bethune: The Making of a Hero\n| rowspan=\"5\"\n| rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| Best Set Design\n|-\n| Best Art Direction\n| Enrique Alarcon\n|-\n| Best Director\n| Phillip Borsos\n|-\n| Best Costume Design\n| Olga Dimitrov\n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\" scope=\"row\"| 12th Genie Awards\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 26 November 1991\n| Best Art Direction\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Bethune: The Making of a Hero\n|\n| rowspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| Best Costume Design\n|\n|-\n| Best Director\n| Phillip Borsos\n|\n|-\n| Best Cinematography\n| Raoul Coutard  Mike Molloy\n|\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nNotes\nExternal links\n*"
