Other families, such as the Longs, have had a long tradition of standing for elected office, usually in the House of Commons. Many such families were part of the landed gentry, who often exerted political control in a certain locality over many generations.\n(Dyke-)Aclands\n* Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 11th Baronet, MP 1837-86\n** Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 12th Baronet, MP 1882–92.
