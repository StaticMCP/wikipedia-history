As reigning Princes of the Principality of Rheina-Wolbeck, a Sovereign State with an area of 556 square Kilometers and capital city Rheine, they also belonged to the German nobility. The immediate territory of the family was mediatised by the Grand Duchy of Berg in 1806. As a former ruling or the mediatised one the family belonged to the small circle of high nobility who enjoyed equal rights for marriage purposes with the royal or reigning families. Their motto is: Potius mori quam foedari.\nThe family had a hereditary seat in the Upper House (Erste Kammer) of the parliament of the Kingdom of Hannover and were members of the Prussian House of Lords.
