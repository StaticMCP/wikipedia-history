It was last contested in 2022, with Stephen Holyday being elected councillor.\nHistory\nToronto municipal ward boundaries were significantly modified in 2018, passing through three models (44-ward, 47-ward, and 25-ward). Ultimately, for the purposes of administering the 2018 election, the 25-ward structure was used and later upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2021.\nFrom 2014 to 2017, the City of Toronto engaged in a ward boundary review evaluating the city's previous 44-ward model.\nBased on this, and in preparation for the 2018 municipal election, the City of Toronto added 3 new wards to  create a 47-ward model.  This model was in effect at the opening of the 2018 municipal election.\nThe 2018 Toronto municipal election ran from May 1, 2018, to October 22, 2018, and while underway the provincial government introduced the Better Local Government Act, 2018, S.O. 2018, c. 11 - Bill 5. The act was assented to on August 14, 2018.\nThe immediate effect of this act was to eliminate all previous ward models, and replace them with a 25-ward model designed to align with the provincial and federal ridings boundaries in effect at that time.\nThe timing of the boundary change was controversial, and the City of Toronto sued the province contesting the provisions' constitutionality. In the absence of an injunction, and with the pending threat of the province invoking the notwithstanding clause which would defeat any constitutional challenge, the election continued under the 25-ward model.\nThe nomination period originally scheduled to close on July 27, 2018, was extended to September 14, 2018. This allowed new candidates to run, and existing candidates to either withdraw or to reassign their candidacy to a different constituency.\nIn a judgment rendered October 1, 2021, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the constitutionality of the provisions, and the 25-ward model remained in effect for the 2022 Toronto municipal election.\nThe current ward is an amalgamation of the old Ward 3 (western section), the old Ward 4 (eastern section).\n2018 municipal election\nWard 2 was first contested during the 2018 municipal election. Then-Ward 3 incumbent Stephen Holyday was elected with 38.58 per cent of the vote.\n2022 municipal election\nStephen Holyday was comfortably re-elected in 2022 with 72.28 per cent of the vote.\nGeography\nEtobicoke Centre is part of the Etobicoke and York community council.\nThe ward's west boundary is the municipal border with the Region of Peel, and the east boundary is the Humber River. The north boundary is roughly along Eglinton Avenue, Martin Grove Road and Dixon Road, and the south boundary is roughly along the Mimico Creek, Dundas Street, Kipling Avenue, Bloor Street and Highway 427.\nCouncillors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Council term\n! colspan=\"2\" |Member\n|-\n!
