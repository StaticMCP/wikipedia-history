It was built by King Kawila in 1801, mirroring the style of the Chang Phueak Monument. Surrounded by a pond, the lions symbolized Chiang Mai's renewed power and deterred future Burmese invasions. The twin lions are considered guardian deities who protect the city and are a sacred site revered by the people of Chiang Mai.\nHistory\nThe monument was built during the reign of King Kawila in 1801, located about 2 kilometers north of Chiang Mai city. The two lion statues face east and north, respectively. Before going into battle, troops would stop at this site to perform a ceremony to bring good fortune. Later, the intersection became known as Khwang Sing Chai Mongkon (Auspicious Lion Intersection).\nKing Inthawichayanon, the 7th ruler of Chiang Mai (r. 1870–1897), later ordered the construction of a nearby temple, now known as Wat Khwang Singh. On March 8, 1935, the Fine Arts Department designated the monument as a national historical site. In 1996, to mark the 700th anniversary of Chiang Mai, government and private organizations collaborated to restore and enhance the Khwang Singh Monument and its surroundings. The restoration included excavating a moat and constructing a wide, brick-paved platform with stairs leading up from the east. The lion statues, each standing about 2 meters tall and painted white, are enclosed within the site.\nToday, it remains a sacred site where newly appointed governors of Chiang Mai pay their respects to seek blessings. Since its completion, a ceremony has been held annually to invite guardian deities and sacred spirits to reside at this location. Over 300 mediums participated in the ceremony, offering sacrifices and performing traditional dances to honor these guardian spirits.\nKhuang Singh Monument lokale info IMG20240124113444.jpg|Local information about the monument\nKhuang Singh Monument Overzicht oostzijde IMG20240124113533.jpg|Overview of the monument from the east\nKhuang Singh Monument Oostwaarts gerichte paviljoen IMG20240124113549.jpg|Lion statue facing east\nKhuang Singh Monument Noordwaarts gerichte paviljoen IMG20240124113619.jpg|Lion statue facing north\nReferences"
