The latter is in all probability a  re-transcription from Cyrillic of the traditional German-Jewish \"Glückmann\" meaning \"lucky man\". Kingslake studied optical design at the Imperial College of Science and Technology, under the eminent optical designer and theoretician Alexander Eugen Conrady, earning a master's degree, subsequently marrying Professor Conrady's eldest daughter, Hilda Conrady Kingslake, herself a prominent English-American researcher in the field of optics.\nCareer\nIn 1929, Kingslake was invited to the United States to teach at the University of Rochester, where he founded the Institute of Applied Optics, now known as The Institute of Optics. In 1937, Kingslake became the head of Optical Design department of Eastman Kodak while continuing his teaching at the university.\nIn 1958, Kingslake and wife Hilda edited an unfinished manuscript by Conrady and published a sequel to Conrady's book, Applied Optics and Optical Design.\nSince 1974, SPIE has awarded the Rudolf Kingslake Medal to recognize the most noteworthy original paper published in the society's journal, Optical Engineering.\nKingslake was active in The Optical Society, and served the Society's president in 1948-49. He received the Frederic Ives Medal in 1973 and was elected an Honorary Member of OSA in 1984. Both he and his wife were made Fellows of the Society; he was in the inaugural class of Fellows in 1959, and she was elected in 1966.\nRudolf Kingslake died on February 28, 2003, in Rochester, NY, at age 99, two weeks after the death of his wife, Hilda.\nBooks by Kingslake\n* Applied Optics and Optical Engineering\n* Lenses in Photography: The Practical Guide to Optics for Photographers\n* Optics in Photography\n* Lens Design Fundamentals\n* A History of the Photographic Lens\n* Applied Optics and Optical Design, Part II by A.E.
