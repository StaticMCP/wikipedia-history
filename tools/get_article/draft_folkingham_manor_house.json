It might have been built from stones taken from Folkingham Castle or Sempringham Priory (as it had been abolished in dissolution of the monasteries a century prior). It was built from Ancaster limestone, with a Collyweston stone slate roof. It was originally known as Clinton House. A map of the town produced circa 1700 shows an orchard to the north of the house, which was gradually built over as the town grew. In the early 18th century walls around the house where built, these are now Grade II listed.\nIt was owned by the Heathcote family in the Victorian period, who had bought it on the 24th of June 1788. It was updated by Heathcote in the late 18th century, including to the gates. When the Folkingham manor estate went up for auction in 1920, the house was sold for £5,600. It was again listed for sale in 2015, this time for £1.05 million.\nReferences"
