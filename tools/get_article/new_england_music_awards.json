Bands and artists from the New England region of the United States are eligible for receipt of the awards.\nNomination process\nRecipients are selected through their recordings, appearances and reputation. The awards were created by music promoter Joe Graham and Sugarpop Records label executive Dennis Hennessey in 2011, and the first ceremony occurred in 2012. The nominating committee consists of music journalists, radio personalities, record label executives and talent scouts. Event coordinator Mike Flynn says \"when you take New England as a whole and look at all the amazing music and talent that's out there, it's mind blowing,\" adding \"putting that talent together under one roof also helps some artists get recognition that they might not have had before.\"\nHistory\n2012 awards\nThe inaugural 2012 New England Music Awards were held at Boston Hard Rock Cafe, on March 9, 2012.\n*Band of the Year – Grace Potter and the Nocturnals\n*Album of the Year – Ragtop Angel by the Adam Ezra Group\n*Song of the Year – \"Takin Off\" by the Adam Ezra Group\n*Producer of the Year – Aaron Johnson\n*Songwriter of the Year – Martin Sexton\n*New Act of the Year – Suicide Dolls\n*Female Performer of the Year – Liz Longley\n*Male Performer of the Year – Chris Trapper\n2013 awards\n, site of the 2013 and 2014 ceremonies]]\nThe 2013 New England Music Awards were held at Lowell Memorial Auditorium.
