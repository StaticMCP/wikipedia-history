They were awarded annually by CAMIE Awards, Inc., between 2001 and 2010.\nOverview\nThe word CAMIE is an acronym for \"Character And Morality In Entertainment\". The CAMIE awards were given to films which emphasize character and morality. They were established to \"encourage the production and awareness of outstanding, uplifting, and entertaining motion pictures with positive role models for building character, overcoming adversity, correcting unwise choices, strengthening families, living moral lives, and solving life’s problems with integrity and perseverance.\" In the annual awards show, rather than giving \"best actor\" or \"best film\" awards, the CAMIEs gave each film 10 statues to be divided among people who contributed at all levels of production. including both actors and film-makers. In addition to the film awards, special awards were also sometimes given; Richard Dutcher received one such award at the 2001 ceremony.\nHistory and organization\nThe CAMIEs were founded in 2001 by Dr. Glen C.
