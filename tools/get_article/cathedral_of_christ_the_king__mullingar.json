It is situated near the centre of Mullingar next to the Royal Canal. The cathedral is both the cathedral church of the Diocese of Meath and the principal centre of worship in the catholic parish of Mullingar, including parts of counties Meath and Westmeath.\nConstruction\nDesigned to replace the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception (1836-1936), planning commenced in 1920. Granite was supplied from the quarries at Barnacullia, County Dublin. William Byrne & Sons of Dublin designed the cathedral to be basilican in form and renaissance in style. Its distinctive twin towers, surmounted by bronze crosses, rise to a height of about 55 metres. It was built with a seating capacity of 5,000. Building began in March 1933 and the foundation stone was laid on 6 August of that year by Bishop Thomas Mulvany. Murphy of Dublin were the builders, while much of the artistic decoration work was completed by Earley and Company of Camden Street, Dublin, and Oppenheimer Ltd., of Old Trafford, Manchester. The formal opening and dedication of the new cathedral took place on 6 September 1936. At the request of Pope Pius XI, it became the first cathedral in the world to be dedicated to Christ the King. It was solemnly consecrated on 13 August 1939, though other sources state that the consecration occurred a few weeks later on . The total cost of the building, including decoration, was £275,000.\nMosaics\nThe works of art for which the cathedral is most noted are the mosaics in the chapels of Saint Anne and Saint Patrick. These are the work of the Russian-born mosaic artist Boris Anrep, whose work may also be found in Westminster Cathedral.\nThe Saint Patrick mosaic represents the saint lighting the Paschal fire on the mount of Slane. The principal figure is that of the saint in his apostolic mission, lifting the cross in a vigorous movement, in his other hand holding a torch.  The firewood is arranged in a Christogram, signifying the symbolic importance of the fire.\nIn the Saint Anne mosaic, the name is spelled \"Anna\". Saint Anne's image is also said to resemble the poet Anna Akhmatova. The mosaic artist (Anrep) had an affair with Akhmatova during World War I. He left Russia before the Bolsheviks seized power, and although he didn't contact her for 48 years, she remained the muse who haunted his imagination. While she has appeared in several of his mosaics, this one in Mullingar is the only to include her name. (In return, up to 34 of her poems are about him.)\nGallery\nFile:Christ the King Mullingar.jpg|View of the cathedral from Mary Street\nFile:Interior of Cathedral of Christ the King (nave), Mullingar.jpg|Interior with nave from entrance\nFile:Saint Anne mosaic Mullingar.JPG|Saint Anne Mosaic, Marian Year 1954, by Boris Anrep\nFile:Main Alter Christ the King Mullingar.jpg|Above the main altar\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.dioceseofmeath.ie Official website for the diocese]\n* [http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/meat0.htm Diocese of Meath] (GCatholic.org)\n* [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dmeat.html Catholic-Hierarchy.org - Diocese Profile]\n* [http://www.catholicity.com/encyclopedia/m/meath.html Profile from CatholicCity.com] - info from Catholic Encyclopedia"
