They had been bestowed each year since 2001, replacing the IRMA Ireland Music Awards held in the 1990s. Promoted by MCD Productions, the ceremony at which these accolades were bestowed upon worthy recipients was referred to colloquially as The Meteors, though occasionally also by its full title.\nEvent organisers confirmed in January 2011 that there would be no awards ceremony that year, with Meteor's cancellation of its sponsorship of the event widely blamed for this abrupt occurrence.\nHistory\nThe Meteor Ireland Music Awards were the equivalent to the Canadian Juno Awards, the American Grammy Awards, the Echo Awards in Germany, and the United Kingdom's BRIT Awards. The awards take their name from their sponsors, Meteor.\nEach year there was a mix of live performances and award presentations at a ceremony conducted in the Point Theatre, Dublin (2001&ndash;2007) and the Royal Dublin Society's Simmonscourt, Dublin (2008&ndash;2010). Irish artists to have showcased their music included Snow Patrol, Sinéad O'Connor, Declan O'Rourke, U2, Bell X1, Aslan, Westlife, the Blizzards, the Frames, the Coronas, Director, Hothouse Flowers, Cathy Davey, the Devlins, the Thrills, Paddy Casey, and the Immediate, whilst previous live performances by international artists have included the Pussycat Dolls, Amy Winehouse, Sugababes, Counting Crows, the Darkness, Kaiser Chiefs, Lionel Richie, and Tom Jones.\nPresenters included both Irish and international figures from music, sport, film, television, and beauty: Joe Elliott, Denis Hickie, Colin Farrell, Alex Zane, and Rosanna Davison. The award ceremony was hosted by a number of different personalities throughout its history: Ed Byrne, Patrick Kielty, Amanda Byram, Podge and Rodge alongside Deirdre O'Kane, and Dara Ó Briain.\nOriginally held in the Point Theatre in Dublin, in 2008 the award ceremony moved to the RDS Simmonscourt of the Royal Dublin Society until its cancellation in 2011.\nRecipients by year\nA list of winners is to be found on the Meteor website.\nIrish awards\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
