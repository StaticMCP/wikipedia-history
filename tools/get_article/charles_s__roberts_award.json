Roberts Awards (or CSR Awards) is an annual award for excellence in manual, tabletop games, with a focus on \"conflict simulations\", which includes simulations of non-military as well as military conflicts. From its founding in 1975 through 2021, the award was almost exclusively focused on historical wargaming, changing to a broader \"conflict simulations\" in award year 2022 (calendar year 2023).\nIt is named in honor of Charles S. Roberts the \"Father of Wargaming\" who founded Avalon Hill. The award is informally called a \"Charlie\" and officially called a \"Charles S. Roberts Award\". The Wargamer magazine called it \"very prestigious\". The Award is managed by the Charles S. Roberts Award Committee which has no commercial sponsorship, made up of designers, writers and hobbyists. It is a \"people's award\" with winners chosen through votes submitted by fans.\nHistory\nCreated at the first Origins Game Convention in 1975, the awards were the brainchild of Canadian game store owner John Mansfield. Originally the awards were titled the \"Origins Awards\" but were informally known as the Charles Roberts Awards and it was only in 1988 that Charles Roberts officially agreed to let his name be used. The split from the Origins Awards occurred in 1987, after Fortress America by Milton Bradley Company won an award. Fortress America was not considered a traditional historical wargame by members of the wargaming community, with mechanics and a target audience more akin to Risk; and there was concern that because of the large print run of a Milton Bradley product, many of the voters came from outside the traditional wargaming hobby flooding out smaller run titles.\nPrior to 2000, the awards were given at the Origins Game Fair. From 2000–2012, the awards were presented at the World Boardgaming Championships (formerly \"AvalonCon\"). The awards were not given from 2013–2018.\nCurrent award\nIn 2020, a group of gamers and industry figures restarted the award under auspices of Chairman Rodger B. MacGowan and directed and operated by Tim Tow. Like the original, it is a non-profit and not associated with commercial interests. There are an increased number of categories including art, print and play (called \"amateur wargames\"), and computer wargame categories.\nThe Awards also included the Charles Roberts Awards Hall of Fame which recognized game designers and producers that have made a significant and long lasting contribution to the contemporary board wargaming hobby.\nRecent award winners\n2003\nSource:\n*Best Pre–World War II Boardgame—Age of Napoleon (Phalanx Games)\n*Best World War II Boardgame—Europe Engulfed (GMT Games LLC)\n*Best Modern Era Boardgame—''Lock 'n Load (Shrapnel Games)\n*Best Magazine-Published Boardgame—Ignorant Armies (Strategy & Tactics/Decision)\n*Best DTP-Produced Boardgame—Thunder on South Mountain (Blue Guidon)\n*Best Wargame Graphics—Ardennes '44 (GMT Games LLC)\n*Best Professional Wargame Magazine—Against The Odds\n*Best Amateur Wargame Magazine—Panzerschreck (Minden Games)\n*Best Game Review or Game Analysis—Drive on Stalingrad, Paper Wars #50\n*Best Historical or Scenario Article—\"Napoleon at the Berezina\", Against the Odds Vol.1 No.4\n*James F.
