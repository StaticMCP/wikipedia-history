In March 1833, he became acting commander, after the previous acting commander Eduard Daniel Leopold van Ingen had died. He was relieved of his duties on 10 May 1833, when Christiaan Lans arrived from the Netherlands to replace him. At the end of 1833, he went on leave to Europe, but shipwrecked on the way home. Martinus Swarte died in Nice on 8 April 1835, where he was staying to recuperate from his wounds.\nPersonal life\nSwarte married Charlotte Bartels, daughter of Carel Hendrik Bartels around 1833.
