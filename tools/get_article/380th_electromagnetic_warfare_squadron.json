In September, the air echelon of the unit moved to the United Kingdom in preparation for Operation Torch, the allied invasion of North Africa.  In November, the squadron was reunited in French Morocco.  It continued in combat in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations until V-E Day, earning two Distinguished Unit Citations.  It was inactivated in September 1945 in Italy.\nFrom 1947 to 1949, the squadron was active in the reserve, but does not appear to have been fully manned or equipped during this time.  It was activated again in March 1952, and operated Boeing B-47 Stratojets until inactivating at the end of 1965 as the B-47 was withdrawn from service.\nIn 2008, the squadron was reactivated in the reserve at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado as the 380th Space Control Squadron.  It moved to Buckley Space Force Base in 2017 and was redesignated to its current name in December 2022.  It is an associate squadron of the 16th Electromagnetic Warfare Squadron.\nMission\nThe 380th Electromagnetic Warfare Squadron is the reserve Associate Unit to the 16th Space Control Squadron. They jointly conduct space electronic warfare support operations to enable U.S. offensive and defensive space control capabilities. The squadrons utilize the Rapid Attack Identification Detection Reporting System Block 10 systems to rapidly achieve flexible and versatile space superiority in support of theater Unified Combatant Commands, such as European or Central Commands, and United States Strategic Command's space superiority mission.\nEquipment Operated\nThe squadron will operate the RB-10 Central Operating Location, five RAIDRS Deployable Ground Segments. The units monitor, intercept and geolocate satellite communications jammers, sources of electromagnetic interference and other signals of interest. When fully operational, RB-10 will detect and geolocate signals in the C-, X-, Ku- and UHF frequency bands.\n*Rapid Attack Identification Detection Reporting System (2008–present)\n*SATCOM Interference Response System\nHistory\nWorld War II\nInitial organization and training\nThe squadron was activated at Davis-Monthan Field in March 1942 as the 380th Bombardment Squadron, one of the four original squadrons of the 310th Bombardment Group. It moved the same day to Jackson Army Air Base, Mississippi, where it began training with North American B-25 Mitchells.  A portion of the ground echelon sailed for the United Kingdom aboard the  on 5 September 1942, while the remainder sailed directly for North Africa from the United States.  The air echelon ferried the squadron's Mitchells via the North Atlantic ferry route, but bad weather delayed their movement, with the bombers arriving at RAF Hardwick between October and December 1942.\nCombat in the Mediterranean heater\nIn November 1942, the squadron flew its planes to Mediouna Airfield, French Morocco, to support Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa, although some remained behind in England until as late as March 1943.  The squadron engaged primarily in air support and interdiction in Tunisia, Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Italy and Southern France.  Through May 1943, it also attacked shipping and harbor facilities to cut the logistics lines of the Afrika Corps. It bombed marshalling yards, rail lines, highways, bridges, viaducts, troop concentrations, gun emplacements, shipping, harbors and other objectives in North Africa.  It moved forward to Tunisia with the allied forces, locating at Dar el Koudia Airfield in June.  It bombed airfields, landing grounds and gun emplacements, supporting Operation Corkscrew, the reduction of Pantelleria and Lampedusa islands during June 1943.  The following month it supported Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily.\nOn 27 August 1943, the squadron conducted a mission against marshalling yards in Benevento, Italy.  Despite heavy antiaircraft artillery, it effectively bombed the target and destroyed several enemy interceptor aircraft making persistent attacks. For this action, it was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC).  From August 1943 to the end of hostilities in the spring of 1945, it struck German lines of communication, bridges, rail lines, marshalling yards, viaducts, tunnels and road junctions in Italy.  From January through June 1944, it gave air support to ground forces in the drive toward Rome.  The squadron also engaged in psychological warfare missions, dropping propaganda leaflets behind enemy lines.\nIn August 1944, it supported Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France from its base in Ghisonaccia Airfield, Corsica.  On 10 March 1945, the squadron maintained close formation in the face of severe antiaircraft fire in successfully attacking the railroad bridge at Ora, a vital link in the German supply line to Italy.  For this action, it was awarded its second DUC.  In April 1945, it moved to Italy and was inactivated in theater in September 1945.\nAir Force reserve\nThe squadron was activated at Bedford Army Air Field, Massachusetts on 9 August 1947 as part of the reserve, moving to T. F. Green Airport, Rhode Island in March 1948.  It is unclear whether or not the squadron was fully manned or equipped with operational aircraft before it was inactivated in 1949.\nStrategic bomber operations\nThe squadron was activated in 1952 as a Strategic Air Command squadron, receiving Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombardment training from 90th Bombardment Wing from April to August 1952.  It acted as a training squadron until 1954 when it replaced its propeller-driven B-29s with new Boeing B-47E Stratojet swept-wing medium bombers, capable of flying at high subsonic speeds and primarily designed for penetrating the airspace of the Soviet Union.  In the early 1960s, the B-47 was considered to be reaching obsolescence, and was being phased out of SAC's strategic arsenal. B-47s began being sent to AMARC at Davis-Monthan in early 1965; and the squadron was inactivated in March.\nSpace Operations\nReactivated as the 380th Space Control Squadron in 2008, assuming the personnel and equipment of Detachment 1, 310th Space Group.
