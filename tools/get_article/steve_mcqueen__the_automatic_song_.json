It is their fifth single overall. The track began radio and video play as of 7 July 2008 and was released on 18 August 2008.\nThe track premiered on the 2007 NME Indie Rock Tour, along with \"Revolution\" – which later would be titled \"Secret Police\", and was originally recorded over the final weeks of 2006 with original member of The Automatic – Alex Pennie, penned to be released in April 2007, the single was for unknown reasons scrapped until 2008 when it was re-recorded with Paul Mullen as a member of the band.\nOrigins and recording\nThe track \"Steve McQueen\" was first mentioned in late 2006, after the release of the band's debut album Not Accepted Anywhere. \"Steve McQueen\", along with another track titled \"Revolution\" had been recorded over Christmas 2006 by Rob, Frost, Iwan and Pennie. The two tracks were to be released as a transition from Not Accepted Anywhere to their next studio album. \"Steve McQueen\" and \"Revolution\" were performed throughout NME 2007 Indie Rock Tour, with bootlegs of the track appearing on YouTube, however after this for an undisclosed reason the release was scrapped.\nNot Accepted Anywhere was taken overseas to the United States, where it was promoted on the Vans Warped Tour, with \"Steve McQueen\" and \"Revolution\" subsequently being removed from the set list, up until Alex Pennie left the band on 18 September 2007.

Fellow musicians Frank Turner and Chris T-T also came to the session to provide extra percussion and vocals, along with vocals from Butch, Rob, Frost, Iwan and Paul.\nComposition\nThe lyrical content of the song has been noted to be a transitional song between albums Not Accepted Anywhere – which deals with the themes of growing up and the person experiences of the band, and This Is A Fix – which deals with larger stories. The title \"Steve McQueen\" is a reference to the 1963 film The Great Escape, starring actor Steve McQueen as a captured United States Army Air Force Officer; Captain Virgil Hilts, who tries to escape from a Stalag.\n}}\nRelease\nNME, Designer Magazine and a BBC radio interview with James Frost all sourced \"Steve McQueen\" for an April 2007 release, along with b-side \"Revolution\", both of which were recorded at Christmas 2006.

Its catchy\", with James saying \"Its a bit more chunky than their earlier stuff, well done, good effort.\"\nChart performance\n\"Steve McQueen\" marked The Automatic's fourth appearance in the UK Top 40, peaking at #16 in the UK Singles Chart hence also making it their second UK Top 20 single.
