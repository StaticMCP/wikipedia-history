      "text": "# 2012 Minnesota Vikings season\n\n| AP All-pros =\n| uniform = File:Vikings 2012.png\n| shortnavlink = Vikings seasons\n}}\nThe 2012 season was the Minnesota Vikings' 52nd in the National Football League (NFL), as well as their second full season under head coach Leslie Frazier. They looked to improve upon their 3–13 season the year before, and did so after defeating the Tennessee Titans in Week 5; their win over the Houston Texans in Week 16 made this their first winning season since 2009. The Vikings also made the playoffs for the first time since 2009 with a Week 17 win over the Green Bay Packers to give them a 10–6 regular season record, but were defeated by the same opponents in the Wild Card playoff round the following week. Adrian Peterson was named the league's Most Valuable Player after rushing for 2,097 yards, just nine yards short of breaking the single-season record held by Eric Dickerson since 1984.\nOn May 10, 2012, the Minnesota State Legislature approved a bill for a new stadium for the team that would see a new facility (later named U.S. Bank Stadium) constructed by 2016 and ensure the Vikings' presence in Minneapolis through the year 2046. The bill was signed by Governor Mark Dayton on May 14, and approved by the Minneapolis City Council by a vote of 7–6 on May 25.\nOffseason\n's 6,818 rushing yards]]\nPre-draft transactions\nThe first major transactions of the 2012 offseason were the releases of veteran guards Steve Hutchinson and Anthony Herrera, and CB Cedric Griffin on March 10, as the Vikings began rebuilding their offensive line and secondary. Three days later, the team re-signed perennial backup QB Sage Rosenfels and DT Letroy Guion off their unrestricted free agents list. This was followed up with the signing of the Seattle Seahawks' unrestricted free agent TE John Carlson on a five-year contract.\nThe next week, the team brought in FB Jerome Felton, also an unrestricted free agent, from the Indianapolis Colts. They then released DT Remi Ayodele on March 21, but re-signed DT Fred Evans. March 26 was a big day for signings by the Vikings, with the re-signings of WR Devin Aromashodu and LB Erin Henderson, as well as the free agent acquisitions of CB Zack Bowman from the Chicago Bears and T Geoff Schwartz from the Carolina Panthers.\nApril saw very few transactions go through in anticipation of the 2012 NFL draft at the end of the month. Nevertheless, the Vikings signed LB Marvin Mitchell and WR Jerome Simpson, despite the fact that Simpson would miss the first three games of the season for a violation of the NFL's substance abuse policy.\n2012 draft\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|style=\"background-color:lightsteelblue; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:2em;\"|\n|Pro Bowler\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\" style=\"\"| 2012 Minnesota Vikings Draft\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Draft order\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Player name\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Position\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| College\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Contract\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Notes\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Round\n!style=\"\"| Overall\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"| 1\n! 3\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the Cleveland Browns\n|\n|-\n! 4\n| bgcolor=lightsteelblue| Matt Kalil\n| OT\n| USC\n| 4 years\n| From Browns\n|-\n! 29\n|bgcolor=lightsteelblue| Harrison Smith\n| S\n| Notre Dame\n| 4 years\n| From Ravens\n|-\n! 2\n! 35\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the Baltimore Ravens\n|\n|-\n! 3\n! 66\n| Josh Robinson\n| CB\n| UCF\n| 4 years\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"4\"| 4\n! 98\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the Baltimore Ravens\n|\n|-\n! 118\n| Jarius Wright\n| WR\n| Arkansas\n| 4 years\n| From Falcons, via Browns\n|-\n! 128\n| Rhett Ellison\n| FB\n| USC\n| 4 years\n| Compensatory pick\n|-\n! 134\n| Greg Childs\n| WR\n| Arkansas\n| 4 years\n| Compensatory pick\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 5\n! 138\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the Detroit Lions\n|\n|-\n! 139\n| Robert Blanton\n| S\n| Notre Dame\n| 4 years\n| From Browns\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 6\n! 173\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the Washington Redskins\n|\n|-\n! 175\n|bgcolor=lightsteelblue| Blair Walsh\n| K\n| Georgia\n| 4 years}}\n|-\n!rowspan=\"4\"| 7\n! 210\n| Audie Cole\n| LB\n| NC State\n| 4 years\n|\n|-\n! 211\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the Tennessee Titans\n| From Browns\n|-\n! 219\n| Trevor Guyton\n| DE\n| California\n| 4 years\n| From Seahawks, via Lions\n|-\n! 223\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the Detroit Lions\n| From Eagles, via Patriots\n|}\nand the Vikings defense against the Jacksonville Jaguars, September 9]]\nNotes:\nPost-draft transactions\nWith the 2012 Draft over, the Vikings resumed their transactions in May, signing a number of undrafted free agents to their roster, and releasing RB Caleb King, following a short jail term. With the drafting of Blair Walsh, veteran kicker Ryan Longwell found himself surplus to requirements for the Vikings and he was released on May 7. By the start of June, all of the Vikings draft selections (with the exception of T Matt Kalil) had been signed to long-term contracts.\nPreseason\nSchedule\nThis was the first year the Vikings used a TV/radio simulcast for their preseason games.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Blair Walsh capped the game's opening drive with a field goal to put the Vikings 3–0 up. However, the Packers then scored 24 unanswered points to take a 24–3 lead in the 3rd quarter. The Vikings tried to rally a comeback with a touchdown to make it 24–10, but it was too little, too late as time ran out for Minnesota.\nStatistics\nTeam leaders\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=150px style=\"\"| Category\n!width=150px style=\"\"| Player(s)\n!width=75px style=\"\"| Value\n|-\n| Passing yards || Christian Ponder || 2,935\n|-\n| Passing touchdowns || Christian Ponder || 18\n|-\n!
