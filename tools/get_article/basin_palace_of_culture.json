The building is listed as a heritage site in the register of monuments in the Silesian Voivodeship (registration number A/690/2020).\nHistory\nThe concept of building the Palace of Culture of the Zagłębie originated in 1945. It was initiated by Aleksander Zawadzki, then the Silesian-Dąbrowski Voivode and later Deputy Prime Minister. In 1949, the Committee for the Construction of the Cultural Center was established, chaired by Marian Kuzior. The design was created by Polish architect Zbigniew Rzepecki. Construction began in May 1951, led by Zjednoczenie Budownictwa Miejskiego in Sosnowiec. After seven years, the Palace was officially opened on January 11, 1958. The first administrator of the building was the Department of Culture of the Presidium of the Provincial National Council in Katowice.\nIn 1979, it became the first of its kind in Poland to be entered into the monument register under number A/1240/79. In 2020, it was relisted under number A/690/2020.\nBetween 2011 and 2014, the building underwent a comprehensive renovation. The facility reopened officially on October 11, 2014.\nArchitecture\nThe Palace of Culture of the Zagłębie, designed by Zbigniew Rzepecki, is a monumental example of Socialist realism. The building features rich ornamentation, marble finishes, spacious halls with massive columns, hand-painted majolica tiles, and grand mirrors.\nLocated in the city center, the building spans three floors with a red brick and sandstone facade. Its distinctive central tower features decorative attics and a crown-shaped roof. The facility encompasses 38,000 m³ of volume and 10,600 m² of usable space, including 1,900 m² for majestic halls.\nThe main theater hall has 588 seats, a revolving stage with an 11-meter diameter, and advanced lighting and sound systems. Additional facilities include:\n* Theater Cellar (90 seats)\n* Two Conference Rooms (100 and 50 seats)\n* Banquet Hall connected to a catering area (150 seats)\n* Chamber Hall with a grand piano (100 seats)\n* Cinema Hall (88 seats)\nCultural Activities\nThe Palace of Culture of the Zagłębie has been a hub for cultural events, including concerts, theatrical performances, exhibitions, and workshops. It organizes several annual events, such as the International Michał Spisak Music Competition and the \"Seven Deadly Sins\" art and poetry contest. The facility also hosts educational programs for children, youth, and seniors.\nExternal links\n* [http://www.palac.art.pl/ Official Website]\n*\nReferences"
