Established in 2023, awards are given to Best Show, Best Newcomer and a Panel Prize and are judged by a panel of judges on a voluntary basis who see all eligible comedy shows. From 2024, the awards were sponsored by Jones Bootmaker becoming the Jones Bootmaker ISH Edinburgh Comedy Awards.\nFormat\nThe Best Comedy Show is awarded to the comedy show that the Judges and/or the audience think is the funniest.\nThe Best Newcomer Award is given to the best show, the one the Judges and/or the audience think is the funniest from an act doing their first full-length (45 mins and over) show at the Edinburgh Fringe.\nThe Panel Prize is awarded by the Judges to any individual or group that is deemed to have done something 'amazing' at the Fringe.\nHistory\nOriginally the ISH Edinburgh Comedy Awards were created to plug a gap when the Edinburgh Comedy Awards lost their sponsorship deal with Dave. When these Awards got a new sponsorship deal in 2023, the ISH Awards went ahead as planned.\nIn 2023, there were joint winners for Best Comedy Show and Best Newcomer. Paul Foot and Julia Masli jointly won Best show, and Dan Tiernan and Fiona Ridgewell jointly won Best Newcomer.  The Panel Prize was awarded to Mark Simmons and Danny Ward for 'A Show for Gareth', a compilation show set up to raise money for the family of fellow comedian Gareth Richards.\nIn 2024, Elf Lyons won Best show, and Abby Wambaugh won Best Newcomer.  The Panel Prize was awarded jointly to Alex Petty, Best in Class, Dion Owen, Elaine Robertson and Funny Women Glitter Project.\nSponsorship\nIn 2024, the ISH Edinburgh Comedy Awards secured a sponsor Jones Bootmaker initially with an investment of £15,000 to cover the three prizes of £5,000 each for Best Show, Best Newcomer and Panel Prize. It was also announced at the May 2024 Press Launch that the winners would each receive a year's supply of Jones Bootmaker shoes. 100% of the sponsorship goes to the prizes as the awards are run on a voluntary basis.\nControversy\nPrizes\nPaul Foot commented on BBC News on the day of the 2023 Awards Ceremony that he 'didn't get any money at all', referring to half the £10 prize as the Award had joint winners.  Paul Foot said 'I was at the Awards ceremony and no one gave me any money, and I just thought it didn't seem like the right thing to say 'Excuse me can you give me five quid please'. However at a launch event for the 2024 awards, Paul Foot was presented his prize money by comedian Mark Silcox.\nLong Lists and Short Lists\nIn 2023, a list of shows were made halfway through the Fringe for the Long List  and these were whittled down to shows on the Short List.  For Best Show these were Ed Byrne, Ian Smith, Janine Harouni, Julia Masli, Luke Kempner, Marjolein Robertson, Paul Currie, Paul Foot, Phil Ellis, Seymour Mace and Sid Singh. For Best Newcomer these were Dan Tiernan, Fiona Ridgewell, Kelly McCaughan, Lachlan Werner, and Lorna Rose Treen.\nIn 2024, nominated acts for Best Show were Alfie Brown, Amy Gledhill, Ashley Haden,\nColin Hoult, David Eagle, Elf Lyons, Gareth Mutch, Jordan Brookes, Mark Thomas, Mat Ewins, Phil Ellis, Raul Kohli, and Seymour Mace.\n2023 Ceremony\nIn 2023, the ceremony was presented by Patrick Monahan and covered by BBC News. Presenters at the awards included Awards Producer Sarah Bowles, and comedians Ed Byrne and Nathan Cassidy.  It was revealed at the ceremony that Nathan was behind the inception of the Awards.  Nathan said at the ceremony he was proud of the Awards as 'it was a community coming together for something good and different - comedians, producers, critics on the panel being supportive of artists.'\n2024 Ceremony\nIn 2024, the ceremony was again presented by Patrick Monahan. Presenters at the awards included Awards Producer Sarah Bowles, Milton Jones, Bobby Davro and awards founder Nathan Cassidy.\nIndustry Recognition\nIn 2023, Awards Producer Sarah Bowles was awarded the Funny Women Industry Award 2023 for her work on the ISH Awards. Sarah said 'We wanted to being some positivity to the Edinburgh Fringe to help boost comedians who have struggled since Covid. We have been overwhelmed with the support we have received and recognition would only make it easier to increase the benefits to all those who work so hard in the industry.'\n}}\nExternal links\n*[http://www.edinburghcomedyawards.com Official site]"
