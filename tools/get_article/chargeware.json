It is often associated with Internet pornography, where third-party apps infect a user's device and covertly enroll them in expensive subscription services.\nChargeware frequently employs deceptive tactics, such as:\n* Hidden Fees: Users unknowingly consent to recurring charges when installing or using the app.\n* Aggressive Subscription Models: The malware may subscribe users to premium services without a clear opt-out mechanism.\n* Difficult Unsubscription Processes: The apps often make it intentionally difficult for users to cancel subscriptions.\n* Exploit of Carrier Billing: Many chargeware applications take advantage of mobile carrier billing systems to levy charges directly on phone bills.\nPrevalence and impact\nChargeware infections have been widely reported in various countries. In 2013, hundreds of thousands of users in France and the UK were affected, with many cases leading to further malware infections. Other countries, such as Spain, saw chargeware infections at rates comparable to adware, while Japan reported the lowest incidence of such malware.\nThe widespread use of mobile devices has made chargeware an attractive tool for cybercriminals, who continue to refine their tactics to evade detection. Hackers now focus on exploiting loopholes in mobile operating systems and country-specific billing regulations to maximize profits while minimizing the risk of legal repercussions.\nSee also\n* Adware\n* Ransomware\n* Mobile security\n* Internet fraud\nReferences"
