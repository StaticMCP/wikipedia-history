He played professionally from 1908 to 1920, including two seasons with the Montreal Canadiens, including the 1916 Stanley Cup champions. McNamara is the younger brother of Harold and George, who also played professionally.\nPlaying career\nBorn in Randolph, Ontario, Howard moved to Sault Ste. Marie when he was 12 years old.  Along with George, he joined the Halifax Crescents in the Maritime Professional Hockey League in 1911–12, thus forming the \"Dynamite Twins\".  The pair were unusually large for players of that era and formed a formidable defensive pair.  Howard moved on to become captain of the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey Association when they won their first Stanley Cup in 1916. McNamara played in an exhibition series in 1912–13 with the Toronto Tecumsehs.\nPersonal life\nBoth Howard and his brother George served in World War I. George rose in the ranks from lieutenant to major.  After returning from Europe, George and Howard founded the McNamara Construction Company and developed it into a prosperous firm.\nHoward McNamara died of a heart seizure on his yacht \"Brigadier\" during a fishing trip near Deseronto, Ontario.\nCareer statistics\nRegular season and playoffs\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"|\n! rowspan=\"100\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"|\n! colspan=\"5\"|Regular season\n! rowspan=\"100\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"|\n! colspan=\"5\"|Playoffs\n|- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n!
