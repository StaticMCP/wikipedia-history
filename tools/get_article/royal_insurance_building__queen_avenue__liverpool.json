It was built as the head office of the Royal Insurance Company and was used until they moved to a building on New John Street in 1903.\nArchitecture\nThe building was designed by Samuel Rowland in the Neoclassical style and completed in 1839. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with five bays facing onto Queen Avenue; the central section of three bays formed a tetrastyle portico with fluted Doric order columns supporting an entablature. There were Ionic order columns spanning the first and second floors which supported a frieze and a pediment.\nSee also\n*Grade II* listed buildings in Merseyside\n*Architecture of Liverpool\nReferences"
