With this document, signed by 59 delegates, settlers in Mexican Texas officially declared independence from Mexico and created the Republic of Texas.\nIt is not, however, an official state holiday whereby offices are closed, but instead a \"partial staffing holiday\": state offices are required to be open on that day but with reduced staffing.\nBackground\nTexas Independence day is a celebration of the adoption of the Texas Declaration of Independence. 59 Delegates signed the document in Washington on the Brazos, which is now referred to as the “birthplace of Texas,” and it made Mexican Texas into the Republic of Texas free from Mexican political influence. The Texas Declaration of Independence was based largely on the ideas of self government and natural rights from the American Declaration of Independence as well as the ideas of John Locke and other enlightenment figures.\nThe Declaration was in response to the Mexican Government and was issued during the Texas revolution.\nThe Convention President, Richard Ellis, appointed a committee to draft a declaration of Independence, and the committee chairman, George Childress, is credited with the authorship of the Texas Declaration of Independence with some help from the other committee members.\nThe day after the committee was created the Declaration was given to the convention to sign and over the following days 59 delegates for each of the settlements came to vote on the Declaration, and it was unanimously approved.\nCustoms\nToday, Texas Independence Day is celebrated on March second every year and it honors the adoption of the Texas Declaration of Independence passed in 1836 by a convention of settlers in the Texan area and it includes many forms of entertainment.
