(end of 927 A.H.). The Samma dynasty of Sindh reached a critical juncture as Jam Salahuddin II, supported by Gujarati troops, Sodhas, Jareja Sammas, Sahta Sammas, and Khangars launched a campaign against Jam Feroz. The conquest of Samanagar secured Jam Salahuddin's dominance, with Jam Feroz's reliance on Arghun support further diminishing his credibility among Sindhis.\nBackground\nIn January–February 1521, Shah Beg Arghun moved his camp from Samanagar. Following defeat at the Battle of Fatehpur (1519), Jam Feroz came to submit, and his submission was accepted. Sindh was divided: the southern part, south of Laki, was given to Jam Feroz as Shah Beg Arghun's governor and protégé, while Northern Sindh's two sarkars Bukkur and Sehwan were annexed and placed under Shah Beg's direct control. As a protégé, Feroz agreed to share part of the land revenue with Shah Beg Arghun. This subservience led to Feroz losing respect and prestige among his people. After spending three days at Taltí, Shah Beg Arghun returned to Shál and Siwí, while Jam Feroz resumed his rule over Samanagar. However, in November 1521 A.D. (end of 927 A.H.), Jam Salahuddin, took advantage of the weakening situation in Sindh and invaded Samanagar with a large army.\nConquest\nThe Jareja Samma chief Khengar occupied Rahimki Bazar and Virawah, two critical border posts in southern Sindh. This action was a direct response to Jam Feroz II's earlier support for 'Rawal, Khengar's adversary in Cutch. The strategic occupation was intended to block any assistance from Jam Rawal to Jam Feroz II. Along with this assistance he also provided Cutchi Troops.\nIn Samanagar, faced with Salahuddin's formidable forces, Jam Feroz II and his regent, Kasim Kabaka Arghun, abandoned their position and fled to Sivistan (Siwi). Jam Salahuddin's army subsequently clashed with Daulatshah and the Nargahi Mongol tribes, who had been recruited by Jam Feroz II to bolster his defence. The battle decisively favoured Salahuddin, who emerged victorious and consolidated his control over lower Sindh.\nFollowing his victory, Salahuddin annexed the Sarkars previously under Feroz II’s control, which included:\n*Chachkan Sarkar (11 Mahals): Chachkan, Jun, Fateh Bagh\n*Nasarpur Sarkar (7 Mahals): Nasarpur, Amarkot, Hala Kandi, Samma-vali\n*Chakar Hala Sarkar (8 Mahals): Chakar Hala, Ghazipur\n*Thatta Sarkar (18 Mahals): Thatta, Lahari Bandar, Bathoro, Bahrampur, Sakro\nAftermath\nThis action of Jam Salahuddin II led to the Battle of Chelhar, where he and his son Jam Haibat Khan were martyred.\nReferences"
