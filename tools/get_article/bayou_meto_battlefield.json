It is the location of the August 27, 1863, Battle of Bayou Meto, in which Confederate forces successfully prevented Union forces from crossing the Bayou Meto River during their advance to capture Little Rock.\nDescription and administrative history\nThe battlefield is located on both sides of the river, on either side of Arkansas Highway 161, whose bridge is the location of the 1863 Reed's Bridge. A portion of the battlefield is preserved as Reed's Bridge Battlefield Heritage Park. The entire battlefield is the best-preserved of the three major battle sites of the Union advance on Little Rock.  A  area covering the core of the battlefield was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.\nSee also\n* Bayou Fourche Battlefield\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Pulaski County, Arkansas\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* [https://www.battlefields.org/visit/heritage-sites/reeds-bridge-battlefield Reed's Bridge Battlefield] at American Battlefield Trust"
