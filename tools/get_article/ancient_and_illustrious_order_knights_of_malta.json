It descended from Scottish Orangeism.\nHistory\nThe order was introduced to the United States in 1870, when it received a charter from the Scottish Commandery in Scotland. Whether it had an authentic linkage to the Knights Hospitaller of the Crusades is questionable. The order is not to be confused with the degree of Knight of Malta (Order of Malta) associated with the Masonic Knights Templar. The order reorganized itself under an “Imperial Charter”  in 1889.\nThe order described it in its literature as \"a band of Protestant Christian men, bound together by secret ties, for the promotion of Protestant Christianity, Good Fellowship, Mutual Aid, Ritualistic Instruction, and Preservation of a Sound Christian Moral Fiber, which will preserve for us and for our children the Blessings of our North American Way of Life!\" It also claimed \"to defend the Protestant faith against all foes whatsoever; to ever defend civil and religious liberty; to exercise the fullest toleration and charity toward all men; to practice benevolence; and to maintain a universal Protestant fraternity.\"\nCritics of the order claimed it was strongly anti-Catholic. It apparently excluded both Catholics and Protestants married to Catholics from membership. Other membership requirements included being a white male, at least eighteen years old, a \"True Protestant in Religion,\" proficient in English, law-abiding, and \"competent to pursue some useful and lawful occupation.\" Applicants underwent an investigation, proposed by a member with at least two years of acquaintance.\nIt had 75,000 members in 1923. In the late 1960s there were 10,000 members, but by 1979 the membership had declined to 2,000. The order maintained the Malta Home in Granville, Pennsylvania, providing housing for its aged members. The building was demolished in 2015.\nOrganization and rituals\nThe national organization, which met annually, was called the \"Supreme Grand Commandery.\" State structures were known as \"Grand Commanderies,\" and local gatherings were referred to as \"Commanderies.\" In 1980, there were thirty-six commanderies in Canada, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and the New England states, with headquarters located in Reading, Pennsylvania. The headquarters was previously located at 1345 Arch Street in Philadelphia.\nKOM acknowledged twelve degrees, with a member achieving full-fledged status after the second degree. The order's insignia was an eight-cornered Maltese cross with an eagle, featuring the Latin phrase \"IN HOC SIGNO VINCES.\"\nThe order published the booklet What Does the Ancient and Illustrious Order Knights of Malta Have to Offer Christian Men Today? and the monthly periodical Malta Bulletin.\nA female auxiliary organization Ladies of Malta was established in 1896. It merged with the Daughters of Malta and was renamed Dames of Malta in 1902. Its governing body was known as \"Zenodacia\" and the local units \"Sisterhoods\". In 1924 they had a membership of 28,000.\nSee also\n*Royal Black Institution\n*Golden age of fraternalism\n*History of Pennsylvania\nNotes and references\nExternal links\n*[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100571219 Digitalized issues of the Malta Bulletin from 1910 to 1925 available at Hathitrust.]\n*[https://srmmlonlineexhibitions.omeka.net/exhibits/show/the-secret-society-lantern--ma/masonic-slides/knights-of-malta Gallery of lantern slides used in the Knights of Malta rituals.
