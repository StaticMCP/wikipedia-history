He also played for Wales's under 21s. After his retirement, he has since been coaching Carlisle United and Bolton Wanderers goalkeepers. He is coaching Liverpool's U-18 goalkeepers as of the 2012–13 season.\nPlaying career\nEdwards started his career as a reserve goalkeeper at Leeds United, playing one first team match, a Full Members' Cup game against Barnsley. He also went on loan to Huddersfield Town, but failed to play a first team match.\nOn 3 September 1991 Edwards joined Stockport County for £5,000, where he played over 200 games for the Cheshire club, but first team opportunities were restricted due to the team's elevated position in 1996–97.\nOn 3 November 1997 Edwards joined Rochdale, where he found himself a fans' favourite, and played his part in one of the best defensive records in Division 3. In the pre-season of the 2001–02 season, Edwards was named the captain of Rochdale, but injury made him miss the majority of the season due to injury. In the latter seasons, injuries and the impressive performances of Matthew Gilks forced Edwards out of the first team picture at Spotland. In total, he played 279 League and Cup games at Rochdale.\nEdwards then had two contracts offered to him, by Rochdale and Bury, and on 2 July 2005, he joined Bury on a one-year contract, with the guarantee of first-team football as well as a slightly higher wage. He played 24 League games for the Mancunian Gigg Lane club, before an injury ended his season, and he decided to retire at the end of season.\nCoaching career\nIn summer 2006 Edwards joined new Carlisle United manager Neil McDonald's backroom team as goalkeeping coach, but left to Bolton Wanderers to become their assistant goalkeeping coach to Fred Barber.\nIn August 2009 he appeared in a Bolton Legends game for long serving goalkeeper Jussi Jääskeläinen in what was a warm up event prior to the main game against Hibernian.\nSources\n*\n*\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070423043809/http://www.leedsfans.org.uk/leeds/players/446.html Leeds United fans profile]\n*[http://www.football.co.uk/bury/players/neil_edwards_1127.shtml football.co.uk profile]"
