It is the third entry in the Battleground series.\nGameplay\nThe game features the Battle of Waterloo which was the final defeat for Napoleon Bonaparte and his French Empire.\nReception\n| NGen =\n| rev2 = Computer Games Strategy Plus\n| rev2Score =\n| rev5 = PC Games\n| rev5Score= B+\n}}\nTerry Coleman of Computer Gaming World reported in August 1996 that \"BG: Waterloo had, according to Empire (the distributor for Talonsoft in the US), the highest 'buy-in' at retail chains of any historical wargame they've released this year.\"\nA Next Generation critic said Battleground 3: Waterloo \"is as good as PC war games get, featuring everything players could want in a turn-based bloodbath: historical accuracy, pleasing graphics, an easy-to-use interface, and strategic subtleties.\" He remarked that while the game only covers one battle, it has considerable breadth due to its many options, including the ability to play either a historically accurate campaign or a number of \"what if\" scenarios. He scored it four out of five stars.\nThe four Battleground games of 1996—Bulge-Ardennes, Shiloh, Antietam and Waterloo—collectively won Computer Games Strategy Pluss wargame of the year award for that year. Waterloo was a finalist for Computer Gaming Worlds 1996 \"Wargame of the Year\" award, which ultimately went to Battleground 4: Shiloh. Waterloo was a runner-up for Computer Game Entertainments 1996 \"Best War Game\" prize, which ultimately went to Tigers on the Prowl 2. The magazine's editors called both games \"top-notch\".\nIn 1996, Computer Gaming World named Waterloo the 115th best game ever. The editors wrote, \"The grand age of warfare comes to life with colorful uniforms, delightful landscapes, and above-average opponent AI in this recent release.\" The magazine's wargame columnist Terry Coleman named it his pick for the 10th-best computer wargame released by late 1996.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/data/196720.html GameFAQs]"
