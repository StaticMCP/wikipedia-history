It is located in Masuria. It lies approximately  north of Banie Mazurskie,  west of Gołdap, and  north-east of the regional capital Olsztyn.\nPolish, Lithuanian and German-language services were held in the church, as of the 18th century. The first three pastors of the local parish were from the Polish noble family of Wierciński, all appointed in the 16th century.\nThere are two cemeteries—one German, one Russian—from World War I located in the town.\nReferences"
