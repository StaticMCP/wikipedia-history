It occupied a house in the town, which is now the Kingsbridge Cookworthy Museum. In 1931 the school moved to a new site (though the old school was still used for dinners) and in 1944 admitted girls for the first time. In 1964 the school was merged with a secondary modern school to become a comprehensive foundation school administered by Devon County Council, and then converted to academy status on 1 January 2011. However the school continues to coordinate with Devon County Council for admissions.\nKingsbridge Community College offers GCSEs and BTECs as programmes of study for pupils, while students in the sixth form have the option to study from a range of A Levels, NVQs and further BTECs.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.kingsbridgecollege.org.uk/ Kingsbridge Community College official website]"
