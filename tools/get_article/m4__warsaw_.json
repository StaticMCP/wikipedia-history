It will have a length of approximately  and will consist of 23 stations, linking Wilanów with Tarchomin. It will also include a new metro depot, STP Polfa.\nThe line will be an important element of the metro network and the overall transport system in Warsaw. According to initial findings, it is expected to be used by up to 30,000 people per hour. It will connect the districts of Białołęka, Bielany, Żoliborz, Śródmieście, Wola, Ochota, Włochy, Mokotów, and Wilanów, as well as enable interchange to M1, M2, M3, and M5 metro lines and the main public transport lines: trams, buses, and railways.\nUpon its completion, M4 is planned to be the longest line in the Warsaw Metro system.\nHistory\nThe line was initially announced in February 2023 by the mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski, in the city's plan to construct five metro lines by 2050.\nOn March 14, 2024, Warsaw City Council allocated 56 million PLN for pre-design works for the M4 line. On March 19, a tender for the works was issued. In September 2024 the contract for the pre-design works was signed, with the works expected to be finished by 2027.\nConstruction of the M4 line is expected to take place at the same time as the M3 line, starting somewhere in the 2030s.\nStations\nThe initial station plan for the line was shared on the Warsaw Metro website:\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%;\"\n!Code\n!Name\n|-\n|G01\n|Wilanów\n|-\n|G02\n|Sobieskiego\n|-\n|G03\n|Patkowskiego\n|-\n|G04\n|Dolina Służewiecka\n|-\n|G05\n|Wilanowska\n|-\n|G06\n|Smoluchowskiego\n|-\n|G07\n|Rondo Unii Europejskiej\n|-\n|G08\n|Służewiec\n|-\n|G09\n|Żwirki i Wigury\n|-\n|G10\n|Wiślicka\n|-\n|G11\n|Bitwy Warszawskiej 1920\n|-\n|G12\n|Plac Narutowicza\n|-\n|G13\n|Plac Zawiszy\n|-\n|G14\n|Rondo Daszyńskiego\n|-\n|G15\n|Okopowa\n|-\n|G16\n|Cmentarz Żydowski\n|-\n|G17\n|Rondo Radosława\n|-\n|G18\n|Rydygiera\n|-\n|G19\n|Marymont\n|-\n|G20\n|Ruda\n|-\n|G21\n|Płochocińska\n|-\n|G22\n|Obrazkowa\n|-\n|G23\n|Myśliborska\n|-\n|\n|STP Polfa\n|}\nReferences"
