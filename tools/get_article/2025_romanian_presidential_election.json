Nicușor Dan and George Simion were the two candidates who advanced to the second round, in which the former was victorious. Dan's term as the sixth president of Romania began on 26 May.\nThe election was scheduled in January 2025 following the annulment of the 2024 presidential election citing alleged Russian meddling in favour of first-round winner Călin Georgescu. The campaign was characterised by political instability and a series of protests against the annulment. On 7 March, Georgescu was barred from running, pending several criminal investigations, with the leader of the AUR party Simion announcing his candidacy in Georgescu's place.\nSimion, who won 40.96% of the vote in the first round, faced Dan, who garnered 20.99% of the vote, in the second round that was held on 18 May 2025. Dan won with 53.6% against Simion's 46.4%.\nOn 20 May, having previously conceded the election and congratulated Dan on his victory, Simion stated that he had formally filed a contest of the results with the Romanian Constitutional Court, alleging mass voter fraud. Simion's request for the annulment of the election was rejected by the Court two days later, and Dan's presidency began on 26 May.\nBackground\nPrevious election annulled\nOn 6 December 2024, the 2024 presidential election, was annulled by the Constitutional Court of Romania, 48 hours before the second round was to be held, citing alleged Russian intervention on behalf of independent candidate, Călin Georgescu, who took a shock lead in the first round with 23%. CSAT said the campaign was \"identical\" to the online campaign launched by Russia before its invasion of Ukraine. On 20 December, an investigation was published showing that PNL had seemingly paid for one of the TikTok campaigns. PNL interim president Ilie Bolojan had stated however that the campaign was altered illegally to favor Georgescu, yet had not blamed the company they worked with for the alteration.\nSecond Ciolacu cabinet\nAfter the parliamentary election, the second Ciolacu cabinet was formed as a minority coalition between PSD, PNL, UDMR and with confidence and supply from minority parties on 23 December 2024. Furthermore, Ilie Bolojan became President of the Senate of Romania and Ciprian-Constantin Șerban became the President of the Chamber of Deputies of Romania. The cabinet passed with a seven-vote majority and became official. Opposition leaders (most prominently George Simion and POT Leader Anamaria Gavrilă) called the cabinet illegitimate and for the resignation of incumbent president Klaus Iohannis.\nPresident Iohannis' resignation and political crisis\nFollowing the annulment of the 2024 presidential election in December, Iohannis was allowed to stay on as president by the Constitutional Court until his successor could be sworn in. However, on 10 February, following an attempt by members of parliament to impeach him, Iohannis announced that he would resign on 12 February. Senate president Ilie Bolojan assumed the role of acting president until the elections.\nGeorgescu barring and Simion candidacy\nto file his candidacy on 7 March. It was rejected two days later]]\nOn 26 February 2025, Georgescu was stopped by police in traffic, while allegedly on his way to register for the election. He was charged with six offenses, including incitement to actions against the constitutional order, and support of fascist groups. Preemptive measures have been imposed, including judiciary control, and a 60-day ban on posting xenophobic and antisemitic materials to social networks (although such actions are already illegal in Romania). The police claimed to have found ten million U.S. dollars buried inside his bodyguard's house along with plane tickets to Moscow. On 7 March, Georgescu filed his candidacy to the Central Electoral Bureau, being rejected two days later which led to new protests. Consequently, George Simion arrived to the Central Electoral Bureau on 14 March accompanied by former Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki to file his candidacy after collecting 604,000 signatures, above the minimum requirement of 200,000. The CEB approved his candidacy on the following day, which was also the deadline for candidates to register, with Simion stating \"We passed the BEC, now let's see if we pass the CCR and return to democracy\". The CCR validated his candidacy one day later as well as the ones of Nicușor Dan and Victor Ponta.\nElection date\n]]\nThe date of the first round had initially been publicly speculated by news media as 23 March 2025, with the runoff two weeks later (6 April 2025). In early January, these dates became obsolete, as the law for electing the president of Romania requires a minimum of 75 days between the election day and the day the election is called. On 8 January, the coalition fixed the dates of the election. The first round was scheduled to be held on 4 May 2025 with the second round two weeks later (18 May 2025).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Date\n!Event\n|-\n| 8 January\n| The government fixed the date for the election (first round on 4 May 2025)\n|-\n| 20 February\n| The Central Electoral Bureau (BEC) is constituted (judges from the High Court of Cassation and Justice drawn, and representatives of the Permanent Electoral Authority)\n|-\n| 21 February\n| The BEC is finalised (representatives form the parliamentary parties)\n|-\n| 23 February\n| Deadline for registration of electoral alliances at BEC\n|-\n| 15 March\n| Deadline for candidates to register, 23:59:59 (at BEC)\n|-\n| 17 March\n| Deadline for BEC to validate or reject candidates registered on 15 March (48 hours after registering)\n|-\n| 19 March\n| Deadline to file complaints at CCR against BEC decision (of validation or rejection of a candidacy) (24 hours after BEC ruling)\n|-\n| 20 March\n| Definitive candidacies announced\n|-\n| 22 March\n| BEC determines the order of the candidates on the ballot paper (lottery)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 4 April\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | The start of the electoral campaign (at 7:00)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 2 May\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | The end of the electoral campaign (at 22:00)Voting at polling stations abroad begins at 7:00&nbsp;a.m. local time\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 4 May\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | Voting in Romania begins at 7:00&nbsp;a.m.\n|}\nCandidates\nThe Central Electoral Bureau (BEC) was constituted on 21 February 2025. The deadline for registering electoral alliances at the BEC was on 23 February 2025. By that deadline, only one electoral alliance was registered, between the governing PSD, PNL, and UDMR, called the Romania Forward Electoral Alliance (; A.Ro for short).\nPersons who wished to run for the office could begin gathering the support signatures (a minimum of 200,000) after 23 February. The deadline for registering the candidacy at the BEC was 15 March 2025, at 23:59:59. All candidatures validated by the BEC had to pass the scrutiny of the Constitutional Court of Romania. On 19 March, Gavrilă withdrew her candidacy for president, endorsing Simion. A final list of all 11 candidates was released on the following day. On 22 March, a random draw took place, placing Simion on the first position on the ballot and Nicușor Dan on the last.\nAdvanced to runoff\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Name\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Campaign and affiliation\n!Public office experience\n!Party and endorsements\n!Candidacy related dates\n|-\n|George Simion\n|Democrație)}}([https://georgesimion.ro/ website])\n|Deputy(2020–present)\n|Affiliation: AUREndorsed by: POT\n| BEC validation: 15 March 2025\n|-\n|Nicușor Dan\n|România Onestă)}}([https://nicusordan.ro/ website])\n|General Mayor of Bucharest (2020–present)Deputy (2016–2020)Bucharest General Councilor (2016)\n|Affiliation: noneEndorsed by: DREPT, PMP, FD, REPER, RîA, PV, USR, SENS, RMDSZ, and EMSZ\n|}}}}}}}}}}BEC registration: BEC validation: 9 March 2025BEC validation upheld by Constitutional Court:\n|}\nOther registered candidates in ballot order\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Name\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Campaign and affiliation\n!Public office experience\n!Party and endorsements\n!Candidacy related dates\n|-\n|Crin Antonescu\n|România, înainte!)}}([https://crinantonescu.ro website])\n|Acting president of Romania (2012)President of the Senate (2012–2014)Minister of Youth and Sport (1997–2000)Senator (2008–2016)Deputy (1992–2008)\n|Affiliation: A.RoEndorsed by: Ethnic minority parties\n|}}}}Validated as PNL candidate: Validated as UDMR candidate: Validated as PSD candidate: BEC registration: BEC validation: 11 March 2025BEC validation upheld by Constitutional Court:\n|-\n|Elena Lasconi\n|Am curaj să fac dreptate!)}}([https://elenalasconi.ro/ website])\n|Mayor of Campulung (2024–present)\n|Affiliation: USR\n|}}: BEC validation: 15 March 2025}}\n|-\n|Cristian Terheș\n|Credincios națiunii române)}}\n|MEP (2019–present)\n|Affiliation: PNCR\n| BEC validation: 15 March 2025\n|-\n|Lavinia Șandru\n|România Reală)}}\n|Deputy (2004–2008)\n|Affiliation: PUSL\n| BEC validation: 15 March 2025\n|-\n|Victor Ponta\n|România pe primul loc!)}} ([https://victorponta.ro/ website])\n|Prime Minister (2012–2015)Deputy (2004–2020, 2024–present)Minister of Parliamentary Relations (2008–2009)\n|Affiliation: noneEndorsed by: PRR, PER, PRO, RoSAT, PRM, and PPMP\n|}}}}}}}} BEC validation: 14 March 2025\n|-\n|\n|No campaign information\n|No previous public office\n|Affiliation: PNR\n|\n|-\n|\n|Competență.

There were no major incidents reported by observers during voting hours or the counting process. Statements of preliminary conclusions from the Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE mention that \"[t]he voting process was evaluated positively, with observers finding the process to be conducted in an efficient, transparent, and professional manner\", while also noting the presence of online disinformation and media bias during the campaign. FEC member Trey Trainor praised the election process he observed, stating that: \"Every vote was cast using a paper ballot, and the entire ballot-counting process was not only done in the presence of poll watchers from every political party but also recorded on video to guarantee transparency. There were no delays in reporting results. In fact, the entire country completed its electoral count within hours of polls closing — a testament to both the simplicity and the integrity of the process.\"\nResults\n|votes1=3862761\n|votes1_2=5339053\n|cand2=Nicușor Dan\n|color2=#BAE002\n|party2=Independent\n|votes2=1979767\n|votes2_2=6168642\n|cand3=Crin Antonescu\n|party3=Romania Forward Electoral Alliance\n|votes3=1892930\n|rowspan=9|votes3_2=\n|cand4=Victor Ponta\n|party4=Independent\n|votes4=1230164\n|color4=#E02043\n|cand5=Elena Lasconi\n|colour5=\n|party5=Save Romania Union\n|votes5=252721\n|cand6=Lavinia Șandru\n|party6=Social Liberal Humanist Party\n|votes6=60682\n|cand7=Daniel Funeriu\n|party7=Independent\n|votes7=49604\n|cand8=Cristian Terheș\n|party8=Romanian National Conservative Party\n|votes8=36445\n|cand9=\n|party9=New Romania Party\n|votes9=25994\n|cand10=\n|party10=Independent\n|votes10=22020\n|cand11=\n|party11=National Action League Party\n|votes11=17186\n|invalid=141466\n|invalid2=134171\n|electorate=17988031\n|turnout=53.21\n|electorate2=17988218\n|source= Permanent Electoral Authority\n}}\n}}\n|#BAE002|53.60}}\n||46.40}}\n}}\n||40.96}}\n|#BAE002|20.99}}\n||20.07}}\n|#E02043|13.04}}\n||2.68}}\n}}\nFirst round\nBy county\n{| class=\"wikitable nowrap sortable mw-datatable\" style=\"text-align:right; font-size:95%; line-height:20px\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | Results by county\n|-\n! width=\"200\" rowspan=\"3\"| County\n! width=\"110\" colspan=\"2\"| George Simion\n! width=\"110\" colspan=\"2\"| Nicușor Dan\n! width=\"110\" colspan=\"2\"| Crin Antonescu\n! width=\"110\" colspan=\"2\"| Victor Ponta\n! width=\"110\" colspan=\"2\"| Elena Lasconi\n! width=\"110\" colspan=\"2\"| Lavinia Șandru\n! width=\"110\" colspan=\"2\"| Daniel Funeriu\n! width=\"110\" colspan=\"2\"| Cristian Terheș\n! width=\"110\" colspan=\"2\"|\n! width=\"110\" colspan=\"2\"|\n! width=\"110\" colspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"  style=\"background:;\"|\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#BAE002;\"|\n! colspan=\"2\"  style=\"background:;\"|\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#E02043;\"|\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:;\"|\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:;\"|\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"|\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:;\"|\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:;\"|\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"|\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:;\"|\n|-\n!

of prime minister, which resulted in the collapse of the coalition. However, he continued to serve as the PSD leader.\nLasconi got significantly fewer votes than in the 2024 elections, scoring only 2.68% of the vote. Subsequently, the next day after the elections, she announced she would step down as president of the Save Romania Union.\nSimion's victory in the first round also had significant economic implications, with the Bucharest Stock Exchange experiencing substantial losses and the National Bank of Romania investing over 2 billion euros in stabilising the leu and preventing depreciation. Former Romanian president Traian Băsescu criticised the Romanian diaspora for Simion's victory among its voters. He called the attitude of the majority of the diaspora \"dishonest\", stating that: \"They live in the West and say: come on, you who live at home, come on, go to daddy Putin, go to Putin!\". During the campaign, AUR appointed lawyer Silvia Uscov head of its legal team to help in possibly challenging the election results.\nSimion was congratulated on his first-round win by Mateusz Morawiecki, former Polish prime minister and current president of the European Conservatives and Reformists, Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini and French MEP Marion Maréchal.\nAnalysis\nAfter Simion's first-round victory, Moldovan analyst Ion Tăbîrță predicted that, if Simion were to prevail in the second round, Moldova-Romania relations would suffer. Tăbîrță claimed that, were Simion to win, Moldova could lose Romania's support in international relations, including in its path toward European integration. He added that Romania would lose its role as Moldova's \"defender\" in the eyes of the European Union, as it would no longer have the same image within the bloc. According to another Moldovan analyst, Mihaela Sirețanu, relations between the two countries would become tense: Simion is banned from entering Moldova until 2028. Both Tăbîrță and Sirețanu agreed that Dan's victory would be more favourable for Moldova and its relationship with Romania.\nBBC's Central Europe Correspondent Nick Thorpe reported that many voters who backed Georgescu in the annulled election switched their allegiance to Simion, and that the two voted together. He predicted that, in the second round, Simion would also attract voters who backed fourth-placed former Prime Minister Victor Ponta, a retired Social Democrat who adopted a \"Romania First\" campaign.\nSecond round\nOn the day of the second round, Andrei Țărnea, spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Romania, denounced Russian interference during the election. He stated that a viral fake news campaign on Telegram and other social media was seeking to influence the electoral process, something which was expected as he stated, with the Romanian authorities having proved these news false according to him. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated this situation was alarming because \"it appears to have been created with the aim of undermining citizens' confidence in democratic institutions and processes\". Furthermore, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Romania stated that a clip had been distributed on TikTok claiming that French troops in Romania, stationed at NATO's Cincu Training Center, were secretly wearing Romanian Gendarmerie uniforms to intervene on Romania's internal affairs, which the ministry stated was false and \"pure disinformation\".\nWith a final voter turnout of 64.72% (which translates to 11,641,544 votes), the run-off winner was certified on 18 May by the Central Electoral Bureau to be Dan, with 6,168,642 votes.\nSimion had prematurely declared victory on Facebook with a post reading: \"I won!!! I am the new President of Romania and I am giving back the power to the Romanians!\" He later conceded the election, stating \"I would like to congratulate my opponent, Nicușor Dan. He won the election, it was the will of the Romanian people\". Two days later, Simion demanded the annulment of the election, citing \"external influence by state and non-state actors\" as grounds for annulment, drawing parallels to the court's previous annulment of the December 2024 election over alleged Russian interference, referring to the election as a \"farce\".\nTelegram founder Pavel Durov claimed meanwhile on May 18 that he had been pressured in France in the spring of 2025 to have Telegram remove certain \"conservative\" messages during the May 2025 presidential election.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in France formally denied this in a statement. Following this denial, Durov specifically accused Nicolas Lerner, Director General of External Security (DGSE), of having asked him to carry out this censorship. He didn't provide any proof for either of these accusations.\nThe AUR party also claimed, in a statement published on May 26, 2025, that Nicolas Lerner had \"discreetly\" traveled to Romania before the second round of elections. These fake news were denied by the Romanian Foreign Intelligence Service, calling them \"attempts at manipulation and disinformation\", and by French DGSE. On May 22, the Constitutional Court rejected Simion's request and upheld the initial results, thus validating Dan's election. Dan was sworn in on 26 May in front of the Romanian Parliament.\nOn 21 May, seven out of the 21 deputies and five out of the seven senators of the right-wing populist Party of Young People left the party, bringing the parliamentary group in the Senate below the minimum threshold of members and causing its dissolution.\nInternational reactions\nSeveral leaders from across Europe congratulated Dan on his election; they included French president Emmanuel Macron, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Moldovan president Maia Sandu, Polish prime minister Donald Tusk, and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen.\nRussian presidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the election results \"strange, to say the least\", and said Dan had won \"in the absence of the favorite\", referring to Georgescu. The French intelligence agency DGSE denied claims by George Simion and Telegram founder Pavel Durov that it had interfered with the election.\nInstitutions\nRoberta Metsola visiting Romania and meeting with President Dan|250px]]\n* : President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola spoke with Dan to congratulate him on his election. She noted that after the announcement of the results, it was deeply moving to see EU flags waved across Romania. Metsola emphasized that the Romanian people could trust and rely on Europe, and she announced that she would visit Romania later that week to deliver this message.\n* : Secretary General of NATO Mark Rutte congratulated Dan in a phone call, stressing that both sides shared the important responsibility of ensuring collective security. He underlined that a strong NATO would promote regional stability and expressed his expectation of close cooperation with Dan, particularly at the upcoming NATO Summit in The Hague.\nAnalysis\nAnalysts attributed Dan's unexpected victory in the second round to higher voter turnout. Urban voters, women, and ethnic minorities voted for Dan over Simion by large margins. Dan did particularly well among Romania's large population of ethnic Hungarians, who were wary of Simion's nationalist rhetoric despite Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán's apparent endorsement of Simion in the second round. Orbán's endorsement was poorly received in both Hungary and the diaspora. The New York Times columnist Andrew Higgins also opined that Dan's victory indicated that voters \"wanted a middle path between bitterly polarized political camps,\" while the Atlantic Council argued that Dan benefited from not being associated with the ruling government, and that \"Romanians have voted for Europe and democracy, not nationalism, but they also seem to want change.\" Political analyst and AUR senate leader Petrișor Peiu attributed the result to Dan's strong mobilisation efforts as well as \"less inspired\" decisions by AUR.\nSee also\n* 2024–2025 Romanian election annulment protests\n* 2025 elections in the European Union\nNotes\nReferences"
