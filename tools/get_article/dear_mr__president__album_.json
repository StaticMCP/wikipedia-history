      "text": "# Dear Mr. President (album)\n\nDear Mr. President is a 1942 album by the Almanac Singers.\nHistory\nAfter the Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor, in  February 1942 the Almanacs went into the studio to record a set of songs supporting the American war effort.  This was partly because with American entrance into World War II all American unions adopted a no-strike pledge. Another contributing factor was that, after Hitler invaded the USSR in June 1941, Moscow had reversed its previous anti-intervention stance as expressed in the group's earlier album, Songs for John Doe. This lost the Almanacs a sizeable chunk of their working repertoire.\nTrack listing\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Dear Mr. President track listing\n!
