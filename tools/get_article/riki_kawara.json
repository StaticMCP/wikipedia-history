A native of Nanao, Ishikawa and graduate of Chuo University, he was elected for the first time in 1972. In 1987, he assumed the post of Director General of the Japan Defense Agency (and again in 1999 to 2000). He resigned a year later after taking responsibility for the Nadashio incident. Kichirō Tazawa replaced him in the post.\nHe was later appointed construction minister in the Hashimoto cabinet. He retired from politics in 2009. He died in Nanao, Ishikawa, in early January 2013 of pneumonia.\nReferences"
