It existed alongside the Vatya culture and Hatvan cultures and was eventually superseded by the latter. The main style of pottery was a one or two handed cup with a tall funnel neck that is made in a black burnished ware. The earliest phase of the culture is also known as the Makó culture.\nThe site\nNagyrév was located on the left bank of the Tisza which was at the western edge of a flood plain. Sand dunes and other mounds of earth indicated to archaeologists that burials were done in groups, sometimes with up to 6 or 7 buried in one area.\nFindings\nMost burials were of cremated remains and the ashes would either be spread on the ground of the site or occasionally placed in urns. Most graves contained up to fourteen pottery pieces that held food, water and other possessions for the journey to the after life.\nPottery vessels were decorated with geometric designs with a symbolic meaning. Some pots with diamond, square or arm like looking shapes were painted around the circumference of the vessels. These burials suggest that families were buried together and even close friends to the family were buried near each other.\nGallery\nFile:Bronze age 2000-1200BC Nagyrev culture IMG 0995 09.JPG|Bronze necklace\nFile:Bronze age 2000-1200BC Nagyrev culture IMG 0995 12.JPG|Bronze ornaments\nFile:Bronze age 2000-1200BC Nagyrev culture IMG 0995 11.JPG|Bronze ornaments\nFile:Early bronze age hungary BHM IMG 0711.jpg|Bronze ornament\nFile:Middle bronze age hungary BHM IMG 0704.jpg|Bronze axe\nFile:Middle bronze age hungary BHM IMG 0706.jpg|Cups\nFile:Bronze age 2000-1200BC Nagyrev culture IMG 0995 04.JPG|Cups\nFile:Middle bronze age hungary BHM IMG 0708.jpg|Ceramic vessel\nFile:Bronze age 2600-2000BC Mako culture Buda IMG 0973.JPG\nFile:2008.09.26.Szolnok 043.jpg|Pottery\nFile:Bronze age 2000-1200BC Nagyrev culture IMG 0995 03.JPG|Ceramic vessel.\nFile:SAXTell.JPG|Százhalombatta-Földvár fortified settlement site, Hungary.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.ace.hu/gucsi/gucsi5.jpg Image of Nagyrev Pottery]\n*[https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Tiszaug-Kemenyteto-A-house-of-the-Nagyrev-culture-after-CSANYI-STANCZIK-1992_fig9_287683975 A house of the Nagyrév culture]\n*[https://www.peceliertektar.hu/ertekek_pdf/egyeb_doksik/bronzkor.pdf Bronzkor: Bronze Age artefacts from Hungary]\n*[http://www.ace.hu/curric/elte-archeometria/irodalom/Hungarian_archeology.pdf Hungarian archaeology at the turn of the Millennium, p.144]"
