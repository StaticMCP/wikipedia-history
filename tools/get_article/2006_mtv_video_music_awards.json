The show was hosted by Jack Black at Radio City Music Hall in New York City.\nThe 2006 Video Music Awards marked the first time viewers were able to vote for all performers' categories (Best Video; Best Male, Female, and Group Videos; and genre categories). Like previous years, the artistic categories (Best Direction, Best Cinematography, etc.) are still chosen by music industry professionals. The 2006 Awards also discontinued the major category Breakthrough Video.\nThe show was criticized by fans and viewers as being uninteresting or lacking substance. The award ceremony's ratings were down 28% from the 8 million viewers it averaged in 2005 and down 45% from the 10.3 million viewers it averaged in 2004.\nShakira and Red Hot Chili Peppers received the most nominations, with seven each. Followed by Madonna and Panic! at the Disco with 5 nominations. Avenged Sevenfold won Best New Artist and \"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\", by Panic! at the Disco, became the first video to win Video of the Year without winning a single other award since \"This Note's for You\" by Neil Young in 1989.\nBackground\nMTV announced on March 21 that the 2006 Video Music Awards would be held on August 31 at New York City's Radio City Music Hall, returning to the city after two consecutive ceremonies in Miami. Nominees were announced at a press conference held at Top of the Rock and hosted by Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg, Beyoncé, and Justin Timberlake on July 31. Jack Black was announced as host on August 10. The ceremony broadcast was preceded by Red Carpet on the Rock. Hosted by Kurt Loder and SuChin Pak with reports from John Norris, Sway, and Gideon Yago, the pre-show featured red carpet interviews and performances from Fergie and My Chemical Romance. It also marked Loder’s final hosting appearance at a VMA pre-show, having hosted each broadcast since 1990. The ceremony marked MTV's first attempt at integrating multi-platform content into the broadcast. Expanding the previous year’s use of MTV Overdrive for bonus material, MTV Overdrive simultaneously aired a VMA Live: Backstage Uncensored channel, providing live footage of presenters and performers in the backstage areas, which was heavily promoted during the linear broadcast. For the first time, the live broadcast expanded beyond MTV to include a live simulcast on MTV2 with commentary from the MTV2 VJs and the first high-definition simulcast on MHD.\nPerformances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Artist(s)\n!Song(s)\n|-\n! colspan=2|Pre-show\n|-\n| Fergie\n| \"London Bridge\"\n|-\n| My Chemical Romance\n| \"Welcome to the Black Parade\"\n|-\n! colspan=2|Main show\n|-\n| Justin Timberlake\n| \"My Love\"  \"SexyBack\" (featuring Timbaland)\n|-\n| Shakira  Wyclef Jean\n| \"Hips Don't Lie\"\n|-\n| Ludacris  Pharrell  Pussycat Dolls\n| \"Money Maker\"\n|-\n| OK Go\n| \"Here It Goes Again\"\n|-\n| The All-American Rejects\n| \"Move Along\"\n|-\n| Beyoncé\n| \"Ring the Alarm\"\n|-\n| T.I.
