Its first, and so far only, eruption occurred in January 2010.\nMorphology\nTor Zawar is a group of closely spaced fissure vents on a non-volcanic mountain in a tectonically active region between the Bibai and Gogai thrust faults (Global Volcanism Program), which is in the Ziarat region near the village of Wham.\n2010 eruption\nAn eruption in the region on January 29, 2010 surprised volcanologists because no previous volcanic activity had ever taken place there. A local scientist reported that fissures opened, then emitted gases for a little while before the eruption began. The eruption produced a small spatter cone and a lava flow that only travelled 8.2 metres, and caused some minor damage. The lava is trachybasalt and basaltic andesite.\nThe eruption was preceded by a 60&nbsp;km deep earthquake on 27 January. The calculated source depth of the lava is consistent with an origin at this depth in the asthenosphere.\nDisputed status\nThe origin of the lava is disputed. Kerr et al. (2010) interpreted the rocks as having formed from molten magma that had been created by partial melting in the mantle followed by eruption from a volcanic fissure vent. Kassi et al. (2012) disputed a mantle origin for these rocks, instead suggesting that the magma source was near-surface sedimentary rock that had been melted close to electricity pylons that had been struck by lightning, in a process similar to the formation of fulgurites (that are formed when lightning melts sand to produce natural glass).\nInitially, the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program included Tor Zawar in its database of volcanoes, citing the paper by Kerr et al. (2010). , however, the Global Volcanism Program excludes Tor Zawar from its volcano database  and excludes the 2010 event from its eruption database.\nReferences\n* [http://volcano.si.edu/reports/bulletin/contents.cfm?display=complete GVP Monthly Report: March 2012]\n* [http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=0302-08- Global Volcanism Program (GVP)]"
