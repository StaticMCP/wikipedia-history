Originally released January 10, 1990, it features a wide array of guest musicians, including then-former Black Sabbath band member Ozzy Osbourne.\nCover art issue\nAs originally released, Ward One featured a cover art image with a white background and a \"one man band\" motif.  Bill Ward has stated in interviews and on his website that this artwork was not intended to be the proper artwork, and was replaced for a reprint with a much more somber \"black\" cover.  Shortly after the black cover was issued, the record label (Chameleon) went out of business, and as such, the black cover art, while being Bill's preferred, is much harder to come by than the white one.  The cover image for the white version does remain in the black version, albeit as interior artwork.\nTrack listing\n#\"(Mobile) Shooting Gallery\" (Ward, Phillips, Lynch) – 5:11\n#\"Short Stories\" (Ward, M.
