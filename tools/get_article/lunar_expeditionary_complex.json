If implemented, it was intended to have been operational by 1980 and used for scientific and engineering research.\nHardware\nThe Vulkan-LEK project was based on new superheavy launcher developed in Glushko's bureau.\nThe moonbase design consisted of a number of modules, including:\n* Lunokhod, an 8-ton pressurized lunar rover to be used to build the base and for expeditions.\n* The LZM (\"Laboratory-Factory Module\"), a 15.5-ton pressurized module to be used for oxygen production and scientific experiments.\n* The LZhM (\"Laboratory-Habitation Module\"), 21.5-ton habitation module where cosmonauts were to reside.\n* A nuclear power station to provide electricity.\n* A simple transport vehicle to ferry supplies to and from a lunar orbit.\nProject termination\nThe project was cancelled in 1976 when a Russian Academy of Sciences Commission ruled that resources should be targeted toward projects primarily adding economic value rather than for national prestige.\nSee also\n* Zvezda (moonbase)\n* Soviet Moonshot\n* Space race\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060316185409/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/lekmplex.htm the LEK Lunar Expeditionary Complex] at astronautix.com.\n*[http://www.russianspaceweb.com/lunar_base.html Entry] at russianspaceweb.com."
