However, Pynsent signed his will before the Cider Tax was ever proposed. Pitt certainly opposed the tax, but that was because the legislation would have allowed the Revenue men to enter people's homes to check whether cider was being made, and he believed that an Englishman's home is his castle and no-one should enter uninvited. Pitt then used some of the income from the estate (£3000 per annum) to erect the monument to his benefactor.\nIn June 1948 it was reported that a heifer climbed the 172 steps to the top of the monument, but was later returned safely to her hillside pasture.\nThe tower was restored in the 1990s by the John Paul Getty Trust and English Heritage.\nSee also\n* List of Grade I listed buildings in South Somerset\n* 1763 Cider Bill\nReferences"
