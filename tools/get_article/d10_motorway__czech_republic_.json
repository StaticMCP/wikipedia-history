It forms part of the European route E65.\nChronology\nThe construction of today's D10 motorway began in 1967 with the construction of an  long section between Bezděčín and Chudoplesy.\nThe sections leading away from Prague have been built since the 1970s, and at that time, it was planned to build the expressway to the Polish border. As part of a reassessment of the concept of motorway and expressway construction carried out in 1993, the plans for a continuation from Turnov, towards Harrachov and towards the Polish border were removed. Thus, it is considered to be the first completed expressway in the Czech Republic.\nThe motorway, formerly known as R10 Expressway () was officially redesignated as the D10 on 1 January 2016.\nFuture developments\nThe D10 motorway is completed in its entire length according to the current motorway network concept. Therefore, all upcoming projects concern only construction modifications of already completed sections.\nOne project in development is the reconstruction of the Kosmonosy MÚK from a tubular intersection to a ring intersection over the motorway, which is being carried out by Eurovia at an approximate cost of CZK 737 million. The opening is planned for 2025.\nGallery\nSvijany, dálnice D10, pohled na Krkonoše.jpg|D10 near Svijany with the Giant Mountains in the background\nLažany a Ohrazenice, silnice R10, u začátku R35.jpg|D10 in Ohrazenice\nDálnice D10, exit Mnichovo Hradiště.jpg|D10 near Mnichovo Hradiště\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
