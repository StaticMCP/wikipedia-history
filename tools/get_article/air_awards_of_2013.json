The event was sponsored by Australian brewing company, Carlton Dry.\nIn 2013, the award for Best Independent Classical Album was introduced, as was the Carlton Dry Global Music Grant; a $50,000 cash prize to an emerging independent artist or band in order to provide a major boost to their profile internationally, the finances designed to be used to give the winner a leg up in the international market. In a press release, the AIR said \"The Carlton Dry Global Music Grant has been created to ensure that current and future generations of emerging Australian artists have the opportunity to take their music careers abroad. Conditions for entry are that the band or artist must be emerging, Australian, self released or released by an independent label, and that the prize money must be used exclusively to help tour, showcase, record, or relocate overseas to further their careers.\"\nPerformers\nPerferormers at the ceremony were:\n*Violent Soho\n*Archie Roach\n*Big Scary\n*Rüfüs\n*Saskwatch\n*Seth Sentry\nNominees and winners\nWinners are listed first and highlighted in boldface; other final nominees are listed alphabetically.\n{| class=wikitable style=\"width=\"150%\"\n|-\n! ! style=\"background:#589C89; width=;\"50%\"| Best Independent Artist\n! ! style=\"background:#589C89; width=;\"50%\"| Best Independent Album\n|-\n|\n*Flume\n**Big Scary\n**Dick Diver\n**Jagwar Ma\n**The Drones\n|\n*'Flume – Flume' (Future Classic)\n**Big Scary – Not Art (Pieater)\n**Dick Diver – Calendar Daus (Chapter Music)\n**Jagwar Ma – Howlin' (Future Classic)\n**The Drones – I See Seaweed (MGM)\n|-\n! ! style=\"background:#589C89; width=;\"50%\"| Best Independent Single/EP\n! ! style=\"background:#589C89; width=;\"50%\"| Breakthrough Independent Artist of the Year\n|-\n|\n*'Vance Joy – God Loves You When You're Dancing\n**Big Scary – \"Luck Now\"\n**Courtney Barnett – \"History Eraser\"\n**Flume – \"Holdin On\"\n**Jagwar Ma – \"Man I Need\"\n|\n*Vance Joy\n**Courtney Barnett\n**Kirin J.
