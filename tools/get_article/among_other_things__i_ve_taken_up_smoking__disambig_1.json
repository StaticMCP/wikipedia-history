A girl grows up alone with her father on an island in Maine and is sent to stay in New York City with gay friends of her father's who open up her past, and her own world, in ways she cannot begin to imagine. The book was an Editor's Choice at the New York Times Book Review. It also won a Lambda Literary Award in the Lesbian Debut Fiction category at the 2008 Lambda Literary Awards.\nIn a review in The Washington Post, Ron Charles wrote about the way the book “taps into older, sometimes ancient stories...There’s real wisdom in these classic myths and there’s real talent in this sensitive novel.”\nReferences\nExternal links\n* ''Among Other Things, I've Taken Up Smoking in [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/books/review/Flook-t.html?ref=review The New York Times Sunday Book Review]\n* Among Other Things, I've Taken Up Smoking'' at [http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9781594201301,00.html the Penguin Press]"
