Although former Prime Minister Vladimír Mečiar received the most votes in the first round, he was defeated by Ivan Gašparovič in the run-off.\nEduard Kukan, who had led the opinion polling prior to the elections, was surprisingly eliminated in the first round, narrowly beaten into third place by Gašparovič. Gašparovič later admitted that he had not expect to qualify for the second round, and on first round election night he had gone home to sleep and only found out about his success when he was woken up by phone calls from friends.\nIncumbent president Rudolf Schuster finished fourth with just 7% of the vote. He subsequently retired from politics.\nOpinion polls\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!Date!!Agency!!Schuster!!Kukan!!Mečiar!!Gašparovič!!Bútora!!Mikloško!!Roman!!Králik!!Kalman!!Šesták!!Bernát!!Kubík\n|-\n|||[http://www.focus-research.sk/files/11_prezidenti%2002-2004.pdf Focus]||17.5||bgcolor=#C1CCDB|27.5||23.1||13.7||6.1||4.7||5.4||0.5||0.5||0.5||0.4||0.1\n|-\n|9 March 2004||[http://dennik.hnonline.sk/slovensko/87469-omv-kukan-by-vyhral OMV]||15.5||bgcolor=#C1CCDB|27.9||22.4||15.8||6.3||6.7||3.4||0.6||0.4||0.2||0.6||0.2\n|-\n|16–22 March 2004||[http://www.infovolby.sk/index.php?base=data/pvm/0403290261.msg Markant]||9.7||bgcolor=#C1CCDB|30.3||23.3||19.7||5.5||4.4||||||||||||\n|-\n|27 March 2004||[http://www.sme.sk/c/1319287/preferencie-prezidentskych-kandidatov-podla-omv.html OMV]||13.0||bgcolor=#C1CCDB|27.0||24.2||17.1||6.5||8.7||1.1||0.8||0.8||0.2||0.4||0.2\n|}\nResults\n|party7=Party of the Democratic Left|votes7=15873\n|cand8=|party8=|votes8=10221\n|cand9=|party9=Independent|votes9=7734\n|cand10=Jozef Šesták|party10=Independent|votes10=6785\n|cand11=|party11=Independent|votes11=5719\n|cand12=Ľubomír Roman|party12=Alliance of the New Citizen|votes12=1806\n|invalid=29675|invalid2=26347\n|electorate=4204899|electorate2=4202597\n|source=Nohlen & Stöver, [http://eed.nsd.uib.no/webview/index.jsp?study=http://129.177.90.166:80/obj/fStudy/SKPA2006_Display&mode=cube&v=2&cube=http://129.177.90.166:80/obj/fCube/SKPA2006_Display_C1&top=yes European Election Database], [https://web.archive.org/web/20040307190021/http://www.ourcampaigns.com/cgi-bin/r.cgi/RaceDetail.html?&RaceID=42205 Our Campaigns]\n}}\nReferences"
