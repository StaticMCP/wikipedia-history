Prior to the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, Czech athletes had competed at the Olympics from 1920 to 1992 as Czechoslovakia and from 1900 to 1912 as Bohemia.\nAthletes from the Czech Republic have won a total of 67 medals at the Summer Games, with canoeing, athletics and shooting as the top medal-producing sports. The nation has also won 34 medals at the Winter Games, mostly in cross-country skiing, speed skating, and ultimately popular ice hockey. In terms of medal count, the most decorated Czech Olympian in the post-Czechoslovak period is speed skater Martina Sáblíková (7 medals between 2010 and 2022).\nThe National Olympic Committee for the Czech Republic is the Czech Olympic Committee, which was founded in 1899 and recognized in its current form by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1993. In November 2022, the Czech Olympic Committee requested that the name Czechia should be used in the IOC database.\nParticipation\nTimeline of participation\n{| class = wikitable style = text-align:center;font-size:90%\n|-\n!
