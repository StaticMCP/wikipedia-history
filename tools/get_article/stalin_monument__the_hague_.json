It shows a bust of Joseph Stalin, placed in a phone booth. In front of him is a herring - Stalin was fond of eating herring - and lamp on a table covered by red felt.\nThe sculpture was originally placed in the red light district of The Hague in 1986. After renovation it was moved to its current location just next to the KM21 museum for modern art.\nIt is part of the collection of the Kunstmuseum, that oversees KM21.\nReferences"
