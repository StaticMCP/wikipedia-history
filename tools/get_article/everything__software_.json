While the binaries are licensed under a permissive licence identical to the MIT License, it is not open-source.\nOverview\nWhen Everything first runs, it creates an index of the names of every file and folder on all NTFS and ReFS volumes on the system from file metadata, in the case of NTFS from the NTFS Master File Table. By default, all mounted NTFS and ReFS volumes are indexed. Once created, the index is continually updated by the application; in the case of NTFS the updates are fetched from the NTFS change journal.\nSpecific folders on any file system can also be added to the index, but the indexing of folders not using NTFS or ReFS will be slow, although searching using the completed index will not be.\nRegardless of the file system used on the indexed drives and folders, Everything searches its index for file names matching a user search expression, which may be a fragment of the target file name or a regular expression, displaying intermediate and immediate results as the search term is entered.\nSince Everything does not index content and, for NTFS drives, relies only on the NTFS change journal to filter file updates, the only file system activity it requires on NTFS drives is updating its index, and it uses very little memory and processor time to provide its service when only indexing NTFS and ReFS drives.\nTake Command Console incorporates the internal command everything to allow command line access to the program.\nSecurity concerns\nBecause Everything requires access to the NTFS change journal, it must run with administrator privileges, either in a privileged user account or as a Windows service. As a Windows service it can expose search functionality to accounts without administrator privileges. However, Everything does not filter search results by client privileges before displaying them, so that every user can see every file names on a volume.\nDevelopment status\nNo updates of Everything were issued from November 2009 to January 2013. Since then the program has received many updates.\nSimilar alternatives\nThese alternative and also free search engines use the same technique of reading the NTFS index directly:\n* NTFS-Search (last updated 5 July 2017) and SwiftSearch (last updated 6 July 2019) – both open source\n* UltraSearch by Jam Software (functionally limited free version of commercial software) – freeware\nSee also\n*\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* [http://www.refolder.com/index.php/2009/02/everything-search-engine-review/ Everything Search Engine Review], Refolder\n* [https://www.osjoy.com/everything-desktop-search-engine.html/ Everything Search – Best Desktop Search Engine for Win10], detailed description, osjoy.com, 19 December 2018\nExternal links\n*\n*"
