      "text": "# Presidents' Day (Botswana)\n\n'''Presidents' Day''' is a holiday in Botswana. Since 2006, it has been a one-day holiday held on the third Monday and Tuesday in July.  Previous to that, it was a two-day holiday, held on  Third Monday and Tuesday in July, but the Public Holidays Amendment of 2006 modified the holiday to a single day.  Nevertheless, many public and private institutions such as the Botswana Stock Exchange still typically observe a two-day holiday at this time of year.\nSee also\n* Heads of state of Botswana\n* George Washington's Birthday, also known as Presidents' Day in the United States\nReferences"
