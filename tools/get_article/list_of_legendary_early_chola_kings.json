The other source of early Chola history is found in the inscriptions left by later Chola kings.\nSources of early Chola history\nThe genealogy of the Chola kings as found in Tamil literature and in the many inscriptions left by the later Chola kings. It contain records of kings for whom no verifiable historic evidence survives. Many versions of this lineage exist. The main source is the Sangam literature – particularly, religious literature such as Periyapuranam, semi-biographical poems of the later Chola period such as the temple and cave inscriptions and left by medieval Cholas.\nIrrespective of the source, no list of the kings has a strong evidentiary basis and, while they generally are similar to each other, no two lists are identical. Some historians consider these lists as comprehensive conglomerations of various Hindu deities and Puranic characters attributed to local chieftains and invented ancestry of dynasty attempting to re-establish their legitimacy and supremacy in a land they were trying to conquer.\nOrigin of Cholas and Literary sources\nTypical hero and demi-gods found their place in the ancestry claimed by the later Cholas in the genealogies incorporated into the copper-plate charters and stone inscription of the tenth and eleventh centuries. The earliest version of this is found in the Kilbil Plates which give fifteen names before Chola including the genuinely historical ones of Karikala, Perunarkilli and Kocengannan. The Thiruvalangadu Plates swells this list to forty-four, and the Kanya Plates lists fifty-two.\nThe Cholas were looked upon as descended from the Solar dynasty. The Puranas speak of a Chola king, a supposed contemporary of the sage Agastya, whose devotion brought the river Kavery into existence.\nThe story of king Manu Needhi Cholan tells of how he sentenced his son to death for having accidentally killed a calf. He was called thus because he followed the rules of Manu; his real name is not mentioned and is thought to be \"Ellalan\" according to Maha vamsam who was attributed with a similar story. King Shibi rescued a dove from a hunter by giving his own flesh to the hungry and poor hunter and was also part of the legends. King Shivi was also called Sembiyan, a popular title assumed by a number of Chola kings.\nSangam period Chola rulers\nThe Chola kings of the Sangam period and the life of people contributed much to Tamil cultural wealth. The Sangam literature is full of legends about Chola kings. However, no evidentiary basis supports this list of Kings either by way of inscriptions or by way of literary evidence (even in Sangam literature). The dates of accession are approximate interpolation of the Chronological standpoints in Tamil history.\n;List of Sangam Chola rulers till 250s CE–\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ List of early (Sangam Period) Chola rulers\n!Ruler\n!Reign\n|-\n|Eri Oliyan Vaendhi\n|c. 3020 BCE\n|-\n|Maandhuvaazhi\n|c. 2980 BCE\n|-\n|El Mei Nannan\n|c. 2945 BCE\n|-\n|Keezhai Kinjuvan\n|c. 2995 BCE\n|-\n|Vazhisai Nannan\n|c. 2865 BCE\n|-\n|Mei Kiyagusi Aerru\n|c. 2820 BCE\n|-\n|Aai Kuzhi Agusi Aerru\n|c. 2810 BCE\n|-\n|Thizhagan Maandhi\n|c. 2800 BCE\n|-\n|Maandhi Vaelan\n|c. 2770 BCE\n|-\n|Aai Adumban\n|c. 2725 BCE\n|-\n|Aai Nedun Jaet Chozha Thagaiyan\n|c. 2710 BCE\n|-\n|El Mei Agguvan \"a.k.a\" Keezh Nedu Mannan\n|c. 2680 BCE\n|-\n|Mudiko Mei Kaalaiyam Thagaiyan\n|c. 2650 BCE\n|-\n|Ilangok Keezh Kaalaiyan Thagaiyan \"a.k.a.\" Ilangeezh Nannan — Kadamba lineage started  by his brother Aai Keezh Nannan\n|c. 2645 BCE\n|-\n|Kaalaiyan Gudingyan\n|c. 2630 BCE\n|-\n|Nedun Gaalayan Dhagayan\n|c. 2615 BCE\n|-\n|Vaengai Nedu Vael Varaiyan\n|c. 2614 BCE\n|-\n|Vaet Kaal Kudingyan\n|c. 2600 BCE\n|-\n|Maei Ila Vael Varaiyan\n|c. 2590 BCE\n|-\n|Sibi Vendhi\n|c. 2580 BCE\n|-\n|Paru Bonji Chaamazhingyan\n|c. 2535 BCE\n|-\n|Vaeqratrtri Chembiya Chozhan\n|c. 2525 BCE\n|-\n|Saamazhi Chozhiya Vaelaan\n|c. 2515 BCE\n|-\n|Uthi Ven Gaalai Thagan\n|c. 2495 BCE\n|-\n|Nannan That Kaalai Thagan\n|c. 2475 BCE\n|-\n|Vel Vaen Mindi\n|c. 2445 BCE\n|-\n|Nedun Jembiyan\n|c. 2415 BCE\n|-\n|Nedu Nonji Vendhi\n|c. 2375 BCE\n|-\n|Maei Vael Paqratrtri\n|c. 2330 BCE\n|-\n|Aai Perun Thoan Nonji\n|c. 2315 BCE\n|-\n|Kudiko Pungi\n|c. 275 BCE\n|-\n|Perun Goep Poguvan\n|c. 2250 BCE\n|-\n|Koeth Thatrtri\n|c. 2195 BCE\n|-\n|Vadi Sembiyan\n|c. 2160 BCE\n|-\n|Aalam Poguvan\n|c. 2110 BCE\n|-\n|Nedun Jembiyan\n|c. 2085 BCE\n|-\n|Perum Paeyar Poguvan\n|c. 2056 BCE\n|-\n|Kadun Jembiyan\n|c. 2033 BCE\n|-\n|Nedun Kathan\n|c. 2015 BCE\n|-\n|Paru Nakkan\n|c. 1960 BCE\n|-\n|Vani Sembiyan\n|c. 1927 BCE\n|-\n|Udha Chira Mondhuvan\n|c. 1902 BCE\n|-\n|Perun Kaththan\n|c. 1875 BCE\n|-\n|Kadun Kandhalan\n|c. 1860 BCE\n|-\n|Nakka Monjuvan\n|c. 1799 BCE\n|-\n|Maarko Vael Maandhuvan Aaththikko\n|c. 1786 BCE\n|-\n|Musukunthan Vaendhi\n|c. 1753 BCE\n|-\n|Peru nakkan Thatrtri\n|c. 1723 BCE\n|-\n|Vaer Kaththan\n|c. 1703 BCE\n|-\n|Ambalaththu Irumundruvan\n|c. 1682 BCE\n|-\n|Kaari Mondhuvan\n|c. 1640 BCE\n|-\n|Vennakkan Thatrtri\n|c. 1615 BCE\n|-\n|Maarko Chunthuvan\n|c. 1565 BCE\n|-\n|Vaer Parunthoan Mundruvan\n|c. 1520 BCE\n|-\n|Udhan Kaththan\n|c. 1455 BCE\n|-\n|Kaariko Sunthuvan\n|c. 1440 BCE\n|-\n|Vendri Nungunan\n|c. 1396 BCE\n|-\n|Mondhuvan Vendhi\n|c. 1376 BCE\n|-\n|Kaandhaman\n|c. 1359 BCE\n|-\n|Mundruvan Vendhi\n|c. 1337 BCE\n|-\n|Kaandhaman\n|c. 1297 BCE\n|-\n|Monjuvan Vendhi\n|c. 1276 BCE\n|-\n|Ani Sembiyan\n|c. 1259 BCE\n|-\n|Nungunan Vendhi\n|c. 1245 BCE\n|-\n|Maarkop Perum Cenni\n|c. 1229 BCE\n|-\n|Monjuvan Nanvendhi\n|c. 1180 BCE\n|-\n|Kopperunar chenni\n|c. 1170 BCE\n|-\n|Monthuvan Jembiyan\n|c. 1145 BCE\n|-\n|Narchenni\n|c. 1105 BCE\n|-\n|Caet Chembiyan\n|c. 1095 BCE\n|-\n|Nakkar Chenni\n|c. 1060 BCE\n|-\n|Parun Jembiyan\n|c. 1045 BCE\n|-\n|Venjenni\n|c. 998 BCE\n|-\n|Musugunthan\n|c. 989 BCE\n|-\n|Maarkop Perun Jembiyan\n|c. 960 BCE\n|-\n|Nedunjenni\n|c. 935 BCE\n|-\n|Thatchembiyan\n|c. 915 BCE\n|-\n|Ambalaththu Iruvaer Chembiyan\n|c. 895 BCE\n|-\n|Kaariko Chenni\n|c. 865 BCE\n|-\n|Venvaer Chenni\n|c. 830 BCE\n|-\n|Kaandhaman\n|c. 788 BCE\n|-\n|Kaandhalan\n|c. 721 BCE\n|-\n|Caetchenni\n|c. 698 BCE\n|-\n|Vani Nungunan\n|c. 680 BCE\n|-\n|Mudhu Sembiyan Vendhi\n|c. 640 BCE\n|-\n|Peelan Jembiyach Chozhiyan\n|c. 615 BCE\n|-\n|Maeyan Gadungo\n|c. 590 BCE\n|-\n|Thiththan\n|c. 570 BCE\n|-\n|Perunar Killi Porvaiko\n|c. 515 BCE\n|-\n|Kadu Mundruvan\n|c. 496 BCE\n|-\n|Kopperunjozhan\n|c. 495 BCE\n|-\n|Narkilli Mudiththalai\n|c. 480 BCE\n|-\n|Thevvango Chozhan\n|c. 465 BCE\n|-\n|Naran Jembiyan\n|c. 455 BCE\n|-\n|Nakkam Peela Valavan\n|c. 440 BCE\n|-\n|Iniyan Rhevvan Jenni\n|c. 410 BCE\n|-\n|Varcembiyan\n|c. 395 BCE\n|-\n|Nedun Jembiyan\n|c. 386 BCE\n|-\n|Nakkan Aran Jozhan\n|c. 345 BCE\n|-\n|Ambalathu Irungoch Chenni\n|c. 330 BCE\n|-\n|Perunar Killi\n|c. 316 BCE\n|-\n|Kochaet Cenni\n|c. 286 BCE\n|-\n|Cerupazhi Erinda Ilanjaetcenni\n|c. 275 BCE\n|-\n|Nedungop Perunkilli\n|c. 220 BCE\n|-\n|Cenni Ellagan\n|c. 205 BCE\n|-\n|Perun Gilli\n|c. 165 BCE\n|-\n|Kopperun Jozhiyav Ilanjaetcenni\n|c. 140 BCE\n|-\n|Perunar Killi Mudiththalaiko\n|c. 120 BCE\n|-\n|Perumpoot Cenni\n|c. 100 BCE\n|-\n|Ilam Perunjenni\n|c. 100 BCE\n|-\n|Perungilli Vendhi \"aka\" Karikaalan I\n|c. 70 BCE\n|-\n|Nedumudi Killi\n|c. 35 BCE\n|-\n|Ilavanthigaipalli Thunjiya Maei Nalangilli Caet Cenni\n|c. 20 BCE\n|-\n|Aai Vaenalangilli\n|c. 15 BCE\n|-\n|Uruvapakraer Ilanjaetcenni\n|c. 10 -
