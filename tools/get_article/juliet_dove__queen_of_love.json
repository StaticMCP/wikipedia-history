The amulet makes the person that wears it truly, strongly and deeply romantically attractive to the opposite gender. With the help of two rats that can talk, who are friends of the shop owner, she finds out the amulet was given to her by Eris, the goddess of chaos and discord. She is embarrassed by the group of boys that follow her, as she has unwittingly captivated and charmed them to her romantic love and affections.\nReception\nLouise Brueggemann, of Booklist, reviewed the book saying, \"Coville's easy style works well in a tale that has its share of both humor and heartache.
