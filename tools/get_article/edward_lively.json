He studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he became a Fellow, He was Regius Professor of Hebrew from 1575 to 1605. His published works include Latin expositions of some of the minor prophets, as well as a work on the chronology of monarchs of Persia.\nHe played an active role during the planning for the King James Version of the Bible, and his death from a peritonsillar abscess is said to have considerably delayed commencement of the work.
