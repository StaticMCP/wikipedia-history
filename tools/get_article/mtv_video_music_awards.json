The ceremony has often been called the Super Bowl for youth, an acknowledgment of the VMA ceremony's ability to draw millions of youth from teens to 20-somethings each year. By 2001, the VMA had become a coveted award.\nThe annual VMA ceremony occurs before the end of summer and held either in late August or mid-September, and broadcast live on CBS. The first VMA ceremony was held in 1984 at New York City's Radio City Music Hall. The ceremonies are normally held in either New York City or Los Angeles. However, the ceremonies have also been hosted in Miami, Las Vegas, Newark, New Jersey, and Elmont, New York.\nThe statue given to winners is an astronaut on the Moon, one of the earliest representations of MTV, and was colloquially called a \"moonman\", though it has been called a \"moon person\" by MTV since the 2017 ceremony. The statue was conceived by Manhattan Design, who were also designers of the original MTV logo, based on the network's debut network identification animation utilizing Apollo 11 mission footage, created by Fred Seibert and produced by Alan Goodman and Buzz Potamkin at Buzzco Associates. The statue is now made by Society Awards, a New York City-based firm. Since the 2006 ceremony, viewers are able to vote for their favorite videos in all general categories.\nTaylor Swift is the most awarded solo artist in the history of the VMAs, having won 30 trophies between 2009 and 2024, which includes record-breaking five Video of the Year VMAs (\"Bad Blood\", \"You Need To Calm Down\", All Too Well: The Short Film, \"Anti-Hero\" and \"Fortnight\").\nNotable moments\n1980s\n, site of 12 VMAs, including the first]]\n1984: at the first MTV Video Music Awards in 1984, Madonna performed her hit \"Like a Virgin\" wearing a combination bustier/wedding gown, including her trademark \"Boy Toy\" belt. During the performance, she rolled around on the floor, revealing lace stockings and a garter. Cyndi Lauper spoke in \"Exorcist-esque gibberish\" to explain the VMA rules right before winning the Best Female video for \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\". David Bowie, the Beatles and director Richard Lester were rewarded with the first ever Video Vanguard Awards for their work in pioneering the music video. The Cars' \"You Might Think\" won the very first video of the year, beating out Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" and Herbie Hancock's \"Rockit\".\n1987: At the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards, Peter Gabriel won ten awards, including the Video Vanguard Award and Video of the Year for his video \"Sledgehammer\", holding the VMA record for most Moonmen in a single night.\n1988: At the 1988 MTV Video Music Awards, Michael Jackson appeared for the first time. A pre-recorded live performance of Bad was shown.\" He was also awarded the Video Vanguard Award, which was later renamed in his honor.\n1989: Comedian Andrew Dice Clay appeared at the 1989 Video Music Awards to promote his new movie, The Adventures of Ford Fairlane, earning a \"lifetime ban\" from the network when he introduced Cher with some of his recently notorious nursery rhymes that contained vulgar language and references. After performing with Tom Petty, Guns N' Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin was assaulted by Mötley Crüe lead singer Vince Neil, leading to a verbal battle between Neil and Guns N' Roses lead singer Axl Rose.\nJon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora turned out a stripped-down acoustic performance of the Bon Jovi hits \"Livin' on a Prayer\" and \"Wanted Dead or Alive\", and in the process possibly provided the inspirational spark for MTV Unplugged. While the showrunners have stated that it was already in development by the time of the event, they've also credited the pair's performance with influencing the show to go from initially being meant only for \"young, up-and-coming artists\" into being a simplified showcase for the \"big, stadium, electric-arena-type acts\".\nPaula Abdul was nominated for six awards, picking up four wins. She performed a seven-minute medley of her singles \"Straight Up\", \"Cold Hearted\", and \"Forever Your Girl\".\nWhen Madonna won the Viewer's Choice Award (sponsored by Pepsi-Cola) for her \"Like a Prayer\" video, she thanked Pepsi-Cola in her acceptance speech \"for causing so much controversy\". Pepsi-Cola had paid Madonna $5 million to appear in a commercial that would predominantly feature the world premiere of \"Like a Prayer\"; the commercial, titled \"Make a Wish\", depicted Madonna drinking Pepsi and watching a home video of her eighth birthday. The tone that the commercial sought to convey sharply contrasted with the music video. When Pepsi executives saw the video, they yanked the advertisement after only two airings, in an attempt to dissociate themselves from Madonna. She also gave one of the most memorable performances of her hit \"Express Yourself\", as a preview of what would become her Blond Ambition World Tour.\n1990s\nperforming at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards]]\n1990: at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards, Madonna  performed her single \"Vogue\", which featured Madonna and her backup dancers dressed in an 18th-century French theme, with Madonna bearing great resemblance to Marie Antoinette. The performance consisted of both a dramatic historical reinterpretation of \"Vogue\" as well as her dramatically becorseted breasts.\n1991: during the award show the MTV Video Vanguard Award was renamed to the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award from then on, in honor of his contributions to the culture of music videos by changing them from a  promotional tool featuring musicians playing instruments and singing, to a \"short film\" with a storyline.\nA conflict between Poison's Bret Michaels and C.C. DeVille culminated in a fistfight at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards. DeVille was fired and replaced by Pennsylvanian guitarist Richie Kotzen. Paul Reubens had his first public appearance, during the opening montage, following an arrest for lewd-conduct earlier that year. Taking the stage in costume as Pee-wee Herman, he received a standing ovation, after which he asked the audience, \"Heard any good jokes lately?\". After his appearance, Van Halen made their television debut, performing \"Poundcake\". Metallica was another highlight of the performances with \"Enter Sandman\".\nPrince and The New Power Generation performed their song \"Gett Off\" on a Caligula-esque set, with Prince dressed in a yellow mesh outfit which exposed his buttocks. His trousers were parodied numerous times throughout the following year, on the sketch comedy TV series In Living Color, and even at the following year's VMAs by radio shock jock Howard Stern. It also marked the final TV appearance of Kiss with Eric Carr prior to Carr's death in November 1991.\n1992: in the 1992 show, MTV requested Nirvana perform \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", while the band itself had indicated it preferred to play new songs \"Rape Me\" and \"\". Network executives continued to push for \"Teen Spirit\" but finally offered the band a choice to play either \"Teen Spirit\" or \"Lithium\", which the band appeared to accept. At the performance, Nirvana began to play, and Kurt Cobain played the first few chords of the song, \"Rape Me\", much to the horror of MTV execs, before continuing their regular performance of \"Lithium\". Near the end of the song, frustrated that his amplifier had stopped functioning, bassist Krist Novoselic decided to toss his bass into the air for dramatic effect. He misjudged the landing, and the bass ended up bouncing off of his forehead, forcing him to stumble off the stage in a daze.\nBackstage and before the show, Guns N' Roses vocalist Axl Rose challenged Cobain to a fight after he, his wife, Hole lead singer Courtney Love, and Nirvana bandmates Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl egged him on. At the end of Nirvana's performance, while Cobain was trashing the band's equipment, Dave Grohl ran to the microphone and shouted \"Hi, Axl! Where's Axl?\" repeatedly. Guns N' Roses' video for the ballad \"November Rain\" won the MTV Video Music Award for best cinematography. During the show, the band performed \"November Rain\" with singer Elton John. Because of the dispute Rose had with Cobain, moments before the \"November Rain\" performance, Cobain spat on the keys of what he thought was Axl's piano. Cobain later revealed that he was shocked to see Elton John play on the piano he had spat on. During the commercial break, the Alien 3 Pepsi commercial was shown.\nRadio host Howard Stern appeared as Fartman, Stern's radio superhero, wearing a buttocks-exposing costume obviously inspired by Prince's outfit from the previous year. Stern was a presenter for best hard rock/metal performance with actor Luke Perry (after several other celebrities turned him down).\n1993: at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards, Madonna opened the show in a gender-bending performance of her song \"Bye Bye Baby\", in which Madonna and her two backup singers, dressed in tuxedos and top hats, danced with women in corsets in a choreographed, highly sexual routine.\nRuPaul and Milton Berle, who had conflicts backstage, presented an award together. When Berle touched RuPaul's breasts, RuPaul ad-libbed the line \"So you used to wear gowns, but now you're wearing diapers.\"\nRapper Snoop Dogg presented the Best R&B Video award with Dr. Dre and George Clinton. At the time, Snoop was wanted in connection with the week-old drive-by murder of an L.A. gang member.\nJanet Jackson closed the show with her performance of \"That's the Way Love Goes\" & \"If\".\n1994: at the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards on September 8, months after a profanity-laced appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman, Madonna was announced to present the award for Best Video of the Year. She came out, arm-in-arm with an unannounced David Letterman, to a wild ovation. At the microphone, Letterman told her \"I'll be in the car. Watch your language\", and left.\nRecently betrothed couple Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley received a standing ovation as they walked on stage hand-in-hand. After turning to the audience and proclaiming, \"And just think, nobody thought this would last\", Jackson grabbed Presley and kissed her.\n1995: at the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards, Hole perform the song \"Violet\" from their major-label debut album Live Through This. This was one of the first major televised performances given by frontwoman Courtney Love following the death of her husband Kurt Cobain and the death of her band's bassist Kristen Pfaff in 1994.  Before beginning the song, Love dedicated the performance to her husband and different people in the entertainment industry who had recently died: \"This is for Kurt, and Kristen, and River, and Joe, and today Joni Abbott, this is for you.\" Abbott worked in the Talent Relations department at MTV and had recently committed suicide. The song ended with Love throwing her guitar, knocking the microphone stand into the crowd and pushing over speaker-boxes with bandmate Eric Erlandson before exiting the stage. Love also caused a stir when she interrupted a post-ceremony interview with Kurt Loder and Madonna by throwing her make-up compacts at the singer as they broadcast outside the awards venue.\nMichael Jackson performed for over 15 minutes to a medley of his main songs, including \"Scream\", and danced his signature moves, including the robot, moonwalk and the relatively unknown \"Bankhead Bounce\". While Slash accompanied Jackson and played guitar on \"Black or White and the beginning of Billie Jean\". This performance was voted by the public as the Best VMA Pop Performance and Most Iconic VMA Performance in 2011 with more than half the votes.\nTLC was the big winner of the night won four awards, including \"Viewer's Choice\", \"Best Group Video\", and \"Video of the Year\" (Waterfalls).\n1996: at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards, the four original members of Van Halen received 20-second standing ovation when they made their first public appearance together since their break-up in 1985.\nSeveral weeks later, the public learned that Van Halen would not reunite with Roth. Roth released a statement apologizing to fans, stating that he was an unwitting participant in a publicity stunt to sell more copies of the greatest hits album, Best Of Vol. 1, and that he had been led to believe that he was rejoining Van Halen. The following day, Eddie and Alex Van Halen released a statement, stating that they had been honest with Roth, and never led him to believe that he had been re-hired.\nDuring British band Oasis' performance at the show, lead vocalist Liam Gallagher made rude gestures at brother Noel as he was playing his guitar solo, then spat beer all over the stage before storming off.\nAlanis Morissette performed \"Your House\", a hidden track from her bestseller album \"Jagged Little Pill\".\nThe recently reunited Kiss closed the show with a special concert aired from the Brooklyn Bridge.\nTupac Shakur made his final public appearance before his murder.\n1997: at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards, Pat Smear announced that he was leaving Foo Fighters halfway through their performance and presented his replacement, Franz Stahl, who had been a member of the band Scream with Dave Grohl.\nThe Spice Girls, who won the best dance video award for their music video \"Wannabe\", wore a black strap on their left arms as a sign of grief because of Diana, Princess of Wales's death four days prior to the event.\nWhile accepting the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist Video that year for \"Sleep to Dream\", Fiona Apple appealed to her audience not to be enamored of celebrity culture. She proclaimed, \"this world is bullshit\" and quoted Maya Angelou, saying \"go with yourself\". Though her comments were generally greeted with cheers and applause at the awards ceremony, the media backlash was huge. Some considered her remarks to be hypocritical, however she was unapologetic: \"When I have something to say, I'll say it.\"\nMarilyn Manson performed the song \"The Beautiful People\", as the grand finale, and the video for this song was nominated for \"Best Rock Video\" and \"Best Special Effects\", marking one of the most significant performances for the band.\n1998: at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards, during the original broadcast of the show, a commercial faded in the Nine Inch Nails NIN logo on a black screen while playing a combination of music that started as a solo piano piece and morphed into an electronic/industrial beat (which would later found out to be the songs \"La Mer\" and \"Into the Void\", which share many melodic components and can be considered variations on a theme) and ended with Trent Reznor screaming \"Tried to save myself, but myself kept slipping away\" and the word \"ninetynine\" in the trademark NIN reversed-N font. This was only shown once during the original broadcast, was edited out of all repeats.\nGeri Halliwell attended the event, one of her first public appearances since she left the Spice Girls.\nAt the red carpet, actress Rose McGowan was wearing a see-through dress, no bra, and a thong, while Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston poked fun at their rumored rift by wearing lookalike chocolate brown dresses by Vera Wang. In an attempt to outdo each other, the singers tore off pieces of their dresses to reveal minidresses then staged a faux catfight that left the audience in disbelief. \"People thought Whitney and I had some kind of beef\", explained Carey.\n1999: Lil' Kim showed up at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards with an entire breast exposed and only a small pasty over the nipple. Kim's outfit became even more controversial later when she appeared on stage with Diana Ross and Mary J. Blige to present the Best Hip-Hop Video award, and Ross reached over, cupped her hand under Kim's exposed breast and jiggled it while Kim laughed.\nDuring the following acceptance speech by the Beastie Boys, group member Ad-Rock addressed the instances of rape and sexual assault that occurred in the crowd at the recent Woodstock 1999 concert event.  He pleaded to other musicians in the room to make a change in the way they treat fans at concerts; to pledge to talk with promoters and security to ensure \"the safety of all the girls and the women who come to our shows\".\nAfeni Shakur and Voletta Wallace, the mothers of the recently deceased Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G., met for the first time at the ceremony.\nBritney Spears made her debut appearance on the show, performing her single \"...Baby One More Time\" and later introducing NSYNC for \"Tearin' Up My Heart\".\nRicky Martin took the stage of the ceremony to perform his singles \"She's All I Ever Had\" and \"Livin' la Vida Loca\".\nTLC won Best Group Video for \"No Scrubs\", receiving a standing ovation from the audience and artists. For the second year in a row, the Backstreet Boys took the Viewer's Choice Award for \"I Want It That Way\", a song they performed during the broadcast.\nBefore presenting the final award, a group of drag queens paid tribute to Madonna wearing her most iconic outfits with a medley of her hit songs. Madonna herself then appeared onstage and remarked, \"All I have to say is that it takes a real man to fill my shoes.\" She then introduced Paul McCartney, who presented the Video of the Year to \"some guy called Laurence Hill\" (Lauryn Hill).\n2000s\n2000: at the 2000 Video Music Awards, Limp Bizkit won the award for Best Rock Video. As vocalist Fred Durst spoke, Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim Commerford climbed onto the scaffolding of the set. Durst egged Commerford on, saying \"Stage dive, dude\" and \"Take a dive\", finally ending his speech with \"and [Commerford]'s a pussy 'cause he won't jump\". Commerford and his bodyguard were sentenced to a night in jail. RATM vocalist Zack de la Rocha reportedly left the awards after Commerford's stunt. RATM guitarist Tom Morello recalled that Commerford related his plan to the rest of the band before the show, and that both de la Rocha and Morello advised him against it immediately after Bizkit was presented the award.\nEminem performed his two singles \"The Real Slim Shady\" and \"The Way I Am\". The performance began with Eminem's single \"The Real Slim Shady\" which started outside the Radio City Music Hall on 6th Avenue, Manhattan. Eminem continued his performance into the arena and was followed by a hundred Eminem 'clones' wearing white tank tops and baggy jeans with bleached blonde hair.\nNapster co-founder Shawn Fanning co-introduced Britney Spears. Fanning wore a Metallica T-shirt, much to the displeasure of Metallica drummer and anti-Napster advocate Lars Ulrich. Britney performed \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" and her newest smash hit \"Oops!... I Did It Again\", which gained media attention mostly due to Spears's ripping off a tuxedo to reveal nude-colored performance attire. At performance's end, VMA co-host Marlon Wayans proclaimed, \"Girl done went from 'The Mickey Mouse Club' to the strip club.\"\nAt the end of Christina Aguilera's performance, Durst walked onstage and performed part of his band's song \"Livin' It Up\" with Aguilera. After eliciting charged reactions from his fans, Durst stated: \"I already told you guys before, I did it all for the nookie, man.\" The feud died weeks later. Aguilera denied Durst's statement, saying Durst \"got no nookie\".\nAguilera and Spears disproved rumors of a rivalry when they came onstage, holding hands, and introduced Whitney Houston. Houston, who had been targeted by the media for erratic behavior, canceled appearances, drug use rumors and being busted for carrying marijuana at a Hawaii airport just a few months prior, came out to a standing ovation and introduced an award to Eminem with husband Bobby Brown, who was recently let out from jail. Houston revealed more erratic behavior, jumping up and down saying \"free\" in reference to Brown's recent jail release. Aaliyah would win two MTV Video Music Awards for Best Female Video and Best Video from a Film for \"Try Again\".\n2001: at the 2001 Video Music Awards, Britney Spears performed her single, \"I'm a Slave 4 U\". while dancing in a very revealing outfit, the performance featured the singer in a cage with a tiger and briefly dancing with a real albino snake on her shoulders. The inclusion of a tiger and a snake in the performance bought a great deal of criticism from PETA.\nU2 had been set to perform a medley including \"Elevation\", \"Beautiful Day\" and \"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\". The riser they were performing on lost power and MTV had to cut to several minutes of promos while everything was set up again. They lost power again and finally the band was lowered to the ground and performed without the riser. After the performance, lead singer Bono explained that MTV \"forgot to pay the electricity bill\".\nMichael Jackson made a surprise appearance at the end of NSYNC's performance of \"Pop\". Surrounded by members of the group, Jackson performed some of his trademark dance moves to Justin Timberlake's beatboxing.\nThe show paid tribute to the R&B singer/actress Aaliyah, who was supposed to present an award but died two weeks before in a plane crash.

Jackson said, \"When I was a little boy growing up in Indiana if someone told me I'd be getting 'the artist of the millennium award,' I'd have never believed it.\" A year later, at the 2003 VMAs, this was parodied by presenters Fred Durst and Jack Black, with Durst stating that Black was the \"funniest man alive\".\nThe Hives and The Vines both performed on the night after the sudden garage rock revival during the year, with rumors spreading around that it was to be 'battle of the bands' performance. Once The Hives performed, singer Howlin' Pelle Almqvist said to the crowd \"I know you want us to play more, but that's all the time we have for so you can turn off [your TV] now\", just before The Vines came on the bigger stage to perform their hit single \"Get Free\", ultimately destroying their set after their performance.\nTriumph the Insult Comic Dog appeared and had a confrontation with Eminem. Eminem had a confrontation with Moby, who had called the rapper's music misogynistic and homophobic. By that time, there were multiple boos from the crowd. The Best Male Video award was given to Eminem right after the confrontation with Triumph and Moby, and when Eminem went to stage to pick up the award, in the middle of his speech, he challenged Moby to fight if he continued to boo him.\nJustin Timberlake made his solo performance debut on the show, performing his single \"Like I Love You\".\nTionne \"T-Boz\" Watkins and Rozonda \"Chilli\" Thomas, the surviving members of the top-selling R&B trio TLC, made their first television appearance since the death of bandmate Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes.\nShakira took the stage of the VMAs to perform her single \"Objection (Tango)\".\nChristina Aguilera shocked the audience by wearing a skimpy outfit and heavy makeup, with a dirty look removing her good-girl image. She was part of an awkward moment at the awards when presenting the Best Male Video Award to Eminem, who had insulted her in 2000.\nCanadian artist Avril Lavigne won her first award ever as Best New Artist in a Video, getting the record for the youngest artist so far to win this award at the age of 17. She kicked off the 2002 VMAs with a \"Complicated\" / \"Sk8er Boi\" pre-show performance and together with Lisa Marie Presley they gave the award for Best Female Video to Pink who was under the effects of alcohol during her acceptance speech.\nAxl Rose unveiled the new lineup of New Guns N' Roses. The band's set was the show's finale, and although the performance was meant to be kept a secret, some New York radio outlets announced the performance earlier in the day. The band played a set consisting of \"Welcome to the Jungle\", \"Madagascar\", and \"Paradise City\".\n2003: at the 2003 Video Music Awards, Madonna played a groom kissing her brides, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, on stage. The gender role-reversal and lesbian theme instantly made front-page headlines. The three singers performed a medley of her classic hit, \"Like a Virgin\", and her then latest release, \"Hollywood\", with a guest rap by Missy Elliott. A quick camera cut to the reaction of Justin Timberlake, who dated Spears until 2002, also gained media attention. The design resembled Madonna's performance of \"Like a Virgin\" at the 1984 VMAs: the same wedding cake set, wedding dresses and \"Boy Toy\" belt worn by Madonna 19 years ago now adorned Aguilera and Spears.\nBeyoncé opened her performance by descending upside down from the rafters at Radio City Music Hall. Knowles performed \"Baby Boy\" as she was gently lowered to the stage, dressed in harem pants. She was later joined by Jay-Z as they performed their duet \"Crazy in Love\".

It was also the first time that Spanish-language videos were nominated at the awards.\nAlso at the show, while introducing the reggaeton spot, Fat Joe made a disparaging comment about G-Unit: \"I'd like to tell the people home I feel so safe tonight with all this police protection courtesy of G-Unit...\". Later in the show, after G-Unit's performance, 50 Cent directed profanities at Fat Joe which were edited out before the shows airing although some broadcasts played the uncensored version of the show.

Gwen Stefani and Snoop Dogg won best dressed female and male and received prizes to donate to a charity of their choice.\nKelly Clarkson performed a high energy version of her song \"Since U Been Gone\" barefoot wearing a graphic belly top and capri pants.

Kelly performed his rap opera, \"Trapped in the Closet\".\nAnimated duo Beavis and Butt-head appeared in several Viewer's Choice award skits, saying to \"Vote to put Beavis and Butt-head back on MTV!\".

Hosted by Jack Black, there were also performances by Shakira with Wyclef Jean, Beyoncé, Christina Aguilera and The Killers.\n2007: the 2007 Video Music Awards was opened by Britney Spears performing her comeback single \"Gimme More\".  To many, Spears failed to live up to the pre-show hype. She wore black sequined lingerie and put in less energy than her previous performances. The performance was called \"career crippling\".\nKid Rock and Tommy Lee were involved in an altercation during Alicia Keys's performance. Lee was sitting with magician Criss Angel when the two went to visit Diddy, who was sitting close to Kid Rock. Kid Rock allegedly punched Tommy Lee in the face. The two were broken up, and both were escorted from the resort.

Bush a \"retarded cowboy\" and claimed Bush \"wouldn't be trusted with a pair of scissors in Britain\".\nRussell Brand also made comments on the Jonas Brothers for wearing purity rings. Brand later faced criticism for his swipes at the trio. He confirmed his apology at the MTV Video Music Awards 2009 by saying \"I upset the Jonas Brothers last year, I had to say sorry to them and they forgave me. They had to, they're Christians.\" During her introduction of T.I. and Rihanna's performance, Jordin Sparks, who also wears a purity ring, defended the boy-band by saying \"It's not bad to wear a promise ring because not everybody, guy or girl, wants to be a slut.\" Sparks was in turn criticized for implying that those who do not wear purity rings or do not abstain are promiscuous. taking the microphone from Taylor Swift at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards]]2009: at the 2009 Video Music Awards, singer-songwriter Taylor Swift won Best Female video for \"You Belong with Me\". During her acceptance speech, rapper Kanye West unexpectedly showed up on stage. Taking the microphone from Swift, he announced \"Yo Taylor, I'm really happy for you, and Imma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time. One of the best videos of all time!\". MTV cut away from the stage (showing Beyoncé with a shocked and disapproved look) after West gave the microphone back to Swift and giving the middle finger to the audience as they started booing him off stage, and so Swift did not finish her speech. West was removed for the rest of the show. However, when Beyoncé won Video of the Year for \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\", she called Swift back on stage to \"have her moment\" (finishing her speech from winning Best Female Video).

After her speech, a Michael Jackson tribute commenced, including Janet Jackson performing the duet \"Scream\".

Both singers took it humorously and posed together for the paparazzi.\nLady Gaga later performed her song \"Paparazzi\" and shocked the audience when she appeared to bleed out on stage. It was actually a contraption in her outfit. Beyoncé performed her song \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" with over two dozen female dancers dancing with her. Pink performed her single \"Sober\" while doing a trapeze act during the entire performance while singing live.\nRapper Lil Mama jumped on stage as Jay-Z and Alicia Keys performed \"Empire State of Mind\". Lil Mama later apologized.

Additionally, will.i.am's \"blackface\" outfit sparked controversy among African-Americans. Florence + the Machine performed \"Dog Days Are Over\".\nLady Gaga won eight awards, including Video of the Year, Best Female Video, and Best Pop Video for \"Bad Romance\"; she also won Best Collaboration for \"Telephone\" with Beyoncé. Upon accepting her Video of the Year award, Gaga wore a dress made entirely of raw meat, which drew criticism from PETA. While accepting her Video of the Year award, Lady Gaga announced the title of her next album, Born This Way, and sang the chorus of its title track and lead single. Justin Bieber won Best New Artist, making him the second youngest Canada-born artist to ever win a VMA (first being Avril Lavigne in 2002).\nOverall, the show grabbed 11.4 million viewers—the largest audience for an MTV Video Music Awards since 2002, and until 2011's new record.\n2011: the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards returned to the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, California.

However, some publications such as The Washington Post and HuffPost opined that the stature of the ceremony had declined by 2019. HuffPost cited reasons such as a lack of interest (declining attendances and viewership: in 2019 ratings hit an all-time low for the third straight year), lack of musical diversity, lack of celebrity, lack of credibility, and access to music online. The Washington Post states, \"The moment the VMAs ceased to matter might have happened in 2014, when Drake didn't bother appearing to receive his award. Or maybe it was even earlier than that: The Associated Press compared the energy of the VMAs to the scripted reality-TV show Cribs all the way back in 2006.\" MTV has also faced criticism for devoting most of its airtime outside the VMAs to reality shows and dramas, with music videos mainly airing in off-peak graveyard slots to suffice the minimum amount of music programming in the network's carriage agreements.\nRatings\nRatings are not available prior to 1994 because MTV was not subscribing to Nielsen Media Research's program ratings prior to 1994. The field \"Cumulative viewers\" shows the audience of the live simulcasts of the ceremony across many ViacomCBS channels as a whole.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
