The convoy departed Loch Ewe, Scotland on 2 September 1942, rendezvoused with more ships and escorts at Iceland and arrived at Arkhangelsk on 21 September. An exceptionally large number of escorts were provided by the Royal Navy in Operation EV, including the first escort carrier to accompany an Arctic convoy. Detailed information on German intentions was provided by the code breakers at Bletchley Park and elsewhere, through Ultra signals decrypts and eavesdropping on Luftwaffe wireless communications.  The German  code-breakers read some British signals and the Luftwaffe used the lull in convoys after Convoy PQ 17 (27 June – 10 July) to prepare a maximum effort with the Kriegsmarine.\nFrom 12 to 21 September Convoy PQ 18 was attacked by bombers, torpedo-bombers, U-boats and mines, which sank thirteen ships at a cost of forty-four aircraft and four U-boats. The convoy was defended by escort ships and the aircraft of the escort carrier  which used signals intelligence gleaned from Ultra and Luftwaffe wireless frequencies to provide early warning of some air attacks and to attempt evasive routeing of the convoy around concentrations of U-boats. United States Navy Armed Guard and British Naval and Royal Artillery Maritime Regiment gunners were embarked on the freighters to operate anti-aircraft guns and barrage balloons, which made air attacks more difficult and because of inexperience, occasionally wounded men and damaged ships and cargo, with wild shooting.\nThe convoy handed over its distant escorts and Avenger to the homeward bound Convoy QP 14 near Archangelsk on 16 September and continued with the close escort and local escorts, riding out a storm in the Northern Dvina estuary and the last attacks by the Luftwaffe, before reaching Archangelsk on 21 September. Several ships ran aground in the storm but all were eventually refloated; unloading the convoy took a month. Because of its losses and the transfer in November of its most effective remaining aircraft to the Mediterranean to oppose Operation Torch, the Luftwaffe effort could never be repeated.\nAftermath\nAnalysis\nIn the official history (1956 [1962]) Stephen Roskill called Convoy PQ 18 an Allied success. The convoy operation brought 28 ships safely to their destinations and the Arctic convoy route, which had been suspended since the loss of Convoy PQ 17, was open again. In 2001, Werner Rahn wrote that the  (SKL, Naval War Staff) had called the results \"dearly bought and unsatisfactory\". In 2004, Richard Woodman referred to Convoy PQ 18 as a Pyrrhic victory. The Luftwaffe torpedo-bomber attacks, while costly, had been highly effective and would have inflicted more losses had not the British Headache operators not given early warning of some attacks, which enabled Sea Hurricanes to be scrambled in time. The Germans failed to prevent the convoy reaching Russia and their losses, particularly in trained pilots, were severe, reducing the ability of the Luftwaffe to repeat its anti-convoy operation. Attacks on Avenger had been defeated and the depth of the escort screen made torpedo attacks on the centre of the convoy extravagantly risky. Coastal Command operations in support of Convoy PQ 18 and the returning convoy QP 14, involved 111 aircraft from 14 squadrons, which flew 279 sorties and logged 2,290 flying hours, most being taken up by the fights to and from the convoy. In November, Luftflotte 5, the German air command in Norway and Finland, was ordered to transfer its Ju 88 and He 111 torpedo-bombers to the Mediterranean against Operation Torch, a decision which the British received through Ultra intercepts. Only the Heinkel He 115 floatplanes, suitable for torpedo attacks on stragglers and some Junkers Ju 87 dive-bombers remained in Norway, along with a few long-range reconnaissance aircraft to observe for the surface and U-boat forces.\nCasualties\nRoskill in 1962 and Woodman in 2004 wrote that the Germans managed to sink thirteen merchant ships for a loss of four U-boats and 44 aircraft, 38 of them being torpedo-bombers and six long-range bombers and reconnaissance aircraft. Michael Howard, in 1972, recorded that the Allies lost 38 aircraft from 309, 126 tanks from 448 and 85 of the 106 lorries carried in the merchant ships. Convoy PQ 19 was assembled at Loch Ewe but not dispatched, a net loss to the Allied war effort.\nAllied order of battle\nConvoy, Loch Ewe to Archangel\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable nowraplinks\"\n|+ Loch Ewe to Archangel\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"150px\"|Name\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"25px\" |Year\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"110px\"|Flag\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"25px\" |GRT\n! |Notes\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| SS Africander||align=\"left\"|1921||align=\"left\"| ||align=\"right\"|5,441 ||Sunk in air attack\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|1930 ||align=\"left\"|  ||align=\"right\"|8,992||Damaged by  Sunk by , 16 casualties\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  ||align=\"left\"|1920 ||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|5,976||Engine trouble, returned Loch Ewe\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  ||align=\"left\"|1919 ||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|5,671||\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  ||align=\"left\"|1920 ||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|6,027||\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|1923 ||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|1,526||Rescue ship\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  ||align=\"left\"|1940 ||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|5,117||Vice-Convoy Commodore\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|1941 ||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|6,978||\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|||align=\"left\"|1942 ||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|7,044||Sunk in air attack\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|||align=\"left\"|1941 ||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|7,092||CAM ship\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|SS Empire Snow||align=\"left\"|1941 ||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|6,327||\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|SS Empire Stevenson||align=\"left\"|1941 ||align=\"left\"| ||align=\"right\"|6,209|| Sunk in air attack\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|SS Empire Tristram||align=\"left\"|1942 ||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|7,167||\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  ||align=\"left\"|1942 ||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|7,191||\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  ||align=\"left\"|1929 ||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|5,851||\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  ||align=\"left\"|1920 ||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|5,498||\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|SS John Penn||align=\"left\"|1942 ||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|7,177||Sunk in air attack\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|SS Kentucky||align=\"left\"|1921 ||align=\"left\"| ||align=\"right\"|5,446 || Sunk in air attack\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  ||align=\"left\"|1919 ||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|5,887||\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  ||align=\"left\"|1920 ||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|4,941||Sunk in air attack\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|1919 ||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|5,049||Sunk in air attack\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  ||align=\"left\"|1921 ||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|6,061||\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  ||align=\"left\"| 1942||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|7,177||\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  ||align=\"left\"|1942 ||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|7,174||\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|1918 ||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|6,894||Fleet oiler Joined from Spitzbergen group\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|||align=\"left\"|1942 ||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|7,191||Sunk by  1 casualty\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| SS Oregonian ||align=\"left\"|1917 ||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|4,862||Sunk in air attack\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  ||align=\"left\"|1941 ||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|7,191||\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  ||align=\"left\"|1919 ||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|5,028||\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  ||align=\"left\"|1919 ||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|4,971||\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  ||align=\"left\"|1942 ||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|7,191||\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  ||align=\"left\"|1940 ||align=\"left\"|||align=\"right\"|5,138||Flagship Convoy Commodore E.
