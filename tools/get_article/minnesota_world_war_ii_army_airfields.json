However the other USAAF support commands (Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); Air Transport Command (ATC) or Troop Carrier Command) commanded a significant number of airfields in a support roles.\nIt is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor Airfields\nAir Transport Command\n* Minneapolis MAP, Minneapolis\n: Joint use USAAF/Civil Airport\n: Now: Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport and  Minneapolis-Saint Paul Joint Air Reserve Station\nAir Technical Service Command\n* Holman Field/St. Paul MAP, St. Paul\n: Joint use USAAF/Civil Airport\n: Now: St. Paul Downtown Airport\nArmy Air Force Training Command\n* Flynn Field/Lake Elmo APT, Lake Elmo\n: Contract flying training\n: Now: Lake Elmo Airport\n* Monticello AAF, Monticello\n: Contract flying training/Glider training\n: Now: Returned to agriculture.\n* Lobb Field/Rochester AAF, Rochester\n: Contract flying training/Glider training\n: Closed 1961.
