Despite administration of the Kayin State Government, the town has been controlled de facto by the KNU for six years.\nSince the February 2021 coup, anti-coup protesters and those who joined the civil disobedience movement came to Lay Kay Kaw to evade the military and receive guerrilla training.\nBattle\nOn 14 December 2021, the Tatmadaw raided Lay Kay Kaw, arresting dozens of former NLD members and other anti-regime activists.\nDays after the raid, the KNLA and PDF forces clashed with Myanmar Army troops, who resorted to airstrikes and heavy artillery. Due to these strikes, at least 2500 local villagers fled to Mae Sot, border town in Thailand. After a shell landed in a sugarcane plantation, and a small fire broke out, Thai authorities, through Thai–Myanmar Border Committee, issued a warning that \"it was prepared to retaliate if stray artillery shells landed on Thai soil\", and Thai armed forces were deployed in the border area. On 20 December, KNU urged the UN and international community to establish the area as a no-fly zone.\nSometime during late 2022, the Myanmar junta captured the town. However, by 31 March 2024, anti-junta forces retook Lay Kay Kaw.\nReferences"
