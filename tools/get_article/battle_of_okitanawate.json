In 1582 he attacked the Arima clan and Arima Harunobu decided to ask the help of Shimazu Yoshihisa. Yoshihisa sent an army in December of that year but not much progress was made until 1584. When the army was reorganized and commanded by the able Shimazu Iehisa, younger brother of Yoshihisa, the allies put Shimabara under siege and Takanobu marched to relieve the castle with his main army.\nOn May 3 the Shimazu-Arima army entrenched on a hill in front of Shimabara and received the attack of the Ryūzōji who were well armed with muskets, including high calibre ones. They attacked the hill in three columns, one advancing along the road, another advancing along the hills and a third along the beach.\nThey were harassed by the Arima with large caliber arquebuses mounted on boats. The columns were defeated when the Shimazu enticed the Ryūzōji into a false retreat, Harunobu attacked the enemy's main force, and Shimazu retainer, , allowing a flying column of samurai to take Ryūzōji Takanobu's head.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.city.shimabara.lg.jp/page2910.html Site of the Battle of Okitanawate / Shimabara City] (Japanese)"
