Born on GeoCities as “Slayer’s BattleTech Page” (“Slayer” was the owner Nic Jansma's handle at a BattleTech Center in Chicago, IL) and moving to the domain of sarna.net in 1998. Nic would after having many other fan projects be hosted on the platform make the Mediawiki that became BTW on 8 September 2006, in an attempt to organize the massive amount of information those projects had accumulated. The wiki would then grow from that point, expanding into all areas of the Battletech Franchise and the fandom in general.\nthe wiki contains over 61,570 articles.\nControversies\nFanon\nOriginally BTW would welcome fan-made content (such as fan fiction and fan made designs) to be created on it. However, by May 2011, a consensus was reached by the active users of BTW calling for a change to its overall policy and focus to being strictly encyclopedic from canon sources. As a result, numerous pieces of fan fiction, fan designs, their associated talk pages, and files were copied over to [https://battletechfanon.fandom.com/wiki/BattleTech_Fanon_Wiki Fandom hosted Wiki], and then subsequently deleted on BTW.\nMoratorium\nAccording to BTW's policy page on Moratorium:\nSee also\n* List of fan wikis\n* List of online encyclopedias\n* List of wikis\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
