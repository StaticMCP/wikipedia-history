They were members of the Midwest Division of the National Conference of the af2. The Swarm joined the af2 as an expansion franchise in 2003 along with the Green Bay Blizzard. In 2003, the Swarm went 7–9, second in the Midwest Division. Despite their modest record, and finishing second in their division, they failed to make the playoffs. Cincinnati's attempt at arena football failed, and the Swarm folded after one year due to poor attendance. Ten years earlier, Cincinnati was home to the Cincinnati Rockers from 1992 to 1993, and like the Swarm, they folded shortly after their inception. Despite the Swarm's failure, the city of Cincinnati would get another af2 franchise in the form of the now-defunct Cincinnati Jungle Kats, who suffered the same fate as the Swarm.\nSeason-by-Season\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\"|ArenaCup Champions\n|bgcolor=\"#DDFFDD\"|ArenaCup Appearances\n|bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\"|Division Champions\n|bgcolor=\"#96CDCD\"|Playoff Berth\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; width:70%;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%;\"|Season\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%;\"|League\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%;\"|Conference\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Division\n!colspan=\"3\"|Regular season\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Postseason results\n|-\n!Finish\n!Wins\n!Losses\n|-\n|Colspan=\"8\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"black\" |Cincinnati Swarm\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 2003 || AF2 || National || Midwestern || 2nd || 7 || 9 ||\n|}\nRoster\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|-\n! colspan=7 style=\"; text-align:center;\"| Cincinnati Swarm roster\n|-\n| style=\"font-size: 95%;\" valign=\"top\" | Quarterbacks\nFullbacks/Linebackers\nWide receivers/Defensive backs\n| style=\"width: 25px;\" |\n| style=\"font-size: 95%;\" valign=\"top\" | Offensive/Defensive linemen\n| style=\"width: 25px;\" |\n| style=\"font-size: 95%;\" valign=\"top\" | Wide Receivers/Linebackers\nDefensive specialists\nKickers\n*Currently vacant\n| style=\"width: 25px;\" |\n| style=\"font-size: 95%;\" valign=\"top\" | Injured reserve\n*Currently vacant\nRookies in italics\n19 Active, 0 Inactive\n|-\n|}\nHead coach\nChris MacKeown - After the Swarm folded in 2003 MacKeown went on to be the offensive coordinator for the Louisville Fire (af2) for the 2004 and 2005 seasons.
