      "text": "# List of Walt Disney's World War II productions for Armed Forces\n\nThe following is a list of training films produced for the United States Army and Navy by the Walt Disney Studio during World War II. Most of these films were not sole productions of Disney, but were collaborations with other entities such as the First Motion Picture Unit (FMPU) or Frank Capra's signal corps.\nDisney only produced the animated portions of these films. Many Disney artists and animators (as well as artists from other animation studios) worked at FMPU simultaneously, so not all FMPU films that include animation are Disney products.\nIn many cases the studio did not receive credit, which has made the task of identification somewhat difficult. Additionally, many of these films were reissued and even retitled, re-numbered and even re-edited, so the original elements may not survive.\nTh information on this list comes from various sources such as the long out of print book Donald Duck Joins Up by Richard Shale and other film indexes that deal with Army and Navy films.\nProduction for Armed Forces\nPropaganda series and films\nNote: Walt Disney Productions is uncredited on all films in this section.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Client\n!Series title\n!Film title (total runtime)\n!Disney produced runtime\n!Date\n!Notes\n|-\n| U.S Army\n|Why We Fight\n|Prelude to War (53 min)\n| 16 min\n| 1942\n|This series was produced by Frank Capra; the Disney studio produced various animated inserts (maps).
