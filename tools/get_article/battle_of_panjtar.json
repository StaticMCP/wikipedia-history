The chief Fateh Khan had teamed up with Syed Ahmad Barelvi against the Sikhs.\nBattle\nFateh Khan had started making disturbances towards the Sikhs in 1836. Hari Singh Nalwa with a force of 14–15,000 troops attacked Panjtar and defeated Fateh Khan. It was reported that 15,000 pashtuns fled before the Sikhs. Many were killed and the rest were taken refuge to the hills. The chief was forced to sign a document stating his submission to the Sikh Empire.\nAftermath\nAfter this battle, Fateh Khan began to act like he never signed a document towards his submission and continued to harass the Sikhs. The Maharaja sent Gulab Singh to settle the deal and all the Yusufzais fled to the mountains.\nSee also\n* Nihang\n* Martyrdom and Sikhism\nReferences"
