He was also a poet of a new dimension–the third dimension–meaning Tesro Ayam in the history of Nepalese literature. He, along with his contemporaries Bairagi Kaila and Indra Bahadur Rai, formed a trio in 1963 in Darjeeling to rethink and evaluate the development of Nepalese literature.\nBibliography\n*Aagoka Phoolharu Hun Aagoka Phoolharu Hoinanan\n*Samanantar\n*Kashmai Devaya\n*Euta Saharko Kinarama\nSee also\n*List of Nepalese poets\nReferences"
