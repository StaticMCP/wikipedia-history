The party was formed in opposition to then-Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews.\nHistory\nRestore Democracy Sack Dan Andrews was registered by the Victorian Electoral Commission (VEC) as a political party on 28 October 2022, after applying for registration on 18 August 2022.\nOn 16 November 2022, Australian Values Party leader Heston Russell leaked a video to the Herald Sun of him talking to Glenn Druery about a potential preference deal. In the video, Druery claims that he controls a number of minor parties and that Restore Democracy Sack Dan Andrews is \"one of mine\". Finnigan denied the allegations and said Druery had \"fuck all involvement\" in setting up the party.\nAt the 2022 Victorian state election, RDSD received 0.83% of the statewide legislative council vote. Finnigan ran in the Western Victoria Region and was unsuccessful at getting elected.\nIn January 2023, Finnigan was elected via a countback to the Colac Otway Shire Council, becoming the first openly transgender councillor in the history of Victoria.\nThe party was deregistered in December 2023, three months after Andrews resigned as premier, after it \"failed to provide up to date information and documents\" to the VEC.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
