Following his victory at the battle of Atlanta, General William Tecumseh Sherman wanted to destroy Confederate grain supplies in northeastern Georgia to hinder the Confederate war effort, and to support General Ulysses S. Grant at the Siege of Petersburg, Virginia, since the grain was used to feed the Confederate armies.\nThe Battle\nSherman sent Kenner Garrard to go raid and capture the mostly undefended region of northeastern Georgia. Union forces arrived in the narrows outside of Currahee Mountain, and following a quick battle, the Union forces withdrew. The defense was mostly organized by locals. Casualties on both sides were few, with locals helping the wounded on both sides.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
