It was founded by Birtukan Midekssa on 20 June 2008, based on the parties that constituted the Coalition for Unity and Democracy. It was a major component in the eight-party Medrek coalition, the largest opposition coalition in the 2010 election. In May 2019, the party merged with the Ethiopian Citizens for Social Justice, bringing an end to the party.\nOverview\nThe Unity for Democracy and Justice Party (UDJP), commonly known as Andenet (Amharic for Unity), is an Ethiopian national opposition political party established by former leaders and members of Coalition for Unity and Democracy Party (CUD). Andenet is a short form of UDJP's Amharic name, Andenet ledemocracy ena lefitih. It was formed by former CUD leaders and members advocating for free and fair Ethiopian elections in the then-upcoming 2010 elections. The UDJP was chaired and vice-chaired by Birtukan Midekssa and Yakob Haile-Mariam, respectively. Both were detained and sentenced to life in prison before they were controversially pardoned on 6 October 2008 and September 2007, respectively. Their arrests were considered by Ethiopian political opposition parties as a Majority Government attempt to block fair and free election and democratic process.\nCurrent performances\nUDJP was formed with 42 parliament members and the representatives of former CUD leaders and members on 17 June 2008.
