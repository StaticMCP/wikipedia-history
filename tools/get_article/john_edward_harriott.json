      "text": "# John Edward Harriott\n\nJohn Edward Harriott (c. 1797 &ndash; 7 February 1866) was a fur trader who worked for the Hudson's Bay Company.\nA Londoner who entered the trade at age 17, Harriott was a dedicated and prosperous worker. He climbed through the ranks of the Hudson's Bay Company to become a chief factor for the Saskatchewan District.  He retired in 1855 after a career of nearly four decades.\nWhile a fur trader, Harriott entered into two marriages, both with daughters of HBC fur-traders by Native American or Métis wives.  His first wife, Elizabeth Pruden, was the daughter of John Peter Pruden, who was a Chief Trader and in 1836 was commissioned a Chief Factor.  Although the marriage was not conducted by clergy when Harriott married Elizabeth he made a solemn promise to live with her as his wife until her death. Later when Harriott married Nancy Rowand, the daughter of John Rowand and his half-French-Canadian, half-Cree wife Louise Unfreville, the marriage was performed by a Catholic priest.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=4479 Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online]"
