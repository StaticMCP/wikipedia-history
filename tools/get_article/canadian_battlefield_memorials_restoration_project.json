Collectively, these memorials are symbolic of the Canadians and Newfoundlanders who gave their lives during the First World War, and are physical reminders that their sacrifices and victories must never be forgotten.\nIn May 2001, the Government of Canada announced the $30-million restoration project. The repair work required to rehabilitate these memorial sites, now an average of 75 years old, is beyond the scope of routine maintenance. The program of work is being carried out in collaboration with Public Works and Government Services Canada, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and other specialists, consultants and military historians. The work is separated into four project areas, with the restoration of the Canadian National Vimy Memorial being the main priority.\nOn April 2, 2007 restoration of the last memorial site, the Canadian National Vimy Memorial, was officially completed and the site was re-opened to the public.\nRestored memorials\n;Eight of these memorials stand on notable Canadian battlefields in France and Belgium:\n* Vimy Ridge Memorial - [http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=memorials/ww1mem/vimy Canadian Veterans' Affairs web page]\n* Bourlon Wood Memorial - [https://web.archive.org/web/20081210232012/http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=memorials%2Fww1mem%2Fbourlon Canadian Veterans' Affairs web page]\n* Courcelette Memorial - [https://web.archive.org/web/20081210201041/http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=memorials%2Fww1mem%2Fcourcelette Canadian Veterans' Affairs web page]\n* Dury Memorial - [http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=memorials/ww1mem/dury Canadian Veterans' Affairs web page]\n* Hill 62 Memorial - [https://web.archive.org/web/20081202000135/http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=memorials%2Fww1mem%2Fhill62 Canadian Veterans' Affairs web page]\n* Le Quesnel Memorial - [http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=memorials/ww1mem/le_quesnel Canadian Veterans' Affairs web page]\n* Passchendaele Memorial - [https://web.archive.org/web/20101205150408/http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=memorials%2Fww1mem%2Fpasschen Canadian Veterans' Affairs web page]\n* Saint Julien Memorial - [http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=memorials/ww1mem/stjulien Canadian Veterans' Affairs web page]\n;Five other memorials mark places of historical significance to the then Dominion of Newfoundland:\n* Beaumont-Hamel - [https://web.archive.org/web/20090301194216/http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=memorials%2Fww1mem%2Fbeaumonthamel Canadian Veterans' Affairs web page]\n* Gueudecourt (Newfoundland) Memorial - [https://web.archive.org/web/20101205213816/http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=memorials%2Fww1mem%2Fgueudecourt Canadian Veterans' Affairs web page]\n* Monchy-le-Preux - [http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=memorials/ww1mem/monchy Canadian Veterans' Affairs web page]\n* Masnières - [https://web.archive.org/web/20081210143714/http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=memorials%2Fww1mem%2Fmasnieres Canadian Veterans' Affairs web page]\n* Courtrai - [http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=memorials/ww1mem/courtrai Canadian Veterans' Affairs web page]\nReferences"
