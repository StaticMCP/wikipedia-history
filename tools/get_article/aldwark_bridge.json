The ferryman in 1768 was John Thomson, and that year, he rode to London to seek permission to construct a bridge, in exchange for collecting tolls.  This was granted in the  (12 Geo. 3. c. 87), and the bridge opened in 1772.  It originally had brick piers and a wooden deck.  In 1848, it was described as \"a substantial wooden structure, which crosses the river and its banks by twenty-seven arches and culverts\". A local legend claims that it was once damaged by an iceberg. In 1880, the central section of the bridge was destroyed during a flood, and the bridge was largely rebuilt, using an iron frame.\nBy 1962, the bridge was owned by Yorkshire Farmers Ltd. The company offered to sell it to the North Riding of Yorkshire County Council, but the council was uninterested, and it remained in private hands. It remains a toll bridge, thought to be the last one wholly in Yorkshire since the fee for crossing Selby toll bridge was abolished in 1991.\n| type                  = Statutory Instrument\n| parliament            = Parliament of the United Kingdom\n| year                  = 2005\n| citation              = SI 2005/2117\n| introduced_commons    =\n| introduced_lords      =\n| territorial_extent    =\n| si_made_date          = 14 July 2005\n| si_laid_date          =\n| commencement          = 29 July 2005\n| expiry_date           =\n| repeal_date           =\n| amends                =\n| replaces              =\n| primary_legislation   =\n| eu_directives         =\n| amendments            =\n| repealing_legislation =\n| related_legislation   =\n| status                =\n| legislation_history   =\n| theyworkforyou        =\n| millbankhansard       =\n| original_text         =\n| revised_text          =\n| use_new_UK-LEG        =\n| UK-LEG_title          =\n| collapsed             = yes\n}}\n| type                  = Statutory Instrument\n| parliament            = Parliament of the United Kingdom\n| year                  = 1997\n| citation              = SI 1997/\n| introduced_commons    =\n| introduced_lords      =\n| territorial_extent    =\n| si_made_date          =\n| si_laid_date          =\n| commencement          =\n| expiry_date           =\n| repeal_date           =\n| amends                =\n| replaces              =\n| primary_legislation   =\n| eu_directives         =\n| amendments            =\n| repealing_legislation =\n| related_legislation   =\n| status                =\n| legislation_history   =\n| theyworkforyou        =\n| millbankhansard       =\n| original_text         =\n| revised_text          =\n| use_new_UK-LEG        =\n| UK-LEG_title          =\n| collapsed             = yes\n}}\nThe toll can only be increased by permission of the Secretary of State for Transport; it was doubled to one penny in 1980, while in 2005, it rose from 15p to 40p. The bridge was purchased by Alex Bell in 2021. In 2022, permission was refused to increase the toll to 80p. In January 2025, Bell announced his intention to raise the toll from 40p to £1, with a future hike to £1.40 scheduled for 2035. The increase was criticised by local teachers who feared the increased cost would prevent children living on one side of the bridge from attending school on the other side. A public enquiry into the fee increase was held in Easingwold in March 2025, and the increase was agreed.\nThe bridge was grade II listed in 1988. The bridge was used by 700,000 vehicles over the course of 1997.\nIt closed in April 2023 for maintenance. The bridge reopened on 17 February 2024. The cost of the maintenance was variously reported as being £1&nbsp;million or £700,000.\nThe bridge has an iron frame and a timber deck, with one brick arch surviving, supported by a sandstone cutwater. There are also surviving brick and sandstone arches over floodlands at the side of the river. The section over the river consists of four spans.\nSee also\n*Listed buildings in Aldwark, Hambleton\n*Listed buildings in Great Ouseburn\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=2| Bridges over the River Ure\n|-\n|Upstream: Borough Bridge\n|Downstream: Skelton Bridge\n|}"
