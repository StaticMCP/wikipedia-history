The Ministry of Defense of the United Kingdom stated that Russia was prioritizing attacks on Ukrainian medical facilities as a method of warfare, often striking these, as well as power infrastructure with Iranian-made drones such as Shahed 131, Shahed 136.\nLatest figures\nAs of 21 December 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,422 attacks on health care reported by their 'Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care' (SSA) tool.\nThe WHO, in an article published on 22 February 2024, reported 1,574 verified attacks on health, and the deaths of 118 health-care workers, since the start of the full scale illegal invasion of Ukraine.\nAs of 4 April 2024, WHO verified 1682 attacks on health care in Ukraine, resulting in 128 deaths and 288 injuries of medical personnel and patients.\nAs of 10 July 2024 Physicians for Human Rights \"Attacks on Health Care in Ukraine\" website counted 1442 attacks on health care facilities, out of which 742 destroyed hospitals and clinics, killing 210 health workers.\nOn 8 July 2024, Human Rights Watch reported of 1,736 damaged or destroyed medical facilities.\nHistory of attacks\nRussia has a history of employing systematic attacks on medical facilities as a tactic of war. Human rights organizations operating in Syria state that Russian Federation is deliberately using GPS coordinates handed over to them by the UN's deconfliction line as a list of targets. This became such a problem, that doctors refused to share their coordinates with the UN in an attempt to avoid Russian attacks. Eventually the Russian Federation left the UN program claiming it was in protest of the UN not sharing the list with their Syrian ally, who likewise, engaged in a campaign of attacks against healthcare facilities. Russian state media had been routinely justifying attacks on civilian objects, destruction of towns and inciting extermination of civilian population in Ukraine.\nMilestones\nBetween February 24 and March 21, 2022, sixty-four medical facilities and their personnel were targeted by Russian forces in Ukraine, the WHO reported.\nBy March 25, 2022, the facilities were being hit at rate of two to three a day. Mostly with heavy weapons.\nBy April 8, 2022, there were 91 attacks confirmed by the WHO, averaging 2 attacks on hospitals, ambulances or medical supply depots per day.\nBy November 21, 2022, there were at least 703 attacks on Ukrainian healthcare facilities with 144 such facilities completely destroyed by Russia.\nBy the end of 2022, nearly one in ten Ukrainian hospitals had been damaged.\nThe Centre for Information Resilience (CIR) found that Russia has \"deliberately and repeated\" targeted Kherson city's medical facilities between December 2022, and May 2023.\nBy May 30, 2023, the WHO had verified 1,000 attacks, the highest number ever recorded. Other monitoring groups have also marked the milestone 1000th attack, though using different metrics. Collectively this constitutes almost daily, deliberate instances of war crimes on a massive scale.\nBy February 22, 2024, the WHO regional direct confirmed that there had been \"over 1500\" attacks reported.\nThe UN reported 131 additional attacks on health infrastructure in their February 21, 2024, report. This seems to be since January 2024.\nNotable events\nA deadly attack occurred on the first day of the war, February 24, 2022, at the Central City Hospital in Vuhledar when a Russian ballistic missile full of cluster munitions fell just outside of the hospital, killing four and injuring ten.\nThe most widely covered attack was the bombing of the Mariupol maternity hospital.\nOn 23 November 2022, Russian missile strikes destroyed a maternity ward in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region, in the town of Vilnyansk, killing a newborn baby.\nOn July 8, 2024, Russian cruise missiles attacked children's hospitals in Kyiv and Dnipro.\nSee also\n* Russian–Syrian hospital bombing campaign\n* War crimes in the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Attacks on health facilities during the Gaza war\n* Russian war crimes\n* Russian war crimes during the Syrian civil war\n* War crimes in the Syrian civil war\nReferences"
