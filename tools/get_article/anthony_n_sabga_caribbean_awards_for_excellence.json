Sabga, one of the Caribbean's most celebrated entrepreneurs and founder and chairman emeritus of the ANSA McAL Group of Companies in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.\nThe awards are meant to recognise and reward excellence in the Caribbean region, and create an awareness of the significant work done in the region that benefits Caribbean people, and all people worldwide. The Sabga Awards programme is the only institution of its kind in the Caribbean. Launched in 2005, prizes are awarded in the spheres of Arts & Letters, Science & Technology, and Public & Civic Contributions. The first laureates were named in 2006, and were presented with a cash prize of (TT)$500,000 (US$83,000), a gold medal, and a citation.

Advertisements are placed in the media throughout the English-speaking Caribbean stating criteria and inviting nominations. Applications are passed to the nominating committees in five countries: Guyana, Trinidad & Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica, and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). Each CNC then makes its selections, and the candidates are subjected to a rigorous research and vetting procedure. Once candidates are found to meet the criteria, the CNCs make selections and present them to the EPP, which makes the final adjudication. Announcements are then made via press conference to regional media, such as the Trinidad Guardian, the St Lucia Voice, and the Stabroek News  in Guyana.\nThe awards are then made at a ceremony in Trinidad. The awards have been biennial since 2006, but at the 2010 ceremony held on April 17, 2010 at the Hilton, Trinidad, Sabga announced that the awards would henceforth be made yearly.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ansacaribbeanawards.com The Anthony N Sabga Caribbean Awards for Excellence]"
