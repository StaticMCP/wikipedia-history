The song's original working title was \"Uncomparable\", however, the music publishing company asked Gordon to change it to \"Unforgettable\". The song was published in 1951.\nNat King Cole version\nThe most popular version of the song was recorded by Nat King Cole, in 1951, from his album, Unforgettable (1952), with an arrangement written by Nelson Riddle. A non-orchestrated version of the song, recorded in 1952, is featured as one of the seven bonus tracks on Cole's 1998 CD reissue of 1955's otherwise completely instrumental album, Penthouse Serenade. On March 30, 1961, Nat King Cole recorded the tune anew, in a stereo version (with Ralph Carmichael and his Orchestra) of the Riddle arrangement, for the album The Nat King Cole Story (1961).\nNatalie Cole had been performing this duet using a recorded track in her live show through the 1980s, then in 1991, after Elvis Presley's musical director Joe Guercio had the idea, Cole's original 1951 recording of the song was edited and reworked to create a duet with his daughter, Natalie. The remixed version reached number 14 on the Hot 100, matching the peak position of the original version on the Billboard Best-Selling Pop Singles chart, and also number three on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart.  The song also won three awards at the 34th Annual Grammy Awards (1992): Song of the Year, Record of the Year and Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance.\nNat Cole's original recording was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2000.\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1951–1952)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|US Billboard Best-Selling Pop Singles\n| align=\"center\"|14\n|-\n|US Billboard Best-Selling Sheet Music\n| align=\"center\"|15\n|-\n|US Billboard Records Most Played by Disk Jockeys\n| align=\"center\"|12\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1988)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|}\nCertifications\nNatalie Cole and Nat King Cole version\n| recorded      =\n| studio        =\n| venue         =\n| genre         =\n| length        = 3:29\n| label         = Elektra\n| writer        = Irving Gordon\n| producer      = David Foster\n| prev_title    = Wild Women Do\n| prev_year     = 1990\n| next_title    = The Christmas Song\n| next_year     = 1991\n| chronology    = Natalie Cole\n| misc          =\n}}\n}}\nAmerican singer Natalie Cole included a cover of the song on her twelfth album, Unforgettable... with Love (1991).
