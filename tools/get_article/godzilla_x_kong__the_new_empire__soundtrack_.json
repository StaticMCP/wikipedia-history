A sequel to Godzilla vs. Kong (2021), it is the fifth film in Legendary's MonsterVerse, the 38th film in the Godzilla franchise, the 13th film in the King Kong franchise, and the fifth Godzilla film to be completely produced by a Hollywood studio. Invasion of Astro-Monster was the first Godzilla film to be co-produced between a Japanese studio (Toho) and an American studio (UPA). The first Godzilla film to be completely produced by a Hollywood studio was TriStar's Godzilla (1998).}} Directed by Adam Wingard, the film features musical score written and composed by Tom Holkenborg (Junkie XL) and Antonio Di Iorio.\nOverview\nIn August 2022, Tom Holkenborg was announced to return to compose the film's score, after previously doing so for Godzilla vs. Kong. In December 2023, it was announced that Antonio Di Iorio would co-compose the score with Holkenborg. A single was released on March 13, 2024, by WaterTower Music, titled “Main Title Theme.” The full soundtrack album was released on March 22, 2024.\nThe theme song of the Japanese release is “Rise Together” by Yaffle and Ai.\nTrack listing\nThe official track list was unveiled on March 20, with a press release regarding the soundtrack release was confirmed by WaterTower Music on the same date.\nAdditional music\nIn the first trailer of Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire the  song which is heard is Jim Reeves' version of \"Welcome To My World.\" The song was first linked to the movie through one of the trailers. In the final cut, \"Welcome To My World\" can be heard during the opening scene and introduction to Hollow Earth. It plays as Kong runs through the Hollow Earth to introduce audiences to Kong's world. Other songs, which were heard in the movie are \"I Got'Cha\" by Greenflow, \"Twilight Zone\" by Golden Earring, \"Hardwired\" by Jordan F from The Guest, \"Turn Me Loose\" by Loverboy, \"I Was Made For Lovin' You\" by Kiss, \"Day After Day\" by Badfinger and finally \"Samba Toff\" by Orlann Divo.\nReception\nThe score received mixed reviews from critics. Zanobard, giving a review of 8 out of 10, wrote: \"Tom Holkenborg and Antonio Di Iorio’s thunderous Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire soundtrack acts as a louder, bolder older brother to GvK; the established Titan themes join forces with roaring new ones against the malevolent Skar King across this new album, making for some unapologetically epic and utterly deafening action setpieces as a result.\" Soundtrack Universe rated the score 3 and a half out of five, writing “Holkenborg and collaborator Di Iorio's score for Godzilla x Kong is a brawny, Saturday morning action cartoon styled romp with some surprisingly nuanced handling of thematic material accompanied by plenty of (slightly head scratching) retro 80's synth textures that is sure to please or annoy many.”\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n}}"
