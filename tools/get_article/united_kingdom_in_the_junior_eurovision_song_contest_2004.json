However, ITV abandoned the project due to finance and scheduling problems. It was therefore moved to Lillehammer in Norway.\nOn the night of the contest, Cory Spedding performed 13th in the running order of the contest, following Latvia and preceding Denmark. At the close of the voting Cory received 140 points, placing 2nd of the 18 competing entries, beaten by María Isabel of Spain.\nIn the United Kingdom, the show was televised on digital channel ITV2 (due to poor viewing figures the previous year) with commentary by Matt Brown. The British spokesperson, who announced the British votes during the final, was national finalist Charlie Allan. A delayed broadcast, consisting of highlights, was aired on ITV1 the following afternoon.\nVoting\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ Points awarded to the United Kingdom\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"20%\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" | Country\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 12 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 10 points\n| |||||||}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 8 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 7 points\n| ||}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 6 points\n| |}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 5 points\n| ||}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 4 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1 point\n|\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ Points awarded by the United Kingdom\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"20%\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" | Country\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:gold\" | 12 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:silver\" | 10 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#CC9966\" | 8 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 7 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 6 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 5 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 4 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1 point\n|\n|}\nReferences"
