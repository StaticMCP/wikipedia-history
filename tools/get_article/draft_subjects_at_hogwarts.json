It is the primary setting for the first six novels in the Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling, and also serves as a major setting in the Wizarding World media franchise.\nThe novels mention twelve subjects which are taught at Hogwarts. Astronomy, Charms, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, History of Magic, Potions, and Transfiguration are required subjects for the first five years. At the start of their third year, students must choose at least two additional subjects. The five elective subjects are Ancient Runes, Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination and Muggle Studies. Students must also take flying lessons during their first year, and may take Apparition lessons during their sixth year.\nAncient Runes\nAncient Runes is a generally theoretical subject that studies ancient runic scripts. It is taught by Bathsheda Babbling.   Hermione Granger is a notable student of the subject. It is an optional subject. It requires diligency and extreme wit.\nArithmancy\nArithmancy (also known as numerology) is a branch of magic concerned with the magical properties of numbers. It is a favourite subject of Hermione Granger. Arithmancy is taught by Septima Vector. It is one of the few optionals at Hogwarts.\nAstronomy\nAstronomy classes are held in the Astronomy tower and are taught by Aurora Sinistra. Lessons involve observation of the night sky with telescopes. It is one of the main subjects at Hogwarts. It also includes the studying of planets, their positions and changes in orbit.\nCare of Magical Creatures\nCare of Magical Creatures teaches students how to care for magical beasts. During Harry's first two years at Hogwarts, the class is taught by Silvanus Kettleburn. Starting in Harry's third year, Rubeus Hagrid is the professor. When Hagrid is absent, the class is taught by Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank. Harry, Ron and Hermione drop out of it after their fifth years owing to the subject's vagueness. Creatures often studied include Unicorns, Bowtruckles, Blast-Ended Screwts,  Hippogriffs,etc..\nCharms\nCharms is the class that teaches incantations for bewitchment. Rowling has described Charms as a type of magic concerned with giving objects new properties.Charms lessons are described in the novels as frequently noisy and chaotic. The subject is taught by Filius Flitwick.\nDefence Against the Dark Arts\nDefence Against the Dark Arts teaches practical techniques to defend against the magical Dark Arts. Throughout the series, the class is taught at various points by Quirinus Quirrell, Gilderoy Lockhart, Remus Lupin, Barty Crouch Jr (impersonating Alastor \"Mad-eye\" Moody), Dolores Umbridge, Severus Snape, and Amycus Carrow. Due to the fact that no professor remains in the position for more than a year, the Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore suggests that Voldemort jinxed the subject because his application to teach it was rejected. The existence of this jinx was eventually confirmed by Rowling. She said in an interview that after Voldemort dies, the jinx is lifted and a new professor teaches the subject for many years. In Deathly Hallows, Defence Against the Dark Arts is renamed \"Dark Arts\" when the Death Eaters take control of Hogwarts.\nDivination\nDivination is the art of predicting the future. The various methods of divination described in the novels include astrology, cartomancy, crystal ball consultation, dream interpretation, fire omens, palmistry, and reading tea leaves. Divination is described by Professor McGonagall as \"one of the most imprecise branches of magic\". Some wizards claim that the practice is fraudulent. Divination is taught by Sybill Trelawney. Divination is taught at the Divination tower of Hogwarts. After the sacking of Sybill Trelawney by Dolores Umbridge in The Order of the Phoenix, a centaur named Firenze was recruited to teach divination. From the 6th book, they shared lessons.\nHerbology\nHerbology is the study of magical plants and how to utilise, care for and combat them. The novels describe at least three Hogwarts greenhouses, which contain a variety of magical plants. The course is taught by Pomona Sprout. Some magical plants include Mandrakes, Venomous Tentacula, Devil's Snare, Mimbletus Mimbletonia, etc..\nHistory of Magic\nHistory of Magic is the study of magical and wizarding history. The subject is taught by the ghost professor Cuthbert Binns, whose lessons are depicted as some of the most boring at Hogwarts. But Hermione listens to the class. His lectures cover topics such as goblin rebellions, giant wars and the origins of wizarding secrecy. It was in this class that Binns said about the Chamber of Secrets to the students during Harry's second year.\nMuggle Studies\nMuggle Studies is a class that involves the study of Muggle culture from a wizarding point of view. Charity Burbage teaches Muggle Studies until she is murdered by Voldemort in Deathly Hallows. When the Death Eaters take control of Hogwarts, Alecto Carrow teaches the class. Her compulsory lessons describe Muggles and Muggle-borns as subhuman and worthy of persecution.\nPotions\nPotions is the art of creating mixtures with magical effects. It requires correct mixing and stirring of ingredients in the proper sequence and at the proper temperature. The subject is taught by Severus Snape during the first five novels and by Horace Slughorn in the final two books.\nSome notable potions include; Polyjuice potion, Draught of Living dead, Felix Felicis, Amortentia.\nTransfiguration\nTransfiguration is the science and art of changing the properties of an object or being. Transfiguration can alter an entire object or only part of the object. It can make objects vanish and it can conjure them out of thin air. It also covers about Animagi. Transfiguration can also change inanimate objects into animate ones and vice versa. The subject is taught by Minerva McGonagall. It is one of the most complex subjects at Hogwarts. Any slight change in the incantation would lead to drastic effects. It is similar to the Muggle world subject of Science because it involves studying the composition of matters of the transfiguring objects.  Transfiguration is a core subject at Hogwarts.\nFlying\nFlying is the class that teaches students how to fly on broomsticks. It is taught by Rolanda Hooch.\nApparition\nApparition is a form of teleportation which allows a wizard to disappear (\"Disapparate\") from one location and reappear (\"Apparate\") in another. A wizard must be at least 17 years old to Apparate. Students at Hogwarts may take Apparition lessons during their sixth year. It is taught by Ministry Employee, Mr. Twycross.
