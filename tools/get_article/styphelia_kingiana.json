It is an erect, compact shrub with sharply pointed, egg-shaped leaves, and white, tube-shaped flowers arranged in clusters near the ends of branchlets.\nDescription\nStyphelia kingiana is an erect, compact shrub that typically grows to a height of  and has densely hairy young branches. Its leaves are sharply-pointed, egg-shaped,  long and  wide. The flowers are borne in clusters near the ends of branchlets, extending past the leaves. There are egg-shaped, fleshy bracts  long and 3 or 4 almost round bracteoles  long at the base of the flowers. The sepals are egg-shaped,  long and pale yellowish-green. The petals are joined at the base to form a yellowish-green tube  long with white, spreading lobes  long. Flowering occurs in August and September and the fruit is dry,  long and  wide.\nTaxonomy\nStyphelia kingiana was first described in 1893 by Ferdinand von Mueller in The Victorian Naturalist from specimens collected near Lake Deborah (near Koolynobbing). The specific epithet (kingiana) honours Henry John King.\nDistribution and habitat\nThis styphelia occurs in sandy soils in open heath or low open woodland in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains, Mallee and Swan Coastal Plain bioregions of south-western Western Australia.\nConservation status\nStyphelia kingiana is listed as \"not threatened\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.\nReferences"
