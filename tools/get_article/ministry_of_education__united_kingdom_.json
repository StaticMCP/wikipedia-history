The Minister of Education appointed the members of each council which were mainly made-up of: -\n* Senior and experienced educators in the public education system (e.g. a senior experienced & highly qualified nursery nurse)\n* Scholars in the theories of learning who were often university professors\nThe Ministry of Education provided secretaries to the councils and funded their time, the Minister appointed the chairmen of the councils.\nThe councils advised the minister on questions raised by the minister or issues identified by the councils.\nThe advice was either made public through published reports or kept confidentially within the ministry.\nSee also\n* Education\n* Career and technical education\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://education-uk.org/history/timeline.html A timeline of education in England]"
