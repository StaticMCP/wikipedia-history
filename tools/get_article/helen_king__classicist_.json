She gained her doctorate at UCL in 1985 for a PhD on menstruation in ancient Greece supervised by Sarah C. (Sally) Humphreys. Her thesis was entitled ''From 'parthenos' to 'gyne': the Dynamics of Category.''\nAcademic career\nHaving completed her doctorate, King held research fellowships at the universities of Cambridge and Newcastle, taught at the Liverpool Institute of Higher Education for eight years, and moved to Reading on a Wellcome Trust University Award in 1996. From 2008 she was also visiting professor at the Peninsula Medical School in Truro. She moved to the Open University to assume the role of Professor of Classical Studies in 2011.

The US/Canada edition was published in January 2025 by [https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/helen-king/immaculate-forms/9781541606531/?lens=basic-books Basic Books]. Her first book Hippocrates' Woman: Reading the Female Body in Ancient Greece (1998) analysed the practice and theory of ancient medicine as relating to women and how it continues to influence thought to the present day. Immaculate Forms focuses on a similarly broad time period and investigates changing beliefs about the breasts, clitoris, hymen and womb.\nIn her 2007 book, Midwifery, Obstetrics and the Rise of Gynaecology: The Uses of a Sixteenth-Century Compendium'', she examined the uses of ancient medicine in a collection of ancient and medieval works on gynecology produced in three editions, the last being in 1597 by Israel Spach, and the different interpretations of this collection up to James Young Simpson in the nineteenth century.\nShe has also published on the myths of Tithonos, on mermaids, and on the myth/fable of Agnodice, \"the first midwife\". She has investigated how this story was used to give authority to women in medical roles in various historical periods.\nChurch of England\nKing was a member of the General Synod of the Church of England from 1985 to 1993 and from 2021 to 2026. As part of the 'Historical' thematic working group, she contributed to the Church's 2020 teaching document on human sexuality. She supports same-sex marriage.\nShe has also spoken about the history of Christianity in a podcast for the Historical Association.\nSelect publications\n* ''Hippocrates' Woman: Reading the Female Body in Ancient Greece (1998);\n*Greek and Roman Medicine (2001).\n*The Disease of Virgins: Green Sickness, Chlorosis and the Problems of Puberty (2004);\n* Health in Antiquity (2005);\n* Midwifery, Obstetrics and the Rise of Gynaecology: The Uses of a Sixteenth-Century Compendium (2007);\n* Blood, Sweat and Tears: The Changing Concepts of Physiology from Antiquity into Early Modern Europe (with Manfred Horstmansoff and Claus Zittel 2012);\n* La Médecine dans l' Antiquité grecque et romaine (with Véronique Dasen, 2008);\n* The One-Sex Body on Trial: The Classical and Early Modern Evidence (2013);\n*Hippocrates Now: The 'Father of Medicine' in the Internet Age (2019);\n*Immaculate Forms: Uncovering the History of Women's Bodies'' (2024)\nSee also\n* Diophantus of Abae\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://www.sas.ac.uk/videos-and-podcasts/classics/ancient-magic Ancient Magic]  - Helen King speaking at an event on Ancient Magic at the Institute of Classical Studies on Wednesday 31 October 2018"
