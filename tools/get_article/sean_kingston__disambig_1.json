Born in Miami, Florida, and raised in Jamaica, he signed with J. R. Rotem's record label Beluga Heights Records, in a joint venture with Koch and Epic Records in 2007.

His third album, Back 2 Life (2013), failed to chart and served as his final release on a major label, but spawned the moderate hit \"Beat It\" (featuring Chris Brown and Wiz Khalifa).\nAfter his second album, Kingston launched the record label Time Is Money Entertainment, through which he signed then-unknown Canadian singer Tory Lanez in 2010.\nIn July 2024, Kingston and his mother were indicted on several federal wire fraud charges.

In an interview with HitQuarters, label head and producer J. R. Rotem described this process with regard to Kingston:\n\"Sean Kingston was a rapper when we found him and it was a development process to get him more melodic. At Beluga we essentially refine the talent so that it's more of a marketable product.\"\nIn a venture between Epic Records and Koch Records, Kingston recorded and released the single \"Beautiful Girls\" in May 2007. \"Beautiful Girls\" was a major hit internationally, topping the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and several other charts, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland, Spain and the United Kingdom.

By 2018, he had begun to ride jet skis again.\nLegal issues\nMay 2024 fraud and theft charges\nOn May 23, 2024, Kingston's rented Southwest Ranches, Florida, mansion was raided by a police SWAT team and his mother was arrested. The federal arrest warrant was issued on several instances of alleged fraud and theft. Kingston was arrested a few hours later in California after a concert in Fort Irwin, and he was booked into jail in San Bernardino County. Kingston waived his right to fight extradition and was sent to Broward County jail in Florida. A week later, Kingston was released from police custody after posting bail of $100,000.\nJuly 2024 wire fraud charges\nOn July 19, 2024, a federal grand jury indicted Kingston and his mother on one count each of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and five counts each of wire fraud. The charges stem from their alleged involvement in a scheme to defraud sellers of high-end specialty vehicles, jewelry, and other goods purchased through fraudulent documents and wire transfers. It was reported that Kingston and his mother had $1 million worth of items they obtained fraudulently and did not pay for. For each count, Kingston and his mother faced up to 20 years in prison.\nThe charges follow a February lawsuit filed against Kingston by Ver Ver Entertainment, which claims Kingston did not pay for items such as luxury watches that he purchased. The lawsuit also alleges that Kingston claimed to have a \"current and ongoing working relationship\" with Justin Bieber and would be able to get Bieber to work on promotional videos on behalf of the company, even though the two had not made a song together since releasing \"Eenie Meenie\" in 2010.\nOn March 28, 2025, a jury convicted them on all charges. The judge put Kingston on house arrest with electronic monitoring. He is required to post a surety bond consisting of his $500,000 home plus $200,000 in cash. Turner was remanded to federal custody. Sentencing was originally set for July 11, 2025, but it was later moved to August 15 to allow Kingston more time to find an attorney. He was held at the Federal Detention Center, Miami after being unable to complete the bond.\nHis mother, Janice Turner, was sentenced to five years in prison on July 23, 2025. Kingston was sentenced to three and a half years in prison on August 15, 2025, followed by three years of supervised release.\nActivism\nKingston filmed a public service announcement with Do Something to encourage teens to become active in their communities by forming a Do Something club. In 2010, he appeared with one of his dogs in an ad for PETA, encouraging people not to chain their dogs outside.\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n* Sean Kingston (2007)\n* Tomorrow (2009)\n* Back 2 Life (2013)\n* Road to Deliverance (2021)\nAwards and nominations\n* Image Awards\n** 2008, Outstanding New Artist (Nominated)\n* MOBO Awards\n** 2007: Best Reggae Ever Acts (Win)\n* MTV Video Music Awards Japan\n** 2013: Best Reggae Video \"Back 2 Life (Live It Up)\" (Nominated)\n* Teen Choice Awards\n** 2007: Choice R&B Track \"Beautiful Girls\" (Win)\n** 2007: Choice Summer Track \"Beautiful Girls\" (Nominated)\n** 2009: Choice Summer Song \"Fire Burning\" (Nominated)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
