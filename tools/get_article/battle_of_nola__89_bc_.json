The Roman Republic, led by Sulla, defeated a rebel force led by the Pompeiian general Lucius Cluentius.\nBackground\nFollowing the death of the consul Lucius Porcius Cato at the Battle of Fucine Lake, Sulla assumed consular authority and campaigned the against Italian rebels in Campania, eventually arriving at Pompeii and laying siege to the town. While Sulla's army was encamped near Pompeii, a rebel relief force led by Cluentius arrived.\nBattle\nCluentius's army set up camp close to Sulla, and the Romans immediately marched out against the Pompeiian army. While the Romans were initially repulsed by Cluentius's army, they were eventually able to overpower them once the Roman foragers returned returned to the camp.\nAfter the battle was won, the Romans chased the rebels to Nola, killing around 3,000 rebels as they fled. Once the rebel army arrived at Nola, the inhabitants forced them to pass through a single gate, allowing the Roman army to catch up in pursuit. At Nola, an additional 20,000 rebels (including Cluentius) were killed, according to Appian.\nReferences"
