He was assisted by Denise (Daphne Gibson) and Natasha (Jan Goldin).\nThe pilot episode, \"There's a Car Upside-Down on My Lawn\", concerned the disposition of an abandoned vehicle. The episode won two Canadian Film Awards in 1969, for Best Director (Francis Chapman) and Best Actress in a Non-Feature (Josephine Barrington).\nJenny (Margot Kidder) was featured in two episodes as an employee of McQueen's newspaper. In one episode, she helped expose a scam at a talent agency while in the other she sought McQueen's help for a Vietnam draft evader she was dating.\nThe series was inspired by Frank Drea's Action Line column of the Toronto Telegram, whose newsroom was used to film scenes for the series.\nGuest actors during the series included Ruth Springford, Austin Willis, Henry Ramer and Louis Zorich.\nScheduling\nMcQueen was broadcast on Tuesdays at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. (Eastern) from 23 September 1969 until 18 September 1970.  The show was not well-received; by January, the newly installed head of CBC Entertainment was quoted in the Toronto Star as saying:  \"Everybody knows it's a failure now, but unfortunately we're stuck with it for the rest of the season.\"\nEpisodes\n|ShortSummary = McQueen rescues a victim from a social club with an outrageous contract, but discovers that some other members don't want to be rescued.\n|LineColor = D7F717\n}}\n|ShortSummary = McQueen confronts a discount vacuum salesman, whose $10 vacuums are worthless.\n|LineColor = D7F717\n}}\n|ShortSummary = McQueen sets out to expose a faith healer as a confidence trickster, but the reality is more complex.\n|LineColor = D7F717\n}}\n|ShortSummary = A North Bay motel owner asks McQueen to write about an expensive cigarette lighter left behind in a room -- which leads to a revelation of infidelity.\n|LineColor = D7F717\n}}\n|ShortSummary = McQueen goes up against an acting agency that rakes in money from would-be actors, but doesn't deliver employment.\n|LineColor = D7F717\n}}\n|ShortSummary = McQueen fights on behalf of tenants who are facing an arbitrary and unreasonable building manager.\n|LineColor = D7F717\n}}\n|ShortSummary = McQueen and Denise try to outwit a couple of con artists raising money for a non-existent orphanage.\n|LineColor = D7F717\n}}\n|ShortSummary = McQueen struggles with one bureaucratic nightmare after another, as he tries to help a couple get rid of an abandoned car on their property.\n|LineColor = D7F717\n}}\n|ShortSummary = A young woman in McQueen's office is in love with a draft dodger, working in Canada illegally.\n|LineColor = D7F717\n}}\n|ShortSummary = A would-be novelist gets suckered into investing his life savings into a vanity publishing scam.\n|LineColor = D7F717\n}}\n|ShortSummary = McQueen tries to get a refund for a man who fell for a phony hair restoration scheme.\n|LineColor = D7F717\n}}\n|ShortSummary = McQueen and Denise find a valuable rare book donated to a newspaper-sponsored book drive.\n|LineColor = D7F717\n}}\n|ShortSummary = McQueen champions the reinstatement of a teacher fired for her political beliefs.\n|LineColor = D7F717\n}}\n|ShortSummary = McQueen tries to secure a job for a lonely 70-year-old.\n|LineColor = D7F717\n}}\n|ShortSummary = McQueen goes undercover to get a young woman her deposit back on some unwanted furniture.\n|LineColor = D7F717\n}}\n|ShortSummary = McQueen faces off against a teacher who has banned skirts and sideburns in his class.\n|LineColor = D7F717\n}}\n|ShortSummary = A woman begs McQueen to help her get a passport, which the authorities have denied her.\n|LineColor = D7F717\n}}\n|ShortSummary = McQueen defends a young man mistakenly arrested for shoplifting.\n|LineColor = D7F717\n}}\n|ShortSummary = McQueen is called on to intervene when a couple of Nova Scotia drifters stay with relatives for weeks, running up outrageous bills.\n|LineColor = D7F717\n}}\n|ShortSummary = McQueen helps a woman get a refund on a cancelled flight to Jamaica, but discovers others may be in danger of getting ripped off.\n|LineColor = D7F717\n}}\n|ShortSummary = McQueen and Denise try to help a young couple get married.\n|LineColor = D7F717\n}}\n|ShortSummary = McQueen goes after used-car dealers selling \"bombs\" -- cars they know to have serious, life-threatening defects.\n|LineColor = D7F717\n}}\n|ShortSummary = McQueen and Denise go after an old-fashioned pitchman, selling worthless bric-a-brac at wildly inflated prices.\n|LineColor = D7F717\n}}\n|ShortSummary = McQueen becomes involved with two lonely people (an artist and a poet) who may be perfect for each other.\n|LineColor = D7F717\n}}\n|ShortSummary = McQueen investigates the disappearance of an elderly woman from her home.
